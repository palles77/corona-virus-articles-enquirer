Usually, RdRp domains are readily identifiable by comparative sequence analysis, but biochemical confirmation and characterization can be hampered by intrinsic protein properties and technical complications. It is presumed that replication and transcription of the $30-kb severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) RNA genome are catalyzed by an RdRp domain in the C-terminal part of nonstructural protein 12 (nsp12), one of 16 replicase subunits. However, thus far full-length nsp12 has proven refractory to expression in bacterial systems, which has hindered both the biochemical characterization of coronavirus RNA synthesis and RdRp-targeted antiviral drug design. Here, we describe a combined strategy involving bacterial expression of an nsp12 fusion protein and its in vivo cleavage to generate and purify stable SARS-CoV nsp12 (106 kDa) with a natural N-terminus and C-terminal hexahistidine tag. This recombinant protein possesses robust in vitro RdRp activity, as well as a significant DNAdependent activity that may facilitate future inhibitor studies. The SARS-CoV nsp12 is primer dependent on both homo-and heteropolymeric templates, supporting the likeliness of a close enzymatic collaboration with the intriguing RNA primase activity that was recently proposed for coronavirus nsp8.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a family of +RNA viruses that infect a wide range of vertebrates including humans, as exemplified by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and various respiratory infections caused by less-virulent family members (4) . The group is also known for its exceptionally large polycistronic genome of $30 kb, which is 5 0 capped and 3 0 polyadenylated RNA. The 5 0 -proximal two-thirds of the CoV genome (open reading frames 1a and 1b) are translated into the viral replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab. The 3 0 -proximal third encodes the viral structural proteins and several so-called accessory proteins, which can only be expressed following the production of a set of four to nine sg mRNAs (5, 6) . In particular, it is this CoV hallmark that has attracted attention over the years, since these sg mRNAs consist of sequences that are noncontiguous in the viral genome: a common 5 0 leader sequence is attached to body segments representing a variable part of the 3 0 -proximal genomic region. According to the now widely supported transcription model of Sawicki and Sawicki (7) , the arterivirus and CoV sg RNAs derive from a discontinuous step during minus-strand RNA synthesis that is guided by specific RNA signals and resembles copy-choice RNA recombination (5, 6, 8) . This mechanism produces a set of subgenomelength negative-strand templates from which the sg mRNAs are produced. The unusual genome size of CoVs and the complexity of their RNA synthesis hint at an RdRp that may have special properties, either by itself or in conjunction with other subunits of the CoV replication/transcription complex (RTC).",

            "text": "CoV replication and transcription are driven by the 15 or 16 viral nonstructural proteins (nsps) encoded in the replicase gene, which include many enzyme activities that are rare or lacking in other families of +RNA viruses (9, 10) . These nsps are produced during co-and posttranslational processing of the pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins by two or three internal viral proteinases (11) . In the years following the 2003 SARS outbreak, bioinformatics, structural biology, (reverse) genetics and biochemical studies have all contributed to the in-depth characterization of CoV nsps in general and those of SARS-CoV in particular (9, 10, 12) . Currently documented enzyme activities include proteinases (11) , a putative RNA primase (13) , a superfamily 1 helicase (14) , an exo-and an endoribonuclease (15, 16) , single-stranded RNA (ssRNA)binding proteins (17, 18) and two methyltransferases (19, 20) . Following the sequence analysis of the first CoV genomes, more than two decades ago, the putative RdRp domain of the coronavirus RTC had already been identified by comparative sequence analysis (21, 22) . The C-terminal, two-thirds of the 932-amino-acid subunit, now known as nsp12 was confidently aligned with the conserved motifs of well-known RdRps (22, 23) . In view of its unprecedented size among viral RdRp subunits, which commonly consist of 500-600 amino acids, nsp12 may well harbor other functional domains in its as-yet uncharacterized N-terminal domain. Biochemical information on the CoV RdRp has, however, remained scarce thus far, particularly since full-length nsp12 was refractory to expression in bacterial systems. Preliminary evidence for the in vitro RdRp activity of nsp12 came from a study of the SARS-CoV enzyme by Cheng et al. (24) . However, their experiments, employing a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-nsp12 fusion protein, were hampered by protein instability, which resulted in the fragmentation of the protein into three parts. Primer-dependent activity on poly(A) templates was observed in filter binding assays, but the enzyme biochemistry was not further characterized in detail.",

            "text": "Given its pivotal role in viral replication and the efficacy of polymerase inhibitors used to combat other virus infections, the SARS-CoV RdRp is widely regarded as an important and attractive target for the rational design of anti-CoV drugs (23, 25) . We therefore sought to solve the technical issues described above and develop reliable protocols for stable expression, purification and in vitro activity of the full-length CoV nsp12. In this article, we describe an expression strategy utilizing in vivo cleavage in a bacterial expression system by ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 1 (Ubp1), which releases the small N-terminal fusion partner ubiquitin (Ub) and generates a recombinant nsp12 protein containing its natural N-terminus. This was found to be a critical step on the road toward purification of a stable recombinant SARS-CoV RdRp. We subsequently established that fulllength nsp12 can readily synthesize RNA in a primerdependent fashion on both homo-and heteropolymeric RNA templates and is also efficient at incorporating deoxy-nucleotides on a DNA template. This work therefore provides a solid basis for the further biochemical characterization of the coronavirus nsp12 and the detailed dissection of its role in viral replication and transcription. Understanding the enzyme's properties will be essential for the development of selective coronavirus RdRp inhibitors and will likely provide novel insights into the intriguing (evolutionary) relation between the RdRp of nidoviruses and other groups of +RNA viruses.",

For our study, the nsp12-coding region was amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from the genome of SARS-CoV Frankfurt-1 (AY291315). During amplification, the ORF1a/1b \u00c01 ribosomal frameshift near the 5 0 -end of the gene was corrected in a translationally silent manner. Primers used for amplification were SAV424 5 0 -GCGGGTACCCCGCGGTGGAT CTGCGGATGCATCAA-3 0 and SAV425 5 0 -GCGCGAT CGGGATCCCTGCAAGACTGTATGT-3 0 , corresponding to SARS-CoV genome positions 13 327-13 387 and 16 152-16 166, respectively. The PCR amplicon was digested with SacII and BamHI, and ligated into expression vector pET26-Ub-CHis 6 (26). Following confirmation of the nucleotide sequence of the amplicon and using the flanking XbaI and XhoI restriction sites, the ubiquitin-nsp12-His 6 fusion gene (Ub-nsp12-CHis 6 ) was subcloned into vector pASK3 (IBA) and thereby placed under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter. This ruled out the known risk of potential contamination with T7 RNA polymerase, as it can occur when using a T7 promoter to drive expression of other RdRps in bacterial expression systems. Nsp12 active-site mutant D618A, carrying an Asp618Ala substitution, was engineered via site-directed mutagenesis according to the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene), using primers SAV526 5 0 -CCTTA TGGGTTGGGCTTATCCAAAATGTG-3 0 and SAV527 5 0 -CACATTTTGGATAAGCCCAACCCATAAGGA-3 0 .",

To avoid the known risk of T7 RNA polymerase contamination when purifying another RdRp using a T7 promoter-driven expression system [like E. coli BL21(DE3)], the Ub-nsp12-CHis 6 fusion gene was subsequently transferred to plasmid pASK3, placing it under control of a tetracyclineinducible promoter. Initially, the protease that was later used to remove the Ub tag was not co-expressed and the expression of the full-length Ub-tagged nsp12-CHis 6 was compared to that of variants containing either maltose binding protein (MBP) or thioredoxin (Thio) as fusion partner. As shown in Figure 1B and as also documented in the previous work of Cheng et al. (24) , expression and purification of nsp12 fusion proteins resulted in the abundant and progressive fragmentation of the protein.

Structural studies subsequently revealed that a native N-terminus is required for the proper folding of the RdRp's 'fingers' subdomain and the positioning of the 3D pol active site (30) . These findings suggested to us that N-terminal additions might also hamper the proper folding of the SARS-CoV RdRp and could thus be the principal cause of its subsequent degradation. We therefore co-expressed the C-terminal Ub protease Ubp1 (26) , which specifically recognizes the cleavage site in our fusion protein that is located between the Ub moiety and the N-terminus of nsp12 (LRGG#SADAS). Proteolytic cleavage of the fusion protein at this site liberated an nsp12-CHis 6 product ( Figure 1A ), now containing its natural Nterminus. The expression of the Ubp1 protease was driven by the relatively weak constitutive ADH1 promoter (26) . Hence, to ensure optimal release of nsp12-CHis 6 by the protease, induction of Ub-nsp12-CHis 6 expression was performed only in the middle or late log-phase of bacterial growth. Induction at lower densities or on-column cleavages performed with the cleavable MBP and Thio fusion proteins resulted in significant amounts of degraded nsp12, which was inactive in RdRp assays (data not shown).",

Non-denaturing gel filtration yielded a single peak corresponding to a size of about 140 \u00b1 10 kDa as estimated by comparison to a standard curve ( Figure  1E -F). This is different from the calculated mass of 106 kDa, but may be explained by, e.g. a very open or nonglobular structure of the protein.

            "text": "+RNA virus replication may proceed through a variety of scenarios, but essentially viral RdRps employ only two fundamentally different mechanisms during the first step of RNA synthesis: initiation can occur either de novo, when the 3 0 hydroxyl group of the first nucleotide essentially is the 'primer' to which a second nucleotide is added, or initiation can depend on an oligonucleotide or protein primer (32). Imbert et al. (13) recently showed that the CoV nsp8 subunit, a relatively small protein (22 kDa) that forms a hexadecameric complex with nsp7 (33), can synthesize short oligonucleotides using poly(C) templates or templates containing a 3 0 CCG/U motif. Although the exact role of nsp8 remains to be studied in much more detail, one of its proposed functions is that of an 'RNA primase' (13) . According to this hypothesis, and similar to what has been documented for cellular DNA polymerases (34) , the oligonucleotide products of nsp8 activity would serve as primers for the viral 'main RdRp', i.e. nsp12. Some other observations were also consistent with the possibility that the SARS-CoV main RdRp belongs to the class of primer-dependent polymerases. First, modeling of the structure of SARS-CoV nsp12 residues 400-900 suggested that the central domain of the protein contains a G motif, a signature present in all primerdependent RdRps (23) . Second, when using the unstable GST-nsp12 fusion protein in combination with a poly(A) template and a poly(U) primer, Cheng et al. (24) observed a moderate RdRp activity in filter-binding assays. Convincing evidence for the extension of an RNA primer in vitro, however, has not been documented thus far.",

The slight reduction of input primer in the D618A lane probably resulted from degradation by RNase activity. The D618A mutant showed 8 \u00b1 3% residual activity (mean of three independent experiments). In the loading control ( Figure 2B and C, lower panels) the two nsp12 variants were visualized by silver staining of an SDS-PAGE gel. and 761, the latter two amino acids being part of the nidovirus-specific SDD motif (23, (35) (36) (37) . In other viral RdRps, single or multiple substitutions of the equivalent residues with alanine or asparagine were shown to change or even abolish polymerase activity (38, 39) , depending on the assay conditions used. For the PV 3D pol , for example, it was found that mutagenesis of the motif C core sequence, changing it from GDD to GDN, was detrimental in the presence of Mg 2+ , but not when Mn 2+ or Fe 2+ were provided as divalent cation (38) . To obtain an active site mutant that could be used as negative control during further development of our assays, we engineered nsp12 mutant D618A. As portrayed in Figure 2B and C, the mutant protein displayed only 8 \u00b1 3% residual primer extension activity in our assays ( Figure 2B-D) , thus confirming the nsp12-specific nature of the RdRp activity described here and supporting the prior hypothesis that this residue is a key player in the enzyme's active site. Further or complete knockdown of activity may be obtained under slightly different assay conditions or in combination with substitution of other active site residues, which remain to be tested in future studies.",

Therefore, all subsequent experiments were performed at 30 C.

Furthermore, following the basic characterization of individual enzymes, the interplay with templates, cofactors and other subunits of the viral enzyme complex can be addressed. Ultimately, this should facilitate the in vitro reconstitution of the holoenzyme complex and the analysis of its interactions at each step of viral replication and transcription. After the purification of active SARS-CoV nsp12 and exploration of the reaction conditions, our subsequent step toward such a future goal was to evaluate the rate of nucleotide incorporation by the SARS-CoV RdRp. On a primed U 10 template we found relatively poor incorporation rates (1.2 \u00b1 0.4 nM/min) and a major product that was 2-3 nt shorter than the expected full-length product ( Figure 6A) , with product sizes displaying a similar Gaussian-like distribution as depicted in the graphs in Figure 3 . On the other hand, we also observed minor products that were slightly longer than full length, suggesting slippage of the polymerase at the end of the template. We did not detect any terminal transferase activity on the templates used (data not shown). A and B) Tests to determine the influence of temperature indicated that nsp12 incorporates ATP most efficiently at 37 C, although this effect mainly stemmed from increased initiation. Based on these results, 30 C was taken as the standard for subsequent experiments. (C and D) Titration of the Mg 2+ concentration showed that activity reaches its maximum at 6 mM. (E and F) The effect of pH on RdRp activity was evident as well, with lower pHs limiting the activity of the enzyme. All reactions were incubated for 60 min at 30 C, unless otherwise indicated. Error bars in A, C and E represent standard error of the mean (n = 3).",

When the products of the latter reactions were resolved by denaturing PAGE ( Figure 6D ) they were found to be longer than template length. Similar products extending beyond unit length have been often observed when short templates were used for PV 3D pol (43) and their generation can be explained by various mechanisms, such as distributive slippage, processive slippage, template switching or terminal transferase activity (43 and references therein).

We found that even a single-step purification scheme could produce an enzyme preparation that combined specific activity with reasonable purity (>80-85%). Of particular importance in our expression protocol was the co-expression of the Ubp1 protease that mediated the in vivo removal of the N-terminal Ub tag ( Figure 1A ) (26) . Apparently, similar to PV 3D pol (30) , SARS-CoV RdRp does not tolerate additional amino acids at its N-terminus, likely because they induce an unstable and largely inactive fold. Because of the observed sensitivity to N-terminal fusions, it is tempting to speculate that the processing of the pp1ab cleavage generating the nsp12 N-terminus is of great importance for proper folding and activity in vivo as well. In line with this notion, it was reported that for the related group 2 CoV mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) this cleavage site indeed is indispensable for virus replication (44) .

Previously, the PV and HCV RdRps were demonstrated to bind RNA with K d values of 2-10 mM (45) and $3 mM (46), respectively. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV nsp12 binds RNA with slightly higher affinity for both dsRNA and ssRNA (K d $ 0.1 mM). The relatively similar affinities for dsRNA and ssRNA suggest that the lack of de novo initiation may largely be due to a relatively open structure and the absence of a conserved priming loop in the predicted thumb subdomain (23) . The latter structural element, a b-hairpin in, e.g. hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B, is present in many known de novo initiating RNA polymerases.

Although this suggests that SARS-CoV RdRp exists predominantly as monomer under the conditions used here, it is likely that nsp12 binds to various other viral replicase subunits (50) and cellular cofactors (51) in vivo. The CoV holo-enzyme complex formed in this manner may have more finely tuned characteristics than documented in this study.

(A) Expression of nsp12 was performed in the presence of the ubiquitin (Ub) protease Ubp1, which removed the N-terminal Ub fusion partner by cleaving after the LRGG signature that formed the junction between the Ub and nsp12 moieties. This in vivo cleavage created the native nsp12 amino-terminus with the sequence SADAS. (B) Western blotting using an nsp12specific polyclonal antiserum identified a single band of the expected mass after purification of the in vivo cleaved expression product. Isolation of fusion proteins with different N-terminal tags resulted in common patterns of degradation. Similar results were reported by Cheng et al. (24) for a GST-nsp12 fusion protein. (C) Purified nsp12-CHis 6 was readily visualized by Coomassie staining as a $106-kDa protein product, in line with the expected mass. Inductions in the absence of Ubp1 expression, however, resulted in a mixture of full-length fusion protein and degradation products, likely as a result of improper folding. No RdRp activity was observed for these preparations. (D) Gel filtration analysis of purified nsp12 in assay buffer showed a single peak, corresponding to a globular molecular weight of 140 \u00b1 10 kDa, suggesting that only the monomeric form of nsp12 is present under the conditions used.",

Subsequently, after 10 min, different unlabeled nucleotides were added to a final concentration of 50 mM to allow elongation for another 30 min. (B) SARS-CoV nsp12 allows only limited transversional and transitional misincorporations. Interestingly, also in the presence of dATP no significant activity was observed, implying that the SARS-CoV RdRp is capable of discriminating between ATP and dATP.
