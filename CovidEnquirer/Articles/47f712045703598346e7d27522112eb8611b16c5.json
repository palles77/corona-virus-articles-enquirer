It is estimated that more than 2 million Canadians have diabetes, although many will go undiagnosed until a related health crisis occurs (2) . Diabetes is also one of the most costly chronic diseases. In Canada, at least $9 billion is spent annually managing diabetes and its complications (2) , and individuals with diabetes incur 2.4 times as many healthcare costs as those without the disease (1), including direct medical costs and other indirect costs (i.e., time lost from work) (3) .",

The DCPC recommends that by 2006, 50% of those with diabetes be seen at a DEC; as well, it recommends a clinician-to-patient ratio of no less than 1 team per 1000 patients (3) .",

The optimal care and management of diabetes require intensive physiological monitoring and behavioural change (5) . As well, interventions to ensure optimal diabetes management-such as glycemic monitoring, nutrition counselling, psychosocial support and screening for complications-are all resource-intensive and require the involvement of both healthcare providers and patients (6) . Because of limited specialized resources and increasing prevalence rates, the gap between the need for service and its timely provision is widening. The DCPC estimates that the average waiting list for an initial visit at a DEC is about 35 days (3), and other barriers may also exist, such as transportation, parking, loss of income and anxieties related to the hospital/DEC setting (1) .",

Some internet solutions did not provide a comprehensive management program, using the internet only as a chat room or focusing on only a portion of diabetes management (10, 11) . Methodological deficiencies were also noted in the literature, as most studies were nonrandomized or had a short time frame for follow-up (12, 13) . Measurement of such systems' efficacy in improving glycemic control were also lacking; results were focused primarily on improving the number of clinic visits, the number of tests and patient satisfaction (8, 11) . As clinicians continue to integrate new interventions or methods of improving diabetes management into their practice, new initiatives must meet evidencebased quality of care standards, and their benefits must be substantiated with respect to improvements in diabetes outcomes (14) .This study examined a comprehensive interactive internet program as an adjunct to the current DEC program in the follow-up of patients with diabetes and as a potential solution to ongoing chronic disease management.",

Patients in these 2 groups seemed to have progressed in the same direction and at a similar rate. When progress was examined within each group, however, there were positive changes in most of the lab measures between baseline and different time points ( Table 3 ).The intervention group's TG level improved significantly from baseline to 6 month follow-up, with a drop from 2.30 to 1.90 mmol/L; the control group, on the other hand, did not show any significant improvement at any time point. A significant improvement was also observed in the intervention group for A1C: mean A1C dropped from 6.7 to 6.5% from baseline to 3 months. However, this significant change was not extended to 6 months or 1 year. There were no significant changes in the control group for this measure. The control group did significantly better with respect to LDL-C level at 1 year (2.47 mmol/L) over baseline (3.19 mmol/L). Figures 1 and 2 illustrate how mean TG and A1C levels changed from baseline to 1 year follow-up. Figure 1 shows that the intervention group's TG level was slightly higher than that of the control group at baseline. There was no significant drop in TG level from baseline to 6 months in the control group. At 1 year, the mean TG level actually showed an increase in the control group. On the other hand, the mean TG level in the intervention group was maintained at 3 months and then dropped significantly at 6 months. This lower level was maintained to 1 year. The comparison demonstrates that the intervention group achieved a better management of TG levels than the control group. Figure 2 shows that the control and the intervention groups had comparable A1C levels at baseline.There was no change in A1C from baseline to 6 months in the control group.At 1 year,A1C actually increased in the control group. A1C in the intervention group, however, dropped significantly at 3 months and then was maintained from 6 months to 1 year. This comparison demonstrates that the intervention group achieved a better management and control of A1C than the control group. Table 3 also shows that patients in the intervention group were also more satisfied at the 3 and 6 month follow-up compared to their own baseline, but the control group did not show a significant improvement compared to its own baseline. It was noted that the absolute satisfaction level at baseline for the control group was higher than that in the intervention group; however, the difference was not statistically significant.

            "text": "The within-group analysis comparing baseline to various follow-ups demonstrates significant statistical differences in TG and A1C at 6 and 3 months, respectively. Both A1C and TG have important clinical relevance in the management of diabetes, as they are both markers of metabolic control and are used to assess risk for macrovascular complications, such as coronary artery disease, cardiovascular disease and peripheral vascular disease.The clinical significance of lowering TG levels is seen in the decreased risk of vascular damage or disease progression. Many healthcare providers believe that a 0.3 mmol/L reduction in TG indicates a marked improvement in a patient's vascular health (23) . A decrease in A1C reflects an improvement in overall glycemic control for the preceding 3 months.A reduction in A1C of 0.2% may not be the ideal 0.5 to 1% reduction that is often cited in the liter-ature as decreasing the risks of complications associated with diabetes (24), but any decrease in A1C is still clinically relevant. When progress in these 2 measurements was charted (Figures 1 and 2) , it was apparent that the intervention group was not only able to improve significantly with respect to these laboratory values, they were also able to maintain the improvement better than the control group. Even though a drop in A1C and TG is crucial in the management of diabetes, a more contributing clinical finding was a trend in the maintenance of metabolic control (A1C and TG) by those in the intervention group for the duration of 1 year. It is also worth noting that most significant positive effects were present at the 3 month and 6 month follow-up, but not at 1 year (no significant changes may indicate maintenance). A potential explanation may be that, because many patients were enrolled late into the study, they were followed for only 3 months. This resulted in a reduced sample size for the 6 month follow-up, and even further reduction for the 1 year follow-up (Table 3) , resulting in a lack of power to detect difference due to small sample size. Currently, the gold standard in diabetes care is for a DEC to provide education and management with a team of healthcare professionals, despite being a costly and labour-intensive approach. For there to be no significant difference between the intervention and control groups with respect to management could indicate that the patients in the intervention group were doing just as well as those in the control group.",

Further research may also explore other chronic disease processes that require intense, ongoing monitoring and management, such as congestive heart failure or cardiac rehabilitation.
