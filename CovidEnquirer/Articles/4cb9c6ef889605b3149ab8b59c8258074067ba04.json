Bats of several species in southern People's Republic of China harbor SARS-like CoVs and may be reservoir hosts for them. To determine whether bats in North America also harbor coronaviruses, we used reverse transcription-PCR to detect coronavirus RNA in bats. We found coronavirus RNA in 6 of 28 fecal specimens from bats of 2 of 7 species tested. The prevalence of viral RNA shedding was high: 17% in Eptesicus fuscus and 50% in Myotis occultus. Sequence analysis of a 440-bp amplicon in gene 1b showed that these Rocky Mountain bat coronaviruses formed 3 clusters in phylogenetic group 1 that were distinct from group 1 coronaviruses of Asian bats. Because of the potential for bat coronaviruses to cause disease in humans and animals, further surveillance and characterization of bat coronaviruses in North America are needed.",

Defense against emerging infectious diseases, identifi cation of reservoirs for such viruses, surveillance for host-jumping events, and elucidation of viral and host factors that may facilitate such events are warranted. The epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003 was caused by a newly emerged zoonotic coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, genus Coronavirus). Other coronaviruses have also jumped to new host species and caused emerging diseases. For example, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus emerged in European pigs from an unknown host species during the late 1970s and caused severe enteric disease (3) . Human coronavirus OC43 is believed to have been derived from bovine coronavirus (4) . In addition, the genomes of canine and feline coronaviruses can recombine in vivo and have developed into different biotypes that are serially transmissible in their new host species (5) .",

Epidemiologic studies demonstrated that the fi rst human cases of SARS were caused by coronaviruses closely related to viruses found in masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) in live animal markets (6) . Subsequently, surveys of coronaviruses in domestic animals, livestock, poultry, and wildlife were conducted in Southeast Asia to identify the reservoir(s) of SARS-CoV. On the basis of low prevalence of SARS-like CoVs in wild and farmed masked palm civets, these animals are now believed to be an intermediate host rather than a primary reservoir for SARS-CoV (7). During these surveys, a wide variety of coronaviruses were detected in many bat species in Asia (8) (9) (10) (11) .",

Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genome sequences of the bat SARS-like CoVs showed that they form a large and diverse clade within phylogenetic group 2b (also called group 4), which includes SARS-CoVs from palm civets and humans obtained during the 2002-2003 outbreak (10, 12, 13) . Thus, the virus responsible for the SARS pandemic may have originated from bats, perhaps with the palm civet as an intermediate host. In addition to SARS-like CoVs, RNAs of many other viruses belonging to coronavirus groups 1 and 2a, and proposed new group 5, were detected in several species of Asian bats (8, 9, 14, 15) .

Four big brown bats, 3 long-eared myotis, 8 occult myotis, 1 Brazilian free-tailed bat, 7 long-legged myotis (M. volans), and 2 silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans) were trapped in mist nets during the nights of August 14-20 as they drank or foraged near open water at 2 sewage treatment lagoons (9 km apart) (site 4) in Montezuma County, Colorado.

The gene encoding the viral spike glycoprotein that binds the virus receptor human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 was one of the fastest-adapting genes of SARS-CoV during the 2002-2003 epidemic. Nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions in the spike protein that were selected during the epidemic optimized binding of the spike to its human receptor and enhanced human-to-human transmission (34, 35) . Sequencing of SARS-CoV genomes during and after the epidemic suggests that multiple independent species-jumping events of SARS-CoV from animals to humans have occurred.",

When larger numbers of bats and additional bat species in North America are studied, additional bat coronaviruses with complex phylogenetic attributes, biogeographic patterns, and perhaps epizootiologic attributes may be discovered. For example, determining if North American bat coronaviruses are species-specifi c will provide useful information. In Asia, different species of bats roosting in the same cave host different coronaviruses (9) . However, bats of 1 species can also harbor different types of coronaviruses at different geographic locations (9) .",

We fi nd this hypothesis intriguing, in light of the high prevalence and diversity of coronaviruses in bats in North America found in our initial small survey. The North American species of bats found to harbor group 1 coronaviruses commonly roost in buildings inhabited by humans (39) , which provides ecologic overlap between these bats and humans. Before the SARS epidemic of 2002-2003, only 2 coronaviruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, were known to cause human disease, primarily mild upper respiratory tract infections. In contrast, SARS-CoV caused severe lower respiratory tract disease with a death rate of 10%. Recently, 2 additional human coronaviruses, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1, were discovered and found to cause both upper and lower respiratory tract infections worldwide (40) .",
