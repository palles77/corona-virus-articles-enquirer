            "text": "Background: Since the turn of the century seven new respiratory viruses have infected man and two of these have resulted in worldwide epidemics. Both SARS Coronavirus which quickly spread to 29 countries in February 2003 and H1N1 swine influenza that recently spread from Mexico to 30 countries in three weeks represent major pandemic threats for mankind. Diagnostic assays are required to detect novel influenza strains with pandemic potential. Objective: In this report we evaluate the ability of a multiplex PCR test (xTAG TM RVP) to detect new, \"non-seasonal\" influenza viruses including the H1N1 swine influenza A/swine/California/04/2009. Study design: Laboratory based study using retrospective and prospective specimens. Results: This multiplex PCR test detected the present of non-seasonal (non-H1, non-H3) influenza in 20 of 20 patients infected with H1N1 swine flu virus. In addition to detecting the current swine flu the xTAG TM RVP test detected the H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/2004 high pathogenicity avian influenza virus that circulated in South East Asia in 2003 as well as 17 out of 17 influenza A viruses representing 11 HA subtypes isolated from birds, swine and horses not yet seen in the human population. Conclusion: Based on these results we believe that this molecular test can perform an important role as a sentinel test to detect novel non-seasonal influenza A viruses in patients presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI) and therefore act as an early warning system for the detection of future pandemic influenza threats.",

            "text": "The current outbreak of swine influenza that originated in Mexico in March 2009 has spread to 39 countries in one month causing 8,480 cases globally with 66 deaths as of May 17. 1 The 2009 swine flu virus designated H1N1 A/swine/California/04/2009 is not zoonotic swine flu and is not transmitted from pigs to humans, but rather from person to person. In humans, H1N1 swine flu presents as an influenza-like illness (ILI) with symptoms similar to those of seasonal influenza viz. namely chills, fever, sore throat, muscle pains, severe headache, coughing, weakness and general discomfort. 2 Since these symptoms are not specific to swine flu, early in the pandemic physicians were advised to consider swine influenza in the differential diagnosis of patients with acute febrile respiratory illness who had returned from Mexico or been in contact with persons with confirmed swine flu however, this epidemiological link will require modification. 3 This new strain of H1N1 swine influenza appears to be a result of reassortment of two swine influenza viruses, one from North America and one from Europe with the North American virus itself the product of previous reassortments, carrying an avian PB2 gene for at least 10 years and a human PB1 gene since 1993. The hemagglutinin (HA) gene is similar to that of swine flu viruses present in United States pigs since 1999, while neuraminidase (NA) and matrix (M) genes resemble viruses present in European pigs. Viruses with this genetic makeup have not previously been found in humans or pigs, although there is no formal national surveillance system to identify what viruses are circulating in pigs in North America. The genetic makeup of this virus is germaine to the design of molecular tests for diagnosis.",

            "text": "Multiplex PCR testing for the detection of respiratory viruses has seen major advances over the past decade resulting in the development of several commercially available tests. 4 These tests can amplify one or more genes from a number of respiratory viruses and detect amplified products using microgene arrays. One test, the xTAG TM RVP test, was developed to detect 20 different virus types and subtypes in a single test using multiplex RT-PCR and detection with a microfluidic array on the Luminex 100 instrument. 5 The xTAG TM RVP test was developed in 2005 immediately following SARS and H5N1 influenza and was designed to detect and type the three influenza A subtypes circulating at that time viz. H1, H3 and H5. Understanding how the xTAG TM RVP test identifies influenza A is important to its detection of new \"non-seasonal\" influenza viruses. The test amplifies a conserved part of the matrix gene found in all influenza A viruses and specific regions of the H1 or H3 genes. 6 The test therefore simultaneously detects influenza A and determines the H1 or H3 subtype. Since all seasonal influenza viruses in man over the past 20 years (prior to H5N1 in 2003 and swine influenza in 2009) have been either H1 or H3, the RVP test can effectively detect the presence of non-seasonal (non-H1, non-H3) virus by virtue of a positive matrix gene signal and negative H1 and H3 signals, a combination of results that flag a \"new\" influenza subtype and potential pandemic threat.",

The influenza subtypes tested included both high pathogenicity and low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses isolated from four bird species (turkey, quail, mallard, chicken) in five countries (Canada, Italy, England, U.S.A., and Vietnam), four swine and two equine viruses. The results show that all 17 viruses had a positive matrix signal (mean, 7,692) and negative signals for both H1 and H3 genes ( Table 2) . For comparison, one H1 and two H3 seasonal influenza specimens gave readings of 8,716, 1,566, and 3,255 for the H1 and H3 targets, respectively. The RVP test also correctly flagged two H5N1 isolates as H5 subtypes (using unmasked software).

By running the test daily as a sentinel test, we have been able to provide public health authorities with a probable swine flu result with a 24 h turn around time faster than that provided by our Public Health Laboratories. While laboratories rush to build H1N1 swine flu specific assays, currently available molecular tests such as the xTAG TM RVP assay provide a solution for detecting swine flu cases in the absence of specific H1N1 swine flu tests. We believe that the RVP test if implemented in diagnostic algorithms can play an important role as a sentinel test to detect novel non-seasonal influenza A viruses in patients presenting with ILI and therefore act as an early warning system for the detection of future pandemic influenza threats.",
