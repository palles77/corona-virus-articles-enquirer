The dominant vectors of dengue viruses (Aedes spp.) 94 thrive in areas where they are able to associate with humans, as humans provide not only a 95 preferred source of blood but also water containers that the mosquitoes use for egg laying and 96 for larval and pupal development (Morrison et al. 2008) . Two additional aspects of Aedes 97 ecology -limited dispersal distance of the mosquito (Harrington et al. 2005) and daytime biting 98 (Akram et al. 2009 ) -imply that human movement should be the primary means by which the 99 viruses spread spatially (Stoddard et al. 2009 ). Indeed, analyses of dengue transmission 100 dynamics at a variety of scales have strongly supported this hypothesis (Allicock et al. 2012; 101 Stoddard et al. 2013; Bhoomiboonchoo et al. 2014; Reiner et al. 2014) . To the extent that 102 human movement in dense urban environments is more well-mixed than elsewhere, there are 103 likely to be differences in the extent of inhomogeneous mixing in peri-urban and rural areas. 104 This is also presumably the case for directly transmitted pathogens, but with a potentially even 105 stronger discrepancy for dengue due to the urban-rural gradient in mosquito densities. 106",

Transmission is limited by the availability of a competent disease vector. Due to a 132 lack of resources and political instability no comprehensive nation wide entomological surveys 133 have been performed in Pakistan. Therefore we use a probabilistic model to infer the 134 probability of occurrence of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus in Pakistan derived from a globally 135 comprehensive dataset containing more than 20,000 records for each species (Figure 1a and  136 b). Such model outputs have proven useful in identifying areas of risk of transmission of 137 dengue as well as malaria (Gething et al. 2011; Sinka et al. 2012; Bhatt et al. 2013) . Other 138 important environmental conditions defining the risk of transmission of dengue are 139 temperature, water availability, and vegetation cover (Messina et al. 2015) . To account for such 140 variation, raster layers of daytime land surface temperature (LST) were processed from the 141 MOD11A2 satellite, gap-filled to remove missing values, and then averaged to a monthly 142 temporal resolution for all four years (Weiss et al. 2015) . The density of vegetation coverage 143 has been shown to be associated with vector abundance (Eisen & Lozano-Fuentes 2009) . 144",

Seasonal variation in 81 mixing might arise because of travel associated with labor (Bharti et al. 2011), religious events 82 (Lessler et al. 2014), or vacation (Deville et al. 2014). A major driver of flu is associated with 83 the timing of school openings (Salath\u00e9 et al. 2010), social networks (Cauchemez et al. 2011), 84 and spatial variation in mixing could arise because of cultural differences and the geographic 85 scales of interest (Brockmann & Helbing 2013; Vazquez-Prokopec et al. 2013; Read et al. 86 2014), because of variation in the density and quality of roads (Uchida & Nelson 2008), or 87 because of variation in human densities and myriad factors associated with that (Bj\u00f8rnstad et 88 al. 2002; Simini et al. 2012).

When the nested model that allows 260 Lahore's mixing coefficient to vary was fit, there was no significant difference in the two mixing 261 coefficients (p-value\u22481). 262 263 Model analysis: 264 Given a difference in estimates of the mixing parameters between Lahore and elsewhere of 265 0.15, we analyzed eqn.

For the purpose of ceteris paribus comparisons, we assumed equal force 268 of infection but varied it across several orders of magnitude. Depending on the order of 269 magnitude, estimates of transmission coefficients made if overestimating the mixing parameter 270 by 0.15 could easily result in a two-to three-fold underestimate in the transmission coefficient 271 (Figure 4). For realistic ranges of the transmission coefficient for dengue, and more generally 272 the basic reproductive number R0, this extent of underestimation of R0 could lead to 273 underestimating the critical proportion of the population to which vaccines or other control 274 measures must be applied by 20-30% (",

In the case of dengue this again has 300 been limited by the availability of high resolution data (Ruberto et al. 2015). Complementing 301 this analysis with measurement of direct social contact patterns could be important to explore 302 this relationship in even more detail (Bauch & Galvani 2013; Vazquez-Prokopec et al. 2013; 303 Heesterbeek et al. 2015) and could be informed by mathematical models that explored this 304 relationship previously for other diseases (Bj\u00f8rnstad et al. 2002; Reiner et al. 2012). Another 305 encouraging finding is that large-scale mosquito suitability surfaces help capture the 306 environmental determinants of dengue transmission (Bhatt et al. 2013). 307 308 Intervention strategies are contingent on both understanding key environmental drivers of 309 transmission and the dynamics of ongoing human-to-human transmission, particularly in 310 outbreaks situations (Perkins et al. 2015).

This in fact is even more important 318 in areas of low infection where transmission seems to be more focal (Salje et al. 2012). Again 319 however importance needs to be focused on the spatial and temporal resolution of appropriate 320 intervention strategies and the respective effect of the selected covariates and model 321 parameters (Mills & Riley 2014). Empirical understanding, however, on which spatial resolution 322 is most appropriate to carry out large-scale vector-borne disease interventions remains 323 unknown. 324 325 Once transmission has occurred in one place, understanding not only spatial heterogeneities of 326 transmission dynamics but their subsequent spread in mechanistic stochastic models as shown 327 for measles would help to empirically determine the propagation of the disease (Grenfell et al. 328 2001). The spatial spread dynamics have been given considerable interest globally as the risk 329 of importation of dengue into yet endemic areas continentally and internationally is increasing 330 with travel and trade (Schaffner & Mathis 2014).
