As terminal residues of glycans on proteins and lipids, Sias are key elements of glycotopes of both cellular and microbial lectins and thus act as important molecular tags in cell recognition and signaling events. Their functions in such interactions can be regulated by post-synthetic modifications, the most common of which is differential Sia-O-acetylation (O-Ac-Sias). The biology of O-Ac-Sias remains mostly unexplored, largely because of limitations associated with their specific in situ detection.",

            "text": "Sias occur in a wide variety, their diversity resulting from differences in glycosidic linkage as well as from differential modifications (Deng et al., 2013) . In most mammals, humans excluded, the parental Sia N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) can be enzymatically converted to N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) (Chou et al., 1998; Irie et al., 1998) . Another common modification is Sia-O-acetylation substituting the hydroxyl groups at carbon atoms C4, C7, C8, and/or C9 (Kamerling and Gerwig, 2006; Klein and Roussel, 1998) (Figure S1 ). In lock-and-key interactions, the presence or absence of these O-acetyl moieties can block or promote binding of cellular and microbial lectins, and their controlled addition and removal through sialate-O-acetylesterases (SOAEs) and sialate-O-transferases (SOATs) may thus act as a molecular switch to control downstream processes and events. This principle is illustrated by the regulation of peripheral B cell tolerance. Repression of antigen receptor signaling through Sia-dependent binding of Siglec 2/CD22 to the B cell receptor is modulated by Sia-9-O-acetylation/de-Oacetylation (Cariappa et al., 2009) , and defects in SOAE expression may be associated with autoimmunity (Pillai, 2013; Surolia et al., 2010) . Defective (de-)O-acetylation of Sias has also been implicated in cancer to correlate with metastatic potential, escape from apoptosis and drug resistance (B\u00fc ll et al., 2014; Ghosh et al., 2007; Mukherjee et al., 2008; Parameswaran et al., 2013) .",

A major hurdle for advancement of this field is a lack of convenient experimental approaches that would allow detection of, and distinction between, Sia variants in situ. Viruses that use Sias as receptor determinants come with a treasure trove of lectins and sugarmodifying enzymes (Neu et al., 2011) . For example, the hemagglutinin-esterase proteins (HEs) of toro-, corona-, and orthomyxo-viruses are envelope glycoproteins that mediate reversible virion attachment to O-Ac-Sias through the concerted action of distinct lectin and receptor-destroying (SOAE) domains (Figure S1A) (de Groot, 2006; Langereis et al., 2009; Langereis et al., 2012; Zeng et al., 2008) . Here, we investigated the biochemical and structural properties of toro-and coronavirus HEs with particular focus on their receptor specificity, and their potential use as tools in explorative sialoglycobiology. We demonstrate that the nidovirus ''virolectins'' have evolved to bind different O-Ac-Sia variants selectively and with such affinity as to allow detection of distinct O-Ac-sialoglycan populations in mammalian cells and tissues. We show that O-Ac-sialoglycans are expressed differentially in a species-, organ-, tissue-, and cell-type-specific fashion and that their expression is regulated even at the level of the individual cell.",

Their HEs share a common evolutionary origin with the influenza C hemagglutinin-esterase fusion protein (HEF) and were added to the respective virus proteomes relatively recently (de Groot, 2006; Zeng et al., 2008) . In the course of evolution, nidovirus HEs with novel SOAE substrate and lectin ligand specificities arose. In one lineage of rodent coronaviruses, HE ligand and substrate specificity shifted toward 4-O-Ac-Sias. Most nidovirus HEs, however, resemble influenza C virus HEF in that they bind to 9-O-Ac-Sias in a 9-O-acetyl-dependent fashion and function as sialate-9-O-acetylesterases (de Groot, 2006 ). Yet, even among this latter group of HEs, subtle but salient differences in SOAE substrate preference are apparent. For instance, porcine torovirus (PToV) HEs preferentially cleave 9-mono-O-Ac-Sias, while those of bovine toroviruses (BToVs) display a preference for 7,9-di-O-acetylated substrates (Langereis et al., 2009; Smits et al., 2005) . Also, the HEs of bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and influenza C virus, while more promiscuous in SOAE substrate usage, do show a predilection for 7,9-di-or 9-mono-O-acetylated substrates, respectively ( Figure S2A ). All HEs readily cleave O-acetyl groups both from 5-N-Gc-and 5-N-Ac-Sias, with some HEs displaying a modest preference for the latter type (Figure S2B ; for a summary of HE SOAE substrate specificities, see Figure S2C ).",

In result, binding of both BCoV-LUN and PToV-P4 HE 0 was lost ( Figure 1D ), formally demonstrating that Sia-9-O-acetylation is a strict requirement and that 7-mono-O-Ac-Sias do not serve as ligands. Upon pH/ temperature-induced C7-to-C9 migration of O-acetyl moieties (Kamerling et al., 1987) as to produce 9-mono-O-Ac-Sias, binding of PToV-P4 HE 0 was restored to levels even beyond those in native BSM (note that in native BSM, the amount of 7-O-Ac-and 7,9-di-O-Ac-Sias combined is almost twice that of 9-mono-O-Ac-Sias; Tables S2 and S3). Binding of BCoV-LUN HE 0 , how-ever, was restored only partially ( Figure 1D ). The results show that PToV-P4 HE 0 is a high-specificity lectin for 9-mono-O-Ac-Sia.

BCoV-LUN HE differs from that of BCoV-Mebus in only seven residues, one of which is in a loop at the rim of the Sia binding site ( Figure 2C ). This single amino acid variation (T 114 in BCoV-Mebus, I 114 in BCoV-LUN HE) fully accounts for the observed 3-fold difference in binding affinity toward BSM (Figures 1B and 2D) . Apparently, the Thr/Ile substitution does not alter lectin ligand preference for 7,9-di-O-over 9-mono-O-Ac-Sias; as compared to BCoV-Mebus HE, LUN HE displays equally increased affinities for either Sia type ( Figure 2A ). Based on the position of T 114 relative to the bound ligand, its exchange by Ile may affect, directly or indirectly, binding site interactions with the Sia-5-N-acyl moiety. Although not immediately obvious from replacement modeling how this would be achieved, such interactions may raise binding affinity for Sia per se but, as indicated by glycan array analysis (vide infra), also alter the lectin's relative preference for 5-N-Ac-or 5-N-Gc-Sias.",

The Sia 9-O-Ac group, crucial to receptor binding, docks into a hydrophobic pocket. The vicinity of Sia glycerol atom C8 is crowded such that substitution of an O-Ac moiety for the C8 hydroxyl is not possible without introducing steric strain. Hence, the structure of the BCoV HE receptor binding site appears incompatible with binding of 8-O-Ac-Sias. There is, however, ample space to accommodate modifications at C7. Moreover, modeling of Neu5,7,9Ac 3 in the lectin binding site revealed potential interactions between the Sia-7-O-Ac moiety and the side chains of F 211 and L 161 that could contribute to the lectin's preference for 7,9-di-O-Ac-Sias ( Figure 2E ). Accordingly, L 161 A substitution strongly decreased binding to BSM, yet, as demonstrated for BCoV-LUN HE, high-affinity binding to 7,9-di-O-Ac-Sias was affected more than low-affinity binding to 9-mono-O-Ac-Sias ( Figure 2A ). In effect, ligand fine specificity was lost, the substitution causing the BCoV-LUN HE L 161 A mutant to now bind each receptor type equally poorly.",

We therefore systematically compared the binding properties of the HEs of BCoV-LUN, BCoV-Mebus, ECoV-NC99, and PToV-P4 toward paired (Neu5Ac-or Neu5Gc-based, and a2-3 or a2-6-linked) 9-O-Ac and non-O-Ac-sialoglycans by glycan mi-croarray analysis (Padler-Karavani et al., 2011; Padler-Karavani et al., 2012) . The results, summarized in Figures 3A and S3 , indicate that all four lectins accept both a2-3and a2-6-linked 9-O-Ac-Sias, though with noted exceptions apparently related to overall glycan structure/composition. The most prominent and consistent difference was in the relative binding preference for Sias, differentially modified at C5. The PToV-P4 and ECoV-NC99 lectins displayed a clear binding bias and strongly favored 5-N-Ac-Sias. Conversely, BCoV-LUN and Mebus HEs more readily accepted both 5-N-Ac-and 5-N-Gc-Sias, albeit depending on the underlying glycan structure. Of the two lectins, BCoV-LUN HE bound more strongly to all ligands, in accordance with sp-LBA data ( Figure 1B ), and displayed a higher apparent affinity for 5-N-Gc-Sias. The results provide a clue to the observed difference between BCoV and ECoV-NC99 HEs in sp-LBA (Figure 1B) . BSM predominantly carries sialyl-Tn-type O-glycans (Kozak et al., 2012) , represented in the microarray by glycans #23 and #24. In contrast to the BCoV HEs, ECoV-NC99 HE binds 9-O-Ac-5-N-Ac-sialyl Tn exclusively (glycan #23; Figure 3A ) and not to its 5-N-glycolylated variant (glycan #24) and hence would recognize only a subpopulation of the BCoV HE glycotopes.",

Sias with multiple O-Ac moieties are absent, as are multi-antennary sialoglycans. Furthermore, differences in binding as detected by glycan array analysis may occur from differences in presentation and/or flexibility of the printed glycans and from how such variables would affect multivalent lectin-Sia interactions . Finally, the biophysical and biological consequences of modest differences in binding preference as detected by glycan array analysis are difficult to predict. Such differences may be augmented and of major significance during multivalent HEmediated virion attachment in vivo. Conversely, viral attachment to suboptimal ligands may well occur, if such glycans are present in high local densities. At any rate, the 9-O-Ac-sialoglycan populations recognized by the PToV, BCoV, and ECoV virolectins cannot be defined in absolute terms. Their binding profiles, while unique, partially overlap. PToV-P4 would seem to be the most specific in that it displays a strong predilection for 9-mono-Oacetylated, 5-N-acetylated Sias, and BCoV-LUN HE the least (for a summary of binding profiles, see Figure 3B ).",

Most cells expressing NC99 glycotopes also expressed LUN-type Sias, and in turn, most cells stained by LUN also produced Sias detectable by P4 (Figure 4A ). However, relative expression levels of each 9-O-Ac-Sia subtype varied widely from one cell to another, and cells that would seem to express LUN-or NC99-type Sias predominantly or even exclusively were also readily detected ( Figure 4A ).

Clearly, an apparent failure of virolectins to bind to the cell surface as determined by L-IFA does not necessarily mean absence of their cognate ligands. Bearing the dynamics of lectin-ligand interactions in mind, in particular the vast incremental effect of ligand valency on apparent lectin affinity (Dam and Brewer, 2010; Dam et al., 2007) , the virolectins may predominantly bind to multivalent glycoconjugates with clustered binding sites.

Given that 4-O-acetylation protects Sias against cleavage by AuS and other sialidases (Corfield et al., 1986) , we hypothesized that the AuSresistant Sias detected by P4 were both 9-and 4-O-acetylated. Accordingly, in cells treated with AuS and sialate-4-Oacetylesterase (MHV-S HE + ), all 9-O-Ac-Sias were removed ( Figure 5A ), providing compelling evidence that equine cells produce 4,9-di-O-in addition to 4mono-O-Ac-Sias. The results (1) show that nidovirus virolectins can indeed be used to detect and distinguish between different forms of 4-O-and 9-O-Ac-sialoglycans in individual cells and (2) illustrate how novel types of multiply modified Sias can be discovered and demonstrated in situ, by using viral and microbial SOAEs and sialidases in combination with L-IFA.",

            "text": "Nidovirus HEs also allowed in situ detection of O-Ac-Sias in mammalian tissues (Table 1 ; Figures S5 and S6 ). In accordance with analytic chemical findings (Rinninger et al., 2006) , 4-O-Ac-Sias were readily detectable in multiple organs and cell types in mice (most abundantly in the colon; Table 1; Figure S5 ). All human tissues, however, were negative (Table 1) . 9-O-Ac-Sias occur in various tissues in both human and mouse, albeit more profusely and widespread in the latter species (Table 1 ; Figures S5 and S6 ). Among noted species differences in Sia expression, murine, but not human, erythrocytes are covered with LUN and P4-type 9-O-Ac-Sias. However, in various organs and cell types, humans and mice display similar 9-O-Ac-Sia profiles, with P4 and LUN glycotopes differentially expressed in comparable fashion. For example, in the prostate, epithelial cells lining the ducts display low-level expression of P4-and high-level expression of LUN-type Sias ( Figures S5  and S6 ). In both species, secreted colonic mucus contains high levels of P4-and LUN-type Sias, but the mucin-producing goblet cells predominantly stain with P4 ( Figures S5 and S6 ). Differential expression of P4 and LUN glycotopes was most conspicuous in the brain, particularly in the cerebellum (Figure 6 , S5, and S6). In human and mouse, individual Purkinje cells differed widely in 9-O-Ac-Sia profile, with cells seemingly devoid of 9-O-Ac-Sias, adjacent to ones containing large quantities of P4-and/or LUN-type 9-O-Ac-Sias in granular inclusions in the cell body ( Figure 6D ). Even within single cells, P4-and Figure S4 and Table S4 . LUN-type 9-O-Ac-Sias were often found in different compartments ( Figure 6E ). Most strikingly, in the mouse, the dendritic arbors of 9-O-Ac-Sia-producing Purkinje neurons stained for LUN-type 9-O-Ac-Sias only, creating a striated, bar code-like pattern in the molecular layer in the cerebellar cortex ( Figures  6A-6C , 6F, and S5; note the robust staining of RBCs by P4). This pattern was less conspicuous in the human cerebellum, but also here, dendritic arbors stained with LUN and not with P4 ( Figure S6 ). NC99-and LUN-staining of Purkinje cells resulted in identical patterns in serial sections of mouse cerebellum (Figure 6F) , arguing against the lack of P4-binding resulting from exclusive expression of 5-N-Gc-Sias (Figure 3 ). In fact, Neu5Gc is exceedingly rare even in the murine brain (Davies and Varki, 2013) and completely absent in humans (Chou et al., 1998) . To test whether lack of P4 binding was due to prevalent Sia-7,9di-O-acetylation in Purkinje cells, sections of mouse cerebellum were enzymatically depleted for 9-O-Ac-Sias while preserving 7-O-Ac-Sias. In consequence, staining of Purkinje cells and RBCs by both P4 and LUN was lost. Subsequent pH/temperature-induced C7-to-C9 migration of the remaining Sia-7-O-Ac moieties restored staining of RBCs by P4, but saliently, that by LUN as well. While these findings provide independent confirmation that erythrocytes do express 7,9-di-O-Ac-Sias (presenting a source for 9-mono-O-Ac-Sias upon experimentally induced C7to-9-O-Ac migration), they also show that in tissue sections, under the conditions applied, LUN binds 9-mono-O-Ac-Sias too ( Figure 6F ). Importantly, the conditions that restored Sia 9-Oacetylation on RBCs did not generate P4 glycotopes in Purkinje cell dendrites, nor salvaged LUN binding. It would thus appear that the Sias in the mouse cerebellum are mainly 9-mono-Oacetylated and that the differential staining of Purkinje cells by P4 and LUN must be ascribed to a particular glycan structure and/or to Sia modifications, additional to 9-O-acetylation, that are tolerated by LUN, but not by P4. Although the LUN glycotopes in the cerebellum await definitive identification, our findings do underscore the diversity and complexity of naturally occurring O-Ac-sialoglycans and their cell(-type)-specific differential expression. It is fair to assume that like the virolectins used here, cellular lectins distinguish between these Sia populations and that regulation of lectin binding, through controlled Sia-Oacetylation/de-O-acetylation, may have far-reaching biological effects and consequences.",

Here, we demonstrate that nidoviruses are even more fastidious with respect to Sia receptor usage than appreciated so far. For all nidovirus HEs studied, the ligand specificity and SOAE substrate preference are in close accord ( Figures 3B and S2C) , indicative of co-evolution of lectin and esterase domains. Apparently, Sia subtype preference correlates with viral host tropism. The HE proteins of PToV-Markelo and -P4 are highly divergent, with only 77% identity in their ectodomains, yet both display a preference for 9-mono-O-Ac-Sias. In contrast, the HEs of BCoV and those of two distinct BToV lineages (represented by strains Breda and B150), all preferentially bind to 7,9-di-O-acetylated ligands instead ( Figure 3B ). It would seem that in toroviruses and lineage A betacoronaviruses, HE selectivity for O-Ac-Sia receptor subtypes arose as an adaptation to the ''sialomes'' of the target tissues in their respective hosts and that the shared preference of bovine corona-and toroviruses for 7,9-di-O-Ac-Sias resulted from convergent evolution.",

            "text": "Our results not only advance the understanding of virus-Sia interactions and virus evolution but also, more importantly, show how virolectins can be exploited as tools in sialoglycomics and explorative glycobiology. One of our most striking observations is the phenotypic heterogeneity among individual cells of homogenous clonal cell lines. Cells differed not only in the extent to which they expressed O-Ac-Sias but also in the types of O-Ac-Sias produced. Apparently, even in populations of tissue culture cells, cell-to-cell variation occurs in the expression of enzymes required for the biosynthesis or degradation of O-Ac-Sias and/or of the glycoconjugates that are carry these sugars. This cell-to-cell variability may be attributed to stochasticity (''noisy'' gene expression) but perhaps more likely arises from deterministic spatiotemporal influences such as population context and/ or cellular crowding (Snijder and Pelkmans, 2011) . Indeed, O-Ac-Sia-expressing cells tend to occur in islets ( Figure 4A ). HRT-18 subpopulations, selected by lectin-MACS for O-Ac-Sia surface expression or lack thereof, reverted to Sia heterogeneity over time ($7 days) and a limited number of cell generations (Figure 4D) , reminiscent of the short-term phenotypic memory seen in other examples of cell-to-cell variability (Mariani et al., 2010; Sigal et al., 2006) . Our findings raise questions regarding the triggers that induce or prevent Sia-O-acetylation in individual cells but also offer ways and means to study this phenomenon and the mechanisms involved. On a more technical note, our observations illustrate the intricacies of (sialo)glycobiology and underline the pitfalls and limitations of functional glycomics approaches based upon averaging sialoglycan content of cell populations and whole tissue samples.",

            "text": "O-Ac-Sialoglycan Expression in Mammals: Cell, Tissue, and Species Specificity Comparative analysis of mouse and human revealed important differences in Sia repertoire and sialylation profiles. For example, 4-O-Ac-Sias, abundant in mice (and horses), were not detected by virolectin histochemistry in humans, either in cultured cells or in tissues. Of two reports of 4-O-Ac Sias in humans, one involved a Sia variant, Neu4Ac5Gc (Miyoshi et al., 1986) , of established non-human, dietary origin (Banda et al., 2012; Tangvoranuntakul et al., 2003) . The other observation of Neu4,5Ac 2 and 9-O-lactylated Neu4,5Ac 2 in human erythrocytes (Bulai et al., 2003 ) as yet awaits independent confirmation. We cannot exclude that 4-O-Ac-Sias are expressed infrequently, in concentrations below our detection levels, and/or specifically in distinct types of tissues and cells absent from our human tissue arrays. Yet, the data lead us to consider that humans might not produce this type of Sia after all. Such a deficiency would not be without precedent: defective synthesis of Neu5Gc sets us apart even from our closest nonhuman relatives (Chou et al., 2002) . 9-O-Ac-sialoglycans occur in both human and mouse and apparently are expressed in a well-coordinated cell-and tissue-specific fashion. There are species differences in tissue distribution of distinct 9-O-Ac-Sias, and, in general, these sugars are more widely and abundantly present in the mouse. More importantly, however, in several key organs and tissues, particularly in the brain, mice and humans share highly similar 9-O-Ac-Sia expression profiles, suggestive of evolutionary and functional conservation.",

The challenge ahead will be to answer the many questions raised by present observations. For example, how is O-acetylation of Sias regulated at the level of individual cells? What are the cues to activate or inactivate the cellular SOATs and SOAEs to establish, maintain, and alter a particular cell (surface) sialylation profile? Which enzymes and signaling pathways are involved? Which glycoconjugates are decorated with O-Ac-Sias? How does Sia-O-acetylation and the regulation thereof relate to cell function? Are there, for example, functional differences between Purkinje cell populations that express O-Ac-Sias and those that do not, and why is there a preference for expression of LUN-rather than P4type Sias in these neurons? The resources and methodology described here will help to settle these outstanding issues. Moreover, our understanding of the molecular basis of ligand and substrate recognition by nidovirus HEs may allow the construction of designer lectins and enzymes of even higher affinity and more narrow specificity to further facilitate such studies.",

Wells positive for hemagglutination are encircled. (B) Nidovirus HEs bind to O-Ac-Sias in BSM with widely different affinities. Lectins (in 2-fold serial dilutions, starting at 0.1 mg/ml) were compared by sp-LBA for relative binding to BSM (OD450 value for 0.1 mg/ml PToV-P4 HE 0 -Fc set at 100%). Data presented as mean \u00b1 SD. Descending concentrations of HE 0 -Fc virolectins, plotted on the x axis, are schematically indicated by black descending triangles. (C) sp-LBA with BSM, after on-the-plate depletion for distinct O-Ac-Sia populations with BCoV-Mebus, BToV-Breda, or PToV-P4 HE + -Fc. Receptor destruction was assessed by sp-LBA with BCoV-Mebus or PToV-P4 HE 0 -Fc at fixed concentrations (5 ng/ml and 1 ng/ml, respectively).
