The microarray was designed to detect a large number of viral and bacterial pathogens, as well as key pathogenic determinants, such as antibiotic resistance genes and genes implicated in toxin production and virulence. The pathogen microarray can identify the majority of the bacteria and viruses on the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) priority pathogen list, as well as many other major human pathogens, by means of hybridization-based DNA resequencing technology within the context of the overall assay depicted in Fig. S1 .1. Table S1 .1 lists the types of genetic elements tiled on the array, and Table S1 .2 provides a list of the species tiled on the pathogen microarray. Some unusual species, such as Deinococcus radiodurans, were included for array testing purposes.",

The design accounts for the variation in sequence where it is known through one of five mechanisms: the resequencing property of the chip, overlapping sequences, conserved regions, and diverged regions, and redundancy. The resequencing property mentioned in the previous paragraph naturally detects well-spaced SNPs, so smaller variations in sequence will automatically be characterized. In regions where variation exceeds the chip's resequencing ablity or when the sequence is especially important, we include overlapping sequences representing the sequence variation. For genes in which only a select portion is included, the conserved region is selected when characterizing the variation is not useful. When knowing the variation is important as in the case of strain identification, more divergent regions may be selected. Finally, the chip may not be able to characterize all of the sequence because of low input levels of target or unknown sequence variation, so the design has a significant level of redundancy. For example, even if a large fraction of the bases for a 16S genes do not produce base calls, BLAST may still permit unambiguous identification based on available sequence.",

The call rate is the number of bases called (non-N bases) divided by the total number of bases. The accuracy of the base calls is principally controlled by the Quality Score Threshold (QST) parameter of GSEQ, which represents the minimum difference in the log likelihoods of the most likely model and the first runner up; if the QST cannot be met, the base call is N. QST controls the tradeoff between call rate and accuracy. GSEQ has a default value of 12 for QST, but this value was reduced to 8. This reduction of QST increases the call rate and provides more sequence for input into the BLAST analysis helping with identification. The reduction of QST may also decrease accuracy of the calls, but the BLAST analysis helps to manage the loss in accuracy.",

S. aureus and its genetic elements can be successfully identified when of the amount of DNA ranges from 0.1 \u00b5g to 10 \u00b5g. At extremely low concentrations, the results are more gene-dependent. The presence of a fixed quantity of human DNA (10 \u00b5g) had no significant effect on the call rate or on the BLAST score for the various S. aureus genes except when very low quantities of DNA were used (0.05 \u00b5g, data not shown). The titration curves for the VSV polymerase gene are similar except that the threshold is 0.5 \u00b5g, above which the call rate does not vary; in addition, the presence of 10 \u00b5g of S. aureus DNA does not affect the identification of VSV (Fig. S1.4) .",

The S. aureus was ATCC 700699D-5 Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus (Mu 50), which has a known sequence, so we could determine the accuracy. The S. aureus genomes are mixed with sufficient human DNA so that a total of 10ng of total DNA is amplified. Although the detection limit varies for different genes, S. aureus can be detected on a background of human DNA with as little as ~3000 genome copies. Figure S1 .7 shows the call rates and accuracies for a set of S. aureus genes during a similar mass titration. In this case, the indicated number of S. aureus genome copies were amplified alone without human DNA. The ability to detect some genes extends down to the single genome copy level, but the results are somewhat stochastic at the lowest masses due to uncertainty in whether a given gene actually is amplified. The microarray requires an approximately picomolar concentration of S. aureus DNA in the hybridization mixture to attain detection using existing analytical methods.",

A complex mixture containing VSV, Dengue Type 2 virus, a multiresistant strain of S. aureus, and human genomic DNA, was analysed in order to test the discriminatory power of the microarray. The ability to detect these three pathogens and the S. aureus resistance genes had previously been tested individually (data not shown) as well as in the following mixtures: S. aureus and human genome (10 \u00b5g of each); VSV and Dengue Type 2 virus (4 \u00b5g of each); and S. aureus and VSV (10 ug and 4 ug, respectively). In each case, the call rate, matching score, and BLAST results did not differ significantly in the mixture from their individual test. In the mixture, S. aureus and VSV had call rates >95%. The call rate for Dengue virus was only 31.65% (Table S1 .5). The call rate for Dengue virus is low compared to the other pathogens; however, its call rate was also low when tested individually, and the called bases were sufficient for a global BLAST analysis to unambiguously identify the Dengue virus. The presence of human DNA had no influence on the results. The negative controls used (vanA for S. aureus, PV virus for VSV and Yellow Fever virus for Dengue) confirmed that there was no cross hybridization between closely related viruses or between antibiotic resistance genes. The pathogen microarray thus allowed several different pathogens and their genetic elements to be identified from a complex mixture in the presence of human DNA with a very high level of confidence.",
