Further, it was troublesome to generate the nitrene or carbene species. Recently, Jubault and co-workers reported Et 2 Zn-promoted reactions of 1 with ketone in the presence of N,N-dimethylaminoethanol as an additive to give fluorinated glycidic esters via common Darzens reaction. 9 Our previous results 6 stimulated us to examine the Reformatsky-type aza-Darzens reaction of 1 with imines (2) in order to obtain 2-fluoroaziridine-2-carboxylate (4) selectively (Scheme 2).

Further, it was troublesome to generate the nitrene or carbene species. Recently, Jubault and co-workers reported Et 2 Zn-promoted reactions of 1 with ketone in the presence of N,N-dimethylaminoethanol as an additive to give fluorinated glycidic esters via common Darzens reaction. 9 Our previous results 6 stimulated us to examine the Reformatsky-type aza-Darzens reaction of 1 with imines (2) in order to obtain 2-fluoroaziridine-2-carboxylate (4) selectively (Scheme 2). In this report, we wish to describe our recent results on the Zn-mediated chemo-and stereoselective formation of 4 by adjusting the reaction condition.",

The imines from aromatic aldehydes gave the corresponding 2-fluoroaziridine-2-carboxylates in excellent yields regardless of the substituents on the phenyl ring (entries 1\u00c06). In the cases of aliphatic aldimine (2g) and ketimine (2h), the corresponding fluoroaziridine products were not observed by 19 F NMR spectroscopy (entries 7 and 8). The substituents on the nitrogen (R 1 ) did not affect this reaction essentially (entries 9\u00c012). In the case of imine (2j), the product was obtained in low yield probably due to the bulkiness of the N-substituent. The yield of 4j was improved by prolongation of the reaction time (entry 11). In all cases, the products (4) were obtained with high and similar diastereoselectivities.",

Recently, we reported the tentative mechanism for the formation of a-bromo-a-fluoro-b-lactams by Et 2 Zn-promoted Reformatsky-type reaction of 1 with imine in Et 2 O. 6 There, chemo-and diastereoselective formation of 3a was achieved by the addition of stable (Z)-zinc bromofluoroenolate (6) to imine, where low coordination power of Et 2 O makes the generation of chair-like transition state favorable. Intramolecular cyclization of intermediate (7) to ester carbonyl group was promoted by the intramolecular coordination of zinc to carbonyl moiety to give 3a. 6 On the other hand, the strongly coordinating solvent, CH 3 CN, could coordinate with Zn of the enolate 8 leading to reversible equilibrium of E/Z isomer of 8. And also the coordination could destroy the chair-like transition state to give another open-chain transition state (TS-1-TS-4). The Reformatsky adduct (9) gave the aziridine ring 4a via aza-Darzens-type intramolecular cyclization, where coordination of sol- vent to Zn of 9 seemed to disturb the activation of ester carbonyl moiety. This assumption was supported that the mixture of 3a and 4a was obtained by the reaction of 1 with imine (2a) using Et 2 Zn and Et 2 O as a solvent in the presence of PPh 3 which must be a better monovalent ligand than CH 3 CN. 13 In this transition model, the syn isomer is obtained mainly from TS-1, in which there is little steric repulsion. On the other hand, other transition states (TS-2-TS-4) have some steric repulsion between bromine and phenyl group and between phenyl group and the other functional group. Z-8 used for TS-1 might be provided from equilibrium of E-8 and Z-8. As a result, the selective generation of syn isomer was achieved by dynamic kinetic resolution.",

The reaction was quenched with saturated aqueous NaHCO 3 , and the mixture was filtered through Celite pad. The filtrate was extracted with AcOEt, and then the extract was washed with brine and dried over MgSO 4 . The solvent was removed in vacuo without heating and the residue was purified by column chromatography (SiO 2 , AcOEt/hexane = 5:95) to give the corresponding 2-fluoroaziridine-2-carboxylate (4a). The chemical yield was obtained from 19 F NMR of the crude mixture; benzotrifluoride (BTF) was used as an internal standard. 12.
