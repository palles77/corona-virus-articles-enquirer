Current antiviral therapy offers limited success in treating severe influenza infection with both H1N1 and H5N1 viruses. We evaluated the effect of a neuraminidase inhibitor in combination with immunomodulatory drugs in vitro and in a mouse model of influenza A H1N1 infection by determining survival rate, lung inflammation markers and histopathology. Sertraline and rolipram significantly improved survival in mice infected with a lethal dose of influenza A H1N1 virus. Prophylactic treatment resulted in survival rates of 40% (rolipram), 30% (oseltamivir), 0% (sertraline), 100% (rolipram/oseltamivir) and 70% (sertraline/oseltamivir). Treatment in a therapeutic setting (24 h post-infection) resulted in 80% (rolipram/oseltamivir) and 40% (sertraline/oseltamivir) survival. Sertraline and rolipram had no effect on virus replication in vitro and in vivo, but significantly reduced lung inflammation. A significant reduction in cellular infiltration (10-fold) along with inflammatory cytokines monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (10-fold), interleukin-6 (5-fold) and regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (5-fold) was observed in the animals treated with the combination compared to oseltamivir alone. Lung histopathology of mice treated with combinations revealed significantly reduced consolidation, infiltration and alveolitis compared to oseltamivir alone. Rolipram and sertraline reduced H1N1 virus-induced lung inflammation and mortality. These data support further development of immunomodulatory agents for severe influenza.",

            "text": "The majority of influenza A infections are subclinical and controlled by innate and adaptive immune responses. Severe disease is associated with a direct virus-mediated cytopathic effect in the alveolar epithelium, resulting in excessive and dysregulated immune responses leading to extensive lung inflammation and pathology. 6 A direct correlation between viral titers, local and systemic cytokine responses, and symptoms in patients suffering from mild seasonal influenza suggests that host innate immune responses contribute to the clinical symptoms of mild influenza. 7 Inflammatory cell infiltrates in pulmonary tissues together with direct virus-mediated cytopathic effects create airway congestion, impair gas exchange and precipitate acute respiratory distress syndrome. 8 Experimental influenza virus infection in humans has confirmed these findings, showing increased concentration of several inflammatory mediators including interleukin (IL)-6, tumor-necrosis factor-a, interferon-a and IL-8 in nasopharyngeal lavage fluids in volunteers infected with H1N1 virus. 9 Patients with severe and fatal human infections with the H1N1pdm virus have higher pro-inflammatory responses early in the illness, although viral load in the nasopharynx appears to be similar. 10 Severe and fatal H5N1 disease in humans is associated with higher viral load as well as enhanced pro-inflammatory responses. Pathogenic viruses such as avian H5N1 have an intrinsic capacity for eliciting enhanced innate immune responses in primary human macrophages and alveolar epithelial cells in vitro. 11 The role of inflammatory response in the pathogenesis of severe lung disease in macaques infected with avian influenza H5N1 or 1918 H1N1 viruses has been documented. 12 Although mice with defects in individual cytokine or chemokine pathways or steroid-treated wild-type mice do not have a survival advantage over wild-type mice after viral challenge, 13 mice lacking both tumor-necrosis factor and IL-1 receptors have reduced morbidity and delayed mortality. 14 Proof-of-concept for the development of anti-inflammatory drugs for treatment of infectious diseases has recently been presented in the context of influenza, dengue and polymicrobial sepsis. 15 There has been increasing attention to the role of immunomodulatory interventions as adjunctive therapy for influenza 16 because the outcome of influenza virus infection is determined by both viral and host factors. Many studies have investigated the efficacy of therapeutic strategies that target the host in combination with conventional antiviral therapy. 17 Approved immunomodulatory drugs and clinically used molecules are particularly attractive approaches due to their known safety profile. Current standard-of-care drugs for influenza virus infection include the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir, which inhibit viral replication but have no direct effect on underlying inflammation. Although antiviral therapy improves clinical outcome of patients with zoonotic H5N1 virus disease, even early (first 4 days of illness) oseltamivir treatment does not address unacceptable mortality rates. 18 Novel drugs that attenuate severity by downmodulating the inflammatory response to be used in conjunction with neuraminidase inhibitors would constitute a significant improvement in the therapeutic armamentarium against seasonal and pandemic influenza. Early attempts to use anti-inflammatory doses of to control excessive inflammation in severe H5N1 or other acute respiratory infections like severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus were associated with severe side effects without any improvement in survival. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] Patients treated with moderate doses of statins have reduced risk of death from influenza A, suggesting that a decrease in inflammatory response may account for protection against severe infection. 15 However, this study has limitations as it was carried out retrospectively without placebo control. Combinations of the neuraminidase inhibitor zanamivir and anti-inflammatory compounds (celecoxib and mesalazine) increased the survival of mice infected with a highly pathogenic strain of influenza A/H5N1 virus. 20 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and phospsphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor, have been shown to exert immunomodulatory activity in vivo. In particular, the PDE inhibitor rolipram and sertraline have proven anti-inflammatory/ immunomodulatory properties in preclinical and clinical studies, 21, 22 but their effect on influenza A virus infection is unknown.",

Drug administration continued for 5 days twice daily. The oseltamivir dose used in this study (10 mg/kg/day) was equivalent to the human dose based on its active metabolite exposure. Mice in the vehicle-treated group started dying from day 7 and by day 9, all animals had succumbed to infection. There was 30% overall survival in Anti-inflammatory drugs to treat influenza A (H1N1) infection G Sharma et al 3 the oseltamivir group on day 21 and an increase in mean days to death from 9 to 13 was observed when compared with controls. Sertraline did not demonstrate any significant effect on mortality or survival time when used alone. However, in the oseltamivir and sertraline combination group, the survival rate was 70% on day 21 (P,0.05 when compared with the oseltamivir group through Mantel-Cox test, Figure 2A ). Although no significant difference in body weight was observed between the groups ( Figure 2B ), significant increase in the mean days to death from 13 to 18 was observed in the combination group as compared to oseltamivir alone through Mantel-Cox test (P,0.01) ( Figure 2C ). Rolipram as a single agent resulted in 40% survival on day 21, while survival in the oseltamivir combination group was 100% (P,0.01 when compared with oseltamivir alone through Mantel-Cox test).

            "text": "PDE4 inhibitors are currently under development for the treatment of respiratory diseases including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 30, 31 The rationale for the development of this drug class stems from the understanding of the role of PDE4 in suppressing the function of a range of inflammatory and resident cells thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of these diseases. PDEs are a family of enzymes responsible for the metabolism of the intracellular second messenger's cyclic adenosin monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate. PDE4 is a cAMP-specific PDE that is the major if not sole cAMP-metabolizing enzyme found in inflammatory and immune cells and contributes significantly to cAMP metabolism in smooth muscles. Based on its cellular and tissue distribution and the demonstration that selective inhibitors of this isozyme reduce bronchoconstriction in animals and suppress the activation of inflammatory cells, PDE4 has become an important molecular target for the development of novel therapies for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Numerous preclinical in vivo studies have shown that PDE4 inhibitors suppress characteristic features of these diseases, namely, cell recruitment, activation of inflammatory cells and physiological changes in lung function in response to a range of airway insults. These potentially beneficial actions of PDE4 inhibitors have been successfully translated in clinical trials with roflumilast and cilomilast in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 32,33 PDE4 inhibitors are being developed for airway diseases; therefore, these drugs are selected to achieve high lung levels; a desirable pharmacological property for therapeutics intended to be used in respiratory infections. A significant decrease in the inflammatory biomarkers was also observed, which is in agreement with the mechanism of action of these compounds. Rolipram has also been demonstrated to attenuate respiratory syncytial virus-induced airway hyper-responsiveness and lung eosinophilia. 21 Our data show that anti-inflammatory drugs belonging to the SSRI and PDE4 classes improve morbidity and mortality of severe influenza in a mouse model when used in combination with the antiviral drug oseltamivir. Rolipram/oseltamivir combination achieved 100% protection in Anti-inflammatory drugs to treat influenza A (H1N1) infection G Sharma et al 7 treated animals in a prophylactic setting and 80% in a therapeutic setting. A significant 40% survival rate could still be achieved by rolipram alone, underscoring the superiority of the PDE4 inhibitor over sertraline.",

Oseltamivir at a dose of 10 mg/kg, which was equivalent to the human dose based on its active metabolite exposure, reduced lung viral load by up to 10-fold. Oseltamivir-dependent lung viral titer reductions in experimental animals vary significantly according to the virus strain, oseltamivir dose and animal model used. 34, 35 The mouse model used here and lung viral load reduction seen in our study are consistent with previous data from Sidwell and Smee. 36 We demonstrate that the beneficial effects in survival and lung pathology observed in the combination group can be attributed to the reduction in inflammatory responses. The significant decrease in inflammatory biomarkers compared to that with oseltamivir alone correlates positively with reduced lung inflammatory lesions and mortality and increased survival time seen in mice treated with rolipram or sertraline and their combinations with oseltamivir.",
