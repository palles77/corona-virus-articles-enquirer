            "text": "Bronchiolitis is considered as the most frequent lower respiratory tract infection in infants and young children. This disorder is marked by acute inflammation, edema, and damage of epithelial cells lining small airways, and augmentation of mucus production. 1 Young patients usually present with cough and rhinitis, with the possibility of advancing to wheezing, tachypnea, rales, increased use of accessory muscles, and/ or nasal flaring. The most commonly detected virus in bronchiolitis is the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), with the peak incidence of infection taking place in the period of December till March. 2 Nearly all children get an RSV infection by the time they are 2 years old, but only 1-2% of infants younger than 6 months of age may require hospitalization. 3 Due to the high prevalence, RSV infections inflict considerably economic hardship on families and health care systems. 4, 5 In the Middle East, RSV bronchiolitis is a very common disease, [6] [7] [8] constituting almost 60% of all children hospitalization in the State of Qatar. 6 Regardless of risk factors, all infants and young children have the chance of acquiring serious illness by RSV. A large study conducted by Hall et al 9 showed that most RSV-infected young patients who had been hospitalized for RSV bronchiolitis had been healthy with no risk factors.",

            "text": "Some respiratory viruses have a predictable seasonality, which varies regionally. For example, in the USA and other parts of the world with similar climates, RSV affects children during fall, winter, and spring. 3 Previous studies have shown that RSV infection in the tropics is more common in the rainy season. [10] [11] [12] The reason for such seasonality is not well known yet, but atmospheric factors such as high humidity and temperature may assist virus survival in small particle droplets or aerosols, and on infected surfaces. Other factors that might affect seasonality are crowdedness such as initiation of school term. 12 The State of Qatar is situated in the Asian continent with absolute location of 25.3000\u00b0 N and 51.5333\u00b0 E. It is a peninsula bordering, terrestrially, Saudi Arabia. The maritime boundaries include Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, and Iran. 13 Qatar has a hot desert climate. The temperature typically varies from 14\u00b0C to 41\u00b0C. The warm season starts around May 10 and ends approximately September 26 with an average daily high temperature above 37\u00b0C. The cold season commences in early December and ends in early March with an average daily high temperature below 25\u00b0C. The chance of precipitation is 1% during the warm season and almost 15% during the cold season. In terms of humidity, it usually ranges from 18% to 94%. 14 The aim of our study was to identify agents triggering bronchiolitis in the State of Qatar, and to describe the seasonality of viral bronchiolitis in hospitalized infants and young children in the State of Qatar.",

The identification of the patient population was obtained from an advanced search in the HMC medical records database. The search comprised diagnosis of bronchiolitis (primary diagnosis) in patients 24 months of age and under. The diagnosis of bronchiolitis was based on the definition suggested by the American Academy of Pediatrics, subcommittee on diagnosis and management of bronchiolitis. 1 Our young patients met the criteria of bronchiolitis as documented in the patients' files. We excluded children who did not have virology testing from their nasopharyngeal secretions, and those whose primary diagnosis was a disease other than bronchiolitis.",

In addition, the mean LOS due to RSV was found to be 8 days, which almost double the days required for young children with H1N1 bronchiolitis to be discharged from our medical institution. This could be perhaps attributed to the use of the H1N1 vaccine on most children as well as medications such oseltamivir for acute infections. In the developed countries, the mean LOS in children hospitalized with bronchiolitis is 6 days. The USA mean average is 4 days, while Germany reports 9 days. 15 Our results are comparable to that of West Europe. Seasonality of RSV varies according to the geographical location. For instance, in Turkey (Northern Hemisphere), the peak RSV season starts in January and ends in May, coinciding with the cold season. 16 In countries that are in the southern hemisphere, like Argentina, the RSV peak season lies between June and September. 17 In Artic areas, like Alaska, the RSV peak season starts in late December and lasts for ~11 weeks. 18 Yusuf et al 19 conducted a study on the relationship of meteorological conditions to the epidemic RSV activity in the USA. The investigators registered year-round RSV activity in nine major cities that differ significantly in weather and geographic location.

The percentage of specimens positive for RSV by antigen detection attained a season high of 26.2% during the week ending January 28, 2012. States that had hot summers such as Arizona and New Mexico did not differ much from the national average RSV season. 20 In warm equatorial areas, RSV infection is uninterrupted throughout the year. 21, 22 There are no studies that describe RSV seasonality in Qatar, but there are few studies in our geographical area that investigated the cyclical divergence of RSV bronchiolitis. In Saudi Arabia, the RSV peak activity is reported to be in late fall and the beginning of the winter season where the humidity is less than 48% and temperature ranges from 14\u00b0C to 21\u00b0C. 19, 23 Another study by Uduman et al, 24 from Al Ain, United Arab Emirates, investigated 252 children younger than 3 years admitted to the hospital with moderate-to-severe respiratory disorders during the winter seasons of 1993-1994 and 1994-1995. The clinical arrangement of RSV illness included bronchiolitis in 58.3% of cases. The study demonstrated that the RSV incidence was maximum during the cooler months (temperature 10\u00b0C-20\u00b0C) when the relative humidity was 50%-60%, even though it was also noticed in substantial numbers during the hotter summer months.",

Moreover, we used PCR-based detection techniques to identify respiratory viruses, and therefore our results hold an accurate estimate of the RSV epidemiology in our country. However, our study has some limitations. For instance, our study design methodology might not be perfect. Usually, there is a selection bias when conducting a retrospective study, which bears the consequences of over-or underestimating the true incidence of the disease. Furthermore, not all children with respiratory symptoms had nasopharyngeal samples sent for virology PCR. Finally, our study was conducted on sick children admitted to the pediatric wards. Therefore, we could have missed a proportion of cases that are usually handled as outpatient, and the virology profile could represent the sick kids, but not what is happening in the community.",

            "text": "from Amman, Jordan, studied children younger than 2 years hospitalized with respiratory illness in the pediatric ward, from the period of September 2002 to March 2004. A total of 200 nasopharyngeal aspirates was acquired and RSV was demonstrated in 12.5% of patients using direct immunofluorescence technique. Most of the infections were linked with bronchiolitis. RSV showed an obvious seasonal cycle. The epidemic started in December and vanished in March with a peak of incidence during February 2003 and January 2004. Halasa et al, 25 also from Jordan, surveyed 3,168 children with respiratory symptoms and/or fever at the Al-Bashir Government Hospital, of whom more than 80% tested positive for RSV. The study that took place between the period of 2010 and 2013 showed that RSV infections and hospitalizations peaked in January and February. Thamer and Ban, 26 from Tikrit, Iraq, investigated the epidemiology of acute respiratory tract infections among children under 5 years old attending Tikrit General Teaching Hospital from the first of November 2004 to the end of April 2005. The sample that included 2,450 children showed that December was the month with the highest frequency of RSV infection (31%), followed by January (20%), November (19%), February (15%), March (9%), and April (6%). Dede et al 27 studied RSV infections in the arid desert regions of Central Australia. The investigation included 173 children younger than 24 months admitted to Alice Springs Hospital with RSV infection over a period of 5 years (2000-2004). The authors concluded that RSV-related infections peaked in the winter season, but illnesses occurred throughout the year.",
