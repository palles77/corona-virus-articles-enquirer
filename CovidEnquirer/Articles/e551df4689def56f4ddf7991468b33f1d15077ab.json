This information is essential for developing inter ventions for reducing the risk of transmission and developing eff ective control measures. During the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) epidemic between Nov, 2002, and July, 2003, molecular analysis of SARS-CoV from patients from various geographical regions was essential for understanding viral evolution and the spread of the disease. 3 Phylogenetic analysis suggested that SARS-CoV probably originated in bats and spread to people. A genetic link between the SARS-CoV in people and in civets revealed cross-host evolution. 4 There is currently little information about the molecular evolution of MERS-CoV and how this relates to virus transmission. The cellular receptor for MERS-CoV has been identifi ed as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, CD26) 5 and the structure of the receptor binding domain of the virus spike protein complexed with DPP4 has been established. 6 The tissue distribution of this receptor within mammals is consistent with the lung and kidney pathology of the virus. 5 The conservation of the receptor across mammals suggests many possible non-human hosts; however, so far no animal reservoir has been identifi ed for MERS-CoV. The closest relative to MERS-CoV was identifi ed through phylogenetic analysis of a short fragment sequenced from the bat species Neoromicia zuluensis. 7 However, in view of the estimated evolutionary rate of MERS-CoV, the most recent common ancestor between this isolate and MERS-CoV existed in bats more than 44 years ago. 8 A recent serological study of dromedary camels in Oman and the Canary Islands found cross-reactive antibodies to MERS-CoV, but the investigators were unable to amplify any MERS-CoV-like viral sequences from the samples. 9 A small fragment of sequence identical to the EMC/2012 MERS-CoV has been reported from a Taphozous perforatus bat captured in Saudi Arabia, suggesting a regionally relevant bat reservoir. 10 Genomic sequencing of MERS-CoV is important, and molecular epidemiology can reveal spatiotemporal patterns that help identify whether all MERS-CoV infections originated from a single zoonotic event, with subsequent human-to-human transmission, or from many zoonotic events at several geographic locations. This information is crucial for an accurate assessment of the epidemic potential of MERS-CoV. 11 In addition to confi rming diagnosis, generating sequence data directly from epidemiologically defi ned cases provides the essential basis for defi ning the spread, evolution, and origin of ",

PCR amplifi ed DNA amplicons covering the entire MERS-CoV genome were prepared as described elsewhere. 14 The PCR amplicons for each sample were pooled for Illumina library (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) preparation with each sample processed to include a unique barcode sequence. Standard MiSeq 150 base pair paired-end reads were generated. Sequence data were de-multiplexed into sample-specifi c readsets, processed to remove primer sequences at the ends of reads, and trimmed from their 3\u02b9 end until the median phred-scaled quality score was >35\u00b70, discarding reads smaller than 125 nucleotides. The processed readsets were assembled into large contiguous sequences (contigs) using the de-novo assembler SPAdes. 15 The readset was also mapped against the Al-Hasa_1_2013 genome (GenBank accession number KF186567 16 ) using SMALT (version 0.5.0) to generate a reference-based consensus. In cases where the de-novo assembly was split over several contigs, they were aligned against the reference-based consensus before merging. Any diff erences between de-novo and reference-based methods were resolved by direct examination of the original read set.",

The tightly-linked Al-Hasa cluster was collapsed to a representative isolate (Al-Hasa_2_2013) along with the Al-Hasa_8_2013 isolate that was determined to be epidemiologically unrelated (fi gure 4, table 2). Geographical locations of the ancestral viruses were co-estimated along with the phylogeny, to assess the spatial evolution of the virus. These results suggest the circulating virus in Saudi Arabia is centred around Riyadh, with sporadic excursions to other centres; the most probable geographical location for all of the internal nodes, except for the Al-Hasa outbreak, is in Riyadh (fi gure 3). However, with the exception of the ancestor to the Al-Hasa outbreak, the posterior probability on these ancestral geographical locations is low, highlighting the degree of uncertainty on these inferred locations. The number of isolates for each location is small, with only Riyadh and Al-Hasa having more than one isolate. Because the two Al-Hasa isolates cluster together, the positioning of Riyadh along the internal branches could be due to it being the only location present at many distinct positions in the topology.

Our data suggest that local spread of virus in the Al-Hasa outbreak might be more complex than previously thought, with additional sources of the virus contributing to hitherto human-to-human transmission chains. This is consistent with the multiple tree clusters described by Breban and colleagues 11 and support their optimistic R 0 scenario for MERS-CoV.",

There is little information about the molecular evolution of MERS-CoV and how this relates to virus transmission. MERS-CoV genomes obtained directly from 21 MERS patients from across Saudi Arabia show three distinct MERS-CoV genotypes in Riyadh. Phylogeographic analyses suggest the MERS-CoV zoonotic reservoir is geographically disperse. Selection analysis of the MERS-CoV genomes reveals the expected accumulation of genetic diversity including changes in the S protein. Multiple introductions of MERS-CoV were identifi ed and suggest lower R 0 values. MERS-CoV is evolving within the largely human-to-human Al-Hasa cluster but the phenotypic consequences of these variants needs assessment before adaption can be inferred. Transmission within Saudi Arabia seems consistent with either movement of an animal reservoir, animal products, or movement of infected people. Our results provide important and substantial genomic information on MERS-CoV and a direction for further investigation. That there were three genetically distinct lineages of MERS-CoV in Riyadh suggests it is unlikely that the Riyadh infections are the result of one, continuous human-to-human transmission chain. Further defi nition of the exposures responsible for the sporadic introductions of MERS-CoV into human populations is urgently needed to provide the necessary information to interrupt transmission and contain the virus. that a single zoonotic event was the source of the epidemic. Such high local diversity could arise from zoonotic events in Riyadh if the MERS-CoV diversity in the animal reservoir is being continuously imported from other regions. Alternately, Riyadh is the largest population centre in Saudi Arabia and therefore the largest target for human-to-human transmission. The many circulating genotypes might be a consequence of the movement of infected people from other regions, this is supported by Riyadh_1_2012 clustering with Bisha_1_2012 and Riyadh_3-2013 clustering with viruses from Doha (England_Qatar_2012) and Abu Dhabi (Munich/AbuDhabi), the two largest urban centres in neighbouring countries (fi gure 6).",

Analyses using short sequences suggest that the MERS-CoV virus might have an ancestor in bats. 7, 10, 14, 26 Using the evolutionary rate from our study we show a substantial period since these viruses shared a common ancestor, suggesting that there might be an intermediary host as the source of human infections. MERS-CoV has not yet been identifi ed in any animal sources. Therefore fi eld studies of all probable reservoir species, including camels, bats, goats, sheep, dogs, cats, rodents, and others in Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries are ongoing. A history of contact of Saudi Arabian MERS-CoV patients with camels and goats has been reported in some cases. Serological testing for MERS-CoV has detected antibodies to the virus in camels in Oman and the Canary Islands 9 suggesting that a virus that stimulates antibody responses cross-reactive with MERS-CoV has been recently circu lating among camels; however, the only way to establish if the virus eliciting the antibody response is the same as human MERS-CoV is to isolate the MERS-CoV itself in a camel. Further, the recent reports of mild and asympto matic cases discovered through monitoring and testing of contacts of confi rmed cases suggest that the focus on severe disease as a surveillance strategy might be missing substantial numbers of milder or asymptomatic cases.",
