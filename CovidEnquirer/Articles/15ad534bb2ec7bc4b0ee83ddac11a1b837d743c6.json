The 58 main source of infection is pneumonia patients infected by new coronavirus. Respiratory droplets 59 are the main route of transmission and it can also be transmitted through contact. People are 60 generally susceptible. At present, the occurrence, development, mechanism of prognosis and 61 immune status of patients with 2019-nCoV are still unclear. 1 This study intends to detect the 62 peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets and cytokines in 123 patients with 2019-nCoV infection by 63 using four-color immunoflow cytometry and multiple microsphere flow immunofluorescence to 64 investigate the cellular immunity status and cytokine levels of 2019-nCoV infected patients, to 65 explore the correlation between cellular immune statuses, cytokine levels and the severity of 2019-66 nCoV infection. 67 Materials and Methods 68 Patients 69 From January 26, 2019 to February 4, 2020, 123 inpatients diagnosed with 2019-nCoV 70 infection were collected in the Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital. All patients were 71 confirmed to be positive for new coronavirus nucleic acid by real-time fluorescent RT-PCR. Patients 72",

The results of this study indicated 180 that 21 patients in the severe group had IL-4, IL-10, IL-17, and TNF within normal values. TNF and 181 IFN mainly secreted by Th1 cells and NK cells were not significantly different between the mild 182 and severe groups. In the mild group, 55.88% of the patients had IL-6 detection value of 0, and 183 30.39% of the patients had IL-6 detection value higher than the normal value. The reason remains 184 to be elucidated, which may be related to the inhibition of Th2 cells involved in humoral immunity 185 in the early stage of infection. However, the proportion of IL-6 above normal was 76.19% in the 186 severe group, which was significantly higher than that in the mild group. This is in line with the 187 concept of \"Cytokine Storm\", which must be experienced by patients with mild illness to become188 severe, emphasized by Lanjuan Li, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering. In 189 addition, in the course of diagnosis and treatment, the Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital 190 noticed that monitoring the changes of cytokines during the treatment process is of certain 191 significance to optimize the treatment plan and predict the outcome of the disease.192",
