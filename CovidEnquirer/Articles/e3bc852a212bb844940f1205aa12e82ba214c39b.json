            "text": "Feline orofacial pain syndrome (FOPS) is a pain disorder of cats with behavioural signs of oral discomfort and tongue mutilation. This report describes the findings from a case series of 113 cats including 100 Burmese. FOPS is suspected to be a neuropathic pain disorder and the predominance within the Burmese cat breed suggests an inherited disorder, possibly involving central and/or ganglion processing of sensory trigeminal information. The disease is characterised by an episodic, typically unilateral, discomfort with pain-free intervals. The discomfort is triggered, in many cases, by mouth movements. The disease is often recurrent and with time may become unremitting e 12% of cases in this series were euthanased as a consequence of the condition. Sensitisation of trigeminal nerve endings as a consequence of oral disease or tooth eruption appears to be an important factor in the aetiology e 63% of cases had a history of oral lesions and at least 16% experienced their first sign of discomfort during eruption of permanent teeth. External factors can also influence the disease as FOPS events could be directly linked to a situation causing anxiety in 20% of cats. FOPS can be resistant to traditional analgesics and in some cases successful management required anti-convulsants with an analgesic effect. F eline orofacial pain syndrome (FOPS) is a condition characterised by signs of acute oral discomfort and mutilation. It was first recognised in the early 1990s 1 and has been described predominantly in Burmese cats. 2 Affected cats are most commonly presented with exaggerated licking and chewing movements, and pawing at the mouth. More severe cases have mutilation of tongue, lips and buccal mucosa (Figs 1 and 2) . Neurological examination of affected cats is unremarkable; in particular there are no apparent motor or sensory trigeminal deficits. Discomfort appears to be confined to one side of the oral cavity and lips. 3 The cat remains alert and can be distracted, although with considerable difficulty in some cases. 3 The cat may be anorexic/ unwilling to eat. Diagnosis is by elimination of other causes of oral pain or trigeminal nerve dysfunction. Preliminary studies have suggested oral lesions and environmental stress can precipitate the condition and the authors have previously hypothesised that the disease is most likely a neuropathic pain disorder analogous to trigeminal neuralgia and/or glossodynia in humans. 3 The discomfort appears to be relieved by anti-epileptic drugs, speculated to be because of their allodynic rather than anti-convulsant effect. In this retrospective study, clinical details of 113 cats diagnosed with FOPS were collated and reviewed with the objective of better understanding the syndrome and with the aims of suggesting what management regimes were more likely to be effective and identifying which factors should be further investigated.",

The colour of the Burmese cats was recorded in 67/100 cats and was distributed as follows: 20 brown (30%), 15 lilac (22%), 11 blue (16%), seven chocolate (10%), six red (9%), four cream (6%) three brown tortie (4%), one chocolate tortie (1%). A request was made to the Burmese Cat Club and the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy for details on colour for registered Burmese kittens; however, this information is not available. The mean age of cats was 10.5 years (median 11 years; range 0.5e22 years). Data on age were missing for four cats. There were 50 female cats (two entire, three entire at the time of the first of two or more FOPS episodes but subsequently neutered, and 45 neutered) contrasting with 59 males (five recorded as entire, three entire at the time of the first of two or more FOPS episodes and subsequently neutered, and 51 neutered). This gave an overall female to male ratio A Burmese cat with FOPS. Until discomfort can be controlled, mutilation should be prevented by using an Elizabethan collar and/or paw bandaging. 'Soft claws' (http:// www.spuk.com) are an additional method of controlling self-mutilation. However, the underlying discomfort should also be addressed. Merely preventing the cat from mutilation without attempting to prevent the discomfort is, in the authors' opinion, unethical. Photo courtesy of Judith Cornish-Trestrail and Christine Stalker. A 5-year-old domestic shorthair cat that presented with left sided tongue mutilation. In cases of severe tongue mutilation surgical repair may be required and the cat may also need to be fed via a naso-oesophageal or oesophageal feeding tube until the tongue lesions have healed. In this case the FOPS was thought to be triggered by a fractured upper canine with exposed pulp cavity. The damaged tooth was removed and the pain was managed with a reducing course of gabapentin. of 46:54. A sex predisposition proportion test was not significant (P \u00bc 0.444).

On dental examination with radiographs she was found to have a generalised grade 2 gingivitis (bleeding on probing) with a number of 'missing' teeth and type 1 tooth resorption lesions (Feline TR) on a premolar and molar tooth. In addition, gingival recession and horizontal bone loss were present on oral and radiographic examination in a number of teeth. The cat had an upper incisor root remnant removed and surgical extractions of all cheek teeth distal to the canines. Following this the phenobarbital was successfully withdrawn but the cat had two further episodes of FOPS over the next 15 months. The first was associated with a cat show and responded to meloxicam and the second was associated with a stay in a cattery and was managed with phenobarbital which was has been successfully withdrawn for 3 months. b Case 2: A 10-year-old male neutered Burmese cat that lived in a multi-cat household was presented with severe tongue mutilation. The cat had a history suggesting social incompatibility; 8 days before presentation he had been involved in a fight with another cat and had received minor head skin wounds as a consequence. These subsequently healed and at presentation he had no evidence of skin or dental disease. He was subsequently managed with behavioural modification to deal with social stress. This involved ensuring that the distribution of essential resources, such as food, water, latrines and resting places, was sufficient to allow each cat within the household to have free and immediate access to those resources at all times, without having to interact with another cat. There have been no further episodes of mutilation, however, he continues to have episodes of discomfort which the owner relates to continuing distress from another cat. c Case 3: A 6-year-old female Burmese cat with recurrent facial mutilation with episodes at 5 months old (associated with eruption of permanent teeth) and also at 2, 3, 5 and 6 years old. Signs eventually became persistent and the owner was using a permanent buster collar to prevent mutilation. On removal of the collar, signs of mutilation recurred, usually within minutes, with an apparent trigger of grooming. There were no signs of dental disease, diagnostic tests were normal and she had no behavioural signs of anxiety. She was prescribed phenobarbital at 2 mg/kg twice daily and the dose was increased to 4 mg/kg twice daily to achieve a serum phenobarbital concentration of approximately 120 mmol/l. This controlled clinical signs and after 3 months an attempt was made to wean the phenobarbital. However, signs recurred and it has proved necessary to maintain permanent medication. treatment, however, for nine cats this improvement was not sustained. For a further 11 cats the signs of FOPS were not improved following dental treatment and one cat was worse. For four cats the outcome was not stated. One cat was improved after the first dental procedure and not after subsequent dental therapy. For two cats the clinical signs of FOPS started immediately following dental procedures, having not been present before. Only 1/43 cats was described as having dental disease (gingivitis) but did not have dental treatment. This cat was managed with corticosteroids and was ultimately euthanased.",

Currently there is not enough information to determine the mode of inheritance. Any age of cat can be affected with FOPS and the age at first presentation ranged from 0.1 to 19 years. However, many affected cats first had signs when erupting permanent teeth and these cats often redeveloped the syndrome as mature cats. It is possible that more of the cats were affected as kittens. Several Burmese breeders discussed the condition with the authors and were not only aware of the disease but reported that it was frequently necessary to bandage the paws of kittens whilst teething to prevent severe mutilation.

FOPS does not have the characteristics of a seizure disorder so it is perhaps more likely that the anti-epileptic drugs were effective because FOPS is a condition of neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain is a clinical syndrome of pain due to abnormal somatosensory processing in the peripheral and/or central nervous system (CNS). 4 Unlike physiological and inflammatory pain it serves no beneficial purpose to the animal and can be regarded as a disease in itself. Discomfort ranges from spontaneous pain; paraesthesia (a spontaneous or evoked abnormal but not unpleasant sensation); dysaesthesia (a spontaneous or evoked unpleasant abnormal sensation usually described as burning); allodynia (pain from a stimulus that is not normally painful, eg, touch), or hyperpathia (increased pain from stimuli which are normally painful). Neuralgia is a pain in the distribution of a nerve or nerves and in FOPS the signs suggest discomfort is confined to the oral cavity and lips. The trigeminal nerve provides sensory information for these areas; however, there is no apparent discomfort elsewhere in the trigeminal nerve distribution, eg, nose or eyes. Trigeminal sensory loss is not apparent although the possibility of subtle deficits has not been ruled out especially given the extent of mutilation in some cases. In all cases the discomfort of FOPS was described as unilateral or worse on one side.",

However, it should be considered that there is a high incidence of periodontal disease in the feline population; one study reported an incidence of 72%, with purebred cats being more predisposed, 10 ie, a direct association cannot be proved at this time although anecdotally the signs of FOPS improved in many cases following resolution of the oral lesions.",

Human trigeminal neuralgia is characterised by severe pain in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve, usually the mandibles and/or maxilla. People with this condition describe attacks of pain which typically last only seconds but may occur repeatedly within a short period of time. 11 The attacks are often, but not always, precipitated by mild sensory stimulation of so called trigger zones (allodynia) which may be located anywhere within the territory of the affected trigeminal nerve. Classical antecedent stimuli include light touch, draughts of wind, and facial movement such as eating and drinking. 11 This study found that 33 cats had signs of FOPS triggered by mouth movements including eating, drinking and/or grooming. Other anecdotal triggers were also reported. Human trigeminal neuralgia tends to occur in bouts over a period of weeks or months with subsequent spontaneous remission that may last months or years. Over time however, the attacks usually become more frequent and pain more sustained. 11 In this study 46/113 cats were reported as having ongoing and persistent disease and in 38/46 cats there had been a history of previous recurrent bouts. The prognosis is poorer for this group (P \u00bc 0.047) and 13/46 were euthanased either because of FOPS or because of the effects of medication for FOPS.",

            "text": "A more unusual human facial pain syndrome, part of the spectrum of trigeminal neuralgia, is glossodynia (burning mouth syndrome). 12 This is described as a burning or prickling sensation of the oral mucosa, most commonly at the front of the tongue in the absence of physical abnormalities of the oral mucosa. 13e15 In many of the affected cats, caudal tongue discomfort seems to be the primary problem and many cats were presented with mutilation injuries to the tongue. Unlike typical trigeminal neuralgia the cause of glossodynia is often enigmatic. For trigeminal neuralgia the majority of cases in humans can be shown to be due to demyelination of the trigeminal sensory fibres within the nerve root or brain stem. The most common cause is compression of the CNS nerve root by an overlying artery or vein. 11 Familial trigeminal neuralgia is also described although it is rare. 16e19 By contrast glossodynia is considered to have a multifactorial aetiology and most cases are described as 'idiopathic'. It is often linked to anxiety disorders e although this may be the effect rather that the cause. 13,20e22 Conditions of neuropathic pain can be greatly influenced by many internal and external factors. 23 Examples of external factors include social variables, housing and other external stress factors. Genetic influences on homeostatic adaptation mechanisms to stress may also be important. 23 The current study found that for 24 cats, an FOPS event could be directly linked to a situation causing anxiety. This equates to approximately one in five cats. This figure may be artificially low as anxiety or stress influences on disease are easily overlooked if appropriate questions are not asked during history taking. The most important queries are to ascertain if the five essential feline resources e food, water, resting places, latrines and points of entry and exit into the territory e are appropriately distributed. The cat should also have a private area(s) and the ability to hide and gain access to a high vantage point in order to control anxiety. The most common 'stress' contributing to FOPS was social, ie, other cats in the immediate environment suggesting that individuals with poor social coping strategies may be more vulnerable. Removing the cat from its core territory, eg, moving house or a stay in a cattery could also precipitate the disease. Psychosocial stress can promote a relative resistance to glucocorticoids with increased sympathetic and decreased parasympathetic activity together with increased production and release of pro-inflammatory mediators. This dysregulation of the stress/inflammatory pathways promotes alterations in brain circuitry that modulates mood, pain and the stress response. Over time, these functional changes probably promote disruptions in neurotrophic support and disturbances of gliaeneuronal communication. These changes, in turn, have been associated with the related processes of central sensitisation in pain disorders which may account for the progressive and self-perpetuating nature of the disease especially when inadequately treated. 24 Conditions of neuropathic pain are a challenge to treat and experience in veterinary medicine is limited. 25e27 However, knowledge gained from humans and laboratory animal models, including experimental feline models of trigeminal neuralgia, 28e30 can suggest a rational approach. Several anti-epileptic drugs have an anti-allodynic effect 31 and are reported by human patients to be particularly effective for neuropathic pain that is burning and lancinating in nature. 5 However, the anti-convulsants do not all have the same site of action and an area for further study is to ascertain which drugs are most efficacious and safe. Determining the nature of the suspected mutation in the Burmese cat and, therefore, the site of action for potential pharmacotherapy is an important future goal. In this study phenobarbital was chosen for treating many of the cats because its pharmacokinetics and toxicity have been studied in this species. 32, 33 Diazepam was also used; however, the authors prefer to avoid this drug because of the risk of idiosyncratic hepatitic failure. 34 Phenobarbital and diazepam exert their pharmacological effects via an action at the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor, in addition to other sites including the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate (phenobarbital), calcium channels (phenobarbital and diazepam), sodium channels (diazepam) and voltage dependant potassium currents (phenobarbital). 35 GABAergic neurons and ionotropic GABA(A) receptors are found in the dorsal horn 36 and trigeminal ganglion 37 where they control the propagation of pain signals from the periphery to higher CNS areas. 36, 38 There is also evidence that GABAergic neurons in the rostral ventromedial medulla are involved in a pain-control system that 'descends' from the brain onto the spinal cord. 39 Recent evidence indicates that diminished GABA(A) medicated inhibitory control is a major factor in chronic pain syndromes. 36 GABA receptor agonists display anti-nociceptive properties in a variety of animal models of pain 38 although the side effects of such agents, in particular sedation, limit their usefulness. 40 Clinical and experimental data indicate that changes in the expression of voltage-gated sodium channels in trigeminal ganglia and trigeminal subnucleus caudalis play a key role in the pathogenesis of trigeminal neuralgia and that drugs that antagonise these channels are potentially therapeutic. 31, 41, 42 Recent work has demonstrated that there is abnormal expression of voltage-gated sodium channels in trigeminal neuralgia. 43 Gain-of-function mutations in SCN9A, the gene which encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel Na(v)1.7, leads to dorsal root and trigeminal ganglion neuron hyperexcitability and is associated with rare inherited neuropathic pain syndromes. 44e46 This has lead to the proposal that some cases of trigeminal neuralgia may result from a channelopathy. 43 This is also a theoretical possibility with FOPS. Stress may also influence sodium channels, as a stressful environment may contribute to permanent sympathetic hyperactivity which will induce sodium channel up-regulation and sympathetic sprouting in dorsal root ganglia through nerve growth factor over-expression. 47 Tricyclic anti-depressants, eg, amitriptyline, 48 and some anti-convulsants, eg, phenytoin, carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine, antagonise sodium channels. 42 Typically these drugs are first-line therapy for neuropathic pain and trigeminal neuralgia in humans. 41, 42 Amitriptyline may have suitable pharmacokinetics for the treatment of FOPS as this drug can be useful in some stress related behavioural disorders 49 and recurrent idiopathic cystitis. 50 However, it is not yet established whether amitriptyline will be effective for feline neuropathic pain and the current study did not suggest that this drug was more effective than others tried (given that there was no significant difference between amitriptyline and corticosteroids (P \u00bc 0.669)). However, phenobarbital (P \u00bc 0.011) and diazepam (P \u00bc 0.014) were found to be significantly more effective than amitriptyline in this small sample. Somnolence, weight gain, decreased grooming, and transient cystic calculi are reported as possible adverse effects of amitriptyline treatment. 50 The anti-convulsant phenytoin is less appropriate for cats as the slow hepatic metabolism increases the risk of hepatotoxicity and other adverse effects. 51, 52 Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine, the most common drugs for treating human trigeminal neuralgia, have been used successfully in feline models of neuropathic trigeminal pain 28, 29 and may be alternatives to phenobarbital. The pharmacokinetics and toxicity of these drugs when used therapeutically have not been investigated.",

Pregabalin has emerged as an effective drug for neuropathic pain in humans and has been used in management of trigeminal neuralgia. 55 It is a structural (but not functional) analogue of GABA, which is also thought to exert its pharmacodynamic effect by modulating voltage-gated calcium channels resulting in a reduction of glutamate and substance P release. 56 The pharmacokinetics and potential toxicity in cats are currently unknown; however, anecdotal reports of its use for epilepsy have been documented. 57 It is also possible that other anti-epileptic drugs, eg, levetiracetam 58 and topiramate 59,60 may be useful for FOPS as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs.",

            "text": "A feline neuropathic pain condition is described characterised by episodic, typically unilateral, oral and/or tongue discomfort, triggered in many cases by mouth movements. Burmese cats are predisposed and an inherited disorder affecting trigeminal sensory processing is suspected. A history of first signs during eruption of permanent teeth is common and the disease is often recurrent and with time may become unremitting. Oral lesions may be an important predisposing cause. Any oral disease should be identified and dental radiographs to detect more subtle lesions are recommended. Environmental factors may also influence the disease and the history should be explored for possible contributory factors. Identification of social incompatibility in a multi-cat household is a key step. For analgesia, if licensed products such as a combination of NSAIDs and opioids are ineffective, then (unlicensed) adjuvant drugs useful for the treatment of neuropathic pain may be beneficial. Based on the experiences in this paper phenobarbital (dose rate 2e3 mg/kg twice daily) is a reasonable first choice for treatment and can be given by the oral or intramuscular route. Further studies are necessary to establish which drugs are most effective for treating this disease and other anti-epileptic drugs such as carbamazepine or gabapentin may prove to be more appropriate. Periodic monitoring of liver function and drug serum concentrations is recommended for cats treated with anti-epileptic drugs.",
