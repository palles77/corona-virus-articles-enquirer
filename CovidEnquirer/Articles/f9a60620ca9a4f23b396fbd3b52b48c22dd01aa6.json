            "text": "In 2012, a new betacoronavirus-Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)-was identifi ed in patients with severe respiratory disease in the Middle East. As of Aug 2, 2013, 94 laboratory-confi rmed cases, including 46 deaths, have been reported to WHO. 1 Illness associated with MERS-CoV infection is characterised primarily by mild-to-severe respiratory complaints, most requiring hospital admission for acute respiratory distress syndrome. Comorbidities and immunosuppression seem to predispose for infection and severe disease, [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] and unpublished serological studies suggest that asymptomatic infections occur. 7 All cases reported so far have been linked to Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates. Humanto-human transmission has been reported, particularly in health-care settings, but on the basis of available evidence the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) is thought to be low, suggesting that the virus is not transmitted readily. 6, 8 Therefore, the primary reservoir of MERS-CoV is probably animals. Diff erent coronaviruses have various hosts including wildlife, livestock, poultry, pets, and human beings. Coronaviruses can adapt to new host species, as shown by the zoonotic origin of several human coronaviruses. 9 Human coronavirus OC43 has recent common ancestry with bovine coronaviruses. 10 Rhinolophid bats were identifi ed as a likely reservoir for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which emerged in people in 2002-03, through intermediate carnivorous hosts. 11 Molecular clock analysis 12 showed that bat and civet strains of viruses closely related to SARS-CoV only diverged a few years before the outbreak. Human coronavirus 229E has a common ancestor with coronaviruses found in Ghanaian Hipposideros spp bats. 13 MERS-CoV is able to replicate in various bat cell lines 14 and phylogenetic analyses show that it is closely related to betacoronavirus lineage C viruses from Pipistrellus spp bats in Europe and Asia. [15] [16] [17] [18] Molecular clock dating of epidemiologically unlinked isolates of human MERS-CoV estimated their divergence from a common ancestor in mid-2011, 4, 19 with a cluster of isolates from the eastern Arabian peninsula diverging in late 2012. 4 This fi nding could suggest that the diversity of MERS-CoV in people is the result of multiple independent, geographically structured, zoonotic events in the Middle East. 4, 19 Possible animal reservoirs need to be identifi ed to determine how circulation of MERS-CoV is maintained and to break the chain of transmission. 20 MERS-CoV can infect cells of several species, including human beings and bats. 14 The functional receptor is conserved between species, suggesting that receptor use is not an important barrier to cross-species transmission. 21 Data for exposure history of patients are scarce, but suggest contact with livestock, including dromedary camels and goats. 2, 4, 5 Food and Agriculture Organization data from 2011 show that cows, goats, sheep, and dromedary camels are the main sources of meat and milk in Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates. 22 Serological studies are best suited to screen animal populations, but have not yet been reported for MERS-CoV in animals, although several methods have been described for testing antibodies of people. 23, 24 For specifi city, WHO recommends use of a combination of screening assays with recombinant spike protein, and confi rmatory testing by neutralisation assays. Here, we describe antibody profi ling of serum samples from major livestock species that might be relevant to the epidemiology of MERS-CoV in the Middle East, using samples collected from herds inside and outside the region.",

The camels were born in the Canary Islands except for three adults, which were imported from Morocco. 25 The camels are used in the tourist industry. 80 sera were taken April-June, 2012, nine in May, 2013, and 16 paired sera were taken in these months in 2012, and 2013, all for routine veterinary purposes.

Human coronavirus OC43 is serologically closely related to bovine coronavirus, 26 diverging at the end of the 19th century. 10 Bovine coronavirus circulates in cows, sheep, goats, and Old and New World camelids. [27] [28] [29] [30] Because bovine coronavirus S1 was not available, human coronavirus OC43 S1 antigen was used as a proxy. Sera from three llamas, four alpacas, one guanaco, and two Bactrian camels reacted with human coronavirus OC43 antigen. One cow and one goat serum reacted with human coronavirus OC43 antigen as did sera from 16 of 105 (15%) Spanish dromedary camels. All sera from cattle, sheep, and goats tested negative for MERS-CoV antigen, but sera from 15 Spanish camels (14%) did react with MERS-CoV antigen (fi gure 1). The reactivity was highly specifi c-the same sera did not bind to SARS-CoV antigen but a positive control specimen did. No correlation existed between the reactivity of sera with MERS-CoV antigen and human coronavirus OC43 antigen (fi gure 2). All but one serum sample that reacted with MERS-CoV antigen were from adult animals. One reactive serum was from a 2-year-old animal. To confi rm the presence of MERS-CoV specifi c IgG in the Spanish camel sera, we used a MERS-CoV neutralisation assay to test a subset of 49 camel sera with diff erent degrees of reactivity with MERS-CoV and human coronavirus OC43 antigen according to microarray. Nine Spanish camels had MERS-CoV neutralising antibodies with titres varying between 1/20 and 1/320 (table 1). Three of the 12 sera reacted with MERS-CoV spike antigen but did not neutralise MERS-CoV, most likely because of recognition of nonneutralising epitopes. All MERS-CoV neutralising sera had (almost) saturating reactivity with MERS-CoV antigen on the microarray, whereas reactivity with human coronavirus OC43 antigen varied from negative to 50% of saturating reactivity (table 1). The variable human coronavirus OC43 signals suggest that MERS-CoV did not generally cross-react with human coronavirus OC43 or bovine coronavirus antigens. All nine camels with MERS-CoV neutralising antibodies were born and raised on the Canary Islands; seven were female, two were male. Eight camels were adults, one was 2 years old.",

All camel sera neutralised bovine coronavirus, but with varying titres, suggesting a lower cutoff than 20 000 RFU for OC43 in the microarray (fi gure 1). Five camels had high neutralising antibody titres against bovine coronavirus (and a mean signal intensity of greater than 50 000 RFU for human coronavirus OC43 antigen on microarray) but were negative for MERS-CoV neutralisation, suggesting that cross-neutralisation in this direction did not occur and that the MERS-CoV neutralising activity was not caused by the presence of bovine coronavirus neutralising antibodies. A serum sample from a patient who had MERS, neutralised MERS-CoV with a high titre (1/640) but neutralised bovine coronavirus less effi ciently (titre 1/80). The latter fi nding was most probably caused by previous infection with human coronavirus OC43-this patient had a high titre (1/>5120) in a human coronavirus OC43 recombinant spike immuno fl uorescence assay and a saturating signal with human coronavirus OC43 antigen in the microarray. Two human serum samples positive for human coronavirus OC43 did not neutralise MERS-CoV, one of which neutralised bovine coronavirus at a titre of 1/80 (table 2) .",

Animal screening is necessary to understand the epidemiology of MERS-CoV. At present, bats are thought to be the ultimate reservoirs for several established human coronaviruses as well as SARS-CoV. Accordingly, phylogenetic analysis has shown that MERS-CoV is related to betacoronavirus lineage C viruses found in Pipistrellus spp bats. 15, 16 However, direct transmission of MERS-CoV to people from bats seems unlikely. 4, 19 The identifi cation of possible intermediate hosts that are probably in closer contact with people (eg, livestock) is urgently needed. Common livestock species in the Middle East include dromedary camels but also cattle, sheep, and goats.

This low seroprevalence means either that exposure of the animals to other putative reservoirs is rare 33 or that the virus is absent in this closed-off population of roughly 2000 animals. 25 We cannot rule out that the population might have once had an outbreak but that by the time of sampling, antibody titres had waned and no new introductions of the virus had occurred. The camels have contact with wild rodents, rabbits, pigeons, and doves and possibly also with bats. Seven insectivorous bat species, including three Pipistrellus spp, are native to the Canary Islands, while Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) have been introduced. 34 The 100% seroprevalence with high titres in Omani camels from diff erent owners and locations suggests a diff erent situation in the Middle East, with widespread circulation of MERS-CoV or a closely related virus. This diff erence of epidemiology might be because the virus circulating in the Middle East is diff erent to that circulating in Spain, with increased animal transmissibility and human infections. 35 In addition, the Omani camels were once racing camels now held for breeding and might be kept in circumstances that favour virus transmission. For cattle, a relation has been established between the incidence and eff ects of respiratory diseases, management practices, and animal transport. 36, 37 To our knowledge, the camel populations in Oman and the Canary Islands are not connected. Camels on the Canary Islands were originally imported in the 15th century from the Horn of Africa for labour and transport. Nowadays, import of animals from Africa is banned because of the risk of foot-and-mouth disease. Only three camels in our study were originally imported from Morocco, more than 18 years ago. Because the closest relatives of MERS-CoV were identifi ed very recently in Neoromicia zuluensis bats from Africa, 38 the introduction of MERS-CoV or related viruses into some African camel populations could have occurred decades ago, giving a possible explanation for MERS-CoV antibodies in camels from the Canary Islands. In the Middle East, huge numbers of camels are imported from Africa to meet the demand for meat. The top fi ve camel breeding countries are all African, and Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates are in the top fi ve camel meat producing countries. 22 This increased turnover of animals in the Middle East",
