It provides timely information, and raises awareness, to better manage an important market. A dynamic demand analysis is undertaken to determine the important factors underpinning inbound tourism to Australia from China. The paper begins with a brief overview of important features of the Australian tourism industry together with a review of previous Australian studies on tourism demand. It then outlines the adopted approach, provides a description of the study methodology and data, and interpretation of the results. The paper concludes with a discussion of the importance of the findings for tourism stakeholders in Australia and elsewhere. Although set in the China-Australia context, the findings in this paper should be of interest and value to those directly involved with the marketing and management of Chinese tourists in many other countries.",

More recently, macro-economic conditions have been conducive for tourism growth, particularly the inbound sector, given the depreciation of the Australian dollar, the release of employment from the downturn of the mining boom, and the reduced demands for aeroplane seats by the fly-in fly-out (FIFO) workers associated with mining (Pham, Jago, Spurr, & Marshall, 2015) . Tourism shares of gross domestic product (GDP) for both domestic and inbound tourism sectors peaked in 2000e01 (Fig. 1) , and have settled at slightly lower levels at approximately 2.1 per cent and 0.8 per cent, respectively, over the last three years. However, it appears that the tourism sector has not been able to accelerate to its full extent to take advantage of the macro-conditions. In 2014e15, tourism contributed $47.5 billion to GDP, with $34.2 billion from the domestic tourism sector and $13.3 billion from the inbound sector (The Australian Bureau of Statistics, or ABS, 2016) .",

However, from a low base, in 2014e15 the Indian market share reached approximately three per cent of total inbound tourism expenditure, about the same level as that of Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea and Hong Kong ( Table 2 ). The Indian market still has much potential in the years ahead, given the rapid development and large population of the Indian economy. For China, the expenditure share had expanded from 7 per cent in 2005e06 to 21 per cent in 2014e15, putting China at the top among all inbound markets in Australia, driving the Australian tourism industry on its trajectory toward the Tourism 2020 target (Tourism Australia, 2016) .",

Latest data from the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO, 2016) in Table 3 show the mix of destinations that Chinese visitors have travelled. Australia was not among the top ten destinations of Chinese tourists in 2014. While it is not surprising to see countries in proximity to China such as Hong Kong, Macao, Korea, Thailand, Taiwan and Japan on top of the list, it is interesting to see countries including the United States of America, France and Russia ranking above Australia. This observation highlights a need for Australia to formulate tourism policies carefully in such a way to penetrate the Chinese market more effectively.

The determinants reflect the interaction of drivers between the country of origin and the destination country. Thus, both sides of 'a trip' can have an influence on the number of arrivals at a destination. From the country of origin e tourism generating region e income is predominantly applied in most of previous tourism demand studies; it is a fundamental concept of the economic demand theory. Income is often proxied by gross domestic product (GDP), personal (disposable) income or national income. Studies over the past three decades undertaken for many countries reveal that the purchasing power of individuals is an important influence on their decision to travel. An increase in real income provides consumers with greater spending power, resulting in the increased discretionary consumption of many types of products including tourism (Crouch, 1992; Peng et al., 2014) .",

Thus, the actual form of prices varies between studies. However, the lack of a tourism price index per se was, and still is, a real challenge in modelling tourism arrivals. Individual researchers have adopted various proxies as a result. The most common ones are price-adjusted exchange rates (i.e., real exchange rates), consumer price indexes of destinations and transportation costs. In some cases, CPI and exchange rates have been used in a comprehensive combination to derive own-price and competing prices Song, Wong, & Chon, 2003) .",

O' Hagan and Minnock (1983) argue against the practice, in contrast to the supporting findings in Morley (1994) that, since non-fare tourism prices and CPI are highly correlated, the CPI could be used as a proxy for a tourism price index. In such situations, interpretation of the estimated coefficient is problematic, as implicitly visitors were assumed to be in the country already regardless whether or not they could afford to pay for the airfares. For comparing with CPI, Morley (1994) derived tourism price indexes directly by combining the individual price indexes of goods that are associated with tourism consumption and the corresponding expenditure shares. This approach coincided with the Tourism Satellite Account (TSA) framework that was introduced by the UNWTO (2008, 2010) . This approach has inspired and orientated our thinking in this paper.",

            "text": "An important observation here is that most studies have applied prices to reflect the cost of living for tourists at the destination (such as CPI or real exchange rate) to measure the own-price effects, with some also adding transportation costs (airfare) to measure the response from tourists when transportation costs change. While Table 1 Historical annual growth rates of arrivals of Australia's top ten international markets (per cent). this separate treatment of transportation cost may be appropriate in some situations (e.g., where countries of origin and destination are close together and particularly where transport substitution is possible (Martin & Witt, 1987) ), it may not be practical for the case of Australia where airfare can determine whether or not a trip takes place. A bundle approach (i.e., total costs including airfare) to measuring price effects for travelling to Australia is probably more realistic (Divisekera, 1995) , since high airfares that require a larger budget to come to Australia could deter some visitors, even though they are willing to pay for costs of living while in Australia. In that case, the non-airfare spending will never eventuate. Alternatively, cheaper airfares during promotion periods, or an introduction of new low-cost carriers, may not suffice to attract additional visitation expenditure in Australia if an expensive destination reduces \"length of stay\". In that case, the airfare spending will also not eventuate. What matters here is the required total budget for travelling, including the cost of travelling (airfares) and the cost of living (accommodation, food and drinks) that simultaneously make a trip affordable and worthwhile for visitors to travel. Regarding inbound tourism demand to Australia, Kulendran (1996) , Kulendran and King (1997) , Lim and McAleer (2001) , Divisekera (1995 Divisekera ( , 2003 , Lim, McAleer, and Min (2009) , examined the international short-term tourist flows to Australia from Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, the UK, and the US. Visitors from those countries of origin were found to be very responsive to changes in tourism prices in Australia and changes in their income, indicating that international tourism is a luxury product. Seetaram (2010 Seetaram ( , 2012 , and Seetaram and Dwyer (2009) used the dynamic panel data technique to model international arrivals to Australia from ten markets, 1 including China, over the period 1991 to 2007. Seetaram (2012) and Seetaram and Dwyer (2009) also estimated the relationship between immigration and induced inbound tourism demand. With the panel data, elasticities obtained from Seetaram (2010 Seetaram ( , 2012 take the form of the aggregate response of the inbound tourism sector across all ten markets. Given the fact Australia was granted Approved Destination Status in 1999, and China's economic growth has been much faster than any of those selected countries, using the aggregate income and price elasticities from a group of ten markets as a proxy for the Chinese market is very likely to under-estimate the response from Chinese visitors notwithstanding the fact that the aggregate elasticity estimates are valuable for the policy making process at the aggregate level.",

The independent variables include three main groups of variables: income factor (proxied by GDP per capita), price factor (proxied by the weighted price), and other factors representing changes in the operating environment of tourism as well as migration flows from China to Australia. These choices are broadly consistent with most other tourism demand studies over the past five decades as pointed out in Crouch (1992) , Lim (1997) , Dwyer (2009), Seetaram (2012) , Dwyer, Seetaram, Forsyth, and King (2014) , and Peng et al. (2014) . All variables in Equation (1), except the dummy variables, are implemented in the annual growth form 2 to mitigate effects of possible heteroscedasticity. The advantage of using growth rates is that the marginal effects (i.e., coefficient parameters) can interpreted as elasticities, which is similar to the doublelog form that has been commonly used in previous studies. As the same for the double log form, the elasticities derived from Equation (1) are not changing over time, they are the average elasticities over the whole study period.",

We explicitly emphasise the role of this factor as a determinant of tourism demand. If it is in the form of word of mouth, then this \"advertising\" should be taken seriously, as in a way it is free publicity. Furthermore, it is essential to know how Australia is perceived by Chinese visitors by the inclusion of this variable, which could be either positive or negative, depending on their experience while they are in Australia. From a technical point of view, the lagged dependent variable allows us to examine the effect in the short-run and the long-run explicitly.",

            "text": "This study adopted the real GDP per capita as an income measure to explain the movements of Chinese visitors. The bundle approach combines the costs of domestic and international travels in a weighted average sum to estimate the price index variable. In particular, we make a slight variation to Morley's approach to deriving tourism price index for Chinese visitors using the two tourism price indexes published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), one for domestic and one for international travelling. Both contain price movements of airfares and accommodation. The domestic price index is dominated by a large accommodation share. It is what both domestic and foreign visitors face when travelling within Australia e the cost of living for tourists at the destination from the perspective of the Chinese visitors. The international price index is predominantly represented by the longhaul airfares for the Australian outbound. As the international competition will force airfares of all international carriers to move broadly in line with each other, the ABS 0 international price index would be the same with the price index that inbound foreign visitors to Australia would also have to face e the cost of travel to the destination (Martin & Witt, 1987; Witt & Witt, 1995) . To combine both airfares and cost of living, the Australian tourism satellite account data for inbound tourism expenditure ABS (2016) indicate that the long distance transportation cost dominates, accounting for nearly 70 per cent the total. Using this ratio (7:3), a tourism price index for Chinese visitors was derived using 70 per cent of international price index (airfare) and 30 per cent of the domestic price index (cost of living). This approach is similar to that in Kulendran (1995) , in which the ratio of 6:4 for transport to accommodation costs was applied for the Japanese visitors. The reason for a low accommodation share in tourism expenditure for Chinese visitors is probably because the Chinese community in Australia now is much larger than the Japanese community of the 1990s; the free accommodation offered by families and friends could reduce the accommodation expenses for the Chinese visitors.",

However, comparing the performance of the Chinese economy before and after the GFC, it is clear that the Chinese economy was building growth momentum, rising upward from 10 per cent in 2003 to 14 per in 2007, but from 2008, it has actually been trending downward from 9 per cent to just slightly above 6 per cent growth in recent years (The World Bank, 2016; IMF 2016) .

It is well documented in economic theory that, when growth is continuously strong over a long period, income increases become more permanent and consumer behaviour will move toward the purchase of more luxury goods. Tourism is generally perceived as a luxury consumption item (Crouch, 1992) and people might use it to state their social-economic status among friends and relatives. As such, in developing countries like China, demand for travel might be added to the household consumption bundle of the wealthier residents. That this trend is likely to apply to the Chinese population is justification for our assumption to include the trend variable. Because the trend reflects aspects of economic growth (i.e., increase travel budget) and technological progress (i.e., lower travel costs), we expect that the trend variable has a positive sign.",

The test results rejected the null hypothesis for tourist arrivals (p-value \u00bc 0.001), lag of tourist arrival (p-value: 0.002), cost index (p-value \u00bc 0.000), and migration flows (pvalue \u00bc 0.004) but failed to reject the null hypothesis for GDP per capita (p-value \u00bc 0.272). Despite one of the regressors having a unit root, we can still proceed with the analysis if all regressors are not cointegrated. The Johansen trace test for cointegration failed to reject the null hypothesis that the rank of the cointegration matrix is zero (test statistics: 63.55; critical value at 5%: 47.21). Thus, we are confident that these variables can be used to estimate the determinants of Chinese arrivals in Australia as specified in Equation (1). Because the lagged dependent variable is included, the error term in Equation (1) may have serial correlation. 3 To mitigate this issue, we firstly applied the Prais-Winsten regression to take into account possible heteroscedasticity and serial correlation in the error terms. The diagnosis tests show that the regression residuals meet the required criteria. In particular, the Durbin h test failed to reject the null hypothesis that the regression residuals do not have autocorrelation (p-value: 0.393) while the Portmanteau test failed to reject the null hypothesis that the residuals are white noise (pvalue: 0.622). To check for the robustness of results, we then conducted the Cochrane-Orcutt regression, which is an alternative approach to control for serial autocorrelation in Equation (1). Although results from both techniques are similar, the Cochrane-Orcutt estimator is better for model selection criteria (i.e., Akaike Information Criterion e AIC, and Bayesian Information Criterion e BIC) are lower (see Table 4 ). Thus, it is a preferred model in this paper. We now focus on discussing results of the Cochrane-Orcutt estimator.",

The reason is that, while the observed changes are the net simultaneous results of various factors, the regression parameters isolate and represent the effects of each factor individually without the interactions of the others (i.e. parameters are measured with the \"ceteris paribus\" or \"all else remain constant\" assumption). However, when considering all factors together, the net effects of parameters are close to the observed data. For example, the predicted mean effects of all factors in 2003 apart from SARS is 55.8 per cent; hence, the effective impact of SARS is only 8 per cent (55.8e47.8), which is close to the observed change of the 7 per cent reduction in 2003.",

This results in a short-run income elasticity of 3.8 per cent, implying a long-run income elasticity of 5.5 4 per cent. The value of the longrun income elasticity is slightly higher than that of Japanese tourists (4.45%) that Kulendran (1995) estimated earlier when Japanese tourists were prominent in Australia. As demand for necessities will not grow faster than, or even proportional to, income increases, a value greater than unity of the income elasticity in this case reflects the luxury consumption nature of a tourism experience in Australia among the Chinese. This high income elasticity explains clearly the source of the continuous double-digit growth rates in Chinese arrivals that Australia has experienced over the past two decades. Indeed, in any years without major events, SARS for example, the income effect has predominantly driven the total Chinese arrivals. With low population growth rates in China (approximately 0.5 per cent per annum), the GDP per capita growth rates of the country are nearly the same as the GDP growth rates; this implies the economic impact of China's GDP growth on tourism demand will not be discounted on the per capita basis (GDP divided by the size of the population). Even at the projected GDP growth at the low end of 6 per cent for China in the next few years (IMF, 2016) , this high income elasticity will continue to sustain a significant tourism demand for Australia. The value of the income elasticity is strongly reinforced, independently, by the projection of the Chinese arrivals growth rate of 23.3 per cent for 2015e16 by TRA (2016) given a forecast of 6.3 per cent growth for China's GDP.",

This difference is expected, as compared to all other regions in Seetaram's study, China is the fastest growing economy; thus, the response to price changes are much stronger. It may well be the case that Chinese tourists to Australia are more price sensitive than other key markets given the large proportion of first time travellers. A study of tourism to Malaysia (Habibi & Rahim, 2009 ) estimated a price elasticity of demand for visitors from China of \u00c08.09, the highest price sensitivity of the ten inbound markets studied. Overall, estimated elasticities in this paper are within the range of elasticities estimated in previous studies. Together with the income price elasticity, the absolute value greater than one for the price elasticity reinforces the fact that tourism is indeed a luxury consumption for the Chinese. The high value of the price elasticity is simply because Australia is far from China, airfares are relatively expensive, and in addition to the costs of living in Australia, the cost for a trip to Australia can take up a large proportion of an average Chinese household income. Any price changes can lead to changes in the travel decision of Chinese visitors. Thus, the bundle price elasticity is an important determinant for policy makers in Australia to keep in mind when considering policies directly related to the cost of trips as a whole.",

On average over the study period, China's GDP per capita grew by 9 per cent, a strong positive influence on the visitor number to Australia. GDP growth of China is the main driver for the Chinese arrivals in Australia. Although China's economy has slowed in recent years, the economic growth of the country still generates double-digit growth in its tourist arrivals to Australia. Chinese visitors are also very responsive to price signals. Hence, it is important to keep prices in Australia to a minimal level, as the impacts of price increases will be detrimental to the level of inbound demand from China.",

These reforms effectively open up market access for the Australian tourism sector, and certainly this is the right direction to boost inbound tourism revenue. The keys to achieving maximum revenue from China tourists are to (a) ensure more convenience for travelling to Australia and (b) maintain cost effectiveness so that the high income demand elasticity for travelling to Australia of Chinese visitors will bring more visitors to Australia from China.",

The findings advance our knowledge of the elasticities of demand for tourism arrivals from China, a neglected area of tourism research. As such, they have implications for forecasting tourism arrivals from China as well as policies to maintain high growth from this market. For Australia, the combination of high income elasticity with high price elasticity associated with Chinese visitors represents a potentially explosive cocktail. A proposal under consideration is to charge a cheaper multiple entry visa fee for tourists from China (Pham, Son and Dwyer, forthcoming) . The potential loss of visa fee revenue will certainly be over-compensated by a large increase in expenditure brought by Chinese arrivals. As the Chinese economy experiences its expected slowdown into the future, the growth rate of visitors to Australia is likely to slow also. In this context, since Australia is already a high price destination ranked 138 from 141 countries in World Economic Forum (2016), any increase in costs could exacerbate this decline. Policies to reduce costs or at least to keep it in check, should continue to support healthy tourism flows from China.",
