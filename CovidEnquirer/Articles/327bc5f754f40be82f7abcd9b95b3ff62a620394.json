Fuelling this debt is the recurring theme of the recognition and elucidation of the exceptional by exceptional investigators in exceptional institutions. I have chosen examples that reflect a largely personal experience, from which astute observations of single cases or small groups of patients have been the starting point of voyages of scientific discovery-from, as it were, the bedside to the bench-but in doing so I shall illustrate the synergy between clinical and basic biomedical research that now provides medical scientists with investigative tools of hitherto unimagined power.",

Knudson deduced 3 that in the familial form there had been an inherited loss of a gene responsible for suppressing tumour formation and that during the 100 million or so cell divisions that take place in retinoblasts during differentiation, the chances of losing a second copy of this gene were sufficiently high to make the development of a tumour likely, whereas two mutations would be required to cause disease in the non-familial cases, explaining their rarity and later (unifocal) presentation. Knudson's two-hit hypothesis ignited the field of cancer genetics and heralded the era of tumour-suppressor biology. Knudson's predictions were fulfilled in a rich period of cancer research that culminated in the cloning of the retinoblastoma (RB) gene in the laboratory of Robert Weinberg 4 some 14 years later, where somatic mutation of the same RB gene was found in the tumours of non-hereditary cases. This finding was the forerunner of the observation, now well established through the work of Vogelstein and others, 5 that patients with common cancers often have mutations in the same genes that are responsible for the familial forms.",

Identification of the mutation responsible for the failure of the proteinase inhibitor to protect the lungs revealed the position of the active site that confers specificity as an inhibitor of neutrophil elastase. A similar sequence was present on another plasma protease inhibitor, antithrombin. Comparison of the two sites suggested that the specificity of inhibition depended on one aminoacid. 14 The case of a 14-year-old boy in Pittsburgh with a fatal haemorrhagic disorder, whose plasma contained an electrophoretic variant of alpha-1 antitrypsin that acted as an inhibitor of coagulation, provided confirmation. Carrell predicted and established that a methionine in the active site had mutated to arginine, changing the specificity of the inhibitor from an antineutrophil protease to an antithrombin-a dramatic natural experiment in protein engineering. 15",

David Lomas, a respiratory doctor, proposed that intracellular aggregation of the mutated molecule in hepatocytes reduced secretion of alpha-1 antitrypsin and suggested that the aggregated molecules, which could seen by electron microscopy (figure 2), were the cause of hepatocyte injury and cirrhosis, and by structural studies showed the molecular mechanisms responsible. 16 That this process might be a more general pathogenic mechanism in diseases characterised by intracellular inclusion bodies was graphically shown by a further case study. A family doctor in upstate New York insisted on an autopsy for a patient aged 56 years who died of an atypical dementia. Neuropathological examination at nearby Syracuse revealed intraneural inclusion bodies with partial sequences identical to a newly identified serpin-neuroserpin-specific to neurons. It then came to light that the patient was a member of a family inheriting, with mendelian dominance, a trait resulting in the onset of an encephalopathy and dementia between age 45 and 60 years. 17 The similarities of the intraneural inclusions with those in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency led to a collaboration between the workers at Syracuse and Carrell and Lomas, who showed that every step in the pathway that Lomas had observed with the mutated alpha-1 antitrypsin was faithfully reproduced with the abnormal neuroserpin. Thus, intracellular polymerisation results in a cellular attrition, which in the hepatocyte leads to cirrhosis and in the neuron leads to encephalopathy and dementia. 18",

            "text": "In 1991, Grant Sutherland, studying fragile X syndrome, the commonest cause of familial mental retardation, discovered that the disorder was associated with expansion of hereditable trinucleotide repeat sequences (CCG) giving rise to the fragile site on the X chromosome. 19 It transpired that there are several diseases characterised by triplet repeats: AGC repeats are associated with neurological disorders such as myotonic dystrophy, and in neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington's disease the triplet repeat CAG codes for glutamine. These diseases have a striking characteristic that had no explanation in mendelian genetics: the phenomenon of anticipation, where a genetic disease becomes increasingly severe and presents earlier in successive generations. Genomic analysis provided the explanation, for in successive generations the number of repeats expands and correlates inversely with severity and age of presentation. No counterpart to these human disorders has been found in animals. 20 Max Perutz had earlier noticed alternating positive and negative charged aminoacids in the haemoglobin of a parasitic worm, Ascaris lumbricoides, and concluded that the aminoacid chains had the potential to form a polar zipper. 21 He then learned of the triplet repeat expansion characteristic of Huntington's disease 22 and offered an elegant explanation of how such expansion of triplet repeats creating a long glutamine chain could, by the action of the polar zipper, account for the formation of intracellular aggregates that characterise the disease (figure 3). 23, 24 Amyloid and protein misfolding Mark Pepys' investigation of a calcium-dependent binding protein, the serum amyloid P component, socalled because of its binding to amyloid fibrils, 25 led to the development of a diagnostic radionuclide test for amyloid (SAP scintigraphy) 26 and allowed quantification of amyloid load in man-a requirement for evaluating and monitoring treatment-which in turn led to referral and accumulation of patients with various forms of amyloidosis.",

Chester Alper and his colleagues established that abnormal breakdown of C3 in vivo was responsible for the persistent infections, and concluded from experiments in which the addition of serum or fresh plasma (but not purified C3) restored complement function and reduced C3 breakdown that there might be an inborn deficiency of a protein necessary for C3 stability in vivo and in vitro. 29, 30 What was the nature of the deficiency and how was complement being activated? That there might be alternative pathways of complement activation had indeed been suspected in the 1950s, 31 but the ideas had fallen into disrepute until the discovery of rare people (and animals) with deficiencies of C2 (or C4) whose serum still supported complement activation by gram-negative bacteria. Peter Lachmann, in collaboration with Chester Alper, showed complete absence of KAF and then, by depleting normal sera of KAF, that a pattern of activation identical to that of TJ could be produced. 32 ",

            "text": "Had TJ not existed the intricacies of the alternative pathway would almost certainly have emerged from the investigation of another extraordinary clinical syndrome, this time not due to a single gene defect. Study of sera from a rare form of glomerulonephritis, which histologists had termed membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), revealed a form of complement C3 activation not involving the classic pathway associated with a circulating factor, which caused C3 breakdown when added to normal human serum (the so-called nephritic factor, Nef). 34, 35 It was later shown that Nef was an autoantibody that blocked the action of the alternative pathway inhibitors factors I and H, so that the normally labile enzyme that breaks down C3 is stabilised, thereby leading to excessive C3 consumption. 36, 37 An identical system of complement activation was also found in patients with the rare disorder partial lipodystrophy (PLD), itself known to be associated with MPGN. 38, 39 These clinical associations indicated that this peculiar form of autoimmunity seemed to predispose to MPGN, PLD, or both, but the underlying mechanisms, particularly of adipocyte destruction, were obscure. Only lately, by genetic technology, has it been shown in mice that knockouts of another complement regulatory factor, factor H, which physiologically inhibits the alternative pathway, develop MPGN, establishing beyond doubt the primary and causal role of unrestrained alternative pathway activation in this disorder. 40 But what of the adipocyte? The clue came in the late 1980s with the discovery that an enzyme in adipocytes, named adipsin, was identical to an alternative pathway complement factor, factor D. 41 Elevated concentrations of factor D potentiate alternative pathway activation, and this raised the possibility that under appropriate circumstances activation of the alternative pathway, enhanced by Nef, might cause lysis of fat cells. Peter Mathieson was able to show that this could indeed take place in vitro. 42 But the finding of complement factor D in adipocytes was of more general significance, for it was the earliest unequivocal indication that adipocytes were not just storage cells for excess fat and might have other hitherto unsuspected biological functions. This leads me to the leptin story.",

            "text": "Leptin is the first hormone whose role has been demonstrated in the control of appetite. The beginnings were the discovery of the genetically obese mouse, the ob/ob mouse, and the pioneering parabiotic experiments linking ob/ob mice to normal mice-establishing that normal mice provided a factor that reversed the obesity of the ob/ob mice. 43 Clearly, the ob/ob mouse lacked a factor present in the blood of normal mice, which controlled food intake and fat mass. Then, in 1995, Friedman and his colleagues identified that the ob/ob mouse was deficient in leptin, a hormone secreted by fat cells that acted on the hypothalamus. 44 Early hopes that leptin might be of value in treating obesity were dashed by the finding that under normal circumstances, obese human beings have high plasma leptin concentrations and that malnourished individuals have low plasma leptin levels, reflecting in both circumstances adipocyte mass. Stephen O'Rahilly's group were the first to identify the human equivalents of the ob/ob mouse in a series of consanguineous families in whom leptin is totally absent. 45 The children had morbid obesity characterised by uncontrollable hyperphagia dramatically reversed by administration of recombinant leptin-a remarkable (albeit extreme) demonstration of the centrality of the control mechanisms of satiety to the understanding of obesity (figure 4). 46 But an unexpected twist to the story is that leptin turns out to be an immunoregulatory hormone: ob/ob mice 47 and the leptin-deficient children have impaired T-cell function (figure 5), 46 posing the question whether the immunity deficiency associated with starvation has its origins in whole or in part in adipocyte loss and consequent hypoleptinaemia. Further, since it is now clear that adipocytes secrete various cytokines, the converse question is the extent to which the untoward consequences of a gross excess of adipocyte tissue, which include cancer and cardiovascular disease, might be explained by subtle adipocyte dependent pertubations of the immunoinflammatory system. This is an area of research that is now attracting great interest. 48, 49 From experimental models to the clinic: plasma exchange and autoimmunity Frank Dixon 50 had established the paradigm for pathogenetic mechanisms in glomerulonephritisnamely that there were two underlying immunological mechanisms, the first mediated by autoantibodies (especially to glomerular basement membrane, GBM) and the second due to accumulation in the glomerulus of circulating immune complexes, and that these two processes were readily distinguishable by immunofluorescent examination of renal biopsy samples.",

            "text": "Antibodies to GBM were usually associated with a devastating disease (Goodpasture's syndrome), in which the lung basement membranes were also damaged, causing life-threatening pulmonary haemorrhage and where kidney function was rapidly lost due to a severe proliferative nephritis (rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, RPGN). We reasoned that if circulating autoantibodies were indeed the cause of disease, then interventions aimed at reducing their generationimmunosuppression-combined with plasma exchange to remove antibody should alleviate the disease. 51 The surprising finding was that antibody production was permanently arrested in some patients in fewer than a few weeks ( figure 6 ). It has taken many years of research into immunoregulatory mechanisms to begin to throw light on how this might have been brought about. Only in the past decade has there been a convincing characterisation of regulatory T cells whose engagement (shifting the balance between activatory and regulatory T cells) could explain the termination of an autoimmune response. The subject of regulatory T cells is now a major area of immunological research-and devising immunological interventions specifically to promote the generation of immunological control systems to suppress unwanted immune responses, including immune responses to transplanted organs, is a major goal of modern immunology. 52 Success in the anti-GBM syndromes led to a consideration of other putative diseases for which patients were not critically ill and easier to evaluate. The first of these was myasthenia gravis, then suspected (although not proven) to be due to autoantibodies to the acetylcholine receptor (AChR). In collaboration with John Newsom-Davis, we were able to show a dramatic response to plasma exchange in a patient with refractory disease (figure 7), later shown to correlate with the fall in circulating anti-AChR antibody concentrations. 53 This experiment established that circulating antibodies to AChR were indeed responsible for the neuromuscular dysfunction characteristic of myasthenia gravis in man, and showed the use of plasma-exchange in determining whether circulating autoantibodies were pathogenic.",

            "text": "Anti-GBM nephritis characteristically presents as RPGN. But only few patients with RPGN have anti-GBM antibodies. Immunofluorescence of renal biopsy samples usually shows no evidence of accumulation of immune reactants in the kidney, and antigen-antibody complexes are not detected in the circulation, findings that led some to use the term pauci-immune. Such patients therefore did not match the Dixon experimental model, and the rationale for treating this group of patients with immunosuppressive drugs or plasma exchange was flimsy. Surprisingly, the response to the regimen of plasma exchange and cytotoxic drugs was better than that of patients with anti-GBM disease. 54 What might be the explanation? It was not until 1982 that a circulating autoantibody (whose significance was not immediately appreciated) 55, 56 was detected in plasma of this category of RPGN patients, which confusingly was directed to intracellular antigens in neutrophils-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-and later associated with Wegener's granulomatosis. 57 In due course the principal targets of ANCA were identified as myeloperoxidase and antiproteinase 3; ANCA tests proved to be of great diagnostic and practical value in monitoring therapy. 58 Further work showed that the antibody would activate neutrophils and make them potentially capable of enhancing tissue damage. 59 However, it was still not clear whether ANCA was cause or consequence of the nephritis or vasculitis. Resolution required the technology of the late 20th century, in which the gene for myeloperoxidase (MPO) was knocked out in a mouse: the knockout mice were immunised with mouse myeloperoxidase to which they made antibodies, and these antibodies were then transferred to normal mice (which had MPO in their white cells) and necrotising vasculitis and nephritis was produced. 60 It has thus required three decades of research, moving from bedside to the bench and from man to mouse, to elucidate the scientific basis of an empirical therapeutic discovery; and in doing so a new paradigm of renovascular immunopathology was established, namely that autoantibody activation of neutrophils is the central pathogenetic mechanism in this important group of disorders.",

Much of our knowledge of immunoglobulin structure, function, and genetics comes from the studies of myeloma proteins by Kunkel, 61 Putnam, 62 and others, an earlier example of knowledge transfer from bedside to laboratory. This work also provided the basis of the technology devised by Milstein and Kohler for the production of monoclonal antibodies in mice by fusion of lymphocytes with myeloma cells. 63 By the mid 1980s there was great interest in the potential use of monoclonal antibodies in man, in particular in their use in the control of transplant rejection and in the treatment of immunological malignancies and lymphoma. A major limitation for the treatment of chronic disease was that human beings would mount an antimurine immune response. The breakthrough was the production by Greg Winter in the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology of humanised antibodies in which the combining site of a mouse or rat antibody was genetically transplanted onto the framework of a human antibody, so that it could be repeatedly used in man with a greatly reduced chance of evoking an immune response. The potential of this approach was shown by one patient with an autoimmune disease whose condition was seemingly cured by administration of immunosuppressive monoclonal antibodies. 65 The patient, a retired doctor with a 20-year history of refractory vasculitis unresponsive to various conventional cytotoxic and immunosuppressive drugs, was given a combination of monoclonal antibodies (antiCD52-Campath-and antiCD4) based on a protocol devised for induction of immune tolerance in mice by Herman Waldmann. Sustained remission followed and there was no vasculitic relapse. He died some years later of colon cancer: treatment had arrested the autoimmune response. Campath is now in advanced trials in an important autoimmune disease, multiple sclerosis, in a collaboration between Alastair Compston and Herman Waldmann. 66 But even more unexpected was the dramatic benefit discovered by Maini and Feldmann of the effects of monoclonal antibodies to tumour necrosis factor \u2423 (TNF\u2423)-this work owed its origins to the finding of high levels of TNF\u2423 in synovial tissue in rheumatoid arthritis. 67, 68 Although the potential of interfering with immunologically driven inflammation by inhibiting defined mediators had been the object of research for decades, few anticipated the scale of benefit that was found clinically by Maini and colleagues and now confirmed by many others.",

We sought to link academic and service developments at Addenbrooke's, a 1000-bed hospital, the provider of hospital care to a substantial population of East Anglia. A priority was the development of a culture of clinical research, a key to which is provision of advanced medical technology including, in particular, imaging technology. A further goal was promotion of population-based medical research, and with the help of the NHS we established the Institute of Public Health, incorporating the MRC Biostatistics Unit, the University department, and NHS public health groups.",

The well-worked-up patient is being replaced by the wellworked-up community! We have constructed laboratories to enable clinical and basic biomedical scientists to work side-by-side, a brainimaging centre, a clinical research facility that has revitalised clinical research, a clinical research unit for a major pharmaceutical company, and a laboratory for the emerging discipline of genomic epidemiology. Of paramount importance has been the culture change at Addenbrooke's NHS Trust, reflected not least in a plan developed in conjunction with the MRC and the University for a biomedical campus with the aims of improving clinical services, providing outstanding facilities for teaching and research, and maximising the wealth-generating opportunities the NHS offers.",

The reality of much clinical research is that the starting point is a series of observations in which the astute clinical observer notices something exceptional or, more usually, has technology that is being harnessed for the first time in a clinical setting.",

Basic biomedical scientists witnessing these deliberations can be forgiven for concluding that the only respectable clinical research methodology is the randomised controlled trial. \"Research is the art of the soluble\" (Medawar), so gifted clinical investigators flee to the laboratory where they are in control of their experiment by, for example, experimenting on mice genetically constituted to order. And in the laboratory, disease-oriented research is increasingly becoming the domain of non-medically qualified research workerswho require a shorter period of university education and can devote themselves fully to medical research without the distractions of clinical practice. The clinical research worker may be seen as expensive, not wholly engaged and addressing problems that are difficult and messy. Funding agencies faced with the choice of rigorous proposals for basic biomedical science versus research on patients behave predictably, but in so doing may forget that it is the real-life messy problems that need solutions.",

Satisfyingly, this approach often elucidates normal biological functions and new targets for treatment. But how should we approach the much commoner diseases, the diseases of maladaptation, where our genetic constitution relates uneasily to the changed environment in which most of us exist? Examples are obesity and diabetes, high blood pressure, allergy, and autoimmunity, for which the combined individual small effects of many genes are the basis of susceptibility. I shall use the example of insulin-dependent diabetes, a disease caused by the autoimmune destruction of islet cells. Early hopes that predisposition to this disorder was attributable to a fairly small set of HLA genes were soon dashed. John Todd's Nature paper 73 elucidated the small contribution of one gene, that coding for CTLA4. This publication involved more than 10 000 people in 16 centres, 53 authors, who included geneticists (of mice and men), immunologists, computational biologists, and specialist statistical geneticists supported by a 5-year programme grant costing more than \u00a320 million! Problems of this complexity pose an exceptional challenge. Biological complexity is now being addressed in leading universities under titles such as systems biology or integrative biology, with computational biology as its principal methodology. Paul Nurse, in his Harveian Oration Great Ideas in Biology, 74 discussed ways in which the complex molecular interactions of the cell might be transformed into logical informational structures and processes more familiar to those in disciplines such as mathematics and physics. Data are being generated on an unprecedented scale by techniques such as gene arrays and the various \"omics\"; this in turn is driving the development of new statistical and computational methodologies. There are also vast largely untapped datasets in the patient records, to which, in due course, will be added the output of initiatives in genetic epidemiology.",

The medically qualified research worker has one outstanding advantage: there is no system of university education that teaches human biology as effectively as a medical school does. But we need to do better by present and future generations of medical students. Of concern is the tendency for teaching and research to become distinct activities: research is increasingly undertaken in purpose-built laboratories, entry to which is restricted (not least because of animal terrorists). Medical students, who by-and-large are exceptionally gifted, can reasonably expect to have contact with the best researchers in their medical schools, as I did nearly half a century ago. But the competitive pressure of research and of the Research Assessment Exercise means that many university staff, especially those wholly funded by research grants, believe they cannot afford to spend time teaching. Several UK medical schools are now developing MB/PhD programmes to provide exceptional students an early opportunity to engage in research before the constraints of professional training occur. It is clear from the Cambridge programme, which started in 1990, that a majority of its graduates are committed to academic careers and are better prepared to address the complex issues ahead.",
