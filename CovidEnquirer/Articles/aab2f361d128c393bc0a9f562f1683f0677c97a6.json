The editors of this volume define a crisis as 'An event, in whatever form it occurs, that creates a shock to the tourism industry resulting in the sudden emergence of an adverse situation' (p. 1). Events usually (although not exclusively) arrive in the form of disasters (both human and natural in origin), examples of which include the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the terrorist attack at Luxor, Egypt in 1997. Tourism Crises: Management Responses and Theoretical Insight is one of a number of texts to appear in recent years that aim to assess the way in which the tourism industry is impacted by and responds to crises (see also Glaesser, 2003; Henderson, 2007) . This volume consists of twelve journal articles which first appeared as a special issue of the Journal of ).",

Importantly they highlight that it is not just the initial event that can have severe repercussions for the tourism industry but also the nature of the response.",

This chapter analyses the avalanche disaster which struck Galtuer, Austria in 1999 and applies Faulkner's (2001) six-phase disaster management framework. Their analysis, although not particularly revolutionary, highlights how issues such as antiquated infrastructure and dissonance between planning experts can lead to weaknesses in the response to any emergency and that disasters inevitably act as a catalyst for the implementation of new safety and security measures.",

Chapters three, four and five primarily focus on the impact of the foot and mouth outbreak on Scotland. Chapters six, seven and eight analyse the impact of September 11th on the Canadian, American and Washington tourism industries, respectively. Chapters nine and ten then provide a focus on the impact of SARS, utilising Hong Kong and Japan as case studies. While some of the literature used in these chapters is repetitive and some statistics contradictory, when read together a number of interesting themes emerge. In particular, these chapters highlight the paradoxical role that both government and the media can play in crisis management, as they not only play an important role in helping to ameliorate crisis but can also inadvertently help to intensify and prolong them.",

These chapters provide an interesting insight into the position of the tourism industry within the decision making process of a developed nation's government. During the foot and mouth outbreak of 2001 the UK government implemented a raft of measures that limited access to the countryside in an attempt to halt the spread of the disease. This had a devastating effect on the UK's rural tourism industry as people were stopped (either physically or perceptually) from visiting the countryside. In the aftermath of the disease the tourism industry was also largely overlooked when compensation was being awarded.",

They ground their argument in the notion that as tourism is a fragmented industry destinations can be perceived as a network of interacting organisations. This chapter is perhaps one of the most interesting as it challenges the traditional view that post crisis destinations merely ''return to normal'' (p. 157). What the authors contend is that crises are significant agents of change and that they can have a positive impact on destinations through the increased co-operation and networking that takes place between affected organisations.",

This has inevitably led to some rather repetitive literature reviews and recommendations. The limited scale and scope of the case studies included in this volume is also a weakness. In their opening chapter Laws and Prideaux identify the wide range of events that can impact upon the tourism industry at different levels (from local to global). The case studies included in this volume tend to focus primarily on the impact of a limited number of crises (particularly the foot and mouth outbreak, SARS and September 11th) and on destinations in the developed world. The inclusion of studies focusing on more diverse destinations (especially those in less developed destinations) and on a wider range of scales would help provide the reader with a more rounded view of the problems faced by the tourism industry at the beginning of the 21st Century.",

Events Design and Experience is a new addition to the increasing body of literature on events and the event industry.

Principal themes covered in the book include event planning, organisation, design and experience. As Berridge states-''the book rests upon three simple premises: (1) all event environments are created; (2) all experiences within event environments are purposefully designed; and (3) all stakeholders are the direct recipients of the designed experiences''. The contribution of the book is that it looks to examine concepts related to the importance of event experience and how this may influence event design. A reader selecting this book as a manual of instruction on the best way to design events will be disappointed. The book is not a 'how-to' on event design. It contains very little by way diagrams, illustrations and figures. With the exception of shading to identify case studies throughout the book, no colour is used.",

As a result of this style, the level of discussion and exploration of the topic is elevated and thus best suited for upper level undergraduate or graduate students. Practitioners in the event planning field may criticise the book because it does not provide traditional planning guidelines typical for event publications. However, Berridge suggests that there is a saturation of planning publications and the content covered in planning publications has become repetitive (p. 26). Berridge acknowledges that past publications have been useful in expanding the knowledge base of the event planning industry, particularly with respect to how to plan. He adds that in order to advance our learning and study of the event field, it is time to consider how events are experienced rather than how to plan events.",
