Base immunisation is redefined: it is complete only after the multivalent booster in the second year of life. A yearly revaccination interview, not necessarily an injection, should become the new standard. This interview is a professional service that must be taught, expertly performed and invoiced. Adult animals should be ''vaccinated to measure'', taking age, breed, lifestyle, the epidemiologic situation, etc. into account. Post-vaccination serology should become a guide in revaccination decisions. For a solid herd immunity, more animals of the population must be vaccinated. The profession should issue regular updates of the 'code of vaccination practice'. To counteract vaccination antagonism, a concerted action of academia, the veterinary profession and industry is required. #",

While about one-half of 6-month-old infants still have detectable levels of maternal antibodies to measles virus, none of the 12-month-olds show this. Among those without passive immunity to measles, only about one-third of the 6-month-olds mustered enough antibodies upon vaccination to resist an infection, compared with 100% of the 9-and 12-month-olds. Consequently, the human immune system continues to develop postnatally, acquiring key abilities past the age of 6 months. The development of the canine immune system shares many similarities with that of the human. In both species immune competence, also of the mucosal immune system, is fully developed before birth although further maturation of the responses may continue into the postnatal period (Felsburg, 2002) .",

The lay public was activated, the foe included vets and the biologicals industry. In England (2004), a similar initiative of several newspapers based on information contained in a letter from more than 30 British vets, contained quotes like: ''unnecessary, potentially dangerous, fraud by misrepresentation, fraud by silence, theft by deception, complete overkill'' and the like. The scenario world-wide, including the medical scene is not different, and websites abound advertising pamphlets with titles like ''Vaccination, Social Violence and Criminality'', ''The Hidden Truth'', ''Vaccines Represent a Medical Assault on the Immune System'', ''What Doctors Don't Tell You'', to quote a few. Whereas yearly revaccination is a veterinary specialty, indiscriminate vaccination antagonism with traits of paranoia, persecution mania and all kinds of conspiracy theories is not-it is also prominent in the medical environment. Actually, the first cartoons depicting a ''vaccination monster', appeared in the 18th century, short after Edward Jenner's seminal discovery.",

The real and serious threat to veterinary medicine (and of course to the canine and feline populations) is the vaccination antagonism in the public with its aggressive undertones.

The reported side effects fulfill the criteria of selective observations, and although some have achieved prominence in the scientific literaturelike the injection site fibrosarcoma in cats -they are comparatively rare. However, also some infections have become rare, and it must be anticipated that vaccination will be discontinued when the disease to protect against is no longer around. The scenario is similar to that during the final phase of smallpox vaccination, when the rare side effects (less than 1 in a million vaccinees) exceeded the number of natural disease cases.",

Protection against most viral diseases is indeed antibody-mediated, and antibodies are easily measured. In dogs these have been found to persist for more than 7 years, the study did not look later. The high prevalence of adequate antibody responses (CPV, 95.1%; CDV, 97.6%) in a large population (>1500 animals) ''suggests that annual revaccinations against CPVand CDV may not be necessary'' was the authors' conclusion (Twark and Dodds, 2000) . In the cat, antibodies to FPV, FCV and FHV were detected for more than four years (Mouzin et al., 2004) . The question whether the titers found are protective or not against a field virus challenge is irrelevant for this discussion. It is not the residual serum antibody that determines survival to challenge but the population of memory cells that can quickly expand. The question about the longevity of memory cells has now been answered experimentally; the question was not, if lifelong immunity exists (which is common knowledge), but whether its mechanism relies on a lifelong presence of the antigen in the animal's organism or of the cells' longevity. The latter was not found to be the case ''Memory B-cell persistence is independent of persisting immunising antigen''; (Maruyama et al., 2000) . However, it is not an individual memory B-cell, rather a population of slowly dividing clones that persists during the life of the organism. Like in neurobiology, a paradigm has been shattered: neurons and memory cells can indeed divide.",

It is this financial aspect (statistically sufficiently large group sizes, isolation facilities, quarantine conditions) that will preclude any further study of DOI, I am afraid.

This relationship is in need of improvement -only about 70% of the clientele return for follow-up vaccinations; the last visit to the vet obviously did not leave a lasting impression. This is hardly unexpected: an injection given in passing, to minimise the time investment, cannot achieve customer loyalty. This myopia has done much damage to the profession. After all, the client has prepared her visit to the veterinary clinic, comes with expectations, opinions (and prejudices), which need to be taken seriously.

Post-vaccinal serology, however, is not new to companion animal medicine: evidence of antibodies to rabies virus decides whether a dog may travel. An assessment of the animal's immune status would provide the vet with information about the success rate of her measures, and reassure the client. The proposal is to assess the result of vaccination by asking the question: did the vaccinee's immune system recognise the antigen? No assertion of protection, only a probability can be given -similar to the results of many assays in clinical chemistry. The first serum samples should be tested in the 3rd year of life, to see whether the pup vaccination (first year) plus boost (second year) have resulted in immunological memory; later tests can be done if so desired by the client, e.g. before the 3-yearly interval, as an aid in the decision about revaccination.",

Titer values have been attributed a biological significance they intrinsically lack, and high coronavirus antibody titers have been the veterinary death sentence for many a healthy cat. There are many reasons for rejecting titers: values differ per laboratory, because of technical variations in the tests, ''40'' and ''80'' are not different titers (''1:40'' and ''1:80'' are no titers at all but the serum dilutions tested), the difference is just two-fold.

Herd immunity is defined as the indirect protection of susceptible members of a population brought about by the presence of immune individuals. To prevent serious losses from epidemics (like during the distemper epidemic in Finland 1994 Finland -1995 where >5000 dogs were infected, of which $30% succumbed; (Ek-Kommonen et al., 1997) , active campaigning for vaccination should be targeted at achieving about 70% immune coverage. This figure has been obtained by mathematical modelling of epidemics and confirmed by observations from natural outbreaks (like the Finnish epidemic), but may not be universal, i.e. for all infectious agents. In such a situation, the effective reproduction rate R would be reduced to <1, which means that there will be less than one new case per infected individual, and (if R continues to be <1) the infection will locally die out. These considerations play a role in the eradication strategy for measles. Distemper cannot be eradicated because of spill-over infections from feral carnivore reservoirs and re-introduction of the agent into the domestic populations, but the spread of infection can be contained.",
