Ferrocene (dicyclopentadienyl iron; ) is a relatively volatile. organometallic compound used as a chemical intermediate. a catalyst, and as an antiknock additive in gasoline. It is of particular interest because of its structural similarities to other metallocenes that have been shown to be carcinogenic. F344/N rats and B6C3F, mice were exposed to 0, 2.5. 5.0, 10. 20, and 40 mg ferrocene vapor/m3, 6 hr/day for 2 weeks. During these exposures, there were no mortality and no observable clinical signs of ferrocene-related toxicity in any of the animals. At the end of the exposures, male rats exposed to the highest level of ferrocene had decreased bodyweight gains relative to the weight gained by filtered air-exposed control rats, while body-weight gains for all groups of both ferrocene-and filtered air-exposed female rats were similar. Male mice exposed to the highest level of ferrocene also had decreased body-weight gains, relative to controls. while female mice had relative decreases in body-weight gains at the three highest exposure levels. Male rats had a slight decrease in relative liver weight at the highest level of exposure, whereas no relative differences in organ weights were seen in female rats. Male mice had exposure-relative decreases in liver and spleen weights. and an increase in thymus weights. relative to controls. For female mice, relative decreases in organ weights were seen for brain, liver, and spleen. No exposurerelated gross lesions were seen in any of the rats or mice at necropsy. Histopathological examination was done only on the nasal turbinates. lungs, liver, and spleen. The only exposure-related finding was histopathologic lesions in the nasal turbinates of both species. These lesions were primarily centered in the olfactory epithelium and were morphologically diagnosed as subacute, necrotizing inflammation, Nasal lesions were observed in all ferrocene-exposed animals and differed only in severity, which was dependent on the exposure concentration.",

            "text": "Despite the increasing use of ferrocene and similar organometallic compounds, there is virtually no information available regarding the effects of long-term inhalation of vapors or aerosols of such compounds. Inhalation exposures to inorganic forms of iron have been shown to be relatively nontoxic (Committee on Medical and Biological Effects of Environmental Pollutants, Subcommittee on Iron, 1979). However, because of the lipophilicity imparted by its organometallic structure, ferrocene is able to deliver iron to lipophilic, intracellular sites in tissues which neither insoluble or water-soluble iron can reach (Dahl and Briner, 1980) . As a result, there may be ironinduced toxic effects that are not elicited by inorganic forms of iron, because of the differences in microdosimetry at specific sites. Dahl and Briner (1980) studied the toxicokinetics of inhaled ferrocene vapor. For these studies, they used ferrocene that was labeled with both iron-59 and tritium. Inhalation exposure to ferrocene vapor resulted in an initial deposition of 37% of the inhaled vapor. Of this amount, approximately 60% was deposited in the nasopharyngeal region and 25% in the lung. Over 75% of the tritium label was excreted within the first day, but the 59Fe label remained, largely in the bronchopul-monary and nasopharyngeal regions, over the 117-day duration of the study. This suggested that the ferrocene was being metabolized in the respiratory tract, probably to hydroxyferrocene, which then decomposed in the lipidcontaining environment of the cellular endoplasmic reticulum. These investigators hypothesized that, because of the tendency of iron ions to catalyze the production of hydroxy radicals, inhaling ferrocene created the potential for cellular injury in the respiratory tract, particularly at the sites where ferrocene could deliver its iron moiety. By using an estimated half-time of 200 days for clearance of iron introduced into rat lungs by inhaled ferrocene, Dahl and Briner calculated that a human breathing ferrocene at the TLV concentration of 10 mg/m3 would have acquired 1.7 g of ferrocene-derived iron in the pulmonary region at equilibrium.",

Metabolism of ferrocene by cytochrome P450 probably proceeds according to the reactions shown in Fig. 2 ; ferrocene is metabolized to unstable hydroxyferrocene (Hanzlik et al., 1978) tion (Dumelin and Tappel, 1977) . This scenario could account for the lesions we observed. In addition to the high metabolic capacity of the olfactory epithelium, the greater sensitivity of this tissue to ferrocene toxicity as opposed to respiratory tract epithelium may also be due to a higher tissue dose and a lower rate of chemical clearance than respiratory epithelium. The olfactory epithelium lacks the ciliary clearance mechanism that is present in the respiratory epithelium. The olfactory epithelium also has fewer mucus-secreting cells and thus lacks the protective mucus layer that covers the respiratory epithelium.",

This may reflect either less rapid ferrocene metabolism (as is the case for rat liver) or less penetration of ferrocene into those regions (Dahl and Briner, 1980) . Exposure-related decreases in organ weights were seen for liver in rats, and in mice, liver, spleen, kidney, and brain weights also decreased, while thymus weights increased. While these results suggest that the named tissues may be target organs for toxicity resulting from long-term exposures to ferrocene, it is more likely that these changes were secondary effects brought on by the nasal lesions. However, in the case of liver, which, like olfactory epithelium, is highly active in xenobiotic metabolism, it is possible that primary toxic effects may result if ferrocene reaches this organ. Also, the differences between the two species in the effects of ferrocene exposure on body and organ weights indicate that mice may be more susceptible to ferrocene toxicity than are rats, and that in longer-term exposure, female mice may be more sensitive to the toxic effects of ferrocene than are male mice. The results from these studies were used to select the exposure concentrations for a 13-week subchronic inhalation exposure study. These 13week subchronic inhalation exposures, using concentrations of 3.0, 10, and 30 mg/m3 ferrocene, are currently in progress to determine the cumulative toxicity of ferrocene.",
