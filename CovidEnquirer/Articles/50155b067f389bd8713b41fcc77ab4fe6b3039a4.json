            "text": "Background: Bronchiolitis is the most common reason for hospitalization in young children. In addition to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), other viruses have been increasingly implicated. Guidance on testing has also changed. Aims: To compare clinicopathological outcomes in young children admitted with bronchiolitis due to RSV in comparison with rhinovirus (RV), and identify associated risk/ epidemiological factors. Methods: Children aged less than two years admitted to hospital with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis with positive results for either RSV or RV were included in this study. Polymerase-chain-reaction-negative cases using an extended respiratory virus panel served as a control group. Retrospective data were collected on sex, risk factors, respiratory support, intravenous fluids and antibiotics. Outcomes such as length of stay (LOS) and need for transfer to the high-dependency unit/paediatric intensive care unit were included. Findings: Two hundred and twenty-seven out of 437 nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were positive for either RSV (N \u00bc 162) or RV (N \u00bc 65). The median age of cases was three months and 75% had at least one risk factor. Risk factors were higher in the RV group (P \u00bc 0.004). RV accounted for the majority of cases outside the RSV season (P < 0.01). RVassociated bronchiolitis had a longer LOS (more than seven days) (P < 0.05) and increased need for chest X-rays and/or antibiotics (P < 0.05). Use of intravenous fluids and respiratory support were higher in the RV group, but the difference was not significant. Conclusions: RV is the second most common pathogen associated with bronchiolitis and is isolated all year round. This may be important in those with risk factors resulting in prolonged LOS. Further research is necessary to establish the exact role of RV in this common condition, particularly outside the traditional RSV season.",

            "text": "Acute viral bronchiolitis is common in children aged less than two years. It is a major reason for admission to hospital, and secondary spread can lead to hospital-associated infections and outbreaks. It usually presents with cough and increased work of breathing, and often affects a child's ability to feed [1] . Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common pathogen detected in hospitalized children, particularly during the winter months in temperate climates. A nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) has traditionally been used to inform cohorting of infectious patients (i.e. to minimize secondary spread) and to aid clinical decision making (e.g. avoiding unnecessary antibiotics). However, bronchiolitis remains primarily a clinical diagnosis, and recent studies have highlighted a large number of other viral pathogens such as adenovirus, influenza virus, parechovirus, bocavirus, human metapneumovirus and rhinovirus (RV) as pathogens associated with this clinical condition [2] . Neither the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP, 2014) nor the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE, 2015) guidelines recommend routine use of NPA testing for RSV in the diagnosis of infants with bronchiolitis [1, 3] .",

Until relatively recently, the role of RV may have been under-recognized in hospital settings due to the limited availability of routine RV diagnostic testing. This study showed that RV is a year-round virus, and as such is the main cause of viral bronchiolitis outside the RSV season (P < 0.01). This study is a good example of pathway management in that only NPAs that were RSV antigen negative went on to have RV PCR testing as part of the extended PCR respiratory virus panel. This approach runs the risk of missing RSV-positive patients co-infected with RV or other pathogens. However, it is reassuring that only 2% of the children who had RSV detected by PCR also had RV detected. In a multi-centre US study with 2207 children with bronchiolitis, 72% had RSV and 25.6% had RV (ratio 2.8:1) [2] . A Greek study showed RSV in 72.4% of cases, compared with RV in 29% of cases (ratio 2.5:1) [4] . This was similar to the results of the present study (RSV:RV ratio of 2.5:1).",

In contrast, the present study showed that RSV/RV co-infection was far less frequent in those tested by PCR, with only 10 cases identified. In a Turkish study of 55 infants, RSV (N \u00bc 25) was identified as the major viral pathogen, although more than 50% of cases were associated with other respiratory viruses; the two most common were RV (N \u00bc 9) and human metapneumovirus (N \u00bc 8) [6] .",

The present study also found that comorbidities were more common in the RV-associated bronchiolitis group (P \u00bc 0.004). Following analysis by a logistic regression model controlling for age, sex, birth weight, presence of fever, and day of disease on admission, a Greek study found that the presence of RV was associated with more severe disease, and that this risk was approximately fivefold greater [4] . The present study found a higher morbidity rate for RV infection compared with RSV, especially for prolonged LOS (P < 0.05), as well as the need for chest X-rays and/ or antibiotics (P < 0.05). This trend was noted for other parameters such as need for intravenous fluids and respiratory support, although these differences did not reach statistical significance. It is hypothesized that younger children with RVrelated bronchiolitis behave differently to those with RSVrelated bronchiolitis, and may need longer to recover due to a longer period of oxygen dependency and the requirement for feeding support.",

However, it may still be a useful adjunct in infants and young children with additional risk factors, as this and other studies have suggested an association with prolonged LOS where children are less likely to need antibiotic intervention. Also, lower respiratory tract infections caused by viral pathogens including RSV have been implicated in numerous nosocomial outbreaks, which could be missed easily, particularly if routine testing is no longer recommended and diagnosis is based on clinical presentation alone. Therefore, it remains essential that there is rapid access to screening, followed by extended PCR testing including RV should secondary cases occur in a hospital setting.",

Of note, three of 10 neonates were already being managed as inpatients in the neonatal unit when they developed bronchiolitis, and required an extended LOS because of their prematurity. The remaining five children who had LOS exceeding three weeks had ongoing health issues, including four children who developed a bronchiolitis-like illness during their inpatient stay.

Children are also tested if there is any suspicion of secondary spread or outbreak occurring in an inpatient setting, or if cohorting is being considered due to lack of suitable isolation facilities. These approaches help to avoid unnecessary investigations or antibiotic treatment in this group, while minimizing the risk of further spread. However, for infants and children where NPAs are negative by the extended respiratory panel PCR, serious consideration of other primary causes of infection, including bacteria, needs to be sought and treated appropriately in keeping with managing sepsis while supporting antimicrobial stewardship.",

The study highlights the importance of considering RV as an important respiratory pathogen in infants and young children who present with bronchiolitis, particularly during the non-RSV season, which can necessitate hospitalization and therapeutic interventions, and lead to prolonged LOS. RV was found to be more common in children with pre-existing risk factors, and targeted NPA testing may be useful in selective settings. The study data further support the limited existing literature that RV may be an important causative viral pathogen in bronchiolitis. Larger multi-centre studies are required to further categorize clinicopathological outcomes in bronchiolitis caused by RSV and RV, as well as other viral pathogens.",
