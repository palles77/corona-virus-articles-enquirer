Bronchiectasis can be focal with recurrent wet or productive cough and infectious exacerbations, or it can be diffuse, resulting in generalized airway obstruction and destruction with eventual respiratory failure. The diagnostic criteria for bronchiectasis are based on radiographic features of chest high-resolution computerized tomography (c-HRCT), although the sensitivity of adult-defined radiographic criteria has been questioned when applied to children. 12, 13 Bronchiectasis may also occur in patients with interstitial lung diseases, because traction on the airways causes secondary bronchial dilation. Traction bronchiectasis in the absence of wet or productive cough will not be considered further.",

The absence of physical signs and and poses safety concerns regarding cancer risks from radiation in children, adolescents, and young adults. 21 4. The timing of c-HRCT scans to diagnose bronchiectasis is important. Scans performed in different clinical states, such as during an acute pulmonary exacerbation, immediately following treatment, or when clinically stable, may yield different results. C-HRCT scans are ideally performed in a \"non-acute state,\" but this state may differ from a posttreatment state. Bronchial dilatation resolved completely in 6 of 21 children with radiologically defined bronchiectasis when c-HRCT scans were repeated immediately following intensive medical therapy. 22 Thus, we recommend that HRCT scans are best performed in a nonacute state and bronchiectasis be diagnosed if symptoms of CSLD are present when HRCT findings meet the pediatric 13 rather than adult radiological criteria.",

            "text": "In most affluent countries, the prevalence of childhood bronchiectasis has substantially declined since the 1940s. Field reported on 160 children with bronchiectasis over a 20-year period noting a decline in the incidence from 48 to 10 cases per 10,000 people from the 1940s to the 1960s. 24 By 1994, an English study found that only 1% of 4000 children referred to a respiratory specialty service had bronchiectasis. 25 The reduced incidence over time has been ascribed to reduced crowding, improved immunization programs, better hygiene and nutrition, and early access to medical care. However, bronchiectasis is now increasingly recognized worldwide as an important contributor to chronic respiratory morbidity in less affluent countries 4 and both indigenous 26 and nonindigenous populations in affluent countries. 27 Indeed bronchiectasis is not rare in affluent countries, 1, 5, 27 but is more common among certain groups for example, the Alaskan Yupik children in the United States, Aboriginals in Australia, and Maori and Pacific Islanders in New Zealand. 26, 28 Among these populations, the prevalence of childhood bronchiectasis is 147 to 200 per 10,000 children. 26 A Canadian study conservatively estimated that the prevalence of bronchiectasis among Inuit children living in Nunavut was 20 per 10,000. 29 The only available national incidence data on children is that from New Zealand with a rate of 3.7 per 100,000 under 15 year old children per year, 30 which is almost twice that of CF. In the Northern Territory (Australia with a high proportion of Indigenous people) the incidence in the first year of life is 12 per 10,000. 31 In adults, the estimated prevalence rate has been increasing (annual change of 8.8% from 2000 to 2007) based on a 5% sample of outpatient Medicare claims in the United States. 32 In the United Kingdom (UK), the prevalence of bronchiectasis in people aged 18 to 29 years increased from 29.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 20.4 to 41.9) per 100,000 in 2004 to 43.4 (32. 3 to 58.4) per 100,000 in 2013. 2 These estimates far exceed the prevalence of CF. Given the need for a CT scan to diagnose bronchiectasis, prevalence or incidence data would be an underestimation. Furthermore, recognition of bronchiectasis is physician dependent and it is not surprising that many cases in children and adults are misdiagnosed as \"difficult asthma\" 33, 34 or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A proportion of adults with COPD (29% of 110) have underlying bronchiectasis. 35 Importantly, the majority of bronchiectasis in adulthood has its roots in childhood. 36, 37 One study of adults with bronchiectasis found that 80% of patients had chronic respiratory symptoms from childhood. 38 Hospitalization rates for adults with non-CF bronchiectasis in the United States have also increased in the last two decades; from 1993 to 2006, the age-adjusted rate increased significantly with an average annual percent increase of 2.4% among men and 3.0% among women. 39 German hospital statistics for 2005-2011 have also increased over that period with an annual age-adjusted rate for bronchiectasis of 9.4 hospitalizations per 100,000 population. 40 Likewise, an Australian state (Queensland) documented an increase in hospitalization from 65 to 83 per 100,000 population between 2005 and 2009. 41 Data from less affluent countries suggest that bronchiectasis is still associated with poor outcomes, for example, 22% with respiratory failure in a 6.6-year Tunisian follow-up study. 42 Mortality from pediatric bronchiectasis is rarely reported. Arguably, no child without a serious comorbidity should die from bronchiectasis. However, an England and Wales study reported 12 deaths in the 0 to 14 years age group between 2001 and 2007, 43 and 6 (7%) of 91 children 11.7, SD 2.6 years), depression and trait anxiety scores were not elevated in those with bronchiectasis, but the child-rated physical health QoL scores were significantly lower in those with bronchiectasis compared to controls. 50 The determinants of QoL were related to age, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 )/forced vital capacity (FVC) % predicted, and dyspnea severity. 50 The differences between the Australian 49 and Turkish 48,50 studies likely relate to the different QoL scales used and severity of disease. It is likely that QoL scores correlate to disease severity only in more severe disease, similar to the relationship between spirometry and radiological extent of bronchiectasis; spirometry is often normal in mild or localized disease, 52 and significant correlations between spirometry indices and radiology scores are seen only in more severe disease. 53 Nevertheless, all studies showed the negative impact of bronchiectasis on the children and/or their parents QoL and mental health. Poor sleep quality has also been reported. 54 ",

            "text": "Bronchiectasis is the result of a variety of airway insults and predisposing conditions that ultimately injure the airways and lead to recurrent or persistent airway infection and destruction. Examples of these conditions are listed in Table  26 .1. Bronchiectasis develops in some individuals when structural airway abnormalities, such as bronchomalacia, endobronchial tuberculosis, central airway compression, or retained aspirated foreign bodies impair mucus and bacterial clearance. However, there is currently no evidence of airway malacia causing bronchiectasis in human studies. Persistent airway injury and narrowing associated with bronchiolitis obliterans (BO; due to viral injury or following lung transplantation) can lead to bronchiectasis. Recurrent airway injury, such as occurs with aspiration syndromes, can also result in bronchiectasis. Selected pediatric cohorts from various settings and countries that describe the frequencies of these associated conditions are summarized in Table 26.2. Impaired upper airway defenses may also predispose to bronchiectasis based on the common association between rhinosinusitis and bronchitis/bronchiectasis. Indeed, the sinuses and Eustachian tubes have been considered a \"sanctuary site\" for bacterial pathogens and cytokines that may predispose to recurrent lower airway infection. Finally, there are variations in host inflammatory responses, for example, cytokine and metalloproteinase levels, and counterbalancing antiinflammatory mechanisms, for example, antioxidants and antiproteases, which may explain why some children develop bronchiectasis, while others do not despite similar exposures and living conditions. 26",

Overall, 77% of parents had abnormal DASS-21 scores (54% stressed and 51% depressed). 3 An Australian study 49 examined PC-QoL and DASS-21 scores during the stable-state and exacerbations in 69 children (median age 7 years) and their parents. In the stable state, the median PC-QoL was 6.5 (interquartile range [IQR] 5.3 to 6.9) and DASS-21 was 6 (0 to 20). Both scores were significantly worse during exacerbations (PC-QoL = 4.6 [3.8 to 5.4], P \u2264 .001 and DASS = 22 [9 to 42] , P < .001). 49 DASS score showed that 38% had elevated anxiety and that 54% had abnormal depression/stress scores during the exacerbation. In the stable state, poorer QoL was significantly recorded with younger children, but QoL did not relate to the radiological extent, lung function, or underlying etiology. 49 In contrast, a Turkish study 48 described that the severity and frequency of symptoms were inversely related to the pulmonary function and the QoL scores (nonpediatric scales were used) in 42 children aged 9 to 18 years. Another Turkish study 50 involving 76 Caucasian children with bronchiectasis and 65 controls used self-reported questionnaires to evaluate the psychological status (using the Child Depression Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventories for Children, and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventories). In this older cohort of children (mean age or five episodes of pneumonia and 21 times more likely if they had 6 or more pneumonias. The overall number of pneumonias rather than the site of pneumonia were associated with bronchiectasis. 67 In an Alaskan cohort, there was no association between lobe affected by first ALRI and the eventually bronchiectatic lobe, but there was an association between lobe most severely affected by ALRI and the lobes later affected by bronchiectasis. 56 Specific infectious etiologies were not described in these studies. A review on the longterm effects of pneumonia in young children 66 described a mixture of obstructive and restrictive lung deficits when followed up long term. However, the majority of studies in the review 66 were limited with case ascertainment and followup issues.",

Good nutrition and home conditions probably give the child a better chance of more complete recovery from lung damaging disease.\" 74 Poor public health conditions, including malnutrition, crowding, lack of running water, and environmental pollution, increase the risk of ALRIs and bronchitis. 75, 76 These issues are particularly important in developing countries. In affluent countries, those communities with higher prevalence of bronchiectasis are also those where poverty and low standards of housing are common. 26 In a qualitative study, community members and health care providers believed that potential contributing factors to acute and chronic lung diseases were smoke, dust, feeding practices, socioeconomic conditions, and mold. 77 Macro and selected micro malnutrition increases infection risks, as it creates an immune deficiency state and leads to the malnutrition-infection-malnutrition cycle. 78 However, data on malnutrition specifically preceding bronchiectasis are limited and inconsistent. In Central Australia, Indigenous children with bronchiectasis are 3 times more likely to have had malnutrition in early childhood prior to the diagnosis of bronchiectasis, 67 but this is not seen in Alaska or New Zealand. 26 Breast-feeding is a known protective factor against development of bronchiectasis. 67 Bronchiectasis may itself predispose to malnutrition as a result of chronic pulmonary infection, diminished appetite, and reduced caloric intake. The caloric needs and daily oxygen consumption of children with non-CF-related bronchiectasis have not been reported. One series described that children with bronchiectasis and low (<80%) baseline FEV 1 % predicted values, and those with posthospitalization, infants with persistent cough at 3 week (n = 31) after hospitalization were significantly more likely to have bronchiectasis compared to those without a cough (n = 126), OR 3.0, 95% CI 1 to 7, P = .03. 69 We surmise that bronchiectasis is not a consequence of specific viruses that produce bronchiolitis.",

Proinflammatory cytokines from the oropharynx may also be aspirated and augment neutrophilic responses in the lower airways. Hydrolytic enzymes in infected upper airway secretions impair protective secretory molecules such as mucins in the lower airways, and thereby predispose the lower airways to infection. In vitro studies have shown that some bacteria produce factors that cause ciliary slowing, dyskinesia, and stasis, setting the stage for chronic bacterial colonization of the lower airways. 71 Whether the concentration or persistence of these pathogens in upper airways represents a significant risk factor for development or progression of bronchiectasis is unknown. In indigenous Australian children with bronchiectasis, a study relating nasopharyngeal to bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) bacteria found a high density and diversity of respiratory bacteria along with strain concordance between upper and lower airways. 72 The study suggests a possible pathogenic role of recurrent aspiration of nasopharyngeal secretions. 72 Bronchiectasis and other forms of suppurative lung disease have been described among individuals with neurologic and neuromuscular conditions that reduce the frequency and effectiveness of cough and also increase the risk of aspirating oropharyngeal contents.

It includes alterations in subsegmental bronchial structure accompanied by neutrophilic inflammation, intraluminal secretion accumulation, and obliteration of distal airways. There are accompanying changes of peribronchial inflammation and fibrosis, distal lung collapse, bronchial and pulmonary vascular changes, and pleural adhesions. The macroscopic and microscopic features of bronchiectasis change as the disease progresses. Classical papers on bronchiectasis divided morphological types of bronchiectasis into tubular or cylindrical, early fusiform, late fusiform, fuso-saccular, and saccular types as different stages in the progression of disease. 36 The most commonly used classification is that of Reid's subtypes: cylindrical, varicose and cystic, 96 which were based on bronchographic findings. The latter findings are illustrated in Figs. 26.2 and 26.3 and they reflect progression of increasing severity. More recent HRCT scoring systems describe cylindrical and saccular changes as markers of disease severity. 97 Saccular and cystic changes tend to reflect clinically more advanced, severe, and irreversible disease. Macroscopically, the airways are tortuous and dilated, at times extending to the pleural surface. Early histologic changes include bronchial wall thickening, edema, presence of inflammatory cells, development of lymphoid nodules and follicles, and mucus gland hyperplasia. Intraluminal secretions are purulent or mucopurulent (Video 26.1). Microscopic changes include loss of ciliated epithelial cells and epithelial ulcerations. With time, chronic inflammation leads to squamous cell metaplasia and fibrotic obliteration of distal conducting immunodeficiency had significantly lower body mass index at diagnosis, and they significantly improved after appropriate therapy was instituted. 79 Also, in a double-blind randomized controlled trial on the effect of long-term azithromycin, Indigenous children randomized to the azithromycin group (c.f. placebo) had a significant improvement in weight z-score, concurrent with a reduction in exacerbations (incidence rate ratio = 0.5, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.71). 80 This suggests that effective management of children with bronchiectasis improves nutrition.",

Reviews of ETS and its effects on the developing lung and accelerated lung decline are available elsewhere. 81 Exposure to indoor biomass combustion increases coughing illness associated with ALRIs with an exposure-response effect. 82 Exposures to other indoor pollutants (nitrogen dioxide, gas cooking) and traffic are also associated with increased cough in children in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. 75 There is no direct evidence of pollutants causing bronchiectasis, and the pathogenic role is likely indirect through an increased frequency of ALRIs and increased airway mucus production. In Chile, increased arsenic exposure has been associated with a variety of chronic disorders including bronchiectasis. 83",

Older guidelines suggest optional screening for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency for patients with idiopathic diffuse bronchiectasis, 85 but newer guidelines described a lack of evidence and do not suggest alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency testing for people with bronchiectasis. 86 A Turkish study (where consanguinity of parents is common) described transporter associated with antigen presentation (TAP) gene polymorphisms in their cohort of children with bronchiectasis. 87 It is interesting to note the high rate of consanguinity in several series of children with bronchiectasis from different countries. 88, 89 As with other diseases, an increasing number of gene aberrations have been associated with syndromes where bronchiectasis may occur.

Airway secretions are usually excessive in those with more severe bronchiectasis. The sputa from Alaskan native children with stable idiopathic bronchiectasis are less viscous (by one-third), less elastic (by one-fifth), less adhesive (by half), and more transportable (by 50%) compared to sputum from children with CF. 110 Neutrophilia is the dominant type of airway inflammation, 58 although eosinophilia has also been described in some populations 111 and when treated, airway inflammation may be absent. 58 Increased percentages of neutrophils, neutrophil elastase, myeloperoxidase, mellatoproteinases, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin (IL-8), and IL-6 have been described in lower airway secretions. 112 These generally reflect neutrophilic inflammation and are not specific to bronchiectasis. The intensity of the airway and systemic inflammation is ameliorated by treatment. 112, 113 An adult cohort involving 385 patients described a direct relationship between airway bacterial load and markers of airway inflammation (myeloperoxidase, neutrophil elastase, TNF-\u03b1, IL-8, and IL-1\u03b2) with a dose response such that higher inflammation correlated with higher bacterial loads. 112 High bacterial loads were associated with higher serum intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), E-selectin, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), reflective of systemic inflammation. Using both short (14 days)-and long (12 months)-term antibiotic treatments, the study demonstrated a significant reduction in the airway bacterial load and inflammation (both airway and systemic) compared to those who did not receive antibiotic therapies. 112 However, there is a poor correlation between systemic and bronchial inflammatory mediators, suggesting that the inflammatory process is mostly compartmentalized to the airways. 114 There is paucity of data on BAL or sputum markers in children. A small study in children described increased median values of systemic markers (white cells, C-reactive protein [CRP], and fibrinogen) in children whose airways were colonized (n = 14) compared to those without identified bacteria in their sputum (white cell count: 8 115 While the authors concluded that systemic inflammation was absent in children with bronchiectasis compared to controls, it is highly likely that a type-1 error was present in the study. In an in-depth study, the blood of children with bronchiectasis had a significant increase in the percentage of CD8+ T cells and T and natural killer T-cells (NKT)-like subsets expressing perforin/ granzyme, interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3), and TNF\u03b1 compared with controls. 116 The proinflammatory cytotoxic T cells were more marked in Indigenous children compared to non-Indigenous children. 116 Exaggerated or persistent pulmonary inflammation present in bronchiectasis leads to increased lung destruction by many mechanisms. 8 The balance between proteases and airways and peribronchial tissue. As bronchiectasis becomes more severe, the airway walls become thin and saccular with destruction of the airway's muscular, elastic, and cartilaginous elements. 96, 98 The saccular airway walls are composed of fibrous and granulation tissue with only remnants of normal tissue. In advanced disease, mucus-filled saccular airway changes can be severe enough to appear as cystic microabscesses.",

Animal models of bronchiectasis suggest that inadequate mucus clearance and persistent infection are necessary prerequisites. 101 Mucus clearance in bronchiectasis is reduced by a combination of factors including airflow limitation, 102, 103 abnormal quantity and quality of mucus produced, 104 and factors produced by bacteria that cause ciliary slowing, dyskinesia, and mucus stasis. 71 Mucociliary clearance is enhanced by cough, exercise, and hyperventilation, 103, 105, 106 and is decreased in situations where airway caliber is diminished. 102, 103 Decreased mucociliary clearance in turn leads to increased bacterial colonization and infection, setting up a vicious cycle. This concept is schematically presented in Fig. 26 .4. Importantly, reduced mucociliary clearance is localized to the affected regions when for degradation of proteoglycans in a matrix model and that the protease secretion was stimulated by TNF-\u03b1 in the presence of factors found in the sputum sol. 120 There are additional pathogenic processes associated with bronchiectasis that contribute to the persistence of airway inflammation and obstruction. Increased airway permeability has also been described with bronchiectasis when purulent sputum and significant colonization of the respiratory tract by bacterial pathogens are present. 121 Also, resolution of inflammation is normally associated with the orderly removal of apoptotic inflammatory cells, and impaired removal of apoptotic inflammatory cells has been described in children 122 and adults 123 with bronchiectasis. The pediatric study 122 also examined specifically for phagocytic activity for nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), whereas the adult study 123 investigated apoptosis in relation to inflammation. The adult study 123 reported that impaired apoptosis occurred in a doseresponse fashion with increasing neutrophil elastase, a marker of neutrophilic inflammation. In children with bronchiectasis, the macrophage phagocytic capacity of BAL cells to apoptotic cells (efferocytosis) and to NTHi was significantly lower than in controls (efferocytosis: 14.1%, IQR 10 to 16 vs. 18.1%, antiproteases is increasingly recognized as important to the protection of airways against hostile agents and destruction of lung tissue. Upregulation of circulating adhesion molecules (E-selectin, ICAM-1, and vascular adhesion molecule VCAM-1) have also been suggested as playing a role in the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis. 117 Collagenase activity present in the BAL of adults with moderately severe bronchiectasis originates from neutrophils and bacteria. These collagenolytic proteases are likely contributors to tissue destruction. 118 As described above, the airways of people with bronchiectasis contains collagenolytic proteinases of bacterial origin. 118 and neutrophilicassociated cytokines that, unabated, lead to increased tissue damage (e.g., metalloproteinases [MMP-2,8, and 9]). 117 MMP-9 (but not tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-1) measured in exhaled breath condensate of children with non-CF bronchiectasis (42.8 \u00b1 18.1 ng/mL) were similar to those with CF (48.9 \u00b1 26.8) and significantly higher than controls (30 \u00b1 3.7). 119 Endobronchial biopsies in adults with bronchiectasis demonstrated an overexpression of neutrophil matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). 117 over the affected regions.

Only 50% of those with ciliary dyskinesia have the Kartagener triad of situs inversus, bronchiectasis, and sinusitis. 132 Radiological risk factors for development of bronchiectasis are the presence of atelectasis 67, 133 and persistent lobar abnormalities. 134 In Alaska, children were more likely to develop bronchiectasis if chest radiographs obtained in children less than 2 years of age showed lung parenchymal densities, persistent parenchymal densities greater than 6 months duration, or repeated parenchymal densities. 134 Among Aboriginal Australian children hospitalized with lobar changes on admission chest radiographs, children with alveolar abnormalities were more likely to have bronchiectasis on follow-up. 133 In a prospective radiographic study of alveolar changes (179 lobes in 112 hospitalized children), the two most common involved lobes were the right upper lobe and left lower lobes. 133 Both lobes had similar rates of radiological clearance on follow-up (22% and 27% respectively).",

            "text": "The clinical case definition of bronchiectasis is imprecise, but the diagnosis should be considered when children have a chronic \"wet\" sounding or productive cough with or without exertional dyspnea, recurrent wheezing and chest infections, hemoptysis, growth failure, clubbing, or hyperinflation. The most common symptom is persistent or recurrent wet/ productive cough with purulent or mucopurulent sputum. Sputum color reflects neutrophilic airway inflammation. 129, 130 The frequency of chest wall deformity (hyperinflation) and digital clubbing vary among case series (5% to 60%). 24, 52, 131 Digital clubbing can disappear after medical or surgical treatment in association with the disappearance of purulent sputum. 24, 131 Although hemoptysis is much less common among children than in adults with bronchiectasis, a presenting finding of hemoptysis should raise the possibility of airway bleeding due to bronchiectasis. Chest auscultation may be entirely normal or reveal coarse inspiratory crackles as this finding can also be present in other conditions (Box 26.2). Other c-HRCT signs of bronchiectasis include abnormalities in the surrounding lung may include parenchyma loss, emphysema, scars and nodular foci, 150 a linear array or cluster of cysts, dilated bronchi in the periphery of the lung, and bronchial wall thickening (Box 26.1). 154 Image quality and hence detection of bronchiectasis is dependent on the radiological technique used (tube setting, radiation dose, collimation distance, and image intervals). 155 False positive and false negative situations that may occur are listed in Box 26.2. HRCT does not differentiate the etiologies of bronchiectasis. 156 to overdiagnosis, and unnecessary treatment of GERD is given the increasing evidence of increased risk of respiratory infections in children and adults receiving proton pump inhibitors in community and hospital cohorts. 139, 140 Readers are referred to the pediatric guidelines on diagnosis and treatment of GERD. 141 Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (clubbing, periostosis of the tubular bones, and arthritis-like signs and symptoms) may occur in children with bronchiectasis. 142 Systemic amyloidosis has also been reported as a complication or comorbidity. 143 Cardiac dysfunction, although rare, has also been reported and may not be accompanied by pulmonary hypertension. A study of 21 children with bronchiectasis showed that the ventricular systolic function was normal but some patients had changes in left ventricular diastolic function. 144 The authors also found that isovolumetric relaxation time had a significant negative correlation with the clinical severity score. Other reported comorbid conditions associated with bronchiectasis are osteopenia, 145 scoliosis, chronic suppurative ear disease, social problems, past urinary tract infections, and developmental delay. 52, 56 In adults, vitamin D deficiency has been reported to be associated with increased severity of bronchiectasis and chronic bacterial colonization of the airways. 146 However, as serum vitamin D is a negative acute phase reactant (i.e., values fall with increased inflammation), deciphering cause and effect is problematic. 147",

It has been long recognized that chest x-rays can be normal in people with bronchiectasis. 148 With modern CT scanners, the images are best acquired using an MDCT scan with HRCT reconstruction which provides the best sensitivity. 27 The scan protocol must be child-appropriate to minimize radiation risk. Radiology centers inexperienced in dealing with children often utilize adult protocols that subject children to higher doses of radiation. Radiological features of bronchiectasis can also occur in association with pulmonary fibrosis, congenital lesions such as Mounier-Kuhn, and Williams-Campbell syndrome, 97 and as a result of traction in nonsuppurative lung disease. 149 The characteristic radiographic finding on HRCT in bronchiectasis is the presence of a \"signet ring\" where a dilated bronchus is greater than the diameter of the accompanying blood vessel in cross section (Fig. 26.5) . 97, 150 However, the cutoff (>1 to 1.5) whereby the ratio is considered abnormal should be reduced to 0.8 in children when CSLD symptoms are present. 13 While this is generally appreciated by pulmonologists, radiologists may still use the adult criteria. The presence of bronchial dilatation relative to the accompanying vessel does not always equate to the presence of bronchiectasis, investigation, and many retain the label of idiopathic or presumed postinfectious bronchiectasis (see Table 26 .2). Difficulties with ascribing an etiology to CSLD/bronchiectasis arise due to unavailability of certain tests, for example, functional tests for ciliary motility and extended immune testing, lack of a standardized approach to diagnosis, the population studied, and the CT definitions used.",

In children, indices obtained from impulse oscillometry during exacerbations were not significantly different from the stable state. 168 In the stable state, resistance at 5 Hz was poorly sensitive to lung disease. 168 In children with CF, indices from FOT are not only insensitive at baseline but also cannot detect lung progression over 12 months. 169 Another tool to assess severity of bronchiectasis is lung clearance index (LCI). The LCI reflects ventilation inhomogeneity in peripheral airways. Data in children with CF suggest that LCI changes occur early and before other physiological measurements when evaluating lung damage. 170 Among adults with stable non-CF bronchiectasis, the LCI negatively correlated with FEV 1 % predicted and was abnormal more often than FEV1. 171 However, a study involving 25 paired measurements of adults with non-CF bronchiectasis found that LCI was less sensitive than FEV 1 when evaluating improvement after treatment with intravenous antibiotics and physiotherapy for respiratory exacerbations. 170 While FEV 1 and vital capacity significantly improved, there was no significant change in LCI after intravenous antibiotics and physiotherapy. 170 The same study also undertook paired measurements in 25 adults with stable bronchiectasis and described that LCI indices were reproducible and, compared to controls, LCI was significantly higher. 170 There are no studies in children with non-CF bronchiectasis to know its sensitivity to early disease.",

In children, spirometry is insensitive in detecting early structural lung damage in children with bronchiectasis, both in CF 164 and non-CF. 52 Spirometric values may be normal, but when a spirometric abnormality is present 52, 165 ; it is usually obstructive in the earlier stages and becomes a mixed obstructive and restrictive process when bronchiectasis is more severe. Although FEV 1 correlates with chest HRCT abnormalities in some populations, it is not a sensitive measure, especially if bronchiectasis is localized. 52, 165 FEV 1 can also be normal, as in CF, in the early stages of disease even when radiological bronchiectasis was present. 164 However, when bronchiectasis is diffuse, spirometric abnormalities, although insensitive to disease activity, reflect disease severity. 164 Other pulmonary function test abnormalities described are a high residual volume, lower aerobic capacity, and lower maximal ventilation at maximal exercise. 166 Effort do not expectorate sputum even when they have substantial lower airway secretions. Hence, in young children, assessment of lower airway microbiology requires bronchoscopy to obtain BAL and lower airway samples. BAL remains the gold standard, although the criteria for defining infection remains controversial. 11, 178 Studies have generally used a threshold of bacterial growth of \u226510 4 colony forming unit (cfu)/ mL BAL to indicate infection. 11, 179 Other methods for identifying airway pathogens from children with bronchiectasis are oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swabs and induced sputum. In adults with bronchiectasis, sputum culture is generally reflective of lower airway organisms obtained by bronchoscopic catheter protected brushings. 180 One study on children with bronchiectasis described that the sensitivity and negative predictive value of nasopharyngeal cultures for individual respiratory bacterial pathogens, causing lower airway infection using BAL for comparison, ranged from 75% to 100%, and the specificity and positive predictive value were lower (32% to 72%). 72 Common respiratory pathogens in children with bronchiectasis are Streptococcus pneumoniae and H. influenzae nontype b. Other organisms include Moraxella catarhallis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In pediatric bronchiectasis, the pathogen isolation rate from sputum or BAL is 53% to 67%. 58, 109 Pseudomonas is commonly found in adults with severe bronchiectasis, but it is uncommon in children until adolescence or when bronchiectasis is severe. 58 In adults, a systematic review 181 found that persistent pseudomonas endobronchial infection was associated with increased disease severity measured radiographically, with spirometry, with death (threefold), and with more hospitalizations and poorer QoL; there are no such data in children. While nontuberculous mycobacteria and Aspergillus are commonly found in adults with bronchiectasis, they are rarely present in children with bronchiectasis. 58, 72 A number of children with bronchiectasis are persistently colonized with potential pathogenic microorganisms. 180 The largest study to report on microbiology in children with bronchiectasis was undertaken when they were clinically stable. 58 H. influenzae was identified in 32%, S. pneumoniae in 14%, M. catarrhalis in 8%, and S. aureus in 5% of BAL cultures. 58 P. aeruginosa was present in seven (6%) children of whom six had bronchiectasis involving multiple lobes, and five had other comorbidities. 58 The study also reported that respiratory viruses (principally respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus) were present in 14 (12%) children; codetection of respiratory pathogens was found in more than half of those with positive microbiology results. 58 When the adenovirus was genotyped, almost all were type C, and the presence of adenovirus was significantly associated with bacterial coinfection with H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, or S. pneumoniae (OR 3.27; 95% CI 1.38 to 7.75) and negatively associated with S. aureus infection (P = .03) in the BAL. 182 Studies on the microbiota (using bacterial 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing) in children 9 and adults 183 with bronchiectasis have been reported. However, their impact on clinical management is yet to be defined. Nevertheless, one study that compared the microbiota of children and adults with bronchiectasis reported that the respiratory microbiota significantly differed from each other. 9 Pulmonary exacerbations among children with non-CF bronchiectasis are often triggered by viruses and an increased films. However, given the insensitivity of chest radiographs in detecting bronchiectasis, these scoring systems have been superseded by chest HRCT scoring systems described by Webb et al., 97 Bhalla et al., 172 and Reiff et al. 156 These chest HRCT scoring systems are based on composite scores of multiple radiological findings. Some systems utilize expiratory scans, 173 while others do not. 97 The Webb composite score 97 is a summation score of severity, extent, and features of emphysema and consolidation/atelectasis. The Bhalla score 172 comprises the sum of scores assigned to each of nine categories: severity of bronchiectasis, peribronchial thickening, extent of bronchiectasis, extent of mucus plugging, sacculations, generations of bronchi involved, number of bullae, emphysema, and collapse/consolidation. One study compared these three scoring systems in a group of 59 children with non-CF bronchiectasis. 52 The correlation between the scores ranged from 0.61 to 0.8 but none related to FEV 1 values. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an emerging technique for assessing bronchiectasis, but it is currently poorer than CT in evaluating airway diseases. 174, 175 Other Markers. A UK group developed the bronchiectasis severity index for adults 6 as a stratification tool for morbidity and mortality. The index includes features that are rare in children (e.g., FEV 1 of <30% predicted) and is thus not used in children.",

Although blind extrapolation of management used in CF to non-CF bronchiectasis can be harmful, 192 management of children with bronchiectasis should be arguably as intensive in children with idiopathic bronchiectasis to minimize acute exacerbations, daily symptoms, and functional limitations; thus improving the prognosis. Indeed, more recent data have provided evidence that intensive treatment of children who either have bronchiectasis or who are at risk of developing severe bronchiectasis prevents poor lung function in adulthood. 79, 193 Even among children with serious underlying conditions, such as congenital immunodeficiencies and bronchiectasis, comprehensive regular care and surveillance programs have delayed decline in lung function over a period of a year. 194 The aims of regular review include optimal postnatal lung growth, prevention of premature respiratory decline, maximal QoL, and prevention of complications due to bronchiectasis. Issues that require regular monitoring are listed in Box 26.3. Ideally, a team approach with incorporation of allied health expertise (nursing, physiotherapy, nutritionist, social work) should be used, as this model has been shown to improve health outcomes for several chronic diseases. 195 Evidencebased guidelines of management of bronchiectasis in children have been published since 2002 and subsequently updated, 190 and adults have been included. 196 An umbrella Cochrane review on the interventions for bronchiectasis has been published. 197 density of known bacterial pathogens in sputum.

            "text": "There is one published study that developed a standardized definition of exacerbation in children. 168 In 69 children over 900 child months, the study described validated major and minor criteria that can be used in the hospital or primary care setting. The major criteria were the presence of a wet cough and a cough severity score of \u22652 168 The minor criteria were change in sputum color, chest pain, dyspnea, hemoptysis and new chest signs on physical examination. The inclusion of investigations (investigatory criteria: elevated serum C-reactive protein, amyloid-A, or IL6) to the definition improved its specificity and positive predictive value. 168 Other infrequent features of importance are reduced exercise tolerance and energy. 185 Fever and hemoptysis are uncommon in exacerbations of bronchiectasis in the pediatric age group. 168, 185 Determinants of accelerated lung function decline in adults with bronchiectasis are frequency of hospitalized exacerbations, increased systemic inflammatory markers, and colonization with P. aeruginosa. 186 In one study of 52 children over a 3-year interval, the only significant predictor of FEV 1 decline was frequency of hospitalized exacerbations 79 ; with each exacerbation, the FEV 1 % predicted decreased by 1.95% adjusted for time. 79 It is likely that interventions that can reduce exacerbations prevent further lung dysfunction. 187 Also, exacerbations, particularly when recurrent, are one of the strongest predictors of poor QoL among adults with bronchiectasis. 188, 189 A prospective study involving 93 Indigenous children in Alaska and Australia showed that factors associated with recurrent (\u22652) exacerbations included age less than 3 years, respiratory-related hospitalization in the first year of life, and pneumonia or hospitalization for exacerbations in the year preceding enrollment. 1 The study also reported that with clinical care and time exacerbations occurred less frequently. 1 Exacerbations should be treated such that at the end of treatment, there are improvements in cough character, general well-being, QoL indicators, and inflammatory markers with reduced sputum volume and purulence, decreased sputum bacterial load or pathogen clearance, and a return toward the patient's stable baseline state. 109, 190 ",

Oral antibiotics are usually prescribed initially, but more severe episodes, or failure to improve with oral agents, require intravenous antibiotics combined with more intensive airway clearance techniques. Although robust evidence is lacking, a course of antibiotics for 14 days has been recommended by respiratory specialists. 112, 190 Comprehensive care programs for bronchiectasis have used both intermittent antibiotics to treat exacerbations and chronic or maintenance antibiotic treatment strategies. The use of maintenance antimicrobials may be suitable in selected situations where frequent exacerbations are likely to occur. Old studies in adults demonstrated that regular use of macrolides and trimethoprim reduced pulmonary inflammation, infective exacerbations and improved lung function. 202, 203 A pediatric randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 25 children (12 weeks of roxithromycin 4 mg/kg twice a day or placebo) also described a significant improvement in sputum markers and of airway responsiveness in the roxithromycin group, but improvements in FEV 1 were not observed in either group. 204 More recent studies in adults and children have confirmed these findings. 205 However, many questions remain, such as when should maintenance antibiotics be started and in whom, what is the optimal duration (studies suggest effects are evident only after 3 months), whether macrolides are the best choice of maintenance treatment, and which macrolides to use. Other questions are the optimal type and dosing regimen (daily-to-weekly) and whether associated increases in S. aureus and other macrolideresistant bacteria are harmful at individual or community levels. 206 The latest Cochrane review (children and adults included) consisted of 18 studies whereby the meta-analysis showed that in patients with at least one exacerbation, the use of maintenance antibiotics (for >4 weeks) significantly reduced exacerbations compared to placebo or usual care with a reduction of 275 exacerbations per 1000. 205 Hospitalization was also reduced (50 fewer hospitalizations per 1000 people treated). 205 There was a threefold higher likelihood of antibiotic resistance in the group using maintenance antibiotics. 205 However, in the sole RCT that reported on use of antibiotics for conditions other than respiratory exacerbations, those in the antibiotic arm required 50% less other antibiotics (Incidence Rate Ratio = 0.5, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.81). 80 The factors affecting the risk of development of resistance to long-term macrolide therapy are adherence",

When only placebo-controlled studies were included in the review, there were no significant differences between groups in any of the outcomes examined (spirometry, clinical outcomes of exacerbation or sputum volume). A single study on medium-term (>6 months) outcomes showed no significant effect of inhaled steroids on any of the outcomes. 218 There is no published RCT on the use of ICS for children with CSLD/bronchiectasis. 218 One study reported that 12-week withdrawal of ICS resulted in a significant increase in bronchial hyperreactivity and decrease in neutrophil apoptosis but no change in the children's clinical parameters or sputum inflammatory markers. 219 This suggests that ICS have little role in the management of CSLD/bronchiectasis in children when asthma does not coexist.",

More often, bronchiectasis persists on HRCT but becomes less severe clinically with fewer infectious exacerbations and less cough evident later in childhood. In a series of 46 children with HRCT-documented bronchiectasis, a third improved, a third remained symptomatic but stable, and a third worsened while receiving medical therapy 56 Both Field 131 and Landau et al. 238 reported reductions in exacerbations during the second and third decade of life despite persistence of bronchiectasis radiographically. What happens in the following decades is inferred from case series of adults with bronchiectasis, many of whom had onset of respiratory problems, if not bronchiectasis in childhood.

Also, the NZ cohort had more extensive radiological disease with 89% bilateral disease (median of four diseased lobes, 95% with multilobar involvement).

            "text": "When PBB was first described in 2006, 23 its existence as a distinct diagnostic entity was controversial. However, it is becoming recognized increasingly and is now incorporated into all national pediatric chronic cough guidelines. 11 It is also forms part of the European pediatric respiratory training curriculum. 264 PBB was first defined a priori and was based on clinical experience before being applied to a subgroup of children in a prospective study evaluating the etiology of chronic cough. 23 The diagnostic criteria were (1) history of chronic wet cough, (2) positive BAL cultures for respiratory bacterial pathogens at densities \u226510 4 cfu/mL without serologic or PCR assay evidence of infection by either Bordatella pertussis or Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and (3) cough resolution after a 2-week course of oral antibiotics (amoxicillinclavulanate). 23 The consideration of feasibility in day-to-day clinical practice and further research has resulted in definitions (Box 26.5) based on recurrence and clinical setting. 11 Each criteria has been validated. 11 However, uncertainties remain and include (1) diagnosis can only be determined after a trial of therapy, (2) lack of research data on an optimal length of antibiotics, and (3) uncertainty of the diagnostic threshold for determining lower airway infection. 11 Differentiation between acute bronchitis and PBB is because acute bronchitis cough usually resolves within 2 to 4 weeks. Difficulties arise when recurrent and acute bronchitis episodes overlap, especially during the \"respiratory virus\" season. 11 Furthermore, PBB can coexist with other illnesses, including asthma, and recurrent episodes need to be differentiated from defective airway clearance of otherwise normal airway microbiota. Over time with antibiotic treatment and perhaps the effects of the underlying disease, the microbiota in these disease groups progressively diverge. 11, 182 Immunity and Inflammation. Studies on immunity in children with PBB 11 reported the following features: (1) absence of an overt systemic immunodeficiency (normal serum IgA, IgM, IgG, and IgE levels), (2) robust responses to protein (tetanus) and conjugated protein-polysaccharide (H. influenzae type b) vaccines, 255 and (3) 122 BAL from children with PBB typically shows intense airway neutrophilia (median 40% to 44%).Whether this is a pathologically disproportionate response to infection is unknown. 11 There are also marked proinflammatory mediator responses (increased IL-8, MMP-9, and IL-1\u03b2) that correlate with BAL neutrophil percentages. 256, 257 Median BAL levels of IL-8 and MMP-9 in children with PBB were 5-to 19-fold higher than controls and children whose cough resolved without treatment. 256 Children with PBB had significantly higher BAL fluid levels of IL-1\u03b2, \u03b1-defensin, IL-1 pathway members and CXCR2 gene and protein expression than non-PBB disease controls. 257 IL-1\u03b2 levels correlated with duration and severity of cough, 257 and with elevated expression of \u03b1-defensins 1 to 3 in PBB cases. In those with recurrent PBB (>3 in the next 12 months), gene expression of the IL-1\u03b2 signaling molecules pellino-1 and IL-1 receptor associated kinase (IRAK)-2 (in BAL at initial bronchoscopy) were significantly higher than those without recurrent PBB, suggesting this pathway's involvement in recurrence. 257 Thus, \"PBB is characterized by increased IL-1\u03b2 pathway activation. IL-1\u03b2 and related mediators were associated with BAL neutrophils, cough symptoms, and disease recurrence, providing insight into PBB pathogenesis.\" 257 Large Airway Lesions. While some clinicians believe TBM causes chronic ineffective cough, it is as likely that the airway malacia predisposes individuals to prolonged, inefficient airway clearance and hence increases risk of infection. Since the cough resolves once the underlying infection is treated, this suggests malacia has a limited causative role. 23 Nevertheless, TBM is found commonly in children with PBB. 23, 258 This association may be primary (airway malacia predisposes to PBB through reduced efficiency in airway clearance) or secondary (malacia developing because of intense airway inflammation and infection). 161, 259 One retrospective study reported TBM was present in 52/74 (74%) children with PBB. 258 However, a prospective study involving 104 children with PBB found that these airway abnormalities were no more common in children with PBB than in those undergoing received this diagnosis (adjusted OR 20.9; 95% CI 5.4 to 81.8). 268",

A diagnostic entity may have varying types of airway inflammation (Table 26 .4). For example, acute viral bronchitis is associated with both lymphocytic and neutrophilic inflammation. Although the types of airway inflammation do not distinguish etiology of the bronchitis in children, it provides support for the diagnosis. Cough usually occurs when bronchitis is present.",

While some children with PBB may need longer antibiotic treatment, we advocate the shorter 2-week course initially. 11",
