The first community H1N1 case and first H1N1-related death in Hong Kong were reported on June 12, 2009, and July 10, 2009, 4 respectively. Perceptions and behaviors related to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic have been investigated in the Hong Kong general population, 5,6 but data for students are not available. The present study investigated the knowledge, risk perceptions, and preventive precautions of H1N1 in Hong Kong students during the 2009 pandemic.",

Specific questions assessing knowledge of the major routes of H1N1 transmission included the following: (1) \"Do you think H1N1 could transmit via the airborne route?\"; (2) \"Do you think H1N1 could transmit via water?\"; and (3) \"Do you think H1N1 could transmit via body contact?\" with responses of \"agree/ disagree/not sure.\" An indication variable (1 item/2 items/all 3 items) was created to determine the number of correct answer (agreeing with the statements) regarding knowledge of routes of H1N1 transmission.

Thus, our findings are of value to those devising and evaluating strategies to combat future global pandemics. Another limitation of this study is the self-reported nature of the data.

Demographic factors and influenza infection or symptoms within the previous 14 days were adjusted in the final models.RESULTSApproximately one-third (33.6%) of the students reported experiencing at least one influenza symptom in the previous 14 days. Only 28.1% of the students demonstrated knowledge of all 3 major routes of transmission. Although 58.1% perceived a very high/ high risk of H1N1 infection, only 10.2% and 15.8% perceived a greater risk of H1N1 infection compared with the risk during the 2003 SARS and 2007 H5N1 pandemics, respectively.
