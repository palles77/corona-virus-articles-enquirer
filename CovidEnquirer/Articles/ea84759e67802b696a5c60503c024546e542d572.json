            "text": "Influenza A virus (IAV) enters cells by binding to sialic acid on the cell surface. To accomplish this while avoiding immobilization by sialic acid in host mucus, viruses rely on a balance between the receptor-binding protein hemagglutinin (HA) and the receptor-cleaving protein neuraminidase (NA). Although genetic aspects of this balance are well-characterized, little is known about how 15 the spatial organization of these proteins in the viral envelope may contribute. Using site-specific fluorescent labeling and super-resolution microscopy, we show that HA and NA are asymmetrically distributed on the surface of filamentous viruses, creating an organization of binding and cleaving activities that causes viruses to step consistently away from their NA-rich pole. This Brownian ratchet-like diffusion produces persistent directional mobility that resolves the 20 virus's conflicting needs to both penetrate mucus and stably attach to the underlying cells, and could contribute to the prevalence of the filamentous phenotype in clinical isolates of IAV. 35",

For viruses that bind to sialic 25 acid, a receptor that is abundant both on the surface of cells and in the secreted extracellular mucosal environment, attachment and detachment is controlled by receptor-binding and receptordestroying activities on the viral surface (Rosenthal et al., 1998; Zeng et al., 2008) . Influenza A viruses (IAVs), respiratory pathogens that contribute to seasonal flu and have pandemic potential, achieve this balance with hemagglutinin (HA)-mediated receptor binding and neuraminidase 30 (NA)-catalyzed receptor destruction (Air and Laver, 1989; Skehel and Wiley, 2000) . Although the importance and genetic basis of the functional balance between HA and NA in IAV has been thoroughly characterized (Wagner et al., 2002; Xu et al., 2012; Yen et al., 2011) , it is becoming clear that transmissibility of influenza viruses within and between hosts depends on factors beyond the sequence of these two genes (Chou et al., 2011; Herfst et al., 2012; Neumann and unable to stably attach to the surface of the underlying epithelial cells once it is reached. Adaptations that helps the virus to overcome both of these conflicting challenges, such as changes in virus morphology or a particular spatial organization of envelop proteins, could be evolutionarily favored during in vivo replication.",

While clinical isolates of IAV -samples adapted to transmission in a mucosal environment -form filamentous particles with a consistent diameter but widely varying length, laboratory-adapted strains tend to produce more uniform, spherical particles (Badham and Rossman, 2016; Chu et al., 1949; Dadonaite et al., 2016; Seladi-Schulman et al., 2013) . Recent 10 evidence from the 2009 pandemic suggests that filamentous morphology, conferred by the virus's M segment, may play a role in transmission (Campbell et al., 2014; Lakdawala et al., 2011) . However, whether or not virus morphology contributes directly to virus transmission -and if so, how -remains unclear. Similarly, although the two major envelope proteins of IAV, HA and NA, have been observed by electron microscopy to cluster non-uniformly on both the viral and pre-15 viral envelope (Calder et al., 2010; Harris et al., 2006; Leser and Lamb, 2017) , whether and how the spatial organization of HA and NA affects virus transmission remains unclear.",

To test this idea, we sought to 20 characterize the organization of proteins in filamentous IAV particles while simultaneously observing their engagement with sialic acid -a challenge with electron microscopy due to the destructive nature of this approach. To overcome this challenge, we recently developed strains of influenza A virus that are amenable to fluorescence microscopy through site-specific tags introduced into the viral genome (Vahey and Fletcher, 2018) . Here we show that filamentous 25 particles contain asymmetric distributions of HA and NA in their membranes, and that this distinctive organization biased the diffusion of these particles in a persistent direction over distances of several microns. By enhancing the effective diffusion of a viral particle without reducing the stability of its attachment to the viral receptor, this mechanism could enhance virus transmission across mucosal barriers.",

            "text": "We first sought to characterize the organization and dynamics of proteins in the viral membrane. By labeling HA and NA, along with the viral nucleoprotein, NP, we are able to measure features of virus organization on intact, infectious particles that corroborate and extend previous observations made using electron microscopy (Calder et al., 2010; Chlanda et al., 2015; Harris et 35 al., 2006; Leser and Lamb, 2017) . Images of viruses with labeled nucleoprotein (NP, the most abundant protein in vRNP complexes and a proxy for the virus genome) reveal individual foci of NP that localize to one of the virus's poles, which we use as a fiducial mark for comparing HA and NA localization along the viral envelope. Out of 1136 filamentous viruses longer than 4.5\u00b5m, 540 contained an NP focus at one of the viral poles. We find that NA is enriched ~2x at this pole 40 relative to the middle region of the virus and the opposite pole (Fig. 1A) . This protein distribution is stable, since photobleached portions of unfixed filamentous particles do not recover fluorescence in either HA or NA over tens of minutes (Fig. 1B) . To investigate finer details of protein organization and to determine if NA in fluorescent viruses is clustered, as suggested by electron microscopy (Calder et al., 2010; Harris et al., 2006) , we use two-color stochastic optical 45 reconstruction microscopy (STORM) to reconstruct images of HA and NA with resolution ~10X better than the diffraction limit (~30 nm compared to ~300 nm; Fig. 1 -figure supplement 1) . At this resolution, we find that the tendency of NA to concentrate at one of the viral poles is pronounced even in particles smaller than 300nm in length (Fig. 1C) . We also find that the NA seen at low levels along the length of filamentous viruses without super-resolution imaging is actually organized into small NA clusters that appear to largely exclude HA (Fig. 1D) . Collectively, these measurements present a picture of a variegated IAV envelope whose spatial organization is stable and coupled to the presence and location of the viral genome, with 70% of NP-containing viruses having NA biased to the proximal pole. 5 We next investigated whether spatial organization of the IAV envelope could have functional significance for virus binding and detachment. As a first test of this idea, we compared the spatial organization of viruses that were released from the cell surface with those that remained attached after challenging the virus with the neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) oseltamivir carboxylate (He et al., 1999) (Materials and Methods) . Interestingly, viruses that escaped the cell surface under NAI 10 challenge showed significantly higher HA-NA polarity (defined as the separation between the center of masses for HA and NA divided by the virus length) than viruses released in the absence of NAI challenge (Fig. 1E) . These results suggest that viruses with NA concentrated at one of the viral poles may be more effective at navigating environments rich in sialic acid.",

Because our approach to fluorescently labeling NA preserves its activity (Fig. 2 -figure supplement 1) and viruses harboring fluorophores on both HA and NA preserve ~85% of their infectivity (Vahey and Fletcher, 2018) , we could carry out functional assays with the virus 20 and at the same time visualize HA and NA distributions on the viral membrane. Surprisingly, the motion we observed did not resemble randomly-oriented diffusion of the viral particle, but rather persistent, Brownian ratchet-like diffusion, in which filamentous particles with polarized distributions of NA exhibited directed mobility away from their NA-rich pole (Fig. 2B , Supplementary Video 1). Labeling coverslips with Erythrina Cristagalli Lectin (ECL), which binds 25 specifically to the terminal galactose exposed following sialic acid cleavage (Iglesias et al., 1982) , revealed the history of virus trajectories and confirmed that virus motion is accompanied by receptor destruction (Fig. 2B ). Aligning the trajectories of mobile particles to the orientation of their HA-NA axis reveals that directional mobility can persist for several microns, many times the length of the particle itself (Fig. 2C ). By comparing measured trajectories (from Figure 2C ) to 30 simulated random walks in which the number of steps and the size of each step matches the observed data but the direction of each step is uncorrelated with previous steps, we estimate that the diffusion coefficient of a polarized virus is enhanced approximately five-fold as a result of directional correlations (Fig. 2D) . Consistent with the observation that polarized distributions of HA and NA serve as a determinant for persistent motion and enhanced diffusion, we find that 35 immobile viruses have, on average, less polarized distributions of HA and NA than mobile ones (Fig. 2E ).",

To quantitatively compare the NA\u0394CT virus to the virus with wildtype NA, we tracked the displacement of viruses between subsequent frames acquired 30s apart and plotted the distribution of the stepping angle relative to the orientation of the virus's HA-NA axis (Fig. 3B ).

In this model, virus diffusion is constrained by the tens of attachments the HAs form with sialic acid at any instant in time (English and Hammer, 2004; Xu and Shaw, 2016) . At the interface between 15 HA-rich and NA-rich regions of the viral membrane, like those seen in our fluorescence images ( Fig. 1A -C), NA will periodically gain access to, and hydrolyze, sialic acid as the virus thermally fluctuates. The binding partners available to HAs located close to this interface will therefore be asymmetrically distributed away from areas of higher NA density. Forming new HA-sialic acid pairs at this interface results in a bound configuration where the virus has more freedom to explore 20 steps normal to the direction of the interface and towards higher sialic acid density than in any other direction. This ultimately results in an increased likelihood of stepping away from the NArich pole, which correlates with the overall asymmetric orientation of HA-NA interfaces, and leads to the persistent motion we observe experimentally as well as in our simulations (Supplementary Video 2). Indeed, persistent motion of the virus is lost when NA is no longer localized to the viral Since virus motion is dependent on the virus's ability to establish distinct regions with and without sialic acid, we expect that dynamic distributions of either NA or sialic acid will alter virus mobility. Consistent with our experimental observations with the NA\u0394CT virus, allowing NA to freely diffuse eliminates directional bias in virus motion in both experiments (Fig. 3C ) and simulations (Fig. 3D ).",

            "text": "Advances in electron microscopy over the past several decades have presented an increasingly detailed picture of the morphology and organization of influenza A virus. This has revealed organizational features of filamentous IAV whose origins and functional significance remain unclear. By using site-specific fluorescent labeling to measure the organization of a virus while 10 preserving its function, we are able to corroborate key observations of envelope protein nonuniformity obtained from electron microscopy and extend them to dynamic observations of both protein motion on the surface of the virus, as well as the surprising finding of persistent influenza A virus motion while engaged with its receptor, sialic acid. These observations demonstrate that the morphology of a virus, the spatial organization of proteins in its membrane, and constraints 15 on the diffusion of these proteins collectively confer the tendency for viral particles to exhibit persistent directional mobility, enhancing the virus's rate of diffusion without diminishing its strength of adhesion. Importantly, our simulations show that this advantage of filamentous morphology would not be limited to the extremely large particles whose length is easily measured using diffraction limited microscopy, but rather extends to particles <200nm in length ( Although more work is needed to understand if these characteristics of IAV organization are adaptive during in vivo replication, a simple model of viral transport suggests how the directional viral mobility we observe could contribute during host-to-host transmission. On first entering the respiratory tract, viruses must diffuse through the mucosal barrier to infect the underlying airway 25 epithelial cells. Competing with this process is mucocilliary clearance, which carries particles bound to mucus towards the pharynx where they are neutralized ( Fig. 4 -figure supplement 1A ). If the transport of a virus through a mucosal barrier is modeled as a first passage problem with a time limit imposed by the rate of mucociliary clearance, a five-fold increase in the diffusion coefficient (as predicted in Figure 2D ) would lead to a proportional reduction in the first passage 30 time. More dramatically, it would also increase the fraction of particles that reach the cell surface when the rate of mucociliary clearance is high and would normally prevent most particles from reaching the cell surface. Our experiments on two-dimensional sialic acid-coated surfaces suggest a diffusion coefficient of ~1000 nm 2 /s for polarized viruses; adapting this value for a onedimensional first passage model suggests that persistent motion increases the number of 35 particles that reach the epithelium before being cleared by ~5000-fold (Supplementary Text, Fig.  4 -figure supplement 1B). Although there are multiple ways that a virus's passage through mucus can be accelerated (reducing its size, decreasing the number of HAs on its surface, increasing the number of NAs, or making the spatial distribution of NA more uniform), each of these changes would likely reduce binding stability once the virus has managed to reach the cell surface. In 40 contrast, the polarized distributions of NA on the viral surface that we observe increase virus diffusion without compromising binding stability.",

We infect a polarized monolayer of MDCK cells grown on a collagen gel at MOI of 1-3. After incubating cells with virus for one hour at 37 o C, we wash to remove excess virus, replacing media with virus growth media supplemented with or without a 15 specified concentration of oseltamivir carboxylate (Toronto Research Chemicals O700980), but without TPCK-treated trypsin. At 16 hours post infection, we remove the virus containing media for labeling and imaging, and replace with media supplemented with 1U/ml NanI from Clostridium perfringens (Sigma N2876). After treating with this exogenous sialidase for one hour at 37 o C, we again collect cell culture media for virus labeling and imaging. 20 To measure the HA-NA polarization on viruses released in these experiments, we segment filamentous viruses with lengths >1\u03bcm and measure the intensity-weighted centroid (i.e. \"center of mass\") for both the HA and NA channels. The vector connecting the NA centroid to the HA centroid defines the orientation of HA-NA polarity. Dividing the magnitude of this vector by the total particle length gives the HA-NA polarity metric plotted throughout this work. 25 Virus motility assay.

Coverslips were then washed 5X in NTC buffer and equilibrated to 4 o C in preparation for virus binding. For surfaces functionalized in this way (Piehler et al., 2000) , we expect a PEG density of ~0.75 molecules/nm 2 , corresponding to 35 roughly one PEG-Biotin per 7nm x 7nm area on the surface. If each biotin is bound by one streptavidin tetramer and subsequently one molecule of biotinylated fetuin (with ~10 sialic acid residues per molecule), the surface density of sialic acid will be ~0.2 SA/nm 2 .",

Instead, we focused on 10 predicting the general phenomenon of organization-dependent directional mobility, and how this mobility changes when characteristics of the virus or its receptors (i.e. sialic acid, SA) are altered.",

Although this value is lower than the estimated density in our experiments as well as on the surface of a cell (~0.1-1 SA/nm 2 ) (Rosenberg, 1972) , 15 it serves as a reasonable approximation given that HAs do not bind all SA glycoforms with similar affinity, and also that not all SAs on the surface of fetuin may be accessible for binding after the protein is immobilized on the surface. For HA and NA distributions on the surface of the virus, we use a triangular lattice with a spacing of 15nm between neighboring spikes, with 84 HAs and 16 NAs proximal to the surface for a filamentous virus 300 nm long. Although we do not explicitly 20 account for the trimeric / tetrameric nature of HA / NA, this should have relatively little effect on our results since each HA can bind up to three SAs and each NA can cleave multiple SAs. Except in simulations where NA is allowed to diffuse on the viral surface (modeling the behavior of NA\u0394CT that we observe experimentally, Figure 3 -figure supplement 2B) , the locations of HA and NA on simulated viruses are static, translating and rotating with the virus as a rigid object. 25 Although this is consistent with our measurements of protein mobility on the viral surface (Fig.  1B) , it does not account for rotation of the virus around its minor axis, which could occur in our experiments.",

In particular, we only account for rotations about the virus' major axis, \u03b8, and not around the angles \u03c6 or \u03c8 (Figure 3 -figure supplement 4A ). For a cylindrical particle interacting with a flat surface, rotations about the angle \u03c8 would reduce the contact area between 30 the particle and the surface, and would not be favored. This is consistent with our experiments, in which we do not observe filamentous particles pivoting on the surface around the virus's poles. In contrast, rotations around the angle \u03c6 would be permissible, although we are unable to detect them experimentally. Because the particles we model are axisymmetric, rotations about \u03c6 do not appreciably change the number or location of HA and NA molecules that are proximal to the 35 surface. As a result, we do not expect that omitting this rotational degree of freedom from our simulations would qualitatively affect the results for cylindrical, axisymmetric particles.

In this model, rectification of virus motion comes from asymmetries in the location of HA relative to the SA that are available for binding. At the boundary between regions where NA activity has cleaved SA and regions where it has not, HA molecules will have more potential binding partners in the direction of the uncleaved region. The constraints introduced by binding to these SAs will leave the virus with greater likelihood to step in the 5 direction of the uncleaved region. Although this asymmetrically distributed freedom of motion will only apply to a subset of all HAs, over the course of ~10 6 simulation steps, it is sufficient to bias the direction of virus diffusion. This establishes a form of Brownian ratchet, where the input energy could derive from the hydrolysis of sialic acid by NA. Any change in NA organization that gets rid of this asymmetry in the orientation of the HA-NA interface (e.g. placing NA at both poles, 10 in a single band away from the poles, spatially separated from HA, or in a uniform distribution over the surface of the virus) abolishes the rectified motion (Figure 3 -figure supplement 4) .",

Taking L ~ 100nm, kcat ~ 100s -1 , and D ~ 0.01-0.1\u00b5m 2 /s (reasonable values for large glycoproteins (Freeman et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2015) ) gives Da ~ 10-100. The larger this value is, the better able a virus would be to maintain gradients in sialic acid density to support directional mobility. To test this 25 prediction, we performed simulations where the diffusion coefficient of SA is varied while kcat remains constant and new SA residues are generated at the simulation boundary every time one is cleaved (to prevent complete removal of SA when its diffusion coefficient is high). Consistent with the prediction, simulations of virus motion at Da ~ 100 or greater show preferential diffusion along the axis of the virus, while simulations at Da < 100 do not (Fig. 3E) . Interestingly, for IAV 30 this transition corresponds to a diffusion coefficient of ~0.01\u00b5m 2 /s, characteristic of some membrane-anchored glycoproteins (Jacobson, 1984) , but considerably slower than measured values for gangliosides (Komura et al., 2016) . Although receptor diffusion can attenuate persistent virus motion if it is too rapid, it can also increase the rate of motion relative to immobile receptors by allowing HAs away from the HA-NA interface to also sample from asymmetric distributions of 35 receptors (Fig. 3E) . Thus, the nature of the receptors to which a virus is bound will likely influence how the virus moves -with greater persistent directional mobility on mucin gels of anchored glycoproteins, and with less persistence once it reaches glycolipids closer to the cell surface.",

This will depend on the diffusion coefficient, D, which we estimate from the data in Figure 2 and the relationship D = MSD/4t. This gives a value of ~1000nm 2 /s in two dimensions or ~500nm 2 /s in 20 one dimension, which we can substitute into the expressions above. The results of these calculations are plotted in Figure 4 -figure supplement 1, where we compare the first passage probability of viruses with five-fold differences in their diffusion coefficients in a mucus layer that is 2 \u03bcm thick. For the parameters listed here, the timescale for mucociliary clearance (~20 min) is substantially shorter than the timescale for virus diffusion (~2h), and the percentage of successful 25 particles is extremely sensitive to their diffusion coefficient: the five-fold decrease in D that we estimate would result from the loss of persistent motion would lead to a ~5000-fold decrease in the number of successful particles (Figure 4 -figure supplement 1B) .

After one hour of treatment with exogenous NA, we harvest virus that had previously remained bound to the cell surface. Virus collected from cells treated with 100nM oseltamivir exhibit significantly more polarized distributions of HA and NA on their surface, while those collected only after treatment with exogenous NA are significantly less polarized.

Allowing surface diffusion of sialic acid during simulations can enhance or suppress directional motion of viruses, depending on the receptor mobility and the catalytic rate of NA.

For a constant HA-SA binding affinity, the average number of bound SA increases proportional to the number of HAs proximal to the surface (top row; 5 average number of bound HA-SA pairs (\u00b1 S.D.) is given in the upper-right corner of each panel), resulting in substantially reduced mobility in larger particles. If binding affinity is varied (by varying the HA-SA off rate, koff) to maintain a constant number of average bound HA-SA pairs for viruses of different size, larger particles exhibit higher mobilities with greater angular persistence (bottom row).
