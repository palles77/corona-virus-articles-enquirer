The main advantage of Lyapunov direct method is that it is directly applicable to nonlinear systems. However, the method requires an auxiliary function, the Lyapunov function, which usually is hard to construct. In 2004, Korobeinikov used the Volterra-type Lyapunov function to prove the global stability of the equilibrium states of a basic viral dynamic model, [18] . This function has been extensively used to prove the global stability of the equilibrium of infectious disease models, [19, 20, 31] . Vargas-De-Le\u00f3n used the combinations of common quadratic, composite quadratic and Volterra-type functions to prove the global stability of equilibrium states of several epidemic models, [41] , and for a hepatitis B model, with noncytolytic loss of infected cells, [42] .",

Their approach is a generalization of Bendixson's criterion to systems of any finite dimensions and uses compound matrices. This method is nowadays classic, due to the wide range of applications, especially to mathematical models of biological interest. The majority of applications refer to epidemic models (see, e.g., [4, 7, 10, 21, 24, 26, 39, 43] ) although applications to other population dynamics context may be also found, [6, 8] . In [9] it has been shown that the mathematical structure of SEIR-like systems, whose analysis may generally be reduced to three-dimensional systems, appears to be particularly suitable for the applications of the method. On the other hand, applications to fourdimensional systems are not very common in the literature, because the procedure becomes particularly involved when n 4. Examples are given by Ballyk and coworkers, [5] , who applied the compound matrix techniques to a four-dimensional population model with peculiar symmetries, and Gumel and coworkers, [16] , who studied a SVEIR (susceptible, vaccinated, exposed, infectious and recovered) model of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic spread.",

The cells in the eclipse stage are already infected and may be killed by immune cells or cytopathic effects [2] . Then it is reasonable to assume that the average life span of uninfected cells (1/\u03bc) should be greater than, or equal to, the lifespan of cells in the eclipse stage (1/\u03b7).

Firstly, we have studied the global stability analysis for the model of HIV-1 infection recently introduced by Rong and coworkers, [37] . We have obtained sufficient conditions for the global asymptotic stability of both the virus-free and the infected equilibrium. Such aspect is worth to be carefully investigated because it is biologically relevant. For example, the global stability of the infected equilibrium gives the conditions, written in terms of the parameters of the system, under which the virus cannot be eliminated. We obtain our result in two different ways: using the Lyapunov direct method and the geometric method for global stability introduced by Li and Muldowney.",

For example, the geometric approach to stability is based on two crucial choices: the entries of the matrix Q and the vector norm (14) . Different choices of the matrix Q and of the vector norm could lead to better sufficient conditions than those found here, in the sense that the restrictions on the parameters may be weakened.",
