            "text": "A large quantity of functional ncRNAs have been discovered through sequencing technology, including high throughput sequencing (Maxam and Gilbert, 1977; Bentley et al., 2008) . The RNAs are related to various biological processes such as epigenetic silencing (Pasmant et al., 2011) , splicing regulation (Ji et al., 2003) , translational control (Long and Caceres, 2009 ), apoptosis regulation, and cell cycle control (Kino et al., 2010) . However, the functions of a large number of RNAs have not yet been uncovered. Secondary structures of the RNAs are an important key to uncovering the functions of the RNAs because the structures play critical roles in biological processes, (Wu et al., 1991) and secondary structures are often conserved among homologs even in the case where the sequences of the homologs are nonconserved. (Klein and Eddy, 2003) To more correctly predict secondary structures, simultaneous consideration of sequence alignment and secondary structure, or structural alignment (Sankoff, 1985; Hofacker et al., 2004; Havgaard et al., 2007) , has been taken into account. (Hamada et al., 2009c (Hamada et al., , 2011 Tan et al., 2017) However, the consideration has been proven intractable (Sankoff, 1985) and thus has been conducted roughly to decompose structural alignments. (Hamada et al., 2009c,a; Sato et al., 2012; Tan et al., 2017) To more accurately accomplish this goal, the PhyloFold method ( Figure 1 ) was developed in this study. The method predicts secondary structures of homologs considering likely pairwise structual alignments between the homologs by a sparsification technique. (1) The method computes pairwise structural alignment probabilities for each pair of input homologs.",

The reference seed structural alignments of the 147 sampled families are compiled as test set \"aligned\". The rightmost column shows the type of probabilities used to predict secondary structures. Precise alignment type is proposed in this study. Decomposed alignment type considers structural alignment to decompose an alignment STA RNA into the structures and alignment SS RN A , SS RN A , SA RNA . Single sequence type does not take support homologs into account. \"+ consensus structure\" means that probabilities on consensus secondary structure given input sequence alignment are mixed. Precise alignment (+ consensus structure) type is expected to display the highest prediction accuracy. Unaligned homologs of 11 ncRNA families and the reference secondary structures of the homologs were collected from the RNA STRAND database (Andronescu et al., 2008) and compiled as test set \"unaligned\". The Rfam database was not used to build the set because this database does not register reference single secondary structures. Ten homologs and their reference secondary structures were sampled from each ncRNA family when the family had 11 or more homologs. The middle and rightmost columns show the number of homologs and the range of lengths on each ncRNA family, respectively. \"Coronavirus 3 prime stem-loop\u2026\" and \"Vimentin 3 prime UTR\" stand for \"Coronavirus 3 prime stem-loop II-like motif (s2m)\" and \"Vimentin 3 prime UTR protein-binding region,\" respectively.",
