This may include bacteria or viruses, or any pathogen that may cause disease. The intention is either to kill or incapacitate individuals, or to render an area of tactical importance impassable to unprotected persons. Pathogens may be termed 'bioweapons' or 'biological weapons'. Where such an agent is non-living (although produced by a biological organism), for example a toxin, then this is considered to be a chemical agent under the terms of the Chemical Weapons Convention.",

During the sixth century BC the Assyrians poisoned enemy water wells with ergot fungus in order to disorientate the enemy. During the fourth century BC Scythian archers used arrows tipped with animal faeces in order to cause the wounds of their enemies to become infected. In 204 BC Hannibal famously utilised a form of biowarfare when he instructed his soldiers to throw clay pots filled with venomous snakes on to the decks of Pergamene enemy ships. During the Middle Ages, victims of the bubonic plague were often used for biological attacks, as besieging armies flung the diseased corpses and excrement over castle walls using catapults.",

One of the main requirements for mathematical models of disease spread involves the estimation of the effective contact rate in a given population. This is the product of the total contact rate per unit time (effective or not) and the risk of transmission. However, there are limitations to this calculation as contact rates can vary widely between individuals and groups. It is also difficult to determine transmission risk accurately, as this requires the study of infection rates by deliberate exposure of unaffected individuals to the organism, which is clearly unethical. However, post-outbreak contact study may allow the transmission risk to be estimated by assessing the number of secondary infection cases in a known exposed population (the secondary attack rate). In order to do so, contact tracing must be thorough and effective to identify all potential contacts with the primary case. Secondary attack rates can also be useful in investigating the efficacy of a vaccination by comparison between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups for a specified organism. Several software models are available to facilitate this process, as well as much more complex epidemic simulations, such as Epigrass. There is a considerable community of software developers, many of whom use incredibly sophisticated programs to model disease spread and interventions, and measure subsequent population consequences. However, the modelling of irregular events, such as deliberate release, is very difficult and often unreliable.",

The CCS works in association with a wide range of governmental organisations which are centrally coordinated in order to enable continued evaluation and development of government policy. Regional Resilience Teams have also been set up in each of the main governmental organisations and work with local authorities, the emergency services and other key agencies to ensure that the region is prepared to deal with emergencies ( Fig. 4 .5). These Regional Resilience Teams support the formation of Regional Resilience Forums, which are made up of central government agencies, the armed forces, the emergency services and local authorities to provide a multi-agency strategic direction to civil protection planning.The CCS maintains the UK Resilience website which provides advice on emergency preparedness, and emergency response and recovery operations. The site provides important guidance on a wide range of emergencies including terrorist and CBRN incidents, and industrial accidents. Further information can be found at the UK Resilience website: www.ukresilience.gov.ukThe Hazardous Area Response Team (HART) is a Department of Health (DH) programme being introduced in phases across NHS Ambulance Trusts in England. The first of these were established in London and Yorkshire. The Ambulance Service Association Civil Contingencies Committee (ASA-CCC) and DH have worked together since 2004 to establish the programme which provides two main resources: an Incident Response Unit (HART-IRU) and Urban Search and Rescue (HART-USAR). Further information on the HART programme can be found by visiting the HART website: www. ambulancehart.orgThe Government Decontamination Service (GDS) is an agency set up to assist local and regional authorities that are responsible for carrying out decontamination and recovery following a deliberate or 4 Responding to Terrorism: A Medical Handbook 226 accidental CBRN release. It also advises central government on the UK's capability to respond to such incidents. The GDS provides both generic and incident-specific advice on the decontamination of the open and built environment and other infrastructure. In contrast, human decontamination is the responsibility of the DH and the emergency services. Further information regarding the GDS can be found by visiting the website: www.defra.gov.uk/gdsThe DH has no statutory responsibility in the event of a biological incident. However, it does take overall responsibility for public health and for offering advice and acting to limit the public health consequences of such incidents.
