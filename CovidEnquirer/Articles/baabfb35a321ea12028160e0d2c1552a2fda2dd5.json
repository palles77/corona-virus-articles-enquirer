Abnormal liver functions were frequently reported extrapulmonary clinical feature and almost one half of patients experienced different degrees of liver function damage. 8, 9 .According to the recent study of single-cell RNAseq , angiotensin converting enzyme(ACE)2 was highly expressed not only in type II alveolar epithelial cells, but also in bile duct cells. 10 Importantly, recent study confirmed that the cell entry receptor of 2019-nCoV, like SARS-CoV, is ACE2 receptor. 11 All these findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may infect the bile duct cells and cause the abnormal liver function in these patients. However, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), the bile duct injury related index, was not specific in COVID-19 patients . 8, 9 .A recent pathological finding reported that moderate microvascular steatosis and mild lobular and portal activity were present in liver biopsy specimens, indicating that the liver injury could be caused by either SARS-CoV-2 infection or drug-induced liver injury. 12 Currently, however, there is no any clinical research to analyze whether abnormal liver function in COVID-19 patients is due to the drugs used or not. Given the high contagious and pathogenic capacities of SARS-CoV-2 and high incidence of liver damage, an analysis with liver function in COVID patients is urgently warranted.",

Many patients were applied with other antiviral and antipyretic drugs. However, both antiviral drugs and acetaminophen have adverse reactions, such as liver function injury. [24] [25] [26] Previous studies have not further analyzed whether these patients with abnormal liver function are caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection or by the drugs used. In this study, the drugs used by patients before admission are mainly antibacterial drugs (including moxifloxacin, cephalosporins), antiviral drugs (abidol, oseltamivir, acyclovir), and antipyretic drugs with acetaminophen. We analyzed the prehospital medications of the two groups and found that there is no statistical difference between the two groups. Therefore, we speculated that the liver function damage of COVID-19 patients is closely related to virus infection. In addition, the proportion of male patients with liver damage was large, and the specific mechanism was unclear. The body temperature of patients with liver damage was significantly higher than that of the control group, which may be related to the immune response after virus infection.",

In view of another article on antiviral effect in our hospital, lopinavir/ritonavir has no effect on the negative conversion rate of SARS-CoV-2. 28 For this reason, we tend not to recommend lopinavir/ritonavir as a common clinical treatment drug for COVID-19, even in mild patients with normal liver function.

The phenotypic analysis of lymphocytes (CD4+, CD8+, CD3+ T cells) in peripheral blood was performed by a flow cytometry (BD Biosciences; San Diego, CA, USA). We defined abnormal liver damage as any parameter more than the upper limit of normal value (ULN) of ALT (40 U/L), AST(35 U/L), ALP (100 U /L), GGT (45 U/L), TB (20.5 umol/L), LDH (245 U/L).",
