The results from 57 hospitals show that EDI usage is in its very early stages. The study provides possible reasons for the low EDI usage from cultural, economic, and technological perspectives, analyzes the differences of EDI usage in the different levels of China's hospitals, and suggests strategies to promote EDI usage in China's healthcare organizations. r",

Prior studies have used various instruments to measure the extent of organizational EDI usage (Cox & Ghoneim, 1995; Hart & Saunders, 1998; Johnson, Allen, & Crum, 1992; Massetti & Zmud, 1996) . These instruments assess four dimensions of EDI usage, which include volume, diversity, breadth, and depth. In early studies, the four dimensions were rarely aggregated in a unified approach which would allow a comprehensive understanding of EDI usage. In an attempt to build a linkage between EDI strategies and operations, Massetti and Zmud (1996) proposed an EDI measurement approach integrating all four dimensions. The framework of EDI measurement used in this research is based upon Massetti and Zmud's approach, with modifications to adapt the framework to our research context.",

Despite the fact that application-to-application EDI and the coupled work environment are likely to be more efficient than file-to-file EDI, they require more highly trained employees, greater network bandwidth, and more open-minded hospital policy.

This question classifies the depth of an EDI document into three incremental levels: (1) data, (2) data and text, and (3) data, text, and image. The three levels are based on the complexity and objective of the task for which an EDI document serves. At the first level, the task is simple and usually serves for simple hospital administration. For example, the payroll transfers between departments only require numbers and few texts. At the second level, the task is more complicated and serves for some administrative functions and most medical document exchange. For example, departmental monthly reports and patients medical records require a large amount of data and texts. At the third level, the task is mainly for medical purpose, especially telemedicine which not only requires text-based information but also multimedia information. For example, physicians performing telediagnosis for a patient with a broken spine need the patient's medical records, vital signs, symptoms, CT images, and MRI images in order to make an accurate diagnosis. Therefore, this question can differentiate EDI usage at the file-to-file level and indicate the depth of hospitals' EDI usage.",

These managers think that exchanging data electronically among different departments within one organization enables the organization to exchange data electronically with other organizations.

Forty-eight Level III hospitals (approximately 77.4% of Beijing's Level III hospitals) were selected for our sample because they are more likely to adopt EDI (Hellbruck & Schoder, 2001) . Considering other hospitals in Beijing also have the opportunity to use EDI, we selected 13 Level II hospitals and seven Level I hospitals. Consequently, 70.6% of our sample were Level III hospitals, 19.1% Level II, and 10.3% Level I. The Level III hospitals consisted of 33 comprehensive hospitals and 15 specialized hospitals. All the Level II hospitals were comprehensive hospitals. The Level I hospitals included five comprehensive and two specialized hospitals.",

The results of this study show only 11.6 document types on average are handled through EDI connections. The majority of document types are still manually processed, implying a large space for improvement for EDI development in China's hospitals. Similarly, the low percentages (less than 25%) of EDI breadth denote that the hospitals have established EDI connections with only a very limited number of trading partners. This finding implies that the adoption of EDI is still in its early stage for both the hospitals and other firms. In addition, most hospitals only use EDI at the file-to-file level. At this level, 93.0% of the EDI documents do not contain image information, indicating that EDI is mostly used to support hospital administration and simple professional healthcare tasks. These findings suggested that EDI has been adopted by a number of hospitals in China, but its usage is at a relatively low level. Given that high-level hospitals have more resources, we anticipate that Level III hospitals should exceed Level I and Level II hospitals in all of the four dimensions of EDI usage. Surprisingly, few differences were identified among the three hospital levels. Other than the fact that Level III hospitals have significantly greater EDI volumes in purchasing and IT and a greater EDI depth, there are no other statistically significant differences among hospital levels. The results of differences among hospital levels are interpreted with great caution because a convenience sample was used which might not represent the general population of hospitals in Beijing. For example, seven Level I hospitals were selected from a total of 230; it is very likely that this sample was biased. A plausible explanation of the lack of EDI differences between Level III hospitals and lower-level hospitals is that those Level I and Level II (especially Level I) hospitals who sent their managers for continuous education in Beijing University are likely to be the ones who put more emphasis on technology and have more resources. These Level I and Level II hospitals may tend to be champions with respect to leveraging advanced information technologies; therefore, the level of their EDI usage is shown in this study to be close to that of the Level III hospitals. Nevertheless, the major objective of this paper is to depict the EDI usage status in China's hospitals. The selection of Beijing and the inclusion of more Level III hospitals enable us to study a sample where EDI usage would more likely be great. Based on a reasonable analysis of the sample, it can be inferred from the results that in general the various aspects of EDI usage in China's hospitals will be less than the extent of EDI usage in our sample.",

First, the Chinese people's cultural assumptions and social issues might inhibit EDI usage. In China, businesses, especially in the B2B sector, operate to a large extent on the basis of personal relationships. The Chinese people build friendships with each other before undertaking any serious business initiatives. Using EDI to conduct B2B transactions can often involve unfamiliar or new trading partners, which is incongruent with the Chinese business culture. Given the great geographical expansion and heterogeneous traditions in China, people living in different regions have dissimilar beliefs. Companies that are not located close to each other are reluctant to do business with each other using manual methods because of trust concerns, let alone using EDI. This trust hurdle will not be easily overcome in a short period of time in China.",

When patient data are involved, security and confidentiality become a more sensitive issue. China has no regulations to define the legitimacy of electronic patient records (EPR) and control the exchange of EPR, which has greatly impeded the electronic communication among hospitals, employers, and insurance agencies.

Shifting from traditional business to electronic business can profoundly change an organization's structure and business processes, which is perceived highly risky. Labor in China is so cheap that the start-up costs of EDI can be higher than the labor costs. As a result, the perceived benefits of EDI such as reduced costs and automated business processes may not be attractive enough to justify EDI adoption. A related issue of EDI adoption in China is the unemployment dilemma. The high unemployment rate is currently a big problem facing China (Smyth, 1999) .

In the US and many European countries, the HL7 standards have become the main EDI standard for healthcare systems (Spyrou et al., 2002) . IT infrastructure inadequacy is another technological obstacle for EDI adoption. Compared with other industries in China, healthcare organizations demonstrate the minimal level of leased-line connectivity (Foster & Goodman, 2000) . According to United Nation, high Internet access cost, restrictions on Internet services, slow and uncertain delivery of network connections, lack of awareness of perceived benefits, and lack of knowledge of e-commerce technology are reasons for the delay of e-readiness in developing countries (UnitedNations, 2001 ).

In an effort to augment the understanding of EDI adoption in China's hospitals, the differences between hospital levels are discussed next. This study did show some differences between the Level III hospitals and the lower-level hospitals, although these differences were much less than expected. Based on the authors' observation, the differences among hospital levels can be illustrated in three aspects: resources availability, government-driven adoption, and market position. First, Level III hospitals have more resources, thus more capabilities to implement EDI than lower-level hospitals (Level I and Level II). The resources include financial resources, human resources, and IT resources. Second, Level III hospitals tend to be early adopters of information systems due to the government's requests. In China, it is a common strategy for the MOH and local governments to use several Level III hospitals to develop or experiment with innovations. If the experiments are successful, the Level III hospitals will become ''model hospitals'' and their experiences will be shared by other hospitals which will become followers. For example, the China Golden Health project requires high-level hospitals to take initiatives earlier than low-level hospitals. This national project entails building hospital information systems, insurance accounting and payment networks, and telemedicine, and the objective is to electronically link stakeholders in the healthcare systems to improve management and quality of care. Given that Level III hospitals are early innovators taking part in this project, it is a rational anticipation that they will have more inter-and intra-organizational electronic connectivity than lower-level hospitals.",

For example, outpatient registration fees are determined by the healthcare policy in China. The registration fee difference between Level III hospitals and lower-level hospitals is approximately USD $0.2. Since the fee difference is so small, many patients are willing to pay more to go to Level III hospitals where they think better care can be provided. As a result, Level I and Level II hospitals have few outpatient visits while Level III hospitals have long waiting lines. This situation affects hospitals' strategic foci. For Level III hospitals, the focus is likely to be on performance improvement by leveraging IT so that their competitive advantages can be sustained. For lower-level hospitals, patient attraction is a critical issue with the first priority and they are more likely to invest on marketing rather than IT. By explicating these three differences, some insights are offered regarding the phenomena of EDI usage in the different levels of hospitals.",

For example, one well-known large hospital (Level III) in Beijing developed and installed a hospital information system. The hardware configuration included two IBM servers, one with 128 megabytes of main memory and four gigabytes of hard drive capacity, and the other with 512 megabytes of main memory and 10 gigabytes of hard drive capacity. These servers are simply not powerful enough to support information-intensive tasks such as EDI. In addition, the client computers at this hospital have only 16 megabytes of main memory and 540 megabytes of hard drive capacity. With such a limited hardware configuration, the online transaction speed will be greatly affected and the advantages of information systems in general, and EDI in particular, cannot be realized. Greater IT investment may occur after managers of healthcare organizations are convinced of the return on investment of building an effective organizational IT infrastructure.",

Institutes in the US and Europe have developed several standards in the healthcare domain to facilitate inter-organizational information exchange. Considering differences in languages and health policies, however, these standards might not be appropriate for EDI transactions conducted among Chinese healthcare organizations. A strategic approach for China is to join the efforts from several leading healthcare organizations to form a standard development organization. The purpose of this organization is to create EDI standards that are compliant with international standards and characterized by China's unique situations. With such standards in place, the document transformation tasks will be easier and the communication among organizations will be enhanced.",

China's healthcare information networks were criticized because they did not transfer critical disease information in a timely way and failed to allow healthcare providers to share medical knowledge effectively. Even inside the boundaries of a hospital, the ineffective information flow has delayed informing physicians and other staff. By our definition, exchanging medical information both within and among healthcare organizations belongs to the domain of EDI. Because of the massive destruction caused by SARS and the criticality of information sharing in the healthcare sector under a national and international emergency situation, research that looks into IT usage, especially inter-organizational IT usage such as EDI,",

There is a tremendous market opportunity waiting to be exploited. However, China's unique context should be understood before rolling out any marketing operations. The depiction of EDI usage in different levels of China's hospitals is expected to give the health IT vendors a picture of China's healthcare IT market. Finally, the four-dimension assessment of EDI usage provides a framework that can be exploited to evaluate IT assimilation in healthcare organizations. For China and other developing countries that are seeking for more healthcare IT assimilation, this framework can offer a comprehensive view and help identify the weak dimensions.",
