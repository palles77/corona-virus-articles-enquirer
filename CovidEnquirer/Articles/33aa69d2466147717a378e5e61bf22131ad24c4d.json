This bond is a polar covalent bond with concentration of the electron density around oxygen which is one of the most electronegative atoms. This arrangement gives water molecule a dipolar character where oxygen atom is the negative pole and hydrogen atoms are the positive poles. This dipole character enables water molecules to be connected among themselves by intermolecular forces called hydrogen bonds. Hydrogen bonds are a relatively strong type of intermolecular interaction in which hydrogen atom from a certain molecule is connected to an electronegative atom (such as oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine) of another molecule.",

Thus, water molecules are joined together in an extensive three-dimensional network in which each oxygen atom is approximately tetrahedrally bonded to four hydrogen atoms, two by covalent bonds and two by hydrogen bonds. This confers on water its unique physical and chemical properties that will be discussed in the next sections (Chang, 2010; Ebbing and Gammon, 2009; Manahan, 2000) . Table 1 summarizes some of the basic physical properties of water. Most of these properties are highly affected by temperature. Therefore, some values are given at different temperatures. Also the effect of these properties on Boiling point 100\u00b0C at 1 atm water behavior is highlighted briefly (Chang, 2010; Ebbing and Gammon, 2009; Manahan, 2000; Venkateswariu, 2003) .",

Water evaporates into the atmosphere and forms clouds above the ocean. Additional water is drawn from the soil by plants, and is then evaporated into the atmosphere from leaves and stems in a process called transpiration. As the air rises and the temperature drops, the moisture-laden air condenses, forming clouds and eventually resulting in precipitation. Precipitation is the term applied to all forms of moisture falling to the ground such as rain, snow, sleet, and hail.",

Other times, the raindrop rests in deep river pools or lakes, is taken up by plants and animals, or enters the atmosphere again through evaporation. Other water seeps downward into the soil. This process is called infiltration. If the rock below the soil is permeable, then the water percolates the rock and is stored as groundwater. Ultimately, all water makes its way back to the ocean, which is like a giant reservoir. Water is stored in the ocean until it is delivered to the land as a result of evaporation and precipitation and the cycle continues (Davis and Cornwell, 2012; Manahan, 2000; Vigil, 2003) .",

The presence of suspended materials such as clay, slit, finely divided organic material, plankton, and other inorganic materials in water is called turbidity. Turbidity is a measure of the clarity of water. Low-turbidity water is clear, while high turbidity water is cloudy or murky. The unit of measuring turbidity is turbidity unit (TU). Turbidity larger than 5 TU is easily detected in a glass of water and is objectionable for aesthetic reasons (Davis, 2010; Davis and Cornwell, 2012) .",

Point source pollutants are all dry-weather pollutants that enter watercourses through pipes or channels. Point source pollution comes mainly from industrial facilities and municipal wastewater treatment plants. Storm drainage, agricultural runoff, construction sites, and other land disturbances are considered nonpoint source pollution (Weiner and Matthews, 2003) .",

Heated effluents lower the solubility of oxygen in water because gas solubility in water is inversely proportional to temperature, thus reducing the amount of dissolved oxygen available to oxygen-dependent species.

Oxygen consumed in the decomposition process robs other aquatic organisms of the oxygen they need to live. Organisms that are more tolerant of lower dissolved oxygen levels may thrive in a diversity of natural water systems including aerobic bacteria. Most of them feed on dead algae and other dead organisms and are part of the decomposition cycle. Algae and other organism can produce oxygen through photosynthesis using the energy of sun. At night they use up oxygen in respiration. Therefore, there is a continuous competition between the consumption of oxygen and its production through photosynthesis.

The initial oxygen concentration is measured and the sample stored in darkness (to avoid photosynthetic oxygen generation) at 20\u00b0C for 5 days. Over the 5-day period, the oxygen concentration is measured at regular intervals and at the end of the 5-day period. The difference in oxygen concentration between the beginning and the end of the 5-day test period, taking due account of dilution, gives the BOD 5 (American Public Health Association (APHA), 2012).

The global phosphorus cycle (Fig. 4) could be summarized in the following steps: 1. Phosphorus starts out in rocks and then phosphates are washed off the rocks over a period of time by weathering and rain. After that, phosphate is distributed into soil and water. 2. Plants then take up phosphate from the soil, and animals may consume these plants. When this happens, the phosphate becomes imbedded into organic molecules (DNA). When plants and animals die and decompose, phosphate will return to the soil. 3. Organic forms of phosphate can be made accessible to plants by bacteria which break down the organic matter. Once this happens, the phosphate is changed to an inorganic form of phosphorus (this is known as mineralization). 4. Once the phosphorus is in the soil, it can be transferred to waterways and then oceans. After this phosphorus can be integrated into sediments and rock and the cycle starts again. The cycle is largely affected by the production and use of fertilizers made from phosphorus and animal manure that contains phosphorus. Soil cannot absorb all the fertilizers, so it eventually gets washed away with other surface runoff. This will cause an increased amount of phosphorus in the water bodies. Consequently, eutrophication will occur.",

Aerobic bacteria (that use oxygen for living) will use all available dissolved oxygen in the process of decomposing this material, and the dissolved oxygen may be depleted enough to cause the bottom of the lake to become anaerobic. As more and more algae die, and more and more dissolved oxygen is used in their decomposition, the middle layer of the lake may also become anaerobic (do not need molecular oxygen for living). When this happens, aerobic biological activity will be restricted on the surface layer only.

Filtration plant employs the following steps: a. Rapid mixing: where chemicals are added and rapidly dispersed through the water b. Flocculation: Chemicals like alum (aluminum sulfate) are added to the water both to neutralize the particles electrically and to make them come close to each other and form large particles called flocs that could more readily be settled out c. Sedimentation: During sedimentation, floc settles to the bottom of the water supply, due to its weight d. Filtration: Once the floc has settled to the bottom of the water supply, the clear water on top will pass through filters of varying compositions (sand, gravel, and charcoal) and pore sizes in order to remove fine particles that were not settled, such as dust, parasites, bacteria, viruses, and chemicals e. Disinfection: involves the addition of chemicals in order to kill or reduce the number of pathogenic organisms Softening plants utilize the same operational unit as filtration plants but use different chemicals in order to remove water hardness (Davis, 2010; Davis and Cornwell, 2012; Weiner and Matthews, 2003) .",

Secondary treatment is typically achieved using biological processes. These processes could occur naturally in wastewater. Nevertheless, secondary treatments are designed to speed up these natural processes. Although secondary treatment may remove 85% of BOD 5 and suspended solids, it does not remove significant amount of nitrogen, phosphorous, or heavy metals, nor does it completely remove pathogenic bacteria and viruses. -Advance treatments or tertiary wastewater treatment: these processes are normally applied when secondary treatment is not adequate. Some of these processes may remove up to 99% of BOD 5 and phosphorous, all suspended solids and bacteria, and 95% of nitrogen. They can produce sparkling clean, colorless, and odorless effluent indistinguishable in appearance from high-quality drinking water. Some of these processes involve: Filtration or application of adsorbent such as activated carbon in order to remove persistent organic pollutants. Tertiary treatment may involve addition of chemicals such as ferric chloride or alum to enhance the removal of phosphorous. Nitrogen control step could be added to the tertiary treatment plant in order to facilitate the removal of nitrogen. This step could be accomplished biologically or chemically. The biological step is called nitrification/denitrification. Specific types of bacteria must be present to cause these two reactions to occur. The chemical process is called ammonia stripping; in this process nitrogen is removed in the form of ammonia by raising the pH of the solution by addition of base such as lime to covert ammonium ion to ammonia (Davis, 2010; Davis and Cornwell, 2012) .",

In general, prokaryotes are structurally simpler and smaller than eukaryotes. The DNA (genetic material) of prokaryotes is usually in a single, circularly arranged chromosome and is not surrounded by a membrane; therefore, they do not have true nucleolus. They also lack membrane-enclosed organelles (specialized structures that carry on various activities). Their cell walls almost always contain the complex polysaccharide peptidoglycan. They usually divide by binary fission. During this process, the DNA is copied, and the cell splits into two. On the other hand, the DNA of eukaryotes is found in multiple chromosomes in a membrane-enclosed nucleus. Plants and animals are entirely composed of eukaryotic cells (Hogg, 2005; Madigan et al., 2014; Tortora et al., 2010; Willey et al., 2016) .",

The order, family, and tribe names begin with capital letters. The genus name also begins with capital letter, but species name (e.g., coli) begins with running letter and not capital letter. Both the genus (e.g., Escherichia) and species names are either italicized or underlined when written in the text. The scientific name of the bacterium when written for the first time is written in full (e.g., Escherichia coli), but later mentioned in an abbreviated form (e.g., E. coli). Because this system gives two names to each organism, the system is called binomial nomenclature. When bacteria are referred to as a group, their names are neither capitalized nor italicized nor underlined (e.g., streptococci) (Hogg, 2005; Madigan et al., 2014; Tortora et al., 2010; Willey et al., 2016) .",

Spiral bacteria have one or more twists; they are never straight. Bacteria that look like curved rods are called vibrios. Others, called spirilla, have a helical shape, like a corkscrew, and fairly rigid bodies. Another group of spirals are helical and flexible; they are called spirochetes. Spirochetes move by means of axial filaments, which resemble flagella but are contained within a flexible external sheath. In addition to the three basic shapes, there are starshaped cells, rectangular cells, flat cells, and triangular cells (Hogg, 2005; Madigan et al., 2014; Parija, 2012; Tortora et al., 2010; Willey et al., 2016) . mostly water by composition. However, they have a semifluid nature due to a suspension of carbohydrates, enzymes, inorganic ions, lipids, and proteins. Within this suspension we can find the following: -The nuclear region which consists mostly of genetic material in one large and circular chromosome. In addition to the chromosome, some bacteria have small molecules of genetic material called plasmids that may include genes encoding toxins or resistance to antibiotics. -Ribosomes are small spherical bodies that serve as sites for protein synthesis. -Inclusions which accumulate certain nutrients when they are plentiful and use them when the environment is deficient. -Endospores which form in certain bacteria such as Bacillus and Clostridium. They are dormant forms of the cell that are highly resistant to extremes of temperature, pH, and other environmental factors, and germinate into new bacterial cells when conditions become more favorable. b. The cell membrane or plasma membrane is a flexible semipermeable membrane that surrounds the cytoplasm. The cell membrane contains two different layers that regulate the movement of substances in and out of the cell. The outer layer is hydrophilic (water loving), while the inner layer is hydrophobic (water fearing). Together, these layers form a protective and regulating barrier between the cytoplasm and the environment. c. Cell wall is an extremely porous and rigid structure that lies outside the cell membrane. The cell wall performs three functions. Firstly, it provides protection. Secondly, it maintains the characteristic shape of the cell. Thirdly, it prevents the cell from bursting when fluids flow into the cytoplasm. d. A variety of external structures: bacterial cells might have several external structures such as the axial filament, capsule, flagella, glycocalyx, and pili. All external structures perform specific functions, but these structures are not necessarily found in all bacteria. Based upon chemical composition of the cell walls, there are two types of bacteria, Gram negative and Gram positive. Gram-positive bacteria retain the crystal violet stain after the Gram-staining technique due to their thick cell wall layer of peptidoglycan. Gram-negative bacteria on the other hand, cannot retain the crystal violet stain due to their thin cell wall that has a very thin layer of peptidoglycan, and this layer is reinforced with a second membrane on top. Gram-negative bacteria are stained red with Safranin at the end of the Gram-staining technique (Parija, 2012; Tortora et al., 2010; Willey et al., 2016) .",

ATP molecule (Fig. 10) consists of an adenine, a ribose, and three phosphate groups. The terminal phosphate group requires a lot of energy for its formation and is often referred to as a high-energy phosphate bond.

All living cells must carry out cellular respiration. Respiration could be aerobic or anaerobic according to the availability of oxygen. Prokaryotic cells carry out cellular respiration within the cytoplasm or on the inner surfaces of the cells. In eukaryotic cells the mitochondria are the site of most of the reactions. The energy currency of these cells is ATP, and one way to view the outcome of cellular respiration is as a production process for ATP. Prokaryotes take the carbohydrates into their cytoplasm, and through a complex series of metabolic processes, they break down the carbohydrate and release the energy. The energy is generally not needed immediately, so it is used to combine ADP with phosphate ions to form ATP molecules. During the process of cellular respiration, carbon dioxide is given off as a waste product. This carbon dioxide can be used by photosynthesizing cells to form new carbohydrates. Also in the process of cellular respiration, oxygen gas is required to serve as an acceptor of electrons. This oxygen gas is identical to the oxygen gas given off in photosynthesis (Hogg, 2005; Madigan et al., 2014; Tortora et al., 2010; Willey et al., 2016) .",

            "text": "The overall mechanism of cellular respiration involves four subdivisions: a. Glycolysis, in which glucose is oxidized to two molecules of pyruvate with the synthesis of two molecules of ATP. Glycolysis is summarized in Fig. 11 . After glycolysis, two options are present depending on the amount of available oxygen. In the presence of oxygen, the cell will undergo aerobic respiration. Without a supply of oxygen, as in an anaerobic environment, the cell will undergo fermentation (Hogg, 2005; Madigan et al., 2014; Tortora et al., 2010; Willey et al., 2016) . b. Krebs cycle, citric acid cycle (CAC), or the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle: which results in formation of (per two molecules of pyruvic acid) two ATP molecules, six NADH molecules, and two FADH 2 molecules and six CO 2 molecules. The NADH and the FADH 2 will be used in the electron transport system (Hogg, 2005; Madigan et al., 2014; Tortora et al., 2010; Willey et al., 2016) . The main steps of Krebs cycle could be summarized as in Fig. 12 . c. Electron transport: In this step NADH and FADH produced in both glycolysis and the Krebs cycle are now being used. Electron transfer takes place in mitochondria in eukaryotic cells. The process is the same in prokaryotes, but it just happens at the main cell membrane. Cytochromes and coenzymes act as carrier molecules and transfer molecules. They accept high-energy electrons and pass the electrons to the next molecule in the system. At key proton-pumping sites, the energy of the electrons transport protons across the cell membrane to the outside (Hogg, 2005; Madigan et al., 2014; Tortora et al., 2010; Willey et al., 2016) . d. Chemiosmosis, in which the energy given off by electrons is used to pump protons across a membrane and provide the energy for ATP synthesis. During cellular respiration (Krebs cycle reactions, the electron transport system, and chemiosmosis), 36 molecules of ATP can be produced for each glucose molecule. Additional two ATP molecules are produced through glycolysis, so the net yield is 38 molecules of ATP. These ATP molecules may then be used in the cell for its needs. However, the ATP molecules cannot be stored for long periods of time, so cellular respiration must constantly continue in order to regenerate the ATP molecules as they are used. Each ATP molecule is capable of releasing 7.3 kcal of energy per mole (Hogg, 2005; Madigan et al., 2014; Tortora et al., 2010; Willey et al., 2016) .",

The organisms use the light energy, water molecules, NADP + , ADP, and phosphate to produce ATP, NADH, and oxygen molecule. -The Dark reaction or carbon fixing reaction. In this reaction, organisms use ATP and NADH produced in the light reaction plus carbon dioxide absorbed from the atmosphere to produce carbohydrates, mainly glucose (Hogg, 2005; Madigan et al., 2014; Tortora et al., 2010; Willey et al., 2016) . Carbon fixation reaction is usually referred to as CO 2 fixation or Calvin cycle. Calvin cycle (Fig. 13) is the cycle in which carbon is fixed, reduced, and utilized. It involves enzymatically regulated chemical reaction used by autotrophic microorganisms for CO 2 fixation. The cycle produces phosphoglycerate and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate molecules which are subsequently used to synthesize all the organic compounds needed by the cell. Each turn of the cycle results in the fixation of one molecule of CO 2 . Therefore, to synthesize one glucose molecule, the cycle must operate six times (Hogg, 2005; Madigan et al., 2014; Tortora et al., 2010; Willey et al., 2016) . Fig. 13 shows the net outcomes of six cycles. The energy generated in the catabolic pathways will be used by cells to manufacture the cellular components (biosynthesis) such as: nitrogenous substances, including proteins and nucleic acids, carbohydrates, including complex polysaccharides (such as capsules and the peptidoglycan of the cell wall), and Phospholipids which are components of the cytoplasmic membrane.",

In a pure culture medium, cells are placed in a liquid medium in which the nutrients and environmental conditions are controlled to allow the reproduction of single species of microorganisms. If the medium supplies all nutrients required for growth and environmental parameters are optimal, the increase in numbers or bacterial mass can be measured as a function of time. The representation of the increase in numbers or bacterial mass as a function of time is called a growth curve. Several distinct growth phases can be observed within a growth curve as can be seen in Fig. 16 . These includes the lag phase, the exponential or log phase, the stationary phase, and the death phase. Each of these phases represents a distinct period of growth that is associated with typical physiological changes in the cell culture (Davies, 2005; Davis Fig. 16 Growth curve. and Cornwell, 2012; Hogg, 2005; Madigan et al., 2014; Tortora et al., 2010; Willey et al., 2016) .",

Induction of QS gene system requires the accumulation of signaling molecules called autoinducers such as acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) or peptide pheromone. For example, Gram-negative bacteria adapt luxI/luxR gene signaling system using AHLs autoinducers. Lux gene is initially expressed in low levels, leading to the production of small number of lux proteins including luxI and luxR. luxI code for synthesis of autoinducer AHL. Autoinducer molecules rapidly diffuse out of the cell. The more the number of cells is in a given space, the faster the inducers build up and the more likely they reenter the cells, bind to receptor, and stimulate the expression of luxR. LuxR protein will stimulate the expression of many genes including those for inducer synthesis. The produced gene could trigger many cellular activities such as the formation of biofilms. It has been suggested that biofilm formation results from a developmental program of gene expression. In addition, biofilm development and maintenance have been shown to require a wide range of genetic determinants and to involve bacterial subpopulations carrying out different functions. Quorum sensing was found to play a significant role in coordinating biofilm formation for many species (Donlan, 2002; Irie and Parsek, 2008; Li and Tian, 2012) .",

However, it was found that some pathogens, especially viruses and protozoan (Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium), are more resistant than coliforms to chlorination. This emerges the need for using alternative disinfectant (i.e., chlorine dioxide) or coupling of more than one disinfectant in the disinfection steps.",

This process is accomplished by aerobic heterotrophic bacteria. -Nitrification which involves the oxidation of ammonia to nitrate. Aerobic autotrophic bacteria must be predominant to carry out nitrification. Two genera are commonly recognized. Ammonia is oxidized to nitrite by Nitrosomonas. Nitrite is oxidized to nitrate by Nitrobacter. -Denitrification involves the reduction of nitrate to nitric oxide, nitrous oxide, and nitrogen gas. A large number of genera are capable of denitrification, either heterotrophic or autotrophic. Pseudomonas is the most common species. -Phosphorous removal: in this process phosphorus is incorporated into cell biomass that is subsequently removed from the process.
