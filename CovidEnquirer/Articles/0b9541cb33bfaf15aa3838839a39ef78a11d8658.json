Therefore, we investigated the barriers currently hindering the willingness to develop orphan drugs in the Netherlands. To this end, a robust, small sample, exploratory analysis of Dutch multi-actor development of orphan drugs was performed. Various factors that were expected to stimulate the adoption of orphan drug development were found to be important barriers. Concerted actions of producers, users, and especially regulators are necessary to overcome these barriers, but the prerequisite of a shared problem definition is lacking.",

            "text": "In various instances, market conditions fail to produce incentives for the development and production of products (goods and/or services) that are demanded in Western societies. If such market imperfections occur with respect to generally desired products, such as security, healthcare, housing and environment, then governments often develop policies and measures to sustain the supply of these products. These governmental policies and measures are developed using juridical rules, taxation, subsidies, and public financing, and aim to increase the accessibility of these products for the general public. Decision-making concerning such gov-ernmental policies and measures can be analyzed using public-choice theory (Arrow, 1963; Olson, 1966) . The dilemma to be solved by public-choice theory is between the efficacy of reaching those societal groups that need but cannot afford these products and the efficiency of putting a (financial) burden on those groups that do not need or want these products in order to produce them. This dilemma becomes more complicated if there is only a (very) small societal need for such products but a large societal moral pressure to provide them, for example, clean air in isolated, heavily polluted industrial areas, and healthcare for rare diseases. This is particularly true when these products must be provided by private enterprises at large costs within networks in which many other interested groups are involved, such as research institutes, governmental agencies, and pressure groups. In these cases, firm behavior is not only dependent on external incentives, such as governmental policies and measures, but is also dependent on the characteristics of the network in which these firms operate. In addition, if new products are needed, then the functioning of the network -the product-related innovation system -in which the firms participate becomes particularly important. Also, not only juridical and financial measures determine the functioning of that innovation system but also knowledge production and diffusion, learning, coordination of activities, and demand articulation by organizing consumer demand. Consequently, the successful operation of such an innovation system depends on various characteristics of the actors involved and their linkages. However, all these aspects may also contribute to the barriers that prevent an innovation system from becoming successful in providing publicly desired and privately produced new products.",

In 1998, an analysis by the Ministry of Economic Affairs showed that the Dutch biopharmaceutical sector was lagging behind neighboring countries, the main restrictions being that Dutch knowledge institutes lacked a business culture, the results of scientific research were seldom commercialized, there was not enough venture capital available for new life science companies, and there was a shortage of facilities, such as office and laboratory space (Ministry of Economic Affairs, 1999) . Therefore, in 2000, the BioPartner Network program was started to stimulate the start-up of biotech firms in the Netherlands. Today, the Dutch life sciences sector is still in an early stage of development and consists of about 160 primarily small, privately held, often lossmaking, entrepreneurial companies (BioPartner, 2005) . These start-up companies often begin as 'offspring' of Dutch academic research groups trying to commercialize new research findings in the biotechnological field. Dutch policy makers also realize that the failure rate of start-up firms is high, especially in a new technological field like biotechnology. But, it is expected that the surviving start-up firms will be able to grow and together contribute to the development of a new high-technology, knowledge-based industry within the Netherlands. Biopharmaceutical companies receive special attention in this policy because of their large knowledge content.",

To investigate causal effects in the conceptual model, Section 4 describes the applied research methodology. Interviews with knowledgeable actors in the field of orphan drug development provided a rather small dataset for analysis. To test the presumed causal effects in the conceptual model, this dataset has been analyzed by means of robust small sample statistical methods. Section 5 presents the results of these analyses together with their managerial and policy implications. These results are discussed in Section 6.

However, each of these diseases affects relatively few people. A rare disease is, according to European definition, a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition from which not more than one affected person per 2000 citizens in the European Union suffer. As only small numbers of people are affected, there are only small markets for drugs, and the high costs associated with drug development generally makes it unprofitable for pharmaceutical companies to develop drugs for these diseases. The medicinal products intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of rare disorders are commonly known as 'orphan drugs'. Several rare diseases are well described, such as cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's chorea, phenylketonuria (PKU), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

Pharming and the development of C1 inhibitor orphan drug for hereditary angioedema treatment Background and prevalence: Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a genetic disorder that causes shortage of a protein called C1 inhibitor. Patients suffer from recurrent attacks of oedema, causing swellings in the soft tissues of the body. This swelling can be extremely painful. When misdiagnosed it can lead to unnecessary surgical interference and costly hospital care. The disease can even be lethal if attacks in the throat area lead to asphyxiation. The prevalence of HAE is from 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 150,000, with an average of 1 in 30,000, which means that in the Western world some 22,000 patients suffer from it. Treatment: Androgens can help to prevent attacks of HAE but may cause serious side effects, such as excessive hair growth in women, menstrual disorders, infertility, hepatitis, and, in rare cases, liver cancer. Attacks are also treated with anti-fibrinolytics or plasma C1 inhibitor. Anti-fibrinolytics are associated with side effects such as nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and even thrombosis. In addition, the presently available C1 inhibitor protein is obtained from blood plasma. This implies a risk of transmission of pathogenic viruses and its availability is limited since human donor blood is scarce.",

            "text": "Several regulatory instruments have been developed to encourage the development of orphan drugs. The first of these instruments was the Orphan Drug Act (ODA) that was passed in the USA in 1983. The ODA offers significant incentives for (bio)pharmaceutical firms to develop drugs for rare diseases. These benefits include quick review by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a short approval time, tax credits, 7 years of market exclusivity for orphan indications of approved products and exemptions from drug registration fees for a company willing to develop an orphan drug. Furthermore, the FDA Office of Orphan Products Development (OOPD) has awarded research grants to both private and public parties to support clinical trials of orphan drugs. To qualify for these incentives, potential medicines first receive 'orphan designation' from the OOPD, and then go through the normal evaluation process for safety and efficacy (Haffner et al., 2002; Maeder, 2003) . Since the ODA came into effect, its impact on the development of orphan drugs has been tremendous. From 1983 to April 2005, a total of 269 orphan drugs received market approval in the USA and 1449 orphan designations were accepted (FDA, 2005) . Together, these 269 new drugs now provide help for more than 11 million people in the USA alone (Rinaldi, 2005 ). An EU legislative framework did not follow until December 1999, when the European Orphan Drug Regulation (EODR) was approved by the European Parliament (EU Regulation 141/2000; Binns and Driscoll, 2000; Sinnema, 2001) . The EODR incentives include 10 years' market exclusivity to orphan drugs, exemption from registration fees, technical assistance for development of the application file, and accelerated marketing procedures. Other provisions, such as tax breaks and grants towards clinical research costs were largely delegated to the member states (Rinaldi, 2005) . So far, approximately 270 drugs have been granted EU orphan designation, and about 23 of these have reached the market in 2005 (Pharmacos, 2005) .",

There are, however, two main concerns regarding orphan drugs. First, many orphan drugs are (very) expensive. Second, certain drugs that were originally approved in the USA as orphan drugs later became top sellers, either because the once rare condi-tion they were intended to treat increased in frequency, such as AZT to block HIV replication, or because the drugs, such as epoetin-alfa (EPO), proved effective against more common disorders (Lawton, 1992; Maeder, 2003) .",

Various university groups, including (bio)chemical, pharmaceutical, and molecular biology departments, are involved in the drug discovery processes. Research collaboration with academic hospitals, which can provide clinical data, is frequent. Relative to other countries, the Netherlands has shown ample scientific interest in rare diseases, the underlying molecular mechanisms, and possible therapeutic approaches. In particular, the Dutch research community has gained international recognition in the field of lysosomal storage disorders (Gaucher, Pompe, Fabry), other inheritable diseases (such as hemophilia), rare disorders in children (such as neurological diseases), and neonatal diseases (Leufkens and . University departments often cooperate with pharmaceutical companies by providing data on the pathogenesis of the disease, while leaving the actual development process of the drug to the pharmaceutical industry. Sometimes, universities have a role in subsequent stages of the drug development process, but this is mostly as a subcontractor conducting, for example, animal experiments for pharmaceutical firms. Furthermore, university medical centers often cooperate with academic hospitals in clinical trials.

Furthermore, academic hospitals have important roles in the clinical trials. These are often carried out in cooperation with pharmaceutical companies due to the high costs associated with testing large groups of patients and expensive registration procedures. In the Netherlands, more than 10 different research laboratories, university departments, and academic hospitals are active in orphan drug development (Orphanet, 2006). 4 Pharmaceutical companies have the most important roles in the development of medicinal drugs, often participating in every stage of the development process. Some companies study the pathogenesis of diseases themselves, but most firms obtain this knowledge from research institutes, university research, and academic hospitals, as this type of fundamental research is not very profitable for pharmaceutical firms. Most firms focus only on the development of specific pharmaceutical substances. In the next phase of drug development, some firms perform their own animal experiments, although it is not uncommon for firms to subcontract these experiments to universities and research institutes. Generally, phase I and II clinical trials are contracted out. For orphan drug development, phase I and II clinical trials often take place in academic hospitals because the hospitals are more familiar with the patients, often via specialized rare diseases centers. Many pharmaceutical firms also increasingly cooperate with patients' organizations (Meijer et al., 2001) . The pharmaceutical firms then use the know-how of these clinical centers and patient organizations for further development of the orphan drugs. So far, only two Dutch orphan drug projects have been granted an orphan drug designation, one project of Pharming Technologies (see Box 1) and one project of AMT, a \"spin-off\" company of the Academic Medical Center Amsterdam. 5 Patients' organizations are particularly important in increasing the awareness of a certain disease, especially in the case of orphan diseases (Lang and Wood, 1999 ). An inventory done by patients' organizations within the Netherlands in 1994 led to the preparation of an extensive list of orphan diseases. Furthermore, these organizations indicated the importance of further development of diagnostics, the collection of reliable data on the prevalence of orphan diseases, the further development of treatment methods based on genetic knowledge, and the mobilization of sufficiently large groups of patient in studies to establish the efficacy of orphan drugs. In addition, these organizations collect information on regulation as well as sources of financial support. They also have important roles in initiating and stimulating the cooperation between scientific researchers and the industry (RGO, 1998) . Furthermore, patients' organizations promote and stimulate the development of orphan drugs, and they are continuously trying to persuade the government and pharmaceutical companies to invest in orphan drug development. The Vereniging Samenwerkende Ouder-en Patientorganisaties (VSOP) is the Dutch Genetic Alliance, and is an umbrella organization of about 60 national, disease-linked, parent and patient organizations, most of which are concerned with genetic and/or congenital disorders. Rare disorders is a central field of interest (VSOP, 2005) . Examples of Dutch orphan-disease-related patient organizations are the Dutch Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (Nederlandse Cystische Fibrosis Stichting), the Dutch Fabry Support and Information Group (Fabry Support & Informatie Groep Nederland), the Dutch Gaucher Association (Gaucher Vereniging Nederland), and the Dutch Muscular Diseases Association (Vereniging Spierziekten Nederland). The European Platform for Patients' Organizations, Science and Industry (EPPOSI, 2005) is an EU patient-led partnership between patients, industry, and academic science institutes focusing on the treatment and prevention of serious diseases.",

            "text": "The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have also shown a clear interest in orphan diseases during the past few years. The adop-tion of the Programme of Community Action on Rare Diseases (1999 Diseases ( -2003 (COMP) was created as part of the EMEA, supporting the registration procedure of orphan drugs. In 1997, the former Minister of Health, Welfare and Sports (VWS) asked the Dutch Advisory Council on Health Research (RGO) to provide advice regarding the coordination, priority, and stimulation of research in the Netherlands with respect to orphan drugs. In 1998, the RGO advised the building of a national structure on orphan drugs. Therefore, the Steering Committee on Orphan Drugs (Stuurgroep Weesgeneesmiddelen) was appointed by the Minister of VWS in April 2001 for a period of at least 4 years. This committee is an independent organization and consists of 10 members and one observer. The members are representatives of patient organizations, pharmaceutical companies, physicians, hospital pharmacists, scientists, a representative of the Dutch Medicine Evaluation Board and a representative of the Dutch Health Insurance Board (WGM, 2005) . In January 2003, the Dutch Health Care Insurance Board (CVZ) compiled requirements regarding the reimbursement for orphan drugs (CVZ, 2003) . In the Netherlands, the Minister of Health, Welfare and Sports, advised by the Health Care Insurance Board (CVZ), decides whether a new product will be included in the National Health Insurance System. New drugs aiming for intramural treatment (treatment within the hospital), such as most orphan drugs, should be paid from the hospitals budgets. Orphan drugs often do not fit within these budgets, being expensive, often biotechnologically made products. Therefore, two Dutch policy measures have been introduced for the intramural use of drugs (one for expensive drugs and one for orphan drugs). In the case of expensive drugs in hospitals, 80% of the drug costs will be reimbursed. In the case of orphan drugs in academic hospitals, 95% of the drug costs will be reimbursed. When the Minister of VWS comes to decide on these policy measures, the Dutch 'College Tarieven Gezondheidszorg/Zorgauthoriteit i.o.' (CTG/Zaio) is the executive organization responsible for the policy measures for expensive drugs and orphan drugs. 6 Drugs for treatment outside the hospital (extramural) can be reimbursed by means of the Dutch Drugs Reimbursement System, called the 'Geneesmiddelenvergoedingssysteem' (GVS). Since 1 January 2006, a subsidy of 11 million euros has been allocated for the costs of European registered extramural orphan drugs for use in the Netherlands (CTG/Zaio, 2006) . 7 Despite the measures described above, the current situation in the Netherlands is that, although orphan drug development in the preclinical stage has increased, only the Dutch firm Pharming has a drug with orphan designation in the last phase of clinical trials (see Box 1). Phase III of clinical trials is still a barrier to market introduction for many orphan drugs. This is due to the small number of patients involved and the fact that most orphan drugs are developed by start-up firms. The small number of patients involved requires the cooperation of patients in many countries in a phase III clinical trial. But start-up firms are not very well connected to the international market and often experience severe difficulties organizing phase III clinical trials. Consequently, the development of orphan drugs can get stuck at the stage of phase III clinical trials. One solution to this problem is for the start-up firms to cooperate with large (foreign) pharmaceutical firms, which already have access to the international market. But such cooperation is not free and often results in mergers and take-overs of start-up firms by large pharmaceutical firms. Loss of independence and identity are then the unattractive consequences for the start-up firm.",

These conditions are reflected in expectations about potential customers (i.e. patients) and drug innovation, adoption, and diffusion. If large-scale drug adoption by patients is expected to be high, then the willingness to develop such a drug will be large for reasons of competitive advantage and returns on investments. Consequently, we apply the conceptual model of innovation adoption and diffusion developed in various successive innovation studies (Tornatzky and Klein, 1982; Moore and Benbasat, 1991; Rogers, 1995; Tidd et al., 2001) . For the purpose of this study, actual innovation adoption and diffusion in this model has been replaced by expected 8 innovation adoption and diffusion among customers, which is reflected in the producer's willingness to develop orphan drugs. By analyzing this conceptual model for various actor groups involved in different stages of orphan drug development, a multiactor perspective is chosen. In orphan drug development, three important actor groups can be identified: producers, regulators, and consumers.",

In addition, the influence of both other actor groups on the adoption of research and development activities into orphan drugs consists of affecting its causal factors. By focusing on the perceptions and behaviors of the three actor groups identified, the structuralistic and functionalistic approaches of (innovation) systems can be integrated into a system dynamics framework. The structuralistic approach considers system dynamics as a function of the structure of the system, which is made up of its institutional environment and (the perceptions of) their regulations and rules imposed on it. The functionalistic approach of systems conceives system dynamics as a function of interactions among its constituent subsystems and system elements. By linking the perceptions of regulations, rules, and other causes of (adoption) behavior to interactions among the three actor groups, the structuralistic and functionalistic perspectives on system dynamics become integrated. Effective system dynamics regarding the adoption of R&D activities necessary for orphan drug development can then be seen to depend on the degree of concerted actions among the three actor groups involved, which in turn depends on a shared view regarding how to develop orphan drugs. The shared view consists of the degree of agreement among the three actor groups about whether to develop orphan drugs and the extent to which the causal factors have a positive or negative effect. Concerted action then consists of adaptations of current behaviors of the actor groups to stimulate the willingness to develop orphan drugs of the producers. However, disagreement among the actor groups involved over the effects and relations of the causal factors will be conceived as innovation barriers in the development of orphan drugs. To identify such barriers to orphan drug development, these causal factors and their effects and relations are briefly described below.",

The different stages of this process are dominated by the goal to reduce uncertainty about the attributes of a new product through information gathering.

Orphan drugs are therapeutically necessary. Pharmaceutical companies have to cope with considerable financial uncertainties about whether they will receive sufficient revenues after market introduction to cover the initial R&D costs of orphan drug development. A government can try to reduce these financial uncertainties by imposing tax credits, clinical research assistance, and market exclusivity. This uncertainty is thus highly correlated with financial risk. Pharmaceutical companies are no different from other firms in trying to avoid such risk as much as possible. Consequently, they are inclined to select (the most) profitable opportunities. In this study, the relative advantage is not relative to the predecessor, but relative to the development and adoption of conventional drugs. The most important non-financial benefits are provided by legislative measures for orphan drug development, which are expected to have a stimulating effect on the willingness to develop such drugs. Both the American Orphan Drug Act and the European Orphan Drug Regulation are examples of legislative measures aimed at increasing the financial benefits of orphan drug development (for example, market exclusivity, scientific advice, and regulatory guidance). 9 For some pharmaceutical companies, an orphan drug designation may provide a powerful incentive for image improvement, particularly when proper funding and a profound knowledge base are lacking. For dedicated life sciences companies, the small production scale for orphan drugs can be attractive. Consequently, legislative measures are conceived to be contained in the concept of non-financial benefits. In addition to relative advantage, we included the independent variable financial risk in our conceptual model and expected it to have a negative effect on the willingness of producers, and more specifically of pharmaceutical companies, to develop orphan drugs.",

From the multi-actor perspective of orphan drug development described above, the regulator and consumer actor groups will affect the independent concepts in Fig. 3 , and may try to lower these barriers in the following ways. Regulators can influence the prevailing values of financial risk, non-financial benefits, complexity, and trialability by taking (enhanced) financial, legislative, and regulatory measures, for example, based on the European Orphan Drug Regulation (EODR). Consumers can improve the prevailing values of complexity and trialability by participating in the study of rare diseases and the development process of orphan drugs (such as diagnosis, pathogenesis (animal) models, ways of treatment, and number of patients involved in clinical trials). But regulators and consumers will only be inclined to contribute to lowering the barriers to orphan drug development if they are aware of these barriers, and only when all the three groups have a shared view on the barriers and their mutual relations in the orphan drug development trajectory. Then, the willingness to conduct concerted actions may be expected to increase to facilitate orphan drug development. This is the key theme to be elaborated in order to lower the innovation system barriers to orphan drug development. For the assessment and comparison of the perceptions of these barriers among producers, regulators, and consumers, the conceptual model in Fig. 3 will be operationalized in the next section.",

The barrier of the financial risk of non-profitable orphan drugs is also recognized by the regulators as being due to little expected revenues of an orphan drug. The regulator-related barrier of producers requiring help to secure the small revenues from an orphan drug is not recognized as such by the regulators. In addition, the regulator-related barrier of image improvement due to the approval of orphan drugs is not sufficiently recognized as a barrier by the regulators.

The producer and consumer actor groups do not support this action. Due to the poor regulatory infrastructure, they stress the importance of support from governmental agencies in the form of achieving the orphan designation under the EODR, and subsequently facilitating registration of and granting market exclusivity for orphan drugs. They require them to assume a more active role in orphan drug development by promoting and facilitating achievement of the orphan designation by pharmaceutical enterprises and to support this achievement with subsidiary payments of (clinical) research into orphan drugs, which in turn would lead to more approved orphan drugs within the European Union. This implies that the regulators should also help with organizing phase III clinical trials of orphan drugs by mobilizing patients in other countries to participate in these trials via the European Union or the World Health Organization. This should be achieved by governmental agencies in cooperation with patient organizations. It should be a priority for governmental agencies to adopt such a role, to stimulate coordination and planning of the actions of the various actor groups involved in orphan drug development.

On the basis of the conceptual model of the adoption of innovations (Tornatzky and Klein, 1982; Rogers, 1995; Tidd et al., 2001) and by operationalizing the concepts in this model for three different actor groups involved in orphan drug development (producers, regulators, and consumers), a multi-actor approach of analysis is adopted in this study. The data derived from interviews with key actors in each actor group have been analyzed by means of simple descriptive statistics, due to the few respondents involved. The results of the analyses highlight the empirical relationships among the indicators and between the indicators and the concepts they represent (Fig. 5) , and also indicate the conditions via the (ordinal) values of their indicators that hamper the willingness to develop orphan drugs to rise from the level of good intentions to the level of active involvement. These conditions are thresholds in the innovation system of orphan drug development, and include: omissions in the knowledge about the pathogenesis of orphan diseases; a lack of suitable animal models; problems with conducting sufficient clinical trials; the uncertainty about achieving orphan designation; problems with the registration of orphan drugs; the enormous costs of orphan drug development; and the expected small revenues from orphan drug use.",

Since January 2006, two policy regulations on expensive and orphan drugs are waiting in the wings to be implemented in the Dutch health care system(CTG/Zaio, 2006). 11 From 1983 to April 2005, orphan designation was accepted for about 1450 products in the USA and about 270 of these orphan drugs really received market approval.
