They are resistant to the stresses encountered in the extracellular space during transmission from cell to cell and host to host. However, at the same time, the assembly and maturation program has made sure that the particles can fall apart at a moment's notice during entry into a new cell. The reversibility of assembly is important to liberate the genome in infectious form and release the accessory proteins. Many of the stabilizing interactions in the particle must be undone: the envelope must be shed, the capsid opened, and the nucleic acids decondensed. To make this possible, the entire virus particle or specific proteins in it are locked in metastable conformations and poised to undergo major conformational changes when triggered by appropriate cues during entry . The uncoating program is thus built into the virion during assembly, allowing major transformations in the particle without the need for external energy.",

These steps, shown in Figure 1 for a virus that enters via endocytosis and moves to the nucleus (e.g., an adeno-or polyomavirus), start with events at the cell surface and end with the decondensation of the genome at the site of replication. As the virus progresses in its entry program, it undergoes changes that lead to events such as penetration, capsid destabilization, and uncoating of the genome. Many of these changes result from conformational alterations in metastable viral structures. They are triggered by receptor binding, exposure to low pH, reentry into a reducing environment, enzyme-induced covalent modifications, and other cellular cues (Earp et al., 2005; Harrison, 2005; Hogle, 2002; Smith and Helenius, 2004) . Viruses exploit such signals not only to induce changes in the particle and dissociation of protein subunits but also to coordinate movement from one compartment and location in the cell to another, ensuring that each step in the uncoating program occurs at the right point in the sequence, at the right time, and in the right place.",

These interactions and the molecules involved are of crucial importance for understanding not only the mechanisms of entry but also the biology of infection and pathogenesis. In Whether enveloped or nonenveloped, many viruses depend on the host cell's endocytic pathways for entry. They follow a multistep entry and uncoating program that allows them to move from the cell periphery to the perinuclear space. In this example, the virus proceeds to deliver its uncoated genome into the nucleoplasm. The interaction between the virus and the host cell starts with virus binding to attachment factors and receptors on the cell surface, followed by lateral movement of the virus-receptor complexes and the induction of signals that result in the endocytic internalization of the virus particle. After vesicular trafficking and delivery into the lumen of endosomes, caveosomes, or the ER, a change in the virus conformation is induced by cellular cues. This alteration results in the penetration of the virus or its capsids through the vacuole membrane into the cytosolic compartment. Enveloped viruses use membrane fusion for penetration, whereas nonenveloped viruses induce lysis or pore formation. After targeting and transport along microtubules, the virus or the capsid binds, as in this example, to the nuclear pore complex, undergoes a final conversion, and releases the viral genome into the nucleus. The details in the entry program vary for different viruses and cell types, but many of the key steps shown here are general. recent years, hundreds of attachment factors and receptors for different viruses have been identified, resulting in a large body of valuable information (Young, 2001) . The crystal structures of several viruses and viral proteins bound to receptors have also been solved (Kwong et al., 1998; Rossmann et al., 2002; Skehel and Wiley, 2000; Stewart et al., 2003) . Within the scope of this review, it is not possible to discuss the attachment factors and receptors in depth; however, it is important to emphasize that the list encompasses a wide variety of different proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates. Included are ion transporters, adhesion factors, signaling proteins, and a variety of other cell-surface receptors. Proteoglycans and glycolipids are commonly used as virus receptors or attachment factors (Young, 2001) . Moreover, influenza viruses and some paramyxoviruses have spike glycoproteins with lectin domains that bind to sialic acid, and the major coat protein of polyomaviruses, VP1, binds to the glycan moiety of specific gangliosides (Skehel and Wiley, 2000; Stehle and Harrison, 1997; Tsai et al., 2003) .",

Interestingly, HIV-1 can also bind to glycosylceramides and heparan sulfate, interactions that may facilitate the initial recruitment of virus to susceptible cells (Long et al., 1994; Ugolini et al., 1999) . Moreover, the presence of specific glycosphingolipids in the target cell membrane can enhance CD4/coreceptor-dependent fusion (Puri et al., 1998) . Viruses, in particular those that undergo rapid mutation, are also known to be able to switch receptors (Byrnes and Griffin, 2000; Klimstra et al., 1998) or adapt to use alternative receptors when the primary receptor is absent (Vlasak et al., 2005) .

They are simple, nonenveloped RNA viruses that replicate in the cytosol and do not need low pH for penetration. They share an essential receptor molecule with adenovi-ruses, a glycoprotein called CAR (the coxsackie and adenovirus receptor) (Zhang and Bergelson, 2005) . In epithelial cells, CAR is a component of tight junctions and is therefore not accessible to incoming viruses from the apical side. A recent study addressed the question of how the virus gains access to its receptor, i.e., how it breaches the epithelial barrier (Coyne and Bergelson, 2006) .",

Virus binding leads to crosslinking of DAF molecules, inclusion into lipid rafts, and activation of the tyrosine kinase c-Abl (Coyne and Bergelson, 2006) . Once activated, c-Abl was found to activate the Rhofamily small GTPase Rac, which in turn induced a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and promoted transfer of bound viruses from the apical surface to the tight-junction region of the cell. This made it possible for the virus to associate with CAR and for CAR to induce a conformational change in the virus particle, an obligatory step in picornavirus uncoating and entry (Hogle, 2002) . To release its RNA into the cytoplasm, the modified particles were then internalized by caveolar endocytosis activated by phosphorylation of Tyr14 in caveolin-1 by Fyn, a member of the Src family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. The detailed route taken by the virus inside the cell remains unclear at this point, but the final release of the viral RNA into the cytosol is likely to occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).",

Nemerow and coworkers demonstrated that the interaction between adenovirus pentons (protein complexes which together with the hexons make up the adenovirus capsid) and integrins activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI(3)K), which in turn activates Rac and Cdc42, resulting in the polymerization of actin-and clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the virus. Activation of many different signaling pathways has since been described with the involvement of a variety of factors, including serine/threonine, tyrosine, and PI kinases; phosphatases; and a variety of small GTPases (including Arf, Rab, and Rho family members) (Greber, 2002; Pelkmans et al., 2005) .",

Initially, the viruses need to make their presence on the cell surface known so that the cell can launch an endocytic response to bring them in. For example, the internalization of SV40 by caveolar/raft endocytosis is regulated by at least five different kinases . Inhibition of tyrosine kinases in particular blocks internalization and dramatically reduces infection (Chen and Norkin, 1999; Pelkmans et al., 2002) . In other cases, a virus may need to induce lateral movement along the membrane. This can be seen very dramatically when viruses such as murine leukemia virus and HIV-1 bind to filopodia and proceed to ''surf'' on the outside of these structures toward the cell body (Lehmann et al., 2005) . As discussed above, lateral movement is also needed for coxsackie B viruses to reach the CAR receptor in epithelial cells, and this movement requires activation of c-Abl following virus-induced crosslinking of DAF (Coyne and Bergelson, 2006) .",

This may be why so many viruses bind integrins. Viruses may also induce signaling by clustering specific cell-surface proteins or lipids. Interestingly, a number of viruses use GPI-anchored proteins and gangliosides, which are only associated with the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, as their receptors. That this often leads to activation of tyrosine kinases on the cytosolic side may be related to the fact that the GPIanchored proteins and gangliosides become lipid-raft associated when clustered (Coyne and Bergelson, 2006; Parton, 1994; Parton and Richards, 2003; Pelkmans et al., 2002; Sharma et al., 2004) . Being dually acylated, some Src-family kinases (though not Src itself) are also enriched in lipid-raft microdomains, but on the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane. Accordingly, there is increasing evidence that many viruses associate with lipid rafts to initiate intracellular signaling (Coyne and Bergelson, 2006; Damm et al., 2005; Ono and Freed, 2005) .",

Viruses that are ferried into cells inside endocytic vesicles can move deep into the cytoplasm, bypassing many of the barriers associated with the membrane cortex and cytosolic crowding (Marsh and Bron, 1997) and exploiting the molecular motors that are normally recruited to endocytic vesicles (Dohner and Sodeik, 2005) . A dependence on low pH for penetration allows viruses to use the decreasing pH of endocytic organelles as a cue to activate the penetration reactions and allows viral escape to the cytoplasm at specific locations or before the virus is delivered to the hydrolytic lysosomes (Helenius et al., 1980) . In addition, no viral components remain on the cell surface after penetration for detection by the host's immune defenses.",

It transports incoming viruses together with their receptors into early and late endosomes. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a continuous process, and, for virus entry, it is usually rapid and efficient (Marsh and Helenius, 1989) . The incoming viruses are often exposed to the acidic milieu of endosomes within minutes after internalization, and many respond to the pH drop by undergoing changes that lead to penetration. Depending on the pH threshold, the site of penetration is either the early (pH 6.5 to 6.0) or the late endosome (pH 6.0 to 5.5). In some cases, such as for Ebola virus, SARS coronavirus, and the nonenveloped mammalian reoviruses, acidic pH alone is not sufficient to induce fusion, and proteolytic cleavages in viral proteins by acid-dependent endosomal proteases, in particular cathepsins L and B, are needed to trigger the change to the penetration-competent state (Chandran et al., 2005; Ebert et al., 2002; Simmons et al., 2005) . For avian leukosis virus, both interaction of the viral envelope protein with a specific receptor (Damico et al., 1998; Hernandez et al., 1997) and low pH (Mothes et al., 2000) are required for fusion.",

Some of these mechanisms, such as clathrin-mediated endocytosis, are ongoing, whereas others, such as caveolae, are ligand and cargo induced. Currently, there is evidence for six pathways. (A) Macropinocytosis is involved in the entry of adenoviruses. (B) A clathrin-independent pathway from the plasma membrane has been shown to exist for influenza virus and arenaviruses. (C) The clathrin-mediated pathway is the most commonly observed uptake pathway for viruses. The viruses are transported via early endosomes to late endosomes and eventually to lysosomes. (D) The caveolar pathway is one of several closely related, cholesterol-dependent pathways that bring viruses including SV40, coxsackie B, mouse polyoma, and Echo 1 to caveosomes, from which many of them continue, by a second vesicle transport step, to the ER. (E) A cholesterol-dependent endocytic pathway devoid of clathrin and caveolin-1, used by polyomavirus and SV40. (F) A pathway similar to (D) except dependent on dynamin-2. It is used by Echo virus 1. Depending on the virus and cell type, penetration reactions occur in five locations: the plasma membrane, early and late endosomes, caveosomes, and the ER. Note that the additional endocytic mechanism of phagocytosis also operates in many cells but has not as yet been linked to virus entry and is not included here. endosomes that receive the incoming influenza viruses belong to a population that rapidly relocates the viruses, by microtubule-mediated transport, to the perinuclear region, where penetration occurs by fusion (Lakadamyali et al., 2003) . SFV fuses soon after delivery to Rab5 and EEA1-positive early endosomes, but the fused virus is then transported in Rab7-positive carriers to late endosomes (Vonderheit and Helenius, 2005) . There is also a recent observation that vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) may fuse with the internal membrane vesicles of multivesicular endosomes and that these internal membranes subsequently fuse with the limiting membrane of late endosomes to release the viral RNA to the cytoplasm (Le Blanc et al., 2005) . In this case, penetration would involve two membrane fusion events, the first mediated by the viral envelope protein and the second by an as yet uncharacterized cellular mechanism. Interestingly, the endocytic uptake and penetration of anthrax toxin also appears to involve a twostep process, the first involving interaction of the toxin with the internal membranes of a multivesicular endosome and the second a back fusion of these membranes with the endosome-limiting membrane (Abrami et al., 2004) .",

These kinases belong to many different classes, including regulators of the cytoskeleton, cell cycle, cell growth, and membrane trafficking.

Like cholera toxin, these viruses bind to the sugar moiety of gangliosides and enter cells via caveolar/raft pathways that are dependent on cholesterol ( Figures 2D and 2E ) and the activation of tyrosine-kinase signaling cascades (Anderson et al., 1996; Pelkmans et al., 2001; Smith et al., 2003a; Stang et al., 1997; Tsai et al., 2003) . Activation involves tyrosine kinases, PI kinases, and raft lipids. Dynamin 2, actin, caveolin-1, and Rho GTPases are also involved, depending on the virus and the cell type (Pelkmans et al., 2002) . Internalization occurs via caveolae that are activated for longdistance transport in the cytosol or via small vesicles that lack caveolin-1 (Damm et al., 2005; Tagawa et al., 2005) ( Figures 3C and 3D) . The caveolar/raft pathway takes the majority of internalized viruses first to pH-neutral organelles in the cytoplasm called caveosomes ( Figure 2D ). Following a second activation step, the virions are then transported by caveolinfree, microtubule-dependent vesicles trafficking to the ER, where penetration occurs (Pelkmans et al., 2001) . A recent study suggests that a lumenal ER protein, ERp29, a thioredoxin homolog without thiol oxidoreductase activity, facilitates penetration of polyomavirus by exposing the hydrophobic, C-terminal arm of VP1 (Magnuson et al., 2005) . In the case of SV40, we have found that the redox conditions in the ER, as well as two thiol oxidoreductases, PDI and ERp57, are important for SV40 uncoating and infection (M. Schelhaas, L. Pelkmans, and A.H., unpublished data) . Since siRNA silencing of derlin 1, a protein linked to the reverse translocation of substrates for ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD), inhibits infection, it is likely that components of the ERAD pathway play a central role in SV40 penetration from the ER. Interestingly, a similar mechanism may explain how the cholera toxin A chains penetrate into the cytosol (Tsai et al., 2002) .",

The molecular mechanisms involved in the pathway (or pathways) are not understood. By contrast, following binding to CAR and av integrin coreceptors, adenovirus type 2 (Ad2) activates an actin-dependent process classified as macropinocytosis (Figure 2A) , but virus endocytosis occurs via clathrin-coated pits. Inhibition of macropinocytosis inhibits virus entry, but how exactly this endocytic process influences virus penetration is unclear (Meier et al., 2002) . Although the formation of primary vesicles displays great heterogeneity, the subsequent steps inside the cell involve either endosomes or caveosomes and require cholesterol (Imelli et al., 2004) . That these two organelle classes are not entirely independent of each other is shown by their regulation through a small subset of common kinases and by the observation that cargo can be transferred between them .",

The spectrum of pathways is often redundant and cell-type specific. Differences in sensitivity to inhibitors, expression of dominant-negative mutants, and livecell microscopy show that the pathways differ in their kinetics and their dependence on host-cell kinases; dynamins; Rac-, Rab-, and Arf-family GTPases; actin and tubulin; and cholesterol. The pathways are also likely to be physiologically regulated (e.g., the upregulation of compensatory pathways when clathrin-mediated endocytosis is inhibited; Damke et al., 1995) . This may be one reason why viruses such as SV40 and influenza can use several different pathways, enabling them to infect a wide range of cells under various conditions. The question arises as to whether the pathways that have been identified in tissue culture systems, in some cases under unusual experimental conditions, occur in the relevant cells in vivo or whether there are additional endocytic entry mechanisms still to be discovered.",

When these proteins are expressed on the cell surface, they can allow fusion of the infected cell with neighboring noninfected cells expressing appropriate receptors. This leads to formation of heterokaryons, or syncytia, and potentially allows for the dissemination of the virus without the formation of mature virus particles. Nevertheless, in the majority of cases, the transfer of viral genomes from cell to cell appears to occur through the formation of virus particles that are released from infected cells and use the mechanisms described above to enter new uninfected hosts. Interestingly, the herpes virus varicella-zoster (VZV) appears to use cell-free viruses to spread from human to human but direct cell-to-cell transfer, without formation of infectious virions, to spread within an infected host (Chen et al., 2004) . Most studies of viral entry are, by necessity, conducted in tissue culture systems using cell lines that differ from the cells that are the normal targets for infection in vivo. Although these systems have contributed greatly to our understanding of virus entry, they do not fully replicate the in vivo scenario, and, as a consequence, crucial aspects of entry mechanisms may be missed.",

Often the efficiency of entry is low, and experimenters frequently enhance virus adsorption by including charged polymers, such as polybrene, in the medium or by gently centrifuging virus particles onto cells (O'Doherty et al., 2000) . Viruses that have adapted to growing in tissue culture cells can show an enhanced tendency to use proteoglycans for initial recruitment to cell surfaces (de Haan et al., 2005; Vlasak et al., 2005) . Indeed, HIV-1 strains adapted to grow in T cell lines appear to bind to cells via proteoglycans before engaging CD4 and coreceptors (Ugolini et al., 1999) . Together this suggests that the events involved in virus adsorption and entry in tissue culture may be different from those that occur in vivo. A number of recent studies suggest why this is the case.",

Vaccinia virus (VV) provides an extreme example. VV is produced in several forms, of which the intracellular mature virus (IMV) and extracellular enveloped virus (EEV) are capable of infecting target cells. The EEV is initially assembled with three membranes and is released to the cell surface when the outer membrane fuses with the plasma membrane to produce an extracellular double-membraned particle. The EEV remains bound to the surface of the producer cell and induces the polymerization of cytoplasmic actin comets that push the virus around on the surface of the cell, often at the tips of filopodium-like projections (Smith et al., 2003b; Wolffe et al., 1998) (see Figure 4 and Greber and Way, 2006 [this issue of Cell] ). In confluent cultures, and presumably in vivo as well, these projections push viruses into neighboring cells and enhance cell-to-cell transfer. Deletion of viral proteins involved in transmembrane signaling and actin nucleation reduces the viral plaque size in tissue culture and pathogenesis in vivo (Smith et al., 2003b; Wolffe et al., 1998) .",

In contrast to T cell killing or antigen presentation, virological-synapse formation between T cells does not require major histocompatibility antigens (Jolly and Sattentau, 2004) . The synapse provides a domain where virus assembly can be focused to release particles efficiently to a target cell. Similar means of trans-fer have been described for herpes viruses (Johnson and Huber, 2002) and for the T cell to T cell transfer of HIV (Jolly and Sattentau, 2004) .",

            "text": "A particularly intriguing example of infectious synapse function is that described for dendritic cells. For many years it has been recognized that a highly efficient way of infecting T cells with HIV in culture is to first present the virus to dendritic cells (Cameron et al., 1992) . HIV infection of dendritic cells can occur but is generally regarded as being inefficient. Recent studies have suggested an alternative mode of interaction whereby viruses may be captured by C type lectins (Geijtenbeek et al., 2000; Turville et al., 2002) , and perhaps other receptors involved in antigen acquisition, and internalized into endocytic vesicles without infecting the dendritic cell. This virus can be regurgitated when dendritic cells interact with CD4-positive T cells and is able to infect the T cell in trans through infectious or virological synapses-a process that mimics the normal course of antigen presentation (McDonald et al., 2003) . Viruses can be harbored in endocytic vesicles for hours, if not days, without losing infectivity, potentially allowing the dendritic cells in vivo to undergo maturation and relocation from peripheral tissue, where they would initially encounter viruses, to lymphoid organs. The endocytic compartment in which endocytosed viruses are sequestered is morphologically complex and bears some similarity to the compartments in macrophages where HIV assembles (Garcia et al., 2005) . Although trans-infection has been documented in tissue culture, it remains unclear whether it operates in the same manner in vivo where, for HIV at least, infection of dendritic cells and the production of viruses in infected dendritic cells may be more relevant (Turville et al., 2004) . Regardless, the transfer of viruses through infectious synapses is likely to operate in both scenarios.",

It is likely that similar strategies are used in various situations by different viruses; in particular, following reactivation of latent viruses, the transfer of HSV and varicella-zoster virus (chicken pox) from infected neurones to epithelial cells is likely to exploit specialized cell junctions (Johnson and Huber, 2002) .",

            "text": "Many viruses only infect a restricted range of cells, limiting their species tropism and cell tropism. Frequently, the restriction on infection is due to the absence of appropriate receptors. With retroviruses, however, a number of other mechanisms to limit viral replication have been discovered, and many of these operate at the level of entry (Towers and Goff, 2003) . For HIV in particular, several mechanisms have now been described through which virus replication can be limited independently of receptor expression. Cellular RNA-editing enzymes can be packaged into virus particles and can introduce mutations in the viral genome during the reverse-transcription event that occurs shortly after virus entry. HIV-1 uses its Vif protein to overcome this restriction by preventing packaging of the editing enzymes into virus particles (Sheehy et al., 2002) . In another example, the so-called Lv1 (or Ref1) restriction that prevents HIV-1 replication in Old World monkeys is mediated by a homo-oligomeric protein called Trim 5a (Stremlau et al., 2004; Towers, 2005) . Trim 5a appears to bind to an exposed loop on the capsid protein that becomes available when the capsid is released to the cytoplasm after fusion (Ylinen et al., 2005) . Trim 5a appears to prevent uncoating of the incoming particles by crosslinking the capsid protein subunits, though in some cases it may operate after reverse transcription (Ylinen et al., 2005) . The Fv1 restriction seen with murine leukemia viruses operates after reverse transcription and prevents nuclear entry (Towers et al., 2000) . Interestingly, the Fv1 restriction maps to an endogenous retroviral gag gene (Best et al., 1996) , suggesting that interaction between incoming capsids and an endogenous Gag protein prevents infection.",

Thus, not only must viruses find their way to the correct pathway for infection, but diversion to an alternative pathway, or blind alley, can limit the potential for subsequent infection and replication.

Thus, each endocytic mechanism might be given a unique genetic fingerprint. Understanding these processes may allow specific cellular pathways or molecular machines to be targeted pharmacologically to inhibit the entry of any virus that uses the route for infection. Such an approach may offer the advantage that it will be more difficult for a virus to find a way around the block by mutation. It will also be important to show that the pathways identified in tissue culture experiments operate in vivo during a normal infection. Such experiments will be difficult, especially with human viruses, but inhibitors identified through tissue culture experiments may make it possible to address these issues.",

For some viruses with high infectious-unit-to-particle ratios, such as SFV, such studies provide direct information on entry. More careful attention to the preparation and storage of other viruses may allow similar morphological experiments to be interpreted with the confidence that the events observed represent the behavior of infectious particles. The ability to use microscopes in high-throughput screens for inhibitors of virus entry or to determine key components in the entry pathway will have a far-reaching impact on our understanding of virus entry. Together, these studies should provide detailed insights to the cellular mechanisms of endocytosis. The identification of natural ligands will also be key in establishing the biological relevance of these pathways. If we revisit this topic in 5 years' time, we will have a very much more detailed picture of virus entry.
