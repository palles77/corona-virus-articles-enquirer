            "text": "Sequencing pathogen genomes is costly, demanding careful allocation of limited sequencing resources. We built a computational Sequencing Analysis Pipeline (SAP) to guide decisions regarding the amount of genomic sequencing necessary to develop high-quality diagnostic DNA and protein signatures. SAP uses simulations to estimate the number of target genomes and close phylogenetic relatives (near neighbors or NNs) to sequence. We use SAP to assess whether draft data are sufficient or finished sequencing is required using Marburg and variola virus sequences. Simulations indicate that intermediate to high-quality draft with error rates of 10 \u00c03 -10 \u00c05 ($83 coverage) of target organisms is suitable for DNA signature prediction. Low-quality draft with error rates of $1% (33 to 63 coverage) of target isolates is inadequate for DNA signature prediction, although low-quality draft of NNs is sufficient, as long as the target genomes are of high quality. For protein signature prediction, sequencing errors in target genomes substantially reduce the detection of amino acid sequence conservation, even if the draft is of high quality. In summary, high-quality draft of target and low-quality draft of NNs appears to be a cost-effective investment for DNA signature prediction, but may lead to underestimation of predicted protein signatures.",

This information is assembled into contigs, or fragments of the genome that cannot be joined further due to lack of sequence information across gaps between the contigs. To generate high-quality draft, usually $8\u00b7 coverage is optimal (1). Finished sequence, without gaps or ambiguous base calls, usually requires 8\u00b7 to 10\u00b7 coverage, along with additional analyses, often manual, to orient the contigs relative to one another and to close the gaps between them in a process called finishing. In fact, it has been stated that 'the defining distinction of draft sequencing is the avoidance of significant human intervention' (1) , although there are computational tools that may also be capable of automated finishing in some circumstances (2) .",

By a 'signature' we mean a short region of sequence that is sufficient to uniquely identify an organism down to the species level, without false negatives due to strain variation or false positives due to cross reaction with close phylogenetic relatives. In addition, for DNA signatures, we require that the signature be suitable for a TaqMan reaction (e.g. composed of two primers and a probe of the desired T m s). Limited funds and facilities in which to sequence biothreat pathogens mean that decision makers must choose wisely which and how many organisms to sequence. Money and time saved as a result of draft rather than finished sequencing enables more target organisms, more isolates of the target and more near neighbors (NNs) of the target to be sequenced. However, if draft data do not facilitate the generation of highquality signatures for detection, the tradeoff of quantity over quality will not be worth it.",

WGASA is the software used in the analyses here to create an alignment and will be discussed below. Next, the DNA Signature Pipeline identifies regions that are unique in the target sequence consensus relative to all other non-target bacterial and viral sequences that we have in a >1 Gb database, which is frequently updated from the NCBI GenBank sequence database (11) and other sources (e.g. our collaborators at the CDC, USDA and other public sources, such as TIGR, Sanger Institute and the Joint Genome Institute). From the conserved, unique regions, signatures are selected based on the requirements of a particular technology, in this case, TaqMan PCR. These signature candidates may then proceed for further in silico screening (BLAST analyses to look for undesired inexact matches) before undergoing laboratory screening. For an SAP run, first a pool of target genome and a pool of NN genomes are collected. Then many random subsamples of target and NN genomes are selected from the pool, and each subsample is run through either the DNA signature pipeline or the protein signature pipeline, which identify regions conserved among target genomes and unique relative to non-target genomes, where unique regions are evaluated by comparing to a large sequence database of all currently available bacterial and viral complete genomes or the non-redundant protein database, excluding NNs from the NN pool that are not in that random subsample. Thus, each run of the SAP requires many runs of the DNA or protein signature pipelines with different random samples, generating a range of outcomes that are plotted on range plots.",

First, target genomes are aligned using WGASA. A set of gene (start, end) pairs for both the plus and minus strands relative to the reference genome is required. This implies that coding frames for the translation of nucleic acid codons into amino acids for each protein of the target organism's genome have been correctly determined. From the aligned genomes, nucleotide codons are translated into amino acid sequence based on the gene locations, and conserved strings of six or more amino acids among all the target genomes are recorded. These conserved fragments are then compared with the NCBI GenBank non-redundant (nr) database of amino acid sequences, unveiling peptides that are unique to the target species. For our computations, we require that if a peptide signature is longer than six amino acids, then every sub-string of length six amino acids is also conserved and unique. There may be many conserved and unique peptide signatures on the same and on different proteins. The resulting conserved, unique peptides that are at least six amino acids long from open reading frames are considered to be protein signature candidates.",

Based on the combined results of the many signature pipeline runs using random target samples of size t and n, we assessed how much sequence data, that is, the values of t and n, was required to approximate the number of signature candidates c that were predicted when the full data set (all target and NN sequences, t \u00bc T and n \u00bc N) was analyzed with the signature pipeline.

In contrast, due to differences in generating the products for Sanger sequencing that are employed for smaller RNA and DNA viruses, there are often more sequencing errors in the middle of contigs for such smaller viral draft genomes. Although we did not specifically simulate draft for RNA and short DNA viruses, our simulator should work with minor modification to a few parameters. Thus, there are four parameters that must be specified for simulating sequencing errors: (i) the size cutoff for small versus large contigs, (ii) the probability of errors in the middle portion of small versus large contigs, (iii) the length of the contig ends where sequencing is either less accurate (bacteria and long doublestranded DNA viruses) or more accurate (small viruses, RNA viruses) and (iv) the probability of sequencing errors at the contig ends. If there is a sequencing error at a particular base, we assumed that that base is randomly changed to one of the other three bases with equal probability.

In the first and third cases, the target sequences must be aligned, and WGASA requires that one of the sequences be a finished genome for reference. Thus, for each random sample from the pool of target genomes, one genome was randomly selected to be the finished genome, and so was left as finished sequence, and the other genomes in the sample were replaced with simulated draft sequence (by running through the draft simulator) before alignment. As with NNs, target draft sequences differ for the same genome among samples due to the randomness of the draft simulation each time it is run. In addition, the target genome that is chosen to be the finished, reference genome differs between samples, and the other target genomes in the sample simulation are replaced with simulated draft versions of the actual finished sequences.

This is merely a rough estimate, and the actual costs of sequencing any given organism may differ substantially from this rule-of-thumb calculation. In Equation 1, it is assumed that the cost of sequencing viruses does not decline for sequencing second and subsequent isolates. While this may be a false assumption in cases where isolates are similar to one another, in other cases where the new sequences are divergent, as isolates from different outbreaks or for viruses with rapid mutation rates, the cost is especially unlikely to decline. In addition, the $0.40/bp figure for draft of 6\u00b7 to 8\u00b7 coverage could range from $0.30 to $0.50/bp using shotgun sequencing, but may be as low as $0.10-$0.20/bp if primer walking works well (i.e. known primer sites are found in new isolates). Finishing could be 1-3 times more than the cost of draft, so we used a factor of 2 times more (draft $0.4/bp, finished $0.4 + 0.8/bp) in the equation above as a reasonable estimate.

However, draft sequencing of this low quality (3\u00b7 to 6\u00b7) for Marburg causes a dramatic decline in the ability to computationally eliminate regions of poor conservation, and thus to exclude poor signature regions ( Figure 2 ).

These results differ from those using finished genomes, where the lack of sequence conservation is more evident and there are zero TaqMan signatures conserved among all strains. Most combinations of four finished genomes are sufficient to eliminate nonconserved signatures ( Figure 3A ). Although predictions that there are 0 signature candidates shared among all finished strains may seem to argue against TaqMan methods, in fact this information provides important guidance for the development of TaqMan signatures with degenerate bases or a set of signatures that will, in combination, pick up all sequenced strains. Other analyses indicate that there are TaqMan signatures conserved among five of the six strains, so that two signatures would form a minimal set that could detect both the one divergent and the other five strains.",

Then uniqueness is calculated based upon perfect matches of at least 18 bp long between the conservation gestalt and a large sequence database of non-target The percent of the target genome that is conserved varies slightly among the runs using finished target sequences because different genomes were randomly selected to be the reference strain in each multiple sequence alignment.",

For example, in Table 1 the conserved+unique fraction is 4% with finished variola target data, but is overestimated at 58% with low-quality draft. This artifact does not, however, affect TaqMan signature prediction, since the regions suitable for primers and probes must have at least 18 contiguous, conserved bases, and all of these are tested for uniqueness, i.e. there is no underestimation of uniqueness in conserved fragments that are at least 18 bp in length, and thus no underestimate of uniqueness in the predicted signatures.",

For variola, using all available target data, 97, 14, 6 and 0 protein signatures are predicted using finished, low error, intermediate error and high error draft target data, respectively ( Figure 8 ). Thus, sequencing errors substantially reduce the detection of amino acid sequence conservation, even if sequencing errors occur at the low rate of 10 \u00c04 -10 \u00c05 across most of the genome. The pattern of how additional sequences reduce the number of protein signature candidates also differs for draft compared with finished sequence data. With finished data, there is a large range in the number of peptide signature candidates predicted with 17 or fewer variola genomes, and this range narrows around the lower bound with >17 genomes. With 16 genomes, the 75% quantile mark approaches the final predicted number of 97 signatures ( Figure 8A ). This pattern indicates that there is a set of 97 peptides that are highly conserved among all currently sequenced variolas, which are unlikely to be eroded even as more sequence data are obtained. In other words, additional sequence data are probably not needed at this time in order to computationally predict good peptide signature targets, and as few as 16 finished target sequences would most likely have been adequate to generate this same list of $100 peptide signatures.",

This occurs since sequencing errors occur at random, in different locations in each of the draft target genomes, and obscure the truly conserved peptides. One might falsely infer from peptide SAP results based on the draft data that additional sequencing (beyond the 28 variola major genomes used here) would be useful in generating peptide signature candidates.

We have used this 'ratio-to-win' option to generate signature candidates for some highly divergent RNA viruses (for which we have finished sequence), although usually our preference is to include degenerate bases, especially when there are only a few bases with heterogeneity among strains in a given signature candidate.
