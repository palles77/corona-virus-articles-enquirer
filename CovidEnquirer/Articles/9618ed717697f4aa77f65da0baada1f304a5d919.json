Therefore, the identification of host cell components involved in DENV replication would provide useful information for better understanding DENV infection. In this study, a significantly decreased level of miR-223 was found in DENV2-infected EAhy926 cells, a human endothelial-like cell line, whereas miR-223 overexpression inhibited DENV2 replication. Furthermore, we identified that miR-223 directly targeted the 3 0 untranslated region (3 0 UTR) of the messenger RNA (mRNA) for microtubule-destabilizing protein stathmin 1 (STMN1), thereby reducing its mRNA and protein levels. The depletion of miR-223 or overexpression of STMN1 enhanced DENV2 replication, whereas the opposite (increased miR-223 or decreased STMN1) suppressed DENV2 replication, indicating that miR-223 downregulates STMN1 expression by targeting the 3 0 UTR of the STMN1 gene to inhibit DENV2 replication. Finally, we demonstrated that two transcription factors, C/EBPa and E2F1, are involved in the regulation of miR-223 levels after DENV2 infection in EAhy926 cells. Collectively, our results suggest that miR-223 may act as a novel antiviral factor, which may open an avenue to limit DENV infection.",

There are four antigenically distinct serotypes of DENV (DENV1-4). It is estimated that there are 390 million dengue infections per year, of which 96 million are apparently symptomatic. Therefore, dengue infection has reemerged as an important public health concern in endemic areas. However, there are no vaccines or specific anti-viral treatments currently available [1, 2] .",

            "text": "The pathogenesis of DENV infection is not completely understood. It is known that vascular leakage and hemorrhage, which are typical clinical manifestations, are often observed in severe dengue, suggesting that vascular endothelial cells (VECs) may act as a target for DENV and be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease [3] . However, the mechanism of how the infection alters endothelial function and/or morphology is not yet clear. In fact, the process of DENV infection occurs due to the interaction between DENV and certain components of the host cells. It has been reported that DENV virions are found in the region from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi in infected cells [4] . After the nucleocapsids are assembled and acquire their envelopes and associated structures, some viral particles are transferred to the Golgi system for maturation and are then released by exocytosis. However, it remains unclear which regulator or component of the host cells is involved in the DENV replicative cycle during this process, and the answer would provide more details of DENV infection and further insight into therapies for dengue. microRNAs (miRNAs) have recently been identified as key components of development and cellular homeostasis. miR-NAs are endogenous, small (18-25 bp) noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression mostly at the post-transcriptional level. miRNAs can silence genes through either perfect binding to the coding region of messenger RNA (mRNA), which results in degradation, or through imperfect binding to the 3 0 untranslated region (3 0 UTR) of the mRNA, resulting in translational repression [5e7] . The specificity of miRNAs is thought to be primarily mediated by 2e8 nucleotides at the 5 0 end of the miRNA, which is also known as the seed region [8, 9] . miRNAs have been implicated in the regulation of diverse cellular processes. Recently, a role for cellular miR-NAs against viral infection has been demonstrated in plants, insects, vertebrates, and mammals. It has been reported that cellular miR-122 enhances the replication of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) [10] ; in contrast, cellular miR-32 effectively restricts the accumulation of the primate foamy virus type 1 retrovirus in human cells [11] . The EpsteineBarr virus (EBV) has been shown to trigger the expression of miR-21, miR-155, and miR-146a, which may be involved in the development of EBV-associated Burkett's lymphoma [12e14] . Cellular miR-17-5p, miR-20a, and miR-132 are important for regulating HIV-1 replication [15] . More recently, 11 upregulated and 4 downregulated miRNAs were identified in DENV2 infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and it was suggested that cyto kines and epigenetic regulators may be putative target genes of these miRNAs [16] . However, little is known about the detailed roles of cellular miRNAs in DENV infection.",

Among the many detected targets, we focused on STMN1, a prominent microtubule destabilizer that preferentially acts on microtubule minus ends. The target sequence from nucleotides 662 to 669 in the 3 0 UTR of the STMN1 gene was predicted to have complete complementarity to the miR-223 seed region (Fig. 3A) . To verify whether STMN1 mRNA is a direct target of miR-223, the 3 0 UTR and two mutated 3 0 UTRs of the STMN1 gene were cloned into the pGL3-basic vector, and the plasmids pGLuc-STMN1 3 0 UTR, pGLuc-STMN1 3 0 UTR-mutant1 and pGLuc-STMN1 3 0 UTR-mutant2 were constructed (Fig. 3A) . The EAhy-223-up and EAhy-223-cont2 cells were transfected with the plasmids to determine the interaction of the target sequences with the miR-223 seed region. Compared with EAhy-223-cont2 cells, the expression of the STMN1 3 0 UTR was repressed by approximately 60% after transfection of pGLuc-STMN1 3 0 UTR (the wild-type construct) in the EAhy-223-up cells, indicating that the exogenous expression of miR-223 substantially repressed the expression of the STMN1 3 0 UTR. However, this inhibitory effect was not observed in the EAhy-223-up cells transfected with the pGLuc-STMN1 3 0 UTR-mutant1 and pGLuc-STMN1 3 0 UTR-mutant2 plasmids (Fig. 3B) , indicating that the deletion or mutation of the miR-223 binding site completely abrogated the miR-223-dependent repressive effect on the STMN1 3 0 UTR. These data demonstrated that miR-223 directly interacts with the STMN1 3 0 UTR.",

By qRT-PCR, the mRNA levels of STMN1 were found to be significantly reduced to 20% in the EAhy-STMN1-down cells compared to the EAhy-STMN1-cont1 (Supplemantary 2A).

Western blotting demonstrated that the expression levels of the STMN1 protein were consistent with mRNA levels (Supplemantary 2B): expression of the STMN1 protein was reduced (0.1-fold) in the EAhy-STMN1down cells and increased (2.1-fold) in the EAhy-STMN1-up cells.

A 50% decreased viral titer was observed in the supernatant of EAhy-STMN1-down cells compared with EAhy-STMN1-cont1 cells; as expected, a 2-fold increase in viral titer was detected in the supernatant of EAhy-STMN1-up cells compared with EAhy-STMN1-cont2 cells (Fig. 5C) . The ratio of extracellular to intracellular infectious particles was then calculated to evaluate the effect of STMN1 on viral release.

For example, miR-223 is markedly down-regulated during erythroid and granulocytic differentiation and maturation and is necessary for erythropoiesis [27, 28] . It was also found that the downregulation of miR-223 is involved in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [19, 29] . Specifically, it has been reported that miR-223 plays a role in the pathogenesis of certain infectious diseases, such as influenza and chronic hepatitis B virus infection [23, 25] . Moreover, an anti-viral effect for miR-223 was observed in SARS coronavirusinfected bronchoalveolar stem cells and in freshly isolated HIV-1-infected monocytes [24, 30] . However, less is known about the roles of miRNAs, especially miR-223, in DENV infection. Interestingly, miRNA expression profiling has been described in DENV2-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells [16] . However, further investigation into the effect of miRNAs on DENV infection is lacking. Here, we demonstrate that miR-223 inhibits DENV2 replication and may act as a novel antiviral host factor against DENV2.

Furthermore, STAT3 activation was observed in DSS patients during the early stages of infection [36] . Accordingly, the increased levels of STMN1 observed in this study may promote DENV infection by a similar mechanism. Alternatively, 2) many viruses utilize components of the cellular machinery, such as actin and MTs, to promote intracellular transport and to reach specific sites of viral replication [37] and there is cooperation between actin and MTs in host cells. Our previous studies demonstrated that the Rho GTPase Rac1 plays an important role in DENV2 infection through the regulation of actin cytoskeleton rearrangements [38] . It is known that the actin cytoskeleton is a key factor involved in the endocytosis and phagocytosis of several pathogens. Thus, there may be a possibility that increased STMN1 affects actin function by changing MT dynamics, which may provide advantageous conditions, including energy and viral transportation microenvironment, that facilitate DENV2 replication. Further related studies are ongoing in our laboratory to examine and confirm these possible mechanisms of STMN1 action in DENV infection.",

Our study revealed that a cellular miRNA modulates host gene expression to control DENV2 propagation, and these results may open an avenue for limiting DENV infection.",

            "text": "To investigate the mechanism of miR-223 down-regulation in DENV2-infected EAhy926 cells, we examined the expression levels of several transcription factors, such as C/EBPa, E2F1, NFI-A, and acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) 1/ETO, which likely bind to the promoter region of miR-223 [18e20]. Of them, the expression levels of two transcription factors, C/ EBPa and E2F1, were substantially altered. C/EBPa is a key transcriptional regulator of granulocyte differentiation [39] , and E2F1 is a master regulator for cell-cycle progression [40] . The function of miR-223 in granulopoiesis and AML has been connected to C/EBPa-mediated inhibition of E2F1 [20] . It was reported that C/EBPa binds to the miR-223 promoter to elevate miR-223 transcription and that miR-223 then targets the 3 0 UTR of E2F1, resulting in translational inhibition. However, E2F1 also binds to the miR-223 promoter and inhibits miR-223 transcription, generating a negative feedback loop. In this study, down-regulated miR-223 levels, decreased C/EBPa, and markedly increased E2F1 were observed after DENV2 infection. Taken together, the data from the previous study and our current results lead us to hypothesize that DENV-induced decreased expression of C/EBPa inhibits miR-223 expression, which then increases E2F1 levels, further promoting the inhibition of miR-223 by the binding of E2F1 to its promoter region. Therefore, our results suggest that these two transcription factors (C/EBPa and E2F1) are likely to be major contributors in DENV2-induced miR-223 downregulation.",
