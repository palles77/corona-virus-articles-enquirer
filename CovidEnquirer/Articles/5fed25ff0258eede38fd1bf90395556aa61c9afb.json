Among 10,075 persons discharged from the ED, there were 28 reattending patients who were admitted and diagnosed with SARS, giving an undertriage rate of 0.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.1% to 0.4%). The sensitivity of an ED admission for SARS was 89.4% (95% CI 85.6% to 93.1%), and specificity was 89.7% (95% CI 89.2% to 90.3%). The positive predictive value was 17% (95% CI 15.7% to 18.4%), and the negative predictive value was 99.7% (95% CI 99.6% to 99.8%). No patient contracted SARS as a result of an ED visit.

Seven cubicles that could be used for triage or consultation were set up under the tent, with facilities for a second satellite radiology service.

After screening, all patients were directed to the different risk areas to be triaged by nurses and assessed by physicians in their respective areas, thus minimizing mingling of patients from different risk categories.

Twenty-two (78.6%) of these 28 patients had a temperature lower than 38\u00b0C (<100.3\u00b0F), and 9 (32.1%) did not have a cough during their first ED consultation.

Four patients with infective categorical data, and statistical significance was set at a P value less than or equal to .05 where appropriate. This study was approved by the hospital review board.",
