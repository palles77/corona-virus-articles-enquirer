Nevertheless, until recently gastro-enteritis provided a poor hunting ground for virologists for, although such viruses as adenoviruses, echoviruses and Coxsackie viruses could be isolated from the stools of patients with acute gastro-enteritis, they could often be recovered with almost equal frequency from those without diarrhoeal disease, particularly in developing countries. However, the examination of negatively stained faecal preparations from patients with gastro-enteritis by electron microscopy has resulted in the discovery of many viruses, some of which, for example, rotaviruses and such parvovirus-like viruses as the Norwalk agent, are undoubtedly the cause of acute gastro-enteritis. The role of such other viruses as astroviruses, caliciviruses, adenoviruses and coronaviruses remains as yet to be clearly established. In general, ilz -rim cultivation of viruses causing gastro-enteritis in humans is either not possible or extremely difficult and of little value for routine diagnostic purposes but, since they are often excreted in very high titres, they may be detected without difficulty by electron microscopic examination of faecal extracts.",

            "text": "Viruses known to cause gastro-enteritis 1. Parvovirus-like virtues Small virus particles, approximately 27 nm in diameter, with the morphology and biophysical characteristics of parvoviruses have been detected in bacteria-free filtrates of stools from patients with the syndrome of winter vomiting disease (endemic nausea and vomiting). Family and community-wide outbreaks which occur during winter months have been described, including outbreaks in schools JKAPIKIAN et al., 1972) . in which uo to 50\"., of the staff and children were affected. Secondary attack rate of up to 30\",, occurred among family contacts, all age-groups being affected. Nausea, vomitingsometimes projectile-and vertigo are the symptoms most commonly encountered; some patients have diarrhoea and abdominal pain. The disease has an incubation period of 24 to 36 hours and runs a short course, the duration of which is usually from 24 to 72 hours. Parvovirus-like particles may be detected in the stools by electron microscopy during the acute phase of the infection, peak excretion occurring about 36 hours after onset. An immune response may be detected by immune electronmicrosconv. The first outbreak in which the virus was characterized occurred in a primary school in Norwalk, Ohio (KAPIKIAN et al., 1972) . Since then, parvovirus-like viruses have been detected in further outbreaks in the U.S.A. (WYATT et al., 1974) as well as in the U.K. . Cross challenge studies in volunteers, together with studies by immune electron microscopy, indicate that these strains exhibit antigenic diversity (WYATT et nl., 1974) . Thus, although the Norwalk agent is closely related to the Montgomery County agent which was detected in a family outbreak in Maryland, U.S.A., both these viruses are unrelated to that which caused an outbreak of winter vomiting disease in Hawaii (THORNHILL et al., 1977) . W and Ditchling agents are antigenically related and caused outbreaks in schools in England (CLARKE et al., 1972; . However, the virus detected in faecal extracts of patients with gastro-enteritis following ingestion of cockles in 1976 (APPLETON & PEREIRA, 1977) appears to be unrelated to W or Ditchling agents: U-.K. and U.S. strains are apparently unrelated (APPLETON & PEREIRA, 1977) . Antigenic comparison of strains detected in an extensive epidemic in a primary school in Australia, in which 200 of 381 children and nine of 18 teachers were involved, has not zs yet been reported (CHRISTOPHER et al., 1978) . Recently, a sensitive radio-immuno-assay test has been developed for detecting antibodies to Norwalk agent (GREENBERG et al., 1978) . Studies on sera collected in Washington, D.C., showed that antibody is acquired gradually with age, about 50\",, of adults having immunitv. The role of parvovirus-like viruses in acute gastro-enteritis in developing countries remains to be determined but preliminary studies conducted on sera collected in Guatemala and rural Bangladesh suggest that the incidence of infection does not differ markedly from that in developed countries, since the pattern of acquisition of antibody is similar (GREENBERG & KAPIKIAN, 1978) .",

Thus, studies in southern India Nellore) and central Australia (Alice Springs) suggest 'that rotavirus infection occurs most commonly during the cooler months. However, in parts of those countries with high ambient temperatures throughout the year (Calicut and Darwin), there was an increased prevalence of rotavirus infection during or just after the rainy season (MATHAN et al., 1977; SHNAGL et al., 1977; Walker & Marshall, 1978, personal communication) .

Large-scale prospective studies to assess the role of rotaviruses as a cause of severe gastro-enteritis in developing countries were, until recently, hindered by the fact that such sophisticated techniques as electron microscopy were required for diagnosis. However, the ELISA test is of comparable sensitivity to electron microscopy and can be readily carried out in developing countries with little cost, provided standardized reagents are available (YOLKEN et al., 1977) . The ELISA test may be used, not only to detect rotaviruses and compare their antigenicity, but also to detect immune responses to them. It is hoped that much invaluable epidemiological data relating to the role of rotavirus infection in different communities in developing countries may result from the widescale use of this technique.",

Thus, studies in Glasgow have shown that about 80% of babies excreting virus have gastro-intestinal symptoms and that, when viruses are also present in faecal extracts, astroviruses are usually the first to appear (Madeley, 1978, personal communication) . An outbreak of astrovirus-associated diarrhoea in a children's ward affecting both children and staff has recently been described, and some of those affected were shown to develop an immune response (KURTZ et al., 1977) .

Their association with acute gastro-enteritis is rather more tenuous than that of astroviruses as yet, although there has been a recent report of caliciviruslike virus particles being detected in the stools of children and staff in an outbreak of winter vomiting disease in a primary school (MCSWIGGAN et al., 1978) . Since coronaviruses are important causes of severe diarrhoeal disease in pigs (transmissible gastro-enteritis) and calves (TAJIMA, 1970; STAIR et al., 1972) , many workers have hoped to identify their counterpart in man. However, unlike rotaviruses, evidence that coronaviruses cause human gastro-intestinal infection is currently somewhat tenuous. Corona-like virus particles have been detected in patients with both acute and chronic diarrhoeal disease, as well as in asymptomatic persons. Although some workers have expressed doubt as to whether the corona-like virus particles detected were indeed viruses rather than bacterial substructures or fragments of gut epithelium, it is encouraging that coronavirus-like particles have now been propagated in both cell and organ cultures (CAUL & EGGLESTONE, 1977) . Fringed, pleomorphic particles, resembling 'coronaviruses, have been detected in go\",, of faecal extracts obtained in parts of southern India where tropical sprue is endemic. These particles were present in all age groups except for newborn infants, but they were detected with almost equal frequency among patients and asymptomatic persons (MATHAN et al., 1975; MATHAN & MATHAN, 1978) . The role of these virus-like structures in tropical sprue is therefore far from clear. However, it is important that further studies, in which attempts are made to cultivate these virus-like particles, be carried out.",
