            "text": "Observational studies of various sorts during the first half of the 20th century had established a relation between cerebrovascular strokes in the anterior part of the brain and narrowing of the carotid arteries in the neck and within the skull. This led to the invention of two surgical procedures. The first, carotid endarterectomy (CE), was introduced in 1954 to remove obstructions in the carotid artery as it passes from the aorta through the neck to the anterior brain. The second, extracranialeintracranial arterial bypass (EC-IC bypass), was developed in the late 1960s for individuals who had partial obstruction in the part of the carotid artery protected by the skull. Because CE cannot be performed in this part of the artery, the EC-IC bypass procedure ''bypasses'' the obstruction by freeing a branch of the superficial temporal artery on the outside of the skull then creating a hole in the skull over a branch of the middle cerebral artery, and then joining the superficial temporal artery to the middle cerebral artery using microsurgical techniques that include an operating microscope and sutures that are invisible to the human eye. By the late 1970s, neither of these procedures had been tested in a well-conducted randomized controlled trial (RCT), although there had been an inconclusive trial of CE (in which surgical calamities were excluded from the analysisda study in how not to analyze a clinical trial!) [2] , and a second study was abandoned because of a 35% perioperative stroke and death rate among the first 43 patients admitted to the study [3] .",

The key target at first was the surgical procedure that was by then relatively entrenched, CE. Testing the waters with surgeons who performed this procedure, and whose cooperation would be essential, it proved difficult to arouse enthusiasm for evaluating the procedure.",

            "text": "The target then shifted to the newer surgical approach, EC-IC bypass. This elegant procedure had been developed in Switzerland by Yasargil [4] , brought to Canada by Peerless, and spread during the next 10 years to many countries. It was technically feasible, with high rates of bypass patency, but was very expensive, requiring both high surgical expertise and sophisticated equipment. Most surgical teams able to perform EC-IC bypass were in university centers, whereas CE had disseminated widely into the community hospitals as well. Although there were many case reports and case series attesting to the merits of EC-IC bypass, none of these compared it with medical treatment alone. This time it proved possible to recruit enough interested neurosurgeons and neurologists to form a study team. I was just completing my clinical training in internal medicine at the time, having previously completed my research training under Dave Sackett. My role in this process was to help develop the background literature review and the justification, including sample size considerations, a proposal for the study question, and a preliminary outline for the study design. Heady stuff for a young squirt anticipating an academic appointment the following year! An RCT of EC-IC bypass was conducted, beginning in 1978 and reported in 1985 [5] . The study showed no benefit for surgery; in fact, evaluation of the functional status of patients showed that the surgery delayed natural recovery from stroke for up to 1 year [6] . With this result, skepticism began to grow about whether CE was any more respectable than its downstream cousin, EC-IC bypass. The conditions had now become more favorable for testing CEdunder certain conditions. Many surgeons remained opposed to testing CE, and those who were potentially willing to participate in such a trial wanted to ensure that the procedure was given a fair chance to succeed. To them, this meant that only surgeons with a ''good track record'' for CE would be included in the study, that the obstruction in the carotid artery would be severe enough, that patients would be likely to benefit from its removal (although many surgeons were offering the procedure for lesser degrees of narrowing), and that the patients themselves would be healthy enough to undergo surgery and live long enough thereafter for a benefit from surgery to be observed.",

This certainly applies to health care researchdnew knowledge originates from having asked answerable questions. To find new and useful answers to important problems that have not already been resolved, you need to know a lot about the problem and precisely where the boundary between current knowledge and ignorance lies. Without knowing a lot about the problem, it is difficult to imagine that plausible diagnostic tests and interventions will be developed. Without knowing the current state of knowledge, it is difficult to know whether one is headed in the right ''next-step'' direction. Thus, the first answer to the question introducing this section is that researchable questions come from finding the ''cutting edge'' of knowledge for a health problem with which you are familiar. This is not as demanding a condition for applied health research as it can be for basic science because good applied research usually builds on basic research. Indeed, it has been said that in applied research, the questions are easy but getting the answers is hard. This may be truedbut composing important questions that can be answered validly by current applied research methods is still a considerable challenge.",

To be sure, the light bulb must come on, but there is much work to be done both before the light will shine and afterward. The iterative components include, to name a few, the basic dimensions of the clinical problem, the plausibility and feasibility of the design, the colleagues you will work with, the other resources you can muster to address the question, and the contingencies that emerge as you conduct the trial. The main interplay will be between what you would really like to do and what is really possible to do. This is anything but a linear process, but we'll have to present it as such, given the nature of the printed worddforewarned is forearmedddon't stick to the sequence discussed in subsequent text if your question could benefit from a different sequence.

For example, for strokes, the association of anterior brain infarcts with atherothrombotic narrowing of the carotid arteries fits with the biology of the small clots often found at these narrowings, which can break off and impact in the smaller arteries of the brain, causing a stroke. The occurrence of strokes also fits with the physiology of impairment of blood flow that occurs when the narrowing exceeds 75% of the normal luminal diameter of the carotid artery in the neck. The fact that biology and physiology do not provide an adequate basis for how to deal with the problem is evident from the results of the EC-IC bypass study. Indeed, in this trial, patients with the best surgical results, in terms of increased blood flow to the brain, fared worst for prevention of stroke.",

No one who deals with stroke victims can escape the conclusion that strokes would be better prevented than treated, if a safe and affordable preventive intervention is available, because the damage caused by a completed stroke is irreversible in the brain and the loss of function strokes incur is often unrecoverable. Case series and hospital surveys have documented that both EC-IC bypass and CE procedures can be performed with a lower perioperative morbidity and mortality than the observed rates of events mentioned earlier, although some studies of the quality of care for CE showed that perioperative rates of morbidity and mortality were higher than the risk of stroke recurrence in some hospitals, especially in community hospitals with low volumes of cases. Further, in the time frames of the EC-IC bypass and CE trials, these interventions were based on biology, physiology, and anecdotal experience, and they had not been tested in large randomized trials. Thus, the basic elements were in place for an initial study question for this trial along the lines of ''Does CE do more good than harm in preventing stroke recurrence in patients with carotid circulation strokes?''",

No study could be on the extreme of the explanatory end because circumstances of testing are never ideal. Indeed, even if they could be ''ideal,'' this would differ from the ''real world'' so much that it would render the results of the study practically meaningless. On the management end, it is not possible or ethical to scientifically and unobtrusively evaluate treatments and tests without introducing so much risk of bias that the results are undependable. This is, admittedly, a matter of debate, with advocates of outcomes research and observational studies claiming that the results of RCTs can be reproducibly achieved in careful observational studies that are based, for example, on medical records.

To capture this potentially high-risk, high-response group, the study was set up as two separate trials, one for patients with high-grade stenosis (70%e99%) and one for patients with lower-grade stenosis (30%e69%). Sample sizes were estimated on the basis of a 7% annual event rate for patients with high-grade stenosis and a 4% rate for those with lower-grade stenosis. This estimation assured those who felt strongly that stenosis was correlated with event rates that an early result could be achieved for patients with higher degrees of stenosis and that their results would not be ''diluted'' by the anticipated larger numbers of patients with lower degrees of stenosis. Further, statistical rules were developed for monitoring the accumulating results so that either of these trials could be stopped early if the resultsdeither better or worse than estimateddwarranted. This approach proved not only ''politic'' but also propitious. Indeed, the risk and the responsiveness for the high-grade group were both underestimated, leading to stopping the trial with a positive result when patients had been in the trial for an average of just 18 months of a planned 60-month trial. These results were quickly conveyed to participating investigators and their patients so that they could be taken into account for subsequent care decisions. For patients in the moderate-grade stenosis group, the trial was continued for its planned duration, and a positive, but less beneficial, result was observed.",

The study is addressing the following specific questions: 1) Does carotid endarterectomy reduce the risk of subsequent stroke and stroke-related death? 2) Does the degree of carotid stenosis identify patients who will benefit most from carotid endarterectomy? and 3) Will carotid endarterectomy maintain or improve the functional status of patients over time?'' This statement of the study question (or related questions) contains four elements that are captured in the acronym, PICO: Patients, Intervention (for intervention studies only), Comparison group, and Outcomes. For good measure, and to avoid embarrassment in Chile, one could add Time (PICOT). (As one of us discovered after emphasizing the importance of PICO to future researchers in a Catholic university in Chile, ''pico'' is a slang term for an expansible part of the male anatomy.).",

This question could then be iterated for the second studydless than 70% stenosis.

Several basic principles guide the development of additional primary and secondary questions for studies. First, all primary questions must be asked ''up front,'' at the beginning of the investigation. The same is true, as far as possible, for all secondary questions. This approach ensures that the questions are ''hypothesisdriven'' (i.e., based on your predictions of what will happen) rather than ''data-driven'' (i.e., made up after the study results are [partly] in, especially to ''explain'' findings that may well be simply the play of chance). This approach also allows for proper planning and data collection for these additional questions, including estimates of sample size to determine whether the study is large enough to support reliable answers. These efforts can pay off; it will be less costly to run a study where some of the questions can be answered by data collection from only a subset of patients and where questions for which there can be no chance of a clear result are discarded along with their burden of data collection.",

It was estimated that 3,000 patients, distributed among the four study groups, would be needed to provide separate answers concerning the benefit of surgery for each level of stenosis and presence or absence of plaque. Early on in the course of the trial, it was determined through central review of the reports from surgeons at the various study sites that the presence or absence of plaque could not be reliably determined. Thus, the question concerning plaque vs. no plaque could not be answered (remember Lord Kelvin!). The sample size estimates were altered to fit the two remaining study cohorts, 600 for the high-grade stenosis group and 1,300 for the moderate-grade stenosis group.",

Sometimes, as in the example from the CE trial, the contingency will be profound enough that a study question will have to be droppeddif this is the main study question, then the trial may have to be abandoned entirely. Fortunately for the CE trial, there was more than one question, and the early detection of problems in reporting plaque led to a timely reduction in the sample size required. One could easily point fingers and say that the trial should not have proceeded in the first place if this measurement issue had not been addressed, but that is a different matter! Most of the contingencies that arise will not sink the study if you keep a close eye on the process of the study (e.g., whether patients are being recruited at the anticipated rate) and if adjustments are made that counter the problem without compromising the basic intent of the study. For example, in the CE trial, because of slow recruitment, the upper limit of 80 years for patient age was relaxed if the surgeon judged that the perioperative risk was acceptable. In any event, only patients who were mentally competent and gave their informed consent were included.",

You can plug the low recruitment leak (a very common one!) by recruiting more investigators or by relaxing entry criteria, but these changes need to be recorded and their effect, if any, on the study question needs to be described in reports of the investigation. For example, during the CE trial, standards for care for hypertension, for cholesterol lowering, and for antiplatelet treatment changed because of new evidence. The latter, in particular, had the potential for lowering the risk of stroke, the major study outcome measure. In each instance when major new findings and recommendations came out, they had to be considered by the study's steering committee and a decision had to be made about incorporating them into the protocol in a way that preserved the integrity of the study, if possibledor not, if need be. Although none of these factors changed the course of the trial for CE, the CE study results led to one other major trial being aborted.",
