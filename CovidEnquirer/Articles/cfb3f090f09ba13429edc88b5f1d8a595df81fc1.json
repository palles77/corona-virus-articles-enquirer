            "text": "Many emerging arboviruses are not transmitted by traditional mosquito vectors, but by lesser-studied arthropods such as ticks, midges, and sand flies. Small RNA (sRNA) silencing pathways are the main antiviral defence mechanism for arthropods, which lack adaptive immunity. Non-retroviral integrated RNA virus sequences (NIRVS) are one potential source of sRNAs which comprise these pathways. NIRVS are remnants of past germline RNA viral infections, where viral cDNA integrates into the host genome and is vertically transmitted. In Aedes mosquitoes, NIRVS are widespread and produce PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). These are hypothesised to target incoming viral transcripts to modulate viral titre, perhaps rendering the organism a more efficient arbovirus vector. To explore the NIRVS landscape in alternative arbovirus vectors, we validated the NIRVS landscape in Aedes spp. and then identified novel NIRVS in six medically relevant arthropods and also in Drosophila melanogaster. We identified novel NIRVS in Phlebotomus papatasi, Culicoides sonorensis, Rhipicephalus microplus, Anopheles gambiae, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Ixodes scapularis. Due to their unexpected abundance, we further characterised NIRVS in the blacklegged tick I. scapularis (n = 143). Interestingly, NIRVS are not enriched in R. microplus, another hard tick, suggesting this is an Ixodes-specific adaptation. I. scapularis NIRVS are enriched in bunya-and orthomyxo-like sequences, reflecting that ticks are a dominant host for these virus groups. Unlike in mosquitoes, I. scapularis NIRVS are more commonly derived from the nonstructural region (replicase) of negative-sense viruses, as opposed to structural regions (e.g. glycoprotein). Like other arthropods, I. scapularis NIRVS preferentially integrate into genomic piRNA clusters, and serve as a template for primary piRNA production in the commonly used embryonic I. scapularis ISE6 cell line. Interestingly, we identified a two-fold enrichment of nonlong terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons, in genomic proximity to NIRVS, contrasting with studeis in Ae. aegypti, where LTR retrotransposons are instead associated with NIRVS formation. We characterised NIRVS phylogeny and integration patterns in the important vector, I. scapularis, revealing they are distinct from those in Aedes spp. Future studies will explore the possible antiviral mechanism conferred by NIRVS to I. scapularis,which may help the transmission of pathogenic arboviruses. Finally, this study explored NIRVS as an untapped wealth of viral diversity in arthropods.",

            "text": "Two classes of arthropods transmit arboviruses to mammals: insects and arachnids (Mellor 2000) . All insect vectors are classified into the order Diptera (true flies). Of these, mosquitoes (Culicidae) within the genera Aedes and Culex are the most significant arbovirus vectors, transmitting, e.g. flaviviruses (e.g. Dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV) and Zika virus (ZIKV)) and togaviruses (e.g. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Ross River virus (RRV)) ( Table 1) . Collectively, these viruses cause over 400 million human infections per year and over 20,000 deaths (LaBeaud, Bashir, and King 2011; Bhatt et al. 2013; WHO 2014) . Sand flies (Psychodidae) and midges (Ceratopogonidae) also transmit pathogenic viruses of humans and livestock, mostly in Southern Europe (Table 1) (Mellor, Boorman, and Baylis 2000; Depaquit et al. 2010) . Of the arachnids, ticks (order Ixodida) are the only group known to transmit arboviruses and are second only to mosquitoes in the diversity of viruses they can transmit (Table 1) (Mansfield et al. 2017 ). Since 2000, several emerging tick-borne viruses have caused human outbreaks in Europe, China, North America, India, and the Middle East (Mansfield et al. 2017) . Compared with mosquitoes, tick-borne viral infections are under-sampled and understudied. In addition, no specific treatments are available, and vaccines exist only for three tick-borne viruses (Louping-ill virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, and Kyasanur Forest disease virus) but are not widely distributed (Mansfield et al. 2017) .",

This suggests an innate ability to control viral titre, while still permitting arboviral transmission to the next host (Mellor 2000; Blair 2011 ). However, not all haematophagous arthropods are efficient vectors for the same virus. The ability of a particular virus to replicate within a host is referred to as vector competence (Hardy et al. 1983) . Understanding the factors that influence vector competence is of practical interest, as modifying these can foster the development of targeted arboviral control strategies (Weiss and Aksoy 2011) .",

Arthropods lack an adaptive immune response and rely entirely on innate immunity to control viral infections (Keene et al. 2004; Sanchez-Vargas et al. 2009 ). Small RNA (sRNA) silencing pathways (sRNA SPs), such as RNA interference (RNAi), are a major component of arthropod immunity (Bronkhorst and van Rij 2014) . RNAi is a gene-silencing mechanism modulated by sRNAs, the bestdescribed family of which are small interfering RNAs (siRNAs, 20-25 nt in length). The siRNA pathway is triggered by the accumulation of dsRNA which is cleaved to generate siRNAs. The interaction of siRNAs with proteins of the Argonaute family triggers the silencing of target RNAs (e.g. viral transcripts) mediated by the RNA-induced silencing complex. In mosquitoes, suppression of RNAi enhances the accumulation of viral RNA in Anopheles gambiae (O'nyong nyong virus) and Ae. aegypti (Sindbis virus) and in some cases causes increased mortality (Keene et al. 2004; Campbell et al. 2008; Myles et al. 2008) . In ticks, knockdown of key proteins involved in RNAi results in a significant increase of tick-borne encephalitis virus RNA in Ixodes cells (Weisheit et al. 2015) , suggesting a similar defence mechanism.",

            "text": "PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) (25-30 nt) were discovered in Drosophila, where they defend against the deleterious effects of transposable elements (TEs) in the germ-line . piRNAs are distinct from other sRNA classes as they interact with a distinct set of proteins (Piwi proteins), and they arise from a ssRNA, not a dsRNA, precursor (Siomi et al. 2011 ). There are two piRNA biogenesis pathways. Primary piRNAs are generated from host transcripts (usually arising from transposon-rich genomic piRNA clusters) that are cleaved to generate 25-30 nt piRNAs. These are amplified via the pingpong cycle, leading to the cleavage of target RNA (e.g. active transposons), producing secondary piRNAs. While piRNA sequences are not conserved between organisms, primary piRNAs unequivocally have a uridine at their 5 0 end (1 U bias), and secondary piRNAs have an adenine bias at the tenth nt from their 5 0 end (10 A bias) (Aravin, Hannon, and Brennecke 2007) . Unlike in Drosophila, mosquitoes can use piRNAs to mount an antiviral defence in cooperation with other sRNA SPs in both somatic and germ cells (Morazzani et al. 2012) . Mosquito piRNAs can be directly produced from exogenous viral RNA, indicating that piRNAs may be derived from both endogenous and exogenous sources, and may play an antiviral role (Vodovar et al. 2012; Miesen, Girardi, and van Rij 2015) . Although recent studies indicate widespread conservation of the piRNA pathway among arthropods (Lewis et al. 2018) , less is known about whether they could play an antiviral role in non-mosquito arthropods.",

NIRVS arise from the reverse transcription of viral RNA into cDNA and its integration into the genome of a host germ cell, followed by vertical transmission to offspring (Katzourakis and Gifford 2010) . RNA viruses do not integrate into the host genome as part of their lifecycle, so it was initially thought that integration of non-retrotranscribing viruses was serendipitous-especially in vertebrate genomes which contain relatively few insertions (Katzourakis and Gifford 2010 ). Yet recent evidence has highlighted the abundance of NIRVS in some arthropod genomes-e.g., Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus contain >100 NIRVS from over eight RNA virus families encompassing \u00fessRNA, \u00c0ssRNA, and dsRNA viral groups (Palatini et al. 2017; Whitfield et al. 2017) . Additionally, large-scale sequence analysis has shown that many of these NIRVS cluster within piRNA producing genomic regions and produce primary piRNAs (Whitfield et al. 2017; Ter Horst et al. 2018) . This suggests that NIRVS have a functional role, perhaps involving the piRNA pathway.",

In its exogenous state, an RNA virus will typically evolve at 10 \u00c03 substitutions/site/year (Jenkins et al. 2002) , but when integrated into a eukaryotic genome, will evolve several orders of magnitude more slowly (Aiewsakun and Katzourakis 2015) . NIRVS represent near-intact ancient viral sequences, and so can be useful to estimate the timescale of long-term viral evolution, e.g., dating the emergence of modern viral families (Belyi, Levine, and Skalka 2010) . NIRVS are also a useful tool to expand the known host range of viral families, as finding a particular NIRVS family in a genome indicates an ancestral infection event of that host lineage (Aiewsakun and Katzourakis 2015) . The true spectrum of arthropod-infecting RNA viruses is only recently coming to light (Shi et al. 2016 ) and further information on host range and viral diversity can be assisted by the identification and analysis of NIRVS in arthropod genomes.",

We aimed to examine the spectrum of NIRVS in arbovirus vectors other than Aedes mosquitoes, which represent a threat in the context of emerging viruses. Using the well-studied genomes of Aedes mosquitoes to validate our analysis, we employed a bioinformatic pipeline to characterise NIRVS in seven non-Aedes arbovirus vectors that have representative genomic sequences (Table 1 and Fig. 1 ).",

            "text": "Many arthropods contain a high proportion of TEs in their genomes; Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti contain about 68 and 47 per cent TEs, respectively (Nene et al. 2007; Chen et al. 2015) . Due to the important role of repeat sequences in arthropod evolution (Peccoud et al. 2017 ), we suspected that many of the NIRVS identified were generated due to post-insertion duplication and not by distinct integration events. Using a ClustalW alignment and distance matrix, we calculated whether NIRVS shared high sequence identity with other NIRVS within the genome. Of 276 NIRVS in Ae. aegypti, 126 (46%) shared at least 98 per cent nt identity with at least one other NIRVS. In Ae. albopictus, this number was 196 (71%), in I. scapularis it was 26 (18%); 20 in Cx. quinquefasciatus (71%), and 11 in An. gambiae (44%) (Supplementary Table S4 ). There was no evidence of duplicated NIRVS in other organisms with multiple NIRVS (C. sonorensis and P. papatasi) (Supplementary Table S4 ). In Ae. aegypti and I. scapularis, we visually represented duplicated NIRVS within the groups Mononegavirales, Bunyavirales, and Orthomyxoviridae (Fig. 5 ). A similar pattern was observed in I. scapularis where most \u00c0ssRNA NIRVS were classified in the Mononegavirales in either the Rhabdoviridae (n = 44 [31% of \u00c0ssRNA NIRVS]) or among unclassified mononegaviruses (n = 48, 34%) (Fig. 2) . NIRVS related to bunyaviruses (n = 29, 20%) were notably more abundant than in dipterans, and evenly distributed among the Phenuiviridae (n = 11, 8%) and Nairoviridae (n = 18, 13%) (Fig. 2) . Orthomyxo-like NIRVS (n = 19, 13%) were the next most prevalent, followed by the Chuviridae (n = 2, 1%) (Fig. 2) . In Cx. quinquefasciatus and An. gambiae, the \u00c0ssRNA NIRVS were related to unclassified mononegaviruses (n = 18 and n = 13 [64 and 54% \u00c0ssRNA NIRVS, respectively]), chuviruses (both n = 9 [32 and 38%, respectively]), or rhabdoviruses (Cx. quinquefasciatus n = 1, 4%) (Fig. 2 ). An. gambiae also contained both one phasma-and one phenui-like insertion (Supplementary Table S2 Table S2 ). This pattern was consistent for Cx. quinquefasciatus (n = 28/28, 100%) and An. gambiae (n = 22/22, 100%) ( Fig. 2A) . Notably, I. scapularis possessed more nonstructural [L] region integrations from mononega-like viruses (n = 76/94, 81%), with the remainder from structural regions (n = 18/94, 19%) ( Fig. 2A) . To visually demonstrate this difference, a comparative alignment between negative-sense NIRVS in Ae. aegypti and I. scapularis was created, demonstrating the skew towards either structural or non-structural integration in each organism (Fig. 5A) .",

The NP-derived nairo-like NIRVS falls into an Ixodes-specific cluster within the Nairoviridae, distinct from several clusters infecting either hard ticks (Ixodidae) or soft ticks (Argasidae) (Fig. 6E) .

To determine whether this was the case in our own dataset, we analysed a publicly available I. scapularis sRNA dataset for the presence of piRNAs derived from NIRVS loci (BioProject accession PRJNA315659). Out of 132,048,347 sRNA reads originating from four independent sequencing runs, 68,823 (0.05%) mapped exactly to at least one NIRVS. These originated primarily from NIRVS related to rhabdoviruses (35.6%), unassigned mononegaviruses (24.2%), orthomyxoviruses (18.5%), phenuiviruses (16.2%), nairoviruses (3.6%), and chuviruses (1.9%); these proportions are very similar to the abundance of each NIRVS family within the genome (Fig. 7A) . The most abundant NIRVS-derived sRNAs were 28 nt in length (0.046% total 28-mers), followed by 29 nt (0.045%), 27 nt (0.039%), 26 nt (0.035%), 30 nt (0.034%), 25 nt (0.028%), 24 nt (0.017%), 23 nt (0.012%), 20 nt (0.008%), 21 nt (0.007%), 22 nt (0.004%), and 19 nt (0.003%) (Fig. 7B) . Additionally, NIRVSderived sRNAs were predominantly antisense (20,538 reads, 90.9%) as opposed to sense (2,067 reads, 9.1%) (Fig. 7B) . The length of the NIRVS-derived sRNAs (primarily 25-30 nt sRNAs) their predominantly antisense nature, and the strong bias for a uridine at their 5 0 position make them strongly reminiscent of primary piRNAs (Fig. 7B and C) .",

ML phylogenetic trees of six NIRVS from the blacklegged tick I. scapularis. Following identification of 143 NIRVS within the I. scapularis genome, the longest from each family of negative-sense viruses was selected for phylogenetic analysis (n \u00bc 5). A dsRNA NIRVS was also selected as it was the unique NIRVS of this type identified (A). First, a tBLASTn search was performed using the NIRVS against the NCBI nr database to generate a list of close matches. The top 25 most closely related sequences were chosen, as well a more distantly related outgroup sequence. Sequences were aligned with MAFFT (v7.017) and trimmed with trimAl (v1.4.1). A RAxML period and avoiding the deleterious effects of viral infection. NIRVS are proposed to be a heritable antiviral defence mechanism, interacting with sRNA SPs to attenuate transcripts of an infecting virus (Palatini et al. 2017) . It is now well-established that NIRVS accumulation is a feature of multiple arthropod classes (Ter Horst et al. 2018 ). Yet besides Aedes spp., an in-depth analysis of NIRVS in emerging arbovirus vectors is lacking. To address this gap, we selected six non-Aedes arbovirus vectors for NIRVS analysis. We uncovered more NIRVS in the mosquitoes Cx. quinquefasciatus and An. gambiae than reported previously, and we characterised novel NIRVS in the non-mosquito dipterans C. sonorensis and P. papatasi, and in the Asian blue tick R. microplus. The focus of our study, however, became the preponderance of NIRVS in the deer tick I. scapularis, which exhibit unusual characteristics and are likely to be associated with the piRNA pathway.",

(2017) (n = 122) who used a similar BLAST-based approach, and a recent version of the same genome (AaegL3.0) (Palatini et al. 2017 ). Our results may reflect a more extensive range of query viruses (n = 1,933 vs. n = 425). Alternatively, Whitfield et al. (2017) reported 472 NIRVS in Ae. aegypti, but used a long-read based genome assembly for NIRVS identification. Since the current AaegL5.0 assembly is based on short-read technology, highly repetitive NIRVS-rich regions may be masked (Dudchenko et al. 2017; Whitfield et al. 2017) . These variable figures suggest that the number of NIRVS reported is not definitive but is contingent on filtering parameters and the quality of host genome assembly.",

However, the true number of NIRVS in Ae. albopictus is probably as high as or higher than Ae. aegypti, as it contains an even higher proportion of TEs (Chen et al. 2015) , including LTR retrotransposons which may be responsible for NIRVS formation. Despite the discrepancies, both studies report similar NIRVS characteristics. These NIRVS were dominated by insertions from the structural gene-coding regions (N and G) of negative-sense viruses (predominantly mononegaviruses), with fewer insertions from \u00fessRNA and dsRNA viruses. This indicates that the methodology of the current study, which identified NIRVS without generating excessive false positive hits, is robust.",

However, viral proteins can be repurposed by their hosts (exapted) in remarkable instances of horizontal evolution (Koonin and Krupovic 2018) . A BLAST hit in six dipteran genomes revealed the presence of a hypothetical protein containing a nido-like domain ( Table S5 ). Although hits to nidoviruses still arose, homology to these was generally weaker than to other insect proteins (e.g. in Ae. aegypti), the hypothetical protein LOC5579059 exhibited 52 matches to uncharacterised proteins from other insects (E-values ranging from 0 to 2.07E \u00c019 ) before a viral hit occured (E-value 2.43E \u00c019 ) (Supplementary Table S5 ). The pp1a nidovirus protein, to which BLAST matches were generated, is a multifunctional replicase enzyme (Ziebuhr 2006) . We speculated that this region of similarity could signify a conserved enzymatic function between virus and eukaryote, e.g. helicase; however, no functional protein motifs were observed in this viral region. Due to the nature of the putative NIRVS it could represent an exapted viral protein which integrated prior to the divergence of the hosts, now serving a novel function in present-day lineages. This possibility is especially interesting as arthropods are predicted to be the origin of some present-day viral groups (Marklewitz et al. 2015) . Alternatively, it could represent a case of host-to-virus exaptation, or protein mimicry by the virus (Alcami 2003) , although these possibilities are unlikely in the case of an RNA virus. Further analysis of these NIRVS are beyond the scope of this manuscript, but these possibilities present an intriguing opportunity for future analysis.",

Yet among the NNS viral insertions, we observed a bias towards non-structural region integration (L protein) as opposed to structural regions (G and N), which are conversely more abundant in mosquitoes (Fig. 5A ). This bias towards NIRVS from the structural region of negative-sense viruses is thought to reflect relative mRNA abundance during infection, where the NP is the most abundant and L the least (Holmes 2011) .

In contrast, all other surveyed organisms contained few SNS virus-like NIRVS (Ae. aegypti n = 6, Ae. albopictus n = 13, An. gambiae n = 2, C. sonorensis n = 3, R. microplus n = 1) ( Fig. 2 ; Supplementary Table S2 ). Specifically, the orthomyxo-like NIRVS in I. scapularis were exclusively related to tick-borne viruses in the genus Quaranjavirus (Presti et al. 2009 ). Orthomyxoviruses replicate in the nucleus (Ruigrok et al. 2010) , where proximity to the host genome may predispose them to NIRVS formation. However, studies on orthomyxovirus replication are heavily biased towards influenza viruses, and mechanisms of quaranjavirus replication are little explored. Similar observations were made for the bunya-like insertions, again abundant in I. scapularis (n = 30) despite being infrequent in other surveyed organisms. These could be classified as phenuilike or nairo-like (related to the Phenuiviridae or Nairoviridae). In contrast, phasma-like (Phasmaviridae-related) insertions were confined to Ae. aegypti, Ae. albopictus, P. papatasi, and An. gambiae (Supplementary Table S2 ). This mirrors the known host range of these families, whereby the Nairoviridae is tick-borne, the Phenuiviridae infects insects and arachnids, and the Phasmaviridae is insect-borne (Lasecka and Baron 2014) . Overall, the detection of multiple SNS viral insertions here suggests that ticks are the dominant hosts of these viral groups.",

This is surprising, as tick-borne flaviviruses are vertically transmitted in nature (Brackney and Armstrong 2016) .

Alternatively, since most tick-borne arboviruses are confined to certain groups (Bunyavirales, Orthomyxoviridae, Flaviviridae), tick viruses outside these groups are significantly under-sampled (Junglen 2016) . Accordingly, identification of tick-specific viruses in other groups may reveal positive-sense NIRVS which are too divergent to be detected here.",

Our data suggest that NIRVS accumulation is perhaps confined to Ixodes ticks, an observation validated by another study which also identified numerous NIRVS in I. ricinus (Ter Horst et al. 2018) . This difference could reflect factors such as inefficient vertical viral transmission among Rhipicephalus spp., or an alternative TE landscape which does not favour NIRVS formation.

            "text": "Most of the NIRVS here appeared to originate from tickspecific viral groups (Fig. 6 ). An exception was NIRVS from the genus Quaranjavirus (Orthomyxoviridae) (Fig. 6C) . Quaranjaviruses appear to have a dual vertebrate-arthropod host range; e.g., Wellfleet Bay virus can cause mass mortality in wild bird populations (Allison et al. 2015) . The presence of NIRVS derived from this group therefore implies the potential for vertical transmission of quaranjaviruses, which has implications for the management of these viruses in wild tick populations. 4.7 NIRVS are associated with the piRNA pathway in I. scapularis sRNA SPs are the key antiviral response in insects (Blair and Olson 2015) , yet current research is heavily biased towards mosquitoes. Several studies indicate involvement of an sRNA response in tick flaviviral infection (Schnettler et al. 2014; Weisheit et al. 2015 ), yet the area is understudied. In particular, the observation that NIRVS are proximal to piRNA clusters for a variety of arthropods suggests that NIRVS either (1) integrate into these clusters preferentially or (2) are positively selected for post-integration (Palatini et al. 2017; Whitfield et al. 2017; Ter Horst et al. 2018) . Interestingly, despite the identification of multiple NIRVS in I. scapularis in another study, no association with piRNA clusters was noted (Ter Horst et al. 2018 ). Repetition of this analysis for our own dataset uncovered a strong preference for integration into predicted piRNA sites in the I. scapularis genome (P ( 0.000001). Despite this discrepancy, our observation of many NIRVS-derived piRNAs, as discussed below, suggests that our clustering analysis was robust.",

To investigate this phenomenon in the blacklegged tick, we analysed datasets from I. scapularis ISE6 cells (n = 4) for the presence of NIRVS-derived sRNAs. We found that NIRVS-derived sRNAs from all families (except a partiti-like insertion) were produced proportionally to their abundance within the genome (Fig. 7A ). Further analysis revealed that these sRNAs exhibited characteristics of primary piRNAs; specifically; they were primarily 25-0 nt in length, antisense, and had the canonical 1U piRNA bias ( Fig. 7B and C) . This strengthens the hypothesis that the NIRVS-piRNA association exists in I. scapularis as it does in other arthropods. Further studies can elucidate whether NIRVSderived piRNAs are upregulated upon viral infection, and whether suppressing the piRNA pathway confers an antiviral effect. Additionally, virus-specific piRNA production is known to differ between germ-line (the origin of the ISE6 cell line) and somatic tissues in most arthropods (Lewis et al. 2018) . Therefore, it would be interesting to determine whether these NIRVS-derived piRNAs are also produced in somatic tissues where an infecting virus encounters the tick's main antiviral defences.",

This requires RT activity, which is likely provided by the retroelements common in eukaryotic genomes (Holmes 2011) . Although the association between NIRVS and the piRNA pathway is clear for a variety of arthropods, analysis of the TE classes associated with NIRVS only exists for Ae. aegypti, where LTR retrotransposons are increased two-fold in NIRVS-rich regions (Palatini et al. 2017 ). Our analysis indicated that non-LTR retrotransposons were instead two-fold enriched (6.70 vs. 11.55%) in NIRVS-associated regions in the I. scapularis genome, while LTR retrotransposon sequences were not increased (0.64 vs. 0.87%) ( Table 4 ). This association corresponds to the diminished proportion of LTR retrotransposons in ticks (0.64% of the genome) compared with mosquitoes (about 15% in the genomes of Ae. albopictus, Ae. aegypti, and Cx. quinquefasciatus) (Chen et al. 2015; Gulia-Nuss et al. 2016) . Our data suggest that the RT activity of non-LTR retrotransposons, particularly I, L1, and R1 elements, which were increased in NIRVS-rich regions (Table 4) , might be responsible for NIRVS formation in ixodid ticks.

(A) Comparative genomic alignment of mononega-like NIRVS to a reference genome. Mononegaviruses, as defined here, include the order Mononegavirales and unclassified relatives, including the Chuviridae family. (B) Comparative genomic alignment of bunyavirus-like NIRVS to a reference bunyavirus (order Bunyavirales) and (C) comparative genomic alignment of orthomyxo-like NIRVS to a reference orthomyxovirus (family Orthomyxoviridae and unclassified relatives). NIRVS are the same colour if they represent duplications of the same sequence (>95% identity over >200 nt). NIRVS derived from insertions with no duplication are coloured black.
