Educational activity and setting: Student live debates replaced 15% of a traditional lecture-based course. Twelve healthcare controversies were debated by student teams each year. Student perception of debate utility and opinion on topics, pre-and post-debate, were measured via a voluntary survey. Both peer and instructor's assessments of team performances, as well as individual student performance on the debate-based questions on course exams, contributed to course grade. Findings: The average survey response rates were 76% (2014) and 86% (2015). Fifteen-54% of student respondents changed their opinion on individual debate topics due to the debates. Although exam performance on debate-based questions was no better than on lecture-based questions, respondents who found the debates useful or very useful in mastering course material increased by 19% post versus pre-debate surveys. Summary: Debates are an effective active learning tool for engaging students in controversial subjects. Assessment of student performance should include student and instructor evaluations, and can be incorporated into the course grade.",

Active learning activities are effective tools to engage students and encourage learning in the traditional classroom lecture setting. [1] [2] [3] For example, a recent study by Lucas et al. 4 evaluating the correlation between active learning and core content retention that compared examination scores from course content delivered by active learning methods to that delivered by slide-based lectures found higher scores from sections delivered by active learning. Furthermore, active learning has been shown in different fields to increase critical thinking, improve self-reported student engagement, and deepen understanding of course material. [5] [6] [7] reported that students valued the mix of traditional lecturing with active learning activities over traditional lecturing alone because the active learning activities helped to maintain their interest and attention. It is, therefore, not surprising that the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE) Standards require incorporation of active learning strategies in the pharmacy curriculum. 9 In addition, the Center for the Advancement of Pharmacy Education (CAPE) Educational",

[11] [12] [13] In pharmacy, debates have been used in core courses including pharmacotherapy and in electives, for example self-care and ambulatory care. Debates have also been incorporated in core social and administrative sciences courses, for example ethics and healthcare delivery. 11, [14] [15] [16] [17] Different debate formats, live or online, individual or team-based, and different assessments of the utility of this active learning tool have been described in the literature. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] Debates have been used effectively to stimulate interest, promote active class participation, and enhance presentation, research, and critical thinking skills in professional programs. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] Literature describing the use of live student debates to deliver a significant amount of content previously delivered by lecture in required pharmacy courses, however, is limited. 15 Furthermore, the literature on debates as an effective active learning strategy in required didactic pharmacy social and administrative sciences courses to increase student awareness of opposing views about healthcare delivery or ethical dilemmas is also limited. 11, 16 The need remains to evaluate the impact of student debates as an active learning strategy on student learning and perception of controversial issues in health care delivery, especially in a live large classroom setting.",

The course meets once a week for a two-hour class-meeting and in previous years had consisted of only traditional lecture and instructor led discussion format. In 2014, live student debates were introduced as an integral part of the course to enhance active learning. Live student debates replaced about 15% of course previously presented by an instructor via lecture presentations. Course content replaced with debates mostly focused on areas of healthcare or healthcare delivery controversy or areas with diverse opinions. Some healthcare ethical dilemmas relevant to the course were included because the instructor had exposed the students, in a previous semester course, to materials on ethics and professionalism. This study was designed to describe the incorporation of live student debates and to analyze the effectiveness and students' perception of the usefulness of these debates in the course in 2014. The study was extended to the 2015 course offering to obtain two years of data and to be able to analyze the effect of several improvements over the inaugural year.",

Students were given 12 possible debate topics. Eleven of the 12 possible topics are listed in Table 1 . For the twelfth topic each year, students choose a country in Europe or Canada and debate whether their healthcare system was better than or worse than the U.S. healthcare system. In 2014, there was no team representing the U.S. as in 2015. From the 12 topics, the debate teams were asked to choose and rank up to five in order of preference for the topic and to indicate preference for the debate position, either arguing in favor of, \"pro,\" or against the topic, \"con.\" Teams were then assigned topics based either on their selected preferences or availability of topics. There was one debate per week following a traditional lecture, for 12 of the 16 scheduled class meetings. The entire debate session lasted an average of 30 min each of the 12 two-hour class periods in 2014 and 2015. In both years, students took a voluntary survey after each debate where they indicated which team they believed to have won the debate and whether the debates changed their minds about that issue in healthcare delivery.",

In both years, the same instructor graded each debate and assigned a team grade. In 2014 the team grade was worth 10% points of the final course grade and was based on the team slideshow presentation which was required to be submitted a day before the debate. The instructor assessed the slide presentation and returned it to the group with suggestions for revision if it did not address the issue adequately or did not meet the course objectives. Teams could also meet with the instructor while developing their presentation for guidance. The goal was to make sure the topic was adequately covered by the team. A team received full credit if they included and presented at least four points, had verifiable references for each point, and gave a cogent concluding remark. The instructor formulated one multiple-choice question from each team's presentation that was included on either the mid-term or final exams in the course, depending on when the team debated, for a total of 26 questions on course exams. In 2015, a few changes were made to the debate grading, based on student feedback from 2014 end-of-course evaluations. Student feedback included some complaints about the number of debate-based questions added to the course exams, as well as student desire to provide peer assessment of the debate teams beyond stating which team won. In 2015, the team debate grade was increased to 15% of the course grade from the 10% in 2014. Student peer review was added to instructor review for the team debate grade, with 70% of the total team grade from the instructor's assessment and 30% from Would the Affordable Care Act eventually lead to an efficient healthcare system? 2",

In 2014, 20% and 23% of the mid-term and final exams questions, respectively, were from the debates. In addition to the disproportionate number of debate-based questions in both exams, in the finals, the students took exams in another course in the morning prior to USHD exams in the afternoon. This could explain why there was a statistically significant difference in performance between the lecture-based questions and debate-based questions. In 2015, when the debate based questions were reduced to those from six debate presentations, there was no statistically significant difference in the percentage of students' scores in both traditional and debate based questions. Debates are already believed to fall under the higher order in Blooms' Taxonomy of Learning, where the skill acquired is more of the higher level of 'shows-how' instead of 'know or knows how' (which are of the lower level). 11,21 A limitation of this study was that it was not designed to robustly test the difference between traditional and debate-based question performance. Additionally, multiplechoice questions were used because of the size of the class instead of a more appropriate higher order learning assessment tool. The items covered in each was not the same, and the number of questions from the debates was small compared to those from the lectures (26 out of 117 in 2014, 9 out of 71 in 2015).",

Policy-heavy courses are often laden with strong ideological stands and it was difficult to tell if students were able to take off those filters in deciding if they changed their minds or not; perhaps not allowing students to choose \"I don't know\" post-debate reduced our ability to distinguish among those who truly changed their minds. Additionally, a student indication of a changed mind about a controversial topic is not necessarily an indication of learning, but rather showing they were engaged enough to change their opinion. The objective of the debates was not to change students' minds on these controversial issues but to present them with information from both sides of the issue to improve their knowledge of the subject and help them formulate their own decisions.",
