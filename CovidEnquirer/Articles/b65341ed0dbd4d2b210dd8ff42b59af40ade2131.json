            "text": "Lesson one: no substitute for continuous vigilance A 60-year-old man was admitted on June 13th, 2012, to a hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, with severe pneumonia and multi-organ failure. The patient died after 11 days of hospitalization. 2 Indirect immunofluorescence assays and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for widely occurring respiratory viruses failed to identify an infective aetiology. Interestingly, cytopathic changes consistent with viral replication were noted in LLC-MK2 and Vero cell cultures of the patient's respiratory samples. Slides of the infected cell cultures reacted strongly with the patient's serum but not with any of 2400 control sera stored in the same hospital. However, pancoronavirus PCR yielded positive results. The PCR fragments were sequenced at the Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, and phylogenetic analysis showed that the novel coronavirus belonged to lineage C of the genus betacoronavirus. 2, 3 On 20 September 2012, an email was posted on Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases Mail (ProMED-mail) announcing the discovery of a novel human coronavirus. 4 Meanwhile, a critically ill 49-year-old Qatari man was transferred by air ambulance on September 11th, 2012, to a hospital in England. 5 He had developed respiratory symptoms on September 3rd followed by multi-organ failure. His upper and lower respiratory tract samples were negative for influenza A/B, parainfluenza 1e4, RSV A/B, human metapneumovirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus, adenovirus, human bocavirus, and the human coronaviruses (NL63, 229E, OC43, HKU1). On September 21st, 2012, one day after the above ProMED-mail posting, the patient's respiratory samples tested positive by pancoronavirus PCR. Once sequenced, a 250 base-pair fragment from this isolate showed 99.5% homology with the Erasmus Medical Centre's isolate. 5 The third patient was a 45-year-old man who presented to a hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on October 10th, 2012, with severe pneumonia and renal failure. MERS-CoV was detected in samples from the patient's upper and lower respiratory tract. 6 Prior to all of this, an outbreak of respiratory illness was reported in April 2012 from an intensive care unit in a hospital in Zarqa, Jordan. 7 A retrospective epidemiological investigation in November 2012 identified 13 probable cases, two of whom had died. MERS-CoV was detected by reverse transcription (RT)ePCR in stored samples from the two deceased patients. 8 Seven more were subsequently confirmed by serological testing. 9 A pattern began to emerge, characterized by severe pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and an epidemiological link to a country in the Middle East. In May 2013, the virus, which had been initially known as human coronaviruseErasmus Medical Centre (hCoV-EMC), was named the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). 10 Notably, phylogenetic analysis of the first five available MERS-CoV sequences suggested a common ancestor dating back to mid-2011. 11 Furthermore, anti-MERS-CoV antibodies were detected in 15 out of 10,009 serum samples [0.15%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.09e0.24%] obtained between December 2012 and December 2013 from 13 provinces in Saudi Arabia. 12 The authors extrapolated that just fewer than 45,000 individuals (44, 951; 95% CI: 26, 971e71, 922) in Saudi Arabia could be seropositive for MERS-CoV. 12 It is therefore reasonable to assume that human MERS-CoV infections had taken place in the region for some considerable time before it was identified. It is possible that the identification of the virus might have been delayed even more, had it not been for the meticulous investigation by a single virologist, Dr A.M. Zaki, of the first reported case of MERS-CoV. 2 The first lesson one has to learn from MERS-CoV and its discovery is that continuous vigilance and perseverance with diagnostic investigation of undiagnosed infectious diseases are essential to identify emerging pathogens.",

For example, screening identified secondary MERS-CoV infections in only 4% of 280 close family contacts and 2% of 5065 healthcare contacts. 37,38 Moreover, no secondary cases were identified following extensive epidemiological investigations of imported cases in the UK, Germany, France, Greece, The Netherlands, and the USA. 39e46 It has been phylogenetically demonstrated that MERS-CoV transmission chains have not extended beyond two to three months and that the virus has remained genetically stable over the past three years. 47, 48 Given an effective reproduction number (R 0 ) of less than one, human-to-human MERS-CoV could be readily interrupted with effective preventive interventions. 49, 50 Indeed, even the most explosive hospital outbreaks of MERS-CoV infection, such those that occurred in Jeddah and Riyadh in April to May 2014, were brought under control through a strategy based on early case detection and implementation of appropriate infection prevention and control measures; namely contact and droplet precautions for general care in addition to airborne precautions for aerosolgenerating procedures such as intubation and respiratory tract suctioning. 51e53 The poor prognosis associated with MERS-CoV, especially in patients with multiple comorbidities, and the lack of effective anti-viral therapy make appropriate infection prevention and control all-important. Just as is true for most infectious diseases, MERS-CoV reminds us again that prevention is better than cure.",

Such guidelines are inevitably based on incomplete evidence and hence may not be comprehensive or applicable in all situations. Clinical acumen and heightened medical awareness are essential for early detection of unusual MERS-CoV cases and to prevent delays in diagnosis and to mitigate additional exposures. 61",

A 190-nucleotide fragment of MERS-CoV RNA was detected in one faecal pellet from an Egyptian tomb bat. The sequenced amplification product was genetically identical to the MERS-CoV sequence obtained from the index human case. 64 More recently, a closely related coronavirus was isolated from bats in South Africa, suggesting that MERS-CoV ancestors might exist in Old World bats. 65, 66 To date, no further evidence is available to confirm the role of bats as natural hosts or reservoirs for MERS-CoV.",

A national serosurvey in Saudi Arabia found prevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies that was 15 times higher in camel shepherds (P \u00bc 0.0004) and 23 times higher in slaughterhouse workers (P < 0.0001), compared with the general population. 12 Similarly, MERS-CoV serology was positive in individuals who had occupational exposure to dromedary camels in Qatar but not in those without such exposure. 86 On the other hand, MERS-CoV antibodies were not detected in sera obtained from individuals who had close contact with camels that had documented MERS-CoV infection two to three months earlier. 87 Likewise, screened slaughterhouse workers and other animal workers in Western and Southern Saudi Arabia were all seronegative for MERS-CoV antibodies. 88, 89 Collectively, the available data strongly suggest that MERS-CoV is highly prevalent in dromedary camels in the Arabian Peninsula and that transmission of infection from camels to humans, although inefficient, does occur. However, the exact mechanism and route of infection it is still unclear. infections. 30, 94, 95, 97 One pertinent cause for concern has been the potential global spread of MERS-CoV during the annual Hajj pilgrimage when millions of Muslims from around the world gather in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. 98e102 Though those concerns are well founded, several surveillance studies over the past three years have not identified any MERS-CoV infections among Hajj pilgrims while they are in Saudi Arabia or after their return to their home countries. 103e108 The situation was entirely different in the recent outbreak in South Korea where a single imported case resulted in a total of 186 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including 36 deaths. 109 The index patient was a 68-year-old man who developed respiratory symptoms seven days after returning to Seoul from a two-week visit to Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Qatar. 35 He sought medical care in several hospitals before he was diagnosed with MERS-CoV infection. 35,110 A combination of late recognition, overcrowding in emergency departments and hospital wards, multiple incidents of patient movement between different healthcare facilities, and delayed implementation of adequate infection control precautions culminated in the largest single outbreak of MERS-CoV infection. 35,36,110e112 The outbreak involved patients, visitors, care-givers and healthcare workers, and spanned across six different hospitals in three South Korean cities. 110, 113 Notably, phylogenetic analysis of MERS-CoV strains from South Korea revealed no significant biological changes compared to previously sequenced viruses. 114 The outbreak in South Korea was eventually controlled through a series of measures including aggressive contact identification, screening and strict isolation, and rigorous infection control precautions. 111, 115, 116 Within a few weeks, South Korea went from a country with no reported MERS-CoV cases to one that has the second largest number in the world. 116, 117 With air travel becoming readily accessible and affordable, the South Korean experience demonstrates vividly that in the context of an infectious respiratory illness, there is simply no room for complacency. Adequate assessment of patients presenting with febrile illness must include their recent travel history to enable early application of proper control measures and to expedite laboratory confirmation and appropriate clinical management.",

For example, social media were at some point rife with inaccurate information that included rumours of hospitals closed due to MERS-CoV outbreaks and certain social events being nodes for MERS-CoV transmission. The authors are aware of examples of information and photos shared on social media resulting in patients losing their right to privacy and confidentiality. Patients often cancelled their clinic appointments or scheduled surgical procedures for fear of acquiring MERS-CoV while in hospital. Some avoided attending emergency departments despite having acute problems that required medical attention. Some individuals posted videos and messages challenging the suggestion that camels may be a source of MERS-CoV infection. Scepticism and mistrust in governmental agencies and the medical community were sometimes promoted and propagated.",

The Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare did the same during their MERS-CoV outbreak. Such steps are important to gain the public's trust and to remove barriers to appropriate sources of information.
