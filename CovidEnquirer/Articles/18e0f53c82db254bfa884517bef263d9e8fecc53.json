            "text": "Toona sinensis (TS), which is also known as Cedrela sinensis, belongs to Meliaceae family, the compounds identified from this TS leaves possess a wide range of biologic functions, such as hypoglycemic effects, anti-LDL glycative activity, antioxidant activities, and inhibition of sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus replication. However, their effect against cancer cells is not well explored. In this study, to understand the cytotoxic effect and molecular mechanism stimulated by TSL-1 (TS leaf extract fraction) we employed three different non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines: H441 cells (lung adenocarcinoma), H661 cells (lung large cell carcinoma) and H520 cells (lung squamous cell carcinoma). IC50 value was varied between these three cell lines, the least IC 50 value was observed in TSL-1-treated H661cells. Exposure of NSCLC cells to TSL-1 caused cell-cycle arrest in subG1 phase and caused apoptosis. Moreover, TSL-1 treatment decreased the cell-cycle regulators; cyclin D1 and CDK4 proteins by up regulating p27 expression in a dosedependent manner. Thus, the TSL-1-induced apoptosis was further confirmed by cell morphology, subG1 peak accumulation, poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, propidium iodide (PI)-Annexin-V double staining, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay. The decreased Bcl2 protein level was concurrent with an increased Bax protein level in all 3 cell lines. Additionally, the tumoricidal effect of TSL-1 was measured using a xenograft model, after 5 weeks of TSL-1 treatment by various regimen caused regression of tumor. Taken together both these in vitro and in vivo studies revealed that TSL-1 is a potent inhibitor against NSCLC growth and our provoking result suggest that TSL-1 can be a better nutriceutical as a singlet or along withdoublet agents (taxane, vinorelbine, and gemcitabine) for treating NSCLC.

            "text": "In world wide, lung carcinoma is one of the leading causes of cancer related death in both men and women. 1 Compared with the other subtype (small cell lung cancer), non small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents 75% to 80% of all lung neoplasms. The majority of these patients present with advanced, unresected, or metastatic disease, and approximately 15% of unselected patients are expected to be active for five years. 1 Thus the chemotherapeutic benefits in developing new anti-lung cancer drugs and the prognosis for advanced NSCLC has become an important and insistent issue. 2 Cell-cycle is a critical regulator for cell growth and cell proliferation following DNA damage: for proper functioning of cell-cycle machinery; cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), has to be positively regulated by cyclins and negatively regulated by cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors. It is well known that the drugs which target cyclin dependent kinase can be used as a better anticancer agent. Now a days naturally occurring substances are recognized as antioxidants, cancer-preventive agents, or even as cancer therapy drugs, such as taxol 2 or flavopiridol, [3] [4] [5] [6] and UCN-01 (7-hydroxytaurosporine). [7] [8] [9] Those bioactive substances exert their anticancer activity by blocking cell-cycle progression and triggering tumor cell apoptosis. Similarly, substances inducing G1 phase arrest are considered a potential candidate to treat developing cancer slowly. 10 However, chemotherapy does not substantially improvise the survival of the lung cancer patients, and it is clear that chemotherapy has reached a plateau of activity in treating NSCLC. 11 Toona sinesis (TS) a traditional Chinese herb leaf extract possess anti-proliferative properties against human lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549), 12 ovarian cancer cells (SKOV3), 13 and human premyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60). 14 In a recent report, it was found that TS-1 (leaf extract fraction) could inhibit H441 cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. 15 To support the former data in the present study, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of TSL-1 action against human cancer cells was examined using in vitro and in vivo models. Our results indicate that inhibition of cell-cycle progression and induction of apoptotic cell death contributes to the antiproliferative effects of TSL-1 in NSCLC cells.",

These apoptotic features observed in the TSL-1 treated cells include brown-stained fragmented nuclei, irregular-shaped cells, and irregular cytoplasmic membranes. In addition, the percentage of Annexin V-positive cells, which is indicative of early apoptosis, increased from 4.2% in the control to 12.9% in TSL-1-treated H441 cells; similarly, an increase of apoptosis from 0.2% in the H520 and H661 control cells to 14.9% to 23.2% of TSL-1-treated cells was observed. More-over, TSL-1 treatment increased the percentage of cells positive for both Annexin V and propidium iodide (hallmarks of late apoptosis) from 0.2% in the controls to 0.2%, 3.2%, and 8.3% in H441, H520, and H661 cells, respectively (Fig 4, C) . A Western blot analysis was performed to evaluate the activation of PARP downstream of the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway.

A variety of phytochemical components has been isolated and characterized from TS leaves, including gallic acid, methyl gallic acid, 3-O-b-D-(60-Ogalloyl)-glucopyranoside, 4-O-b-D-(60-Ogalloyl)-glucopyranoside, methyl gallate, ethyl gallate, kaempferol, kaempferol-3-O-b-glucoside, quercitrin, quercetin-3-Ob-glucoside, rutin and catechin; furthermore, polyphenols, limonoids, and methyl gallate found to have antioxidant activities to inhibit lipid peroxidation. 19 Gallic acid, which is 1 of the major compounds found in TSL-1, has anti-inflammatory, antimutagenic, and anticarcinogenic effects, and it has been found to induce apoptosis in cancer cells through antioxidation.

This result could be caused by the different cell line characteristics. To test the underlying mechanism of cell growth inhibition by TSL-1 treatment in relation to cell-cycle change, we performed a cell-cycle analysis in TSL-1-treated cells with a 0.5-mg dose of TSL-1 induced subG1/G1 phase arrest in all 3 cell lines. Therefore, the subG1/G1 phase arrest of the cell cycle can be considered as a pathway to suppress the growth of NSCLC cells. A similar phenomenon of sub G1 phase arrest has been demonstrated in TSL-1-treated H441 cells. 15 From this result, it is evident that the specificity of cell-cycle arrest by TSL-1 depends ) of TSL-1 via PO; group 2 mice were treated with a high dose (5 g/kg Bwt) of TSL-1 via PO; and group 3 mice were treated with a high dose (50 mg/kg Bwt) of of TSL-1 intraperitoneally.

CDKs and cyclins are major molecules required for proper cell-cycle events. 25 Each cyclin/CDK complex phosphorylates a unique set of substrates required for continued cell-cycle progression. 26 Among the CDKs that regulate the cell cycle, CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6 are activated in association with D-type cyclins or cyclin E during the progression of G1 and the G1-S transition. We found that the expressions of these CDK4 were decreased significantly in H661 compared with the other 2 cell lines. The overexpression of cyclin D1 has been found in various types of cancer, including lung cancer, hepatoma, breast cancer, uric bladder cancer, and esophageal cancer. 27 The increased expression of cyclin D1 plays a critical role in tumor development and maintenance of malignant phenotype. 28 Patients with cyclin D1-positive tumors had shorter survival than those with cyclin D1-negative tumors (5-year survival rates at 48% and 74%, respectively). 29 The treatment of NSCLC cells with TSL-1 resulted in the downregulation of cyclin D1 and CDK4 in a dosedependent manner by increasing the expression of cyclin-dependent inhibitor p27, which was consistent with the cell-cycle analysis.",

In fact, the presence of cleaved PARP is one of the most utilized diagnostics for the detection of apoptosis in many cell types. 32 In particular, the 24-kDa fragment, which contains the DNA binding domain, may facilitate the apoptotic process by blocking the access of DNA repair enzymes to the fragmented chromatin. 33 TSL-1-treated H441, H661, and H520 cells showed the induction of a cleaved 24-and 85-kDa DNA fragment, in addition to PARP cleavage; a down stream of mitochondrial mediated apoptosis pathway, we also observed that TSL-1 treatment in all the 3 cell lines decreased its Bcl-2 protein expression there by increasing Bax protein levels. Similarly, Yang et al reported TSL-1 induced Bcl-2 dependent mitochondrial pathway in H441 treated cells. 15 To confirm the inhibitory effect of TSL-1 against NSCLC, we induced H441, H661 and H520 cells by subcutaneous injection in athymic nude mice.
