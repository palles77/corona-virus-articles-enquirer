In this study, (+)-catechin was evaluated for its antiviral effect against TGEV in vitro. Viability assays revealed that (+)-catechin treatment exerted a dose-dependent rescue effect in TGEV-infected ST cells, and this result was only obtained with the post-treatment application of (+)-catechin. The viral yields in (+)-catechin-treated cultures were reduced by almost three log 10 units. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of the TGEV genome revealed that TGEV RNA replication was restricted after (+)catechin treatment. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection showed that (+)-catechin alleviated ROS conditions induced by TGEV infection. Our results showed that (+)-catechin exerts an inhibitory effect on TGEV proliferation in vitro and is involved its antioxidation.",

At present, TGE continues to be considered internationally as a highly contagious disease in swine, which results in a mortality rate close to 100% in newborn piglets (Cavanagh, 1996; Sola et al., 1998) . A common vaccine likely cannot induce a local immune response in the small intestine and provide solid protection to piglets (Tuboly et al., 2000) . Therefore, the development of effective anti-TGEV agents for controlling TGEV infection remains an important goal.",

            "text": "Green tea is derived from the dried leaves of Camellia sinensis and is one of the most commonly consumed beverages around the world (Ning et al., 2011; Pengbo et al., 2010) . Approximately 70% of green tea extracts is catechins (monomeric flavonoids) (Sang et al., 2011) . (+)-Catechin is one of the catechins in green tea. Many studies have shown that the catechins of green tea possess multiple pharmacological activities (Chang et al., 2003; Friedman, 2007; Song et al., 2005) . Previous antiviral studies have indicated that catechins exert inhibitory effects on different types of viruses in different ways (Friedman, 2007) . Typically, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a subclass of catechins, can efficiently inhibit the entry of hepatitis B virus (HBV) into immortalized human primary hepatocytes by inducing clathrin-dependent endocytosis (Huang et al., 2014) . The antiviral effect of EGCG on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has been shown for several steps in the HIV-1 life cycle, including a destructive effect on viral particles, postadsorption entry and reverse transcription in acutely infected monocytoid cells (Yamaguchi et al., 2002) . The antioxidant and antiinflammatory activities of (+)-catechin have been previously observed in several studies (Bragan\u00e7a de Moraes et al., 2014) . However, the impact of (+)-catechin on viral infections has not been previously investigated in detail.",

As shown by our results, (+)-catechin can protect ST cells from TGEV-induced CPE and greatly alleviated the ROS induced by TGEV. In conjunction with the improved intracellular ROS conditions, TGEV RNA replication and the viral titre in the supernatant were clearly down regulated. Hence, the antioxidative activity of (+)-catechin is a key factor in cytoprotection and antiviral activity.In summary, we demonstrated that (+)-catechin can inhibit TGEV replication in ST cells and that this antiviral activity is related to its antioxidation. This study provides novel findings concerning the antiviral effect of (+)-catechin.",
