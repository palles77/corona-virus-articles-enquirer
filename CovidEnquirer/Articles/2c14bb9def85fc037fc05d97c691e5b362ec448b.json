Based on its electron microscopic appearance, the agent (isolate CV777) has been proposed as a member of the Coronaviridae family (Pensaert and Debouck, 1978) . To date, infections by this agent have been diagnosed by the demonstration of the virus in intestinal epithelium using immunofluorescence (IF) on gut sections and in feces using electron microscopy (EM) (Debouck et al., 1981b) . Antibodies to CV777 have been demonstrated by indirect IF staining and by immunoelectron microscopy . All these methods are rather cumbersome and time consuming for large scale diagnostic and serological purposes. The epizootiology of CVLA has, therefore, not been examined in detail.",

The same anti-CV777 globulin preparation, diluted 1/500, was used to coat the plates. Antigen for all assays was the standard CV777 preparation, diluted 1/20 in PBS supplemented with 2.5% fetal bovine serum and 0.05% Tween 80; this amount of antigen represented 16 E.U. Test sera were serially diluted in twofold series, starting from a 1/5 dilution, in PBS containing 0.5 M NaC1, 0.05% Tween 80 and 5% porcine negative control serum, and were added to the plates to which antigen had been bound. Diluent alone served as a control. The plates were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and thereafter overnight at 4\u00b0C before the conjugate was added. The anti-CV777 antibody, used for the preparation of this conjugate, was obtained from a pig other than that which provided the coating antibody in order to decrease the chance for aspecific reactions. The optimal dilution was 1/600 in test serum diluent. The amount of conjugate bound to each well was determined as above. A given dilution of test serum was considered to be positive if it reduced the absorbance by at least 50% when compared with the buffer control. Titers are expressed as the reciprocal of the highest positive dilution.",

The specificity of the test was proven by the results on control material containing other viruses. Further evidence of the specificity is obtained by the correlation of the ELISA results with the clinical data: virus shedding is detected with high consistency during the acute phase of disease, but much less consistently during the incubation period and during the recovery phase. The ELISA results on samples collected during the latter two periods appear to depend upon the type of material tested. All samples of intestinal contents collected the first and second day after inoculation were positive, whereas all fecal samples collected 1 day after inoculation were negative. During the phase of recovery on the contrary, some fecal samples were positive, while all intestinal samples were negative. It is likely that this is a reflection of the time delay between the production and release of virus progeny in the intestine and its excretion in the feces. However, as only a small number of specimens have been tested, more extensive examination is needed to corroborate the present findings. The sensitivity of ELISA compares favourably to that of EM. More fecal and intestinal specimens from experimentally infected pigs were positive by ELISA than by EM. ELISA is more reliable than EM as shown by the finding that during the acute phase of diarrhea, virus excretion could be demonstrated in the feces of all experimentally infected piglets by ELISA but not by EM. The finding that viral antigen is still occasionally detected by ELISA in feces towards the end of diarrhea, but not by EM, further substantiates the previous statement. For use as a diagnostic tool ELISA is to be preferred above EM because it is a specific test for CVLA, whereas EM would have to be followed by a confirmatory test such as IEM (Debouck et al., 1981b) .",

The finding that in sera of experimental piglets and of naturally infected pigs of all ages, antibodies to CV777 were only detectable by ELISA at 6 weeks after the onset of diarrhea, may be caused by a low sensitivity of the ELISA blocking assay or by a weak immunogenicity of CVLA antigen.
