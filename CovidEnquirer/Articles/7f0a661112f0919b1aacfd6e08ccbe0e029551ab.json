            "text": "Von Ebner's glands of the rat are minor salivary serous glands in the posterior portion of the tongue. They secrete two digestive enzymes, lingual lipase and amylase. In this investigation, circadian rhythm in feeding was established under a normal 12 h light/12 h dark cycle, with the rats eating primarily during the dark period. At lights on, the size of the acinar cells and the area of the inclusive secretory granules, and the amount of digestive enzyme activity (lingual lipase and amylase) remaining in the gland was signi\u00aecantly less than in the mid-afternoon, after very little daylight food consumption. However, after 7 days of continuous light the circadian rhythm was altered: the food consumption during the normal night-time hours (5 p.m. to 8 a.m.) went from 88% of total 24 h food consumption to 45%, and during normal daylight hours (8 a.m. to 5 p.m.) from 12% to 55%. These changes were correlated with histometric \u00aendings of a near reversal of the areas of acinar cells and secretory granules of a.m. and p.m. samples under continuous light. Lingual lipase activity in the glands went from 35% under 12 h light to 61% under continuous light in the a.m. and from 65% to 39% in the p.m. Amylase activity also showed nearly a reversal in activity remaining in the gland, from 36% at 12 h light to 58% at 24 h light in the a.m. and 64% to 41% for the p.m. samples. These results indicate that the von Ebner's glands of the rat have a circadian rhythm of secretion and storage of secretory proteins that is subject to light entrainment similar to that seen in other exocrine glands such as the parotid and pancreas.

Sreebny and Johnson (1969) were the \u00aerst to show that there is a diurnal variation in the secretion and storage of secretory proteins in the parotid gland of the rat. Rats are nocturnal animals that feed mostly during the night and rest during the daylight hours. The exocrine glands discharge the contents of secretory granules during feeding and there is a substantial decrease in the glandular stores of secretory proteins by the end of the night. The partial depletion of these proteins triggers an increase in the rate of synthesis. During the day, when the secretory protein content has been restored, the rate of synthesis decreases (Sreebny et al., 1971) . Morphological studies of acinar cells of rat parotid glands revealed time-dependent changes in the structures of acinar cells (Albegger et al., 1975 (Albegger et al., , 1977 . The maximum volume of the cells and the secretory granules occurs in the evening at the start of the eating cycle and the minimum volume is seen in the morning.",

            "text": "von Ebner's glands, also known as lingual serous glands, are exocrine glands in the oral cavity. They are minor salivary glands embedded in the muscle tissue of the tongue beneath the vallate papillae and foliate furrows (Hand, 1970; Hand et al., 1999) . These glands secrete two digestive enzymes, lingual lipase and lingual amylase. Lingual lipase digests triacylglycerols at the acid pH of the stomach, producing diacyl-and monoacylglycerols and fatty acids. This preduodenal fat digestion is especially important when there is pancreatic insuciency, as in the premature and neonatal animal, or in disease states such as cystic \u00aebrosis (Field and Scow, 1983; Field and Hand, 1987; Field et al., 1989) . von Ebner's glands dier from other minor salivary glands in that they are not muco-or mucoserous glands but serous glands in most species (Hand et al., 1999; see Nalavade and Varute, 1972 for exceptions). In addition, regulation of protein secretion from these glands is similar to the pancreas and dierent from the parotid gland. Major protein secretion in von Ebner's glands (Field and Hand, 1987) and the pancreas (Peikin et al., 1979) is stimulated by cholinergic agonists, whereas in the parotid gland proteins are secreted after b-adrenergic stimulation (Johnson and Sreebny, 1973; Garrett and Thulin, 1975) . To our knowledge there have been no reports on circadian rhythm in von Ebner's glands.",

In brief, one slide from each of two blocks from each gland area (vallate and foliate) of each animal was selected for analysis based on technical quality. Technical considerations in the selection of slides included the presence of a sucient number of acini in the section, clarity of staining, and the absence of artefactual scattering of the secretory granules due to proximity to razor cuts. These selected slides were randomized and coded by a laboratory technician in order to ensure that all measurements were made blind. Areas of entire acinar cells and portions of these cells occupied by secretory granules were measured and tallied using Jandel's software SigmaScan by tracing the camera lucida images on a digitizing pad. The digitizing pad was calibrated to mm 2 . Ten acinar cells were measured on each slide. Only cells that both bordered a lumen and contained a nucleus were used. The average of the 20 cells (two slides per animal per gland area) so measured was the value used for comparisons.",

These experiments show that changes in circadian (24-h periodicity) rhythm are entrained by light in rat von Ebner's gland. Continuous lighting aects the time of food consumption, and the discharge of the secretory granules con- taining enzyme activity of two digestive enzymes, lingual lipase and amylase. These events were observed by assays of enzyme activity remaining in the gland at 8 a.m. or 3 p.m. and changes in the morphology of von Ebner's gland at these times, under exposure to either light/dark or continuous-light conditions. Under normal light conditions, rats eat in the dark and discharge their exocrine-gland secretory granules containing digestive enzymes during the eating period. The experiments described here con\u00aerm that this occurs in von Ebner's glands. These events have been seen in other exocrine glands such as the parotid (Sreebny and Johnson, 1969; Sreebny et al., 1971; Albegger et al., 1975 Albegger et al., , 1977 and the pancreas (Mu\u00c8 ller and Gerber, 1985; Maouyo et al., 1993) . When the light was on 12 h and o 12 h, the rats consumed most of their food during the dark hours (Table 1) . The acinar cells were smaller and the secretory granules occupied less space in the cells when the rats were killed at 8 a.m. than when they were killed at 3 p.m. At 3 p.m., the secretory granules have been restored due to protein synthesis and storage so that they will be ready to be released when needed during the dark feeding time.",

However, we cannot determine from our experiments exactly what phase changes in circadian rhythm actually occurred in the 7 days of continuous illumination. Siegel (1961) observed that with a normal light/dark cycle and ad libitum food and water intake, the maximum feeding of rats was during the dark hours. Under continuous light, this pattern was gone in 6 days, with more feeding during the usual daylight hours and less during the normal nightime hours. They also observed a return to the original feeding pattern by day 6 when the lighting conditions were returned to light/dark. Mice raised in continuous light have a displaced circadian rhythm with periods between 25.0 and 25.6 h (Ascho, 1960) . In addition, Rosenwasser et al. (1979) , when measuring food consumption in rats under continuous illumination, found no dierence in the daily total amount of food consumed whether in light/dark or continuous light, but in continuous light the rhythm was attenuated from 24 h in light/dark to 24.25\u00b124.7 h. These \u00aendings are consistent with the observations described here.",

            "text": "We have shown that light entrainment aects the eating cycle of rats. However, we do not know whether light entrainment it aects enzyme synthesis and storage in von Ebner's gland per se or whether the morphological and enzyme changes we observed were a consequence of the changes in the eating cycle that was entrained by light. In a review article, Johnson (1992) has ennumerated many experiments that indicate that metabolic response to eating is not a response to circadian changes, but rather a response to feeding changes that are entrained by light. However, there has been some indication that some digestive enzyme secretion is independent of food consumption. In the rat exocrine pancreas, a minor cycle of secretion was found that was independent of food intake (Maouyo et al., 1993) . Further experiments are needed to determine whether signi\u00aecant changes in morphology and Recently, circadian rhythms have been studied from a genetic viewpoint to ascertain more about molecular control and entrainment (Dunlap, 1998) . Genes have been cloned that make protein components of the biochemical clock. Mutations in these genes have been shown to alter or even abolish circadian rhythms. Among these are per, tim and doubletime in Drosophila melanogaster (Young, 1998) , frq in Neurospora crassa, (Aronson et al., 1994) and Clock in mice (Vitaterna et al., 1994) . These studies will further clarify the genetic and biochemical factors that are involved in the pathway of light-entrained circadian rhythm.",
