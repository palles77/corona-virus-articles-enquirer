            "text": "Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are divided into multiple subtypes according to diversified viral surface antigens and two major pathotypes including high and low pathogenicity for chicken [1, 2] . Among these IAVs, all avian viruses with high pathogenicity belong to the H5/H7 subtype [3] , but a novel avian-original influenza virus emerged at the spring of 2013 and unfortunately lead to severe and fatal respiratory disease in humans [4] . This novel virus has a similar phylogenetic genome to a virus isolated from chicken found in a live poultry market [4] . H7N9 virus is one of the many reassortant viruses, which are primarily derived from the H7N3, H7N9, and H9N2 subtypes of IAVs [5\u22127] . Although H7N9 is pathogenically low in chickens [8] , human beings are much more susceptible to transmission, particularly at live poultry markets after intimate contact with H7N9infected chickens [4, 9] . H7N9 viruses are able to spread between mammalian hosts (ferrets) without losing virulence [10] , and genetic mutations of H7N9 virus confer the risk of human-to-human transmission [11\u221213] , as demonstrated in a few family clusters infected by this virus [14, 15] . There have been six seasonal epidemics since the first case emerged in 2013, and the epidemic resurgence of the virus since 2016 in mainland China, suggest that it has become more virulent [16, 17] . Therefore, defending against H7N9 induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) will be instrumental in curing H7N9 patients.",

Moreover, other extensive therapeutic interventions (such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT)) have been applied to patients with severe H7N9 infectious patients [20\u221222] . However, dealing with the antiviral resistance of H7N9 and secondary infection induced multiple organ dysfunction in patients is still a serious concern, and there is an exigent demand to explore an effective strategy against H7N9 infection in humans. The corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) garnered on global attention for causing infectious pneumonia in Wuhan, China [23\u221225] . The number of infected patients rose rapidly due to a lack of enough awareness, proximity of people, ease of mobility, and the humanto-human transmission ability of the virus [26\u221229] . Currently, there is no effective way to cure COVID-19. Because H7N9 and COVID-19 share similar complications (such as ARDS and lung failure) and corresponding multi-organ dysfunction with lung inflammatory lesions and structural damage [24, 30] . Hence, finding a breakthrough of treatment strategy for H7N9 infection in humans will be critical for treating COVID-19 especially ARDS-induced severe pneumonia, which is currently causing panic around the world.",

Both ventilation and diffusion dysfunction persisted in the period of the acute stage, and we evaluated the lung function between year 1 to 5 of the follow up. There was no difference in the functions of FEV1, forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC and FEF50% among the four patients during the following 5 years. Before MSC treatment, all patients showed ground-glass opacities and amalgamation at the onset of disease by chest radiography. We followed up on 4 patients with MSC treatment for 5 years, and we listed the following up data of one patient in our study. We found that radiologic changes included linear fibrosis, air bronchogram, bronchiectasia, isolated areas of pleural thickening, ground glass opacities, and hydrothorax after MSC transplantation. These changes were subsequently eliminated while they demonstrated pneumatocele and new nodes on CCT from 8\u221212 weeks (Fig. 2 and Fig. S1 in Appendix A). At 24 weeks and 1 year after MSC transplantation, all patients showed improvement on CCT. All patients were lived in or near Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, thus the SF-36 principle of these residents in Hangzhou was chosen for assessment of the patients with MSC transplantation. After following up for 2 years, we found that the scores for all elements of the SF-36 did not significantly differ (Table S1 in Appendix A). Therefore, all this data from following up with the patients indicated that MSC transplantation didn't influence the long-term survival quantity of patients.",

These patients rapidly developed severe pneumonia, moderate-tosevere ARDS, and septic shock due to other reasons. Gao et al. [36] demonstrated that the development of refractory hypoxemia is one of the major causes of death, while the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) may serve as the main lethal factor in the pathogenesis. According to our observation, most clinical symptoms were ameliorative from 1 to 12 months (data not shown) post standard therapy and combined therapy with MSC transplantation. The death rate of control group is 54.5%, however, the death rate of MSC group is 16.7%. No cases of pulmonary embolism occurred in any of the patients. This indicates that MSC therapy is a safe and effective treatment to rescue the severe lung disease induced by H7N9. There is also no evidence for MSC associated long-term adverse events in our study. Zheng et al. [39] recently concluded that 12 patients with moderate to severe ARDS developed no infusion toxicities or MSC-related serious adverse events.

As with the previously reported of ARDS patients [40] , patient conditions between 1\u22126 months after discharge were significantly better than those after 6\u221224 months. A research on the long-term prognosis of ARDS survivors showed a mildly restrictive type of lung function tests with a moderate decrease in CO diffusion after 3 months' administration [41] . Additionally, pulmonary function in H1N1 infected patient is discovered to be almost normal, except for reducing spreading role in respiratory ability [42] . In the 1-year follow-up, fibrosis and pulmonary/ pulmonary parenchymal dysfunction are very common clinical phenomena in H1N1-associated severe ARDS infection. Over time, the imaging proved the significant improvements in lung function and fibrosis, and this improvement was particularly evident in the first 6 months after discharge from hospital [43] . Additionally, at the 3 months follow up, ground-glass opacities had significant improved over 85% patients [44] . However, there is no further significant differences about the interstitial fibrosis and ground-glass opacities after 1 year's visits [42] . These characteristics are consistent with those of survivors suffering with H7N9 infection in the current clinical trial. In this investigation, it was found that when patients returned home, they not only lacked basic activity, but were usually isolated from their relatives and neighbors because people were afraid of being infected with H7N9 again. After all, hundreds of people died from H7N9 in 2013. These survivors have obviously lower HRQoL than those of normal population, and it maybe a result from the deficiencies of social function and mental health. Moreover, a meta-analysis indicated that ARDS survivors can improve the function of HRQoL during the initial 6 months after discharge from hospital [45] . These reports indicated that the quality life of ARDS survivors infected with IAVs is rather worse than people who have no history of IAVs infection. Thus, we recommend that people emphasize caring for creating social interactions with these patients after recovery.",

With only 17 patients using MSC, we cannot guarantee every step is perfect at our phase with only one time of the clinical trial. Secondly, we should express that this is not a routine clinical trial owing to the H7N9 outbreak and no other better choice to treat these patients with severe ARDS. Therefore, they didn't want to have further visits, and some patients refused to attend, and even some did not complete follow up. Thus we are still concerned the long-term safety of MSC administration for treating H7N9 induced ARDS despite the lack of side effects observed in this clinical trial. Moreover, although some patients may have a potential lung infection in H7N9 patients, most of them are receiving other drugs without further examination, and we can't obtain the ideal comparison of lung functional indicators between the MSC group and the control group. Finally, the limitations of a small sample size are difficult to obtain the huge clinical data. Therefore, it is hard to conduct clinical studies in critically patients suffering with ARDS.",

Although MSC has shown great promise in the treatment of some immunological diseases (especially GVHD), the variabilities of MSC quality from different donors and tissues are widely varies, and treatment protocols, doses and injection modes are inconsistent during experimental procedures [53] .

Although our group has reported some clinical studies in H7N9 infected patients [6, 12, 15, 36] , understanding the detailed mechanism is still needed to reveal the potential for treating H7N9 induced ARDS. Along with our previous work [19, 54, 55] , MSC has the ability to improve lung function through anti-inflammatory effects in acute injury lung in a mouse model. Thus, the underlying mechanism is probably that MSCs reduce the secretion of inflammatory factors. Although the clinical research of MSCs are still in its infancy, we are optimistic that MSCs (including different sources) will be a promising tool for future clinical application.",
