Within the family Rhabdoviridae six genera have been established: Lyssavirus (rabies virus and related viruses), Vesiculovirus (vesicular stomatitis viruses and related viruses), Ephemerovirus (bovine ephemeral fever virus and related viruses), Novirhabdovirus (infectious hematopoietic necrosis and related viruses of aquatic vertebrates), Cytorhabdovirus (lettuce necrotic yellows and related viruses of plants), and Nucleorhabdovirus (potato yellow dwarf virus and related viruses of plants). Interestingly, as of yet there is no genetic evidence for a virus that constitutes a putative evolutionary link between plant and animal rhabdoviruses, or between lyssaviruses and viruses of any other genus of rhabdoviruses. However, comparative relationships between viral phylogeny and taxonomy remain incomplete, with numerous representatives awaiting further genetic characterization. Indeed the evolutionary pathways of viruses of particular genera may remain nearly impossible to recover. 1 One may begin to think of rabies virus as an extremely distant relative of eggplant mottled dwarf virus! Within the past five decades, a few viruses have been shown to be related antigenically to each other and to what is known as \"classical\" rabies virus. Shope summarized these and several unpublished findings in a paper entitled \"Rabies-related viruses\", 2 in which he laid out the previously unrecognized relationships between these viruses. At the time, Shope was Director of the Yale Arbovirus Research Unit, which housed the World Health Organization (WHO) World Centre for Arbovirus Reference and Research. Hundreds of viruses collected by arbovirologists and others around the world were sent there for identification, mainly using serologic testing of viral antigens and antibodies to them. This paper briefly describes rabies virus and its relatives, compares their relationships with each other, and discusses their possible medical, epidemiologic and evolutionary significances. Details regarding the general characteristics of these viruses have been published 3 and will not be repeated in detail here so that the important biological characteristics and critical specific molecular properties of the viruses can be emphasized.",

A virus cannot be related to a disease, only to a virus causing the disease. Therefore, we will use here the term \"rabies virus-related virus\" when making general mention of any lyssavirus other than rabies virus. The phrase is a bit awkward but it is better to be awkward and correct than to be graceful and incorrect. Second, with few non-standard exceptions, the names of all viruses end with the word \"virus\". Rabies virologists have not always held to this standard, which has resulted in \"European bat lyssavirus 1\", \"European bat lyssavirus 2\" and \"Australian bat lyssavirus\". Were the word \"virus\" to be tacked onto the ends of these names we would have \"European bat lyssavirus 1 virus\", \"European bat lyssavirus 2 virus\" and \"Australian bat lyssavirus virus\", which is nonsense, so we are leaving them as is, incorrect or not. The name Australian bat lyssavirus was given to this virus because the Australian Government did not want to agree to use of terms indicating that a virus endemic to Australia causes rabies, which would have threatened its \"rabies-free\" status\".",

            "text": "Rabies is a disease, rabies virus is one of many etiologic agents of that disease, an acute, progressive, fatal encephalomyelitis caused by neurotropic lyssaviruses. This might seem obvious to some but in many book chapters, papers and certainly in oral presentations, cause and effect are confused. Here we define the differences between the disease and the viruses that can cause that disease. All lyssaviruses share certain characteristics, including a negative-sense single-stranded RNA genome about 12 kb long, common genome organization, antigenic properties, virion morphology (bullet-shaped, 60e110 \u00c2 130e250 nm in size), two structural units (an internal helical nucleocapsid, about 50 nm in diameter, and a lipid envelope which is derived from the host cytoplasmic membrane during budding), as well as physicochemical and physical properties, and so on. 3 The genome of lyssaviruses consists of five genes, each of which encodes a structural protein (N, P, M, G and L). The glycoprotein (G) is embedded in the viral envelope and plays a pivotal role in pathogenicity. The G protein has been extensively studied, and is the only viral antigen shown to induce virus-neutralizing antibody. 5 Genetic distances between lyssaviruses are significantly less than the distances between viruses in other rhabdovirus genera, a property which has been attributed to evolutionary constraints, possibly imposed by their unique pathobiology or by their requirement for unique vectorreservoirs. The rabies virus-related viruses are transmitted directly from virus-infected mammals to susceptible mammals by bites, scratches, saliva, or mucosal exposure. Arthropods do not appear to serve as vectors for biological transmission of lyssaviruses causing rabies, and let us hope they do not. Their rates of evolution are slower than those of most rhabdoviruses, providing opportunities for studies of this feature and for our further understanding not only of virus evolution in general but of the geographic distribution of lyssaviruses in particular.",

One example, a rabies virus isolate from a ground-dwelling vertebrate (human, raccoon, skunk, other) might clearly be shown to be the same as a rabies virus from Mexican free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) in the same area.

Lagos bat virus was the first rabies virusrelated virus (i.e., the second lyssavirus) to be identified but has not been shown to cause human illness.

One isolate was obtained in France from a fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) which had been displaying signs of aggression. The bat had been imported from Africa.

First, Lagos bat and Mokola viruses were shown to cross-react in complementfixation tests. Simultaneous collaborative studies with Frederick Murphy, a veterinary pathologist and expert electron microscopist then at CDC in Atlanta, had been intended to classify vertebrate rhabdoviruses. David Simpson, in England, had sent Lagos bat virus to Murphy, asking him to determine the morphology of that virus. Murphy related to Simpson and Shope that Lagos bat virus was a rhabdovirus and, because of similarities between that virus and rabies virus in regard to virus shape and location of intracytoplasmic inclusions, suggested that Shope determine whether it was antigenically related to rabies virus. It was, and an antigenic group was established to include these viruses. Independently, Dorothy Moore, also at the Ibadan laboratory, found that kotonkan virus was related to Mokola virus and kotonkan virus was subsequently shown to be morphologically similar to Obodhiang virus. 16 Mokola virus was later isolated from a dog and a cat in South Africa.

Ten Danish isolates from serotine bats reacted identically with a panel of monoclonal antibodies. By immunofluorescence, reaction with monoclonal antibodies, and histopathologic studies, these isolates were similar to the exclusively African Duvenhage virus and, only somewhat similar to classical rabies virus. The Danish isolates produced fatal infections in laboratory mice inoculated intracranially, as well as by footpad and oral routes. Domestic dogs and cats inoculated intracerebrally but not intramuscularly or intravenously with these viruses died within 10 days. The dogs inoculated intramuscularly or intravenously developed neutralizing antibodies to the virus and resisted challenge with a lethal dose of street rabies virus. Cats inoculated intramuscularly died of an illness compatible with rabies within 15 days. At necropsy, rabies viral antigens were detected in several organs, including brain and salivary glands. Subsequent reports from Europe indicated that rabies virus-like viruses were usually associated with serotine bats. Eventually (vide infra) this virus was named European bat lyssavirus 1 (EBLV-1). EBLV-1 has been divided into two lineages, EBLV-1a and EBLV-1b, based on phylogenetic analyses supported by geographic distribution. 25 ",

Both European bat lyssaviruses have been shown to be more closely related to Duvenhage virus of Africa than to classical rabies virus; however, it soon became apparent that they were not at all simply variants of the same virus. Using an expanded panel of monoclonal antibodies it was observed that the differences between them were considerable. Indeed, EBLV-1 is antigenically and genetically more closely related to Duvenhage virus than it is to EBLV-2. 26 EBLV-2 was isolated from a zoologist who died in Finland with what was diagnosed as rabies. 27 Similar viruses were isolated from pond bats (Myotis dasycneme) in The Netherlands. 28 Sequencing of the genomes of these viruses confirmed that at least two bat lyssaviruses circulated in Europe. The lyssavirus from serotine bats then was renamed European bat lyssavirus 1 and the newly recognized lyssavirus from Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentonii) was named European bat lyssavirus 2 (EBLV-2 29 ;). It is now recognized that EBLV-2 is widely distributed in European bats of the genus Myotis, exclusively pond bats and Daubenton's bats, and that EBLV-2 has been the etiologic agent of rare, geographically scattered but inevitably fatal human infections. Whereas EBLV-1 is not uncommonly detected in mainland European bats and is not found in the United Kingdom, EBLV-2 has been detected only in the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Finland and near the border between Switzerland and Germany. 30 The possibility that there are pathogenetic differences between EBLV-1 and EBLV-2 has been considered. EBLV-2 has been shown to be less virulent in animal models than has EBLV-1 and both are less virulent than is rabies virus. Unprovoked (depending on your definition of \"provoked\") biting has been associated with bats infected with EBLV-2, whereas apparently healthy bats in Spain have been shown to excrete EBLV-1. Thus, bats infected with one or both of these lyssaviruses might occur. As summarized by Calisher et al. 31 and others, bats having inapparent infections with any of many viruses may serve as convenient and cryptic reservoirs of pathogens of humans, livestock and other vertebrates. This field of research is attracting increasing attention.",

In addition, patients with acute flaccid paralysis or clinically diagnosed encephalitis should be asked, or their relatives and friends should be asked, whether they had been bitten by a bat.

Currently two distinct lineages are recognized as being maintained in insectivorous and frugivorous bats. 21 Two fatal human infections with Australian bat lyssavirus have been recorded. The first was in 1996, when a 39-year old animal handler who had been scratched and possibly bitten five weeks earlier by a yellow-bellied sheath-tailed bat (Saccolaimus flaviventris) died. The second, a 37-year old bat-carer who had been bitten by a flying fox 27 months previous to the onset of her illness in 1998 also died. 22 Vaccination against rabies virus is effective against infection with Australian bat lyssavirus and rabies vaccine will prevent clinical disease caused by this virus.",

Clearly, improved techniques and increased efforts by investigators in a few key laboratories have revealed the existence of additional lyssaviruses and we should expect that more will be discovered. Thus far, rabies virus-related viruses have been detected in bats of only a relatively few species, so we could reasonably expect that hundreds more rabies virus-related viruses could be found, were this to be a scientific priority. However, because of the expense of such studies, laws, non-legal decisions to protect bats and for other reasons, this is not being done and likely will not be done. Therefore, the only way that other rabies virus-related viruses will be discovered will be if informed physicians and biologists pay particular attention to patient reports and personal observations, obtain an accurate patient history, including asking questions regarding animal exposure, themselves be aware of the need for detailed diagnosis of rabiescompatible illnesses in humans and bats and the need to collect and retain germane samples.",

These authors also concluded that, by comparison, there is an almost negligible contribution to wildlife vectors in the total cases of rabies in at least that particular dog rabies-endemic area. Perhaps this is so, which would be a good thing, because dog rabies is much easier to control than is wildlife rabies. Nonetheless, people who die of wildlife rabies viruses do not suffer any less than those dying of rabies virus acquired from dogs.",

The literature contains numerous papers reporting smaller studies with this intent but publications of a rigorous study of vaccine efficacy in humans are missing because morality demands that. A paper by Hanlon et al. reported the effect of preexposure rabies vaccination using two laboratory hosts, Syrian hamsters and ferrets. 42 The hamsters were administered a commercial human or veterinary vaccine or an experimental vaccinia-rabies glycoprotein recombinant vaccine by the intramuscular route. Five weeks after vaccination, animals were challenged with Aravan, Khujand, Irkut or West Caucasian bat virus, or with a traditional rabies virus of dog/coyote origin. Previously vaccinated and unvaccinated ferrets also were challenged with the four new isolates. In addition, the combined effects of rabies immunoglobulin and vaccine after exposure of hamsters to each of the four isolates were investigated using commercially available human products or an experimental monoclonal antibody. Results showed reduced efficacy of pre-exposure vaccination with conventional rabies post-exposure prophylaxis against each of the four new bat viruses. In general, and interestingly, efficacy was inversely related to the genetic distance between the new isolates and traditional strains of rabies virus. For example, using West Caucasian bat virus, the most divergent of these lyssaviruses, no significant difference in mortality was found after either pre-exposure vaccination or conventional post-exposure prophylaxis, as compared with na\u00efve controls. The potential impact of these newly recognized on human and domestic animal health and the impact on populations of the presumed bat reservoir will require further field and laboratory investigations.",

            "text": "The classification of lyssaviruses has evolved over time. Initially lyssaviruses were subdivided into serotypes based on their assorted cross-reactivities in classical serologic assays. 2 However the introduction of monoclonal antibody techniques and later molecular typing provided a much improved level of resolution of this genus. Presently, lyssavirus species can be grouped into phylogroups based on sequence and phylogenetic analysis, each with unique genetic, immunogenic and pathogenic properties. 43 Within the lyssavirus genus, phylogroup I includes all lyssavirus species except Lagos bat virus, Shimoni bat virus, Mokola virus, and West Caucasian bat virus. 13, 36, 43 The phylogroup II viruses diverge more at the amino acid level on the glycoprotein gene (Fig. 1) . West Caucasian bat virus may represent a new phylogroup; however, only a single isolation of this virus has been reported, thus precluding official designation. 36 The operational term \"genotype\" has been used for lyssavirus classification since the time when molecular techniques replaced serotyping for classification purposes. Demarcation of genotypes has been based largely on genetic distances between members of the genus and on the bootstrap support of phylogenetic constructions. 44, 45 However, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) does not recognize operationally defined genotypes, and only recognizes viral species for taxonomy at this level. Comparison of all five concatenated lyssavirus genes has been shown to provide the most robust level of resolution thus far, with threshold for differentiation between 76.4% and 81.6% nucleotide sequence identity. 13, 46 Summary of the natural history of lyssaviruses and their capacity to cause rabies Rabies virus is well known to most as being transmitted between bats (virus maintenance) and from bats to other vertebrates, which acquire the virus and die, either before or after transmitting it to other individuals. Bats of many species have been shown to be involved in the natural cycle (bat-to-bat or bat-to-other vertebrate-to-other vertebrate, etc.) and in the dead-end road represented by a vertebrate which dies before transmitting the virus.",

Bats of many species are colonial in nature and spend a great deal of their time in close proximity to one another, either daily while resting, seasonally while in hibernation, when breeding, or in maternal colonies. No matter the reason for their close proximity, infected bats are able to transmit rabies virus to their cohorts and to their offspring, perhaps vertically, although whether the latter is an important means of virus maintenance is unknown. 50 The epidemiology of rabies virus appears simple (infected vertebrate-to uninfected vertebrate) but is complex. The virus can be transmitted directly from bats (virusinfected bat to uninfected human, equid, bovid, canid, raccoon, skunk, or other terrestrial vertebrate) but the terrestrial vertebrate that becomes infected may serve as a temporary (until it dies) source of virus which can then infect other terrestrial vertebrates, thus establishing a cycle not involving bats. It is instructive to recognize the correlation between rabies virus variants in terrestrial vertebrates and rabies virus variants in bats in the same area. Clearly, the rabies virus-infected bats above them somehow infect the terrestrial vertebrates below, whether by scratch or bite by the bat or by the terrestrial vertebrate eating a virus-infected bat.",

The standard diagnostic test consists of direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) testing of impressions made from fresh brain tissue (i.e., cerebellum, hippocampus and brain stem). When performed properly, no other laboratory test for the diagnosis of rabies is as simple, sensitive, specific, inexpensive and rapid as the DFA test performed on fresh brain tissue. 53 This allows the use of similar reagents for diagnosis by immunofluorescence and is the method of choice used by U.S. public health laboratories for routine diagnosis of rabies virus infection. 9 Figure 1 Phylogenetic analysis of characterized and putative lyssavirus isolates based on 524 amino acids of the glycoprotein gene. Sequences were aligned using Clustal W, and the tree was visualized using MEGA 5, bootstrap values are presented for key nodes. The differentiation into phylogroups according to lyssavirus biologic properties is labeled and silhouetted. Fresh brain tissue may not be routinely collected, obviating diagnosis by DFA. In such cases, application of experimental diagnostic techniques, including DFA on formalinfixed tissue, immunohistochemistry or polymerase chain reaction assay and sequencing are used.

Nonetheless, a quandary has arisen regarding observations that antigens of certain genetic members of the genus Ephemerovirus (bovine ephemeral fever virus and its close relatives), including Obodhiang virus, kotonkan virus and Puchong virus, all of which cause a bovine ephemeral feverlike disease in cattle, and Berrimah virus, Kimberley virus and Adelaide River virus, which are not known to cause disease, are detected by antibody to lyssaviruses and vice versa. Schmidt, at the U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit in Cairo, had isolated Obodhiang virus from Mansonia uniformis mosquitoes in Sudan, 15 Kemp, Lee, Moore, Shope, Causey and Murphy, at the Virus Research Laboratory of the University of Ibadan, isolated kotonkan virus from culicoids (midges) collected from cattle at the University farm 16 and Puchong virus was isolated from Mansonia uniformis mosquitoes collected in Selangor State, Malaysia, by unspecified workers. Adelaide River and Berrimah viruses each were isolated from bloods of apparently healthy bovids in the Northern territory of Australia, Kimberley virus was isolated from Culex annulirostris mosquitoes in the Northern Territory as well as from Culicoides brevitarsis and bovid blood in Queensland, Australia. It is not at all clear why certain ephemeroviruses share antigens with certain lyssaviruses but, according to Peter J. Walker, CSIRO Livestock Industries, Australian Animal Health Laboratory, Geelong, Victoria, Australia, a sequence of six to eight conserved amino acids can be recognized as a crossreactive epitope. Walker has shown that such sequences occur in Adelaide River virus N protein at sites homologous to rabies virus N sequences to which even commercial rabies virus monoclonal antibodies bind. The rhabdovirus N protein is relatively, if minimally, conserved in some regions, so it is not unlikely that such short peptides could be the source of this confusion. Nevertheless, it is clear that Obodhiang, kotonkan, Puchong, Berrimah, Kimberley and Adelaide River viruses are ephemeroviruses, not lyssaviruses, and therefore are not rabies virus-related viruses in the true sense of that term, notwithstanding the work of Shope 21 and Calisher et al. 54 Monoclonal antibodies for characterization of rabies viruses are useful in distinguishing rabies virus and its close relatives. Once a monoclonal antibody is raised against a particular virus, it can be used to probe related viruses to determine how specifically it binds. An antigenicity profile can be generated using a panel of monoclonal antibodies raised against different isolates. These studies have demonstrated that rabies virus is distinguishable from related lyssavirus genotypes and that rabies virus isolates from a given geographic area or those belonging to different species have unique reactivity patterns, both due to common epitopes within the viral ribonucleoprotein core and to the glycoprotein components of the virion. 55 Recently, molecular methods have been adopted as confirmatory assays or as alternative methods for cases in which diagnosis is required while the patient is alive. Once viral RNA has been extracted from a sample, there are a number of molecular protocols dedicated to RNA viral detection based on nested and real-time reverse transcription PCR 56 or nucleic acid sequence-based amplification. 57, 58 Positive results obtained using these methods should be confirmed by sequencing to avoid false positives, and is also critical for epidemiological surveillance through strain typing. Diagnosis of human rabies in patients with symptoms suggestive of rabies can be achieved with the following tests 1 : DFA test on skin punch biopsy from the back of the neck, 2 virus isolation from saliva, 3 virus neutralization assay with serum and cerebrospinal fluid for evidence of antibody to rabies virus and 4 reverse transcription PCR for rabies virus RNA. As the diagnosis of human rabies is a diagnosis of exclusion, all four tests are required to rule out an ante-mortem diagnosis of rabies.",

Increasingly, this is being done, but done for specific purposes. Investigators who are interested in a particular virus or group of viruses collect samples and test them specifically for that virus or those viruses. Not surprisingly, these have been quite successful and more than 100 viruses or viral nucleic acid sequences have been detected to date, with many more expected to be discovered. However, what is not being tested for is not being detected, so that much information is not being gathered, even though a considerable amount of field work has been done and so many potentially useful samples have been tested e a wasteful use of resources. Methods are needed to survey for nucleic acid sequences of multiple viruses; sample sharing would be helpful.",

Given the relatively short genetic distances between these viruses, it may be not only that they are closely related but that understanding the development of lyssaviruses might be fruitful. Have the rabies virus-related viruses developed from rabies virus itself or was rabies virus derived from a less pathogenic, less insidious progenitor? Highly pathogenic viruses find themselves at risk when they kill or disable their hosts, as do all parasites. Therefore, we might obtain clues as to the origin or rabies virus by having a greater understanding of lyssaviral evolution.",

Do diverse feeding patterns of bats lead to diverse exposures to viruses? Are there important differences in virus transmission between bats that colonize and bats that are more solitary in nature? Given the more than 1000 species and the remarkable and fascinating peculiarities of bats, it is likely that we have not scratched the surface of what is yet to be known and that many more viruses, including at least some of the lyssaviruses, will be recognized in the near future. 59 The full significance of these viruses for human and veterinary medicine has yet to be determined.",
