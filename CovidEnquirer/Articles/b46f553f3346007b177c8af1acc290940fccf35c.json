Methods: Data for the monthly incidence of TB from January 2004 to December 2015 were obtained from the National Scientific Data Sharing Platform for Population and Health (China). The Box-Jenkins method was applied to fit a seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model to forecast the incidence of TB over the subsequent six months. Results: During the study period of 144 months, 12,321,559 TB cases were reported in China, with an average monthly incidence of 6.4426 per 100,000 of the population. The monthly incidence of TB showed a clear 12-month cycle, and a seasonality with two peaks occurring in January and March and a trough in December. The best-fit model was SARIMA (1,0,0)(0,1,1) 12 , which demonstrated adequate information extraction (white noise test, p > 0.05). Based on the analysis, the incidence of TB from January to June 2016 were 6.6335, 4.7208, 5.8193, 5.5474, 5.2202 and 4.9156 per 100,000 of the population, respectively. Conclusions: According to the seasonal pattern of TB incidence in China, the SARIMA model was proposed as a useful tool for monitoring epidemics.",

Despite heroic efforts to combat this devastating disease, TB remains a major global health issue with a vast health burden due to the high incidence, medical expenses, drug resistance and co-infections. In 2015, it was estimated that there were 10.4 million new infections and 1.8 million deaths caused by TB worldwide [3, 4] . In China, owing to the lack of healthcare resources and absence of essential medical services, TB has spread widely with serious harmful effects on the health of the population [5] . In the 1990s, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended the Directly Observed Treatment Short course (DOTS) strategy comprising two key factors: directly observed treatments and short course chemotherapy.",

Overall, the highest incidence was reported in Xinjiang and Guizhou, while the lowest incidence was observed in Beijing, Tianjing, Hebei, Liaoning, Shandong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Yunnan and Ningxia . Fig. 2 summarizes the distribution of TB cases in terms of age groups and gender in China from 2004 to 2015. The pattern shows that a higher incidence of male cases compared with female cases in the different age groups. Furthermore, the highest incidence of TB cases was reported in the 20-24 years age group, which accounted for 10.21% (1,257,679 cases) over the study period. Of 12,321,559 TB cases, 8,563,602 (69.50%) were males and 3,757,957 (30.50%) were females, with a male: female ratio of 2.28:1. As shown in Fig. 3 , there was an obscure decline in the monthly distribution of TB incidence, with obvious seasonality. Apparently, the highest incidence peak appeared in January followed by smaller peak in March, which accounted for 10.04% (1,236,741 cases) and 9.96% (1,227,076 cases) of all reported cases, respectively.

The factors that contribute to a rise in the incidence of TB are complex and further research is required to clarify this issue.

In Iran, the peak TB incidence appeared in spring [26] . The peak incidence of TB is mainly caused by new disease spread and increased incidence of latent infections; therefore, studies of the peak seasonal incidence peak should take into account the delay in diagnosis [27] . A previous study showed that the median TB patient delay is 93 days (range 68-128 days) [28] . Missed the early diagnosis and variable incubation periods of TB, will not only lead to a longer infectious period and increased transmission rates, but will also limit the reliability of the TB surveillance system and the effects of an early warning system [19, 29] . Furthermore, it is important to note that the Spring Festival in China contributes to the increase in the incidence of TB in March by virtue of the increased travel around the Chinese lunar new year and population mobility [27, 30] .",
