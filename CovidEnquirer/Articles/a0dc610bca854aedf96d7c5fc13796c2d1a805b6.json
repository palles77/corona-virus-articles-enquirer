Virally encoded Coxsackievirus 3C protease (3C pro ) plays an essential role in viral proliferation. Here, benserazide was discovered as a novel inhibitor from a drug library screen targeting Coxsackievirus 3C pro using a FRET-based enzyme assay. Benserazide, whose chemical structure has no electrophilic functional groups, was characterized as a non-competitive inhibitor by enzyme kinetic studies. A molecular docking study with benserazide and its analogs indicated that a novel putative allosteric binding site was involved. Specifically, a 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzyl moiety was determined to be a key pharmacophore for the enzyme's inhibitory activity. We suggest that the putative allosteric binding site may be a novel target for future therapeutic strategies.",

The essential roles of this protease in virus replication have drawn attention as attractive targets for the development of antiviral therapeutic agents because effective therapeutic strategies for the prevention or treatment of diseases caused by CVB3 infection are not currently available [13, 14] . There are many picornavirus 3C protease and 3C like protease inhibitors developed by many research groups in the previous studies [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . Among them, a variety of CVB3 3C protease inhibitors have been recently reported from both the screening of compound libraries and the design of compounds based on the structure of the substrate acting at the active site [15] . Although numerous 3C protease inhibitors have been developed as therapeutic agents for CVB3 infections, no antiviral drugs have been approved to date for the treatment of CVB3 infections in humans [16] . For example, compound 1 (TG-0204998 in Ref. [17] ) is a peptidomimetic inhibitor (K i = 0.8 lM) interacting at the active site of CVB 3C pro , whose binding mode was determined by crystallization [17] . Compound 2 (43146 in Ref. [18] ) was discovered from random screening as a non-peptide multifunctional inhibitor (IC 50 = 5.4 lM) against CVB3 3C pro , EV71 3C pro and SARS-CoV 3CL pro [18] . Our group has reported peptidomimetic inhibitor 3 (9e in Ref. [6] ) (IC 50 = 130 nM), which is an AG7088 derivative with the lactam ring modified into a glutamine residue and the ethyl ester group modified into an isoquinoline moiety [6] . The a,b-unsaturated carbonyl compounds such as 1 and 3 are known to undergo electrophilic irreversible covalent interaction with the cysteine residue (Cys-147) at the active site ( Fig. 1) [2, 7, 19] .",

As shown in Fig. 2d , the partial inhibition from the condition of full inhibition with high concentration of inhibitors, Benserazide (4) (50-fold concentration of IC 50 value) suggested that the mode of enzyme inhibitory activity of benserazide displayed a reversible pattern, while and an irreversible inhibitor, compound 3 showed a typical irreversible pattern of enzyme inhibition.",

Among a few cavities that were detected using the eraser algorithm method available in commercial in silico software (Discovery Studio 3.5; Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA), the putative allosteric binding site most fitted to the size of Benserazide (4) was selected, which was positioned opposite the active site (Fig. 3a) and was composed of Arg13, Ser16, Asn50, Arg79, Glu81 and Arg84 residues (Fig. 3b) . The binding mode Benserazide (4) 4 and its derivatives in this binding pocket were investigated by a molecular docking study (Fig. 3cf ). It is speculated that (1) 2-, 3-and 4-hydroxyl groups of compound Benserazide (4) may interact by hydrogen bonding with the side chains of Arg79 and Glu81, the side chain of Asn50, and the carbonyl oxygen of the Ser16 back bone, respectively; (2) the carbonyl oxygen of Benserazide (4) may interact with the guanidine moiety of Arg84; and (3) the -OH, and -NH 2 groups of Benserazide (4) may also form hydrogen bonds with the guanidine moiety of Arg13 ( Fig. 3c ; CDOKER energy (Kcal\u00c1mol \u00c01 ): \u00c034.23). The binding mode of compound 8a, was very similar to that of Benserazide (4) (Fig. 3d ; CDOKER energy: \u00c031.95); the compound also exhibits an inhibitory effect (IC 50 = 2.72 lM) similar to that of Benserazide (4) . In the case of di-hydroxy benzyl (b-f), mono-hydroxy benzyl (g-i) and benzyl (j)-substituted compounds (8b-j, 9b-j), the enzyme inhibitory activity was completely lost, and the binding modes of those analogs (9e and 9l) suggest that decreased hydrogen bonding interactions ( Fig. 3e ; CDOKER energy: \u00c025.46 and Fig. 3f ; CDOKER energy: \u00c024.73) compared to those of compounds 4 or 8a (Fig. 3c and d) may have detrimental effects on the enzyme inhibitory activity. Therefore, the 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzyl moiety may be critically important for the binding to evoke the inhibition of enzyme catalysis.",

As shown in Fig. 4b , only one phenolic hydroxyl group of benserazide might be interacted with Lys303, which is interacted with the hydrazine moiety of carbiDOPA [ Fig. S1 ; in Supplementary Information ]. In addition, the serine moiety of benserazide was detected to form hydrogen bonding with Ser193 via water molecules as the carboxylate groups of carbiDOPA do the similar interaction. It seems that the important binding moieties of benserazide might be different in between CVB3 3C protease (Fig. 4a) and DOPA decarboxylase (Fig. 4b) , which are the tri-hydroxyl groups and serine group, respectively. Therefore, modifications of serine moiety of benserazide such as substitutions of the amine and hydroxyl groups or changing to non-polar groups, may provide selective inhibition of CVB3 3C protease to avoid potential side effects, which may be caused by the inhibition of decarboxylase enzymes.",

The mechanism of enzyme inhibition and the binding mode of Benserazide (4) and its derivatives were characterized by enzyme kinetics and in silico molecular docking studies. These studies demonstrate that Benserazide (4) is a non-competitive inhibitor that interacts with a putative allosteric binding site, and the 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzyl moiety of Benserazide (4) is the most important to the inhibitory action against CVB 3C pro .
