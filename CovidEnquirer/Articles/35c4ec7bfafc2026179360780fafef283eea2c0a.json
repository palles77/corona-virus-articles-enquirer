A shortage of respirators can be expected during a pandemic. The availability of surgical N95 FFRs can potentially be increased by incorporating FDA clearance requirements in the NIOSH respirator approval process. Methods: Fluid resistance of NIOSH-approved N95 FFRs, and FDA-cleared surgical N95 FFRs and surgical masks was tested using the ASTM F1862 method at 450 and 635 cm/sec velocities and compared with the results from a third-party independent laboratory. Blood penetration through different layers of filter media of masks were also analyzed visually. Results: Four N95 FFR models showed no test failures at both velocities. The penetration results obtained in the NIOSH laboratory were comparable to those from the third-party independent laboratory. The number of respirator samples failing the test increased with increasing test velocity.",

Because of these properties, surgical N95 FFRs are preferably used by health care personnel when protection from either fluids or aerosols, or both, may be needed. Currently, FDA clears only a small percentage of the total number of NIOSH-certified N95 FFR models under the Surgical N95 Respirators category. The use of surgical N95 FFRs in surgical and nonsurgical environments increases during outbreaks involving a known or suspected respiratory pathogen.

Resistance to synthetic blood penetration is tested at 3 different velocities; 450, 550, and 635 cm/sec, corresponding to the range of human blood pressures 80, 120, and 160 mm Hg, respectively.

Fluid resistance at low, medium, and high levels refers to the device passing the test at 450, 550, and 635 cm/ sec velocities, respectively. The level of fluid resistance is directly related to the test velocity. 14 Some models may pass the testing only at 450 cm/sec, whereas others may also pass at 550 cm/sec or even at 635 cm/sec.

Table 3 shows the blood penetration results for the total number of samples for all models tested in the study. The results for the NIOSH and TPI laboratory samples were combined, because only a limited number of samples were tested at each laboratory. Moreover, a similar trend in penetration was obtained between the 2 laboratories. Samples from 4 out of 6 models of NIOSH-approved N95 FFRs showed no penetration. Of the other 2 N95 FFR models, model A had penetration for 2 of 24 samples at 450 cm/sec and 7 of 25 samples at 635 cm/sec, indicating that model A may pass the resistance test at 450 cm/sec, but not at 635 cm/sec. Model D showed penetration for several samples at the lower velocity at 1 of the laboratories (see Table 2 ), but not at the other. Because of the contradictory results obtained at the lowest velocity, whether model D will meet the fluid resistance requirement is uncertain. Three surgical N95 FFR models were tested in the study, of which only model H had no failures at either velocity. All samples of model G passed the test at 450 cm/sec, whereas model I had 1 sample that failed the test at 450 cm/sec. Two SM models were tested and only 1 of 20 samples of both models failed at the lowest velocity. For this initial study, we did not test the full recommended sample size of 32, so it is not possible to say with 100% certainty whether the N95 FFR models with <3 failures would meet the FDA clearance requirements or not. However, because four of the models had no failures even at the highest velocity for the first 20-25 samples, it would seem likely that they would pass if testing had continued to the recommended sample size. Surgical N95 FFR models H and I were specifically included in this study because they appear to be identical to 2 non-FDA cleared N95 FFRs models (ie, C and E). Models C and I are both flat-folding respirators from the same manufacturer and visually appear to be identical except for color (1 is orange and the other is white). Similarly, E and H are identical in appearance, except for the labeling and packaging. As shown in Table 3 , both pairs exhibited similar fluid resistance properties.",

The percentage of samples that showed penetration was significantly (P \u00bc .043) higher at 635 cm/sec than at 450 cm/sec. Penetration for large numbers of samples at higher velocity can be expected because an increase in the test velocity is likely to increase the permeability of the masks for fluids, including synthetic blood. Other factors include the configuration of the different types of filter media used in the multilayer construction of the mask. In general, the hydrophobic filter media-containing models are less likely to show penetration because of their ability to retard the penetration of a hydrophilic challenging test agent. The presence of a hydrophobic filter media on the outer surface may provide a barrier to the entry of hydrophilic water-based synthetic blood. 17 The lack of penetration of the devices may be maintained when the outer surface is hydrophobic and dry. Penetration can be expected when the outer layer is wet.",

            "text": "To gain more information on synthetic blood resistance of the mask, penetration through the different layers of the masks were analyzed visually. All of the models block the initial spray, but differences were found in how the synthetic blood moved through the layers of the device. Figure 2 shows the blood penetration through different layers of respirator models. A representative N95 FFR sample of model C, 1 of the 4 N95 models that passed the resistance testing, was analyzed for blood penetration through the different layers. Blood color was seen on the outer and inner sides of the outer layer (model C, 1a and 1b, respectively) and middle layer (model C, 2c and 2d, respectively). There was no red color on the outer or inner side (model C, 3e and 3f, respectively) of the innermost layer of the mask demonstrating no blood penetration. Two N95 FFR models (A and D) failed the test as shown by the blood color on the inner side of the masks. Model A had 3 layers of filter media. The outer and inner side (model A, 1a and 1b) of the outermost layer showed a wide area of the synthetic blood color. The middle layer had a relatively smaller area with color on the outer surface (model A, 2c), which diminished on the inner side (model A, 2d), indicating very little blood penetration. Surprisingly, a larger area of blood color was seen on the outer surface of the innermost layer (model A, 3e and 3f), which increased along the crease line on the inner side (model A, 3f) exposed to the face. The result was consistent between the different samples of the same model. The results are supported by the design of the respirator with different layers of filter media. The outer layer was thin and hydrophobic and blood was able to penetrate at the velocities tested in the study. The dense middle hydrophobic layer can be separated into 2 layers, but is considered as a single layer for simplicity. Although the hydrophobic middle layer appears to decrease blood penetration dramatically as shown by the reduction in the area of blood color, it actually allowed the blood to pass through it. This can be seen by the appearance of a wide area of blood color on the innermost hydrophilic layer, because of its affinity toward the water-based synthetic blood.

The 2 hydrophobic layers were not sufficient to prevent blood penetration at the test velocities. The results indicate that the numbers of hydrophilic and hydrophobic filter media, packing density of the layers, and the arrangement of the layers on the outer or inner side of the mask may influence blood penetration. The penetration of synthetic blood through hydrophobic filter media layers raises a question on the interpretation of the test method. In the case of model A, the inner side of the middle hydrophobic layer showed only traces of blood color. However, blood penetration through the middle layer could be seen by the wide area of color on the outer and inner sides of the innermost hydrophilic layer. This indicates that the innermost layer should be made of a hydrophilic material to reveal penetration of synthetic blood. In the absence of a hydrophilic layer, the device may still allow blood penetration, but it may not be easily identified by the test method. The results indicate the need for the development of a more accurate test method that can identify blood penetration on the inner side of the mask with either a hydrophilic or hydrophobic layer.",

There are scenarios in which splashes/sprays occur outside of surgical procedures. For example, significant volumes of respiratory secretions from infected individuals are released at high velocity in the form of a sneeze or cough, which can spray or splash on a nearby individual wearing an SM or FFR. The possibility that some devices may allow the penetration of biologic fluids exists because of the wide variation in their construction. The design of many surgical N95 FFRs and N95 FFRs prevents the inner surface of the respirators from touching a user's face. On the other hand, some models with a flat-fold type respirator may touch the facial skin during breathing, indicating that nasal secretions can diffuse through the mask under high humidity conditions of the mask. One study tested human subjects wearing SMs to evaluate the physiologic, thermal, and subjective influence of an SM on the wearer. 18 Those authors 18 reported that 11% of subjects complained about the SM sticking to the face during inhalation. Further studies are needed to understand the diffusion of biologic fluids through filter media in SMs, surgical N95 respirators, and FFRs.",

FDA clears only a small percentage of NIOSHapproved N95 FFRs as surgical N95 respirators. The extensive use of surgical N95 FFRs in surgical and nonsurgical health care practices results in shortages during emergencies and pandemic events involving a respiratory pathogen. To address this issue, NIOSH could incorporate additional test requirements in 42 CFR Part 84 respirator approval process to parallel the protections in the FDA clearance of surgical N95 respirators. Current FDA clearance procedures 3 accept NIOSH respirator certification in lieu of filter efficiency performance and differential pressure. In theory, similar arrangements for streamlined approvals could be made if NIOSH began evaluating fluid resistance as part of its certification process. Our study showed 4 out of 6 N95 FFR models approved by NIOSH but not cleared by FDA likely also meet the fluid resistance requirement for surgical N95 FFR clearance. Even the 2 N95 FFR models that demonstrated lesser fluid resistance ability still had pass rates of 80% and 92% at the lowest velocity, insufficient to meet requirements of the standard, but suggestive of ability to provide some level of fluid resistance. A detailed analysis of the pros and cons of NIOSH incorporating fluid resistance requirements into 42 CFR Part 84 respirator approval and its influence on infection control policies and respirator shortages is outside of the scope of this article, but is needed.",
