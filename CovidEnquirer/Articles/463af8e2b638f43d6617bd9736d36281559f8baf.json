Huangqin in Chinese) in the gastrointestinal tract and the correlation between the metabolites and their respective pharmacological activities. Materials and methods: The water extract of the root of Scutellaria baicalensis (WESB) was incubated with simulated gastric and intestinal juices, and human fecal microflora for 24 h at 37 1C. The HPLC-DAD analysis was used to monitor the in vitro metabolic process and identify its metabolites by comparing their absorption spectrum and retention time with those of chemical references. The in vitro anticomplementary and antimicrobial activity was evaluated with hemolysis assay, agar disc-diffusion method and MIC value, respectively. Results: Main constituents of WESB remain unchanged during the incubation with simulated gastric juice (pH\u00bc 1.5) and intestinal juice (pH\u00bc6.8), whereas four flavones, baicalin, wogonoside, oroxyloside and norwogonoside were metabolized into their respective aglycons by human intestinal bacteria. All four metabolites were demonstrated to have higher anticomplementary and antimicrobial activity than those of WESB. The anticomplementary active metabolites were identified to be baicalein, oroxylin A and norwogonin, among them, norwogonin is the most active compound. Conclusion: The presence of intestinal bacteria is demonstrated to play an important role in the gastrointestinal metabolism of WESB, and the pharmacological effects of Scutellaria baicalensis may be dependent on the intestinal bacteria metabolism.",

The main active constituents of Huangqin are flavonoids, such as baicalin (baicalein-7-glucuronide), wogonoside (wogonin-7-glucuronide), baicalein, wogonin, oroxylin A and oroxyloside (oroxylin A-7glucuronide) (Fig. 1 ). Among these flavonoids, baicalin is regarded as the most important determinants of the quality of Huangqin (Yuan et al., 2011) . Due to its orally administered as decoctions in TCM, the metabolism of the constituents often occurs in the gastrointestinal tract caused by the low gastric pH conditions, as well as the presence of digestive enzymes or intestinal bacteria (Akao et al., 1994) . It was found that baicalin was initially hydrolyzed to baicalein prior to the absorption, while baicalein could be readily absorbed with a fast and extensive first pass metabolism (Akao et al., 2000; Lu et al., 2007) . Wogonoside was found to be metabolized to wogonin by human fecal microflora (Trinh et al., 2009 ). In addition, pharmacokinetic study of Huangqin-Tang Decoction indicated that the constituents of wogonoside and oroxyloside had double-site absorption kinetics in rats which may due to the enteric circulation and enterohepatic circulation after oral dosing (Zuo et al., 2003) . So far, there is no report on the metabolism of Huangqin in gastrointestinal tract. In addition, most studies on bioactivity of Huangqin were focused on antibacterial and anti-endotoxin activities but not anticomplementary activity.",

            "text": "In order to identify the effective substances of Huangqin by oral administration in human body, the metabolism in the gastrointestinal tract was investigated in vitro. Although no change was observed in artificial gastric or intestinal juice, the main constituents, baicalin, wogonoside and oroxyloside, were found to be metabolized into their respective aglycons by intestinal bacteria. These findings are consistent with the reports that monomeric compounds baicalin, wogonoside and oroxyloside could be converted to metabolites baicalein, wogonin and oroxylin A by intestinal bacteria, respectively (Akao et al., 2000; Trinh et al., 2009; Zuo et al., 2002) . The biotransformation of individual compound was the same as that in whole herb decoctions. Moreover, a low content norwogonoside was isolated and identified from Huangqin for the first time, and confirmed to be metabolized to norwogonin. Baicalein, wogonin and oroxylin A were detected in rat plasma and urine samples after oral administration of Gegen-Qinlian-Wan (GQW, including Huangqin) by UHPLC/DAD/ qTOF-MS, but not norwogonin which was present in our metabolic study in vitro (Miao et al., 2013) . It is probably due to the difference between human and rat or the low content in specimens. Nevertheless, both results suggest that flavonoid O-glycosides from Huangqin could be easily transformed into their aglycones. The human complement system plays an important role in the host defense foreign invasive organisms. Its effects are normally beneficial to the host (Min et al., 2003) , but over-activation of the system may lead to pathological reaction in a variety of inflammatory and degenerative diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, type I diabetes mellitus, systemic lupus erythematosus, SARS, vasculitis and many others (Valeriya et al., 2011) . Numerous naturally occurring agents have been reported to effectively block the complement activation, which provide the prospect of novel anticomplementary drugs in non-toxicity based on abundant herb resources. The best described anticomplementary agents are polysaccharides, flavones and triterpenes (Xu et al., 2007) . In the present study, WESB (1.25 mg/ml) showed no anticomplementary activity through the classical pathway or the alternative pathway, even though WESB was abundant in flavonoids. Our studies on main flavonoid glycosides from WESB, baicalin, norwogonoside, oroxyloside and wogonoside generated the similar results (Table 1) . However, their metabolites, especially norwogonin, showed obvious anticomplementary activity in inhibiting the classical pathway and the alternative pathway, suggesting a correction between 5,7-dihydroxyflavone and the anticomplementary effect. Specifically, the inhibitory potencies against complement system were enhanced by the number of free hydroxyls on A ring of 5,7-dihydroxyflavone (Xi et al., 2012) . This finding also agrees with the anticomplementary properties in some acylated flavonol glycosides obtained from Magnolia fargesii (Jung et al., 1998) and Persicaria lapathifolia (Park et al., 1999) . On the other hand, glycosylation on A ring of flavones might play an important role in its anticomplementary effect that most of the effect even disappeared (Yao et al., 2013) . These results were also coincident with the previous suggestion that the intestinal flora might regulate the metabolism of compounds administered orally or excreted into bile (Zuo et al., 2002) , and the herbal components should be transformed to bioactive compounds by the intestinal bacteria prior to their pharmacological actions (Lee et al., 2002a; Sousa et al., 2008) . Further study should be carried out to elucidate their anticomplementary activity in vivo.",

            "text": "Published literature strongly support that the antimicrobial activities of some plant extracts are likely to be due to their high flavonoid content (Cushnie and Lamb, 2005; Zhang et al., 2011) . In our studies, baicalin, baicalein, oroxylin A and norwogonin, four typical flavones possessed different degree of antimicrobial activities. A small number of research groups have investigated the relationship between structure and antibacterial activity of flavonoid to identify common structural features among active compounds. Tsuchiya 0 s study indicated that 5,7-dihydroxylation of the A ring in the flavone structure was important for anti-MRSA activity (Tsuchia et al., 1996) . It is consistent that baicalein, wogonin, oroxylin A and norwogonin, all featured such structures (shown in Fig. 1) , and display better effective antimicrobial properties than other compounds. Interestingly, a report by Stapleton demonstrated that substitution with C-8 chain also enhanced the antistaphylococcal activity of flavonoids (Stapleton et al., 2004) . Independently, our data also revealed that norwogonin, 5,7,8-trihydroxyflavone has the highest antibacterial activity. These results suggest that the overall antimicrobial effect of Huangqin may be dependent on its metabolism by intestinal bacteria. Moreover, gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeuroginosa have been inhibited to a less extent as compared to the gram-positive bacteria MRSA, MSSA, and Enterococcus faecalis as shown in Table 2 . This result is in agreement with that flavonoids of the plant origin appear to have greater activity against gram-positive than gram-negative bacteria (Ikigai et al., 1993) and could selectively inhibit gram-positive bacteria (Wyman and Van-Etten, 1978) . Further characterization of the interaction between these antimicrobial flavonoids and their target sites are needed, however.",

Norwogonin also exhibited potent inhibitory activity toward VHR (IC 50 \u00bc 1.1 \u03bcM), but had no inhibitory activity against T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase or serine/threonine protein phosphatase 1 (Lee et al., 2002b) . Norwogonin possessed significant antioxidant activity in AAPH (2,2 0 -azobis (2-amidinopropane hydrochloride)induced haemolysis (Liu et al., 2004) . In addition, it is reported that norwogonin was determined in test strains differing in excision-repair capability and in the presence or absence of plasmid pKM101 (MacGregor and Wilson, 1988) . Although some biological effects of norwogonin have been observed, the mechanism of action still remains unclear and requires further investigation.",
