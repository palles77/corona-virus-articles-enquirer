However, the functions of syntenin in the antibacterial response of invertebrates remain unclear. In this study, we identified a syntenin-like gene (MjSyn) from the kuruma shrimp (Marsupenaeus japonicus) and detected its function in the antibacterial immunity of shrimp. The full-length MjSyn was 1223 bp with a 963 bp open reading frame that encodes 320 amino acids. The deduced MjSyn proteins contained two atypical PDZ domains (sequence repeat that was first reported in the postsynaptic density protein or PSD-95, DlgA, and ZO-1 protein), an N-terminal domain, and a C-terminal domain. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR results showed that MjSyn was expressed in all tested tissues. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that MjSyn transcripts in the hemocyte, gill, and intestine were significantly induced at various time points after infection with Staphylococcus aureus and Vibrio anguillarum. The knockdown of the expression of MjSyn by RNA interference resulted in a significant decrease in the phagocytic ability and increased bacteria number in vivo of shrimp. Moreover, the expression of MjCnx, a cytoplasma and membrane location lectin chaperone protein, was inhibited in the MjSyn-knocked down shrimp, which indicated a possible calnexin-related way. Thus, the MjSyn participates in the bacterial clearance response of kuruma shrimp, thereby providing new insight into the function of this kind of important adaptor protein.",

The PDZ (previously known as Discs-Large homology repeats [DHRs] or GLGF repeats)-domain-containing protein is an important and well-known family of adaptor proteins. These proteins are abundant (more than 400 copies in the human genome) in metazoan genomes and have also been identified in bacteria, plants, and yeast [2] . The PDZ domain is an 80e100 amino acid sequence homolog that was named by the three proteins in which these domains have been identified: the brain synaptic protein PSD-95, the Drosophila septate junction protein Discs-Large, and the epithelial tight junction protein ZO1 [3e5]. Crystallographic and/or nuclear maginatic resonance (NMR) results show that the PDZ domains consist of six b-strands and two a-helices, which are folded into a compact globular with an extended groove between the b-strand B and a-helix B for peptide ligand binding [6e8] .",

The syntenin protein of shrimp showed remarkable sequence differences with those from vertebrates and other invertebrates, such as mosquito [29] and filarial [30] , except for the PDZ domains. The syntenin protein has four domains: an NTD, two PDZ domains, and a CTD. The PDZ domains of HsSyn have been well illustrated both in function and structure. Generally, they bind to the C-terminus of membrane-located target proteins and mediate the assembly of dynamic multi-protein complexes at the membrane. Although only 26% sequence identities in amino acids have been reported, the two PDZ domains of HsSyn have similar globular structures, which usually comprise six b-strands (b1-b6) and two a-helices (a1 and a2) [13] . The two PDZ domains of MjSyn showed relatively higher sequence identities with that of HsSyn. Although the predicted tertiary structure of MjSyn PDZ domains express reduced b-strands (b1eb5), the peptide binding surface of these domains are almost identical to those of human's, such as the positively charged residues in b2 and a2 of PDZ1 (Fig. 2) . These results indicated that a conserved peptide binding character probably exists in the shrimp. Compared with the PDZ domains, the functions of NTD and CTD are not well documented. Some functions of the NTD in HsSyn, such as the recruitment of the transcription factor SOX4 and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (EIF4A) into signaling complexes and interaction with Alix and ubiquitin, have been reported [31, 32] . However, the NTD of syntenins from various species have low sequence identities, except for some identified sequence motif (such as LYPSL motif and the tyrosine phosphorylation site) for specific peptide binding or regulation. In HsSyn, the LYPSL motif function in Alix binding and the tyrosine phosphorylation sites regulate the interaction of HsSyn with the receptor type protein tyrosine phosphates (Fig. 1) . Whether the NTD of MjSyn has the same binding function should be elucidated.",

To date, the regulation of mda-9/syntenin has not been extensively studied. It was only reported to be an interferoninducible gene [12] , which was induced by TNFa or fibronectin in mammals [35] . In aquatilia, the upregulation of the mRNA of syntenin homologs was reported in marine teleost olive flounder Paralichthys olivaceus by hypoxia and in shrimp P. monodon by WSSV infection [22, 36] . In our study, both the Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria induced significant upregulation of syntenin, which indicated a potential role of syntenin in the antibacterial response of shrimp. This function was then investigated by bacteria clearance assay and phagocytic activity following the RNAi. Knockdown of the expression of MjSyn in vivo of shrimp resulted in anguillarum was injected 24 h after RNAi assay. The hemocytes were collected and fixed. The percentage of phagocytosis was calculated according to the method in Section 2.8.

            "text": "In invertebrates, bacteria challenge stimulates innate immune responses, which include phagocytosis or encapsulation, prophenoloxidase cascade, and humoral response [37] . Phagocytosis is one of the most powerful and immediate ways to eliminate microbe infection and comprises a series of complex events and proteins [38] . In the present study, the transcripts of some phagocytosis-related proteins were detected after knockdown MjSyn. Unexpectedly, the expression of traditional phagocytosisrelated proteins (myosin, Ran, Arp2/3, and Rab5) was unaffected, contrary to the expression of calnexin (MjCnx), which was inhibited in the mRNA and protein levels. Calnexin is a lectin chaperone that is usually localized to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and comprises a dedicated maturation system known as Cnx/calreticulin (Crt) cycle with another lectin chaperone Crt [39] . However, although Calnexin was reported to be involved in the phagocytosis since year 2001, no further studies have been reported until this year. Zhang et al. showed that calnexin in M. japonicus (MjCnx) has a cytoplasma and membrane location in hemocytes, and it facilitates the phagocytosis efficiency of hemocytes to V. anguillarum by its binding ability to bacteria and carbohydrate [27] . In our study, knockdown of MjSyn decreased the phagocytosis ability of hemocytes to V. anguillarum and S. aureus as well as the expression of MjCnx, which indicates a tight relationship of two proteins. The MjCnx was supposed to be one of the pathogen recognition receptors located in the cytomembrane in shrimp. The most characteristic function of syntenin is its binding capacity to the cytosolic tail of various transmembrane receptors or cytoplasmic partners for signaling complexes assemble or signal transmission. At the same time, syntenin has been reported to be vital for the regulation of Factin polymerization in HIV entry and CXCR4-induced chemotaxis of T-cells [20, 40] . Actin polymerization is also an important step during phagocytosis. Thus, MjSyn may function in the phagocytosis anti-bacteria immunity of shrimp through two mechanisms: participate the MjCnx anti-bacteria response and (or) influence phagosome formation through regulate actin polymerization process. Further studies are needed to confirm these mechanisms.",
