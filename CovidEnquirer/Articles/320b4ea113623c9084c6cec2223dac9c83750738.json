The innate immune response mediated by phagocytic cells (neutrophils and macrophages) does not fully develop until late gestation, and there is decline in functional capacity as gestation approaches because of the increase in fetal cortisol levels [1] . Humoral elements, such as complement, are present; however, their levels are below those of adults. Interferon can be induced in a fetus as early as 60 days of gestation [2] . All of the cellular components of the acquired immune response are present in fetal calves [3] . The number of peripheral blood T cells dramatically decreases beginning 1 month before birth as they traffic and populate lymphoid tissues of fetal calves (decrease from approximately 60% to 30% at birth). B cells are present in much lower numbers in developing fetuses (1%-2%) than mature calves (10%-20%) [4, 5] . A hallmark of bovine fetuses is agammaglobulinemia [1] . They have almost no antibodies unless infected in utero; even then, they have relatively low levels compared with adults and it is comprised predominantly of IgM [1] .",

In the case of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) infection, fetuses infected with BVDV between 45 and 175 days of gestation can lead to immunologic tolerance, and the calves become persistently infected with BVDV. Persistently infected calves never mount a protective response to the this infection [6] . Fetal lymphocytes are responsive to mitogens by 188 to 253 days of gestation [7] . By 120 days, fetuses can develop antibodies to parainfluenza virus-3 and to BVDV by 190 days [8] . Although fetuses can respond immunologically to these pathogens, congenital infections with BVDV (eg, in the last half to one third of gestation) can result in negative health and reproductive consequences on young calves and heifers [9, 10] . These effects include a twofold increase in severe illness (diarrhea or pneumonia) in young calves [9] and up to a 1.5-month delay in the onset of estrus [10] . Because there is no accurate method for assessing immunologic or reproductive damage from congenital BVDV infections, one should exercise caution when considering retaining ''normal'' heifers born in a herd that exhibits clinical problems resulting from BVDV reproductive disease (ie, abortions, persistent infections, weak calves).",

Endogenous production of IgM in colostrum-deprived calves does not begin to appear in the circulation until 4 days after birth and does not reach functional levels (1 mg/mL) until 8 days of age. Levels of circulating IgA, IgG 1 , and IgG 2 do not reach appreciable levels in these calves until 16 to 32 days after birth [12] .

It is not clear if these cytokines are secreted in the mammary gland, produced by the leukocytes found in colostrum or both. Interleukin 1-beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-beta, and interferon-gamma are present in bovine colostrum and are associated with a proinflammatory response and may help in the recruitment of neonatal lymphocytes into the gut to aid in normal immune development. Colostrum rapidly improves the ability of neutrophils to phagocytize bacteria, which is primarily accomplished by absorption of small molecules such as cytokines [14] . Work in pigs has demonstrated that colostral cytokines are absorbed and can be detected in the blood [15] . The level of these cytokines (IL-4OIL-6Ointerferon-gammaOIL-10) peaked at 1 to 2 days postpartum. The high levels of two anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-4 and transforming growth factor beta-1, suppress local secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in the intestine and allow gut microbial colonization.",

Most lymphocytes are T lymphocytes, with less than 5% being B lymphocytes. Some of these maternal cells enter the circulation and reach peak levels 24 hours after birth [19] . Animals that receive colostrum that contains maternal leukocytes develop antigen-presenting cells faster [18] . This is important because antigen-presenting cells are the keystone cell for development of an acquired immune response to pathogens or vaccines. Pathogen-specific maternal T lymphocytes from vaccinated cows have been isolated from neonatal calves with maximum inducible proliferation at 1 day after birth [20] . The exact role of these cells in the long-term development of pathogen-specific acquired immunity is not clear because they are no longer detectable in the circulation at 7 days of age.",

Developing and newborn calves are subject to several immunomodulatory effects (Fig. 2) . The placenta produces progesterone, prostaglandin E2, and cytokines (eg, IL-4 and Il-10) that affect the near-term fetus and the dam and suppress cell-mediated and memory (TH1) responses. In contrast, these mediators promote TH2 responses and antibody production [25] . Cows also produce estrogen and cortisol before parturition that have immunosuppressive effects [26] . Finally, as part of the parturition process calves produce high levels of cortisol that remain elevated for the first week of life [27] . The cumulative effect of these hormones is to suppress immune responses and direct the immune response away from the TH1 response. These hormones also promote short-term TH2 immune responses, particularly production of IgM (Box 1).",

The cellular components of innate immunity are also affected: the number of neutrophils circulating in the newborn calf is approximately four times higher than in 3-week-old calves. Neonatal neutrophils and macrophages have reduced phagocytic ability, but their capacity is increased after the ingestion of colostrum [14] . By 1 week of age, neutrophils are functional and able to mount an effective response [4] . Neutrophil function gradually improves to adult levels by 5 months of age [29] . The number of dendritic cells is lower in neonates, and their ability to present antigen to activate the acquired immune system is limited [25] . Monocytes migrate to the tissues and develop into dendritic cells after proinflammatory stimulation.

This problem has been demonstrated with several pathogens, including rotavirus [31] , BVDV [32] , bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) [33, 34] , bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1) [35] , and Mannheimia (Pasturella) haemolytica [36] . The timing of many vaccines administrated by the parenteral route involves estimating when the level of maternal antibody is low enough for an active immune response to progress sufficiently to provide vaccine immunity (see Fig. 1 ). Most maternal antibody has a decay half-life of 16 to 28 days [37] . The prime window for vaccination can be anywhere from a few weeks to 8 months. As illustrated in Fig. 1 , this period can vary by animal and depends on the level of maternal antibody and the vaccine antigen, which presents a major challenge for vaccine development. Antibody levels often decay to a level still high enough to block responses to vaccine but not high enough to resist a field infection, which creates a window of opportunity for infecting organisms.",

Parenteral vaccination with either inactivated or MLV at 7 weeks of age in the presence of maternal antibodies resulted in a cellular response for the MLV group with no increase in antibody titers for either vaccine. Revaccination with either vaccine 4.5 months later resulted in an anamnestic response in antibody titers [39] , which indicated the importance of timing.

One of the most successful strategies against maternal antibody interference is the use of intranasal (IN) vaccines for BHV-1 [41, 42] , BRSV [36, 43] , and PI3 [41, 42, 44] in young calves. Additional experimental studies with IN BVDV in 2-to 5-week-old calves also provided protection against BVDV challenge [39, 45] . An experimental IN live Pasturella multicida vaccine also has been developed and has been shown to induce high levels of secretory antibody [42] . IN vaccines have the advantage of being able to replicate in the nasal mucosa and prime the mucosal immune system with little interference from secretory antibodies. The mucosal immunity primed by IN vaccines is also more likely to prevent infection rather than just reduce disease. Low or no systemic antibody titers often are detected after IN vaccination, which makes it difficult to assess immunity using serology [43] . Despite the lack of ''seroconversion,'' IN vaccines have generated protective immunity that lasts for months [34, 41, 45 ]. An additional advantage of IN vaccines is their ability to induce interferon to induce the antiviral state within 40 hours after administration. Induction of interferon in young calves also may aid in the development of a mature immune system.",

Finding any experimental studies that support this frequency is difficult. From other immune systems, it is clear that too frequent vaccination in young animals can lead to antigen-specific tolerance (ie, the lack of any immune response to the antigen) [53] , which is the result of suppressive T cells and the deletion of T and B clones specific for those antigens. Another possible adverse outcome of overvaccination is autoimmunity, whose development is based on priming against the animal's own antigens (self) or closely mimicking vaccine antigens to the animal's own antigens. An example of this mimicry is antibodies against one of the surface proteins of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) cross-reacting with a surface protein of the immune cells [54] . Stimulation of inflammatory mechanisms associated with vaccination (eg, adjuvants such as alum or microbial ligands) or repeated re-exposure to vaccine components that drive expansion of autoimmune B-and T-cell clones may occur with frequently repeated vaccine stimulation [55, 56] . In all animals after vaccination there is expansion in the populations of responding T-and B-cell clones (Fig. 3) . Requirements for good immune response are that this clonal expansion stops and that an active process of cell death (apoptosis) occurs (see Fig. 3 ). This ''waning process'' allows ''culling'' of T or B cells that may be poor responders or even cause autoimmunity to be removed by apoptosis [57] . This whole process from vaccination to achieving homeostasis takes at least 3 weeks for the development of a primary response, which can then be boosted to get a true anamnestic secondary response.",

The relationship is linear: the younger the calf, the poorer the response; the older the calf, the better the response. The inverse relationship is true from the standpoint of protection afforded by maternal immunity: the younger the calf, the better the protection because of high levels of maternal antibody; the older the calf, the more susceptible to disease because of waning maternal antibody.",

In dairy operations, isolation of calves from exposure to pathogens and good biosecurity can provide a window of enhanced protection by maternal immunity giving an extended window before vaccination is necessary. Some practices, such as feeding waste milk on dairies, may ''break'' the isolation by introducing pathogens and antibiotics that alter the natural flora developing in the calf to make them more susceptible. This may warrant a more aggressive vaccination program.",

It requires careful monitoring and frequent revaccination so that calves can be protected before they reach the ''window of susceptibility,'' the time frame in which animals are no longer protected by passive immunity and active immunity has not been stimulated. A promising development has been an IN BRSV vaccine that has been licensed in Europe [34] IN vaccination takes advantage of the poor penetration of antibody from colostrum onto mucosal surfaces providing less interference with the function of vaccines. This vaccine reduced clinical disease in 3-week-old colostrum-fed calves challenged 66 days after vaccination. Another study administered a commercial four-way viral MLV vaccine licensed for parenteral use, intranasally, in 2-week-old colostrum-fed calves and found it to be protective 8 days after vaccination [43] . A single dose of inactivated four-way viral vaccine in 4-to 5-week-old calves protected them against a BRSV challenge 3 weeks after vaccination [46] .",

The greatest risk for BVDV infection was from 4 to 9 months of age as animals were group housed in larger groups [62] . Vaccination programs that vaccinated calves in the first 60 days and then much later at 4 to 9 months were not effective in preventing infection [62] .

Maternal interference is less likely at mucosal sites in young animals, so most of them develop active immunity [41, 58] . After IN vaccination, high levels of mucosal and serum interferon are also produced [63] that direct an antiviral effect and may aid in the development of the neonatal immune response. BHV-1 is also immunosuppressive [64] . Because of their localized and limited replication in the nasal epithelium, however, IN BHV-1 vaccines are less of a danger for development of immunosuppression than parenteral vaccines. All BHV-1 vaccines, including IN vaccines [35] , can result in latency, which is the ability of the virus to reactivate (recrudesce) and be shed. The biologic relevance of this reactivation and shedding of BHV-1 is unclear because there are no lesions or disease syndromes associated with recrudescence, and the virus can only be reactivated experimentally after several days of treatment with high doses of dexamethasone [35] .",
