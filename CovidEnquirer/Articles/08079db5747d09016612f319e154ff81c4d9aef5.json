            "text": "Macrophage polarization is a process by which macrophages acquire a distinct phenotypic and functional profile in response to microenvironmental signals. The classically and alternatively activated (M1 and M2, respectively) macrophage phenotypes are defined by the specific molecular characteristics induced in response to prototypic pro-and anti-inflammatory cues. In this study, we used LPS/IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 to stimulate porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) in vitro and investigated the expression changes of several novel markers during macrophage polarization. Notably, we found that LPS/IFN-\u03b3-stimulated PAMs express prototypical M1 molecules, whereas IL-4-stimulated PAMs express M2 molecules. We also demonstrated that replication of the highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) strain HuN4 was effectively suppressed in LPS/IFN-\u03b3-stimulated M1 PAMs (M1 type), but not IL-4 stimulated M2 PAMs. However, this was not observed with the classic, less pathogenic CH-1a strain. Moreover, we found that M2 marker expression gradually increased after PAM infection with PRRSV, whereas no significant changes were found with M1 marker expression, suggesting that PRRSV infection may skew macrophage polarization towards an M2 phenotype. Finally, we found that anti-viral cytokine expression was significantly higher in M1 macrophages than in M2 macrophages or nonpolarized controls. In summary, our results show that PRRSV replication was significantly impaired in M1 PAMs, which may serve as a foundation for further understanding of the dynamic phenotypic changes during macrophage polarization and their effects on viral infection.",

PRRSV infection is characterized by spontaneous abortion and poor reproductive performance in pregnant sows, respiratory distress in young pigs and high mortality in piglets [22] . PRRSV has a very narrow cellular tropism, showing a preference for monocyte/macrophage lineage cells. Specifically, the virus infects certain subsets of differentiated macrophages in the lung, lymphoid tissues and placenta and replicates in testicular germ cells and monocytic lineage cells, particularly porcine alveolar macrophages [5, 6, 24, 30] . Thus, the lungs and lymphoid organs are obvious locations of prolonged viral replication and persistence [16] .",

            "text": "Macrophages play an important role in the first line of defense against invading pathogens, where they act as immune effectors and antigen presenting cells [9] . Macrophages also play a significant functional role in osteochondral repair [1, 8, 14] . Within fractures, macrophages are recruited during the early inflammatory phase and persist throughout the repair process [1] . During this time, macrophages polarize towards distinct phenotypes in response to environmental cues to support the multiple events occurring during wound repair [21] . In vitro exposure to interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) polarizes macrophages doi: 10 .1292/jvms.17-0258 towards a classically activated M1 phenotype marked by the release of catabolic, pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) [18] . The M1 phenotype triggers proinflammatory responses required to kill intracellular pathogens [10] . In contrast, macrophages are polarized to an alternatively activated M2 phenotype following IL-4, IL-10, or IL-13 stimulation. M2 macrophages release limited levels of pro-inflammatory factors; rather they secrete high levels of antiinflammatory molecules including IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) and IL-10 [18] . During inflammation, M2 macrophages serve to protect against tissue damage [13] . Most monocytotropic viral infections, such as those caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV) and influenza A virus (IAV), may affect macrophage polarization and thereby potentiate immunosuppression and/or immunopathology, which are generally associated with viral persistence and co-infections by pathogens of other phyla [2, 19, 34] . The consequence of viral infection on macrophage polarization has been directly demonstrated in HIV and RSV infections, and is associated with infections caused by human herpes viruses, IAV, SARS-CoV and other viruses [27] .",

For this, we established a macrophage polarization model using primary PAMs stimulated with LPS and IFN-\u03b3 or IL-4 to induce M1 or M2 polarization, respectively. M1 polarization was identified by the expression of IL-6, IL-12, TNF-\u03b1 and other pro-inflammatory cytokines, whereas M2 polarization was characterized by IL-10 and other anti-inflammatory molecules. Notably, we found that M1 polarization and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression significantly inhibited PRRSV replication, which was not observed in M2 cells. Moreover, PRRSV infection can effectively inhibit the release of interferons in PAMs and preferentially skew polarization to the M2 phenotype.",

IFA assays, anti-nucleocapsid protein (N protein) western blotting, qRT-PCR and viral titer analysis (TCID 50 ) showed that viral replication in control PAM progressively increased, peaked at 36 hr and then decreased until 48 hr post-infection (Fig. 4) .

PRRSV infection was monitored with IFA using a monoclonal antibody directed against the PRRSV N protein. Compared with untreated PAMs (M0-type), PAMs with LPS/IFN-\u03b3 stimulation (M1-type) showed a decreased cell population that was permissive to infection of both PRRSV strains. PAMs with IL-4 stimulation showed no significant change in the population of permissive cells (Fig. 5A and 5B ). In addition, to assess the replication abilities of different PRRSV strains in cells with different activation status, the RNA genome copy numbers for these two strains of PRRSV were determined using RT-PCR at 12, 24, 36 and 48 hr after infection. The replication level of HuN4-F2 strains in M1-type PAMs was significantly lower than that in M0-type and M2-type PAMs at 12, 24 and 36 hr, but not 48 hr (Fig.  5C) ; and the replication level of Ch-1a strains in M1-type PAMs was significantly lower than that in M0-type and M2-type PAMs at 12 and 24 hr, but not 36 and 48 hr (Fig. 5D ). In summary, M1 polarization with LPS/IFN-\u03b3 also inhibits the replication of other PRRSV strains, such as the HuN4-F2 and CH-1a strains. ",

Therefore, it is necessary to understand the morphology, marker expression and cytokine secretion that clearly define PAM subsets. Our data show the PAM activation (LPS/IFN-\u03b3 or IL-4 stimulation) elicits a changed phenotype, altered expression pattern of certain markers and different antiviral regulation.

A previous study showed that LPS/IFN-\u03b3 stimulation causes macrophages to stretch through cytoskeletal arrangements and modulates macrophage elasticity, which is a major determinant of innate macrophage functions such as phagocytosis [25] .

Overall, the specific production of these cytokines is consistent with reports for corresponding polarized murine macrophages. These data support the notion that PAMs are highly heterogeneous. Marker expression and cytokine production of PAMs are highly dependent on activation protocols. However, differences between species should be considered, e.g., there are no homologs of Ym1 and Fizz1 in humans [26] .

            "text": "In the present study, we demonstrated that HP-PRRSV replication was significantly impaired in M1 PAMs. Several studies have confirmed that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection is restricted through down-regulation of CD4 at the cell surface and up-regulation of the secretion of CCR5-binding chemokines (CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5) in M1-type macrophage [3] . PAMs are the primary cellular target for receptor-mediated PRRSV infection via sialoadhesin (SN), heparan sulfate (HS) and CD163 [7] . Thus, we theorized that the observed effect on PRRSV replication in M1 macrophages results from the decreased expression of viral receptors on the PAM surface. Although no significant change in HS expression was found between the two polarized subtypes compared with the control, SN and CD163 expression was markedly increased with the expression of SN in M1 and M2 macrophages, respectively (data not shown), thereby demonstrating that the diminished HP-PRRSV replication in M1 PAMs is not associated with viral receptor expression. In addition, the important feature of M1-type macrophages is that they activate host defense programs against invading pathogens, such as HIV-1, through up-regulation of several host restriction factors, e.g. APOBEC-3G and sterile alpha motif and HD domain (SAMHD)-1. It has been reported that SAMHD-1 inhibits HP-PRRSV replication by interfering with the synthesis viral genome cRNA in MARC-145 cells [33] . However, when M1-type cells were infected 48 hr after polarization in the present study, no inhibitory effects on PRRSV replication were observed. To some extent, the phenotype of polarized M1-M2 macrophages can be reversed in vitro and in vivo [12, 28] . Indeed, our unpublished data demonstrated that M0-/M1-type PAMs were re-polarized to the M2 type as a result of HP-PRRSV infection. These findings strongly suggest that HP-PRRSV infection can modulate macrophage polarization and might be the reason why M1-type PAMs did not restrict PRRSV at 48 hr after infection.",
