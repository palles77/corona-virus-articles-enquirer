BVD viruses are genetically highly variable. They are classified into two genetic species (BVDV-1 and -2) that are further divided into numerous subgroups, particularly for BVDV-1. The complexity of these viruses is also reflected in their interaction with the host animals. Infections are either transient or persistent and can cause a wide spectrum of clinical signs, from no or very mild disease to severe forms, reminiscent of viral haemorrhagic fevers. In this work, we have analysed the clinical signs and the pathology of BVD viral infections in a cattle population where different subgroups of BVDV-1 genotype viruses are endemic. In addition, we have examined potential virulence properties of BVDV-1 subgroups during persistent infection by comparing the viral subgroups present in clinical cases with those detected in persistently infected (PI) animals sampled for epidemiological criteria, irrespective of their health condition. Furthermore, the clinical and postmortem findings were compared with respect to genetic characteristics of the viruses isolated from these animals.",

Only the ncp biotype can establish a persistent infection of the foetus if the dam is transiently infected between approximately days 40 and 120 of its development. Even though such foetuses may develop normally, they remain infected for life and shed large quantities of virus, thereby assuring the persistence of BVDV in the cattle population even in the absence of animals susceptible to transient infection. Different from other persistent viral infections in man and animals, BVDV persistently infected (PI) cattle are immunotolerant to the infecting viral strain (reviewed in Peterhans et al., 2006) . The clinical consequences of infection with BVD virus are as diverse as the genetic and antigenic properties of these viruses. Disease can result from different pathogenetical mechanisms, depending on the different types of infection. Most transient infections may take an inapparent or mild course, associated with low-grade fever, diarrhoea and coughing. Rarely, however, acutely infected animals may suffer from high grade fever and bleeding in internal organs. This often fatal form of acute infection was reported in outbreaks in the late 80s and early 90s, caused by highly virulent BVD virus-2 strains (Ridpath et al., 2000 (Ridpath et al., , 2006 . Although generally considered to be of low virulence, BVDV-1, too, may cause similar severe disease signs in acutely infected animals, albeit only rarely (Liebler-Tenorio et al., 2000; Ridpath et al., 2007) .",

This lethal disease is characterised by mucosal lesions, destruction of the lymphoid tissue in the gastrointestinal tract (Liebler et al., 1995) and untreatable diarrhoea. The onset of the clinical signs is often acute but a more chronic form, called late onset MD, is also described (Liebler-Tenorio et al., 2000; Fritzemeier et al., 1997) .",

Grading the findings is an essential part of the standardised protocols used for initial clinical examination and necropsy.

Factors contributing to this complexity include two types of infection with entirely different involvement of the immune system (immune response in transient versus immunotolerance in persistent infection), two different biotypes of virus (noncytopathic versus cytopathic) and the diverse genetic These 14 animals were chosen due to availability of serum and absence of maternal antibodies. In persistent infection, in contrast, analysis of a potential impact of the viral strain on the clinical picture is, for a number of reasons, more difficult. Among them is the existence of disease signs associated with persistent infection as such, and the occurrence of MD as a form of infection associated with the emergence of a cytopathic biotype of BVDV in these immunotolerant animals. Furthermore, some of the signs of persistent infection unrelated to MD may be of chronic nature, such as growth retardation and general ill-thrift. However, as shown by pluriparous PI cows and PI bulls detected among the candidates for artificial insemination stations, clinical signs of persistent infection can be absent in some animals. Experimental generation of a sufficient number of PI animals with different strains of BVDV would be laborious and require long-term follow-up. In addition, many different factors such as time point of maternal infection, genetic background of the animals and environmental factors, e.g. the presence of various other cattle pathogens, may modulate the outcome. Moreover, the epidemiological situation -endemic versus non-endemic -may influence the clinical appearance of infections. It is not surprising, therefore, that questions such as the impact of BVDV genetic properties on the health status of a PI animal, or possible associations between disease signs and a given subgroup of BVDV during this type of infection, have to date not been addressed.",

Mucosal lesions were more frequent in older and lung lesions in younger animals (Fig. 2) ; that held also true when the two animal groups (A + B and C) were tested separately (data not shown). The reason for the correlation between age and the postmortem finding may be related to the higher risk of MD onset with increasing age. MD is correlated to the appearance of the cp virus that arises as a result of mutations or recombination during viral RNA replication from the persisting ncp virus (Deregt and Loewen, 1995; Neill and Ridpath, 2001; Lackner et al., 2004) . Statistically, a longer time period of viral replication may increase the risk of generating mutations leading to a cp biotype.

To overcome this problem we combined a virological determination of MD of selected cases (namely the isolation of both biotypes) with a standardised pathological investigation ( Table 2) . The latter was achieved by creating a ''mucosal (mc) index'', comparable to other clinical or pathological indices, e.g. the psoriasis area severity index (PASI) in human dermatology. Typically, MD leads to mucosal lesions at multiple locations of the digestive tract. Therefore, the mc index places more weight on the number of affected organs than on the severity of single lesions. This approach also minimizes individual differences in rating the severity of lesions and favours completeness of the necropsy reports. The results of the comparison of the biotype analysis with the mc index (Table 2 ) support the validity of the concept.",

With the exception of the single ''orphan'' BVD 1x strain, we found the same four BVD-1 subgroups in the diseased animals and in the PI animals sampled in the course of an epidemiological survey. Although sampled in the same time period, the two large groups of PI animals are not matched with respect to breed, age or gender. On the one hand, using unmatched hosts, only major differences in tropism and virulence would show up. The results of our study argue against such major differences between entire subgroups. On the other hand, this observation does not exclude that individual strains may differ in virulence and tropism, as shown for transient infections.",

In this context, the possibility that these patterns might be influenced by the presence (or absence) of other pathogens needs to be considered. Such pathogens could include other viruses, bacteria and parasites. Viruses known to induce similar clinical signs and pathology, i.e. bovine herpesvirus-1 and ovine herpesvirus-2, can be excluded. The former is eradicated in Switzerland, and all PI animals suspected of suffering from malignant catarrhal fever tested negative for this lethal form of infection caused by ovine herpes virus-2 (Ackermann, 2005) . Where data were available, we recorded additional bacteriological and parasitological examinations. However, in most cases the suspected infections were not confirmed.",

However, we observed a tendency for viruses of subgroup 1h to be more frequently isolated from animals with mucosal lesions, while 1e was the predominant subgroup in animals with lung alterations (Fig. 4) . Regarding the age dependency of the mucosal and pulmonary manifestations (Fig. 2) , the observed subgroup tendencies may well correlate to different age groups of PI animals rather than reflect a selective organ tropism. Indeed, 38% of the animals younger than 7 months (7 months = median age of all animals analysed) harboured BVDV-1e, while this proportion was only 29% in older animals (!7 months). Since all PI animals are infected as foetuses, animals infected with BVDV-1e may die younger than animals infected with other subgroups and are therefore less frequently observed among older animals. This is supported by the observation of a surprisingly high proportion of BVDV-1e strains in abortions, stillbirths and neonates (Fig. 4) , which clearly encourages additional investigations. We can exclude that a 1e live vaccine may be responsible, since, as indicated above, vaccines are used only very infrequently, and a 1e vaccine is not licensed in Switzerland. Moreover, we can also exclude that a particular strain of 1e may cause these abortions because the sequence data indicate that genetically different strains were present in these animals (Bachofen et al., 2008) .",

Studies on the virulence of individual strains of BVDV focus on transient infections. Experimental infections and analysis of disease outbreaks in transiently infected animals characterised by particular signs and severity of disease clearly suggested an influence of the infecting viral strain on disease manifestation. For example,Baule et al. (2001) as well asJones et al. (2004), have shown BVDV-1d strains to be associated with respiratory disease in acutely infected calves. Furthermore,Ridpath et al. (2007) could experimentally reproduce the clinical symptoms caused by virulent BVDV-1 strains in acutely infected heifers.",
