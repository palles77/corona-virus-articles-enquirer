We investigated its interactions with 3 chlorine disinfectants to determine if the additive would adversely affect the disinfectants' antimicrobial efficacy or skin safety. Methods: We tested 0.5% sodium hypochlorite, 0.2% calcium hypochlorite, and 0.5% sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC) alone versus with color additive. An independent laboratory tested efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Vibrio cholerae, and human coronavirus 229E. An independent laboratory also tested direct skin irritation. Results: Chlorine disinfectants with and without color additive achieved equal levels of efficacy against the tested pathogens. Against S. aureus, 0.5% sodium hypochlorite with and without color additive met Environmental Protection Agency criteria for disinfection success. Against human coronavirus 229E, 0.5% sodium hypochlorite alone failed disinfection success criteria, whereas 0.5% sodium hypochlorite with color additive achieved full viral inactivation (\u22654.50 log10 reduction). Against V. cholerae, 0.2% calcium hypochlorite alone and with color additive achieved 5.99 log10 and >6.03 log10 reductions, respectively. Against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, 0.5% NaDCC with and without color additive achieved >4.9 log10 and >3.54 log10 reductions, respectively. All 3 chlorine disinfectants with color additive tested as negligible skin irritants. Conclusions: This color additive can be combined with chlorine disinfectants without adversely affecting antimicrobial efficacy or skin safety.",

            "text": "tings, as spray disinfectants have been shown to cover less than 33% of a surface or evaporate in less than 2 minutes, without reaching required wet-contact times. [3] [4] [5] These shortfalls severely limit the effectiveness of environmental surface cleaning as an infection prevention strategy. Less than 50% of high-touch surfaces in healthcare facilities are properly cleaned. 6 One study found that despite housekeepers being instructed to use 10% bleach to clean rooms with Clostridium difficileinfected patients, 78% of these rooms still tested positive for C. difficile after terminal cleaning. 7 There is a consensus that improving compliance with disinfection protocols and techniques is critical to reducing HAIs. 2, [7] [8] [9] A novel color additive, Highlight \u00ae (Kinnos Inc, Brooklyn, New York), colorizes chlorine disinfectants blue to allow for improved visibility and thoroughness of application. Upon spraying on a surface, chlorine disinfectants with the color additive fade from blue to colorless to indicate when the proper contact time has been met. They also exhibit lowered surface tension that improves spray surface coverage to >99.9%. 4, 10 This novel additive addresses the major shortfalls of environmental cleaning by ensuring compliance with wet-contact time, improving coverage of sprayed surfaces, and providing real-time ability to monitor cleaning techniques. This color additive is considered an adjuvant under U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidelines and does not require registration as a pesticide. 11 However, given the novel nature of this product, it is important to demonstrate that its addition to chlorine disinfectants does not compromise antimicrobial efficacy or pose any safety risks. We evaluated the effect of color additive on the antimicrobial efficacy and skin safety of 3 major chlorine disinfectants: 0.5% sodium hypochlorite, 0.2% calcium hypochlorite and 0.5% sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC). This study presents the efficacy test results of an independent Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)compliant facility against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Vibrio cholerae, and human coronavirus 229E. This study also presents results from another independent GLP-compliant laboratory that tested skin irritation from chlorine disinfectants with and without color additive. Our results confirm that when added to chlorine disinfectants, the color additive does not reduce antimicrobial efficacy or cause skin irritation.",

Interestingly, 0.5% sodium hypochlorite alone failed due to recovery of infectious viral particles in 1 of the lots. This result may have been due to factors such as inconsistencies in spray application and coverage between lots. Given the design of this study, in which a plate of dried virus film was sprayed with the disinfectant, it is possible that the surface coverage-improving properties of the color additive contributed to improved efficacy compared to 0.5% sodium hypochlorite alone, which tends to bead up and form droplets when sprayed. 33 A recent study demonstrated that typical bleach disinfectants cover <33% of a sprayed surface and lose coverage over the duration of the contact time, whereas the addition of color additive improved bleach surface coverage to >99.9% and maintained this level of coverage for 15 minutes. 4 When used in real-world settings, this color additive may maximize the efficacy of bleach disinfectants due to superior spray coverage.",

[1] [2] [3] Lack of adherence to protocol and poor techniques can be mitigated with careful monitoring and educational interventions. One study detailing the successful reduction of C. difficile contamination from 78% to 11% concluded that environmental cleaning interventions should provide a way to both monitor cleaning techniques and provide feedback to housekeeping staff. 7 However, these monitoring programs are difficult to enforce and sustain given that housekeeper turnover reaches up to 50% in some facilities. 38, 39 The color-fading properties of the color additive allow it to function as a visible, real-time feedback mechanism for thoroughness of cleaning and adherence to wet-contact times. One recent study found that healthcare personnel were more successful in correctly identifying surfaces that had been sprayed with bleach if the color additive had been added. 40 Another study demonstrated that the color additive improved the surface coverage properties of bleach sprays from <33% to >99.9%. 4 We recently found that workers at Ebola treatment units in Liberia and Guinea reported increased coverage and confidence of disinfection when combining the color additive with their currently used chlorine solutions. 10 Although this color additive is suggested for use only on hard, nonporous surfaces, as is similarly recommended for chlorine disinfectants, it has potential applications in other settings like veterinarian clinics, food sanitation, and forensic restoration.",

Carriers were prepared by autoclaving 100x15mm glass petri dishes. Then, 200 \u03bcL of viral inoculum was spread evenly inside the bottom surfaces of the carriers using a sterile cell scraper, then left to dry for 20 minutes under ambient conditions.
