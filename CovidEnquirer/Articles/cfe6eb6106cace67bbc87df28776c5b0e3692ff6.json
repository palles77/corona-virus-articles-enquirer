This study aimed to assess the epidemiologic characteristics, risk factors, and outcomes of vRTI occurring in the period from conditioning to 100 days after allo-HSCT in the era of molecular testing. This study was a retrospective record review of patients who underwent allo-HSCT at Royal Melbourne Hospital between January 2010 and December 2015. Symptomatic patients were tested using respiratory multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to identify risk factors for vRTI and the risk of death or intensive care unit (ICU) admission, respectively. A total of 382 patients were reviewed, and 65 episodes of vRTI were identified in 56 patients (14.7%). Rhinovirus accounted for the majority of infections (69.2%). The majority of episodes presented initially with upper respiratory tract infection (58.5%), with 28.9% of them progressing to lower respiratory tract infection. Eleven episodes (16.9%) were associated with ICU admission. There were no deaths directly due to vRTI. Previous autologous HSCT was associated with an increased risk of vRTI (odds ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 4.1). The risks of death (P = .47) or ICU admission (P = .65) were not significantly different by vRTI status. vRTI is common in the first 100 days after allo-HSCT and is associated with ICU admission.",

            "text": "Our study demonstrates that vRTI is an important cause of morbidity in allo-HSCT recipients. Up to 17% of vRTI episodes necessitated ICU admission and 14% required the use of mechanical ventilation, percentages consistent with previous reports [24] [25] [26] . Overall, close to 40% of patients had LRTI on initial presentation. Progression to LRTI occurred in 31% of infections, most commonly involving rhinovirus. Progression to LRTI was also observed in 25% of RSV URTI episodes, a higher rate than reported previously [28] . Both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system, particularly neutrophils and cytotoxic T cells, play integral roles in the defense against vRTI [19] . Th1-dominant responses, * Includes 1 episode in which both RSV and rhinovirus were detected concurrently. \u2020 Percentages do not sum to 100 because 2 episodes of rhinovirus infection were identified as neither URTI nor LRTI, because there was insufficient information available for classification. \u2021 Nonattributable death was calculated using the number of patients. mediated by IFN-\u03b3, appear to have a protective role in RSV infections, whereas Th2 responses may be associated with more severe disease manifestations [29] . The profound immune depletion and impaired immune responses seen in the acute period following transplantation could account for the rates of initial LRTI and progression seen even with respiratory viruses considered less pathogenic, such as rhinoviruses. In addition, our cohort had a lower rate of antiviral therapy for RSV. Because we did not evaluate pulmonary function test results, the risk for vRTI and later complications, such as airway disease, as shown previously by Erard et al. [30] , could not be assessed. A limitation of this study was the number of RVs included in the multiplex PCR panel. Other RVs, such as parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, and hMPV, were not routinely tested but might be important causes of morbidity in these patients. As such, rhinovirus as a cause of vRTI and its burden in the study may be overestimated. Furthermore, because in this study we examined only prevalence, risk factors, and outcomes of vRTI within 100 days following transplantation our results might be not translatable beyond this time frame. However, because this is a known high-risk period [23, 31] , our study focused on this time frame to highlight the importance of early preventive measures and infection control measures among patients as well as healthcare workers following transplantation.",
