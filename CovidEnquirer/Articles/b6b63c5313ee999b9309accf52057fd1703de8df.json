Since China is still in the process of urbanisation, the greatest challenge it faces is finding a balance between economic growth and keeping carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emission rates at a manageable level. Cities in China play a key role in the implementation of the central policies and make concrete actions in response to climate change. With reference to a series of recent policy papers and action plans as the background, this paper attempts to provide a critical overview of China's climate change action plans from the national to the city and urban level. It seeks to understand whether the proposed responses to climate change and strategies for actions on greening and air corridors for cities and urban areas are appropriate. It is found that for China to advance its urban climatic adaptation strategy there is a need for (1) urban data, (2) a cross-disciplinary impact assessment, and (3) the development of a market and policy transformation mechanism.",

Global warming and climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions are now at the top of the global agenda (UN-Habitat, 2011; IPCC, 2014) . As the largest developing country in the region of East Asia, China contributes a dominant and increasing share of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This has naturally attracted international attention and concern (Chen, 2012) . Since 2014, China has actively embarked on a number of policies and action plans on the subject of climate change. However, it is never an easy task to understand China's climate change policies. They are not only related to the issues of national image, domestic and foreign policy, transnational cooperation, energy cost and economic growth, but also motivated or driven by other factors such as ecological protection, growing public awareness and civil society's attitude (Chen, 2012; Zhang, 2003; Economy, 1997; Economy, 1998; Hatch, 2003) .",

            "text": "Unlike many other studies that attempt to explain China's climate change policies from a purely economic or political perspective, this paper aims to provide an overview of China's climate change strategies and actions to dissect its policy papers and action plans critically at both the national and city levels. Firstly, the paper examines China's climate change policy papers and plans not only in the context of global climate change, but also against its domestic contextual circumstances. Some of its key motivations may then be better positioned; some of its key claims of deliverables better contextualised; and a perspective of its path ahead better visualised. In so doing, the effectiveness of China's strategies and road maps may be better appreciated, and some of the many obstacles it is going to face may be better delineated. Secondly, China's National Climate Change Programme is outlined to provide a background and context of its adaptation plans. Thirdly, the paper analyses the 'China's Policies and Actions for Addressing Climate Change' report and five highlights from it. It is argued that since the priority of economic growth is set by the central government, and the multi-layer inter-governmental bureaucratic structure strictly follows China's top-down political system, it is very difficult to examine the performance of those adaption plans and strategies. It is also hard to tell whether or not they can be followed and practiced in reality at the city level, because there is no specialised legislation and implementation mechanism to supervise and guarantee the performance of the climate change actions in China. Fourthly, the paper introduces China's recent effort to relate its climate change policies to urban climate and its series of policy papers and action plans for cities since 2014, all of which are related to the growing public awareness on environmental problems and the people's call for an improved quality of life. Among them, the Greening Masterplan and Air Corridor Masterplan are two key measures designated by the central government. Three selected examples of Wuhan, Macau and Hong Kong are introduced and discussed and an insight is offered into how local government and researchers can work together to evaluate urban climatic conditions and implement corresponding application strategies to local urban development in the adaptation to climate change. Lastly, based on the lessons learnt from the application in China, the paper concludes and highlights that there are three urgent needs in a country's response to climate change: 1) an available, accessible and standard urban database for cities in China; 2) cross-disciplinary collaboration and impact assessment; and 3) a market and policy transformation mechanism.",

On the same occasion, Chinese Vice-Premier Zhang Gao-Li, representing Asia's largest contributor to CO 2 emissions, made a response and promised that, \"We will announce post-2020 actions on climate change as soon as we can to markedly reduce carbon intensity, increase the share of non-fossil fuels and raise the forest stock.\" (Sturmer, 2014) .",

The number of hot nights will increase faster than those of hot days. It is easy for people to ignore the potential health impact of hot nights. Generally speaking, an increase of 2% heat stress related mortality may be expected for every 1 degree rise in air temperature beyond the threshold level . A major challenge for developed cities is that most of their infrastructure and building stock are already there.

More importantly, recent research has pointed to the \"switching on\" of air conditioner behaviour when air temperature reaches a certain threshold (Frankel et al., 2013; Hong and Lin, 2013) . When the threshold is crossed, the increase in energy use is dramatic. For tropical and sub-tropical cities, when the ambient air temperature, especially in the evening, is very close to this threshold, it only takes a degree or two of temperature increase to change people's energy use behaviour.",

For example, Hong Kong, a small city territorially speaking, spends US$250 million per year to maintain and upgrade its 60,000 man-made slopes in or next to the city. On the other hand, extreme precipitation may also lead to flooding. Many Chinese cities have invested in and worked towards an update of their water drainage systems since 2013.

With reference to the National Climate Change Policy in Asia, governments tend to treat each climate change impact individually to provide corresponding mitigation and adaption strategies. However, many governments in Asia do not seem to be fully aware of the strategies' potential, or ready to deal with the unpredicted climatic disasters, since their urban expansion is very often unplanned or has gone out of hand. For example, there is no evidence to suggest that any of them, when working on their climate change preparation, adopted the World Bank's Urban Risk Assessment (WB, 2011) as a framework, or other similar frameworks (e.g. Urban Climate Change Research Network's ARC3.2 city planning framework (Rosenzweig et al., 2015) ).",

It is very often found that adaptation is probably more challenging than mitigation measures given China's top-down political system. It might be easy for a nation to develop an adaptation plan, however, a plan is only as good as its implementation and realisation. For many developing Asian countries, this, perhaps more than the need for mitigation measures, is the real challenge. Apart from the need to finance adaptation measures, the other challenge is technology. Both detection and facilitation technologies are needed, that is to say, knowing \"where the problems are\" and \"how to tackle the problems\" requires technological knowhow that may exceed the capability of many developing nations.

Unfortunately, this number alone will make COP21's two-degree target impossible.

For the Chinese Government, the riskiest challenges are agriculture and water resources (Darkin, 2008) . Drought-and flood-related crop failure poses the highest impact not only socially and economically, but also politically. China's agriculture and water infrastructure is outdated.

The need for technical and professional understanding of the urban climate is well documented in Grimond's and Mill's seminal papers presented in the World Climate Conference 3 gathering in Geneva in 2009 (Grimmond et al., 2010; Mills et al., 2010) . China is beginning to amass the technical knowledge of how to gather data and generate scientific understanding.

However, the challenge lies in the institutional translation of technical understanding into policy and action.

The call has been echoed by Professor Gerald Mills and his co-authors (Mills et al., 2010) . Two fundamental qualities of the needed information are their \"criticality\" and that they are \"prevailing\" (Mills, 2006; Ng, 2012) . It is important to cross the river by feeling the stonesthat is to say, there must be monitoring and feedback mechanisms in place to allow achievements to be measured, and more importantly, adjustments to the course to be made. When it comes to policy, the benefits must be beyond the environment. Economists have a role to play here especially when one is dealing with a capitalist economy. The short-term and the long-term payback and cost benefits must be quantified and communicated. In addition, sociologists are needed to help elaborate the qualitative and community benefits to the society. A win-win situation may not be found all the time, but there must be platforms that allow trade-offs and the balancing act to be negotiated among various parties.",

China issued its first National Climate Change Program in 2007 (National Development and Reform Commission [NDRC], 2007). In a nutshell, the 2007 Program set up six guiding principles (United Nations General Assembly, 2007): 1. To address climate change within the framework of sustainable development; 2. To place equal emphasis on both mitigation and adaptation; 3. To integrate climate change policy with other interrelated policies; 4. To rely on the advancement and innovation of science and technology; 5. To follow the principle of \"common but differentiated responsibilities\"; and 6. To actively engage in wide international cooperation. The 2007 Program also set up a number of objectives (United Nations General Assembly, 2007):1. To reduce energy consumption per unit GDP by 20%;",

Monitoring and Early Warning: The China Meteorological Administration and the State Oceanic Administration are charged with providing the needed early warning and monitoring mechanisms. 3. Agriculture and Water Resources: The Outline of National Agricultural Water Conservation (2012\u22122020) promotes water-saving agriculture. Strictest Water Resources Management Systems have been developed for river basin protection. 4. Coastal Areas and Ecosystems: Overseen by the State Oceanic Administration, the coastal defences are being reinforced. The long coast lines and cities on or near the flood plains are the key challenges. A report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reckons that a number of Chinese cities, including Guangzhou, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hong Kong, and Qingdao, are ranked in the top 20 most vulnerable cities (Pan et al., 2011). 5.
