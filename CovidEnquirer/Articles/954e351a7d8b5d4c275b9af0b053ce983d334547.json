            "text": "Abdominal auscultation is particularly useful for assessing the motility of the large intestine. Progressive motility of the small intestine, conversely, is difficult to distinguish by auscultation from nonprogressive motility. The distinct character of the borborygmi produced during propulsive contractions of the cecum and ascending colon allows evaluation of the frequency and strength of retropulsion and propulsion. Propulsive contractions of the cecum and ventral colon occur every 3 to 4 minutes and give rise to prolonged rushing sounds heard over long segments of intestine. Retropulsive sounds presumably are similar to propulsive sounds, but they occur less frequently. Distinguishing between propulsion and retropulsion is not important clinically because both types of contractions signify normal motility. Interhaustral and intrahaustral mixing contractions produce nonspecific sounds of fluid and ingesta movement that are difficult to distinguish from other borborygmi, such as small intestinal contractions or spasmodic contractions. 1 Auscultation over the right flank and proceeding along the caudal edge of the costal margin toward the xiphoid allows evaluation of the cecal borborygmi. Auscultation over a similar area on the left side allows evaluation of the pelvic flexure and ascending colon. Typical progressive borborygmi heard every 3 to 4 minutes on both sides of the abdomen indicate normal motility of the cecum and ascending colon. Less frequent progressive sounds may indicate a pathologic condition of the large intestine or may result from anorexia, nervousness (sympathetic tone), or pharmacologic inhibition of motility (i.e., \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists such as xylazine). [2] [3] [4] [5] Absolute absence of any auscultable borborygmi suggests abnormal motility and indicates ileus resulting from a serious pathologic condition but is not specific to any segment of the intestine. 3, 6 If borborygmi are audible but progressive sounds are not detectable, determining whether a significant abnormality exists is difficult, and such findings should not be overinterpreted. 6 Borborygmi heard more frequently than normal may result from increased motility following feeding; from excessive stimulation from irritation, distention, or inflammation; or after administration of parasympathomimetic drugs such as neostigmine. Large intestinal motility increases in the early stages of intestinal distention regardless of the site. 7 Mild inflammation or irritation of the large intestinal mucosa also can stimulate motility. 3 Parasympathomimetic drugs stimulate contractions and auscultable borborygmi in the large intestine; an increase in parasympathetic tone may result in segmental contractions, which actually inhibit progressive motility. 2 Percussion of the abdomen during auscultation can reveal gas in the large intestine. The characteristic ping produced by simultaneous digital percussion and auscultation over a gasfilled viscus often is associated with abnormal accumulation of gas under pressure. This technique is particularly useful in foals, ponies, and Miniature Horses because of the limitations of rectal palpation.",

            "text": "Transrectal palpation is the most specific physical examination technique for investigation of intestinal disease and is particularly valuable when evaluating obstructive diseases. 8 The primary objectives of transrectal palpation are to assess the size, consistency, and position of the segments of the large intestine; to determine the presence of any distention of the small intestine; and to detect intraabdominal masses. Evaluation of the wall thickness and texture and the mesenteric structures (blood and lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes) also may aid in diagnosis of large intestinal disease. The interpretation of transrectal palpation findings in light of clinical signs and laboratory results is an important diagnostic aid for developing appropriate treatment strategies for intestinal diseases manifested by abdominal pain. Enlargement of one or more segments of large intestine detected by transrectal palpation provides evidence of obstruction at or distal to the enlarged segment. By systematically evaluating each segment, the site of obstruction may be determined. Obstruction of the pelvic flexure, for instance, results in enlargement of the pelvic flexure and ventral colon, but the dorsal and descending colons are of normal size. Enlargement of a segment of the large intestine usually is accompanied by abnormal consistency of the contents. It is possible to distinguish among gas, fluid, and ingesta and to detect foreign bodies in palpable segments. Accumulation of gas and fluid suggests complete and acute obstruction, whereas accumulation of ingesta suggests chronic and incomplete obstruction. Accumulation of fluid usually indicates ileus. The practitioner must evaluate the consistency of the contents in light of the size of the segment; ingesta in the ventral colon of a dehydrated patient may be firm, but the size of the ventral colon will be normal. Conversely, if the ingesta is firm because of a distal obstruction, the ventral colon will be enlarged.",

Torsion of the ascending colon at the sternal and diaphragmatic flexures results in acute accumulation of gas and fluid proximal to the torsion, causing distention of the left dorsal and ventral colons. Depending on the degree of torsion, the position of the ventral and dorsal colons may not be significantly abnormal. Displacement of a segment of large intestine often results in incomplete obstruction, and the diagnosis is either confirmed on detection of the displaced segment in an abnormal position or suspected when the segment is not palpable in a normal position. A determination should be made as to whether the segment that appears to be displaced is in a normal position but of smaller than normal size because of a decreased volume of ingesta. The cecum, right dorsal and ventral colons, pelvic flexure, and descending colon are palpable in most horses. The nephrosplenic space should be palpated to detect the presence of intestine, usually pelvic flexure, entrapped within the ligament.",

Intraluminal masses caused by lymphoma, eosinophilic enteritis, foreign bodies, or ascarid impactions often lead to small intestinal distention and are usually indistinguishable from one another on the basis of palpation alone. Small intestine in these cases can be moderately to severely distended, depending on the degree of obstruction. Extraluminal obstructions include abdominal masses and large colon displacement. The rest of the abdomen should be carefully palpated to help rule out these causes. Some cases of small intestinal distention result from physiologic ileus rather than mechanical obstruction.

Increased blood lactate can result from a variety of causes, including hypovolemia, and blood lactate alone should not be used for diagnostic or prognostic purposes in horses with colic. 11 Increases in blood lactate over time are greater in nonsurvivors, relative to survivors, in adult equine emergencies (many of which had gastrointestinal disease). 12 Portable lactate analyzers have demonstrated variable intraanalyzer reliability in equine blood so that caution should be exercised in interpretation and comparison of results reported from various searches. 13, 14 Metabolic acidosis may accompany lactic acidemia, but an inconsistent association exists between the two, especially when mixed acid-base imbalances are present. 15, 16 Increases in hepatic enzymes, specifically \u03b3-glutamyl transferase (GGT), may occur with large colon displacements, duodenal strictures, or proximal enteritis. Increased GTT is more suggestive of right, rather than left, dorsal displacement. 17 Relative polycythemia from hemoconcentration or splenic contraction and changes in red blood cell deformability from hypoxia or hypocalcemia may increase blood viscosity. Blood viscosity increases in patients with acute obstructive disease. Hyperviscosity reduces perfusion of capillary beds, exacerbating ischemia and tissue hypoxia. 18 ",

Large volumes of blood (1-2 L) given by nasogastric tube were required to produce a positive test for occult blood in the feces, but the amount of blood originating from the large intestine required to produce a positive test is unknown. Despite initial reports to the contrary, 30 there does not appear to be any correlation between endoscopic evidence of glandular or nonglandular gastric ulceration and detection of fecal albumin or hemoglobin. 31 Bacteriologic examination of the fecal flora has been used in horses with diarrhea. Quantitation of clostridial species may be beneficial in diagnosing clostridial infection of the large intestine, although tests to detect clostridial toxins in intestinal contents or feces are important for determining whether clostridia cultured from the feces are causing disease. The most common bacterial pathogens isolated from the feces of horses are Salmonella spp. and Clostridium spp. The number of Salmonella organisms isolated from the feces of horses with clinical salmonellosis is usually higher than from horses with asymptomatic infections. However, the volume of feces in many cases of acute diarrhea is high, and the concentration of Salmonella organisms may be lower than would be expected, accounting for many false-negative fecal cultures. The sensitivity of fecal cultures for detecting Salmonella infection may be as low as 20%. Culture of five consecutive daily fecal samples is recommended to increase the sensitivity of the test. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays used on fecal samples can detect DNA from Salmonella spp. and have performed well in recent validation studies; accuracy of pointof-care tests remains elusive.

Thoracic radiographs may be necessary to detect megaesophagus or cranial mediastinal masses causing extraluminal obstruction. Barium swallows or double-contrast esophagrams may be used after resolution of an esophageal obstruction to determine whether a stricture, diverticulum, or other underlying disorder is present, although endoscopy can provide similar information. Barium sulfate is the usual contrast medium and can be administered orally by way of a dose syringe or nasogastric tube (50-100 mL of a 40% barium sulfate suspension or barium paste). Oral administration is preferred for evaluation of swallowing and lesions in the proximal esophagus. Administration of contrast using a nasogastric tube (preferably cuffed) allows for delivery of larger volumes of barium (up to 500 mL) but should be performed without sedation if possible. Administration of contrast material can be followed with air insufflation to create a doublecontrast effect. If rupture of the esophagus is suspected or if the contrast material is likely to be aspirated, barium should be avoided, and iodinated organic compounds in an aqueous solution should be used as contrast material to decrease the potential for adverse effects. When interpreting esophageal radiographs, the veterinarian should take particular care if the horse is sedated. Acepromazine or detomidine administration causes esophageal dilation in normal horses, especially after passage of a nasogastric tube. 36 Radiography of the adult equine abdomen is an effective technique in detecting radiodense material in the large intestine, such as enteroliths, sand, and metallic objects. [37] [38] [39] [40] One survey demonstrated that radiography has 76.9% sensitivity and 94.4% specificity for diagnosing enterolithiasis. 40 Recently, an objective scoring system demonstrated greater efficacy and less interobserver variability than a subjective assessment of radiographic sand accumulation in horses with or without a clinical diagnosis of sand colic. 38 The large size and density of the adult abdomen preclude evaluation of soft tissue structures because the detail and contrast of the radiographs are usually poor, and ultrasonography is a much more useful imaging modality in the equine abdomen.",

[41] [42] [43] [44] Y ULTRASONOGRAPHY Transcutaneous ultrasonographic evaluation of the abdomen is quick and noninvasive and can add valuable information in cases of acute or chronic gastrointestinal disease. Ultrasound has become a virtually indispensable tool for horses with acute or chronic gastrointestinal conditions. This section provides a brief summary. Examination of the adult horse requires a 2.5-to 5.0-MHz transducer, depending on size of the horse; a curvilinear transducer is preferred. A functional examination is often performed with isopropyl alcohol saturation alone, although clipping, with or without coupling gel, can be used to enhance evaluation, especially in large or overweight patients.",

A complete examination requires a methodical approach to the evaluation of the entire abdomen; details of the examination can be variable based on equipment and experience of the examiner. A complete review of abdominal ultrasound is beyond the scope of this chapter; a thorough, detailed examination is reviewed elsewhere. 46 In general terms, a quick examination of the acute abdomen should include estimation of gastric size and assessment of small intestinal diameter, wall thickness, motility, and location. Specific abnormalities, such as ascarid impaction or intussusception, may also be visible. Evaluation of the large colon and cecum should include estimation of mural thickening or increased fluidity of contents, and whether or not the colon obscures viewing of the left kidney in the left paralumbar fossa. It is important to remember that other causes of colonic distention can have the same result; thus, it is always important to combine physical, rectal, and ultrasonographic examination findings for any given case. Sand impactions may appear as hyperechoic bands on the ventral abdominal wall, 47 but according to the author and others, 46 ultrasound does not allow for consistent diagnosis of sand accumulation. Evaluation of the abdomen always should include assessment of the peritoneal space for any evidence of an increased amount or echogenicity of PF. Ultrasonography also can be useful in determining the ideal location for abdominocentesis.",

Horses fed a high-energy (oat chaff, oats, and corn) diet had a lower mean peak plasma d-xylose concentration (14.1 mg/ dL versus 24.9 mg/dL) than those consuming a low-energy (alfalfa chaff) diet. 61 Healthy mares fasted for up to 96 hours had flatter curves and a slower decrease in plasma xylose than when fasted for 12 to 36 hours. 64 Kinetic analysis indicates that prolonged food deprivation does not alter renal or nonrenal excretion of d-xylose; thus, the effect of fasting on the curve is likely related to either intestinal transit, small intestinal absorption, or both. 66, 67 Ponies may have lower peak d-xylose concentrations than horses, although the range is wide, and diagnostic discriminatory cutoff points for peak plasma xylose concentrations have not been determined.

Rectal mucosal biopsies are easy to collect, with few complications. Fullthickness biopsy often provides more thorough analysis and can be directed based on serosal appearance via a flank, ventral midline, or laparoscopic approach. When taking gastric or duodenal biopsies endoscopically for the putative diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disorders, multiple samples are recommended. The likelihood of establishing an accurate diagnosis varies with tissue quality, number of samples, skill of the endoscopist, and submission technique. 75 Laparoscopy Laparoscopic evaluation of the equine abdomen requires specialized equipment and training. The laparoscopic procedure can be done with the horse standing or recumbent. Advantages of this technique over a flank or ventral midline celiotomy include smaller incisions, shorter healing time, and shorter procedure time. Disadvantages include equipment and personnel needs, limited therapeutic potential, and limited visual field, especially relative to midline celiotomy. Potential gastrointestinal applications of abdominal laparoscopy include the correction of rectal tears; percutaneous abscess drainage, assessment of adhesions, displacements, and integrity of the serosa of various bowel segments; biopsy of abdominal masses; and closure of the nephrosplenic space.

Although the cellular and vascular response and the secreted mediators of inflammation are important for killing pathogens and limiting invasion of injured tissues by commensal organisms, they can be quite damaging to host cells and proteins if not tightly regulated. If the inciting stimulus is not eliminated quickly, then the inflammatory response itself will cause significant tissue injury. The mechanism regulating inflammation has been the focus of a great deal of research to identify therapeutic targets to modulate the damage to host tissues that occurs in many gastrointestinal diseases.

The major sources for these mediators include activated leukocytes, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. The primary determinant of blood flow early in inflammation is vascular caliber, which initially decreases in arterioles but then quickly changes to vasodilation coincident with the opening of new capillary beds, increasing net blood flow. The increase in blood flow is relatively short-lived, because the viscosity of the blood increases from fluid loss and tissue edema resulting from leaky capillaries. Leukocyte margination, platelet adhesion to endothelial cells and exposed matrix, and areas of coagulation protein accumulation further decrease local circulation.",

Histamine, leukotrienes, PAF, prostaglandins, bradykinin, and other mediators stimulate endothelial cell contraction, and interendothelial gaps form. 92, 93 This stage of increased vascular permeability is readily reversible. Concurrently, mediators such as the cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 induce a structural reorganization of the interendothelial junctions, resulting in frank discontinuities in the endothelial monolayer. 94 Cytokines also stimulate endothelial cells to express adhesion molecules that support adhesion of leukocytes and platelets, 95 leading to the next and perhaps most devastating event. Leukocytes (primarily neutrophils) and platelets adhere to exposed basement membranes and activated endothelial cells. Adherent neutrophils and platelets are then exposed to the mediators of inflammation present in the surrounding milieu, which activates the cells to release oxidants and proteases (particularly elastase) that injure the endothelium and have the potential to cause irreparable harm to the microvasculature. [96] [97] [98] Marginated neutrophils begin to transmigrate between endothelial cells (as described in later sections), which, if in sufficiently large numbers, disrupts the integrity of the interendothelial junctions, worsening the vascular leakage. 97 These stages of enhanced vascular permeability can be conceptualized as a mechanism to allow plasma proteins to enter the tissues and to potentiate the critical influx of leukocytes into tissues. However, if they are not regulated precisely, alterations in both hydrostatic and oncotic forces and irreversible damage to the vascular bed may have devastating consequences. Moreover, inappropriate activation of plasma protein cascades and leukocytes by activated endothelium and exposed matrix proteins can contribute to SIRS (see the later section Gastrointestinal Ileus for more information) characterized by hypotension, generalized vascular leak syndrome, and multiorgan dysfunction, which may be fatal. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors reduce endothelial permeability in ischemiareperfusion injury and other models of inflammation-induced vascular leakage 99,100 by increasing endothelial tight junction integrity; thus, it may be a viable therapeutic strategy to prevent or reduce the permeability alterations associated with inflammation.",

Within minutes neutrophils are recruited into the tissue, in which they are activated to release products that not only are lethal to pathogens and proinflammatory but also may damage host cells and tissues. 101 Not surprisingly, a great deal of attention has been paid to the role of neutrophils in the pathophysiology of many inflammatory conditions. 102 Neutrophil depletion is protective in many models of gastrointestinal inflammatory disease. Of interest to clinicians, blockade of neutrophil migration into inflamed tissues prevents many of the pathophysiologic events associated with infectious enteritis, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and other gastrointestinal diseases. 98, [103] [104] [105] [106] Neutrophil transendothelial migration is a multistep process that is temporally and spatially regulated and has a degree of cell type specificity ( Fig. 12.1 ). The predominant sites of neutrophil transendothelial migration are in the postcapillary venules and, in some tissues, capillaries. Endothelial cells in these vessels respond to cytokines and other soluble signals by expressing molecules that promote neutrophil adhesion and transmigration, including selectins and counterreceptors for integrins. As neutrophils flow through these vessels, they are first tethered to activated endothelium. Tethering is mediated by selectin molecules expressed on neutrophils (L-selectin) and on activated endothelial cells (P-and E-selectins), which bind to PSGL-1, ESL-1, and other mucin counterreceptors. 107 , 108 The function of tethering is to increase the exposure of the neutrophil to activating chemokines presented on the surface of the endothelial cells.",

Endothelial cells stimulated by inflammatory mediators produce chemoattractants (such as IL-8) and display adhesion molecules that promote neutrophil emigration. The three steps of neutrophil (polymorphonuclear [PMN]) emigration capture/rolling (mediated by selectins), adhesion (mediated by \u03b2 2 integrins), and transendothelial migration (mediated by integrins and platelet/endothelial cellular adhesion molecule) occur on activated endothelium. Chemoattractant molecules such as IL-8 trigger neutrophil emigration. In inflamed tissues cytokines (IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1) and a variety of other proinflammatory mediators stimulate the neutrophil oxidase complex to produce reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs; O 2 \u2212 and H 2 O 2 and their derivatives). Activated neutrophils degranulate to release proteases and other hydrolases, cationic peptides (defensins), myeloperoxidase, and other products into the tissue. Activated neutrophils synthesize a variety of inflammatory mediators, including prostaglandins (PGE 2 ) that modulate the inflammatory response. The products of activated neutrophils (ROIs, proteases, and mediators) stimulate epithelial secretion and alter tight junction permeability, promoting diarrhea. Neutrophils eventually migrate across the infected epithelium by a mechanism that involves integrins, disrupting tight junction integrity and increasing permeability to bacterial products, thus exacerbating the inflammatory response. cells in inflamed mucosa. Integrin ligation to ICAMs arrests the tethered neutrophils, resulting in firm adhesion to the endothelium. Of the integrins expressed on neutrophils, the \u03b2 2 -integrins have a particularly important role in transendothelial migration. Calves and people with the disorder leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) illustrate the requirement for \u03b2 2 -integrin-mediated adhesion in neutrophil function. LAD is a result of an autosomal recessive trait resulting in the lack of the \u03b2 2 -integrin expression. The neutrophils from affected individuals cannot migrate into most tissues and do not function normally, resulting in poor tissue healing and profound susceptibility to infection, especially at epithelial barriers. 109, 110 Other integrins also have a role in transendothelial migration. \u03b2 1 -Integrins mediate transendothelial migration in some cells and seem to be particularly important for mediating emigration of monocytes into many tissues. 111 Following this firm adhesion step, neutrophils migrate through the endothelium along a chemotactic gradient of IL-8 and other chemoattractants, such as C5a and leukotriene B 4 (LTB4). 82, 97, 112 Neutrophils migrate across the endothelial monolayer at intercellular junctions by way of a mechanism involving a series of integrin-ligand interactions mediated by both \u03b2 2 -and \u03b2 1 -integrins and other adhesion molecules, 108 which is generally capable of maintaining the integrity of the endothelial barrier. 113 However, a massive flux of neutrophils through the endothelium alters endothelial tight junctions and injures the basement membrane, resulting in increased endothelial permeability to molecules as large as plasma proteins and even endothelial cell detachment from the basement membrane. 96, 97 Nonintegrin molecules such as platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecules (PECAMs) also are involved in transendothelial migration of neutrophils. 108 Homotypic binding of PECAMs on adjacent endothelial cells form part of the intercellular junction. Neutrophils express an integrin of the \u03b2 3 -family that can bind PECAMs, and through sequential binding of \u03b2 3 -integrins to PECAMs, the neutrophil can \"unzip\" the intercellular junction and migrate through, closing it behind itself.",

The changing composition of the matrix proteins deposited in tissues during inflammation serves as a clue as to the nature of the tissue environment for recruited inflammatory cells as they become activated. Individual gene expression studies have demonstrated that adhesion to matrix proteins induces the expression of cytokines and chemokines and their receptors, arachidonic acid-derived lipid mediator synthases, metalloproteinases, growth factors, transcription factors, and other genes that influence the differentiation and activation of inflammatory cells. 115 ROI production, phagocytosis, degranulation, and other effector functions stimulated by inflammatory mediators and bacterial products are optimal only when neutrophils are adherent to the ECM. 114 Adhesion to distinct ECM proteins selectively activates signaling pathways and gene expression of neutrophils, monocytes, and other leukocytes with differing abilities to promote certain functions such that the composition of ECM in many ways controls the development of the ultimate effector phenotype. Thus integrin-mediated adhesion provides a mechanism in which neutrophils and other leukocytes can sense the complex tissue environment and respond appropriately.",

These fragments, termed anaphylatoxins, have potent effects on tissues and cells during inflammation. Perhaps most notably, they are chemotactic for neutrophils (particularly C5a), activate neutrophil and mast cell degranulation, and stimulate reactive oxygen metabolite release from neutrophils. 130 The termination of the complement cascade results in the formation of a membrane attack complex in membranes at the site of complement activation. If this occurs on host cells such as endothelium, the cell may be irreversibly injured. Although the primary source of complement is plasma, epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract also produce C3, suggesting that local production and activation of the complement cascade during inflammation occurs in intestinal tissues.",

However, there is a limit above which neutrophil migration alters the permeability characteristics of the endothelium. The effect is in part physical in that the mere movement of large numbers of neutrophils through the endothelium is sufficient to mechanically disrupt the tight junctions and in part because of toxic products of neutrophils that damage endothelial cells and basement membranes. 141, 145 Serine proteases (particularly elastase) and metalloproteinases released by degranulating neutrophils liquefy tissue matrix proteins and cleave cell-surface proteins that make up endothelial intercellular junctions to ease neutrophil migration to the site of infection. 101 These degradative enzymes are particularly damaging to basement membranes and the cellular barriers of the endothelium, thus contributing to vascular permeability (and local tissue edema) and thrombosis. The permeability may be affected to the extent that not only water but also macromolecules (e.g., albumin, matrix proteins, complement) leak into the interstitium. Blockade of neutrophil adhesion to endothelium with anti-\u03b2 2 -integrin antibodies has a sparing effect on the microvasculature in experimental intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury, reducing the alterations in vascular permeability and histopathologic evidence of microvascular damage. 141 Similar to the endothelium of inflamed tissues, massive neutrophil transmigration occurs across the epithelium in response to infection or injury. Neutrophil transepithelial migration increases epithelial permeability by disrupting tight junctions. 145 Like the endothelium, neutrophils disrupt the epithelial barrier mechanically as they migrate through (see Fig. 12 .1). Proteases, particularly elastase, degrade basement membrane components and tight junction proteins. Protease activated receptor-2 activated by neutrophil granule serine proteases alter epithelial and endothelial tight junction integrity. Proinflammatory products of activated neutrophils (TNF\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3) increase tight junction permeability by direct effects on enterocytes. Prostaglandins released by activated neutrophils stimulate epithelial secretion, thus contributing to diarrhea. Subepithelial accumulation of neutrophils can lead to deadhesion of the epithelial cells from the basement membrane and mild to severe ulceration. The physiologic result of the effects of neutrophils and their products on the epithelial barrier includes protein-losing enteropathy and absorption of bacterial cell wall constituents, which potentiates the local and systemic inflammatory responses.",

IL-4, a product of mast cells and macrophages, has been demonstrated to increase epithelial permeability. 149 Moreover, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3, products of many inflammatory cells, synergistically increase tight junction permeability. 150 Y PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF DIARRHEA Acute equine colitis causes rapid, severe debilitation and, often, death in horses. Diarrhea associated with acute equine colitis occurs sporadically and is characterized by intraluminal sequestration of fluid, moderate to severe colic (abdominal pain), and profuse watery diarrhea with resultant endotoxemia, leukopenia, and hypovolemia. 151, 152 Causes of acute colitis and therapeutic options are discussed later in this section.",

Irrespective of the underlying or initiating cause of colonic injury, the colon apparently has a limited repertoire of responses to damage because most forms of colitis demonstrate similarities in histopathologic appearance and clinical presentation. Various degrees of mucosal erosion and ulceration, submucosal/mucosal edema, goblet cell depletion, and the presence of an inflammatory cellular infiltrate within the mucosa and submucosa are common to many types of human and animal colitis. 163, 164 Characteristic clinical manifestations include intraluminal fluid sequestration; abdominal discomfort; hypovolemia; and most often profuse, watery diarrhea.",

Loss of fluid by the large intestine can result from malabsorptive or hypersecretory processes and is often a combination of the two. 165 Colonic secretory processes are a function of the crypt epithelium, whereas absorptive processes are limited to surface epithelial cells. 166, 167 Under normal baseline conditions, an underlying secretion by crypt epithelium is masked by a greater rate of surface epithelial cell absorption. Abnormal forces influencing the rates of secretion and absorption can result in massive, uncontrolled secretion and malabsorption by large intestinal mucosal epithelial cells, leading to rapid dehydration and death. [165] [166] [167] Two intracellular processes control colonic secretion: the cyclic nucleotide (cAMP and cyclic guanosine monophosphate [cGMP]) and the calcium systems. 168, 169 Agents may activate adenyl cyclase (vasoactive intestinal peptide, prostaglandin E2 [PGE 2 ]) or guanylyl cyclase (bacterial enterotoxins) and induce increases in cAMP or cGMP, respectively. This reaction causes phosphorylation of specific protein kinases that induce the actual apical and basolateral membrane transport events. Increases in intracellular free calcium may arise from cyclic nucleotide-dependent release of stored calcium within the cell or from increased calcium entry across the cell membrane.

[176] [177] [178] The epithelial cell chloride secretory response occurs via prostaglandin-mediated and adenosine-mediated increases in cellular cAMP, whereas histamine acts by H 1 receptor induction of phosphatidylinositol turnover, production of inositol triphosphate, and mobilization of intracellular calcium stores. 170 Lipoxygenase products (leukotrienes) are capable of activating a colonic secretory response and do not appear to involve the cyclic nucleotides or calcium ions. 176 Phagocytederived reactive oxygen mediators (ROMs) can induce colonic electrolyte secretion in vitro, suggesting that oxidants may contribute directly to the diarrhea associated with colitis. 179 Reactive oxygen species initiate the secretory response by increasing cellular cAMP or stimulating mesenchymal release of PGE 2 or prostacyclin, which in turn stimulates the epithelial cell or enteric neuron, respectively. [179] [180] [181] [182] Sodium nitroprusside, an exogenous source of nitric oxide, stimulated an increase in chloride secretion in rat colon that was mediated by COX products and enteric neurons. 183 ",

Engagement of any of several receptor and nonreceptor types including phagocytosis mediators, chemotactic agents, various cytokines, and microbial products can stimulate phagocytes. 161 Resident phagocytes or those recruited to colonic mucosa early in the disease process are considered to augment mechanisms causing fluid and electrolyte secretory processes, a so-called amplification process. 104, 186 Activation of the respiratory burst results in the production and release of large amounts of superoxide anion (O 2 \u2212 ) and H 2 O 2 . 187 In addition to these ROMs, activated phagocytes secrete peroxidase enzyme (myeloperoxidase from neutrophils and eosinophil peroxidase from eosinophils) into the extracellular space. The peroxidases catalyze the oxidation of Cl \u2212 by H 2 O 2 to yield HOCl, the active ingredient in household bleach products. The peroxidase-H 2 O 2halide system is the most cytotoxic system of the phagocytes; HOCl is 100 to 1000 times more toxic than O 2 \u2212 or H 2 O 2 . HOCl is a nonspecific oxidizing and chlorinating agent that reacts rapidly with a variety of biologic compounds including DNA, sulfhydryls, nucleotides, amino acids, and other nitrogen-containing compounds. It reacts rapidly with primary amines to produce the cytotoxic N-chloramines. The mechanisms by which these substances damage cells and tissue remain speculative, but possibilities include direct sulfhydryl oxidation, hemoprotein inactivation, protein and amino acid degradation, and inactivation of metabolic cofactors of DNA. 188 Luminal perfusion of specific ROMs increased mucosal permeability, and serosal application caused increases in Cl \u2212 secretion in vitro. 189 Tissue myeloperoxidase activity, an index of tissue granulocyte infiltration, is used experimentally to assess intestinal inflammation. 190 Myeloperoxidase activity is elevated in acute flare-ups of human inflammatory bowel disease and various animal models of acute colitis. [190] [191] [192] The acute inflammatory response in these conditions is characterized predominantly by neutrophils, although this assay measures total hemoprotein peroxidase, which includes monocyte and eosinophil peroxidase in addition to neutrophils. 193 Moreover, levels of peroxidase activity in equine circulating eosinophils are greater than in circulating neutrophils, 194 and this may apply to resident tissue eosinophils as well.",

Fibroblasts cocultured or juxtaposed to colonic T84 cells greatly increased the Cl \u2212 secretory response to H 2 O 2 in vitro through the release of PGE 2 . 180 In addition, equine colonic mucosa has an increased sensitivity to endogenously released prostaglandin by exhibiting a significant secretory response under in vitro conditions. 198 194, 198 The intact bowel forms an effective barrier to the transport of significant amounts of these highly antigenic toxins, but the diseased gut absorbs these macromolecules in large amounts, causing the subsequent adverse systemic effects that are often life-threatening. 199 A complete review of endotoxemia is presented later in this chapter. Endotoxins trigger mucosal immune cells and subsequent release of inflammatory mediators in cases of colitis. In vitro studies on the effects of endotoxin on intestinal water and electrolyte transport in adult male rats showed a significant decrease in net colonic sodium absorption and increased colonic permeability. 200 In horses, endotoxin negatively affects gastrointestinal motility, including in the cecum and right ventral colon, and perfusion. 201",

However, combined IgA and IgM deficiencies with a higher incidence of intestinal disease occur. A selective deficiency of secretory IgA has been associated with intestinal candidiasis in other species. Certain mucosal pathogens may enhance their pathogenicity by producing IgA proteases. 202 Acquired immunodeficiency or immunosuppression in adults can result from infectious diseases (particularly viral), nutritional deficiencies, aging phenomena, and drugs (corticosteroids, azathioprine, and cyclophosphamide).

            "text": "Disturbances in motility patterns occur during inflammatory diseases of the colon, but the role of motility alterations in the pathogenesis of diarrhea remains unclear. Invasive bacteria cause characteristic motor patterns in the colon consisting of rapid bursts of motor activity that appear to decrease transit time through the large intestine. The result is reduced clearance of bacteria from the large intestine, which may contribute to the virulence of the organism. 213 Absorption of endotoxin and the release of inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins disrupts the motility patterns of the large intestine, resulting in less coordinated contractions, and may contribute to the alterations in motility seen with invasive bacteria. Although the effect of endotoxin and prostaglandins on transit time is not profound, the disruption of coordinated activity may play a role in causing diarrhea. 214 Thorough mixing and prolonged retention time of ingesta are important not only in microbial digestion of nutrients but also in absorption of microbial byproducts and fluid. 171 The ingesta is viscous and therefore must be mixed to bring luminal ingesta in contact with the mucosa for absorption. In addition, poor mixing increases the thickness of the unstirred layer, decreasing contact of ingesta with the mucosa and decreasing absorption. 171 Progressive motility must be present, however, if a diarrheal state is to occur. 171 Ileus may be accompanied by increased fluid in the lumen of the large intestine, but without progressive motility the fluid is not passed. Acute colitis is often associated with a period of ileus characterized by scant stool, which may be the reason for signs of colic in the early stages of colitis. Diarrhea is apparent only when motility returns. Increased progressive motility has been suggested to contribute to diarrhea by decreasing transit time; this is thought to play a role in irritant catharsis and in the mechanism of action of some laxatives. 3 Endotoxemia Endotoxemia is literally defined as the presence of endotoxin in the bloodstream. Most often, however, the term is used to refer to the associated clinical manifestations caused by an excessive and unbalanced inflammatory reaction. Endotoxemia is not a disease in its own right; rather, it is a complication of many septic and nonseptic disease processes affecting horses and other animals. Its diagnosis and management must therefore be discussed in the context of underlying primary pathologic conditions. In its pathophysiologic consequences the innate immune response to endotoxin (LPS) is similar to the response to other stimuli (e.g., bacterial infection, viral infection, severe trauma). Moreover, the clinical presentation and clinical pathologic abnormalities of patients suffering from severe systemic inflammation are consistent regardless of the etiologic cause, and outcome may be predicted more accurately by the severity of the inflammatory response than the nature of the inciting insult. 215 In 1992, therefore, the term systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) was introduced in a consensus statement of chest physicians and critical care physicians to account for these similarities and provide a case definition for clinical and research purposes. Fairly soon thereafter, however, the 1992 SIRS definition was criticized as being too sensitive while providing little specificity, 216 and its usefulness for clinical practice was challenged because it failed to predict outcome and to discriminate patients at a high risk of morbidity and mortality. 217 The definition of SIRS may therefore be valuable from a conceptual standpoint, but it has little value in daily clinical practice.",

Synthesis of a minimal core is essential for the survival of bacteria, 223 and the smallest naturally occurring LPS structure consists of lipid A and KDO. 224 In contrast to the S-form colonies, colonies of gram-negative bacteria with LPS molecules that lack the O-specific chain but contain a core region show a rough appearance on culture plates. Rough LPS molecules are denoted further as Ra, Rb, and so on to indicate the length of the core region. In Re-LPS (also called deep rough LPS), the core region is reduced to a KDO residue. Re-mutants often are used to raise antibodies against the core region in an attempt to provide cross-protection against a variety of bacterial species. The lipid A portion, which serves to anchor the LPS molecule in the bacterial outer membrane, has been identified as the toxic principle of LPS, 225 and its structure is highly conserved among gram-negative bacteria. The common structure shared by lipid A molecules is a 1,4\u2032-bisphosphorylated \u03b21,6linked d-glucosamine disaccharide backbone (lipid A backbone), which is acylated by up to six fatty acids. 220 Fig. 12.4 shows the acylation pattern for Escherichia coli LPS.

Depending on the nature of the underlying disease, these bacteria may circulate in the bloodstream in their intact form (i.e., bacteremia), may be confined to a localized infectious process, or may be part of the endogenous bacterial florae colonizing the gastrointestinal tract. In any of these scenarios endotoxin molecules are released as a byproduct of bacterial growth and in large numbers on bacterial cell death. 226 Common infectious conditions associated with endotoxemia in horses include neonatal gram-negative sepsis, bacterial pneumonia and pleuropneumonia, endometritis, peritonitis, and infectious colitis with bacteria such as Salmonella spp. that are not part of the normal intestinal florae. In one study, for example, endotoxin was detectable in plasma of 50% of foals evaluated for presumed sepsis. 227 The term translocation describes entry of endogenous bacteria and bacterial products from the gastrointestinal tract into tissues and the systemic circulation. 228 The natural intestinal flora of horses consists mainly of gram-negative, anaerobic bacteria; thus, large amounts of endotoxin normally exist in the lumen of the equine intestinal tract. 229 Even in healthy horse small amounts of endotoxin probably cross the intact mucosal barrier and reach the portal circulation and the liver. 230 These molecules are cleared, however, by the mononuclear phagocytic system in the liver and lead only to a localized and restricted activation of the host immune system. For endotoxin translocation to become detrimental, excessive amounts have to cross the intestinal barrier and overwhelm the mononuclear phagocytic system, or the capacity of the liver to detoxify LPS must be compromised. The latter may be a concern in conditions such as hepatitis, cholangiohepatitis, or portosystemic shunting of blood.",

Colic patients are prime candidates for developing endotoxemia, and plasma endotoxin was detectable in 10% to 40% of colic patients on admission. 231, 232 The studies differed in their inclusion criteria, and the higher percentage of horses testing positive for plasma endotoxin was observed when only patients presenting for surgical intervention were evaluated. 232 Aside from gastrointestinal rupture, increased permeability to intact bacteria or free endotoxin molecules is thought to be associated most commonly with ischemic insults such as strangulating obstruction and bowel infarction; severe inflammation, as in proximal enteritis and colitis; bacterial overgrowth; and intraluminal acidosis, which occurs with grain overload. 233, 234 One study, however, found no difference in plasma endotoxin detection among disease groups, emphasizing the fact that any disease of the abdominal cavity can induce endotoxemia in horses. In the same study endotoxin was approximately three times more likely to be detected in PF as opposed to plasma samples. Similarly, higher cytokine concentrations have been measured in PF than in plasma. The likely explanation for these findings is a local inflammatory response in the peritoneal cavity elicited by translocated bacteria or LPS molecules before their absorption into the systemic circulation. 231 Although gastrointestinal disease is likely the most important cause of endotoxin translocation in horses, other conditions may also result in translocation of endotoxin and bacteria. In experimental studies using laboratory animals, entry of gut-associated bacteria into the lymphatic system was demonstrated after hypovolemic shock, burn injuries, trauma, malnutrition, and starvation. [235] [236] [237] Furthermore, endotoxin itself caused bacterial translocation into mesenteric lymph nodes after intraperitoneal administration to mice. 238 These findings have received much attention in the literature concerning human patients because they serve to explain cases of endotoxic shock in the absence of demonstrable bacterial infection. The veterinarian should keep in mind the possibility of translocation when evaluating cases of presumed SIRS in horses, in which bacterial infection or gastrointestinal disease cannot be demonstrated. Endotoxin translocation also may be associated with strenuous exercise, which results in reduced splanchnic blood flow, hypoxemia, and a higher body temperature. In fit racehorses a significantly increased mean plasma LPS concentration was found after racing, whereas anti-LPS IgG levels were decreased. Fit horses showed significantly higher anti-LPS IgG concentrations at rest than sedentary controls, suggesting leakage of small amounts of endotoxin from the intestinal lumen during training and racing. 239 A study in endurance horses demonstrated detectable LPS concentration in approximately 50% of horses, and correlation between plasma endotoxin and lactate concentration suggested that plasma endotoxin concentration may be reflective of the vigor of exercise. 240 Surprisingly, the latter study failed to show a correlation between plasma endotoxin concentration and levels of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, 240 experimentally, however, alterations in innate immune function during and after strenuous exercise in horses have been demonstrated. 241",

            "text": "The initiating event in the pathophysiology of endotoxemia is the activation of LPS-responsive cells by endotoxin, resulting in altered cellular functions and increased expression of inflammatory mediators. Immune cells such as macrophages respond to minute amounts of LPS, which usually allows them to eliminate gram-negative bacteria and free LPS molecules efficiently. An important factor in the exquisite sensitivity to LPS is the presence of LPS-binding protein (LBP). 220 LBP is an approximately 60-kDa plasma glycoprotein 242 synthesized primarily by hepatocytes 243 and belongs to the family of lipid transfer/LBPs. LBP is an acute phase protein, and inflammatory agents and cytokines such as IL-1 increase LBP plasma concentration 10-to 100-fold within 24 to 48 hours of an inflammatory stimulus. 244 , 245 The main function of LBP is to transfer LPS to endotoxin-responsive cells, which include mononuclear phagocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and endothelial cells. The importance of a highly sensitive response to LPS for protection against gram-negative bacterial infection is demonstrated in experiments using LBP knockout micethat is, mice that lack the LBP gene and are therefore unable to synthesize LBP. Although these animals are resistant to the effects of purified LPS, they are unable to control infection with viable bacteria and rapidly succumb. 246 Despite its crucial importance for an effective host defense, LBP is not essential for LPS-receptor interaction per se, because high concentrations of LPS can activate cells in the absence of LBP. 247 Aside from its role as a catalyst of cellular activation by LPS, LBP has opsonizing activity 248 and participates in the phagocytosis of LPS by macrophages and neutrophils. 249, 250 Although phagocytosis of LPS is receptor dependent, it appears to be uncoupled from intracellular signaling events and occurs in the absence of cell activation. 251 LBP further catalyzes transfer of LPS to lipoproteins, such as high-density lipoprotein, which neutralizes LPS activity. 252 This detoxifying effect may become important when large amounts of LPS are present. A protective effect of LBP against LPS challenge and infection has been demonstrated in a murine model of septic shock, 253 and further studies investigating potential therapeutic uses of LBP are under way. More recently, LBP has also been investigated as a diagnostic and prognostic indicator in human patients, in which it may differentiate between SIRS and sepsis and predict outcome of septic patients. 245 One study investigating serum amyloid A (SAA) and LBP in horses with colic 254 found no correlation between serum concentration of LBP with outcome, type of disease process, or affected portion of the gastrointestinal tract.",

            "text": "The most important LPS receptors are cluster differentiation antigen 14 (CD14) 247 and TLR-4. 255 Both are classified as pattern-recognition receptors, 256 which means that they recognize LPS as a structural motif common to all gram-negative bacteria. CD14 is a 53-kDa protein that in its membranebound form (mCD14) is inserted into the cell membrane via a glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol anchor. 257 CD14 is expressed primarily on monocytes and tissue macrophages and to a lesser extent on neutrophils. 258 It also is found in a soluble form (sCD14) 259 that can bind to cell types lacking CD14, such as endothelial cells, and make them LPS responsive. In addition to this proinflammatory effect, high concentrations of sCD14 can sequester and neutralize LPS. 260 The amount of circulating sCD14 greatly increases during inflammation, which makes it a useful marker of acute and chronic inflammation. 258 Although CD14 is known to be crucial for cellular activation, it cannot transmit signals to the inside of the cell because it lacks a transmembrane domain. The missing link between CD14 and the cytosolic environment is a Toll-like receptor in association with the molecule MD-2. 261 The name Toll-like receptor stems from the homology of the mammalian receptor with a receptor type in Drosophila (Toll) that is important for dorsoventral orientation and immune responses in the fly. A number of Toll-like receptors have been identified in mammalian species thus far, but TLR4 appears to be the receptor subtype most important for LPS signaling. 255 The importance of CD14 and TLR4 in the cellular response to LPS has been demonstrated in a number of experiments. Mice deficient in CD14 are incapable of mounting a normal inflammatory response to LPS, 260 whereas mutation or deletion of the gene encoding for TLR4 causes LPS hyporesponsiveness. [262] [263] [264] After binding of LPS to cellular receptors, TLR4 undergoes oligomerization and recruits downstream adaptor proteins to activate intracellular signaling pathways. 265 Signaling pathways are characterized by sequential phosphorylation and activation of enzymatic activities and ultimately result in the alterations of cellular metabolism known as cell activation. A typical result of intracellular signaling is the activation of transcription factors-that is, proteins that bind to DNA and promote gene transcription. Translational mechanisms are activated in a similar manner.",

            "text": "TLR4-dependent cell signaling pathways can be differentiated according to the use of adaptor proteins that bind to the intracellular domain of TLR4. 265 The myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88)-dependent pathway results in activation of IKK (I\u03ba\u03b2 kinase) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways and ultimately in the expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes. IKK activates the well-described transcription factor NF-\u03ba\u03b2 by phosphorylating an inhibitor protein complex (I\u03baB) that sequesters and inactivates NF-\u03ba\u03b2 in the cytoplasm. On phosphorylation I\u03baB is ubiquitinated and degraded, and NF-\u03ba\u03b2 is translocated to the nucleus, in which it unfolds its activity. 266 The MyD88independent pathway, on the other hand, is activated by interaction of TLR4 with the adaptor protein Toll-IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon-\u03b2 (TRIF). Although the MyD88-independent pathway also activates MAPK and NF-\u03ba\u03b2 (in addition to a transcription factor called IRF3), this pathway primarily results in activation of type I interferons, which are important for antiviral and antibacterial responses. 265 Despite the characterization of seemingly separate and \"ordered\" pathways, one should recognize that interaction and synergy between pathways are likely to occur. Similarly, inhibitory pathways are required for regulation of the cell response and can target multiple levels of TLR4 signaling. 265 The potential manipulation of signaling pathways for therapeutic use in septic patients is under investigation.",

            "text": "Although endotoxin can exert some direct effects, cytokines are a primary mediator of LPS effects. Cytokines are glycoprotein molecules that regulate inflammatory and immune responses by acting as a signal between cells. 267 Cytokines of major interest in the pathogenesis of endotoxemia include TNF-\u03b1, the interleukins, chemokines, and growth factors such as granulocytemonocyte colony-stimulating factor. TNF-\u03b1 is thought of as the most \"proximal\" cytokine released in response to LPS. Studies corroborate this by showing that administration of recombinant TNF-\u03b1 mimics the effects of LPS 268 and that antibodies directed against TNF-\u03b1 protect against the lethal effects of endotoxin. 269 Increased plasma activity of TNF is associated with increased mortality in equine patients with acute gastrointestinal disease and in septic neonates. 231 Despite being a structurally diverse group of proteins, cytokines share several characteristics that allow them to execute their complex functions in the inflammatory response. 267 Any individual cytokine generally is produced by several different cell types, can act on different cell types, and has multiple effects on any given cell. Furthermore, cytokine effects are redundant, meaning that different cytokines can share the same effect. In endotoxemia this is particularly true for the effects of IL-1 and TNF-\u03b1. 270 Many of the biologic activities of cytokines in vivo result from synergistic or antagonistic actions involving two or more cytokines. 271 Within itself the cytokine response is highly regulated: cytokines induce or suppress synthesis of other cytokines, including their own (feedback regulation); regulate expression of cytokine receptors; and regulate cytokine activities. Additional regulatory mechanisms include the release of specific cytokine inhibitors such as soluble IL-1 and TNF-\u03b1 receptors; cytokine receptor antagonists such as the IL-1 receptor antagonist; and antiinflammatory cytokines, including IL-10, IL-4, IL-13, and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2). Glucocorticoids, which are produced increasingly in response to endotoxin, also inhibit the production of cytokines. 272 During a \"controlled\" inflammatory response, therefore, cytokine secretion is a self-limited event, whereas excessive stimulation of cytokine production can lead to the perpetuation of the inflammatory response even after the initial stimulus has been removed. Aberrations from the controlled, self-regulated inflammatory response have been described as predominantly proinflammatory (SIRS), antiinflammatory or hypoinflammatory (compensatory antiinflammatory response syndrome [CARS]), or combined (mixed antagonist response syndrome) responses. 273 That these responses may not represent a continuum in response to infection was demonstrated in a recent study investigating cytokine profiles in an experimental model of sepsis. 274 Here, increased plasma concentration of antiinflammatory mediators such as IL-1 receptor antagonist and IL-10 in the early phase of sepsis predicted early mortality almost as accurately as the typical proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6. Cytokine profiles failed to predict mortality in the later stages of sepsis, thereby suggesting that late outcome is not \"preprogrammed\" early on in the disease. A progression from proinflammatory (SIRS) to antiinflammatory (CARS), as previously proposed, could not be demonstrated. 274 The authors concluded that use of biomarkers may be helpful in determining the inflammatory status of clinical patients suffering from sepsis and that the success of treatments aimed at suppressing or stimulating immune responses may depend on the individual patient's inflammatory profile.",

This term better accounts for the observation that cellular LPS-sensing ability appears to be maintained, whereas intracellular signaling and cytokine production are modified toward an antiinflammatory rather than a proinflammatory response. 277 Aside from cytokines, a number of other molecules function as inflammatory mediators in the pathogenesis of endotoxemia, the synthesis and release of which are stimulated by endotoxin and by cytokines. These mediators include the arachidonic acid metabolites or prostanoids, PAF, oxygenderived free radicals, nitric oxide, histamine, kinins, and complement components. Table 12 .2 summarizes the origins, targets, and effects of the most important inflammatory mediators involved in the pathogenesis of endotoxemia. Fig.  12 .5 shows the pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism by COX and lipoxygenase. COX products are the prostaglandins, prostacyclin (PGI 2 ) and thromboxanes, and the lipoxygenase produces the leukotrienes. ",

Endothelial dysfunction and damage result in a decreased responsiveness to vasoactive agents (vasoplegia), increased vascular permeability, and a tendency for clot formation in the microvasculature. If the basement membrane and underlying matrix are compromised, microvascular hemorrhage can occur. Endothelial cell damage is primarily neutrophil mediated. More specifically, damage is caused by oxygen-derived free radicals, which are produced within endothelial cells through reactions involving neutrophil-derived elastase and hydrogen peroxide molecules, endothelial cell enzymes such as xanthine oxidase, and endothelial cytosolic iron. The hypochloric anion radical (HO\u02d9) is thought to be responsible most directly for endothelial cell cytotoxicity. Nitric oxide, which is produced by constitutively expressed nitric oxide synthase in endothelial cells and scavenges superoxide radicals in a reaction to form peroxynitrite, may afford protection from oxygen radical-induced endothelial cell damage. Variations in the ability to produce nitric oxide may explain why vascular beds in different organs vary in their susceptibility to neutrophil-mediated damage. 283 Excessive production of nitric oxide by an inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), however, contributes to tissue damage, and increased peroxynitrite concentrations may be responsible in part for PAF-induced increases in vascular permeability. 284 In addition to oxygen-derived free radicals, activated neutrophils release matrix metalloproteinases, which contribute to tissue damage. 272 ",

Perhaps the single most specific clinicopathologic indicator of endotoxemia is pronounced neutropenia, 286 which temporally correlates with peak plasma concentrations of TNF. 287 Neutropenia is caused primarily by margination of neutrophils in the vasculature, especially of the lungs, 288 whereas significant loss through active migration into peripheral tissues likely is limited to the presence of a localized source of infection. In fact, neutrophils exposed to endotoxin or inflammatory mediators exhibit reduced capacity to respond to chemotactic stimuli and extravasate. 288 Margination is made possible by adhesion molecules on endothelial cells and leukocytes that interact and allow sticking of leukocytes to the endothelial lining of blood vessels. The details of neutrophil margination and transmigration are reviewed in several excellent texts. 289, 290 Recent evidence demonstrates a role for TLR-4 in neutrophil margination in the lung microvasculature during endotoxemia, and suggests that activation and TLR-4 expression of endothelial cells may be more important than that of circulating neutrophils. 288 Although neutrophil activation during infections provides the body with an effective defense system against microbial invaders, margination and reduced migratory ability of neutrophils during endotoxemia results in the accumulation of activated cells at the endothelial surface. These cells are then positioned to effect endothelial injury, increase vascular permeability, and in some cases cause parenchymal cell death and organ dysfunction. 291 In addition, inhibition of transmigration deprives the body of phagocytic cells at sites of infection, resulting in reduced ability to fight bacterial infection. This latter complication of endotoxemia may have significant clinical impact, because defective neutrophil recruitment has been demonstrated at low endotoxin doses that do not yet result in tissue damage. 291, 292 In human patients endotoxemia and impaired neutrophil migration have been associated with infectious complications of surgical procedures. 291 Decreased phagocytic function and oxidative burst activity have also been suggested in sick and septic hospitalized foals, 293, 294 in which a beneficial effect of plasma transfusion on neutrophil function could be demonstrated. The mechanisms of migration inhibition during endotoxemia are incompletely understood but may include occupation of neutrophil chemotactic receptors by cytokines and complement components, resulting in an inability of activated cells to respond to a chemotactic gradient. 291 Rebound neutrophilia, which is observed frequently following episodes of endotoxemia, is caused by neutrophil release from the bone marrow reserve pool and by stimulation of myeloid cell proliferation via granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and is mediated primarily by TNF and IL-1. 270",

            "text": "The intrinsic and extrinsic arms of the coagulation cascade are activated in endotoxemia. The intrinsic pathway is initiated by activation of coagulation factor XII (HF), prekallikrein, and high-molecular-weight kininogen, which compose the contact system. 300 Although direct activation of coagulation factor XII by endotoxin has been demonstrated, 301 the extrinsic pathway likely is more important for the development of coagulopathy in endotoxemia and sepsis. 300 Activation of the extrinsic pathway depends on the interaction of coagulation factor VII with tissue factor, which is the only coagulation factor not constitutively present in blood. Tissue factor is present in subendothelial tissues and is exposed on vascular injury but also is expressed on endothelial cells and mononuclear phagocytes in response to LPS. 302, 303 Increased expression of monocyte tissue factor (also described as increased procoagulant activity) was significantly associated with coagulopathy and poor prognosis in horses with colic. 304 Furthermore, LPS-induced tissue factor expression by equine peritoneal macrophages may be associated with the development of intraabdominal adhesions. 280 Regulatory mechanisms of the coagulation cascade include tissue factor pathway inhibitor, antithrombin III (AT III) and the protein C system. 300 Protein C acts as an anticoagulant by inactivating clotting factors V and VIII and promotes fibrinolysis by inactivating plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI). 305 Protein C activation by thrombin-thrombomodulin complexes is important for the anticoagulative properties of normal endothelium, 300 and downregulation of endothelial thrombomodulin expression by TNF and IL-1 along with decreased expression of AT III and tissue factor pathway inhibitor by damaged endothelial cells contribute to the procoagulant state in endotoxemia and sepsis. [306] [307] [308] In addition, activation of vascular endothelial cells leads to a loss of prostacyclin and nitric oxide production and an increased release of thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2 ). As a result, platelets are stimulated to aggregate and release TXA 2 and PAF, further promoting clot formation. 234 The crucial step in the fibrinolytic cascade is the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, a fibrin-degrading enzyme. 300 Tissue-type (tPA) and urokinase-type (uPA) plasminogen activator are the major initiators of fibrinolysis, whereas PAI and \u03b1 2 -antiplasmin are the main regulatory components. 309, 310 TNF and IL-1 have been shown to induce the release of uPA and tPA and the synthesis of PAI. 300 Activation of fibrinolysis leads to consumption of \u03b1 2 -antiplasmin and accumulation of FDPs, which if present in high concentrations can interfere with platelet aggregation, fibrin polymerization, and thrombin formation and can promote bleeding. Additionally, FDPs mediate an increase in vascular permeability. LPS infusion in rabbits 311 and humans 312 resulted in an early increase in plasma tPA activity, followed by a later profound rise in PAI activity and fall in tPA activity. Increased plasma PAI concentrations also were found in horses with colic compared with controls. 313, 314 Although fibrinolysis may compensate initially for accelerated coagulation, its subsequent inhibition contributes to clot formation.",

Shock caused by endotoxemia is classified as distributive shock 322 and is largely initiated by vascular dysfunction in the periphery. Peripheral vascular beds are of major importance for the regulation of local tissue perfusion and affect systemic blood pressure by regulating total peripheral resistance. Normally, vascular smooth muscle tone is regulated by endothelin-1 (vasoconstriction), nitric oxide, and prostacyclin (vasodilation) released from vascular endothelial cells. 323 Detrimental effects of nitric oxide are attributable to overproduction of nitric oxide by iNOS in macrophages and other cell types, rather than endothelial-derived nitric oxide. Peripheral vasomotor effects of endotoxin manifest as vasodilation and vasoplegia and are mediated by PGI 2 , nitric oxide, and mediators such as bradykinin. Widespread vasodilation leads to vascular blood pooling, decentralization of blood flow, decreased venous return, and in effect decreased effective circulating volume and cardiac output. 322 Compensatory responses in the form of an initial hyperdynamic phase include tachycardia, increased cardiac output and central venous pressure, pulmonary hypertension, peripheral vasoconstriction, and increased peripheral vascular resistance. 322, 324, 325 The early vasoconstrictive phase corresponds to an increased serum concentration of TXA 2 , 234 but additional vasoconstrictors such as arginine vasopressin, angiotensin II, serotonin, endothelin, and norepinephrine likely are implicated in the pathogenesis of shock and organ failure. 272 With progression of disease the animal enters a stage of decompensated shock and progressive systemic hypotension, which corresponds to increased plasma concentrations of prostacyclin, PGE 2 , and bradykinin. 234, 272 Inadequate blood flow and oxygen delivery to tissues caused by hypotension are confounded by direct myocardial suppression via nitric oxide, 322 increased vascular permeability, 234 intravascular microthrombosis, and impaired tissue oxygen extraction 322 and results in progressive metabolic acidosis and inhibition of normal cellular metabolism.",

The Limulus amebocyte lysate assay is an activity assay based on the endotoxin-sensitive hemolymph coagulation cascade in the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus. In Limulus, this reaction is thought to be a defense mechanism against gram-negative infection. 326 Although frequently used as a research tool, the assay is not convenient enough to become a routine clinical test. The clinician therefore must appreciate the primary disease processes associated with a high risk of endotoxemia and rely on clinical signs and clinicopathologic data to achieve a diagnosis. In a survey of board-certified internal medicine specialists and surgeons, colitis/enteritis, small intestinal strangulation and obstruction, retained fetal membranes/metritis, grain overload, and pleuropneumonia were among the most frequently cited conditions associated with endotoxemia. 327 In some cases, endotoxemia may be the first indication of disease or may be the most overt of otherwise subtle clinical manifestations. With colitis or proximal enteritis, for example, one may detect signs of endotoxemia before the development of colic, diarrhea, or gastric reflux, which more specifically indicate the nature of the primary illness. The presence of neutropenia should always prompt the clinician to investigate causes of endotoxemia.",

            "text": "In vivo LPS challenge experiments in horses clearly show that many of the clinical signs associated with acute gastrointestinal disease and sepsis are attributable to endotoxemia. On administration of sublethal doses of LPS, the clinical response can be divided into the early hyperdynamic and the later hypodynamic or shock phases. Clinical signs during the first phase, which begins within 15 to 45 minutes after LPS administration, include anorexia, yawning, sweating, depression, evidence of abdominal discomfort, muscle fasciculations, and recumbency. Heart and respiratory rates increase, and decreased borborygmi suggest ileus. Hyperemia of the mucous membranes and an accelerated capillary refill time indicate the hyperdynamic state. 286 If large amounts of LPS are administered or if exposure is ongoing, depression worsens progressively, anorexia persists, and feces develop a diarrheic character. Signs of colic typically abate after the initial stage. Fever develops as a result of direct action of TNF on the thermoregulatory center and IL-1-induced local production of PGE 2 in or near the hypothalamus. 328, 329 Because of compromised peripheral perfusion, mucous membrane color changes to brick red or purple, a dark \"toxic\" line appears, and capillary refill time is prolonged. 286 Inadequate peripheral perfusion and compromised organ function finally characterize the hypodynamic shock phase. Body temperature may become subnormal, and the skin, especially on extremities, is cool to the touch. The arterial pulse weakens, and venous fill is decreased. Vascular endothelial damage and increased capillary permeability result in a muddy mucous membrane color and diffuse scleral reddening. Similar changes are evident in horses suffering from endotoxemia associated with natural disease. In the previously mentioned survey, 327 tachycardia, fever, abnormal mucous membrane color, and increased capillary refill time were named by most specialists as indicating endotoxemia.",

Renal failure and laminitis 327 appear to be common complications of endotoxemia in horses, and endotoxemia was identified as the only clinical condition significantly associated with the development of acute laminitis in one retrospective case-control study of horses admitted to a referral center. 330 Other potential complications include liver failure, 299 respiratory failure, colic and ischemia-induced gastrointestinal ulceration, 234 cardiac failure, and abortion in pregnant mares. 331, 332 Renal failure results from ischemic cortical necrosis and acute tubular necrosis caused by coagulopathy-induced afferent arteriolar obstruction. Clinical signs may include oliguria, anuria, or hematuria caused by renal infarction. Laminitis may lead to lameness, increased digital arterial pulsation, increased warmth of the hoof wall, and sensitivity to hoof tester pressure. The exact nature of the association between endotoxemia and laminitis is not understood, and, interestingly, experimental endotoxin infusion does not reliably induce laminitis. Studies have shown, however, that endotoxin administration decreases digital blood flow and laminar perfusion 333 coincident with increased plasma concentrations of 5-HT and thromboxane B 2 (TXB 2 ). 334 In addition, in vitro vascular reactivity of digital vessels is altered following sublethal endotoxin administration to horses. 335 In addition to the response to circulating mediators, LPS exposure also alters the production of vasoactive mediators by digital vascular endothelial cells. 336 Alterations in vascular reactivity are, therefore, likely responsible for development of laminitis in endotoxemia; however, other mechanisms may apply depending on the underlying clinical disease.",

            "text": "Serum electrolyte abnormalities primarily depend on the nature and duration of underlying disease processes and need to be evaluated individually. In human patients, gram-negative sepsis frequently is associated with hypocalcemia, more specifically a decrease in serum ionized calcium concentration. Endotoxin is thought to be a causative factor, and proposed mechanisms include acquired parathyroid gland insufficiency, dietary vitamin D deficiency, impaired calcium mobilization, and renal 1-hydroxylase insufficiency, leading to decreased 1,25-hydroxylation of vitamin D. Hypocalcemia in septic human patients was associated with hypotension and poor outcome. 337 In horses with surgically managed gastrointestinal disease, decreased serum ionized calcium concentration was a common finding and was most severe in patients with strangulating or nonstrangulating infarctions. In some horses, ionized calcium concentration decreased further throughout surgery. Treatment with calcium gluconate resulted in normalization of serum ionized calcium concentrations in all cases. 338 Septic neonatal patients are frequently hypoglycemic, which may be attributable to decreased oral intake, generally increased metabolism, glucose use by the infecting bacteria, inhibition of gluconeogenesis by endotoxin, and insulin-like activity produced by macrophages. 234 Interestingly, experimental endotoxin administration results in transient hyperglycemia in adult horses, 324 whereas profound hypoglycemia occurs in foals. 339 Because of the high incidence of coagulopathies in endotoxemic and septic patients, clinicians should consider monitoring coagulation parameters. The most significant changes can be expected with severe inflammatory disease such as colitis, 295,296 devitalized intestine as with strangulating obstruction, 296, 340 and with increased duration of disease. In 30 horses with acute gastrointestinal disease, coagulation profiles were considered normal in only two horses. 295 Although coagulation times may be shortened during the procoagulant state, commonly observed abnormalities with developing DIC include an increased concentration of FDPs and soluble fibrin monomer, prolonged prothrombin time indicative of factor VII consumption, prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time indicative of factor VIII:C and IX consumption, prolonged thrombin time, decreased AT III activity, thrombocytopenia, and decreased protein C and plasminogen activities. Fibrinogen concentration appears to reflect the acute phase response rather than coagulation abnormalities in horses and is frequently increased. 304 Some clinicians make a diagnosis of DIC if three or more coagulation parameters (specifically AT III, FDPs, platelet count, prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time) are abnormal, 340 whereas others require overt clinical signs of hemorrhage and concomitant thrombosis in addition to classic laboratory findings. 296 The prognostic value of coagulation parameters has been evaluated. 233, 296, 314 Overall, persistence or worsening of abnormalities in the face of treatment appears to be more indicative of poor outcome than alterations in any specific parameter. In one study decreased serum AT III concentration was the parameter most commonly associated with fatal outcome in mature horses with colic. 295 Hypoxemia observed in response to endotoxin infusion is thought to be caused by an increase in ventilation-perfusion mismatch rather than pulmonary edema, as occurs in human patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Pulmonary edema may occur in patients with associated sepsis or complications such as DIC. 341 ",

Recognition and close monitoring of patients at risk are crucial because doing so allows institution of timely, possibly proactive treatment, which may reverse the effects of endotoxin before the inflammatory response has developed a dynamic of its own. Unfortunately, endotoxemia can develop rapidly, and horses are exquisitely sensitive to the effects of endotoxin; therefore, many equine patients are not presented for evaluation until they have reached more severe stages of endotoxemia or shock. Prognosis and patient outcome then frequently depend on the severity of complications associated with endotoxemia. 234 Treatment of endotoxemia involves multiple aspects, and the following strategies have been proposed 342 : \u2022 Inhibition of endotoxin release into the circulation \u2022 Scavenging of LPS molecules to prevent direct effects and interaction with inflammatory cells \u2022 Inhibition of cellular activation by LPS \u2022 Inhibition of mediator synthesis \u2022 Interference with the effects of inflammatory mediators \u2022 General supportive care",

Identification of responsible microorganisms and their antimicrobial sensitivity spectrum are crucial steps toward effective therapy; however, one should not necessarily delay treatment to obtain culture results. Specimen containers with antimicrobial removal devices may be useful in cases for which initiation of treatment precedes specimen collection. Once a diagnosis is reached, correction of the primary disease process is critical. Examples are removal of devitalized sections of bowel or infected umbilical remnants, drainage of infected pleural or PF, and gastric lavage followed by administration of intestinal adsorbents in cases of grain overload. Di-tri-octahedral smectite (DTO; Bio-Sponge, Platinum Performance Inc., Buellton, CA) was shown to remove endotoxin in an in vitro assay 343 and may be useful in preventing endotoxemia of intestinal origin. Septic processes must be addressed with appropriate antimicrobial therapy, and principles of antimicrobial therapy should be followed. Regarding endotoxemia specifically, antimicrobial therapy has been suggested to increase the amount of circulating endotoxin by inducing endotoxin release on cell death of gram-negative bacteria. An in vitro study comparing endotoxin release and inflammatory mediator activity among antimicrobials commonly used to treat E. coli bacteremia in foals evaluated amikacin, ampicillin, amikacin plus ampicillin, ceftiofur, and imipenem. Although these antimicrobials showed no difference in the ability to kill bacteria, amikacin and the amikacinampicillin combination resulted in the lowest, and ceftiofur in the greatest, release of endotoxin. Endotoxin release appeared to be dose dependent in that lesser amounts were released at higher antimicrobial concentrations. 344 On the basis of these results and clinical experience, combining antimicrobial therapy with endotoxin-binding agents such as polymyxin B may be beneficial, especially when using \u03b2-lactam antimicrobials.",

The O-chain of LPS acts as a potent antigen 222 ; however, antibodies directed against the O-chain are serotype specific and cannot afford significant cross-protection against heterologous gram-negative bacterial strains. The core and lipid A region, both of which show a much higher degree of homology between LPS derived from different bacterial strains, offer a more promising target for immunotherapy. Active immunization against endotoxins has been reported for horses. Vaccination with a bacterin-toxoid vaccine prepared from rough mutants of Salmonella typhimurium or S. enteritidis protected horses against homologous and heterologous endotoxin challenge 345, 346 and carbohydrate overload. 346 Despite these encouraging results and the availability of a vaccine for use in horses (Endovac-Equi, Immvac Inc., Columbia, MO), active immunization against endotoxin does not appear to be a common practice. In comparison, passive immunization with anti-LPS antibodies is used widely. Rough bacterial mutants, most commonly J5 of E. coli O111:B4 and S. minnesota Re595, are used to immunize donor horses and subsequently prepare serum or plasma products. Proposed mechanisms of action after binding of the antibodies to LPS include steric blockade of lipid A interaction with cellular receptors and enhanced bacterial clearance by opsonization. [347] [348] [349] Studies concerning the efficacy of antibody administration in equine patients vary in their results. Beneficial effects have been described in experimental models of endotoxemia, acute gastrointestinal disease, and neonates with sepsis, 346, [350] [351] [352] [353] whereas in other studies antibodies failed to protect foals and horses against endotoxin effects. [354] [355] [356] Administration of an S. typhimurium antiserum to foals was associated with an increased respiratory rate and higher serum activities of IL-6 and TNF. 354 Various equine serum and plasma products are commercially available. An antiserum raised against the LPS core of S. typhimurium (Endoserum, Immvac Inc., Columbia, MO) is available for administration to endotoxemic horses at a recommended dosage of 1.5 mL/kg body mass. Diluting the serum 10-to 20-fold in crystalloid IV solutions, administering it slowly over 1 to 2 hours, and monitoring the patient for adverse reactions is advisable. Although the product is marketed for use in foals with failure of passive transfer, adverse effects have been reported, 354 and one should use caution when administering it to neonates. Plasma from donors inoculated with J5 (E. coli) and S. typhimurium (Re-mutant) is available under a California license (Equiplas J, Plasvacc USA Inc., Templeton, CA). The manufacturer recommends administration of at least 1 to 2 L in cases of endotoxemia. Hyperimmune plasma, which has a guaranteed minimum IgG content but does not contain specific antiendotoxin antibodies (HiGamm Equi, Lake Immunogenics, Inc., Ontario, NY; Equiplas and Equiplas Plus, Plasvacc USA Inc.,), is marketed for treatment of failure of passive transfer, and many clinicians use it to treat endotoxemia and sepsis. In addition to antibodies and protein, plasma contains active constituents such as complement components, fibronectin, clotting factors, and AT III 351 and therefore may be particularly useful in patients with endotoxemia-induced coagulopathy. Volumes of 2 to 10 mL/kg body mass of hyperimmune plasma have been recommended for use in endotoxemic patients. 272, 357 ",

The effects of polymyxin B in horses have been evaluated in different experimental models. 354, 358, 359 In an in vivo study in foals, treatment with polymyxin B at a dosage of 6000 U/kg body mass before infusion with S. typhimurium LPS resulted in significantly less severe elevations of body temperature, respiratory rate, and serum activities of TNF and IL-6 compared with untreated controls. 354 Similarly, polymyxin B treatment of adult horses given endotoxin ameliorated clinical signs and decreased plasma TNF activity. 360 In the latter study benefits of treatment were also evident at lower dosages of polymyxin B (1000 and 5000 U/kg body mass) and administration of polymyxin B 1 hour after the start of endotoxin infusion. Conversely, polymyxin B failed to ameliorate clinical signs of endotoxemia or prevent the development of coagulopathy, acidosis, lameness, and shock in experimental carbohydrate overload. 361 Adverse effects suggestive of neurotoxicity appeared after repeated administration of 5 mg/kg body mass (36,000 U/kg) and in a milder form after administration of 2.5 mg/kg body mass (18,000 U/kg). Nephrotoxicity was not observed. Currently, use of polymyxin B in equine patients is recommended at dosages of 1000 to 6000 U/kg body mass every 8 to 12 hours administered as a slow bolus. 362, 363 Treatment should be initiated as early in the disease process as possible because the beneficial effects of LPS scavenging may be limited to the first 24 to 48 hours after the onset of endotoxemia, before endotoxin tolerance develops. Adverse effects in the form of neuromuscular blockade and apnea, which necessitate slow infusion of the drug in human patients, have not been observed in horses. If treating horses with hypovolemia, dehydration, or azotemia, the clinician should attempt to improve peripheral tissue perfusion, minimize the polymyxin B dose, and closely monitor patients for nephrotoxicity. Close monitoring is also important if medications such as aminoglycoside antibiotics, which share a similar spectrum of potential side effects, are administered concurrently. Azotemic neonates are more susceptible to the nephrotoxic effects of polymyxin B than adult horses. 360 In an attempt to decrease the risk for adverse effects while preserving the LPS-neutralizing ability, a conjugate of polymyxin B with dextran has been developed. 364 In conjugated form, polymyxin B is prevented from extravasation into tissues, in which it exerts toxic effects by interaction with cell membranes. In addition, conjugation increases the residence time of polymyxin B in the circulation; therefore, it should prolong the antiendotoxic effect. The polymyxin B-dextran combination was evaluated at a total dose of 5 mg/kg body mass of polymyxin B in 6.6 g/kg body mass dextran, given 15 minutes before administration of endotoxin in horses. 365 Treatment blocked the development of tachycardia, tachypnea, fever, and neutropenia completely and prevented increases in serum concentrations of TNF, IL-6, TXB 2 (a TXA 2 metabolite), and the prostacyclin metabolite 6-keto-PGF 1 \u03b1. Although mild adverse effects in the form of tachypnea, sweating, and increased systolic blood pressure were observed, these were transient and could be prevented by pretreatment with ketoprofen. To the author's knowledge, the polymyxin B-dextran combination is not commercially available at this time.",

Results of these studies are somewhat contradictory, and detrimental effects occurred in some cases. 366 A protein receiving a great deal of attention regarding potential therapeutic efficacy is the bactericidal permeability-increasing (BPI) protein. This protein is structurally similar to LBP but is expressed exclusively in myeloid precursors of polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes. 367 BPI is stored in primary granules of mature neutrophils and during inflammation is expressed on their cell membranes and secreted into the extracellular environment. 368 BPI has an even higher affinity for LPS than LBP 369 and shows antibacterial activity specific for gram-negative bacteria. 219 Binding of BPI to the gram-negative bacterial membrane results in growth arrest and is an important factor in the antibacterial activity of intact neutrophils. Furthermore, BPI binding disrupts normal membrane organization and makes bacteria more susceptible to hydrophobic substances, including antimicrobials. 370 Experimentally, recombinant BPI protects against the toxic and lethal effects of isolated LPS and intact gram-negative bacteria, and clinical trials in human patients show promising results regarding its therapeutic use. 371 The biology and potential use of BPI in horses has not been evaluated.",

According to a study in healthy foals, dosages of ibuprofen up to 25 mg/kg every 8 hours can be given safely for up to 6 days. 397 To the author's knowledge, the COX-2 inhibitor firocoxib has not yet been evaluated critically for treatment of endotoxemia.",

Decreased production of TNF, IL-6, TXB 2 , and thromboplastin in response to endotoxin was shown in an equine ex vivo model. 402 In horses given endotoxin followed by treatment with pentoxifylline (7.5 mg/kg body mass followed by continuous infusion of 3 mg/kg/h for 3 hours), however, only minimal beneficial effects were observed. 403 Treatment significantly improved body temperature, respiratory rate, and whole blood recalcification time, but no effect was observed regarding heart rate, blood pressure, leukocyte count, plasma fibrinogen concentration, and serum cytokine concentrations. The conclusion was that benefits of treatment with pentoxifylline might be restricted to administration of high bolus doses or continuous infusion early in the pathophysiologic process. In an in vivo endotoxemia model in horses, the combination of pentoxifylline (8 mg/kg body mass) and flunixin meglumine (1.1 mg/kg body mass) had greater benefit than each treatment on its own. 404 Because of its rheologic properties (i.e., the ability to increase erythrocyte deformability and microvascular blood flow), pentoxifylline has been suggested for use in endotoxemic patients showing evidence of laminitis; however, no effect on blood flow to the hoof was demonstrated after administration to healthy horses. 405 An IV preparation of pentoxifylline is not commercially available.",

A rapid increase in total body fluid volume may be detrimental in patients with compromised cardiac and peripheral vasomotor function and may increase the severity of vascular pooling in peripheral organs. In these patients hypertonic solutions or colloids may be more appropriate means of stabilization than large volumes of crystalloid solutions. Hypertonic saline solution (7.5% sodium chloride) is the most commonly used hypertonic solution in horses and has beneficial effects in endotoxemic patients. 433 A dosage of 4 mL/kg is recommended, which should be given as a bolus infusion over 10 to 15 minutes, followed by administration of an isotonic solution to restore total body fluid volume. The clinician should use hypertonic saline with caution in patients with sodium or chloride derangements and should monitor serum electrolyte concentrations in the case of repeated administration. Failure of urination despite appropriate fluid resuscitation should result in critical evaluation of renal function. In one recent study small-volume resuscitation with hypertonic saline plus hydroxyethyl starch failed to alleviate hemodynamic responses in experimental endotoxin infusion in horses. 434 Plasma is an ideal colloid and should be administered to maintain a serum total protein concentration above 4.2 g/dL. 357 To raise plasma protein concentration and colloid osmotic pressure significantly, however, horses often require large volumes of plasma (7-10 L or more in a 450-kg horse), and alternative colloids should be considered. High-molecular-weight polymers are thought to provide superior oncotic effects in cases of sepsis and endotoxemia, when vascular permeability is increased. Hetastarch, or hydroxyethyl starch (Hespan), is commercially available as a 6% solution in 0.9% sodium chloride. Hetastarch molecules have a very high molecular weight, and degradation must occur before renal excretion. 435 These properties result in a longer plasma half-life and prolonged oncotic effects compared with other colloids; persistence of the oncotic effect for 24 hours was observed in hypoproteinemic horses. 436 A dosage of 5 to 15 mL/kg given by slow IV infusion along with an equal or greater volume of crystalloid fluids has been recommended. 435, 437 In human patients prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, decreased factor VIII activity, and decreased serum fibrinogen concentration have been described in association with hetastarch use. 438 In the limited number of equine studies, bleeding times were not affected 439, 440 ; however, patients treated with hetastarch should be monitored for coagulopathy.",

A procoagulant state with shortened bleeding times or prolonged bleeding times caused by consumption of clotting factors may be evident. One should address abnormalities in the coagulation profile as early as possible but especially if they persist more than 24 hours after initiation of therapy. Because of the complex interactions of coagulation and fibrinolysis during endotoxemia, it might be necessary to combine anticoagulant therapy with the administration of fresh frozen plasma to replace clotting and fibrinolytic factors. Heparin acts as an anticoagulant by activation of AT III and subsequent inhibition of thrombin, release of tissue factor pathway inhibitor from endothelial cells, and inhibition of platelet aggregation. 444 Because endogenous AT III levels frequently are decreased in patients with coagulopathy, the addition of heparin to fresh frozen plasma may be the most effective route of administration. An initial dosage of 100 IU/kg body mass followed by 40 to 80 IU/kg body mass thrice daily has been recommended. 357 Anemia caused by erythrocyte agglutination occurs in some patients during therapy with unfractionated heparin 445, 446 but typically resolves within 96 hours if therapy is discontinued. 357 Because of the risk of microthrombosis associated with erythrocyte agglutination, use of low-molecular-weight heparin (50 IU/kg body mass subcutaneously [SC] every 24 hours) has been recommended 447 but may be cost prohibitive. Aspirin can be given orally (10-20 mg/kg body mass every 48 hours), which irreversibly inhibits platelet COX activity, to inhibit platelet aggregation and microthrombosis. Platelet hyperaggregability has been implicated in the pathogenesis of carbohydrate-induced laminitis, 448 and heparin and aspirin have been recommended to prevent the development of laminitis. In an in vitro study, however, aspirin did not inhibit endotoxin-induced platelet aggregation. 449",

            "text": "In most cases, an underlying etiology cannot be determined. In some cases, Salmonella spp. or Clostridium spp. can be isolated from culture of gastric reflux. Salmonellosis has never been consistently identified in a majority of cases, and many horses with documented infections by these organisms do not develop DPJ. Alternatively, toxigenic strains of C. difficile were isolated from the reflux of five of five horses with DPJ and none of six control horses with other causes of nasogastric reflux. 463 To the author's knowledge, such an association has not been identified in other geographic locations. Another suspected infectious agent is Fusarium spp. 464 Alteration of the gastrointestinal microflora caused by recent dietary change has been suggested as a predisposing cause for DPJ; in one report, horses with DPJ were fed significantly more grain and were more likely to have grazed pasture, relative to horses with other forms of colic, but these associations were not deemed strong enough to allow clinical differentiation. 465 Two intracellular processes control intestinal secretion: the cyclic nucleotide (cAMP and cGMP) and calcium systems. 169 Inflammatory mediators, microorganisms, and toxins can activate adenyl cyclase (vasoactive intestinal peptide and PGE 2 ) or guanylyl cyclase (bacterial enterotoxins) and induce increases in cAMP and cGMP, respectively. This reaction causes phosphorylation of specific protein kinases, which induce the actual mucosal membrane transport events. Increases in intracellular free calcium may arise from cyclic nucleotide-dependent release of stored calcium within the cell or from increased calcium entry across the cell membrane. Calcium may act through calmodulin, which then can activate membrane-phosphorylating protein kinases. The net effect is increased movement of sodium and chloride into the mucosal cell from the interstitium, with secretion of sodium and chloride into the intestinal lumen. Water follows the directional flux of sodium and chloride through highly permeable intercellular spaces. Several bacterial toxins and endogenous mediators can cause active secretion and contribute to a synergistic mucosal secretory response. Passive secretion of protein-rich fluid into the lumen occurs after damage to the mucosal epithelium, capillary endothelium, and submucosal inflammation in the proximal small intestine. The clinically relevant events that result from active and passive fluid secretion are proximal small intestinal distention and nasogastric reflux, dehydration, and circulatory shock. 466 The concentration of protein in the PF from horses with DPJ is usually higher than in horses with small intestinal obstruction. A disproportionate increase in total protein concentration relative to nucleated cell count occurs, probably by leakage of blood or plasma into the peritoneal cavity without a significant stimulus for leukocyte chemotaxis. Suggested mechanisms for increased abdominal fluid protein concentration include serositis associated with inflamed intestine and small intestinal distention causing passive congestion and increased capillary hydrostatic pressure of visceral peritoneal vessels. 467 Small intestinal ileus is another hallmark sign of DPJ, and the pathophysiology is complicated, involving primary and secondary dysfunction of the central, autonomic, and ENSs and their purported roles in governing intestinal motility. Further detail regarding the effect of inflammation on small intestinal motility is provided in Inflammatory Disease of the Small Intestine later in this chapter.",

On rectal examination the degree of small intestinal distention may be subjectively less with DPJ than with obstructive lesions, particularly following gastric decompression. Although the color and odor of gastric reflux can be similar, horses with DPJ tend to have a larger volume (\u22654-20 L with each decompressive effort) of reflux than horses with obstructive lesions.

PF analysis may be helpful in distinguishing DPJ from an obstructive lesion. The typical findings with DPJ include an increased PF protein concentration (often \u22653.5 g/dL) and a mild to moderate elevation of the peritoneal WBC count, although the count usually is less than 10,000 cells/\u03bcL; PF lactate concentration typically mirrors peripheral blood concentrations. The disproportionate increase in PF total protein compared with peritoneal nucleated cell count may be caused by leakage of blood or plasma without a marked leukotactic response. 19 The PF is usually yellow and turbid, but in severe cases, diapedesis can occur, resulting in a serosanguineous color. Strangulating lesions typically result in more severe changes in the PF. Serosanguineous PF with increased protein, lactate, and white and red blood cells is typical. Horses with intraluminal obstructions such as ileal impactions typically have grossly normal PF with a mildly elevated protein resulting from intestinal distention. 419, 460, 466 Ultrasonographic findings in horses with DPJ typically include gastric and duodenal distention and segments of small intestine containing hypoechoic to anechoic fluid. The wall of the small intestine can be normal or thickened with time. Peristalsis can be decreased, normal, or increased. Differentiation from a small intestinal obstructive lesion remains difficult. More long-standing obstructions typically result in increased wall thickness, sedimentation of ingesta within the small intestinal lumen, and distended small intestine proximal to the lesion with collapsed intestine distally.",

Total or partial parenteral nutrition may be indicated in horses that remain anorectic for more than 3 to 4 days. Parenterally administered solutions containing glucose, balanced amino acid solutions, lipid emulsions, balanced electrolyte and trace minerals, and vitamins have been administered to adult horses with small intestinal ileus or enterocolitis. Based on a small number of horses, this therapy has proved promising in terms of minimizing protein losses and decreasing the duration of illness. Postoperative parenteral nutrition ameliorates clinicopathologic evidence of starvation following small intestinal resection and anastomosis in adult horses. 471, 472 Providing for part of the nutritional requirements of the horse (8000-12,000 kcal/day) is possible with glucose-amino acid solutions, which are of moderate cost. It is reasonable to suppose that providing nutritional support to an anorectic, severely ill horse will facilitate healing and even shorten the duration of illness. Thus the overall cost of providing parenteral nutritional supplementation to horses with DPJ may be offset by quicker recovery and diminished requirements for other, expensive treatments, but further data are necessary to accurately assess this point.",

In one report of 42 mature horses with chronic weight loss, a normal OGTT (peak glucose concentration at 120 minutes >85% baseline) was not associated with abnormal small intestinal morphology in any of the 5 horses in which it was documented. When peak glucose concentration was between 15% and 85% of baseline at 120 minutes (considered partial malabsorption), approximately 72% had small intestinal infiltrative disease, and when peak concentration at 120 minutes was less than 15% above baseline (total malabsorption), all had severe small intestinal infiltrative disease. 59 Other reports have documented horses with flat OGTT curves that subsequently showed more normal OGTT responses and resolved clinical condition. 492 Carbohydrate absorption tests probably have poor diagnostic sensitivity to detect small intestinal involvement in horses with chronic diarrhea and predominantly large intestinal problems. 493 An abnormal absorption test and weight loss can occur in the horse as a transient event and without significant morphologic changes in the small intestine.",

One study demonstrated a progressive decline in mean peak xylose concentration after 70% distal small intestinal resection in ponies despite their normal clinical appearance and absence of diarrhea. 497 In another study, a similar decline in peak xylose concentration following extensive (\u226560%) small intestinal resection was accompanied by weight loss, diarrhea, and ill thrift. 498 Peak xylose concentrations were much lower in horses with granulomatous enteritis than those with eosinophilic granulomatosis (EG), whereas in EG the absorption curve shifted to the right, with the peak occurring at 240 minutes. 499 This is not surprising given the typical lesion distribution with these disorders.

Despite the progressive nature of lymphomata, onset of clinical signs can be rapid, and the animal may become acutely ill. As with all adult cases of CIBD, antemortem diagnosis is by a process of exclusion and usually is confirmed postmortem. Frequent abnormalities include anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutrophilia or neutropenia, and hypoalbuminemia with hyperglobulinemia, resulting in either a normal elevated serum protein. Lymphocytosis is rare. Intraabdominal masses such as enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes may be palpated per rectum. Abdominocentesis and rectal biopsy can provide a diagnosis but are not sensitive indicators of disease. Carbohydrate absorption tests usually reveal partial to total malabsorption indicative of the severely reduced surface area resulting from significant villous atrophy and the extensive mucosal or transmural infiltration. Confirmation of a diagnosis requires exploratory laparotomy to obtain multiple intestinal and lymph node biopsies if rectal biopsy and/or abdominocentesis are normal. Prognosis is poor, especially because most horses are presented in an advanced state of disease.

Case reports from many countries revealed a predominance of Standardbred over Thoroughbred horses by three to one. 499, 505 Some of the Standardbreds were related, implicating a genetic predisposition, but this has not been proven. Prevalence of this disease is low. The condition is sporadic and has an insidious onset, and the course can be protracted. Significant diagnostic features include anemia, slight increases or decreases in WBC counts, hypoalbuminemia, normal serum protein or hypoproteinemia, occasional increases in serum AP activity, normal serum GGT activity, and enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes on rectal palpation. Partial or complete malabsorption is typically documented via carbohydrate absorption testing. One can attribute the low proportion of horses exhibiting diarrhea to the preferential distribution of inflammatory infiltration in the small intestine. 506 Rectal biopsy can be a useful aid to diagnosis. 489 The cause of granulomatous enteritis is unknown. Several infectious agents have been implicated, including Mycobacterium avium. 507 The condition may represent a granulomatous hypersensitivity reaction. Immunomediated responses to dietary, parasitic, or bacterial antigens may be important initiating factors. 488 Six horses purported to have granulomatous enteritis were linked to environmental contamination with aluminum, 508 although problems existed regarding the case definition, data, and interpretation. 509 Treatment of horses with granulomatous enteritis with a variety of drugs, particularly corticosteroids, has not affected the long-term outcome in the majority of cases. 510 Prolonged (5 months) corticosteroid administration produced clinical remission and a favorable athletic outcome in a 6-year-old Standardbred gelding based on improvement in clinical signs and in d-xylose absorption. 500 Surgery may be indicated with localized disease. Two young horses underwent resection of the thickened terminal small intestine; one horse died 4 months after surgery, and the other remained clinically normal for at least 10 years. 505",

L. intracellularis preferentially infects proliferating cells; thus, it is the tropism for the crypt epithelium. Infected cells proliferate far more rapidly than uninfected cells, suggesting that L. intracellularis directly induces the proliferative response, but the molecular basis for enhanced proliferation is not known. L. intracellularis penetrates epithelial cells in a membrane-bound vesicle but eventually escapes the vacuole and is found free in the cytoplasm, concentrated at the apical pole of the cell. The gross pathologic lesions of equine PE are quite characteristic. 518 Lesions may be segmental and are most commonly found in the ileum and terminal jejunum in horses, but the duodenum may also be affected. Severe mucosal hypertrophy is often observed but may wane during the chronic stages of the disease. The mucosa may become corrugated with focal erosions or ulcers. Submucosal edema is often readily identified on cut sections of affected segments. Moderate to severe crypt hyperplasia with atrophy of intestinal villi is a consistent feature. Hyperplastic crypts are branched and may herniate into the submucosa. Necrosis, edema of the submucosal and lamina propria, hemorrhage, mononuclear inflammation, and muscular hypertrophy have been reported in affected intestinal segments but are not consistent. Special stains such as silver stain are required to detect intracellular organisms. The organisms are curved or comma-shaped rods found clustered in the apical cytoplasm of hyperplastic crypt epithelium. The proliferative response of the intestinal mucosa alters absorption of nutrients and fluid secretion by disrupting the architecture of the villi and by altering the maturation of epithelial cells into absorptive cells, accounting for the secretory diarrhea and often severe weight loss. The combined effects of the inflammatory response and malabsorption may account for the clinically observed protein-losing enteropathy.",

Not all clinical signs are present in all cases, and diarrhea has only been observed in approximately half of reported cases. Other problems often were concurrent, including respiratory tract infection, dermatitis, intestinal parasitism, and gastric ulceration. The most significant laboratory finding is profound hypoproteinemia, predominantly characterized by hypoalbuminemia; panhypoproteinemia can also occur. 518, 521, 527 Leukocytosis and hyperfibrinogenemia are also common, with occasional alterations in electrolytes (hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypochloremia) and elevated serum creatine kinase concentrations. Abdominal ultrasound commonly reveals increased small intestinal mural thickness. 521, 527 Although small intestinal mural thickness >3 mm, in conjunction with clinical and clinicopathologic signs, is highly suggestive, PE should not be ruled out in the absence of this finding. Colloid oncotic pressure, if measured, is typically low. 527 PE should be considered in a weanling foal with compatible clinical signs and severe hypoalbuminemia with exclusion of common enteric infections. Fecal PCR has very high specificity but variable sensitivity for confirmation of diagnosis. 528 Serum immunoperoxidase monolayer assay or indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are highly specific for exposure; submission of fecal PCR and serologic testing is recommended, although both tests are quite specific, because they can lack sensitivity, especially early in the course of disease (serology) or with prior antimicrobial therapy (fecal PCR). 518, 527, 529 Of note, fecal PCR can become negative in affected foals within 4 days of antimicrobial therapy. 530 PE is not typically associated with abnormal carbohydrate absorption test results. 518, 530 In horses with diarrhea, other infectious causes should be ruled out. A definitive postmortem diagnosis can be confirmed by identifying characteristic mural thickening and intracellular bacteria within the apical cytoplasm of proliferating crypt epithelial cells using silver stains, PCR, and/or immunohistochemical testing. 518 Antimicrobial therapy with erythromycin, alone or with rifampin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, oxytetracycline, doxycycline, metronidazole, or chloramphenicol has been reported. 518, 519, 527 Macrolides should not be used in adults or older foals because of an increased risk of colitis. 529 Recent reports favor the use of IV oxytetracycline, followed by oral doxycycline or minocycline, with apparent success. 519, 527 Duration of therapy is typically 2 to 3 weeks. Affected foals often need supportive therapy including crystalloid fluid and electrolyte replacement and, potentially, colloid support. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory therapy can be used as needed for significant pyrexia. Corticosteroid therapy is not indicated, because inflammation is not a significant pathologic finding. Response to therapy has been good, with reported survival rates between 82% and 93%. 518, 519, 527 Rapid improvement in clinical signs, even within 24 hours, precedes the rise in plasma protein concentration.",

Treatment should be initiated as early as possible in the course of disease.

Clinical benefits far outweigh concerns over potential adverse effects.

The therapeutic approach for horses with colitis, regardless of cause, consists primarily of controlling local and systemic inflammation, maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance, and promoting mucosal repair.

            "text": "S. enterica is a species of gram-negative facultatively anaerobic bacteria that is a common gastrointestinal pathogen in horses. Many serovars of S. enterica have been reported to infect horses, but those classified in group B appear to be more commonly associated with disease than those in other groups. Group B includes S. enterica var. Typhimurium and S. enterica var. Agona, two of the species most frequently isolated from horses. 534-536 S. enterica var. Typhimurium is the most pathogenic serotype in horses and is associated with a higher case fatality rate than other serovars of S. enterica. 534 The number of horses that are inapparently infected with and actively shed S. enterica in their feces has been reported to be as high as 10% to 20%, but actual prevalence of S. enterica shedding in the general horse population is likely to be much lower, less than 2%. 537 Horses shedding S. enterica are a potential source of infection to susceptible horses, 534, 538 as are environmental reservoirs. [539] [540] [541] For these reasons salmonellosis is one of the most common nosocomial diseases in horses. Nosocomial salmonellosis significantly affects morbidity and mortality in hospitalized horses. 542 The emergence of multidrug resistance in equine S. enterica isolates has been a cause of concern because of the importance of salmonellosis as a nosocomial disease and because a number of serovars of S. enterica are significant zoonotic pathogens. 540, [543] [544] [545] [546] The virulence of the bacteria varies tremendously with serotype and even among strains of the same serotype. This is because of the important role of host susceptibility in the pathogenicity of particular organisms. The infective dose is generally on the order of millions of organisms inoculated orally, but various environmental and host factors can reduce the infective dose to a few thousand or even hundreds of organisms. [547] [548] [549] Environmental factors or stresses that increase susceptibility to S. enterica infection are not well defined, but it is known that high ambient temperature, for example, can greatly increase the prevalence of salmonellosis in horses. 539, 548, 549 Indeed, the peak incidence of salmonellosis in horses occurs in late summer and fall. 539, 548, 549 Other environmental and host factors that are associated with salmonellosis or shedding of S. enterica organisms in feces include transportation, antibiotic administration before or during hospitalization, gastrointestinal or abdominal surgery, general anesthesia, preexisting gastrointestinal disease (e.g., colic, diarrhea), the presence of leukopenia or laminitis during hospitalization, prolonged hospital stay, change in diet, and immunosuppression. 534, 541, [549] [550] [551] Interestingly, foals with gastrointestinal disease are more likely to shed S. enterica organisms than are adult horses with gastrointestinal disease. 548 Host factors that restrict gastrointestinal colonization and invasion by pathogens include gastric pH, commensal gastrointestinal flora, gastrointestinal motility, the mucosal barrier, and mucosal immunity. 534, 552 Gastric acidity is an important defense mechanism for preventing live organisms from reaching the intestine. 552 Altering the gastric pH, with histamine H 2 receptor antagonists, for example, may increase susceptibility to infection. Gastrointestinal flora inhibit the proliferation and colonization of S. enterica by secreting bacteriocins, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and other substances that are toxic to S. enterica. 552 Elements of the normal flora compete for nutrients and space, especially on the mucosa. 552 Being predominantly anaerobic, the normal flora maintain a low oxidation-reduction potential in the environment of the large intestine, which inhibits the growth of many bacterial pathogens. 553 The importance of normal host gastrointestinal ecology is illustrated by the fact that disturbances of the colonic flora with antibiotics, changes in feed, ileus, or other underlying gastrointestinal disease markedly increases the susceptibility of the host to infection by S. enterica, often resulting in serious disease.",

            "text": "The immune status of the host may be one of the most important factors determining not only the susceptibility to S. enterica infections but also the degree of invasion and subsequent outcome of the infection. Local immunity, such as mucosal antibody secretion and enterocyte-derived cationic peptides, prevents colonization of the mucosa. 552, 554, 555 Opsonizing antibodies and activation of the complement cascade are important in fighting systemic invasion by S. enterica by increasing the efficiency of phagocytosis and by direct bactericidal activity. Humoral immunity, however, is often ineffective in preventing disease and dissemination once invasion occurs and S. enterica is established in its intracellular niche. Following invasion, S. enterica is capable of surviving and multiplying within macrophages, rendering the humoral (noncellular) immune systems ineffective. 556, 557 Specific cellular immunity may be the most effective defense mechanism in the host arsenal against dissemination and systemic infection by S. enterica. 557, 558 Protective immunity in horses and calves may be induced by oral inoculation with small numbers of virulent organisms, but the duration of the immunity is not known. 559, 560 Oral and parenteral vaccines using killed or attenuated organisms and bacterial products have been promising but are effective only against homologous organisms and are usually not cross-protective among different serogroups. [559] [560] [561] In adult horses S. enterica primarily infects the cecum and proximal colon, causing enterocolitis, with limited likelihood of dissemination beyond the intestine. In foals, however, salmonellosis is often associated with septicemia. The ability of S. enterica to cause enterocolitis depends on the ability of the bacteria to invade the gastrointestinal mucosa. 552, 556 Invasion of the gastrointestinal mucosa occurs preferentially through specialized enterocytes called M cells that overlie intestinal lymphoid tissues such as Peyer's patches in nonequine species. M cells are exploited by a variety of enteric pathogens during infection of intestinal tissue. 562 Invasion of the epithelium occurs by self-induced uptake via the apical membrane of the M cell, often killing the cell in the process. 556 S. enterica then invades neighboring cells via the basolateral membrane, eventually spreading the destruction of the epithelium beyond the principal area of attack. Virulent S. enterica have a welldeveloped invasion mechanism that involves the generation of an apparatus called a type III secretory system that enables virulence gene products to be injected directly into enterocytes. 563 Virulence proteins injected by S. enterica into enterocytes engage the cellular machinery and induce the cell to engulf the bacteria by macropinocytosis. S. enterica virulence gene products also induce enterocyte chloride and fluid secretion and upregulate enterocyte transcription of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2) and chemokines that trigger a mucosal inflammatory response. 81, 556, 563 Once S. enterica has invaded the mucosa, organisms are quickly phagocytosed by macrophages and dendritic cells in the lamina propria and in lymphoid tissues. The ability of S. enterica to disseminate systemically and cause enteric fever is associated with the ability to survive and proliferate in macrophages. Indeed, phagocytes have an important role in dissemination to blood, lymph nodes, liver, and spleen. 564 The majority of S. enterica in the blood and tissues of animals infected with a strain of S. enterica that is competent to cause enteric fever are within phagocytic cells. 564 In adult horses with salmonellosis, dissemination appears to be limited to the intestine and mesenteric lymph nodes, and S. enterica is rarely cultured from blood. However, in foals and in some adults, S. enterica causes an enteric fever-like disease with dissemination to mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and blood.",

            "text": "Specific virulence gene clusters called pathogenicity islands encoded on the chromosome or on plasmids confer the main virulence traits of S. enterica: invasion, enteropathogenesis, intracellular survival, and proliferation. 556 Some of the genes encoded within these islands or virulence factors are sensors that signal to the bacteria that it has entered an intracellular environment and to turn on other genes required for intracellular survival. Others, such as invasion genes, are transported from the bacteria and injected into macrophage cytosol by a type III secretory system apparatus to prevent phagosome-lysosome fusion and subvert other essential macrophage-killing mechanisms. Virulent S. enterica may also possess multiple genes that enable adhesion to target cells or confer resistance to reactive oxygen and nitrogen metabolites, which is, perhaps, the most lethal antimicrobial mechanisms of macrophages. 565 Diarrhea associated with salmonellosis has multiple causes. An S. enterica cytotoxin inhibits protein synthesis in mucosal cells, causing morphologic damage and altered permeability. 566 Virulent S. enterica also produce an enterotoxin that is similar to the heat-labile (LT) toxin produced by E. coli. 567, 568 This enterotoxin contributes to, but is not required, in the pathogenesis of diarrhea. 569,570 S. enterica enterotoxin increases secretion of chloride and water by colonic mucosal cells in many species, including horses, by increasing intracellular cAMP concentrations. 567, 568, 571 The ability of virulent S. enterica to cause diarrhea appears to be most closely associated with the ability to invade enterocytes and to trigger an inflammatory reaction in the intestinal tissue. 103, 556 Gene products injected into enterocyte cytosol by the type III secretory system of invading S. enterica stimulate chloride and fluid secretion. 563 S. enterica invasion of enterocytes is also a potent activator of inflammatory chemokine and cytokine production, resulting in the recruitment of leukocytes, particularly neutrophils, and activation of resident macrophages and mast cells. Products of these activated leukocytes, including prostaglandins, leukotrienes, reactive oxygen metabolites, and histamine, are potent stimulators of chloride secretion in the colon of many species. 213, 552, 572, 573 The ENS integrates the diverse processes of pathogen recognition, triggering of the inflammatory response, and induction of enterocyte fluid secretion. 213 Many of the inflammatory mediators studied stimulate colonic secretion by prostaglandin-dependent mechanisms, resulting in either increased intracellular cAMP or calcium concentrations, or both, in mucosal cells. 213 These mediators and the ENS may also stimulate secretion by prostaglandinindependent mechanisms, inhibit sodium and water absorption, cause motility disturbances, and potentiate tissue injury, all of which enhance the pathogenicity and dissemination of S. enterica and contribute to the pathogenesis of diarrhea. 213, 573 Neutrophils recruited to the mucosa by signals generated by the infected enterocytes physically contribute to mucosal injury by producing a variety of products that are lethal to pathogens but are also toxic to host cells. 84, 574 Neutrophils attracted to infected epithelial cells accumulate beneath the monolayer, lifting it off the basement membrane in sheets. Neutrophils also migrate across the epithelial monolayer in potentially massive numbers-enough to be detectable in feces as a marker of inflammatory diarrhea. Although the transepithelial migration of neutrophils has a benefit, positioning the host defense cell at the apical membrane to ward off attacks by invading bacteria, the mechanical disruption to the epithelial barrier may be significant enough to increase the permeability to macromolecules, bacterial products, and even bacteria. 574 Potentially massive losses of electrolytes, water, and protein can occur, depending on bacterial and host factors. Perhaps most devastatingly, mucosal injury and altered permeability allow systemic absorption of bacterial products and dissemination of bacteria, resulting in life-threatening sepsis.",

Aggressive treatment during the acute stages to replace fluids lost in the diarrhea and to control sepsis and endotoxemia is often effective in controlling the primary disease. Weight loss and hypoproteinemia are often severe. Possible complications include multiorgan dysfunction, vascular leak syndrome with peripheral and organ edema, laminitis, acute renal failure, venous thrombosis and septic phlebitis, irreversible protein-losing enteropathy or chronic malabsorption, pulmonary aspergillosis, and gastrointestinal infarction.

            "text": "Potomac horse fever is caused by the obligate intracellular rickettsial organism N. risticii (formerly called Ehrlichia risticii). [582] [583] [584] [585] [586] The disease is most common from late summer to early fall, with a peak incidence in July and August. 583, 584 Potomac horse fever was first described in the northeastern United States but has since been described now in most areas of the continental United States, with a particularly high prevalence in the Northeast and Midwest. The geographic distribution is characterized by a significantly higher percentage of cases found along waterways and rivers. 583 , 584 The disease occurs sporadically, both temporally and geographically, and can affect any age group of horses. The case fatality rate ranges from 5% to 30%. 583 Transmission of N. risticii has been reproduced experimentally by oral, intramuscular, intradermal, SC, and IV routes. 583, 587 Attempts to transmit the disease experimentally with ticks (Dermacentor variabilis) or biting flies (Stomoxys calcitrans) were unsuccessful. 588 [590] [591] [592] [593] Infected virgulate cercariae have been identified in aquatic snails collected in other parts of the world as well. 594 Although the trematode species infected with N. risticii remain to be definitively identified, at least two species have been identified as potential vectors, 595 and at least two potential definitive hosts were identified when N. risticii DNA was detected in the blood, liver, or spleen of 23 of 53 little and big brown bats harboring gravid trematodes in their intestinal tracts. 596 Aquatic snails release large numbers of infected cercariae into water, in which they seek their next intermediate host, which is any of a variety of aquatic insects. 593, 597 Successful transmission of N. risticii to horses was accomplished experimentally using trematode stages collected from Juga yrekaensis snails. 598 The number of PCR-positive snails in endemic regions corresponds to the seasonal incidence of Potomac horse fever and may be as high as 26%. 599 Preliminary studies suggest that N. risticii may in fact be naturally transmitted to horses through the ingestion of caddisflies and mayflies. 593 , 600 The pathogenesis of N. risticii is not completely understood. The organism infects and survives in monocytes and monocyte-derived leukocytes and can be found in blood monocytes during natural infections, but the sequence of events resulting in enterocolitis remains open to speculation. The organism appears first to infect blood monocytes in experimentally infected horses, which may be the vehicle of organ infection. 585, 601 It is unclear whether leukocytes of the monocytic lineage or epithelial cells are infected first in naturally infected horses. The target organ is the gastrointestinal mucosa, with the most severe lesions found in the large intestine. 156, 601 Infection of human colonic cells in vitro does not cause major cytopathologic effects for several days. 602 Disruption of the microvilli in the region of the plasma membrane in which sodium chloride channels are located has been observed in human colonic cell cultures. 602 Infection in horses is associated with variable degrees of morphologic damage. 156, 601 Mild morphologic damage and mononuclear cell infiltration of the lamina propria occur early during the infection, but fibrinous, necrotizing typhlocolitis with severe mucosal ulceration and inflammation of the lamina propria may occur later in the disease. Vasculitis and intravascular coagulation are consistent features in the large intestine, with perivascular edema. 156 N. risticii can be observed in mucosal cells and macrophages and mast cells of the lamina propria. 156, 601 N. risticii can survive and multiply in macrophages by inhibiting the production of ROIs and avoiding lysosomal digestion by blocking phagosome-lysosome fusion. [603] [604] [605] Some researchers have suggested that impaired sodium chloride absorption in the colon contributes to diarrhea in infected horses and may be related to destruction of the enterocyte membrane structure in the region of sodium chloride channels. 602, 606 Direct injury to the mucosa by N. risticii and colonic inflammation are likely to be prominent features leading to diarrhea, especially later in the disease. 156 Loss of fluid, protein, and electrolyte is likely caused by mucosal injury and effects on enterocyte fluid secretion caused by the inflammatory response. Like other inflammatory conditions of the colon, systemic inflammation caused by absorption of bacteria and bacterial products is a potential complication of N. risticii infections if mucosal injury is severe, which contributes to the clinical signs seen during the disease.",

Neutropenia with a left shift is a consistent feature and occurs concurrently with or soon after the onset of diarrhea. 608 Thrombocytopenia is common and often severe. 608 Neutrophilic leukocytosis occurs later in the course of the disease. Hyperfibrinogenemia is usually more pronounced than that seen with salmonellosis. Serum electrolyte, acid-base, and biochemical abnormalities are also similar to those described for salmonellosis. Coagulopathies are commonly seen during N. risticii infection and reflect activation of coagulation pathways. DIC is not uncommon and may be the cause of the high frequency of laminitis associated with N. risticii infection. 611 Diagnosis of N. risticii infection cannot be based solely on clinical signs because the disease is clinically similar to other forms of enterocolitis. In endemic areas, acute colitis is likely to be caused by N. risticii; thus, the clinical signs of acute inflammatory colitis may in fact have a high predictive value in these areas. Serologic evidence of infection, such as rising antibody titers to N. risticii detected by indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) or ELISA in paired serum samples, may be helpful in establishing a diagnosis. 584, 612 Care should be taken when interpreting the IFA serologic test for N. risticii because the test appears to have a high false-positive rate. 613 Culture of the organism from blood is possible but difficult and is generally useful only in the research laboratory. Recently developed PCR tests for N. risticii DNA are rapid, highly sensitive (as sensitive as culture), and there are specific tests for N. risticii infection that can be applied to blood or feces. [614] [615] [616] Prevention Prevention of the disease by reducing exposure to the etiologic organism is difficult because the mode of transmission is not known. A killed vaccine has been developed that is relatively effective in preventing clinical illness other than fever in 80% of experimentally challenged horses using the vaccine strain. Field studies, however, suggest the vaccine has limited benefit for preventing natural infection or decreasing its severity. 617, 618 Vaccine failures have been attributed to strain differences in antigenicity or to poor antibody responses to the vaccine. 617, 618 ",

Normal horses shed less than 100 CFU/g of feces, and usually horses with intestinal clostridiosis shed greater than 10 6 CFU/g. 619, 640 Identification of high numbers of Clostridium organisms in the feces does not prove infection as the cause of the observed clinical signs. Detection of C. perfringens toxins in feces or intestinal contents in horses with high numbers of fecal CFUs and clinical signs of enterocolitis is more conclusive evidence of an enterotoxigenic infection than that based on culture alone. 624 Immunoassays are available to detect C. perfringens enterotoxin, 624 but the reliability (specificity) of some immunoassays has come into question. PCR multiplex and gene probe assays are now available for detection of the major lethal toxins in bacterial isolates or fecal samples to determine the pattern of toxin production and are currently the preferred methods of detection.

Fourth-stage larvae migrate through the mucosa and submucosa into the arterioles of the intestine, causing mural edema, hemorrhage, and infiltration of inflammatory cells. 647, 648 Increased secretion and decreased absorption of fluid and electrolytes, stimulated by inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins and histamine, may play a role in the diarrhea induced by S. vulgaris. Interstitial edema and damage to the interstitial matrix and mucosa may occur as a result of inflammation and migration of the parasites, causing increased secretion of fluid and albumin loss. Abnormal gastrointestinal motility may also play a role in the development of diarrhea. Migration of larvae through the intestinal wall early in the course of infection affects myoelectrical activity and motility in the large intestine and may affect retention of ingesta and absorption of fluid. 649, 650 The cause of death in acute strongylosis has not been addressed, but it may be related to massive migration through the vasculature, causing thrombosis with ischemia and infarction of the intestine.",

Release of vasoconstrictive inflammatory mediators, such as leukotrienes, from platelets, neutrophils, and eosinophils, as well as elaboration of parasitic antigens or toxins, may cause vasoconstriction and ische mia. 652 Horses with experimental strongylosis had a 50% reduction of blood flow in the colonic vasculature. 653 Clearly, reduced blood flow is an important effect of chronic strongylosis, but the relationship between blood flow and diarrhea is unclear. Disrupted motility resulting from ischemia may lead to diarrhea by reducing the retention of ingesta and absorption of fluid. Acute infarction and mucosal ulceration cause severe, chronic diarrhea in naturally infected horses. 654 Release of inflammatory mediators, such as prostaglandins, histamine, and kinins, from inflammatory cells associated with thrombi and inflamed intestine may also affect secretion, absorption, and motility, leading to diarrhea.",

[659] [660] [661] [662] [663] [664] Clinical disease is caused by intramural larval stages of more than 50 species of small strongyles (cyathostomes). The cyathostome life cycle requires migration by fourth-stage larvae through the mucosa of the large intestine and may include a period of hypobiosis, during which the larvae remain encysted within the mucosal layer of the large intestine. 659 After a period of hypobiosis, the larvae emerge in response to a largely unknown stimulus. Most cases occur when larval emergence takes place, classically in the late winter and spring in the northern temperate zones and in the late fall or winter months in the southeastern United States and subtropical regions. 659 Sudden emergence of encysted larvae causes mucosal injury, ulceration, and an inflammatory reaction, which are largely responsible for the clinical disease. 659, 665 Migration of the larvae as they penetrate the mucosa affects motility patterns and can cause inflammation that may contribute to diarrhea. 659 Chronic, eosinophilic, granulomatous colitis and diarrhea with histopathologic evidence of hypobiotic cyathostome larvae in the large intestine have been reported in two horses during a period in which the emergence of larvae would not be expected to occur (early winter). 659 Natural emergence of cyathostome larvae causes fibrinous inflammation of the large intestine, focal necrosis, mural hemorrhage, and ulceration of the large intestinal mucosa, which may even result in bleeding into the lumen. 648, 665 Mild to moderate eosinophilic and mononuclear inflammation of the lamina propria is seen. 648, 665 Moderate to severe interstitial edema is frequently observed. 648, 665 Colonic inflammation and interstitial edema may contribute to diarrhea, in conjunction with the loss of the mucosal barrier, by causing increased active and passive secretion of fluid, electrolytes, and protein. Protein loss is often significant, resulting in profound hypoalbuminemia and interstitial edema of skin and other organs. Chronic granulomatous colitis has been reported to occur in response to encysted larvae and may cause diarrhea by increased secretion secondary to granulomatous inflammation or disruption of the interstitium by granulomatous infiltration. Administration of an anthelmintic to horses with a heavy load of encysted larvae may also cause rapid larval death and acute and often severe inflammation similar to natural emergence.",

[659] [660] [661] [662] [663] [664] Profound hypoalbuminemia is a characteristic feature of cyathostomiasis, manifested clinically by ventral edema. Plasma \u03b1-globulin and \u03b2-globulin concentrations may be elevated, which can result in a normal total plasma protein concentration in spite of hypoalbuminemia. [658] [659] [660] The serum IgG(T) concentration, however, has been reported to be normal, which may help distinguish cyathostomiasis from S. vulgaris infection. 659,661,662 PF analysis does not usually reveal any abnormalities, in contrast to horses with S. vulgaris infection. Fecal analysis may be unrewarding because the infection is often not patent when clinical signs are apparent. Measurement of plasma fructosamine may provide a measure of protein catabolism or protein loss in the absence of hypoalbuminemia. 667, 668 Plasma fructosamine concentrations are significantly lower in horses with experimental cyathostomiasis than in normal controls, 667,668 suggesting that this test may be a useful diagnostic tool. However, the test has not yet been validated in naturally occurring cases, and neither the specificity nor the sensitivity is known. Rectal scrapings or rectal mucosal biopsies may reveal evidence of cyathostome larvae. 659, 662 Definitive diagnosis usually requires microscopic examination of biopsy specimens of the cecum and ascending colon, collected by laparotomy. Examination of biopsy specimens collected from the small intestine is recommended to rule out other causes of weight loss and diarrhea. Appropriate diagnostic tests, such as culture of feces for pathogenic bacteria, should be included in the workup to further rule out other causes.",

            "text": "C. perfringens, C. difficile, and serovars of S. enterica are apparently the most common causes of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in horses. Outbreaks of C. difficile have been reported in hospitalized horses being treated with antibiotics. 622, 626 In Sweden accidental erythromycin ingestion has been associated with C. difficile enterocolitis in mares in which their foals were being treated for R. equi. 629, 677, 679 Tetracycline administration has been associated with an increase in the numbers of gram-negative enteric bacteria and C. perfringens in the feces of horses as well as reactivation of salmonellosis and prolongation of fecal shedding of serovars of S. enterica. 619, 680 The most common mechanism by which antibiotics cause diarrhea is disruption of the gastrointestinal flora. The normal large intestinal flora, composed of mainly obligate anaerobes and streptococci, protects the host from pathogenic bacteria by colonization resistance. 553 Ecologic factors play an important role in colonization resistance. For example, surface bacteria in the large intestine interact with receptors on the mucosal cells, facilitating adherence to the mucosa. 545, 681 In doing so, the normal organisms compete more successfully for this important niche. Competition for space and nutrients is an important means of preventing colonization and proliferation of pathogenic bacteria. 552, 553, 681 Anaerobic bacteria produce SCFAs and other metabolites that are toxic to facultative anaerobic bacteria, especially in the conditions of the large intestine. 552, 553, 681 Organisms of the normal flora produce bacteriocins that inhibit growth of potential pathogens. 552 Antibiotics that deplete the population of obligate anaerobes and streptococci efficiently decrease colonization resistance. 552 Production of fatty acids is diminished, and competition for space and nutrients is reduced. As a result, gram-negative enteric bacteria, such as S. enterica var. Typhimurium, are able to proliferate. Pathogenic anaerobes normally found in low numbers can also proliferate. Antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria, especially gram-negative enteric bacteria and possibly clostridia, may be selected by antibiotic administration, allowing proliferation of pathogenic bacteria resistant to many antibiotics. 682 Obligate anaerobic commensal organisms, perhaps the most critical group of microbes for maintaining colonization resistance, are usually susceptible to macrolides, tetracyclines, \u03b2-lactams, and lincosamides, which may explain the high incidence of diarrhea associated with the administration of these antibiotics. 624 In addition to reduction of colonization resistance, depletion of the normal anaerobic microbial population in the intestine decreases carbohydrate fermentation and production of SCFAs, which contributes to the pathogenesis of antibioticassociated diarrhea by decreasing absorption of sodium and water by the colonic mucosa. 171 Ampicillin decreases colonic fermentation of carbohydrates in humans. 683 Human patients with antibiotic-associated diarrhea have markedly impaired colonic fermentation and very low production of SCFAs. 684 Erythromycin, ampicillin, or metronidazole treatment is associated with decreased production of SCFAs in patients with and without diarrhea. 684 Absorption of sodium and water is stimulated by absorption of SCFAs in the equine colon, suggesting that reduction of colonic SCFA content by antibioticinduced depletion of anaerobic flora has similar effects in horses as in humans. 171 Broad-spectrum antibiotics exert a more profound effect on the gastrointestinal flora than narrow-spectrum antibiotics. 685 Antibiotics administered orally, especially those that are poorly absorbed, are more likely to cause diarrhea than parenterally administered antibiotics. 685 For instance, clindamycin is less likely to cause diarrhea in humans when administered IV than when administered orally. 685 Antibiotics with extensive enterohepatic circulation, such as tetracyclines and erythromycin, are excreted in high concentrations in the bile and are more commonly associated with diarrhea than antibiotics that do not undergo enterohepatic circulation. 685 Antibiotics may cause diarrhea by other means than by disrupting the normal flora. Direct toxic effects may play a role in producing irritation, increasing secretion, and disrupting motility patterns. Tetracyclines are irritating to the gastrointestinal mucosa and may cause inflammation and increase secretion. 685 Erythromycin interacts with smooth muscle cells, stimulating gastrointestinal motility. 685, 686 Normal peristalsis plays an important role in suppressing the population size of potentially pathogenic bacteria. Normally, bacteria that are prevented from adhering to the mucosa by colonization resistance are swept aborally by peristalsis and excreted in the feces. Disruption of normal motility patterns may prevent clearance of pathogenic bacteria, contributing to the colonization of mucosal surfaces.",

Acute, severe enterocolitis can occur in horses of all ages receiving antibiotics and can be life-threatening. Clinical signs are identical to those resulting from other causes of acute enterocolitis. Severe, dehydrating diarrhea; endotoxemia; sepsis; and shock may occur. Hemoconcentration, neutropenia, hypoproteinemia, and electrolyte and acid-base imbalances are common. Severe hyponatremia may occur in foals with antibiotic-associated diarrhea, especially if trimethoprim-sulfa and rifampin combinations are the cause. 687 More detailed descriptions of the clinical and laboratory findings were given earlier. Diagnosis is presumptive because definitive diagnosis of antibiotic-associated diarrhea is impossible. Fecal culture or PCR testing may reveal S. enterica or Clostridium spp. infection.",

            "text": "Toxicity resulting from NSAID administration has been well documented in several species, including horses, and is discussed in Chapter 2. [688] [689] [690] [691] [692] [693] [694] In horses and humans NSAID toxicity is manifested by renal and gastrointestinal disease. Foals are considered to be more susceptible than adult horses to gastrointestinal disease secondary to NSAID administration, and ponies may be more susceptible than horses. NSAID toxicity varies primarily as a result of properties that influence distribution to sensitive tissues and relative selectivity for COX-1 or COX-2. All nonselective NSAIDs are capable of inducing gastrointestinal and renal damage at toxic concentrations. Aspirin has been suggested to be more toxic than other NSAIDs because it irreversibly inactivates COX by acetylation, whereas other NSAIDs reversibly inhibit COX. 688 Phenylbutazone is the drug most commonly reported to cause gastrointestinal toxicity in horses, perhaps because of its widespread usage by veterinarians and horse owners or perhaps because of bona fide differences in toxicity in horses compared with other nonselective NSAIDs. Acute phenylbutazone toxicity in horses resulting from overdose is characterized by mucosal ulceration throughout the gastrointestinal tract, oral ulceration, renal papillary necrosis, vasculopathy, thrombosis, and protein-losing enteropathy with hypoalbuminemia. [690] [691] [692] COX-2-selective NSAIDs appear to be much less toxic in the equine gastrointestinal tract. 392, 695 The focus of this discussion is on the toxic effects of NSAIDs on the large intestine, but this necessarily includes elements of upper gastrointestinal and renal disease.",

            "text": "Gastrointestinal disease induced by NSAIDs is manifested by mucosal ulceration, inflammation, bleeding, and proteinlosing enteropathy. 690, 691, 694, 697 In addition to direct effects on the mucosal barrier, NSAID administration causes an acute relapse of preexisting colonic inflammatory disease and worsens colonic inflammation in humans with inflammatory bowel disease. 688, 699, 700 It is not clear whether the previously mentioned NSAID effects occur in horses. The mechanism by which NSAIDs induce mucosal damage is probably multifactorial. Direct irritation may play a role in oral and gastric irritation and ulceration; however, parenteral administration of NSAIDs produces oral and gastric ulceration as well. Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by inhibition of both COX-1 and COX-2 appears to be the most important mechanism of mucosal injury. Prostaglandins, particularly PGE 2 and PGI 2 , are critical for mucosal health and repair after injury. 701,702 PGE 2 increases mucosal blood flow; increases secretion of mucus, water, and bicarbonate; increases mucosal cell turnover rate and migration; stimulates adenyl cyclase activity; and exerts other protective effects in the gastric mucosa of several species. 688, 701, 702 Perhaps most important, PGE 2 and PGI 2 have roles in maintaining epithelial tight junction integrity, which is indispensable for mucosal barrier function and repair after mucosal injury. 701 In spite of the overwhelming amount of information about the role of prostaglandins in maintaining the mucosal barrier in other species and clear clinical and experimental evidence that NSAIDs injure the equine colonic mucosa, the role of prostaglandins in mucosal protection in the equine colon is not yet well defined. Inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 in equine colonic mucosa with flunixin meglumine results in reduced electrical resistance of the mucosa and increased permeability to macromolecules in vitro, 703 suggesting that flunixin treatment disrupts the epithelial tight junctions in the equine colon. This was correlated with a profound inhibition of PGE 2 and PGI 2 concentrations in the treated tissues. Administration of a PGE 2 analog prevents the gastrointestinal manifestations of phenylbutazone toxicosis in ponies. 691 The recent development of NSAIDs that specifically inhibit COX-2 has markedly reduced the frequency and severity of gastrointestinal side effects in humans taking NSAIDs for chronic musculoskeletal conditions. 704 COX-2-specific NSAIDs such as firocoxib hold promise for use in horses to treat arthritis 705 and other conditions, with reduced incidence of toxicity. For example, the relatively COX-2-specific inhibitors meloxicam and firocoxib are less harmful to equine intestinal mucosa than flunixin meglumine in vitro. 392, 695 Moreover, COX-2-selective inhibitors are significantly more permissive than flunixin for recovery of the mucosa in equine ischemicinjured intestinal tissues; recovery is no different from that for control tissues. 392, 695 NSAID-induced mucosal injury is associated with a marked inflammatory response to microbial products exposed to the lamina propria. 706 This inflammation exacerbates mucosal dysfunction and injury associated with NSAID toxicity. For example, depletion of neutrophils or blockade of neutrophil influx into gastrointestinal tissues or inhibition of neutrophil activation and release of toxic products prevents many of the pathophysiologic effects of NSAID toxicity in the gastrointestinal tract. 106, [707] [708] [709] The inflammatory response alone may result in moderate to severe gastrointestinal ulceration, mural vascular thrombosis and edema, fluid secretion, proteinlosing enteropathy, and mucosal hemorrhage.",

Anorexia, depression, diarrhea, fever, and signs of endotoxemia may also be features. If RDUC is chronic, weight loss, intermittent colic, lethargy, anorexia, and ventral edema are common clinical signs with soft and unformed feces.

[713] [714] [715] Ingestion of the beetles causes release of the toxin and absorption through the gastrointestinal tract. Transcutaneous absorption may occur but appears to be rare in horses. Blister beetles feed on the flowers of alfalfa and may be incorporated into processed alfalfa hay if the hay is cut and processed simultaneously, as by crimping. [713] [714] [715] The beetles often swarm, and large numbers of beetles may be found in relatively small portions of hay. The lethal dose of cantharidin is less than 1 mg/kg, but the concentration of cantharidin varies among species of blister beetles and between sexes. 713, 714 As many as 100 to as few as 6 beetles may be lethal. Usually, only one or a few horses fed contaminated hay will ingest beetles because they are concentrated in a small portion of the hay. However, outbreaks involving many horses on a farm have occurred. Most cases have occurred in Texas and Oklahoma, but horses in other states may be affected as well, especially if hay is imported from states in which blister beetles are common. Peak incidence is in late summer and fall. 716 The fatality rate may be 50% or greater, 713,717 but if the patient survives several days, recovery is probable.",

It is a potent irritant, causing acantholysis and vesicle formation when applied topically. 713, 715, 717 The chemical is thought to disrupt the oxidative metabolism in the mitochondria, causing mitochondrial swelling, plasma membrane damage, and changes in membrane permeability. 713 The mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract is most commonly affected in horses because they ingest the toxin. Cell swelling and necrosis occur, resulting in mucosal ulceration. Oral, esophageal, gastric, and small and large intestinal ulceration have been observed in natural and experimental canthariasis. 713, 715, 717 Severe fibrinous to pseudomembranous inflammation and submucosal edema of the intestine have also been reported. Diarrhea probably results from the severe ulceration and inflammation of the large intestine, causing increased secretion of water, electrolytes, and protein and decreased absorption of fluid. Large volumes of fluid and protein are lost in the gastrointestinal tract, causing hemoconcentration and profound hypoalbuminemia in some affected horses. 713, 715, 717 Cystitis and myocarditis occur in natural and experimentally induced cases of cantharidin toxicity. 713, 715, 717 The toxin is excreted by the kidneys, and high concentrations of cantharidin in the urine induce cystitis. Occasionally, hemorrhagic cystitis may occur, resulting in hematuria or frank hemorrhage into the bladder. 713 The cause of myocarditis and myocardial necrosis is unknown but may be a direct effect of toxin on the myocardium. Increased plasma creatine kinase activity is often observed and has been postulated to arise from the damaged myocardium. 713, 714 Affected horses have a characteristically stiff gait, but histopathologic evidence of skeletal muscle injury that explains the elevated plasma creatine kinase activity has not been observed. 714 The kidneys are often pale, swollen, and moist, with occasional infarcts. 715 Hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia are biochemical features of cantharidin toxicity in horses that have not been explained. 713, 714, 717 Hypocalcemia may result from hypoalbuminemia, but the ionized calcium concentration is often decreased, indicating that hypoalbuminemia is not responsible for the hypocalcemia. 714",

Multiorgan failure is usually the result. Cardiomyopathy and pulmonary disease are common causes of death in humans. 720 Damage to the large intestine is probably caused in part by direct cellular toxicity and corrosion by the compound. However, vasculitis is a hallmark of the disease in humans and horses and is thought to be the most important mechanism of large intestinal disease in humans. 718, 721 Acute hemorrhagic colitis is a feature of arsenic toxicosis, with severe mural edema and mucosal ulceration. 718 Profuse hemorrhagic diarrhea and abdominal pain result.

The amount of soluble carbohydrates that will produce diarrhea varies according to the previous dietary history of the individual. Horses fed diets higher in soluble carbohydrates are more resistant to the deleterious effects of carbohydrate overload. Gradual accommodation to a diet high in carbohydrates can be accomplished over several weeks. Horses fed an unusually large amount of grains or other form of soluble carbohydrates often develop diarrhea and may, depending on the amount ingested, develop severe colitis, systemic inflammation resulting from endotoxemia, metabolic acidosis, and laminitis. 229, [734] [735] [736] The pathogenesis of colitis from carbohydrate overload is primarily caused by the toxic effects on the microbial flora in the large intestine. 735 A sudden delivery of soluble carbohydrates to the large intestine causes rapid fermentation by gram-positive lactic acid-producing bacteria and a sudden increase in organic acid production. 229 The cecal pH level rapidly decreases, and the lactic acid concentration rapidly increases. 229 Rapid organic acid production overwhelms the buffering capacity of the large intestine, not only by directly depleting the buffers found in the contents but also by reducing the efficiency of buffer secretion.

Fresh water and water containing electrolytes should be available in all cases.

The role of inflammation and mediators such as prostaglandins as a cause of fluid loss is well known during S. enterica and clostridial infection. 103, 142, 198, 552, 571, 637, 638, 741 COX inhibitors (NSAIDs) have antisecretory effects on the inflamed intestinal tract, 91, 169 including in the equine colon. 742, 743 NSAIDs are commonly administered to horses with colitis to reduce inflammationassociated fluid secretion. However, prostaglandins such as PGE 2 and PGI 2 also have cytoprotective effects on gastrointestinal mucosa and are critical for mucosal repair. 91, 701 NSAIDs used pharmacologically to inhibit colonic inflammation and secretion may be detrimental to mucosal integrity and healing if not used judiciously. NSAIDs exacerbate colonic inflammation in humans with inflammatory colitis, impede mucosal healing in several models of mucosal injury, and have well-documented detrimental effects on colonic mucosa in horses. 91, 690, 698, 701 In addition to toxicity to the colonic mucosa, gastric ulceration is not unusual in horses with enterocolitis and may be related to treatment with NSAIDs. Although the use of COX-2-selective NSAIDs should, in theory, be less likely to harm or impede repair of the colonic mucosal in patients with colonic inflammation causing diarrhea, the safety and efficacy of these medications has not been evaluated in this application. The prothrombotic adverse effects of COX-2-selective drugs 744 suggest that very cautious use of highly COX-2-selective medications is warranted in patients with systemic inflammation at risk for thrombosis (e.g., endotoxemia and sepsis).",

Vancomycin use is not recommended in horses because of concerns for antimicrobial stewardship. C. perfringens type C antitoxin has been recommended for treatment of neonatal clostridiosis, but there is no evidence of its efficacy. 752 Antitoxin preparations are not advocated for use in adult horses with clostridiosis.",

Administration of heparin (20-80 IU/kg SC or IV every 6-12 hours) may prevent thrombosis in these patients, provided antithrombin III concentrations are adequate in the plasma. Concentrated sources of antithrombin III are not available for use in horses, but whole plasma may provide an important source. Treatment with heparin is thought to decrease thrombosis, especially of the jugular vein, which is a serious complication of salmonellosis. Low-dose aspirin treatment (10 mg/kg PO every 24-48 hours) in conjunction with heparin treatment may provide added benefit by irreversibly inhibiting platelet function. 753 Heparin and aspirin may have protective effects on the digital lamina. 753, 754 Heparin may enhance the phagocytic activity of the reticuloendothelial system by enhancing the efficiency of opsonins, such as fibronectin and immunoglobulin, stimulating phagocytosis of products of coagulation and possibly other particles, including bacteria. 755, 756 Probiotics Maintenance of the bacterial flora in the gastrointestinal tract is an important defense mechanisms preventing colonization by pathogenic bacteria. Little work has been done to investigate the efficacy of these products in horses. Preparations of Saccharomyces boulardii were shown to decrease the duration and severity of disease in horses with colitis. 757 In foals, probiotic use was associated with increased risk of diarrhea and, especially, diarrhea requiring clinical intervention. In humans, fecal transplantation (known to most veterinarians as transfaunation) has been proven effective for intestinal clostridiosis. As the intestinal microbiota are extremely diverse, 756 restoration of the overall flora is more likely to be effective than restoration of single bacterial species.",

Normal intake of roughage to provide energy may be inadequate; however, feeding of grains should be avoided to prevent delivery of highly fermentable carbohydrate to the colon. Dietary management usually consists of restricting or eliminating long-stem roughage (hay) from the diet and feeding exclusively a complete pelleted diet (at least 30% dietary fiber). The rationale behind this recommendation is to reduce the mechanical and physiologic load on the colon. Frequent meals (4-6 times a day) are recommended. Corn oil (1 cup every 12-24 hours) can be added to the pellets to increase the caloric intake without adding roughage or grain. It is important to note that if a horse with colitis refuses to eat pelleted feed, then high-quality grass hay should be fed. In anorectic or severely catabolic patients, enteral and parenteral nutrition (total and partial) has been used successfully to provide calories and nutritional support.",

The visceral peritoneum forms the serosal surfaces of the intraabdominal organs. Caudally, the peritoneum reflects over the surfaces of the pelvic organs (portions of the urogenital tract and rectum), excluding them from the peritoneal space, and defining the retroperitoneal space. The peritoneal space communicates with the lumen of the uterus (and thus the external environment) via the fallopian tubes in females. In males the peritoneum forms a true blind sac. The vascular supply and nervous innervation of the visceral peritoneum are supplied by the splanchnic vessels and visceral autonomic nerves, respectively. Branches of the intercostal, lumbar, and iliac arteries supply the parietal peritoneum, and the phrenic and intercostal nerves provide nervous innervation. Inflammation of the parietal peritoneum is perceived as somatic pain, resulting in a splinted abdominal wall, pain on external palpation, and reluctance to move.",

This function, together with the lubricant properties of the PF, helps to maintain gliding surfaces within the peritoneum and prevent adhesion formation. PF produced by the mesothelium tends to move ventrally and cranially, aided largely by diaphragmatic movement. PF, waste products, and foreign material exit the peritoneal cavity to enter the lymphatic system through diffusely distributed subendothelial pores or via the large diaphragmatic stomata, depending on particle size. Large molecules and particles greater than approximately 40,000 MW (such as bacteria) exit through the diaphragmatic stomata and ultimately enter the thoracic duct. The term peritonitis refers to inflammation of the mesothelial lining of the peritoneal cavity.",

            "text": "Most cases of trauma or intestinal perforation result in contamination of the peritoneum with large numbers of many types of bacteria. The intestinal tract contains a mixed population of bacteria, and the quantity of bacteria and prevalence of anaerobic species increase in the distal segments. Not surprisingly, mortality associated with contamination from the lower bowel is high. Hirsch and Jang 776 reported isolation of an infective agent from exudative equine PF in approximately 25% of attempts. Obligate anaerobic bacteria were cultured most frequently, followed by members of the Enterobacteriaceae family (predominantly E. coli). Penicillin-resistant Bacteroides fragilis was isolated from 10% to 20% of cases. In another study in which bacteria were identified in equine abdominal fluid by cytologic examination or culture, E. coli was the organism most commonly isolated. 777 In human beings and laboratory animals, despite the variety of organisms initially introduced by polymicrobial contamination, established infections are characterized by only a few types of bacteria, which are often gram-negative aerobes and anaerobic bacteria. This selectivity occurs through the processes of selective reduction of bacterial populations and bacterial synergism. An example of synergism in human beings and laboratory animals is peritonitis involving E. coli and B. fragilis. The presence of each organism is beneficial to the survival of the other, and each is important in the overall pathogenesis of the disease. E. coli is associated with septicemia and early mortality, whereas B. fragilis infection tends to result in chronic abscessation with delayed morbidity and mortality. 766 Other causes of equine peritonitis include parasites, viral disorders (influenza, equine viral arteritis, equine infectious anemia, African horse sickness), and neoplasia. Verminous arteritis caused by strongylosis can lead to vascular damage (thromboembolism and infarction) to the intestine. The activities of strongyles, ascarids, and tapeworms can result in perforation of the bowel and damage to other abdominal organs. There has been one report of septic peritonitis caused by colonic perforation associated with aberrant migration of Gasterophilus intestinalis larva. 778 Biologic events resulting from contamination of the abdomen or injury to the mesothelial cells include release of catecholamines, histamine, and serotonin from peritoneal mast cells; vasodilation and hyperemia; an increase in peritoneal vascular permeability; secretion of protein-rich fluid into the peritoneum; transformation of mesothelial cells into macrophages; and influx of PMN cells, humoral opsonins, natural antibodies, and serum complement into the peritoneal cavity. 765 Other possible events include depression of the peritoneal fibrinolytic activity, fibrin deposits on the peritoneal surface, and inflammatory-mediated and sympathetic-mediated ileus. These processes serve to confine contamination and infection and, with clean, minimally invasive procedures such as enterocentesis or trocarization, are effective. However, with greater severity of peritoneal contamination or irritation, these processes are magnified and become deleterious. Consequences include hypovolemia, hypoproteinemia, gastrointestinal ileus, ischemia of the bowel wall with subsequent absorption of bacteria and toxins, and ultimately adhesion and abscess formation. Equine peritoneal macrophages release a multitude of inflammatory mediators when exposed to bacterial LPS, and endotoxemia contributes the clinical picture. A complete review of endotoxemia is presented in Endotoxemia.",

Clinically, viewing the pathogenesis of peritonitis as a series of stages is useful. The contamination stage, lasting 3 to 6 hours, involves introduction of bacteria into the peritoneum and initiation of the acute inflammatory response previously described. If the organisms are not eliminated, the process evolves to the stage of acute diffuse peritonitis as, regardless of the location of the initial contamination, bacteria spread throughout the peritoneum within several hours. The stage of acute diffuse peritonitis lasts up to 5 days. The inflammatory response persists and escalates with continued exudation of proteinaceous fluid and influx of inflammatory cells. Offending organisms are delivered to the lymphatic system and may be eliminated by the immune system. Alternatively, organisms can gain access to the systemic circulation in sufficient numbers to result in clinically relevant bacteremia. This stage of the disease process has the highest mortality because of the effects of severe peritoneal inflammation, endotoxemia, and sepsis. If the animal survives this stage but fails to eliminate infection from the peritoneal cavity, the disease enters a transitional phase referred to as the acute adhesive (or localizing) stage, typically occurring 4 to 10 days after the initial insult. Neutrophils are still active, macrophages are increasing in numbers, and fibrin aggregates are being organized or lysed. If infection persists beyond this point, organization of fibrin proceeds and organisms become isolated from host defenses. At this point, the disease process enters the stage of chronic abscessation. This stage can begin as early as 8 days after inoculation and persist indefinitely.",

After several days, leukocytosis and hyperfibrinogenemia are more typical. In chronic peritonitis, hyperproteinemia with hyperglobulinemia may be present. SAA is also increased. 254 Neonates with uroperitoneum tend to develop azotemia, hyponatremia, hypochloremia, hyperkalemia, and acidemia. PF analysis is principal to the diagnosis of peritonitis. Detailed description of PF analysis is provided in the Examination section of this chapter. PF WBC counts in acute peritonitis are reportedly higher than those in chronic peritonitis, 768 but this is not always the case, and the WBC count does not always correlate with disease severity or prognosis. The PF WBC count can be greater than 100,000/\u03bcL following enterocentesis, with no clinical signs or problems. 780 Conversely, peritoneal WBC counts of fewer than 100,000/\u03bcL may be found in foals or horses with intraabdominal abscesses. 781 The peritoneal WBC count can increase to greater than 150,000/\u03bcL following celiotomy 782 and can be higher if an enterotomy is done. Postoperatively, the WBC count normally continues to decline and returns to near normal by 5 to 7 days. Failure of the WBC count to decrease suggests peritonitis resulting from a postoperative complication. Finally, PF WBC counts greater than 500,000/\u03bcL indicate severe focal or generalized peritoneal sepsis. With acute peritonitis, PMN cells typically increase to a greater degree than mononuclear cells, but this depends on the cause. In horses with gastrointestinal disease and endotoxemia, the number of peritoneal mononuclear cells increases, as does transformation of mesothelial cells to macrophages. In chronic cases, one easily may mistake transforming mesothelial cells for neoplastic cells, which can make diagnosis difficult.",

If one observes numerous microorganisms of mixed types free in the PF, especially in conjunction with plant material, bowel rupture likely has occurred. The presence of toxic or degenerate neutrophils and bacteria within PMN cells helps to distinguish PF from intestinal contents in such horses. Fluid obtained from enterocentesis is largely devoid of WBCs but is discolored and contains mixed microorganisms and plant material. Bacterial contamination of a sample can occur during collection of the sample, and iatrogenic contamination of a sample can result in free and intracellular bacteria, particularly if processing is delayed. In such cases the bacterial numbers are few and the neutrophils appear healthy. In some cases of gastrointestinal perforation the luminal material, inflammatory cells, and protein may be sequestered by the omentum and further contained by fibrinous adhesions. Abdominal fluid obtained via standard ventral paracentesis may have low cellularity and protein content but large numbers of mixed bacteria, indicating bowel rupture. 768 Examples include gastric rupture along the greater curvature of the stomach between the omental layers (omental bursa) and perforated gastric or duodenal ulcers in foals.

Treatment goals are to resolve the primary problem, minimize inflammation, and prevent long-term complications. In the acute phase, analgesia and therapy as described for endotoxemia are important. Flunixin meglumine is advocated for its local and systemic antiinflammatory effects and may be effective in retarding adhesion formation. 785 Initial antimicrobial selection should be broad spectrum based on the presumption that mixed infection is present. IV administration is preferred over oral or intramuscular routes in acute, diffuse, septic peritonitis because more reliable concentrations of drugs are achieved in the tissues and PF. 786 The combination of a \u03b2-lactam antibiotic with an aminoglycoside, such as potassium penicillin (22,000-44,000 IU/kg IV every 6 hours) combined with gentamicin (6.6 mg/kg every 24 hours), is appropriate in most circumstances. Metronidazole (25 mg/ kg orally every 12 hours) can be added to the regimen given the strong possibility of infection involving penicillin-resistant B. fragilis. This regimen can be modified when culture and antimicrobial sensitivity results become available. Peritonitis caused by A. equuli generally responds well to therapy with penicillin either alone or in combination with gentamicin. Aminoglycosides and NSAIDs have the potential to induce acute renal tubular damage, particularly with concurrent dehydration and decreased renal perfusion. Therefore adequate restoration and maintenance of hydration and monitoring of renal function are important. Monitoring of the WBC count, plasma fibrinogen, SAA, and abdominal fluid analysis often guide duration of therapy. Horses with abdominal abscessation resulting from monomicrobial infections typically require weeks to months of therapy, whereas polymicrobial infection may require many months of antibiotic treatment. Further details regarding principles of antimicrobial therapy are provided elsewhere in this text (Chapter 2).",

Postoperative lavage decreases the incidence of experimentally induced abdominal adhesions. 787 Open surgical exploration provides the most effective and thorough examination of all peritoneal surfaces and is recommended if gastrointestinal perforation or ischemia is suspected or in any other case in which correction of a primary lesion is indicated. A ventral abdominal drain can either be placed at the time of surgery or in the standing horse with sedation and local anesthesia. Techniques have been described in detail elsewhere. 788, 789 Peritoneal lavage is typically performed with 10 to 20 L of a balanced isotonic electrolyte solution twice a day for 3 to 5 days, until the lavage solution becomes clear or until the catheter becomes clogged with fibrin or omentum. Hypertonic solutions should be avoided because they can result in fluid shifts into the peritoneum. The addition of povidone iodine to a balanced solution should be avoided because concentrations as low as 3% can induce peritoneal inflammation. 790 Other agents such as antibiotics or heparin have also been suggested as components of the lavage solution, but data demonstrating their benefit are not currently available. Active (or closed suction) abdominal drains have also been advocated, with similar benefits and potential complications to other methods. 789 Lavage with a plain isotonic solution did not alter the pharmacokinetics of gentamicin administered systemically. 791 Thus alteration of antimicrobial dosing does not appear necessary if lavage with plain solutions is part of the therapeutic regimen. Complications associated with the use of abdominal drains or repeated peritoneal drainage include retrograde infection, local irritation, pneumoperitoneum, and SC seepage around the drain and resultant cellulitis. If the patient is hypovolemic or hypoproteinemic, volume replacement and administration of plasma or synthetic colloids should be considered before removing large quantities of fluid from the abdomen.",

            "text": "To gain an appreciation of the mechanisms in which the mucosa is injured and subsequently repaired, it is important to understand how the integrity of the mucosa is physiologically regulated. Regulation of mucosal integrity is referred to as mucosal barrier function, which is vital because it prevents bacteria and associated toxins from gaining access to subepithelial tissues and the circulation. However, the mucosa has two conflicting functions: it must serve as a protective barrier while continuing to absorb solutes necessary to maintain the well-being of the host. This conflict is most notable at the intercellular (paracellular) space, which allows passage of select solutes and water 797-800 but does not admit large molecules, including bacterial toxins. 801 The paracellular space is almost exclusively regulated by the tight junction, 574 which is the interepithelial junction at the apical-most aspect of the paracellular space. Although these tight junctions were originally viewed as inert cellular adhesion sites, it has become clear in recent years that tight junction permeability is dependent on tissue-specific molecular structure and regulated by a complex array of intracellular proteins and the cytoskeleton. Tight junctions consist of a group of transmembrane proteins that interdigitate from adjacent cells. Although occludin was originally thought to be the predominant tight junction transmembrane protein, a group of proteins termed claudins appear to fine-tune the function of the tight junction. For example, select claudins are responsible for the relative porosity of the barrier to select electrolytes based on their charge within the paracellular space. 802 These transmembrane proteins interact with the cytoskeleton via a series of intracellular proteins, including zonula occludens (ZO)-1, ZO-2, ZO-3, cingulin, and others. 803 In addition, local regulatory proteins such as the small GTPase Rho are critical to tight junction function. Generally, the relative contractile state of the actin cytoskeleton determines the degree to which tight junctions are open or closed, but the complexities of regulation of this process are poorly understood. 804 , 805 The most sensitive measure of mucosal barrier function is transepithelial electrical resistance, which is measured by mounting mucosa in an in vitro system called an Ussing chamber, because this measurement is largely a reflection of the permeability of mucosa to ions. 806, 807 There are two routes ions it may follow when traversing the epithelium: transcellular and paracellular. 801 Because cell membranes have a resistance to the passive flow of ions 1.5 to 3 log units greater than that of the epithelium as a whole, measurements of transepithelial resistance largely reflect the resistance of the paracellular space, particularly the tight junctions that regulate the paracellular flow of ions. 807 Because tight junctions differ in structure from different portions of the mucosa, 808 measurements of transepithelial resistance reflect the net resistance of the epithelium of variable permeability within a given tissue. For example, tight junctions in the intestinal glandular structures called crypts are leakier than those in the surface epithelium because of fewer and less organized tight junction strands. 806, 809 Conversely, surface epithelium has a greater number of well-organized tight junction strands that result in epithelium with a relatively high resistance. 806 This correlates well with the absorptive function of epithelium located on the mucosal surface and the secretory function of crypt epithelium. The structure of tight junctions also varies with the segment of intestine. For example, tight junctions have more strands in the ileum than the jejunum, which is reflected by a higher transepithelial resistance in the ileum. 810 In addition, cells are more closely apposed at the level of the tight junction within the colon. This is in keeping with the largely absorptive role of the colon and is advantageous given the hostile microbial environment of the colon.",

This epithelium has baseline transepithelial resistance measurements of approximately 2 to 3000 \u03a9\u2022cm 2 , which is an order of magnitude higher than the adjacent cardiac mucosa. 812, 813 Thus the stratified squamous mucosa is exceptionally impermeable. This is the only mechanism this mucosa has to defend itself against injury. The stratified squamous epithelium consists of four layers: the outer stratum corneum, stratum transitionale, stratum spinosum, and the basal stratum germinativum. However, not all layers contribute equally to barrier function, which is largely composed of interepithelial tight junctions in the stratum corneum and mucosubstances secreted by the stratum spinosum. 812, 814 The relative impermeability of stratified squamous mucosa can be demonstrated by the effects of HCl on this type of epithelium in vitro, which has very little effect until it reaches a pH of 2.5 or below. 813 Although the majority of the literature on equine ulceration pertains to the effects of HCl and inhibitors of HCl secretion, [815] [816] [817] [818] other factors may be critical to the development of gastric ulcer disease.",

The gastric mucosa secretes both mucus and bicarbonate, which together form an HCO 3 \u2212 containing gel that titrates acid before it reaches the lumen. 819 , 820 The mucous layer is principally formed by glycoproteins (mucins) secreted by goblet cells but also includes other gastric secretions and sloughed epithelial cells. Mucins consist of core peptides with a series of densely packed O-linked polysaccharide side chains that, once secreted, become hydrated and form a viscoelastic gel. The mucous layer, however, does not form an absolute barrier to back diffusion of acid. For acid that does back diffuse into the gastric mucosa, epithelial Na + /H + exchangers are capable of expelling H + once the cell reaches a critical pH. 820 Recent studies have renewed interest in the protective mechanisms of mucus because of the discovery of a group of compounds secreted by goblet cells called the trefoil peptides. The name of these peptides is derived from a highly conserved cloverleaf structural motif, which confers substantial resistance to degradation by proteases including pepsin. There are three known members of this group, pS2, SP, and intestinal trefoil factor (ITF), the latter of which is solely secreted by goblet cells in the small and large intestine. Both pS2 and SP are secreted by goblet cells within the stomach and are believed to intercalate with mucous glycoproteins, possibly contributing to the barrier properties of mucus. 821 These peptides also play a critical role in repair of injured mucosa.",

            "text": "An additional mucosal function that serves to reduce the level of injury is adaptive cytoprotection, in which application of topical irritants to gastric mucosa results in subsequent protection of mucosa in response to repeated exposure to damaging agents. For example, pretreatment with 10% ethanol protected against mucosal damage in response to subsequent application of absolute ethanol, and this effect was abolished by treatment with the COX inhibitor indomethacin. 822 The cytoprotective effects of prostaglandins have been demonstrated directly in studies in which preadministration of prostaglandins protected gastric mucosa from damage by agents such as concentrated hydrochloric acid and hypertonic saline. 823 Prostaglandins appear to be cytoprotective in the stomach at doses less than those used to inhibit gastric acid secretion, ruling out a simple antacid mechanism. 824 Although not fully characterized, cytoprotection has been attributed in part to prostaglandin-stimulated mucous production. 825 An associated beneficial effect of prostaglandins is the increased production of bicarbonate, which is trapped within mucus on the surface of the mucosa. 826, 827 Interestingly, PGE 2 appears to lose its cytoprotective activity in the presence of the mucolytic agent N-acetylcysteine. Attention has also been directed at enhanced mucosal blood flow as a potential mechanism for prostaglandin-mediated cytoprotection-for example, pretreatment with PGI 2 protected against ethanol-induced mucosal damage as a result of increased mucosal blood flow. 828 In addition PGE 2 , which is also cytoprotective despite the fact that it does not increase blood flow, 829 prevents vascular stasis associated with irritant-induced vascular damage by inhibiting neutrophil adherence to damaged endothelium. 830 Sensory nerves distributed throughout gastrointestinal mucosa have also been implicated in cytoprotective mechanisms. As an example of their importance in mucosal cytoprotection, pretreatment of newborn rats with capsaicin (which dose dependently destroys sensory nerves) renders the mature rats more susceptible to gastric injury. 831 Alternatively, the use of a low dose of capsaicin, which stimulates rather than destroys sensory nerves, protects gastric mucosa against injurious agents. 832, 833 Sensory nerves contain neuropeptides such as calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P, which may play a protective role via vascular mechanisms. For instance, CGRP stimulates increased gastric blood flow, which is theorized to reduce injury similarly to prostaglandins. Recent studies suggest that the roles of prostaglandins and CGRP in gastric cytoprotection are intimately intertwined. In particular, PGI 2 is believed to sensitize sensory nerves following treatment with a mild irritant, with resultant increases in CGRP release and mucosal flow. Similar studies have shown that antagonists of CGRP inhibit the cytoprotective action of PGE 2 . 834 Another neural mediator, nitric oxide, has also been implicated in adaptive cytoprotection. Interestingly, nitric oxide has a number of actions that are similar to those of prostaglandins, including maintenance of mucosal blood flow. 835",

The proximal duodenum also has to protect itself from acid damage as it receives gastric contents, and this involves secretion of mucus and bicarbonate similarly to the stomach. One other mechanism that helps both the stomach and the intestine to maintain mucosal barrier function is the speed with which the mucosa repairs. For a defect to develop in the mucosal barrier, injurious factors have to outpace mucosal recovery. Such recovery initially involves epithelial migration across denuded regions of basement membrane (restitution). 821 This process is so rapid that epithelial defects may be resurfaced within minutes. For example, in bile salt-injured equine colon, denuded surface mucosa was completely covered by restituting epithelium within 180 minutes. 207 In the small intestine, intestinal villi greatly amplify the surface area of the mucosal luminal surface, which in turn takes far longer to resurface with restituting epithelium once it has become denuded. 836 Intestinal villi, however, are able to dramatically reduce the denuded surface area by contracting. 837 ",

            "text": "Although the stratified squamous epithelium is relatively impermeable to HCl, there are a number of factors that can dramatically enhance the damaging effects of HCl in this epithelium. In particular, bile salts and SCFAs are capable of breaking down the squamous epithelial barrier at an acid pH, exposing deep layers to HCl, with subsequent development of ulceration. 813, 838 Relatively high concentrations of SCFA normally exist within the equine stomach as a result of microbial fermentation. 812 These weak acids penetrate squamous mucosa and appear to damage Na + transport activity principally located in the stratum germinativum. Bile salts may also be present in the proximal stomach as a result of reflux from the duodenum. Although such reflux has a relatively high pH, it appears that bile salts adhere to stratified squamous epithelium, becoming lipid soluble and triggering damage once the pH falls below 4. 839 Diet and management (e.g., periods of fasting) also play crucial roles in the development of conditions conducive to gastric ulceration. Typically, there is a pH gradation in horses from proximal to distal compartments of the stomach, with the lowest pH values in the distal stomach. 840 During periods of fasting, this stratification is disrupted such that low pH values may be recorded in the proximal stomach. 841 Fasting conditions also increase the concentration of duodenal contents within the proximal stomach, particularly bile. 839 Proper gastric mucosa is exposed to injurious agents, including pepsin, bile, and acid. The latter is constantly secreted by parietal cells in the horse as an adaptation to nearcontinuous intake of roughage, 811 but it is tightly regulated by enterochromaffin (ECL)-like cells within the proper gastric mucosa and G and D cells, which are present within the pyloric mucosa. Acid secretion is amplified by ECL-released histamine, which interacts with H 2 receptors on parietal cells, and G cells, which release the prosecretory hormone gastrin. A combination of histamine and gastrin can have a synergistic effect on parietal cell gastric secretion, because these mediators have distinct receptors and second messengers. On the other hand, D cells are sensitive to an acidic environment and release somatostatin, which inhibits acid secretion. 842 Nonetheless, gastric mucosa may be exposed to acid for prolonged periods of time, particularly in horses that are extensively meal fed and do not have the benefit of roughage, which tends to buffer stomach contents. 839, 842 Aside from peptic ulceration, induced by combinations of acid and pepsin, research in the human field has revealed the tremendous importance of Helicobacter pylori in inducing ulceration. Infection with this organism has the effect of raising gastric pH because of disruption of gastric glands but also induces an inflammatory reaction that causes damage. 843 However, there is very little evidence that this organism is involved in gastric ulcers in horses. In the absence of a known role for infectious agents in gastric ulceration in animals, ulceration likely develops from injurious factors similar to those found in the proximal stomach, including gastric acid and bile. Some factors that are important to the induction of squamous epithelial ulceration may not be important in the development of proper gastric mucosal ulceration. For example, feed deprivation and intensive training reproducibly induce squamous epithelial ulceration in horses but have little effect on proper gastric mucosa in horses. 844 Gastric acid likely plays a key role, whereas other factors such as NSAIDs serve to reduce gastric defense mechanisms. In particular, inhibition of prostaglandin production would reduce mucous and bicarbonate secretion while reducing gastric mucosal blood flow. 845 Some of the NSAIDs also have a topical irritant effect, although this appears to be of minor significance, because the route of administration (oral or parenteral) seems to have little influence on the development of ulceration. 846 The source of prostaglandins responsible for gastric protection was originally assumed to be COX-1, because this COX isoform is constitutively expressed in gastric mucosa, whereas COX-2 is not expressed in the stomach unless it is induced by inflammatory mediators. However, mice in which the COX-1 gene has been knocked out fail to develop spontaneous gastric lesions, 847 possibly because of compensatory increases in prostaglandin production by COX-2. 848 This concept agrees with recent data indicating that inhibition of both COX isoforms is required to induce gastric ulceration. 849 From a clinical perspective, these data indicate that drugs selective for either COX-1 or COX-2 may be less ulcerogenic in the horse because they allow the uninhibited COX isoforms to continue to produce protective prostanoids. Because COX-2 elaborates prostaglandins induced by inflammatory stimuli, preferential or selective inhibitors of COX-2 may be particularly useful because of their ability to serve as antiinflammatory agents that are less ulcerogenic. 392",

Initially, it seems intuitive that by reducing gastrointestinal blood supply, the mucosa becomes injured. The anatomy of the gastrointestinal tract, and the differing structure of the intestinal mucosa at various anatomic locations, has a significant influence on the extent of mucosal injury. Ischemic injury may be induced by several different mechanisms, including occlusion of arterial supply by a thrombus, strangulation of intestinal vasculature, and generalized reduction in blood flow associated with various shock states. A number of seemingly distinct mechanisms of intestinal injury, such as intestinal distention, also trigger mucosal injury via an ischemic mechanism. Reperfusion injury may also influence the extent of mucosal injury following an ischemic episode and has been proposed as a potential site of therapeutic intervention. 850, 851 It is critical that the mechanisms of ischemia/reperfusion injury be understood to develop an understanding of the severity of various clinical conditions, and begin to formulate a therapeutic approach to diseases characterized by this devastating form of injury.",

            "text": "The intestinal circulation is capable of closely regulating blood flow during periods of low systemic perfusion pressure. 852, 853 In particular, local regulation of resistance vessels within the microvasculature is particularly prominent; metabolic end products of ATP result in continued dilatation of resistance vessels despite reductions in systemic arterial pressure. This results in continued perfusion of gastrointestinal tissues during the early stages of shock, while other organs such as skeletal muscle undergo massive shunting of blood as a result of marked increases in the resistance of resistance vessels. The reasons for these differences in regulation are not entirely clear but may relate to the relatively high level of energy required to fuel the intestinal mucosa and the serious systemic effects of breaches in the mucosal barrier. When blood flow falls below a critical level, regulatory systems are no longer effective and oxygen uptake by the gastrointestinal tissue decreases, culminating in tissue damage. 852 The villous tip is the most susceptible region affected by hypoxia in the equine small intestine, largely because of the countercurrent exchange mechanism of blood flow in the small intestinal villus. 852 This countercurrent exchange mechanism is attributable to the vascular architecture, which consists of a central arteriole that courses up the core villus, arborizes at the tip, and is drained by venules coursing down the periphery of the villus. 854 As oxygenated blood flows into the central arteriole, oxygen tends to diffuse across to the adjacent venules, which are flowing in the opposite direction. This series of events takes place along the length of the villus, resulting in a villous tip that is relatively hypoxic even under normal conditions. Furthermore, when blood flow is reduced, as occurs in hypovolemic or septic shock, the countercurrent exchange of oxygen is enhanced, and the tip becomes absolutely hypoxic. 852 This mechanism might explain why the small intestinal mucosa is more susceptible to ischemic injury, compared with the colon, which has no villi. The duration of ischemia required to produce severe morphologic damage to the equine colon is approximately 25% longer than the small intestine. 855",

            "text": "Recent studies on epithelial injury during ischemia suggest that the majority of epithelial cells undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis) during ischemia and reperfusion rather than necrosis, allowing retention of reusable components of irreversibly injured cells. 857 In one study, 80% of detached epithelium during small intestinal ischemia/reperfusion underwent apoptosis. 858 Although the most obvious result of apoptosis is loss of surface epithelium, a number of cells on the lower portion of the villus (in the small intestine) and cells within the crypts may also undergo apoptosis that only becomes evident up to 24 hours following reperfusion of ischemic tissue. 859 Morphologic changes observed in ischemic-injured small intestinal mucosa follow a similar sequence regardless of whether injury is induced by ischemia alone or ischemia/ reperfusion (Table 12.6 ). 860 Initially, epithelium separates from the underlying basement membrane, forming a fluid-filled space termed Gr\u00fcenhagen's space (Fig. 12.7 ). The mechanism of fluid accumulation in this space is not entirely understood but may result from continued epithelial absorption of NaCl and water before it has fully detached from neighboring epithelial cells. This fluid accumulation likely exacerbates epithelial separation from the basement membrane. Subsequently, epithelium progressively sloughs from the tip of the villus toward the crypts, which are the last components of the intestinal mucosa to become injured. 163, 406, 861 This likely relates to the vascular architecture, because crypts receive a blood supply that is separate from the vasculature involved in the villous countercurrent exchange mechanism. The early morphologic changes observed in the equine large colon during ischemia are somewhat different from those described in the equine small intestine because of the lack of intestinal villi. As might be expected, the more superficially located surface cells are sloughed before those in crypts. 855, 862 The orderly progression of tissue injury has been used by one group of investigators to accurately predict survival in horses with large colon volvulus. Biopsies were taken from the pelvic flexure, which has been previously shown to accurately reflect mucosal changes along the length of the colon, 863 and histologically examined for the width of the crypts and intercrypt interstitial space. The latter measurements were expressed as an interstitium: crypt width (I:C) ratio. Nonviable colon was defined as that which had >60% loss of crypt and an I:C ratio >3. Using this methodology, survival was correctly predicted in 94% of horses. 864",

            "text": "Since the dramatic decline in S. vulgaris-induced colic, which was frequently associated with infarction of intestinal arterial blood supply, 865 the vast majority of ischemic lesions are associated with strangulating obstruction. Therefore it is important to consider mechanisms of ischemic injury in horses with naturally occurring strangulating lesions. The majority of experimental work has either assessed complete ischemia (complete occlusion of the arterial blood supply) 855 or lowflow ischemia (reduction of arterial blood flow). 866, 867 During intestinal strangulation, however, a disparity between the degree of occlusion of the veins and arteries occurs in which veins are occluded before arteries because of differences in the compliance of vascular walls. Strangulating lesions are typically hemorrhagic (hemorrhagic strangulating obstruction), because the arteries continue to supply blood to tissues that have little or no venous drainage. This results in ischemic injury, as previously outlined, but also in tremendous congestion of the tissues. Such hemorrhagic congestion has two opposing effects: it disrupts tissue architecture, including the mucosa and its epithelium, but it continues to provide oxygenated blood to the tissues during much of the ischemic episode. In contrast, when strangulation results in sudden cessation of arterial blood flow (ischemic strangulating obstruction), tissues appear pale, and the mucosa rapidly degenerates because of a complete lack of oxygenated blood. 163 From a clinical standpoint, this makes it difficult to assess the degree of mucosal injury in horses with strangulating injuries, because intestine that may look nonviable (dark red) may in fact have less mucosal injury than that of ischemic strangulated intestine. 868 An additional consideration in clinical strangulating obstruction is the degree of ischemia that may be induced by intestinal distention. For example, experimental distention (18 cm of H 2 O for 2 hours) and decompression (2 hours) of the jejunum resulted in a significant increase in microvascular permeability and a significant decrease in tissue oxygenation similar to what would be expected with low-flow ischemia. 869, 870 In particular, microscopic evaluation of vasculature revealed capillary endothelial cell damage and local edema formation. 871 These data suggest that distended intestine proximal to an obstruction may undergo mucosal injury despite its relatively normal appearance. Indeed, in one study, intraluminal pressures greater than 15 cm H 2 O in naturally occurring cases of colic correlated with a poor prognosis for survival. 872",

In particular, the type of ischemia used in most laboratory animal studies has been \"low-flow ischemia\" (in which the blood flow is typically reduced to 20% of baseline flow), whereas studies in horses have used a number of different ischemic models, including various types of strangulating obstruction. Although strangulating obstruction is of great clinical relevance, this type of ischemic insult is less likely to develop reperfusion injury. 861, 877, 878 Conversely, low-flow ischemia appears to prime tissues for subsequent injury once the tissue is reperfused, and there is considerable evidence to support the presence of reperfusion injury in horses following low-flow ischemia. 866, 867, 871, 879 Nonetheless, low-flow ischemia may not be a common clinical entity.",

During reperfusion, xanthine oxidase rapidly degrades hypoxanthine in the presence of oxygen, producing the superoxide radical as a byproduct. 850 The superoxide radical contributes to oxidative tissue damage and, most importantly, activates neutrophil chemoattractants. 410, 875 Inhibition of xanthine oxidase in feline studies of intestinal ischemia/reperfusion injury prevents infiltration of neutrophils and subsequent mucosal injury. 410, 874 Inhibition of xanthine oxidase has had no effect on ischemia/reperfusion injury in equine small intestine 876 and colon, 407 suggesting that either reperfusion injury is simply a continuation of injury initiated during ischemia, as suggested in some equine studies, 856 or that the classic reperfusion injury pathway is activated by alternate sources of ROMs. The latter has been suggested by studies in feline models of ischemia/reperfusion injury, in which the source of a significant proportion of ROMs is unknown, and independent of xanthine oxidase and neutrophils. 874 In a veterinary review of the pathogenesis of intestinal reperfusion injury in the horse, the concept of a therapeutic window in which treatment of reperfusion injury would be beneficial was suggested. 850 The basis of this concept is that there are certain conditions under which ischemic injury is minimal and that tissues are severely damaged during reperfusion. 877 Thus under conditions of low-flow ischemia, very little injury is demonstrated during 3 hours of ischemia, but remarkable injury occurs during 1 hour of reperfusion. 410, 874, 875 A therapeutic window may not exist under conditions of strangulating obstruction in which severe injury occurs during ischemia and minimal injury occurs during reperfusion. 884 This in turn greatly reduces clinicians' abilities to ameliorate ischemia/reperfusion injury with treatments such as antioxidants at the time of reperfusion.",

For instance, superficial erosions can be rapidly covered by migration of epithelium adjacent to the wound, a process termed epithelial restitution. Ulceration (full-thickness disruption of mucosa and penetration of the muscularis mucosa), however, requires repair of submucosal vasculature and ECM. This is initiated by the formation of granulation tissue, which supplies connective tissue elements and microvasculature necessary for mucosal reconstruction. Connective tissue elements include proliferating fibroblasts that accompany newly produced capillaries that form from proliferating endothelium. Recent studies indicate that nitric oxide is critical to both of these processes, 835, 885 which likely explains the reparative properties of it in the stomach. 886 Once an adequate granulation bed has been formed, newly proliferated epithelium at the edge of the wound begins to migrate across the wound. Gastric glands at the base of the ulcer begin to bud and migrate across the granulation bed in a tubular fashion. 887 Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is expressed by repairing epithelium and appears to facilitate these processes. 888 These events are facilitated by a mucoid cap, which retains reparative factors and serum adjacent to the wound bed. 845 Once the ulcer crater has been filled with granulation tissue, and the wound has been reepithelialized, the subepithelial tissue remodels by altering the type and amount of collagen. Despite the remodeling process, ulcers tend to recur at sites of previous ulceration, and there is concern that this remodeling can result in excessive deposition of collagen and fibrosis. 821",

            "text": "Reparative mechanisms are similar in the intestine, except that in the small intestine, mucosal villi contribute to mucosal repair. Once intestinal epithelium is disrupted, there are two events that occur almost immediately to reduce the size of the denuded portion of the villus: contraction of the villus and epithelial restitution (Fig. 12.9 ). For example, in porcine ileum subjected to 2 hours of ischemia, villi were 60% of their former height, and 50% of the denuded villous surface area was covered in flattened epithelium within 6 hours. 836 Villous contraction appears to be regulated by enteric nerves, because inhibition of enteric nerve conduction prevents villous shortening following injury. The contractile component of the villus is a network of myofibroblasts distributed throughout the lamina propria of the villus and along the central lacteal. Inhibition of villous contraction results in retarded epithelial repair because of the larger denuded surface that remains to be covered by migrating epithelium compared with similarly injured villi that have contracted. 837 PGE 2 has also been implicated in regulating villous contraction, because application of PGE 2 resulted in villous contraction when perfused through normal rat ileum. 889 As villi contract, assuming there is an intact basement membrane, epithelium from the margins of the wound migrates in a centripetal direction to resurface toward the tip of the villus. 837 The process of restitution is similar in denuded colonic mucosa, except that it may proceed more rapidly because of the lack of villi. 207 Epithelial restitution is solely a migratory event that does not depend on provision of new enterocytes by proliferation. Cellular migration is initiated by extension of cellular lamellipodia that receive signals from the basement membrane via integrins. Intracellular signaling converges on the actin cytoskeleton, which is responsible for movement of lamellipodia. Specific components of the basement membrane appear to be critical to the migratory process. For example, application of antibodies to collagen types III and IV, which are important components of intestinal mucosal basement membrane, impeded epithelial restitution. 890, 891 Other elements of the basement membrane, including proteoglycans, hyaluronic acid, and noncollagenous proteins, such as fibronectin and laminin, may also provide important signals. 892 The subepithelial matrix components that facilitate restitution may form the basis for clinical treatments designed to speed up the repair process, analogous to the administration of matrix components to horses with articular cartilage damage.",

            "text": "Although epithelial restitution results in gross closure of previously denuded regions of gastrointestinal mucosa, the closure of interepithelial spaces is ultimately required to restore normal epithelial barrier resistance. 893 Because the tight junction is principally responsible for regulating the permeability of the interepithelial space, it is likely that repair and closure of this structure is critical to restore intestinal barrier function. Recent research indicates that prostaglandins play a vital role in the recovery of tight junction resistance, 893 indicating that the administration of nonselective COX inhibitors to horses with colic, particularly those recovering from strangulating obstruction, may be deleterious. Judicious use of NSAIDs is appropriate until more selective drugs that allow continued production of reparative prostaglandins are available for use in horses. Recent studies have shown that NSAIDs preferential for COX-2 allow for optimal repair of injured intestine compared with traditional nonselective NSAIDs. 392 Once the epithelial barrier has been restored, normal mucosal architecture must be reestablished to allow normal gut absorptive and digestive function. In porcine ileum subjected to 2 hours of ischemia, the epithelial barrier was restored within 18 hours, but villi were contracted and covered in epithelium with a squamous appearance. Restoration of normal villous architecture required a further 4 days. 836 The flattened villous epithelium that characterizes restitution is replaced by newly proliferated crypt epithelium. Under normal circumstances, new enterocytes are formed by the division of stem cells, of which there are approximately four at the base of each mucosal crypt. Newly divided enterocytes migrate from the crypt onto the villus. 894 During migration, enterocytes differentiate and acquire specific absorptive and digestive functions. Fully differentiated enterocytes reside on the upper third of the villus for 2 to 3 days and are then sloughed into the intestinal lumen. 895 This process is accelerated during mucosal repair, which requires increased proliferative rates. Increased proliferation may be stimulated within 12 to 18 hours by a variety of locally available gutderived factors, including luminal nutrients, polyamines, and growth factors. 836 The return of the normal leaf-like shape of the villus occurs subsequent to the appearance of normal columnar epithelium.",

One study implicated prostaglandins in growth factor-stimulated restitution, 896 but a more prominent role of prostaglandins in mucosal repair is their ability to close interepithelial tight junctions. 893, 897, 898 For instance, ischemic-injured small intestine rapidly recovered barrier function (as measured in vitro as transepithelial resistance) in the presence of prostaglandins I 2 and E 2 , despite the fact that these prostanoids had relatively little effect on villous contraction and epithelial restitution. However, electron microscopic examination of tissues reveals dilation of tight junctions in tissues treated with NSAIDs, 898 whereas those additionally treated with prostaglandins have closely apposed tight junctions (Fig. 12.10) . Prostaglandins stimulate closure of tight junctions via the second messengers cAMP and Ca 2+ , 893 which interestingly were among the first mediators found to modulate tight junction permeability. 899, 900 Such tight junction closure is of considerable importance to patients with intestinal injury that are treated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, because reduced prostaglandin levels may result in increased intestinal permeability. For example, in a study on ischemic-injured porcine ileum, treatment with the NSAID indomethacin resulted in a significant increase in intestinal permeability to inulin and lipopolysaccharide compared with tissues that were additionally treated with PGI 2 and PGE 2 . 893",

            "text": "The process of restitution is absolutely dependent on a group of compounds called polyamines. 901, 902 The rate-limiting enzyme in the formation of the polyamines spermine, spermidine, and putrescine is ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). In rats with stress-induced duodenal ulcers, systemic administration of the ODC inhibitor dl-alpha-difluoromethyl ornithine significantly reduced polyamine levels and markedly reduced epithelial restitution. Intragastric treatment of these same rats with putrescine, spermidine, and spermine prevented the delayed mucosal repair induced by dl-alpha-difluoromethylornithine. 901 Interestingly, gastric tissue levels of ODC were increased in rats with stress-induced gastric ulcers, suggesting that polyamine production is enhanced during tissue injury and may contribute to the normal rapid rate of epithelial restitution. 903 The mechanisms by which polyamines stimulate epithelial restitution are not clear. McCormack et al. hypothesized that polyamines increased transglutaminase activity, an enzyme that catalyzes the cross-linking of cytoskeletal and basement membrane proteins. 904 Further investigation of the role of polyamines in IEC-6 cell migration showed that depletion of polyamines resulted in disruption of the cytoskeleton and reduced the physical extension of lamellipodia. 905 More recent studies have clarified this pathway. Polyamines regulate cytoskeletal cellular migration via activation of the small GTPase Rho-A by elevating intracellular Ca 2+ levels. These elevations in Ca 2+ result from polyamine regulation of expression of voltage-gated K + channels and altered membrane electrical potential. 906 Polyamines also play a role in the normal physiologic regulation of crypt cell proliferation and differentiation. 907, 908 They are produced by fully differentiated enterocytes at the villous tip and may reach the crypt either within sloughed luminal epithelium or via local villous circulation. 909 Following intestinal injury, polyamines appear to stimulate enhanced proliferation by increasing the expression of protooncogenes, which control the cell cycle. 910 The mechanism by which polyamines influence gene expression likely relates to the cationic nature of these compounds, which may influence the tertiary structure of negatively charged DNA and RNA. 901",

The most important of these growth factors in early mucosal repair events is TGF-\u03b2, which is a potent stimulus of epithelial restitution and modulator of the ECM. 821 Neutralization of TGF-\u03b2 retards epithelial migration in vitro, and it appears that TGF-\u03b2 may serve as a point of convergence for mediators of restitution, because neutralizing TGF-\u03b2 also inhibits the effects of other peptides. However, TGF-\u03b2 paradoxically inhibits epithelial proliferation, reducing the supply of new enterocytes for mucosal repair. Conversely, EGF, produced by the salivary glands and duodenal Brunner's glands, and the related TGF-\u03b1, produced by small intestinal enterocytes, are potent stimulants of enterocyte proliferation. These growth factors share approximately 30% of their amino acid structure, bind to the same receptor on the basolateral surface of enterocytes, and are not related to TGF-\u03b2. 911 The physiologic role of EGF is somewhat difficult to discern because it is present in the intestinal lumen, with no apparent access to its basally located receptor. 912 It has been proposed that EGF acts as a \"surveillance agent\" that gains access to its receptor during epithelial injury (when the EGF receptor would likely be exposed) to stimulate proliferation. 912 TGF-\u03b1 presumably has a similar role, but it is present in greater concentrations in the small intestine because it is produced by differentiated villous enterocytes. The mature peptide is cleaved from the extracellular component of the transmembrane TGF-\u03b1 precursor and released into the lumen. 911",

Under physiologic conditions, trefoil peptides are secreted by mucusproducing cells at distinct anatomic sites. For example, the trefoil peptide pS2 is produced by gastric epithelium, whereas ITF is produced by small and large intestinal mucosa. 701 However, any of the trefoil peptides may be upregulated within repairing epithelium regardless of the anatomic site. 821, 913 In addition, trefoil peptides have the ability to induce their own expression, amplifying the level of these reparative factors at sites of mucosal repair. 914 Trefoil peptides are the most potent stimulants of epithelial migration in vitro, and their effects are independent of growth factors, including TGF-\u03b2. 915 Recent evidence suggests that EGF receptor activation is required for the induction of pS2 and another of the trefoil peptides called spasmolytic peptide in gastric epithelium in vitro. The importance of trefoil peptides to the mucosal repair response in vivo is illustrated by gene knockout studies, in which mice deficient in ITF have a dramatically reduced ability to repair intestinal injury. 916 Detergent-induced mucosal injury was lethal because of a lack of restitution compared with wild-type mice that fully recovered from similar mucosal injury. The fact that restitution was restored by administration of ITF has important therapeutic implications. The mechanism by which trefoil peptides stimulate epithelial migration has yet to be fully characterized, but it appears to involve translocation of the adherens junction protein E-cadherin, allowing cells to become untethered from neighboring cells. 821",

Additional factors that influence the net transit of digesta include gravity, the volume and viscosity of the contents, and pressure gradients created by simultaneous contraction and relaxation of adjacent segments of bowel. Casual use of the term intestinal motility in veterinary medicine often underestimates the complexity of the processes involved in the transit of intestinal contents. This is particularly true when the term is used to describe the frequency and or intensity of intestinal sounds, or borborygmi. The existence of borborygmi does not always equate with progressive movement of intestinal contents.",

[936] [937] [938] The condition most commonly occurs after general anesthesia and extraabdominal surgery, particularly orthopedic and upper airway procedures, and often is categorized as a form of POI. Other cases occur spontaneously, often in animals with painful primary conditions such as uveitis or septic tenosynovitis. In a study of 114 horses diagnosed with cecal impaction, 12 were hospitalized for a condition other than colic at the time of diagnosis, and 9 others were being treated with phenylbutazone, most for a musculoskeletal injury. 939 Eight of the 114 horses had undergone general anesthesia in the 8 days preceding diagnosis. The syndrome is frustrating in that clinical signs are often subtle unless cecal perforation has occurred. In horses with a cecal emptying defect after anesthesia, overt signs are usually apparent 3 to 5 days after the procedure. The earliest detectable signs include depression and a reduction in feed intake and fecal output. Ineffective emptying results in overfilling of the cecum with moist contents, which is manifested by signs of mild to moderate colic. If the condition is recognized late or untreated, the cecum may rupture and result in fatal peritonitis.",

            "text": "Current understanding of motility throughout the equine gastrointestinal tract is remarkably limited, and much of our presumptive knowledge comes from work in other species. The ENS is involved in all aspects of motility, either directly via neurotransmitters or indirectly via interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) or immune or endocrine regulation. The inherent rhythmicity of electric activity in the intestine is controlled by the ICC, which is specialized cells that are electrically coupled to myocytes via gap junctions. 940 These cells are responsible for generating and propagating slow-wave activity; hence, they are deemed the pacemaker cells of the intestine. A decrease in ICC density has been observed in horses with obstructive disorders of the large intestine 941 and in the ileum and pelvic flexure of horses diagnosed with equine grass sickness (dysautonomia), 942 although such a decrease was not evident in a horse with dysautonomia that recovered. 943 This alteration in ICC infrastructure appears to result in reduced slow-wave activity in vitro. 944 The ENS primarily controls and coordinates intestinal contraction. A combination of central and autonomic innervation influences events, but contraction does not require external neural input. The parasympathetic supply to the gastrointestinal tract is via the vagus and pelvic nerves, and the sympathetic supply is through postganglionic fibers of the cranial and caudal mesenteric plexuses. A complex network of interneurons within each plexus integrates and amplifies neural input; the intensity and frequency of resultant smooth muscle contractions are proportional to the amount of sympathetic and parasympathetic input. Additional binding sites for a number of other endogenous chemicals, including dopamine, motilin, and serotonin, exist within the ENS and on smooth muscle cells. 945 Acetylcholine is the dominant excitatory neurotransmitter in the gastrointestinal tract and exerts its action through muscarinic type 2 receptors on smooth muscle cells. Sympathetic fibers innervating the gastrointestinal tract are adrenergic, postganglionic fibers with cell bodies located in the prevertebral ganglia. Activation of \u03b1 2 -adrenergic receptors on cholinergic neurons within enteric ganglia inhibits the release of acetylcholine, reducing intestinal contraction. \u03b2 1 -, \u03b2 2 -, and \u03b2-atypical receptors are directly inhibitory to the intestinal smooth muscle. 946 Inhibitory nonadrenergic, noncholinergic neurotransmitters include adenosine triphosphate, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and nitric oxide. 947, 948 These neurotransmitters are critical for mediating descending inhibition during peristalsis and receptive relaxation. Substance P is a nonadrenergic, noncholinergic neurotransmitter that may be involved in contraction of the large colon. 949, 950 The rate and force of intestinal contractions along the small intestine and large colon of the horse are important determinants of intestinal motility; of even greater importance to the net propulsion of digesta are the cyclical patterns of contractile activity. These patterns are known as the small intestinal and colonic migrating motility (or myoelectric) complexes (MMCs). 951, 952 The colonic complex usually originates in the right ventral colon and variably traverses the ascending and descending colons. Many of these complexes are related temporally to a specialized motility event of the ileum, the migrating action potential complex. 953 ",

In rodents, simple intestinal manipulation causes a cascade of inflammation within the muscularis, resulting in leukocyte infiltration and subsequent suppression of muscle contractility. Similar inflammatory effects were evident with mechanical manipulation of the equine jejunum. 956 The inflammatory response to bowel manipulation is not limited to the affected tissue, but it can also result in global inflammation and ileus throughout the gastrointestinal tract. 957 The associated inflammatory events are extremely complex, involving a milieu of proinflammatory cytokines, prostaglandins, and leukocytes. Depletion or inactivation of muscularis macrophage function can prevent inflammation associated with intestinal manipulation and associated decreased contractility. 958 Mast cell activation is involved in intestinal manipulation-associated POI in humans. 959 Inflammation associated with colonic manipulation may involve gut-derived bacterial products. 960 Another factor in the development of intestinal stasis after inflammation is the local overproduction of nitric oxide caused by the upregulation of iNOS by resident macrophages. 961 The iNOS upregulation was important for initiation of the inflammatory response and inhibition of motility. Nitric oxide is a key inhibitory neurotransmitter of the nonadrenergic, noncholinergic system. 948 In the horse, significant neutrophilic inflammation is apparent in the jejunum from clinical cases necessitating resection and following a period of recovery in the jejunum subjected to 1 or 2 hours of ischemia. 962 The ischemic tissue also had evidence of leukocyte activation, as demonstrated by calprotectin-positive cells in associated tissue histologically.",

Morphine administration decreased frequency of defecation and fecal moisture content while increasing gastrointestinal transit time in normal horses at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg twice daily for 6 days. 970 Single doses of fentanyl or morphine decrease jejunal and colonic MMC activity in ponies, whereas the antagonist naloxone elicited increased propulsive activity in the colon. 971 Fentanyl administered as an IV constant rate infusion did not have an apparent deleterious effect on duodenal motility. 972 Butorphanol, an opioid agonistantagonist, decreases myoelectrical activity in the jejunum but not pelvic flexure. 973 In another series of experiments, butorphanol alone did not decrease gastric or duodenal motility, 974 but administration in combination with xylazine resulted in a synergistic inhibitory effect, which was more pronounced than that obtained by administration of xylazine alone. 968 Administration of butorphanol as a constant rate infusion appears to have a minimal to no effect on global gastrointestinal 470, 975 or duodenal motility. 976 When lidocaine, ketamine, and butorphanol were administered alone or in combination as constant rate infusions to healthy horses, combinations containing butorphanol (butorphanol/lidocaine, or a combination of all three drugs) delayed total gastrointestinal transit time. 977 N-Butylscopolammonium bromide has a profound but very short-lived negative effect on duodenal motility, but this effect was not significant between groups. 976 Atropine is a postganglionic blocking agent that binds to muscarinic receptors. When administered at 0.04 mg/kg, atropine inhibits individual small intestinal, cecal, and colonic contractions for about 120 minutes but suppresses small intestinal and colonic migrating complexes for up to 8 hours. 978",

Consequently, the efferent limb of the reflex expresses increased sympathetic outflow, primarily mediated through stimulation of \u03b1 2 -adrenoreceptors, and inhibition of acetylcholine release, which provides the rationale for \u03b1 2 -blockade in treating ileus. Intraluminal infusion of capsaicin before abdominal surgery ameliorated the severity of POI in experimental rats.

Mild to moderate distention of the bowel, such as that occurring in the early stages of an intraluminal obstruction, evokes an increase in local contractile activity. 982, 983 Excessive distention results in the inhibition of motility within the distended segment of bowel. Intestinal stasis is not always detrimental and under certain conditions may be protective. Repeated distention for determination of nociceptive threshold results in an overall decrease in duodenal motility over time, irrespective of other interventions. 972, 976 Endotoxin Endotoxemia is a clinical feature of many diseases of the equine gastrointestinal tract, and endotoxins independently can exert a negative effect on intestinal motility and transit. 214 A variety of mediators likely are involved, but the activation of \u03b1 2adrenoreceptors and production of prostanoids appear to be important, because pretreatment with yohimbine or NSAIDs (phenylbutazone or flunixin), respectively, ameliorates the inhibitory effects of experimental endotoxin infusion. 201, [984] [985] [986] Pretreatment with metoclopramide or cisapride had a similar effect. 71, 987 Endotoxin infusion induced an inflammatory response in the intestine of rats that mimicked the response induced by handling during laparotomy. 988 The similarity of the responses was highlighted in a recent study that demonstrated that prior exposure of the muscularis to endotoxin protected the intestine from the effects of manipulation. 989 In rats, colonic manipulation alone causes transference of intraluminal LPS to the muscularis, which likely contributes to the global gastrointestinal inflammatory response and decrease in contractility associated with tissue manipulation. 960 In response to endotoxin alone, the inflammatory response within the jejunal muscularis is predominantly monocytic, whereas the response to polymicrobial sepsis is predominantly neutrophilic. 990",

This syndrome may best mimic POI in human beings, which is generally considered a large intestinal disorder. An important difference in horses is that laparotomy is a rare predisposing factor, and most cases occur in horses undergoing routine extraabdominal surgical procedures. The disorder, therefore, is probably not appropriately considered as a form of POI in horses. General anesthesia itself is a potent inhibitor of gastrointestinal motility in horses, but these effects are short-lived and reversible within hours of anesthetic withdrawal. 952 The return of normal motility in horses after experimental ileus was most delayed in the cecum, suggesting that this may be a common site of ileus in horses. 992 A link between routine postoperative medications, such as phenylbutazone and aminoglycoside antibiotics, has been suspected but not established. An inhibitory effect of NSAIDs on large colon contractility has been demonstrated using in vitro techniques. 993 Primary sympathetic overstimulation could be involved, because many of the affected animals are young, male horses or animals with painful diseases.",

Abdominal ultrasound in horses with ileus typically reveals mild to moderately fluid-filled hypomotile to immotile small intestine, without alteration in the amount or character of PF or small intestinal wall thickness. Horses with reflux from other causes (peritonitis and mechanical obstruction) will have changes reflective of their disease process. This differentiation is important for appropriate case management, because horses with a mechanical obstruction often need either primary or repeat laparotomy, which should not be delayed.",

Calculation of the volume of fluid to be administered should include maintenance requirements plus an estimate of losses, especially those lost through gastric decompression.

Horses with primary cecal impaction or impaction caused by an emptying defect may require surgery to prevent fatal rupture. The surgical management of these cases is controversial and may include typhlotomy alone, typhlotomy with a bypass procedure such as ileocolic or jejunocolic anastomosis, or a bypass without typhlotomy. 1000 Most horses that undergo simple typhlotomy have an uneventful recovery. 1001 In a large retrospective study, 44/54 horses treated medically survived to discharge, whereas 37 of 49 horses treated surgically were allowed to recover, 35 of which survived to discharge. 939 Ileocolostomy was only performed in two of the 37 horses treated surgically (one of which survived to discharge), with the remainder receiving typhlotomy without bypass. Survival to 1 year was not statistically different between horses treated medically (18/19) or surgically (25/28), although 6 horses had a recurrence of cecal impaction. 939 Experimental and anecdotal evidence provides a strong rationale for using antiinflammatory drugs to prevent and treat gastrointestinal ileus, particularly in animals that may have endotoxemia. 1002 Flunixin meglumine is used widely in equine practice as an analgesic and antiinflammatory agent, and it ameliorates many of the adverse systemic effects of endotoxin, particularly those on the cardiovascular system. A potential negative effect of NSAIDs on large intestinal contractility has been suggested. A differential effect on contractility between selective and nonselective COX inhibitors is currently unknown. Broadspectrum antimicrobials are indicated when one suspects sepsis or in cases of profound neutropenia. High concentrations of aminoglycoside antimicrobials inhibited intestinal contractions in exposed sections of intestine in vitro, but this inhibitory effect is unlikely to occur at clinically relevant doses. 1003 Motility-enhancing drugs have been advocated to treat gastrointestinal ileus. Unfortunately, information directly pertinent to horses is limited and must be extrapolated cautiously from that of other species because of the differences in intestinal anatomy and physiology. Prokinetic drugs potentially can shorten the length of hospitalization, reducing the cost of treatment and the number of potential complications such as weight loss, thrombophlebitis, and laminitis. Experimental evidence indicates that prokinetic drugs can minimize the development of postoperative abdominal adhesions. 1004 Most prokinetic drugs require a healthy gut wall to enhance intestinal contraction, and downregulation of motilin receptors has been demonstrated in the inflamed equine jejunum. 473 Therefore one should not assume that many of these drugs would be effective in the presence of an inflammatory injury such as that which can occur after intestinal manipulation at surgery or that associated with DPJ.",

In contrast to newer generation benzamides, metoclopramide is also an antagonist at dopamine 1 (DA1) and dopamine 2 (DA2) receptors. Antagonism of prejunctional DA2 receptors facilitates acetylcholine release and smooth muscle contraction. Metoclopramide crosses the blood-brain barrier, where its antagonist properties on central DA2 receptors can result in extrapyramidal signs, including seizure. Metoclopramide increased contractility of muscle strips in vitro in the pyloric antrum, proximal duodenum, and midjejunum. 1008 These in vitro data support previous work in which metoclopramide administration restored gastroduodenal coordination of motility in a model of POI. 1009 In another study, metoclopramide had no effect on jejunal or pelvic flexure myoelectrical activity. 973 Constant IV infusion (0.04 mg/kg/h) of metoclopramide was well tolerated in a population of postoperative horses and significantly decreased the volume and duration of gastric reflux over control and intermittent drug infusion groups. 1010 Cisapride is a second-generation benzamide that acts as a 5HT-4 agonist and 5HT-3-receptor antagonist but is without antidopaminergic action. Stimulation of 5HT-4 receptors within the ENS enhances release of acetylcholine from the myenteric plexus. Several reports suggest the efficacy of cisapride in managing intestinal disease in horses, including the resolution of persistent large colon impaction, treatment of equine grass sickness, and as a preventative for POI in horses after small intestinal surgery (0.1 mg/kg body mass intramuscularly during the postoperative period). [1011] [1012] [1013] [1014] The horse erratically absorbs tablets administered rectally, but a method for preparing a parenteral form of the drug from tablets has been described. 1015 Cisapride has the potential to cause adverse cardiac side effects mediated through blockage of the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current that include lengthening of the QT interval and development of torsades de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. 1016 These adverse effects have resulted in withdrawal of the drug in the United States but have not been reported in the horse.",

This dosage did not alter MMC duration or spiking activity, reset the MMC in the jejunum in clinically normal horses 1031 or significantly alter a variety of indicators of POI after colic surgery. 1032 Significantly more horses with POI stopped refluxing within 30 hours following the institution of lidocaine infusion, relative to saline infusion. 475 Lidocaine administration did not affect the prevalence of POI, duration or volume of reflux, or survival in horses requiring surgery for treatment of small intestinal colic. 1033 Lidocaine infusion can be associated with reversible side effects that include muscle fasciculations, ataxia, and seizure.

Although strangulation of the intestinal lumen g Previous version by Anthony T. Blikslager. results in clinical signs similar to those of simple obstruction, occlusion of the blood supply results in a more rapid deterioration of the intestinal mucosa and subsequent onset of sepsis. Although there has been a great deal of interest in the relevance and treatment of intestinal reperfusion injury, 851, 861, 882 the lesion that develops during strangulation is often severe, leaving little viable bowel for further injury during reperfusion. 882 Although extensive lengths of strangulated small intestine may be resected, strangulation of the large colon presents a much greater treatment dilemma because strangulated intestine usually extends beyond the limits of surgical resection. 1035 Therefore horses with large intestinal strangulation are often recovered with extensive intestinal injury left in place. As a result, subtle degrees of reperfusion injury may be very important in horses with large colon disease, warranting further work in this area in an attempt to reduce mortality. 851 Strangulating obstruction may be divided into hemorrhagic and ischemic forms. 163 In hemorrhagic strangulating obstruction, which is most common, the veins become occluded before the arteries because of the greater stiffness of arterial walls. This lesion is noted by a darkened appearance in affected bowel and increased thickness as blood is pumped into the lesion. Ischemic strangulating obstruction occurs if the intestine is twisted tightly enough to simultaneously occlude both arteries and veins. In the case of the colon, some researchers suggest that this may be determined by how much ingesta is in the colon, because intestinal contents may prevent the intestine from twisting tightly. 1036 Tissue involved in ischemic strangulating obstruction appears pale and of normal or reduced thickness because of a complete lack of blood flow ( Fig. 12.11 ). Bowel peripheral to strangulating lesions may also become injured as a result of distention, which reduces mural blood flow once it reaches critical levels. As this intestine is decompressed, it may also undergo reperfusion injury. 879, 1037, 1038 ",

These latter findings are variable, depending on the duration and location of the obstruction. For example, horses with ileal obstructions tend to reflux later in the course of the disease process than horses with jejunal obstructions. A horse that has an entrapment of small intestine in the epiploic foramen or a rent in the proximal small intestinal mesentery may not have palpable loops of small intestine because of the cranial location of these structures. 1039 Abdominocentesis can provide critical information on the integrity of the intestine and is indicated in horses with suspected strangulation of the small intestine. Affected horses typically have serosanguineous abdominal fluid with an elevated protein concentration (>2.5 mg/dL) and an increase in PF:plasma lactate, although these cases must be differentiated from proximal enteritis. 11, 22, 783 When an initial sample is inconclusive, repeated measurement of PF lactate may provide additional support for a diagnosis of a strangulating lesion. 27 Generally, horses with small intestinal strangulation show continued signs of abdominal pain, whereas horses with proximal enteritis (discussed in Duodenitis-Proximal Jejunitis previously in this chapter) tend to be depressed after initial episodes of mild abdominal pain. 1040 In addition, horses with small intestinal strangulation continue to deteriorate clinically despite appropriate medical therapy and begin to show elevated WBC counts (>10,000 cells/\u03bcL) in the abdominal fluid as the duration of strangulation increases. There are horses in which small intestinal strangulation and proximal enteritis cannot be not readily distinguished, at which point surgery may be elected rather than prolonging the decision to perform abdominal exploration on a horse with a potential strangulating lesion. 1040",

It is bounded dorsally by the caudate process of the liver and caudal vena cava and ventrally by the pancreas, the hepatoduodenal ligament, and the portal vein. 1039 Intestine may enter the foramen from the visceral surface of the liver toward the right body wall or the opposite direction. Studies differ as to which is the most common form. In the case of entrapments that enter the foramen in a left-to-right direction, the omental bursa is ruptured as the intestine migrates through the epiploic foramen, which may contribute to the intraabdominal hemorrhage often seen with this condition. Clinical signs include acute onset of severe colic with examination findings compatible with small intestinal obstruction. The stereotypic behavior of crib biting is a significant risk factor for EFE, 1051 possibly because of changes in abdominal pressure as the horse prepares the esophagus to ingest air. Other risk factors include increased height of the horse and previous colic surgery. 1051 The condition was once believed to be more prevalent in older horses, 1039 but this has been refuted. 1051 The disorder has also been recognized in foals as young as 4 months of age. 1052 The diagnosis is definitively made at surgery, although ultrasonographic findings of distended loops of edematous small intestine adjacent to the right middle body wall are suggestive of EFE. 1039 Generally, thickened, immotile intestine on ultrasonographic examination is highly predictive for small intestinal strangulating obstruction. 1053, 1054 Small intestine entrapped in the epiploic foramen may be limited to a portion of the intestinal wall (parietal hernia), 1055 and the large colon may become entrapped within the epiploic foramen. 1051 In treating EFE, the epiploic foramen must not be enlarged either by blunt force or with a sharp instrument, because rupture of the vena cava or portal vein and fatal hemorrhage may occur. Prognosis has substantially improved over the past decade, with current short-term survival rates (discharge from the hospital) ranging from 74% to 95%. 1039, [1049] [1050] [1051] 1056 Survival to 1 year (50.6%) and 2 years (34.3%) postoperatively declines substantially, with a median survival time of 397 days in one report. 1051 Preoperative abdominocentesis, 1039 ",

Small intestinal volvulus is theoretically initiated by a change in local peristalsis or the occurrence of a lesion around which the intestine and its mesentery may twist (e.g., an ascarid impaction). 1060 It is reportedly one of the most commonly diagnosed causes of small intestinal obstruction in foals. 1061, 1062 It has been theorized that young foals may be at risk for small intestinal volvulus because of changing feed habits and adaptation to a bulkier adult diet. Onset of acute, severe colic; a distended abdomen; and radiographic evidence of multiple loops of distended small intestine in a young foal would be suggestive of small intestine volvulus. However, it is not possible to differentiate volvulus from other causes of small intestinal obstruction preoperatively. In adult horses volvulus frequently occurs in association with another disease process, during which small intestinal obstruction results in distention and subsequent rotation of the small intestinal around the root of the mesentery. Although any segment of the small intestine may be involved, the distal jejunum and ileum are most frequently affected because of their relatively longer mesenteries. 1060 The diagnosis is made at surgery by palpating a twist at the origin of the cranial mesenteric artery. Treatment includes resection of devitalized bowel, which may not be an option because of the extent of small intestinal involvement (similar to large colon volvulus). Prognosis is based on the extent of small intestine involved and its appearance after surgical correction of the lesion. Generally, horses in which more than 50% of the small intestine is devitalized are considered to have a grave prognosis. 1063",

The nature of the hernia (direct versus indirect) is determined on the basis of the integrity of the parietal vaginal tunic. In horses in which the bowel remains within the parietal vaginal tunic, the hernia is referred to as indirect because, strictly speaking, the bowel remains within the peritoneal cavity. Direct hernias are those in which strangulated bowel ruptures through the parietal vaginal tunic and occupies an SC location. These direct hernias most commonly occur in foals and should be suspected when a congenital inguinal hernia is associated with colic, swelling that extends from the inguinal region of the prepuce, and intestine that may be palpated SC. 1067, 1068 Although most congenital indirect inguinal hernias resolve with repeated manual reduction or application of a diaper, surgical intervention is recommended for congenital direct hernias. 1068 Historical findings in horses with strangulating inguinal hernias include acute onset of colic in a stallion that had recently been used for breeding. A cardinal sign of inguinal herniation is a cool, enlarged testicle on one side of the scrotum. [1069] [1070] [1071] However, inguinal hernias, including of the large colon, have also been reported in geldings. 1072, 1073 Inguinal hernias can be detected on rectal palpation, and manipulation of herniated bowel per rectum has been used to reduce a hernia, but this procedure is not recommended because of the risk of rectal tears. In many horses the short segment of herniated intestine will markedly improve in appearance once it has been reduced and does not always have to be resected. 1074 The affected testicle will be congested because of vascular compromise within the spermatic cord, and although it may remain viable, it is generally recommended that it be resected. 1074 The prognosis in adult horses is good, with up to 75% of horses surviving to 6 months of age. [1069] [1070] [1071] Horses that have been treated for inguinal hernias may be used for breeding. In these horses the remaining testicle will have increased sperm production, although an increased number of sperm abnormalities will be noticed after surgery because of edema and increased temperature of the scrotum.",

            "text": "An intussusception involves a segment of bowel (intussusceptum) that invaginates into an adjacent aboral segment of bowel (intussuscipiens). The reason for such invagination is not always clear, but it may involve a lesion at the leading edge of the intussusception, including small masses, foreign bodies, or parasites. In particular, tapeworms (Anoplocephala perfoliata) have been implicated. 1077 Ileocecal intussusceptions are the most common intestinal intussusceptions in the horse and typically affect young animals. In one study evaluating 26 cases of ileocecal intussusception, the median age of affected horses was 1 year. 1078 Acute ileocecal intussusceptions are those in which the horses have a duration of colic of less than 24 hours and involve variable lengths of intestine, which ranged in one study from 6 cm to 457 cm in length. In acute cases the involved segment of ileum typically has a compromised blood supply. Chronic ileocecal intussusceptions typically involve short segments of ileum (up to 10 cm in length), and the ileal blood supply is frequently intact. 1078 Abdominocentesis results are variable because strangulated bowel is contained within the adjacent bowel. There is often evidence of obstruction of the small intestine, including nasogastric reflux and multiple distended loops of small intestine on rectal palpation. Horses with chronic ileocecal intussusceptions have mild, intermittent colic, often without evidence of small intestinal obstruction. In one study a mass was palpated in the region of the cecal base in approximately 50% of affected horses. 1078 Transabdominal ultrasound may be helpful in discerning the nature of the mass. The intussusception has a characteristic target appearance on cross section [1079] [1080] [1081] and has been reported as a frequent incidental finding in Standardbred foals. 1082 Other segments of the small intestine may also be intussuscepted, including the jejunum (Fig. 12.12) . In one study of 11 jejunojejunal intussusceptions, the length of bowel involved ranged between 0.4 and 9.1 m. 1083 Attempts at reducing intussusceptions at surgery are usually futile because of intramural swelling of affected bowel. Jejunojejunal intussusceptions should be resected.",

            "text": "Herniation of intestine through a rent in the diaphragm is rare in the horse. Any segment of bowel may be involved, although small intestine is most frequently herniated. 1085 Diaphragmatic rents may be congenital or acquired, but acquired hernias are more common. 1085 Congenital rents may result from incomplete fusion of any of the four embryonic components of the diaphragm: pleuroperitoneal membranes, transverse septum, body wall, and esophageal mesentery. 1085 Abdominal compression of the foal at parturition may result in a congenital hernia. 1085 Acquired hernias are presumed to result from trauma to the chest or a sudden increase in intraabdominal pressure, such as might occur during parturition, distention of the abdomen, a sudden fall, and strenuous exercise. 1086 Hernias have been described in a number of different locations; large congenital hernias are typically present at the ventralmost aspect of the diaphragm, and most acquired hernias are located at the junction of the muscular and tendinous portions of the diaphragm. 1085 A peritoneopericardial hernia has been documented in at least one horse. 1087 The clinical signs are usually associated with intestinal obstruction rather than respiratory distress. 1086 Careful auscultation may reveal an area of decreased lung sounds associated with obstructed intestine and increased fluid within the chest cavity. 1088 Such signs may prompt thoracic radiography or ultrasound, both of which can be used to make a diagnosis. Auscultation may also reveal thoracic intestinal sounds, but it is typically not possible to differentiate these from sounds referred from the abdomen. In one report, two of three horses diagnosed with small intestinal strangulation by diaphragmatic hernia had respiratory acidemia, attributable to decreased ventilation. 1089 Treatment of horses with diaphragmatic hernia is fraught with complications because of the need to reduce and resect strangulated bowel and the need to repair the defect in the diaphragm; prognosis has not appeared to improve over time. [1089] [1090] [1091] [1092] Because dorsal defects in the diaphragm are among the most common forms of diaphragmatic defect, it may not be possible to close the diaphragmatic hernia by way of the approach used for abdominal exploratory. Because herniation is likely to recur, it is appropriate to schedule a second surgery using an appropriate approach to resolve the diaphragmatic defect.",

            "text": "Horses with large colon volvulus have rapid onset of severe, unrelenting abdominal pain. Postpartum broodmares appear to be at risk for this form of colic. 1035 Once the large colon is strangulated (>270-degree volvulus), gas distention is marked, leading to gross distention of the abdomen, compromised respiration as the distended bowel presses up against the diaphragm, and visceral pooling of blood as the caudal vena cava is compressed. Horses with this condition are frequently refractory to even the most potent of analgesics. These horses may prefer to lie in dorsal recumbency, presumably to take weight off the strangulated colon. An abbreviated physical examination is warranted in these cases because the time from the onset of strangulation to surgical correction is critical. Under experimental conditions the colon is irreversibly damaged within 3 to 4 hours of a 360-degree volvulus of the entire colon. 855 Despite severe pain and hypovolemia, horses may have a paradoxically low heart rate, possibly related to increased vagal tone. Results of abdominocentesis often do not indicate the degree of colonic compromise, 1035, 1093 and in many cases it is not worth attempting to obtain abdominal fluid because of extreme colonic distention. 1093 Rectal palpation reveals severe gas distention of the large colon, frequently associated with colonic bands traversing the abdomen. Severe colonic distention may restrict access to the abdomen beyond the pelvic brim. One study has shown that plasma lactate levels below 6.0 mmol/L had a sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 83% in predicting survival in horses with large colon volvulus. 1094",

After correction of the volvulus, a determination must be made as to whether the colon has been irreversibly injured. This should be based on mucosal color and bleeding (if an enterotomy has been performed), palpation of a pulse in the colonic arteries, serosal color, and appearance of colonic motility. 1036 If the colon is judged to be irreversibly damaged, the feasibility of a large colon resection can be considered. Although 95% of the colon can be resected (that part of the colon distal to the level of the cecocolic fold), damage from the volvulus may exceed that which can be resected. In these cases surgeons may elect to resect as much damaged bowel as possible or advise euthanasia. 1036",

These conditions tend to occur in young horses (63% were younger than 3 years old in one study) and may be associated with intestinal tapeworms. 1099 Clinical signs are variable, including acute, severe colic, intermittent pain over a number of days, and chronic weight loss. 1099 These variable presentations likely relate to the degree to which the cecum has intussuscepted. Initially, the cecal tip inverts, creating a cecocecal intussusception, which does not obstruct the flow of ingesta. As the intussusception progresses, the cecum inverts into the right ventral colon (cecocolic intussusception), which obstructs the flow of ingesta and often causes severe colic (Fig.  12.13 ). The cause of abdominal pain is often difficult to differentiate in these cases, although it is sometimes possible to detect a mass on the right side of the abdomen by either rectal palpation or ultrasound examination. 1099 Treatment involves manual surgical reduction by retracting the intussusceptum directly or by way of an enterotomy in the right ventral colon. 1099, 1100 Sometimes the cecum cannot be readily reduced because of severe thickening, and in other cases surgical procedures result in fatal contamination.

Colocolic intussusceptions are exceptionally rare but have reportedly affected the pelvic flexure and the left colon. [1102] [1103] [1104] Although the condition is reportedly more common in young horses, 1102,1104 older horses may be affected. 1103 Clinical findings may include a palpable mass on the left side of the abdomen. 1102 Ultrasonography may also be useful. Treatment requires manual reduction of the intussusception at surgery or resection of affected bowel. Because the left colons can be extensively exteriorized and manipulated at surgery, the prognosis is fair. [1102] [1103] [1104] Y RECTAL PROLAPSE Rectal prolapse may occur secondary to any disease that causes tenesmus, including diarrhea, rectal neoplasia, and parasitism, 1105 or it can occur secondary to elevations in intraabdominal pressure during parturition or episodes of coughing. 1106 Rectal prolapse is classified into four categories (Table 12 .7) depending on the extent of prolapsed tissue and the level of severity. 1107 Type I rectal prolapse is most common and is characterized by a doughnut-shaped prolapse of rectal mucosa and submucosa (Fig. 12.14) . Type II prolapse involves full-thickness rectal tissue, and type III prolapse additionally has invagination of small colon into the rectum. Type IV prolapse involves intussusception of proximal rectum or small colon through the anus in the absence of prolapse of tissue at the mucocutaneous junction at the anus. 1107 These can be differentiated from other forms of prolapse by their appearance and a palpable trench between prolapsed tissue and the anus.",

If tenesmus persists, rectal mucosa can remain prolapsed. Rectal mucosa rapidly becomes congested and edematous under these conditions and should be treated with osmotic agents such as glycerin or magnesium sulfate and by massaging and reducing the prolapse. 1108 A purse-string suture may be necessary to keep the mucosa inside the rectum. Topical application of lidocaine solution or jelly, epidural anesthesia, and sedation may help reduce tenesmus that incites and exacerbates rectal prolapse. Similar treatments can be applied with type II rectal prolapses. However, these more severe prolapses may not be reducible without surgical resection of mucosa and submucosa from the prolapsed bowel. 1105, 1106 Types III and IV rectal prolapses are more serious injuries because the small colon is involved. 1109 In horses with type III prolapse, an abdominocentesis should be performed to determine whether the injury to the small colon has resulted in peritonitis. The small colon component should be reduced manually if possible, whereas prolapsed rectal tissue typically requires mucosal or submucosal resection. Surgical exploration of the abdomen should be performed to determine the status of the small colon, although serial abdominocenteses can be used in lieu of surgery to detect progressive necrosis of the bowel. Type IV prolapses are seen most commonly in horses with dystocia. 1106 This type of prolapse is almost always fatal because of stretching and tearing of mesenteric vasculature, with subsequent infarction of affected bowel. Euthanasia is often warranted on the basis of physical examination findings. Confirmation of severe small colon injury requires abdominal exploration using either a midline approach or laparoscopy. 1110 It is conceivable that a horse with a compromised small colon could undergo a colostomy of the proximal small colon, but the compromised small colon will typically necrose beyond that which can be resected using a midline abdominal approach. 1108",

Products that cause sudden ascarid death, including organophosphates, ivermectin, and pyrantel pamoate, have been incriminated in triggering acute intestinal obstruction by dead parasites. 1116 This is a particular problem with ascarids because of the relatively large size of the adult parasite. Clinical signs include acute onset of colic after administration of an anthelmintic and signs compatible with small intestinal obstruction, including nasogastric reflux. Occasionally, dead parasites are present in the reflux. The onset of the disease varies according to the degree of obstruction. 1116 A tentative diagnosis may be made on the basis of the history and signs referable to small intestinal obstruction. Abdominal ultrasound may indicate the presence of multiple loops of distended small intestine and can be used to estimate ascarid burden within the small intestine. 1117 Initial medical treatment should include pain management and supportive care. Surgical treatment may involve an enterotomy removal of ascarids, although manual reduction without enterotomy was associated with improved survival in one report. 1118 The prognosis is fair in cases that are rapidly addressed but poor in foals with evidence of hypovolemia and septic shock. In one study, long-term survival of 25 affected horses was 33%. 1116 Another reported 80% short-term survival and 60% survival to 1 year. 1118",

Although feeding of coastal Bermuda hay has been implicated in this regional distribution, 1115 it has been difficult to separate geographic location from regional hay sources as risk factors. 1119 Nonetheless, it is likely that feeding suboptimal quality coastal Bermuda hay puts horses at risk for ileal impaction, possibly because this type of hay may have a high fiber content and thin strands that can lead to premature swallowing. The relationship between fiber content and eating patterns is theoretical and remains to be proved. Sudden changes in feed from an alternative type of hay to coastal Bermuda hay likely put a horse at risk for ileal impaction. 1119 Studies in the United Kingdom have revealed tapeworm infection as an important risk factor for ileal impaction. Based on risk analysis, the data suggested that more than 80% of the ileal impaction cases studied were associated with serologic or fecal evidence of tapeworm infection. 1120 Because of the poor sensitivity of fecal analysis for tapeworms, a serologic test (ELISA) has been developed by Proudman et al. with a sensitivity of approximately 70% and a specificity of 95%. 1121, 1122 Clinical signs of horses with ileal impaction are typical for a horse with small intestinal obstruction, including onset of moderate to severe colic and rectally palpable loops of distended small intestine as the condition progresses. Because the ileum is the distal-most aspect of the small intestinal tract, nasogastric reflux may take a considerable time to develop and is found in only approximately 50% to 60% of horses requiring surgical correction of impacted ileum 1113, 1123 ; reflux is more likely in horses with ileal impaction taken to surgery. 1113 A definitive diagnosis is usually made at surgery, although an impacted ileum may on occasion be palpated rectally. 1114 Multiple loops of distended small intestine make the impaction difficult to palpate. More than 50% of ileal impactions may resolve with medical treatment. 1113 Most reports indicate a good to excellent prognosis for short-term survival 1113, 1115, 1123 with 1-year survival of 91% to 92% in horses treated surgically or medically. 1113",

            "text": "Ileal hypertrophy is a disorder in which the muscular layers (both circular and longitudinal) of the ileum thicken for unknown reasons (idiopathic) or secondary to an incomplete or functional obstruction. A proposed mechanism for idiopathic ileal hypertrophy is parasympathetic neural dysfunction resulting in chronically increased muscle tone and subsequent hypertrophy of the muscular layers of the ileal wall. Such neural dysfunction possibly results from parasite migration. 1124 Alternative hypotheses include chronic increases in the muscular tone of the ileocecal valve, leading to muscular hypertrophy of the ileum as it contracts against a partially occluded ileocecal valve. The jejunum may also be hypertrophied, either alone or in combination with the ileum. 1124 Clinical signs include chronic intermittent colic as the ileum hypertrophies and gradually occludes the lumen. Partial anorexia and chronic weight loss (1-6 months) were documented in 45% of affected horses, most likely because of intermittent colic and reduced appetite. 1124 Because the ileal mucosa is not affected by this condition, there is no reason to believe that these horses experience malabsorption of nutrients. The diagnosis is usually made at surgery, although the hypertrophied ileum may be palpated rectally in some cases. 1124 An ileocecal or jejunocecal anastomosis to bypass the hypertrophied ileum is usually performed in affected horses. Without surgical bypass intermittent colic persists, and the thickened ileum may ultimately rupture. 1124 The prognosis is fair with surgical treatment. 1125 Secondary ileal hypertrophy is most commonly noted in horses that have previously had colic surgery and that may have a partial or functional obstruction at an anastomotic site. For example, in one case report a horse developed ileal hypertrophy after surgical correction of an ileocecal intussusception. 1126 Ileal hypertrophy was also observed in a horse in which an ileocolic anastomosis was incorrectly oriented during surgical treatment of a cecal impaction. 1000 Horses are typically reexamined for recurrence of colic in these cases. Surgical therapy is directed at addressing the cause of small intestinal obstruction and resecting hypertrophied intestine.",

These differing clinical syndromes are attributable to the type of adhesions that develop. For example, a fibrous adhesion that does not by itself obstruct the intestinal lumen might serve as the pivot point for a volvulus, whereas an adhesion between adjacent segments of the intestinal tract may create a hairpin turn that causes chronic partial obstruction. 1130 The number of adhesions that develop may also vary dramatically from horse to horse. Some horses may develop a single adhesion adjacent to an anastomotic site or a discrete segment of injured intestine, whereas other horses may develop diffuse adhesions involving multiple segments of intestine, likely because of widespread inflammatory disease at the time of the original surgery.",

            "text": "The mechanisms by which adhesions develop are complex but likely involve injury to the serosa initiated by intestinal ischemia, reperfusion injury, and luminal distention. 1037 Such injury involves infiltration of neutrophils into the serosa, accompanied by loss of mesothelial cells. In one study assessing the margins of resected small intestine, extensive neutrophil infiltration was documented in the serosa, particularly in the proximal resection margin that had been distended before correction of a variety of strangulating lesions. 868 Regions of serosal injury and inflammation subsequently undergo reparative events similar to those of any wound, including local production of fibrin, de novo synthesis of collagen by infiltrating fibroblasts, and ultimately maturation and remodeling of fibrous tissue. Unfortunately, during this process fibrin may result in injured intestinal surfaces adhering to adjacent injured bowel or an adjacent organ. Once a fibrinous adhesion has developed, new collagen synthesis may result in a permanent fibrous adhesion. Alternatively, fibrinous exudate may be lysed by proteases released by local phagocytes, reversing the adhesive process. Formation of adhesions may be viewed as an imbalance of fibrin deposition and fibrinolysis. 1131 Prevention of adhesions relies on inhibition of the mechanisms involved in adhesion formation, including reduction of serosal injury with early intervention and good surgical technique, reduction of inflammation by administration of antiinflammatory medications, physical separation of inflamed serosal surfaces (e.g., carboxymethylcellulose, hyaluronan), [1132] [1133] [1134] and pharmacologic modulation of fibrinous adhesion formation (e.g., heparin 1135 ). Early return of motility in the small intestine after surgery may reduce contact time between inflamed surfaces of intestine, reducing the chances of adhesion formation. 1131 Horses at greatest risk of developing adhesions after colic surgery appear to be those that have small intestinal disease. 1130 In one study of horses undergoing surgical correction of small intestinal obstruction, 22% developed a surgical lesion associated with adhesions. Foals appear to have an increased incidence of adhesions compared with mature horses, regardless of the nature of the abdominal surgery. 1130 One study indicated that 17% of foals developed lesions attributable to adhesions regardless of the type of the initial surgery. 1136 Studies conflict as to whether the degree of surgical intervention influences adhesion formation, 1130 but horses that require enterotomy or resection and anastomosis were at greatest risk of developing adhesions in one study. 1137 Adhesions are among the most important reasons for repeat laparotomy in postoperative colic patients. 1137, 1138 Clinical signs in horses with adhesions are highly variable, depending on whether the adhesion is causing partial obstruction, complete luminal obstruction, or involvement of intestinal vasculature. Adhesions are an important differential for intermittent colic in the postoperative period, particularly if such colic was not relieved by nasogastric decompression of the stomach. Continued intermittent colic should prompt abdominocentesis to determine whether there is evidence of septic peritonitis, which may contribute to adhesion formation. If postoperative colic persists, repeat laparotomy or laparoscopy may be elected. In one study on adhesions, 70% of repeat laparotomies were performed within 60 days, suggesting that surgical colic attributable to adhesions typically occurs within 2 months of an initial surgical procedure. Unfortunately, the prognosis for horses with colic attributable to adhesions is poor, with only 16% of horses surviving adhesion-induced colic in one study. 1130 Y LARGE INTESTINAL SIMPLE OBSTRUCTION Simple obstructions of the large intestine, such as impaction, tend to have a more gradual onset than those of the small intestine, although horses may experience acute and severe pain with some forms of colon displacement. In fact, some of these cases mimic and may progress toward large colon volvulus. Medical therapy is frequently successful in correcting large colon impactions. However, cecal impactions present much more of a dilemma because of the greater propensity of this organ to rupture, the relative difficulty of surgically manipulating the cecum, and the onset of cecal dysfunction that may prevent the cecum from emptying after surgical resolution of impaction.",

In horses with primary cecal impactions, there is a gradual onset of abdominal pain over a number of days reminiscent of the development of a large colon impaction. Cecal impactions should be differentiated from large colon impactions on the basis of rectal palpation findings. These impactions have a propensity to rupture before the development of severe abdominal pain or systemic deterioration and therefore must be closely monitored. 1139 Secondary cecal impactions typically develop after unrelated surgical procedures that result in postoperative pain (particularly orthopedic surgeries). 1140 Secondary cecal impactions may be even more difficult to detect because postoperative depression and decreased fecal output may be attributed to the operative procedure rather than colic. By the time horses with secondary cecal impactions show noticeable signs of colic, the cecum may be close to rupture. In many cases there will be no signs of impending rupture. 1140 Therefore the feed intake and manure production of all horses that undergo surgery in which considerable postoperative pain may develop should be closely monitored. A recent study indicated that horses producing less than three piles of manure daily in the postoperative period are at risk of developing a large intestinal impaction. Horses that underwent prolonged (>1 hour) orthopedic surgery that received inadequate treatment with phenylbutazone were at considerable risk of reduced postoperative fecal output. 1141 A diagnosis of cecal impaction is based on rectal palpation of a firm, impacted or fluid-filled cecum. In some cases, cecal impactions may be difficult to differentiate from large colon impactions. Careful palpation, however, will reveal the inability to move the hand completely dorsal to the impacted viscus because of the cecum's attachment to the dorsal body wall.",

The diagnosis is based on rectal palpation of a firm mass in the large colon. The extent of the impaction may be underestimated by rectal palpation alone because much of the colon remains out of reach. 1142 Adjacent colon may be distended if the impaction has resulted in complete obstruction.

The formation of Mg-based minerals is puzzling because of the relative abundance of Ca in colonic fluids, which would favor the formation of Ca phosphates (apatite) rather than struvite. Elevated dietary intake of magnesium and protein may play a role. Feeding of alfalfa hay and decreased dietary proportions of grass hay and pasture grass have been consistently identified as risk factors in horses with enterolithiasis. [1149] [1150] [1151] Alfalfa hay has a concentration of magnesium approximately six times the daily requirements of the horse. 1152 The high protein concentration in alfalfa hay may contribute to calculus formation by increasing the ammonia nitrogen load in the large intestine. Enteroliths most commonly form around a nucleus of silicon dioxide (a flintlike stone), but nidi have included nails, rope, and hair that have been ingested. 1153 Enteroliths are usually found in the right dorsal and transverse colons. 1152 Although enterolithiasis has a wide geographic distribution, horses in California have the highest incidence. In one California study, horses with enterolithiasis represented 28% of the surgical colic population, and Arabians, Morgans, American Saddlebreds, and donkeys were at greatest risk of this disease. 37 In a study of enterolithiasis in Texas, risk factors also included feeding of alfalfa hay and the Arabian breed. In that study, Miniature Horses were also found to be at risk. 1149 Horses with enteroliths are rarely younger than 4 years old, with a median age of 11 in one report 37 ; an enterolith has been reported in an 11-month-old Miniature Horse. 1154 The most common reported clinical signs are episodic mild to moderate abdominal pain. 37, 1152 Enteroliths may be diagnosed by abdominal radiography or at surgery. 40, 1155 On rare occasions an enterolith may be palpated rectally, particularly if it is present in the distal small colon.",

After removal of an enterolith, further exploration must be conducted to determine whether other enteroliths are present. Solitary enteroliths are usually round, whereas multiple enteroliths have flat sides.

            "text": "Sand impactions are common in horses with access to sandy soils, particularly horses whose feed is placed on the ground. Some horses, especially foals, deliberately eat sand. Fine sand tends to accumulate in the ventral colon, whereas coarse sand may accumulate in the dorsal colon. 737, 1156 Individual differences in colonic function may contribute to accumulation of sand because some horses can clear consumed sand, whereas others cannot. Distention resulting from the impaction itself, or gas proximal to the impaction, causes abdominal pain. Sand may also trigger diarrhea, presumably as a result of irritation of the colonic mucosa. 738 In horses with sand impactions, clinical signs are similar to those of horses with large colon impactions. Sand may be found in the feces, and auscultation of the ventral abdomen may reveal sounds of sand moving within the large colon. 1157 The diagnosis is made via radiography or surgery but may be tentatively based on clinical signs compatible with a large colon impaction and evidence of sand in the feces. Sand sedimentation is performed by mixing feces with water in a rectal palpation sleeve or other container. Abdominal radiographs can be used to detect mineral opacity within the ventral colon. 38, 1158 Ultrasonography can also be used to support the diagnosis but is not as accurate as radiography. 1159 Abdominal paracentesis is not recommended in suspected cases, because large quantities of sand in the ventral colon make inadvertent perforation of the colon more likely. 737 Medical management typically offers a good prognosis. 1160 Administration of psyllium hydrophilic mucilloid (0.25-0.5 kg/500 kg in 2 L mineral oil by stomach tube) may facilitate passage of sand. If mixed with water, it should be administered rapidly because of formation of a viscous gel. The psyllium leaves the oil phase and mixes with the water, forming a gel within the stomach. Psyllium is thought to act by stimulating motility or agglutinating the sand. However, one experimental study failed to show a benefit of this treatment. 1161 If a severe impaction is present, then psyllium should not be given until the impaction is softened by administering IV or oral fluids and other laxatives. Perforation is a potential complication in horses with sand impactions because the sand stretches and irritates the intestinal wall and causes inflammation. If colic becomes intractable, surgical evacuation of the large colon should be performed. The prognosis is generally regarded as good. 737, 1156 Large Colon Displacement Displacement of the ascending colon is a common cause of large intestinal obstruction. The ascending colon is freely movable except for the right dorsal and ventral colons. Contact with adjacent viscera and the abdominal wall tends to inhibit movement of the ascending colon from a normal position; accumulation of gas and fluid or ingesta, however, may cause the colon to migrate. 1162 Feeding behavior, including feeding of large concentrate meals, likely plays a role in initiating displacement of the large colon. Large concentrate meals increase the rate of passage of ingesta, allowing a greater percentage of soluble carbohydrates to reach the large intestine. 1163 This in turn increases the rate of fermentation and the amount of gas and volatile fatty acids that are produced. The production of large amounts of volatile fatty acids stimulates the secretion of large volumes of fluid into the colon. 2 The association between feeding concentrate and development of displacements of the large colon is illustrated by studies indicating that ascending colon displacement is more prevalent in horses fed a high-concentrate, low-roughage diet. 1164 Abnormal motility patterns of the ascending colon may also contribute to the development of colonic displacement. Feeding stimulates colonic motility by way of the gastrocolic reflex, but large meals may alter normal motility patterns and concurrently allow rapid accumulation of gas and fluid resulting from fermentation. 1163, 1165 Migration of parasite larvae (strongyles) through the intestinal wall also alters colonic motility patterns. 650 S. vulgaris infection results in reduced blood flow to segments of the large intestine without necessarily causing infarction. Electrical activity of the colon and cecocolic junction increases after infection with S. vulgaris and cyathostome larvae, probably reflecting a direct effect of migration through the intestine and an early response to reduced blood flow. 650 Displacements of the ascending colon are generally divided into three types: left dorsal displacement, right dorsal displacement, and retroflexion. 1162, 1166 Left dorsal displacement is characterized by entrapment of the ascending colon in the renosplenic space. The colon is often twisted 180 degrees, such that the left ventral colon is situated in a dorsal position relative to the left dorsal colon. The entrapped portion may be only the pelvic flexure or may involve a large portion of the ascending colon, with the pelvic flexure situated near the diaphragm. The colon may become entrapped by migrating dorsally between the left abdominal wall and the spleen or may migrate in a caudodorsal direction over the nephrosplenic ligament. 1166 Occasionally, the ascending colon can be palpated between the spleen and abdominal wall, lending support to the first mechanism of displacement. Gastric distention is thought to predispose horses to left dorsal displacement of the ascending colon by displacing the spleen medially, allowing the colon room to migrate along the abdominal wall. 1166 Right dorsal displacement begins by movement of the colon cranially, either medial (medial flexion) or lateral (lateral flexion) to the cecum. According to one author, the proportion of right dorsal displacements with medial versus lateral flexion is approximately 1:15. 1166 In either case the pelvic flexure ends up adjacent to the diaphragm. Retroflexion of the ascending colon occurs by movement of the pelvic flexure cranially without movement of the sternal or diaphragmatic flexures.",

The heart rate may be increased in conjunction with abdominal pain but is often normal. Abdominal distention may be present, and fecal production is reduced. Left dorsal displacements are often diagnosed by rectal palpation, because the ascending colon can be traced to the nephrosplenic space, and the spleen may be displaced medially. Alternatively, a tentative diagnosis can be reached using abdominal ultrasonography. 1167 The spleen can be imaged on the left side of the abdomen, but the left kidney will be obscured by gas-distended bowel. Evaluation of this technique indicates that there are very few instances of false-positive results, although false-negative results may occasionally occur. 1167 A definitive diagnosis may require surgery. Right dorsal displacements are characterized by the presence of the distended ventral colon running across the pelvic inlet and may be felt between the cecum and the body wall if a lateral flexion is present. The pelvic flexure is usually not palpable. Retroflexion of the ascending colon may produce a palpable kink in the colon. If the displaced colons are not distended by gas in the instance of right dorsal displacement and retroflexion, the ascending colon may not be palpable and is conspicuous by its absence from a normal position. Horses with right dorsal displacement often have an increased GGT, relative to horses with left dorsal displacement, which is presumptively caused by compression of the bile duct and temporary extrahepatic obstruction. 17 For nephrosplenic entrapment of the large colon, medical management is often effective. [1167] [1168] [1169] Medical therapy with phenylephrine and rolling under anesthesia (84%) was significantly more effective than phenylephrine (3-6 \u03bcg/kg/min over 15 minutes) and exercise (63.2%) in a recent report. 1169 There are reports of fatal internal hemorrhage caused by rupture of large blood vessels after treatment of older horses with phenylephrine, and the drug should probably be used with caution in horses older than 15 years. 1170 Medical therapy has also been reported effective (64%) in horses with right dorsal displacement, 1171 although definitive diagnosis of that condition is challenging without surgical confirmation. If medical management is not successful, horses should undergo surgery promptly. Surgical prognosis for horses with large colon displacement is good. A number of horses will suffer recurrence of nephrosplenic entrapment of the colon. Currently, the least invasive method of preventing this complication is laparoscopic closure of the nephrosplenic space. 78, 1172, 1173 ",

            "text": "Mural masses such as abscesses, tumors (adenocarcinoma and lymphosarcoma), granulomas, and hematomas can cause luminal obstruction and impaction, typically in older horses. Impaction may result from obstruction of the lumen or impaired motility in the segment of intestine with the mass. Abscesses may originate from the lumen of the intestine or may extend from the mesentery or mesenteric lymph nodes. Intramural hematomas form most commonly in the descending colon and cause acute abdominal pain. 1176 Once the acute pain caused by the hematoma subsides, impaction proximal to the hematoma develops as a result of impaired motility through the affected portion of the colon. Trauma, ulceration of the mucosa, and parasitic damage are speculated causes of intramural hematomas. 1176, 1177 Stricture of the large intestine occurs when fibrous tissue forms in a circular pattern around or within the intestine, reducing the luminal diameter and the ability of the wall to stretch. Strictures may be congenital or secondary to peritonitis, previous abdominal surgery, or inflammatory bowel disease. In a report of 11 horses with inflammatory bowel disease, 6 horses had strictures, 4 of which were in the small intestine and 2 of which were in the large colon. 517 Clinical signs vary according to the degree of luminal obstruction. Partial obstruction and impaction tend to produce mild to moderate abdominal pain of insidious onset. Mural hematomas tend to produce signs of acute abdominal pain. 1176, 1177 Rectal palpation of the abdomen may reveal the presence of a mass or simply the impacted segment, without the mass itself being felt. Fever, weight loss, and anorexia may be noted if an abscess or tumor is the cause. An elevated WBC count; hyperfibrinogenemia; hyperglobulinemia; or normocytic, normochromic anemia may be seen with abscesses or tumors. PF may reflect the cause of the mass. Tumor cells may infrequently be seen. Evidence of inflammation with bacteria may be noted if the cause of colic is an abscess or granuloma, in which case the fluid should be cultured. Hematomas may cause hemorrhage into the PF. Treatment usually requires surgical resection of the mass. Abscesses may be treated with appropriate antibiotics if the impaction can be resolved medically with oral or IV analgesics and laxatives. Streptococcus spp., Actinomyces pyogenes, C. pseudotuberculosis, R. equi, anaerobic bacteria, and gram-negative enteric organisms are commonly involved in abscesses.",

In one study the key risk factor for impaction of this segment of the intestine was diarrhea. 1178 This paradoxic finding may be explained by edema of the colonic mucosa associated with proinflammatory causes of diarrheal disease that is usually noted in the ascending colon but may extend into the transverse and small colons. Once diarrheal disease is initiated, large volumes of ingesta are rapidly expelled from the ascending colon into the small colon, which has a far smaller diameter, especially if it is edematous. This may result in the initial appearance of diarrhea, followed by intermittent episodes of colic that may be explained by impaction. Diagnosis is by rectal examination, during which the rectum typically feels edematous and gritty. The most important point to remember is that horses should be closely assessed for impaction even if diarrheal disease is present. Other parameters that are typically helpful for assessing the severity of colic, such as heart rate, are not predictive of obstruction in horses with small colon impaction. 1178 Horses may be treated medically during the early stages with fluids, laxatives, and analgesics. The key clinical sign that indicates the need for surgery appears to be abdominal distention, associated with distention of the large colon. Other clinical signs, such as elevations in heart rate and refractory colic, are less pronounced in this disease. Postdiarrheal disease is not the only form of small colon impaction. These impactions can be formed as simple collections of ingesta or in response to luminal narrowing.",

Each incisor tooth tapers from a broad crown to a narrow root so as the midportion of the incisor is exposed to wear, the cross-sectional diameters are about equal; that is, at 14 years of age, the central incisor tooth of the horse has an occlusal surface that is an equilateral triangle. Observations on the state of eruption, the angles of incidence of the incisor teeth, and the pattern of the occlusal surfaces are used as guides for the aging of horses.

            "text": "When erupted, the six cheek teeth of the horse function as a single unit in the mastication of food. Each arcade consists of three premolar and three molar teeth. The maxillary arcade is slightly curved, and the teeth have a square occlusal surface. The occlusal surfaces of the mandibular teeth are more oblong, and each arcade is straighter. The horse is anisognathic-that is, the distance between the mandibular teeth is narrower (one-third) than the distance between the upper cheek teeth. This anatomic arrangement affects the inclination of the dental arcade as the jaws slide across each other in the food preparation process. The unworn upper cheek tooth presents a surface with two undulating and narrow ridges, one of which is lateral and the other medial. On the rostral and lingual side of the medial style is an extra hillock. The central portion of these surfaces is indented by two depressions that are comparable with, but much deeper than, the infundibula of the incisor teeth. When the teeth have been subjected to wear, the enamel that closed the ridges is worn through and the underlying dentin appears on the surface. After a time the chewing surface displays a complicated pattern that may be likened to the outline of an ornate letter B, and the upright stroke of the B is on the lingual aspect. Dentin supports the enamel internally, cementum supports the enamel lakes, and the peripheral cementum fills in the spaces between the teeth so that all six teeth may function as a single unit-that is, the dental arcade. Transverse ridges cross each tooth so that the entire maxillary arcade consists of a serrated edge. The serrations are formed so that a valley is present at the area of contact with adjacent teeth. These serrations match fitting serrations on the mandibular arcade. One should note that the mediolateral mandibular motion while chewing pellets does not provide full occlusal contact as it does when chewing hay. 1187 The true roots of the cheek teeth are short compared with the total length of the tooth. Cheek teeth have three roots: two small lateral roots and one large medial root. That portion of the crown embedded within the dental alveolus is referred to as the reserve crown, and the term root is confined to that area of the tooth that is comparatively short and enamel free. Wear on the tooth gradually exposes the reserve crown, and the roots lengthen. In an adult 1000-lb horse the maxillary cheek teeth are between 8.0 and 8.5 cm in length. Dental wear accounts for erosion and loss of tooth substance at a rate of 2 mm/year. The pulp chambers of the teeth are also complex. The incisors and canines have a single pulp chamber. The mandibular cheek teeth have two roots and two separate pulp chambers. The maxillary cheek teeth, although they have three roots, have five pulp chambers.",

            "text": "The lips of the horse are mobile and prehensile. Consequently, loss of motor function (e.g., facial palsy) affects the efficiency of the prehensile system. The lips grasp food in grazing or browsing, and the incisor teeth section the food. With mastication and lubrication with saliva, the bolus of food forms and is manipulated from side to side across the mouth, assisted by the tight cheeks of the horse and the palatine ridges. Swallowing begins as the food bolus contacts the base of the tongue and the pharyngeal walls. During swallowing, the soft palate elevates to close the nasopharynx, the base of the tongue elevates, and the hyoid bone and the larynx move rostrally following contraction of the hyoid muscles. During this process, the rima glottidis closes and the epiglottis tilts dorsally and caudally to protect the airway so that food is swept through lateral food channels around the sides of the larynx into the laryngoesophagus. Fluoroscopic studies in nursing foals in the dorsoventral view showed that contact occurs between the lateral food channels in the midline so that in outline the food bolus achieves a bow-tie shape. 1188 Dysphagia is defined as a difficulty or inability to swallow. Anatomic classifications for dysphagia include prepharyngeal, pharyngeal, and esophageal (postpharyngeal) dysphagias. The site of the cause for dysphagia influences the clinical signs. Prepharyngeal dysphagia is characterized by dropping food (quidding) or water from the mouth, reluctance to chew, hypersalivation, or abnormalities in prehension. Pharyngeal and esophageal dysphagias are characterized by coughing; nasal discharge containing saliva, water, or food material; gagging; anxiousness; and neck extension during attempts to swallow. The following section describes esophageal dysphagia in more detail. Causes of dysphagia can be divided into four types: painful, muscular, neurologic, or obstructive (Table 12.8) . Pain and obstruction cause dysphagia by interfering with the mechanics of prehension, bolus formation and transfer to the pharynx, and deglutition. Muscular and neurologic causes of dysphagia impede prehension and swallowing by affecting the motor function of the lingual or buccal musculature, muscles of mastication (temporal and masseters), and pharyngeal and cranial esophageal muscles. Sensory loss to the lips, buccal mucous membranes, pharynx, or tongue also may cause dysphagia. Neurologic causes of dysphagia may affect the forebrain, brainstem, or peripheral nerves that control prehension (cranial nerves Vm, Vs, VII, and XII), transfer of the food bolus to the pharynx (cranial nerves Vs and XII), and swallowing (cranial nerves IX and X). The latter point was classical thinking, but recent evidence suggests that, while stimulation of cranial nerve IX stimulates swallowing, bilateral blockade of that nerve does not prevent normal swallowing of either liquid or solid material. 1189 Diagnosis of the cause of dysphagia is based on physical examination including a careful oral examination; neurologic examination; clinical signs; and endoscopy of the pharynx, esophagus, and guttural pouches. Radiology may be useful to assess the bony structures of the head and throat. Ultrasonography is valuable for examining the retropharyngeal space and esophagus to detect and evaluate masses. Pharyngeal or esophageal causes of dysphagia may be detected with routine endoscopic examination or with contrast radiography. Endoscopy may also be used to assess deglutition, but this function may be adversely affected by sedation of the horse. Deglutition may also be assessed using fluoroscopy 1190 or manometry, 1191 but these techniques require specialized equipment. Specific diagnostic procedures for nonalimentary causes of dysphagia are covered elsewhere in this text (see Chapter 7). Specific treatments aimed at resolving the underlying disorder causing dysphagia are discussed in detail elsewhere. Most horses with dysphagia should not be fed roughage with long fiber length (hay or grass). Dietary modifications that promote swallowing, such as feeding slurries made from complete pelleted feeds, may be sufficient to manage some cases of partial dysphagia. Aspiration pneumonia is a potential complication in horses with pharyngeal or esophageal dysphagia. Foals may be managed by feeding mare's milk or a suitable substitute via nasogastric tube. Pellet slurries or formulated liquid diets may be fed via nasogastric tube to older horses. Prolonged nutritional management of dysphagic horses may require extraoral feeding using a tube placed through an esophagostomy. 1192 Formulated pelleted diets are often easy to administer through a tube as slurry and are balanced to meet the nutritional requirements for healthy horses. Sufficient quantities must be fed to deliver adequate calories (16) (17) Mcal/ day for a 500-kg horse). Adjustments may be necessary for horses that are cachectic or have extra metabolic demand (such as pregnancy). Adding corn oil to the ration (1 cup every 12 or 24 hours) is a common method of increasing fed calories. Equine-specific enteral formulations are also available (Well-Gel, Land O'Lakes Purina Feed LLC, Arden Hills, MN). Regardless of the method of nutritional management, salivary losses of electrolytes should be monitored and electrolyte replacement therapy provided as needed. Saliva contains high concentrations of Na, K, and Cl. A group of ponies with experimental esophagostomies 1193 and a horse with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma 1194 were fed a complete pelleted diet through esophagostomy tubes but developed metabolic acidosis, hyponatremia, and hypochloremia apparently because of salivary losses. Surprisingly, salivary losses of potassium did not result in hypokalemia in these cases, presumably because of replacement in the diet. Electrolyte replacement may be accomplished by adding NaCl and KCl to the diet. Horses can be maintained for months with frequent feedings through an esophagostomy tube. 1194 Parenteral nutrition (total or partial) may be useful in the short term but is not often feasible for long-term management.",

As a result, teeth may be displaced and erupt in abnormal positions or may have abnormal shapes. Supernumerary teeth, incisors and molars, can develop, as well as palatal displacement of impacted teeth (maxillary P3-3, or third cheek tooth). In almost all of these conditions some form of surgical treatment is necessary, but depending on the number and location, conservative therapy can be successful. 1196 Dental impaction is a major cause of dental disease in the horse. In a series of 142 extracted teeth, 63 were P3-3 or P4-4 (cheek tooth 2 or 3, respectively). 1197 Early observations had indicated that the first molar (M1, or cheek tooth 4) was the most commonly diseased tooth, and an \"open infundibulum\" in this tooth has been suggested as the cause. 1198 In a later study, the mandibular cheek teeth 2 and 3 were the most commonly affected, whereas cheek teeth 2 and 4 were most commonly affected in the maxillary arcade, which was the more commonly affected arcade. 1199 Studies on cementogenesis of the maxillary cheek teeth have shown, however, that most maxillary cheek teeth have a greater or lesser degree of hypoplasia of cementum within the enamel lakes and that this \"lesion\" rarely expands into the pulp. The central infundibular hole is the site of its vascular supply to the unerupted cement lake. On those occasions in which caries of cementum occurs-that is, secondary inflammatory disease and acid necrosis of the cementum-apical osteitis may develop.",

The initiation of inflammatory pulp changes may be a sequela to dental impaction or dental caries or may result from fracture of a tooth. If the onset of the inflammatory process is slow, then formation of secondary dentin within the pulp chambers may protect the pulp and the tooth. Secondary dentin formation occurs from stimulation of odontoblasts within the pulp chamber. Such changes are the normal process of protection during dental wear and attrition as crown substances wear away and the reserve crown comes into wear. In acute disease, however, this defense mechanism is ineffective, and the changes that occur and that are sequelae to pulpitis reflect the location of each affected tooth. For example, pulpitis and apical osteitis of the third mandibular cheek tooth most commonly results in the development of a mandibular dental fistula. Pulpitis of the third maxillary cheek tooth, however, results in an inflammatory disease within the rostral maxillary sinus and in development of chronic maxillary sinus empyema.",

Such periodontal changes usually resolve as the permanent dental arcade is established. During normal mastication, the shearing forces generated by the occlusal contact of the cheek teeth essentially clean the teeth of plaque and effectively inhibit deposition of dental calculus. Wherever occlusal contact is ineffective, periodontal changes and calculus buildup occur; for example, the deposition of calculus on the canine teeth of mature geldings and stallions is common. Routine dental prophylaxis forms an important component of maintaining normal occlusal contact, and for this reason arcade irregularities that result in enamel point formation on the buccal edges of the maxillary cheek teeth and the lingual edges of the mandibular cheek teeth should be corrected. These edges may be smoothed annually in horses that are at grass and twice yearly in young horses, aged horses, and stabled horses. Horses at grass have a greater range of occlusal contact and therefore better periodontal hygiene than stabled horses. In stabled horses the range of occlusal contact is narrower, and the formation of enamel points occurs more frequently with subsequent buccal ulceration and the initiation of a cycle of altered occlusal contact and, hence, irregular arcade formation. This process leads to severe forms of periodontal disease and wave mouth formation.",

A transition occurs in the muscle type composing the tunica muscularis from striated skeletal muscle in the proximal two thirds of the esophagus to smooth muscle in the distal third. In the proximal esophagus the skeletal muscle layers spiral across one another at angles. Within the smooth muscle layers of the distal esophagus the outer layer becomes more longitudinal, whereas the inner layer thickens and becomes circular. The wall of the terminal esophagus can be 1 to 2 cm thick. Deep cervical fascia, pleura, and peritoneum contribute to the thin fibrous tunica adventitia of the esophagus. Motor innervation to the striated skeletal muscle of the esophagus includes the pharyngeal and esophageal branches of the vagus nerve, which originate in the nucleus ambiguus of the medulla oblongata. Parasympathetic fibers of the vagus nerve supply the smooth muscle of the distal esophagus. Sympathetic innervation of the esophagus is minimal.",

Relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter permits passage of ingested material from the esophagus to the stomach. Distention of the stomach with ingesta mechanically constricts the lower esophageal sphincter. Gastric distention also triggers a vagal reflex that increases lower esophageal sphincter tone, which is a safety mechanism against gastroesophageal reflux.

Impactions also may result from disorders that physically impede the passage of food material and fluid by narrowing the luminal diameter, reduce the compliance of the esophageal wall, or alter the conformation of the esophageal wall such that food material accumulates in a pocket or diverticulum. Foreign bodies, intramural or extramural masses, or acquired or congenital anomalies cause these so-called secondary impactions.

            "text": "A thorough physical examination, including complete oral and neurologic examination, can help rule out causes of dysphagia and nasal discharge other than esophageal obstruction. Clinical signs associated with esophageal obstructions are related primarily to regurgitation of food, water, and saliva caused by esophageal (postpharyngeal) dysphagia. 1227 Horses with esophageal obstruction are often anxious and stand with their neck extended. Gagging or retching may be observed, particularly with acute proximal obstructions. Bilateral frothy nasal discharge containing saliva, water, and food material; coughing; odynophagia; and ptyalism are characteristic clinical signs, the severity of which varies with the degree and location of the obstruction. Distention in the jugular furrow may be evident at the site of obstruction. Other clinical signs related to regurgitation of saliva, water, and food material, such as dehydration, electrolyte, or acid-base imbalances; weight loss; and aspiration pneumonia may be observed. In extreme cases, pressure necrosis from the impaction or trauma to the esophagus may cause esophageal rupture. If the rupture is in the cervical esophagus, crepitus or cellulitis may be evident along with signs of systemic inflammation. Thoracic auscultation is important to determine whether aspiration pneumonia is present. Intrathoracic esophageal rupture may result in pleuritis and its associated clinical signs. Passage of a nasogastric tube is an effective way to detect and localize an obstruction but provides little information about the nature of the obstruction or the condition of the esophagus. The most direct method for diagnosis of esophageal obstructions is endoscopic examination. Esophageal obstruction occurs most commonly at sites of natural narrowing of the esophageal lumen, such as the cervical esophagus, the thoracic inlet, base of the heart, or the terminal esophagus; an endoscope greater than 1 m in length is necessary for complete evaluation. Endoscopic evaluation is useful before relief of an impaction to localize the obstruction and to investigate the nature of the impaction if one suspects a foreign body. Foreign bodies may be retrievable via transendoscopic tethering. 1228 Critical diagnostic and prognostic information is also obtained via endoscopy after resolution of the impaction. Assessing the affected esophagus for mucosal ulceration, rupture, masses, strictures, diverticula, and signs of functional abnormalities is important (Figs. 12.15 and 12.16) .",

Air or barium contrast radiographic studies are most useful for evaluating the esophagus following relief of the impaction if one suspects a stricture.

If the choke is not easily dislodged with gentle pressure, the tube is removed. Appropriate sedative, antiinflammatory/analgesic, and smooth muscle-relaxing drugs are administered. The horse is moved to an unbedded stall with absolutely no food or water within reach and muzzled if necessary. The horse is left alone in the stall for several hours. If there is evidence of dehydration, appropriate IV fluid therapy is provided. If there is evidence of aspiration pneumonia, appropriate IV antimicrobial therapy is provided.

Careful lavage of the esophagus with water via an uncuffed or a cuffed nasogastric tube while the head is lowered may be a useful aid in breaking up the impaction. Some clinicians advocate a dual tube method in which a tube is placed through each nasal passage into the esophagus for ingress and egress of the lavage fluid. Because of the risk of aspiration of water and food material, esophageal lavage sometimes is done under general anesthesia with a cuffed nasotracheal tube. In refractory cases, IV administration of polyionic fluids provides hydration and alleviates any electrolyte or acid-base imbalances resulting from salivary losses of chloride, sodium, and potassium. 1193 Oxytocin may or may not provide a direct effect for the resolution of an esophageal obstruction. Oxytocin reduced the area under the curve for esophageal smooth muscle strip contractions but had no effect on skeletal muscle strips in vitro. 1234 In one in vivo report, oxytocin administration resulted in decreased esophageal tone in the proximal esophagus (aborad to the larynx and thoracic inlet). 1233 In a separate study, oxytocin administration did not affect esophageal manometric recordings. 1235 Rarely, esophageal obstruction ultimately may require esophagotomy to relieve the impaction. Strict restriction of food and water, including access to bedding material, must be enforced until the obstruction is resolved and the esophagus has regained function. Surgical removal of esophageal foreign bodies can be considered if the size and/or orientation of the object is such that transendoscopic retrieval is considered unlikely to be successful. 1226, 1236 In one report, an intraluminal mass comprised of exuberant granulation tissue was removed via serial transendoscopic Nd:YAG laser ablation. 1237 Systemic effects of dysphagia associated with esophageal impaction include dehydration, hyponatremia, hypochloremia, and metabolic alkalosis from prolonged loss of salivary free water and electrolytes. 1193 Esophageal endoscopy should be performed after relief of the impaction to determine whether any complications of the impaction have developed or if a primary cause of the obstruction is present. Endoscopic examination is critical to determine the postobstruction treatment plan and for follow-up evaluation of esophageal healing. The horse should be reevaluated every 2 to 4 weeks following resolution of the impaction if esophageal dilation or mucosal injury is observed. In one report, male sex, age >15 years, and need for general anesthesia to relieve the obstruction were associated with an increased risk of complications. 1238 Dilation proximal to the site of obstruction, mucosal injury from trauma, stricture formation, formation of a diverticulum, megaesophagus, and esophagitis are sequelae to esophageal obstruction that predispose patients to reobstruction. Underlying functional or morphologic abnormalities were much more likely in cases of recurrent, relative to first time, obstruction in a retrospective study. 1216 The rate of reobstruction may be as high as 37%. Depending on the duration of the obstruction and the degree of trauma or dilation, the risk of reobstruction is high for 24 to 48 hours or longer. Food should be withheld for at least 24 to 48 hours after resolution of the obstruction. Sucralfate (20 mg/kg orally every 6 hours) may hasten healing if esophageal ulceration is evident, but the efficacy of sucralfate for this purpose is not established. Some clinicians suggest that administration of an NSAID may reduce the development of strictures, although judicious use of NSAIDs is recommended to prevent worsening of esophageal mucosal injury. Orally administered NSAIDs should be avoided if esophagitis is present. After 48 to 72 hours or when the esophageal mucosa has recovered as assessed by endoscopy, the horse may be fed soft food (moistened pellets and bran mashes) then transitioned gradually to a high-quality roughage diet over 7 to 21 days, depending on the degree of esophageal damage induced by the impaction and the nature of any underlying disease. The prognosis for survival is good (78-88%), but some horses may require permanent dietary modification if persistent chronic obstruction is a problem. 1216, 1220, 1238 Aspiration pneumonia is a potential complication in every case of esophageal obstruction, and perforation is possible with severe or prolonged obstruction. In one report, duration of obstruction before presentation was a good predictor of pneumonia, whereas endoscopic evidence of tracheal food contamination was not. 1216 Administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics that are effective against grampositive and gram-negative organisms, including metronidazole for anaerobes, is highly recommended if the duration of obstruction is either unknown or prolonged or if aspiration is suspected.",

Although megaesophagus in horses most commonly is acquired, reports indicate idiopathic megaesophagus in young horses may be congenital. 1191, [1242] [1243] [1244] [1245] Acquired megaesophagus in horses may be a consequence of chronic or recurrent esophageal obstruction. 1220, 1222 Esophageal impactions of a short duration cause a proximal dilation of the esophagus that is generally reversible. 1230 If the duration of the obstruction is long enough, the motility of the esophagus proximal to the site of obstruction may be impaired permanently. Other causes of acquired megaesophagus include extraesophageal obstruction by tumors or abscesses, pleuropneumonia, and vascular ring anomalies. 1220,1223 A retrospective report of horses with megaesophagus reveals an overrepresentation of Friesian horses (14 of 18 cases) suggesting the possibility of a predisposition for esophageal disorders in this breed. 1214 The authors state that preliminary pedigree analyses suggest the possibility of a recessive pattern of inheritance. 1214 Megaesophagus also may result from neurologic, neuromuscular, and muscular disorders. Neurologic diseases that cause vagal neuropathy, such as equine protozoal myeloencephalitis, equine herpesvirus myeloencephalitis, and idiopathic vagal neuropathy, have been associated with megaesophagus in horses. Pleuropneumonia may be associated with a vagal neuropathy resulting in megaesophagus. Megaesophagus is an early sign of equine dysautonomia 1246 and may be observable in patients with botulism. Myasthenia gravis is a well-known cause of megaesophagus in nonequine species but has not been reported in horses. Also in other species, electrolyte disorders, cachexia, primary myopathies, myositis, and Addison's disease may affect esophageal motility but have not been associated with megaesophagus in horses. Iatrogenic megaesophagus can be induced by the \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonist detomidine but is transient and reversible. 36, 1247 Acepromazine, detomidine, and a combination of xylazine and butorphanol can alter proximal esophageal motility by disrupting coordinated peristalsis and decreasing spontaneous swallowing, but only acepromazine affected the manometric profile of the distal esophagus. 1235 None of these drugs altered contractility of isolated esophageal smooth or striated muscle strips in vitro. 1234 Nonetheless, the use of these drugs may complicate clinical evaluation of esophageal motility. Esophageal disorders including megaesophagus, esophageal diverticulum, and esophageal rupture appear to be more common in young Friesian horses, suggesting the possibility of a genetic predisposition in this breed.",

Strictures may also originate in the muscular layers and adventitia of the esophagus (mural strictures) or in all of the layers of the esophagus (annular stenosis). 1217, 1250 Horses with these lesions have a presentation similar to those with simple obstructions, because strictures result in partial obstruction and impaction of food material in the lumen. Esophageal webs or rings may be detected with endoscopy (see Figs. 12.15 and 12.16), whereas identification of mural strictures or annular stenosis may require a double-contrast esophagram (see Fig. 12.17) . In a retrospective study of horses with esophageal stricture following simple obstruction, maximal reduction in esophageal lumen diameter occurred within 30 days of the esophageal obstruction. Although surgery has been used to relieve such strictures, initial medical management is warranted because strictures may resolve with conservative therapy, and the esophagus continues to remodel for up to 60 days following ulceration. In one report, seven horses with esophageal obstruction-induced stricture were treated conservatively by feeding a slurry diet and administering antiinflammatory and antimicrobial medications, and five of seven were clinically normal within 60 days. 1249 One of the five successfully treated horses had a 10-cm area of circumferential ulceration, suggesting that the potential exists for extensive mucosal injury to resolve without permanent stricture formation.",

Traction diverticula result from wounding and subsequent contraction of periesophageal tissues, with resultant tenting of the wall of the esophagus. Pulsion diverticula arise from protrusion of esophageal mucosa through defects in the muscular wall of the esophagus and usually result from trauma or acute changes in intraluminal pressure. 1250 Traction diverticula appear as a dilation with a broad neck on contrast esophagography, whereas pulsion diverticula typically have a flask shape with a small neck on an esophagram (see Fig. 12.17) . 1225, 1265 Although traction diverticula are usually asymptomatic and of little clinical significance, pulsion diverticula may fill with feed material, ultimately leading to esophageal obstruction and rupture. [1265] [1266] [1267] A movable mass in the midcervical region may be noticeable before onset of complete obstruction. 1250 Pulsion diverticula may be corrected surgically by inverting or resecting prolapsed mucosa and closing the defect in the wall of the esophagus. 1225, 1265, 1266 Inversion of excessive mucosa may reduce the diameter of the esophageal lumen and predispose horses to esophageal obstruction; therefore, it should be reserved for small diverticula. 1225",

[1243] [1244] [1245] In the one report of congenital stenosis, double-contrast radiography revealed concentric narrowing of the thoracic esophagus in the absence of any vascular abnormalities at the base of the heart. Successful treatment included having the foal stand with the forelimbs elevated off the ground following each feeding. 1268 Persistent right aortic arch is a congenital anomaly in which the right fourth aortic arch becomes the definitive aorta instead of the left aortic arch, which results in constriction of the esophagus by the ligamentum arteriosum as it extends between the anomalous right aorta and the left pulmonary artery. 1279 Clinical signs may include those associated with esophageal (postpharyngeal) dysphagia, drooling, and distention of the cervical esophagus resulting from partial obstruction of the thoracic esophagus. 1223, 1269 Endoscopic examination typically reveals dilation of the esophagus cranial to the obstruction with evidence of diffuse esophagitis. Surgical treatment of persistent right aortic arch has been reported in foals, with varying degrees of success. 1269, 1271, 1273 In one report, preoperative CT was used to identify the exact anatomic location of the offending lesion and guide the surgical approach. 1273 Esophageal duplication cysts and intramural inclusion cysts cause typical signs of esophageal obstruction, including salivation, esophageal dysphagia, and swelling of the cervical esophagus as the cysts enlarge. 1275, 1277, 1278 Such signs can make them difficult to differentiate from other forms of esophageal obstruction. Endoscopic examination may reveal compression of the esophageal lumen and communication with the esophageal lumen if it exists.",

The esophagus is particularly vulnerable to external trauma in the distal third of the neck because only a thin layer of muscle covers it at this point. 1281 Iatrogenic perforation may occur in response to excessive force with a stomach tube against an obstruction or a compromised region of the esophagus. 1240 Esophageal perforations may be open or closed and tend to cause extensive cellulitis and necrosis of tissues surrounding the wound because of drainage of saliva and feed material within fascial planes. Systemic inflammation from septic cellulitis may occur. Closed perforations of the esophagus are particularly troublesome because food material, water, saliva, and air may migrate to the mediastinum and pleural space via fascial planes. 1240, 1281 Because of the leakage of air into the tissues surrounding the rupture, extensive SC and fascial emphysema frequently develops and is usually evident clinically and on cervical radiographs. Pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax are potentially fatal complications of esophageal ruptures. If the esophagus ruptures into the mediastinum, horses most commonly present with signs of acute SIRS that may be mistaken for colic.",

The clinician may achieve the latter by placing a feeding tube into the esophagus via the wound. Alternatively, a small nasogastric tube (12-Fr diameter) may be placed. 1240 For open perforations, once the wound has granulated and contracted to a small size, oral feeding may be attempted. 1281 Extensive loss of saliva via esophageal wounds may lead to hyponatremia and hypochloremia. Transient metabolic acidosis may occur because of salivary bicarbonate loss, followed by progressive metabolic alkalosis. 1193 Although reports of esophageal wounds healing well by second intention exist, healing takes a prolonged time. 1283 In addition, some perforations never completely heal and form permanent esophagocutaneous fistulae that may require surgical correction. The development of esophageal strictures is not common because wounds are usually linear and not circumferential. However, traction diverticula may develop. Other potential complications of esophageal wounds include Horner's syndrome and left laryngeal hemiplegia. 1281 In a retrospective study on esophageal disorders, only 2 of 11 horses with esophageal perforations survived long term, 1220 and in a report of esophageal trauma following nasogastric intubation, 4 of 5 horses were euthanized. 1240 The prognosis is poor in horses with esophageal perforations, largely because of the extent of cellulitis, tissue necrosis, shock, and local wound complications.",

[1305] [1306] [1307] Many earlier studies investigating prevalence of gastric ulceration do not differentiate between nonglandular and glandular lesions, and many evaluate only the nonglandular region of the stomach, but this trend is changing. In 1 of 162 horses in a hospital setting, 58% had antral or pyloric erosions or ulcerations, 58% had squamous mucosal lesions, and 8% had lesions involving the glandular body. 1308 In other studies, 56% of Thoroughbreds had EGGD, 1293 and 47% of racehorses (Thoroughbred and Standardbred) had EGGD. 1295 In the former, 1293 all horses with glandular lesions also had squamous disease, whereas such an association was not seen in the latter study. 1295 In one report of endurance horses with a 67% overall lesion prevalence, 27% had EGGD. 1297 In another, prevalence varied by season, with 16% EGGD prevalence out of competition and 33% during competition season. 1298 In Danish horses, the prevalence of EGGD was 57% in two separate reports. 1309, 1310 In a postmortem evaluation, lesions were most commonly located in the squamous mucosa along the margo plicatus, followed by the glandular body, proximal squamous mucosa, and antrum. 1302 Overall, glandular lesions tend to occur near the pylorus.",

            "text": "Because the pathophysiology of mucosal injury and repair was documented earlier, it will not be reviewed here. Acid secretion clearly plays a role in squamous mucosal ulceration, and key components of acid regulation will be summarized. Horses secrete acid continuously, and measured pH of equine gastric contents is variable from less than 2 to greater than 6 depending on the horse's dietary state (fed/fasted). 818, 1311 A protocol of repeated 24-hour periods of fasting and feeding has been shown to induce squamous erosion and ulceration. 841 Because this protocol results in periods of prolonged gastric acidity (pH <2.0) and concurrent administration of the H 2 receptor antagonist ranitidine reduces lesion severity, it supports the role of acid exposure in the pathogenesis of squamous ulcer disease. This effect was also noted as pH of the proximal, but not ventral, stomach decreased in early morning hours, corresponding to periods of decreased hay intake. 1312 Several peptides can stimulate or inhibit the secretion of acid by the parietal cell. The predominant stimuli to hydrochloric acid secretion are gastrin, histamine, and acetylcholine via the vagus nerve. 1313 Gastrin is released by G cells within the antral mucosa, whereas histamine is released by mast cells and ECL-like cells in the gastric gland. Histamine binds to type 2 receptors on the parietal cell membrane, causing an increase in adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), resulting in phosphorylation of enzymes that activate the proton pump. Gastrin and acetylcholine can act via calcium-mediated intracellular pathways and also stimulate histamine release directly. 1314 Isolated equine parietal cells respond maximally to histamine stimulation and only minimally to carbachol and pentagastrin. 1315 In vivo, histamine or pentagastrin infusion can stimulate similar maximal acid output. 1316 Interestingly, pentagastrin stimulation also induces a marked duodenal secretion of a sodium chloride-rich fluid, which can reflux back into the stomach under fasting conditions. 1316 Gastrin release is primarily controlled by gastrinreleasing peptide, which is stimulated by gastric distention and increased luminal pH, but the interaction between gastrin and histamine has not been fully elucidated in the horse.",

These findings were supported by a study in which an alfalfa hay/pelleted concentrate diet significantly reduced ESGD severity scores and/or prevented ulcer development relative to a coastal hay/concentrate diet in horses managed with dry lot housing and regular exercise. 1326 Intermittent feeding has clearly been shown to induce ESGD and is a consistent model of ulcer induction. 841, 1311, 1327 Similarly, quality of forage (straw versus other types) and increased time between forage meals was associated with higher incidence of ESGD in one report. 1328 The pathophysiologic correlation between exercise and ESGD has not yet been defined despite the high prevalence of disease in performance horses. In one large epidemiologic study, there was a significant association between ESGD and individual trainer, urban versus rural area, lack of direct contact with other horses, solid barriers, and talk versus music radio. 1329 ESGD can develop within 8 days of exercise varying from light halter to active race training, 1330 and time in work was found to be a risk factor for ESGD in racing Thoroughbreds. 1331 During treadmill exercise at gaits faster than a walk, proximal gastric size decreases in conjunction with an increase in intraabdominal pressure, resulting in a simultaneous decrease in proximal gastric pH. 1333 Both proximal gastric size and pH return to baseline levels as soon as the horse returned to a walk, and the resultant theory was that gastric contracture could result in increased acid exposure to the squamous mucosa by raising the level of liquid gastric contents.",

NSAIDs cause a decrease in PGE 2 synthesis caused by inhibition of the COX pathway. A resultant decrease in glandular mucosal protection, most notably via decreased mucosal blood flow and mucous production, is the most likely mechanism of action. In one study, however, phenylbutazone administration resulted in ulceration of the glandular mucosa at the pyloric antrum but did not significantly alter mucosal PGE 2 concentration. 1335 Other risk factors associated with gastric ulceration include gender and age, and the reported prevalence of gastric ulcers has increased over time. In one study, the frequency of gastric ulceration increased from <6% before 1945 to approximately 18% after 1975. 1302 The association between sex or age and ulceration has not been consistent among studies. 1291, 1293, 1302, 1337 Crib biting has also been discussed as a risk factor for ESGD. 1331, 1338 In foals, risk factors are less clearly defined and will be discussed along with the clinical syndrome in each age group.

Clinical signs of duodenal ulceration are similar to those described for gastric ulceration (bruxism, colic, ptyalism, and diarrhea), but the consequences are often more severe. Lesions occur primarily in the proximal duodenum, ranging from diffuse inflammation to severe ulceration, but affected foals typically have severe squamous and/or glandular ulceration as well (Fig. 12.20) . Foals with duodenal ulceration often have delayed gastric emptying and may have gastroesophageal reflux. Complications can include gastric or duodenal rupture, pyloric or duodenal stricture (Fig. 12.21) , and ascending cholangitis. Severe squamous and esophageal ulceration and aspiration pneumonia can occur secondary to gastroesophageal reflux. 1222, [1342] [1343] [1344] [1345] GDUD syndrome can occur in outbreaks and is most commonly identified in intensive breeding operations. The cause of duodenal lesions in foals is not known. One theory is that the problem begins with diffuse duodenal inflammation that can coalesce down to a focal area of ulceration (G.D. Lester and A.M. Merritt, personal communication). A temporal relationship between GDUD and rotaviral diarrhea has been suggested, but an infectious etiology remains unproven. Although lesion location and severity associated with rotaviral infection varies among species, duodenal ulceration has not been reported. 1346 ",

Various ulcer scoring systems have been promoted, but the system proposed by the Equine Gastric Ulcer Council 1284 (Table 12 .11) has been recommended because of its repeatability and ease of use. 1285, 1350 Duodenal ulceration can be difficult to confirm, and duodenoscopy is the most specific means of diagnosis, although the procedure is more difficult than gastroscopy. Diffuse reddening or inflammation may be the only recognizable lesion in foals with early duodenal disease. In older foals with GDUD, detection of gastric outflow obstruction is critical to the therapeutic plan and appropriate prognosis. A distended stomach is typically evident with ultrasound. Abdominal radiography without contrast in foals with outflow obstruction typically reveals a distinctly enlarged, gas-filled stomach. Liquid barium contrast will either have markedly delayed (with incomplete obstruction) or no (complete obstruction) outflow. Clinically, foals with outflow obstruction will develop reflux after suckling, or marked reflux even with limited to no suckling if the duodenal obstruction is distal to the common bile duct.",

            "text": "The H 2 antagonists suppress hydrochloric acid secretion through competitive inhibition of the parietal cell histamine receptor that can be partially overcome with exogenous pentagastrin. 1351 Use of H 2 antagonists has been successful in raising gastric pH and resolving gastric lesions in both foals and adult horses. 1320, 1344, 1352 Clinical and experimental evidence has demonstrated greater individual variability with lower dosages of H 2 antagonists. 1339 Thus dosage recommendations are based on levels necessary to increase gastric pH and promote ulcer healing in a majority of horses. Commonly recommended ranitidine dosages are 6.6 mg/kg orally every 8 hours or 1.5 to 2 mg/kg IV every 6 hours. Although clinically normal foals respond predictably to ranitidine, 1320 sick neonates have shown variability in pH response to IV ranitidine, with a much shorter duration of action and, in some cases, no noticeable response. 1321 PPIs block secretion of H + at the parietal cell membrane by irreversibly binding to the H + , K + -ATPase proton pump. The powder form of omeprazole is rapidly degraded in an acidic environment; an enteric-coated capsule or a specially formulated paste must be used to allow delivery of the active drug to the small intestine for absorption. An increase in gastric pH and a decrease in acid output are evident 5 to 8 hours after omeprazole paste administration. 1353 Omeprazole (GastroGard, Merial, Ltd., Duluth, GA) is the only currently FDA-approved agent for the treatment of EGUS in the United States; other preparations, including enteric-coated granules and buffered formulations, are available elsewhere. [1354] [1355] [1356] In the United States, compounded preparations have shown limited to no efficacy in pharmacodynamic and clinical trials, 1357, 1358 and GastroGard was the only product (including buffers, H 2 -receptor antagonists, sucralfate, and compounded preparations) that decreased the odds of gastric ulceration in a population of racehorses. 1359 Several studies have documented the safety of oral omeprazole in foals and adult horses. 1360, 1361 Omeprazole appears more effective for ulcer healing than either ranitidine or cimetidine. 1362, 1363 Omeprazole (4 mg/kg PO q 24 h) has consistently demonstrated efficacy of (70%-80% healing) for ESGD, including Thoroughbreds maintained in race training. 816, 815, 1362, [1364] [1365] [1366] Treatment with 1 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, or 4 mg/kg orally every 24 hours decreases or prevents disease or the recurrence of disease in horses maintained in training. 815, 1330, 1367, 1368 Other preparations have shown efficacy for ESGD healing at lower dosages (1 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg PO q 24 h) in clinical trials, 1354, 1369, 1370 although a lower dosage is not yet recommended for treatment. Preexercise versus postexercise administration did not have a significant effect on healing of ESGD or EGGD in a recent trial. 1371 Duration of therapy for ESGD has been recommended for 28 days, although most healing likely occurs within 21 days. 1364 In summary, the primary current recommendation for treatment of ESGD is omeprazole, 4 mg/kg PO q 24 h for 21 to 28 days. In locations in which the enteric-coated granule formation is available, 1 mg/kg may be substituted. Alternate recommendations include ranitidine or lower dosages of omeprazole. 1285 Lower healing rates (25%) have recently been reported following omeprazole treatment for EGGD. 1354, 1370, 1371 Omeprazole (4 mg/kg) also has demonstrated efficacy for raising intragastric pH in clinically normal 1372 or critically ill 1373 foals and for ulcer healing in foals. 1366 The definitive reason for this is unknown but may be related to timing or duration of acid suppression. A bacterial role in EGGD has not been established, despite solid efforts, and the addition of trimethoprim-sulfa did not have apparent benefit in ulcer healing. 1374 Because these factors and basic principles of responsible antimicrobial use, antimicrobial therapy is not recommended for treatment of EGUS in general or EGGD specifically. 1285 Sucralfate is effective in the treatment of peptic ulcers and prevention of stress-induced ulcers in humans, likely via adherence to ulcerated mucosa, stimulation of mucous secretion, enhanced PGE synthesis, and concentration of growth factor at the site of ulceration. 1375 These are all factors relevant to glandular mucosa; thus, its use seems reasonable for treatment of EGGD. In one study, sucralfate did not promote subclinical ulcer healing in foals, relative to corn syrup. 1376 In a recent study, sucralfate (12 mg/kg PO q 12 h) combined with omeprazole (4 mg/kg PO q 24 h) resulted in a 67.5% EGGD healing rate. 1377 Current recommendations for EGGD include omeprazole plus sucralfate at the previously mentioned dosages for a minimum of 4 weeks, followed by repeat gastroscopy. 1285 Therapy for at least 8 weeks should be pursued before the addition of adjunctive therapy.",

[1393] [1394] [1395] [1396] Clinical signs are dependent on the degree of obstruction but include abdominal pain, salivation, and teeth grinding. Complete or near complete obstruction can result in gastric reflux and reflux esophagitis. In foals with congenital pyloric hypertrophy, clinical signs may begin with the consumption of solid feed. In foals, a presumptive diagnosis can be made via gastric endoscopy and radiography (plain and contrast studies). Depending on the cause and severity of disease, gastric endoscopy may provide a presumptive diagnosis in the adult horse. Measurement of gastric emptying can aid the diagnosis. Several methods of measurement are currently available, including nuclear scintigraphy, acetaminophen absorption, and postconsumption [ 13 C]octanoic acid blood or breath testing. 986, 1006, 1397 During an exploratory laparotomy, a distended stomach and thickened pylorus are accompanied by a relatively empty intestinal tract.",

Causes of primary gastric dilatation include gastric impaction, grain engorgement, excessive water intake after exercise, aerophagia, and parasitism. 1396, 1399 Secondary gastric dilatation occurs more commonly and can result from primary intestinal ileus or small or large intestinal obstruction. Time to development of gastric reflux is proportional to the distance to the intestinal segment involved, with duodenal obstruction resulting in reflux within 4 hours. 1400 Clinical signs of gastric dilatation include those associated with acute colic and, in severe cases, ingesta appearing at the nares. Associated laboratory abnormalities include hemoconcentration, hypokalemia, and hypochloremia. 1396 The most common cause of gastric rupture in horses varies among reports. In a retrospective study of 54 horses, gastric rupture occurred most commonly as a secondary phenomenon (65%), usually caused by small intestinal obstruction, with primary gastric dilatation and idiopathic rupture occurring almost equally (15% and 17%, respectively). 1399 In another retrospective study of 50 horses in combination with a search of the Veterinary Medical Database (VMDB), 60% of the gastric rupture cases were classified as idiopathic. 1401 Risk factors for gastric rupture include feeding grass hay, not feeding grain, gelding, and a nonautomatic water source. 1399, 1401 Nasogastric intubation does not preclude the possibility of gastric rupture, and the amount of reflux obtained before rupture is highly variable. 1399 Because of the retrospective nature of these reports, one cannot rule out confounding factors with certainty.",

Although a specific cause is not always evident, ingestion of coarse roughage (straw bedding and poor-quality forage), foreign objects (rubber fencing material), and feed that may swell after ingestion or improper mastication (persimmon seeds, mesquite beans, wheat, barley, and sugar beet pulp) has been implicated. [1404] [1405] [1406] [1407] Possible predisposing factors include poor dentition, poor mastication and rapid consumption of feedstuffs, and inadequate water consumption. Clinical signs can vary from anorexia and weight loss to those consistent with severe abdominal pain. In severe cases, spontaneous reflux may occur, with gastric contents visible at the nares. In cases presenting with acute severe abdominal pain, a diagnosis is often made during exploratory celiotomy. In animals not exhibiting signs of colic warranting surgical intervention, an endoscopic finding of a full stomach after a normally adequate fast (18-24 hours) can often confirm the diagnosis. Abdominal radiographs are reserved for smaller horses and ponies. In addition to pain management, specific treatment consists of gastric lavage via nasogastric intubation or massage and injection of fluid to soften the impaction during laparotomy.

            "text": "Diagnosis of alimentary neoplasia can be challenging. Data collected from a complete blood count, biochemistry panel and urinalysis are rarely confirmatory. Normocytic normochromic anemia of chronic disease is the most common red cell abnormality associated with abdominal neoplasia; blood loss and hemolytic anemia occur less frequently. 1420 Peripheral eosinophilia and MEED have been reported with lymphoma. 1421 Leukocytosis and hyperfibrinogenemia are common. The most common biochemical abnormalities include hypoalbuminemia, hyperglobulinemia, and hypercalcemia. 1422, 1423 Hypoglycemia can occur with pancreatic or hepatic neoplasia. 1423 Rectal examination may detect an abdominal mass, thickening of the intestinal wall, or lymph node enlargement. Rectal biopsy can detect diffuse lymphoma in some cases. 489 Some tumors can exfoliate into the peritoneal cavity, allowing diagnosis via abdominocentesis. 1414, [1424] [1425] [1426] Collecting a large volume of fluid followed by Cytospin and subsequent cytologic evaluation may improve the diagnostic potential; characterization as an inflammatory exudate or modified transudate without any neoplastic cells present is common. Neoplasia was the apparent cause of hemoperitoneum in 13% of cases in one report of 54 cases. 1427 Abdominocentesis accurately predicted neoplasia in 11 of 25 cases in another study. 769 Specific immunoglobulin testing for IgM deficiency may aid in the diagnosis of lymphoma. 1428 DNA cell cycle analysis of suspect neoplastic cells has been used to detect lymphoma in equine patients confirmed with the disease. This method of evaluating fluid or tissue aspirates may increase the accuracy for diagnosing neoplasia in the future. 1429 Previously mentioned diagnostics, such as endoscopy, contrast radiography, and cross-sectional imaging may be helpful depending on tumor location. For abdominal neoplasia, transcutaneous ultrasonography is often most useful. An experienced sonographer and thorough examination are likely to improve diagnostic yield. 46 Laparoscopy or exploratory laparotomy may be required to obtain a final diagnosis.",

The term lymphoma is preferred over lymphosarcoma because there is no benign form of this disease. 1423 Lymphoma originates from lymphoid tissue and predominantly affects intestinal lymph nodes. Chronic weight loss, intermittent colic, and fever are the most common clinical findings 502,1430 ; chronic diarrhea, 1431 pruritus, and alopecia 1432 have been reported. Peripheral lymphadenopathy is not generally noted, but enlargement of mesenteric lym phadenopathy may be palpable rectally. Therapeutic large colon resection has been reported in two horses with lymphoma. 1433 SCC is the second most common neoplasia in the horse and is the most common tumor of the proximal gastrointestinal tract. 1434 In the oral cavity SCC may affect the lips, tongue, hard palate, pharynx, and oral mucosa. 1435, 1436 Metastasis beyond the regional lymph nodes is rare for oral, esophageal, and SCC, although it is possible. Abnormal masses were palpable rectally in 4 of 5 cases of gastric SCC. 1416 Most discussions of SCC treatment about the head are based on dermal, ocular, and adnexal SCC, which are more common. Available treatment includes surgical resection, iridium-192 brachytherapy, 5-fluorouracil, and intralesional cisplatin or carboplatin. [1437] [1438] [1439] [1440] [1441] The prognosis for survival is good if complete resection is possible, although it typically is not for gastric SCC. 1423 Local recurrence is possible. One report of recurring SCC on the lip with metastasis to the lymph nodes was successfully treated with piroxicam over 58 months. 1442 Hypertrophic osteopathy secondary to gastric SCC has been documented in one horse. 1443 Adenocarcinoma has been reported in the small intestine, cecum, and large colon. 1412, 1434, 1444 The tumor arises from the glandular crypts of the gastrointestinal tract and has been reported in middle-aged and older horses. Metastasis to the lymph nodes, liver, and lungs is possible; osseous metaplasia has also been reported. 1445 In a retrospective study of intestinal neoplasia, adenocarcinoma represented 32% of cases, 82% of which involved the small intestine. 1412 The short-term prognosis for resectable adenocarcinoma is fair; long-term prognosis remains poor. 1412, 1446 Leiomyosarcoma and leiomyoma are malignant and benign, respectively, tumors of the smooth muscle lining the gastrointestinal tract. Both have been reported in the stomach, small intestine, and small colon/rectum; leiomyoma has also been reported in the omentum. 1434, [1447] [1448] [1449] [1450] [1451] [1452] [1453] Clinical signs are consistent with intestinal obstruction, and prognosis is favorable with resection of the affected intestinal segment.",

Ameloblastoma occurs in horses >10 years old, and it mainly affects the mandible. Ameloblastic odontoma affects younger horses and usually involves the maxilla. Both are benign but locally invasive. Radiographs may distinguish between an ameloblastoma (radiolucent lesion) and ameloblastic odontoma (radiolucent lesion with partially mineralized density). The best treatment option is surgical resection and/or radiation therapy regardless of the type. 1454 Juvenile mandibular ossifying fibroma occurs in the rostral mandible of young horses between the age of 2 months and 2 years. It may cause significant distortion of the bone. Surgical excision of the mass has a good prognosis if diagnosed early. 1455 Melanomas, sarcoids, SCC, and papilloma can occur on the mouth and lips. Melanomas are commonly found in the commissure of the lips and parotid salivary glands and can metastasize to regional lymph nodes. Sarcoids can cause local ulcerations of the buccal mucosa, which are difficult to treat. Intralesional cisplatin, cryosurgery, radiation, and laser excision have been tried with limited success. Equine papilloma virus is responsible for the common skin wart that is found on the lips and muzzle of young horses. These lesions are typically self-limiting, but cryosurgery or excision can be used for removal, if desired.",
