            "text": "Coronaviridae. To evaluate the lung pathology in this life-threatening respiratory illness, we studied postmortem lung sections from 8 patients who died from SARS during the spring 2003 Singapore outbreak. The predominant pattern of lung injury in all 8 cases was diffuse alveolar damage. The histology varied according to the duration of illness. Cases of 10 or fewer days' duration demonstrated acute-phase diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), airspace edema, and bronchiolar fibrin. Cases of more than 10 days' duration exhibited organizing-phase DAD, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, multinucleated giant cells, and acute bronchopneumonia. In acute-phase DAD, pancytokeratin staining was positive in hyaline membranes along alveolar walls and highlighted the absence of pneumocytes. Multinucleated cells were shown to be both type II pneumocytes and macrophages by pancytokeratin, thyroid transcription factor-1, and CD68 staining. SARS-CoV RNA was identified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in 7 of 8 cases in fresh autopsy tissue and in 8 of 8 cases in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung tissue, including the 1 negative case in fresh tissue. Understanding the pathology of DAD in SARS patients may provide the basis for therapeutic strategies. Further studies of the pathogenesis of SARS may reveal new insight into the mechanisms of DAD.

As outbreaks occurred in Hong Kong, Viet Nam, and Singapore, the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) swept around the globe via routes of international air travel. Human coronaviruses were first described in the 1960s and are known to cause up to 30% of colds. Although the infectious agent of the SARS epidemic is apparently new, injury to the lower respiratory tract secondary to coronavirus infection is not unprecedented. Wheezing in asthmatic children and acute lower respiratory tract disease in infants and military recruits have been associated with coronavi-ruses in the past. [1] [2] [3] [4] To help improve understanding of the lower respiratory tract injury in SARS, we describe the microscopic findings in 8 patients who died from SARS during the Singapore outbreak.",

Rare multinucleated cells appeared to be either macrophages with CD68 staining or type II pneumocytes with pancytokeratin and TTF-1 staining ( Fig  5) . No intranuclear or intracytoplasmic viral inclusions were identified. Whereas occasional pneumocytes and macrophages demonstrated fine cytoplasmic vacuoles, vacuolization was not a striking feature in these cases. The numbers of macrophages within alveolar spaces did not appear to be significantly different from the numbers typically seen in non-SARS organizing DAD. Hemophagocytosis was not identified.",

            "text": "In the 8 SARS patients that we studied, the primary pathology in the lung was DAD. The histological correlate of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), DAD has numerous possible causes, including infections, inhalants, ingestants, drugs, shock, sepsis, radiation, and miscellaneous injuries such as acute pancreatitis, burns, and uremia. Based on our SARS cases, we were able to show a correlation between pulmonary histological findings and the clinical course, with acute patterns of DAD seen in illnesses of 10 or fewer days' duration and organizing patterns of DAD seen in illnesses of more than 10 days' duration. So far, this contrast in histology based on duration of illness has not been emphasized in SARS. This finding generally fits with previously recognized concepts of histological phases of DAD in other settings. 9, 10 Given that SARS-CoV has been identified as the cause of SARS, 11 the etiology of DAD in these patients is presumably direct pulmonary epithelial infection by the SARS-CoV. However, the precise mechanism of alveolar wall damage remains to be elucidated. Some viruses can be identified in histological sections by their characteristic tissue response and cytopathic changes. For example, the combination of bronchiolar necrosis and smudge cells is virtually diagnostic of adenovirus pneumonia. Although SARS-CoV did not appear to produce a unique tissue response with characteristic cytopathic changes in this cohort, injury to bronchioles and alveolar epithelium was evident. Three of 4 patients with shorter illnesses demonstrated deposition of fibrin in bronchioles, accompanied by loss of cilia, bronchiole epithelial denudation, and focal deposition of fibrin along the exposed basement membrane, features similar to those described by Nicholls et al. 12 The histological findings of bronchiolar injury correlated with small airway injury characterized by expiratory phase mosaic attenuation on high-resolution chest computed tomography in convalescing SARS patients (Yeun-Chung Chang, MD, and Jeffrey R. Galvin, MD, unpublished data). Interestingly, we saw strong pancytokeratin staining of hyaline membranes in the cases exhibiting acute-phase DAD. No type I or type II pneumocytes were evident on pancytokeratin immunostains beneath the hyaline membranes, suggesting massive type I pneumocyte necrosis. The paucity of pancytokeratin-positive cells lining alveolar walls on immunostaining in these 3 cases suggests that type I pneumocytes had been lost and the reparative function of type II pneumocyte hyperplasia had not yet started. These findings are consistent with recognized patterns of pneumocyte injury and proliferation in DAD, 9, 10 as well as the recent description of pancytokeratin staining of hyaline membranes in DAD. 13 Type II pneumocyte hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia are commonly recognized as reparative features in lung injury, and both can display significant cellular atypia. In the present study, hyperplastic type II pneumocytes showed rather striking cytological changes, including cytomegaly, nucleomegaly, clearing of nuclear chromatin, prominent nucleoli, and multinucleation. Ksiazek et al 14 described cell rounding, a refractive appearance, and cell detachment in Vero E6 cells inoculated with oropharyngeal material from patients with SARS. Examination of the effected Vero E6 cells by electron microscopy revealed characteristic coronavirus particles within the cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and in vesicles. Although the cytological changes observed in our study may well be viral induced, specific light-microscopy markers of viral infection, such as intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusions, were absent. Although severe and suspicious for direct viral effect, the cytological changes seen in our cases were within the spectrum of epithelial changes seen in non-SARS cases of DAD. In the absence of ancillary studies such as immunohistochemistry, the lack of a unique tissue response and cytopathic effect makes the diagnosis of SARS difficult at the light-microscopy level.",

Loss of cilia, denudation of the bronchiolar epithelium, and luminal deposition of fibrin provide evidence of injury to the bronchiolar epithelium. Hyaline membrane formation is typically the result of alveolar epithelial necrosis, which is demonstrated in this study by the absence of alveolar lining cells on the pancytokeratin immunostain.
