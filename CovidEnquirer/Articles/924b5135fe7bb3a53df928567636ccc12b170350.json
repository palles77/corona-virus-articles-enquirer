The available policies do not train health-care professional students (physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and so on) to directly excel in disaster management competencies.

The project has wide application and was tested for its use during the Syrian refugee crisis when a number of immigrants who were non-English speaking women, children, and elderly reached Europe. The software is called PictoRx and the Arabic version was added to the software in 2015 to help the refugees. The previously available languages included English, French, Spanish, Dutch, Maori, German, Chinese, and Polish. PictoRx software is used to aid local pharmacists in routine dispensing by ensuring that patients receiving the medicines are provided with the proper counseling using pictograms and printed labels. It has been tested in several communities across the globe, including Germany, the recipient of largest number of Syrian refugees. The project has been granted WHO Grant on Patient Safety in 2010 and the 2009 Canada Post Community Literacy Award. An improved version of the software is developed by Applied Research and Innovation at the Algonquin College, O Ottawa, Canada. The software is available as online or offline version from the home page (www.fip.org/ pictograms, https://www.fip.org/pictogramsoftware). The software provides printable material and labels for use as the counseling aids to the patient.

These Interagency Guidelines for Drug Donations are developed and endorsed by Caritas Internationalis, Churches Action for Health of the World Council of Churches, International Committee of the Red Cross, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, International Pharmaceutical Federation, Medicines Sans Frontieres (MSF), Oxfam, Pharmaciens Sans Frontieres, The Joint United Nations Commission on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), World Bank, and WHO.
