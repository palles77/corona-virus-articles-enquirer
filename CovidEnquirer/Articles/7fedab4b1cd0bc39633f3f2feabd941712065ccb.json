These colonies are usually kept in one air space, for example a shed or a room in the house. This has implications both for the care of the animals and the epidemiology of disease. Many of these production animals are also show animals, exposing them to fnrther dangers of stress and infectious disease, and are used in breeding programs (eg, as studs).

The main advantage of this technique is that the semen can be diluted to the point of being able to inseminate up to 500 does, which is useful in selective breeding programs, in inseminating does at more than one site, and in conceiving offspring from genetically valuable stock without the risks associated with being housed together or \"natural\" mating (eg, venereal infections like Treponema). Disadvantages of artificial insemina-tion include the increased observation of the female to ascertain the optimum insemination time, which is indicated by the color of the xnalva; white has approximately 35% conception rate, pink has a conception rate of 55%, red is optimum with a 75% conception rate, and dark red is documented as a 40% conception rate. ~ Selection of doe and buck, as well as affected by breed standards, should be influenced by other factors such as medical history; rabbits with a history of dental malocclusion, for example, should not be bred from if there is a suspicion it could be caused by congenital malformation. While tempting to select for large litters, does should be selected for the numbers of kits weaned rather than numbers of kits born. Richardson 4 advises against having more than 3 litters per year. However, 8 litters per year with up to 9 young per litter are possible. At this level, colony stock selection has been for litter size and reliable conception, and diets with high protein and fiber (17% protein, 17% fiber2). Metabolically this is a demanding target, and the formulation of the diet poses a risk of developing enterotoxemia. A more realistic target would be for 4 or 5 litters per year on a diet with a higher fiber content and lower protein, typically around 20% fiber and 14% protein.",

The virus is present in saliva and nasal discharges from affected rabbits. Transmission can be direct (eg, by mutual grooming or aerosol) or indirect (contact with soiled cage materials, on clothing, blood-sucking vectors, or food or water). The clinical syndrome of convulsions, epistaxis, lethargy, anorexia, dyspnea, pain (even vocalization) affects only rabbits over 6 weeks of age. Incubation is up to 3 days, and so in endemic areas, in the face of an outbreak, or with stock of unknown background, quarantine of new stock should be instituted.

It is spread by aerosol transmission and becomes a problem in colonies kept together in the same airspace, although not all infected rabbits develop the clinical condition; some become carriers. Because of the still-developing nasal anatomy and the presence of maternal antibodies, the disease is not usually seen in young rabbits under the age of 3 months. When pasteurellosis is endemic in a colony, it is possible to take advantage of this resistance by weaning early (at about 5 weeks), establishing a pasteurellosis-free colony. Prevention is based on husbandry and management: good ventilation, quarantine of new stock whose status is unknown, and good nutrition of existing stock. Richardson 4 reports that the ovinekilled PasteureUa vaccine (Pastacidin; Hoechst Roussel Vet Ltd, Milton-Keynes, UK) can be used in young rabbits (0.25 to 0.5 mL) and in adults (0.5 to 1 mL). This is given as a subcutaneous injection at weaning and repeated 2 weeks later. Does can be vaccinated before mating, maximizing maternal antibodies in the colostrum. Bucks are vaccinated every 6 months. It is, of course, important to discuss and gain informed written consent from the owner before using an unauthorized vaccine in this way, but it provides an alternative strategy if a colony is infected.",

It is caused by the energy requirements of the last stages of gestation and of increasing lactation, particularly in primiparous obese sows that become anorexic for any reason (eg, any stress or disease) or who have a low-energy diet in this critical month. There is also a \"toxic\" form where oversized fetuses compress the aorta in such a way as to cause uterine ischemia, fetal death, and disseminated intravascular coagula-tion. The sow requires more calories than can be eaten, and the subsequent rapid catabolism of adipose tissue can result in ketone production. The affected sow can die abruptly or deteriorate slowly over a week. Symptoms are nonspecific (including lethargy, adipsia, salivation, inco-ordination, hyperexcitability, and dyspnea) but when seen in a sow in this critical period, there should be a high index of suspicion. Diagnosis can be confirmed by testing for protein or ketones in urine (which will be acidic) using a dip-stick, and/or finding hypoglycemia and hyperlipemia on blood sample (lateral saphenous vein is the best site). Nakamura 6 describes treatment as unrewarding, but advises intravenous or intraosseous fuids, intravenous or oral dextrose, and calcium gluconate injection. Steroids can be used if the sow goes into shock.",

When successful, another mating can be attempted after 4 days to see whether the female is back in estrus or not, but if the female is pregnant her abdomen becomes noticeably swollen at about 10 days after mating.

It is caused by Lawsonia intraceU'ularis. Clinical signs are of lethargy, anorexia, poor coat, weight loss, watery diarrhea, and a hunched posture caused by abdominal pain. Death occurs within 24 to 48 hours. Diagnosis is by signalment, clinical signs, and posb morteln (thickened and edematous distal ileum, cecum, and proximal colon). Treatment is aimed at reducing mortality through the use of antibiotics (tetracycline at 400 mg/L of drinking water, enrofloxacin at 10 mg/kg twice daily per os, or trimethoprim sulphonamide combination 30 mg/kg t~dce daily per os), aggressive fluid therapy, and warmth.",
