The N protein can also induce high titers of cross-reactive antibodies and cell-mediated immunity, which protects chickens from acute infection. In this study, we generated two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), designated as 6D10 and 4F10, which were directed against the N protein of IBV using the whole viral particles as immunogens. Both of the mAbs do not cross react with Newcastle disease virus (NDV), infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) and subtype H9 avian influenza virus (AIV). After screening a phage display peptide library and peptide scanning, we identified two linear B-cell epitopes that were recognized by the mAbs 6D10 and 4F10, which corresponded to the amino acid sequences 242 FGPRTK 247 and 195 DLIARAAKI 203 , respectively, in the IBV N protein. Alignments of amino acid sequences from a large number of IBV isolates indicated that the two epitopes, especially 242 FGPRTK 247 , were well conserved among IBV strains. This conclusion was further confirmed by the relationships of 18 heterologous sequences to the 2 mAbs. The novel mAbs and the epitopes identified will be useful for developing diagnostic assays for IBV infections.",

            "text": "Like the typical genomic organization found in other gammacoronaviruses, the 3 end of the IBV genome contains the main structural genes; the spike glycoprotein (S), the small membrane protein (E), the integral membrane protein (M), and the nucleocapsid protein (N), as well as several accessory genes, usually in the order S-Gene 3-E-M-Gene 5-N (Boursnell et al., 1987) . The S1 subunit of the S protein carries virus-neutralizing and serotype-specific determinants, but it exhibits high sequence diversity among different IBV serotypes. By contrast, the N protein is highly conserved with 91.0-96.5% similarity in different IBV strains (William et al., 1992) . Its primary function is the formation of the viral ribonucleoprotein complex, but it is also considered that the IBV N protein is multifunctional. Its intracellular localization suggests that it is a likely component of the coronavirus replication and transcription complex. Furthermore, the N protein can induce high titers of cross-reactive antibodies and cell-mediated immunity, which protects chickens from acute infections (Ignjatovic and Galli, 1994; Seo et al., 1997; Tang et al., 2008) . Most of the IBV N protein is composed of 409 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 45 kDa. The N protein is a phosphoprotein that can bind viral RNA with high affinity and it is expressed abundantly during infections (Cavanagh, 2005) . Thus, it is a target protein when designing infectious bronchitis (IB) vaccines and a frequent target of diagnostic applications (Chen et al., 2003; Gibertoni et al., 2005; Ndifuna et al., 1998) . However, most of the diagnostic assays had been focused on the antibody detection using recombinant N proteins. In the sampling practices in poultry farms in China, it is very common to take tracheal swabs to look for respiratory virus infections, though it is also very common to take blood samples to detect antibody. Hence, new assays focusing on virus detection, such as using mAb(s) against N protein, would be an improvement on current available diagnostic assays.",

Together with co-stimulation by T-lymphocytes, na\u00efve Bcells become fully activated then proliferate and differentiate into memory and plasma cells, while the latter act as key engines for producing specific antibodies. The identification and mapping of B-cell epitopes on antigens has been a subject of intense research because knowledge of these markers has profound implications for the development of peptide-based diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. B-cell epitopes may consist of linear, contiguous stretches of amino acids in a protein, or they can be discontinuous stretches of amino acids that are brought together spatially via protein folding. The majority of B-cell epitopes are discontinuous in nature, but difficulties in the design of such epitopes have led to an emphasis on the identification of linear B-cell epitopes. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are used widely as powerful tools for identifying linear epitopes, or for mimicking the epitopes of a variety of infectious agents (Deng et al., 2007; Kaverin et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2011) . In this study, we prepared mAbs against the N protein of IBV strain tl/CH/LDT3/03I and used them to screen for linear B-cell epitopes. The results provided important insights that could facilitate the development of possible specific diagnostics for IBV infection and that further our understanding of the antigenic structure of N protein.",

To investigate the reactivity of the 2 mAbs, 25 heterogeneous IBV strains, i.e., 20 field strains and 5 vaccine strains, were used as representatives of different IBV types (Liu et al., 2006; Ma et al., 2012) .

To the best of our knowledge, these 2 epitopes are the first finely mapped B-cell epitopes for the IBV N protein. In a previous study, Seah et al.

We selected 18 heterologous IBV strains to test whether they could be recognized by the 2 mAbs by Western blotting, which further highlighted their suitability for the development of a diagnostic method using the mAbs and/or the epitope-containing sequences in the N gene. A large number of IBV N gene sequences were available in GenBank and a phylogenetic tree was constructed, which was used as a criterion for the selection of IBV strains. Remarkably, the phylogenetic relationship among IBV strains based on the N gene did not parallel those based on the S1 genes (Han et al., 2011) , which may be explained by recombination events in the genomes of IBV strains (Jackwood et al., 2010) . There was a lack of IBV strains in group V in our laboratory (this group only contained viruses isolated in Australia) and the 18 viruses selected in this study only came from the four remaining groups (groups I-IV). Nevertheless, all of the heterologous IBV strains selected were well recognized by the 2 mAbs, which suggested Fig. 8 . Detection of viruses from tracheal swabs using western blotting and virus recovery. Of the 10 tracheal swab samples collected from H120 vaccinated broilers, 5 and 6 can be detected by the mAbs 6D10 and 4F10, respectively, by using Western blotting, however, 9 of these samples are positive in virus recovery. that the epitopes recognized by the 2 mAbs were conserved among the heterologous IBV strains. However, by using Western blotting, IB viruses can not be detected from some of the tracheal swabs of chickens which recently vaccinated with H120 vaccines, which may be due to the limited viruses.",

The detection of IBV infections of poultry flocks is a major challenge because of the difficulty in differentiating this condition from other upper respiratory diseases. Thus, appropriate diagnostic methods are needed and they are an important tool for taking appropriate preventive steps. Another problem that complicates IBV detection and diagnosis is the existence of multiple serotypes of IBV, which co-circulate in vaccinated and non-vaccinated chicken flocks . The astonishing diversity of IBV in chickens is probably a result of the higher mutation rate of RNA viruses due to the infidelity of their polymerases and higher opportunity for recombination because of their unique replication mechanism, which suggests that there are probably many other unknown types and that many more will emerge in chickens.",

However, because the 2 mAbs can recognize both field isolates and commonly used vaccine strains, they can not be used for developing diagnostic molecular assays to differentiate between field isolates and vaccines. In addition, we have identified a small amount of variations across both epitopes by comparing IBV N gene sequences in the GenBank database. However, because of the limited IBV strains available in our laboratory, we only tested cross-reactivity of 18 heterogeneous IBV strains which contained identical sequences over the epitope regions. In the future study, we will generate a series recombinant N proteins by mutating the GST-N constructs according to the sequence variations across both epitopes to identify the reactivity of the two antibodies to non-identical sequences of N proteins. Nevertheless, the development of these diagnostic assays will be very challenging.",
