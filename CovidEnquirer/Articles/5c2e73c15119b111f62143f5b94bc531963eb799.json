The studies of nucleic acid synthesis in Li210 cells using j3H]cytidine as a precursor showed that 2', 3', inhibited DNA synthesis at a lower concentration (29 FM for SO% inhibition) than was needed for the inhibition of RNA synthesis and formation of [jH]deoxycytidine nucleotides in the acid-soluble fraction (320 and 820 PM for SO% inhibition respectively). These results indicate that 2', 3', inhibits DNA synthesis in L1210 cells through other mechanisms rather than exclusively through the inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase activity.",
