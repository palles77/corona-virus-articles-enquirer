Although there is a substantial body of literature characterizing the microbial community found in wastewater, only a few studies have characterized the viral component of WTC aerosols, despite the fact that most diseases affecting WTC workers are of viral origin and that some of these viruses are transmitted through the air. In this study, we evaluated in four WTCs the presence of 11 viral pathogens of particular concern in this milieu and used a metagenomic approach to characterize the total viral community in the air of one of those WTCs. The presence of viruses in aerosols in different locations of individual WTCs was evaluated and the results obtained with four commonly used air samplers were compared.",

They experience respiratory symptoms, fevers, gastrointestinal symptoms, and headaches more often than the non-exposed population (Khuder et al., 1998; Smit et al., 2005; Van Hooste et al., 2010) .

Previous studies have demonstrated the presence of human pathogenic viruses in influent water, including noroviruses (Pouillot et al., 2015; Qiu et al., 2015) and rotaviruses (Baggi et al., 2001; Qiu et al., 2015) that cause gastroenteritis; adenoviruses (Osuolale and Okoh, 2015; Qiu et al., 2015) , rhinoviruses and enteroviruses (Baggi et al., 2001 , Qiu et al., 2015 that are responsible for the common cold, and even herpes simplex viruses, which can cause oral and genital sores and blisters (Bibby and Peccia, 2013) . Among the viruses detected at WTCs, many of these pathogens are transmitted by aerosols (Tseng et al., 2010; Bonifait et al., 2015) . Despite the importance of this route of transmission, surprisingly few studies have examined the potential exposure of WTC workers to pathogenic viruses through the air. Moreover, in these studies, only one or two viruses were analyzed (Romano et al., 1999; Uhrbrand et al., 2011; Masclaux et al., 2014) . In Denmark WTCs, noroviruses (Noro) GI and GII were detected for the first time in air samples using personal samplers (Uhrbrand et al., 2011) . Adenovirus (AdV), hepatitis E virus (HEV) and norovirus were also investigated in air samples from 31 Swiss WTCs. The researchers found AdV, noroviruses and HEV in 100%, 2% and 0%, respectively of the WTC aerosols tested (Masclaux et al., 2014) . Enterovirus and reovirus were identified in 3.4% of the air samples from an aerosol study of WTCs in Italy (Romano et al., 1999) .",

Rotavirus is a double-stranded RNA virus and as RNA is extremely fragile and rapidly degraded by RNases found ubiquitously in nature, there is a chance that samplers with a flow rate higher than 200 L/min tend to lead to the degradation of less robust RNA virus species during collection (Cao et al., 2011; Toulouse et al., 2014) . The Marple and the Coriolis are based on two completely different capture mechanisms; filtration and liquid impaction. Both of these mechanisms may induce particle loss (bouncing and re-aerosolization). The different sizes and characteristics of the eleven selected viruses likely also plays a role in the capture efficiency of each sampler, as some enveloped or non-enveloped viruses are more or less resistant to desiccation caused by the sampling times and rates. Marple samples also suggest a wide range of particles sizes carrying viruses, suggesting lower and upper respiratory tract exposure. In both cases, viruses can either remain in the lungs or upper tract or be subsequently swallowed.",

The sites that showed the highest concentrations of rotaviruses were also the sights that had the highest concentration of total viruses (e.g., biofiltration sites of WTCs 1 and 2). Inhalation of pathogenic viruses causing respiratory infections has been studied over the years since it represents a preferential route of transmission for some viruses. Rotavirus is known to cause gastroenteritis. The infectious dose of this virus through the oral route is below 100 viral particles (Payne et al., 2011) , which was 10 4 times less than the concentrations of genome copies detected by cubic meter in this study, although we did not test for viral infectivity. It is clear from our data that additional studies should be performed to determine the concentration of infectious viruses in WTC aerosols. The impact on human health of aerosol exposure to viruses such as HAV has not been documented, as they are not known to be transmitted through the airborne route. However, the possibility of these viruses infecting a host via the air pathway cannot be ruled out, and raises another avenue of future research. As mentioned before, WTC workers experience symptoms such as fever, nausea and vomiting that could be linked to infections by HAV. Like HAV, the possibility of rotavirus transmission via the air has not been examined to date, nevertheless, the fact that these viruses have been detected in air samples from a hospital (Dennehy et al., 1998) likelihood of transmission via aerosol. In addition, a recent study performed by our team showed that norovirus, a virus responsible for gastroenteritis outbreaks worldwide, can be present in the air (Bonifait et al., 2015) , suggesting that perhaps other viruses that cause the same disease, like rotaviruses, could follow the same pattern. Establishing whether aerosol transmission of these viruses is a viable route is critical if we are to better understand the occupational risks of WTC workers. In this study, Noroviruses GI and GII were not detected although WTC workers personal air samplers were positive in previous studies (Uhrbrand et al., 2011; Masclaux et al., 2014) . This may be due to differences in flowrate between our samplers and the personal samplers. The flowrate of personal samplers, which use gelatin filters, is much less than the devices we used (except for the Marple). It is possible that norovirus, an RNA virus that is easily damaged by a greater airflow, was removed during sampling in our study. hAdV was not detected Coriolis and Marple samples, this virus was observed in a previous study (Masclaux et al., 2014) . Enterovirus was not detected at all, which is consistent with the literature data where only 2 out of 118 samples were positive (Romano et al., 1999) .",

Although this study did not aim to document the surface contamination by viruses, workers can also be exposed to viral particles deposited on surfaces via aerosol deposition, i.e., the fomite transmission route. In this pathway, aerosolized viruses adsorb to charged fomites on a surface. The fomite with the pathogen can then come into contact with a worker, his or her hand for example. The worker is subsequently infected when he/she touches his/her mouth and/or eyes. Many viruses remain infectious for extended periods of time after deposition. For example, HAV and rotavirus remain infectious for more than two months on fomites (Boone and Gerba, 2007) . This route of infection has been proven for many viral pathogens, including rotavirus (Butz et al., 1993; Hota, 2004) , HAV (Sundkvist et al., 2000; Aitken and Jeffries, 2001) , and AdV (Abad et al., 1994; Aitken and Jeffries, 2001; Hamada et al., 2008) among others, and yet remains an underestimated and understudied risk for workers.",

However, the fact that the majority of sequences that we were able to identify were not viral in origin was not surprising. While some viral metagenomic libraries are constructed with enriched or purified viral nucleic acids, in this study, we chose to sequence unpurified and unenriched samples directly in order to avoid removing viruses adsorbed to large agglomerates of particles in the air (data not shown). The most likely reason for the low number of RNA viral sequences detected in our study is that we did not achieve an adequate depth of sequencing to fully characterize this relatively minor component of the total sequences in our samples and why the viruses targeted by qPCR were not present in our metagenomic results.",

This suggests that low flowrate samplers may result in a better recovery of RNA viruses in these conditions.

Nonetheless, the greater rate of airflow and the extended sampling period of these devices can damage the particles and organisms collected by the sampler (Toulouse et al., 2014) .
