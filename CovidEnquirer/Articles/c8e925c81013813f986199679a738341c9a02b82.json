Basal core promoter mutations (BCP), associated with the clinical course of chronic HBV infection, affect HBV-X at 130-131 positions. The role of these mutations on HBV-X biological activity remains largely unknown. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of the presence of different amino acids at 130-131 positions of HBV-X on the biological activity of the protein. Transient expression of wild type and mutant F1b and F4 HBV-X increased cell mortality by the induction of apoptosis in human hepatoma cells. The wild type and mutant HBV-X differentially modulate the expression of pro-apoptotic (Bax) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2 and Bcl-X) regulatory proteins of the Bcl-2 family. Furthermore, the expression of HBV-X variants of both subgenotypes induced autophagy of human tumoral hepatocytes. In conclusion, HBV-X variants of the Latin American HBV F genotype promotes human hepatocytes death by the induction of apoptosis and autophagy. The results of this work describe some of the molecular mechanisms by which HBV-X variants contribute to the pathogenesis of liver diseases in the infected liver and help to the biological characterization of genotype F, responsible of the majority of HBV infections in Argentina.",

The deregulation of apoptosis is involved in a wide range of pathological processes, including development of HCC (Schattenberg et al., 2011) . Numerous studies have shown that HBV-X can modulate programmed cell death with a dual effect, either by inhibiting or stimulating apoptosis. It has been reported that HBV-X induces apoptosis by causing loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Shirakata and Koike, 2003) , inducing Fas ligand gene expression (Yoo and Lee, 2004) , increasing Bax translocation to the mitochondria (Kim et al., 2008) , activating caspase 8 (Kuo et al., 2012) , perturbing intracellular calcium homeostasis (Chami et al., 2003) or by interaction with cellular FLICE inhibitory protein (Kim and Seong, 2003) . By contrast, in other studies HBV-X could also inhibit apoptosis by increasing NF-\u03baB activity, activating the PI3 K pathway or inhibiting caspase 3 activity. These controversial results can be explained considering that HBV-X can modulate pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic pathways depending on culture conditions, cellular types and protein expression levels (Rawat et al., 2012) .",

This mechanism plays an important role in maintaining cellular homeostasis, as prevents the accumulation of protein aggregates and damaged organelles in the cell. The dysfunction of autophagy has been implicated in multiple diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, muscle diseases, cancer, cardiac diseases, and infectious diseases (Levine and Kroemer, 2008) . Autophagy has also been implicated in innate and adaptive immune responses against intracellular microbial pathogens (Desai et al., 2015) . However, many viruses have evolved mechanisms to use this pathway to benefit their own replications. For example, several single-stranded RNA viruses such as poliovirus, coronavirus, dengue virus, and hepatitis C virus induce the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles and use these membrane vesicles to enhance their replication (Jackson, 2015; Ke and Chen, 2014; Panyasrivanit et al., 2009; Richards and Jackson, 2013) . In contrast, other viruses such as herpes simplex virus-1, cytomegalovirus, and Kaposi's sarcoma herpes virus have evolved mechanisms to suppress autophagy for its own survival (Deretic and Levine, 2009 ). Furthermore, recent studies showed that HBV could also enhance and use autophagy for its DNA replication, and this enhancement of autophagy might be mediated by HBV-X (Liu et al., 2014; Sir et al., 2010b; Yang et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2016) . The persistent activation of autophagy in infected hepatocytes during chronic infection may play an important role in HBV pathogenesis.",

BCP mutations are selected during the natural course of chronic HBV infection and its emergence is associated with pathogenesis. Numerous studies have demonstrated that BCP mutations are frequently present in patients with chronic hepatitis, fulminant hepatitis and HCC and, to a lesser extent, in inactive carriers and immunocompromised patients (Liu et al., 2004; Parekh et al., 2003) . In addition, there is a high correlation between the occurrence of these mutations and the later development of cirrhosis and HCC in chronic patients (Chen and Yang, 2011; Wei et al., 2017) . Due to the overlapping open reading frames in the HBV genome, BCP mutations also affect the X gene, and consequently, HBV-X aminoacidic sequence (Kidd-Ljunggren et al., 1997) . The A1762T/G1764A double mutation, involves the K130 M and V131I changes in HBV-X. Despite the numerous studies conducted on the BCP region, linking these mutations to the pathogenesis of liver disease, very few studies have focused on analyzing the role of BCP mutations in relation to HBV-X biological activity. Because of the multiple functions assigned to this protein, amino acid changes at HBV-X might affect its biological activity and, consequently, its role in the pathogenesis of chronic infection.",

Bax levels were down-regulated in F1b and F4 HBV-X_K/V and HBV-X_M/I expressing cells. The reduction in Bax expression was greater in HBV-X transfected Hep3 B and Huh-7 compared to HepG2, particularly in those cells that expressed both F4 viral proteins. In cells expressing the F1b viral proteins, the levels of Bcl-2 decreased in transfected Hep3 B and Huh-7, however they significantly increased in HepG2 that expressed wild type and mutant HBV-X. Whereas, in cells transfected with both F4 HBV-X variants Bcl-2 levels were significantly down-regulated in Huh-7 cells. No significant differences in Bcl-2 expression were observed in transfected HepG2 and Hep3B. On the other hand, the expression of Bcl-X showed a significant increase in all F1b and F4 HBV-X transfected cells. The comparative analysis between HBV-X_K/V and HBV-X_M/I ability to modulate Bcl-2 proteins revealed no significant differences in the expression of the pro and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins in each cell line.

HBV-X was shown to induce (Chirillo et al., 1997; Kim et al., 2008; Kim and Seong, 2003; Miao et al., 2006) , The percentage of early, late and total (early + late) apoptotic cells was quantified. Shown values represent the mean \u00b1 standard deviation of three independent experiments. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.005 and *** p < 0.0001. Fig. 6 . HBV-X_K/V and HBV-X_M/I modulate the expression of the regulatory Bcl-2 family proteins. Hepatoma cells were transfected with a control plasmid (Ct), F1b (A) and F4 (B) wild type HBV-X (KV) and mutant HBV-X (MI), and protein expression levels of Bax, Bcl-2 and Bcl-X were analyzed by Western Blot. Protein ratios normalized to \u03b2-actin were used to quantify fold changes relative to the control. Shown values represent the mean \u00b1 standard deviation of three independent experiments. * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.005 and *** p < 0.0001. M.M. Elizalde et al. Virus Research 242 (2017) 156-165 inhibit (Diao et al., 2001; Pan et al., 2001) or have no effect on apoptosis (Madden et al., 2000; Yun et al., 2002) . In addition, some studies demonstrated that HBV-X does not directly induce apoptosis in certain cell types, but instead sensitizes these cells to pro-apoptotic stimuli (Su and Schneider, 1997; Wang et al., 2004) . Probably the discrepancy about HBV-X apoptotic activities reflect differences in cell types studied and experimental systems used for these analyses. On the other hand, there are evidences that indicate that HBV-X expression levels are also important for the activity of this protein. HBV-X shows low expression levels during the early stages of HBV infection, which contributes to transcriptional activation and virus replication. In contrast, high levels of HBV-X are seen during the late stages of HBV infection. It is possible that HBV-X is able to inhibit apoptosis at an early stage during hepatocyte infection to facilitate HBV replication, and later it can activate apoptosis to contribute to virus spread (Murakami, 2001) . The discrepant HBV-X activities reported on apoptosis may reflect concentration dependent effects at different stages of natural HBV infection. However, either stimulation or inhibition of apoptosis could lead to malignant transformation of hepatocytes and development of HCC. Inhibition of apoptosis would allow the accumulation of potentially transforming mutations (Arbuthnot et al., 2000) , while enhanced compensatory hepatocyte proliferation, in response to a pro-apoptotic activity, may lead to the selection of premalignant hepatic cells (Koike et al., 1998) .",

The only work considering these variables was conducted by Kanda and co-workers (2004) , who analyzed whether HBV genotypes A, B, C and D or BCP mutations affected HBV-X-induced apoptosis in Huh-7 cells. Apoptosis studies using different assays revealed no differences in the pro-apoptotic activity of HBV-X, regarding different genotypes and HBV-X variants. However, in the present study, Huh-7 was the only cell line that showed significant differences in the percentage of apoptotic induction between wild type and mutant HBV-X from both analyzed subgenotypes. Quantification of apoptotic cells revealed a significant increase in the percentage of apoptosis in cells expressing HBV-X_K/V in relation to HBV-X_M/I for both subgenotypes. These results suggest that in Huh-7 cells the expression of wild type HBV-X has a greater effect on apoptosis induction than mutant HBV-X. The observed differences between both studies might be associated with the experimental systems and the protein expression levels achieved in the two assays. Additionally, it should be noted that both studies examined different viral genotypes, suggesting that HBV-X biological activity may vary according to the genotype.",

An increase in p53 leads to the expression of proapoptotic proteins, which prompt cells to undergo apoptosis. Several studies showed that HBV-X can interact with p53 inhibiting its proapoptotic function, as well as induce hepatocyte apoptosis through a p53-dependent pathway (Truant et al., 1995; Wang et al., 1994) . The different human hepatoma cell lines used in this work are characterized by having different p53 status. HepG2 express wild type p53 protein, Hep3 B have a partially deleted gene with no p53 expression and Huh-7 express a mutant form of p53 protein that show higher expression levels and a longer half-life, leading to its accumulation in the cell nucleus (Bressac et al., 1990) . According to the results of this work, the fact that both HBV-X variants can induce apoptosis in cells with different p53 phenotypes, suggests that wild type and mutant forms of the protein are able to trigger the apoptotic process independently of the p53 status of each cell line.",

Therefore, these results reflect only a small fraction of the complex network of interactions that exist between the Bcl-2 family proteins.

One of the characteristic features of autophagy is its dynamic regulation. Cellular autophagic activity is usually low under basal conditions, but can be markedly up-regulated by numerous stimuli, such as viral replication or production of certain viral proteins (Mizushima et al., 2010) . Given that the autophagosome is an intermediate structure in a dynamic pathway, the number of autophagosomes observed at any specific time point is a function of the balance between the rate of their generation and the rate of their conversion into autolysosomes. Thus, autophagosome accumulation may represent either autophagy induction or, alternatively, suppression of steps in the autophagy pathway downstream of autophagosome formation.",
