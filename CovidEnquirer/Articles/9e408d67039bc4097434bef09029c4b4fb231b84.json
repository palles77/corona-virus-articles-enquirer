Some recent studies have indicated that fever screening using thermography does not provide a satisfactory method of detecting febrile passengers. 9 Considering the defective fever screening method, we previously developed a noncontact screening system for performing medical examinations within 10 s using measured vital signs (i.e. heart rate, respiration rate, and facial temperature). 10 As a result of being infected, not only body temperature but also heart and respiration rates will invariably increase. Therefore by adding heart and respiration rates as new screening parameters, the system provided a higher screening sensitivity than using thermography alone.",

Since a neural network provides an efficient method of classifying multi-dimensional data, we have proposed a method that uses a neural network to distinguish influenza patients from normal control subjects. This method was developed in our previous study, which uses Kohonen's self-organizing map 11 (SOM) and the k-means clustering algorithm 12 (a non-linear clustering algorithm). 13 The advantage of using SOM together with the non-linear clustering algorithm is that it allows the specification of any number of classification groups, not just two. Therefore, it is rational to increase the number of groups to three to investigate whether the higher-risk patients can be gathered together into a newly created group.",

FCM is a non-linear clustering method that is used in a wide range of fields, including biometric recognition, pattern recognition, and medical data mining. 14e16 Unlike the k-means clustering method, FCM supports the use of classified data, which may belong to more than one group but with different degrees of membership. The membership represents the probability that the data belongs to a specific group based on fuzzy logic. Therefore, FCM is suitable for classifying multi-dimensional data without clearly defined boundaries, such as our multiple vital-signs data. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the radar screening system for detecting higher-risk influenza patients in clinical settings. We tested the system at the Japan Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital during the 2012e2013 influenza season.",

The main advantage of this portable system is that it can be used in confined spaces such as inside an aircraft. 18 The system consists of three biosensors, namely, a thermograph to monitor facial temperature (NEC/AVIO Infrared Technologies Co., Ltd., C-200, Japan), a 10-GHz microwave radar for the noncontact determination of the respiration rate 19 (new-JRC, NJR-4175, Japan), and a finger-tip photo-reflector to measure the heart rate (Rohm, RPR-220, Japan). All of the Figure 1 A pulse oximeter module was used to measure the SpO 2 levels. The respiration rate was measured using the 10-GHz respiration radar by monitoring the respiratory motion of the chest, the heart rate was measured by a finger-tip photoreflector, and the facial temperature was measured by means of thermography. The thermograph was placed 45 cm from the subject's face, and the respiration radar was placed 30 cm from the subject's chest. biosensors were integrated into a single instrument body measuring 27 cm long, 28 cm wide, and 10 cm thick. The system is illustrated in Fig. 1 . The signals from the biosensors are sent to a laptop computer, where they are analyzed and displayed in real time. The software environment was developed in LabVIEW (National Instruments, Austin, Texas, USA) for recording the signals and in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA) for calculating the neural network based discriminant function. Within 10 s, the pulse waves, respiratory curves, and facial thermal image are displayed on the laptop screen. The screening results (i.e. '0 Z Non-influenza', '1 Z Lower-risk influenza', or '2 Z Higher-risk influenza') are obtained by the neural network and fuzzy clustering algorithm, based on the derived multiple vital signs (Fig. 2) .",

The most significant advantage of this system is that it can be used to detect influenza patients who have taken medication with normal body temperature. In the present study, although the 35 influenza patients were treated with anti-viral medication and more than half of the patients had normal body temperature, our system attained higher detection sensitivity than that reported in some recent studies using only thermography. 9, 25 This higher sensitivity can be attributed to the fact that, those patients even with normal body temperature under antifebrile medication, exhibited relatively high rates of heart and respiration in comparison with the normal control subjects. The idea of using vital signs stems from the fact that infectious diseases are associated with inflammation when patients become symptomatic. Body temperature, heart, and respiration rates Figure 4 Results of SOM screening with fuzzy clustering algorithm, shown as a three-dimensional scatter plot. The 83 subjects were divided into three groups: the Non-I group (n Z 40), LR-I group (n Z 26), and HR-I group (n Z 17). The 43/83 subjects were classified into an influenza group (red and blue clusters) including 34 influenza patients and 9 misclassified normal control subjects; 40/83 subjects were classified into a non-influenza group (green cluster) including 39 normal control subjects and one misclassified influenza patient.

In addition, the abnormal white blood cell (WBC) count (>12,000/mm 3 , <4000/mm 3 , or >10% bands) are also included in the SIRS diagnostic criteria. However, testing for WBC count requires a blood sample, and this would not be compatible with a fast-screening process. Therefore, we did not adopt WBC count as a screening parameter in this study. Furthermore, it is important to know the extent to which the screening parameters affect the results while performing a multiple-parameter-based screening for infection. Therefore, the classified parameters were compared statistically (Fig. 5) ; the most informative parameter was heart rate, while facial temperature and respiration rate were the second most informative parameters.",

The system can be used as a first step for screening infectious patients at an emergency outpatient unit or at an airport quarantine station. The proposed system also appears to offer a promising means of identifying and selecting higher-risk groups for further assessment. These features enable the system to be used for preventing secondary exposure of physicians during outbreaks of highly pathogenic infectious diseases such as the Ebola virus disease. However, the main limitation of our study was that it was conducted in a specialized hospital. The subjects were inpatients and were from a limited age group (18years) and were all of the same gender. The system should be further tested with a large and completely random sample of influenza patients. In summary, the neural network and FCM could efficiently detect higher-risk influenza patients within 10 s using multiple vital signs. Our system has the potential to serve as a helpful tool for rapid screening of infectious diseases in clinical settings at places of mass gathering.",
