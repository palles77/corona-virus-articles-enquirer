Gary Winslow (Denver) spoke on the topic of viral superantigens. Interestingly, the influenza virusspecific ~,8 expressing T-cells were described in the H-2 b mouse but were not found to be essential for recovery. However, Peter Doherty (Nashville) demonstrated that, in ccl3-mutant mice, delayed recovery from virus infection occurs. He concluded that TCR availability in V~8.1, D132, Y132.3 and C132 transgenic mice was not limiting; in contrast, the ability of peptides to interact with the MHC was critical. The response to one superantigen, the mouse mammary tumor virus Sag gene (MIs-1) in association with the deletion of V~6 or 8.1, and V[~7 or 9 was attributed to a 14 amino acid peptide from the C terminal LTR by Brigitte Huber (Boston). In addition to describing the production of the first mAb to an Mls antigen, she demonstrated the essential role of T cells in transmitting mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) infection.",

Michael Buchmeier (La Jolla) discussed the pathogenesis of a neurovirulent mutant of mouse hepatitis virus, a coronavirus; the neurovirulence was associated with the spike protein characteristics and viral clearance is due both to CD4 and CD8 expressing T cells. Frank Chisari (La Jolla) described the mechanism by which persistent HBV causes acute disease and leads to chronicity. Chronic immunopathological phase was mediated by CD8* T cells and at least three strategies of pathology were evident and subject to modulation. Barry Rouse (Knoxville) discussed the pathology of the corneal stroma caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV); T.I CD4 \u00f7 cells caused the lesion through toxic nitric oxide radicals (Science 'molecule of the year' for 1993). An immunopathological role for CD4* cells was also shown for mice immunized with formalin inactivated respiratory syncytial virus and later challenged with infectious virus (Brian Murphy, Bethesda). For effective immunity against rous sarcoma virus (RSV), CD8 + cells are essential. In another system, murine cytomegalovirus {CMV) infection, CD8 + cells specific for an I-E gene product were also shown by Uli Koszinowski (Ulm) to be responsible for clearance of CMV from all tissues except the salivary gland; in the absence of CD8\" cells, CD4\" cells effectively compensated [as has been seen in LCMV (Frelinger), VSV (Reiss) and influenza (Doherty)]. In the salivary gland, few cells express MHC thus to be the result of an indirect effect on neurons of toxic factors released by ltlV-infected cells or other amplifying cells (Richard Price, Minneapolis). Jay Nelson (Poixland) discussed an important coinfection often seen in AIDS and CMV and he presented evidence that viral gene expression is upregulated in infected peripheral blood cells. The infection of the male genitalurinary tract mucosa was the focus of Deborah Anderson's (Boston) presentation; she described the immunology of the urethra, and emphasized that vaccines for STDs should target local immunity in the mucosa of the male and female genito-urinary systems. She observed that CTLs may not be beneficial at this site, but that secretory immunity could be protective ~3.",

Sandy Morse (Bethesda) described his studies of MAIDS including the genetics of susceptibility, and the role of T,2 cells in resistance from the lymphoproliferative disease. Jay Levy (San Francisco) emphasized the protective role of CD8 * cells against systemic HIV infection and discussed the role of a factor produced by CD8 * cells which suppresses HSV replication in CD4 \u00f7 cells.
