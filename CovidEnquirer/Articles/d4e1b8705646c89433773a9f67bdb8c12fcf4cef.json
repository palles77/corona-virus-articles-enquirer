We used gene correlation analysis to perform an unbiased screen for host factors involved in influenza A virus (FLUAV) infection. Our screen identified the cellular factor epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 8 (EPS8) as the highest confidence pro-viral candidate. Knockout and overexpression of EPS8 confirmed its importance in enhancing FLUAV infection and titers. Loss of EPS8 did not affect virion attachment, uptake, or fusion. Rather, our data show that EPS8 specifically functions during virion uncoating. EPS8 physically associated with incoming virion components, and subsequent nuclear import of released ribonucleoprotein complexes was significantly delayed in the absence of EPS8. Our study identified EPS8 as a host factor important for uncoating, a crucial step of FLUAV infection during which the interface between the virus and host is still being discovered.",

            "text": "Orthomyxoviridae: Alphainfluenzavirus), like all viruses, largely depends upon existing cellular machinery to successfully complete these initial stages of infection. During the first step of infection, attachment, FLUAV hemagglutinin (HA) binds to the target cell via sialic acid linkages on host glycoproteins (Dou et al., 2018) . Virions are internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis and less frequently through an alternative macropinocytosis pathway (Matlin et al., 1981; de Vries et al., 2011) . Once within endosomes, virions are trafficked towards the nucleus using the cytoskeletal components actin, dynein, and microtubules (Lakadamyali et al., 2003) . The endosome matures and acidifies during cellular trafficking, and the virion interior is also acidified through the function of the viral ion channel M2 (Pinto et al., 1992) . The low pH in the endosome causes conformational changes in HA that drive fusion of the viral and endosomal lipid membranes, while low pH within the virion causes the viral matrix protein M1 to dissociate from the inner membrane of the viral envelope (Bukrinskaya et al., 1982; Maeda and Ohnishi, 1980; Martin and Helenius, 1991; Zhirnov, 1990) . Fusion of the two membranes releases a capsid-like viral core consisting of viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) enclosed in an M1 shelllike structure into the cytoplasm. This complex engages the cellular aggresome to complete uncoating, and the released vRNPs are imported into the nucleus by cellular karyopherins (Banerjee et al., 2014; Melen et al., 2003; O'Neill et al., 1995; Wang et al., 1997) . Once in the nucleus, a pioneering round of transcription occurs on the incoming vRNPs that initiates replication and secondary rounds of transcription of the viral genome.",

Gene disruption screens identified host factors involved in sialic acid metabolism utilized for attachment (Carette et al., 2009; Han et al., 2017) . Vacuolar ATPases involved in endosomal acidification and other host factors facilitating fusion and uncoating were identified through siRNA knockdown, proteomic, and overexpression screens (Banerjee et al., 2014; K\u00f6nig et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2017; Mar et al., 2018; Y\u00e1ng\u00fcez et al., 2018) . These studies also revealed previously unknown steps of FLUAV particle entry such as the role of the aggresome in viral uncoating (Banerjee et al., 2014) . Frequent identification of cellular factors involved in viral entry highlights the critical role of this process during viral replication. Despite these discoveries, however, the mechanistic details of steps occurring after fusion remain poorly understood.",

We detected a broad range of susceptibility when infecting cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.2. Relative to MDCK cells, 10 cell lines were highly refractory to WSN-GFP (at least a 10-fold decrease in infection rate) and 12 cell lines were highly permissive (at least a 3-fold increase in infection rate). There was no obvious association between susceptibility, cell type, tumor type, or tissue of origin. MCF7 breast tumor cells were the most refractory with a normalized infection rate of only about 3%, whereas T-47D cells, another breast tumor cell line, were the most susceptible with an infection rate of approximately 1300%. These data were highly reproducible with a strong correlation between results from two independent replicate screens ( Figure S1A ). To ensure that the assay captured the full dynamic range of susceptibility, especially for the highly resistant cell lines, the screen was repeated at an MOI of 2 ( Figure S1B ). Similar infectivity trends were detected at both MOIs, although the upper limit of the assay was reached for multiple cell lines at the higher MOI where effectively all cells were infected ( Figure  1C and S1C). The number of infected cells increased at the higher MOI for most of the resistant cell lines, indicating that these cell lines are not completely refractory to FLUAV infection ( Figure S1D ).",

To validate the results of the screen and confirm a pro-viral function for EPS8, we assessed the effect of EPS8 on viral gene expression and replication. EPS8 was transiently overexpressed in human embryonic kidney 293T cells and infected with a replication-competent reporter version of WSN (WSN PASTN) to quantitatively measure viral gene expression (Tran et al., 2013) . EPS8 overexpression increased viral gene expression during infection nearly two-fold relative to the empty vector control ( Figure  2A ). Endogenous and overexpressed EPS8 levels were confirmed by immunoblot. We then assayed viral titers when EPS8 was stably overexpressed in human lung epithelial A549 cells. Viral titers 24 hours postinfection (hpi) were increased by over 15 fold in stable EPS8-overexpressing cells relative to wild type (WT) cells ( Figure 2B ). Thus, overexpression of EPS8 enhances infection and replication in two different human cell lines, confirming the pro-viral correlation identified in the screen. We next used CRISPR-Cas9 to generate clonal EPS8 knockout A549 cells. Sanger sequencing confirmed genotypic changes predicted to result in knockout of EPS8 in two independent clonal lines (EPS8.1, EPS8.2) ( Figure S2A and S2B). Immunoblotting for endogenous EPS8 revealed a dramatic reduction in EPS8 protein levels but not a complete loss in our edited clones ( Figure S2C ).",

Interestingly, EPS8 editing did not affect B/Brisbane PASTN gene expression ( Figure 2F ). We explored infection specificity further by assessing the relative infection rates of A549 cells overexpressing EPS8 in response to challenge by diverse viruses ( Figure S4 ). EPS8 expression levels did not alter infection rates of Marburg virus (MARV) or Jun\u00edn virus (JUNV). In contrast, EPS8 overexpression caused decreased Ebola virus (EBOV), Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) infection rates. Hence, altering EPS8 expression does not generically affect viral replication. Together, these data confirm that EPS8 acts as a pro-viral host factor during FLUAV infection and exhibits specific effects on cell infectivity depending on the virus.",

We therefore conducted a series of experiments to determine where in the viral replication cycle EPS8 functioned to enhance infection ( Figure  3A ). We first assessed whether EPS8 affects infection through a mechanism that directly impacts viral polymerase activity. Polymerase activity was reconstituted in the absence of infection by expressing the heterotrimeric viral polymerase subunits PA, PB1, and PB2, nucleoprotein (NP), and a vRNA-like reporter encoding firefly luciferase. Polymerase activity was not statistically different in the presence or absence of exogenous EPS8 ( Figure 3B ). Immunoblotting confirmed high levels of exogenously expressed EPS8. This finding establishes that EPS8mediated enhancement of viral gene expression is not due to direct impacts on the viral polymerase but rather an upstream step in the early stages of infection.",

There was no statistical difference in the amount of virus bound to wild type and both EPS8-edited cell lines, indicating EPS8 is not necessary for FLUAV attachment to cells ( Figure 3C ). To ascertain if EPS8 affects HA-mediated entry or the fusion process, we infected cells with FLUAV encoding a different entry protein, FVG-R, a recombinant virus expressing vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus glycoprotein (VSIV-G) instead of HA (Hao et al., 2008) . Viral gene expression decreased in EPS8-edited cells infected with FVG-R compared to wild type cells ( Figure 3D ).

            "text": "Our line of experimentation indicated EPS8 functions at a step following release of the viral core into the cytoplasm but before viral gene expression. Therefore, we considered whether EPS8 facilitates viral uncoating. This process can be quantified by visualizing the redistribution of punctate matrix protein (M1) staining of intact particles to diffuse staining of M1 released throughout the cytosol ( Figure 4A and S5A) (Banerjee et al., 2013) . Wild type and EPS8edited cells were synchronously infected, and M1 localization was quantified at various times postinoculation. As expected, most M1 staining was punctate in wild type cells early in infection and then became diffuse at 1.5 hpi ( Figure 4B ). By contrast, uncoating was greatly delayed in both cell lines where EPS8 was edited. Diffuse M1 staining was detected in only 10-15% of EPS8-edited cells at 1.5 hpi compared to successful uncoating in almost all wild type cells at the same time point. Following release from the endosome, viral cores are trafficked to the aggresome to complete uncoating (Banerjee et al., 2014) . Coprecipitations were used to probe how EPS8 might function during this period. Synchronized infections were initiated on EPS8-edited cells stably complemented with wild type EPS8. NP specifically co-precipitated with EPS8, suggesting EPS8 physically interacts with incoming viral cores ( Figure  4C ). These data implicate EPS8 as an important host factor during viral uncoating. Uncoating releases vRNPs into the cytosol where they are subsequently imported into the nucleus prior to viral gene expression. The defects in uncoating we detected in EPS8-edited cells predict that these cells should also exhibit delayed nuclear import. To test this possibility, we again used synchronized infections and immunofluorescence to examine the subcellular localization and kinetics of vRNP nuclear import over time. Staining for NP, the major protein component of vRNPs, revealed characteristic cytoplasmic localization of incoming vRNPs early during infection followed by distinct nuclear localization ( Figure 4D ). Discrete cytoplasmic and nuclear localizations of vRNPs were also detected in EPS8-edited cells ( Figure S5B ). Nuclear-localized vRNPs were detected in wild type cells as early as 1.5 hpi and the number of cells with nuclear vRNP staining increased over time, consistent with the timing of viral uncoating reported above ( Figure 4E ). Cells lacking wild type levels of EPS8, however, exhibited significantly delayed kinetics of nuclear import. Compared to wild type cells, import rates in EPS8edited cells were delayed by 1 hour. This trend continued until 3.5 hpi when import in edited cells finally matched that of wild type cells ( Figure 4D ). While import was delayed in edited cells, it followed a similar trajectory to wild type cells once initiated, suggesting that vRNP import was not directly altered by changes to EPS8 expression. Thus, defects in uncoating ( Figure 4B ) result in delayed nuclear import ( Figure 4E ) and ultimately a reduction in viral gene expression ( Figure 2D ), reinforcing the conclusion that EPS8 is a key component of the cellular machinery utilized for viral uncoating.",

Our data, however, indicate that loss of wildtype EPS8 does not alter attachment and that bypassing internalization by forcing fusion at the plasma membrane does not rescue defects in these cells (Figure 3 ), suggesting EPS8 activity is independent of EGFR signaling. EPS8 is also involved in modulating actin dynamics (Hertzog et al., 2010) . Actin has been implicated in the rapid movement of virion-containing endosomes immediately after virion internalization and also plays a role in the discrete steps post-fusion but before uncoating is completed (Banerjee et al., 2014; Lakadamyali et al., 2003) . A role for actin during post-fusion uncoating is the same step where our data revealed EPS8 functions, raising the possibility that it is the ability of EPS8 to engage and modulate actin dynamics that is important for uncoating.",

            "text": "Although cells lacking EPS8 have decreased FLUAV gene expression, that was not the case during FLUBV infection. FLUAV and FLUBV are structurally similar, and it is tempting to generalize that the replication cycle is largely the same for the two viruses. Like FLUAV, FLUBV utilizes receptormediated endocytosis for entry (Shaw and Palese, 2013) . Acidification of the FLUBV virion interior is facilitated by viral membrane protein and proton pump BM2, a FLUAV M2 homolog (Mould et al., 2003) . FLUBV undergoes uncoating after fusion of viral and endosomal membranes, but many of the details of FLUBV uptake and uncoating are still unknown. Interestingly, cellular immune responses to FLUBV infection differ from those to FLUAV infection (Jiang et al., 2016; M\u00e4kel\u00e4 et al., 2015) . Therefore, it is possible that host processes involved in other steps of FLUBV infection also differ, as suggested by the discordant importance of EPS8 for FLUAV and FLUBV.",

A panel of RNA viruses using diverse cellular receptors and entry mechanisms was used to infect A549 cells overexpressing EPS8 ( Figure S4 ). There were no obvious trends or associations with viral families or entry pathways. Nonetheless, these results indicate that EPS8 enhancement of infection is specific to certain viruses, and the multifunctional nature of EPS8 may impart an anti-viral function for other viruses. In summary, our gene correlation analysis identified both pro-and antiviral host factors with a functional impact on early stages of FLUAV replication without requiring artificial manipulation of the cellular environment. Through interrogation of early steps of FLUAV infection, we established EPS8 as an novel cofactor facilitating FLUAV uncoating. Infectious Disease Award from the Burroughs Wellcome Fund.
