At that time, he presented with fever, rhinorrhea, sore throat, and cough that began 5 days before admission. The boy was previously healthy, and he reported no history of any recent exposure to other medications, toxic substances, or previous vaccinations. Furthermore, the medical history of his family was unremarkable. The physical examination of the boy revealed mild tachycardia and pharyngeal hyperemia. A subsequent neurologic examination indicated the presence of confusion, lethargy, quadriplegia, and a bilateral extensor plantar response. Although a laboratory evaluation revealed a low leukocyte count (1910/mm 3 ), his serum C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal. Cranial computed tomography was performed, and the findings were unremarkable. Likewise, an examination of the patient's cerebrospinal fluid produced normal results, except for mild lymphocytic pleocytosis (100 cells/mm 3 , all mononuclear, with normal protein and glucose), and the findings of an electroencephalogram were also unremarkable. Acyclovir and ceftriaxone were administered to the boy empirically. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy were then performed with a 1. cerebellar dentate nucleus and periaqueductal white matter bilaterally. After an intravenous injection of gadolinium, minimal enhancement was detected. In diffusion weighted images, no loss of diffusion was evident. However, magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed no lactate peak corresponding to these lesions (Fig 1) . Serum and cerebrospinal fluid lactate levels were normal, and his oligoclonal bands also tested negative.",

Serum markers for viruses (i.e., herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, Varicella zoster, mumps, rubella, measles, and Epstein-Barr virus) as well as Mycoplasma pneumonia produced negative results. However, influenza A (swine origin H1N1 serotype) was detected in a nasopharyngeal swab specimen by enzyme immunoassay on day 6, and oseltamivir was administered to the boy. Because of the persistence of neurologic signs, intravenous immunoglobulin (1 g/kg/day) was initiated on day 23 after admission, and was administered for 2 days. During a follow-up examination at the end of treatment, magnetic resonance imaging was performed, and revealed a significant regression of the lesions (Fig 2) . The boy was subsequently discharged with anarthria and quadriparesis on day 34 after admission. A follow-up appointment revealed that the boy continued to manifest anarthria and quadriparesis 2 years after the initial attack.",

Acute necrotizing encephalopathy after a febrile illness is characterized by a rapid deterioration of consciousness, an elevation of serum aminotransferases, and multifocal, symmetric lesions evident on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging in the thalamus, cerebral and cerebellar medullae, and brainstem. The presence of hemorrhage and localized tissue loss on magnetic resonance images in the thalami and brainstem suggest acute encephalopathy [10] . Our patient's liver enzymes were normal, and no hemorrhage or atrophy was detected on magnetic resonance imaging. Mitochondrial disorders are also included in the differential diagnosis of disorders associated with acute central and peripheral demyelination. The typical neuroradiologic findings of mitochondrial disease include abnormal magnetic resonance imaging results in the T 2 -weighted signal of the cerebral white matter, cerebellar atrophy, and abnormalities of deep gray matter nuclei. Elevated lactate levels on proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy were also proposed as useful diagnostic criteria for indicating mitochondrial disease [11, 12] . Although clinical evidence is still lacking, a mitochondrial disorder should be considered when bilateral symmetric lesions of the basal ganglia are present [11, 12] . For the patient in this study, mitochondrial disorders were excluded because his serum and cerebrospinal fluid lactate levels were normal, and H-proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed no lactate peak.",

The manifestations observed in our patient suggest that outcomes in acute disseminated encephalomyelitis associated with the influenza A (H1N1) virus may not always be benign, despite an apparent resolution of magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities. The early recognition of H1N1 is important because rapid treatment for the H1N1 virus could exert some positive effects that did not occur in this case. We hope to draw the attention of clinicians to the benefits of antiviral treatment, initiated as soon as possible after the onset of illness.",
