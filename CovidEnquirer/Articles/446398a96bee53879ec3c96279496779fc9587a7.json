However, a number of additional cell-surface moieties can also bind viral envelope glycoproteins and could act as capture receptors, serving as attachment factors to concentrate virus particles on the cell surface, or to disseminate the virus infection to target organs or susceptible cells within the host. Here, we used Jun\u00edn virus (JUNV) or JUNV glycoprotein complex (GPC)-pseudotyped particles to study their ability to be internalized by the human C-type lectins hDC-or hL-SIGN. Our results provide evidence that hDC-and hL-SIGN can mediate the entry of Jun\u00edn virus into cells, and may play an important role in virus infection and dissemination in the host.",

Seven of the known arenaviruses can cause viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) in humans, with five of them, namely Jun\u00edn, Guanarito, Machupo, Chapare, and Sabi\u00e1, belonging to the phylogenetic clade B of New World arenaviruses [1] . Rodents are the known reservoir of most arenaviruses and infection generally occurs after exposure to infected rodent excreta. Jun\u00edn virus is the etiologic agent of Argentine Hemorrhagic Fever (AHF), an endemo-epidemic disease affecting populations living on the farming land of Argentina [2] . Despite the fact that a live attenuated vaccine, Candid#1, is available against Jun\u00edn, the endemic region is expanding. In addition, the supply of convalescent serum for treatment of infected people is decreasing. Therefore, the arenavirus family remains a serious threat to public health and still a growing concern that these viruses could be used as agents of bioterrorism.",

New World arenaviruses utilize the transferrin receptor (TfR1) from their natural host [7] and it has been shown that all pathogenic members of the New World group use human TfR1 (hTFR1) as a receptor to infect human cells [8, 9] . However, experiments using siRNA knockdown of TfR1 in mouse cells resulted in no reduction in titer relative to the controls suggesting that murine TfR1 plays no role in entry into these cells [10, 11] and suggesting multiple receptors exist.",

Our data show that Jun\u00edn virus can use either hDC-or hL-SIGN expressed on the cell surface, resulting in productive infection of mouse 3T3 cells that express these lectins. There was an increase in virus yield of over 3 log units in lectin-expressing cells (Fig. 3) compared to an approximately 16-fold increase in primary infection (Fig. 2) , suggesting that expression of hDC-SIGN and hL-SIGN also increased production of infectious virus particles. This is significant as over-expression of binding factors can lead to blockage of virus release in some virus systems, and leads to the conclusion that hDC-SIGN and hL-SIGN are functionally important in vivo.",

Results from the present study indicate that JUNV GPC is glycosylated in such a way as to allow its interaction with hDC-and hL-SIGN. Our study showing an enhancement of the infection in hDC-or hL-SIGN positive cells demonstrates the importance of researching JUNV GPC to determine if changes in this binding have an impact on virus infectivity, tropism and pathogenicity. with pcDNA3-hDC-SIGN, pcDNA3hhL-SIGN or plasmids encoding human, feline, canine or murine TfR1 (hTfR, fTfR, cTfR or mTfR), or with C1 plasmid, carrying only GFP, as a control. 24 h post-transfection cell cultures were transduced with the retroviral pseudotypes carrying JUNV GPC. After 48 h at 37\u00b0C cells were lysed and luciferase activity was measured as RLU. Error bars represent standard deviation of the mean.
