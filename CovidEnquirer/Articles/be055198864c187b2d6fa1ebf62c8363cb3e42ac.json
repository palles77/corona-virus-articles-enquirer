The Fd and light chain antibody genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, cloned into the phagemid vector pMad, expressed in bacteria to produce Fab fragments and sequenced. The mAb 4E11, in particular its light chain complementary-determining regions, shared homologies with two other anti-viral mAbs. The affinity of the parental mAb and the cloned Fab to the MalE-E(296-400) fusion protein were shown to be of the same magnitude, i.e. nanomolar. Fab 4E11 neutralization capacity was found between 8 and 4-times or less lower than that of mAb 4E11, depending on serotypes, thus the Fab could have a smaller antiviral activity than the mAb in vitro.",

Without medical intervention, the case fatality rate of the hemorrhagic and shock syndrome can reach 40-50% (Igarashi, 1997) . The mechanisms of this syndrome are still under discussion: (i) specific strains could be involved (Murgue et al., 1997) ; and (ii) preexisting subneutralizing antibodies could enhance the antibody-mediated uptake of the virus by monocytes or macrophages which are designated as host cells of the virus (antibody dependent enhancement: ADE) (Hawkes and Lafferty, 1967 ; see review in Porterfield, 1986) . The requirement for the Fc region of IgG in ADE has been demonstrated by Halstead and O'Rourke (1977) who compared whole human serum, that had enhancing activity and Fab% 2 of the same origin that had not. The requirement for fonctional Fcg receptors in ADE has also been shown (Littaua et al., 1996) . These receptors, present at the surface of macrophages, play a major role in the phagocytosis of antibody-coated particles (Paul, 1993) and are dependent on the Fc binding of IgG.",

Intravenous infusion to correct hypovolemia and eventually blood transfusion, can reduce the mortality rate. Monoclonal antibodies passively transferred to mice challenged with a lethal intracerebral dose of dengue 2 virus have been shown to be protective (Kaufman et al., 1987) . In the case of another virus (vesicular stomatitis virus) protection against lethal infection has been shown to be mediated by neutralizing antibodies (Zinkernagel, 1997) . Immunotherapy of dengue, as prophylaxis or treatment, could thus be of interest. IgG fragments lacking Fc (scFv or Fab) should be used so that they do not participate in any enhancing effects (ADE). For this work, Fab were prefered to scFv because they have a better stability, resulting in a longer half-life. A Fab has recently been shown to have a 55-fold greater half-life than its corresponding scFv (Lamarre et al., 1997) .",

The PCR primers harboured a restriction site that enabled the doublestranded PCR products to be cloned into the vector. The 5% primers were designed to hybridize to partially conserved sequences coding for the N-terminus of variable regions. Four 5% primers for light chain and eight 5% primers for Fd had to be tested, depending on the family to which belonged the template. The 3% primers hybridize in the region corresponding to the light chain C-terminus and to the hinge region of Fd . PCR conditions were described elsewhere (Lafaye et al., 1995) . After digestion by SacI and XbaI (Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD), the light chain gene was cloned into the phagemidic expression vector pMad (kindly given to us by G. Orfanoudakis, E.S.B.S., Strasbourg). After digestion with XhoI and SpeI (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany), the Fd gene was cloned in frame with the gene for minor coat protein III (PIII) of filamentous phages, in the vector having already received the light chain gene (for a schematic drawing of the construct, see Barbas et al., 1991) .",

            "text": "Despite experimental variations observed between the tested serotypes, some reduction of Fab neutralizing capacity when compared with the parental mAb was observed. It has already been reported that neutralization by a Fab is usually reduced by at least one order of magnitude compared with its parental IgG (Schofield et al., 1997) , but the observed reduction was not in agreement with the conserved affinity. Technical reasons for this appearent loss of activity, such as alterations during freeze-thaw, or defects in the association of the light chain and Fd could not be ruled out despite the taken precautions. These reasons would not have hampered the affinity measurements, which were not dependent on the quantity of active Fab present in the tested solution, but only on the linearity of the signal with respect to the dilution. Reasons based on the mechanism of neutralization could also be proposed. Because Fab 4E11 bound to the envelope protein of the virus, it should block the attachment of the virus to the host cell, by binding close to the attachment site (see review in Dimmock, 1993) . This blocking could be less complete by the Fab than by the Mab, due to reduction in Fab steric hindrance. Because no effector for Fc is present in the in vitro neutralization essay, the fact that the lack of Fc seems to cause a reduction of neutralization properties can be mostly explained by this reduction of Fab steric hindrance.",
