We aim to study the incidence, etiology, risk factors, length of hospital stay, and mortality rate of pneumonia amongst pilgrims admitted to Al-Ansar general hospital, Madinah, Saudi Arabia during the Hajj period of December 2004-November 2013. A retrospective analysis of all patients diagnosed and admitted as pneumonia was done. Patients were assessed according to the CURB-65 scoring system and admitted to the ward or intensive care unit accordingly. Throat and nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, and blood culture were collected prior to antibiotic treatment. 1059 patients were included in the study (23% of total hospital admissions and 20% of ICU admissions). The mean age of participants was 56.8 years, the Male:Female ratio was 3:1, and the lengths of stay in the ward and intensive care units were 5 and 14.5 days, respectively. The main organisms cultured from sputum were Klebsiella Pneumoniae, Streptococcus Pneumoniae, Haemophilus Influenzae, Staphylococcus Aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and community-acquired MRSA. The mortality rate in the ward was 2.4%, while the rate in the ICU was 21.45%. The organisms which caused pneumonia were found to be different during Hajj. The usual standard guideline for the treatment of pneumonia was ineffective for the causative organisms. Therefore, specific adjustments *",

This pilgrimage consists of a stay of approximately 6 days in Jeddah city, which is the entry point to Saudi Arabia in preparation for the arranged events.

In our study, 23% of total admissions to the ward and 20% of all ICU admissions were due to pneumonia. In our study, the maleto-female ratio was 3:1, which is in agreement with many studies that showed that a pneumococcal infection is more frequent in males. It may also be explained by the fact that annually more male pilgrims perform Hajj than female pilgrims. In addition, the mean age was 56.8 years (range 48\u221264). This may be because the regulations of the Hajj in most Islamic countries prioritize Hajj performance among individuals older than 40 years. Elderly pilgrims are more susceptible to infections due to overexertion, limited sleep and rest; disturbance of dietary schedule and types of food; and the inability to maintain serious medical complications due to decreased immune function. (Fig. 5)   Fig. 4 Annual ICU pneumonia admissions and mortality. Due to the large numbers of cases seen annually at the holy shrines health care centers, the incidence and prevalence of pneumonia during the Hajj season was the subject of many health studies. Mandourah et al. [22] investigated all critically ill pneumonia patients admitted to 15 hospitals in Makkah and Madinah in the 2009\u22122010 Hajj seasons. Pneumonia was the cause of critical illnesses in 27.2% of cases, and it accounted for 18.1% of all ICU admissions. Our finding of 23% of cases being admitted is similar and does not reflect a decrease in the incidence. However, our findings that ICU admissions accounted for 31% of cases, is much larger than the figure reported by Mandourah which could reflect an increase in the severity of the disease.",
