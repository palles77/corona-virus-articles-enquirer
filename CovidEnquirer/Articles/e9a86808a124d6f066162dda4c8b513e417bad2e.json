            "text": "Background: Emerging infectious diseases pose a significant risk to public health. Methods for rapid detection of pathogens are needed to effectively treat these diseases. Recently, we developed new methods for the rapid determination of viral RNA sequences, RDV ver1.0 and ver2.0. We demonstrated that these methods were able to simultaneously detect cDNA fragments of many different viruses without using sequence specific primers. However, some species of viruses, including the Yokose virus (YOKV), a flavivirus, could not be detected using the conventional procedures. Objective: The RDV method was further modified to reduce the candidate PCR primer sets. Study design: Primer sets were reduced to 256 sets in the improved RDV ver3.0, and theoretically, all viral cDNA fragments ligated by two kinds of adaptors after digestion by two restriction enzymes could be amplified in the PCR step for direct sequencing. Results: We succeeded in obtaining 118 YOKV cDNA fragments of the 141 sequence fragments. The cDNA fragments covered diverse range of viral genome. Conclusion: We were able to reduce the combinations of PCR primer sets used in the RDV method. This RDV method ver3.0 has a potential to detect viral cDNA fragments of both known and unknown RNA viruses rapidly and conveniently.",

In the RDV method, viral genome sequences are obtained without sub-cloning into plasmid vectors. Nucleic acid sequences of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, murine hepatitis virus, West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and Dengue virus were successfully detected in culture supernatants from virus-infected cells by RDV ver1.0, which is our original method for detecting RNA viral genomes Kihara et al., 2007) . To increase sensitivity over RDV ver1.0, the sequence-independent amplification step was improved. By using the improved method, RDV ver2.0, avian paramyxovirus was detected in the allantoic fluid of embryonated chicken eggs . A new adenovirus was successfully detected in the culture supernatant of primary kidney cells originating from a fruit bat using this RDV method (RDV-D) (Maeda et al., 2008) . RDV methods have the potential to become standard methods for the detection of both known as well as newly emerging unknown viruses in humans and animals.",

Therefore, very large numbers of combinations of primer sets (4 4 \u00d7 4 4 = 65,536 sets) are theoretically necessary to detect all the viral genomes in a sequence-independent manner . To avoid this level of complexity, we conventionally used the primer sets fixed the 5 end of two nucleotides in the four variable nucleotide region to AG for the forward primer or GG for the reverse primer. However, we found that some viral species are difficult to detect using the limited combinations of primer sets. For example, the Yokose virus (YOKV) was isolated from a bat in Japan in 1971, and it was found to be an Entebbe bat virus, genus Flavivirus, in the family Flaviviridae. Although the full genome sequence has been published recently (AB114858), little is yet known about the characteristics of the virus (Tajima et al., 2005) . We attempted to detect the YOKV sequence in the culture supernatant from virus-infected Vero cells using the procedure of RDV ver1.0 and ver2.0, but this failed. Therefore, in this study, we further improved the RDV method to detect more virus species, in particular by modifying the adaptor ligation step, to reduce the candidates of PCR primer sets for direct sequencing. This RDV ver3.0 was able to detect over 100 cDNA fragments of YOKV.",
