Methods: Two cohorts of HCWs, the first serving Hajj pilgrims in Mecca and the second serving patients in Al-Ahsa, were investigated for respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms and pathogen carriage using multiplex polymerase chain reaction before and after the 2015 Hajj. Results: A total of 211 HCWs were enrolled of whom 92 were exposed to pilgrims (Mecca cohort), whereas 119 were not exposed (Al-Ahsa cohort). Symptoms were observed only in HCWs from the Mecca cohort, with 29.3% experiencing respiratory symptoms during the Hajj period or in the subsequent days and 3.3% having gastrointestinal symptoms. Acquisition rates of at least 1 respiratory virus were 14.7% in the Mecca cohort and 3.4% in the Al-Ahsa cohort (P = .003). Acquisition rates of at least 1 respiratory bacterium were 11.8% and 18.6% in the Mecca and Al-Ahsa cohorts, respectively (P = .09). Gastrointestinal pathogens were rarely isolated in both cohorts of HCWs and acquisition of pathogens after the Hajj was documented in only a few individuals. Conclusions: HCWs providing care for pilgrims both acquire pathogens and present symptoms (especially respiratory symptoms) more frequently than those not working during Hajj.",

For instance, a diarrhea attack rate of 23% was observed in a cohort of French pilgrims. 5 Each Hajj season, thousands of health care workers (HCWs) are drafted from across the Kingdom to oversee and provide health care during Hajj. This workforce may be at increased risk of acquiring infection during the event. Although many studies regarding communicable disease during Hajj have been conducted in pilgrims, not much has been conducted among HCWs. One study investigated respiratory viruses among HCWs treating pilgrims during the 2009 Hajj and detected rhinovirus and coronavirus 229E in 12.6% and 0.6% of the participants, respectively. 6 Rhinovirus was detected in 21% of those who had respiratory symptoms during Hajj.",

In a study conducted among 250 personnel (25.6% of whom were physicians or nurses) serving at 2 Hajj mission hospitals during the 2004 season, a 22.6% attack rate of acute respiratory infections during and after the Hajj was observed with acute respiratory infections defined by the association of at least 1 constitutional symptom (fever, headaches, and myalgia) and at least 1 respiratory symptom. 12 In a study conducted among 120 HCWs from the Saudi Ministry of Health (MOH) and other Hajj medical missions during the 2009 season, 10.6% reported respiratory symptoms during the Hajj, and 12.5% were found infected by at least 1 virus post-Hajj comparing to 7.5% pre-Hajj using a PCR assay. 6 All positive cases were due to rhinovirus, but 1 post-Hajj case was due to coronavirus 229E. 6 We confirm in the current work that HCWs attending ill Hajj pilgrims present frequently with respiratory symptoms (29%) during and soon after the Hajj period. Additionally, we show that diarrhea is rare (3%). Such symptoms were not observed in another cohort of HCWs attending non-pilgrim patients in another region of Saudi Arabia during the same period of time. HCWs attending pilgrims reported symptoms that lasted up to 2 weeks. No symptomatic HCWs reported loss of workdays during the Hajj in our study, and the number of sick days because of illness post-Hajj was not recorded. Nevertheless, illness during or post-Hajj among HCWs does not only affect the wellbeing of the HCWs involved, but may also have an impact on work productivity, delivery of health care services, as well as potentially an economic cost. This is especially relevant during Hajj when the health care system is under a significant amount of stress and operating at near surge capacity in many Hajj areas. Numerous studies reported that employee absence is related to decreased job productivity and important economic costs including in the health care sector. [13] [14] [15] Further studies are needed for a better understanding of the impact of Hajj-related illness among HCWs.",

This is in accordance with previous reports showing lack of MERS coronavirus carriage and infection among Hajj pilgrims. [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] Acquisition and carriage of potentially pathogenic organisms by HCWs do not only constitute a risk for development of disease by the HCWs carriers themselves, but also a risk of transmission and infection of the vulnerable patients they care for. The role of HCWs as a vector for nosocomial infections is well established, 27,28 especially in relation to RTIs. 27 Therefore, effective infection prevention and control (IPC) strategies in health care settings to reduce the likelihood of infection among HCWs and patients are crucial in the Hajj context. As such, the Saudi MOH has a strict IPC training and educational program for HCWs deployed for Hajj, beyond the standard training programs these HCWs undertake throughout the year in their own health care facilities across the Kingdom. This is because HCWs deployed during Hajj come from a wide range of health institutions in KSA with diverse backgrounds on IPC measures. Some may be stationed at seasonal hospitals in the Mecca holy sites that are only operational during Hajj and will be providing care to pilgrims originating from all over the world. Therefore, since 2016, the Saudi MOH requires all HCWs deployed during Hajj to complete training to acquire a basic infection control skills license (BICSL). The latter involves 5 basic components: proper hand hygiene, proper use of personal protective equipment, application of the N95 fit test, principles of safe injection practice, as well as compulsory influenza and meningococcal vaccination. For the 2017 Hajj, 14,029 HCWs were trained for the BICSL representing 100% of the targeted number to be trained. 29 The Kingdom also ensures that health care centers and hospitals providing services for pilgrims are equipped with the necessary facilities for infection prevention. During the 2017 Hajj, 403 isolation rooms, 168 negative pressure rooms, and 461 high efficiency particulate air filters were available at the Hajj health care facilities. 29 The Saudi MOH also has developed and published various IPC policies, including those specifically for Hajj, to help HCWs develop their knowledge and skills in the area and adhere to best practices. In addition, various trainings and drills are conducted pre-Hajj for HCWs as per their function and in relation to a number of possible infectious risks such as MERS. Awareness campaigns are also part of the IPC program for HCWs during Hajj, especially in relation to the importance of immunization, food and safety hygiene standards, and general IPC practices that go hand-in-hand with those awareness campaigns aimed at pilgrims, holy cities residents, and non-HCWs.",

Due to various initiatives by the Saudi MOH, rates of influenza vaccination among HCWs in KSA are high in recent years. 30, 31 Nevertheless, we found low influenza vaccination rates among HCWs not deployed to Hajj in 2015. One possible contributor to this finding is that the influenza vaccination season in KSA for HCWs not deployed to Hajj runs from September to March. Given that our data collection was conducted mid-September, it is possible that a number of HCWs from the Al-Ahsa cohort did not yet receive their influenza vaccination at the time of the study. For HCWs deployed in Hajj, the rates of immunization in our study were similar to those reported in a study conducted in the 2015-2017 Hajj seasons. 32 However, our data indicates that the rate of immunization of influenza vaccination among the Hajj cohort was higher than that reported pre-2015. 19, 20 In general, since the introduction of the compulsory BICSL license that includes the compulsory influenza and meningococcal immunization section, data from the MOH indicate that in 2017, all HCWs deployed to Hajj were vaccinated with both vaccines.",

Although we enrolled an adequate number of HCWs in both cohorts and had a good follow-up rate, the number represents a small fraction of the thousands of HCWs deployed for Hajj. Therefore, our results may not be generalizable to all HCWs working during Hajj and in all specialties. Also, data on the number of days off work due to sickness among HCWs post-Hajj was not collected, and that would have given a better picture of the burden of illness associated with Hajj deployment for HCWs and the health system at large. Finally, although we aimed to match the Al-Ahsa cohort with our Mecca cohort in terms of health care facilities size, type of patients, and other factors, given the specific nature of the Hajj, it was impossible to completely match the two cohorts.",

The Kingdom has also the capacity to deploy extra HCWs for Hajj in times of need. Nevertheless, strict adherence to IPC policies and guidelines among HCWs, especially in relation to preventing respiratory infections, and continuous monitoring, feedback, and improvement of IPC strategies for Hajj are needed.
