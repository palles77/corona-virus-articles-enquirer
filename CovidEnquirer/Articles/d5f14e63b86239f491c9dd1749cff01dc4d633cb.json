We aim to devise novel ways to model, visualise and analyse the temporal dynamics of epidemic outbreaks in order to help researchers and other people involved in crisis response to make well-informed and targeted decisions about from which geographical locations and time periods more genetic samples may be required to fully understand the outbreak. Our approach relies on the application of Transcendental Information Cascades to a set of temporally ordered nucleotide sequences, and we apply it to real-world data that was collected during the currently ongoing outbreak of the novel 2019-nCoV coronavirus. We assess information-theoretic and network-theoretic measures that characterise the resulting complex network and identify touching points and temporal pathways that are candidates for deeper investigation by geneticists and epidemiologists.",

A thorough understanding of the genetic characteristics of a virus is crucial to understand the way it is (or may be) transmitted (e.g. human-to-human transmissibility) in order to be able to anticipate the potential reach of an outbreak and develop effective countermeasures. The recent outbreak of a new type of coronavirus -2019-nCoV -provides plenty of examples of the way researchers seek to quickly approach the aforementioned problems of genetic decomposition of the virus [2, 8] and modelling of its transmission dynamics [15] .",

The approach falls into the category of contemporary approaches that make use of network theory for the study of dynamical complex systems [4, 19, 21] .

However, cluster 5 also features a slightly lower average similarity with comparably high standard deviation, which indicates that this cluster may be slightly less coherent. The barchart of the inter-cluster analysis results shown in Figure 5 reveals that there are some cluster pairs with high inter-cluster similarity, that the inter-cluster similarity is different between the +3 reading frame network and the other two reading frame networks, and that the pattern of the +3 reading frame network inter-cluster similarity is similar to the one for the entire TIC network. In particular we find that in the +1 and +2 reading frame networks the clusters 1, 4, 6 and 7 are quite similar at the nucleotide level compared to all other clusters that are pairwise distinct. For the entire TIC network and the +3 reading frame network instead we find that clusters 1, 3, 5 and 7 show this kind of similarity. Altogether, these results indicate that (a) in some instances the clustering based on structural characteristics of the TIC network overrides actual genomic similarity, and (b) the choice of the reading frames during TIC construction has an impact on the resulting network that needs to be further investigated.",
