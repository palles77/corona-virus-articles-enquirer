            "text": "In 1997, 18 human cases of severe infection associated with Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) caused significant international concern about the possibility of an influenza pandemic with its epicentre in Hong Kong. However the virus failed to transmit from person-to-person and the efficient and widespread culling of poultry by the Hong Kong authorities interrupted spread from birds to humans [1] . Shortly afterwards, in 1998-99 cases of Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI) A(H9N2) were described in humans, associated with influenza-like illness (ILI) [2] ; and a further human case occurred in 2003 [3] . In the same year, a large outbreak of HPAI A(H7N7) in poultry and swine in the Netherlands resulted in 89 human cases of conjunctivitis, and 13 cases of respiratory illness, including 1 death [4, 5] . Of far greater potential significance, HPAI A(H5N1) also re-emerged in humans in 2003. Its endemicity in poultry in many parts of the world, and the continuing occurrence of low numbers of severe, often lethal, infections in humans reinforce its ongoing pandemic threat [6] . In 2004 and 2006 cases of human infection with LPAI A(H7N3) were documented in British Columbia and England causing both ILI and conjunctivitis [7, 8] ; two further cases occurred in Mexico in 2012 [9] . In addition, in 2007, an LPAIV A(H7N2) outbreak in poultry produced at least four cases of human infection in England and Wales, manifesting as ILI, of which three were hospitalised [10] ; low-level person-to-person transmission was suspected but never proven [11] . These events all served to emphasise the potential pandemic threat from avian influenza, most notably subtypes H5, H7 and H9. However, the biggest impact of emerging influenza viruses of the last 15 years has been the A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic in 2009-10. This emerged from an unpredicted epicentre in Mexico rather than southeast Asia as widely predicted; and it was an unanticipated virus (not derived from HPAI A(H5N1) as widely predicted), albeit containing genetic material from both avian and swine influenza viruses [12] . The 2009-10 pandemic has substantially informed and modified thinking about intervention strategies for emerging respiratory virus infections. But its occurrence has neither increased nor diminished the ongoing threat from other avian influenza viruses.",

This new pathogen provided a rather different perspective from A(H5N1), with severe illness, efficient person-person transmission, and rapid international spread via the medium of air travel [16] . In early 2003 SARS spread from Hong Kong to Vietnam, Singapore and Canada in just three weeks, demonstrating its massive pandemic potential. In the first three months of circulation, over 8000 cases and 774 deaths occurred worldwide across 29 countries (http://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/ table2004_04_21/en/index.html). In retrospect, a SARS pandemic was averted because persons infected were maximally infectious several days after symptom onset; this allowed effective quarantine and infection control measures to be instituted in a way that would not be possible for influenza. Had this not been so, the outcome would have been a highly lethal pandemic with few options for definitive treatment or prevention by vaccination. In 2004, two novel human coronaviruses, NL63 and HKU1 were identified in humans, being associated with typical acute respiratory illness and pneumonia respectively [17, 18] . In late 2012, the detection of a novel betacoronavirus (HCoV-EMC) in a small number of humans with severe respiratory infection in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Jordan has reinforced the pandemic potential of coronaviruses [19, 20] ; it is at present unclear what the future of HCoV-EMC in humans will be.",

Whilst it is unrealistic to expect all countries of the world, irrespective of resources, to have fully comprehensive surveillance systems, it is equally unacceptable that there are very large gaps in coverage at the present time, especially in resource poor settings.

One large problem, obvious during the 2009 pandemic, was the dearth of surveillance systems geared towards secondary care. Whilst many countries could track syndromic respiratory illness in primary care settings quite effectively (and some coupled this to virological surveillance), at the start of the pandemic, few had systems capable of doing much more than counting the number of hospital admissions due to respiratory illness. Ad hoc systems were devised in haste, but detailed clinical and epidemiological information on severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) was initially hard to locate. In the aftermath of the 2009 pandemic it has been recognised that SARI surveillance systems are critically important but mainly underdeveloped; and that their usefulness will extend over a broad range of acute respiratory pathogens, known and unknown. For example, a sudden upsurge in HCoV-EMC might well be detected by monitoring an unexplained increase in the requirement for intensive care for acute respiratory cases.",

If applied successfully, the national epidemic curve changes to become broader (of longer duration) but flatter (of lower peak severity); and the timing of peak activity may also be delayed somewhat (Figure 1 ) [26 ] . It is well recognised that health services cannot cope with extreme surges in demand; thus to be less busy for longer is preferable than to be overwhelmed in a short time frame. Likewise, it is now well recognised, and subsequently proven by the experiences of 2009-10 that vaccine manufacture takes time; and delaying of peak disease activity may well encroach into the window of Yes vaccine availability, with positive public health consequences [26 ] .",

The emerging thinking after the 2009-10 pandemic has therefore tended to be about recognising the proportionality of public health measures in relation to the severity of the threat. Put simply, severe public health measures would be more justifiable and better understood by the public for an A(H5N1) or SARS-CoV scenario than for a mild A(H1N1)pdm09-like one.",

Nevertheless this contrasted sharply with the reality of disease incidence in countries of the southern hemisphere, which suffered first pandemic waves in summer 2009 along with substantial disease activity in Mexico, north America and the UK. Even among well-resourced countries in Europe, pandemic vaccines were introduced gradually throughout autumn 2009 as supplies became available coinciding with major autumn pandemic waves rather than the ideal of vaccination campaigns having been completed, before they began. In resource poor countries, which relied on donated supplies, pandemic vaccine distribution only occurred from early 2010 onwards [27 ] . Such dissonance in the timing of disease activity and the availability of supplies, coupled to generally mild disease meant that the public's perception and receptivity towards vaccine were ultimately rather mixed.",

These varied from no use at all (usually due to affordability issues), through restricted use in high-risk patients (the majority approach), to widespread availability for all patients with qualifying symptoms (UK). All the policies were based upon evidence from the study of seasonal influenza suggesting that NAIs reduce symptom duration and severity by a modest amount, but may also reduce complications, hospitalisations and mortality; as the outcome became more serious the evidence became weaker [29] . The UK also stands out in having pursued an extended policy of household post-exposure prophylaxis with antiviral drugs to reduce the incidence of secondary cases. The evidence suggests that this approach was highly effective at the household level [30 ] , but it is 196 Emerging viruses impossible to say with any certainty whether this affected the course of the pandemic in the UK overall or bought much time compared with countries that did not implement such a policy. Other data are emerging which suggest that a very small proportion of patients in the UK with A(H1N1)pdm09 infection received NAIs despite enhanced accessibility via Internet algorithms and by telephone (A Hayward, personal communication, 2013). In the context of respiratory virus infections that might lead to bacterial secondary infections, the stockpiling of antibiotics and potentially extended pre-pandemic use of pneumococcal vaccines might also be important policy considerations [31, 32] .",

Mytton and colleagues have suggested that the higher mortality due to A(H1N1)pdm09 noted in the UK's third pandemic wave in winter 2010-11 might relate to the restricted availability of NAIS in 2010-11 as compared with the first and second pandemic waves in 2009-10 [33] . An important meta-analysis of studies undertaken during the 2009-10 pandemic period certainly suggests that mortality was reduced when NAI treatment was commenced early (within 48 hours of symptom onset) as compared with late commencement of treatment [34] ; but this effect might be confounded by late treatment of very severe cases that were unlikely to survive whatever therapy was given. However a comparison of early treatment vs. none might be confounded in the opposite direction (to underestimate effectiveness); this too showed that NAIs were associated with a 65% reduction in mortality [34 ] . Further confirmatory data are required which, if consistent, would then justify the replenishment of NAI stockpiles in readiness for a future influenza pandemic.",
