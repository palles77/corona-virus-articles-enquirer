Here, I consider briefly the primary characteristics of complexity theory, with particular emphasis given to relations and networks, non-linearity, emergence, and hybrids. I assess the 'added value' compared with other, existing perspectives that emphasise relationality and connectedness. I also consider the philosophical underpinnings of complexity theory and its reliance on metaphor. As a vehicle for moving away from reductionist accounts, complexity theory potentially has much to say to those interested in research on health inequalities, spatial diffusion, emerging and resurgent infections, and risk. These and other applications in health geography that have invoked complexity theory are examined in the paper. Finally, I consider some of the missing elements in complexity theory and argue that while it is refreshing to see a fruitful line of theoretical debate in health geography, we need good empirical work to illuminate it. r",

Complexity has emerged during the past 5 years as a potentially integrating theme in contemporary social science (Byrne, 1998; Urry, 2003) . Urry (2003, p. 12 ) observes that complexity is 'a potential new paradigm for the social sciences, having transformed much of the physical and biological sciences'. He sees it as a means of dissolving some of the binary divides (whether quantitative/ qualitative, environmental/social, structure/agency, or medical/sociocultural) within the academy. He even suggests that complexity might help break down divisions between the social and the natural sciences (Urry, 2003, pp. 12-13, p. 17) .",

In a health context it might be the set of elements that permit and constrain the spread of a virus within a local community and beyond. These elements could comprise the virus itself, infected and susceptible individuals, health-care resources, transport systems, and so on.

'The capacity for self-organisation is a property of complex systems which enables them to develop or change internal structure spontaneously and adaptively in order to cope with, or manipulate, their environment' (Cilliers, 1998, p. 90 ). Self-organisation does not imply some teleological control mechanism; rather, it implies a process whereby complex structure emerges through simple, unstructured beginnings. Others speak of autopoiesis (literally, selfmaking), where each system component aids the transformation of other components; the network makes itself. What might be examples of emergent properties in the geography of health; what emerges at a collective level that cannot be reduced to statements about individuals? The 'health' of a neighbourhood or community could be said to emerge from the activities and health profiles of the local population, as well as the nature of facilities (health-promoting and health-denying) located there. 'Social capital' would be another example of an emergent property.

Reitsma (2003, p. 14) sees chaos theory as dealing with simple, deterministic, non-linear, dynamic, closed systems that are sensitive to initial conditions. Conversely, complexity theory focuses on non-linear, open systems. These respond to perturbation by organising into emergent forms which cannot be predicted from knowledge only of the system parts. As Sherden (cited in Thrift, 1999, p. 61) argues: 'Chaos refers to turbulent behaviour in a system where the behaviour is totally determined by non-linear laws which amplify the smallest of errors in the initial conditions of the system, making the system unpredictable beyond the shortest of periods. Complexity refers to the phenomenon of order emerging from complex interactions among the components of a system influenced by one or more simple guiding principles'.",

This neglect was occasioned by the emphasis of spatial analysts on network description and spatial form, and the lack of any social content. However, the considerable contemporary effort expended on shedding light on the structure of social networks (and particularly the 'small-world' problem) seems little concerned with the realities of social interaction. A Rwandan refugee may be six steps away from the President of the United States, but the probability of them ever interacting directly is vanishingly small. Comments such as '[t] he global village we've grown used to inhabiting is a new reality for humans' (Baraba\u00b4si, 2002, p. 39 ) ring rather hollow for most of the billions living in the village.

However, while classical systems approaches emphasise problem-solving, prediction and control, complexity theorists undertake exploratory research that emphasises explanation and understanding. Moreover, while relations and networks are critical in complexity theory, as they were in classical approaches, CT foregrounds notions of emergence and hybrids. It is these features that perhaps provide 'added value' and which were missing from classical systems-theoretic accounts.

Byrne (1998, p. 35) argues that complexity accounts are a part of the modernist programme and that 'Bhaskar's scientific realism provides a philosophical ontology which fits pretty well exactly with the scientific ontology underpinning the complexity programme'. Complex accounts are 'absolutely not reductionist and positivist'. Like Urry, Byrne sees complexity theory as a way of relating macro and micro, agency and structure. In contrast, Cilliers (1998) identifies complexity as a postmodern enterprise. For him, postmodern (perhaps, better, post-structuralist) means a sensitivity to complexity. This is roundly endorsed by Henrickson and McKelvey (2002) , who suggest that the ontology of postmodernism parallels that of complexity scientists. 'The lesson from complexity science is that natural scientists have begun finding ways to practice normal science without assuming away the activities of heterogeneous autonomous agents. There is no reason, now, why social scientists cannot combine ''new'' normal science epistemology with postmodernist ontology. Yet very few have done so' (Henrickson & McKelvey, 2002, p. 7293) . Stewart sees complexity theory as 'a child of the enlightenment' (Stewart, 2001, p. 334) although he also notes its use as an argument against positivism and instrumentalism in social science.",

Rather, he wishes to 'consider whether complexity could generate productive metaphors for the social analysis of various ''post-societal'' material worlds ' (2003, p. 121 ). Thrift, like Urry, considers CT to be 'deeply metaphorical' (Thrift, 1999, p. 36 ), but, interestingly, the metaphors 'nearly all strongly depend upon the visual register' (Thrift, 1999, p. 37) . Thrift further notes (1999, p. 49) that 'the use of ''scientific'' metaphors adds a touch of legitimacy' for some knowledge networks (such as New Age practices)-echoing the more trenchant (and controversial) critique of Sokal and Bricmont (1998) . These authors consider that 'examples of scientism can be found in the alleged ''applications'' of the theories of chaos, complexity and self-organisation to sociology, history and business management' (Sokal & Bricmont, 1998, p. 181 ). They are not against 'extrapolating concepts from one field to another, but only against extrapolations made without argument-or throwing around scientific jargon in front ofynon-scientist readers without any regard for its relevance or even its meaning' (Sokal & Bricmont, 1998, pp. ix-x) . The importing of concepts must have some conceptual or empirical justification. They observe that 'a metaphor is usually employed to clarify an unfamiliar concept by relating it to a more familiar one, not the reverse' (Sokal & Bricmont, 1998, p. 9 ). Further, 'The natural sciences are not a mere reservoir of metaphors ready to be used in the human sciencesyin a scientific context these words (chaos, non-linearity, for example) have specific meanings' (Sokal & Bricmont, 1998, p. 177) . They seek theorising that is supported by empirical evidence if it is to be taken seriously and not simply an opportunity to borrow uncritically from the physical sciences.",

First, CT is transdisciplinary (Albrecht et al., 1998) ; many of the leading exponents are those with training in the physical sciences but who are now working across the physical and social sciences. Traditionally, health geographers have drawn upon many disciplines (including epidemiology, statistics, sociology, ecology, cultural studies) to inform their work and so any post-disciplinary perspective that applauds this fuzziness of boundaries is something to which we might be expected to warm. Second, according to Urry (2003, p. 111) CT subverts the distinction between agency and structure; if we want to gain some understanding of the emergence of structure, we need to understand the behaviours of the agents that form part of the system. However, while this has obvious appeal across much of the social sciences, not exclusively the geography of health, it is a feature shared with other perspectives (for example, the structurationist accounts of Giddens, or Bourdieu's relational sociology).",

Despite the disappearance of the graphical and the carto-graphical from much of the research literature, the 'seeing eye' and the ability to detect and describe pattern remains at the forefront of many research methods, including health geography (see, for example, MacKian, 2000) . Fourth, there is an attraction to moving away from reductionist accounts. 'Far too often attempts at the development of a quantitatively founded causal account in sociology have been relatively trivial models of the determinants of outcome for individuals or other entities within a social system. What is required is a return to the concern with the nature of the social system as a wholey' (Byrne, 1998, p. 56, my emphasis) . I find this characteristic particularly persuasive, since far too much epidemiology is of the 'risk-factor' type in which particular factors are controlled in order to reveal the independent effects of others; context and relationship are often marginalised.",

            "text": "I consider below some areas of research in which a complexity 'take' has been adopted, and, briefly, areas where it might prove productive. Brown and Moon (2002, pp. 362-363) note that the new public health has 'advocated a multi-causal approach that saw infectious and chronic, degenerative disorders as being the result of a complex interaction between biophysical, social or psychological factors' (my italics). Complexity is about relationships that cannot be reduced to simple linear models or their variants (such as logistic regression). It counters much traditional (geographical and environmental) epidemiology and public health that relates health outcomes to determinants at the individual level. Even the now widely used multilevel modelling (MLM) is cast within the same mould, since it fails to capture connection, relationship and context in an adequate way. While Byrne (1998, p. 68) says that 'the world does consist of things which contain thingsythe hierarchical character of data is real', and Krieger (1994) also applauds the use of MLM as a device for capturing the often-missed contextual factors, it is doubtful that MLM offers an adequate methodology for capturing the complexity of context. It is not just the individuals or a simple aggregation thereof that matter-the containing social system matters too. Interestingly, Byrne goes on to mention Richard Wilkinson's work, in which death rates (from the aggregation of individuals) are related to inequality ('an emergent property of the relationship between individual incomes and wealth'- Byrne, 1998, p. 70) . Unemployment rates, tenure patterns, mortality are examples of system properties with social significance and system effects; to this list we could add residential segregation and social capital. Krieger (1994) discusses the metaphorical 'web' of causative factors and disease outcomes in epidemiology, 'an elegantly linked network of delicate strandsysymbolising diverse causal pathways' (Krieger, 1994, p. 890) . But, as she notes, the 'web' was 'spiderless', positing a biomedical model in which the orientation was individualistic rather than population-focused and reflecting a concern less with epidemiological theory and more with epidemiological methods. One alternative to a webbased approach would be a political economy perspective in which the health status of different social groups (women versus men, gays versus straights, black versus white, poor versus rich) are compared in terms of the relations between such groups. Krieger, however, prefers an 'ecosocial' epidemiological theory in which population-level approaches are combined with biological thinking. She would replace the web metaphor with a 'fractal' metaphor in which biological and social factors are linked at every level or scale. Admittedly, 'this is not a developed metaphor' (Krieger, 1994, p. 899) ; nonetheless, at a very broad scale it is very much in keeping with a complexity agenda in which there are no sharp boundaries between global social relations and the environment (Urry, 2003, p. 46) .",

Buchanan (2002, p. 181 ) notes that some 'aristocratic' networks (where there are a few highly connected people) do not need a threshold or tipping point. Such networks 'do not possess an epidemic threshold below which diseases cannot produce a major epidemic outbreak or the onset of an endemic state.",

The implication is that the 'connectors' have to be targeted. In other words, change the structure of the network and the spread is halted. This was very much the argument in Peter Gould's work on HIV/AIDS (1993). Gould shows very clearly how HIV is 'traffic' on a structure or 'backcloth' formed by relations among human actors; 'to stop the HIV traffic transmission you have to break the connections and so fragment the backcloth' (Gould, 1993, p. 33 ; see also Baraba\u00b4si, 2002, pp. 123-142; Buchanan, 2002, pp. 170-183) . At a regional and local scale, the existence of a 'tipping point' is crucial in whether a disease becomes an epidemic. For example, Buchanan (2002, p. 163) refers to the epidemic of syphilis in Baltimore in 1995. 'One infection may have been triggering, on average, just less than one other infection, and so the disease was keeping itself in check. But then crack cocaine, a few less doctors, and the dislocation of a localised community out into the larger city pushed the disease over the edge-it tipped, and these little factors made a very big difference'. However, surely we need to understand better the 'upstream' factors-why the doctors were cut, why crack cocaine was being used, why people were removed from their homes, and so on; surely some further social theorising is required? This is provided in the Wallaces' accounts and suggests some potentially fruitful integration between spatial diffusion and health inequalities research trajectories.",

            "text": "Disease ecology and 're-emerging diseases' Albrecht et al. (1998, p. 73) argue, in their 'pitch' for complexity, that: 'The interaction of host and parasite, the role of vectors, the host's state of health, genetic predisposition, standards of hospital infection control, the way humans produce food and a multitude of social factors will all have some influence on disease outcomes'. They refer to a study of Japanese encephalitis in northern Thailand, which illustrates 'the characteristic in complex systems of interactive causality among people, the mosquito, the virus, domestic animals, and introduced technology' (Albrecht et al., 1998, p. 72) . Clearly, in the light of statements such as these we need to develop further the connections between the complexity agenda and the disease ecology tradition that predates it by several decades (Meade & Earickson, 2000: Chapter 2; Levins & Lopez, 1999) . Mayer (2000, p. 937) notes that a key principle of disease ecology is that 'population, society and both the physical and biological environments are in dynamic equilibrium'. But a key feature of CT is that systems may be far from equilibrium (Table 1 ), in which case we need, as Mayer argues, a good understanding of the impact that landuse change, climate change, population turnover, and so on have on population health. In particular, the emergence and resurgence of particular diseases needs to be set in the wider context of changes that are economic, political and social, as well as environmental. A good example would be Lyme disease, where '[t]he chain of events that have led to the emergence and recognition of Lyme disease in New England is complex' (Mayer, 2000, p. 942) . It is, Mayer argues, 'reductionist' to suggest that the 'cause' of Lyme disease is to be found simply in a good understanding of the pathogen involved. But to take other examples (such as TB and HIV/AIDS) we need to develop a better understanding of the links between population health and the processes of globalisation. Among these processes Mayer gives prominence to those of population movement. Similar views are expressed by the Harvard Working Group on New and Resurgent Diseases (1996, p. 170) : 'if one lesson has emerged from the spectacular failure of Western medicine to eradicate certain diseases, it is that diseases cannot be reduced to a single cause or explained within a prevailing linear scientific method: complexity is their hallmark'. I think we need to carve out research agendas that fuse globalisation debates, disease ecology and complexity theory, informed by imaginative empirical work.",

It resulted from one tiny 'blip' in the constant movement of cattle to abattoirs, a blip that nonetheless carried the infection from one farm to a market from whence the disease spread rapidly. Again, it is the movement (flow) that matters, a set of relations that involves hybrids of human and non-human actors. Loss of income to farmers and those institutions and businesses sustaining the farming community, together with the tourist sector, were all unintended consequences, forcing, in effect, the virtual closure of the countryside (Convery et al., 2005) for about 12 months. 'This has in part led to a loss of self-esteem, an increasing sense of isolation amongst livestock farmers and called into question a ''whole way of life'' and social identity' (Convery et al., 2005) . In Cumbria, 40 per cent of farms were subject to animal culls (rising to 70 per cent in the north of the county), with over 1 million sheep, 215,000 cattle, and 39,000 pigs slaughtered. The scale of slaughter impacted on local sense of identity and 'on their everyday living and working relations with the landscape, livestock and with others in their communityythere was a clear breach of normal relations' (Convery et al., 2005, original italics) . 'Death was in the wrong place (the farm rather than the abattoir), but it was also at the wrong time (in relation to the farm calendar) and on the wrong scale (such large-scale slaughter seldom occurs at the same time)' (Convery et al., 2005) .",

He seeks to understand both their daily, taken-forgranted, habitual lives and how 'they accommodate to turning points and transitional events in their lives' (Rowles, 2000, p. 53S) , appealing to complexity theory in the search for this understanding. He looks at the daily routines of older people within their communities as 'part of a whole, a social ecology that functioned as a delicately balanced homeostatic system' (Rowles, 2000, p. 55S) . Interestingly, he cites Roger Barker's ecological psychology here and, as an aside, this approach to psychology and place is something that geographers in general, and health geographers in particular, seem to have missed (Barker, 1968) . But Rowles seems keen to move from interesting biographical accounts to 'consider each resident of Colton as immersed in a complex system of inextricably interrelated actions, relationships, and environmental meanings that are in a state of homeostatis. This homeostasis has its own dynamic, with consequences reverberating throughout the system when any element changes' (Rowles, 2000, p. 59S) . Thus, the ecology is disrupted when people die or become ill (and the network of relationships thereby changes). Their lives are 'immersed in messy, complicated, interconnected systems that are not linear, static, or absolutely predictable' (Rowles, 2000, p. 61S) . Aside from wondering what 'linear' means in this context this remark seems rather uncontroversial, since all of us live lives that have the same characteristics. I am not convinced that our understanding of the mental wellbeing of older Appalachian folk is significantly enhanced by Rowles' appeal to complexity theory. I would argue that we gain as much-maybe more-from the timespace geographies that Ha\u00a8gerstrand (1970) proposed, long before complexity theory emerged, and which Rowles himself cites. Alternatively, very sophisticated and engaging accounts of lives lived in particular places (for example, Davidson, 2003) have been developed without a wholly metaphorical use of complexity theory.",

            "text": "I think we can claim at least three missing 'elements' in CT accounts. First, the human voice seems to be missing from much of the complexity theory. The qualitative is there, but in the form of qualitative structures and patterns, not in the nature of the embodied actor. An exception might be Rowles' work, though I have argued above that a complexity perspective offers relatively little in our understanding of lived worlds in small rural communities. Is the behaviour of a small number of older people in an isolated setting so very complex? Stewart (2001) considers that '[T]he bulk of writing on social complexity is decidedly limited in its relation to social relevant philosophical traditions such as phenomenology, hermeneutics, psychoanalysis, and modernist retrieval of lived experience in a devastated world' (Stewart, 2001, p. 334) . He bemoans the neglect of real lives and actors (real people in contested history -Stewart, 2001, p. 354) . Some complexity theorists appear to agree. As Baraba\u00b4si has it: 'The goal before us is to understand complexity. To achieve that, we must move beyond structure and topology and start focusing on the dynamics that take place along the links. Networks are only the skeleton of complexity, the highways for the various processes that make our world hum. To describe society we must dress the links of the social network with actual dynamical interactions between people' (Baraba\u00b4si, 2002, p. 225) .",

War is a psychosis caused by an inability to see relationships. Thrift (1999) notes that complexity theory is 'heterarchical' rather than hierarchical and for this reason it might be thought to appeal to feminist audiences.

Territory and a sense of identity with particular places still matters. Spatial segregation has health impacts, our social connections and support at local level still matters, and the connections and relations stressed by complexity theorists are still very firmly local, at least for some. Those living in affluent countries might be exposed to viruses circulating in Africa or elsewhere (Haiti, for example, Farmer, 1992 Farmer, , 1999 and such viruses may well have impacts that become global in their reach.

Haggett's comment that 'one can do little with the unique except contemplate its uniqueness' (Haggett, 1965, p. 3) is equally true of some invocations of complexity. There is a clear need to move beyond the casual use of metaphor and to explore further the added value of CT for our research in disease ecology, health inequalities and spatial diffusion, all traditional-and still critically important-areas in health geography.",
