The incidence of cellphone-only households is higher for low-income and young adults. 1 A recent study has shown that when data are weighted demographically, including a cell-only sample with a landline RDD sample produces population estimates that are nearly identical to those from the landline sample alone. 2 However, another",

However, even without these households, the results suggest that the problems of low-income people are large enough to warrant attention from public health officials.",
