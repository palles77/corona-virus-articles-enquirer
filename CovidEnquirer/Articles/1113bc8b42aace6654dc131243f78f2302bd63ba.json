The family Circoviridae is currently composed of 2 genera, Gyrovirus and Circovirus, each of which has been associated with diseases in birds, pigs, and dogs (1,2). Among birds, circovirus infections have been associated with beak abnormalities, lethargy, and anorexia in parrots and pigeons and production losses and death in geese (3, 4) . Among pigs, porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2) causes respiratory and enteric diseases, dermatitis, and reproductive problems, resulting in major economic losses to the pork industry (5, 6) . A proposed new genus (Cyclovirus) within the family Circoviridae consists of cycloviruses. Genomes of cycloviruses have been identified in human and chimpanzee feces and human cerebrospinal fluid (7, 8) . Recently, circoviruses have been found in bats and have shown high genetic diversity (9,10). We describe a novel circovirus in mink (mustelids). This mink circovirus (MiCV) was found in the liver, digestive tract, and fecal specimens from mink with diarrhea as their main clinic sign.",

The farmers called this refractory diarrhea. According to the observations of the farmers, the incubation period of this disease was <10 days. The preliminary clinical signs included lethargy, anorexia, pale muzzle, and unkempt fur. The feces were initially white and then became jelly red or yellow. Several days after the appearance of red or yellow feces, \u22487% of affected mink died.

The mink in this area are pedigree breeds with premium quality fur; all other farms introducing stock from this area were also affected. Spread of the infection seemed to be horizontal because mink were usually affected after a mink on the same farm became ill.

Using PCR-based methods, we excluded the following as causative agent: mink enteritis virus, canine distemper virus, Aleutian mink disease virus, mink orthoreovirus, and mink coronavirus. To identify the causative agent, we separately homogenized fecal, liver, and gut samples from diseased unvaccinated mink in phosphate-buffered saline and then submitted the supernatants to negative staining and observation under an electron microscope. We found circovirus-like particles, but not in typical lattice arrangement, in liver and gut samples. We performed PCRs with degenerate primers (CV-F1, CV-R1, CV-F2, and CV-R2; Table 1 ) based on highly conserved amino acid motifs in the Rep proteins of circoviruses and cycloviruses. Products of \u2248400 bp were purified and sequenced by using primer CV-R2.",
