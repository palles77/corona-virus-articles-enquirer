Therefore, due to its multifactorial nature, studies of risk factors for neonatal calf diarrhoea should ideally be performed using comprehensive laboratory investigations and multivariable analyses, but data from such studies are scant.",

Collectively, these regions included~75% of the national dairy cattle register. 1 The target population was that of all calves on farms milking >150 cows. This minimum farm-size allowed the sampling of multiple calves of the selected ages on each farm, on a single sampling occasion. The sampling frame was represented by all the farms milking >150 cows registered in a database, which in-cluded~10,600 farms milking >150 cows, corresponding to approximately 90% of the estimated number of dairy farms in the country. 2 The co-ordinates of all the eligible farms were plotted on a New Zealand map delineating regional authorities, and the proportion of farms contributed by each region calculated. A total of 240 farms were selected using random numbers with a regionally proportional sampling scheme. Farmers were contacted by phone and the first 50% willing to participate from each region were recruited. A sample size of 120 was the maximum number that could be reached for sampling during the second half of the calving season. Each farm was visited once. In order to account for the significant differences in the susceptibility of the age-groups to the different infectious agents, two groups of calves were sampled.",

These were firstly the risk factors for neonatal calf diarrhoea. The probability of passing liquid faeces at the day of sampling was in theory correlated to the incidence of diarrhoea on the farm, and the duration of the diarrhoea. Thus, this study analysed the presence of variables independently associated with liquid faeces, using the binary outcome: presence/absence of faecal score 3. The second question considered risk factors for enteropathogen shedding, in which we analysed the presence of variables independently associated with the presence of each enteropathogen in faeces using binary outcomes: presence/absence of each enteropathogen (separate univariate models were fitted for each enteropathogen).",

In 9 to 21-day-old calves, dam vaccination against enteropathogens was associated with decreased odds of liquid faeces, in agreement with the experimental evidence (Gonzalez et al., 2010) . Dam vaccination is usually implemented during late pregnancy to increase specific colostral immunoglobulin content. In some studies, vaccinating farms were more likely to manifest diarrhoea than nonvaccinating farms (Waltner-Toews et al., 1986a; Frank and Kaneene, 1993; Bendali et al., 1999) . However, the effect of vaccination depends, among other reasons, on the type of circulating agents. Furthermore, in some regions vaccination could be more common in severely affected farms than in farms affected with mild diarrhoea, so comparison of the effect of vaccination between regions is difficult.",

Exposure to winter weather might predispose calves to indigestion and diarrhoea, and provision of shelter could improve calf health. In this age-group, calves on farms reporting colostrum administration within the first 2 h of a calf's life had smaller odds of liquid faeces compared with calves on farms reporting administration within 6 h. Administering first colostrum was also associated with decreased odds of liquid faeces compared with stored or mixed colostrum. These factors might have been acted independently, or through the presence of undetected infectious agents (e.g. calves sampled in pre-or post-patent periods). Nevertheless, delaying colostrum intake is known to decrease intestinal immunoglobulin and fat-soluble vitamin absorption (Bellinzoni et al., 1989; Fayer et al., 2000; Bazeley, 2003) , and the results highlight the importance of administering first colostrum as soon as possible after birth.",

According to the responses to the questionnaire, most waste milk originated from cows affected with mastitis or treated with antibiotics (data not shown).

The potential benefits of the administration of waste milk should, however, be assessed in specifically designed prospective studies, Table 3 Variables independently associated with liquid faeces with P < 0.5 in the final logistic regression models with random farm effect. and the risk for development of antimicrobial resistance should also be taken into account. The 9 to 21-day old female calves had lower odds of liquid faeces than males. Whereas male calves might have little economic value, the value of replacement females is high, potentially influencing neonatal care. In some systems, the rates of dystocia are greater in males, which might affect passive immunoglobulin transfer due to reduced calf vigour and delayed colostrum ingestion (Bellows et al., 1982; Johanson and Berger, 2003) . The use of straw was also associated with decreased odds of liquid faeces compared to sawdust in this age group. This is consistent with other reports suggesting straw as an optimal bedding material (Brenner et al., 2005; Stull and Reynolds, 2008; Mohler et al., 2009) .
