Motif mimicry tolerates mutations, evolves quickly to modify interactions with the host, and enables modular interactions with protein complexes. Host cells cannot easily coordinate changes to conserved motif recognition and binding interfaces under selective pressure to maintain critical signaling pathways. SLiMs offer potential for use in synthetic biology, such as better immunogens and therapies, but may also present biosecurity challenges. We survey viral uses of SLiMs to mimic host proteins, and information resources available for motif discovery.

            "text": "Viruses exploit host cellular processes to replicate, and have developed myriad ways to subvert host immune defenses. Molecular mimicry (see Glossary) is a common and effective strategy, enabling a pathogen to usurp host protein function by resemblance [1, 2] . Molecular mimicry varies over a continuum, from one extreme that includes sequence and structural similarity (i.e., orthologs) of entire proteins, to another extreme of chemical similarity at only a few localized sites, as is the case for short linear motifs (SLiMs). The growing body of literature on SLiMs indicates that some important virushost interactions can be attributed to a few well-chosen AAs [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Rather than devote entire proteins to one function, SLiMs enable multifunctional viral proteins. Interactions between globular virus and host proteins have picomolar affinities, while SLiMs have micromolar binding affinities with globular host proteins [8] . Moderate binding affinity of SLiMs facilitates disruption of signaling interactions, rather than competing for stable formation of persistent protein complexes. Synthetic biology practitioners can benefit from an introduction to how SLiMs enable viral interference with host cell functions and computational resources available for SLiM analysis. Viral SLiMs are potentially useful in synthetic biology, to provide a toolkit for new functions, for example, to modulate immune responses or to complement and interact with newly developed adjuvants in a synergistic manner [9] . Research efforts to develop broad-spectrum antiviral compounds or design broadly cross-protective vaccine immunogens benefit directly from knowledge of gene products, protein functions, and motifs involved with viral immune interference. N-linked glycosylation of the PNG sequon is a well-known example used by viral glycoproteins as camouflage against immune recognition [10, 11] . The distribution of N-linked glycosylation sites has recently been recognized as essential for the design of immunogens to induce broadly cross-reactive immune protection against such challenging viruses as HIV-1 [12, 13] . Motifs associated with cellular trafficking (localization, transport, secretion, and sequestration) are readily edited to modify where expression products go, and change interaction profiles with other proteins [14] . In addition to motifs that stabilize the structure of immunogens, such as trimerization ('foldon') [15] [16] [17] [18] and dimerization [19, 20] domains, motifs that interact with cellular processes for innate antiviral pathways could be used to enhance immunogenicity. While SLiMs in eukaryotic proteins have been discussed extensively, SLiM involvement in viral immunomodulation remains less thoroughly explored, and suggests new opportunities for use in engineered biotechnology applications.",

Thus, partial sequence matches are sufficient for transient binding interactions with target domains, for example, signal transduction proteins. This observation led to the proposal of ex nihilo SLiM evolution -the evolution of a novel SLiM 'from nothing' -the appearance of a new functional module from a previously nonfunctional region of protein sequence [24] . Because hosts' interaction networks are often conserved, SLiMs represent a significant vulnerability for opportunistic exploitation. These properties enable pathogens to acquire host-like SLiMs rapidly through ex nihilo convergent evolution, to rewire host interaction networks, and to acquire tropism and virulence traits needed for successful adaptation and propagation [25] . Over 200 motifs are known, with 2,400 validated instances, and many more motifs may await discovery [3, 26] .

Work to use SLiMs in bioengineering can benefit from understanding viral protein function. This information is organized in viral knowledge bases, such as ViralZone (Box 1). Ontologies describe systematically the many different functional roles of viral proteins, including immune evasion. By promoting use of standard terms for relationships between concepts, an ontology arranges concepts into a framework that can be updated as knowledge grows. Protein function is captured broadly in such a framework, though the nuanced details of interactions with other molecules are not localized to domains or motifs.",

When administered together with an antigen, it induces more potent responses than the antigen alone. Autophagy: an evolutionarily conserved degradation system for maintaining cellular homeostasis and innate immunity to clear pathogens from cells. Domain: structure-based modular subunit of a protein, often with a specific function. Domains are generally larger and associated with structural subunits, while motifs are shorter and associated with intrinsically disordered protein regions. ELM: the eukaryotic linear motif resource (elm.eu.org), a repository of known SLiMs; includes annotation from primary literature and information about experimental assays used. Glycosylation: post-translational modification by host transferases linking sugar molecules to side chains of either nitrogen (Nlinked) in asparagine or oxygen (O-linked) in serine or threonine. Viral proteins like HIV-1 envelope can be heavily glycosylated, providing camouflage against immune recognition, shifting as the PNG sequon mutates. GO: Gene Ontology, an ontology for genetic products of any and all organisms, providing a framework to annotate gene and protein functions in genetic sequence databases and bioinformatics analysis procedures. GO includes multiple dimensions to capture biological complexity in adequate depth: molecular function, cellular component, and biological process. GO development is conducted by a consortium of research communities and databases, which regularly solicits input and feedback from the broader research community. Immune modulation: interference with an immune-related process by a pathogen. Intrinsically disordered protein/ domain: regions of a protein sequence that are predicted or experimentally shown not to form consistent structure, e.g., a helices or b sheets. Such regions tend to be more accessible for interactions with other proteins. term/GO:0030683, Figure 1 ).

In [38] , they discuss this issue in depth, and recommend a workflow for SLiM discovery that culminates in experimental validation, whether in vivo or in vitro.

Though MEME was developed for discovery of DNA sequence motifs, it generates ungapped, profile-based motifs using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. No single method is inherently better than the rest, but the choice of which to use depends on several factors, such as the input sequence data, whether one sequence, an alignment, or a collection of nonhomologous sequences [40] . To illustrate the diversity of motif discovery methods, this section mentions only a handful of the software tools available (Table 3) .

A program called SLiMPrints works around this with a specialized approach to model substitutions [42] . SLiMPrints uses a statistical model of relative local conservation, which looks for clusters of overly constrained sites in a window of about 30 AAs, using IUPred scores (intrinsically unordered prediction; see later) to weigh sites in intrinsically disordered protein regions more heavily than sites in globular (ordered) regimes [42] .",

An important caveat is that to assume such sequences are independent could yield spurious enrichment of shared patterns, so alignment-free methods need to compensate for evolutionary constraints at the domain level, rather than for full-length homologous proteins. The development of such corrections and their relative advantages are detailed in [40] .

            "text": "HSV-1 and HSV-2 virulence factor ICP34.5 assists in viral immune evasion by molecular mimicry. HSV-1 neurovirulence protein ICP34.5, encoded by the g34.5 gene, initiates immune interference by binding and sequestering cellular proteins that would stimulate autophagy, translational arrest, and type I interferon responses. HSV-1 ICP34.5 binds TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) to prevent type I interferon induction [75] , Beclin-1 to prevent autophagy [76] , and both PP1a and eIF2a to overcome translational arrest [77] . HSV-2 g34.5 contains an intron not present in HSV-1, and up to four isoforms of HSV-2 ICP34.5 are known [78] . Full-length HSV-2 ICP34.5 has conserved PP1a and eIF2a-binding domains, but lacks TBK1 and Beclin-1 binding domains [79] . Additional HSV-1 motifs influence intracellular localization [80] , virion maturation, and egress [81] , not yet characterized in HSV-2. HSV-2 is recognized as more virulent than HSV-1, but both can cause neuropathology, including viral encephalitis and meningitis [82] . To attenuate virulence, ICP34.5 is routinely deleted or inactivated when making HSV-1 constructs for oncolytic therapy [82] . Both are the same length and share domain structures, and partially share SLiM compositions ( Figure I ). Identifying differences in SLiMs from each could provide clues for more detailed experimental investigations to understand ICP34.5 virulence determinants and host protein targets. exclude a region predicted to fold as globular protein. These predictions were made by SMART (simple modular architecture research tool) [51] and Pfam [52] domain matches, corroborated by GlobPlot [53] . Another widely used approach is to identify regions of local disorder, where protein structure is not clearly defined, making that region accessible to interact with other proteins. IUPred [54] is commonly used for this task, though the choice of parameter settings and how to interpret results varies. ELM results include an IUPred disorder score and a simple cutoff of 0.5 to define the disorder transition. Above this value, local protein structure is considered accessible for interaction with other proteins.",

The approach compared numbers of proteins per genome that carry each motif, and doubtlessly includes many motif instances that are not functional as SLiMs. Also, shorter motifs occur more frequently than longer motifs [3, 27] , partly due to chance alone. Regardless, systematic error may be considered a source of background noise across the large number of proteins in 11 viral proteomes, each having different host specificities, to enable somewhat meaningful comparisons, in such a 'statistical genomics' approach [3] .

A motif is considered rare and therefore significantly unlikely to occur by chance if it is present at or below some cutoff frequency. Restricting the sequence region that is used for permutation testing, such as by use of structural considerations, can further focus the search. Indeed, such a hybrid filtering approach was described recently and evaluated on the HIV-1 proteome [57] . Following methods described in an earlier study [58] , Becerra et al. used IUPred with a modified, window-based scoring procedure to identify intrinsically disordered protein regions, and tested for statistical rarity below 1% of 1000 shuffled variants. The approach further considered conservation above 70% in a set of aligned sequences, though combining three filtering criteria was too stringent and excluded all motif candidates [57] .",

A similar query for the HSV-1 protein (UniProt P08353) gives 158 instances of 42 distinct motifs, and 114 instances of 36 motifs when filtered. Most of the ELM motif hits are probably false positives, if only because the motif expressions overlap.

The HSV-1 version contains a 30 amino acid ATP triplet repeat at sites 160-190, not found in the HSV-2 protein. ELM matches four motifs here, only one of which (DOC_CKS1_1) is unique to HSV-1.
