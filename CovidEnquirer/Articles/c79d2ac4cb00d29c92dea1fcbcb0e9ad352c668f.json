            "text": "Pandemic influenza A H1N1 virus swept across the globe from 2009 to 2010, resulting in 18,000 of human victims over 214 nations according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Annual occurrence of influenza A virus causes significant casualties and economic loss [1, 2] . Considering the detrimental effect on human being and livestock evenwith low quantity of virus, early detection of the influenza A virus and its subtype is paramount of importance to prevent social damages [3, 4] . Among the diagnostic tools, the genetic analysis of epidemics caused by influenza A viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and foot-and-mouth-disease virus (FMDV) is regarded as most sensitive, accurate, and multiplex [5, 6] . In contrast to the conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based target gene detectionwhich requires a long PCR time due to the thermal cycling and slow ramping rate, and a bulky and expensive instrumentation, recent researches have focused on the development of the isothermal amplification methods for simple and userfriendly genetic analysis including loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA), rolling circle amplification (RCA), recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), and helicase-dependent amplification (HDA). In particular, LAMP is rapid, sensitive, and specific for boosting up the target genes [7] . Generally, LAMP uses six primers spanning eight distinct sequence on the target gene and a DNA polymerase for strand displacement reaction at 60$65 C in 1 h, leading to the ladderpatterned multiple amplicon products [8, 9] . Besides targeting DNA templates, LAMP can be used for RNA amplification by simply adding a reverse transcriptase enzyme under the identical reaction conditions as LAMP, so-called reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP). Thus, a variety of pathogens can be identified through the RT-LAMP reaction using their viral RNA as a template with one-step (without a separate reverse transcription step), high speed, specificity, and sensitivity [10] [11] [12] . Ge et al. reported a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification combined with a lateral flow device to detect influenza A H7N9 virus targeting hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) gene [13] . The detection sensitivity was 10 copies of RNA, and 100% specificity was observed. Fang et al. demonstrated an RT-LAMP microdevice to detect multiplex influenza A viruses with an optical detector [14] . A PDMS-glass hybrid microdevice could simultaneously identify 8 samples of influenza A viruses with 8 copies of a limit of detection. Since the RT-LAMP employs only one reaction temperature, the temperature controller system can be simplified, enabling us to construct a miniaturized genetic analysis system for on-site RT-LAMP based pathogen detection [15, 16] . Regarding the detection methods for LAMP amplicons, gel electrophoresis, realtime turbidity monitoring which is derived by phosphate precipitates, and calcein mediated colorimetric detection have been proposed [17, 18] . However, these detection techniques require complicated, bulky and specialized instrumentations, which diminish the point-of-care testing capability of RT-LAMP. To fully take advantages of the RT-LAMP, the detection methodology should be simple, rapid and cost-effective [19] . In this sense, the colorimetric detection would be ideal due to its user-friendliness, simplicity, and ease to interpret the result. To this end, an immunochromatographic strip (ICS) has been widely utilized, and commercialized for pathogen diagnostic tools [11, 13, [20] [21] [22] . However, the existing ICSs are designed only to identify one influenza A virus type, not for subtyping influenza A virus whose information is important for medical prognosis and treatment. In addition, despite the usefulness of the multiplex gene amplification in a single reaction tube for accurate and reliable pathogen detection with low cost [23, 24] , multiplex RT-LAMP has been rarely investigated. The differentiation of the ladder-like RT-LAMP amplicons derived from multiple target genes is still challengeable [14, 15] .",

The incorporated biotin-dUTPs in the amplicons serve as binding moieties with the streptavidin coated gold nanoparticles in the conjugate pad. So, the high amount of biotin-dUTP can increase the detection sensitivity in the ICS, but can simultaneously decrease the isothermal amplification efficiency. Thus, the concentration ratio of dTTP and biotin-dUTP was fixed to 50:3 based on our previous report [27] , and the concentration of dNTPs was tuned with 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, 2.0, and 2.4 mM in the multiplex RT-LAMP reaction. At the concentration of 0.8 and 1.2 mM dNTPs (lane 1 and 2 in Fig. S2b(i) ), only H1 gene was dominant. At the concentration of 1.6 mM dNTPs, both H1 and M genes were amplified, showing the additional band around 125 bp (lane 3 in Fig. S2b(i) ). Interestingly, the band pattern at the concentration of 2.0 mM dNTPs (lane 4) looks similar to that of lane 3, but the strong red color at the bottom suggested that the Texas Red-labeled primers which were added to amplify H1 gene were not successfully incorporated. At high 2.4 mM concentration (lane 5), there was also a red band in the gel electrophoresis, and both H1 and M genes were not produced, probably due to inhibition to the enzyme activity [28] . We analyzed the same multiplex RT-LAMP products on the ICS (Fig. S2b(ii) ). The amplicon products at the concentration of 0.8 and 1.2 mM dNTPs showed only H1 gene expression (#1 and #2 in Fig. S2b(ii) ), which was matched with the gel pattern of lane 1 and 2 in Fig. S2b(i) . #3 on the ICS shows both H1 and M gene expression, which was correspondent to the lane 3 in the electropherogram. However, in case of #4 on the ICS, only M gene test line was visualized, although the gel band patterns of lane 3 and 4 in Fig. S2b (i) were similar. These results imply that the ICS could obviously distinguish the multiplex RT-LAMP products, which could not be discernible in the gel electropherogram. Although it is not clear at this moment why the dNTP concentration affected the gene amplification efficiency in the multiplex RT-LAMP reaction, it is likely that the control of dNTP concentration is critical to produce the comparable amount of multiple target genes in the multiplex RT-LAMP.",

To solve this problem, Iseki et al. suggested a digestion process by using restriction enzymes for the multiplex LAMP products to distinguish multiple targets, but the proposed method is time-consuming, high-priced, and inadequate for on-site detection [29] . On the contrary, our ICS can clearly show the monoplex and multiplex gene expression. Fig. 4b displays the monoplex and multiplex HA and M gene amplicons of three influenza A viral strains on the ICS. In addition to the control line (the top line), the HA gene (H1, H3, and H5) expression was observed in the middle test line, and the M gene expression was monitored from the bottom test line. All the data were matched with those of gel electropherograms with higher confidence. Influenza A H1N1 virus was confirmed by detecting both H1 and M genes, influenza A H3N2 virus was verified by observing both H3 and M gene expression, and influenza A H5N1 virus was identified due to the expression of both H5 and M gene. Thus, the subtyping of three influenza A viruses was achieved simply and rapidly by combining the multiplex RT-LAMP with ICS.",

Influenza A H1N1 viral RNA was used with 10 6 copies to amplify H1 and M genes, and the experiments were performed at least three times in all cases. The band intensities were gradually reduced as the reaction time decreased (Fig. 5a) . Thirty minutes of the multiplex RT-LAMP were enough to produce the amplicon ladder patterns on the gel as well as the three lines on the ICS (Fig. 5b) . At 20 min of the reaction time, the product ladder patterns became faint on the gel and only test line 1 indicating H1 gene amplification was positive, suggesting that H1 gene was more efficient than M gene during the multiplex RT-LAMP reaction. We chose 40 min as an optimized reaction time considering the multiplex RT-LAMP with low copy of viral RNAs.",

After RNAs were extracted, the purified RNAs were isothermally amplified for 40 min at 66 C with the multiplex RT-LAMP primer sets for targeting H1 and M genes, H3 and M genes, or H5 and M genes. Sample 1 revealed three lines only with the H1 and M gene targeting primer sets, indicating the subtype of influenza A H1N1 virus. Samples 2 and 3 showed three lines with the H3 and M gene targeting primer sets, suggesting that the clinical sample was infected by influenza A H3N2 virus (Fig. 7) . To confirm the result accuracy of the combined multiplex RT-LAMP and ICS, the clinical samples were also analyzed by a conventional real-time RT-PCR (Fig. S3) [30] . While sample 1 produced positive results only for H1 and M gene amplification, samples 2 and 3 showed positive results for H3 and M gene amplification. Thus, the results obtained from the RT-LAMP and ICS were perfectly matched with those of the real-time RT-PCR profile with reduced time. These results demonstrated that the multiplex RT-LAMP and ICS techniques could be applied for real clinical samples to pathotype and subtype influenza A virus with high speed, simplicity and accuracy. Multiplex RT-LAMP and ICS were performed in 40 min and 15 min, respectively, so the total process time was completed in 55 min.",

Texas Red and Digoxigenin hapten labels were used for detecting HA and conserved M gene on the ICS through the hapten and anti-hapten interaction.
