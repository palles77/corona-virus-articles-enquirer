These abnormal test results did not correlate with the clinical condition of the corresponding patients. Upon cross checking, the sodium concentrations of these patients were found to be normal when venous blood samples were analysed in our main chemical pathology laboratory, where electrolytes are measured in heparinised plasma by the DP Modular analyser (Roche Diagnostics, USA) using an indirect ion-selective electrode (ISE) method. A malfunction of the RP400 analyser was suspected initially. However, quality control records showed no evidence of instrument failure. All POC blood gas and electrolyte analysers in our hospital are networked and connected centrally to the main chemical pathology laboratory, with automatic daily monitoring of performance (internal quality control) and subscription to the monthly external quality assurance program (QAP) organised by the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia (RCPA) and the Australasian Association of Clinical Biochemists (AACB). This POC connectivity system has been accredited by the National Association of Testing Authorities, Australia (NATA) and RCPA. Table 1 illustrates some of the abnormal results.",

During the SARS epidemic there was an inadequate supply of our usual hand hygiene product Hexol Antiseptic Lotion (Hexol; Sigma Pharmaceuticals, Australia) due to simultaneous upgrading of infection control measures in many other departments of nearly all hospitals in Hong Kong. Microshield Antimicrobial Hand Gel (MAH gel; Johnson & Johnson Medical, Australia) and some other products were provided as substitute ( Table 2 ). The abnormal and discrepant sodium results began to emerge after we changed to MAH gel. Furthermore, the erroneous results were noted to occur much more frequently with capillary blood sampling. Therefore, contamination of blood samples by MAH gel was suspected to be the cause of the spuriously high sodium results.",

The provision of rapid and reliable analysis of blood samples allows important clinical decisions to be made in a timely fashion. It is of great importance that potential sources of interference with POC analysers are recognised and avoided. Previous studies have identified several potential causes of interference of electrolyte analysis with ISE-based instruments. 6-10 These problems include contamination of samples, 6 difference in electrode design, 6, [8] [9] [10] variations in salt bridge solution, 6, 8, 10 and interfering substances in the blood specimen itself. 6, 8, 9 To the best of our knowledge, the interference effects of hand disinfectants on electrolyte measurements by ISEbased analysers have not been previously reported. From our study, the effects of contamination on electrolyte measurements are not only statistically significant, but also clinically important in that they may result in serious errors in patient management if not recognised. These interferences are not due to the electrolyte content of the hand disinfectants, since their sodium and potassium concentrations are very low. It seems that the effects are due to substances in the disinfectants that interfere with the measuring process of the analyser. In particular, it has been previously reported that benzalkonium chloride, one of the constituents of MAH gel, can grossly affect sodium measurement by ISE-based analysers. 7 Further investigation to identify the interfering substance(s) is required. Whether altering the design of the electrodes or salt bridge solution can reduce or eliminate the interference effects should be explored by the manufacturing industry.",

Taking the within-individual biological variations for sodium and potassium concentrations to be 0.7% and 4.8%, 11 respectively, a clinically significant change would be approximately 2.5 mmol/L for sodium and 0.5 mmol/L for potassium. Therefore, intermediate interference changes within 2-3 times the biological variations would be most dangerous because such changes may be considered genuine, thereby affecting patient management.",

In the past, erroneously elevated capillary blood potassium concentration was always attributed to haemolysis or tissue injury caused by poor blood-sampling technique. Retrospectively, this may not have been the only interpretation, as some degree of interference from Hexol contamination may have been the contributing cause in some cases. Biochemical results that are incompatible with the clinical condition of the patient should prompt careful re-sampling by a different route or analysis by a different method if necessary. In the light of the results of this study, special care must be taken with regard to blood-sampling technique and the interpretation of spurious results. To minimise contamination of blood samples, the alcoholic hand rub should be allowed to dry completely before blood sampling. Health care workers should avoid rubbing or pressing the site where blood is to be sampled, or touching the tip of the capillary tube with contaminated fingers. The choice of hand disinfectant is also important. As shown, MAH gel causes significant interference even at low concentrations, takes longer to dry and is stickier than the other disinfectants, thus increasing the risk of contamination and subsequent analytical errors. Therefore, its use in the neonatal intensive care unit is not recommended. In fact, after reverting from MAH gel to the original brand of hand disinfectant, Hexol, we no longer observed such spurious sodium results.",
