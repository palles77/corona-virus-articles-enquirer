Abnormal clinical signs noted during the initial physical examination were hypothermia, dehydration, pale mucous membranes, tachypnea, and severe dyspnea. Thoracic radiographs revealed pleural effusion, an enlarged cardiac silhouette, and areas of lung consolidation. Both blood and thoracic fluid were hyperproteinemic and hypergammaglobulinemic. Antibiotic, corticosteroid, and diuretic supportive treatment provided temporary improvement. After the initial positive response to treatment, the ferret's condition progressively deteriorated until the owners decided to euthanize the patient 15 days after initial presentation. Gross necropsy results revealed 5 mL of serosanguinous fluid within the thoracic cavity, cardiomegaly, and consolidated lungs that had a patchy, pale golden tissue pattern. The histologic diagnosis was endogenous lipid pneumonia. Findings suggest that endogenous lipid pneumonia can be associated with severe respiratory disease in ferrets.",

            "text": "L ipid pneumonia is a pulmonary disease characterized by the accumulation of foamy macrophages in the pulmonary parenchyma; it is classified into 2 major groups depending on whether the oil/fat found in the respiratory tract has an endogenous (idiopathic, with accumulation of lipid material within the alveoli) or exogenous (aspiration, with accumulation of lipid material within alveolar spaces and interstitium) source. 1 Endogenous lipid pneumonia has been reported in rats, mice, cats, dogs, raccoons, and opossums, with single reports in a llama, brown bear, genet, and a blackfooted ferret. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] In most cases the underlying etiologic cause of endogenous lipid pneumonia has been classified as idiopathic, but can be associated with bacterial or parasitic infections, or the result of airway obstruction by exudative fluid/cellular debris, bronchoconstriction, tumors, or anomalous bron-chi. 1, 3, [5] [6] [7] 13 Endogenous lipid pneumonia has been rarely reported in domestic ferrets (Mustela putorius furo), [14] [15] [16] but appears to be a minor and common histologic finding at necropsy for many conditions that contribute to these animal's deaths (Carles Juan-Sall\u00e9s, DVM, Dip. ACVP, July 2007, personal communication). Lipid pneumonia is considered a rare pulmonary disease in humans; this is in part because there is no classical radiographic appearance or clinical signs associated with the disease and it is therefore able to imitate other lung diseases. 1 In domestic ferrets, as in other animal species, most cases of endogenous lipid pneumonia do not appear to have any clinical significance. 11, 12, 14 Case Report A 1-year-old, female domestic ferret weighing 693 g was presented depressed, weak, and with an acute onset of respiratory distress. The respiratory condition was first noticed by the owners 12 to 18 hours before presentation, and they were not sure if the animal had been eating or drinking at that time.",

The young male died at the age of 6.5 months and was diagnosed through a postmortem examination with ferret systemic coronaviral disease. The young female had a history of multiple illnesses post purchase, including coccidiosis, giardiasis, nematodiasis, chronic cough, and mesenteric lymphadenopathy. A serologic test for Aleutian disease (Quickcheck ADV; Avecon Diagnostics, Bath, PA USA), performed when the animal was 7 months of age, was negative.

The progression of the lipid pneumonia may have led to pathologic changes in the lung tissue that increased the intrapleural negative pressure, thereby producing fluid accumulation due to an increase in the hydrostatic pressure gradient. 18 In addition, those pulmonary changes may have induced cardiac enlargement and insufficiency, contributing to the pleural effusion. Pathologic changes in the heart associated with lipid pneumonia have been described in humans. 19 In this case, lipid pneumonia was believed to be the major cause of respiratory failure. Although pleural effusion was noted, it has been reported in dogs and cats that 30 to 60 mL/kg of pleural effusion are required to produce respiratory compromise in the absence of parenchymal disease. 20 In the present case, less than 8 mL/kg of fluid were recovered from the thoracic cavity at necropsy.
