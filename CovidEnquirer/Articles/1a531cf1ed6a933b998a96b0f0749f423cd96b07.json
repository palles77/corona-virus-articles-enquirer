They may choose to specialize in civil aviation, military aviation, or space flight. They might work for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, a commercial or corporate airline, the Department of Transportation, an aerospace manufacturer, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or in private practice. Practitioners may choose to focus on medical research, they may teach, or they may consult on a variety of preventive, workplace safety, and environmental programs 3, 4 or on aerospace health care system development.",

            "text": "Aerospace medicine and emergency medicine are complementary specialties, for several reasons. Each requires the evaluation and stabilization of patients in a less than perfectly controlled environment. Training for mass casualty incidents serves as preparation for airline crashes, 5 and disaster medicine training, along with out-of-hospital care and toxicology, contributes to the preparation for manned space flight. 6 The variety of clinical problems encountered in aerospace medicine overlaps with emergency medicine, ranging from treatment of multiple trauma patients after an airline accident 5 to running a medical clinic for aircrew, 7 which may mirror some of what is seen in the minor area of an emergency department. In addition, the problem-solving and teamwork skills that are inherent to emergency medicine are also basic tenets of astronautics. 8 The daily practice of a physician in aerospace medicine depends on his or her area of expertise. A medical consultant for a major airline, for example, will oversee the health of the pilots, flight attendants, and ground staff. He or she is likely to run daily clinics to manage the medical problems of the airline crew, such as barotrauma, occupational injuries (back pain is a common complaint), and return to work assignment. The consultant is usually a trained aviation medical examiner (AME) and, as such, gives out the pilot medical certificates from the Federal Aviation Administration, the Canadian Civil Aviation, or the United Kingdom Civil perhaps the plane will be unable to land because of weather conditions. There is little routine, and by flying full-time, there is a risk of becoming physically exhausted. 10, 11 In addition, teamwork is ubiquitous in aerospace medicine: one is likely to take part in several committees, and if one is a flight physician, one works in a confined environment with a medical team (ie, a respiratory therapist, a nurse, paramedics), often for many hours at a time. If you like to work alone, this may be a drawback.",
