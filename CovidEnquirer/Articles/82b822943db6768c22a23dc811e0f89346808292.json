They are caused by a wide range of viruses that are generally divided into influenza and non-influenza illnesses, the latter usually being referred to simply as the 'common cold', the most common human viral affliction (Eccles, 2005) . Common colds and 'flus share common symptoms including sore throat, cough, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea. Generally, viral transmission is via contaminated surfaces or aerosols of viral particles (Fiore et al., 2011; Turner, 2007; Turner et al., 2007; Eccles, 2007) and, although variable in terms of pathogenesis, epidemiology and temporal appearance, their manifestations are similar. Most cases of URVIs are self-limiting, causing minor illness before the patient fully recovers.",

Viral pathogens primarily responsible for the common cold are Picornaviridae (mostly rhinoviruses), Coronaviridae, and Adenoviridae. (Turner, 2007; Turner et al., 2007) . Human rhinovirus (HRV) infection accounts for around 50% of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations, occasionally leading to serious complications, such as pneumonia (Tan et al., 2003) . Currently, no approved vaccines or direct-acting antivirals exist for the prevention or treatment of rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus or the other etiologic agents of the common cold, and available medications can only provide symptomatic relief (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases). Regarding influenza, in addition to the seasonal influenza vaccine, there are approved antiviral treatments (e.g. oseltamivir), although each has notable limitations.",

            "text": "During a typical URVI, the virus enters the nasal epithelium and replicates rapidly, spreading throughout the upper respiratory system within 24-72 h. As the viral proteins and virus particles appear on the surface of the epithelial cells, the adaptive immune system begins the process of selecting and expanding the T-and B-cells necessary to eliminate the infected epithelial cells and block re-infection by free virus (via neutralizing antibodies), respectively. The innate immune response acts rapidly as a first-line defence to prevent viral invasion or replication before protection by the adaptive immune system occurs. In the cellular innate immune response, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are engaged to detect specific viral components, such as viral RNA or DNA, or viral replication intermediates. In the case of URVIs, caused mostly by RNA viruses or involving double-stranded RNA intermediates, the key PRRs are Toll-like Receptor 3 (TLR3) and two Riglike helicases, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and Melanoma Differentiation-Associated protein 5 (MDA-5) (Pichlmair et al., 2009) . Once activated, the PRRs precipitate a cascade of signalling events leading to a pleiotropic response that inhibits viral replication within the cell (Thompson et al., 2011) , signals neighbouring cells rendering them refractory to viral invasion (Takeuchi and Akira, 2010) , and enhances migration of immune system cells into the area (Koyama et al., 2008; Mogensen, 2009; Slater et al., 2010) . Once the infection has been cleared, T-and B-cells provide a 'memory' of the infection, which confers immunity to the specific virus lasting years.",

            "text": "PrEP-001, or Poly I:C, is a well-established synthetic doublestranded RNA that acts as a viral genome surrogate and activates the antiviral response of the cellular innate immune system by stimulating the PRRs Rig-1, MDA-5, and TLR3 (Caskey et al., 2011; Mian et al., 2013) . It is a potent immunomodulating agent whose mechanism of action is well characterized (Wong et al., 1995) . Upon entering the cell, Poly I:C activates the expression of a number of gene products that renders the host cell refractory to viral replication (Kumar et al., 2006) , releases cytokines and chemokines which act in a paracrine fashion to activate the antiviral response in adjacent cells and recruits cells of the adaptive immune system into the area (Kawai and Akira, 2010; Savan, 2014) . The prophylactic potential of Poly I:C has been demonstrated using multiple viruses in cell culture (Pan et al., 2012) , animal models (Wong et al., 1995) , and clinical trials (Lee et al., 2014) , however, pharmaceutically useful formulations for nasal application were unavailable.",

            "text": "PrEP-001 Nasal Powder is a proprietary formulation of poly I and poly C that protects the RNA from degradation by ubiquitous RNAses and enhances its retention in the nose and uptake by nasal epithelial cells, as demonstrated by early in-house animal studies. Applied to the nasal cavity, PrEP-001 Nasal Powder adheres to the mucosa allowing the particles to be pynocytosed into nasal epithelial cells where PrEP-001 activates the innate immune response. As a high molecular weight polymer, PrEP-001 remains in the cell and does not enter systemic circulation (DeVincenzo et al., 2008) . Within the cell, like all RNAs, it is rapidly degraded into mononucleosides and immediately recycled via cellular nucleoside pools into new cellular RNA molecules (de Clercq, 1979; Nordlund et al., 1970) . Consequently, there is no liver burden or potential for hepatic drug-drug interactions, and primary pharmacological effects are localized to the area of application. Finally, as a synthetic, non-coding, non-replicating RNA polymer, there is no risk of unintended amplification (as with an attenuated virus), nor the possibility of protein production that potentially could lead to sensitization upon repeated administration. Taken together, this gives PrEP-001 the appropriate profile for use as a topical prophylactic agent against URVIs. As anticipated by the nature of PrEP-001 itself, and supported by toxicology and initial first-in-human safety studies, PrEP-001 has the exceptionally safe profile suitable for prophylaxis of the common cold. Based on pre-clinical results, an initial rhinovirus challenge study was conducted. This study was identical to the studies outlined in this paper, however only a single dose was administered 24 h pre-inoculation. Total symptom scores were marginally reduced compared with placebo.",

Results from both studies demonstrated a strong prophylactic effect after repeated dosing of PrEP-001 in healthy subjects challenged with either HRV-A16 or H3N2-IAV, with symptom scores, duration of symptoms, mucus production, and viral shedding all being reduced. These findings are significant because PrEP-001 demonstrated effectiveness against two strains of respiratory viruses with different structures, i.e. enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, with different types of RNA genomes and replication schemes, and therefore supports its potential as a pan-viral prophylaxis agent. Furthermore, the percentage of volunteers with study-defined laboratory confirmed illness was reduced by 3-fold in Study 1 and 2-fold in Study 2. It is noteworthy that even those subjects with the most severe symptom scores showed a significant comparative improvement after PrEP-001 treatment (p = 0.03). Seroconversion rates were comparable, suggesting use of PrEP-001 would not prevent the generation of protective long-term memory responses to specific viruses. Finally, PrEP-001 was well-tolerated with no clinically significant AEs observed in either study. However, it is important to acknowledge limitations to the studies since both were small (sample size of approximately 50 subjects per study) and were also conducted under highly controlled conditions (i.e. inoculation timed 24 h after prophylaxis), so further larger scale studies are needed to confirm efficacy and safety in 'real world' settings.",

(Gubareva et al., 2000) . Although larger, long-term studies have yet to be conducted with PrEP-001, its mechanism of action (i.e. activation of the pleotropic innate immune response), make it unlikely to select for simple resistant variants of influenza or any other upper respiratory virus. Likewise, without longer-term trials it is impossible to predict if there will be toxicity issues with extended administration, however these potential side-effects would undoubtedly be local due to the lack of systemic exposure. Finally, there remains the possibility that long-term exposure may result in tachyphylaxis due to a local down-regulation of the innate response in the nasal lining but this will only become apparent in longterm studies.",

This supports further evaluation of PrEP-001 as a potential pan-viral prophylaxis for upper respiratory viral infections and may be a novel strategy to improve HRV and influenza control, especially for high-risk populations, such as the elderly and those with underlying respiratory conditions (e.g. asthma and COPD), for whom URVIs present a serious concern.",
