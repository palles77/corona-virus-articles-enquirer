For example, children can be repeatedly infected with RSV, although subsequent illnesses are usually less severe than the primary infection. 12 Complete recovery from and clearance of these viral infections are likely mediated by virus-specific cellular mechanisms. 13, 14 HIV-infected individuals have deficiencies in both humoral and cellular defenses. Therefore, infection by common respiratory viruses may present differently in this population than in immunocompetent individuals. Since most adults with HIV disease acquired their infection as adults or adolescents, they probably have experienced infections by most of the common respiratory viruses and thus have some preexisting immunity. For this reason, respiratory viral infections may be a greater clinical problem in HIVinfected infants and children, who may not have preexisting immunity to these pathogens. Clearance of respiratory viruses is likely to depend on cellular immune mechanisms, and HIV-infected individuals are at theoretical risk for prolonged infections caused by these viruses.",
