The analyte migrates up the support by capillarity, along with the appropriately-conjugated antibodies, up to a test zone where another antibody immobilizes the complex. A second antibody binds to the analyte, which is then sandwiched between the 2 antibodies. The conjugated antibody that did not initially bind to the analyte continues migrating up to a third antibody that binds it within a control zone. To detect the complex that is formed with the analytes, the first antibody is usually bound to markers such as colloidal gold particles, colored latex, or selenium, depending on the kind of detector used. As a result, qualitative or quantitative measures are typically obtained within 15 min.",

A similar approach was used by Meagher et al 9 who designed a portable device for the detection of biotoxins. Their quick (less than 20 min) microfluidic chipbased immunoassay was tested in ricin, Shiga toxin I, and Staphylococcal enterotixin B (SEB). The limit of detection for SEB was 300 pM, which was reduced to 10 pM when adding a pre-concentration step on the chip.

As a result, research or commercial 11 applications often include complex microfluidic systems. These systems contain microcapillaries that allow the flow of very small liquid volumes. Plasma can separate from the blood sample through a filter and reach the reaction chamber, where it meets fluorescent antibodies. The analytes are detected as antigen-antibody complexes, which move toward an antibody array where they are distributed according to different capture antibodies. The concentration of each analyte is measured from the F\u20ac orster resonance energy transfer (FRET) fluorescence, in which fluorescence results from a distance-dependent interaction between an electron donor and an acceptor, with excitation wavelengths close to infra-red, as appropriate for plasma and serum samples. 12, 13 A clinical evaluation of this type of system was carried out with a commercial device, which incorporated 4 biomarkers related to brain ischemia (matrix metalloproteinase 9, D-dimer, S100b, and B-type natriuretic peptide) to evaluate the existence of a stroke in patients who showed related neurological symptoms. 14 Authors concluded that although the diagnosis was not perfect with these tests (the area under the receiver-operatingcharacteristic curve was 0.76 for hemorrhagic stroke and 0.69 for all strokes): they do aid in forming a diagnostic picture when they are applied together with other tests.",

In addition to raw serum, microcapillary systems allow for the use of diluted serum and cerebrospinal fluid in the detection of CRP within 10 min. 16 The use of microcapillary arrangements has driven some researchers to use polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as an elastomeric support. PDMS is a soft organic silicon polymer that is widely used for cheap microfluidic devices, and some of these supports contain multiple channels. Gervais et al 17 designed a capillary-driven microfluidic chip built on PDMS, which was capable of analyzing CRP from human serum using a fluorescence microscope. This method allowed the detection of 10 ng/mL of CRP in serum in a single step within less than 3 min. For smaller sample amounts, this device had a capillary pump that permitted slower sample speed. In this way, a 1 ng/mL concentration was detected by slowing the detection process to 14 min.",

            "text": "Isothermal amplification. In spite of attempts aimed at increasing detection signal, given the availability of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), amplification of DNA is still a useful strategy. However, even with the high sensitivity and specificity of PCR-based methods, they have drawbacks such as the dependence on a thermocycler, which can increase the cost and complexity of miniaturized portable devices. As a result, different strategies have been proposed to amplify samples without using a thermocycler. One of these strategies is the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) of DNA. 50 This technique relies on strand displacement by a DNA polymerase and on the appropriate design of primers (4 primers that can bind in 6 distinct sequences) to amplify target sequences at a constant temperature (60 C) with high selectivity. Based on this principle, Bearinger et al 51 developed a prototype of a small device capable of analyzing swab-collected samples in 90 min. They could detect 17 copies of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) genomic DNA and foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) from an epithelial homogenate in100 mL of reaction volume. They used a simple colorimetric detection system based on the detection of free Mg 12 . The method is based on the principle that the concentration of this ion diminishes as it binds to the pyrophosphate that is released in the amplification reaction. The versatility of this method also permits applications that use reverse transcription. 52 Fang et al 53 also used a LAMP system, but in this case, they developed a multiplex gene assay using a microfluidic set-up with 10 microchambers connected to 1 microchannel per chamber. The microchannels had low mass-transfer coefficients to prevent cross contamination among different microchambers and, in addition to the direct visualization by the white precipitate formed by Mg 12 and pyrophosphate, they added a fluorescent dye to obtain the positive signal. They called this system mmLAMP (multiplex microfluidic LAMP), and it allowed them to detect as few as 10 copies/mL of the target sequence in 2 mL quantities of sample within 30 min. In this study, they used flu viruses to test the device, and they were able to detect the seasonal influenza A H1N1 virus from clinical samples. Another example for the amplification of target nucleic acid sequences without thermocyclers was developed by Andresen et al 54 based on helicase dependent amplification (HDA), where a helicase carried out strand separation. They achieved specificity by carrying out the amplification reaction at 65 C with a combination of thermophilic helicase and polymerase enzymes. These authors used labeled primers to detect amplified sequences from genomic DNA of laboratory preparations of N. gonorrhoeae and S. aureus.",

Using this principle in miniaturized lateral flow chromatography devices, Carter et al 56 detected RNA from pathogens such as Bacillus anthracis in 10 mL volumes, achieving subfemtomole limit of detection. They could detect RNA from as few as 2 B. anthracis cells within 120 s after sample preparation and amplification. In this case, they carried out the detection of laboratory preparations of the bacillus by hybridizing them to oligonucleotides attached to dyed microspheres.

One of these methods involves the use of heat shock proteins (HSP). More specifically, Javier et al 57 developed this strategy to detect mRNA targets derived from Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts using oligonucleotide-gold nanoparticles. By incubating the oocysts at 42 C for 20 min, they induced the synthesis of the mRNA for HSPs and they purified them with magnetic beads that were coupled with oligo-dT. They detected the mRNA for HSP70 using gold nanoparticles coupled with oligonucleotides specific to their target mRNA. These gold nanoparticles facilitate the formation of aggregates in the presence of the target mRNA, and they can be detected by simple colorimetric changes in to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR). This detection method is based on the distortion that adsorbed analytes produce on measurable electron oscillations on the surface of the gold particle, and it is common among lab-on-a-chip microdetection devices. The use of HSP mRNA is a clever way of achieving nucleic acid amplification with low material requirements. However, oocysts need to be alive so that they can respond to the heat shock, a factor that must be taken into account for future applications and extensions of this method.",

Since its introduction in 1996 as a method for the analysis of nucleic acids, 59 nanopore technology has experienced substantial progress to the point where it is currently possible to obtain sequence information on single nucleic acid molecules 60 as well as on complexes formed by nucleic acids and proteins. [60] [61] [62] [63] These analyses are based on the principle that nucleic acids go through nanoscopic pores by electrophoresis. The dimensions of these pores are such that when nucleic acids go through, they cover most of the pore area. The aqueous buffer in which the pore is immersed contains ions that produce a measurable electric current. When the nucleic acids traverse the pore, a blockade in the current can be detected and, on average, this blockade has different properties depending on the specific characteristics (including base sequence) of the analyte that is going through. Nucleic acids are driven to the pore by the electric voltage as soon as they are added to the detection solution and the measurements can be carried out within 5 min for a single nucleic acid sample. Given these properties, it is likely that this technology can be used for sequencing applications in the near future.",

Thus, some researchers are working to combine the best features of both types of nanopores by coating the metallic surface of solid nanopores with lipids. 65 This sequencing approach has great potential to develop POC sequencing instruments due to the small dimensions of the pore and the small analyte amounts required.",

They concluded that PCR chips, which are mostly made using MEMS, have the advantage of their compact size, low sample volume (in the nanoliter range), and their short analysis time (which can be as short as 10 s per PCR cycle and 370 s for the whole quantification process).
