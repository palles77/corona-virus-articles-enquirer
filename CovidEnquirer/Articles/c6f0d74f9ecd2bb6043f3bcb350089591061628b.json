He is particularly interested in identifying commonalities among unrelated viruses. Luis' group works with a number of established human pathogens, including herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 (HSV-1; -2), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and influenza A virus (IAV), and emerging viruses such as Zika virus. With the research team, Luis identifies or designs small molecules that inhibit the infectivity or replication of a variety of unrelated viruses and then uses these compounds as probes to identify commonalities among the affected viruses. This research answers fundamental questions on molecular virology while identifying biologically active small molecule scaffolds that may be developed as antivirals. Using this approach, his group has identified new families of compounds with antiviral activity against multiple unrelated viruses (broadspectrum antiviral activity), as well as some compounds that act exclusively against single viruses.",

He established his first independent research laboratory at James Cook University (Australia) when he was appointed as a lecturer in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (1993) and rose through the ranks to become a Reader (~Assoc. Professor). It was during this period that he started working on dengue virus focusing mainly on the NS3 and NS5 proteins. In 2003, he moved to Singapore as the inaugural Unit Head of the Dengue Research Unit at the newly established Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases and led an intensive effort to find directly acting antivirals against dengue virus serotypes. In 2008, he was recruited to the Signature Research Program in Emerging Infectious Diseases at the Duke-National University of Singapore Medical School where he currently pursues his research interests in dengue and Zika pathogenesis and antiviral drug discovery and development. He was appointed as an Editor of Antiviral Research (Elsevier) in 2009 and is a member of the Editorial Board of the Journal of Virology (2017-2021).",

The main response to the Spanish flu consisted in non-pharmaceutical interventions such as school closings, restrictions on large gatherings, and isolation and quarantine. In the first decades of the 20 th century, there was no healthcare notion. Many people had no access to doctors who either worked for themselves or were funded by charities or religious institutions.",

On the centenary of the 1918 pandemic, it is pertinent to wonder whether the world would be prepared for such an event. Unfortunately, we are not fully prepared to face a new influenza pandemic. First, we do not know which influenza virus will cause the next pandemic. Due to increase mobility, the virus can rapidly spread and today there is no way to develop promptly an effective vaccine against a pandemic virus. Further, differences in quality of health systems impede a prompt global response, and major gaps exist regarding surveillance data on emergence of influenza virus.",

Sanarelli (1) . Infected animals exhibit multiple skin lesions characterized by tumour-like growths and die within 10 days of infection. Modern investigations have subsequently noted the high viremia, and death is often caused by the secondary infections arising from the profound immune suppression in infected animals.

Briefly, in 1859 a shipment of 24 rabbits was released on an estate near the southeast tip of Australia and within the space of only a few decades, and in a stunning illustration of exponential population growth, succeeded in crossing the continent at a rate estimated at ~70 miles/year. The idea that these animals might be controlled with MYXV was first floated in 1919, but it would take a series of on-and-off again trials and government reviews before the disease finally gained a permanent foothold as a zoonotic infection of Australian rabbits in the early 1950's. These trials served an important role in demonstrating MYXV's limited host range, and also the critical importance of ecological factors such as rainfall and insect vectors in spreading the disease. At around the same time (1952) the disease was introduced into Europe and has since established a permanent presence there as well.",

Again, the interested reader can find a detailed description in Fenner and Ratcliffe (8) . The virus released in 1950-51 spread rapidly, crossing the continent westward in only three years. One of the most important observations was that highly pathogenic MYXV strains had a strong tendency to die out, replaced by attenuated strains. For example the standard Australian laboratory strain produced a casemortality rate of >99%, but within just 2-3 years in the field, this had been reduced to 50-70% in circulating MYXV strains (8) . At the same time, it was also observed that the wild populations of rabbits were rapidly evolving resistance. The KM13 strain of MYXV was used to infect non-immune rabbits captured after each of a series of repeated epizootics. This strain produced ~90% mortality among rabbits captured at the beginning of the project, but by year seven this had been reduced to ~30% (9).

Public sensitivity to the release of genetically modified organisms has meant that few of these plans have yet to come to fruition. During this period a collective understanding also began to emerge concerning the operations of cellular innate immune signalling networks.

Cancer cells accumulate mutations that can disable these pathways and this plays a key role in helping tumours evade immune surveillance. For example, mutations that alter the expression of the apoptotic regulator Bcl-2 inhibit apoptosis and can thus block T-cell induced killing. Since many of these same systems provide defense against viruses, an important consequence is that viruses that would not infect non-transformed cells can sometimes infect cancer cells. This is the principle behind oncolytic virus technology. Peter Forsyth's laboratory was the first to illustrate the oncolytic potential of MYXV in vivo, by demonstrating its capacity to eradicate glioblastoma tumours in a xenografted mouse model (29) . More recently MYXV-based virotherapies have shown particular promise for treating blood malignancies when used in conjunction with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplants in mouse models (30) . These procedures are hazarded by the risk of graft versus host disease, but MYXV treatment can control this when dormant viruses gain an opportunity to replicate in and disable activating T-cells. These same activated T-cells can deliver a virus payload to target cells, thus also killing any residual myeloma cells. Recent reviews summarize this exciting and still growing oncolytic virus literature [e.g. (31) (32) (33) ].",

            "text": "This commentary began by summarizing the history of Australia's grand biological experiment and it seems only appropriate to conclude on the same note. In the last few years, Peter Kerr and his colleagues have used next generation sequencing technologies to determine the sequence of 30 Australian and 11 British MYXV strains (34-35). These studies have provided detailed insights into the evolutionary trajectories followed by different wild strains, including the propensity to accumulate gene duplications and deletions. Rather surprisingly, it has proven difficult to link specific mutations to changes in virulence, suggesting that the single-gene knockouts that are studied in the laboratory may not be reflective of the disease in the wild (36). Interestingly, when the disease phenotype is compared between modern and archived strains, modern strains seem to have reversed the trend towards attenuation seen in the 1950's. These viruses are more virulent and cause a different disease in laboratory rabbits called immune acute collapse and resembling in some ways septic shock syndrome (37). A similar disease called amyxomatous myxomatosis had been previously described in Europe, which like the Australian strains do not form the cutaneous lesions seen in classical infections in laboratory animals (38). Kerr et al. propose the attractive hypothesis that this phenotype reflects a way in which MYXV has adapted to maintain transmission in the face of enhanced host resistance to infection. However, although all of these viruses have been sequenced, there's no obvious genetic signature that would explain the altered disease phenotype. Clearly, we still have a lot more to learn about myxoma virus. Alfred Crosby, who wrote a pioneering book about the Spanish Influenza, concluded that the \"physicians of 1918 were participants in the greatest failure of medical science in the 20 th Century, and, if absolute numbers of dead are the measure, of all time\" (1). But viewing the outbreak, which killed as many as 100 million and caused serious illness in another 300 million (2, 3), a century later, the scientific response looks less bleak. Remarkably individual scientists in the UK and USA produced their own batches of bacterial vaccines to prevent serious pneumonia and death (4, 5) . Also local outbreaks, particularly in the USA, introduced layered public health approaches of social distancing, cotton masks, hygiene and school closure in some cities to the benefit of their citizens (6) . Local doctors used passive antibody taken from patients who had recovered, and others desperately set up tents where patients were treated with steam, oxygen and eucalyptus (4) . Rather the failures were more the result of poor medical infrastructure and leadership to combat epidemics in many countries of the world, including England.",

However, there were continuing small numbers of cases of typhoid, paratyphoid, respiratory infection and cerebrospinal fever and even smallpox. But suddenly in December 1916 and during the ensuing months, an influenza like illness called Purulent Bronchitis (7, 8) . The pathologists at Etaples, (8) (9) (10) having isolated pneumococcus and streptococcus from many of the victims of the disease there, began to formulate a complex vaccine. They grew streptococcus, pneumococcus and the controversial B.influenzae (Pfeiffer's bacillus) bacterium on agar, suspended them to about 200 million organisms per millimetre and heat-treated them at 55 0 C for 30 minutes. They added preservative and bottled up the 'new vaccine' in small vials ready for injection into soldiers. Is it quite remarkable that small groups of researchers could take this initiative? Of course, the technology of bacterial vaccine production on a small scale, say 200,000 doses, is technically quite simple. By taking some elementary precautions (such as the preparation of a 'clean room' free of other bacteria), a vaccine could be made -even in a 'field laboratory' in a wooden shed, such as that used by Dr Hammond at Etaples (4).",

We presume that there were no cases in the civilian countryside around Etaples at that time but unfortunately, the medical records have been destroyed by the passage of time. The world would react differently now, armed as it is with new knowledge and hindsight! A virologist or pathologist today would fit together the scenario of an emerging influenza pandemic using China as a current model.

In the LD50 assay, in a particular dilution (virus concentration), 50% animal will die whereas 50% of the animal will remain live. Many times, we may encounter the question from students asking why does the virus needs to be measured in terms of median dose and not by other values. The detailed statistical explanation for the selection of median rather than mean or mode can be found in the classical literatures (2, 3) . In brief, virus titer can be measured in other units such as 10% and 90% or 25% and 75% infectivity but the error rate will be more at these values compared to 50% (2).",

Further, reducing the dose range is possible as this method required just above and below 50% values for measuring median dose. Initially, this method has been used for the endpoint estimate at the Yellow Fever Laboratory at the Rockefeller Foundation. Later, the Reed and Muench duo simplified this method. In the Reed-Muench original article, they explained the method for calculation of protective serum. When it is applied to the virus titration, the formula needs to be modified accordingly. Because of this, many authors quoting the formulas in different ways especially in using +/symbol for dilution and dilution factor. The following formula is taken from (22) as it is simple and clear.",

Coxsackieviruses in group A (CVA) produce a myositis-based flaccid hind limb paralysis while those in group B (CVB) produce a spastic paralysis and more generalized infection in newborn mice (3) . Members of the CVB family have been observed to cause damage to the heart, brain, pancreas and fat tissue of newborn mice (4) .

ICAM-1 normally functions in the process of extravasation of neutrophils into surrounding tissues (16) . The v vitronectin receptor has been shown to allow infection of CVA9 in green monkey kidney cells (17) . It is an integrin expressed by platelets, bone reabsorbing cells, and osteoclasts that mediates cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (18) . Decay-accelerating factor (DAF, also known as CD55) has been shown to be important for CVA21, CVB1, CVB3, and CVB5 (19, 20) . DAF is a widespread regulatory membrane protein responsible for dissociation of the complement pathway (21) . Studies have shown that insertion of the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) will render nonpermissive cells susceptible to infection by CVB (22) . CAR normally functions as a cell adhesion molecule and may have a role in scaffolding (23) . Heparan sulfate has also been shown to aid in CVB3 infection in cells lacking CAR and DAF (24) . The exact role of each of these receptors is a focus of ongoing research and the receptors specific to each CV may influence tissue tropism and pathogenesis (25) .",

At that time, there was a consensus to designate such groups as two variants of the same species: HHV-6A and HHV-6B, based on two main factors: a) the interspecies divergence of nucleic acids was low and (ii) there was a partial knowledge of differences on their epidemiology and pathogenic potential (4). However, based on subsequent research on the biology and pathogenic mechanisms of HHV-6A and HHV-6B viruses in the next years, several authors began to suggest that the two variants should be recognized as distinct viruses (4) . In 2012, the herpesvirus subcommittee of an international taxonomy group proposed that the two HHV-6 variants should be formally recognized as distinct viruses. Several epidemiological, biological and immunological differences between HHV-6A and HHV-6B have been outlined and scientists and clinicians were urged to differentiate between these two viruses when possible for clarity in biological and clinical distinctions between them (4).",

Two recent papers in Neuron provide new evidences of a link between herpesviruses and AD. Using transgenic AD mice that express human amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u00df) and 3D human neural cell culture, Eimer and colleagues (19) demonstrated that infection with HHV-6A, HHV-6B or HSV-1 dramatically accelerated the deposition of A\u00df peptide. A\u03b2 oligomers were shown to bind herpesvirus surface glycoproteins, accelerating \u03b2-amyloid deposition and leading to protective viral entrapment activity in 5XFAD mouse and 3D human neural cell culture infection models. This protective viral entrapment of the reactivated pathogens prevents these viruses from infecting other brain cells. However, this 'protective' effect leads to the formation of A\u03b2 fibrils and then A\u03b2 plaques (a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease).",

The researchers also found higher levels of HHV-6A (and HSV-2) DNA, pointing to active viral replication in AD brain. Moreover, the presence of HHV-6A and HHV-7 proved to be significantly associated with severity of dementia and brain pathology. It should be noted that, HHV-6 and HHV-7, similarly to HSV-1 and HSV-2, are well-known causes of viral encephalitis, in particular in immunocompromised individuals, and have also been linked to demyelinating brain disease.

This discovery of RNA-mediated regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level won its discoverers Andrew Fire and Craig Mello the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology. Key components of the RNAi mechanism are well-conserved among different kingdoms, from plants to animals. In mammals, the RNAi mechanism constitutes an additional level of regulated gene expression performed by a large set of regulatory small double-stranded microRNAs (miRNA). These miRNAs mature with the help of the cellular endonucleases, Drosha and Dicer, and subsequently interact with the Argonaute protein as the key mRNA-slicer component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC).",

RNA silencing, which uses the cellular RNAi components for function, plays an important role in mediating cellular defence against infection by plant viruses. Plants defective in RNA silencing/RNAi are more susceptible to infection by viral pathogens (3) . Plant viruses in turn have evolved potent anti-RNAi mechanisms by expression of proteins or transcripts with RNAi-suppressor activity (4, 5) . The importance and conservation of the RNAi antiviral response is underscored by the observation of trans-kingdom suppression with a human viral protein in plants and vice versa (6, 7) . RNAi is also a major antiviral mechanism in insects like Drosophila melanogaster (8), but it remained uncertain for quite some time if it executed a similar function in higher eukaryotes (9) . As said, the complete machinery is present in mammalian cells to execute the critical miRNA program.",

Virulent virus strains encode potent RNAi suppressors that mask the siRNA signature and a 10-fold higher siRNA level is scored in undifferentiated pluripotent cells that express less interferon. The masking effect was confirmed in a recent study on the human enterovirus 71 by comparing the wild-type virus to a mutant lacking the 3A suppressor protein (13) . This mutant showed a severe replication deficiency that could be overcome by Dicer-deficiency. To exclude an interferon effect, Qiu et al. used mouse cells lacking a functional interferon receptor and drug that specifically blocks this pathway (13) . Thus, mammals seem to have developed at least three antiviral mechanisms: RNAi in undifferentiated cells on top of the innate and adaptive immune systems. Recent evidence indicates that invertebrates have also evolved multiple antiviral pathways (14) , yet plants seem to rely exclusively on the RNAi mechanism.",

RNA viruses and the transcripts of DNA viruses can be targeted, but one could also consider inhibition of critical cellular cofactors. One could address acute and persistent infections, e.g. caused by the respiratory syncytial virus or human immunodeficiency virus (15, 16) . Because the attack is sequence-specific, one can expect viral escape to occur by selection of a single point mutation, and this was indeed observed in prolonged HIV culture experiments.

Regarding the biophysical conditions as climate conditions, and natural and built environment, a barrier underlined was the unpredictable occurrence of outbreaks due to the climate change. Main barriers identified within the Health System were the lack of material resources and capable personnel; that public health priorities are hardly ever included in vector control, programs discontinuity, lack of preventable initiatives and lack of budget allocation. Other factors different from health with a great impact in prevention deal with garbage collection, education or built environment, and traditionally do not prioritize public health problems and also may lack of resources. Governance level barriers relate to discontinuity of programs, lack of budget allocation, the absence of effective functional link between political decisions and experts' recommendations, and lack of programmatic coordination with local government. At community level, the lack of information and education conspires against the risk perception and awareness; moreover, there is a perceived reluctance to implement preventive actions.

Thus raised, this dialogue between decision makers and experts was translated into two main priorities for the region: strategies for vector control and a research agenda, which allows for pooling efforts, enhancing capacities, orienting resources towards these intervention, and research priorities. The participants, as well as the representatives of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), welcomed this initiative and undertook to follow up on the proposals that emerged, as well as, where possible, establish a network of collaboration and active communication to facilitate the objective. Zika virus (ZIKV) was first isolated in 1947 in Uganda and has been circulating in human populations from West Africa and Asia since the mid-1950s. Little attention was devoted to ZIKV, probably due to the mildness of its symptoms and the fact that it was geographically restricted, being a neglected disease for most of its history. However, this started to change in 2013 when the landing of ZIKV in French Polynesia was associated with increased rates of Guillain-Barre syndrome, an autoimmune condition that affects the peripheral nervous system and can be triggered by infections (1; 2).",

The mechanism by which ZIKV crosses the placenta is still unclear, but its neurotropism and ability to destroy neural cells have been clearly demonstrated. ZIKV infection induces abnormal mitosis and apoptosis of human neural progenitor cells (NPCs), causing disruptive lesions in the fetal central nervous system (CNS). NPCs are the primary target of the ZIKV, and this may partly explain the high number of abnormalities seen in the CNS and detected by neuroimaging examinations (4) . However, microcephaly is just one of the many ZIKV-related birth complications, now referred to as congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). About 20% of the children born with CZS have normal head sizes, and children born without any abnormality were later found to have developed brain damage and developmental problems. Evidence is now accumulating that subtle, but destructive brain, ear and ocular injuries can also occur in infants with a normal head size at birth. The expanding range of anomalies may be difficult or impossible to diagnose prenatally, and there remains uncertainty about the long-term neurocognitive effects of ZIKV exposure. In addition, ZIKV infections during any trimester of pregnancy may result in CZS, even if asymptomatic. At present, ZIKV is considered a new member of the teratogenic congenital infections (5; 6).",

Dengue virus, for example, is endemic in South America, and its seroprevalence is found in more than 90% of the population within CSZ cluster regions. It is known that after initial infection with dengue virus, posterior exposures to other dengue serotypes could result in life-threatening complications due to the phenomenon known as antibody-dependent enhancement. Antibodies do protect against infection with the same serotype but not when infected with any one of the other three serotypes. The antibody-dependent enhancement phenomenon describes a process in which antibodies generated during the first infection bind to the new virus but fail to efficiently neutralize it. Instead, the phenomenon facilitates virus entry to target cells. Since ZIKV is structurally close to dengue virus, several studies have examined their crossreactivity. The studies demonstrated, that antibodies generated after initial dengue infection, bind with high levels of affinity to ZIKV, significantly enhancing pathogenesis and ultimately failing to counteract the virus. The mechanism for this viral enhancement is thought to be mediated by immunoglobulin G engagement of Fc gamma receptors (Fc\u03b3R), in agreement with other antibody-dependent enhancement examples.",

Therefore, I chose a thesis on drug synthesis, COX-2 inhibitors. That's where everything started. When talking with colleagues and friends, they said often to me \"I think you could be happy doing that\". However, travelling so far, meeting face-to-face other scientists showed me that a good network of collaborations with people known personally could allow good science to be performed and reach good results. In addition, it is always good to know that there is the possibility to ask or even to move to perform experiments complementary to the work done in the home lab. For example, recently I have been at IrsiCaixa in Badalona, where I found a friendly team, and I did and learnt a lot. To be abroad for a definite project pushed me to work really hard to get all my work done in the limited amount of time I had.
