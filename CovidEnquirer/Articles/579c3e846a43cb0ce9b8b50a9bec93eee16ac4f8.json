            "text": "Clinical detection of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in patients is achieved using genetic diagnostic methods, such as real-time RT-PCR assay. Previously, we developed a reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for the detection of MERS-CoV [Virol J. 2014. 11:139]. Generally, amplification of RT-LAMP is monitored by the turbidity induced by precipitation of magnesium pyrophosphate with newly synthesized DNA. However, this mechanism cannot completely exclude the possibility of unexpected reactions. Therefore, in this study, fluorescent RT-LAMP assays using quenching probes (QProbes) were developed specifically to monitor only primer-derived signals. Two primer sets (targeting nucleocapsid and ORF1a sequences) were constructed to confirm MERS cases by RT-LAMP assay only. Our data indicate that both primer sets were capable of detecting MERS-CoV RNA to the same level as existing genetic diagnostic methods, and that both were highly specific with no cross-reactivity observed with other respiratory viruses. These primer sets were highly efficient in amplifying target sequences derived from different MERS-CoV strains, including camel MERS-CoV. In addition, the detection efficacy of QProbe RT-LAMP was comparable to that of real-time RT-PCR assay using clinical specimens from patients in Saudi Arabia. Altogether, these results indicate that QProbe RT-LAMP assays described here can be used as powerful diagnostic tools for rapid detection and surveillance of MERS-CoV infections.",

MERS has been endemic mainly in Saudi Arabia since 2012 (Assiri et al., 2013;  According to the case definition of the WHO, at least two distinct genomic targets are required for a positive diagnosis [WHO, GAR, Revised interim case definition for reporting to WHO -Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), updated on 3 July 2013, http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/case_ definition/en/index.html]. Therefore, many genetic diagnostic methods have been developed for the stable and reliable diagnosis of MERS-CoV infections. Currently, the main diagnostic method of MERS-CoV is real-time RT-PCR assays, and the primer/probe sets [upE and open reading frame (ORF) 1a] developed by Corman et al. are widely used as standard assays (Corman et al., 2012a,b) .",

In the LAMP assay, positive signals are indicated by turbidity that results from magnesium pyrophosphate precipitation following LAMP reaction. However, in this mechanism, the possibility of unexpected signals derived from primer dimer and/or non-primer reactions cannot be excluded (Njiru, 2012) . There is also a possibility of detecting turbidity if the host-derived DNA makes LAMP product non-specifically. Thus, if unexpected signals are detected, it is very difficult to identify the origin of the signal. The validity of MERS-CoV detection by previous RT-LAMP assay has been confirmed (Shirato et al., 2014) , but the mechanism of turbidity detection can be improved.",

The addition of DNA intercalator was used in Zika virus detection (Kurosaki et al., 2017) . However, the detection principle of these methods is the same as turbidity detection. Using fluorescence labeled primer can solve the problem of non-primer-derived signals. Recently, Fowler et al. (2016) reported RT-LAMP assays for detection of vesicular stomatitis, foot and mouth diseases, and swine vesicular disease viruses using fluorescence labeled forward inner primers (FIPs) or backward inner primers (BIPs). However, this study used 5\u00b4end-labeled primers. Therefore, if the fluorescent primer causes non-specific extension at the 3\u2032 end, unexpected signals will be detected. To avoid non-specific signals, melting curve analysis of the LAMP amplicon is useful to confirm amplification of the targeted sequence (Fowler et al., 2016; Kurosaki et al., 2017) . However, melting curve analysis requires incubation of at a higher temperature than that LAMP, and requires additional time after amplification, which negates the main advantage of LAMP.",

Use of QProbe can detect primer-derived signals only, and thus can avoid detecting non-specific amplification caused by fluorescent primer. In addition, to validate a positive MERS-CoV diagnosis, an additional primer set (targeting the ORF1a region) for use in QProbe RT-LAMP assays was developed to enable to confirm MERS cases only by QProbe RT-LAMP.

The positive signal is shown as quenching of fluorescence, which generates a reverse sigmoid curve (Fig. 1b) . In contrast, negative signals due to the lack of fluorescence quenching generate a straight line (Fig. 1b) . The detection limit of the QProbe RT-LAMP assay was determined using serially diluted MERS-CoV RNA templates and was evaluated in comparison to those of real-time RT-PCR (upE and ORF1a) and RT-LAMP (turbidity) assays (Table 2) . Although target regions of QProbe RT-LAMP assays were different from real-time RT-PCR assays, the validation was performed using copy number-determined viral RNA, and each amplification was performed using the same samples. As reported previously, both real-time RT-PCR and RT-LAMP assays are capable of detecting MERS-CoV RNA at a copy level as low as 20 (Corman et al., 2012a,b; Shirato et al., 2014) . As shown in Table 2 , QProbe RT-LAMP assays, which targeted N and ORF1a sequences, were able to detect MERS-CoV RNA at a similar level, comparable to realtime RT-PCR and RT-LAMP. These data indicate that the sensitivity of QProbe RT-LAMP assays is similar to that of existing genetic diagnostic methods.",

Two MERS-CoV negative specimens were used as negative controls. Taking into consideration the recent MERS case occurrence rate, it was difficult to obtain fresh specimens; therefore, stored specimens were used for validation.

However, significant genetic variations are present in these viral genomic regions as demonstrated by the large amount of sequences registered in GenBank. As shown in Table 1 , 300 and 278/9 variations of nucleotide sequences for N and ORF1a have been registered in the database, with the majority of them showing a complete match to the corresponding primer set. Mismatches (1-3 base-pairs) were identified in several sequences when aligned with our primers (see Supplemental figure) . In particular, the FIP primers had a high mismatch rate in the F2 region; the identities were 81.7% for N set and 86.0% for ORF1a set (Table 1) . To determine whether QProbe RT-LAMP could amplify target sequences with mismatches to our primers, a panel of N and ORF1a RNA templates were synthesized by in vitro transcription, and QProbe RT-LAMP assays were performed using the appropriate primer sets (Table 6 for N, Table 7 for ORF1a). The detection limit of QProbe RT-LAMP for the EMC isolate sequence was 7.3-15.8 copies. QProbe RT-LAMP assays showed similar levels of amplification among all RNA template sequences, compared with that of the EMC isolate. The MERS-CoV sequences with mismatches were either of camel and/or human origin. Regardless of the target sequence origin, QProbe RT-LAMP well tolerated the nucleotide mismatches (1-3 base-pairs) without affecting the overall assay performance. In the previous study, mismatch in the K. Shirato, et al. Journal of Virological Methods 258 (2018) 41-48 B2 region (G29018T) slightly altered the amplification efficiency of RT-LAMP, leading to a five-fold decrease in detection sensitivity (Shirato et al., 2014) . In contrast, the amplification efficiency in the QProbe RT-LAMP assays was not affected by mismatch in this region (Table 6 ). These findings indicate that the QProbe RT-LAMP assays could be used for the detection of all MERS-CoV isolates reported thus far, including for camels and humans.",

According to the case definition outlined by the WHO, positive amplification of at least two different virus-specific genomic targets is required for case confirmation. Two real-time RT-PCR assays were developed by Corman et al., using primer sets targeting upE and ORF1a region. These assays have been proven to be highly sensitive and specific; therefore, they are used as the standard diagnostic method for MERS-CoV (Corman et al., 2012a,b) . However, PCR amplification involves a relatively long running process and may be unsuitable for field-based studies. Recently, other genetic diagnostic methods using different mechanisms have been developed, which include RT-LAMP (Bhadra et al., 2015; Shirato et al., 2014) and reverse transcription isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) (Wahed et al., 2013) . In this study, the QProbe RT-LAMP targeted different positions in the MERS-CoV genome [ORF1a (nt 1572-1753) and N] from Corman's assays [ORF1a (nt 18265-18314) and upE]. Two positives in the QProbe RT-LAMP or realtime PCR assays are enough, to confirm the presence of MERS-CoV. However, this means if the specimen is positive in two of four sets, it can be considered positive for MERS-CoV; if one of the real-time RT-PCR assay is negative, one positive QProbe RT-LAMP is sufficient for case confirmation, and vice versa. Thus, these techniques have improved the sensitivity and diagnostic outcomes of MERS-CoV by increasing the number of viral genomic targets available for amplification.",

            "text": "The results of RT-LAMP can be detected at the endpoint by checking magnesium pyrophosphate precipitation or fluorescent signal generated by DNA intercalators under ultraviolet light (Mori et al., 2001) . Because they are easy to use, and they do not require large equipment for processing, RT-LAMP assays are more suitable for field-based studies. However, in turbidity monitoring, the salt accumulation accompanied by the LAMP reaction can be induced by primer dimers and/or nonprimer reactions (Njiru, 2012) . It is possible to detect unexpected increase in turbidity derived from non-primer signal, such as fragments of host DNA. Therefore, in this study, we developed a fluorescent RT-LAMP method with the addition of QProbes, in which only fluorescence quenching-derived from the probes was measured as a positive signal (Kurata et al., 2001) . As such, QProbes provide additional specificity for detection as they bind to unique nucleotides that are only present in the target sequence and amplicon by LAMP primers. This means that a positive signal in the QProbe RT-LAMP assay is dependent on the primer reaction only. In addition, labeling the 3\u2032 end with fluorescence dye abrogates non-specific signals derived from primers because extension of the QProbe is physically blocked by the dye. Thus, QProbe allows for highly specific detection under isothermal conditions and in a short time without melting curve analysis. Furthermore, materials used in QProbe RT-LAMP assays can be prepared as lyophilized form and packaged into diagnostic kits, increasing product integrity during shipment and handling. As demonstrated using clinical specimens (Table 5) , this assay could be run in a portable device (e.g., ESEQuant TS2) and be completed in 30 min or less for accurate diagnosis of MERS-CoV, making it more suitable for field-based studies. We also showed that the two primer sets constructed in the study (targeting the viral N and ORF1a sequences) were equally capable of detecting MERS-CoV RNA. This means that a positive diagnosis can be confirmed by QProbe RT-LAMP alone without the need for other confirmation methods.",

Our data indicate that these mismatches did not affect the ability of QProbe RT-LAMP assays to amplify these target sequences. In fact, these assays demonstrated comparable levels of sensitivity and specificity in detecting MERS-CoV genetic variants as the EMC strain, which was used for primer construction. When using LAMP, mismatches in primer sequences seem to be tolerated, but mismatches can occur in the primer's 3\u2032 end and the BIP primer should be avoided (Peyrefitte et al., 2008; Wang, 2016) . In previous report, a mismatch in the BIP primer of the MERS-CoV N set slightly affected reactivity for the Riyadh-3 clade of MERS-CoV (Shirato et al., 2014) .

The QProbe RT-LAMP assays were also able to detect target sequences (synthesized RNA) derived from dromedary MERS-CoV. These data suggest that QProbe RT-LAMP assays can be used as an easy, rapid and reliable surveillance technique for MERS-CoV in the field-based studies for both humans and dromedaries.",

            "text": "In this study, QProbe RT-LAMP assays were developed for the detection of MERS-CoV. Quenching of fluorescence from labeled probespecific reactions is measured as positive signals. These assays are capable of detecting MERS-CoV RNA at a level similar to that of standard real-time RT-PCR assays and the previously reported RT-LAMP, with no cross-reactivity observed with other respiratory viruses. QProbe RT-LAMP assays were demonstrated to be rapid, simple, and convenient as they employed a dry form of reagents and a portable fluorometer. QProbe RT-LAMP assays thus offer a reliable alternative for the diagnosis of MERS-CoV in humans and dromedaries. Altogether, these results indicate that the QProbe RT-LAMP assay can be used as a powerful tool for the diagnosis and surveillance of MERS-CoV infection in the field. ",
