It is that this virus in spite of all medical advances arose very quickly and has had worldwide effects. Just as the AIDs pandemic has infected 75 million and killed 32 million as of 2019; 5 or the much smaller (worldwide) Ebola hemorrhagic fever African epidemic which killed 11,000. Certainly we have come a long way the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918, the deadliest pandemic on record, which infected an estimated 500 million worldwide, roughly a third of the world's population, and killed 20 to 50 million, including and estimated 675,000 Americans. 6 What I am trying to show with these illustrations is that a century of experience and data has taught us these afflictions appear in spite of all the advances of medicine, and cannot be anticipated. The question that haunts my mind is, how would the United States handle such a pandemic outbreak if it occurred as the coronavirus did in China, just as some kind of major climate change crisis was also stressing the American healthcare system.

At the University of Massachusetts in Boston, at at the Center for Governance and Sustainability a team led by the center's director Professor Maria Ivanova as that question. And their conclusion? Looking at the combination of variables they see affecting the world they said these factors, \"have the potential to impact and amplify one another in ways that might cascade to create global systemic collapse.\" 20 Erik Franklin, a researcher at the University of Hawaii's Institute of Marine Biology concurs, \"Human society will be faced with the devastating combined impacts of multiple interacting climate hazards. They are happening now and will continue to get worse.\" 21 If any group must lead the preparation fight to prepare us I think it must be America's healthcare professionals; the people actually on the line. However, comfortable you are. No matter how convinced you are that this chain of crises won't touch you, or that you can handle it, you won't, and you can't. Not with the infrastructure and illness profit system we have today.",
