            "text": "More intensive studies of infectious enteritis caused by coronaviruses were not commenced until 1978, following widespread outbreaks in dogs of contagious vomiting and diarrhoea in February of that year. Some deaths resulted from the enteritis but generally the mortality rate was low (Carmichael, 1978; Appel et al., 1979) . In August 1978 a series of outbreaks of serious diarrhoeal disease was observed in widely separated areas of the world. In many instances a parvovirus-like particle was associated with the disease. Parvoviral diarrhoea was generally more severe than that associated with the coronavirus outbreaks ( Appel et al., 1979; Carmichael and Binn, 198 1) . Since then rotaviruses, astroviruses and caliciviruses have been demonstrated sporadically from dogs with enteric disease (Eugster and Sidwa. 1979; England and Poston, 1980: Williams, 1980; Fulton et al.. 1981; Hammond and Timoney, 1983; Schroeder et al., 1983; Mochizuki and Hsuan, 1984; Evermann et al.. 1985; Schaffer et al., 1985; Mochizuki et al., 1993) . 0378-l 135/95/$09.50 0 1995 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved SSDIO378-1135(95)00094-1 While canine parvovirus is common in Australia and its association with enteritis is known, the situation with CCV and other enteric viruses of dogs is unknown. The presence of coronaviruses and coronavirus-like particles (CVLP) in dog faeces in Australia has been reported twice. CVLP were first detected in stools from dogs kept 'by Aboriginal communities ( Schnagl and Holmes, 1978) . A clearcut association of these particles with diarrhoea could not be concluded, and work carried out since suggests these particles are not related to coronaviruses and may not be viruses at all (Schnagl et al., 1987) . Coronaviruses and CVLP were again detected in dog faeces in a study conducted by Marshall et al. ( 1984) . Four of the 11 dogs in which coronaviruses were detected had diarrhoea. Rotaviruses, astrovirus-like particles, papovavirus-like and 'round' virus particles have been detected also in the faeces of dogs in Australia (Hamilton. 1983; Marshall et al., 1984) . Tzipori and Makin ( 1978) detected antibodies against rotavirus in canine serum samples.",
