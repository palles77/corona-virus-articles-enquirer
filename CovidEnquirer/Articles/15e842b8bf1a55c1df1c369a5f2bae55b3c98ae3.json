This study numerically investigated a vortex flow driven ventilation in a model room to explore the dynamic characteristics and 3D visualisation of vortex-driven indoor tornados. Four approaches to identify the core region of the indoor tornado were developed and compared against each other. By successfully capturing the continuously changing centre of the vortex and significant core region size variations at different heights, the swirl vector method was recommended as a quantifiable approach to identify the core region of indoor tornados. The numerical outcomes also revealed a strong connection between the lift angle, vortex intensity, overall size of indoor tornado and maximum size of core region. The best contaminants control and removal was achieved at lift angle of 20\u00b0in this study and an optimum lift angle ranging from 10\u00b0to 20\u00b0was recommended for future study.",

            "text": "In all indoor environments, from a small residential compartment to a large airport terminal, the ventilation system has always been one of the most vital components and it vastly dominates the design index including indoor air quality, occupants' thermal comfort and occupational health and safety (OHS) [1, 2] . The performance of the ventilation system largely depends on its scheme, such as whether it is mixing or displacement ventilation [3] . Most of the existing and widely applied ventilation schemes are designed to create well-mixed air distribution inside the room so that the air can remain relatively refresh with effectively high air removal rate. However, everything is two-sided, while traditional ventilation systems create well-mixed and relatively lowmomentum air flow distribution in indoor spaces, they also inevitably accelerate the transport and exposure of local indoor contaminants that can be generated or released from many sources (e.g. human, carpet, electronic devices, etc.) [4] [5] [6] . When contaminants are highly concentrated locally, these commonly used ventilation systems would be most likely promoting the transport of local contaminants rather than removing or isolating them away from further spreading. Costly lessons were learned through several past events. For instance, the Sarin chemical attack that happened in the Tokyo subway in 1995, caused over a dozen deaths and thousands of injuries, in which the ventilation system immediately accelerated the dispersion of the fatal gas [7] . Recently, nosocomial infections of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) took place in 16 hospitals of South Korea through the ventilation systems and eventually caused the national outbreak of MERS in 2015, which ended up quarantining 16,993 individuals for 14 days [8] . Under such circumstances when locally concentrated contaminants are highly infectious or fatal, innovative ventilation strategies or schemes are in urgent demand to minimise the damage caused by harmful contaminants in indoor spaces.",

            "text": "With the large fraction of studies focused on investigating and optimising the existing ventilation systems [9] [10] [11] , the limitations of these ventilation systems for contaminant removal were also revealed more clearly. Since the traditional ventilation systems mainly rely on dilution and displacement to remove the contaminants [11] , the effectiveness of contaminants removal could be very sensitive to the size of the room and become ineffective in large buildings or densely occupied indoor environments [12] . Also, the dilution method would inevitably increase the chance of further spreading the contaminants. To seek possible solutions, a few studies aimed to develop new ventilation systems [13] [14] [15] . Cao et al. [12] proposed a so-called vortex flow ventilation system, which uses a number of inlets near the ground level to form https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2019.106345 Received 26 June 2019; Received in revised form 2 August 2019; Accepted 12 August 2019 strong ascending vortices inside an enclosed chamber. They further tested their proposed vortex flow ventilation in an indoor space and provided a much better contaminants removal rate when compared with other traditional ventilation systems [16] . This idea of generating indoor ascending tornado was effective since it could directly remove the contaminants from the source to the exiting vent without further spreading. However, the behaviour of the indoor tornado could be very sensitive to a wide variety of factors such as swirl ratio, core region and vortex intensity [17, 18] . These factors would significantly change the size, pattern and even formation of the tornado, which would essentially affect the transport and dispersion of the contaminants. It is of great importance to understand the dynamic behaviour of the indoor tornado prior to integrating it into an applicable indoor environment. Also, since physical boundaries do not exist in tornados, most existing studies referred to the geometrical positions of the tornado centre and used its relevant distance to the platform or the inlets to estimate the core region of the vortex [13] . This geometric-based estimation assumes that the size of the core region was uniform along the vertical direction. This assumption could be reasonable for outdoor tornados, in which the space has no restriction and the thereby the size variation on the core region compared to the overall size of the tornado is not significant. However, the formation of tornado in indoor spaces is seriously restricted by many factors, such as the height limit of the room and the size of the exhaust. All these factors would cause the core region of the indoor tornado to be significantly different at various heights and thereby the assumption of uniform core region is not realistic in indoor spaces. New criteria or approaches on identifying reasonable boundaries of indoor tornados could be of great significance in vortex flow ventilation systems.",

A room was modelled matching an existing experimental measurement chamber [13] to validate the reliability of the simulation and further explore the dynamic characteristics and 3D visualisation of indoor tornado and the corresponding vortex flow ventilation system. A novel approach (swirling vector method) to effectively identify the core regions and vortex intensity of the indoor tornado was proposed after indepth comparison among four developed approaches. The 3D visualisation on the real pattern of the indoor tornado were thereby achieved based on the swirling vector approach. The ability of the vortex-driven ventilation to trap contaminants inside the tornado under various conditions were further tested. The outcomes of this study revealed a strong and coupled relationship among the key factors (lift angle, vortex intensity, core region, etc.) and summarised an optimum configuration on the lift angle for contaminant removal.

To capture detailed velocity and pressure gradient change at the near wall regions, 10 inflation layers with growth ratio of 1.1 were generated near all inlets, exhaust and the source surface of contaminants. Mesh independence was achieved at 2.57 million elements with 95% elements below skewness number of 0.3 and maximum surface y + below 5. Further refining the mesh did not contribute significant differences of the air velocity profiles, pressure or contaminants distributions. The airflow field was solved using the incompressible Navier-Stoke (N-S) equations and the SIMPLEC algorithm was employed for the velocity-pressure coupling. The airflow and contaminant fields were solved using high-resolution advection scheme to achieve better robustness and accuracy of the advection terms. RNG k-\u03f5 model was applied for the air turbulence due to its successful application in modelling airflow and contaminants transport in indoor and enclosed environments [20, 21] . Gaseous contaminants were released from a small circular surface at the coordinate origin of the domain. Contaminant transport was solved using a transportable scalar [19] , where C is a scalar representing the contaminant concentration, S C is the source term, D is the kinematic diffusivity of the contaminant.",

Simulations, on the other hand, would have full potential to identify and visualise the effective boundary of the vortex, which would be the key leading to a better and deeper understanding of the indoor tornado. Therefore, the vortex identification criteria (e.g. vortex intensity and core region) were firstly studied and discussed in conjunction with the aforementioned factors to investigate the impacts of these factors on the development of the vortex and to provide accurate 3D visualisation of the indoor tornado.",

The vortex immediately contained the maximum intensity at the ground level when the lift angle was set as 0\u00b0, which was indicating a strong formation of tornado near the ground level. On the other hand, when the lift angle was increase to 30\u00b0, the vortex intensity remained zero at lower height (up to 1.2 m), followed by a continuous growth of the intensity with the height increase. No indoor tornado was formed when the intensity of vortex was close to zero and thereby the formation of indoor tornado was significantly delayed and only occurred above 1.2 m when the lift angle was 30\u00b0. By comparing all four cases, a clear periodic pattern was captured that the maximum vortex intensity occurred at a higher height but reduced magnitude, when the lift angle was increased. When the maximum vortex intensity appeared at different heights, the patterns of indoor tornado could be completely different. Therefore, the boundary of the effective vortex needs to be carefully identified.",

            "text": "Prior to identifying the 3D dynamic boundary of the vortex, the core regions of the vortex at arbitrary 2D planes yielded from different methods were carefully compared. The radiuses of the core regions were plotted against the height at four lift angles, as shown in Fig. 10 . The results from the swirling vector method and maximum tangential velocity method showed very similar scale and profiles of the core region radius changes at most lift angle cases, except at the high lift angle of 30\u00b0. The other two methods, on the other hand, all predicted larger radius of the core region compared to the swirling vector and maximum tangential velocity methods. It is worth noting at lift angle of 30\u00b0that the swirling vector method predicted completely different profiles of the core region radius to the rest of the methods. At the heights below approximately 1.2 m, the radius of core region predicted by the swirling method was extremely small (close to zero), which indicates that the there was no formation of the tornado until approximately 1.2 m. On the other hand, the rest of the methods yielded extremely large radii of the core region. The maximum tangential velocity method clearly overpredicted the radius of the core region (outside the boundary of the domain), which indicated that this method did not filter out the low velocity region at lower height and failed to distinguish the tornado to the surrounding flow. Since the vortex intensity at lower height was extreme small at 30\u00b0lift angle based on the above Fig. 9 , the core region profiles from the swirling vector method (red lines) were better matching the vortex intensity pattern and better reflecting the real condition of the indoor tornado (i.e. no formation of indoor tornado until 1.2 m).",

It can be noticed from Fig. 11 that the double maximum tangential velocity method significantly over-predicted the size of the core region, especially at the lower heights (e.g. Z = 0.9 m) due to the interruptions from the inlet jet flow. Conversely, the size of core regions predicted by the single maximum tangential velocity method were too small at higher heights. Therefore, the maximum tangential velocity-based method is not ideal to identify the dynamic core region of indoor tornado since it can be easily affected by the surrounding flows. The velocity magnitude method showed very similar limitations as the maximum tangential velocity approach. In terms of the velocity magnitude and tangential direction combined method, it managed to minimise the interruption from the inlet jet flow and yielded relatively reasonable sizes of the core region. However, the centre of the predicted core region through this method was fixed at the geometrical centre, which was untrue. The velocity vector plots clearly proved the hypothesis that the centre of the vortex is not at the geometrical centre (e.g. at Z = 0.7 m and 1.3 m). Through comparing the core region sizes in conjunction with the velocity vector plots, the swirl vector method identified the most reasonable sizes of core regions at all height levels among the compared approaches. Most importantly, the swirl vector approach is the only approach that successfully captured the dynamic centre changes of the core regions. Therefore, the swirl vector method was the reliable and recommended approach to capture the dynamic centre and the boundary of indoor tornados. With the robustness of the swirl vector method being proved, the 2D swirling vector plots inside the core regions yielded from this method were applied to further study the characteristics of the indoor tornado.",

The 3D indoor tornado pattern demonstrated very strong uneven distribution of the vortex centre, especially at low lift angles (i.e. 0\u00b0and 10\u00b0). It can be clearly observed from the figure that the overall size of the indoor tornado became smaller when the lift angle went beyond 10\u00b0. The vortex was not even strong enough to form the tornado pattern at lower height when the lift angle was too high (30\u00b0). When controlling the indoor tornado size is necessary (e.g. minimising the size of the tornado to eliminate further spread of contaminants), the optimum lift angle is between 10\u00b0and 20\u00b0. Further lifting the angle could have a negative effect on the formation of indoor tornado. To further compare the size and location of the maximum size of the indoor tornado, the maximum core regions are compared in Fig. 13 . The results reveal a clear pattern that the maximum core region size gradually reduces with the increase of lift angle (from over 0.5 m at 0\u00b0lift angle to almost half of the size at 30\u00b0lift angle). On the other hand, the height where the maximum core region occurred is lower, when the lift angle is increased. To carry as much contaminant as possible away from the source, a lower lift angle is preferred, while a higher lift angle could avoid further spreading of the contaminants at higher level. Therefore, to achieve optimum design, it is essential to investigate the contaminants transport under this indoor condition.",

The results clearly reveal the dominating control of the indoor tornado on the transport and distribution of the contaminants, while the unstable vortex pattern also strongly affected the pattern of the contaminants, especially the relatively low concentred contaminants that were distributed close to the boundary of the indoor tornado. Through comparison, it is worth noting that the optimum control on the contaminants transport and distribution is achieved at a lift angle of 20\u00b0, in which the entire gaseous contaminants were successfully captured inside the tornado and were directly exhausted from the exit without further spreading inside the room. The optimum settings could be limited to this tested room, scale-up of the proposed system would be needed for real indoor application. In this study, the gaseous contaminants were employed as an example to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system. The outcomes showed that the proposed system is very effective of capturing the contaminants inside the tornado and removing airflow-driven contaminants, which means it could also applicable to most of the particulate contaminants. However, particulate contaminants with extremely small size (nano size particles) or particles with strong inertia (i.e. very large particles) could have very different distributions and need to be further studied. Although the presented outcomes could be limited to the studied conditions and parameters. The methods of identifying the indoor tornado and the capabilities of the indoor tornado on contaminant control is promising, especially for large spaces and densely occupied indoor environments where the traditional ventilation schemes have very limited control (airport, train station, etc.) ",

This approach successfully captured the continuously changing centre of the vortex and significant core region size variations at different heights, which are critical characteristics of indoor tornados due to the indoor limitations on room height, exhaust size and position, etc. With the boundary of the vortex at arbitrary 2D planes being accurately defined, the strong visualisation capabilities of computations were used to study indoor vortex flow ventilation. 3D visualisation of the indoor tornado profiles was easily achieved with high accuracy by applying the proposed swirling vector method. 2. The lift angle of the inlet jet was found to have a strong connection to the vortex intensity, the overall size of indoor tornado and the contaminants distributions. Increasing the lift angle would reduce the size of the tornado and thereby have positive impacts on controlling the contaminants transport. However, it was worth noting that the indoor tornado could fail to form at lower heights if the inlet jet angle was over lifted. The ideal lift angle found in this study was 20\u00b0, in which the released contaminants were successfully trapped inside the indoor tornado with minimised size and were directly exhausted through the exist without further spreading inside the room.
