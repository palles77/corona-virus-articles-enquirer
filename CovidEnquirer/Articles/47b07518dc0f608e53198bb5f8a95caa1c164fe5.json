A way of accelerating triage process and prioritizing CT examination and PCR tests for suspected SARS-CoV-2 patients would be to identify a useful practical marker. The official guidelines (the Guidelines of the National Health Commission of China for COVID-19, 5 th edition; 2 and the WHO interim guideline 3 ) currently recommend two laboratory parameters, \"normal/ decreased number of leukocytes\" or \"decreased number of lymphocytes\", as one of the criteria for diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. Here, our analysis suggests eosinopenia (decreased number of eosinophils) as a potentially more reliable laboratory predictor of SARS-CoV-2 infection than recommended \"leukocyte counts\" and \"lymphopenia\".",
