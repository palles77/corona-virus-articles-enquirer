To better understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which receptor cross-linking affects the intracellular trafficking of both ligand and receptor, we studied the intracellular trafficking of the transferrin receptor (TfR) bound to multivalent-transferrin (Tfl0) which was prepared by chemical cross-linking of transferrin (Tf). Tfl0 was internalized about two times slower than Tf and was retained four times longer than Tf, without being degraded in CHO cells. The intracellular localization of Tfl0 was investigated using fluorescence and electron microscopy. Tfl0 was not delivered to the lysosomal pathway followed by low density lipoprotein but remained accessible to Tf in the pericentriolar endocytic recycling compartment for at least 60 min. The retained Tfl0 was TfR-associated as demonstrated by a reduction in surface TfR number when cells were incubated with Tfl0. The presence of Tfx0 within the recycling compartment did not affect trafficking of subsequently endocytosed Tf. Retention of Tfl0 within the recycling compartment did not require the cytoplasmic domain of the TfR since Tfl0 exited cells with the same rate when bound to the wild-type TfR or a mutated receptor with only four amino acids in the cytoplasmic tail. Thus, cross-linking of surface receptors by a multivalent ligand acts as a lumenal retention signal within the recycling compartment. The data presented here show that the recycling compartment labeled by Tfl0 is a long-lived organelle along the early endosome recycling pathway that remains fusion accessible to subsequently endocytosed Tf.",

Receptor cross-linking has been demonstrated to alter the intracellular trafficking of receptorligand complexes. Low density lipoprotein (LDL) 1 and [3-very low density lipoprotein ([3-VLDL) bind the same apo-B,E, receptor (Ellsworth et al., 1987; Koo et al., 1986) either monovalently (LDL) or multivalently . As a consequence of the difference in valency, these lipoproteins enter macrophages by distinct routes that diverge at the plasma membrane (Myers et al., 1993; Tabas et al., 1990 Tabas et al., , 1991 . Similarly, the Fc receptor of macrophages when complexed with monovalent Fab fragments directed against the Fc receptors, rapidly recycle through the endosomal system of macrophages ; however, the addition of antibody directed against the Fab fragments to cross-link the Fc receptors results in the removal of the receptors from the recycling pool and degra-dation of the Fc receptors . The observed valency-induced sorting is likely to be of physiological importance since Fc receptors cross-linked by multivalent immune complexes are removed from the recycling pool and degraded .",

The cellular mechanism and physiological function of this sorting induced by cross-linking remains unclear as does its variable effect. For example, TfR heavily cross-linked by pentavalent IgM was aggregated on the cell surface and not internalized (Lesley et al., 1989) . Divalent F(ab)'2 fragments of the same antibody resulted in receptor downregulation and enhanced degradation, possibly in the lysosome (Lesley et al., 1989) . In another study, a monoclonal antibody directed against TfR accumulated in an \"extended\" endosomal compartment after an overnight incubation with antibody (Killisch et al., 1992) . Although antibody treatment generally produces a redistribution of the TfR, only a portion of the cross-linked TfR are degraded. The site of antibodyinduced degradation has been suggested to be the lysosome, yet in at least one system, antibody induced degradation of asialoglycoprotein receptor was not affected by lysosomal protease inhibitors, or by incubation at 18\u00b0C (Schwartz et al., 1986) . The variable effect upon receptor trafficking caused by antibody cross-linking may in part be explained by the varying extent of receptor aggregation induced by the multivalent binding of antibody. The observed variability may be explained by several factors including the number of antibody binding sites per receptor molecule, the binding affinity and/or avidity of the antibody for the receptor, and the receptor density on the cell surface. As a result it is technically difficult to determine the extent of cross-linking induced by antibody binding.",

To further define these mechanisms an experimental system was developed using Tf as a model ligand. Tf was chosen since its binding interaction with the TfR, as well as its intracellular trafficking pathway, has been well defined. TfR are constitutively endocytosed via coated pits and delivered to sorting endosomes (Maxfield and Yamashiro, 1991; van Deurs et al., 1989) . Within the sorting endosome recycling components such as Tf, LDL-R, and bulk-phase lipids are removed with a half time of about 3 min while lysosome-directed components such as LDL and ct2M are retained (Dunn et al., 1989; Stoorvogel et al., 1991; Mayor et al., 1993; Yamashiro and Maxfield, 1987) .",

The recycling compartment has been shown to be functionally separate from the sort-ing endosome in that the recycling compartment maintains an average pH of 6.4 while the pH of the sorting endosome has been determined to be ~6.0 (Yamashiro et al., 1984; Presley et al., 1993) . Furthermore, exit from the recycling compartment has been shown to be the rate limiting step in the recycling of both Tf and bulk membrane, having a half time of ~10-15 min . Similar tubular recycling compartments have been observed in many cell types although their distribution within cells varies (Hopkins, 1983; Hopkins et al., 1990; Tooze and Hollinshead, 1991; Killisch et al., 1992; Ghosh et al., 1994; Ghosh and Maxfield, 1995) . These recycling compartments are identified as part of the early endosome system since they contain recycling TfR and LDL receptors . However, they are a distinct part of the early endosome system since they lack LDL or a2M which are removed from their receptors in the acidic sorting endosome and retained there. Aside from recycling receptors, the protein composition of the membranes of these recycling compartments has not been determined.",

In this paper we described the synthesis of a multivalent form of Tf, composed of an average of ten Tf molecules (Tfl0). We show that Tfl0 was capable of cross-linking TfR. Tfl0 was internalized about two times slower and was retained four times longer than Tf. The internalized Tfl0 remained accessible to subsequently endocytosed Tf for at least 60 min demonstrating that the recycling compartment of CHO cells is a long-lived compartment. Finally, we show that the mechanism responsible for the retention of Tfl0 does not require the cytoplasmic domain of the TfR.",

Simultaneously, sulfo-MBS was added to a 10 -3 M solution of HRP in PBS, such that there was a 10-fold excess of sulfo-MBS with respect to HRP, and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The thiolated-Tf was added to a flvefold molar excess of MBS-HRP and allowed to react for 4 h at room temperature. HRP-Tf was isolated from free HRP and Tf by passage over a S-200HR column (1.5 \u00d7 38 cm). The mole ratio of HRP to Tf was determined using published molar absorbance coefficients at 280 am, 403 nm, and 470 nm (de Jong et al., 1990; Paul, 1963) . The HRP-Tf used in the experiments presented here had an HRP to Tf mole ratio of 0.6. A 2 \u00d7 10 -5 M solution of Tfl0 in 50 mM borate pH 9.2 was incubated with a 10fold molar excess of sulfo-MBS for 60 rain. HRP was thiolated using a 10fold molar excess of 2-IT. The thiol-HRP was added to the MBS-Tft0 and incubated for 4 h. HRP-TIm was purified and assayed as above and found to have an HRP to Tfl0 mole ratio of 0.5. F-Tfl0-colloidal gold conjugates (Au-F-Tfw) were prepared using 18nm colloidal gold suspensions. The colloidal gold suspension was adjusted to pH 6.6 with 10 mM phosphate. 16 ml of the gold suspension was added to 12.8 ml of a F-Tfl0 solution, composed of 6.25 Ixg/ml F-Tfl0 and 18.75 ixg/ml ovalbumin, and vortexed for 1 min. The mixture was rocked for 15 min at room temperature, brought to 2 mg/ml ovalbumin and then rocked for an additional 30 min to ensure that the gold particles were completely coated with protein. Based on data from De Roe et al. (1987) , we estimate that these conditions limit the incorporation of F-Tfl0 to approximately one per gold particle. The gold suspension was centrifuged at 4,000 g for 45 min at 4\u00b0C to concentrate the Au-F-Tfw. The \"loose\" pellet of Au-F-Tfl0 was harvested and dialyzed against 1 mg/ml ferric ammonium citrate, 50 mM NaHCO3, and 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, for 45 min at room temperature to ensure that the Au-F-Tf~0 was iron saturated. The Au-F-Tf~0 was buffer exchanged to PBS containing 2 mg/ml ovalbumin by extensive dialysis. The Au-F-Tfl0 was stored at 4\u00b0C and used within 48 h.",

Our preliminary findings demonstrated that the Tf-multimer bound the surface TfR in a saturable and competable fashion (data not shown). However, the Tf-multimers appeared to have two distinct fates. Approximately 30% of the Tf-multimers were degraded over a 3-h chase (data not shown). The majority of the Tf-multimer, however, was re-leased intact from the ceils albeit with altered kinetics with respect to native Tf. These results indicated that grossly cross-linked TfR are to some extent redirected to degradative lysosome-like compartments by a poorly described mechanism.

TRVb-1 cells bound native Tf saturably (Fig. 1 A) . LIGAND, a ligandbinding data analysis program (Munson and Rodbard, 1980) , was used to estimate a kD of 0.7 nM and 1.1 \u00d7 10 s binding sites per cell, in agreement with previously reported values (McGraw et al., 1987) . Tfl0 also specifically bound the TfR of TRVb-1 cells (Fig. 1 B) , reaching saturation at ~30 fmol of Tfl0 per 106 cells, significantly less than the 180 fmol per 106 cells expected if Tft0 bound the TfR monovalently in a manner similar to Tf. This sixfold reduc~ tion in the number of particles bound at saturation suggests that each Tfl0 particle bound approximately six TfR. The Tfl0 binding data were analyzed using LIGAND, which estimated a kD of 0.2 nM if a single affinity was assumed. The approximately threefold increase in binding affinity of Tfl0 compared to Tf is consistent with multivalent binding. However, the estimation of the binding affinity of Tfl0 is complicated by an approximately fivefold reduction in the binding affinity of the MBS-Tf used in the preparation of Tft0 (data not shown), which would par-tially mask the enhancement of avidity resulting from multivalent binding. The thiolation of Tf was without significant effect on the binding interaction (data not shown). Since the intrinsic affinity of MBS-Tf is less than the affinity of Tf, the increase in binding avidity as a result of multimerization is actually greater than threefold. Although methods are available to carry out a detailed analysis of multivalent binding (Perelson, 1984) , we did not attempt this since the multimers were a somewhat heterogeneous mixture. Such an analysis would be very complex and difficult to interpret since the intrinsic affinity of each Tf in the multimer may vary. Despite this limitation in the analysis, the increase in affinity and the decrease in molecules bound at saturation are both strongly indicative of multivalent binding at 0\u00b0C.",

Analysis of this data, using 79,570 D and 795,700 D as the estimated molecular weights of Tf and Tfl0, respectively, revealed a 4-8-fold reduction in the number of moles of Tflo which were cell associated at saturation as compared to that of Tf (Fig. 2 A) . To confirm that the reduced Tfl0 uptake reflected multivalent binding, the ability of Tf~0 to compete with 125I-Tf for TfR binding was compared to the ability of Tf to compete with 125I-Tf for TfR binding. We found Tfl0 and Tf to be nearly equivalent competitors of 125I-Tf binding at 37\u00b0C (Fig. 2 B) . Comparing Fig. 2 A to Fig. 2 B , it can be seen that under conditions where Tf and Tfl0 displace an equivalent number of 125I-Tf molecules (Fig. 2 B) , there were four to eight times less Tfl0 cell associated as compared to Tf on a molar basis (Fig. 2 A) Coy's binding buffer, solubilized with 1 N NaOH, and assayed for 125I content.

A small fraction of the Tfl0 may be redirected to the lysosome, since up to five percent of the Tfl0 was degraded (Fig. 3 B) . While the majority of Tfl0 was not degraded to TCA soluble fragments the possibility existed that partial proteolysis could be occurring resulting in large fragments that would be TCA precipitable. To address this, TRVb-1 cells were pulsed with 125I-Tfl0 and chased for 120 min. The supematant from these cells was passed over a S-400HR column.

The cells were washed and further incubated in the absence of both proteins for either 2 or 10 min. Previous studies (Dunn et al., 1989; Dunn and Maxfield, 1992; Mayor and Maxfield, 1993) have demonstrated that TRVb-1 cells cointernalize LDL and Tf to common sorting endosomes. The LDL and Tf rapidly sort from each other, with Tf being delivered to the pericentriolar recycling compartment and LDL retained in sorting endosomes that mature into late endosomes. If the multivalent binding of Tfl0 caused Tfl0 to be delivered into the late endosomes, this would be demonstrated by extensive colocalization of LDL and Tfl0 after 10 min of chase. TRVb-1 ceils were incubated with F-Tfl0 and DiI-LDL for Figure 4 . Multivalent-transferrin is sorted from LDL. TRVb-1 cells were grown on coverslip dishes and incubated for 2 min in 40 p,g/ml F-Tfl0 and 20 ixg/ml DiI-LDL.

F-Tfl0 images (A and C) were collected and photographed using identical settings. DiI-LDL images (B and D) were also collected and photographed using identical settings.

Since there was a great range in the intensity of LDLcontaining structures, some dim LDL spots have been lost in the presentation of B, and this reduces the apparent extent of initial colocalization with Tf.

As shown in Fig. 4 A and B, Tfl0 like Tf (Dunn et al., 1989; Mayor et al., 1993) is rapidly delivered to sorting endosomes which also contain LDL. Parallel cells were pulsed for 2 min as above and chased for 10 min to observe the sorting of Tfl0 from the LDL. AFter the 10-min chase, DiI-LDL was located in widely dispersed punctate vesicles characteristic of sorting endosomes and late endosomes as previously described (Dunn et al., 1989, Fig. 4 D) , while the majority of F-Tfl0 was localized in the pericentriolar recycling compartment of the cell (Fig. 4 C) . Thus, the majority of Tfl0 was not retained in sorting endosomes or delivered to late endosomes (Fig. 4, C and D) . Since the majority of Tfl0 sorts from lysosomally directed molecules similar to Tf, we investigated the possibility that Tfl0 retention occurred later in the recycling pathway. TRVb-1 cells were incubated with F-Tfl0 for 10 min at 37\u00b0C, washed, and chased for a total of 60 min. At 56, 48, or 28 min of F-Tfl0 chase, Cy3-Tf was added for a 2-min incubation and chased for 2, 10, or 30 min, respec- Figure 5 . Multivalent-transferrin is localized in the recycling compartment of TRVb-1 cells. TRVb-1 cells were incubated in 40 txg/ml F-Tfl0 for 10 rain and then chased for a total of 60 min.

The cells were washed and chased for 2 (A, B, and C), 10 (D, E, and F), or 30 (G, H, and/) rain, respectively. The cells were prepared for microscopy as described. The focal plane was selected to optimize the F-Tfl0 image, and the Cy3-Tf image was then collected without further adjustment to focus.

Phase-contrast images are presented in C, F, and L Bar, 10 ixm. tively. After 2 min the majority of Cy3-Tf was localized in small widely dispersed sorting endosomes (Fig. 5 A) . By 10 min, most of the Cy3-Tf had cleared the sorting endosomes and was found primarily in the recycling compartment where it extensively colocalized with F-Tfl0 showing that the majority of the retained F-Tfl0 is localized in the recycling compartment (Fig. 5, D and E) . After 30 min of chase the TRVb-1 cells contained barely detectable amounts of Cy3-Tf in the recycling compartment (Fig. 5, G and H) . The exit of Cy3-Tf is similar to that obtained in the absence of Tfl0 and suggests that Tfl0 in the recycling compartment did not have a significant effect on the trafficking of subsequently added Cy3-Tf.",

TRVb-1 cells incubated with either Au-F-Tfl0 or F-Tfl0 for 10 min and chased for 60 min were found to have a staining pattern consistent with recycling compartment localization, indicating that the conjugation of F-Tfl0 to the colloidal gold had not grossly altered the localization of the conjugated F-Tfl0 (data not shown).

Within the sorting endosome, recycling components such as Tf, LDL-R, and bulk-phase lipids are rapidly sorted from lysosome-directed components like LDL and ot2M with a half time of ~2-3 rain (Stoorvogel et al., 1991; Mayor et al., 1993; Yamashiro and Maxfield, 1987) . The recycling components are delivered to a morphologically distinct recycling compartment composed of a network of small vesicles and tubular endosomes located in the pericentriolar region of CHO cells which are not physically connected to the sorting endosome (Dunn and Maxfield, 1992; Dunn et al., 1989; McGraw et al., 1993; Yamashiro et al., 1984) . An important issue is whether the various endocytic organelles are stable or transient. Clearly, coated vesicles are transient, and they fuse rapidly with endosomes after pinching off from the plasma membrane. Evidence has also been presented showing that sorting endosomes are transient organelles that mature into late endosomes (Dunn et al., 1989; Dunn and Maxfield, 1992; Stoorvogel et al., 1991) . The lifetime of the recycling compartment has not been examined in detail. It has been shown that recycling Tf remains in a fusion-accessible compartment for as long as it can be detected within the cell (Saizman and . However, the rapid loss of Tf limited measurements to ~15 min chase times. In this paper, we have shown that Tfl0 enters the same recycling compartment of Tf with nearly normal kinetics but leaves with a half time of 60 rain. This lengthy retention of Tfl0 indicates that the recycling compartment is a stable, long-lived organelle. Furthermore, we have shown that the recycling compartment labeled with Tfl0 remains fusion accessible to newly endocytosed material for at least 1 h. We cannot strictly rule out the possibility that labeling with Tfx0 has induced the formation of a long-lived portion of the recycling compartment. However, we note that Tf enters and leaves this compartment at the same rate whether or not it has Tfl0 in it. Furthermore, the morphology of the compartment is the same whether it contains Tfl0, Tf, or both (Figs. 5 and 6).",

TRVbA3-59 cells were incubated in 40 p,g/ml F-Tfl0 for 50 rain and then chased for a total of 60 rain. At 48, 38, and 18 rain of chase, the medium was replaced with 20 ~g/ml Cy3-Tf for 10 rain. The cells were washed and chased for 2 (A-C), 10 (D-F), or 30 (G-/) rain, respectively. The cells were prepared for microscopy as described. The focal plane was selected to optimize the F-Tfl0 image, and the Cy3-Tf image was then collected without further adjustment to focus. Cy3-Tf images (A, D, and G) were collected and processed using identical settings. F-Tfl0 images (B, E, and H) were collected and processed using identical settings.

Recently, it has been shown in polarized MDCK cells that transcytosed IgA is sorted from TfR, which recycles to the basolateral membrane, in a common apical recycling compartment (Apodaca et al., 1994) . The insulin-dependent glucose transporter GLUT-4, in the absence of insulin, is sequestrated in a transferrinaccessible compartment, possibly as a result of oligomerization (Bell et al., 1993; James and Piper, 1993) . Addition of insulin results in the redistribution of GLUT-4 to the cell surface. The trafficking of GLUT-4 appears to be controlled by at least two cytoplasmic domains, one of which lies in the amino terminus of the protein and functions as an internalization signal (Garippa et al., 1994) . The second signal is localized in the carboxy terminus and has been suggested to be important for intracellular localization (Czech et al., 1993; Verhey et al., 1993) . Taken together these studies suggest that the recycling compartment may actively control the rate of receptor recycling to the cell surface.",

Our experiments using the TRVbA3-59 cells argue against a direct cytoskeletal interaction of this nature, since the cytoplasmic domain of the TfR was not required for Tfl0 retention. We cannot rule out the existence of an additional factor(s) that could interact with the membrane-spanning domain and/or the lumenal domain of the cross-linked TfR and tether the Tfl0-TfR complex to the cytoskeleton, similar to the mechanism proposed for the sorting of regulated secretory proteins (Kelly, 1991) .",
