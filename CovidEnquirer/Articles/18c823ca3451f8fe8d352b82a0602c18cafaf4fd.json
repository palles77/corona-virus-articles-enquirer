Data Synthesis: Human rhinoviruses, by attaching to the nasal epithelium via the intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) receptor, cause most colds. Ionic zinc, based on its electrical charge, also has an affinity for ICAM-1 receptor sites and may exert an antiviral effect by attaching to the ICAM-1 receptors in the rhinovirus structure and nasal epithelial cells. Clinical tests of zinc for treatment of common colds have been inconsistent, primarily because of study design, blinding, and lozenge contents. Early formulations of lozenges also were unpalatable. In three trials with similar study designs, methodologies, and efficacy assessments, zinc effectively and significantly shortened the duration of the common cold when it was administered within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms. Recent reports of trials with zinc gluconate administered as a nasal gel have supported these findings; in addition, they have shown that treatment with zinc nasal gel is effective in reducing the duration and severity of common cold symptoms in patients with established illness.",

However, a leading hypothesis is that Zn 2+ is a competitive inhibitor of ICAM-1 in both rhinovirus particles and the nasal epithelium. 5, 12 Zinc ions are small, positively charged spheres with an affinity for ICAM-1 receptor sites that can easily reach the rhinovirus canyon floor. 5 By attaching to the ICAM-1 receptor sites, zinc ions prevent the rhinovirus from binding with ICAM-1 and also from effectively entering the cell and replicating. 5, 15 By competing with LFA-1 for ICAM-1 receptor sites, zinc ions are also thought to disrupt the binding of LFA-1 to ICAM-1 and suppress inflammation; this may explain the reduction of inflammation reported by patients treated with zinc for the common cold. 12 At least one clinical trial of zinc in the common cold correlated plasma levels of zinc and proinflammatory cytokines. 16 ",

Early studies reported inconsistent findings, often because of design or lozenge content inconsistencies. Three recent clinical trials with similar study designs, methodologies, and efficacy assessments provided evidence that zinc can effectively and significantly shorten the duration of the common cold if it is administered within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms. In addition, reports of trials with zinc gluconate administered as a nasal gel have supported these findings.",

Pharmacists should advise patients to begin zinc treatment at the very first sign of cold symptoms, ideally within 24 hours of onset. Zinc products should be continued until symptoms resolve or until otherwise advised by a physician. Pharmacists should reassure patients that the use of zinc at dosages consistent with product labeling is safe. Adverse effects are mild and are generally confined to the gastrointestinal tract.

Maintaining the ionic availability of zinc has been a challenge to the formulation of effective zinc products. 5 Zinc has an offensive metallic taste, and to mask these properties, flavorings and chelating agents were added to some products. 5 However, masking the unpleasant taste of zinc reduced the concentration of ionic zinc in some products, thereby reducing efficacy. 5 More recently developed oral zinc products have been formulated to provide high levels of ionic zinc and tissue affinity in a pleasant-tasting base.",

However, these formulations resulted in highly bound zinc complexes that released very little ionic zinc in the mouth, and the trials were unable to demonstrate treatment effects different from placebo lozenges. 1, 20, 21 In addition, several trials were considered flawed by the use of a relatively low dose (4.5 mg) of zinc 22, 30 or faulty methodologies. 30 Speculating that the lack of effectiveness of zinc in these early studies was the result of inactivation by chelating agents, researchers developed formulations that readily released most zinc ions (90%-93%) from the complex and evaluated them in clinical trials. 23 In the first of these Godfrey et al. 23 found that zinc gluconate in a hard candy base (elemental zinc 23.7 mg) used every 2 hours while awake significantly reduced the duration of the cold and the severity of symptoms. Another key finding of the study was that zinc reduced the duration of the cold by an additional 1.42 days (P = .035) if treatment was initiated within 24 hours of the onset of cold symptoms. 23 The results of the study by Godfrey et al. were corroborated by three of five studies published over the next 8 years, all of which were comparable in study design to the earlier trial. 16, 18, 23, 24 The three studies used zinc gluconate or zinc acetate lozenges (9 mg to 13.3 mg elemental zinc) in a calcium lactate or dextrose base. 16, 18, 24 They enrolled 50 or more patients, used the same 4point scale to rate symptom severity (0, none; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe), began treatment within 24 hours of symptom onset, and had virtually identical dosage regimens (1 lozenge every 2 hours as long as symptoms persisted). Zinc consistently and significantly reduced the duration of the cold and the duration of cold symptoms in all three studies. The duration of the cold was reduced by 1.3 to 3.6 days (P < .008 to P < .001).",

            "text": "The inconsistent results with zinc lozenges, coupled with the uncertain mechanism of action of ionic zinc, led researchers to explore delivery of Zn 2+ ions directly to the nasal mucosa, the site of rhinovirus infection. 15, [27] [28] [29] An early intranasal spray formulation contained 0.l2% zinc as zinc sulfate (elemental zinc 0.011 mg per dose), given as two inhalations in each nostril four times daily until symptoms resolved. 27 The only clinical trial of this formulation was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which patients were enrolled within 24 hours of symptom onset, and symptoms were evaluated on a 4-point scale. There were no differences between the zinc nasal spray and placebo spray in the median duration of all symptoms nor in the median duration of nasal symptoms. A post hoc analysis found that after adjustment for differences in baseline symptom severity, the zinc spray significantly reduced the total symptom and total nasal symptom scores on day 1 only. The total maximum daily dose of zinc delivered in this preparation (0.044 mg) may have been too low to be effective. 15, 27 Further evaluations of intranasal zinc gel in randomized, double-blind trials have been published. 15, 28, 29 The intranasal gel formulation consisted of 33 mM ionic zinc in an emulsion with a pH of 7.2 and delivering 120 microliters per spray. 15, 28, 29 The nasal gel spray has been investigated in three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies: two for the treatment of natural colds and one as prophylaxis and treatment of induced colds. 15, 28, 29 The design of the first study, by Hirt et al., 28 was similar to that of the evaluation of zinc gluconate lozenges by Mossad et al. in 1996. 18 More than 100 patients in each group were treated with either the nasal gel spray or placebo, beginning less than 24 hours after the onset of cold symptoms, and rated their symptoms on a 4point scale twice daily. 28 They were instructed to use the zinc nasal gel every 4 hours while awake until they no longer experienced symptoms. Using an efficacy endpoint of complete resolution of symptoms, the investigators found that the duration of symptoms in patients treated with the zinc nasal gel was 2.3 days, compared with 9.0 days in the placebo group (difference: 6.7 days (P < .05). This 75% reduction in the duration of symptoms was consistent with that reported in the preliminary study of the nasal gel formulation for patients treated within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms. 28 A study by Turner 29 evaluated the prophylactic effectiveness of intranasal zinc gluconate in healthy volunteers, and treatment consisted of a single spray per nostril 5 times a day for 3 days prior to rhinovirus inoculation and for 5 days afterward. Of those patients who developed rhinovirus infection following inoculation, administration of the nasal gel had no effect on the total and nasal symptom scores. 29 The results of the most recent clinical trial of the zinc nasal gel formulation were reported by Mossad. in 2003. 15 This trial demonstrated that the same nasal gel formulation, delivering a total daily dose of elemental zinc 2.1 mg, was effective when administered after cold symptoms had been present for 24 to 48 hours. As in the study by Hirt et al., 28 the patients used the nasal gel four times a day until their symptoms resolved and rated their symptoms on a 4-point scale twice daily. 15 The zinc nasal gel significantly reduced the median duration of symptoms from 6 days with placebo to 4.3 days, a difference of 1.7 days (P = .002). Treatment with the spray gel also significantly reduced the time to resolution of all but one cold symptom by 1.3 days (P = .006). In addition to its effect on symptom duration, zinc nasal gel also significantly reduced the time to resolution of nasal drainage and congestion, hoarseness, and sore throat by 1.5 to 2.0 days (P \u2264 .05). Scores for nasal symptoms in patients treated with the zinc nasal gel were significantly lower than those in patients treated with the placebo nasal gel on days 3 through 8; similarly, scores for throat symptoms were significantly lower on days 2 through 4.",

The more common adverse effects in clinical trials of the lozenge and nasal spray formulations included headache, dry mouth and/or throat, taste alteration, nasal irritation or burning, and mild gastrointestinal complaints. 1, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] In studies of the zinc nasal gel formulation, the type and incidence of adverse effects were similar in the zinc and placebo groups. Nasal tingling, stinging, or burning sensation was the most frequently reported adverse event, but patients reported no cases of dry mouth or throat or altered sense of taste. 15, 28, 29 Although isolated, anecdotal reports in the lay media have alleged an association between the use of zinc nasal gel and the onset of anosmia, in no clinical trial of intranasal zinc gluconate gel has there been a single report of lost or diminished smell. In at least once instance, this association was based on findings from 1930s-era studies evaluating the nasal administration of an entirely different compound-zinc sulfate-for polio prevention. 32 Zinc sulfate is a mineral salt that reacts with water to produce sulfuric acid and zinc oxide. By comparison, zinc gluconate is a weak organic salt that dissolves to form positively charged zinc ions and negatively charged gluconate-a naturally occurring, nontoxic compound found in all human tissues.",

Pharmacists are likely to receive inquiries from patients regarding the safety and efficacy of zinc for the common cold. As discussed in this report, evidence exists to support the therapeutic effect of zinc when started early in the course of a cold, ideally in the prodromal period. Pharmacists should reassure patients of zinc's safety when used at dosages consistent with product labeling. Adverse effects are mild and are generally confined to the gastrointestinal tract. Patients should be counseled to begin zinc at the very first sign of cold symptoms, ideally within 24 hours of onset of cold symptoms. Zinc products should be continued until symptoms resolve or until otherwise advised by a physician.
