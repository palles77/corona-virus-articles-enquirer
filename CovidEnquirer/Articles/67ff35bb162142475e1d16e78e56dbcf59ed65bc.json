Given its rapid spread 27 across the world and huge implications for public health, it is urgent to understand whether non-case-based inter-28 ventions can mitigate, delay or even prevent a COVID-19 epidemic. One strategy is a broader-scale contact rate 29 reduction enforced by governments which was used during previous outbreaks, e.g., the 1918 influenza pandemic and 30 the 2009 influenza A/H1N1 pandemic in Mexico. Alternatively, governments and media may stimulate self-imposed 31 prevention measures (handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing) by generating awareness about COVID-32 19, especially when economic and societal consequences are taken into account. Both of these strategies may have 33 a significant impact on the outbreak dynamics. Currently, there are no comparative studies that investigate their 34 viability for controlling a COVID-19 epidemic.",

Our analyses also highlight 41 the importance of spreading awareness about COVID-19 in the population, as the impact of self-imposed measures 42 is strongly dependent on it. When awareness spreads fast, simple self-imposed measures such as handwashing are 43 more effective than short-term government intervention. Self-imposed measures do not only diminish and postpone 44 the peak number of diagnoses, but they can prevent a large epidemic altogether when their efficacy is sufficiently 45 high (about 50%). Qualitatively, these results will allow public health professionals to compare interventions for 46 designing effective outbreak control policies.",

            "text": "developed a deterministic compartmental model describing SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a population stratified 100 by disease status (Figure 1). In the baseline model, individuals are classified as susceptible (S), latently infected (E), 101 infectious with mild or no symptoms (I M ), infectious with severe symptoms (I S ), diagnosed and isolated (I D ), and 102 recovered (R M and R S after an infection with mild and severe symptoms, respectively). Susceptible individuals (S) 103 can become latently infected (E) through contact with infectious individuals (I M and I S ) with the force of infection 104 dependent on the fractions of the population in I M and I S . A proportion of the latently infected individuals (E) 105 will go to the I M compartment, and the remaining E individuals will go to the I S compartment. We assume that 106 infectious individuals with mild symptoms (I M ) do not require medical attention, recover undiagnosed and are not 107 conscious of having contracted the infection (R M ). Individuals with severe symptoms (I S ) are diagnosed and know 108 their disease status when they are detected. After detection, they are kept in isolation (I D ) until recovery (R S ). 109 Diagnosed individuals are assumed to be perfectly isolated, and, hence, neither contribute to transmission nor to 110 the contact process. Recovered individuals (R M and R S ) cannot be reinfected. The infectivity of individuals with 111 mild symptoms is lower than the infectivity of individuals with severe symptoms. Natural birth and death processes 112 are neglected as the time scale of the epidemic is short compared to the mean life span of individuals. However, 113 severely symptomatic patients in isolation may be removed from the population due to disease-associated mortality. 114 Transmission model with disease-awareness 115 In the extended model with disease-awareness, the population is stratified not only by the disease status but also by 116 the awareness status into disease-aware (S a , E a , I a M , I a S , I a D , and R a M ) and disease-unaware (S, E, I M , I S , and R M ) 117 (Figure 2 A).

The blue lines correspond to the latter model where disease awareness induces the uptake of handwashing with an efficacy of 30%. Epidemic dynamics 191 All self-imposed measures and government-imposed social distancing have an effect on the COVID-19 epidemic 192 dynamics. The qualitative and quantitative impact, however, depends strongly on the prevention measure and 193 the rate of awareness spread. The baseline model predicts 46 diagnoses per 1000 individuals at the peak of the 194 epidemic, an attack rate of about 16% and the time to the peak of about 5.2 months (red line, Figure 3 A and 195 B). In the absence of prevention measures, the spread of disease awareness reduces the peak number of diagnoses 196 by 20% but has only a minor effect on the attack rate and peak timing (orange line, Figure 3 A and B). This is 197 expected, as disease-aware individuals with severe symptoms seek health care sooner and therefore get diagnosed 198 faster causing fewer new infections as compared to the baseline model. Awareness dynamics coupled with the use 199 of self-imposed prevention measures has an even larger impact on the epidemic. The blue line in Figure 3 A shows 200 the epidemic curve for the scenario when disease-aware individuals use handwashing as self-imposed prevention 201 measure.
