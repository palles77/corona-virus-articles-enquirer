However, its ability to inhibit Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) replication has not yet been studied. The present study was designed to investigate the antiviral activity of pentoxifylline against JEV in vitro and in vivo. The activity of pentoxifylline against JEV was evaluated in vitro using cytopathic effect inhibition and plaque reduction assays. Pentoxifylline was able to inhibit JEV replication in a dose-dependent manner at a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of 50.3 g/mL (0.00018 M) and a therapeutic index (TI) of 10. Experiments to study the mechanism of antiviral action of pentoxifylline using in vitro translation of viral mRNA suggested that the drug did not interfere either with early or late protein synthesis but most likely exerted its action on virus assembly and/or release. Furthermore, the in vivo study showed that pentoxifylline at a concentration of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg body weight was able to protect completely mice challenged with 50 \u00d7 50% lethal dose (LD 50 ) of JEV.",

All mice were observed for a period of 45 days for loss or gain in weight and other evidence of toxicity compared with the untreated normal mice. The therapeutic potential of pentoxifylline was then evaluated using a peripheral challenge model as described previously [10] . Briefly, 50 \u00d7 50% lethal dose (LD 50 ) of JEV was injected intraperitoneally into four groups of 4-week-old mice (n = 4) and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was breached 2 h later using 1% sterile starch. This was followed by intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of pentoxifylline (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg body weight) twice daily into three groups of mice for 12 days. A fourth group of mice (n = 4) served as 'no drug controls'. A fifth group of mice (n = 4) served as sham controls and received MEM intraperitoneally and starch intracerebrally. Mice were observed every day for 20 days post infection for the appearance of symptoms and death. At the end of the observation period the mice that survived the infection were sacrificed and their brains were harvested and subjected to JEV antigen detection by IFA, virus nucleic acid detection by real-time PCR and virus isolation as described previously [10] .",

These observations raise the possibility that a compound capable of blocking TNF\u2423 could reduce the severity of JEV infection. Pentoxifylline is a known inhibitor of TNF\u2423 production [16] .

In the absence of such information, we asked two crucial questions pertaining to the antiviral activity of pentoxifylline. (i) What is the probable stage at which pentoxifylline inhibits virus replication? And (ii) how late can addition of pentoxifylline to infected cells be delayed to achieve complete inhibition of virus replication? To answer these questions, we used an experimental approach similar to that described by Baginiski et al. [18] . Pentoxifylline was added at 2-h intervals post infection until the completion of one replicative cycle of JEV. It appeared that pentoxifylline was able to inhibit JEV replication very late in the replication cycle. This assumption is based on several findings obtained in this study: (i) the presence of cell-bound antigen detected by IFA at all time points (Fig. 3A) suggests that protein translation is unaffected by the drug; (ii) the presence of a 50 kDa in vitro translation product (Fig. 4) obtained at both 4 h and 10 h post infection further affirmed that translation of viral proteins was unaffected by the drug; and (iii) neither infectious virus nor soluble viral antigen could be detected (Fig. 3B ) in the supernatant of drug-treated cells until 14-h post infection. Taken together, these three observations suggest that pentoxifylline was indeed able to inhibit JEV replication at a stage beyond viral translation, probably interfering with assembly and/or release of the virion. Had pentoxifylline interfered with early or late protein translation, detection of JEV antigen by IFA in drug-treated cells would not have been possible (Fig. 3A) .",

Indeed, this drug at concentrations of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg body weight was able to protect mice completely against a lethal challenge (50\u00d7 LD 50 ) of JEV. Although viral RNA was demonstrated in the brains of all drug-treated mice that survived JEV infection, there were no classical signs of illness observed in any of the mice. This indicates that the virus crossed the BBB following i.p. injection but failed to replicate in the presence of the compounds since there was no viral antigen demonstrable in the brain smears of drug-treated mice. To ascertain that the viral RNA detected in the brain was not due to persistence of infection, virus isolation was carried out using a C6/36 monolayer. It was observed that all the mice that survived the infection failed to demonstrate replicating virus. This indicates the lack of infectious virus in the brains of mice that survived treatment with pentoxifylline. Notwithstanding these observations, it must be emphasised that pentoxifylline is a potent inhibitor of TNF [16] . Recently, it has been reported that JEV induces apoptosis in cell lines via the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway [19] . The underlying mechanism of neuronal apoptosis in JEV has been attributed to the role of the tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily [20] . Therefore, it is also possible that apart from exhibiting anti-JEV activity, pentoxifylline could have also modulated the TNF responses and protected mice against lethal challenge. However, further studies are warranted to investigate the immunomodulatory role of pentoxifylline in JEV infection.",
