Thus, it is quite obvious to expect that in coming decades there will be an even greater number of new chlorine-containing pharmaceuticals in market. Chlorinated compounds represent the family of compounds promising for use in medicinal chemistry. This review describes the recent advances in the synthesis of chlorine containing heterocyclic compounds as diverse biological agents and drugs in the pharmaceutical industries for the inspiration of the discovery and development of more potent and effective chlorinated drugs against numerous death-causing diseases.",

And it has been tremendous sprite in pharmaceuticals as the major key ingredients in drugs to treat many diseases such as meningitis, cholera, plague, typhoid, bacterial skin infections, respiratory and nervous system problems etc., as per the Business Wire and A Berkshire Hathaway Company reports. The therapeutics and percentage of sales were presented to address the importance of chlorine chemistry in pharmaceutical drugs as what have been reported by HIS Applied Economics, Canada (Table 1 ). In United States, more than 88% of the pharmaceuticals were depended on chlorine chemistry including the drugs those have been used for the treatment of stomach ulcer, cancer, anemia, high cholesterol, depression, and epilepsy. As per statistics, the benefit from the chlorine chemistry was estimated to $450 billion per year. The net gain of the pharmaceuticals in the U.S. and Canada using chlorine is as high as $640 billion per year from the health care system reported by HIS Applied Economics, Canada [1] . According to the Business Wire and A Berkshire Hathaway Company reports, the estimating chlorine market for the period of 2018e2023 is approximately 4.8%. Some of the drugs presented with chemical structures containing chlorine (number of groups are different). One of the studies detailed that, 163 compounds among 233 approved drugs; nearly 73% of them contained single chlorine atom [2] . Of which, 23% of them possessed by two chlorines, 2.6% of them possessed by three chlorine atoms, 1.4% of them possessed by four chlorines, and 2.5% of them possessed by six chlorines in the compounds. Surprisingly, none of the drugs had been approved with five chlorine atoms yet. Also, among them, 98% were monosubstituted (CCl), only four were disubstituted (CCl 2 ), and none of the approved drugs has trisubstituted (CCl 3 ) groups. This interesting research gap suggests that, chlorine will further continue its industry ruler role to provide and benefit consumers of the pharmaceuticals in the future [1] . To improve the quality and advantage of chlorinated chemistry, scientists need to an advance understanding of the chlorine in the view of medicinal chemistry in the future (see Table 2 ).",

Over the course of time it has been found empirically that the introduction of a chlorine atom into one or more specific positions of a biologically active molecule may substantially improve the intrinsic biological activity [6] . The properties of the carbon-chlorine bond (C-Cl) in organochlorines have been analysed by Henschler [4, 5] . However, in the low-molecular-weight chemicals investigated in that analysis, the electrophilic reactivity of the carbon centre adjacent to the chlorine atom, which facilitates displacement of chlorine by (bio) nucleophiles, determines the observed biological properties [4, 5] . The increase of lipophilicity of the whole molecule by a chlorine substituent leads to a higher partitioning of a chlorinated compound into the lipophilic phase of a cell membrane or lipophilic domains of a protein. This causes a higher local concentration of the compound near a biological target site, but, not necessarily a higher biological activity. The most important effect of a non-reactive chlorine atom in the biological activity of many compounds comes from chlorine as a substituent on an aromatic, heteroaromatic or olefinic moiety.",

This in turn may cause a tighter interaction or a loosening of the contacts to the amino acids close to the chlorine or in other parts of the active molecule. Either one may affect the function of the target protein and cause an increase or decrease of biological activity. In other cases however a chlorine substituent may have no specific effect on the primary biological properties of the molecule to which it is attached [7] . Chlorinated compounds are not necessarily toxic or dangerous. Highly reactive chemicals or polychlorinated compounds cannot be compared with regard to toxicological properties with unreactive compounds having a low degree of chlorination. The chlorine atom, as one of many possible substituents used in synthetic organic chemistry, will remain in the future one of the important tools for probing structure-activity relationships in life science research and as a molecular component in commercialized compounds, in order to provide safer, more selective and more environmentally compatible products with higher activity for medicine and agriculture [7] .",

The syntheses of new series of target compounds 192a-w was showed in Scheme 13. The starting materials 190a-l were reacted with phenylpropiolaldehyde diethyl acetal in the presence of PTSA in ethanol under reflux conditions to yield 2-(2-alkylthiobenzenesulfonyl)-3-(phenylprop-2-ynylideneamino)guanidines 191a-l in moderate to good yields. All the synthesized compounds 191a-l underwent CuI mediated electrophilic cyclizations of a, b-alkynic hydrazones, unfortunately, this step did not provided the desired derivatives but led to copper complexes with pyrazole moiety. In another way, treatment of compounds 191a-i with 20% PTSA under the optimal reaction conditions afforded the final compounds 192a-w. Magar and co-workers synthesized a series of novel benzofuran substituted hybrids and screened for their in vitro anti-proliferative activity. Usually the target compound 203 was synthesized in three simple steps. In the first step, three different chlorine-substituted pyridinium iodide salts (199) were synthesized in good yields by the heating of corresponding aryl methyl ketones (198) in the presence of iodine and pyridine at 140 C for 3 h. In the second step, Al 2 O 3 catalyzed condensation reaction was applied to prepare six aryl benzofuran-3(2H)-ones 202 by condensing benzofuran-3(2H)one (200) with aryl aldehydes 201 in methylene chloride for 3 h at room temperature. Finally, a modified Kr\u20ac ohnke pyridine synthetic method [40] was used to synthesize the target compounds 203. A mixture of aryl benzofuran-3(2H)-ones 202, pyridinium iodide salts (199) and NH 4 OAc in glacial acetic acid was heated at 100 C for 12e24 h to afford compound 203 (Scheme 15) in considerable yields. All the synthesized compounds were evaluated for in vitro topoisomerase I and II inhibition and anti-proliferative activity. Compound 203 exhibited more potent anti-proliferative activity than the positive control etoposide against HCT15 (IC 50 \u00bc 5.47 mM) and T47D (IC 50 \u00bc 7.47 mM) cell line. The SAR results suggested that, the chlorinated compounds showed better anti-proliferative activity than those of corresponding non-chlorinated compounds. The chlorination at the 2-phenyl ring is important to inhibit the topo I and II activity. These results provided useful information for the development of benzofuro[3,2-b]pyridine derivatives as a novel class of topoisomerase-targeted anticancer agents [41] .",

According to the estimated data obtained in 2010, around 285 million peoples were suffered from diabetes all over the world and it may increase to 439 million by 2030 [69, 70] . Blood glucose changing due to the insulin resistance is regarded as the feature of being diabetic in 95% of the cases [71] which give raise to several problems like high blood pressure, heart problem, kidney failure, stroke and blindness [72] . Consequently, the inhibition of aglucosidase (EC. 3.2.1.20) , a key carbohydrate hydrolyzing enzyme, could serve as an effective methodology in both preventing and treating diabetes through controlling the postprandial glucose level and suppressing postprandial hyperglycemia [73] . a-Glucosidase specifically performs the hydrolysis of a-glucopyranoside bond, resulting in the production of a -D-glucose from the non-reducing end of the sugar [74] . Several a-glucosidase inhibitors like acarbose, voglibose, and miglitol, have appeared in clinic for the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus [75] , however, number and intensity of side effects call for the development of potent, structurally diverse, safe and efficacious drugs for the effective treatment of diabetes mellitus. a-glucosidase activity. The starting material aniline 265 was reacted with chlorosulfonyl isocyanate under the optimal reaction conditions to yield 6-chloro-substituted 3-oxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-1,2,4-benzothiadiazine 1,1-dioxide 266. Subsequent thionation of the oxo derivatives 266 with phosphorus pentasulfide in pyridine led to the corresponding compound 267. In the next step, compound 268 was prepared from the reaction of thioxo compound 267 with methyl iodide in the presence of sodium hydrogenocarbonate. Finally, compound 268 was treated with isopropyl amine under optimal reaction conditions to obtain final product 269 [77] (Scheme 28). The compound 269 was found to be the most potent glucose-induced insulin secretion with RIS value of 13 mM per 1 mM concentration. The position of the chlorine atom on the benzene ring strongly affected the activity on insulin-secreting cells. Taken as a whole, the rank order of potency of 3isopropylamino-substituted compounds on pancreatic b-cells was found to be 6-chloro \u00bc 6,7-dichloro > 7-chloro > 8-chloro > 5chloro [78] .",

Compound 356 was first o-methylated with trimethylsilyldiazomethane in the presence of DIPEA [123] , followed by saponification of the ester. The free carboxylic acid 357 was coupled with amines using the corresponding acid chloride which was generated from oxalyl chloride. The resulting amides were demethylated with boron trichloride to yield final products 358a-d in moderate yields (Scheme 50).

Compound 358a (EL<SUB>HDL</SUB> IC 50 \u00bc 218 nM) showed good inhibitory activity against the tested endothelial lipase [124] . A novel class of pyridopyrimidinones derivatives have been synthesized by Yu et al. and evaluated the enzyme activity against PI3K and mTOR. In addition, reaction of 7-bromo-4H-pyrido[1,2-a] pyrimidin-4-one 359 with NCS under the optimal reaction conditions provided intermediate 360. Subsequently, chlorinesubstituted 360 reacted with pyridineboronic acid pinacol ester 361 to afford final product 362 (Scheme 51). Compound 362 was evaluated as a novel class of efficacious dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. Compound 362 showed good enzyme activity against PI3K and mTOR (IC 50 (PI3ka/mTOR) \u00bc 3.4/4.7 nM) and potent suppression of Akt and p70s6k phosphorylation in cellular assays.

In this review, we mainly focused on the synthesis of chlorinated drugs, chlorinated drugs as a function of approval date, disease condition, chlorine attachment and structure-activity relationship. We believe that this review article will be useful for inspiring the structural design and developments of less toxic and powerful chlorine-based drugs against the numerous deathcausing diseases.",

Zou et al. have prepared dihydropyridine substituted chalcones and screened for their in vitro anticancer activity against different cell lines. The synthetic protocol was illustrated in Scheme 8. Initially, substituted aldehydes 171 were converted to esters 172 using Wittig-Horner reaction. Then, hydrolysis of 172 led to free acid 173 by using KOH, and compound 173 was reacted with pivaloyl chloride in DMF under the optimal reaction conditions to yield acylchloride 174. Without isolation, compound 174 directly treated with 6-chloro-5,6-dihydro-pyridin-2(1H)-one, base and n-butyllithium to afford compound 175 in good yields (Scheme 8). Compound 175 showed excellent anticancer activity against HT-29 (IC 50 \u00bc 0.92 mM), IC 50 \u00bc 0.47 mM) cell lines. The SAR results revealed that, the presence of EWG, namely chlorine atom, on the dihydropyridine ring would contribute to the enhanced anticancer activity [32]. Park et al. have developed the synthetic route of a large number of pyrazolopyrimidin derivatives from 176 through a two-step reaction. Firstly, compound 176 was reacted with hydrazine hydrate in methanol under reflux conditions for 3 h. After cooled to room temperature, HCl in dichloromethane was added into the reaction mixture at \u00c02 C and then stirred for 13e14 h to yield intermediate compound 177 in moderate yield. The benzylhydrazine 177 was treated with 2-amino-4,6-dichloropyrimi-dine-5-carbaldehyde in the presence of TEA to afford target compounds 178 and 179 (Scheme 9).

Nazarian and co-workers reported the synthesis of a series of novel antileishmanial activity compounds. Firstly, 5-chloro-2hydroxybenzaldehyde 193 was reacted with acrolein in the presence of the base potassium carbonate in dioxane under reflux conditions to obtain intermediate compound chromene-3carbaldehyde 194.

However, there is still a number of derivatives awaiting to be explored to stop the activity of bacteria and further spreading of TB[62,63].Sun et al. have developed a new series of sixteen chiral piperidinol derivatives and screened for their in vitro anti-tuberculosis activity. The synthesis of the chiral piperidinol compounds 251ap or 252a-p were first performed by reacting optically active epoxide intermediate (S)-(\u00fe)-epichlorohydrin (245) or (R)-(\u00c0)-epichlorohydrin (246) with a substituted phenol or thiophenol (247) in acetonitrile under reflux condition in the presence of cesium carbonate to afford chiral epoxide derivative 248 or 249 [64,65]. Subsequently, the crude product 248 or 249 was reacted with 4-[4-chloro-3-(trifluoromethyl)-phenyl]-4-piperidinol (250) in ethanol under reflux condition to afford alcohol diols 251a-p or 252a-p in moderate yields (Scheme 24). Compound 251a was found to be potent anti-tuberculosis activity with MIC values of 1.4 mg/mL, which could be attributed to the presence of electron-withdrawing groups (CF 3 and Cl) [66]. In 2012, Kratky and co-workers have developed a novel class of sulfonamides as potent antimycobacterial activity against M. tuberculosis 331/88, M. avium (330/88) and two strains of M. kansasii (235/80 and 6509/96). The target compounds of sulfonamide derivatives were synthesized in a simple and single step. Sulfonamide 254a-d and substituted aldehydes 253a-d reacted in ethanol under reflux conditions for 3 h and stirred at room temperature for another 12 h to yield final compounds 255a-d at 4 C in good yields (Scheme 25). Compound 255a was found to be the most potent antimycobacterial activity against M. tuberculosis 331/88, M. avium (330/88) and two strains of M. kansasii (235/80 and 6509/ 96) with MIC values ranging between 32 and 62.5 mmol/L[67]. The SAR predicted that the presence of electron-donating group (OH) on the phenyl ring highly enhanced the antimycobacterial activity. Furthermore, the introduction of electron-withdrawing chloro group to the same phenyl ring increases the activity.Shah and co-workers have developed a new series of active antituberculosis agents in one pot synthesis. The final target compounds N-arylamino biquinoline derivatives 259a-x were synthesized from the reaction of 2-chloro-3-formyl quinolines 256, malononitrile 257 with appropriate enhydrazinoketones 258 in absolute ethanol in the presence of base piperidine under optimal reaction conditions (Scheme 26).
