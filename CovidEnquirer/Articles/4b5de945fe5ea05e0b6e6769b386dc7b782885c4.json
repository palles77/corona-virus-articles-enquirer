Using the news framing approach, this study identifies the connections between several national socioeconomic, governance, and environmental traits and the portrayals of climate change. Although climate change is a global issue that affects every country in the world, how the news media frame it varies from country to country. Such a variation is related to each country's economic development, climate severity, and governance. The findings of this study contribute to framing literature by assessing frame use in national contexts, filling in the gap in the application of this theoretical framework.",

Despite the importance of this transnational issue, assessing factors that influence the media message on global warming has been understudied. The present research fills this void. This study uses content analysis to compare media portrayals of climate change in 45 countries and territories from all continents in the world. More importantly, this study examines what roles a nation's socioeconomic and environmental factors (e.g., GDP per capita, loss by natural disasters, and CO2 emission amount among others) play in framing the news on global warming/climate change. This study uses original data obtained by analyzing the content of major publications in each of the 45 countries. Secondary data on the countries' environmental and socioeconomic factors were retrieved from global organizations such as the World Bank, Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, and Global Carbon Atlas.",

For example, at the micro level, Vu (2014) found individual journalists' education can affect journalists' editorial decision-making. Focusing on the meso level, Hackett (1984) suggested that journalistic routines, strategies, and expectations affect media content, causing bias in the news. Maslog et al. (2006) examined how news media from five Asian countries cover of the Iraq War to discover that religion plays an important role in shaping news content. Specifically, media from non-Muslim countries had stronger war journalism framing than those from Muslim nations. Saguy et al.

This study takes a similar approach and investigates the link between socioeconomic and environmental factors of a country where climate change frames are formed. In so doing this research provides better understanding of the framing process, thus expanding its theoretical literature.",

If the most important function of the media is to inform the audience on various social realities, this apathy of the press toward climate change may very well be causing limited understanding of the phenomenon among the public (Nisbet and Myers, 2007) . The mass media have a vital role in shaping the public's understanding of scientific issues (Friedman et al., 1986; Nisbet et al., 2002) . Heightened media attention to scientific issues can influence how science is translated into policy (Boykoff and Rajan, 2007; Hart, 2011; Stromberg, 2001) . The lack of journalism and public concerns on climate change would take away the ability of the media and the public to influence policymaking regarding such an issue.",

Not only are there differences in news volume at different times, how climate change is portrayed in different countries also varies. For example, Zehr (2000) found scientific uncertainty a dominant frame in the discourse of four major U.S. newspapers regarding global warming. Olausson's (2009) analysis of three Swedish newspapers showed that the collective action frame was most popular, and that Swedish media were reluctant to use the frame of uncertainty. Billett's (2010) research on media's portrayal of climate change in India demonstrated a totally contrast picture to that of developed countries. By emphasizing the environmental rather than scientific aspects of climate change the Indian press set up \"a strongly nationalistic position on climate change that divides the issue along both developmental and postcolonial lines\" (Billett, 2010, p. 1) . These studies are often done independently from one another, using different coding schemes, which makes a cross-culture comparison of the media's frame use difficult. The present study overcomes these limitations to provide a big picture of how the media frame climate change in a large scale, by adopting common frames that have been used by studies on this environmental phenomenon.",

For example, skepticism would be a popular frame in the U.S. news media (Nisbet, 2009 ). It would not, however, be pertinent to non-partisan media and political systems. The question: \"What is the story about climate change in the global news media flow\" is an important one as it provides some insights into the overall portrayal of climate change at the global level.

Dirikx and Gelders (2010) , in contrasting the media coverage of climate change between France and the Netherlands, suggested that ideological cultures play an important role in how the media cover the issue. An important point to note here is: scholars have often been more enthusiastic to compare press coverage of climate change between developed nations. Again, developing countries are often left out in the academic focus.

These factors represent different aspects of the sociological ecology of a country in which the news media operate. Schmidt et al. (2013) , for example, argue that environmental factors related to carbon dependency and climate severity influence the amount of press coverage global warming receives. Other studies have also found the effects of national macro factors including economic development and media systems on how the news media cover public affairs issues Vu et al., 2018) . But, to date, no paper has investigated the possible connection between media frames and the aforementioned factors. Theoretically, linking media frame use with such national factors would extend the literature to include contextual aspects in studying frame use, especially for crossnations comparative research.

For example, in the U.S. three newspapers, representing different political ideologies were selected including The New York Times (liberal leaning), Wall Street Journal (conservative leaning), and USA Today (center). A total of 84 publications were selected. Many countries in the sample are developing nations with poor archiving systems of publications. Therefore, for some countries, we could only access one publication (e.g. Tanzania, Sierra Leon, Papua New Guinea among others). Often, those are the most popular newspaper. 1 Media content: All articles containing the keywords \"greenhouse gas,\" \"climate change,\" and/or \"global warming\" or the equivalent of these search terms in the other three languages in either leads or headlines were included.

Basically, its algorithms look for latent patterns of word co-occurrence in a collection of documents and provide outputs as clusters of words that appear together in those documents. These clusters could be inferred as representing the categorization of frame use in the text (Jacobi et al., 2016) . Mallet, a java-based program developed by McCallum (2002) was adopted.

First, all 37,670 articles were used to test the topic modeling on our data. Second, we began with selecting five topics in the outputs. The similarity of topics is calculated using Jaccard similarity. The Jaccard similarity value of sets (topics) is the ratio of the size of the intersection of the sets to the size of the union (Leskovec et al., 2014) . If the Jaccard similarity value between two topics is equal 1.0, they are exactly the same. The lower the Jaccard similarity value between two topics is the more they differ from one another. We then continued to increase the number of topics until no Jaccard similarity value between any two of the topics was higher than 0.4, the cutoff point by topic modeling scholars (Leskovec et al., 2014) . The testing of the data analysis landed us at 20 topics from the content of each of the countries for one year, with each topic being represented by a set of words that co-occurred. The outputs included 20 numerical values of how large each topic was in the content unit. As Jacobi et al. (2016) argued that even with sound mathematical calculations being used to identify the \"right\" number of topics, some of them would still be irrelevant or would not make sense. It is, therefore, \"up to the researcher to interpret the results of the model and to set up the analysis in such a way that the results are useful to the study at hand,\" (Jacobi et al., 2016, p. 2) .",

Coders were instructed to look for words or catchphrases representing each of the frames. The list of frames to code included (1) Scientific Evidence (e.g., scientific, research, existence, researcher, study, evidence, scientist, panel, etc.); (2) Energy (e.g., oil, fuel, energy, coal, gas, electricity, wind power, green energy, renewable, etc.) Natural Impact (e.g., melting, temperature, glaciers, sea-level, weather, storm, disaster, habitats, species, etc.,); Economic Impact (e.g., financial, cost, businesses, market, tax, debt, budget, loss of harvest, tourism, etc.); Domestic Politics/Regulatory Process (e.g., national security, policy, party, conservative, voting, greenhouse gases, politics, policymaking, law, regulation, etc.); International Relations (e.g., U.N. conferences; bilateral, multi-lateral, partnership, intergovernmental, cabinet, treaties, foreign, aid, COP, agreements, etc.,); Social Progress, (e.g., saving, lifestyle, children, environmental, eco-living, ecological, water, forest, environmental-friendly, educational, green, lifestyle etc.).

The media from richer countries are more likely to frame climate change as an issue of domestic politics. This, perhaps, is because the voice of climate skeptics in richer countries gained stronger prominence in the media (Boykoff and Rajan, 2007) . In these countries, climate change is a highly contested issue with multiple groups, in their efforts of politicizing climate change, trying to influence the media agenda and policymaking. Additionally, the balanced reporting norm in the media in some democratic countries may have compelled journalists to include various views on climate change, thus affecting the public's and decision makers' perception of climate change. Such reporting practices also give a possible explanation as to why the media in countries with higher GDP are more likely to frame climate change as a domestic politics issue (Boykoff and Boykoff, 2004; 2007) . The news media from richer countries tend to frame climate change as a scientific issue. This finding makes sense as wealthier countries have more financial resources devoted to scientific research on climate change. News content from poorer countries, however, is more likely to emphasize the international relations and natural impact aspects of climate change. These are developing countries, where resources to mitigate the effects of climate change are sparse. Thus, they need international support in dealing with this transnational environmental phenomenon. The media portrayal of climate change has, therefore, reflected this reality.",

Specifically, socioeconomic, environmental, and political aspects of a nation can influence how the media cover an issue. It contributes to the framing literature by identifying factors that shape frame use in the news, an area that has often been neglected in framing media research. Results of this study show that although such influences at meso (e.g., organization) and micro levels (e.g., individual journalists) are often more apparent and have been empirically proven, framing process needs to be assessed in a wider political, social, economic and social context in which media messages are constructed. Scholars have acknowledged the important role of the media in interpreting and spreading information on scientific, social, and political issues. How the media frame climate change has presumably affected the public knowledge of climate change. Finding out what factors influence the framing process of this natural phenomenon is therefore important in understanding the cultural politics of it.",

It could have investigated the media from more countries in the world to see whether suppositions of the influence of national traits on media coverage of climate change still hold. It could have included more national socioeconomic and environmental factors as independent variables to find out about their predictability on how the press frames climate change. Future studies should examine such an issue with more types of news media from countries. The use of broad issue-specific frames did not provide nuanced understanding of sub-national differences in media framing. Subsequent investigations should consider using a different way to operationalize frames to take into account these differences.",

            "text": "The theoretical implications of this study are significant. Framing theorists have, for long, argued that framing happens or media messages are constructed within a specific social, cultural, political and economic context (Carragee & Roefs, 2006; Entman, 1993; Scheufele, 1999) . Such a context is also helpful for frames to be understood by the message receivers and thus to have effects. However, previous framing research, especially comparative quantitative ones, has failed to empirically assess the relationships between macro factors of a nation and the use of media frames in the country. This presents a theoretical and methodological gap in the literature of this widely used theoretical framework. This study, however, contributes to filling in that gap by investigating the influence of factors representing the wider political, economic and cultural environment of a nation and the media framing process. Results of this research demonstrate that macro factors (e.g., level of development) should be taken into account to better fathom how the media frame an issue. The incorporation of these factors would allow for better explanation of framing, putting this journalistic practice in a context where various types of influence could affect the construction of media messages. Methodologically, through its use of national structural variables, this study suggests a unique approach to operationalizing the long-time assumption in framing literature that the macro political and economic factors affect how media messages are formed. In terms of climate change, investigating the influence of these structural variables on the media coverage of the issue helps discern the dynamic of powers in addressing this global environmental phenomenon.",
