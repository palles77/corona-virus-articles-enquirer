From early October 2013, Saudi Arabia will be hosting millions of Muslims from different parts of the world who travel to Saudi Arabia to participate in the Hadj. However, since November 2012, Saudi Arabia has also hosted a new fatal viral infection: the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).",

The first known occurrence of MERS-CoV in human was reported in a patient with severe acute respiratory infection in April 2012, in Jordan. 2 Later, person-to-person transmission was reported, 3 which is very important because it might result in a switch from aborted outbreaks to a pandemic, which was probably the case for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus outbreak in 2003-2004.",

The age of the affected patients ranged from 14 months to 94 years (median, 50 years). The incubation period of the infection is estimated at 1 week, based on the available data. 4 MERS-CoV has a high mortality rate of almost 50%, and thus the possibility of a pandemic is worrying. Soon after pilgrims return home, they hold ceremonies and invite relatives and friends to celebrate their return from Hadj, which provide further opportunities for the spread of the virus.",

The total risk may not be very high, but, considering the devastating outcome for the Middle East in particular, and world at large, it would be wise to take into account even minute risks and take all possible safety precautions into action.",
