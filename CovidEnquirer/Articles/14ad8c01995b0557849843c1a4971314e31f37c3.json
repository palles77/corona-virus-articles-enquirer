Clinical signs in PEDV infected pigs include severe diarrhea and vomiting leading to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance and death. Before 2013, PEDV was seen only in Asian and European swine herds (Huang et al., 2013; Song and Park, 2012) . The PEDV belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus in the subfamily Coronavirinae (Marthaler et al., 2013) . It has a 28-kb, single stranded, positive sense RNA genome, which is predicted to encode at least seven ORFs in the following order: ORF1a, ORF1b, spike (S), ORF3, envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N). The spike gene is the most diverse gene (Chen et al., 2013) . Currently, two types of PEDV strains are identified in the US: (1) the original highly virulent US PEDV (Stevenson et al., 2013) ; and (2) the S INDEL PEDV which has insertions and deletions in the Nterminal region of the S protein, with reportedly milder disease in the field (Vlasova et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014) .",

For example, a susceptible and robust cell culture system is needed to evaluate disinfection efficiency based on PEDV infectivity in vitro. There are previous reports of successful propagation of several non-US PEDV strains using Vero cells and trypsin in the medium (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988; Kusanagi et al., 1992; Song et al., 2003) . Shirato et al. (2011) recently reported that trypsin promotes PEDV virion release from infected Vero cells. However, despite numerous reports on detection of PEDV by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and sequence analysis (Cima, 2013; Huang et al., 2013; Marthaler et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014) , there is only a single report on the successful propagation of the original highly virulent US PEDV strains (Chen et al., 2014) . Therefore, we attempted to propagate PEDV from 88 PEDV-positive field samples (63, 14, and 11 intestinal contents, fecal and serum samples, respectively) using Vero cells supplemented with trypsin. We successfully isolated and serially passaged nine US PEDV strains. These PEDV strains showed three distinct genetic profiles in the partial S protein region based on genomic sequence analysis.",

PC177 strain showed a shorter PCR product (860 bp) compared to those of the other 8 PEDV strains (approximately 1500 bp) (Fig. 3) . (Figs. 4 and 5) . Further analysis indicated that the major differences among strains were mainly in the N-terminal region of the S protein (aa 1-388 according to USA/Colorado/2013 strain, GenBank accession no. KF272920) (Fig. 6) . Based on the analysis of this region, the nine strains were distributed between two major distinct clusters: (1) a major cluster [PC22A, PC168, PC170, PC173, PC177, PC180, PC182, and PC21A (PE103)], similar to the original highly virulent US PEDV strains, i.e., Colorado/2013; and (2) Iowa106 strain (PV39), similar to S INDEL US PEDV strain, OH851 (Genbank accession no. KJ399978) . Based on the partial S protein amino acid sequence alignment, PEDV strains PC22A, PC168, and PC170, which were collected from different farms, were identical, and those of PC173, PC180, PC182, and PC21A (PE103) had only one or two amino acid residue differences (data not shown). The PC177 had a large (197 aa) deletion in the N-terminal portion of the S protein compared to PC22A strain. Additionally, S INDEL Iowa106 strain (PV39) had minor insertions (2 aa) and deletions (5 aa) in comparison to the virulent PC22A strain, consistent with its designation as an S INDEL strain as previously reported (Fig. 6) (Vlasova et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014) .",

Despite the 197 aadeletion in the S protein, the PC177 strain grew in Vero cells to similar titers to those of other PEDV strains ( Table 1 ), suggesting that this region is dispensable for virus infection/replication in Vero cells.

Intestinal contents may be a better source for PEDV isolation because no PEDV was isolated from feces and serum in our study, although other factors may affect virus isolation in Vero cell cultures. Cell toxicity was observed for 6 intestinal content samples collected from field cases, and for two samples from the experimentally infected gnotobiotic and one conventional pig intestinal contents. Among the nine successfully isolated PEDV strains, eight PEDV strains could be isolated under ''Inoc (+)'' condition. Among the eight strains, only one strain (PC180 and PC179 were from the same pig) grew under both ''Inoc (+)'' and ''Inoc (\u00c0)'' conditions. No strain was isolated under ''Inoc (\u00c0)'' condition only except for PC177 which contains a 197 aa-deletion in the S protein. These results indicate that multiple factors, such as the type of sample, virus titer, substances in intestinal contents, and strain-specific factors may affect virus isolation. Using different Vero cell lines and culture conditions may improve PEDV isolation rates from clinical samples.",

Compared to PC22A strain, PC177 has a large 197aa deletion (highlighted in gray bar) and Iowa106 (PV39) has a minor insertion and deletion compared to the PC22A strain. Deletion is labeled as ''\u00c0''. The conserved amino acid residues among the 11 or 10 (except for PC177) representative strains are labeled as ''*'' or ''#''. respectively (Fig. 6) . These results suggest that the current PEDV strains detected in the US differ from the European and Asian vaccine strains in this region. The PEDV strains starting with ''MKS'' were also reported from China [AH2012, XS2013, CHGS, CH-ZMDZY-11 and CH-FJND strains clustered together with US highly virulent PEDV strain (Colorado/2013), and CH-HBQX-10, JS2004-2, JS120103 and DX clustered together with US reportedly mild PEDV S INDEL strain OH851] (Fig. 5) , suggesting global circulation of these two types of strains at least in the US and China. Interestingly, the KNU-0802 strain found in South Korea clustered together with the US highly virulent strains with ''MRS'' in the beginning of the spike and differed from the strains reported from the US and China. We did not detect the large S deletion in the original PC177 sample, but the large deletion was detected in the first (P0) cell culture passage under ''Inoc (\u00c0)'' conditions (Materials and Methods). There are at least two possible explanations: (1) a minor proportion of PEDV strains that contained this large S deletion was initially present in the original PC177 sample and was more replication competent in Vero cells; or (2) the large S deletion occurred during the initial Vero cell culture via an unknown mechanism. The former possibility is consistent with the recognition that coronaviruses exist naturally as quasispecies or mixed populations of strains (Zhang et al., 2007) . However, we did not detect the large S deletion in the original PC177 sample by using deep genome sequencing (data not shown), indicating the large S deletion occurred during cell adaptation. It is important to further investigate if the large S deletion strains circulate naturally in US swine by using the primer sets we designed in this study.",

            "text": "The pathogenicity of the major highly virulent US PEDV cluster strains has been reported recently (Jung et al., 2014; Stevenson et al., 2013) . Pathogenesis studies of different PEDV isolates may aid in identification of mild/ attenuated PEDV strains, which can be used for the development of attenuated PEDV vaccines. Interestingly, the deletion location and size identified in the PC177 strain is similar to that in other porcine coronaviruses: the TGEVmutant PRCV-ISU-1 strain has a 227 aa-deletion in the Nterminal portion of the S protein (Zhang et al., 2007) and as a result has a different tissue tropism (respiratory infection) and produces an attenuated disease compared to the parental TGEV strain (Saif et al., 2012) . Although PC177 was isolated from a diarrheic fecal sample, it is important to test whether the PC177 strain also possesses respiratory or dual (pneumo-enteric) tropism and shows reduced virulence.",

The S gene primer set designed in this study can be used for identification of different PEDV strains from field samples. The highly virulent PEDV has now spread throughout North America and also in Asia, despite the availability of inactivated and attenuated PEDV vaccines, CV777 in China and DR13 in Korean, respectively. Therefore, it is important to investigate PEDV variants currently circulating in these countries, to assess their ability to cross-protect against highly virulent PEDV strains and to find ways to prevent and control PEDV epidemics.",
