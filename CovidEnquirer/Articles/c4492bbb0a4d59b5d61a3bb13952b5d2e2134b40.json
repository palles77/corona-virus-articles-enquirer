This vaccine provided remarkable protective efficacy in mouse model compared to the BCG. This vaccine also provided therapeutic efficacy against multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extremely drug resistant TB (XDR-TB) in murine models. Furthermore, we extended our studies to a cynomolgus monkey model, which is currently the best animal model of human tuberculosis. This novel vaccine provided a higher level of the protective efficacy than BCG based upon the assessment of mortality. The BCG prime and HSP65+IL-12/HVJ vaccine (boost) by the prime-boost method showed a synergistic prophylactic effect in the monkey. Furthermore, this vaccine exerted therapeutic efficacy (100% survival) and augmentation of immune responses in the TB-infected monkeys.HVJ-Envelope/HSP65 DNA+IL-12 DNA vaccine increased the body weight of TB-infected monkeys, improved the ESR, and augmented the immuneresponses (proliferation of PBL and IL-2 production). The enhancement of IL-2 production from monkeys treated with this vaccine was correlated with the therapeutic efficacy of the vaccine. These data indicate that our novel DNA vaccine might be useful against Mycobacterium tuberculosis including XDR-TB and MDR-TB for human therapeutic clinical trials.",

            "text": "Tuberculosis is a major global threat to human health, with about 2 million people dying every year from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) infection. The only tuberculosis vaccine currently available is an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis BCG (BCG), although its efficacy against adult TB disease remains controversial. Furthermore, multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extremely drug resistant TB (XDR-TB) are becoming big problems in the world. In such circumstances, the development of therapeutic vaccine against TB as well as prophylactic vaccine against TB is required. Therefore, we have recently developed a novel TB vaccine, a DNA vaccine expressing mycobacterial heat shock protein 65 (HSP65) and interleukin-12 (IL-12) delivered by the hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ)-liposome or HVJ-envelope (HSP65 + IL-12/HVJ) [1, 2] . The HSP65 + IL-12/HVJ vaccine using HVJ-envelope was 10,000 fold more efficient than BCG in the murine TB-prophylactic model. A nonhuman primate model of TB will provide information for vaccine development. In fact, in the previous study we evaluated the protective efficacy of HSP65 + IL-12/HVJ in the cynomolgus monkey model, which is an excellent model of human tuberculosis [1, 4] . In the present study, we observed the synergistic effect of the HSP65 + IL-12/HVJ and BCG using a prime-boost method in the TB-infected cynomolgus monkeys. The combination of the two vaccines showed a very strong prophylactic efficacy against M. tuberculosis (100% survival) as we have seen previously in the murine model of TB [2, 5] . Moreover, we evaluated therapeutic effect of this vaccine on the MDR-TB infection and XDR-TB infection in murine and monkey models, indicating that the vaccine exerts therapeutic efficacy against TB, MDR-TB and XDR-TB. This vaccine exerted strong therapeutic efficacy (100% survival) and augmentation of immune responses in the TB-infected monkeys. Moreover, the combination of Ag85A DNA, Ag85B DNA and MPT51 DNA vaccine augmented the therapeutic efficacy of this HSP65 DNA + IL12 DNA vaccine.",

It is very important to evaluate the long survival period in a monkey model, as human TB is a chronic infection disease. Furthermore, the decrease in the body weight of TB patients is usually accompanied by a progression of the disease. [10] DNA vaccines are a relatively new approach to immunization for infectious diseases. [1, 2, 5, [11] [12] [13] [14] Prophylactic and therapeutic DNA vaccines were established by using several kinds of vectors such as (1) HVJ-liposome, (2) HVJ-envelope, (3) adenovirus vector, (4) adeno-associated virus vector (AAV), (5) lenti-virus vector. [1, 3, 9] We have developed a hemagglutinating virus of Japan envelope (HVJ-Envelope) using inactivated Sendai virus, as a nonviral vector for drug delivery. [15] [16] [17] It can deliver very efficiently DNA, siRNA, proteins and anti-cancer drugs into cells both in vitro and in vivo. [15, 18, 19] Therefore, HVJ-Envelope was used as an efficient and safe vector for DNA vaccine against TB in the present study.",
