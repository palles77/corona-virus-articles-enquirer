In addition to their energetic and structural roles in living systems, their role when covalently linked to proteins is critically important in a myriad of molecular recognition processes. Viruses frequently use a glycan shield as a tool to evade the immune system, making glycoproteins the focus of intense interest for vaccinology initiatives targeting these viruses (Astronomo and Burton, 2010) . Glycoproteins have historically been difficult to study structurally due to difficulties in overexpressing properly glycosylated proteins as well as their innate flexibility. Indeed, carbohydrates are frequently removed for crystallization studies (Derewenda, 2004) . Despite these challenges, several thousand glycoprotein crystal structures have been determined. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) have allowed structural studies on previously intractable glycoproteins (Walls et al., 2016a; Walls et al., 2016b; Lyumkis et al., 2013) . However, the vast majority of glycoprotein structures suffer from the fact that the resolution of the electron density or electron potential maps for the carbohydrate chains is too limited to allow for accurate atomic modeling of individual glycan moieties. As a result, the implementation of prior knowledge is necessary to obtain reliable and stereochemically realistic structural models.",

The potential for widespread erroneous carbohydrate structural analysis is increasing with the rise of cryoEM as a near-atomic-resolution structural technique, as exemplified by the numerous recent structures solved with unrealistic high-energy ring conformations (Agirre et al., 2015a) . These observations emphasize the inadequacy and underutilization of available tools and highlight the need for the development of dedicated algorithms for glycoprotein structural refinement. To address this issue, we aimed to create a tool for the automatic detection and refinement of glycan coordinates while resolving incorrect starting glycan conformations.",

The approach builds upon previous Rosetta-based structure determination tools guided by low-resolution experimental data (Frenz et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2015) and makes use of a previously developed framework for modeling of carbohydrates (Labonte et al., 2017) . Compared with previous glycan refinement methods (Agirre, 2017b; Gristick et al., 2017) , our approach (1) uses a physically realistic force field to ensure glycan geometry remains correct even under large conformational changes, and (2) adds the ability to change the anomer of the glycan. These protocols are publicly available with the latest Rosetta release and enable refinement of glycoprotein structures against cryoEM (Wang et al., 2016) and X-ray crystallography data, the latter taking advantage of the combined Phenix-Rosetta reciprocal-space refinement pipeline (Terwilliger et al., 2012) .",

Of particular interest were the sugar rings of glycans, which may adopt a variety of different conformations with a range of energies ( Figure 1A) ; therefore, we designed our protocol to specifically address these ring conformations. For more on glycan ring conformations, see Agirre et al. (2017a) . Several glycan refinement-specific methods have been developed, including tools for automatic detection and setup of glycan-containing structures for subsequent refinement, a score term that enables cartesian refinement of carbohydrate chains, a dedicated routine for handling sugar ring stereochemistry, and a protocol for correcting the geometry of incorrectly built glycans while optimizing the fit to density. The protocol has a large radius of convergence and is able to make substantial modifications to the input models. For example, the protocol can refine high-energy sugar ring conformers into low-energy conformers and correct erroneous anomeric configurations (see Figure 1 ). Runtime is about six times slower than Phenix refinement: a 300 residue protein was refined in 25 min compared with 4 min for Phenix refinement alone. The approach is fully described in STAR Methods.",

We identified four incorrect anomeric configurations and 23 highenergy ring conformations using the Privateer software (Agirre et al., 2015b) and detected by visual inspection that one structure was missing a glycosidic bond (Table 1) . We compared refinement of our Rosetta-based method with that of Phenix refinement alone and, for models with high-energy ring conformations in the input, Phenix refinement with constraints generated by Privateer (Agirre, 2017b; Gristick et al., 2017) . Following refinement of these 12 structures with our Phenix-Rosetta protein structure refinement pipeline, which alternates real-and reciprocal-space refinement, we were able to markedly improve the carbohydrate geometry, as assessed by Privateer. All the errors detected in the input coordinates were corrected in the output models. In particular, four incorrect anomeric carbon configurations were resolved by adjusting to the correct anomeric state and 23 high-energy ring conformations were refined into a corresponding low-energy conformation with only a slight decline in agreement to the experimental data, consistent with the idea that these glycans are being forced into poor geometry in order to over-fit the density ( Figure S1 ). The best alternative method tested, Phenix refinement with constraints from Privateer, was able to resolve only two of the four incorrect anomers and 12 of the 23 sugars in high-energy conformations (Table 1) .",

We used cryoEM to image this glycoprotein and obtained a resolution at 3.4 A. In this reconstruction, 93 N-linked glycosylation sites were visible in the map with at least two N-acetylglucosamine moieties present at most of the sites. Modeling of the protein was done using a homology model of the mouse hepatitis virus (Walls et al., 2016a) in combination with Rosetta de novo (Wang et al., 2015) , RosettaES (Frenz et al., 2017) , Rosetta den-sity-guided iterative refinement , and handtracing using Coot (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004) . The glycans were initially placed in the map at their approximate positions and the Rosetta glycan refinement protocol was subsequently used to improve the fit to density along with ensuring proper stereochemistry of the sugar rings and of the glycan bond lengths and angles. The efficiency of the protocol is illustrated by its ability to correct for inaccuracies typically observed in hand-traced models, such as the incorrect geometry of the glycosidic bond between Asn 291 and N-acetyl glucosamine 1,404 (Figure 2A ), the unrealistic length of the glycosidic bond connecting residue Asn 1,174 and the N-linked glycan chain that did not optimally fit the density ( Figure 2B ), and high-energy sugar conformations ( Figure 2C ).",

Since Rosetta uses a physically realistic all-atom force field, it is well suited for modeling into near-atomic resolution density maps, which is the resolution regime achieved for most cryoEM structures. This Rosetta glycan refinement protocol expands upon previous iterations (Labonte et al., 2017) by avoiding fitting stereochemically unfavorable glycan structures into sparse experimental data and instead yielding physically realistic geometries based on prior knowledge of saccharide chemical properties. Using a benchmark set of 12 deposited crystal structures, we demonstrated our algorithm is capable of correcting models containing significant errors in glycan geometry (Table 1) above and beyond previous methods (Agirre, 2017b; Gristick et al., 2017) . This is likely due to the increased radius of convergence of our refinement, as well as the ability to flip anomeric state. This functionality should prove beneficial for large-scale model validation efforts such as ''PDB redo'' (Joosten et al., 2011; Terwilliger et al., 2012) . We further demonstrated the strength and versatility of this algorithm for improvement of glycan stereochemistry in cryoEM models determined at near-atomic resolution with two examples of glycoprotein structures recently obtained and refined using Rosetta. The expanded Rosetta glycan framework presented here supports automated formatting of input coordinates and detection of glycan connections, as well as cartesian scoring of the most commonly found glycoprotein saccharides, including several glucose, fucose, and mannose derivatives. Future work will further expand the variety of carbohydrates handled, in order to encompass the full known spectrum of glycans found in nature. Considering the increasing number of glycoprotein structures determined at near-atomic resolution in the past few years, we anticipate this algorithm will be a valuable tool for the structural biology community. Rosetta glycan refinement is easy to use and should help novice modelers assign realistic glycan conformations while simultaneously avoiding those not supported by the experimental density.",

This was followed by idealizing the anomeric hydrogen, in order to resolve any incorrect anomers, and then relaxing the system using the Rosetta ''fastrelax'' protocol (Tyka et al., 2011) . Anomeric hydrogens were then idealized by generating a new residue free of hydrogens and then generating its ideal hydrogen positions based on the location of the non-hydrogen atoms.
