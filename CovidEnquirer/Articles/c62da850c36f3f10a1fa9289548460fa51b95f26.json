Thus, it has become rather likely that one will find a homolog with known 3D structure when searching a sequence database with an arbitrary query sequence. Depending on the extent of similarity, such neighbor relationships may allow one to infer biological function and to identify functional sites such as binding motifs or catalytic centers. Entrez's 3D-structure database, the Molecular Modeling Database (MMDB), provides easy access to the richness of 3D structure data and its large potential for functional annotation. Entrez's search engine offers several tools to assist biologist users: (i) links between databases, such as between protein sequences and structures, (ii) precomputed sequence and structure neighbors, (iii) visualization of structure and sequence/structure alignment. Here, we describe an annotation service that combines some of these tools automatically, Entrez's 'Related Structure' links. For all proteins in Entrez, similar sequences with known 3D structure are detected by BLAST and alignments are recorded. The 'Related Structure' service summarizes this information and presents 3D views mapping sequence residues onto all 3D structures available in MMDB (http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=structure).",

These database scans are run with the BLAST (5) engine, which identifies sequence neighbors with significant similarity, and the resulting sequence identifiers and taxonomy indices are stored, so that Entrez can provide 'Related Sequences' links for all protein records in the collection. The 'Related Structure' service is built on top of this system. Sequence neighbors directly linked to MMDB are identified and alignments are recomputed by employing the 'BlastTwoSequences' tool (9) to restore alignment footprints. The 'Related Structure' web interface provides direct access to this information. Initially this service had been restricted to sequences from microbial genomes (10), but it has now been expanded to cover all proteins in Entrez and is updated daily to provide a comprehensive 3D-structure annotation service. Identification of structure-linked neighbors and the visualization of sequencestructure alignment is also possible using Entrez and the Cn3D alignment viewer/editor, but 'Related Structures' provides a convenient new summary and 'one click' shortcuts to 3D visualization. These 3D views may be used to identify conserved residues and map site-specific features derived from the 3D structure. Currently 48% of non-identical protein sequences in Entrez have been linked to at least one related structure, employing a conservative threshold for alignment length (50 aligned residues or more) and similarity (30% or more identical residues in the aligned footprint); see Figure 1 for details.",

On the 'Links' menu for this record, 'Related structures' generates a request to the Related Structure service (http://structure.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/Structure/cblast/cblast.cgi?client=entrez&query_gi= 6978757). The resulting page indicates with a horizontal bar, the sequence region annotated by each related structure ( Figure 2 ). The display also supports sorting by a variety of alignment parameters such as score or length and selection of sequence-dissimilar 'non redundant' subsets. A ' Table' option switches to a text view, listing descriptions of each structure as well as alignment scores.",

Clicking on the graphical alignment footprint of 1O86, a human ACE enzyme in complex with lisinopril, one can see a text representation of the corresponding BLAST alignment, and a Cn3D view of the alignment can be launched by clicking on 'Get 3D Structure data' (Figure 3 ). One may see that the query protein is highly similar in sequence to the human ACE enzyme, as identical residue pairs are colored red by default. The sequence identity across the aligned region is 82%, and it Figure 1 . Non-identical protein sequences in Entrez have been classified into groups linked to related structures, at various levels of sequence similarity. Sequence identity is calculated from the BLAST alignments, and here only those neighbor relationships are listed that produce an aligned footprint of 50 residues or more. The analysis also excludes protein sequences which have been directly obtained from MMDB. Forty-eight percent of sequences in Entrez protein have at least one structure neighbor with an extensive alignment footprint and at least 30% identical residues. appears that the core of the structure is mostly formed by residues conserved between the two aligned rows, while non-conserved residues are mainly located on the structure's surface.",

Those sites can then be mapped from the structure to aligned regions in the sequence window using Cn3D's highlighting functionality. One may also examine the sequence-structure alignments with related structures 1UZE and 1UZF, human ACE binding to enalaprilat and captopril, respectively, drugs with chemical structures similar to that of lisinopril. This allows one to identify conserved interactions between the ACE enzyme and this series of antihypertensive drugs. Similarly, by examining the related structure 2AJF (13), one may be able to identify residues critical for cross-species infection by studying the protein-protein interactions between the receptor binding domain from SARS Coronavirus Spike and human versus rat angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.",

A 'Related Structures' link is provided when one or more similar proteins with known 3D structures have been identified by BLAST. The NCBI single-nucleotide polymorphism resource (SNP) also links to the 'Related Structure' service, which in this context provides a mapping of both synonymous and non-synonymous coding SNPs onto experimentally determined 3D structures. 'Related Structure' may be expanded further in the future, to provide visualization for other NCBI resources and to support additional filtering and selection among related structures, e.g. to highlight those annotated with conserved domain footprints by the CDD resource or those linked to small molecules in the PubChem database.

Residues in aligned regions are displayed in upper case letters with identical residue pairs rendered in red color. Residues within a 5 A contact radius of the bound drug lisinopril are highlighted in the 3D structure view and automatically mapped onto the aligned residues shown in the sequence alignment window.
