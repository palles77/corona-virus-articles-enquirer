The patient, a 50-year old male, was admitted to the L. Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases (INMI) on November 25, 2014. During his stay which lasted 5 weeks, he received different experimental treatments and needed intensive care support for 7 days. The patient recovered fully and was discharged on January 2, 2015 [2] . No secondary cases occurred. Treating an Ebola patient in an effective and safe manner is a challenge, and requires a strong background in preparedness, including logistics, procedures and skills, all of which are available at INMI, thanks to a 20-year long preparedness activity for rapid diagnosis and appropriate caring of patients with highly infectious diseases (HIDs).",

Given this scenario, INMI has planned its development with a focus on technological innovation, multidisciplinary integration and international collaborations. All these activities represent an added value for the Institute and for the whole country, and contributed to the successful management of the EVD patient, in a collaborative and safe environment for the whole staff.
