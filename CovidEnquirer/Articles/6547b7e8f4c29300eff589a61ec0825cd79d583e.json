            "text": "Formal structures to ensure public health evolved over the centuries as local authorities addressed fundamental societal needs for sanitation, safe water and food safety business licensing and other issues. These structures developed in response to the challenges of industrialization and urbanization along with growing scientific and applied methodologies for disease prevention and health promotion. Non-governmental charitable, religious, and advocacy organizations pioneered many services that were part of addressing the broad spectrum of public health needs. With the widening range of public responsibilities, state and national governments took on increasing roles of leadership. These included financial support and professional development of public health and, in parallel, medical care systems to meet the growing public expectation for good health. These challenges remain important for current and future needs of both individual and population health. In the USA the high and rising cost of health care, and lack of universal insurance coverage are continuing political and public health issues, while many other industrialized countries have better health outcomes such as longer life expectancy (see Chapters 11 and 13).",

The Elizabethan Poor Laws in Britain in the early seventeenth century established the responsibility of the local authority for health and welfare. Subsequent developments brought local, state, and national government into sanitation, disease control, and other aspects of public health and health planning. Later this extended to assuring provision of comprehensive health care on a social-equity basis for all or to meet the specific needs of vulnerable groups within a society.",

In contrast to most industrialized countries, the USA lacks universal health care. As a result, health care is provided through a mix of independent, private, and public agencies. While this is sometimes described as a \"non-system\", it is in fact a complex network of interactive services. Yet, it lacks universality, leaving many individuals without access to even basic private health care. As a result, public health organizations in the USA play a very important role in providing essential services for people or needs not otherwise met. Yet there are socioeconomic, ethnic, and regional variations and inequalities in insurance coverage and resource allocation, leaving substandard access and outcomes for many in the US health system. Public health has played a leadership role particularly in advocacy, development, and achievement in promoting health, partly to compensate for this fragmentation of health care in the USA. In many ways medium and low income countries are similar in lacking universal care, so that the institutions of US public health provide examples of infrastructure development needed to meet deficiencies in any health system.",

Federal states have constitutions conceived and written in a historical period when state rights were emphasized and health care was perceived mainly as a private activity between patient and doctor. Consequently, primary responsibility for health rested with a combination of the state, provincial, regional, or local levels of government. However, because of greater resources at the national level, federal government roles have increased in the health field over the years. National governments have a responsibility to ensure equity of social policy. A growing federal or national role has been a historical process common to many countries.

Public health grew initially at the local level with regulations for sanitation, business premises and product licensing, food safety, and the like.

The US Department of Transportation estimated in 2002 that the comprehensive cost of each fatality was US$977,000 and the cost for each critically injured person was US$1.1 million, so that the 10-year cumulative cost for fatalities alone of repealing the 55 mph speed limit was approximately US$12 billion. The department reports that in 2010 there were 3092 deaths and 416,000 injuries in distraction-affected motor vehicle accidents. Distracted driving includes the use of cell phones or performance of other tasks while driving (see Chapter 5). Local and state legislation regarding the enforcement of drink-driving laws, mandatory use of seat belts, safe car seats for children, helmets for motorcyclists and bicycle riders, education, and enforcement against use of cell phones while driving are all necessary to reduce the toll of death and disability from road crashes (see Chapter 5).",

Coupled with mandatory seat belts and child safety seats, air bags, road and car safety measures, lowering legal speed limits on rural and urban highways, improved enforcement and use of speed cameras could reduce traveling speeds and fatalities immediately (Friedman et al., 2009 ).",

The first public health insurance plan was enacted in 1947 by the province of Saskatchewan, and led to passage in 1957 of the federal Hospital Insurance and Diagnostics Services Act, which ensured universal coverage for in-hospital services in provinces that met federal criteria. By 1961, all of Canada's 10 provinces had signed on. In 1962, the government of Saskatchewan passed an act requiring doctors to collect fees solely through the government-run plan. Thus, the Canadian system is based on provincial responsibility and administration, but with federal cost-sharing incentives that helped to induce the provinces to participate. Federal conditions for funding in health include universal coverage, comprehensiveness, portability, and public administration as criteria for the provincial plans. When the federal government moved from a fixed percentage of expenditures to block grants, it lost some control over detailed management of provincial plans, but it retains a strong voice in requirements for equity, portability (i.e., transferability of insured benefits from one province to another), public administration, and prohibiting extra billing by providers for insured services. As federal shared cost program funding declined as a share of total provincial health costs, the provinces were under pressure to reform, mainly by reducing the hospital bed supply and promoting community-wide health service organization. The federal parliament unanimously passed the Canadian Medical Care Act of 1966, giving the national framework a stronger legislative base, setting standards for provincial plans, disallowing extra payment for medical services, and ensuring a standard across the country of which Canadians are very proud.",

Such an approach may be useful to strengthen a weak health program such as immunization and maternity care in a developing country.

In setting upper limits on hospital beds, it limited hospital expansion and contributed to a continuing process of improvement of diagnostic and patient care shortening hospital stays. Limiting hospital bed supply over time influenced medical ideology and helped to promote community-based health services.",

Public health services at all levels of government spend much energy and resources trying to cover deficiencies resulting from inequities in access to services. Managed care plans in which financial incentives are in play to promote ambulatory and preventive care and decreasing use of hospital care increasingly cover the US population. Collaboration between organized public health and medicine, long-standing antagonists in the USA, took a new direction in the mid-1990s with development of a \"new paradigm\" of cooperation. The American Medical Association and the APHA agreed to work together to promote networking in the form of collaborative local programs to resolve unmet health needs of the community. This mutual awareness represents recognition of the importance of both clinical medicine and public health. Intersectoral dialogue helps to identify the potential for cooperation in the context of the dramatic changes taking place in the USA in health care organization.

The organization involves many different professional areas, as well as \"hotel services and facilities\" such as the provision of food, laundry, housekeeping, supplies, and financial and personnel administrative functions. As a large organization of great complexity, a hospital must have a formal, quasi-bureaucratic structure with clear lines of authority and responsibility. However, the modern hospital cannot function under a traditionally authoritarian, paternalistic pattern of administration. Coordination of the many complex skills brought together in a hospital requires lateral coordination between departments and staff at all levels or the machine simply will not function. As a result, the hospital is highly dependent on the motivation and integrity of its staff, and their ability to network with others in different departments or professional levels freely and without excessive bureaucratic constraints.",

The introduction of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) will promote new approaches to medical care with group practice, social and preventive support systems, and the ideas of community-oriented primary care. Innovations under development include the patient-centered medical home (PCMH), ACO, and population health management system (PHMS). They include new payment arrangements that reward health outcomes achieved rather than payment of a fee for each service rendered. Evidence on the performance of such innovations will be needed to promote their wider adoption (Shortell et al., 2010) .",

At the same time, public health systems in those countries are weak, with shortages of trained personnel and organized infrastructure. People without insurance or entitlements in a national health service lack access to regular medical care, including preventive services that are taken for granted in the industrialized countries. These countries also have low levels of national expenditure for health from all sources, generally under 5 percent of GDP. As a result, maternal and child health care are weak, with high maternal, neonatal, and postneonatal mortality, and high child death rates, often from diseases that could be prevented or treated inexpensively. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), discussed in several chapters, are only partially being reached, although significant progress has been made in many countries. The burden of non-communicable disease is also high and access to medical care is crucial for the management of hypertension, early cancer discovery and treatment, and management of malaria, tropical diseases, and TB. HIV and hepatitis C are at pandemic levels and these too require access to care which, if available, mainly comes from foreign donor sources.",

Private insurance is developing for the urban middle class in employment settings such as the civil service, commercial and industrial enterprises, and the military. There is a wide gap between currently available medical and public health technology and its implementation. More investment in health is needed to bridge that gap. In 2004, the WHO concluded that \"much more investment is needed for a new, innovative approach to research on health systems; health research must be managed more effectively if it is to strengthen health systems and build public confidence in science; [and] stronger emphasis should be placed on translating knowledge into action to improve public health by bridging the gap between what is known and what is actually being done\".

Historically, the USA has been pioneering in many scientific, medical, and public health achievements. The US health system functions adequately, albeit with major handicaps of the uninsured and underinsured. County and municipal health departments are well developed and focus a great deal of their activities and attention on this population, who are largely poor and in need of health care. The coverage of the elderly and the very poor under Medicare and Medicaid has given a base of protection to these groups, but the near-poor and the near-elderly are still highly vulnerable, especially when job layoffs are a major part of the economic condition. While this problem is becoming more acute with a growth in the number of uninsured following the failure to enact national health insurance in 1994, there are increasing federal and state initiatives to widen coverage for Medicaid and especially to cover children who are uninsured. The USA, despite still being the only industrialized country lacking universal health insurance, has established and led in the development of public health programs that have had positive health effects, such as expanding the content of routine immunization of children and adults, school lunch programs, a wide range of categorical health programs to promote prenatal care, lead screening and exposure reduction, mammography, Pap smears, and other preventive services.",
