The effect of dexamethasone-induced immunosuppression on the development of faecal antibody and recovery from and resistance to rotavirus infection. Vet. Immunol. lmmunopathol., Rotavirus-naive and rotavirus-immune gnotobiotic calves were treated with high doses of dexamethasone (DX) to suppress the immune system. Calves were then infected with a virulent rotavirus inoculum, J-160, to investigate the role of immune responses both in recovery from primary rotavirus infection and in resistance to secondary rotavirus infection. Treatment of calves with DX markedly suppressed in vitro responsiveness of peripheral blood lymphocytes to mitogens within 48 h of the start of DX treatment. Suppression was similar in rotavirus-naive and rotavirus-immune calves. In contrast, the effect of DX treatment on specific antibody responses differed depending on when DX treatment started in relation to rotavirus infection. When DX treatment commenced prior to primary rotavirus infection both systemic and local specific antibody responses were inhibited. These calves, in which mitogen and antibody responses were suppressed, exhibited greater clinical signs than did control calves after infection with virulent rotavirus, but virus excretion was affected in only one of the two calves. When DX treatment was started after primary rotavirus infection but before secondary infection, systemic and local antibody responses to the primary infection and to the challenge infection were not affected. These calves resisted challenge with virulent virus as did DX-untreated rotavirus-immune calves, even though mitogen responses were suppressed.",

Resistance to secondary rotavirus infection occurred when mitogen responsiveness was suppressed, but when antibody levels were normal. Thus, no evidence was obtained that fully functional cell-mediated immune mechanisms are essential for resistance to rotavirus infection. Evidence was provided for the ability of parenteral treatment with DX to suppress mucosal as well as systemic antibody responses.",

One mechanism which has been thought to be essential is neutralising antibody, but studies in experimental animals and vaccination studies in humans suggest that other mechanisms are important (Woode et al., 1978; Bridger and Oldham, 1987; Clarke et al., 1988 ) . While the immune system of cattle is considered to be relatively resistant to the effects ofglucocorticosteroids (GC) compared to that of mice (Wilkie et al., 1979; Pruett et al., 1987) , GC treatment nevertheless has marked effects on bovine immune responsiveness (reviewed by Roth and Kaeberle, 1982 ) . These effects include the suppression of both antibody and cell-mediated immune responses. However, nothing is known of the effects of GC on intestinal antibody responses. In this paper we have used DX-induced immunosuppression to try to gain an understanding of the immune mechanisms involved in recovery from primary enteric infection and resistance to secondary enteric infection. In addition, we report the effect of DX treatment on faecal antibody responses to rotavirus in cattle.",

            "text": "The role of the immune system in recovery from and resistance to rotavirus infection was investigated by suppression of the immune system with DX. Recovery of calves from primary rotavirus infection was affected by DX treatment, although all calves did recover. The duration of clinical signs increased and, in one calf, virus excretion was prolonged. These findings agree with similar studies where DX treatment reduced resistance to primary infection with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) in pigs (Shimizu and Shimizu, 1979) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; Thomas et al., 1984) and bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV; Clarke et al., 1989) in calves. Termination of viral excretion coincided with the appearance of faecal antibody in DX-untreated calves but not in DX-treated calves. This suggests that antibody-mediated mechanisms are not essential for termination of rotavirus excretion, but may be important in the clinical recovery of naive calves from rotavirus infection. Although mitogen responses were suppressed they were not completely ablated. However, one must also raise the caveat that DX can affect a variety of immunological and physiological processes other than those measured here, which might have an effect on recovery of the gut from infection and damage. In mice, treatment with cortisone acetate induces the maturation of enterocytes making them resistant to rotavirus infection (Wolf et al., 1981 ) . This did not appear to be occurring in this study as rotavirus-naive DX-treated calves excreted similar levels of rotavirus as the DX-untreated animals. Inhibition by DX of the healing process in the intestine after rotavirus infection may, however, explain the observation that clinical symptoms persisted after virus excretion had ceased.",

Rotaviruses which multiply without causing disease have been described (Bridger and Pocock, 1986; Bridger and Oldham, 1987) and the excreted virus could represent such a virus. Rotavirus was not excreted by the DX-treated calves after challenge however, in contrast to the DX-untreated calves. Crouch et al.
