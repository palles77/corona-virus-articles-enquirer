The current influenza A (H1N1) pandemic may have a disproportionate effect on the provision of Intensive Care services in Europe. These challenges cause many anxieties for practicing clinicians, both as to what to expect, how to practice and what support or help they will be given. In this statement from the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM), we aim to describe some of the facts, the fears and the areas where scientific societies can help to improve our understanding of these problems and at the same time reduce the impact of these issues for our members and their patients.",

Public health agencies did their best to contain the dissemination of the disease; however, unfortunately these efforts failed, and on the 11 June, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the first flu pandemic since 1968. The disease spread rapidly across the globe. In the southern hemisphere, Intensive Care faced an unprecedented challenge with as many as 25% of all ICU patients in Australia and New Zealand having either suspected or confirmed S-OIV by the middle of August [1] . In the Northern hemisphere, the first wave of the pandemic had a very heterogeneous impact, with the USA, Canada, England and Spain being especially affected. By the end of August, virtually all countries had reported cases, and many had also reported deaths.",

Although the vast majority of individuals had a mild illness, similar to seasonal flu, it was observed that certain groups not usually at increased risk of complications or death from seasonal influenza were at special risk for S-OIV. These groups include the pregnant or recent postpartum [2] , the obese and the young [3] [4] [5] . Three predominant syndromes have been reported [1, 6] FLAA-ARDS, the most commonly described of these syndromes, was associated with a very high mortality. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) developed rapidly in up to 75% of the patients [6] , despite the fact that most of these died due to refractory hypoxaemia apparently resistant to the use of measures such as high frequency oscillation and extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) [7] . Approximately half went on to develop life-threatening super-added infections [6] , which were especially common in those with co-existing morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression, malignancy and chronic lung disease [1] .",

This has developed following the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [8] and the threat of avian flu (H5N1). Major plans have therefore been developed in many countries that could be now implemented [9, 10]. 2. Since the previous pandemics, Intensive Care Medicine has evolved to enable the treatment of very sick patients presenting with an acute respiratory illness, and we have now new and better antibiotics and antivirals. Modern techniques of mechanical ventilation together with protocols for the support and treatment of multiple organ failure may reduce the overall mortality of these conditions.",

            "text": "Despite the existing plans, the biggest unknown factor remains the overall impact that the pandemic will have both on the health and on the economy. Epidemiologists have been modeling likely scenarios, but the models are notoriously inaccurate early on in a pandemic phase [11] . Using an attack rate ranging from 10 to 30% of the population with a hospital admission rate close to 1% and a case-fatality rate close to 0.14%, as in seasonal flu (an hypothesis supported by preliminary data [1] ), the pandemic may have a major impact on health services and ICM in particular. Some models have predicted critical care demand at the peak surge of the pandemic to be well in excess of 100% of available facilities, even in the most developed countries [11] . This is of considerable concern to practicing Intensivists. Increasing intensive care support by a factor of two without additional skilled and trained specialists and without the usual range or technical facilities and support services may well force us to ventilate more patients than normal, but this would not be 'quality critical care.' If this increased surge was to occur, then the numbers of patients presenting would be well in excess of the available capacity to provide them with quality care. This will necessitate triage. The ethics of triage have been discussed several times [12] [13] [14] [15] , but the concerns as to whether the ethical or legal framework will ultimately support clinicians faced with these tribulations remain. Practicing for a greater good, rather than what is best for an individual patient, may be the pragmatic answer to the problem, but clinicians are rightly concerned that this may lead to future complaint and legal or professional censure. Unfortunately, many national governmental authorities have failed to address these concerns with clear and open guidance.",

In many countries the numbers of pediatric intensive care (PICU) beds are at a level far below that of the adult specialty. In addition, PICU has centralized its service in many countries, with the implication that many smaller hospitals no longer have significant skill bases or equipment to care for these children. This may well result in a significant number of young patients being cared for in an adult environment. Even disregarding the problems of putting young patients into an adult unit, the skill and knowledge gap is huge, and this needs to be rapidly addressed to prepare for this eventuality. The close links that exist between the ESICM and the European Society of Paediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care (ESPNIC) will undoubtedly prove to be an important asset to mount a coordinated and efficient response to the current threat.",

To answer those questions (and many others), several registries and collaborative studies have been initiated.
