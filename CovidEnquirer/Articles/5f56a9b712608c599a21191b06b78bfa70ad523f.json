            "text": "Context: Morphine is an alkaloid isolated from the poppy plants. The addiction of morphine is a very serious social issue. Some long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been proposed to engage in drug addiction. Objective: Whether lncRNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) attended to morphine-mediated autophagy of mouse hippocampal neuronal HT22 cells was probed. Materials and methods: HT22 cells were subjected to 10 mM morphine for 24 h. Cell autophagy was assessed by measuring LC3-II/LC3-I and Beclin-1 expression. qRT-PCR was carried out to measure MEG3 expression. SiRNA oligoribonucleotides targeting MEG3 (si-MEG3) was transfected to silence MEG3. The orexin1 receptor (OX1R), c-fos, p/t-ERK and p/t-PKC expressions were tested by western blotting. SCH772984 was used as an inhibitor of ERK pathway. Results: Morphine elevated OX1R (2.92 times), c-fos (2.06 times), p/t-ERK (2.04 times) and p/t-PKC (2.4 times), Beclin-1 (3.2 times) and LC3-II/LC3-I (3.96 times) expression in HT22 cells. Moreover, followed by morphine exposure, the MEG3 expression was also elevated in HT22 cells (3.03 times). The silence of MEG3 lowered the Beclin-1 (1.85 times), LC3-II/LC3-I (2.12 times), c-fos (1.39 times) and p/t-ERK (1.44 times) expressions in morphine-treated HT22 cells. Inhibitor of ERK pathway SCH772984 further promoted the influence of MEG3 silence on morphine-caused Beclin-1 (1.97 times) and LC3-II/LC3-I (1.92 times) expressions decreases. Conclusions: Up-regulation of MEG3 attended to the morphine-caused autophagy of HT22 cells might be through elevating c-fos expression and promoting ERK pathway activation. More experiments are also needed in the future to analyse the influence of other lncRNAs in drug addiction.",

            "text": "Morphine is a very effective opiate analgesic drug widely used to ease both acute and chronic pain (Du 2018) . However, morphine has become a commonly abused recreational drug due to its widespread availability and a high potential for addiction (Kim et al. 2016) . Researching the pathogenesis of morphine addiction can provide new ideas and theoretical basis for elucidating the molecular mechanism of opioid addiction and clinical treatment. Earlier experimental studies have indicated that neuronal cell mitochondrial dysfunction happens in morphine addiction process, which in turn induces cell autophagy (Lixia et al. 2010; Cai et al. 2016; Su et al. 2017) . Su et al. (2017) reported that compared to wild-type mice, mice specific knockout of autophagy-related 5 (Atg5) and Atg7 in dopaminergic neurons had lower sensitivities to constructing morphine-induced addictive behaviours. Orexin1 receptor (OX1R) is a G-protein-coupled receptor in central nervous system, which contributed to the establishment of morphine addiction (Baimel et al. 2015) . c-fos is a proto-oncogene that expressed in central neurons after adverse stimulation (Dziopa et al. 2011) . Studies in rats revealed that cfos protein took part in the neurobiological responses to morphine in dopamine neurons (Dziopa et al. 2011) . Besides, both ERK and PKC pathways have been found to participate in the morphine-mediated drug addiction Pena et al. 2018) .",

Although morphine has strong analgesic activity, the addiction of morphine also is a very serious social issue (Kim et al. 2016; Antolak et al. 2017 ). Many efforts have been made to explore the molecular basis of morphine addiction and some molecules and cellular biological processes have been found. OX1R, c-fos, ERK and PKC pathways are all discovered to join in morphine addiction. For example, Erami et al. (2012) reported that suppression of OX1R decreased the progress of morphine tolerance and physical dependence in rats. Siahposht-Khachaki et al. (2018) indicated that exposure to morphine produced an elevation of c-fos expression in nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of Wistar rats. In addition, Liu et al. (2016) illustrated that ERK pathway contributed to the maintenance of morphine-mediated memory in hippocampus. Pena et al. (2018) pointed out that followed by morphine stimulation, PKC pathway in mouse neuroblastoma cells was activated. As an intracellular protein self-degradation Figure 2 .

In the cell autophagy process, the LC3-I binds to phosphatidylethanolamine to form LC3-II, which joins in the formation of autophagosome membranes (Pugsley 2017) . Beclin-1, also known as Atg6, is a key regulator of cell autophagy (Booth et al. 2014) . Herein, we found that the OX1R, c-fos, p/t-ERK and p/t-PKC expressions in HT22 cells were all increased after morphine stimulation. The LC3-II/LC3-I and Beclin-1 expressions were also elevated in HT22 cells after morphine stimulation. Therefore, we proposed that morphine-stimulated HT22 cells could be utilized as an in vitro cell model of morphine addiction to explore the influence of MEG3 on morphine addiction.",

These findings provide great motivation for studying the influences of lncRNAs on drug addiction. MEG3 has been proved to take part in the modulation of cell autophagy, especially in brain cells (Xu et al. 2018; Zhao et al. 2018) . Su et al.

Moreover, the silence of MEG3 relieved the morphine-stimulated HT22 cell autophagy through declining the Beclin-1 and LC3-II/ LC3-I expressions. Besides, we also discovered that the silence of MEG3 lowered the c-fos and p/t-ERK expressions in morphinetreated HT22 cells, but had no significant influence on OX1R and p/t-PKC expressions. Inhibitor of ERK pathway SCH772984 further promoted the influence of MEG3 silence on morphinecaused HT22 cell autophagy. Considering that c-fos and ERK pathway also have been found to join in the regulation of cell autophagy (Wu et al. 2018; Fung and Liu 2019) , the findings of our research suggested that up-regulation of MEG3 attended to the influence of morphine on HT22 cell autophagy might be achieved by elevating c-fos expression and promoting ERK pathway activation.",

Up-regulation of MEG3 attended to the morphine-caused autophagy of HT22 cells might be through elevating c-fos expression and promoting ERK pathway activation. We propose that not only one lncRNA, MEG3, take part in the morphine-mediated drug addiction. More experiments are also needed in the future to analyse the influence of other lncRNAs in drug addiction.",
