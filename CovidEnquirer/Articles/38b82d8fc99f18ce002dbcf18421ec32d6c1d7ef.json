Pharyngeal or retropharyngeal abscesses should be drained either by manual pressure during oral examination or externally under ultrasound guidance with liberal incisions that avoid vital structures. Internal drainage is preferred unless the abscess is close to the skin surface. External drainage is technically difficult for deep pharyngeal abscesses located more than a few centimeters below the skin surface. Vagus nerve damage, vascular injury, salivary duct laceration, and acute cellulitis are potential complications associated with opening abscesses. The salivary duct was severed in one calf we treated, and saliva flowed from the incision for a couple of days after which the salivary flow stopped and the calf had a complete recovery. If drainage is not liberal, abscesses tend to recur. If recurrence is obvious, culture and sensitivity coupled with drainage through multiple sites are indicated. Daily flushing of the drainage sites is important. Systemic antibiotics should be administered for 1 to 2 weeks after drainage; Trueperella pyogenes and Fuso bacterium spp. are the most common organisms cultured, so \u03b2-lactams are the most commonly used antibiotic class. Chronic maxillary sinusitis should be treated by trephination of the sinus, removal of any teeth that have infected roots, daily flushing of the sinus with dilute disinfectants or sterile saline, and appropriate systemic antibiotics for 1 to 2 weeks.",

Juvenile lymphosarcoma often causes upper airway dyspnea via enlarged pharyngeal lymph nodes. Occasional adult-form lymphosarcoma cases have one or more very large (10-20 cm diameter) pharyngeal or mediastinal lymph nodes that will cause dyspnea. Lymphosarcoma usually results in death within 1 to 6 months of diagnosis. Adenocarcinomas originating in the respiratory epithelium in older cattle (i.e., more than 8 years of age) may have an insidious but progressive course over months to years. Therefore, unlike cattle with lymphosarcoma, these animals may be allowed to survive for some time to deliver another calf or to undergo superovulation and embryo transfer. Only if the animal stops eating, develops severe respiratory distress, or is suffering from exposure damage from an exophthalmic eye will euthanasia be necessary. Cattle affected with primary squamous cell carcinoma, metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, or osteosarcoma originating in a sinus, bone, or periocular location occasionally may have enough tumor mass or lymph node metastases to develop inspiratory dyspnea. Cattle with squamous cell carcinomas frequently have a fetid breath odor from the primary tumor and should not be made to suffer unduly.",

Affected cattle may rub their noses so frequently that foreign bodies may become trapped in the nasal cavity, and significant self-induced trauma may ensue. Diagnosis is based on clinical signs; endoscopic examination of the nasal and nasopharyngeal cavity ( Fig. 4.8 , B and C ); and when indicated, cytology of nasal mucus, tracheal aspirates or nasal biopsy, all of which contain large numbers of mononuclear cells and eosinophils (Fig. 4.8, D) .

Usually this requires IV sodium iodide (30 g/450 kg) initially and at 2to 3-day intervals for several treatments or oral organic iodide (30 g/450 kg) daily after the initial IV dose. Cryosurgery has been used successfully on these granulomas after debulking. In severe or recurrent cases, antibiotic therapy may be necessary in addition to sodium iodide. Penicillin and ampicillin have been used to treat infection caused by A. lignieresii. Whenever possible, an antibiotic should be selected based on organism culture and sensitivity results. Usually the prognosis is good. Granulomas caused by A. bovis are much more difficult to treat because this organism is poorly responsive to sodium iodide therapy. Treatment with penicillin (22,000 U/kg intramuscularly [IM] once a day), in conjunction with sodium iodide, may be effective. Surgical debulking of soft tissue granulomas also is indicated. The prognosis for lesions caused by A. bovis is guarded because of the limited clinical knowledge regarding treatment of this organism, and the fact that many owners may not treat for a sufficient time.",

Older calves and mature cattle dehorned by laypeople are most at risk because of nonsterile equipment and techniques. Signs of acute sinusitis include fever (103.0\u00b0 to 106.0\u00b0F [39.4\u00b0 to 41.1\u00b0C]), unilateral or bilateral mucopurulent nasal discharge, depression, and headache type pain characterized by partially closed eyes, an extended head and neck, head pressing or resting the muzzle on support structures (interestingly, cattle with severe skeletal or mild to moderate visceral pain can also often be found pressing their muzzles against an object, which suggests this must be a pain relief point), and sensitivity to palpation on percussion of the sinus. When acute sinusitis follows recent dehorning, purulent drainage or heavy scabs may be observed at the wound in the cornual portion of the sinus. A multitude of bacteria such as T. pyogenes, Pasteu rella multocida, Escherichia coli, and anaerobes may contribute to acute frontal sinus infection. Tetanus is another possible complication of acute frontal sinusitis if wound debris or scabs occlude the cornual opening to allow an anaerobic environment.",

Occasional secondary cases may also present in association with osteomyelitic conditions of the skull such as lumpy jaw (Dr. Mike Livesey, University of Wisconsin, 2017, personal communication) . Extension of frontal sinusitis associated with dehorning into the more rostral maxillary sinus is also possible. The most common presenting signs are chronic, purulent, unilateral nasal discharge; it is very rare to see facial asymmetry, but affected cattle may sometimes show resentment and sensitivity during percussion of the skull over the maxillary sinus region on the relevant side.

Ascending respiratory tract infections, as in other species, are a cause of chronic frontal sinusitis and usually are caused by P. multocida. Chronic frontal sinusitis associated with old dehorning complications such as lowgrade infection, bony skull fragments, or sequestra typically is associated with infection by T. pyogenes or mixed infections that may include T. pyogenes, P. multocida, anaerobes, or miscellaneous gram-negative organisms. Signs of chronic frontal sinusitis include gradual loss of condition and production that may be persistent or intermittent. Unilateral nasal discharge usually is observed, again as a persistent or intermittent complaint. Additional signs include head pressing, an extended head and neck, partially closed eyes, or resting of the muzzle on inanimate objects, all of which signal headache or pain. Intermittent or persistent fever is present. Bony expansions of the sinus may occur, causing asymmetric facial distortion, especially in cattle that do not have significant nasal discharge because of occlusion or obstruction of the opening of the ethmoidal meatus into the nasal cavity. In fact, some cattle have intermittent bony swelling of the sinus that becomes less apparent during times of sinus drainage and subsequent nasal discharge. Palpation or percussion of the frontal bone overlying the affected sinus causes pain, and the patient may be extremely apprehensive when the examiner approaches the head. Bony expansion of the sinus may result in ipsilateral exophthalmos and decreased air movement through the ipsilateral nasal passage (Fig. 4.10) . Neurologic complications, including septic meningitis, dural abscesses, and pituitary abscesses, are possible in neglected cases as a result of erosion through the bony sinus.

This acquired lack of normal arytenoid abduction has led to repeated bouts of dyspnea and upper airway noise during hot and humid weather, exertion, or even just in response to mild tachypnea. Consequently, this has led to repeated emergency tracheostomy or discussion with the owners regarding the placement of a permanent tracheotomy or a tracheolaryngotomy for long-term resolution.

Calves affected with calf diphtheria usually have abscesses in the cheek region and mild salivation and may refuse solid feed ( Fig. 4.16) . The infection spreads among calves fed from common utensils or feeders or those in such close group contact that they may lick one another. When the larynx becomes infected in the atypical form of this disease, the affected calf develops a progressive inspiratory dyspnea. Low-grade fever (103.0\u00b0 to 104.5\u00b0F [39.44\u00b0 to 40.28\u00b0C]) may be present along with a painful short cough that is observed when the calf attempts to drink or eat. As the condition worsens over several days, both inspiratory and expiratory dyspnea may be apparent, but the inspiratory component always will be worse. A necrotic odor may be present on the breath.

Chronic cases may have laryngeal deformity and airway narrowing, but the necrotic, infected cartilage may be covered by normal mucosa (see Video Clips 4.2 and 4.3). If the mucosa appears normal on endoscopic examination performed via the nose and the tracheostomy opening, ultrasound examination of the larynx can be very helpful in detecting the severity of cartilage necrosis (Fig. 4.19 ). It should be noted that adult cattle may also develop bacterial infections in and around the arytenoid cartilages causing either cartilage necrosis or soft tissue abscess formation (see Video Clips 4.4 and 4.5).

A temporary tracheostomy had to be performed because of the severity of the respiratory obstruction and distress. and rests the inflamed larynx from further exertional irritation while the infection is controlled. Affected animals can improve from severe respiratory distress and being almost moribund to eupnea in minutes after placement of the tracheostomy. It also allows for easier evaluation of the lower airway; the degree to which bronchopneumonia is worsening the animal's condition is much easier to evaluate by auscultation, if imaging modalities (radiographs or ultrasound) are not available, when one does not have to try to filter out the considerable referred upper airway noise that is typically present before the tracheostomy is placed. The prognosis for acute cases is fair; the goal is to be able to allow the temporary tracheostomy to heal by second intention after it is apparent that normal air flow and eupnea are possible when the temporary tracheostomy is \"test\" occluded. The temporary tracheostomy, although usually placed under emergency-type conditions, should be located in the proximal third of the neck, close to the larynx. Daily wound care and changing of the tracheostomy tube are critical because the site is usually very \"exudative\" and prone to purulent discharges that can occlude the airway or become inhaled and travel distally. It is advisable to remove a semicircular part of the adjacent tracheal rings immediately dorsal and ventral to the initial skin incision when placing the tracheostomy tube even if this is performed after a smaller diameter tube has been initially placed for emergency relief. Radiographs can be helpful not only diagnostically but also to give an idea of the diameter of tracheostomy tube that the patient's upper airway can accommodate, although the diameter of the stoma is the usual limiting factor. Radiographs or ultrasonography of the lungs are also helpful to assess the amount of pneumonia (aspiration is common in these cases). Concurrent, severe bronchopneumonia worsens the prognosis markedly and is often suggested by only mild improvement in tachypnea when a tracheostomy is placed.",

Treatment is similar to that described for acute cases but should be extended to 14 to 30 days in patients valuable enough to warrant treatment, or the necrotic cartilage should be surgically removed or debrided. A tracheostomy may be necessary for the reasons listed earlier, and some clinicians recommend concurrent treatment with sodium iodide in the hope of penetrating the deep-seated cartilaginous infection. T. pyogenes frequently contributes to, or replaces, F. necrophorum as the causative organism in chronic infections because these two organisms are synergistic. For valuable cattle with the chronic form, referral to an expert surgeon familiar with performing a permanent tracheotomy, the tracheolaryngotomy technique as described by Gasthuys, or a subtotal arytenoidectomy via laryngotomy is recommended. Surgical details are described in the Farm Animal Surgery text, edited by Drs. Fubini and Ducharme. Anatomic differences in skin redundancy and strap musculature between horses and cattle, even in calves, make surgery more challenging. By removal of the caudal part of the cricoid cartilage and two to three proximal tracheal rings, a permanent tracheolaryngotomy can be established as a long-term solution, and cattle can still thrive after this procedure (Figs. 4.22 and 4.23) but are, of course, susceptible to blockage of, or aspiration into, the stoma. Recently, Nichols and Anderson have described an additional surgical option of partial or subtotal arytenoidectomy via laryngotomy for the long-term management of such calves. Calves can grow and survive to adulthood. It has been convention to say that these animals cannot calve without assistance because of their inability to forcibly abdominally contract against a closed airway (Valsalva maneuver); that has not been our experience! In dairy calves, the prognosis for animals that undergo such permanent upper airway surgeries must always be guarded, and the treatment goal should preferably be resolution of the condition medically, often with the combined use of a temporary tracheostomy, during the acute stages of the disease.",

            "text": "Etiology and Signs M. haemolytica is a gram-negative rod that may be a normal inhabitant of the upper airway but is not cultured from the upper airway of normal cattle as frequently as P. multocida. Several properties of M. haemolytica contribute to its pathogenicity. These include a capsule that provides defense against phagocytosis; production of an exotoxin (leukotoxin) lethal to alveolar macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils; cell wall-derived endotoxin that helps to initiate complement and coagulation cascades; and the ability to reside in the upper airway among other nonpathogenic serotypes and then convert/or overgrow under stressful stimuli to a pathogenic serotype, A1, that is more virulent. The cytotoxicity of the leukotoxin is associated with its ability to bind and interact with \u03b22 integrin leukocyte function-associated antigen 1. Currently, M. haemolytica is a leading cause of death as a result of respiratory infection in dairy cattle and calves in most areas of the United States. This organism is a primary pathogen not always needing assistance from other viral or Mycoplasma agents to establish lower airway infection, although it is well demonstrated that bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV1) infection can activate genes that will increase leukotoxin binding, cytotoxicity to bovine mononuclear cells, and the severity of M. haemolytica infection. When a virus such as IBR, bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), or bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) does infect a herd, mortality will be greatly increased if M. haemolytica bronchopneumonia is superimposed. In this situation, the bacteria may cause death because the viral infection compromises mechanical and cellular defense mechanisms. Similarly, compromise of the mucociliary clearance apparatus alongside depression of other components of airway defense can be consequences of poor air quality under conditions of poor ventilation, inadequate fresh air changes, and increased partial pressures of inspired noxious gases such as ammonia from soiled bedding. This is true in broad terms for all of the infectious causes of lower airway disease, whether commensal or true pathogen, and serves to emphasize the importance of air quality and ventilation in the prevention and control of pneumonia. The mortality rate may approach 30% to 50% when a virulent M. haemolytica infection is superimposed on a preexisting viral infection (e.g., BHV1 or BVDV) in a herd. Cattle that are stressed are at great risk of M. hae molytica pneumonia because stress triggers activation of the organism to a more virulent form, permits greater colonization of the virulent strain, and compromises the host defense mechanisms. Corticosteroids, either endogenous or exogenous, impair endotoxin-induced expression of antimicrobial peptides in the upper airway of cattle which would normally be an important part of the host defense response to gram-negative organisms such as Mannheimia and Histophilus spp. A similar negative effect is noted via endogenous corticosteroid release upon lactotransferrin production, which is another important antimicrobial determinant within the airways. Social group disruption, weaning, and transportation are all established paths to corticosteroid release in calves in particular and are therefore important risks to be aware of when troubleshooting husbandry factors that may be contributing to death losses caused by infection with M. haemolytica. Thus, M. haemolytica is frequently isolated as the cause of \"shipping fever pneumonia\" associated with shipment of cattle, transport of cattle to shows, or recent purchase of replacement animals. Classic signs of pneumonia generally develop 1 to 2 weeks after any of these stresses. The morbidity and mortality percentages tend to be much greater for M. haemolytica pneumonia outbreaks than if P. multocida is found as the cause of \"shipping fever\". A great deal of variation in pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance exists amongst isolates of M. haemolytica. Therefore, the veterinarian must accept the fact that signs produced by these types may vary from mild to severe. Mild infections or less pathogenic M. haemolytica may mimic P. multocida with respect to clinical signs and response to therapy, but severe infections may be so drastic as to cause death within hours of the first clinical signs. In rare instances, the death can be so peracute that a toxicity is suspected. A less pathogenic form has been seen causing high fever in recently fresh cows, all of which had a remarkably quick recovery after treatment with ceftiofur.",

The dorsal lung fields may sound normal on auscultation of animals with mild to moderate M. haemolytica pneumonia. In more severe cases, however, the dorsal lung may be forced to overwork because of the ventral lung consolidation. This overwork creates interstitial edema or bullous emphysema on occasion, and these pathologic changes cause the dorsal lung to be abnormally quiet on auscultation. Auscultation of the trachea will reveal coarse rattling or bubbling sounds caused by the inflammatory exudate free in the trachea. Palpation of the intercostal regions over the pneumonic lung causes the animal pain.

Signs in acutely affected cattle include high fever (106.0\u00b0 to 108.0\u00b0F [41.11\u00b0 to 42.22\u00b0C]), marked depression, salivation, increased respiratory rate (60-120 breaths/min), complete anorexia and milk cessation, reluctance to move, and an absence of rales when the ventral lungs are auscultated.

SC emphysema and pulmonary edema are common sequelae in these cattle. Ventral abdominal pain can be elicited in the cranial abdomen as a result of the fibrinous pleuritis present. This pain and absence of rumen activity coupled with the other signs have caused many veterinarians to initially confuse this rapidly consolidating pneumonia with peritonitis caused by hardware or a perforating abomasal ulcer. The major reason for this error is the absence of rales with this form of M. haemolytica. Therefore we have had to \"retrain\" our ears to auscultate carefully for bronchial tones versus normal or harsh bronchovesicular sounds. Careless auscultation of air sounds in the ventral lung field may not discriminate between bronchial tones and vesicular sounds.

Again, the veterinarian is forced to use \"best guess\" judgment when selecting an initial antibiotic in most cases. After collection of appropriate diagnostic samples, antibiotic therapy should commence immediately. Because life-threatening signs usually appear in at least some of the affected cattle, the veterinarian is more likely to select broad-spectrum antibiotics immediately. The currently available antibiotics for dairy cows and calves in the United States are shown in Table 4 .1. Even when the causative bacterial organism is known, antibiotic therapy may be unable to cure the patient for a variety of reasons, such as the chosen antibiotic does not reach adequate tissue levels in the lung; the organism is resistant to the antibiotic; the organism is sensitive in vitro but in vitro inhibitory concentrations do not occur in the patient as a result of the dose, frequency of dosage, or other pharmacologic considerations; the drug may not be able to penetrate consolidated lung or work in purulent tissue; and in vitro susceptibility tests may not reflect in vivo success of an antibiotic against a specific organism. Consequently, the Kirby-Bauer disc assay has been criticized as too crude a test compared with mean inhibitory concentration (MIC) or bactericidal concentration tests that can give a concentration of drug that inhibits or kills an organism. This MIC value then can be compared with known achievable blood and tissue levels of the antibiotic in the patient to determine likelihood of successful treatment. In a recent pharmacokinetic study in six calves, plasma, interstitial fluid (ISF) and pulmonary epithelial lining fluid (PELF) concentrations of ceftiofur (using the ceftiofur crystalline-free acid formulation), enrofloxacin, tulathromycin, and florfenicol were measured in 6-month-old calves to determine the plasma pharmacokinetics of each drug and the likelihood that the drugs would attain levels in bronchial fluid or lung that are above the MIC for common bovine pneumonia pathogens. Based solely on the pharmacokinetic data and previously reported MICs for bovine respiratory pathogens, it was found that drugs such as florfenicol and ceftiofur with high PELF concentrations were expected to be effective in the control of respiratory disease, but those with high ISF concentrations, including enrofloxacin and florfenicol, may be more effective in treatment of active respiratory infections. It was hypothesized that the often reported clinical efficacy of tulathromycin could be related to its antiinflammatory properties. Textbook charts that quote percentages of isolates sensitive to various antibiotics are seldom helpful because both geographic differences in strains and temporal resistance patterns occur. In some instances failure of antimicrobial treatment may also be attributed to the fact that the pulmonary pathology is irreversible or viral, or that Mycoplasma spp. or T. pyogenes pathogens may coexist to complicate the treatment response. Appropriate withdrawal times for any antibiotic selected for milk and slaughter residues must be known and observed and may shape decisions by the producer as to which antibiotic is chosen so that an immediate slaughter option is maintained.",

If corticosteroids are used as part of initial therapy, we believe that 20 mg of dexamethasone or a comparable dose of prednisone for an adult cow is the maximum. This should not be used more than once, and it should not be used at all in pregnant cattle. Currently in our clinics, we do not use any corticosteroids in the treatment of M. haemolytica pneumonia. Flunixin meglumine or other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are sound therapeutic agents for use in M. haemolytica pneumonia for the first 1 to 3 days of therapy. Excessive doses of NSAIDs or prolonged treatment with these agents should be avoided. Again, aspirin is the safest drug for this purpose (at a dosage of 240-480 grains orally twice daily for an adult cow or 25 grains/100 lb body weight twice daily for calves). Flunixin meglumine at 0.5 to 1.1 mg/kg is the most commonly recommended and only approved NSAID for treating bovine pneumonia and has been documented to improve clinical outcomes when combined with antibiotics compared with antibiotic treatment alone. We do not routinely use the high end of the labeled dose for flunixin (2.2 mg/kg) because of concerns over gastrointestinal (GI) side effects; however, other colleagues feel differently and are prepared to administer it at least once at this dose in the treatment of a critically ill patient.",

Any IV fluid therapy that excessively expands the intravascular volume may cause or worsen existing pulmonary edema, consequently the fluid volume administered must be appropriate. Administering fluids through a stomach tube is safer regarding pulmonary edema, but the procedure is very stressful to an already hypoxic and dyspneic animal. Clinical judgment is required for these decisions, and in most cases, it is best to hope that antibiotic therapy will improve the animal within 24 to 48 hours so that the cow or calf may hydrate itself through adequate water consumption.

At necropsy, resolving anterior ventral pneumonia from the previous Mannheimia or Pasteurella infection was observed in anterior ventral lung fields, and the remainder of the lung was diffusely firm, heavy, and wet. Histopathology in such cases confirms proliferative pneumonia. Viral cultures, fluorescent antibody (FA) procedures, and serology have been negative for other pathogens, including BRSV, which also may cause a delayed-effect hypersensitivity pneumonia but with different lesions. After observation of a number of these secondary proliferative pneumonia cases in the necropsy room, they were able to clinically recognize and treat several calves with this problem. The calves had a history of being part of a pneumonia outbreak 2 to 4 weeks previously and then apparently recovering. A sudden onset of extreme dyspnea in one recovered calf typifies the clinical situation. Signs include mild fever, open-mouth breathing, and diffusely quiet lungs. The cause of this disorder is unproven, although increased exposure of the dorsal lung field to inhaled rumen gases after ventral consolidation has been proposed. Treatment consists of atropine (2.2 mg/45 kg twice daily), furosemide (25 mg/45 kg once or twice daily), broad-spectrum antibiotics, and box stall rest in a well-ventilated area.

Ceftiofur, a broadspectrum third generation cephalosporin approved for use in Pasteurella pneumonia in cattle, can be effective when the isolate is susceptible, which is frequently the case with P. multocida, and often the case with M. haemolytica, and H. somni. However, the increasing prevalence of Mycoplasma spp. co-infection in calves with bovine respiratory disease (BRD), for which the cephalosporin group is ineffective (along with other \u03b2-lactams such as penicillin and ampicillin), means that ceftiofur has become less relevant as a first-line antimicrobial choice. Macrolides (tulathromycin, tilimicosin, tildipirosin, gamithromycin), enrofloxacin, and florfenicol have become the most common first-line antibiotics for the treatment of undifferentiated BRD in dairy calves. The practicing veterinarian must often start antibiotic therapy without knowing results of cultures and antibiotic sensitivity tests. Therefore initial treatment is based on previous experience, geographic differences in antibiotic sensitivity, and economic factors. Animals that are febrile, anorectic, and dyspneic require treatment. Other animals that have mild fever and depression but continue to eat and do not act very ill may not require treatment. Individual or small groups of sick animals may be treated empirically if fatalities are not anticipated. However, if an epidemic situation is apparent, it always is best to do transtracheal washes from several animals before any treatment. Having done this, the veterinarian may start empiric therapy cognizant that definitive antibiotic sensitivity results will be forthcoming in about 3 days. It should be mentioned here that although transtracheal washes are recommended as part of a good diagnostic \"workup,\" clinical response to antibiotics does not always correlate with in vitro susceptibility tests. For example, we have attended several calves with severe chronic pneumonia that had been treated with macrolides, \u03b2-lactams, and fluoroquinolones with no response but when treated with IV tetracycline and intramuscular penicillin and housed in a well ventilated hospital environment responded remarkably well, often despite in vitro resistance of the pathogen to these drugs (see Video Clips 4.9A and B). The macrolides, fluoroquinolones, and florfenicol all have a spectrum of activity in lung tissue that includes gram-negative organisms such as P. multocida, M. haemolytica, and H. somni as well as efficacy against Myco plasma spp., and hence they represent sound empiric choices \u2022 Fig. 4 .39 Ultrasound image of severe consolidating bronchopneumonia in a calf.

Strict attention to responsible antimicrobial use, and adherence to federal regulations regarding not only drug withdrawals but also the requirements of the American Medicinal Drug Use Clarification Act (AMDUCA) are critical duties of the veterinarian. Within the United States, veterinarians and producers must be particularly aware of the defined dose, route, and duration restrictions for cephalosporin use in all dairy cattle, alongside the categoric requirement that enrofloxacin only be administered to calves younger than 20 months of age with respiratory disease. The necessity for intravenous administration when using flunixin in lactating cattle is another emphatic requirement in the United States; unfortunately, flunixin has become one of the most common violative tissue residues in cull dairy cows at many slaughter plants because of on-farm perivascular and nonintravenous parenteral administration.",

Increasingly in calves, on-farm protocols such as the Wisconsin and California clinical scoring systems are used as health screening tools (see later section) that operators can use to identify individuals with an aggregate of physical examination findings that may justify treatment. The specificity of these clinical scoring systems is high, but sensitivity is much lower for individual calf pneumonia detection. These are commonly used for periodic assessments of large groups of calves and have been principally developed with the goal of improving early identification of disease and reflect efforts to diminish the impact of BRD on preweaning heifer morbidity and mortality. Hopefully, individual or groups of adult cattle with either acute or chronic bronchopneumonia caused by P. multocida would not escape diagnosis because of their clinical signs. Such oversight would be even less likely with M. haemolytica because of the greater clinical severity typically seen with this agent. However, timely diagnosis is a ubiquitous and omnipresent challenge in adults as well as calves with milder clinical illness. In adult dairy cattle, the increased observation and daily examination often afforded to recently postparturient cows means that nasal discharge, cough, fever, and tachypnea are all likely to be picked up quite promptly. Indeed, one must be careful not to attribute a diagnosis of pneumonia too frequently merely on the basis of fever and tachypnea, as is quite common. Unfortunately, pneumonia can become a default diagnosis in febrile adult cattle that are breathing faster than normal when the latter is only a physiologic response to true fever of any cause or indeed hyperthermia that may be environmental in origin during hot weather. Identification of mild respiratory disease in dairy cattle beyond the fresh pen can be a challenge. Observation of feeding behavior and monitoring daily milk weight deviations become the tools by which cows beyond early lactation can be identified for further examination, but dry cattle are most easily overlooked on large dairies. We have been involved in several herd investigations of chronic bronchopneumonia in cattle in early lactation when it was highly probable that the onset of respiratory disease in many individuals occurred late in the previous lactation or during the dry period but was missed during the initial stages because of lesser oversight of cattle at these times. It is also worth emphasizing that such chronic bronchopneumonia \"outbreaks\" in adult cattle are rarely as simple as a single infectious agent that is a new pathogen to the farm; inevitably, the outbreak is multifactorial with components of overstocking, poor ventilation, and nutritional stressors during the transition period often contributing. There has never been, nor will there likely ever be, a replacement for experienced and devoted husbandry that invests time and watchful observation of the individual or groups of cattle for the identification of disease.",

The goals of antiinflammatory medications are to reduce fever, block specific parts or mediators of the inflammatory cycle, and counteract endotoxins released by the cell wall of causative gramnegative organisms, to result in symptomatic improvement through better appetite and attitude. The two general groups of drugs include corticosteroids and NSAIDs such as aspirin and flunixin meglumine. Corticosteroids have a marked antiinflammatory and antipyretic activity that often leads to a \"steroid euphoria\" with resultant improved attitude and appetite within 24 hours. Although corticosteroids have these positive effects and also block several parts of the inflammatory cycle, they are dangerous if used repeatedly or in high dosages. Corticosteroids tend to stabilize small vessels and may reduce some of the chemotactic factors and lysosomal enzymes that cause a vicious cycle of increasing inflammation in the lung. However, they also partially or completely inhibit macrophage activation and antimicrobial peptide expression, which are serious detriments to the defense mechanisms of the lower airway. If the veterinarian elects to use corticosteroids, one treatment of low-dose (10-20 mg/450 kg) dexamethasone may be given as part of the initial therapy and should not be used thereafter. This treatment cannot be used in pregnant cows because of the abortifacient qualities of dexamethasone. Corticosteroids have potent antipyretic properties, and this may lead to a false sense of security because the veterinarian may assume that the proper antibiotic has been used based on a decreasing fever 24 hours after treatment when in fact the antibiotic has not been effective, and fever will return 24 to 48 hours later.

Aspirin may be the safest of the commonly used NSAIDs in cattle and is given at 240 to 480 grains orally twice daily for an adult animal, but flunixin meglumine at 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg IV once daily may be the most effective.

Renal toxicity also is a risk, especially in a dehydrated animal in which the cytoprotective and vascular effects of prostaglandins are essential during reduced renal perfusion.

Some cattle maintain normal respiratory rates but exhibit the other signs. Chronic \u2022 Fig. 4 .43 This mature Holstein cow presented to the hospital for poor production and weight loss. Although the respiratory rate was within normal limits, the cow coughed after rising; had slight head and neck extension when lying down; and, as seen in this photo, had small and intermittent purulent nasal discharge. Pasteurella multocida, Trueperella pyogenes, and Mycoplasma spp. were cultured from a tracheal wash. The cow improved dramatically after tetracycline therapy.",

            "text": "Several species of Mycoplasma, including Mycoplasma dispar, M. bovis, Mycoplasma bovirhinis, and others, have been isolated from the lungs of calves and cattle with pneumonia. In addition, Ureaplasma organisms and occasional isolates of Myco plasma bovigenitalium have been found from lower airway infections in cattle. M. dispar and M. bovis probably are the two major types identified. These organisms may be normal inhabitants of the upper airway in some cattle. Experimentally, Mycoplasma spp. have caused pneumonia in calves when introduced either into the lower airway or via nasal inoculation. This pneumonia is characterized by peribronchiolar and peribronchial lymphoid hyperplasia and purulent bronchiolitis. Lesions usually are limited to the anterior ventral tips of the lung lobes, and the associated clinical signs are mild. Gross inspection at necropsy reveals ventral areas of lung lobes that are red-blue and firm, appearing almost as atelectatic areas, and that ooze purulent material from the airways on cut sections. Mycoplasma pneumonia has been described as a \"cuffing pneumonia\" because lymphoid hyperplasia appears around the airways and expands with chronicity. Mycoplasma organisms have several properties that contribute to their pathogenicity, including inhibition of the mucociliary transport mechanism (at least in humans). In addition, they cause some degree of humoral and cell-mediated immunosuppression in calves and they avoid phagocytosis by attaching to ciliated epithelium above the level of alveolar macrophages. In our clinics, Mycoplasma frequently is isolated from acute and chronic calf pneumonia outbreaks and may be involved in up to 50% of chronic calf pneumonia endemics that we investigate. However, Mycoplasma spp. seldom is the only pathogen isolated in these outbreaks, and one or more of H. somni, P. multocida, and M. haemolytica usually are isolated as well. Because Mycoplasma appears ubiquitous on many farms, we wonder whether the Mycoplasma infection has been present in the calves' lungs for a long time and contributes to impaired host defense against bacterial and viral pathogens or whether the Mycoplasma infection is acute along with the other pathogens. It is also increasingly co-identified with T. pyogenes in cases of chronic suppurative bronchopneumonia. In herds with active Mycoplasma pneumonia, Mycoplasma frequently can be isolated via nasopharyngeal swab from the majority of cows and calves, most of which appear healthy. Therefore the ubiquitous nature of the organism makes it nearly impossible for calves on these farms not to become infected. The subsequent low-grade pneumonia and defense mechanism compromise caused by the Mycoplasma infection may precede the onset of clinical pneumonia associated with other bacterial and viral pathogens. How significant Mycoplasma spp. is to the entire problem is difficult to determine, but we believe it increases the risk of calfhood pneumonia. In addition to pneumonia, M. bovis may also cause otitis media, mastitis, and arthritis once it becomes established in a herd. The spread of Mycoplasma spp. can be significantly increased by the feeding of unpasteurized, infected waste milk. Effective control measures for Mycoplasma when it is ubiquitous on a premise are challenging and made more so because effective vaccines are not available. In endemic herds, the feeding of unpasteurized waste milk is a known risk factor for transmission of the organism to calves, and this practice should be actively discouraged. Pasteurization removes the risk of Mycoplasma spread by this means but only makes economic sense on larger dairies or heifer-rearing operations. When pasteurization is used, periodic quality control assessments by culture are very important to confirm continued equipment efficacy at removing viable Mycoplasma spp. from the milk being fed to the calves. Producers should never assume that these pieces of equipment remain effective over long periods without checking.",

In several calf and heifer outbreaks of pure Mycoplasma pneumonia, the only signs observed were coughing induced by stress or movement of the animals, a slight increase in the respiratory rate (40-60 breaths/min), and low-grade fever (103.5\u00b0 to 105.0\u00b0F [39.72\u00b0 to 40.56\u00b0C]). Most affected animals continued to eat and experienced only mild depression. Owners reported observing a slight mucopurulent nasal discharge in the animals in the mornings that disappeared after the animals became active, ate, and licked their noses clean. Tracheal washes grew pure cultures of Mycoplasma, and no other pathogens were identified by bacterial cultures, viral isolation, PCR, or retrospective paired serology. However, pure Mycoplasma is the exception rather than the rule because, in our clinics, Mycoplasma usually is isolated in conjunction with other pathogens in the majority of pneumonia outbreaks in which it is involved. Signs of pneumonia in these instances are identical to those described for the other specific bacterial or viral agents isolated. The Mycoplasma component does not have any unique clinical features except for its association with otitis media and arthritis in young cattle and perhaps that affected animals sometimes respond poorly to specific antibiotic therapy directed against the bacterial pathogen, especially when the selected antimicrobials have poor efficacy against Mycoplasma organisms. When this occurs, a contributory viral or Mycoplasma infection should always be suspected. Undoubtedly the association between Mycoplasma infection of the lower airways and involvement of this organism with otitis cases in heifer replacement calves preweaning is an increasingly strong one on many farms. It is currently much more common to see comorbid pneumonia and otitis than it is to see the arthritic form in this age of calf. The arthritic form seems to be more common in older, weaned heifers and bulls but can also coexist with the pneumonic form ( Fig. 4.48) .",

Calf hutches and individual rearing of calves may not be effective in preventing Mycoplasma infection in some of these herds, but calf hutches do seem to prevent bacterial infection in the calves pre-weaning. Therefore, as soon as the calves are grouped after weaning, a pneumonia outbreak is caused by both bacterial and Mycoplasma components. Every new group seems to be affected, and attempts at prevention appear futile. Isolation of calves to a separate farm after immediate removal from their dams may be the only solution.

Respiratory disease caused purely by IBR is associated with high morbidity but low mortality in susceptible animals. Fatalities seldom result from primary or recurrent IBR infections unless secondary bacterial bronchopneumonia, especially M. haemolytica, or concurrent viral infection with BVDV or BRSV occurs. (These viruses are discussed further in this section.) The IBR virus compromises the physical and cellular components of the lower airway defense mechanism by damaging mucociliary transport and the mucus layer and directly infecting alveolar macrophages. Therefore combination infections may result in high mortality rates because of multiple agents compromising lower airway host defense mechanisms and possible immunosuppression, especially with concurrent BVDV infection.

Laboratory confirmation is possible by FA techniques during the acute stage (lesions <7 days are best). Scrapings of mucosal lesions and the white plaques in the nasal mucosa should be positive in almost all acute cases. In addition, viral isolation is possible during this time. Undoubtedly, the emphasis for diagnosis in most commercial and state veterinary diagnostic laboratories now rests with PCR, as indeed it does for the majority of viral infections of economic significance in cattle. Amplification of viral DNA using highly specific and sensitive primers for BHV1 can be performed on airway fluid samples, nasopharyngeal swabs, and fresh tissue. This greatly facilitates the accurate and timely diagnosis of BHV1 infection. However, there is one note of caution regarding PCR tests for the diagnosis of BHV1 in that one must obtain an accurate vaccine history when submitting samples or interpreting test results. It is evident (Dr. Keith Poulsen, Wisconsin State Diagnostic Laboratory, personal communication) that recent modified live virus administration can give a false-positive PCR result because of vaccinal virus, on some occasions for up to 14 days after administration. Additional testing using sequencing would be necessary for distinguishing vaccine from field strains. Positive PCR results after IBR vaccination appear to be a more pronounced phenomenon with intranasal products compared with parenterally administered vaccines. We have performed PCR diagnostics on a number of respiratory disease cases when it was only on later questioning that the recent vaccination event was discovered; frequently, vaccination was performed in the face of clinical disease in a sick patient, possibly serving to prolong shedding. Unfortunately, with BHV1, there is also the possibility of latent viral recrudescence from nervous tissue in a sick animal whose primary disease has suppressed its immune system. Individual sick cows with septic mastitis, septic metritis, bacterial pneumonia, and so forth may show typical IBR plaques as a result of recrudescence of latent virus of natural or live vaccine origin during their illness. A diagnosis of primary IBR should not be made in these cattle. Although the plaque represents the only manifestation of BHV1 disease seen in such immunocompromised animals, importantly, they may be a contagious risk for in-contact and naive animals. There are consequently a number of factors to consider when interpreting the significance of a positive PCR result for BHV1, especially in an animal with only limited clinical signs. Paired serum (acute and then convalescent, 14-21 days later) samples provide another means of positive diagnosis.",

The virus certainly may have been present for much longer, but new diagnostic procedures, improved technology in virology, and recognition of the virus and its pathophysiology have heightened awareness of this disease. The virus is a pneumovirus within the paramyxovirus family and is distinctly different from the bovine syncytial virus (BSV), which is a spumavirus in the retrovirus family. There is no current evidence that the BSV is a pathogen in cattle. Respiratory disease caused by BRSV was first reported in Europe during the 1970s and has been recognized throughout the United States since the 1980s in endemic form in beef and dairy cattle. Observations from both experimental and natural disease have been reported, and it is now accepted that BRSV was likely the cause of many poorly defined epidemics heretofore diagnosed as \"atypical interstitial pneumonia\" (AIP) in calves and adult cattle. It also is likely that BRSV infection has preceded, and predisposed cattle to, severe bacterial bronchopneumonia but gone undiagnosed because of overwhelming bacterial lesions.",

            "text": "The virus produces a humoral antibody response, which is helpful both for diagnosis and epidemiologic surveys. Based on surveys completed in several regions of the United States, BRSV infection appears common in cattle because more than 50% of adult cattle surveyed have titers to BRSV. More recent work suggests that up to 70% of calves have now been exposed to BRSV by breeding age. The virus has caused sporadic clinical disease in dairy cattle and calves and probably has gone undiagnosed frequently. Outbreaks of BRSV may be limited to calves, affect only adult cows, or can involve all animals in a herd. Morbidity is high, but mortality as a result of BRSV infection is much lower unless secondary bacterial bronchopneumonia ensues. The virus apparently does not infect alveolar macrophages but may damage physical defense mechanisms of the lower airway, such as mucociliary transport, and may lead to antigen-antibody complexes that subsequently engage complement and result in damage to the lower airway. Although experimental reproduction of the clinical disease has not been consistently successful in challenge studies, recent studies have helped further explain the pathogenesis of the disease. Two-to 6-month-old calves have been successfully infected and have marked production of inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor, interleukins 6 and 8, and interferon); these are thought to help promote viral clearance but may also have a pathogenic role in causing airway obstruction. Previous work suggests that BRSV alters macrophage function sufficiently to short cycle and depress responsiveness of lymphocytes. In any event, interstitial pneumonia, secondary bacterial pneumonia, airway obstruction, and pneumothorax are very common after BRSV infection. Many unexplained facets of BRSV infection persist despite the proliferation of research on the virus. For example, BRSV infection often arises in herds that appear to have excellent management and have not purchased new cattle, shipped and returned existing cattle, or stressed animals in any apparent way. Where did the infection come from in these herds? Was it latent in a recovered animal, or was it introduced by regular visitors to the farm? Cattle are thought to be the reservoir, but it has not yet been shown how or why the virus activates, replicates, and spreads to cause all clinical epidemics. In closed herds that experience recurrent infections, there appears to be a high degree of sequence variation among BRSV isolates associated with clinical disease, suggesting that BRSV populations may be heterogeneous and relatively diverse, challenging control and prevention even in well-managed herds.",

            "text": "The signs of acute BRSV range from inapparent to fulminant. In most outbreaks, acute BRSV infection causes high morbidity in the affected group within several days to 1 week. Clinical signs include high fever (104.0\u00b0 to 108.0\u00b0F [40.0\u00b0 to 42.22\u00b0C]); depression, anorexia, decreased milk production, salivation and serous or mucoid nasal discharge. The degree of dyspnea varies from a merely increased respiratory rate (40-100 breaths/min) to openmouth breathing. Also, in all but the mildest outbreaks, a percentage of the affected cattle will have SC emphysema palpable under the skin of the dorsum, especially near the withers (Fig. 4.54) . Auscultation of the lungs in acute cases may reveal a wide range of sounds. Increased bronchovesicular sounds, bronchial tones, fine crepitation caused by emphysema, and rales (usually as a result of secondary bacterial bronchopneumonia) have been described. Practitioners have found that the lungs may auscultate as diffusely very quiet or almost inaudible in acutely affected cattle in some outbreaks. This has been a very important sign and initially appears in contrast to the outward signs of dyspnea displayed by these cattle. However, the relative deficit of airway sounds fits the existing pathology because pneumothorax or diffuse interstitial pulmonary edema and emphysema compress the small airways and cause the lungs to be quieter than one would expect (Fig. 4.55) . This is the same phenomenon that occurs in proliferative pneumonia in which the alveoli and small airways are obliterated or reduced in size. If secondary bacterial pneumonia occurs, bronchial tones or rales are heard in the anterior ventral lung region, and the dorsal and caudal lungs become quieter because of mechanical overwork, increasing the degree of edema and emphysema. Dyspnea is severe in such cases, and affected animals usually show open-mouth breathing and an audible grunt or groan with each expiration (see Video Clip 4.11). This dyspnea is more obvious if affected animals are stressed by handling or being made to move. Despite the high fevers and respiratory distress, affected cattle frequently do not look septic (e.g., severe depression, scleral injection) as with acute overwhelming bacterial pneumonia. There does appear to be some seasonality to outbreaks in the northern United States, with most occurring in the fall or winter. A biphasic disease progression may occur in some cattle with BRSV infection. The first stage or phase of the disease is characterized by mild or more serious signs as described earlier. The affected animals apparently improve over the next few days only to develop peracute severe respiratory distress several days to several weeks after their initial improvement. Because these animals initially appeared to have mild disease and responded to treatment, this secondary phase is entirely unexpected. Secondary acute dyspnea is thought to reflect an immune-mediated disease caused by hypersensitivity or a severe T helper 2 response in the lower airway and lung parenchyma and is frequently fatal.",

These signs are rarely seen in calves younger than 6 weeks, but calves aged 2 to 6 months seem to be most commonly affected. Auscultation of the lungs in acute cases may be helpful if the lungs sound diffusely quiet despite obvious severe dyspnea. The veterinarian must be cautious in diagnosing BRSV based only on the finding of SC emphysema or pneumothorax in some animals. Any severe pneumonia (especially other interstitial pneumonias or severe consolidating bronchopneumonia) can also cause SC emphysema because the only remaining normal lung tissue (dorsal or caudal lung fields) is overworked to the point at which emphysema and interstitial edema are likely. Therefore, SC emphysema may be suggestive of, but not pathognomonic for, BRSV. Thoracic radiographs will commonly reveal findings suggestive of diffuse interstitial pneumonia (Fig. 4.56) . As with most of the diseases discussed thus far, laboratory confirmation is the only definitive means to confirm a diagnosis of BRSV. Virus isolation from tracheal wash fluid or necropsy specimens has been used but is often unrewarding because BRSV is quickly cleared, or a rapidly developing secretory antibody neutralizes the virus within the respiratory tract. FA techniques may be used for tracheal wash samples, nasopharyngeal swabs, and necropsy specimens of infected lung. The advent of PCR has made a significant and positive impact on our ability to accurately diagnose BRSV. Both conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays for the viral genome and real-time RT-PCR for BRSV detection are markedly superior in terms of sensitivity to either immunofluorescence or virus isolation. Diagnostic, multiplex RT-PCR kits that also detect parainfluenza-3 (PI3) and BHV1 are often used but as discussed under the section on BHV1, one has to be careful of false-positive PCR tests when modified live viral vaccines have been recently (<14 days) administered. Serology can be helpful in establishing a diagnosis of BRSV because a marked humoral antibody titer occurs in response to the infection. Baker and Frey emphasize that antibody titers may increase early after acute infection and often peak before 2 weeks postinfection. Therefore, collection of serum on day 1 and day 14 would be important when evaluating seroconversion to BRSV. The same authors state that young calves may have titers derived from colostrum. These titers, indicative of passive immunity, are only partially protective against BRSV infection but can interfere with vaccinal responses in young calves. Thus, older calves, heifers, or adult animals are better populations to sample.",

There is often extensive lobular or lobar consolidation affecting the cranial, middle, and accessory lobes surrounded by lobules of more normal, pink, overinflated lung. The caudodorsal lungs typically fail to collapse and are distended by interlobular, interlobar, and subpleural emphysema and edema (Figs. 4.57 and 4.58) .

As bronchitis and bronchiolitis ensue, purulent exudate fills some small airways. Despite this pathology, PI3 infection is a mild disease unless complicated by secondary bacterial agents. Based on serologic surveys, most cattle probably have been exposed to PI3 infection as calves. We seldom identify PI3 in bovine respiratory outbreaks in dairy calves or cows in the northern United States.

This pestivirus from the Flaviviridae family causes fever, mucosal erosions, diarrhea, abortions or reproductive failure, congenital anomalies, persistent infection of fetuses infected between 40 and 120 days of gestation, and many other signs. The disease is discussed fully in Chapter 6. However, BVDV has been incriminated as a \"respiratory virus\" in cattle, and some strains can certainly be isolated from the lower airway and alveolar macrophages of infected cattle. Some BVDV strains (genotypes 1a and 1b of the non-cytopathogenic biotype) are more commonly found in the lungs of cattle and are frequently associated with respiratory disease outbreaks. All strains of BVDV are immunosuppressive and predispose infected cattle to bacterial or other viral pneumonia. Naive cattle exposed to a type 2 strain may develop severe interstitial pneumonia, thrombocytopenia, bone marrow necrosis, diarrhea, and acute death, sometimes without having mucosal erosions. Additionally, a persistently infected calf or cow may suddenly develop bacterial pneumonia without other predisposing factors, and this scenario should be considered as a possible reason for a single case of bacterial pneumonia in a herd.",

Because the high fever necessitates increased physiologic heat loss, some cows have mild increases in their respiratory rate (40-60 breaths/min), but the lungs are normal on auscultation or may have slightly increased bronchovesicular sounds. These cattle are merely in the early stages of acute BVDV infection, and unless a superimposed bacterial infection develops, true clinical pneumonia may not occur. If the animal seroconverts and responds to the BVDV in a normal fashion, no other signs may develop. Some cattle will progress from this early stage of fever with no other overt signs to blatant mucosal lesions and diarrhea 7 to 14 days after the original onset of fever. This situation has been observed in natural outbreaks and with experimental BVDV infection with certain strains of BVDV in naive cattle.

Although naive or susceptible cattle fully recover immune function after the development of adequate humoral antibody against BVDV, they are very susceptible to secondary infection during the acute BVDV infection and associated immunosuppression. Alveolar macrophages are frequently infected with BVDV, which would be expected to have a direct negative effect on lung protection against invading bacteria. Therefore, the results can be devastating if a cow or a group of cattle acutely infected with BVDV has the bad fortune to become infected with P. multocida, M. haemolytica, or H. somni at the same time. Bacterial bronchopneumonia may progress rapidly because host defense mechanisms are negligible. In addition, cattle may die so quickly from severe pneumonia that necropsy identifies bacterial pneumonia as the sole cause of death. The existence of BVDV infection will only be confirmed if specific PCR, viral isolation, antigen detection, or immunohistochemistry is performed. Some affected cows develop signs of mucosal disease, or some fatalities demonstrate typical BVDV lesions as well as bacterial pneumonia at necropsy.

Many M. bovis infections that become chronic and lifelong are acquired in calfhood, and the major manifestations of illness in milk-fed calves are pneumonia and otitis. Feeding of contaminated colostrum or waste milk is thought to be the primary means of transmitting Mycoplasma to young calves. Aerosol spread or transmission by direct contact may subsequently occur to calves housed with, or very near, infected cohorts. Use of colostrum replacer, milk replacer, and pasteurization of waste milk and colostrum are all strategies to reduce exposure of young calves. Heat treating colostrum to less than standard milk pasteurization temperatures is effective in killing important calf pathogens without damaging the immunoglobulins. As colostrum pasteurization becomes more commonplace, it is probable that many dairies will turn to this technique as a means of reducing the pathogen burden that calves are exposed to in the immediate postnatal period. Standard pasteurization procedures are already commonly used to successfully treat waste milk before feeding it to calves.

Late fall and early spring, as well as winter thaws, are the times most likely to vary widely in temperature and humidity. Increased humidity and ammonia accumulation both occur in areas with inadequate ventilation. Ammonia dissolves in the suspended water vapor and is an irritant to the respiratory epithelium. Exhaled bacteria and viruses are included in microscopic droplets of moisture. Prevention of respiratory infections in these settings requires improvement in the ventilation to dilute the pathogens and remove the irritants. If the walls or ceiling accumulate condensation or the odor of ammonia in the barn is noticeable, there is inadequate ventilation. Normally, the inside temperature in these barns in winter should not exceed 50\u00b0F (10\u00b0C). All modern free-stall barns in cold climates are now curtain sided and these can be adjusted according to weather conditions in the winter to allow adequate fresh air entry for removal of humidity and ammonia. A temperature gradient of only a few degrees between inside and outside is frequently adequate to drive the necessary air exchanges for maintaining air quality inside the barn. A useful resource for facilities design for housing of dairy cattle is provided by the University of Wisconsin through partnerships with private industry; https://thedairylandinitiative.vetmed.wisc.edu Whenever possible, prevention of infectious respiratory disease in dairy cattle is more desirable than treatment and control measures. Prevention consists both of effective vaccination programs and management designed to reduce the probability of infectious respiratory disease. Currently, highly effective vaccines are available for IBR, PI3, and BVDV. Strong, enduring vaccinal protection against BRSV infection is probably the most sought after advance in the immunoprophylaxis of viral BRD because outbreaks continue to occur in vaccinated herds. More recent MLV products administered intranasally offer the best opportunity for improved prevention and should be incorporated into all herd programs. Vaccines against H. somni and P. multocida, although available, have equivocal evidence-based literature in terms of disease prevention and economic benefit. The relevance of vaccines for protection against disease caused by opportunistic colonization of lower airways by these commensal pharyngeal organisms will likely always remain contentious. Newer vaccines against M. haemolytica that are based on leukotoxins of this bacterium have been proven beneficial in reducing morbidity and mortality rates in cattle. Such commercial products are often combined with antigens of P. multocida.",

            "text": "Vaccination strategies for herds should be individually determined and include the assessment of risk for all age groups. Closed herds in isolated settings have a much lower risk of contagious pathogen acquisition than herds that continuously purchase animals or exhibit cattle. However, mortality rates in heifer calves are frequently high enough that many dairies continue to purchase replacement animals merely in order to maintain herd numbers. This need to purchase cattle is only accentuated if the dairy is attempting to expand in size. Regardless, primary immunization requires two doses of vaccine and is best done at an early age. Optimal response to viral vaccines occurs after the waning of colostrally derived antibodies. Thus, current general recommendations are to begin the primary series at about 3 months of age with the second dose administered 2 to 4 weeks later. Recent research indicates the greatest response to immunization against IBR and BVDV occurs if the first two doses are a killed product and the subsequent booster is a modified live vaccine. All major vaccine producers offer combination products with options for killed or modified live virus that provide the four major viral components in a single injection. The M. haemolytica leukotoxoids are a distinct product but may be combined with P. multocida. Subsequent boosters are administered at frequencies that correspond to the perceived risk and usually at times or ages that offer some convenience to management. The duration of immunity after proper vaccination is mostly not known for each of the components of the routinely used products. Thus, recommendations for low-risk herds may be annual revaccination of the entire herd, but high-risk herds may be given boosters two or three times per year. Alternatively, in many large herds, adults are vaccinated in conjunction with the lactation cycle. For example, a modified live booster is given at 30 days in milk, and killed boosters are given at 120 and 240 days of gestation. When boosters are given at specific points in the lactation cycle, one must be aware of the negative influence that poor reproductive performance or management decisions such as use for embryo transfer or oocyte donation will have on the efficiency of the program. We have seen a number of situations when either on a herd level or for individually valuable cattle, the decision to booster for example at dry-off has meant a 5-to 6-month delay between the booster and the onset of the next lactation, or an early lactation vaccine booster has been separated by over 6 months from the average time of early gestation in the next pregnancy. These circumstances can also contrive to lessen the value of colostrum as a means of adequacy of passive transfer.",

Viruses commonly isolated from calves with respiratory signs and which may cause primary disease include BRSV, BHV1, and PI3. Infection by bovine viral diarrhea virus increases the susceptibility of the calf to disease but is not usually a primary cause of disease. Coronavirus is commonly isolated from the nasopharynx; however, the role of this pathogen in BRD is still under debate. Interestingly, the increasing research use of metagenomics and deep sequencing during the investigation of BRD is serving to rapidly and markedly increase the number of bovine viruses that can be detected in clinical cases. These types of investigations are not yet \"routine\" for the workup of field cases, but there is undoubtedly a plethora of new viruses (bovine rhinitis A and B, bovine adenovirus, bovine influenza D, and others) in addition to bovine coronavirus that have been previously uncharacterized but that can be found in clinically pneumonic cattle but only rarely in healthy case control animals. The relevance of these agents, as stated with coronavirus, is uncertain from a causal perspective but should be an active area of research in the near future. Viral infection with pathogens often causes destruction of the respiratory epithelium, resulting in impaired mucociliary function and secondary bacterial infection from pathogens normally residing in the nasopharynx. Bacterial respiratory pathogens include Pasteurella multocida, M. haemolytica, T. pyogenes, and less commonly, H. somni and possibly Biberstei nia trehalosi. Mycoplasma bovis is also of increasing relevance in endemic respiratory disease problems in calves.

In the northern United States, the goal should be approximately four changes per hour in the winter and up to 45 to 60 changes in the summer. Unfortunately, wind is not always present; therefore, these barns require fresh air exchange systems that are supplemented by mechanical ventilation. This is particularly important in the winter when curtains are closed to regulate the barn temperature. Negative pressure, or tunnel ventilation, is not commonly used in calf barns because of problems associated with proper distribution of air within the calf pens, particularly in the winter. Occasionally, \"neutral-pressure\" ventilation is used by which clean air is pushed in and old air is forced out by mechanical means. The most common method of supplementing fresh air is through positive-pressure ventilation (PPV). In PPV, a fan directs small amounts of clean, fresh air through a distribution tube fitted with strategically sized holes (Fig. 4.63) . Old, stagnant air passively leaves the barn through an open ridge, simultaneously removing pathogens and noxious chemicals. Whichever system is used, thorough documentation of the efficacy in achieving the appropriate air exchanges without creating drafts on the calves is essential. Air speed can be quantitatively assessed using anemometers, and air movement can be qualitatively assessed using an insect fogger. These tools help identify drafts as well as areas of dead air. Air sampling units can also be used to culture the pen air at the level of the calf. High-quality pen air should have bacterial counts of less than 30,000 CFU/m 3 on blood agar plates.

Several studies have shown that administration of a parenteral vaccine in a seropositive calf will not achieve the same immunologic response as that from a seronegative or colostrum-deprived calf.",

However, this should never be used as justification on farm for poor colostral management or timeliness of colostrum delivery nor as a potential \"upside\" to FPT or partial passive transfer. In general terms, it is also a very weak argument for precocious vaccination protocols in preweaned heifer replacements. That being said, it is worth pointing out that mucosal vaccination via the intranasal rather than by the parenteral route may provide an option to bypass this problem for some infectious agents.",

One of the authors (TO) has also demonstrated that this same viral vaccine can reduce the probability of developing ultrasonographic lung lesions. Recently, an intranasal vaccine against Pasteurella multocida and M. haemolytica has also become available commercially in the United States, although peer-reviewed literature regarding its efficacy is lacking. In general, vaccination protocols for young calves should be designed keeping in mind the specific infectious pressures for the individual farm, and should never serve as a replacement for good management. Multiple doses of a parenteral, modified live viral vaccine before and/or just after weaning are costly, time consuming, and may negatively impact feed intakes.",

To date, there is no evidence that this strategy has any merit. Rather, the environmental and management ideas discussed earlier are more likely to provide health and economic returns to the herd. Another widely used strategy for undifferentiated respiratory disease of recently weaned calves is metaphylaxis of the at-risk group. Current practice in many dairies is to wean a group of calves and move them within 1 week or so to group housing. This change, particularly when more than 10 calves in a group are moved at one time, seems to be a trigger for respiratory disease. Control has been achieved in many herds with mass medication at the time of a move with a single injection of a long-acting antibiotic such as oxytetracycline, tilmicosin, tulathromycin, or florfenicol, or by feeding chlortetracycline and sulfamethazine pellets for 5 to 7 days.

Increasingly, the majority, if not all, of these are the day-to-day responsibility of farm personnel, not veterinarians. However, there is a pivotal and essential role for veterinarians in the establishment and oversight of each of the first four of the listed items. Periodic reassessment and quality control of each facet of BRD control must involve the veterinarian, and for the veterinarian's input to be most effective and respected, he or she needs to be consistently on farm and up to date.

In such situations, precautions, including working with younger animals first, hand washing, use of gloves, and changing coveralls and boots, will help avoid transmission of disease from older cattle to the younger calves.

The most widely used system, the Wisconsin Calf Scoring Chart (WCSC), divides the response to respiratory disease into five categories; body temperature, nasal discharge, cough, ocular discharge, and ear position. Each category is assigned 0 to 3 points corresponding to the subjective level of abnormality (0 = normal, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severely abnormal), and the total number of points is summed to arrive at an overall respiratory score. Calves with two abnormal categories are considered sick, and treatment is recommended.

Each of these systems correctly classified approximately 90% of the animals and required less handling than the WCSC. Although these scoring systems are not intended to act as gold standards for the diagnosis of BRD, they can serve as a useful means of identifying a large proportion of clinically affected calves under some conditions, particularly when one considers that any on-farm scoring technique must be practically useful, repeatable, and consistent in the hands of non-veterinarians. At the very least, such periodic assessments increase observation of calves by attentive individuals who are invested, possibly both personally and financially, in improving calf health. The DART (depression, appetite, respiratory, and temperature) system is another type of screening system that relies on the presence of depression, inappetence, abnormal respiratory pattern, and fever, to indicate when treatment is necessary. Unfortunately, these signs are not consistent in ill calves, and systematic cutpoints have not been well established. However, examination is warranted if a calf does demonstrate these signs. Calves that are standing for excessive periods after feeding when herdmates are resting (or vice versa) should also be evaluated.",

In significant part, clinical scoring is a response to the reality of increased intensification with regard to dairy calf rearing, serving to increase the risk of BRD alongside an increasing awareness and relevancy of the economic impact of respiratory disease in the first 2 months of life. It has coincided with a change in veterinary involvement on many farms from the day-to-day diagnosis and treatment of individual animals to a more population-based approach dictated by the value of individual grade cattle.

Furthermore, ultrasonography provides diagnostic advantages in terms of accuracy over clinical scoring. Recently, the WCSC, thoracic auscultation, and treatment records of 106 calves from 13 Canadian dairy farms were compared with the results of thoracic ultrasonography in a cross-sectional study. Using an ultrasonography cutoff of 1 cm, and lung consolidation as a case definition; the sensitivity and specificity of the WCSC were 55% and 58%, respectively; and the sensitivity of thoracic auscultation compared with ultrasonography ranged from 3% to 17%. This provides strong evidence that both clinical scoring and auscultation underestimate the prevalence of lung lesions in dairy calves compared with thoracic ultrasonography. Importantly, thoracic ultrasonography is no longer the province of referral clinics and university teaching hospitals, and it is increasingly common for it to be used by practitioners on farm for reasons of diminishing equipment cost as well as the fact that medium frequency linear probes that double up for reproductive use are excellent for thoracic ultrasonography.",

The inter-observer agreement varied from moderate to almost perfect (kappa = 0.6-1.0) depending on the experience level of the observer. Another study assessing lung lesions post mortem previously identified by ultrasonography after experimental bacterial infection documented excellent agreement between the postmortem examination and ultrasound distribution of lesions. In calves with subclinical lung lesions, the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasonography were an impressive 94% and 100%, respectively.

Individual, poor-doing calves should have a complete diagnostic examination performed. Prognosis is worse for individual calves with caudal lung lobe involvement, abscessation, or poor body condition identified during the ultrasound examination. Several studies have reported on the measured depth of the ultrasonographic consolidation over several locations on the thorax. It has been determined that the maximum depth of consolidation is well correlated to the number of locations with consolidation. Categorical scoring systems, however, are easier and more practical for assessing the severity and type of lung lesions versus measuring the amount of consolidation. An easy-to-use, 6-point scoring system is outlined in Table 4 .2. Based on comparative histopathology, calves with ultrasound scores of 3 to 5 have lobar bacterial bronchopneumonia. Score 2 lesions are typically viral in nature when the lesions are smaller than 1 cm in diameter. Calves scoring 0 or 1 are typically normal. Lobular lesions (score 2) represent discrete areas of consolidation within otherwise aerated lung (Fig. 4.70 and see Video Clip 4.12) . In other words, the normal hyperechoic pleural interface with reverberation artifact can be seen dorsal and ventral to the lung lesion. Lobar lesions indicate that there is full-thickness consolidation of the lung lobe (see Fig. 4 .64 and see Video Clip 4.8).

Because infective larvae have been shown to survive winter conditions, pastures should not be grazed in the early spring. Before being pastured, yearling heifers should be treated with anthelmintics effective against D. viviparus, and all animals should be treated routinely with anthelmintics at monthly intervals if the animals are to be placed on contaminated pastures. Targeted strategic anthelminthic treatments are sometimes used in endemic areas in efforts to reduce the development of anthelminthic resistance rather than automatic, repeated deworming based on a calendar date. This approach would also be of benefit from the perspective of diminishing drug resistance among conventional GI nematodes such as Ostertagia because on most occasions, deworming treatments during the grazing season try to control multiple nematode populations. Moisture promotes survival and activity of infective larvae. Highlighting this fact, clinical lungworm infections in the northern United States are observed primarily during wet summers. We have seen it as a herd problem in grazing herds, especially when pasture burdens build up during the late summer months from infected heifers and adult cows become reinfected when grazing those same pastures. Similarly, we have observed outbreaks in the lactating herd when they were allowed to graze pasture that had been fertilized with manure from replacement heifers. Whenever possible, extreme care and additional anthelmintic treatment are indicated during wet summers and when animals are pastured in swampy, low-level endemic areas. The use of an irradiated live D. viviparus vaccine has been an integral part of lungworm control in other areas of the world for many years but does not form part of the routine vaccination program for dairy cattle in the United States.

Perhaps the close anatomic proximity of the bronchial arteries to the pulmonary circulation or potential extension of pulmonary abscesses into the venous side of the pulmonary capillary network explains the apparent arterial blood loss.

White muscle disease may on rare occasion cause similar problems in adult cattle. Iatrogenic inhalation pneumonia in calves follows inadvertent intubation of the trachea with stomach tubes or esophageal feeders or, more commonly, from use of abnormally large holes on the end of nipple bottles that overwhelm the calf 's ability to swallow and \"flood\" the airway. Nipple bottles used to feed calves should only drip milk when the bottle is turned upside down! Prematurity or dysmaturity may also predispose to inhalation pneumonia as a result of incompletely developed laryngeal protective reflexes (Fig. 4.83) . Bottle feeding weak calves while recumbent is another common cause of aspiration pneumonia. Inhalation pneumonia may also occur from oral dosing of large volumes of medication (e.g., Pepto-Bismol, mineral oil) with the head held in an elevated position. Inhalation pneumonia also may follow pharyngeal trauma by stomach tubes, esophageal feeders, or balling guns, resulting in dysphagia or neurogenic swallowing deficits.

Choke, although rare in dairy cattle today, certainly represents a significant predisposing cause of inhalation pneumonia as well. Cattle that have choked on vegetables or other feedstuffs should be assessed carefully for early signs of inhalation pneumonia. Occasionally, cattle in dorsal recumbency for surgery, whether under sedation or general anesthesia, may regurgitate and inhale feed material into the trachea and lower airways. Consideration of this potential outcome when deciding on a surgical approach in a high-risk patient makes obvious sense. For general anesthesia, the selection of an endotracheal tube with the correct diameter can help preserve and protect the airway, and holding the cow off feed for at least 24 hours before performing elective surgery in dorsal recumbency may also diminish the risk of aspiration.",

Smaller volumes of milk (calves with white muscle disease) or feed inhaled into the lower airway cause a septic bronchopneumonia as the microorganisms contained in the causative material proliferate. In this instance, signs are progressive in nature and consist of a fever poorly responsive to antibiotics, dyspnea, rapid respirations, and rales or bronchial tones in both anterior ventral lung fields (unless the animal was in lateral recumbency at the time of inhalation, in which case the major portion of the pathology may occur in only one lung).

As a result of this contact, moist tissue rapidly desiccates followed by necrosis as the chemical dehydrates the tissue. Corneal edema, epithelial necrosis, and corneal stromal burns immediately develop in the eyes. The mucosa of the respiratory tract is burned, and after dehydration, sloughs and diphtheritic membranes fill the airways, leading to hypoxia or suffocation.

NSAIDs may be used at regular dosages without the additional specific risks presented by corticosteroids. However, NSAIDs probably do not block the ongoing pathophysiology of lower airway disease as effectively as corticosteroids. Prophylactic systemic antibiotics are reported not to influence the subsequent development of bacterial bronchopneumonia. Some literature regarding treatment of thermal and chemical injury to the respiratory tract in humans discourages the use of prophylactic antibiotics for fear of allowing resistant strains of bacteria to emerge in the lower airway. In cattle, especially valuable ones, broad-spectrum antibiotics usually are used on a prophylactic basis, although no controlled data support their use. Tetracyclines may help decrease inflammation via their inhibitory effect on metalloproteinases.

Thymic lymphosarcoma may be the most obvious neoplasm within this group. Thymic lymphosarcoma is recognized in cattle between 4 and 24 months of age and causes progressive dyspnea, bloat, or both. It is a sporadic form of lymphosarcoma in cattle, meaning that it is not associated with bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection. Swelling is often obvious in the distal ventral cervical area and extends through the thoracic inlet. Some thymic lymphosarcoma masses are soft, fluid-like swellings on palpation (Fig. 4.94 ), but others are firmer. Compression of the trachea, esophagus, and jugular veins results in dyspnea, interference with eructation, and jugular distention that varies with the size of the mass. Compression of the trachea, causing respiratory distress, may also occur in adult cattle with enzootic BLVassociated lymphosarcoma. Adult lymphosarcoma may be associated with tumor formation in the thorax as a result of lymph node, pleural, cardiac, and occasionally pulmonary involvement. Signs vary depending on the tumor numbers, size, and other organs affected. Occasionally, patients with lymphosarcoma have fever caused by tumor necrosis, and this may be a misleading sign because otherwise they should be afebrile. Severe pleural effusion with many neoplastic lymphocytes may occur. The pleural effusion caused by lymphosarcoma is often grossly discolored, having a bloody appearance. Thymomas are rare in cattle.",

Several case reports have documented malignant neoplasms such as bronchiolar adenocarcinoma in older cows showing signs of progressive dyspnea. Dr. Rebhun documented one older cow and one bull with massive pulmonary adenocarcinomas that resulted in progressive dyspnea, weight loss, and reduced lung sounds. Mesotheliomas within the thorax originate from the pleura and tend to be multiple. They may enlarge collectively to create signs of progressive dyspnea, decreased lung sounds caused by massive pleural effusion, and weight loss, eventually leading to death. Of the small number of patients with mesothelioma that we have seen, they have all had dual body cavity effusions to some degree with both thoracic (pleural) and abdominal fluid accumulation. Tuberculosis, although rare in dairy cattle because of regulatory control efforts, should be remembered as a potential cause of progressive dyspnea, coughing, weight loss, and signs of pneumonia. Enlarged thoracic lymph nodes associated with the infection may result in esophageal compression and bloat or obvious respiratory distress from tracheal compression.

After absorption of 3-meth ylindole from the rumen into the systemic circulation the cytochrome P450 system metabolizes the chemical, producing pneumotoxicity in Clara cells and type 1 pneumocytes. Experimental studies have confirmed that 3-methylindole is the toxic metabolite of tryptophan involved in classic ABPE. Calves seldom are affected, but adult animals older than 2 years of age in good body condition appear most at risk.",

The toxic principle is Perilla ketone rather than 3-methylindole. Cattle can develop identical signs when fed sweet potatoes blighted with the mold Fusarium solani, which produces the propneumotoxin 4-ipomeanol.

This single animal develops an acute severe respiratory distress syndrome with tachypnea, hyperpnea, an elevated heart rate, open-mouth breathing, fever (103.0\u00b0 to 106.0\u00b0F [39.44\u00b0 to 41.11\u00b0C]), and pulmonary edema.

All newborn calves with respiratory distress should have their heart auscultated properly to rule out congenital heart defects. An arterial sample can be collected from the brachial or auricular arteries ( Fig.  4 .103) to confirm the severity of the hypoxemia. It should be noted that newborn healthy calves may have PaO 2 values of 55 to 60 mm Hg during the first 30 to 60 minutes of life. In many cases with respiratory distress, the PCO 2 will be elevated, and this can be confirmed by a venous sample (>45 mm Hg). If the CO 2 is elevated in a rapidly breathing calf, the PaO 2 will be extremely low. Pulse oximetry is useful in calves after the first hour of life to confirm the hypoxemia and for monitoring therapy. A chest radiograph will reveal diffuse underinflation of the lung and parenchymal collapse.

Lifting those calves by the hind legs for 10 seconds, suctioning each nostril for 5 seconds, or irritating the nostril with a piece of straw may be helpful in removing excessive fluid from the airways. Prolonged suction or suspension by the hind legs should definitely be avoided because they would make the calf more hypoxic. Vitamin E and selenium should be given IM. Intranasal humidified oxygen must be administered at 5 to 8 L/min as soon as possible in an attempt to improve tissue oxygenation and decrease reflex pulmonary artery constriction (Fig. 4.104 ). If the calf is premature and the accompanying respiratory distress is severe, nasal cannulas in both nostrils and high-flow humidified oxygen may be needed. This is considered to have a number of physiological advantages compared with standard oxygen therapies, including reduced anatomical dead space, higher FiO 2 , and positive end-expiratory pressure, which may keep the terminal airways and alveoli open, improving lung compliance. It is best to not let the calves lie in lateral recumbency as this has a negative effect on ventilation and oxygenation. Newborn calves with respiratory distress are almost always given prophylactic antibiotics and a plasma transfusion if plasma immunoglobulin G is low. One dose of corticosteroid (10 mg of dexamethasone) is often given and empirically does seem to help, especially after meconium aspiration.

If surfactant is available, it should be given to the calf via intratracheal instillation or less commonly by direct tracheal injection, or it can be nebulized. Commercially prepared surfactant is preferred, but we have collected surfactant from healthy donor cows by BAL using 100 mL of sterile saline and then using the top (foamy) part of the collection for intratracheal administration or nebulization. The calf should be turned over in dorsal recumbency for 10 seconds immediately after surfactant is placed in the trachea to facilitate its distribution into all or most areas of the lungs. The surfactant seems to be more effective when given early in the disease process. If a response is noted it may need to be repeated several times as the life of the exogenous surfactant is short. We have also nebulized affected calves with acetylcysteine while they were being administered an aminophylline drip (5 mg/ kg over 2 hours). The aminophylline not only serves as a bronchodilator but also has antiinflammatory properties and helps maintain diaphragm strength. In regions where beta agonist inhalation bronchodilator treatment is legal this might also improve both surfactant production and mucociliary clearance; however, the treatment is illegal in cattle in the United States. Fluids (crystalloids and colloids such as plasma) may be given IV as a continuous drip if needed but the calf should not be overhydrated. The calf should be gradually warmed if it is hypothermic. We have also administered thyrotropin-releasing factor or thyroxine (2-5 \u03bcg/kg orally once daily) or both, in hopes of increasing surfactant production. Although thyroid hormones are known to be important in prenatal lung development, most studies have been unable to demonstrate a benefit of thyroxine treatment on lung maturation when administered after birth. If pulmonary gas exchange cannot be sufficiently improved with these methods and the owners request further treatment, the calf can be placed on a mechanical ventilator, but this is expensive (Fig. 4.105) . It is sometimes more difficult to keep calves quiet on a ventilator compared with foals. Cloned calves with ascites and enlarged umbilical vessels have low survival rates even when placed on the ventilator. A short-term alternative to machine-driven mechanical ventilation is to continuously or intermittently use an Ambu bag to inflate the lung. Another alternative on the farm is to use a commercially sold calf resuscitator/ aspirator. Persistent pulmonary hypertension causes progression of right heart failure and sometimes reversion to fetal circulation patterns. The chronic hypoxia results in a mixed acidosis and often multiple organ failure. Nitric oxide (ratio of NO to oxygen, 1:9) can be administered through the oxygen line in hopes of decreasing the pulmonary hypertension (Fig. 4.106) .",

The major risk to farmers occurs when workers enter a silo chute or silo without first starting the blower in the silo loader to \"wash out\" NO 2 . Cattle confined next to the silo chute are most at risk and may receive chronic low-exposure toxicity or severe acute toxicity. Gaseous NO 2 seeks water that then converts it to nitric acid, which is highly tissue damaging. In the respiratory tract, nitric acid causes acute chemical injury similar to anhydrous ammonia and subsequent obliterative bronchiolitis and interstitial fibrosis.

In humans, many specific inhalant antigens may cause similar symptoms, but frequently Micropolyspora faeni and related organisms are incriminated. Wet hay that ferments excessively remains the biggest cause of this condition in farmers and cattle. The resultant dusty, moldy hay releases tremendous numbers of spores when bales are opened into the faces of humans and animals. Large round bales also have been observed to cause the problem occasionally. A delayed hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. Signs of acute experimental exposure include a sudden decrease in appetite and milk production, coughing, cranioventral pulmonary rales bilaterally, and transient fever. In natural cases, chronic cough without obvious illness remains the most common sign when this disease has been recognized in the northern United States. Usually more than 50% of the herd is affected, and herd production decreases 10% to 25% because affected cattle cough enough to interfere with normal consumption of feed. Auscultation of the lungs may reveal a few wheezes or may be normal. Signs lessen but do not stop entirely when animals are fed outdoors or go to pasture. Confinement and feeding the causative hay indoors accentuate the signs. Death is rare, but occasionally severe chronic cases have developed right heart failure. With the feeding of total mixed rations and the reduction in lifespan of dairy cattle in the United States, this disease has become less common. However, sporadic cases continue to be seen, not so much as a herd issue but as an individual, older multiparous cow problem on traditional stanchion and tie stall farms. We occasionally see a similar clinical syndrome in a hospitalized cow that is bedded heavily and has frequent bedding changes.",

If economics permit, getting rid of the hay is the best policy and may solve the problem.

Certain biologics have been incriminated more than others in this regard. Antibiotic-induced anaphylaxis has been observed as a result of penicillin, tetracycline, sulfas, and other antibiotics. Penicillin may cause respiratory distress from a true anaphylaxis (usually hives accompany the respiratory distress) or as part of the procaine reaction. A procaine reaction causes hyperexcitement and snorting, but edema is not present because this is not an immunologic reaction. A procaine reaction is rare in cattle in comparison to horses and when it does occur is generally less severe than in horses. Biologics that cause an anaphylactic reaction in more than an occasional cow should be avoided unless suitable alternatives are not available. Many apparent anaphylactic crises may in fact be the result of endotoxins in certain biologics and cattle of certain genetic lines being more susceptible to such vaccine reactions.",
