The Joint Commission (JC), formerly known as the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO), is a regulatory entity independent of the FDA. In 2007, the JC released the latest version of Tissue Storage and Issuance Standards. 9 These standards apply to implantable and transplantable products that are human or cellular based. The JC requires hospitals, critical access hospitals, ambulatory office-based surgery, and outpatient centers to develop procedures to address the critical areas of tissue recovery and storage, record-keeping and tracking, and adverse events/infection follow-up. These written procedures are required to describe protocols for tissue ordering, receipt, temperature-monitored storage, tissue handling, preparation for use, tracking the graft from receipt to implantation, and investigation/reporting of adverse events or possible infections. According to these guidelines, hospitals and surgery centers should be able to trace any tissue bidirectionally to report potential disease transmission to the recipient when notified by the tissue bank as well as report to the donor facility any adverse reactions. This improves record-keeping and adverse event monitoring. They have power of accreditation over hospitals and tissue banks, which, without these entities, would have difficulty billing state and private insurance companies, providing further new quality controls for current allograft tissue.",

To prevent transmission, Good Tissue Practices use several steps to reduce infections from allografts. The first is to prevent infected tissue from entering the donation pool. This is done by screening and donor selection. This process is further refined by cultures taken from the tissues themselves or their liquid environment. The next step is to prevent contamination. This is completed by performing the procurement in a timely fashion under aseptic conditions. The third step is to reduce or eliminate infecting agents. Newer processing techniques promise improved allograft safety without graft compromise. This is achieved during tissue processing as well as final sterilization.",

            "text": "One of the primary ways to prevent disease transmission by allograft transplantation is appropriate donor selection. 10, 17 The most important step is a careful history and identification of risk factors for infectious diseases. This should also include a careful review of the medical history from different sources, including surviving family members, hospitals, clinics, and private doctor's offices. Other records such as blood donation history or autopsy records can also be obtained. The next step in donor screening is testing for an active infection. There are limitations of tests that rely on the presence of antibodies or antigens, such that there is a window period where the donor is actively infected but exhibits no detectable immunologic response. NAT reduces the window period from 22 days (HIV) and 70 days (HCV) to 7 days. 13 With current screening and testing protocols, the estimated risk of implanting tissue from an HIV-infected donor is 1 in 173,000 to 1 in 1 million. The estimated risk of implanting tissue from an HCV-infected donor is 1 in 421,000. 18 The risk of contracting hepatitis is much higher than the risk of HIV. The estimated prevalence of 1.2 million with hepatitis B and 3.2 million with HCV 19 is responsible for the increased risk. The incidence of HCV in the general population is 1.8%, and many of these patients do not know that they are carriers. Furthermore, 50% of carriers have no history of hepatitis or even know that they are seropositive. 20 The actual numbers of potential tissue donors that are infected with these viruses are unknown, and these numbers do not take into account the processing steps to reduce the risk of disease transmission.",

Time to harvest is also critical to reduce the risk of infection; according to AATB guidelines, tissue procurement must take place within 24 hours of asystole if the body is cooled or 15 hours if the body is not cooled. 12 Contamination has been documented from the breakdown of the donor's gastrointestinal or respiratory systems, and recovering tissue after this period has resulted in contamination and implanted infections. 11, 22 As each tissue is procured, it is cultured, wrapped, labeled, and sealed in dedicated containers at wet ice temperatures.

Low-dose (<2 Mrad) gamma radiation is documented to be effective at sterilization, but studies have also shown that it generates free radicals that can adversely affect the structure of collagen and ultimately the mechanical properties of the graft. Higher radiation levels (>2 Mrad) have demonstrated biomechanical weakening of the collagen tissues. 24 Historically, ethylene oxide (ETO) gas was used for terminal sterilization, but its use was discontinued because of documented patient tissue reactions with ETO-treated grafts. 22 At this time, there is no one ideal sterilization technique for soft tissue allografts. The FDA does not specify which process or technique should be used. The FDA only",

            "text": "Allograft implantation in orthopedic procedures has increased steadily over the last decade. Patient infections and widespread media coverage have raised concern regarding the safety and efficacy of the allografts. Tissue banks, government agencies, and non-profit organizations have undergone multilevel changes to reduce the risk of disease transmission. Safely procuring and processing the grafts and thorough screening of donors have improved the quality of the allograft pool and decreased the risk of disease transmission. The regulatory agencies hope to ensure graft safety through improved regulation and standardized treatment methods. Finally, improved communication with a unique identification for each graft and donor leads to more efficient future monitoring and detection of infections and perhaps prevention of implantation of suspected tissues. All these steps make the clinical use of musculoskeletal allografts the safest it has ever been for the patient. As newer methods of sterilization are developed, further biologic and biomechanical tests need to be performed. As tissue banks state claims of sterility and biomechanical properties, these statements should be independently evaluated. Oversight by governing bodies should provide monitoring and long-term follow-up of these new processes. As recommended by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, surgeons need to be familiar with the tissue bank they work with and how their grafts are processed. Tissue banks and the processing of graft tissues still face challenges. Emerging diseases and pathogens reveal the need for more sensitive testing. Ultimately, the patients will continue to have improved tissue safety now and in the future.",
