In order to achieve these goals, different technical approaches have been adopted worldwide. In the USA, three high level isolation units (HLIUs) are available. In general, these units are clinical facilities specifically designed to minimise the risk of nosocomial spread of HIDs, adopting engineering and safety measures usually used in biosafety level (BSL) 3 and 4 containment laboratories, that include negative air pressure ventilation for entire units, restricted access, special treatment of waste and other infrastructure and administrative controls not typically found in routine clinical settings. In the USA these units are usually constructed in connection with BSL 3e4 laboratories, in order to deal also with potential laboratory-acquired infections due to accidental exposure. 4, 5 During the SARS epidemic, some countries that experienced local transmission managed the need for isolation by the creation of temporary isolation wards. 6 In Europe, different approaches exist. In some countries, HLIUs are available, or are in construction. In the UK, 'Trexler Units', a particular type of negativepressure plastic isolator containing one or two beds, are in use. 7 In other countries, healthcare facilities specifically developed for the management of HIDs do not exist, and these patients are managed in negative-pressure isolation rooms.",

For others (such as SARS, influenza), less costly approaches that consider strict application of appropriate transmission-based isolation measures in conventional hospital rooms might be considered. However, the use of HIRs is also recommended by international guidelines and European legislation in these cases. Indeed, airborne transmission of SARS and influenza virus has been suggested in many instances, especially during aerosol-producing procedures in healthcare settings. 14e16 In a recent guideline from the World Health Organization, SARS and human infections caused by a new influenza virus are considered acute respiratory diseases that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern, and consequentially the use of an airborne precaution room is suggested. 8 Finally, according to European legislation, biological agents prone to cause public health emergencies should be managed in accordance with the precautionary principle, and engineering control measures should be implemented in order to avoid or minimise the release of biological agents into the workplace. 17 Rooms with specific technical features for the isolation of patients are already in use in Europe. Since 2000, nine imported cases of human-tohuman transmissible VHFs have been isolated and treated in western Europe. 18e20 During the SARS epidemic, 33 confirmed cases were imported into Europe, and mainly isolated in such rooms. 21 More recently, an Italian patient returning from Nepal with suspected VHF was isolated in a hospital provided with HIRs (unpublished data). No local transmission has occurred in Europe. Although, to date, no human cases of influenza A/H5N1 have been reported in European Union member countries, isolation rooms have also been used in the management of some potential cases in Belgium, Greece and The Netherlands. 22e24 This inventory has some limitations.

Despite these limitations, we consider this inventory as nearly complete. Indeed, EUNID representatives are mainly physicians who lead, or work in, the main referral centre for the management of patients affected by suspected or known HIDs, and they are updated about the availability and the functioning of their own and other HIRs in their own country. The number and the deployment of HIRs in each country reflects both geographical characteristics and differences in economic and political policies that exist in European Union member states. In some countries (Belgium, Finland, Greece, Ireland, Sweden) these rooms are widely disseminated across the whole country, and are usually represented by one or few rooms in general hospitals, usually attached to infectious diseases wards. In some others (Estonia, Germany, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Portugal), the HIRs are located in one or few referral hospitals, each covering a part of the country. In Germany, HIRs are placed in specifically equipped, highly specialised facilities, located in a separate ward or building. By contrast, both approaches are used in Denmark, Italy and the UK. Indeed, few referral hospitals or units contain specifically equipped facilities, but other HIRs are also available in many hospitals. In particular, the large number of hospitals provided with HIRs in Italy is due to a national law that mandates the provision of at least one HIR in all infectious diseases wards, in order to comply with an increased number of HIV-positive patients with tuberculosis. 25 The availability of HIR hospital beds per million population is greatest in Luxembourg, which is a very small country, Scandinavian countries (Finland, Sweden, Denmark) and Ireland; among the most populous countries, Italy has the greatest number of hospital beds per million inhabitants, while the UK, Germany and Spain have very few.",

The sporadic introduction of few cases of HIDs in Europe can be managed easily in the currently available HIRs. Currently available HIRs could have a role also in the initial phases of an influenza pandemic, in order to isolate the first cases and to delay as much as possible the establishment of effective human-to-human transmission in the country. Transnational collaboration among countries should be implemented whenever possible, because well-established relationships would be essential if the cases exceed the HIR capacity in a country or where transport across a state border was easier than across difficult terrain (such as mountainous areas), although the transport of these patients may represent a challenge. Indeed, arrangements for transport of HID patients to HLIUs in Europe vary, as do the legal regulations applicable in each country, as also evidenced by the compendium of national guidelines on HID developed by EUNID (available on website). Most countries require ambulance crews to be specially trained but not all require the use of special vehicles. In some countries, special ambulances with controlled and filtered ventilation are used; others use standard ambulances with the crew wearing various levels of personal protective equipment; and others use patient isolators to protect the crew and environment. Sweden, Germany, Italy and the UK have arrangements for, and experience of, national and/or international aeromedical transport for their citizens, both using ambulances transported on an airplane, or special air transport isolator.",

Furthermore, if small isolators are used to transport patients, it is very unpleasant for the patient and very difficult to provide appropriate care for a sick patient in such a small space. Moreover, the time of transport should be carefully planned, taking into consideration geographical features of the route and meteorological conditions. A balance is necessary between transport distance and feasibility, and the availability of HIRs.",

In the other 12 countries from which we have data, intensive care capabilities are not present in three countries and in the remaining eight countries 65 hospital beds in HIRs have intensive care facilities. The ability to provide intensive care is important not only for preparedness for major events, but also in the management of sporadic cases of HIDs. Indeed, the diseases defined as highly infectious are life-threatening infections that often require intensive care support. 19,26e28 In our opinion, this deficiency represents a risk to the hospital population and to the community, as patients may be moved to an ICU where isolation measures cannot be applied easily. The creation and maintainance of transnational agreements are other possible options, but the transport of highly infectious patients requiring intensive care from one country to another is usually not feasible.",
