S is a type I glycoprotein with a largely predominant ectodomain. It is co-translationally glycosylated and many potential acceptor sites for N-linked glycosylation (21-35) are found in its sequence. During virus maturation, S carbohydrates undergo Golgi modifications (Niemann et al., 1982; Sturman and Holmes, 1985) . S may be cleaved into two subunits of nearly equivalent size, depending on the virus and on the cell system. The amino-subunit Sl and the carboxy-subunit S2 correspond approximatively to the globular domain and to the stalk of the spike, respectively. The spike is formed of an oligomer of S which was recently proposed to be a trimer ). An interchain, elongated coiled-coil structure predicted in the carboxy-domain, as described for influenza virus, may contribute to the stabilization of the S oligomer.",

The M protein of TGEV has also been reported to be an interferogenic glycoprotein, able to induce interferon alpha synthesis by leucocytes (Charley and Laude, 1988) . Unlike S, M protein is buried mainly in the viral particle with less than 30 N-terminal residues exposed at the outer surface of the virus membrane. The next 80 residues form three hyd.rophobic a-helices, which span the membrane three times. The rest of the molecule is located in the interior of the virus particle. The ectodomain carries few glycosylation sites (l-6) with different types of linkages of the glycans (see Sturman and Holmes, 1985 for a review): O-linked for murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and bovine coronavirus (BCV), N-linked for infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and TGEV. With the exception of TGEV, translocation of M within the reticular endoplasmic membrane occurs in the absence of a cleavable signal sequence.",

As a consequence, the addition of complex type chains within the Golgi compartment may take place either on free or virion-associated glycoproteins. The effect of glycosylation inhibitors on virion formation was investigated in earlier studies on MHV and IBV. Viral particles lacking the S protein could be observed, thus indicating that glycosylation of M protein is not required and that S protein is dispensible for virion formation (Rottier et al., 1981; Holmes et al., 1981; Stern and Sefton, 1982; Niemann et al., 1982) .",

            "text": "The main objective of the present study was to analyse the contribution of glycosylation to the antigenic make-up of these two proteins. The carbohydrate moiety of viral or non-viral glycoproteins generally has a strong influence on their antigenic reactivity, transport and their functional activities (Niman and Elder, 1982; Alexander and Elder, 1984; Skehel et al., 1984; Machamer et al., 1985 ; see Klenk, 1990 for a review). During the last few years, information about the monoclonal antibody binding sites of the S and M proteins of coronaviruses TGEV, MHV and IBV has been obtained and this has led to the localization of epitopes or groups of epitopes (called sites) on the primary structure (Tooze and Stanley, 1986; Cavanagh et al., 1988; Lenstra et al., 1989; Luytjes et al., 1989; Correa et al., 1990; Posthumus et al., 1990; Routledge et al., 1991) . However, the contribution of carbohydrates to the expression of epitopes has yet to be examined. In this report, the carbohydrate composition and the immunoreactivity of the S and M proteins at different stages of maturation of TGEV were studied. The results demonstrated that the expression of antigenic sites on S and M TGEV proteins has strong site-specific requirements with respect to glycosylation. The co-translational addition of carbohydrates was found to be crucial for both the acquisition and the maintenance of most antigenic sites on TGEV glycoproteins.",

Both treatments had only a slight effect on the overall cell protein synthesis, as judged by the level of incorporation of [ 35S]methionine. The virus-specific polypeptides present in the resulting cell extracts were analyzed by immunoprecipitation using a polyclonal reagent and SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1) . The patterns from control samples were similar to those previously described and showed the presence of two high M, species 220K and 175K, representing the mature S protein and its intracellular precursor S', respectively, and of M protein with a 29K band as a major species . The above polypeptides were poorly or no longer detected in extracts from cells treated by tunicamycin at > 0.5 lg/ml (Fig. la) . Instead, two polypeptides with M, 155K and 26K became apparent. Their M, was close to that predicted for the apoproteins S and M, respectively Rasschaert and Laude, 1987) . It is remarkable that the 155K species was poorly immunoprecipitated when compared to the other viral polypeptides present in tunicamycin treated cells. The lack of cleaved or additional non-dissociated material indicated that the intrinsic immunoreactivity of the 155K species was markedly decreased. Treatment with 1 PM monensin blocked the synthesis of the mature S protein and yielded the synthesis of a 175K species of which the mobility and immunoreactivity was equivalent to that of S' species (Fig. lb) . The synthesis of the minor M species 30-36K in the presence of monensin was markedly affected, whereas that of the major component 29K was not. The polypeptide composition of the virus particles produced in the presence of one of these two drugs was examined. Virions produced in tunicamycin-treated cells sedimented in sucrose gradients as a broader band compared to control virions and facked ail forms of the S species, whereas M protein was present in the 26K form only. Virions purified from monensin-treated cultures exhibited a polypeptide pattern similar to that of control virions, indicating that the inhibition was incomplete; however, a 175K species appeared to be incorporated to some extent into the virions (data not shown).",

Fig. 2a shows the effect of these enzymes on purified virion polypeptides. Incubation with endo H and endo F caused little or no shift of the mobility of 220K mature S protein, whereas incubation with glyco F generated a product with IV, 160-190K, thus indicating that a notable proportion of the sugar chains was removed. The 29K M component was found to be sensitive to the three Nglycanases, leading to the appearance of a 26K species. The latter was assumed to correspond to the unglycosylated polypeptide since it comigrated with the backbone product synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin (not shown). The M species 30-36K were sensitive to glyco F only and were converted into 26K species.",

To investigate in more detail the influence of the glycosylation on the antigenicity of the S protein, we analyzed the immunoreactivity of the 155K S species produced in tunicamycin-treated cells towards a panel of 23 mAbs. Among the mAbs directed against both S and S' species, 13 defined one of the major antigenic sites A, B, C and D, all located in the amino-half of the polypeptide chain, and 4 defined topologically unrelated epitopes; six mAbs recognized epitopes specific to the precursor species S' (Table 1 ). It was found that all the mAbs exhibited a low or very low residual reactivity towards the 155K species produced in the presence of tunicamycin, with the notable exception of the 3 site C-specific mAbs, which showed a substantial glycosylation independence. Partial data obtained with 4 mAbs representative of the major sites are presented in Fig. 3 . In order to preserve possibly fragile antigen-antibody complexes, the carrier beads were washed only two times in these experiments, which explains the presence of non-specific bands. Only site C-specific mAb 3b.5 efficiently immunoprecipitated the 155K species. The effect of endo H treatment on the immunoreactivity of the intracellular S' species towards anti-S/S' mAbs was also examined (Fig. 4) . As already shown, of the two species S and S', only the latter was susceptible to endo H. The deglycosylated S' species (155K) reacted with the site C mAb 3b.5 as efficiently as with the polyclonal reagent, whereas no or little reactivity towards site A, B and D mAbs could be evidenced.",

The major M species 29K would therefore be a high mannose form, as it was sensitive to treatment with endo H, whereas the 30-36K species would bear complex type carbohydrates since they were shown to be sensitive to glyco F only (Fig. 2a) . The process of glycosylation for TGEV and IBV M proteins thus appears to be similar in that both endo H sensitive and endo H resistant M species have been found in IBV virions (Stern and Sefton, 1982) . Finally, it is worth mentioning that M protein found in TGEV virions was predominantly of high mannose type, whereas only S species bearing essentially complex type carbohydrates (22OKI were found in TGEV virions.

            "text": "The carbohydrate requirement for the expression of S individual epitopes was investigated using a panel of 23 neutralizing and non-neutralizing mAbs which has been shown to delineate four major antigenic sites (A, B, C and D>, all located in the N terminal half of the S molecule and a few unrelated epitopes Delmas et al., 1986; ; see Table 1 ). The following results led us to conclude that most of these antigenic sites are highly dependent upon glycosylation for both their expression and maintenance. First, the unglycosylated intracellular species produced in the presence of tunicamycin exhibited little or no reactivity towards mAbs defining the sites A, B and D (Fig. 3) . Second, the same mAbs recognized poorly the deglycosylated form of S' obtained by endo H treatment of infected cell extracts (Fig. 4) . No definite conclusions can presently be drawn about the way in which the carbohydrate's side chains modulate the antigenicity. However, the observed residual reactivity of non-glycosylated chains indicates that the carbohydrate moieties themselves are not directly involved as recognition structures in the epitopes, but rather are required for proper folding of the nascent glycopeptide chain. Third, by contrast to the other sites, site C was revealed to be largely independent of the core glycosylation for its expression (Figs. 3 and 4) . This finding agrees with our earlier observation that only the site C epitopes could be mapped through expression of large fragments of S gene in a bacterial expression system . Few bacterially expressible epitopes have been characterized so far on the Sl and S2 subunits of MHV and the S2 subunit of IBV (Lenstra et al., 1989; Luytjes et al., 1989; Routledge et al., 1991) . This may suggest that at least part of the major antigenic sites assumed to be located in the globular part Sl of the protein (see Laude, 1990) are carbohydrate-dependent, as found in the S protein of TGEV.",

According to the proposed model, the biosynthesis of mature S protein comprises three main events. First, 175K species bearing high mannose side chains are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These monomers express the major antigenic sites A, B, C and D localized in the globular part of S molecule. Among these, only site C is largely independent of core-glycosylation for its expression. The next step, which was shown to be rate-limiting and to occur in the ER, consists in the assembly of 175K species into 3 X 175K oligomers. These structures express new epitopes, in particular S' specific epitopes. Finally, newly assembled trimers are transported in the Golgi compartment, where terminal-glycosylation occurs. S' specific epitopes are lost as a consequence of Golgi-modifications.",
