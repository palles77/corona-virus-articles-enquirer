Methods: Prospective observational study of consecutive hospitalized patients with influenza A H1N1 virus and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). We compared cases with and without bacterial co-infection. Results: The incidence of influenza A H1N1 infection in CAP during the pandemic period was 19% (n, 667). We studied 128 patients; 42(33%) had bacterial co-infection. The most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae (26, 62%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6, 14%). Predictors for bacterial co-infection were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and increase of platelets count. The hospital mortality was 9%. Factors associated with mortality were age !65 years, presence of septic shock and the need for mechanical ventilation. Although patients with bacterial co-infection presented with higher Pneumonia Journal of Infection (2012) 65, 223e230 Severity Index risk class, hospital mortality was similar to patients without bacterial coinfection (7% vs. 11%, respectively, p Z 0.54). Conclusion: Bacterial co-infection was frequent in influenza A H1N1 pneumonia, with COPD and increased platelet count as the main predictors. Although associated with higher severe scales at admission, bacterial co-infection did not influence mortality of these patients.",

In August 10, 2010 the WHO announced that the H1N1 pandemic had moved into the post-pandemic period, and reported a total of 18,500 confirmed deaths worldwide. 4 Seasonal and pandemic influenza are frequently complicated by bacterial infections. 5 Bacterial co-infection has been found in around 30% of all cases with seasonal influenza, and the pathogens most often reported include Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. 6 Bacterial co-infection is an important contributor to morbidity and mortality. Bacterial pneumonia complicating influenza infection was a major cause of death during the 1918 influenza pandemic, 7, 8 and during periods of seasonal influenza activity in inter-pandemic periods. 9 Bacterial co-infection was frequently reported in fatal cases during the 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic, 10, 11 with S. pneumoniae as the most frequent pathogen identified. Reports on specific populations such as critically-ill patients found bacterial co-infection ranging from 18% to 33% patients with 2009 influenza A H1N1 virus pneumonia. 12e14 However, the incidence and the role of bacterial coinfection in the outcome of patients with influenza A H1N1 virus-associated pneumonia are not well described in the general population.",

Thus, the true bacterial co-infection rate might be even higher. Indeed, a study using molecular techniques such as MassTag PCR testing for 33 microbial agents in nasopharyngeal swabs found 76% rate of bacterial pathogens in a sample of patients with influenza A H1N1. 25 S. pneumoniae was the most frequent bacterial pathogen in our series. This is in accordance with recent studies evaluating seasonal 22 and novel influenza A H1N1associated pneumonia. 11, 13, 21 Unexpectedly, P. aeruginosa was the second most frequent bacterial pathogen, whereas S. aureus was rarely found, and we did not identify H. influenzae. The presence of P. aeruginosa may be related to the high proportion patients with severe CAP 26, 27 and COPD 17 in the bacterial co-infection group. The absence of H. influenzae in our patients is also unusual. This pathogen was the Abbreviations: OR, odds ratio; CI, confidence interval; NA, not available; \"\u00fe1 mg/dL\" indicates the increase by one mg/dL; \"\u00fe10 units\" indicates the increase by ten units. most frequent bacterial pathogen identified in patients with Influenza A H1H1 in Argentina. 25 However, the molecular techniques such as PCR used in this study are well known to improve diagnosis of the etiology of CAP. 28 Despite a recent report on three cases of H1N1-associated pneumonia and c-MRSA, 29 we did not find any case of MRSA in our series. As regards to S. aureus, this was the most frequent bacterial pathogen identified in a much selected population of severely immunosuppressed patients with solid organ transplant, 30 which is substantially different that that from the present study. This is the first study to assess the predictors of bacterial co-infection in influenza A H1N1 pneumonia in multivariate analysis. Underlying COPD and increasing platelet counts were independently predictive of the presence of bacterial co-infection in our series. Previous tracheobronchial colonization is frequent in COPD patients. 31 Bacterial pathogens such as S. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa are frequently reported in COPD exacerbations of bacterial etiology, 32e34 and this may explain the presence of these bacteria as the most frequent bacterial isolates in our patients. Thrombocytosis, as well as thrombocytopenia, was recently described as independent predictor of death from CAP. 35 Platelets are inflammatory cells with an important role in antimicrobial host defenses and hence appear to be a marker of bacterial infection in patients with CAP. In our study higher levels of C-reactive protein at admission were nearly significantly higher in patients with bacterial coinfection. Although we did not measure Procalcitonin, a recent study showed that Procalcitonin and C-reactive protein may potentially assist in the discrimination between severe lower respiratory tract infections of bacterial and 2009 influenza A H1N1 origin. 36 Due to the increasing evidence on the usefulness of biomarkers in the diagnosis and management of CAP. 37 the role of biomarkers to discriminate between patients with influenza A H1N1 with and without bacterial coinfection needs further prospective investigation.",

However, current severity scores such as PSI have limited value in influenza A H1N1 pneumonia, since they underestimate mortality rates likely due to the your average age of these patients, as recently reported. 40 Two important strengths of our study were that patients were included consecutively avoiding in that way potential bias and that we used a systematic microbiological diagnostic protocol in two centers.",
