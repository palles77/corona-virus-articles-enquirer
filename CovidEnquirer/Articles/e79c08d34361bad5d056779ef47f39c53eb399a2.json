HSV cytologic abnormalities were not detected in any of the 380 cases examined: included were specimens from therapeutic and spontaneous abortions (200 cases) and endometrial curettage (180 cases). The presence of inflammation was not correlated with HSV posi\u00b0 tivity. Endometrial HSV positivity was significantly correlated with normal late secretory phase (40 per cent of specimens positive), abnormal secretory phase (67 per cent positive), and therapeutic (33 per cent positive) versus spontaneous (26 per cent positive) abortions. Placental HSV positivity was significantly correlated with spontaneous (39 per cent positive) versus therapeutic (14 per cent positive) abortions and with blighted ova (67 per cent positive). No significant correlation was found between HSV positivity and a clinical history of oral or genital HSV infection in either the patient or the male partner. The data support the concept of a subclinical latent intrauterine endometrial HSV infection that is hormonally regulated and can produce transplacental infection of the embryo or fetus, with variable consequences.",

A full-term infant was delivered alive with acute HSV infection of the skin and died a few days later of systemic infection. The presence of acute HSV infection in the skin and brain was confirmed by morphologic HSVspecific cytologic studies, culture, and transmission electron microscopy. No evidence of HSV infection was found in routine studies of the placenta and umbilical cord by the same techniques. Transplacental infection, however, must have occurred, because the infection was not acquired from the birth canal during delivery.

Anti-HSV 1' and HSV 2 antibodies strongly cross-react in tissues acutely infected with HSV 1 and HSV 2 (see table 1 for end-point titers). The antibodies were absolutely negative in other tissues with culture-proven and/or immunohistochemically proven infections with the other three herpetoviruses (herpes zoster virus, CMV, and Epstein-Barr virus) and other miscellaneous viruses (hepatitis A and B, papillomavirus, and echovirus). A placenta with culture-proven listeria infection was also negative. The virus used as antigen for antibody production was purified from culture medium containing fetal bovine serum. For that reason, the antibodies were tested against tissues containing both human and bovine alpha-fetoprotein and were found to be negative (table 1) .

The accompanying paper describes the neonatal problems produced by infections of this type. 4 Future studies should include the following investigations: determination of maternal anti-HSV antibody status; extraction of DNA from, and in situ DNA/RNA hybridization of, aborted and curettage tissues to determine whether HSV-specific nucleic acid sequences are present; and direct culture of first-day menstrual flow material for infectious HSV.",

Blighted ova were associated with spontaneous abortions (material from 78 per cent of spontaneous abortions versus 27 per cent of therapeutic abortions was HSV-positive, P = 0.001), acute and chronic choriodeciduitis (more commonly with chronic inflammation--73 per cent of patients with inflammation versus 28 per cent of normal subjects were HSV-positive, P = 0.001), placental subamnionic chorion positivity (chorion positive in 67 per cent and negative in 44 per cent, P = 0.008), and, possibly, with chorionic villus positivity (villi positive in 70 per cent and negative in 49 per cent, P = 0.207, trend) and total HSV positivity (56 per cent positive versus 46 per cent negative, P ---0.201), but were not associated with endometrial epithelial positivity (51 per cent positive versus 51 per cent negative, P = 0.820). Multiparity was significantly associated with chronic choriodeciduitis (79 per cent with choriodeciduitis versus 58 per cent without choriodeciduitis were HSV-positive, P = 0.034) and was possibly associated with total HSV positivity (P = 0.143), endometrial epithelial positivity (P = 0.179), placental subamnionic chorion positivity (P = 0.084), and inflammation (P = 0.189). Tile presence of genital HSV positivity in the partner was associated only with genital HSV positivity in the patient (50 per cent of the patients with histories of HSV positivity had partners with histories of HSV positivity, whereas 6.7 per cent of patients without histories of HSV infection had partners with histories of HSV positivity, P = 0.001). Tile presence of oral or genital HSV infection in the patient and/or the partner was not associated with any of the HSVpositive staining patterns (P = 0.522 and P = 0.918, respectively).

Recurrent spontaneous abortion was not associated with total HSV positivity (P = 0.262) or placental subamnionic chorion positivity (P = 0.521). Endometrial epithelial positivity, placental subamnionic chorion positivity, chorionic villus positivity, and total HSV positivity were all associated with progressively older gestational ages (8.1 [P = 0.006], 9.8 [P = 0.006], 11.0 [P = 0.028], and 11.4 [P = 0.001] weeks). Therapeutic abortions, as compared with spontaneous abortions, occurred in younger women (27.2 versus 29.7 years, P = 0.05).
