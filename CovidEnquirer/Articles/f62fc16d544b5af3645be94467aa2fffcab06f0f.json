The strategy of TB control should be modified according to local epidemiology, specific socioeconomic and cultural circumstances, and the type of healthcare program. Although a previous study in Taiwan found that case notification of TB was quite complete, and reported patients were followed up by public health nurses, compliance with anti-TB treatment remains unsatisfactory. 5 Public health nurses who serve as government employees at local health units are assigned the responsibility of following up compliance to anti-TB treatment. However, due to poor communication with physicians, they are usually unaware of patients' actual clinical condition and, hence, not fully trusted by patients. Health education for patients about the disease was also insufficient. We tried to address these problems by employing a hospital-based case management (HBCM) approach for the control of TB. Treatment outcomes were compared between patients with and without case management and with nationwide surveillance data. Part of the results of this study has been previously presented in the form of an abstract. 6 ",

            "text": "T This study showed that patients with TB treated w with a HBCM approach had a significantly higher rate of successful treatment outcome compared to those without HBCM. Patients who died comprised the majority of patients with unsuccessful treatment outcomes, although the causes of death in these patients were not necessarily due to TB and were often difficult to discern due to the presence of comorbidities. Further analysis of treatment outcomes after excluding those patients who died still showed a significantly better treatment outcome t in HBCM patients. Deaths during the treatment period were due to delay in diagnosis and/or comorbidities rather than due to the treatment. In the evaluation of treatment outcomes, exclusion of patients who died might more accurately reflect the efficacy of a control strategy. This study found an improved treatment success rate compared with both the previous data with non-HBCM reported from the same hospital in 1982-1983 as well as nationwide surveillance data in 2003. 9, 10 This study included consecutively reported TB cases in a single referral center. This cohort had comparable demographic characteristics to the nationwide surveillance data including gender ratio, mean age, rate of open pulmonary TB (smearpositive plus smear-negative, culture-positive) and rate of extrapulmonary TB. 9 In 1997, the Bureau of National Health Insurance in Taiwan introduced the following two policies related to TB notification: (1) the no-notification-no-reimbursement policy, and (2) the notification-fee policy, which substantially improved completeness of reporting. 5 In addition, according to the Communicable Disease Control Act in Taiwan, only the reporting of TB is required but reporting the change of diagnosis is not required. 7 Out of 524 cases reported in our hospital during the study period, 369 (70.4%) were eventually confirmed to have either pulmonary or extrapulmonary TB, a percentage comparable to the nationwide rate in 2003 (22,362 reported of which 15,042 confirmed, 67.3%). Since TB can mimic many other lung diseases and other lung diseases also mimic T TB, diagnosis presents a challenge. Under the HBCM approach in this study, once patients were reported to have TB, public health nurses who served the health unit located at patients' residence began to follow up the patients. However, it should be noted that under the current system, public health nurses face many difficulties in contacting the responsible physicians or obtaining the required clinical information in a timely manner. Intervention by the case manager is thus required to help reduce the burden placed on public health nurses. Studies that show the effect of such coordinated efforts on treatment outcomes are required.",

            "text": "In this study, about one-fourth of patients f changed their care providers and dropped out of case management after enrollment. The reasons for why patients were not managed at the same hospital are multifactorial. First, patients are able to choose care providers freely under the National Health Insurance program; second, patients changed care providers if they moved f or changed their work; third, the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred during the study period and led to the evacuar tion of all TB isolation wards in order to care for SARS patients. The case manager continued to follow up those patients who changed care providers and facilitated continuity of care at the institution to which these patients were transferred and by working with public health nurses. This intensive follow-up explains the overall successful treatment rate of 83.2%, which is an improvement when compared to the nationwide r rate of 78.3% in 2002 and 69.4% in 2003 for surveillance data. 9 DOTS, an international standard of TB control, contains five elements: (1) political commitment to support TB treatment; (2) the passive detection of active TB by sputum microscopy; (3) ensuring drug supply; (4) standardized recording and reporting system; (5) direct observation of treatment (ingestion of anti-TB medications directly supervised by a healthcare worker) during at least the first 2 months. 2 By combining the aspects of government regulation, universal health insurance coverage, and a case management approach for TB control, the strategy reported in this study is more comprehensive than DOTS, except for direct observation of therapy. To achieve direct observation, patients must either go to the t healthcare provider or the healthcare worker must t visit them. Implementation of required patient visits to observe treatment has been challenged by considerations of patients' willingness, and home visits by healthcare workers would require f enormous resources. Nevertheless, the impact of not implementing this aspect of DOTS may also t be great. By the time of completion of the first 2 months of treatment, most patients will have clinical improvement and are likely to interrupt their treatment if direct observation of treatment is discontinued. The possibility of nonadherence and interruption if direct observation of treatment is implemented only during the first 2 months w would thus be far greater. Although the HBCM approach does not directly observe treatment, it may be reasonable to assume compliance in most cases based on the patient's willingness to treat, their clinical response, roentgenographic improvement and bacteriologic conversion. The case manager should seek to earn the trust of patients as this may be more important than just watching them take the drugs.",

In contrast, the HBCM approach does not infringe on patients' right to privacy.",
