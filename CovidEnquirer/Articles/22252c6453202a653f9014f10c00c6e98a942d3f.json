MERS viruses broke out in one hospital in Pyeongtaek, South Korea (hereinafter Korea), on May 2015, 2015. Thirty-six patients died and 186 people were infected. 1 The Koreans experienced a national crisis, contributed to by the poor initial response of the affected hospitals, an inadequate response from the government, the economic depression that followed the outbreak, and the psychological impact of the outbreak on the Korean population. To date, the Korean government has not taken systematic actions to deal with global pandemics in the future.",

Considering that the MERS outbreak was not only a health issue but also an emergency management issue, the model for controlling similar epidemics or pandemics in the future-oriented model should involve all stakeholders in an early and co-ordinated response. Emergency management consists of four phases: emergency prevention/mitigation (legalization, inspection, disease prediction, etc.), emergency preparedness (emergency operation planning, training, etc.), emergency response (infection control, health treatment, etc.), and emergency recovery (insurance, medical evaluation, etc.). 3 Appropriate roles and responsibilities in all the phases have to be assigned to each of the four stakeholders in advance. Although many stakeholders tried to play their own roles during the MERS outbreak in Korea, their responses were somewhat late and unco-ordinated, and thus contributed to the national crisis. In fact, their specific roles and responsibilities should have been assigned before the MERS outbreak. In this context, nations should implement regular training in and exercise of emergency management measures.",
