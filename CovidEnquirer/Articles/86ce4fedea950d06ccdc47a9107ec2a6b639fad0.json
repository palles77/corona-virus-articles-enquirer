Clear examples of the potential threat of airborne transmission include the dramatic spread of measles in the pre-vaccination era and the high death rate caused by airborne anthrax [1, 2] . Airborne transmission is a significant hazard for other common respiratory infections too. Legionella is spread through aerosolization as well as aspiration of contaminated water [3] . Influenza is effectively spread by direct contact but there are clear examples where widespread indoor transmission of influenza occurs beyond the physical limits of personal contact [4] . Infections as diverse as smallpox and rhinovirus can spread rapidly by large and fine droplet (airborne) transmission and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus can spread through contact with contaminated water and, possibly, from person to person by droplet nuclei [5] [6] [7] .",

The passage of inhaled and exhaled air over the lung lining fluid entrains pathogens, resident in the lungs, in the form of droplets of airway lining fluid (ALF) that contain lung mucus and surfactant material [11] [12] [13] [14] . Pathogen-laden bioaerosol material can be inhaled deeper into the lungs of an infected individual, possibly promoting a more severe infection, or it can move out of the lungs and into the environment. Depending on aerosolized droplet size, airborne pathogens can quickly be deposited on nearby external surfaces; this external transport of pathogens can lead to disease transmission by physical contact. Expired bioaerosols can also travel great distances and remain airborne for an extended period of time, particularly when droplet diameters are too large for diffusive deposition (>200 nm) or too small for gravitational deposition (<2 \u00b5m) [15, 16] . In this scenario, airborne expired pathogens could be inhaled into the lungs of a second individual, promoting transmission by respiration.",

Recently, however, the idea of arresting expired and The current understanding of airborne pathogen spread in relation to the new methods of suppressing exhaled bioaerosols using safe surface-active materials, such as isotonic saline, is reviewed here. We discuss the physics of bioaerosol generation in the lungs, what is currently known about the relationship between expired bioaerosols and airborne infectious disease and current methods of airborne infectious disease containment. We conclude by reviewing recent experiments that suggest the delivery of isotonic saline can significantly diminish exhaled aerosol -generated from airway lining fluid in the course of natural breathing. We also discuss these implications in relation to airborne infectious disease control.",

            "text": "inspired bioaerosol mobility by influencing aerosol generation within the fluid lining of the lungs has been explored [17, 18] . The deposition of appropriate quantities of inhaled saline solutions in the lungs appears to alter the physical properties of lung lining fluid, possibly by modulating ionic interactions between charged mucins. This results in the creation of fewer and more-inert droplets, which consequently travel shorter distances through the air in the lungs and the immediate environment. Although the chemical and physical properties involved in bioaerosol generation within the lungs and the factors influencing airborne disease spread must be better Respiration of airborne pathogens. Airborne pathogens generated from the lungs of an infected individual have three potential outcomes: pathogen aspiration can occur by deep inhalation of the airborne agents, potentially leading to more-severe infection in the infected individual; large droplets that travel short distances from the infected individuals (<10 \u00b5m) might be expelled, landing on clothing and/or surfaces, thus providing a well of contact-related infectious agents (fomites); or droplet nuclei (0.1-5.0 \u00b5m) are emitted that carry pathogens and can stay airborne for extended periods of time, traveling great distances.These droplet nuclei can subsequently be inhaled by an uninfected recipient, resulting in secondary infection.The inset shows that bioaerosol droplets and droplet nuclei are generated by the passage of airflow over the airway lining fluid.This airflow results in shear of the liquid surface, creating surface disturbances that lead to droplet creation.

            "text": "Bioaerosol formation in the respiratory tract most commonly occurs, upon inspiration and expiration, as a consequence of momentum transfer from air flowing through the lungs to the ALF. This momentum transfer results in wave-like disturbances that can lead to droplet creation -similar to aerosol formation from the surface of a wind-stirred sea [19] . Theoretical predictions [11] and experiments with mucus-like film [20] suggest that a critical airspeed that initiates wave disturbances in the lungs is required and it will vary according to several parameters, such as film thickness and the surface and bulk physical properties of the mucus layer. During a forceful cough airspeeds as high as 200 m/s can be attained [21] . A potential mechanism for droplet creation during calm breathing relates to the reopening of closed small airways upon deep exhalations (Scheuch, G., personal communication). In general, droplet creation results from surface disturbances in a manner similar to Rayleigh capillary instability [22] , this has been carefully studied in the colloid-science literature [23] and, therefore, it is understood that droplet creation will be strongly influenced by the surface and bulk rheological properties of the lung surfactant fluid.",

Early researchers assumed the upper respiratory tract (nose, mouth and throat) was the primary location of droplet formation [24] [25] [26] . In these early studies, the mouths and throats of volunteers were coated with a dye and breathing, talking, sneezing and coughing maneuvers were monitored and any resulting droplets were collected directly onto a slide. Only droplets >1 \u00b5m were measured by microscopic observation. Duguid [24] found that droplets (>1 \u00b5m) produced by speaking, coughing and sneezing were sufficiently small enough to remain airborne. Normal breathing, however, produced no measurable droplets (>1 \u00b5m). In a second series of experiments [25] , Duguid determined that coughing produced an average droplet size of 14 \u00b5m. Although Loudon and Roberts [26] found that coughing produced a droplet concentration that was an order of magnitude smaller than that reported by Duguid, they found a similar average droplet size (12 \u00b5m). Another interesting common finding from these studies was the high variability in the levels of bioaerosol production from different individuals.",

By contrast, the authors found that delivering a combination of lung surfactants within ~1 g of isotonic saline amplifies the size of expired bioaerosols relative to the baseline (air inhalation only). In vitro results, obtained using a simulated cough machine, indicated that a mucus mimetic nebulized with saline produces a larger droplet size after the forced convection of air over its surface than when air is forced over the mucus mimetic alone (i.e. without saline nebulization).

These results are similar to human clinical trial findings that have been reported previously [17] . It is possible that the trend towards increasing expired bioaerosol particle size and lowering bioaerosol droplet number and mobility correlates with a mitigation of the spread of infectious disease. Wells et al. [40] found that adding solute to culture media before artificial aerosolization can alter the size of respired particles and change their infectiousness for test animals. 68 rabbits were subjected to breathing approximately equal numbers of tubercle bacilli in either fine or coarse (2-15 \u00b5m diameter range) aerosols. ~16 times fewer tubercles were detected in their lungs if they inhaled the larger particles [18] . Presumably, larger particles did not reach the vulnerable alveoli, affecting the mouth or the resistant mucosa of the large airways instead. Conceivably, if it is possible to alter the physical properties of the ALF in humans safely in such a way that small respiratory droplets would become harder to generate or, if generated, less likely to evaporate into droplet nuclei, airborne transmission might be reduced.

Increasing the surface tension of the ALF might be one mechanism for increasing the inertia of bioaerosol particles and lowering the mobility of respiratory aerosols. Similarly, bulk rheological properties, such as viscosity or viscoelasticity, tend to produce larger droplet sizes after breakup because they dynamically resist the breakup process with an intensity that increases with diminishing droplet size. Increasing viscosity and viscoelasticity can provide another mechanism for diminishing the mobility of bioaerosols by resisting their formation in the ALF. Surface rheological properties, such as surface viscosity and elasticity, are additional properties that can significantly alter droplet breakup dynamics. This is particularly true for very small droplets (of micron and submicron sizes) formed in the lungs. Surface rheological properties can dominate bulk rheological properties. This is caused by the relative force of surface to bulk rheological properties in relation to the inverse of the curvature radius of deformed surfaces. Standard values of surface rheological properties tend to produce surface rheological forces that are much larger than bulk rheological forces, reflected in large 'Boussinesq' and 'Marangoni' dimensionless numbers [41] . Thus, another method for diminishing the mobility of respiratory aerosols formed in the lungs is to increase surface viscosity and elasticity.",

They can be produced by sneezing, coughing, talking and normal breathing. It appears that a minor percentage of the population will be responsible for disseminating the majority of the exhaled bioaerosol burden. Intervention with a simple aerosol approach acts as a stabilizer on the surface of the ALF and can suppress the formation of bioaerosols of pulmonary origin. This approach could provide an appealing way to mitigate the spread of airborne infectious disease in environments ranging from hospitals and clinics to homes and confined environments (e.g. prisons) where the spread of airborne infectious disease is a recognized problem. Practically, intervention might involve the inhalation of a saline-based aerosol, 1-4 times per day, via an inhaler system that delivers the required dose of saline rapidly. The individuals taking the saline therapy and the rest of the general public should benefit because immobilizing bioaerosols in the lungs could lead to less airborne movement of the pathogen to the deep lung and/or out into the environment, allowing natural clearance mechanisms (e.g. mucociliary clearance) to remove the pathogen via the pharynx. However, it remains to be proved that the immobilization of pulmonary bioaerosols leads to a noticeably lower risk of airborne pathogen spread within individuals and/or to the uninfected public; experimental studies are required in animals and humans infected with influenza, tuberculosis and other airborne pathogens to clearly elucidate the potential for this new approach to controlling airborne infectious disease.",
