Methods: A total of 217 nasopharyngeal swabs were analyzed using CDC singleplex rRT-PCR and FTD\u00ae Respiratory Pathogens 33 multiplex assays, for the detection of 14 respiratory viruses. Results: The results showed that 179/217 (82.5%) samples were positive with the singleplex method and 183/217 (84.3%) with the FTD\u00ae Respiratory Pathogens 33 multiplex test. Excellent or satisfactory agreement was obtained for all viruses (k N 0.6) except Parainfluenzavirus 4 (k = 0.24) and influenza B (k = 0.51). Conclusion: Although the multiplex FTD kits were more expensive than the singleplex assay, the FTD kits yielded rapid results in a shorter timeframe, increasing efficiency of diagnosis.",

At this time, multiplex panels capable of simultaneously detecting more than three respiratory pathogens are widely available: The introduction of these new multiplex methods allows the analysis of a wider range of respiratory pathogens coupled with simplification of procedures, reducing time to detection, sample volume requirements and risk of contamination. A number of studies have compared the performance of FTD\u00ae Respiratory Pathogens kits with that of in house respiratory panels or commercial panels, such as Luminex NxTAG\u00ae Respiratory Pathogen Panel (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics, Austin, TX), TaqMan Array Card\u00ae (Thermo Fischer Scientific) and Anyplex\u00ae Respiratory Virus Panel Assays (Seegene) (Anderson et al., 2013; Barratt et al., 2017; Bierbaum et al., 2014; Driscoll et al., 2014; Malhotra et al., 2016; Sakthivel et al., 2012) . Overall, these reports showed that FTD\u00ae Respiratory Pathogens kits yield similar results as other multiplex pathogen detection kits. To date, there are no available data on the performance of these new multiplex tests when used in Africa. Africa is a continent with a diversity of socio-economic and cultural contexts, yet it bears the greatest burden of ARI both in terms of morbidity and mortality (Liu et al., 2015) . An evaluation of these molecular assays in the context of Cameroon can help guide priorities in assay selection for routine detection of these respiratory viruses. Multiplex tools enable the detection of multiple viruses within a single specimen. While co-detection data offers insight into the viruses present in the sample, it is less clear how these patterns or virus combinations correlate with clinical manifestations (US FOOD and DRUG ADMINISTRATION, 2007; Ortiz et al., 2009 ). Co-detection represents the multiple organisms present in a sample, whereas co-infection suggests that these organisms contribute in part to pathogenicity (Koon et al., 2010) . Comparing multiplex data from patients with varying clinical severity, offers an opportunity to examine potential differences in co-detection patterns.",

            "text": "About 80% of the 217 samples tested by both techniques showed the presence of at least one respiratory virus. This detection rate is relatively higher than the rates obtained in previous studies in Cameroon and other Central African countries. This could be explained by the higher number of respiratory viruses tested for in this study; 21 compared to only 8 for the Nakoun\u00e9 et al. study, which reported a prevalence of only 14.9% in ambulatory and hospitalized children recruited in Central African Republic in 2010 (Nakoun\u00e9 et al., 2013) . Still in this study, detection of some respiratory viruses may have been missed. Detection of pathogens from the lower respiratory tract was not possible, since only nasopharyngeal specimens were analyzed, and depending on the sampling conducted each month certain pathogens may have been under or over represented. Overall, however, all viral targets showed comparable detection rates by both techniques, with the exception of influenza B and HCoV-OC43 which were significantly different. Even though the kappa value was low for HPIV-4 (k = 0.24), its low prevalence may have limited the ability to detect a significant difference between the two diagnostic tests. The detection frequencies ranged from 35.9% for HAdV to 0.5% for both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 species. These detection rates of the different viral targets are consistent with those of previous studies in Cameroon and in other African countries (Hoffmann et al., 2012; Kenmoe et al., 2016; Lagare et al., 2015; Lekana-Douki et al., 2014; Nakoun\u00e9 et al., 2013; Njouom et al., 2012) . However, it is noteworthy according to previous study in Africa (Dia et al., 2014; Kenmoe et al., 2016) , to mention that this study confirms the predominant frequency of HAdV in acute respiratory infections this region. Twelve (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HLU1, influenza A, HRSV, HPIV-2, RV, HMPV, HAdV, HPIV-1, HPIV-3, and HCoV-OC43) of the 14 viral targets tested revealed an excellent or satisfactory agreement (kappa value N0.6-1) between the FTD\u00ae Respiratory Pathogens 33 and singleplex CDC assays. Similarly, other previous studies comparing FTD kits and other commercial or personalized tests, singleplex or multiplex, have shown similar results (Anderson et al., 2013; Barratt et al., 2017; Bierbaum et al., 2014; Driscoll et al., 2014; Malhotra et al., 2016; Sakthivel et al., 2012) . A comparison of the sensitivities between CDC singleplex assays and FTD assays for respiratory viruses by testing 308 prospective specimens was previously conducted showing similar sensitivities for most assays with exceptions of the FTD assays for HAdV, RSV, and RV having lower sensitivity (Ortiz et al., 2009) . It must be noted that in the study conducted by Sakthivel et al a different FTD assay kit was used; however the FTD\u00ae 21 kit referenced has overlapping assays with the FTD\u00ae 33 kit discussed in this study. The good concordance observed for HAdV, HCoV-OC43, EV/HPeV and HPIV-2 in this current study was different from that found by Sakthivel et al., and Bierbaum et al. in their studies comparing the same techniques (Bierbaum et al., 2014; Sakthivel et al., 2012) . This result could be explained by an update of the primer and probe sequences in the version FTD\u00ae Respiratory Pathogens 33 which was different from the version FTD\u00ae Respiratory Pathogens 21 which had been used in prior studies. An important feature of molecular detection assays is the modification of the primer and probe sequences following mutations of the viral genome sequences in the region of primer and probe binding. Unlike the current study, HAdV and HBoV revealed a weak agreement when comparing for FTD\u00ae Respiratory Pathogens 21 to the Easyplex\u00ae (EP) respiratory pathogen 12 in a study by Anderson et al., in New Zealand (Anderson et al., 2013) . In contrast to this study, where the HPIV-4 (k = 0.24) and influenza B (k = 0.51) targets had a low agreement, most of the previous studies showed good agreement (Barratt et al., 2017; Malhotra et al., 2016; Sakthivel et al., 2012) . Similar to previous studies, the majority of discrepancies were observed in samples with high Ct values (Bierbaum et al., 2014; Sakthivel et al., 2012) . We hypothesized that, the higher sample input volume used for the FTD\u00ae Respiratory Pathogens 33 (10 \u03bcL) versus 5 \u03bcL for the singleplex CDC assay could better explain these observed discrepancies in samples with high Ct values rather than differences in sensitivity of the two assays. Although the volume difference is minimal, when specimen titer is near the limit of detection by PCR even a small difference could affect detection. In contrast, RV, influenza B and HPIV-4 targets showed discordance in samples with low Ct. Rhinovirus strains are known to exhibit primer specificity problems and it is difficult to design a single pair of primers that can detect all RV types while excluding all EV types (Faux et al., 2011; Sakthivel et al., 2012) . Although it is important to resolve all these discrepancies with more sensitive and specific molecular techniques, we were unfortunately unable to address this during our study due to insufficient sample volume. On the other hand, during this study the low number of positives obtained for the HPIV-4, influenza A, 229E, NL63 and HKU1 targets could reduce accuracy of the analysis performed for these targets. Therefore additional studies based on a larger number of samples are important to support the results obtained in this study for these targets.",

The findings, however, must be considered in the context of the intended use of these reagents. For routine surveillance, the benefits gained from a multiplex kit, i.e. multiple pathogen detection and rapid results, may not be worth the additional financial cost. In contrast, during an emergency or outbreak situation, the benefits of a multiplex commercial kit may be well worth the additional price. Future studies should consider examining laboratory testing algorithms used during different outbreak or routine surveillance scenarios to better understand this cost-benefit tradeoff.",

When using the multiplex platform to test for more pathogens, viral co-detection patterns in non-hospitalized ILI patients were more heterogeneous than the hospitalized patients who often had single viruses, or had fewer viral combinations when co-detection was observed. These findings contrast some of the existing literature such as a meta-analysis by Asner et al., which did not find differences in clinical severity between single and codetections (Asner et al., 2014) . This pattern of heterogeneity in outpatients was not observed, however, when testing for fewer viruses using the singleplex assays. The clinical consequences of co-detection with respiratory viruses are not well understood, and as our study shows, co-detections can be relatively common for ILI and SARI. Some limitations, however, should be considered, namely case selection included both adults and children and lacked control for co-morbidities.",
