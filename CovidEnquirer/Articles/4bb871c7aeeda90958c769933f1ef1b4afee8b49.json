            "text": "Land in urban fringe area is the primary source for land supply and development. In Hong Kong (HK), nine new towns have been built in New Territories since 1970s, providing 172.6 km 2 built-up land and large amount of residences for 3.4 million people. However, due to land scarcity, development restriction, and social opposition, New Development Area (NDA), as the small-scale extension of New Town (NT), was designated as one of the main approaches for HK medium and long term land supply. To demonstrate the characteristics of urban fringe land use transitions in Hong Kong, literature review and case study were used in this research. The history of new town development and the scheme of new development areas were introduced firstly. Afterwards, the land use features of NT and NDA were compared and the case of Hung Shui Kiu NDA was illustrated. It is concluded that while housing, infrastructure and facility were the main elements in NTs, employment, vibrancy and environment were suggested to be the new compulsory elements in NDAs integrated to the traditional planning concepts. As for the development approach, lease modification was adopted in NDA to allow private landowners directly develop their land, in addition to the traditional development approach of land resumption in NT. It is suggested to ensure the development of NDA, the proposed development plan should be persuasive to provide the optimal land use distribution as a trade-off among the profits of developers, the interests of local villager, government concern and the provision of land for future residents. Also, community engagement will play a more important role in NDA planning process. Referring to the analysis of urban fringe land use transitions and strategies for planning and development, the study would also be helpful to others growing cities.",

Due to its limited land According to \"2007-08 Policy Address\" [2] , three features of NDAs were identified. Firstly, smaller scope in less than one fourth of the existing new towns such as Tuen Mun and Sha Tin; secondly, land supply for various uses such as housing, employment, high value-added and non-polluting industries; and thirdly, provision of quality living space and convenience to both residents and users. Compared with the targets of houses, infrastructure and community facilities in NT, the NDA contains more uses and sustainable planning concepts. However, few research concerned about NDA and its difference from NT in HK. Therefore, this study aims to illustrate how the NDA was planned and to understand how land use was transited in the urban fringe of HK.",

            "text": "Achievements in new town programme were obvious. Supported by essential infrastructure and community facilities, housing supply is the most greatest contribution made by NTs, and public and private housing were provide for millions of people. It was suggested that policy direction, project management approach, planning standards, resource mobilisation, professional input, community support, as well as innovative ideas on design and construction technique contributed to rapid NT development. [3, 4] The area, planned population, current population and planned population density [1] were showed in Table 1 . However, some issues also appeared in NT development, since it attributed to large-scale immigrations and rehousing. At the beginning of NT construction, social consequences concerning the social integration of people who have been rehoused, the building of relationships and support networks among residents, the psycho-social adjustments of residents, the relationship between residents and the government, etc., were not well attended. [5] Spatially, mismatch between place of residence and place of work and polarization was observed, leading to whitecollar jobs concentrated in the older urban areas and blue-collar jobs in the newer towns. [6] The inadequate provision of jobs and schools in new towns also resulted in widespread cross-district commuting between new towns and urban areas. [7] In the study of Tin Shui Wai new town, high unemployment rate and weakened social networks were figured out, indicating the shortages of resettling a high percentage of poor households in a single new town and the lack of access to a wider range of employment opportunities. [8] Even though the social and commuting challenges were confronted by NTs, population dispersing from urban areas to the suburbs based on the Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) strategy gained favourable comments. [9] Related researches suggested that due to the comprehensive public transportation system and relatively limited use of private cars, the widespread commuting between new towns and urban areas does not lead to severe air pollution and fuel wastage. [10] External transport links served by rail and road links to the urban area and adjacent districts created a sustainable community at the neighbourhood level, with potential for regional balance through alleviating spatial mismatch between NTs and urban areas. [9] Regarding the ongoing enhancement of road links and employment, NTs keep on adjusting to alleviate the persistent population pressure in HK and improve people's living quality.",

It shows that in NTs, the percentages of residential land were much more than those in NDAs, while the percentage of open space and other specified uses were relatively less NDAs. For example, in TWS NT nearly 60% percent built-up area was for residential use, while in HSK NDA the percentage of residential land was less than 30%, reduced by about a half. In Regarding the planning issues appeared in NTs, such as the employment unavailability and high residence density, the NDAs are like kinds of remediation to make up these shortages to improve the regional planning and development function.

There are restrict regulations for land resumption, guiding the resumption process and providing compensation standards. However, another approach for obtaining development right was proposed in the recent planned NDAs, which is lease modification. Referring to some privately owned land, private land owners in new towns were allowed in the past to modify land leases for private developments, while the government was no longer involved in this process, neither resuming nor selling land. The implementation of this lease modification approach was attributed to opposition from some pan-democratic Legislative Council Members who thought the compulsory resumption of private land would deprive the rights of landowners to develop the land on their own. [13] In the study of KTN and FLN NDA, the two approaches were both adopted, namely the enhanced Conventional New Town Approach. It is said that \"private land will be resumed for development according to planned uses, while flexibility will be provided for private landowners to apply for lease modification (including in-situ land exchange)",

[16] A set of criteria with specified deadlines of lease modification application should be met to get approval. This is to ensure that such applications will comply with the planning and timetable for the NDAs development. On this front, the Government will impose more stringent requirements in processing applications for modification of lease subject to specified criteria. The criteria include stipulating that only sites planned for private development are eligible for the lease modification applications. The applications must comply with specific guidelines and conditions to ensure comprehensive planning, and time limits will be stipulated for completion of such applications to ensure timely provision of housing and other facilities. The land owners must also offer fair treatment to tenants/occupants, including providing a monetary compensation comparable to the Government's arrangement. [16] This combined approach aims to protect private development right without compromising the planning intention and timely land supply. The ownerships of current development area, which were much more scattered and complex than the land in previous NTs, may be the reason for adopting lease modification approach. If compulsory resumption was carried out, it is not easy for so many land owners to take out their lands to government. It may also save the negotiating time to landowners who initially opposed the land resumption and were afraid to lose their landownerships. In the meanwhile, financial expenditure of land resumption would be reduced for government.",

[13] Environmental sustainability has been paid more and more attention in recent development plans. The land use zones of \"Agricultural\" which was rarely mentioned in NT plans, were designated in the OZPs of FLN and KTN NDAs. It aimed to retain and safeguard fallow arable land with good potential for rehabilitation. In HK, the Transportation is related to both vibrancy and environment. In addition to compact city form and population concentration near the public transport interchanges, comprehensive pedestrian and cycle traffic networks will be provided to minimize road traffic and improve regional accessibility. Environmental friendly transportation system was proposed in OZPs. In addition to pedestrian and cycle lane, electric bus may be operated to provide feeder services from the area to railway stations. Compared with NT development in the last few decades, in NDA development, peoples' needs could not be satisfied with residence and infrastructure only, but to live more comfortably with social harmony and better environment.",

However, regarding the high density in Hong Kong Island and Kowloon, as well as the complex land ownership in suburban and rural New Territories, it is hard to develop a new town in traditional way. As the city expanding, the development strategies would also be changed to adapt current situation, including the complicated ownership, peoples' increasing needs and environmental issues.

However, in some peoples' opinion, this approach is more likely to protect developers' development right and increase their interests, rather than protect local villagers' rights. As for the government, it is essential to trade off among the profits of developers, the interests of local villager, and the provision of land for future residents. No matter what development approaches were implemented, the baseline is the Outline Zoning Plan, which means all development should be consistent with the planning uses. Therefore, more involvements were required in the planning phase, and the in advanced understanding of the interests of developers, local villagers and future residents were essential. If the OZP is persuasive enough to provide the optimal land use distribution regarding opinions from all affected stakeholders, it would become the balanced decision based on the trade-off of different peoples' interests to guarantee the development, whatever the development approach is.",

However, it was more and more difficult to acquire large pieces of land for new towns, and NDA was designated as the new approach to continually supply built-up land in urban fringe area. The land use transition from NT to NDA were embodied in three aspects, including land use structure and function, development approach, and planning concepts. Rather than the main function of residential land supply in NT, commercial, industrial and mixed uses were also considered to achieve various urban functions in the area. Regarding the scattered and complicated land ownership, private landowners were able to directly develop their land through lease modification in NDA, as an alternative development approach of land resumption in NT. In addition, vibrancy and nature became two essential planning concepts in NDA for more sustainable development. Since NDA was an extension of its closest NT, NDA could make up the functions that were absent in NT, and their interaction would improve regional attractiveness and vitality in urban fringe area. Confronting the challenges in NDA, the planning process and public engagement are more important than NT. The proposed layout plan should be persuasive enough to provide the optimal land use distribution based on opinions from all affected stakeholders, as a balanced decision and trade-off of different peoples' interests. In addition to the case of HK, the understanding of land use transition in urban fringe area and strategies for development challenges would also be helpful to others growing cities.",

The New Town Development Programme in Hong Kong initiated in 1973, targeting to provide public and private housing for millions of people supported by essential infrastructure and community facilities. Nine new towns were developed in three generations. Tsuen Wan, Sha Tin and Tuen Mun started works in the early 1970s as the first generation, the second of Tai Po, Fanling/Sheung Shui and Yuen Long in the late 1970s, and the third in the 1980s and 1990s, including Tseung Kwan O, Tin Shui Wai and Tung Chung. The population of these nine new towns was 3.47 million in 2016, and it is expected to rise to 3.63 million in 2021. [1] However, due to land scarcity, development restriction, and social opposition, new town project has not been proposed since 1990s, instead the New Development Area (NDA), as the small-scale extension of NT, was designated as one of the main approaches in 2007 for HK medium and long term land supply.
