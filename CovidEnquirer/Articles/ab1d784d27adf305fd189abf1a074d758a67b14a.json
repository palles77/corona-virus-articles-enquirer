B ronchiolitis is the number one cause of hospitalization in infants during the first 12 months of life resulting in approximately 100,000 hospital admissions annually. 1, 2 In the United States this translates to an estimated cost of $1.73 billion and direct medical costs exceeding $500 million. 2 Clinical guidelines recommend primarily supportive care and discourage the use of pharmacotherapies and diagnostics as they do not improve outcomes. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] However, there continues to be wide variability in hospital-based care for bronchiolitis both among US and international institutions. 2, 10, 11 Given the high financial and medical burden of bronchiolitis on families and healthcare facilities, it is prudent to continue reviewing evidence based management of this common disease in order to optimize resource utilization, decrease healthcare costs, and decrease unnecessary hospitalization. 11, 12 BACKGROUND Pathogenesis Bronchiolitis is a viral illness occurring in children under age 2 years characterized by an upper respiratory prodrome followed by a lower respiratory tract infection. The virus infects the terminal bronchiolar epithelium cells causing edema, excessive mucous, and epithelial sloughing resulting in obstruction and atelectasis of the small airways. Virus induced wheezing or acute viral-triggered asthma may overlap with the clinical syndrome of bronchiolitis in young children.",

The diagnosis of bronchi olitis should be based primarily on history and physical presentation and should not routinely include imaging or lab diagnostics. 7 Persistent increased respiratory effort, severe tachypnea, hypoxemia, apnea, or intolerance of feeds may warrant hospitalization. 20, 21 Assessing severity for management decisions is complicated by the variability in exam findings over time. Evidence relating specific clinical finding with outcomes is limited. 22 There have been many attempts to create an objective clinical scoring system for severity assessment based on clinical evaluation, but there has been no widespread adoption of any one system due to the lack of validated predictive value. 23 In addition to known risk factors for severe disease, the effects of the respiratory symptoms on feeding, hydration, and mental status should also be assessed when considering hospitalization.",

They are not needed to diagnose bronchiolitis, do not alter the clinical course, and can lead to unnecessary antibiotic use. Chest radiographs should be reserved for patients in whom the physical exam findings suggest an alternative diagnosis (concern for foreign body, vascular ring, undiagnosed cardiac disease, etc.) or presentation is particularly severe. 7, 24 Features of bronchiolitis on chest radiograph are nonspecific, often with patchy or segmental atelec tasis and peribronchial thickening. These findings can often be interpreted as developing pneumonia leading to unnecessary antibiotic use, particularly for patients with mild to moderate disease. 7, 24 In a nine year prospective study of 565 children hospi talized with RSV only 0.9 percent developed subsequent bacterial pneumonia. 25 Obtaining chest radiographs is warranted in those presenting with severe disease requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission or mechanical ventilation. These patients are at increased risk for developing com plications such as secondary bacterial pneumonia, pneumomediastinum, and pneumothorax. 26 Laboratory Diagnostics Viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing is not routinely recommended. There is no clear benefit to determining the exact viral etiology by PCR in a patient with known bronchiolitis. 18 There may be some potential benefit of a viral PCR in an unclear clinical picture or severe presentation where multiple diagnoses are being considered. If a child receiving monthly prophylaxis with palivizu mab presents with bronchiolitis, viral PCR should be performed to determine if RSV is the etiological agent. A positive RSV finding warrants discontinu ation of the prophylaxis given the low likelihood of repeat infection with RSV in the same year. 7 Secondary bacterial infections are uncommon in children with bronchiolitis, with the exception of acute otitis media. One nine year prospective study involving 565 patients with RSV bronchiolitis demonstrated subsequent bacterial infection of any kind in only 1.2%. 25 Other studies have shown that in febrile infants with a distinct viral syndrome (i.e. bronchiolitis) the risk of a secondary bacterial infection in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is less than 1 percent. 8 A systemic review of serious bacterial infections in febrile hospitalized infants age 30-90 days confirmed the extreme rarity of bacteremia and CSF infections and found the rate of urinary tract infection to be 1%. 27 These findings are supported by other prospective studies suggesting that routine evaluation for serious bacterial infec tion (complete blood count, urinalysis, urine cul ture, blood culture, CSF studies) in febrile infants age 30-90 days with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis is unjustified. 7,28,29",

The Canadian Bron chiolitis Epinephrine Steroid Trial, 46 a multicenter randomized trial involving 800 patients from 8 EDs, compared hospitalizations over a 7-day period. After adjusting for multiple variables, there was no change in need for admission by day 7 in the group of patients receiving nebulized epinephrine plus oral dexamethasone compared to the group receiving nebulized placebo plus oral placebo. Additionally, the Hartling et al systemic review of bronchodilators found nebulized epinephrine use in the ED de creased hospital admission on the day of the visit compared to placebo but did not decrease overall admission rates. 44 Unlike albuterol, nebulized epinephrine cannot be administered at home. It has a transient effect with no significant decrease in progression of illness and subsequent admission rates. Limited evidence does not support routine use of nebulized epineph rine in the ED setting when the plan is to discharge the patient home. However, these trials did not include children with severe disease or respiratory failure making it difficult to generalize the recom mendations against bronchodilator use to those specific clinical scenarios. Recent studies show administration of bronchodilators in the ED in creased with increasing age (increased likelihood of presenting with recurrent wheezing), decreasing oxygen saturation, increasing respiratory rate, and worsening retractions. 11 A trial of albuterol or nebulized epinephrine as a rescue agent in severe disease may be warranted. 7 Further studies evalu ating the use and effect of bronchodilators admin istered for this purpose are needed.",
