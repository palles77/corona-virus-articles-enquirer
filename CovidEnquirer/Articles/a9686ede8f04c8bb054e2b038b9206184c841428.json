            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a feline coronavirus (FCoV)-induced fatal disease in wild and domestic cats. There are two FCoV serotypes. Both type I and II FCoV can replicate in Felis catus whole fetus (fcwf)-4 cells, but the replicability of type I FCoV in feline cell lines is lower than that of type II FCoV, the reason for which is unclear. Inhibition of IFN\u03b2 production by non-structural and structural proteins, excluding spike protein has been reported in many coronavirus infections. In this study, we investigated whether IFN\u03b2 is involved in the difference in replicability in feline cell lines between types I and II FCoV. When fcwf-4 cells were infected with FCoV, the virus titer of type II FCoV in the culture supernatant was higher than that of type I FIPV. When the IFN\u03b2 expression level in FCoV-infected fcwf-4 cells was semi-quantitatively analyzed, infection with type I FIPV, excluding type I FIPV UCD-1, highly induced IFN\u03b2 expression. In contrast, induction of IFN\u03b2 by type II FCoV infection was significantly lower than that by type I FIPV. In addition, when fcwf-4 cells were adsorbed by FIPV and then stimulated with Poly(I:C), type II FCoV infection inhibited Poly(I:C)-induced IFN\u03b2 gene expression. Also, the proliferation of type I FIPV was enhanced by a IFN inhibitor. These findings clarified that, unlike type I FIPV, type II FCoV strongly inhibits IFN\u03b2 expression in infected cells. It was also suggested that the IFN\u03b2-inducing ability is different among type I FIPV strains.",

Feline coronavirus (FCoV) belongs to alphacoronavirus, which includes porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and canine coronavirus (CCoV). FCoV has been classified into two biotypes: weakly pathogenic feline enteric coronavirus (FECV; avirulent FCoV) and strongly pathogenic feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV; virulent FCoV) (Pedersen NC, 2009) . Cats that developed FIP were affected in several organs, including the liver, lungs, spleen, and central nervous system, forming lesions accompanied by necrosis and pyogenic granulomatous inflammation. In some cats, pleural effusion and ascitic fluid accumulated (Pedersen NC, 2009) . The FCoV virion is mainly composed of nucleocapsid (N), envelope (E), membrane (M), and peplomer spike (S) proteins (Tekes and Thiel, 2016) . FECV and FIPV are classified into 2 serotypes, type I and II FCoV, based on differences in the amino acid sequence of S protein (Motokawa et al., 1995) .",

Type I IFN is an antiviral factor produced in response to viral infection. IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 of type I IFN is produced by several cell types and plays an important role in the early defense mechanism against viral infection. For viruses to replicate in cells, inhibition of the antiviral action of IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 (type I IFN response) is necessary. The mechanism of inhibition of type I IFN response by IFN\u03b2 has been closely investigated in several viruses. For example, in TGEV, PEDV, murine hepatitis virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, it has been reported that structural proteins, excluding non-structural proteins and spike protein, inhibit IFN\u03b2 production (Case et al., 2018 (Case et al., , 2016 Ding et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2017; Li et al., 2016; Lu et al., 2011; Lui et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016) .

Of the genes in the recombined region, nsp14 (exonuclease), nsp15 (endoribonuclease), and nsp16 (2\u2032-0-methyltransferase) present in the ORF1b of other coronaviruses have been reported to inhibit IFN\u03b2 gene expression (Case et al., 2016; Coccia and Battistini, 2015; Deng et al., 2017; Menachery et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2016) , and these nsps are considered to prevent recognition of viral RNA by host PRR.

The IFN\u03b2-inducing ability was low only in FIPV UCD-1 among the type I FIPV strains, and this may have been due to viral replication. Indeed, the virus titer in the culture supernatant of type I FIPV UCD-1-infected cells was lower than that in the culture supernatants of cells infected with the other type I FIPV strains. In addition, in an experiment in which cells were inoculated with type I FIPV UCD-1 at a high infectivity titer, the IFN\u03b2 gene was induced to a level similar to that induced by type I FIPV KU-2. However, type I FIPV UCD-4 with a replicability level similar to that of type I FIPV UCD-1 strongly induced IFN\u03b2 expression.
