The conventional amplification method is 39 based on PCR, which requires a thermocycler for delicate temperature modulation. As an 40 alternative to the thermal cycling-based amplification, isothermal amplification methods are 41 available, which rely primarily on a strand-displacing polymerase or T7 RNA polymerase at a 42 constant temperature 7 . However, the complex composition of the isothermal amplification 43 mixtures often renders these approaches incompatible with detection methods and whole 44 diagnosis generally becomes a multi-step process [8] [9] [10] [11] . The diagnostic regimen with multi-step 45 procedures requires additional time, instruments, and reagents, as well as skilled personnel to 46 perform the diagnostic procedure.

SENSR consists of two simple 62 enzymatic reactions, a ligation reaction by SplintR ligase and subsequent transcription by T7 63 RNA polymerase. The resulting transcript forms an RNA aptamer that binds to a fluorogenic 64 dye and produces fluorescence only when target RNA exists in a sample. SENSR was able to 65 detect target RNA of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in 30 minutes 66 with a limit of detection of 0.1 aM. We further applied this platform to detect various 67 pathogens, Vibrio vulnificus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-68 related Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Influenza A viruses, by merely redesigning the 69 hybridization regions of the probes.

The detection of multiple 229 biomarkers is frequently needed to make a better decision by reducing false-positive and 230 false-negative results. Based on the high specificity of SENSR probes and availability of 231 light-up RNA aptamers with distinct spectral properties 27 , we hypothesized that we could 232 design two sets of SENSR probes that operate orthogonally in a single reaction to detect their 233 respective target RNAs.234 First, we developed an orthogonal reporter probe for Influenza A virus. Since the 235 MRSA infection causes flu-like symptoms, discrimination of this pathogen from common 236 Influenza A virus is required. Furthermore, the patient with the influenza A infection is more 237 susceptible to the MRSA infection 28 . Collectively, simultaneous detection and discrimination 238 of both pathogens can help the diagnosis and follow-up actions. An orthogonal reporter probe 239 for Influenza A virus was designed by replacing its aptamer template region with the template 240 for the Broccoli aptamer 29-32 which binds to DFHBI-1T ((5Z)and exhibits spectral properties distinct from that of the malachite green aptamer. 243 Secondary structures of the new reporter probe and corresponding full-length RNA transcript 244 were simulated, using NUPACK, and satisfied the probe design criteria without further 245 optimization (SupplementaryTable 2). Dual detection of MRSA and Influenza A virus was 246 tested in SENSR reactions in which the two probe pairs, their cognate fluorogenic dyes, and 247 various concentrations of the target RNAs were added(Fig. 6a). When the probe pairs are 248 hybridized to their respective target RNAs, and successful transcription follows, the RNA 249 aptamers would bind their cognate dyes and emit distinguishable fluorescence.
