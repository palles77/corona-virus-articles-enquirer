Conditions such as leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, nonregenerative anemia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, leukemias, other bone marrow cancers, and infectious diseases (e.g., histoplasmosis, ehrlichiosis) may be confirmed only by assessment of bone marrow cytology. Bone marrow in the young animal is cellular and exists in the flat bones (sternum, ribs, pelvic bones, and vertebrae) and in the long bones (humerus and femur).

Lymph node aspiration typically is indicated (1) in patients with generalized lymphadenomegaly, (2) to evaluate abnormally enlarged solitary lymph nodes, and (3) in suspected instances of tumor metastases to lymph nodes. Surgically prepare the skin over the node from which a biopsy specimen is to be taken. With one hand, localize and immobilize the lymph node; with the other hand, guide the aspiration biopsy needle into the affected node. Affix a 6-mL syringe onto a 22-to 20-gauge needle (a 25-gauge needle can be used when the site to be aspirated is particularly small), and advance the needle into the lymph node. Withdrawal of the syringe to approximately 0.5 mL before inserting it into the tissue is recommended. Doing so helps to prevent expelling material when removing the sample from the tissue. When the needle is in position in the approximate center of the node, gradually draw negative pressure on the syringe to a level of 4 to 5 mL. Hold the negative pressure in place for a few seconds. Release, and then repeat two or three times.

Find an isoelectric lead-that is, a lead for which the total number of positive (upward) and negative (downward) deflections of the QRS complex is equal to zero (Figure 4-30) . When there is no perfectly isoelectric lead, use the one that comes closest. 2.

If the perpendicular lead is negative, the axis is at the negative end of that lead (each lead has a plus and a minus pole marked). If the perpendicular lead is positive, the mean electrical axis is at the positive end of the perpendicular lead. For example, if aVL is isoelectric (normally it is), lead II is its perpendicular.

Laryngoscopy is of value in the diagnosis of upper airway obstructions such as eversion of the lateral ventricles, collapsed arytenoid cartilages, hyperplasia of the vocal cords, nodules on the vocal cords, elongated soft palate, collapsed proximal trachea, and traumatic injuries to the neck. Note also, however, that a careful visual examination of the larynx in the anesthetized patient (only) can be highly valuable even without the use of endoscopic equipment-for example, for assessment of laryngeal movement in patients with laryngeal paralysis. Suspected lesions inside the larynx may be difficult to visualize with or without endoscopic equipment. Examination of the trachea and main stem bronchi requires endoscopic evaluation to assess the integrity of the airway for conditions such as collapsed trachea, mediastinal tumors, hilar lymph node enlargement, parasitic nodules (Filaroides osleri), and foreign body aspiration. In addition, tracheobronchoscopy is a valuable technique that permits culturing and cytologic examination of material from bronchi involved in chronic respiratory disease. Upper airway obstruction that is not responsive to conservative therapy is an indication for more extensive diagnostic procedures, such as bronchoscopy. Note: The discussion that follows centers around indications and capabilities of endoscopy in clinical practice. The discussion is not intended to be used as a \"How-To\" instruction guide on performing endoscopic procedures in dogs and cats.

The tube does not have to enter the stomach. When measuring the tube length, measure from the tip of the nose to the eighth or ninth rib (Figure 4-34) .",

Hold the head gently upward for a few seconds to allow the solution to reach the back of the nasal cavity. In most patients, it is desirable to wait 1 to 2 minutes and then to repeat the instillation in the same nostril. For larger dogs, 2% lidocaine solution (0.5 to 2.0 mL) gradually instilled into the nostril is an alternative technique to achieve topical anesthesia. Lubricate the tube with a thin coat of a water-soluble lubricant, such a 2% lidocaine lubricating gel. Pass the tube into the nasal cavity while directing the tube tip medially and ventrally into the ventral meatus. The anatomic shape of a dog's nostril usually requires directing the tip medially but almost perpendicular to the plane of the nasal cavity to facilitate insertion. Initial resistance (pressure, not pain) usually is perceived, and the patient's head as expected quickly retracts, leaving the operator holding the tube tip some inches away from the patient's nose. Be persistent. Repeat the procedure, as necessary, by quickly inserting the first inch or more of the tube into the nostril. With the other hand, push the nasal philtrum up, and with a finger, push the lateral portion of the nostril medially. This will help facilitate movement of the tube into the ventromedial nasal meatus. Once started, the remainder of the technique is relatively straightforward.",

At issue is the fact that abdominal ultrasound and/or gastrointestinal endoscopy has largely replaced contrast radiography of the gastrointestinal tract and for good reason. Diagnostic modalities such as ultrasound (in the hands of an experienced individual) and endoscopy have a much greater diagnostic yield than the less sensitive contrast study. So why even try? Endoscopes are not available in every practice, and limited access to ultrasound equipment, much less someone who is qualified to use it, puts routine use of advanced diagnostic modalities out of reach for many practices. However, it must be appreciated that with regard to diagnostic value, a radiographic contrast study of the gastrointestinal tract is a far less sensitive diagnostic modality than abdominal ultrasound or endoscopy. The procedure for the gastrointestinal radiographic contrast study is outlined next. Contrast agents available for gastrointestinal studies include barium suspension preparations or Micropaque (Guerbet, Villepinte, France), and water-soluble agents (Gastrografin [Bracco Diagnostics, Princeton, New Jersey], which is 60% meglumine and 10% sodium diatrizoate). Water-soluble agents are used if bowel perforation is suspected. Undiluted water-soluble agents are hypertonic and should be diluted at a ratio of one part Gastrografin to two parts water. No single procedure is appropriate for all gastrointestinal cases. The clinician must select procedures based on the clinical history and physical findings, apparent location of the lesion within the gastrointestinal tract, endoscopic findings, and results from other imaging studies, such as abdominal ultrasound.",

With an experienced ultrasonographer, the diagnostic value of abdominal ultrasound far exceeds that derived from evaluating sequential radiographs of a patient after oral administration of a contrast medium such as barium. In the event that ultrasound capability is not available, a contrast study of the upper gastrointestinal tract still can be performed. However, the clinician must appreciate that a barium contrast study of the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum has a low sensitivity as a diagnostic test. That is, negative findings are not expected to correlate well with the absence of clinical disease. A negative study does not rule out disease. Likewise, a contrast study of the upper gastrointestinal tract is not recognized for its ability to confirm a diagnosis of gastrointestinal tract disease, even when disease is present. Perhaps the greatest value in performing the upper gastrointestinal series in a dog or cat today centers on the need to identify a displacement of the stomach and/or small intestine because of an extraluminal mass lesion or congenital defect in the patient. In addition, the use of a microfine barium suspension may facilitate identification of intestinal ulcers, irregularities (e.g., intraluminal neoplasia), and radiolucent foreign bodies. However, variable-diameter, solid-phase radiopaque markers called barium-impregnated polyethylene spheres (BIPS) can be used to assess gastric emptying time, gastrointestinal transit times, and, to some extent, obstructive disorders.",

            "text": "The procedure for artificial insemination in dogs includes the following steps: 1. Determine the correct time to inseminate by test-teasing with a stud, by cytologic examination of vaginal smears, or by vaginoscopic examination to determine the day when vaginal folds change from round to angular. Breed the day after the bitch first stands staunchly to accept service and \"flags\" her tail or during cytologic indications of estrus (complete cornification of vaginal epithelial cells) but before WBCs reappear in the smears. Breed at 48-hour intervals until the female dog goes out of heat or for three or four inseminations. 2. If the vulva is soiled, clean it thoroughly with alcohol swabs (Box 4-15). 3. Gently aspirate semen through the inseminating pipette into the warm syringe. applying the artificial vagina to the shaft of the penis, apply pressure with the thumb and forefinger proximal to the exposed glandis. This usually can be done with one motion as the stud is thrusting. If the stud is shy and not interested, massage the penis slightly in the prepuce or in the artificial vagina to cause erection. When erection of the bulbus is felt, reflect the prepuce posteriorly to free the bulbus. Apply pressure with the thumb and forefinger behind the bulbus, circling the shaft of the penis. After completion of the most rapid pelvic thrusting and ejaculation of the sperm-rich fractions of semen (1 to 3 mL), twist the penis 180 degrees backward in a horizontal plane, between the hind legs, so that the penis remains in the same plane as in the forward position, with the thumb and forefinger still applying pressure around the circumference of the penis proximal to the bulbus. The penis cannot be twisted unless the prepuce is reflected posterior or proximal to the bulbus glandis. Twisting the penis in this position simulates a natural \"tie\" and allows the person collecting the semen to better visualize the collection (artificial vaginas are widely available now and are much preferred because they simulate the natural pressure of the vagina). The first drops of ejaculate may be discarded, especially if any urine is present. Collect the sperm-rich fraction separately. A clear ejaculate is prostatic fluid, which may be collected separately for examination. 6. After semen collection, place the penis in the forward position, straighten out the prepuce to avoid paraphimosis, and remove the bitch from the room. Allow the stud to lick the erect penis and lose the erection. Check the stud for evidence of paraphimosis before it is released or caged. The ejaculate consists of three fractions: First fraction: Urethral secretion (usually clear fluid)-0.1 to 2 mL within 50 seconds, pH 6.3. If evidence of urine is present, discard this fraction and do not add it to the sperm-rich fraction. In most ejaculates collected from dogs, the first and second semen fractions are collected together. Second fraction: Sperm-containing secretion (milky opaque fluid)-0.5 to 3 mL within 1 to 2 minutes, pH 6.1. Third fraction: Prostatic secretion (usually clear fluid)-2 to 20 mL within 30 minutes, pH 6.5. The total specimen is 0.3 to 20 mL, pH 6.4. Because the first and third fractions are clear, waterlike material and the second fraction is milky-opaque, the clinician can separate them by changing collecting tubes as each fraction is ejaculated. Collection of only enough prostatic fluid to rinse the sperm fraction into the test tube is best. Too much prostatic fluid may be detrimental to the longevity of sperm in storage. Collecting individual fractions may be important in determining the site of an inflammatory reaction, but for artificial insemination only the sperm-rich, low-volume ejaculate is needed for insemination, dilution, or freezing. 7. Return the stud to his cage. Retain the bitch until the semen is examined, if insemination is to be performed. ",

In half of the dog population, changes consistent with benign prostatic hyperplasia are present by 4 to 5 years of age, especially in older intact dogs.

Abdominal ultrasonography is the preferred technique for evaluating prostate size, shape, and consistency.

Clinical signs related to the upper respiratory tract in dogs and cats are among the most common presenting complaints encountered in small animal practice and, interestingly, are frequent reasons for referral to specialty practices and veterinary teaching hospitals. The oral and nasal cavities are important portals of entry for foreign body entrapment and infectious agents. In addition to the occurrence of nasal neoplasia and trauma, it is not surprising that upper respiratory tract diseases in dogs and cats are common presentations. However, upper respiratory signs can be associated with significantly different underlying causes. Localizing the problem amid a variety of clinical signs in an anatomically complex area presents significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges to even the most astute clinician.

The measurement is made from the baseline (not from the bottom of the Q wave) to the top of the R wave. Two other criteria that indicate left ventricular enlargement are present. The QRS complex is 0.07 second (three boxes) wide and ST segment slurring is present, because the ST segment moves into the T wave without straightening out along the baseline.

ST segment slurring is characterized by the slurring of the downstroke of the R wave into the T wave, with no discernible ST segment. This occurs because of ischemia resulting from wall strain in cardiac enlargement. (Courtesy NS Moise, New York State College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York.

Elevate the bitch's rear quarters to a 45-degree angle by having an assistant pick up the bitch by holding the hock region so that no pressure is applied to the ventral abdomen and uterus. Eject the semen gently and slowly. Eject a bubble of air to push all the semen through the pipette. Deposit the semen in the anterior vagina. 5. Remove the pipette, and hold the bitch in an elevated position for 5 minutes. During this time, use the finger encased in a sterile glove to \"feather\" the ceiling of the vagina to stimulate constrictor activity. This may be important to simulate a \"tie\" and transport semen into the uterus. 6. Lower the bitch to the normal position, and immediately walk her for 5 minutes so that she does not sit down or jump up on a person and allow semen to run back out of the vagina. 7. For best conception, inseminate undiluted fresh semen immediately. 8. Refrigerated extended semen is best used within 24 to 48 hours if possible. However, refrigerated semen has been kept viable for up to 9 days with proper care. Skim milk has been used as an economical and adequate extender. Heat milk to 92\u00b0 to 94\u00b0 C for 10 minutes, cool it, and skim it at room temperature. To each milliliter, add 1000 units of crystalline penicillin. If Pseudomonas species affect the semen, polymyxin B may be added at 200 units/mL of extender. Dilute semen with extender at a semen/extender ratio of 1:1 to 1:4. Extend canine semen for freezing with a diluent containing 11% lactose, 4% glycerin, and 20% egg yolk. Refrigerate the 1:4 diluted semen; then pipette 0.05-mL portions into depressions in a block of dry ice and hold them for 8 minutes to freeze. Store the frozen pellets in liquid nitrogen. Frozen semen can be thawed in buffered saline at 30\u00b0 to 37\u00b0 C. Good semen may be stored in liquid nitrogen for many years without significant loss of motility.

            "text": "semen COlleCtiOn: Canine Semen is collected for examination for breeding soundness, for investigation of infertility or prostatic disease, and for artificial insemination (Box 4-16).The following steps outline the procedure for collecting semen from a male dog: 1. Take the stud and an estrous teaser bitch (if available) to a quiet room where there will be no distractions and where there is good traction (rubber mats or rug) for mounting by the stud. 2. Hold the bitch, and allow the stud to \"flirt\" (become aroused) for several minutes. If the bitch is in heat, a brief period of foreplay (\"foreplay\" may not be the appropriate word to describe the mating behavior of dogs, but it illustrates the point) with both dogs unrestricted will help the process. 3. If necessary, have assistants restrain the muzzled bitch and control the stud by a collar and leash. Bring the stud up to the rear end of the bitch, and allow him to mount her or keep his nose in the region of her perineal area. 4. Attach the artificial vagina to the semen collection tube, and apply a scant amount of lubricant to the opening of the artificial vagina. 5. If mounting occurs, allow the stud to grasp the bitch and start to thrust his pelvis in an attempt to copulate. Gently, from the side of the sheath, grasp the penis by the prepuce and move the prepuce back over the engorged bulbus glandis; while For dogs undergoing BAL, particularly when reactive (allergic) airway disease is suspected, pretreatment with a bronchodilator is appropriate and is recommended. Aminophylline can be administered at 5 mg/kg (cats) or 11 mg/kg (dogs) orally 1 to 2 hours before the procedure. Alternatively, terbutaline, 0.01 mg/kg, can be administered subcutaneously to cats 30 minutes before the procedure.Bronchoscopic BAL allows direct visualization of the airway or lobe of interest. In medium to large dogs, place the bronchoscope directly through a sterile endotracheal tube. Use of an inexpensive, disposable endotracheal tube adaptor permits simultaneous administration of oxygen and anesthetic throughout the procedure. Saline can be infused from a syringe directly through the biopsy channel of the endoscope. The bronchoscope serves as the infusion catheter. Using this technique, samples can be collected effectively from multiple lobes. Blind placement (nonbronchoscopic) BAL using a rubber end-hole catheter is required in cats and small dogs. Blind placement is also appropriately used in patients with generalized lung or airway disease when discrete placement of the bronchoscope cannot be accomplished reliably.",

Do not withdraw the bronchoscope or catheter while maintaining significant negative pressure because this may lacerate the airway, leading to pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.BAL is an invasive diagnostic procedure that is not without risk of injury or death. After completion of BAL, administration of 100% oxygen for 5 to 10 minutes via endotracheal tube is recommended for all patients. Evaluate the patient carefully for breathing effort and oxygen saturation (pulse oximetry) during recovery. Although significant quantities of fluid remain in the airways after BAL, most of the volume is absorbed rapidly. Residual amounts of fluid, however, can be retained for 24 to 48 hours after the procedure. During this time, some patients will manifest cough. Crackles may be auscultated. ",

            "text": "For the procedure, a 22-to 25-gauge disposable needle (such as a 1-inch spinal needle) with stylet is preferred. Leave the stylet within the needle until the lung has been penetrated. Then quickly remove the stylet and immediately attach a sterile 6-to 12-mL syringe. The amount of air that might enter the lung between the time the stylet is removed and the syringe is attached is negligible. Holding the syringe carefully and steadily against the patient's thorax, establish negative pressure in the same manner as when obtaining an aspirate from a lymph node. As much as the patient will permit, attempt three to four aspirations without withdrawing the needle.Alternatively, insert a conventional 25-gauge needle attached to a 6-mL syringe subcutaneously over the area of interest. Then establish significant negative pressure while the tip of the needle is still positioned in the subcutaneous tissues outside the parietal pleura. While maintaining the same amount of negative pressure in the syringe, direct the needle into the lung, leave it in place for 1 to 2 seconds, and withdraw it completely. Apply any material collected directly to glass slide. This procedure is best conducted in patients that are awake. Attempting the procedure in anesthetized dogs or cats could result in an unsuccessful aspiration, or, if the lungs were under positive pressure (ventilation or bagging), the risk of causing pneumothorax could be increased. Other reported complications include hemothorax (always exciting), lung laceration caused by patient movement during the procedure, pulmonary hemorrhage, and hemoptysis. Contraindications to fine-needle aspiration include patients with a known bleeding diathesis and coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, uncontrolled coughing, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary cysts, and bullous emphysema.Ultrasound-guided techniques for fine-needle aspiration or biopsy of the lung recently have been described and generally are associated with fewer procedural complications. However, additional training and experience, in addition to having access to the proper size and type of ultrasound probe, are critical.",

In companion animals, inhalation therapy is most useful for humidifying air in the respiratory tract and moistening the mucous membranes (nebulization). Sustained inspiration of dry air or gases causes irritation to the respiratory epithelium, which in turn results in swelling, bronchial gland hypertrophy, goblet cell proliferation, and loss of ciliary epithelium over time. Respiratory secretions become thick and tenacious, and efficient bronchial drainage is impaired. The objectives of inhalation therapy include the following: 1. Humidification of bronchial mucous membranes 2. Deposition of miniscule amounts of potent drugs in smaller airways to achieve optimal topical therapeutic effects with minimal systemic side effects (e.g., bronchodilators) 3. Deposition of moderate amounts of potent agents or agents that are effective only topically (e.g., antibiotics and mucolytics) 4. Deposition of relatively large quantities of bland substances that promote bronchial drainage with minimal irritation (e.g., saline, propylene glycol, glycerin, and detergents)",

Caution: Do not perform this procedure until it can be confirmed by catheterization or cystoscopy that the urethra is patent.With the bladder filled with urine or saline (via catheterization), lift the patient (preferably sedated or anesthetized, although this procedure can be done in the awake patient) into a position such that the tail and perineum are ventral and the head is upright. The spine should be approximately perpendicular to the working surface. Using one or both hands, gradually increase pressure on the bladder to induce and maintain a forceful stream of urine. Objectively, small uroliths will be extruded. If the procedure is only partially successful, it can be repeated as necessary.

Because patients with urethral obstructions may have a significant volume of urine in the bladder at the time of presentation, some authors recommend performing cystocentesis to relieve the internal pressure before attempting urohydropulsion. However, in patients that have had a profoundly distended bladder for several hours (even days), penetrating the urinary bladder with a needle presents significant risk of rupturing a fragile bladder. The next step, of course, is abdominal surgery. I recommend avoiding cystocentesis whenever possible. The volume of saline required to flush uroliths into the bladder is inconsequential considering the total volume already present.With the patient positioned in lateral recumbency, retract the prepuce and expose the penis as for conventional bladder catheterization technique. Use sterile technique to pass an appropriately sized flexible catheter, which is advanced to the point of obstruction. Attach a catheter-tipped 60-mL syringe filled with warmed (my preference) sterile saline and a water-soluble lubricant mixture (approximately two parts saline to one part lubricant) to the urinary catheter. An assistant places a gloved (always preferred) finger into the rectum to identify and occlude the lumen of the pelvic urethra at the level of the pubis. Subsequently, infuse saline forcefully into the catheter to dilate the urethra proximal to the obstructing urolith. At that point, release the digital pressure on the proximal urethra while the solution continues to be infused through the catheter. Objectively, the pressure within the urethra forces small stones retrograde into the urinary bladder, thereby relieving the obstruction.",
