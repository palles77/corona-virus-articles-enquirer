Jackson Clarke 1 During the course of work, the autopsy pathologist and staff members encounter a number of potential biohazards. By adhering to strict safety precautions, practicing proper autopsy technique, and using proper instruments and equipment, the pathologist can limit the risk of injury to individuals working at the autopsy table. This chapter provides an overview of important autopsy biosafety recommendations for usual hospital-based practice. Many points cannot be discussed in sufficient detail, however. Pathologists must work with their local infection control and occupational health and safety departments to implement a complete biosafety plan that includes ongoing review of all safety concerns and a continuing program of safety education.",

The experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) due to coronavirus in which a high percentage of health care workers were infected offered many lessons in biosafety. 2 The precautions required for such specialized lethal diseases are beyond the scope of this chapter. Suspected cases of these conditions should be referred to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as soon as possible and hopefully before postmortem examination. Local medical examiners or offices and public health laboratories may provide guidance. 3 The CDC, in association with other federal, state, and local agencies, has designated regional laboratories (Laboratory Response Network) to aid in the diagnosis and containment of lethal transmissible conditions. 4, 5 AUTOPSY INFECTION CONTROL PRECAUTIONS General Autopsy Biosafety Practices Historically, most physicians and other healthcare workers have accepted the moral responsibility of caring for patients with contagious disease. 5 The occupational exposure, however, places them at risk for developing communicable diseases. Infective agents such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, and prions are capable of causing disease in healthcare workers exposed to sufficient inocula, especially when usual body defensive barriers are either disrupted or bypassed. In general, infective material is introduced through accidental puncture wounds from needles or other sharps, splashes into mucous membranes, inhalation, or the passage of the infective agent through preexistent wounds. To minimize the risk of infection, adequate barriers should be in place.",

The frequency of hand injuries sustained while performing autopsy procedures can be reduced by several simple practices (Box 3-2). A pair of scissors can adequately substitute for a scalpel during most autopsy procedures, including evisceration. The use of blunt-tipped, rather than pointed, scissors for almost all autopsy tissue dissection is advisable. When dissecting with a sharp implement in one hand, one should apply countertraction on tissues by using a long-handled tissue forceps held in the opposite hand; do not hold tissues with the fingers of the noncutting hand. For high-risk cases or dissections, steel-link gloves or some other scalpel-resistant material can be used. Plastic or Kevlar cut-resistant gloves provide protection while still allowing relative dexterity, and we encourage their use whenever possible.",

Never use a scalpel to make blind cuts. Prepare a sufficient number of scalpels before beginning the autopsy to obviate the need for changing scalpel blades during the procedure. Remove blades only with a special safety scalpel blade remover. Allow only a single individual to use a scalpel at any given time, especially in a limited dissection area. Be mindful of where you rest scalpels and other sharp instru ments; do not put them haphazardly on the dissection table, but rather place them back in clear sight on an instrument table. Never hand off scalpels directly; place the instrument on a flat surface for transfer. Announce in advance any movements that involve repositioning of a sharp instrument.",

For protection against diseases transmissible by aerosols, such as tuberculosis, N95 particulate masks (masks able to filter 1-mm particles in the unloaded state with a filter efficiency of 95%, given flow rates up to 50 liters/ minute) or containment hoods or suits equipped with powered, air-purifying respirators with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters are used. Collecting body cavity fluids with a ladle or bulb syringe generates less aerosol than a hose aspirator connected to a sink faucet. Placing plastic bags over the head of the decedent during removal of the calvarium with a Stryker saw or saws equipped with HEPA filters within the vacuum system can also reduce the amount of aerosolization. Towfighi and colleagues designed a relatively simple tentlike device for reducing aerosal dispersion during brain removal. 24 Practices Specific to Autopsies if a Prion Disorder Is Suspected The infective agent that transmits Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and related prion disorders has been termed a prion because it does not have the morphologic and chemical composition of a virus or other conventional infective agent. Rather, all the evidence indicates that the sole functional component of the prion is an abnormal protease-resistant isoform of a normal brain protein. The normal isoform is designated PrP C and the pathogenic isoform PrP CJD in humans and PrP Sc in animals. Some investigators refer to the pathogenic form as PrP res because of resistance to protease digestion.",
