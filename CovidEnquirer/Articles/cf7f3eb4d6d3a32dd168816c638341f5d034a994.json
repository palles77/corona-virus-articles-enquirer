However, NHBE cells are expensive, difficult to culture, and vary with the source patient. An alternate approach is to use a continuous cell line that has features of bronchial epithelial cells such as Calu-3, an epithelial cell line derived from human lung adenocarcinoma, as an in vitro model of respiratory virus infection. The results show that Calu-3 fully polarize when grown on permeable supports as liquid-covered cultures. Polarized Calu-3 are susceptible to RSV infection and release infectious virus primarily from the apical surface, consistent with studies in NHBE cells. The data demonstrate that polarized Calu-3 may serve as a useful in vitro model to study host responses to RSV infection.",

            "text": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the major cause of lower respiratory tract illness in infants and children worldwide, and infection can also result in serious disease in elderly and immunecompromised patients (Falsey et al., 1995; Hall et al., 1991; Panitch, 2001; Shay et al., 1999) . RSV enters the respiratory tract primarily through fomite or hand-to-nasal epithelium transmission following contact with infectious secretions (Hall and Douglas, 1981; Hall et al., 1980) . Infection is usually limited to the upper respiratory tract, and progression into the lower respiratory tract can result in serious complications of infection, including hospitalization for pneumonia and bronchiolitis. In humans, similar to other paramyxoviruses, RSV infection and replication primarily occurs in ciliated airway epithelial cells (Wright et al., 1997) . As infection progresses, perivascular and peribronchiolar mononuclear cell infiltration is followed by necrosis of the airway epithelium (Aherne et al., 1970; Downham et al., 1975; Ferris et al., 1973) . The mechanisms of cellular responses to RSV infection have been studied extensively in vitro in a variety of immortalized epithelial cell lines grown in monolayer cultures, including but not limited to Vero, Hep-2, A549, and \u0b1d The findings and conclusions in this report are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily represent the views of CDC.",

One ex vivo model, differentiated, polarized cell cultures of primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE), has provided some insights into the mechanism of RSV infection and the cellular response to infection. This model system more closely mimics the airway epithelium structure than monolayer-cultured cells, and likely provides a better in vitro model of RSV infection and the associated cellular responses. In NHBE cells, RSV primarily infects ciliated lumenal columnar cells, and infectious virus is released primarily from the apical surface of NHBE (Zhang et al., 2002) . These data from the polarized, differentiated NHBE model demonstrate the insights that can be gained using cell systems that more closely mimic the airway epithelium. However, NHBE cell systems are time-and labor-intense, costly to maintain, and require access to primary lung tissue samples. Additionally they require substantial expertise in isolating and culturing epithelial cells from the lung tissue, and significant amount of time to first polarize and then differentiate at an air-liquid interface.",

Calu-3 cells were evaluated in liquid-covered culture (LCC), in which they are primarily non-ciliated (Grainger et al., 2006) . The polarization of Calu-3 in LCC is dependent on several factors including growth medium, cell density and trans-well membrane pore size and composition. For these studies, Calu-3 were seeded at a density of 6.0 \u00d7 10 5 cells/cm 2 onto polyester trans-well inserts (0.33 cm) with 3 pores (Corning) in Eagles Modified Essential Medium (EMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (EMEM-10% FBS, complete medium), and polarization was demonstrated by trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) development and by a passive sodium fluorescein equilibration assay. Following seeding into trans-well culture, the development of TEER by Calu-3 cultures was monitored using an epithelial voltohmmeter (World Precision Instruments). The resistance of Calu-3 Fig. 2 . Directional release of RSV from polarized Calu-3. Apical and basolateral compartment media of trans-well cultured Calu-3 was replaced every 3-4 days. Resistance development was confirmed by a passive sodium fluorescein equilibration assay as previously described (A, (Geys et al., 2006 (Geys et al., , 2007 ), and is representative of 3 independent experiments. Resistance development of Calu-3 infected with RSV-A2 (MOI = 1) at the apical surface (B), and apical (C) and basolateral (D) release of infectious virus were monitored for 6 weeks post-infection. For resistance development, each value represents the median \u00b1 SEM measurements from 3 individual wells (3 measurements/insert) and is presented as cm 2 . The amount of infectious virus released from the apical (C) and basolateral (D) media of Calu-3 infected at gradually increased after seeding into trans-wells, and peaked between 1500 and 2100 cm 2 by 21 days post-seeding (data not shown). Calu-3 polarization was confirmed by measuring the passive diffusion of sodium fluorescein through the cell monolayer as previously described (Geys et al., 2006 (Geys et al., , 2007 . Briefly, polarized cells were washed with non-fluorescent buffer, and sodium fluorescein (1 mg/ml) was added to the apical compartment and non-fluorescent buffer to the basolateral compartment of cells. After an hour incubation, the amount of dye that diffused into the basolateral compartment was determined by spectrophotometric analysis of the basolateral sample compared to a sodium fluorescein standard curve. Polarized Calu-3 cultures do not allow equilibration of sodium fluorescein between apical and basolateral compartments. As the measurable resistance of polarized cells increased, the percent of sodium fluorescein that diffused into the basolateral compartment declined from 25% of the initial amount of dye added to the apical compartment when cells were non-polarized, to less than 1% when TEER was \u22651200 cm 2 ( Fig. 2A) . Calu-3 were considered to be completely polarized once the TEER was \u22651200 cm 2 and the amount of sodium fluorescein that diffused into the basolateral compartment was less than 1% of the initial amount in the apical compartment, the threshold of polarization (Geys et al., 2006 (Geys et al., , 2007 .",

Apical infections were performed by overlaying virus on the apical surface of polarized cells for 2 h at 37 \u2022 C. For basolateral surface infections, trans-well inserts were inverted and virus was applied directly to the basolateral surface and incubated in similar conditions. For both infections, inoculum was removed after incubation, wells that were infected at the basolateral surface were re-inverted into their original locations, and growth medium was added to all wells. At the indicated times post-infection, TEER was measured, apical and basolateral media were collected, and virus was quantitated by standard plaque assay on Vero cell monolayers as previously described (Sullender, 1995) . There was little variability in the TEER of Calu-3 prior to apical infection (data not shown), but greater variability between individual trans-wells in the TEER of RSV-A2 -infected and mock-infected Calu-3 following infection (Fig. 2B ). This decline in the stability of TEER measurements was observed in both mock-and RSV-A2 -infected Calu-3, and occurred following infection at either the apical (Fig. 2B ) or basolateral (data not shown) surface. The fluctuations in resistance observed following infection may in part be due to a disruption in the polarized state of cells caused by the infection process. Despite resistance fluctuations following RSV infection, the overall TEER of polarized Calu-3 was not significantly decreased compared to mock-infected cells for at least 6 weeks post-infection, suggesting that apical or basolateral RSV infection of polarized Calu-3 does not significantly alter tight junction formation. These observations are consistent with RSV-infection in Calu-3 monolayer cultures (Fig. 1B) , and with RSV infection of polarized, differentiated NHBE (Zhang et al., 2002) .",

The lower limit of detection for the plaque assays is indicated with a dashed line. Data is representative of 3 independent experiments. Fig. 3 . Anti-RSV-F antibody neutralizes RSV infection of polarized Calu-3. Resistance development of Calu-3 infected at the apical surface (a), and apical (b) and basolateral (c) release of infectious virus from apically-infected Calu-3 (MOI = 1) were monitored for 8 weeks post-infection. Prior to infection, virus was incubated with anti-RSV-F (143-6C) or anti-RSV-N (130-12H) antibody at either 50 g/ml or 5 g/ml for 1 h at 37 \u2022 C.

This persistent RSV infection of polarized Calu-3 is consistent with findings in RSV-infected differentiated NHBE cultures, in which infection was detectable for at least 36 days post-infection (Zhang et al., 2002) . Similar to apical infection, virus release after basolateral infection was detected as early as 4 days post-infection, primarily from the apical sur-face, and was detectable for at least six weeks post-infection (data not shown). After either apical or basolateral infection, virus was detected in the basolateral media of cells only after day 35 pi, corresponding with decreased TEER in infected Calu-3 (Fig. 2D , and data not shown). The detection of virus in the basolateral media may be due to basolateral release of virus or to the mixing of apical and basolateral media in cultures due to decreased polarization. Whether cells were infected at the apical or basolateral surface, greater than 90% of the virus release occurred into the apical compartment, demonstrating directionality in the response of Calu-3 to RSV infection.",

            "text": "The data presented in this report demonstrate that Calu-3 cells are susceptible to RSV infection when cultured as monolayers. Infected cells expressed viral message and viral protein, but did not form obvious cytopathology, and infection did not appear to alter tight junction formation. The lack of obvious cytopathology and limited viral spread following RSV infection of Calu-3 is in contrast to observations made in non-polarized epithelial cell lines used to study RSV infection, including HEp-2, where infection becomes widespread across the monolayer of cells. However, these findings are consistent with those made in cultured NHBE (Zhang et al., 2002) and in human adenoidal epithelial cells (HAE) and human adenoid organ culture (Wright et al., 2005) , in which RSV spread is restricted and few cells appear to be infected with RSV. Consistent with previous studies in polarized MDCK (Roberts et al., 1995) and in differentiated NHBE, polarized Calu-3 released infectious virus primarily from the apical surface, and infection was persistent, detectable for at least 6 weeks post-infection. Persistent RSV infection of cells in culture has been reported for at least 36 days post-infection of NHBE cells (Zhang et al., 2002) . The persistent infection and release of infectious virus for at least 6 weeks post-infection of Calu-3 cells is consistent with observations of persistent infection in ex vivo, cultured NHBE, in animal models of RSV infection, and in some RSV-infected individuals (Couch et al., 1997; Dakhama et al., 1997; Hegele et al., 1994; Isaia et al., 1985; Mejias et al., 2008; Sikkel et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2002) . Finally, consistent with previous reports in other cell lines, RSV infection in Calu-3 could be inhibited by an antibody directed against the attachment protein of RSV. Although Calu-3 do not differentiate, the results indicate that polarized Calu-3 respond to infection similar to polarized, differentiated NHBE cells, and more closely reflect in situ RSV infection than non-polarized epithelial cells. Calu-3 are more readily available than NHBE cells, polarize into stable cultures more rapidly than NHBE cells, and demonstrate restricted, persistent infection and directional viral maturation similar to NHBE cultures, demonstrating that Calu-3 are a useful in vitro model of polarized human lung epithelium-derived cells for studying cellular responses to RSV infection.",
