Comparison of cumulative curves shows that the crowdsourced dataset captured a larger fraction of the cases reported to China CDC before Jan 18, 2020 than in more recent days. The very recent slowing down of cumulative cases apparent in the crowdsourced and China CDC curves is likely a reflection of the delay between disease onset and reporting, estimated at a median of 5 days in our data (range 0-43 days).",

There is a heavy skew of reported 2019-nCoV cases towards older age groups, with a marked deficit of children. This pattern could point at age-related differences in susceptibility to infection, severe outcomes, or behavior. On one hand, a substantial portion of the cases in our database are from travelers, a population which tends to be skewed towards adults (although it does not exclude children). Further, because cases in our dataset were captured by the health system, they are biased towards the more severe spectrum of the disease, especially for cases from Mainland China. Clinical reports have shown that 2019-nCoV severity is associated with the presence of chronic conditions 18, 19 , which are more frequent in older age groups. Nevertheless, we would also expect very young patients to be at risk of severe outcomes and to be reported to the healthcare system, as is seen for other respiratory infections 20 .",

Detailed analysis of one of the early 2019-nCoV clusters suggests that all household members were infected, except for a baby, hinting at true biological differences in the risk of infection driven by age 21 . It has been speculated that prior immunity from infection with related coronaviruses may protect children from SARS infection 22 , which could also play a role for 2019-nCoV. In any case, if the age distribution of cases reported here was to be confirmed and the epidemic were to progress regionally and globally, we would expect a rise in respiratory mortality concentrated among ages 30 and above. This mortality pattern would be markedly different from the profile of 2009 influenza pandemic, where excess mortality was concentrated in those under 65 years 23 .",

Further, these province-level curves include both returning travelers from Wuhan (importations) and locally acquired cases, which contribute to overestimate the potential for local transmission.
