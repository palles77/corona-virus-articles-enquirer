By characterizing a large panel of NZM-specific monoclonal antibodies, we found that, in both patients, the response was polyclonal and targeted different epitopes of the NZM idiotype. The neutralizing activity was acquired through somatic mutations and correlated with a slow dissociation rate, a finding that was supported by structural data. Interestingly, in both patients, the analysis of the CD4 + T cell response, combined with mass spectrometry-based peptidomics, revealed a single immunodominant T cell epitope spanning the FR2-CDR2 region of the NZM light chain. Moreover, a CDR2-modified version of NZM was not recognized by T cells, while retaining binding to \u03b14 integrins. Collectively, our integrated analysis identifies the basis of T-B collaboration that leads to ADA-mediated therapeutic resistance and delineates an approach to design novel deimmunized antibodies for autoimmune disease and cancer treatment.",

However, an explanation for these heterogeneous responses and an integrated characterization of the B and T cell responses to the drug are still missing. In this study, we isolated NZM-specific B and T cell clones from memory cells of two MS patients, who had a hypersensitivity reaction following drug infusion and developed high titers of ADAs (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1 ).",

The antibodies recognized epitopes comprising one to six NZM CDRs, with preferential recognition of the heavy chain CDRs ( Fig. 1 and Extended Data Fig. 1c ).

When compared for their capacity to bind to the 64 NZM CDR swap variants, BAbs and NAbs did not cluster separately (Extended Data Fig. 1c) , indicating that the difference is not related to epitope specificity. However, BAbs and NAbs showed different binding kinetics, as assessed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). In particular, while the association constant (k a ) was comparable, NAbs showed a lower dissociation constant (k d ) that significantly correlated with NZM neutralization ability (Fig. 2c -d and Supplementary Table 2 ). The role of somatic mutations was addressed by comparing the antibodies to the unmutated common ancestors (UCAs). In three out of four BAbs tested, the UCAs had low binding affinity for NZM, which was increased by somatic mutations. In contrast, in two out of three NAbs tested, the UCAs showed already high affinity, but required somatic mutations to gain full neutralizing activity (Fig. 2e) . Collectively, these findings indicate a critical role for somatic mutations in the generation of high-affinity antibodies and highlight the importance of dissociation rate for ADA neutralizing activity.",

With 2.8 \u00c5 resolution, the structures revealed that both antibodies interacted with the same surface area on NZM but engaged the molecule with different orientation (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 3 ). NAA32 and NAA84 recognized 22 and 18 residues of NZM CDRs, respectively, which were mostly located in the heavy chain, a finding consistent with the CDR swap variant specificity (Fig. 3b ). In particular, 14 of these residues were recognized by both antibodies, highlighting potential immunodominant B-cell epitopes on NZM. The contact surface area between NAA32 and NZM was 757\u00c5 2 , although the main interactions occurred at two separate contact points leaving an empty space in between the two interfaces ( Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 2a ). In contrast, the contact surface area between NAA84 and NZM was 617\u00c5 2 , but interactions were much tighter, with deeper residue contacts and contiguous surface complementarity that could account for its slower dissociation rate from NZM ( Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 2a) . Importantly, the NZM surface area engaged by NAA32 and NAA84 overlaps with the area engaged by \u03b14 integrin 13 with 13 shared residues (Fig. 3b ). While both NAA32 and NAA84 antibodies occluded \u03b14 integrin binding site, neither of them provided molecular mimicry of the integrin, which exhibited a different binding orientation (Extended Data Fig. 2b ). Together with the functional data, these structural data suggest that the difference between BAbs and NAbs cannot be explained by the fine epitope specificity, but rather by the strength and the fit of the interaction with NZM.",

To address this hypothesis and to characterize the specificity of the T-cell response, we stimulated CFSE-labeled memory CD4 + T cells from both patients with overlapping peptides covering the variable regions of NZM (Extended Data Fig. 3 ). Cloning of activated CFSE low T cells resulted in the isolation of several NZM-reactive T cell clones (12 from patient A and 54 from patient B) (Fig. 4a ). T cell receptor (TCR) V\u03b2-gene sequencing revealed the presence of 5 and at least 7 distinct T cell clonotypes in patient A and B, respectively ( Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 4 ). Strikingly, most of the T cell clones from both patients recognized two overlapping peptides spanning a region comprising the end of framework region 2 (FR2) and the CDR2 of the NZM light chain (GKAPRLLIHYTSALQPGI, named NZM-LC FR2-CDR2 ) (Fig. 4c ). Of note, T cell recognition of NZM-LC FR2-CDR2 was restricted by HLA-DRB1*14/16 in patient A and by DRB1*07/07 in patient B (Extended Data Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 1 and 4) . Taken together, these findings suggest that, in these patients, a single T cell epitope in the NZM molecule induced an HLA-DR-restricted CD4 + T-cell response that was sufficient to sustain a strong polyclonal B cell response to the NZM idiotype.",

Two of these sets covered the heavy chain FR3 and the FR4-CH1 region, which are in the human germline configuration and therefore are not expected to induce an immune response, a notion consistent with our failure to isolate specific T cell clones. Remarkably, the third set of peptides mapped to the FR2-CDR2 region of the NZM light chain (consensus, TPGKAPRLLIHYTSALQPGIPSR) that spanned the immunodominant NZM-LC FR2-CDR2 epitope (GKAPRLLIHYTSALQPGI) recognized by NZM-reactive T cell clones ( Fig. 4d and Supplementary Table 5 ). The NetMHCIIpan algorithm 14 applied to predict binding to the HLA-DR alleles carried by the two patients identified the same three peptides, as well as several other peptides mapping to CDRs and FRs of NZM.

In addition, this algorithm predicted the binding of the NZM-LC FR2-CDR2 epitope to a reference panel of nine DRB1 and DRB3/4/5 alleles 15,16 (Extended Data Fig.  4c ), suggesting its potential immunodominance also in individuals with a diverse HLA background.

Four NZM variants (var1-4) were retained for experimental testing and validation together with a fifth variant (var5) in which the CDR2 of the light chain was reverted to the germline sequence of the human antibody scaffold (Fig. 4e) . Two variants, var1 and var3, retained binding to \u03b14 integrins, while var2 and var4 showed partial loss of binding that was considerably reduced in the case of var5 (Fig. 4f) . Remarkably, none of the five NZM variants was able to trigger proliferation of T cell clones specific for the naturally presented NZM-LC FR2-CDR2 peptide (Fig. 4g) , a finding consistent with either absence of TCR cross-reactivity or with a reduced binding to class II molecules. Prediction of binding to a reference set of nine DRB1 and DRB3/4/5 alleles 15, 16 , as well as to the DRB1 alleles of both patients, showed a reduction of predicted binding affinity for the var1 and var3 peptides compared to the original NZM peptide ( Fig. 4h and Extended Data Fig.  4d ).

This may explain the high frequency of MS patients producing ADAs to NZM 3,4 and offers the possibility for the deimmunization of the drug for a more safe treatment. Structured-guided mutagenesis and experimental tests suggest that a little amendment of only three residues of the CDR2 of the NZM light chain may be sufficient to remove the immunogenic T cell epitope without interfering with the interaction of NZM with its target.",
