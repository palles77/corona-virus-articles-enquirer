            "text": "Drosophila melanogaster silver gene is the ortholog of the coding gene of mammalian carboxypeptidase D (CPD). The silver gene gives rise to eight different splicing variants of differing length that can contain up to three homologous repeats. Among the protein variants encoded, the short form 1B alias DmCPD1Bs (D. melanogaster CPD variant 1B short) is necessary and sufficient for viability of the fruit fly. It has one single repeat, it is active against standard peptide substrates, and it is localized to the secretory pathway. In this work, the enzyme was found as a monomer in solution and as a homodimer in the crystal structure, which features a protomer with an N-terminal 311-residue catalytic domain of \u03b1/\u03b2-hydrolase fold and a Cterminal 84-residue all-\u03b2 transthyretin-like domain. Overall, DmCPD1Bs conforms to the structure of N/E-type funnelins/M14B metallopeptidases, but it has two unique structural elements potentially involved in regulation of its activity: (i) two contiguous surface cysteines that may become palmitoylated and target the enzyme to membranes, thus providing control through localization, and (ii) a surface hot spot targetable by peptidases that would provide a regulatory mechanism through proteolytic inactivation. Given that the fruit fly possesses orthologs of only two out of the five proteolytically competent N/E-type funnelins found in higher vertebrates, DmCPD1Bs may represent a functional analog of at least one of the missing mammalian CPs.",

            "text": "The silver (svr) gene was discovered in Drosophila melanogaster by Bridges in the early 1920s and it maps near the distal end of chromosome X. [1] [2] [3] [4] Adult fruit flies with mutations in this gene display cuticles that are pale and silvery in color due to reduced melanization, a finding that gave rise to the name of the gene. Silver includes nine exons (1A, 1B, and 2-8), which code for eight different mRNA splicing variants. These result in two short protein variants of 433 (protein svr-PE alias \"1A short\") and 435 [svr-PF alias \"1B short\" and DmCPD1Bs (D. melanogaster carboxypeptidase D variant 1B short)] residues and in six long forms spanning between 1259 and 1439 residues (svr-PB, svr-PC, svr-PD, svr-PG, svr-PH, and svr-PI; see UniProt sequence database entry P42787 and Fig. 1a ). [3] [4] [5] [6] The long variants possess the overall modular structure and sequence features of carboxypeptidase D (CPD), a glycosylated 180-kDa enzyme studied since the middle 1990s in fruit fly, mouse, rat, duck, bovine, chicken, and humans. [7] [8] [9] CPD was localized to the trans-Golgi network, the secretory and reuptake pathways, and transiently on the cell surface. 10 It was hypothesized to remove basic C-terminal residues from proteins and peptides supporting the endoproteolytic action of furin-like serine proprotein convertases of the subtilisin/kexin type. Thus, CPD would contribute to processing of hormones (e.g., adipokinetic hor-mone and bradykinin), growth factors, neurotransmitters, and other bioactive peptides (e.g., dynorphin B-14) that follow the secretory and endocytic pathways. [10] [11] [12] [13] Moreover, it has been suggested that arginine released by CPD from (a) Protein isoforms described for the silver gene as a result of differential splicing (UniProt database entry P42787). Each exon product is shown as a distinct bar with the residues it spans. The N-terminal fragments of 150 (encoded by exon 1A) and 152 (encoded by exon 1B) residues show \u223c 39% sequence identity; the extent of the signal peptide (SP) of the former was estimated with program SignalP at www.expasy.ch. The short fragments of 5 and 10 residues, as well as the C-terminal fragments of 22 and 55, are unrelated to any other sequence of the protein. The extent of the transmembrane region (TM) is according to the UniProt entry. Isoform 7 alias svr-PF, 1B short, herein DmCPD1Bs, spans 435 residues, of which 27-420 correspond to the first funnelin + TLD repeat studied herein. The flanking peptides protrude from the surface and are unstructured. The last residue encoded by exon 1B is Gln152. See also Ref. 5. (b) Full-length amino acid sequence of DmCPD1Bs in single-letter code. The 25-residue signal peptide is underlined, the residues involved in zinc coordination are labeled with full circles, and the two glycosylation sites are indicated by arrows. The cysteine pairing observed in the structure is Cys156-Cys309, Cys236-Cys237, and Cys268-Cys308. The sequential numbering employed throughout the text and the regular secondarystructure elements are shown above each sequence line. The TLD is hallmarked by a light gray background. The segment of the regulatory loop, which is disordered in the structure, is shown in boldface and the experimentally verified serine protease cleavage sites are framed. (c) Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE analysis of the mature protein (residues Tyr26-Phe435) reveals two main bands at \u223c 52-58 kDa, which indicates heterogeneity in the glycosylation pattern. Incubation with trypsin produced a single cleavage within the regulatory loop at Arg190 and gave rise to two cleavage product pairs of \u223c35 and \u223c 23 kDa. The cleavage products are already present in the non-treated enzyme due to incomplete inhibition of the P. pastoris serine protease during protein expression and purification. peptide substrates may stimulate the production of nitric oxide, an important regulator of cellular processes such as neurotransmission, vasodilatation, and tumor progression and survival. 14, 15 CPD belongs to the funnelins, a tribe of zincdependent CPs also referred to as M14 metallopeptidases in MEROPS database. 16, 17 Its hallmark is an \u223c 300-residue \u03b1/\u03b2-hydrolase domain first described for bovine CPA, an A/B-type funnelin. In contrast to the latter, N/E-type funnelins such as CPD possess an additional \u223c 80-residue C-terminal transthyretinlike domain (TLD). 10, 12 In addition to CPD, seven further N/E-type funnelins are found in humans and mice, of which five show enzymatic activity (CPD, CPE, CPM, CPN, and CPZ) and three do not (AEBP1/ACLP, CPX1, and CPX2). 9 In contrast, Drosophila comprises only CPD and CPM orthologs. 5, 6 In vertebrates, CPM binds to cell membranes, but it also circulates in body fluids. It is assumed to participate in the extracellular processing of peptides and thus to have an activity comparable to CPD. [18] [19] [20] CPD is unique in having three funnelin + TLD repeats followed by a transmembrane anchor and a small cytosolic domain, which may be required for intracellular routing and export to nascent secretory vesicles. 9, 10, 16, 21, 22 Only the first two funnelin domains are catalytically competent in mammals and duck. This also happens in Drosophila variants encoded by exon 1B (see Refs. 5 and 6 and Fig. 1a ). When isolated, the two funnelin repeats show different pH optima and specificity. The N-terminal repeat is more active at neutral pH and prefers arginine over lysine at the C-terminus of peptide substrates. In contrast, the second repeat prefers slightly acidic environments (pH 5-6) and excises lysines slightly more efficiently than arginines. 6 Variants encompassing both repeats have broader pH optimum and substrate specificity than singlerepeat variants. This is consistent with the conditions found throughout the secretory pathway, in which pH ranges from 5 to 7. 5, 6 The third funnelin domain of CPD is catalytically incompetent as it lacks critical residues, but it may maintain the overall \u03b1/\u03b2-hydrolase scaffold. 10 In the duck, it was reported to be recognized by the pre-S region of the large envelope protein of hepatitis B virus during infection. 23, 24 This is reminiscent of ACE2, a CP belonging to another structural group, the cowrins, 25 which is the receptor for human SARS coronavirus. 26 In contrast to the long, three-repeat variants, the two Drosophila short forms have only the first repeat, and they are secreted and soluble ( Fig. 1a and b) . Among them, only DmCPD1Bs is catalytically active. 5, 6 Although both short forms are present in the Golgi and may participate in physiological processes, the lack of membrane anchors makes them transient. Moreover, the endocytic vesicles contain only the long forms. 5 In addition, while the membrane anchors can regulate the long forms through localization/compartmentalization, the soluble DmCPD1Bs may be regulated in a different way along the secretory pathway.",

However, although we assayed several purification strategies, the presence of several bands in SDS-PAGE could not be avoided. N-terminal sequencing of these bands revealed that they were cleavage products of the target protein occurring after Leu189 that co-purified with the intact enzyme. Subsequent assays with different broad-spectrum inhibitors against the major classes of endopeptidases revealed that addition of phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) during protein expression significantly limited degradation, giving rise to mainly two major bands (Fig. 1c , left lane). In contrast, inhibitors of metallo-, cysteine, and aspartyl proteinases had no appreciable effect. As a control, intact protein obtained in the presence of PMSF and purified was assayed for susceptibility to proteolysis by commercial trypsin and subtilisin. These experiments revealed similar degradation patterns to those observed during production in the absence of PMSF. In the case of subtilisin, cleavage occurred after Leu189, and for trypsin, cleavage occurred after Arg190 (Fig. 1c , right lane). According to the provisional genome sequence \u2021 (see Ref. 28) , P. pastoris apparently encodes four soluble serine endopeptidases: a putative Kex2 subtilisin-like proprotein convertase, a sequence relative of the mammalian Omi/HtrA2 family of trypsin-like serine proteases, and two putative orthologs of Saccharomyces cerevisiae YscB alias cerevisin (UniProt P09232). The latter enzyme belongs to the subtilisin/kexin family of serine peptidases and preferentially cleaves after arginine, tyrosine, or leucine according to MEROPS data-base. 29 Therefore, either of the cerevisin orthologs in P. pastoris may be responsible for the cleavage after Leu189 observed during recombinant overexpression of DmCPD1Bs.",

Treatment with endoglycosidase F and N-terminal sequencing revealed that they were glycosylation variants of the intact target protein. There are two potential glycosylation sites in the enzyme at Asn133 and Asn269. We tried to reduce heterogeneity by constructing two mutants, N133Q and N269Q. However, the expression yield of both single mutants was dramatically lower than that of the wild type. In addition, both mutants still displayed heterogeneous glycosylation. The double mutant N133Q/N269Q could not be expressed. These results underpinned the relevance of sugars for this protein, in good agreement with the importance of protein glycosylation in the secretory pathway. 30 ",

This is consistent with previous reports on DmCPD1Bs produced in baculovirus, which was also active. 5, 6 Reported values for human CPN evince slightly lower activity for this substrate due to its preference for C-terminal lysine residues (Table 1) . We further produced and purified human CPB to provide a standard for an A/B-type funnelin for comparison and it had about 10-fold higher efficiency. This is in accordance with previous studies, which showed that \"digestive\" funnelins are more efficient CPs than \"regulatory\" forms against small substrates. 9,34 Moreover, intact DmCPD1Bs previously incubated with commercial subtilisin or trypsin (see above) had an \u223c 70% decrease of activity.

            "text": "DmCPD1Bs is inhibited by the small-molecule inhibitor 2-guanidinoethyl-mercaptosuccinic acid (GEMSA) with an apparent inhibition constant (K i ) value of 0.67 \u00b1 0.08 \u03bcM. This fits in the range reported for other funnelins of B-type specificity, which show K i values in the order of millimolar to nanomolar for this inhibitor. 9 In contrast, DmCPD1Bs is not inhibited by protein inhibitors from potato, leech, tick, or mammal, even at micromolar concentrations. These inhibitors display high affinity for A/B-type funnelins, with low nanomolar inhibition constants, but they are inert against N/E-type funnelins. 16, 35 Structure of DmCPD1Bs in complex with GEMSA DmCPD1Bs was crystallized in the presence of GEMSA, which significantly improved the crystal diffraction possibly by providing rigidity, as found in the case of TAFI. 36 Overall, the structure subdivides into an N-terminal catalytic funnelin domain (Ile28-His336) and a C-terminal TLD (Ile337-Glu420). The catalytic domain (CD) has a compact globular shape, which resembles the volume obtained when a cone is extracted from a sphere ( Figs. 2a and b ). There is a funnel-like opening to the left, within which the active-site cleft lies, at the base of the opening. The cleft is rather shallow, which is compatible with the capacity of funnelins to cleave a large variety of substrates, as only few contacts between the enzyme and the C-terminal stretch of a substrate are required to fix the latter to the active site. The DmCPD1Bs CD evinces an \u03b1 8 + 2 /\u03b2 8 topology conforming to an \u03b1/\u03b2-hydrolase or PLEES fold 37,38 ( Fig. 2a and b ). It contains a central doubly wound eight-stranded \u03b2-sheet (\u03b21-\u03b28), which is strongly twisted and spans the molecule vertically bottom to top. The sheet has a mixed parallel/antiparallel topology and a strand connectivity + 1,+ 2, \u2212 1x, \u2212 2x, \u2212 2, + 1x, \u2212 2, and its core consists of four parallel coplanar central strands (\u03b23-\u03b25 and \u03b28). The catalytic site is located at the C-terminal end of these strands, as observed in other funnelins. 16 These four strands are flanked by two parallel strands at the top (\u03b26-\u03b27) and a \u03b2-ribbon (\u03b21-\u03b22) at the bottom ( Fig. 2a and b) . The sheet curvature leads to a concave front side, which shelters helices \u03b15, \u03b16, \u03b18, and \u03b19, as well as the active-site cleft. At the back of the molecule, the convex side of the sheet accommodates the surface N-and C-termini of the molecule, as well as helices \u03b11-\u03b14, \u03b17, \u03b18, and the Cterminal helix \u03b110 of the CD, which runs left to right across the molecule along the convex face of the \u03b2sheet and is bent by \u223c 40\u00b0. The funnel-like access to the active site is shaped by irregular segments of disparate length: the loop connecting strand \u03b23 with helix \u03b12 (L\u03b23\u03b12), L\u03b25\u03b26, L\u03b26\u03b17, L\u03b17\u03b27, and, in particular, the 55-residue segment connecting strand \u03b24 with helix \u03b16 (segment \u03b24\u03b16 hereafter). This element contributes to the lower front of the molecule, shapes the funnel rim, and includes two short helices, \u03b14 and \u03b15. Between five and nine residues are missing in each of the four molecules present in the asymmetric unit within the surface-located L\u03b15\u03b16 (hereafter referred to as \"regulatory loop\") within 16 showing the CD (left) and the TLD (right). The repetitive secondary-structure elements are shown as green arrows (strands \u03b21-\u03b28 in the CD and \u03b29-\u03b215 in the TLD) and coral ribbons (helices \u03b11-\u03b110) and labeled. The catalytic zinc ion is shown as a magenta sphere. The position of the regulatory loop is pinpointed by arrows. (b) Close-up view of (a) displaying the active-site cleft and the funnel-like border that gives access to it. The zinc-binding residues are presented as sticks and labeled, as is the bound GEMSA molecule. (c) Initial \u03c3 A -weighted (2mF obs \u2212 DF calc )-type electron density map centered on the GEMSA-binding site. This map was calculated without the inhibitor molecule (omit map) and is shown contoured at 0.75 \u03c3. The final refined model is superimposed (GEMSA, magenta sticks; DmCPD1Bs, cyan sticks). (d) The quaternary structure of DmCPD1Bs in the crystal is a homodimer. (e) The crystal is made up of such dimers, shown in red, orange, yellow, and cyan. Two dimers are found in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. The unit-cell box is shown for reference. segment \u03b24\u03b16. Two disulfide bonds also contribute to the funnel rim by cross-linking loop L\u03b14\u03b15 with L\u03b28\u03b110 (Cys156-Cys309) and L\u03b17\u03b27 with L\u03b28\u03b110 (Cys268-Cys308). In addition, a conspicuous disulfide bond between neighboring residues is found within L\u03b26\u03b17 (Cys236-Cys237; see Fig. 2a and b) .",

            "text": "The catalytic zinc ion resides at the bottom of the active-site cleft and is coordinated by the N \u03b41 atoms of His101 and His217 and, bidentately, by Glu104 atoms O \u025b2 and O \u025b1 (Fig. 2b) . These residues are provided by L\u03b23\u03b12 and by the end of strand \u03b25. The protein was co-crystallized in the presence of the small-molecule inhibitor GEMSA (Fig. 2c) , which mimics a product complex after substrate cleavage in which the C-terminal residue is still trapped in the S 1\u2032 pocket. The carboxymethylene group of the inhibitor binds the catalytic zinc ion asymmetrically through two carboxylate oxygens, thus giving rise to an overall 6-fold metal coordination. The other carboxylate group of GEMSA is anchored to Arg165 N \u03b72 , Asn174 N \u03b42 , and, bidentately, to Arg175 N \u03b71 and N \u03b72 . The guanidinoethylmercapto group, which imitates an arginine side chain, occupies the S 1\u2032 pocket and is surrounded by Ser224, Gly279, Trp282, Tyr283, Leu285, Gln290, and Thr303. The characteristic specificity for basic residues of N/E-type funnelins is provided in DmCPD1Bs by the side chain of Asp228, which binds one of the terminal guanidine nitrogen atoms of GEMSA. The role of the general acid/base, essential for catalysis in funnelins and other metaldependent peptidases, 16, 39 is fulfilled here by Glu305. The residues that give rise to the characteristic funnelin motif, HXXE + R + NR + H + Y + E, 16 The C-terminal TLD spans 84 residues in DmCPD1Bs and is rod-shaped (Fig. 2a) . Its Nand C-termini are on opposite sides of the rod, which folds into an all-\u03b2 seven-stranded \u03b2-barrel or \u03b2-sandwich, with two layers of three mixed (\u03b21, \u03b24, and \u03b27) and four antiparallel strands (\u03b22, \u03b23, \u03b25, and \u03b26), respectively, which are glued by a hydrophobic core. These strands are arranged as two subsequent Greek-key-like elements related by a 2-fold axis perpendicular to the sandwich surface. 21, 40, 41 This domain has topological similarity with transthyretin, a conserved plasma protein that tends to aggregate, thus giving rise to several forms of amyloidosis. 42 However, transthyretin contains an eighth C-terminal \u03b2-strand that is absent in funnelins. 21 The TLD is laterally attached to the CD and interacts with L\u03b22\u03b23, L\u03b16\u03b25, L\u03b19\u03b28, and L\u03b26\u03b17 of the latter through hydrophobic residues. It also interacts through a (bidentate) salt bridge formed by an aspartate (Asp244) at the beginning of helix \u03b17 of the CD, which is conserved among N/E-type funnelins, and an arginine (Arg376) within the TLD. As in the case of related N/E-type funnelins, the function of TLD is uncertain. It may assist in folding, regulation of enzyme activity, or protein-protein interactions. 16, 21, 22, 35 Hypothetical quaternary arrangement Dynamic light-scattering and cross-linking experiments with glutaraldehyde showed that protein concentrations below 1 mg/mL rendered a monomer, whereas concentrations above 8 mg/mL gave rise to a monomer-dimer equilibrium. Size-exclusion chromatography indicated that the protein is monomeric throughout the concentration range assayed (0.5 to 18 mg/mL, as injected into the FPLC system). In the crystals, which resulted from highly concentrated protein solution (18 mg/mL), two pairs of dimers were found in the asymmetric unit ( Fig. 2d and e) . Inspection of the dimeric interface in the structure reveals that it measures \u223c 950 \u00c5 2 , which is larger than the range described for experimentally validated \"weak\" transient homodimeric proteins (740 \u00b1 140 \u00c5 2 ; Ref. 43) . Such proteins form both monomers and dimers at physiological concentration. In DmCPD1Bs, the dimer is symmetric, so that the same structural segments of each protomer are involved in complex formation: helix \u03b16, strands \u03b21 and \u03b22, and loops L\u03b15\u03b16 and L\u03b22\u03b23 of each CD and loops L\u03b211\u03b212 and L\u03b29\u03b210 of each TLD. Two symmetric bidentate salt bridges (Asp353-Arg85) and a total of nine hydrogen bonds are observed at the interface. In addition, the two activesite clefts are located on opposite surfaces of the dimer; that is, there would be no steric hindrance for substrate binding (Fig. 2d) . However, there is no concluding evidence that the enzyme is a functional dimer in vivo since the protein seems to be monomeric in solution and the dimer could be an artifact of the crystallization process. Moreover, we do not know whether the formation of a dimer could have functional implications. To date, no higher oligomerization states than a monomer have been reported for funnelins. Only CPN is believed to function in vivo as a tetramer comprising two N/Etype funnelin subunits linked to two non-catalytic regulatory domains, 44 but it is not known how these subunits are arranged within the heterotetramer.",

Most changes are conservative or are compensated for by differences in size of the side chains in neighboring positions. However, there is a slight trend towards smaller side chains at positions contributing to the central hydrophobic core of the funnelin domain, which might lower thermal stability: Leu78Ala, Tyr96Leu, Ile97Val, Ile80Ala, Met100Ile, Leu111Val, Leu119Ala, Leu128Val, Met143Cys, and Ser151Ala. In addition, the presence of a histidine replacing an asparagine at position 121 would entail a minor rearrangement of the N-terminal stretch up to Phe34. In turn, the conservation of the N-glycoslyation site motif around Asn133 (Asn-Leu-Thr in exon 1A instead of Asn-Ser-Thr in exon 1B) suggests that the asparagine is also attached to a sugar moiety. However, the presence of a glutamine instead of a glycine at position 129 may entail a rotation of the sugar moiety around the linking bond, N \u03b42 -C1, which would provide space for the glutamine side chain. In addition, only a four-residue insertion is found within L\u03b22\u03b23, which should not disturb the interaction of the CD with the TLD (see above) due to the maintenance of leucine residues at positions 89 and 90.",

Although glutamine is a rare zinc ligand in proteins, 45, 46 in the case of funnelins, it may lead to metal-containing but catalytically impaired or even inert zinc sites, as reported for zinc-ligand mutants of human glyoxalase I. 47 A glutamine at the position equivalent to residue 101 in DmCPD1Bs is also found in a series of (putative) proteins from related Drosophila species, namely, D. ananassae (UniProt B3N0D7), D. willistoni (B4NPC2), D. mojavensis (B4L2T3), D. sechellia (B4IEW7), D. grimshawi (B4JX73), D. erecta (B3NWB3), and D. virilis (B4M2C3). These entries span between 1302 and 1495 residues and could represent three-repeat orthologs of the silver gene product, also encoded by an exon that gives rise to a non-functional funnelin domain. In addition to fruit fly species, a glutamine was found in a potential three-repeat ortholog of the starlet sea anemone Nematostella vectensis (A7S4K6). In all these cases, it remains to be ascertained whether the glutamine-containing funnelin-like domains are functional, in particular taking into account that a recent report has shown that the third CPD domain greatly contributes to survival of transgenic fruit flies. 13 The six long constructs all have identical sequences for the putative second and third repeats, the transmembrane helix, and the first 51 residues of the cytosolic domain (Fig. 1a) . This means that they all have the second catalytically competent and the third silent repeats. They differ only in the very last segments of the cytosolic domains: svr-PB stops after the common stretch; svr-PC and svr-PD have additional 22 residues; and svr-PG, svr-PH, and svr-PI have a further 55 residues, which are unrelated to the others. These differences allow differential trafficking of the protein between the trans-Golgi network and the cell surface for the six membraneanchored forms. 5, 6 Comparison with duck CPD domain II DmCPD1Bs shows 40% sequence identity with the second repeat of the duck ortholog, which is the only other CPD structure reported. 6, 21, 48 This sequence similarity redounds to close structural similarity, as reflected by an rmsd of 0.97 \u00c5 for the 368 C \u03b1 atoms deviating less than 3 \u00c5 (see Fig. 3a ). Significant deviations are found, however, within L\u03b22\u03b23, L\u03b26\u03b17, L\u03b17\u03b27, and the regulatory loop, L\u03b15\u03b16 (Fig. 3b) . These loops contribute to shaping the funnel rim that allows access to the active site (see above). This rim is responsible for interaction with large protein substrates in funnelins. 16 In addition, significant differences are found in two loops of the TLD: L\u03b29\u03b210 and, in particular, L\u03b214\u03b215, which is on the back surface of the molecule. This region might be important for function in N/E-type funnelin TLDs (see above) and structural differences might lead to disparate binding partners in duck CPD domain II and DmCPD1Bs. Overall, the most noteworthy difference is found in the regulatory loop, which is partially undefined in DmCPD1Bs (see above). As the protein found in the crystals is intact, this flexibility does not arise from cleavage but from intrinsic disorder, which, in turn, might have functional implications (see below).",

Hence, the presence of eight splicing variants of CPD, which give rise to both single-repeat soluble and two-and three-repeat membrane-anchored forms, may be conceived as a strategy to compensate for this shortage. 5 This is reminiscent of the finding that only two matrix metalloproteinase paralogs are found in the fruit fly, while 23 have been described in humans. 52 Of the five active N/Etype funnelins in mammals, CPN is secreted into plasma and forms a dimer of heterodimers. CPM is membrane-anchored and functions extracellularly. CPZ is partially targeted to the extracellular matrix and has a frizzled-like cysteine-rich domain that may make it a Wnt-binding protein. 22 DmCPD1Bs could have a homologous function to CPE, which is likewise a single-repeat funnelin and is found in secretory vesicles. 22 The fruit fly enzyme is active and cleaves synthetic substrates with similar efficiency to human CPE, although the former has a different pH optimum. 6 DmCPD1Bs could function as a CPE-like enzyme in mildly acidic regions of the secretory pathway such as the trans-Golgi network. However, further studies are required to validate this hypothesis. Finally, the structure of DmCPD1Bs conforms to the overall fold of N/E-type funnelins, as may be the case for CPE, but evinces two unique features that may correlate with its regulation: (i) two contiguous surface-located cysteines that may become palmitoylated, thus targeting the enzyme to membranes, and (ii) a surface hot spot for proteolytic inactivation. In this way, DmCPD1Bs could participate in Drosophila development through proteolytic processing of substrates previously targeted by furin-like proprotein convertases and would itself be inactivated at later stages by limited proteolysis.",

            "text": "A clone encoding protein svr-PB of Drosophila was kindly provided by Dr. Lloyd D. Fricker (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York) and was used as template to generate a PCR-construct encoding DmCPD1Bs without the signal peptide, that is, encompassing amino acids Tyr26 to Phe435 (UniProt P42787, isoform 7). This construct was cloned into the pPICZ\u03b1A vector with a C-terminal His 6 -tag, and transformed into P. pastoris strain KM71H following the manufacturer's instructions (EasySelect Pichia Expression Kit, Invitrogen). Selected transformant colonies were used to inoculate 1-L shake-flask cultures, which were grown at 28\u00b0C for 36 h in buffered glycerol-complex medium until OD 600 (optical density at 600 nm) reached 20-30. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 3000g, gently resuspended in 100 mL fresh BMMY medium (buffered glycerol-complex medium supplemented with 1% of methanol instead of 1% of glycerol), and cultured at 28\u00b0C for another 24 h for protein expression. PMSF (0.3 mM) was added to the culture every 3-4 h to prevent cleavage of the recombinant protein. For protein purification, the culture supernatant was equilibrated with 30% ammonium sulfate, bound to a hydrophobic chromatography column (butyl-Toyopearl 650 M, Tosoh Bioscience) connected to an \u00c4KTA Purifier system (GE Healthcare), and eluted with a decreasing gradient of ammonium sulfate. The eluted sample was subsequently dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and purified by anionexchange chromatography (TSK-DEAE 5PW, Tosoh Bioscience) by using a linear gradient of 0.4 M ammonium acetate (0 to 30%). DmCPD1Bs was then loaded onto a HiLoad Superdex 75 26/60 column (GE Healthcare) previously equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl and 250 mM NaCl, pH 7.5. Eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the purest samples containing the active enzyme were pooled. The protein was bufferexchanged to 10 mM Tris-HCl and 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.5, and concentrated by using an Amicon Centricon centrifugal device (10-kDa cutoff, Millipore). The typical final yield was \u223c 0.3 mg of protein per liter of growth medium. Western blot using an anti-His monoclonal antibody (GE Healthcare) showed that this protein lacked the C-terminal His 6 -tag, possibly due to autolysis during production/purification, as described for other funnelins. 53, 54 Point mutants N133Q, N269Q, and N133Q/N269Q were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis by using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) and produced and purified in the same way as the wild-type protein. Human pancreatic procarboxypeptidase B was overexpressed and purified as described for DmCPD1Bs but without addition of PMSF. The enzyme was activated by controlled trypsin digestion as previously described. 55 ",

(c) Superimposition of the C \u03b1 traces of DmCPD1Bs (orange), duck CDP domain II (PDB 1QMU; cyan 21,48 ), human CPM (PDB 1UWY; green 40 ), and human CPN (PDB 2NSM; red 41 ) corresponding to segments equivalent to \u03b15, L\u03b15\u03b16, and \u03b16 of the fruit fly enzyme. Orientation as in (a). The arrows point to the residues that flank the flexible region of the regulatory loop in DmCPD1Bs: up to nine residues are missing in each of the protomers.",
