Pre-incubation of isolated feline peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) in vitro with either 104 or 103 International Units (U) of rHuIFN-o~ for 24 h significantly suppressed (P < 0.001 and 0.01, respectively) blastogenic responses to the phytomitogens concanavalin A (Con A) and pokeweed mitogen (PWM). Lower doses of IFN (range, 10-10 -3 U/ml) neither suppressed nor enhanced mitogenesis. In the absence of phytomitogens, incubation of PBL with 104-102 U (P < 0.001 ) or 10 U (P< 0.05) of rHuIFN-o~/ml resulted in a significant decrease in incorporation of [methyl-3H] thymidine into newly synthesized cellular DNA. Cultures of PBL exposed continuously for 4 days to rHuIFN-o~ doses of 104 U/ml or less did not demonstrate specific reductions in cell viability, indicating that the observed antiproliferative actions of IFN apparently were independent of any direct cytotoxic effects.",

            "text": "To investigate the dose-response effects of rHuIFN-~ in vivo on lymphocyte blastogenesis, individual groups of cats were evaluated on 3 consecutive days before and then 24 h after each cat was inoculated intramuscularly with either a high dose ( 106 U/kg), moderate dose ( 104 U/kg), or a relatively low dose ( l0 s U/kg) of rHuIFN-ol. Cats inoculated with 108 U of rHuIFN-~fkg had significantly reduced (P = 0.037 ) blastogenic responses to Con a at 24 h postinoculation compared to preinoculation values; mean PWM responses were also decreased, but this effect was not statistically significant. In contrast, inoculation of cats with either 104 or 102 U of rHuIFN-o~/kg significantly enhanced (P--0.05 or 0.008, respectively) Con A-induced blastogenesis and had no discernible effect on PWM responses. These findings suggest that very high doses of rHuIFN-o! given parenterally may be associated with suppression of certain T-cell responses in cats; conversely, much lower doses may be immunoenhancing. INTRODUCTION Interferons (IFN) are a group of cellular proteins that inhibit viral replication, modulate immune responses, inhibit normal cellular division and have antitumor activity (Borden and Ball, 1981 ) . There are several classes of IFN ( a, fl and y) which differ on the basis of their antigenic, biological and physic ochemical properties (Mannering and Deloria, 1986) . Because IFN (particularly human IFN-c~ ) has antiviral and immunomodulatory activities that cross species lines (Pallikoff et al., 1962; Desmyter et al., 1968; Gresser et al., 1974; Krakowka et al., 1988) and because recombinant DNA-produced human IFN is now available in relatively large quantity, the use of human IFN in veterinary medicine has increased. Human IFN-c~ has been used clinically in cattle afflicted with respiratory diseases (Roney et al., 1985; Cummins and Hutcheson, 1986) , in cats infected with either feline leukemia virus (FeLV) or feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) , and in dogs infected with canine parvovirus (Dr. J. Cummins, unpublished data, 1986) . Dosages of IFN used clinically in domestic animals have been empirical and extrapolated largely from studies in persons or mice using interferon preparations that can differ in purity and potency. Unfortunately, studies of the immunological effects of homologous or heterologous IFN in domestic animals have been lacking; the effects of human IFN-c~ in vitro on canine immune responses, however, have recently been reported (Krakowka et al., 1988) .",

The effects of heterologous IFNs on feline immune responses in general are not known. Resistance to diseases such as FIP is associated with effective cell-mediated immunity (CMI) (Pedersen and Floyd, 1985; ; cats infected with other viruses like FeLV may have severely impaired T-cell responses (Rojko and Olsen, 1984 ) . Obviously, an understanding of the relationship between IFN dosage and modulation of CMI is necessary prior to recommending IFN as treatment for viral diseases where stimulation of CMI is required. Mitogen-induced lymphocyte blastogenesis, which is a widely used in vitro assay for evaluation of CMI (Oppenheim and Schechter, 1976) , has been used previously in cats to assess alterations in CMI induced by immunomodulating agents such as cyclosporin (Gregory et al., 1987 ) . In the studies reported here, the effects of doses of human IFN-c~ in vitro and in vivo on lymphocyte blastogenesis in normal cats was investigated.",

Overall, it appears that IFN can either stimulate or suppress various arms of the immune response, depending on the timing of administration and dosage (Epstein, 1977) . IFN in general seems to inhibit immunologic responses when given prior to an immunogen but enhances responses if given some days later (White and Fenner, 1986) . Moreover, high doses of IFN can produce opposite effects or annul the responses obtained with much lower doses. For example, very low doses of IFN-c~ in vitro or in vivo may stimulate development of antibody-forming spleen cells in mice, whereas high doses are immunosuppressive (Braun and Levy, 1972; Epstein, 1977) . The addition of low doses of IFN (10 or 100 units/ml) in the primary mixed lymphocyte reaction increases the cytotoxic response in mice severalfold, but larger doses (104 units/ml ) depress the response (Fradelizi and Gresser, 1982 ) . Similarly, low doses of IFN can enhance lymphocyte blastogenesis in mice or persons, whereas large doses are suppressive (Miorner et al., 1978; Taylor-Papadimitriou, 1980) . Depending on the timing of administration, extremely low doses of IFN-~, fl (2 \u00d7 10-lO U) in mice significantly increase the number of antibody-secreting cells in spleen and strongly stimulate cytotoxic activities of allospecific T-cells (Daurat et al., 1988) .",

The rHuIFN-~ also directly inhibited the in vitro incorporation of [methyl-3H ]thymidine into newly synthesized cellular DNA of unstimulated PBL and at much lower IFN concentrations than those required to suppress mitogen-induced blastogenesis. The inhibitory effects of various types of IFN on DNA synthesis and lymphocyte blastogenesis after mitogenic stimulation have been described previously in different species, including mice, cattle, and persons (Lindahl-Magnusson et al., 1972; Blomgren et al., 1974; Bielefeldt-Ohman and Babiuk, 1986; Kim et al., 1988; Roth and Frank, 1989 ). IFN has also been shown to directly inhibit thymidine incorporation into the DNA of normal cells, including both lymphoid and epithelial cells, in the absence of mitogenic stimulation (Brouty-Boye and Tovey, 1978; Stadler et al., 1986; Roth and Frank, 1989) . Although the suppressive mechanism (s) associated with rHuIFN-c~ on DNA synthesis and lymphocyte blastogenesis were not investigated in our study, it is possible that high doses of IFN in vitro enhanced lectin-binding on lymphocytes and stimulated suppressor cell activities. IFN can markedly enhance the binding of lectins to lymphocyte membranes (Miorner et al., 1978) , and suppressor cells are activated by high doses of mitogen, particularly Con A (Piguet et al., 1976) .",

Significant decreases in blastogenic responses to T-cell mitogens (Con A) in particular were observed after parenteral administration of high-dose rHuIFN-a. Although responses to PWM (which acts both as a B-and T-cell mitogen) (Heegaard and Muller, 1988) were diminished, this effect was not statistically significant, suggesting that T-cell responses perhaps were somewhat more sensitive to the suppressive actions of high doses of IFN in vivo. Curiously, lower parenteral doses of rHuIFN-a (104-102 U/kg) significantly enhanced the blastogenic responses of PBL after stimulation with T-cell mitogens (this phenomenon, however, was not observed when low doses of IFN were incubated in vitro with PBL). An inverse relationship between IFN dose and lymphocyte proliferative responses similar to that which we observed in cats has been documented previously in vitro and in vivo in mice and persons (Miorner et al., 1978; Taylor-Papadimitriou, 1980; Kim, 1988) . Seemingly, a mechanism associated with this phenomenon may have been IFNinduced activation of suppressor cells. Bielefeldt-Ohmann and Babiuk (1986) reported that in vitro treatment of bovine PBL with recombinant bovine IFNgamma (rBoIFN-7) induced suppressor cells which may have competed with interleukin (IL)-2; moreover, the suppression in lymphocyte blastogenesis after in vivo administration of high doses of rBoIFN-7 was found to be reversible by addition of human IL-2 to the lymphocyte cultures. Lower amounts of IFN, however, may actually enhance the cellular immune response by selectively blocking suppressor pathways (Knop et al., 1984) . In support of this theory, Daurat et al. (1988) demonstrated enhanced cytotoxic activities of allospecific T-cells and enhanced cytotoxic responses of NK cells in mice inoculated several times with IFN-a, fl at dosages as low as 2.0 or 2 \u00d7 10-lo U. The inverse dose-response effects of IFN, particularly its biologic activity at very low pharmacologic doses, has suggested a predominantly hormone-like action of IFN as a homeostatic regulator of immune functions (Daurat et al., 1988) .",
