            "text": "Objective: To evaluate the in vitro activities of the ethyl acetate (EA) fraction of Houttuynia cordata (H. cordata) Thunb. (Saururaceae) and three of its constituent flavonoids (quercetin, quercitrin and rutin) against murine coronavirus and dengue virus (DENV). Methods: The antiviral activities of various concentrations of the EA fraction of H. cordata and flavonoids were assessed using virus neutralization tests against mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and DENV type 2 (DENV-2). Cinanserin hydrochloride was also tested against MHV. The EA fraction of H. cordata was tested for acute oral toxicity in C57BL/6 mice. Results: The EA fraction of H. cordata inhibited viral infectivity up to 6 d. Cinanserin hydrochloride was able to inhibit MHV for only 2 d. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 ) of the EA fraction of H. cordata added before the viral adsorption stage were 0.98 mg/mL for MHV and 7.50 mg/mL for DENV-2 with absence of cytotoxicity. The mice fed with the EA fraction up to 2 000 mg/kg did not induce any signs of acute toxicity, with normal histological features of major organs. Certain flavonoids exhibited comparatively weaker antiviral activity, notably quercetin which could inhibit both MHV and DENV-2. This was followed by quercitrin which could inhibit DENV-2 but not MHV, whereas rutin did not exert any inhibitory effect on either virus. When quercetin was combined with quercitrin, enhancement of anti-DENV-2 activity and reduced cytotoxicity were observed. However, the synergistic efficacy of the flavonoid combination was still less than that of the EA fraction. Conclusions: The compounds in H. cordata contribute to the superior antiviral efficacy of the EA fraction which lacked cytotoxicity in vitro and acute toxicity in vivo. H. cordata has much potential for the development of antiviral agents against coronavirus and dengue infections.",

Although the disease disappeared in mid-2003, its re-emergence cannot be excluded since SARS-like coronaviruses are zoonotic and exist in animal reservoirs (e.g., bats, raccoon dogs and palm civets), thus posing a potential risk for future epidemics [1] [2] [3] . SARS coronavirus is a large, enveloped, single-strand, positive-sense RNA virus. The viral genome is about 30 kbp, containing open reading frames that encode the polymerases required for viral RNA synthesis, while the remaining open reading frames encode structural proteins (i.e., spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid) and accessory proteins.",

There are four antigenically-related but distinct DENV serotypes, such that infection with one serotype does not confer life-long immunity against the other serotypes. DENV infection causes dengue fever, and occasionally the more serious conditions of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome [4] . Antibodydependent enhancement is thought to play a central role in dengue pathogenesis, with the risk of developing dengue hemorrhagic fever and/or dengue shock syndrome being greater in secondary infections with DENV-2 compared to other serotypes [5] . The different manifestations of dengue may also be attributed to DENV variants with varying degrees of virulence [6] , while viral load is also a contributing factor in the development of potentially fatal complications [7] . In addition, being a highly prevalent serotype in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, DENV-2 was selected for this study. Although several dengue candidate vaccines are undergoing clinical trials, there are currently no effective antiviral therapies which are urgently needed to control dengue.",

The anti-DENV-2 activity of H. cordata and its flavonoids were evaluated by plaque reduction neutralization test or PRNT [18, 19] . BHK-21 (baby hamster kidney) fibroblasts were cultured to form cell monolayers in 24-well plates with RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum at 37 C under 5% CO 2 . The test compounds were dissolved in the relevant diluents, and 2-fold serial dilutions were prepared to obtain different concentrations. DENV-2 New Guinea C neutralizing monoclonal antibody 3H5 from Chemicon served as the positive control [20] . Diluent only (at various concentrations), virus, and cell controls were also included by adding the corresponding diluent, virus suspension, and medium without the treatment compounds. Each experiment was performed in duplicate. DENV-2 (90 plaque-forming units or PFU) were incubated for 1 h with various concentrations of each compound together with controls before adding to the cells. The virus-sample mixtures were incubated with the cells at 37 C under 5% CO 2 for another hour with rocking at 15-min intervals before the cells were overlaid with 1% carboxymethylcellulose at 37 C under 5% CO 2 for 6 d. The cells were then fixed with 20% formaldehyde and stained with 1% crystal violet, and the number of plaques was counted. The percentage plaque reduction of the compounds at every dilution was determined as follows: (mean number of plaques in virus control) \u2212 (average number of plaques in sample) \u00d7 100% divided by (mean number of plaques in virus control). The percentage plaque reduction was plotted against various concentrations of the test agents to determine the concentration that causes 50% plaque reduction (IC 50 ).",

Quercitrin appears to show the highest content in fingerprint analysis of H. cordata by HPLC [14] . Among the flavonoids, quercetin also exerts the highest activity on HSV-1, whilst rutin has no effect at all [21] . This characteristic implies that the substitution or addition of free hydroxyl group at certain positions may culminate in a decreased or even completely abolished antiviral effect. Such The EA fraction of H. cordata was tested at concentrations of 166.67 mg/ mL down to 0.08 mg/mL. The upper plot reveals a distinct trend of DENV-2 inhibition, with the IC 50 being 7.5 mg/mL, and complete viral inhibition being achieved at concentrations of 20.83 mg/mL and above. The lower plot shows that no cytotoxicity to BHK-21 cells was evident at various concentrations of the EA fraction tested. structural-activity relationships can lead to the design and development of more active and less toxic flavonoids with appropriate pharmacokinetic properties. Hence, they may pave the way for novel compounds that can match or even exceed the efficacies of existing antiviral drugs [26, 28, 29] . Another interesting aspect was the enhancement of anti-DENV-2 activity of quercetin when combined with quercitrin. Besides augmenting the antiviral effect, this combination also reduced the cytotoxicity relative to that induced by quercetin alone. This characteristic reiterates that combinations of components with greater anti-dengue efficacy but lower toxicity are potentially promising, as discovered previously using combinations of quercetin, chlorogenic acid and/or hyperoside [13] . Indeed, several reports have already documented the synergistic antiviral effects of combinations of individual flavonoids against viral pathogens, such as herpesviruses and fowlpox virus [30, 31] .",

In comparison, however, we observed that the EA fraction and quercetin yielded a longer-lasting antiviral effect of up to 6 d. This finding may be explained by superimposition of the two 3C-like proteinases of MHV and SARS CoV which illustrates that certain amino acid residues residing within 7 \u00c5 of the active site (C145) are different (not shown). Thus, these amino acid disparities may influence recognition and binding of cinanserin hydrochloride to the active site and may also lead to its lower affinity for 3C-like proteinase of MHV than SARS-coronavirus. Competitive binding of cinanserin hydrochloride to the active site of 3C-like proteinase hinders the processing of the precursor polyprotein to generate functional replicase necessary for viral replication [32] [33] [34] .",

Moreover, the EA fraction was also more potent than all the individual compounds tested (including their combination) and did not cause any cytotoxicity to mammalian kidney (BHK) and liver (CCL9.1) cell lines in vitro, nor any acute toxicity or pathology of major murine organs in vivo. This feature reiterates the synergistic effects of the combination of multiple flavonoids and other constituents within H. cordata that confer optimal antiviral activities and minimal toxicity [35] , in keeping with the majority of successful traditional Chinese medicine.",

To complement this study, future in vivo studies are warranted to assess the efficacy of the EA fraction of H. cordata against coronaviruses and dengue viruses using the relevant mouse models [39] . However, further in vivo experiments are necessary to further assess the long-term safety of H. cordata as an antiviral agent in biological systems, including acquiring crucial information on its adsorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination. To address the important issue of batch-to-batch variation, greater efforts should also focus on the quality control of extracts derived from this medicinal plant. Finally, the mechanisms of action of the EA fraction and its constituent flavonoids against viruses at the molecular level need to be further elucidated [40] .",

Although quercitrin showed less activity against DENV-2 with an IC 50 of 467.27 mg/mL, this flavonoid did not cause cytotoxicity to BHK cells. Similar to experiments with MHV, no anti-DENV-2 activity was detected with rutin treatment (without cytotoxicity). Given that quercetin and quercitrin individually exhibited anti-DENV-2 properties, we evaluated whether the combination of both flavonoid compounds (at 1:1 ratio) could exert enhanced DENV-2 inhibition. Indeed, this combination of components achieved a synergistic anti-DENV-2 effect and lower cytotoxicity, with improved corresponding values of IC 50 (158.21 mg/ mL), CC 50 (270.00 mg/mL), and selectivity index (1.71), as shown in",
