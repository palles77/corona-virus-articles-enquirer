Fifteen-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats injected intracerebrally with the HNT strain of measles virus showed already within 1 day after infection an increased number of cells producing IFN-7 in the spleen, cervical lymph nodes axld leptomeninges. These rats recovered after a transient neuronal infection in the brain. Rats infected intracerebrally with vesicular stomatitis virus, on the other hand, all succumbed after 2 days and showed no IFN-~, production in lymphoid cells. Immunohistochemically MHC class I antigen appeared in infected and uninfected cells in the brain during replication of both viruses. A role for the recently discovered nerve fibres with IFN-v-like immunoreactivity, which are normally present in the brain, in the MHC antigen induction is discussed.",

            "text": "Interferon gamma (IFN-,/) is a cytokine which in addition to its antivirai activity can serve as a regulatory factor for the cellular immune response to a virus infection since it can induce major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II antigens, attract T cells and activate macrophages (see Demaeyer and Demaeyer-Grignard, 1988) . In spite of its potential role in the pathogenesis of a virus infection in the brain there have been few experimental studies of IFN-~, during such infections except for the report by Frei et al. (1988) on increased levels of IFN-7 in the cerebrospinal fluid of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus-infected rats. IFN-3, is produced by activated lymphocytes, but recently Ljungdahl et al. (1989) have observed IFN-v-like immunoreactivity (IFNy-LI) in subpopulations of sensory neurons, in perivascular nerve fibres and in certain nerve fibres branching in the central nervous system (CNS) of the rat; a finding corroborated by Kiefer and Kreutzberg (1990) . Neuronal IFN-7-LI can also be induced in regenerating motor neurons after axotomy . The biological effect of this neuronal IFN-7-1ike molecule is not known, although MHC antigens are induced also in and around axotomized motor neurons (Maehlen et al., 1988) . In the present study we describe a marked induction of MHC antigens in the brain of rats infected both with a hamster-neuroadopted strain of measles virus and with vesicular stomatitis virus. Production of lymphocytic IFN-'/ was found after infection with the former virus, but not with the latter, indicating a potential role for the neuronal IFN-7-1ike molecule in regulating MHC levels in the brain.",

Williams (University of Oxford, U.K.). Antibodies were purified from culture supernatants (Holmdahl et al., 1985) . Ascitic fluid containing the Ox18 was purchased from SeraLab (Crawley-Down, U.K.). For detection of measles virus antigen, a mouse monoclonal antibody (16AC5) directed against the nucleoprotein (NP) was used (Norrby et al., 1982) . After washing in PBS, the sections were incubated with rat serum absorbed biotinylated anti-mouse antibodies produced in horse (Vector Lab., Burlingame, CA, U.S.A.) diluted 1 : 30 in 2% rat serum for 60 min at room temperature, washed in PBS and incubated in ABC complex (Vectastain, Vector Lab.) for 60 rain at room temperature.

The immunoreactivity was seen in the cell bodies and in the dendritic trees of these neurons (Fig. 2a) . In the areas around the infected neurons, MHC class ILI was seen diffusely in the neuropil, where it appeared to be present in all cell types. The immunoreactivity appeared to be strongest perivascularly (Fig. 2b) . MHC class II antibodies labelled perivascular macrophage-like cells also in the areas of infection. Neuronal IFN-'~-LI occurred in the infected brains as in controls. In the leptomeninges and in the infected areas of the brain a few lymphocytes of both the CD4 \u00f7 and CD8 \u00f7 phenotype were seen. Seven days p.i. there were larger areas of measles virus-infected neurons in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The MHC class I immunoreactivity was also more widely distributed in the brain. MHC class II immunoreactive macrophage-like cells were seen more widespread in the brain parenchyma. Many CD8 + and some CD4 + cells had infiltrated the infected areas. Fourteen days after infection a number of measles-infected neurons were still present. The MHC class ILI was somewhat reduced as was that for MHC class II. Neuronal IFN-y-LI was present in all infected brains with a similar distribution as in the controls.",

            "text": "In the brain no or only low levels of MHC antigens are normally expressed (cf. Lampson, 1987) , and it has been suggested that this may facilitate the persistence of viral infections in the brain (Oldstone, 1989) , since fragments of viral proteins have to be presented on these molecules to the effector T cells (Doherty, 1985) . Both MHC class I and II antigens can, however, be induced in the nervous system during various inflammatory conditions and virus infections in vivo (Sobel et al., 1984; Craggs and Webster, 1985; Traugott et al., 1985; Vass et al., 1986) and in vitro (Lampson and Fisher, 1984; Wong et al., 1984; Fierz et al., 1985; Massa et al., 1986; Suzumura et al., 1986) . Previously, we have found a brisk appearance of MHC class I antigens during measles infection of the rat brain (Olsson et al., 1987) and a promotion of viral persistence in the brain by depletion of CD8 + T cells . In the present study, we observed that in both VSV-and measles-infected brains the MHC class ILI appeared first in areas of the brain where infected neurons were localized and in these areas the immunoreaction was somewhat accentuated perivascularly. Such immunoreactivity may either be the result of MHC antigens circulating in the blood (Singh et al., 1988) and leaking .through an altered blood-brain barrier caused by the virusinduced inflammation, or due to an MHC-inducing factor that either leaks into the brain or is released in situ. IFN-y has been shown to be a most potent inducer of MHC antigens (Skoskiewicz et al., 1985) . It is therefore tempting to suggest that this cytokine is involved also in the virus-induced appearance of MHC in the brain. However, as MHC was expressed with a similar intensity in the VSV-infected animals, which showed no lymphocyte IFN-y production, and in the measles-infected rats, which showed a marked lymphocyte IFN-y production several days before MHC appearance, it is unlikely that the MHC LI is solely induced by IFN-y released from activated lymphocytes. Alternatively, an IFN-y-like molecule might be released from the nerve fibres in the brain, which are labelled with the IFN-T antibody. By quantitative enzyme-linked immunoassay technique we have recently found an increase in the levels of IFN-y-LI in cultured rat sensory neurons prior to MHC class I induction after a paramyxovirus infection (Eneroth et al., 1990) . However, other factors may also be involved in MHC induction, e.g. a combination of measles virus and tumor necrosis factor can induce MHC class II antigen on cultured astrocytes . Virus particles may also directly induce MHC class II antigens in astrocytes in vitro independent of IFN-y mechanisms (Massa et al., 1986; . The mechanisms by which measles virus triggers lymphoid cells to IFN-y production within 24 h after infection, while the more rapidly replicat-ing vesicular stomatitis virus does not, remain to be clarified, as does a role of IFN-T (whether neuronal or lymphocytic) in the pathogenesis of the infection. In addition to inducing MHC antigen expression, IFN-T may act as a T cell homing factor, activate macrophages and have direct antiviral effects (cf. Demaeyer and Demaeyer-Grignard, 1988; Goldberg et al., 1989) , which all may contribute to the recovery of the measles virus infection. Viruses can also disturb immune functions of a host animal, and measles virus is well known to induce an immunosuppression. The mechanisms for this are not clear although a direct effect of the virus on subpopulations of lymphocytes has been suggested (McChesney and Oldstone, 1987) . In view of our finding of an early and marked induction of IFN-T-producing lymphoid cells, a role for this cytokine in inducing immunosuppression during measles should also be considered. The effects of IFN-T on the delayed hypersensitivity have received less attention than those of IFN-a/fl, but it may under certain conditions inhibit local inflammatory reactions (Heremans et al., 1987) and reduce proliferative responses of antigen-specific T cells (Matis et al., 1983; Nurmi McKernan et al., 1988) . In this context it is interesting to note that we found a similar brisk IFN-T induction (within 12 h) in experimental infections with the extracellular parasite Trypanosoma brucei brucei in rats, which is an infection also associated with a marked immunosuppression (Askonas and Bancroft, 1984; Bakhiet et al., 1990) .",
