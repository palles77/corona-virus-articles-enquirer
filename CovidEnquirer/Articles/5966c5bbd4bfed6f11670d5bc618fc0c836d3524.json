Previous studies have encouraged large studies to assess the impact of influenza vaccination on children in terms of specific outcome measurements. 5, 6 Furthermore, multiyear studies are preferred for estimating robust influenza VE over time through a meta-analysis methodology. 7, 8 The Taiwan CDC has successfully coordinated a laboratory-based surveillance network for influenza virus for all ages since 2000 and established the National Immunization Information System (NIIS) for children aged <6 years in 2003. 9 By using the retrospective laboratory-confirmed influenza surveillance data and linking these to individual vaccination records, we were able to rapidly and efficiently demonstrate the influenza VE Previous reports have demonstrated influenza VE using routinely collected laboratory and/or surveillance data and directly pooling results from multiple years to provide the overall VE. [10] [11] [12] In this study, we implemented a fixed-effects and a random-effects meta-analysis of case-control studies to estimate the pooled VE for children aged 6-59 months across the five consecutive influenza seasons, and considered the variation in antigenic match across seasons and epidemics year by year as the heterogeneity between studies. Such effectiveness studies of inactivated influenza vaccine among young children could assist public health sectors in reassessing the current national influenza vaccination strategy for the target groups, especially when vaccine match varies year to year.",

Children were classified as unvaccinated for the given season if they were not vaccinated in that study season or if they had received the first vaccine dose within 14 days before respiratory tract infection. In this study, we did not define the status of partially vaccinated children because many influenza epidemic strains in Taiwan become the vaccine strains 2-3 years later, as shown by hemagglutination sequence comparisons. 9,14 Therefore, children aged 6-59 months were considered immunized if they had received one or more vaccine doses in the current influenza season regardless of previous influenza immunization history.",

VE and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using the formula VE = (1 \u00c0 OR) \u00c2 100%. Stratified VE estimates were calculated according to age (6-23 months or 24-59 months) and adjusted for gender and week of symptom onset. We used both a fixed-effects model with inverse variance method and a random-effects model with DerSimonian-Laird weighting method 17 to run the synthesis results. A forest plot was used to display the estimated overall ORs and separate ORs in the five epidemic seasons according to the two age groups. 18 We used the 'meta' package for the R system for statistical computing to implement the meta-analysis. 19, 20 Annual vaccination rates among control groups were examined using the Cochran-Armitage test for trend in SAS, version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).",

            "text": "Meta-analysis could be appropriate when a group of studies is sufficiently homogeneous in terms of participants, interventions, and outcomes to provide a meaningful summary. 23 The reason we did not simply add up the subjects in each season to summarize the influenza VE across the five seasons of test-negative case-control studies was to consider heterogeneity such as variation in the antigenic match among years, influenza activity year by year, vaccine policy changes over time with expansion of the age groups targeted, and changes in the dominant circulating subtypes of influenza virus, etc. Although statistical heterogeneity between studies was not found in our study, to estimate VE across years using a meta-analysis methodology might be a feasible and applicable approach. Further stratified analysis of influenza type-specific effectiveness was not possible due to the small sample of laboratory-confirmed cases with virus type categories. We estimated VE against laboratory-confirmed influenza infection using the test-negative case-control study design, which is less susceptible to bias due to misclassification of infection and to confounding by health-seeking behavior, relative to traditional case-control or cohort studies. 15 Virological swab tests for influenza as part of routine influenza surveillance to estimate influenza VE more specifically in time and to compare VEs internationally is encouraged and practiced in many countries. 24 Recent studies have suggested that vaccine-induced protection against influenza may decline over time among young children and older adults in the test-negative case-control study design. 25, 26 Nunes et al. raised the issue of the best influenza-negative control group to use in the test-negative study design. 27 They observed that a VE difference existed when choosing a non-influenza virus control group and a pan-negative control group. Further studies should be conducted to clarify such important issues. Another challenge exists in establishing and maintaining the quality of the vaccination register for vaccination programs, especially for annual influenza vaccinations; such a register will provide information for resource allocation, comprehensive evaluation, and a timely response to all vaccine-preventable diseases. 28 Our findings demonstrated a significant pooled VE of 51% (95% CI 23-68%) in 6-23-month-old children over five seasons. Previous reports have shown that influenza vaccines are effective in healthy children against laboratory-confirmed influenza, serologically confirmed influenza, and clinical illness by systematic metaanalysis. 29, 30 A recent study reported by Yang et al. with a study design similar to ours found an influenza VE against medicallyattended influenza illness of 16% for those aged 6-35 months in the 2012/2013 season. 31 Evidence for VE against outcomes other than laboratory-confirmed influenza infection such as preventing emergency department visits and hospitalizations for ILI in children has been evaluated, although more robust evidence is needed in the future. 32 Nevertheless, few of these studies have provided adequate evidence of influenza VE among children younger than 2 years of age, who, without chronic or serious medical conditions, are still at increased risk of hospitalization during the influenza season. 3, 4, [33] [34] [35] Findings regarding the efficacy and effectiveness of inactivated influenza vaccines in children younger than 2 years are inconsistent. 24 Although a smaller reduction in laboratory-confirmed influenza infection was shown in this age group compared to those older than 2 years of age, the clinical relevance and public health implications of routine influenza vaccination for both age groups has been confirmed. 3, 30, 36 Several factors may affect the efficacy and effectiveness of influenza vaccine, including (1) antigenic similarity between the circulating and vaccine types or strains of influenza virus; (2) specificity of the outcome measurement of VE; (3) yearly variability in influenza illness rates; (4) host characteristics (e.g., age and underlying medical conditions) in relation to immune responses; (5) vaccine coverage and herd immunity; and (6) relatively small sample sizes for influenza-positive cases within each stratum evaluated. 7, 30, 33, [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] Annual vaccination rates in children aged 6-23 months appeared to decline over the study period. This might be explained by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks in Taiwan in 2003 and the introduction of the influenza vaccination program in the 2004/2005 season for children aged 6-23 months. Both of these events were an incentive to parents to have their young children vaccinated with the influenza vaccine during the early part of the study.",

This may not be appropriate for infants aged 6-23 months. 45 We speculate that the younger the children were, the less chance they had had to experience the circulating local strains in previous seasons for immune priming before vaccination, which could have led to an underestimation of VE among younger children if they were only partially immunized. Besides, high vaccine coverage (50-70%) in children could possibly have an impact on reducing influenza-related morbidity and mortality, not only among the vaccinated children, but also in other age groups. 30, 37 The challenge of increasing vaccine coverage still exists.",

To resolve this problem, a validation study to confirm the serology indicator of an HAI antibody titer !1:40 after one dose of trivalent influenza vaccine between two age strata might assist in confirming the immunization status in different geographic areas. 46 Third, there might have been selection bias with regard to the vaccination status of subjects who were enrolled for laboratory testing. It is possible that the testing of samples was biased as this was done by the clinicians who provided the influenza shot to the patient. However, in Taiwan, most patients can see the doctor of their choice, therefore, most clinicians would not know the patient's influenza vaccination status. If sampling was done on an informed basis such that the sentinel physician collected fewer swabs from vaccinated ILI patients, a potential biasing of estimates of effectiveness upwards might have occurred. 47 In the test-negative design for estimating influenza VE, effectiveness does not vary by health-seeking behavior with the assumption that the distribution of non-influenza causes of acute respiratory infection does not vary by influenza vaccination status. 15 Therefore, cases and controls in our study probably had similar characteristics with regard to their willingness to seek medical care and their willingness to be swabbed, which could eliminate the uncontrolled confounding between cases and controls. The Viral Surveillance Network did not include all ILI patients (those willing to be swabbed and those not willing to be swabbed), thus it was not possible to determine the characteristics of the children who were swabbed and those who were not. The voluntary enrolment of swabbed participants in our study raises the question of potential selection bias, which might bias the VE estimation and limit the generalizability. 3 Fourth, the impact of repeated seasonal influenza vaccination on vaccine effectiveness against influenza A and B virus has been debated, and further studies are needed to provide more clear evidence. 48, 49 As this was an observational study, residual confounding may still be present despite different statistical models. We plan to investigate this further in the future. 50 In conclusion, our study rapidly and efficiently determined VE across five influenza seasons using data linkage of immunization records and viral surveillance data at the national level. Because the annual burden of influenza illness and vaccine match could influence VE, we combined studies using a case-control design across consecutive influenza seasons using a novel method of meta-analysis. Influenza vaccination provided measurable protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza among children aged 6-23 months, 24-59 months, and the entire range of 6-59 months, despite variation in vaccine match during the 2004/2005 to 2008/ 2009 influenza seasons in Taiwan.",

Vaccine coverage rates among the control groups were close to those in the corresponding population nationwide. The national influenza vaccine coverage available for children aged 6-23 months was 68.9% (260 499/377 933), 66.6% (243 149/365 335), 60.3% (212 605/352 502), and 44.8% (150 675/ 335 972) for seasons 2004/2005 to 2007/2008, respectively, which were estimated through the NIIS database. The national vaccine coverage changed to 48.2% (255 565/530 561) for children aged 6-35 months in the 2008/2009 season when the influenza vaccination program was extended to those aged 24-35 months. Otherwise, influenza was detected in 532 (11.8%) enrollees. Approximately 11.1% (59/532) of those who tested positive and 31.1% (1232/3962) of those who tested negative had been vaccinated. The pooled estimate of VE for children aged 6-59 months during 2004/2005 to 2008/2009 was 62% (95% CI 48-83%) using the meta-analysis method (",
