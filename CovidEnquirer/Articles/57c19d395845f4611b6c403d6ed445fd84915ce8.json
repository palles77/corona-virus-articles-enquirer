Independent of virulence variations they are separated into two different types, type I, the original FCoV, and type II, which is closely related to canine coronavirus (CCV). The prevalence of FCoV types in Austrian cat populations without FIP has been surveyed recently indicating that type I infections predominate. The distribution of FCoV types in cats, which had succumbed to FIP, however, was fairly unknown. PCR assays have been developed amplifying parts of the spike protein gene. Type-specific primer pairs were designed, generating PCR products of different sizes. A total of 94 organ pools of cats with histopathologically verified FIP was tested. A clear differentiation was achieved in 74 cats, 86% of them were type I positive, 7% type II positive, and 7% were positive for both types. These findings demonstrate that in FIP cases FCoV type I predominates, too, nonetheless, in 14% of the cases FCoV type II was detected, suggesting its causative involvement in cases of FIP.",

(1985) showed that an infection with CCV caused seroconversion but no clinical signs in the cats examined, neither was the course of the subsequently experimentally induced FIP disease more severe. In contrast to these findings, McArdle et al. (1992) demonstrated that after infection with CCV the course of FIP disease was more severe, and that CCV induced in some cats similar symptoms as in the dog. Furthermore, one CCV strain caused in a cat clinical symptoms which were not discernible from FIP. After all, the importance of CCV for the cat remains uncertain (Sparkes et al., 1992) .",

The ability of an FCoV strain to propagate in cell culture does not correlate with its virulence in vivo (Mochizuki et al., 1997) . Among the FCoV types I and II, both FIPV and FECV strains are represented. The S-protein gene of type II is closely related to those of TGEV and CCV, showing a similarity of the nucleotide sequence of 91 and 81%, respectively, but of only 46% with the S-protein gene of type I (Motokawa et al., 1995) . Herrewegh et al. (1998) demonstrated that FCoV type II resulted from recombination of FCoV type I with CCV.",

Furthermore-since FCoV types I and II may use different receptors-we wanted to investigate whether the two types are associated with differences in the clinical course of the disease and/or distinct histopathological changes. Finally we intended to get more information about the importance of CCV for the cat. CCV itself may infect the cat, or it may be involved indirectly, regarding the possibility that recombinations between FCoV type I and CCV may happen in the field at any time (Horzinek, 2000) . ",

FCoV type II, the probable recombination between type I and canine coronavirus, was involved in 14% of the FIP cases investigated. It has to be assumed that these recombinations occur in the field and therefore contact with dogs excreting canine coronavirus may play a role in the emergence of new type II FCoV. However, the samples positive for FCoV type II need further investigations with respect to their relationship and even differentiation to CCV. Special interest should also be paid to cats with double infections concerning the role of field infections with CCV and their role in the development of FIP. Finally, no differences in the histopathological changes were found related to the FCoV type detected.",
