DogCV was detected by PCR in fecal samples from 19/168 (11.3%) dogs with diarrhea and 14/204 (6.9%) healthy dogs and in blood from 19/409 (3.3%) of dogs with thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, fever of unknown origin, or past tick bite. Co-infection with other canine pathogens was detected for 13/19 (68%) DogCV-positive dogs with diarrhea. DogCV capsid proteins from different dogs varied by up to 8%. In situ hybridization and transmission electron microscopy detected DogCV in the lymph nodes and spleens of 4 dogs with vascular compromise and histiocytic inflammation. The detection of a circovirus in tissues of dogs expands the known tropism of these viruses to a second mammalian host. Our results indicate that circovirus, alone or in co-infection with other pathogens, might contribute to illness and death in dogs.",

PCV2 is the primary pathogen associated with a spectrum of swine diseases called porcine circovirusassociated diseases that have been described in pigs worldwide. PCV2 infection causes severe economic losses because of increased mortality and reduced production, making it one of the most economically important viruses in the global swine industry. Among lesions that have been attributed to PCV2 infection are pneumonia, enteritis, lymphadenitis, vasculitis, nephritis, and reproductive disease (4) . In cases for which PCV2 is considered causative, immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization (ISH) analyses demonstrate large amounts of PCV2 antigen or nucleic acids in the cytoplasm of macrophages and dendritic cells in the depleted follicles in lymphoid tissues (4, 5) . Naturally occurring porcine circovirus-associated diseases is often accelerated or exacerbated by concurrent viral or bacterial infections, and secondary infections often occur as a result of immunosuppression (6) .",

We used this technique to identify virus sequences in affected tissues from companion animals with diseases of unknown cause. We identified a canine circovirus in the liver of a dog that had necrotizing vasculitis and granulomatous lymphadenitis, both of which are described in PCV2-infected pigs (4) . We named this virus dog circovirus (DogCV) rather than canine circovirus to avoid confusion with the CaCV notation used for canary circovirus (12, 13) , canine calicivirus (14, 15) , and Capsicum chlorosis virus (16) . A closely related variant of DogCV was sequenced independently in canine serum samples and was published recently (17) ; however, no disease association was described with the virus. To determine whether DogCV could be associated with canine vascular disease, we identified additional dogs with vascular and granulomatous lesions and examined the distribution of DogCV by ISH analysis.",

Despite initial supportive therapy at the referring veterinarian, clinical signs worsened; at UC Davis, the dog was treated for hypovolemic shock. Because of suspected disseminated intravascular coagulation and a poor overall prognosis, the owner elected to have the dog euthanized and granted permission for routine necropsy, which was performed at the Anatomic Pathology Service of the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. The clinical and postmortem workups for infectious causes in this case included negative test results for infectious causes of enteric disease, such as canine parvovirus, canine enteric coronavirus, Salmonella spp., canine distemper virus, Campylobacter spp., Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin A gene, Cryptosporidium spp., and Giardia spp. Histologic results showed extensive fibrinoid vascular necrosis, thrombosis, and hemorrhage throughout the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys, as well as granulomatous lymphadentitis of the mesenteric lymph nodes. Special stains of histologic specimens revealed no detectable bacteria or other infectious agents.

Motifs associated with rolling circle replication (FTLNN, TPHLQG, and CSK) and the dNTP binding (GXGKS) were also identified.

The organs affected varied even in this small set of animals, but all dogs had necrotizing vasculitis and hemorrhage, and all but 1 had lymphadenitis and granulomatous disease. Because the tested retrospective animals were chosen to match the sentinel case, our sampling is biased, and the spectrum of diseases associated with this virus might be broader than we detected. Among dogs positive by ISH, disease signs varied, and clinical, gross, and microscopic features in some of the disease syndromes were similar to those associated with PCV2 infection (4, 5) . In particular, porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome shares many of the histologic features seen in DogCV-positive dogs (28, 29) , and PCV2 has been reported to cause necrotizing lymphadenitis, vasculitis, or neurologic disease (4, 30, 31) .

Virus distribution in pigs infected with PCV2 is most consistently within lymphoid tissue, with sporadic reports of virus in other tissues (4, 23, 32, 33) . For example, in pigs with dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome, granulomatous inflammation of the kidneys is commonly reported; however, virus is detected in renal tissue in only a few cases by any method. In our study, DogCV DNA was detected in lymphoid tissues, including Peyer's patches, even for dogs 3 and 4, where no clinical or histologic enteric lesions were detectable. DogCV DNA was also found in small, end-capillary endothelial channels of the intestinal lamina propria and the adrenal cortex; however, confirmation of these cells as endothelial will require further investigation. Two distinct histologic features of PCV2 infection are viral inclusions and multinucleate giant cell formation (34) , neither of which was detected by routine histology in the dogs infected with DogCV. By electron microscopy, however, macrophages within the lymph node contained abundant cytoplasmic viral inclusions composed of dense granular or paracrystalline arranged virus. Affected cells were found in both the sinus and medullary cords of the mesenteric lymph node examined. Ultrastructural inclusions were similar to a subset of cytoplasmic inclusions that have been described in PCV2 infected tissues (35, 36) .",

E) H&E stain of a Peyer's patch in the ileum from dog 1, showing moderate depletion of lymphocytes and an increased population of macrophages within the germinal center and the peripheral base of the follicle. F) ISH of a Peyer's patch in the ileum from dog 1. DogCV DNA is rich within the cytoplasm of abundant cells at the periphery of the follicle, and individual cells are scattered within the germinal center, lymphatic channels, and submucosa.

Although the reticular network was abundantly positive in dog 1(Figure 2, panel H), the common pattern was localization to the centers of lymphoid or Peyer's patch follicles(Figure 2, panels D, F), corresponding to the morphology and distribution of dendritic cells. Rare nuclei of elongate cells (presumed endothelium) lining small vessels of the adrenal cortex or intestinal lamina propria suprajacent to the Peyer's patches were positive in 2 dogs. No nucleic acid was detected by ISH analysis in other tissues, regardless of the character or intensity of the inflammation. None of the 5 control dogs showed DogCV DNA by ISH.",
