It is based on the on-line health IC card system and works at the registration process of primary care practices and emergency departments. Hence, should a disease defined by CDC (Center for disease control) be detected at the registration station, EDICTS responds in real time. Note that EDICTS is a mechanism; it is CDC that determines the policy and activates it. A prototype is designed and implemented on a simulated environment of the Taiwan's national health insurance IC card system. The proposed policy and rules are defined according to the CDC regulations. Timely, sensitive and cost-effective, EDICTS complements the existing successive level of CDC reporting system as a fast-response control channel.",

A report showed that Penghu pilot health IC card experimental system [1] [2] [3] [4] responded quickly and effectively to the contact information about SARS suspects, the clinics they had visited and the patients who were in the same hospitals. The contact information was sent to Taiwan's bureau of national health insurance (TBNHI) and joined with a database to get the lodging and affiliations of those people for CDC to conduct further examination and isolation processes [5] . The efficacy and effectiveness of the Penghu health smart card * Corresponding author. Tel.: +886 6 9264115x3409; fax: +886 6 9264265. system motivated this research, since the mechanism could be further generalized to be an on-line surveillance system to automatically monitor a variety of emerging/notifiable infectious diseases (ENID), such as SARS and avian influenza (bird flu), if health IC cards were nationally distributed. Since timeliness is critical in preventing the spread of ENIDs and quick responses to the (possible) occurrence of ENIDs reduce infections to people and to medical institutions, many countries have their own formal mechanisms and policies for reporting and controlling such diseases. For example a 24 h delay is allowed for a medical institution to voluntarily report a suspect case to CDC in Taiwan medical institutions that a SARS or avian influenza patient contacted or visited. Thus, a mechanism to help to reduce the spread of community infection and to decrease public panic is important. This paper proposes a mechanism, named EDICTS, for emerging/notifiable infectious diseases control, tracking and surveillance, which is based on the on-line national health IC card system. A national health IC card system includes health IC cards, an IDC (IC card data center), which stores all IC cardholders' information, PoPs (point of presence) in each medical institution and a health network that interconnects IDC and all PoPs. Generally a PoP is located at the register station, the first line of all primary care practices and emergency departments. A PoP consists of a smart card reader, a personal computer connected to the health network, and related software such as HIS (healthcare information system) and smart card application programs. It is assumed that each cardholder would show his or her card to a medical staff at the registration and that CDC defines the policies and checking rules for the patterns of emerging/notifiable diseases, which are called edicts, for EDICTS. Once CDC decides to enable EDICTS, CDC informs IDC. Upon receiving edicts from CDC, IDC disseminates them to each PoP via the network. The EDICTS residing in each PoP updates the policy. Then EDICTS at each PoP automatically monitors such clinical cases (suspect case-symptomatic cases only, not confirmed yet) by constantly checking the patterns, entered by medical staff, of patients' visits. EDICTS is active in both sending information to IDC and to alerting the first-line medical staff, if a case should appear.",

The other is the current medical record that is to be stored into the card. In the Taiwanese national healthcare insurance IC (NHI-IC) card system (NHICS), each NHI-IC card carries the six most recent patient visits and medical treatment history. A card reader, associated with a PoP, reads the history data and sends it to EDICTS. EDICTS checks this data with CDC edicts. If there is a match, EDICTS writes a suspect case mark into the card and sends an alarm signal immediately and automatically to the PoP's user interface. Hence clinicians are advised to refer to the suspect case description for further details of the symptoms and signs of ENID. Meanwhile the abnormal case is uploaded to IDC via the network. CDC thus has fast first-hand responses and is to able to set in motion the standard operating procedures. CDC could use the reports from EDICTS to know the contact information of the suspect cases, and therefore control and track the distribution of the ENIDs. Some computerized surveillance schemes have been established to detect the outbreak of ENIDs worldwide. Their goals are to collect information, to identify the causative viral strains, to rapidly assess related morbidity and mortality, to predict the situation, and to redistribute certified information [7] [8] [9] [10] . EDICTS was designed neither to detect nor to predict the outbreak of infectious diseases, though such extension is possible. EDICTS could be regarded as the mechanism to invoke after CDC has analyzed the information and determines that an emerging/notifiable disease outbreak is possible.",

            "text": "A computer-aided ENID surveillance system is essentially a system to help CDC experts make right decisions by gathering information on ENID occurrences and spread, hence to control, track, and surveillance of ENID. In the last decade, substantial investments have been made in surveillance systems for early detection of natural infectious disease clusters and of intentional acts of bioterrorism. Previous studies demonstrate that surveillance is useful in detecting specified communicable diseases. Such systems include the sentinel provider system (USA) [12] , sentinel physician networks (European countries) [13] , influenza surveillance system (Japan) [14] , Australian sentinel practice research network (Australia) [15] , epidemiological surveillance networks (France) [16] , electronic point-of-sale (EPOS) pharmacy (England) [17] , infectious diseases surveillance system (Japan) [18] , ambulatory-care-based syndromic surveillance system (USA) [19] , real-time syndrome surveillance (Canada) [20] , and infectious disease prevention and control system (Germany) [21] . A categorization of computerized ENID surveillance systems by the timeliness of their response is shown in Fig. 1 . Most of these systems set the types of diseases under surveillance, and report the number of diseases covered, the geographical area covered, and the population covered. However, the time delay allowed is from 24 h to a week, except that [18, 20] , and the proposed EDICTS are on-line. There is generally one-way communication, i.e. from medical institutions to CDC, and only EDICTS is real-time and with automatic reporting, while [20] , for example, is done manually and by telephone. The implementation of an \"All-In-One\" Taiwanese NHI-IC card came into effect on 1st July 2003 in metropolitan and local community hospitals. The infrastructure was fully operational on a national scale and the first phase of implementation went into effect at the beginning of 2004. TBNHI constructed IDC to manage and maintain the NHICS database and a full-time bidirectional service network (the TBNHI intranet) for connecting all PoPs to IDC [22] . Moreover, the Taiwanese experience with SARS in 2003 proved that the health IC cards can play an important role in delivering solutions to healthcare providers and patients. The NHI-IC card carries a visually and electronically readable identifier to speed access to patient information. This leads to reductions in paper work, administrative costs and entry errors. The standard operations of using IC cards at the time of registration, at the doctor's side, and in the information infrastructure serve as a sound basis for better, faster delivery in the ENID reporting system. Moreover, the current practice of a surveillance system needs a real-time mechanism for quick spreading epidemic diseases. EDICTS is thus an appropriate mechanism that utilizes the NHICS infrastructure, in accordance with CDC policy, to deliver real-time response to ENID.",

EDICTS should be controlled by CDC, which decides when to enable/disable EDICTS. For increased timeliness, EDICTS should operate on-line, gets the directives from CDC and report to IDC automatically. To be sensible, should EDICTS at the PoP side detects a suspect case, EDICTS sends a message to the user interface to instantly alert the medical professionals, marks the case's information in the NHI-IC card, and then transmits both the case's and medical provider's information to IDC and CDC. To be flexible, EDICTS is designed to be only a mechanism and it is up to CDC to determine the policies and rules, as in [6] . To be cost-effective, EDICTS is designed be operational with the current national health IC card system.

The proposed policy and rules are defined according to the CDC regulations. Major components of the NHICS are NHI-IC cards, PoPs, IDC and a health insurance service network that connects all registered hospitals and healthcare providers. Based on the authors' experiences of the Penghu health IC card project from 1996 to 2003, EDICTS functions well. The advantage of the proposed approach is that the infrastructure of NHICS is already deployed and only software enhancements to PoPs and IDCs are required. The programs on the IC cards need not change, and the HIS requires only minor modification, i.e. to take signals from EDICTS. The key component to be modified is the CS that originally serves as a standard application interface for smart cards. A TBNHI contracted company maintains the CS, and it is upgradeable from the website of TBNHI, via the VPN. The deployment cost of this would be low, since it can be done with the current upgrade/maintenance workflow.",

TBNHI should make the procedures available to all PoPs. (3) CDC and TBNHI should invite experts to convert infectious diseases symptoms to comparative quantitative patterns and define the checking rules into electronic forms, such as XML files and text descriptions. EDICTS-PoP is given the former information to check for in an outpatient's record in his/her HC card before or at the patient's registration process. This checking process should be automatic. (4) If PoP detects a match between the defined patterns and the patient history on the IC card, it should write a mark into a suspect patient's HC card. This is to prevent cross infection to other clinics. (5) Responses to TBNHI are required. The medical staffs would perform standard procedures defined by CDC and TBNHI. PoP responds to IDC and immediately uploads the patient's records to IDC on-line. They should be processed automatically without the medical site's intervention. (6) To be adaptable to different infectious diseases, IDC is able to remotely download the necessary components to PoP via NHI VPN, such as new versions of CS and quantitative symptom patterns for one or more infectious diseases.
