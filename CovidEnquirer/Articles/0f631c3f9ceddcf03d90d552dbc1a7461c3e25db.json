If multiple hits for one sequence passed our filter settings, we selected the one with the best E-value. Based on this approach, we were able to assign a gene name and function to additional 4,844 sequences out of 7,101 CDS without a functional description in the Ensembl annotation for M. lucifugus.

Overall, we aligned 18 BST2-coding sequences with MAFFT (Katoh and Standley, 2013) (v7.402; L-INS-i parameter) and calculated a phylogenetic tree with RAxML (v8.0.25) (Stamatakis, 2014) using 1000 bootstraps, the GTRGAMMA model, and the primate BST2 CDS as outgroups.
