            "text": "real-time data of the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China up until February 5, 2020, within a short period of half a month, the number of confirmed cases and the number of deaths were 24,443 and 493, respectively. The epidemic is progressing rapidly. 2019-nCoV poses new public health challenges in China. 5 In Wuhan, China, the number of local medical staff is insufficient for the demand resulting from the explosive increase in the number of infected patients. Therefore, many medical personnel are needed to devote themselves to the front line of combating the virus. Medical personnel throughout the country are led under the unified leadership of the Chinese government. Although the epidemic in Wuhan is serious, a large number of medical staff rushed to Wuhan to supplement the shortage of manpower in Wuhan hospitals. This is a battle without smoke, the heroes of which are our medical staff. According to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, as of January 30, 2020, Hubei Province opened 11,0 0 0 isolated patient beds, and about 170,0 0 0 healthcare professionals from all kinds of medical institutions are working on the front lines and providing care for patients with fevers, and for suspected or confirmed patients. In this time of emergency, under the unified deployment of the Chinese government, there are 52 medical teams including 6097 medical personnel from the National Health Commission, the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, 29 provinces and cities, as well as the army ( Fig. 1 ) .",
