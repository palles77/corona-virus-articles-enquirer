The requirement for aminopeptidase N (APN) as a receptor for TGEV, but not for PEDV, is well established. In this study, the biological relevance of APN as a receptor for PDCoV was tested by using CRISPR/Cas9 to knockout the APN gene, ANPEP, in pigs. Porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) from ANPEP knockout (KO) pigs showed resistance to PDCoV infection. However, lung fibroblast-like cells, derived from the ANPEP KO PAM cultures, supported PDCoV infection to high levels. The results suggest that APN is a receptor for PDCoV in PAMs but is not necessary for infection of lung-derived fibroblast cells. The infection of the ANPEP KO pigs with PDCoV further confirmed that APN is dispensable as a receptor for PDCoV.",

Coronaviruses are divided into four genera, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus. Infection of neonatal pigs with the alphacoronaviruses, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) or porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), results in mal-absorptive diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration and death (Madson et al., 2016; Saif et al., 2012) . The first outbreak of PEDV on U.S. farms in 2013 resulted in the death of nearly 7 million pigs or about 10% of U.S. pig production for that year (Stevenson et al., 2013) . In 2014, a diarrhea-causing porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was isolated from five pig farms in Ohio (Wang et al., 2014) . The M and N gene sequences were 99% identical to another PDCoV, HKU15, from China. Since 2014, PDCoV has rapidly spread throughout pig-producing regions in the U.S.",

            "text": "To date, four host proteins, aminopeptidase N (APN), angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2), dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), and carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion. molecule 1 (CEACAM1), have been described to function as coronavirus receptors (Delmas et al., 1992; Li et al., 2003; Raj et al., 2013; Dveksler et al., 1991) . Porcine APN (pAPN), a 963 amino acid, type II membrane metallopeptidase, participates in the removal of Nterminal amino acids from protein substrates during digestion. Delmas et al. (1994) were the first to characterize an APN peptide sequence, located between amino acids 717 and 813, as required for infection of cells with TGEV. The corresponding receptor region on TGEV is located on the S1 subunit C-terminal domain (S1-CTD) of the TGEV spike (S) protein (Godet et al., 1994) . Recent studies have focused on the potential role of APN as a receptor for PDCoV. The data have yielded three different observations and conclusions. In 2018, Wang et al. showed that cell lines, such as Vero and BHK-21, were resistant to infection with PDCoV and TGEV. Permissiveness was acquired after transfection of both cell lines with a plasmid expressing a pAPN cDNA. PDCoV and TGEV growth curves on the transfected cells showed a yield greater than 5 log 10 TCID 50 /ml. The authors concluded that pAPN is a functional receptor for PDCoV. Also, in 2018, Zhu et al., reported similar results. However, HeLa cells, which were pAPN-negative, and resistant to TGEV, supported PDCoV infection. Furthermore, a knockout of pAPN expression in the porcine IPIhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2019.12.007 Received 10 October 2019; Received in revised form 16 December 2019; Accepted 17 December 2019 21 cell line was prepared by using CRISPR to inactivate ANPEP, the gene which codes for APN. The ANPEP KO IPI-21 cells were completely resistant to TGEV, but retained permissiveness for PDCoV. The authors concluded that \"pAPN is likely not a critical functional receptor for PDCoV, although it is involved in PDCoV infection\". The third outcome related to pAPN and PDCoV is found in Li et al. (2018) , who evaluated the permissiveness of ANPEP knockout (KO) ST cells to infection with TGEV and PDCoV. ST cells lacking pAPN were completely resistant to TGEV but retained a small capacity to support PDCoV infection. The authors concluded that PDCoV utilizes pAPN as a primary receptor for virus attachment, but the presence of a second co-receptor contributes to the permissiveness of cells for infection. Furthermore, the PDCoV coreceptor can retain function independent of pAPN.",

Porcine alveolar macrophages from ANPEP KO pigs were resistant to PDCoV and TGEV. However, lung fibroblast-like cells, which appeared following the outgrowth of ANPEP KO PAM cultures, were susceptible to PDCoV but remained resistance to TGEV. Furthermore, ANPEP KO pigs supported PDCoV infection. The results support a role for pAPN as a receptor for PDCoV, but the presence of a second, unknown receptor or factor can substitute for pAPN function.",

The fibroblastlike cells from the WT and KO pigs were passaged at least two times and then infected with PDCoV or TGEV. The fibroblast-like cells derived from the ANPEP WT pigs were permissive for both TGEV and PDCoV ( Fig. 1C and D) . However, the ANPEP KO fibroblast-like cell cultures showed no evidence of TGEV infection, but showed several PDCoVinfected cells, all possessing a fibroblast-like morphology. These data confirmed the requirement of APN for the permissiveness of the fibroblast cells to TGEV; however, the absence of APN had no effect on infection of fibroblast-like cells with PDCoV.",

At four days after infection, one WT and one KO pigs were removed from the study and necropsied. RT-PCR amplification of PDCoV nucleic acid in intestines and mesenteric lymph nodes showed that both pigs were negative for PDCoV. The presence of PDCoV infection was also assessed by virus-specific neutralizing activity measured in serum at the termination of the study, 14 days after infection. The results, summarized in Table 1 , showed that two of the remaining six pigs seroconverted; one WT and one KO pig. Clinical signs, such as diarrhea and fever, were not detected in any of the infected WT or KO pigs. The absence of clinical signs is likely a result of the older-age pigs used in the infection study. Together, the RT-PCR and serological results showed that ANPEP KO pigs are not resistant to infection with PDCoV.",

            "text": "Ultimately, the importance of pAPN as a receptor for PDCoV is determined by the permissiveness of ANPEP KO pigs for infection. The results in Table 1 , showing positive results for the presence of PDCoV nucleic acid in the feces of infected ANPEP KO pigs confirms the results obtained following the infection of KO fibroblast-like cells. These data support the notion that APN is not required for PDCoV infection of pigs. However, the conclusion that ANPEP KO pigs retain permissiveness for infection with PDCoV comes with a few caveats. For example, all fecal samples on day 1 after infection were positive for PDCoV nucleic acid and by 3 days, the virus was only detected in one KO pig. Intestinal tissues from the two pigs tested, one WT and one KO, were negative for PDCoV. The positive results obtained for feces can be explained by the presence of environmental contamination caused by the residual inoculum used for infection. However, support for a productive infection of the KO pigs comes from the seroconversion of one KO pig at 14 days after infection (see Table 1 ). A second caveat comes from the transient nature of PDCoV infection in the WT and KO pigs used in this study, which made it difficult to determine if APN plays a role in the disease process. Previous studies show that neonatal piglets are more susceptible than weaned pigs to enteric virus infection Jung et al., 2015) . The relationship of pig age and PDCoV infection outcome has not been studied in detail; however, it is speculated that PDCoV infection may be age-dependent, similar to PEDV, with more severe outcomes in younger piglets. In this study, 28-33 day-old ANPEP KO and WT pigs were used for PDCoV inoculation. In future studies, a more sensitive neonatal pig infection model can be used which may yield a more accurate determination regarding the role of APN in PDCoV infection of its natural host.",

One hundred microliters of diluted serum were mixed with 100 \u03bcl of PDCoV South Dakota an 800 TCID50 virus in 100 \u03bcl media 800 TCID 50 /100 \u03bcl on a 96 well plate and incubated 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Samples were transferred to a 96-well plate of confluent ST cells and incubated for 24 h at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2 . Infected cells were detected by IFA using an anti-PDCoV mAb. The neutralizing antibody titer was reported as the highest serum dilution at which 100% of virus infection was inhibited.",
