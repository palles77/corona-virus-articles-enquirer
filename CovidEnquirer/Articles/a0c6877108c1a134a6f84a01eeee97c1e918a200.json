Ivermectin, at a dosage of 0.05 mg/kg p.o. q.30 days, therapy is started at 6 months of age and continued throughout the animal's life. In regions with severe winters, treatment may be suspended during the winter months. In the southeastern USA, heartworm prophylaxis is given year-round. In most European countries where red pandas are kept in zoos, Dirofilaria immitis is not endemic, although dirofilariasis has been reported in a red panda in southern France (D. White, personal communication). An occult canine heartworm serological test can be used to identify infection and many zoos do this test as part of routine health exams. Successful treatment of heartworm infection has not been described, to the authors' knowledge. Treatment of dirofilariasis with melarsomine, at the approved canine dosage, should not be attempted as at least one red panda has died following melarsomine therapy. If a red panda is not symptomatic but occult heartworm test-positive, long-term, prophylactic dosage ivermectin therapy may be a more prudent therapeutic approach.",

This usually occurs during warm weather, when other animals in the collection are infested.

The pattern of hair loss on the lower back and tail resemble those seen in flea-hypersensitivity in domestic animals, although fleas or flea faeces are not always found. It is recommended that keepers caring for red pandas are not in contact with animals which are commonly infected with fleas. Where this is unavoidable, measures should be taken to avoid contamination of red panda nest boxes. It is also advisable to change red panda bedding regularly. When birth is imminent, treatment of the nest boxes with some anti-flea preparation helps to avoid infant infestations. A number of anti-flea treatments have been used and, generally, those products which are safe and approved for use in domestic cats are effective. Domestic feline dosage regimens for imidacloprid, selamectin, nitenpyram, and fipronil have all been used in red pandas at the Knoxville Zoo without adverse side effects. Caution must be used as at least one zoo killed a panda cub by putting it in a flea bath.",

            "text": "A problem faced in the prophylaxis against distemper in exotic carnivores is the variation between and within species in their reaction to MLV vaccines, with possible lethal consequences. MLV vaccines have been designed to be minimally virulent, while retaining maximal immunogenicity in their domestic counterparts. When used in highly sensitive species or delivered by another route, the residual virulence may cause disease [37] . There are two widely used attenuated CDV vaccine strains: the Onderstepoort strain, attenuated in avian, and now more commonly co-cultivated in Vero cells; and the Rockport strain, attenuated in canine cells. Although the avian-attenuated CDV vaccines are generally safer when used in mammals, neither is safe for use in non-domestic species, as both types have caused fatal disease in a variety of species [38] . Published vaccineinduced distemper in red pandas has been caused by the Rockport strain [34, 35] . While MLV vaccines are not recommended for use in non-domestic species, currently MLV canine distemper vaccines continue to be used in Chinese facilities, despite questionable efficacy and safety [32] , and reports indicate that vaccine-induced disease and mortality is common [33] .",

The CDV-ISCOM vaccine has since been shown to be safe in several species in European zoos (W. Schaftenaar personal communication) [45, 46] . Red pandas reacted to vaccination with higher antibody titres when the total antigen concentration of the CDV-ISCOM was increased from 5 \u00b5g/ml to 10 \u00b5g/ml, suggesting a positive dose-response [45] , although the concentration should not exceed 10 \u00b5g/ml to minimize local reactions to the vaccine.

Serological surveys have shown low prevalence and low or \"suspect\" antibody titres to canine adenovirus, canine coronavirus, and influenza A virus in red pandas in China [33] . The detection of virus-specific antibodies indicates possible susceptibility to these viruses, although no clinical disease was observed in these pandas.",

Neonates are usually \"masked down,\" by placing a face mask over their face, and having them breathe 5% isoflurane in oxygen. Alternatively, an induction chamber (an opaque plastic box with a tight top) can be used in all age groups. Anaesthesia is induced by flowing 5% isoflurane in oxygen into the box. The animal is removed from the induction chamber when recumbent, and a face mask or endotracheal tube can be applied to maintain anaesthesia. With either induction method, when the animal is recumbent the percentage of isoflurane is reduced to 1.5\u00c03% isoflurane in oxygen for maintenance of anaesthesia. The chamber inductions are relatively slow but recoveries are rapid and animals are quickly able to be returned to their exhibit. Other new inhalant agents, such as sevoflurane, should work comparatively well.",

Typically, the animal is transferred from a crate to a small squeeze cage and the drugs are given intramuscularly, via hand injection.

One can anticipate that more attention will be paid in the future to the treatment of geriatric diseases of red pandas. Poor captive reproduction and infant survival are challenges we still face with this species and must do more to address. Better techniques to evaluate reproductive soundness are something that veterinarians and reproductive physiologists need to develop for this species. Continued efforts are also needed, by managers and health care staff, to improve mothering of cubs, with the aim of reducing the number of cubs that need to be hand-reared.",
