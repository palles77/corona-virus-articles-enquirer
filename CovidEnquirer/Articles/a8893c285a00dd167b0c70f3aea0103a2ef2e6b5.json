In this multi-centre, randomised, blinded study, adult cows vaccinated with a trivalent vaccine marketed for years (Rotavec\u2122 Corona, MSD Animal Health -RC) prior to last parturition were revaccinated 12-15 months later, prior to the upcoming parturition, with either a single injection of a recently marketed vaccine (Bovigen\u2122 Scour, Virbac -BS), or RC. The aim of this trial was to verify whether BS is not inferior to RC for the stimulation of the immune response and the passive transfer to calves in these conditions. A total of 136 multiparous dairy cows, from 5 different herds and located in 3 countries (France, UK and Germany) were enrolled in the study. Sixty-five cows were vaccinated with BS and 71 with RC. Antibody levels, measured by competitive ELISA and represented as percentage of inhibition (PI), were assessed in the cow's serum (on the day of vaccination: D0 and on days 21, 42 and at calving), in the colostrum and in the serum of calves in the first week of life. Differences in means of PI between groups and the 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. The non-inferiority threshold was set at \u221210%. The relationships between antibody levels in the colostrum and the vaccination-calving interval (VCI) or the inter-booster vaccination interval (IBVI) were also analysed.",

Furthermore, no correlation was found between PI values in the colostrum and the VCI or IBVI.

            "text": "Neonatal calf diarrhoea (NCD) affects mainly calves under 4 weeks of age. It is characterised by a diarrhoea leading to dehydration and acidosis which can have systemic consequences and potentially lead to death (Millemann, 2009) . The prevalence of NCD has been estimated around 20% and this disease is a major cause of death in young calves, responsible for more than 50% in some countries (Millemann, 2009; Bartels et al., 2010; Lorenz et al., 2011; Cho and Yoon, 2014; Meganck et al., 2015) . The loss of calves, the management of the disease and the consequences on the health, growth rate and reproductive potential of surviving calves can lead to a significant economic loss (Millemann, 2009; Cho and Yoon, 2014) . The environment, herd size and farm management practices, such as hygiene, feeding, routine use of antibiotics, neonatal care and colostrum management, can influence NCD prevalence in herds (Bendali et al., 1999; Bartels et al., 2010; Meganck et al., 2014) . These factors should be evaluated and properly monitored to avoid NCD. The etiological diagnosis of calf diarrhoea can also be sought in order to limit the consequences with the appropriate etiologic or preventive treatment (Millemann, 2009; Meganck et al., 2014 Meganck et al., , 2015 .",

Vaccinating pregnant cows before parturition usually triggers an immune response which leads to the presence of protective immunoglobulins in the colostrum. The calf can then be passively protected if it stands rapidly and is allowed to nurse to satiety, or if the colostrum is fed properly (Kohara et al., 1997; Weaver et al., 2000; Meganck et al., 2015) . The vaccines available for calf scours can contain different serotypes, strains or epitope presentations of BoCV, BoRV and ETEC. However, previous studies have shown that the different serotypes of Group A BoRV share similar epitopes and that heterotypic immune response can occur in already exposed cattle. This means that vaccination of adult cows with a single bovine rotavirus serotype will protect against all serotypes to which the cattle has been exposed (Snodgrass et al., 1984 Brussow et al., 1991; Taniguchi et al., 1991) . A cross-reaction between BoCV strains is even more likely since this virus presents a low antigenic variation (Clark, 1993; Tsunemitsu et al., 1995; Boileau and Kapil, 2010) . Finally, all vaccines contain the F5 adhesin, the main virulent factor found in calf ETEC responsible for NCD (Nagy and Fekete, 1999; DebRoy and Maddox, 2001; Kolenda et al., 2015; Picco et al., 2015) . Therefore, although not demonstrated yet, it should be possible to use a different scour vaccine than the one used for the previous vaccination.",

These results can be explained by the shared antigens and the cross-reactivity between BoRV serotypes and between BoCV strains (Snodgrass et al., 1984; Chiba et al., 1986; Brussow et al., 1991; Clark, 1993; Tsunemitsu et al., 1995) .

The lower limit of the 95% CI of the difference in means of variation was even > 0 for BoRV antibodies ( Table 2 ), suggesting that BS might even be superior to RC to stimulate the immune response against this virus. Such a difference could be explained, for example, by the use of a different serotype for revaccination. The better efficiency of a heterologous prime-boost vaccination over an homologous one has been observed previously with viral vectors (Lu, 2009; Zhou et al., 2011; Choi and Chang, 2013) . The difference in adjuvants could also explain the difference in immune response stimulation. This would suggest that the Montamide\u2122 ISA adjuvant (based on purified squalene and squalane) present in BS would be more efficient to stimulate BoRV immune response than those present in RC (aluminium hydroxide and light mineral oil/emulsifier). The advantages of the former adjuvant have been demonstrated previously with other antigens (Patil et al., 2002; Jang et al., 2010; Khorasani et al., 2016) .",

The decrease observed in BoRV antibodies was greater than the one observed with the other antibodies so that the median PI at calving was even lower than at D0 while the median PIs were still > 95% for BoCV and F5 antibodies. This result suggests a less intense and more labile immune response against BoRV than against the other antigens assessed. The decrease of antibodies in cow's serum before calving has been observed previously and is due to the transport of immunoglobulins from the blood stream into the lacteal secretion during colostrogenesis (Kohara et al., 1997; Weaver et al., 2000; Murphy et al., 2005) . Indeed, in the colostrum, all the median PIs were above 95% in both groups while some median values in the serum of cow at calving were below 65% (for BoRV). Therefore, the results obtained in this study confirm that high antibody levels can be reached in the colostrum with both vaccines when they are administered at the right time (12 to 3 weeks before parturition). A minimum of 2-3 weeks is usually necessary between vaccination and parturition to allow the immune response to reach a maximum level (in around 3 weeks) when the passage of immunoglobulins to the mammary gland is at its peak 1-3 days before parturition) (Radostits, 1991; Weaver et al., 2000) .",

However, the BoRV antibody levels obtained in the colostrum of cows vaccinated with RC less than 4 weeks before calving were lower than when the VCI was longer. Consistently with the lack of a significant increase at D21 compared to D0, this result suggests that more than 3 weeks is required for the immune response against BoRV to fully develop with this vaccine. Analysing the correlation between IBVI and antibody levels in the colostrum also showed that these two parameters were not linked for any of the antigens assessed. This means that a single injection of BS or RC at least 3 weeks before parturition increases the concentration of specific immunoglobulins in the colostrum regardless of the cow's vaccination history 10-19 months before in this study).",

            "text": "Levels of antibodies in the colostrum are of great importance for the protection of calves by passive transfer and correlations between these levels and the protection of calves have been demonstrated previously (Radostits, 1991) . The passive transfer is also highly dependent on the amount of colostrum ingested by the calf and the time after birth it is ingested. It is advised (and such recommendations were given to farmers in this trial) to feed the calf with 2-4 litters of colostrum according to the calf's weight, in the first 4-6 h of life, when the transfer of macromolecules (including antibodies) across epithelial cells is optimal (Radostits, 1991 20-40% or even more calves could suffer from failure of passive transfer (FPT), which is a risk factor for NCD (Weaver et al., 2000; Cho and Yoon, 2014; Meganck et al., 2014; Raboisson et al., 2016) . Other parameters such as the colostrum management and feeding practices are also involved in FPT (Weaver et al., 2000; Meganck et al., 2014) . For instance, FPT is less likely when known amount of colostrum are given (with a nipple bottle, an oesophageal tube or in a bucket) instead of leaving the calves to suckle colostrum from their mothers (Filteau et al., 2003; Trotz-Williams et al., 2008) . In the farms included in the study, the colostrum was generally given in buckets or via oesophageal tube, limiting the risks of FPT. Indeed, according to the high levels of antibodies found in the calf's serum (median PIs > 80%) and the good correlation between PIs found in the serum of cows at D21 or in the colostrum and those found in the serum of calves, it can be assumed that the colostrum was given properly. The variability in antibody levels found in the serum of calves can therefore be attributed to the variability found in the dams and in the colostrum rather than to the variability in colostrum feeding processes. Like in the other samples, the mean PIs found in the serum of calves was similar between groups for all antigens assessed and the BS vaccine was statistically not inferior to RC for this parameter. Since calf diarrhoea is not only due to BoRV, BoCV and ETEC infections but can also be due to infections by other viruses (like bovine viral diarrhoea virus), bacteria (like salmonella) or parasites (like C. parvum) (Millemann, 2009; Cho and Yoon, 2014) , the prevalence of calf diarrhoea in offspring of vaccinated cows was not recorded. However, the high PI values found in the calves of vaccinated cows in this study suggest that the calves will be protected from affections induced by BoRV, BoCV and ETEC (Radostits, 1991) . Therefore, although vaccination should not be used as a sole preventive intervention, especially because it does not protect against all pathogens, it remains an efficient way to protect calves against the main pathogens of NCD (Radostits, 1991; Kohara et al., 1997; Bendali et al., 1999; Cho and Yoon, 2014; Meganck et al., 2014 Meganck et al., , 2015 .",

The BS vaccine was found to be statistically non-inferior to RC for these parameters, despite the difference in serotypes, strains and antigen presentations between the two vaccines. This study also confirms that an efficient passive transfer of immunity can be achieved when vaccination of dams and colostrum intake are properly managed. The finding that a single injection of BS can be used as a booster in cattle previously vaccinated with another scour vaccine should facilitate the prophylactic vaccination campaigns in the field, especially when some vaccine shortage occurs or when another vaccine than the one previously used must be chosen for financial reasons.",
