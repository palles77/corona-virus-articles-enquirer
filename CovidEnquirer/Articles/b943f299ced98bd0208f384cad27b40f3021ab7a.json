Influenza epidemics and pandemics worldwide continue to challenge clinicians with managing infected patients requiring ICU care.

Children under two years of age and adults over the age of 65 years are at highest risk of adverse outcomes. Additionally, the presence of chronic medical conditions, immunosuppression, pregnancy, and obesity may also increase the risk of adverse outcome. The predominant seasonal influenza A virus subtypes in circulation since 1977 have been H1N1 and H3N2. However, since the 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic, the predominant seasonal influenza A is the 2009 H1N1 virus strain.

The authors compared those patients who received early oseltamivir treatment (within 2 days of symptoms onset) to those who received oseltamivir N2 days after symptom onset. The effectiveness of early oseltamivir was evaluated with propensity scores created by using covariates determined among baseline differences between groups. This study evaluated 657 patients with a mean age of 44.7 \u00b1 14.6 years. The mean APACHE II score on day 1 was 13.9 and 404 patients (61.1%) required invasive mechanical ventilation. In the entire population, 22.3% received early oseltamivir and more than half of these patients (68.8%) received oseltamivir 300 mg/ day at ICU admission. In the entire patient population, there was a non-significant difference in ICU mortality between those who received early vs. late oseltamivr (OR 1.45; 95% CI 0.96-2.21). However, in a subset of patients (n = 385) on invasive ventilation who received effective treatment (defined as receiving N4 doses of antiviral therapy), ICU mortality was 34.3% in those receiving late oseltamivir and 21.3% in those receiving early oseltamivir (OR 1.9; 95% CI 1.06-3.41). The corresponding relative risk was 0.63 in those who received early oseltamivir (95% CI 0.40-0.99). Multivariable analyses confirmed the association of early oseltamivir with improved survival (OR for death 0.44; 95% CI 0.22-0.90) in this subset of ventilated patients.

The primary outcome was mortality during hospital admission or in the individual study follow-up period and the authors evaluated the effectiveness of oseltamivir in various subgroups of patients: treatment vs. none, early (within 2 days of symptom onset) vs. late treatment, early treatment vs. none, and late treatment vs. none. The authors were able to use 29,234 patients from 78 different data sets in their analysis, of which the mortality rate was 10%. Of these patients, 5103 were critically ill adults, defined as admission to a critical care unit, with a mortality rate of 70% in this patient population. Neuraminidase inhibitors were administered to 64% of patients in the entire population and oral oseltamivir was used in 92% of patients. Outcomes were adjusted for treatment propensity, corticosteroid use, and antibiotic use. Among critically ill adults, NAI use was associated with a mortality reduction compared to no therapy (OR 0.72; 95% CI 0.56-0.94). Early NAI use was associated with a reduction in mortality compared to late therapy (0.62; 95% CI: 0.49-0.77) in critically ill patients. The mortality reduction was also statistically significant for critically ill patients who received an NAI versus no therapy in those treated earlier (OR 0.31; 95% CI 0.20-0.47) and later (OR: 0.65; 95% CI 0.46-0.93).

However, even when not used early, late oseltamivir use may also be associated with reductions in mortality. Median time from symptom onset to late oseltamivir was 4.5 days in the study by Rodriguez et al. and 4 days in the study by Muthuri et al. The effectiveness of oseltamivir in patients presenting outside this window is not entirely clear. There are many limitations to the interpretation of this data in critically ill patients including lack of standard definitions for critically ill patients and lack of evaluation of differences in outcome in those with or without a history of underlying pulmonary disease or concomitant bacterial pneumonia which are associated with increased morbidity [4] . Furthermore, it's unclear whether the potential benefits of NAIs seen in these studies would also apply to patients with non-pandemic strains of influenza or whether these benefits would be seen in vaccinated vs. unvaccinated patients. This is of importance as prior studies have demonstrated that influenza vaccination may protect against secondary pneumonia, but this may be dependent upon the circulating influenza strain [11] . Oseltamivir is generally well-tolerated; however, neuropsychiatric events such as delirium, hallucinations, and behavioral changes or rare dermatologic reactions (e.g. toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome) have been reported and may discourage use in critically ill patients.",

This interest has been born out of concerns regarding absorption of oseltamivir in critically ill patients and perhaps improved efficacy of the higher dose. A pharmacokinetic study sought to evaluate plasma concentrations of oseltamivir administered orally or via nasogastric tube in critically ill patients with H1N1 [12] . Serum levels of oseltamivir free base and its carboxylate metabolite were measured at baseline and then 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 h after the fourth oseltamivir dose or later. Of the 41 included patients, 73% received enteral nutrition and 32% were on vasopressor therapy. The authors found serum concentrations of active oseltamivir carboxylate metabolite that were similar to levels seen in ambulatory patients. Therefore, it is likely trough concentrations were above the theorized pharmacodynamic threshold for maximal inhibition of the virus, though the authors did not report these values. Furthermore, there was no correlation between body weight and area under the curve for volume of distribution suggesting dose adjustments are not required for obesity.",

A prospective pharmacokinetic study of 13 patients on either continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHD) or ECMO evaluated the pharmacokinetic parameters and plasma concentrations of oseltamivir in these patients [15] . All patients in this study received oseltamivir 150 mg twice daily. Serum samples were obtained at regular intervals following drug administration just before the hemodialyzer (CVVHD) or directly before and after the oxygenator (ECMO). CVVHD contributed significantly to the clearance of oseltamivir carboxylate while pre-and post-oxygenator concentrations of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate did not differ. The authors found a higher oseltamivir carboxylate area under the curve for the 12-hour dosing interval (AUC 0-12 ) than would be expected in non-critically ill patients receiving the same dosage regimen. The dose utilized resulted in higher median AUC 0-12 levels than would be expected in non-critically ill patients receiving the same regimen. The authors stated the 75 mg twice daily dose of oseltamivir would be reasonable in patients on CVVHD at similar effluent rates to those used in this analysis (3300 \u00b1 919 mL/h). Furthermore, AUC 0-12 was lower in patients receiving both CVVHD and ECMO compared to patients receiving only CVVHD. The study population may have been too small to draw firm conclusions regarding oseltamivir dosing in ECMO; however, the authors speculated that higher dose may be required in these patients, particularly when gastrointestinal dysfunction may be present.",

Cases were those patients hospitalized in an ICU for \u226524 h with acute respiratory infection and laboratory evidence of H1N1 infection by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. A comparative analysis was performed in critically ill patients treated with NAIs, but who did not receive peramivir. Of 1684 patients who received treatment with an NAI, 57 (3%) received IV peramivir. Of these 57 patients, 95% were on mechanical ventilation and 25% had suspected bacterial coinfection. The majority of these cases received a concurrent second antiviral, most commonly oseltamivir. Time from symptom onset to treatment with an oral NAI was 4 days and from symptom onset to peramivir was 9 days. The most common reasons for initiation of peramivir were \"not responded to oral or inhaled antivirals\" (75%) and \"suspected malabsorption\" (12%). Twenty-nine patients (51%) who received peramivir died. Patients who died after receiving peramivir were more likely to be diagnosed with acute renal failure (p = .02), have a shorter length of hospital stay (16 vs. 31 days; p = .002), and receive peramivir for a shorter duration (7 vs. 9 days; p = .02) compared to survivors who received peramivir. Patients who received peramivir were compared to 1627 cases in the ICU treated with NAIs, but not peramivir. Patients treated with peramivir had a higher rate of obesity and morbid obesity, and were more likely to be diagnosed with pneumonia/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (p = .0002) or sepsis (p b .0001), to require mechanical ventilation (p b .0001), and to die (p b .0001). The authors questioned the safety and effectiveness of peramivir in hospitalized critically ill patients and highlighted the need for large randomized controlled trial in this area.",

Critically ill patients were defined as those admitted to an ICU or requiring mechanical ventilation with a PaO 2 :FiO 2 ratio b 300 and who required infusion of an inotropic or vasoactive medication. Patients were divided into two groups based on initial treatment with either peramivir (n = 34) or oseltamivir (n = 26). The average age was 68 years and 55% were male. At baseline, patients who received peramivir had a higher SOFA score (11 vs. 8.5) and a higher proportion of patients were in shock (64.7% vs. 38.5%). Patients who received oseltamivir were more likely to have chronic heart disease (38.5% vs. 8.8%). Influenza A was predominant in both groups with 85.3% in the peramivir group and 88.5% in the oseltamivir group. Peramivir was changed to oseltamivir in 15 patients (44.1%), primarily due to clinical improvement while in the ICU. Oseltamivir was changed to peramivir in 13 patients (50%) and eleven of these patients had progression of pneumonia. Half of patients treated with peramivir received a 600 mg dose while 65.4% of oseltamivir patients received a 75 mg dose. The median duration of antiviral therapy was 9.5 days in the peramivir group and 11 days in the oseltamivir group. Between the peramivir and oseltamivir groups, there was no difference in ICU mortality (38.2% vs. 30.8%; p = .548), in-hospital mortality (44.1% vs. 38.5%; p = .660) or ICU or hospital length of stay. In multivariate analysis increasing age was associated with 28-day mortality, but peramivir use was not. The authors concluded that critically ill patients with severe influenza can be treated with either intravenous peramivir or enteral oseltamivir depending on the most appropriate route of administration with no difference in outcomes; although the study may have lacked adequate power to detect differences in these outcomes.",

The plasma was collected from a patient who suffered from H5N1 influenza disease in the Anhui province earlier that year. The hemagglutinin genes of the two viruses shared near complete homology. Shortly after administration, the patients' viral load decreased precipitously to undetectable levels and his fevers resolved.

The need for antibiotic therapy was at the discretion of the treating physician. Primary viral pneumonia was present in 733 patients and 190 of these patients were administered macrolides, usually in combination with other antimicrobial agents. Clarithromycin was utilized in 99 patients, azithromycin in 90 patients, and erythromycin in one patient. In patients who did not receive a macrolide (n = 543), 451 patients (83.1%) received double combination antibiotic therapy and 57 (10.5%) received triple combination therapy. Overall ICU mortality was 24.1% and was lower in patients who received macrolides compared to those who did not (19.2% vs. 28.1%, p = .02). In a logistic regression analysis controlling for APACHE II score and potential confounding factors, macrolide use was not associated with significant reductions in mortality (OR 0.89; 95% CI 0.53-1.49). Similar results were obtained in a subgroup of patients on mechanical ventilation. The results do not suggest a benefit of macrolide treatment in critically ill patients with primary viral pneumonia due to H1N1.",

Both groups also received corticosteroids at a standardized 20 mg/day dose of prednisolone. They found more favorable PaO 2 :FiO 2 at day 3 and 7, and quicker liberation from mechanical ventilation among sirolimus recipients. Sirolimus recipients also had a greater proportion of patients with negative repeat PCR at day 7 (75% vs. 33%, p b .05), however quantitative assessments were not performed. No differences in the need for ECMO or death were observed. Given their undesirable adverse effects including cytopenias and renal injury, among others, more robust studies need to be performed to substantiate these findings prior to their widespread use.",

Strategies to enhance NAI performance, including use of double dose oseltamivir and development of alternative agents such as intravenous peramivir, have failed to show benefit in the ICU population. Immune modulating therapies have shown promise in the limited available evidence. These agents may be particularly useful in pandemic scenarios due to novel influenza strains, specifically in patients failing to improve despite standard therapy and escalating respiratory support.
