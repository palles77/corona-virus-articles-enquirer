One hypothesis is that it mediates the binding of virus to sites within the aphid food canal, either directly, by iinking the virus to the aphid (Fig. 4A ), or indirectly, by modifying viral attachment compounds in the aphid to allow virus binding (Fig. 48) . Virus-like particles have been observed embedded in a matrix material assocaated with the stylers and foregut of aphids fed on a mlxrurc of Gus and HC. No bound particles were oherved when aphids were fed on virus alone*.
