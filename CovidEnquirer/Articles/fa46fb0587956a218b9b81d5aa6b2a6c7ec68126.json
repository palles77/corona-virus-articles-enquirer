Mark Davis and Russ Pate. I had an interest in understanding how exercise affected the immune system because not much was known about it, so I sought out co-mentors at the nearby USC School of Medicine. There, I found Drs. Eugene Mayer and Abdul Ghaffar, who took me on as an additional mentee to learn about the immune system and how to study it. In the 1980s, exercise immunology was a very new subfield for exercise science. As time evolved, it has been satisfying to see how important the immune system is to the normal tissue and organ functioning and pathophysiology and how it plays a role in exercise adaptation in muscle and other tissues.",

In our animal studies, we found that moderate endurance exercise (30 min/day) could protect mice from death due to influenza. Mice that exercised for longer durations (\u00bb2.5 h/day) exhibited an increase in some illness symptoms, but there was no statistically significant difference in mortality when compared to sedentary mice. We concluded that moderate exercise could be beneficial and that prolonged exercise could be detrimental to influenza-infected mice.

We concluded that regular moderate endurance exercise might be one way to boost the protective effect of annual influenza vaccination.

Indeed, while the COVID-19 should not be taken lightly, influenza is a much bigger problem, but because it is relatively common and has been around for a long time, it does not receive the attention that new viral outbreaks do. The COVID-19 is scary because it is new and we do not know a lot about it yet. New viruses are always scary because we have little to no protective immunity against them and we do not have vaccines. There is work going on to understand and develop preventive strategies to deal with this COVID-19 threat.

One should not limit the multitude of health benefits that exercise provides us on a daily basis just because there is a new virus in our environment. However, there may be some additional precautions to reduce your risk of infection. If you are a \"social exerciser\", you might want to limit your exposure to exercise partners who have exhibited signs and symptoms of illness. The problem, though, is that infected people may be infectious before they exhibit symptoms. In some instances, wearing a mask while exercising may be a way to reduce your exposure. It is very important to make sure that if you are exercising on equipment in fitness facilities or gymnasiums that you make sure to disinfect the equipment before and after you use it. When done exercising, the most effective way to clean hands is to wet them with clean water, then apply soap and scrub for at least 20 s, before rinsing and drying with a clean towel. Hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol content may also be used, but the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns they are not effective against all germs. This strategy should be used at all times, not just because there is an acute viral outbreak. Avoiding touching your face and neck with your hands is also advised if you cannot disinfect them until a later time.",

Anything that increases your probability of coming into contact with an infected person, or that compromises your immune system, increases your risk of infection.

However, I would recommend against exercising if you are experiencing any of these symptoms: severe sore throat, body aches, shortness of breath, general fatigue, chest cough, or fever. You should also seek medical care if you are experiencing those symptoms. Typically, recovery from respiratory viral infections takes 2\u00c03 weeks, which corresponds with the time it takes your immune system to generate cytotoxic T cells necessary to clear the virus from infected cells. After this period, when symptoms are gone, it is safe to begin exercising regularly, but you may want to take it slow at first.",

Molecular and cellular events take place within seconds to minutes following the beginning of an exercise bout or period of physical activity. This is why there is so much work right now examining sitting time and how often physical activity should be interspersed with inactivity to promote health. The historic thinking has been that exercise promotes a fight or flight stress response that mobilizes immune cells to get ready for impending infectious or noninfectious challenges accompanied by physical activity. This makes sense from an evolutionary perspective where physical activity might lead to injury or harm.",

While I believe there is merit in the evidence they provide to refute the conclusions for that population, studies where sedentary people are forced to exercise at high intensities for prolonged periods might paint a different picture. There are few such studies due to the ethics and safety concerns and there are many other variables that contribute to natural infections that would need to be accounted and controlled for in such studies. The best studies would be ones that control exercise and infectious disease exposure in people. These are difficult to ethically perform in people and it would be very difficult or impossible to get approved by institutional review boards. Animal models, including ours as mentioned, may provide valuable insights into this argument and there are many studies demonstrating that prolonged, unaccustomed exercise can increase infectious disease morbidity and mortality. These studies were not reconciled in the Campbell and Turner 6 article. However, as with all animal models, there are limitations, such as species differences, stress associated with forced exercise, the type of pathogen, and timing of exercise in relation to infection that would need to be taken into account before a firm conclusion could be drawn.",

We found significant increases in the magnitude and duration of antibody responses in Tai Ji Quan/Qigong participants when compared to controls.

I would also caution about using cold call e-mails that do not reflect careful thought and research relative to the individual you are contacting. You should read the work and understand the research interests of the professor you are contacting while also making a case that you have strong interests and skills in this area. Most of the Chinese scholars I have mentored came to me on recommendation from someone I know and trust (e.g., another U.S. or international professor or student). Thus, it is important to create a network of people in your field of interest. You can do this by interacting with people at scientific meetings. If that is not an option due to cost or circumstance, I would recommend trying to find any connection between you, your institution, or your current mentor and someone at a target institution of study. As for manuscripts coming from Chinese or international laboratories submitted to English-language journals, my recommendation would be to make sure that the manuscript has been carefully edited for spelling and grammar relative to the English language. No matter how good the science is, if the presentation is poor it will reflect poorly on the work.",
