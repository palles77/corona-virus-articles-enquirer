Multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR was developed for simultaneous differential quantification of each virus in a single reaction tube, using Cy5-and FAM-labeled TaqMan-probes based on sequences from the TGEV and PEDV nucleocapsid genes. The copy numbers for transcripts of TGEV and PEDV were quantified using this assay over a range from 9 \u00d7 10 7 to 9 \u00d7 10 1 copies and 7 \u00d7 10 7 to 7 \u00d7 10 1 copies, respectively. The variability of the intra-assay and inter-assay were evaluated using standard solutions of each transcript, with coefficients of variation (CV) less than 3.43 and 3.33%, respectively. Piglets were experimentally infected with virulent TGEV and PEDV, and the amounts of virus from the onset of diarrhea were measured. Samples obtained from farms experiencing PED or TGE were quantified between 10 2 and 10 5 RNA copies. In conclusion, this assay provides an effective etiological diagnostic tool for detecting and quantifying viral loads. The assay may also prove useful for detecting infections, ultimately leading to better disease control on farms.",

            "text": "Conventional diagnostic assays use either antibodies or viral antigens to detect viral gastroenteritis. Several vaccines used for sows in Korea elicit immunoglobins (Igs) in maternal milk that help to protect offspring from infection. Therefore, serological examination cannot be used with these animals, since the vaccine does not distinguish between vaccinated animals and those infected with the wild-type virus. Several diagnostic assays are available for detecting viral antigens, including virus isolation, fluorescence assay, immune electron microscopy, in situ hybridization, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Callebaut et al., 1982; Van Nieuwstadt et al., 1988; Sueyoshi et al., 1995; Pensaert, 1999; Shibata et al., 2000; Kim and Chae, 2001; Rod\u00e1k et al., 2005) . However, none of these techniques can be used for early detection of the viral antigen because they require clinical samples from the intestines of dead pigs and are cumbersome to use, resulting in rather long detection times. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which includes single and multiplex RT-PCR, has proven to be a convenient and sensitive assay for detection of PEDV and TGEV (Paton et al., 1997; Kim et al., 2000 . This technique also has its limitations; it has lower sensitivity (\u223c10-100 times) than real-time PCR, viral loads cannot be measured, and identifying the virus by agarose gel electrophoresis is time consuming (Keyaerts et al., 2006) . RT-PCR also poses the potential risk of cross contamination during mass screening within the reverse transcription step. These drawbacks reduce the overall effectiveness of using RT-PCR to detect virus in new outbreaks and previous outbreak sites (Van Rijn et al., 2004; Ophuis et al., 2006) .",

            "text": "The primers and probes used for multiplex real-time RT-PCR were designed and synthesized in cooperation with TIB MOL-BIOL (TIB MOLBIOL Syntheselabor GmbH, Germany). The TGEV and PEDV sequences were aligned using Clustal X (version 1.81; Thompson et al., 1997) , and the highly conserved regions within each virus genome were identified. Primers and probes corresponding to the conserved regions were designed using sequence alignments of the nucleocapsid (N) genes from 10 strains of TGEV (Purdue 46-MAD, NC002306; TO14, AF302264; TS, DQ201447; SC-Y, DQ443743; Miller M6, DQ811785; TH-98, AY676604; HN2002, AY587884; 96-1933, AF104420; FS772/70, Y00542) and from five strains of PEDV (CV777, AF353511; Chinju99, AF237764; CH/S, DQ35524; S, DQ35223; JS2001, AY539715). The four primers were designed with a similar T m that was \u223c10 \u2022 C lower than that of the probes to prevent any dimeric interactions from forming. For color multiplexing, the probe for TGEV was labeled with the 5 -reporter dye 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) and the 3 -quencher BHQ1, and the probe for PEDV was labeled with the 5 -reporter dye Cy-5 and the 3 -quencher BHQ2. The sequences and amplicon sizes of the primers and probes are listed in Table 1 . The specificity of the primers and probes was confirmed against random nucleotide sequences using a BLAST search in GenBank databases located in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/).",

The primers and probe for PEDV, the genome sequences of which had up to two mismatches from only a small group of reference strains, proved very effective and were capable of detecting PEDV in all strains, including the field strains used in this study. Probes labeled with different reporter dyes to minimize the overlap in emission wavelengths were prepared. The protocol then was optimized by using the same concentrations for both sets of primers and probes, developing an assay that could detect and differentiate TGEV and PEDV without crossinterference. This assay was specific for TGEV and PEDV, and no cross-reaction with other diarrhea-causing viruses was found.",

Similar dynamic ranges were obtained from 10-fold serial dilutions of both transcripts, and the detection limits were determined to be 90 and 70 copies of TGEV and PEDV, respectively. The variability of the assay using both transcripts was low, which was similar to or slightly higher than the amplification data from the intra-and inter-assay compared to reports for realtime PCR (Pugnale et al., 2006; Keyaerts et al., 2006) . Using standard curves, the amount of viral RNA in infected ST and VERO cells was estimated to compare the sensitivity of this method with conventional PCR. The detection limit of the assay was 1 TCID 50 /ml for both viruses (data not shown), which is \u223c10-fold higher than previously reported (Paton et al., 1997; Kim et al., 2000 . RT-PCR-based dot blot hybridization reported by Jung and Chae (2005) shows more sensitive than multiplex real-time RT-PCR. However, real-time RT-PCR generates results within 3 h, which is significantly faster than the more than 1 day required to complete RT-PCR-based dot blot hybridization.",

The viral loads of TGEV were first calculated on day 2, peaked on day 4, and then decreased until death. For PEDV, the viral load reached its highest level on day 1 and then decreased until death. In this study, the virus shedding time, viral loads, and period of viral persistence differed from those previously reported due to differences in titers, the size of the viral inoculum, and the ages of the experimental pigs. De Arriba et al. (2002) reported that PEDV peaked after 5 days as determined by fecal swabs and decreased for 8 days after inoculation.",

Nevertheless, a correlation was noted: the larger the viral load detected by multiplex real-time RT-PCR, the higher the rate of piglet mortality. The results show that this assay can be used to determine viral loads in pig herds, which makes it an additional factor for evaluating the status of the affected farms. Furthermore, farms experiencing a disease outbreak can use information on viral loads to determine the most appropriate treatment, such as selection of vaccine type to protect their herds against future epidemics as described for quantitative RT-PCR using a PEDV internal control by Song et al. (2006) . To optimize calculation of viral load by this assay, virus loads must be evaluated on farms where outbreaks are just beginning or ending to elucidate the potential transmission of both viral infections on pig farms.",
