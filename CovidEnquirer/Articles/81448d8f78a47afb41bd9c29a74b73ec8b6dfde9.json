Alternative methodologies have been introduced in an effort to improve turnaround times. One such system, the R-mix TM shell vial is discussed herein. The study objectives were: (a) to establish R-mix TM testing parameters as compared to direct antigen testing (DAT) and CC, and (b) to assess technical aspects and cost of R-mix TM in a high volume clinical virology laboratory. Study design: A prospective analysis of respiratory samples submitted to the clinical virology laboratory between November 2004 and April 2005 was performed. All specimens were inoculated onto R-mix TM shell vials (SV) and CC tubes; and a subset also underwent DAT for influenza A and B and/or RSV. A retrospective estimated cost analysis was made. Results: A total of 563 samples were included in the study, which collectively revealed a total of 207 viruses. Sensitivity of R-mix TM for seven major respiratory viruses ranged from 45% to 83% compared to CC and DAT, while mean time to detection (TTD) varied from 1.1 to 1.4 days. In addition to these viruses, 23 picornaviruses, 11 CMV isolates and 5 HSV isolates were detected by CC alone. Conclusions: The R-mix TM system has similar sensitivity as CC for the detection of parainfluenza 1-3 and influenza A/B while dramatically reducing the TTD. Furthermore, it is significantly more sensitive and produces more timely results for RSV than CC; yet, neither method offers a diagnostic benefit over rapid DAT for RSV detection. The sensitivity of R-mix TM for adenovirus appears to be significantly lower than that of CC. Lastly, methodologies other than R-mix TM must remain in place under circumstances where identification of other potential viral respiratory pathogens, including herpesviruses and picornaviruses, is desired.",

            "text": "With respect to diagnostic testing for pathogenic respiratory viruses, cell culture (CC) has traditionally been considered the gold standard reference method (Yolken et al., 2003) . One major disadvantage to this approach, however, is the extended incubation period often required for virus isolation, such that results are unavailable to clinicians during the initial stages of patient management (Shetty et al., 2003) . Additional tests including enzyme immunoassays (EIAs), immunofluorescence (IF) assays and other direct antigen tests (DAT) (Johnston and Siegel, 1990; Reina et al., 2004; Shetty et al., 2003; Weinberg and Walker, 2005) , shell vial techniques (Engler and Preuss, 1997; Schirm et al., 1992) and nucleic acid amplification tests (Kehl et al., 2001; Templeton et al., 2004; Weinberg et al., 2004b) have all been introduced into the viral diagnostic armamentarium with the logical rationale that more rapid detection may favorably influence patient management, leading to reductions in antibiotic usage, shorter and less costly hospitalizations with fewer extraneous laboratory tests ordered, better cohorting capabilities and infection control measures, and better utilization of anti-viral therapies. A number of investigations have addressed one or more of these issues directly, each having employed some DAT as the methodological basis by which patient outcome comparisons were made (Adcock et al., 1997; Barenfanger et al., 2000; Byington et al., 2002; Noyola and Demmler, 2000; Woo et al., 1997) .",

            "text": "Considering all parameters, molecular tests utilizing the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have performed exceedingly well in detecting respiratory viruses and will likely supersede cell culture as the new gold standard (Kehl et al., 2001; Templeton et al., 2004; Weinberg et al., 2004b ). Yet many clinical laboratories are not equipped with this capability at present. Direct antigen tests are inexpensive relative to PCR and offer the benefit of simplicity and very short turnaround times. These assays often have considerably lower sensitivities than cell culture, however. The shell vial technique, which incorporates the speed and specificity of virus detection by immunofluorescent antibodies with the sensitivity of virus propagation on cell monolayers, provides an attractive option in terms of performance, rapidity and cost. One commercially available system, the R-mix TM shell vial system (Diagnostic Hybrids Inc. [DHI] , Athens, OH), combines epithelial cells derived from mink lung (Mv1Lu) with a human adenocarcinoma cell line (A549) in order to support the replication of several respiratory viruses, including influenza A and B, RSV, adenovirus and serotypes 1-3 of parainfluenza virus. While analytical sensitivity (St. George et al., 2002) , cost analysis (Barenfanger et al., 2001) , and performance characteristics (Dunn et al., 2004; Fong et al., 2000; Weinberg et al., 2004a) of the R-mix TM shell vial system have been addressed in the medical literature, the present study was conducted in an effort to (a) substantiate these data at a large, tertiary-care hospital laboratory over an entire respiratory virus season using traditional CC and DAT as methods of comparison, and (b) assess the technical aspects and cost of R-mix TM in order to determine the feasibility of its replacing CC.",

From the 563 specimens included in the analysis, a total of 207 viruses were detected by one or more method, resulting in an overall positivity rate of 36.8%. These figures include eight samples from which dual virus infection was detected (Table 1) . The most frequently detected virus during the study period was RSV (n = 78), followed by influenza A/B (n = 36), adenovirus (n = 31), parainfluenza 1-3 and picornaviruses (n = 23 each) (Table II) . Sensitivity/NPV for the detection of RSV by R-mix TM was significantly higher than by CC (73%/95.8% and 42%/91.5%, respectively; p = 0.0001); and mean TTD of all RSV positive specimens by R-mix TM shell vial assay was 1.2 days compared to 8.0 days required by CC.

Given the liability of RSV and prior reports demonstrating that DAT frequently detects uncultivable RSV (Johnston and Siegel, 1990; Kellogg, 1991) , we have no reason to doubt that most RSV-positive samples detected by DAT alone were actually true positives. Indeed, other investigations of the R-mix TM system have illustrated the benefits of DAT for RSV detection (Dunn et al., 2004; Fong et al., 2000) . Yet given the possibility that a small number of RSVpositive samples detected only by DAT may have been falsely positive, we cannot rule out having slightly underestimated the sensitivity for RSV detection by CC and SV. Additionally, because pediatric-aged patients (a) were overrepresented in our data, and (b) have been shown to harbor higher RSV titers and, hence, test positive by DAT more frequently than adults (Kellogg, 1991) , we cannot draw conclusions from the present study regarding appropriate testing for RSV in the adult population.",

Surprisingly, comparison of sensitivity for influenza A/B by DAT and either culture methodology revealed no statistical differences. Because influenza virus is not generally considered to be as labile as RSV, a scenario wherein DAT is the sole positive assay for this virus seems somewhat less likely. Review of our data indicated that 5 of 15 DATs positive for influenza A/B (all of which were performed by EIA) were unconfirmed by either culture method. While we speculate that some of these results may have been falsely positive (and therefore decreased the calculated sensitivity of both culture systems), supplemental testing (e.g. RT-PCR) and/or detailed information (e.g. duration between DAT and culture set-up), which might have corroborated this suspicion, were not readily available.",

Reports by Huang and Turchek (2000) and St. George et al. (2002) demonstrated similar detection rates and analytical sensitivity for adenovirus isolates between R-mix TM shell vials harvested 24 h post-inoculation as compared to other 24-h shell vial or conventional CC methods. However, the two studies utilized (a) stored patient samples that had previously tested positive by IFA or (b) dilutions of passaged virus. By contrast, two prospective studies using fresh, non-passaged patient samples reported low sensitivity rates for adenovirus similar to the present study-namely 69% and 25% based on 51 and 16 isolates, respectively (Dunn et al., 2004; Weinberg et al., 2004a) . These authors concluded that abbreviated incubation periods (24 h) or differing inoculum volumes (0.2 mL versus 0.3 mL) may have accounted for their observed low sensitivity values. Yet these variables cannot account for our observed adenovirus sensitivity, as we (a) extended the incubation period of R-mix TM shell vials to 48 h and (b) used identical inoculum volumes of each specimen for CC and R-mix TM . Still, the lower sensitivity observed in R-mix TM could have been due to low viral titers in some samples, particularly given the mean TTD by CC for the 17 samples not detected by R-mix TM (6.7 days). In that case, extended incubation of shell vials beyond 48 h may have resulted in an increased recovery rate, although this seems to us to defeat the overall purpose of shell vial techniques. Lastly, because different antibody reagents were utilized for R-mix TM screen/confirmation (D 3 , DHI) and CC confirmation (Bartels, Trinity Biotech), we cannot exclude the unlikely possibility that differences in observed adenovirus sensitivity between the two culture systems were partly attributable to inherent antigen specificities between the virus-specific monoclonal antibodies.",

Of 33 such specimens, 11 (33%) were virus-positive by CC and/or DAT but not R-mix TM , 13 (39%) were negative by all three methodologies, and nine (27%) were ultimately identified as virus positive by repeat R-mix TM confirmation staining. As the virus season progressed, staff became more attuned to the fact that weak positivity on screening often did not confirm. A minor modification of the SV protocol was instituted so that confirmation of weakly positive screens from day 1 was postponed until day 2. Indeed, the number of equivocal samples at 24-h decreased as the study progressed, and we were able to confirm six virus-positive samples on day 2 that may have otherwise gone undetected by R-mix TM . Had we chosen to extend incubation of equivocal samples from day 2 for an additional 24 h (i.e. perform confirmation staining at 36 h post-inoculation), we may have recovered some or all of the 11 viruses that were detected only by other methods.",

However, we found that the majority of viruses detected after elimination of the 95 DAT-positive specimens (i.e. samples on which culture would not have been performed under our usual laboratory protocol) were more readily identified by CC (Fig. 1B) . In fact, use of the R-mix TM system in place of CC as the exclusive follow-up method to DAT in this study would have resulted in a reduction in overall cultivation rate from 23.5% (112/476) to 12.8% (61/476). While the clinical relevance of the herpesvirus and picornavirus isolates from our study is unknown, these viruses have been implicated in respiratory disease among certain populations (de la Hoz et al., 2002; Ghosh et al., 1999; Greenberg, 2003) . Furthermore, as a number of less common respiratory viruses, including metapneumovirus, some strains of coronavirus, measles and mumps are more likely to be recognized in CC than shell vials, it would seem reasonable for laboratories to retain some form of conventional CC if possible.",

As with other shell vial systems, additional advantages included simplicity of the methodology and less dependence on experience in discerning CPE. Importantly, our cost estimates were based upon an \"all or nothing\" scenario (i.e. CC alone versus R-mix TM alone). As a result, implementation of R-mix TM with retention of some CC capabilities would have served to increase the overall cost of the \"R-mix TM approach\".",

For RSV, the R-mix TM system is significantly more sensitive and more timely than CC, but neither appears to offers diagnostic benefit over DAT. The sensitivity of R-mix TM for adenovirus detection in clinical material is significantly lower than that of CC. Finally, while technical and logistical advantages of the R-mix TM system exist, alternative methodologies must remain in place if identification of other recognized viral respiratory pathogens, including CMV, HSV and picornaviruses is desired.",
