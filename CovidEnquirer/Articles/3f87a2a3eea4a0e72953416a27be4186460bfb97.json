            "text": "Five distinct groups of rotavirus (A-E) have been defined using both serological and nucleic acid based criteria (Pedley et al., 1983 (Pedley et al., , 1986 . There is no serological cross-reaction between viruses from different groups and the available nucleic acid data would suggest that each group represents an isolated gene pool with no exchange of genes across the group boundaries (McCrae, 1987) . Currently numbers of isolations of group A rotaviruses greatly exceed those from any of the other groups and molecular studies have focused on isolates from this group. Extensive genome profile analysis of group A rotaviruses has revealed that whilst variation in the electrophoretic mobility of individual RNA segments is observed, in general the overall 4,2,3,2 pattern of segment migration is highly conserved. Group A rotaviruses exhibiting major perturbations in their genome profiles have however been reported, the earliest being the 'short-profile' isolates of human rotavirus (Espejo et al., 1980) . Gene coding assignments have shown these were due to a major shift in the size of gene 11 (Dyall-Smith and Holmes, 1981) . Subsequently 'super-short' profile isolates of human rotavirus were reported (Hasegawa et al., 1984; Albert, 1985) . More recently there have been reports of group A viruses being isolated from humans (Besselaar et al., 1986 ) calves (Pocock, 1987 ) pigs (Bellinzoni et al., 1987 and rabbits (Thouless et al., 1986) in which the segment 11 was replaced by an RNA segment migrating between segments 6 and 7. Rearrangements of other genome segments have also been reported for human (Pedley et al., 1984) bovine (Hundley et al., 1985) and rabbit rotaviruses (Thouless et al., 1986) . Pocock (1987) analysed the proteins encoded by transcripts coming from the new RNA segment in one of the calf isolates exhibiting a rearranged gene 11. This showed that despite being approximately twice the length of the normal gene 11, transcripts from the new RNA encoded the normal protein product of gene 11, namely vpll (McCrae and McCorquodale, 1982a) . We have undertaken a detailed structural analysis of the new gene (gene x) from one of these calf isolates, using c-DNA cloning and sequencing, to ascertain the exact nature of the rearrangements involved in its generation.",

The addition of homopolymer C tails to the c-DNA using terminal transferase allowed its cloning into the vector PAT 153, which had been cut at the Pstl site and tailed with G residues. The vector-c-DNA mixture was then transformed into competent E. coli (strain MC1061) and plated onto tetracycline-containing plates.

The sequence of gene 11 from the UKtc strain has been determined (Ward et al., 1985) and therefore the sequence of segment X can be compared with it. If the duplication is disregarded and the two sequences compared (Fig. 3 ), then at the nucleotide level there is 92% sequence conservation.

In the case of the original observations made in human virus isolates from immunodeficient children (Pedley et al., 1984) and some of the bovine isolates generated by high multiplicity passage in tissue culture (Hundley et al., 1985) , this has been shown to involve covalent concatemerisation of rotavirus segments. The isolate studied here was interesting in being the first natural isolate that has been adapted to routine growth in tissue culture and therefore could be analysed in detail. The original work of Pocock (1987) on the isolate showed that despite the absence of a normal genome segment 11, the virus was not defective. Also when transcripts of segment X were translated in an in vitro translation system they were found to encode a protein that co-migrated with VP11 (Pocock, 1987) the only protein product identified to date as being coded for by RNA segment 11 (McCrae and McCorquodale, 1982a) . The sequence analysis carried out on segment X in this study has provided an explanation for these observations. Thus the sequence rearrangement that has occurred has no effect on the protein coding potential of the 5' copy of segment 11, the fusion having taken place within the normal termination codon for VPll, thereby changing it from UAG to UGA. The 3' copy of segment 11 in the rearrangement begins at nucleotide 40/41 of the normal gene sequence. This is downstream of the initiation codon for VP11 (nucleotides 22-24) and therefore this copy of the coding sequence cannot give rise to protein.",
