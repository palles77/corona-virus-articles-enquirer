This study aimed to assess the viral and bacterial causes of ARI morbidity and mortality in children under 5 years in Senegal. Nasopharyngeal samples were collected from children under 5 years who had ARI. Viruses and bacteria were identified using multiplex real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and conventional biochemical techniques, respectively. Adenovirus was the most prevalent virus (50%; n = 81), followed by influenza virus (45.68%, n = 74), rhinovirus (40.12%; n = 65), enterovirus (25.31%; n = 41), and respiratory syncytial virus (16.05%; n = 26), whereas Streptococcus pneumoniae (17%; n = 29), Moraxella catarrhalis (15.43%; n = 25), and Haemophilus influenzae (8.02%; n = 13) were the most commonly isolated bacteria. Virus pathogens seem more likely to be more prevalent in our settings and were often associated with bacteria and S. pneumoniae (6%; 16) coinfection.",

            "text": "Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) such as acute otitis media, sinusitis, bronchitis, and community-acquired pneumonia are a leading cause of infectious disease-related morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality among children worldwide, particularly in low-income countries. 1 According to World Health Organization (WHO), the prevalence of hospitalized children under 5 years with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) is estimated to be 20% and 90% of those were due to pneumonia. 2 In addition, the number of childhood deaths annually related to ARIs is very important and is estimated between 1.9 and 2.2 million, and 70% of the deaths took place in Africa and Southeast Asia which are the most. 1, 3 Bacteria and viruses have been reported as the main causes of ARIs. In children under 5 years, ARIs are caused mainly due to viruses; respiratory syncytial viruses (RSVs), parainfluenza viruses, influenza virus A and B, and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) are the most common viruses isolated. 4, 5 However, primary infections with viral pathogens can predispose to secondary bacterial infections, and the most frequently isolated bacteria in ARIs include Streptococcus pneumonia and Haemophilus influenzae. 6 These bacteria were increasingly resistant to the most commonly used antibiotics for ARI treatment, 7 leading to increase in mortality rates, hospital durations, and health care-associated costs. 8 In resource-limited countries, bacteria have been the main cause of ARIs. This could be explained by the inaccessibility of molecular diagnostic tools thus leading to inadequate antibiotics prescription and consequently contributed to a rapid increase in antimicrobial resistance among bacteria causing RTIs. 9, 10 In Senegal, few studies on viral and bacterial etiologies of RTIs are available in pediatric settings. Respiratory tract infections are mainly empirically treated with antibiotics on a simple suspicion of bacterial infection. Indeed, this could be one of the major causes of high morbidity and mortality rates.",

            "text": "In Senegal, adenovirus was the most common pathogen detected from ARIs in children. This study confirms previous results reported between 2013 and 2015 in Senegal by Niang et al. 14 The overall detection rate of adenovirus was 50% among the 162 selected children. This adenovirus infection prevalence seems very high compared with rates documented from other countries, namely, Ghana, 15 Burkina, 10 and Zambia. 9 However, our results are in agreement with data reported in Cameroon. Overall, this confirms the overall high prevalence of adenovirus ARI in Africa. 16 In addition to adenovirus, influenza virus, rhinovirus, and enterovirus are the most common viruses detected, as reported in other studies. 10, 17 Our study revealed viral codetection is frequent in ARIs. Similar results were found in other countries. 9,10,15 Viral codetection in clinical settings is becoming more common since the introduction of molecular-based multiplex tests. Although the clinical significance of these findings remains unclear, this seems to have no impact in disease severity. 18 In this study, we also found that ARIs were associated with bacterial pathogens; among those, S. pneumoniae (17.9%), M. catarrhalis (15.43%), and H. influenzae (8%) were the most common. In contrast with our findings, high rate (56%) of S. pneumoniae detection was observed in Niger among children having ARIs. 13 In our study, prevalence of mono-infections with S. pneumoniae (2%), M. catarrhalis (2%), or H. influenzae (1%) was very low. Thus, this low prevalence of bacterial pathogens in ARIs proves that antibiotics should no longer be systematically used in the treatment of ARIs. However, among low-prevalence bacterial isolates, codetections with viruses were more frequent and S. pneumoniae (16, 6%) coinfection was the most frequent in our findings. Similar results were reported in other studies. 19, 20 There results highlight the pivotal role of viruses in ARIs because primary infection with viral pathogens can predispose children to subsequent bacterial infections. 21 Our study has limitations; among others, the sample size which does not really allow to determine the direct association between viral or bacterial infection and disease severity. Moreover, a case-control study would be more suitable to determine the exact role of viruses in ARIs pathogenesis.",
