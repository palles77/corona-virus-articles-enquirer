We evaluated the prevalence of MERS coronavirus (CoV) immunoglobulin (Ig) G in HCWs exposed to MERS patients and calculated the incidence of MERS-affected cases in HCWs. We enrolled HCWs from hospitals where confirmed MERS patients had visited. Serum was collected 4 to 6 weeks after the last contact with a confirmed MERS patient. We performed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to screen for the presence of MERS-CoV IgG and an indirect immunofluorescence test (IIFT) to confirm MERS-CoV IgG. We used a questionnaire to collect information regarding the exposure. We calculated the incidence of MERS-affected cases by dividing the sum of PCR-confirmed and serology-confirmed cases by the number of exposed HCWs in participating hospitals. In total, 1169 HCWs in 31 hospitals had contact with 114 MERS patients, and among the HCWs, 15 were PCR-confirmed MERS cases in study hospitals. Serologic analysis was performed for 737 participants. ELISA was positive in five participants and borderline for seven. IIFT was positive for two (0.3%) of these 12 participants. Among the participants who did not use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), seropositivity was 0.7% (2/294) compared to 0% (0/ 443) in cases with appropriate PPE use. The incidence of MERS infection in HCWs was 1.5% (17/1169). The seroprevalence of MERS-CoV IgG among HCWs was higher among participants who did not use appropriate PPE. C.-J. Kim, CMI 2016;22:880 ",

However, that year, the largest single-nation outbreak outside of Saudi Arabia occurred in South Korea over 45 days, with 186 confirmed MERS patients including 38 deaths (http://www.mers.go.kr/mers/html/ jsp/Menu_C/list_C4.jsp) [7] .

One previous study reported that 25% of MERS coronavirus (CoV) PCR-positive patients were asymptomatic, and among these, 64% were HCWs [3] . Moreover, the period in which MERS-CoV is present in respiratory specimens is unknown because the virus shedding mechanism is still ambiguous even in confirmed MERS patients, and the PCR positivity rate of asymptomatic patients remains unknown. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the seroprevalence of MERS-CoV IgG in HCWs exposed to MERS patients and to calculate the incidence of MERS affected cases in HCWs.

In general, isolation gown and gloves are recommended as a contact precaution, and surgical mask is recommended as a droplet precaution [16] . Although MERS is known to be transmitted by droplet and by direct contact, use of appropriate PPE, including an N95 respirator and an isolation gown, has been emphasized in preventing MERS infection (http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/ downloads/MERS-Infection-Control-Guidance-051414.pdf) [11e13]. In our study, only participants who were exposed to MERS patients without appropriate PPE had IgG antibody against MERS-CoV. This was also found in PCR-confirmed MERS-infected HCWs. Among the 39 PCR-confirmed MERS-infected HCWs (http://www.mers.go.kr/ mers/html/jsp/Menu_C/list_C4.jsp) [10] , we reviewed the 15 patients who were affiliated with our study's participating hospitals (data not shown). We found that 14 of these patients were exposed without using an N95 respirator. Therefore, in our participating hospitals, almost all MERS-infected HCWs were related to not using appropriate PPE. There were two exceptional cases; they had used isolation gowns and N95 respirators following the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines (http://www.cdc.gov/ coronavirus/mers/downloads/MERS-Infection-Control-Guidance-051414.pdf), but they were eventually infected with MERS. Both were exposed to AGP, intubation of a MERS patient (seropositive case in our study) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation of a MERS patient (PCR-confirmed MERS case). Although the fitting test was not performed in either case, we guess that the N95 respirator is less efficient in AGP for high-virus-burden patients. Consequently, appropriate use of PPE is important in protection of MERS, and when performing AGP, more efficient respirators might be necessary [11] .",

In their study, however, the IIFT was well correlated with the neutralization assay. Their report showed that ELISA alone was useful in screening for the presence of MERS-CoV IgG but not in confirming it, whereas the IIFT could substitute the neutralization assay. In another recent report, the correlation of MERS-CoV ELISA and neutralization assay was strong in PCRconfirmed MERS patients [18] .
