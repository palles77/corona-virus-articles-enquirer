Serum amyloid A (SAA) and haptoglobin (Hp) are APPs that are produced during inflammation, and likely play a role in host immunological defence against Eimeria infection and the associated intestinal tissue damage. We investigated the involvement of SAA and HP in an experimental study, including three groups of calves: a control group (group 0, n = 11), and two groups infected with either 150,000 or 250,000 Eimeria zuernii oocysts (group 1 (n = 11) and group 2 (n = 12), respectively). The calves were monitored for 28 days and data was collected on oocyst excretion, faecal score, animal weight, and SAA and Hp serum concentrations. Generalized linear mixed models showed that the clinical symptoms, indicated by an increase in the number of oocysts in the faeces and severe diarrhoea, manifested at patency for group 1 and 2. Serum Hp and SAA levels also increased during this period. Hp appeared to be a more sensitive marker than SAA, and differences between groups 1 and 2 were observed only for Hp. Linear regression models showed a negative association between weight gain and Hp concentrations, calculated as the area under the curve (AUC) during the overall experimental period and the patency period. A similar result was seen for SAA only during the patency period. This result supports the assumption that reduced weight gain due to E. zuernii infection is an immunologically driven process that involves an increase in APPs. A random intercept regression model of oocyst shedding groups showed that calves shedding 1-500 oocysts had reduced concentrations of Hp, indicating that a different immunological reaction occurs during mild shedding of E. zuernii oocysts than during more intensive shedding. A similar model was used to examine associations between faecal scores and Hp concentrations for each group. Group 2 calves with haemorrhagic diarrhoea displayed higher Hp levels than calves in that group with lower faecal scores, which may be in response to an increased demand for Hp in the repair process as a result of haemolysis. APPs seem to play an important role in determining the course of E. zuernii infection in calves, which may enhance our understanding of the immunological reaction and development of this disease.",

Early in infections, or during tissue damage, pro-inflammatory cytokines are released: IFN-\u2425 and IL-6 from affected cells and TNF-\u2423 and IL-1\u2424 from mononuclear cells (van Miert, 1995; Heinrich et al., 1990) . When cytokines reach the liver, they stimulate the hepatocytes to release acute phase proteins (APPs) into the blood stream (Heinrich et al., 1990) . APPs circulate in the blood and help to stabilize the internal environment and speed the healing process (Cray et al., 2009) . In response to inflammation, APPs may increase (positive APP) or decrease (negative APP) plasma protein levels. APPs in cattle include serum amyloid A (SAA) and haptoglobin (Hp).",

After a sporulated oocyst has excysted in the gut, the parasite undergoes several asexual and sexual cycles of invasion and destruction of the intestinal cells. Eimeriosis due to Eimeria (E.) zuernii manifests as massive tissue damage accompanied by the release of oocysts 2-3 weeks after infection (Daugschies and Najdrowski, 2005) . Changes in APP profiles may serve as a useful tool for estimating the health of calves by determining of the impact of pathogens, such as Eimeria, in the clinical and subclinical stages, and may potentially serve as a tool for prognosis of the severity of disease (Hashemnia et al., 2011) .",

Interference of E. coli K99 and Giardia were excluded at the onset of diarrhoea, or 18 day post infection (dpi) for controls, using antigen tests (FASTest E. coli K99 strip, and FASTest GIARDIA strip, Megacor, Hoerbranz, Austria) . Samples taken simultaneously with the antigen tests were investigated to confirm absence of Cryptosporidium spp. using a carbol fuchsin staining technique (Heine 1982) . Calves were kept under the same housing conditions (same feed, two calves per pen, same stable, and air-conditioned rooms). The infective material was isolated from a commercial farm, passaged in calves by experimental infection before use and determined to be comprised of greater than 97% E. zuernii oocysts and less than 3% Eimeria ellipsoidalis oocysts. Blood samples were collected in vacuum tubes (Vacuette\u00ae serum clot activator tubes, Greiner bio-one, Kremsmuenster, Austria) on days 0, 1, 3, 7, 9, 12, and 14-28. Blood was drawn from all animals during the experimental period, except on days 3 and 9, upon which 10 and 30 calves were sampled, respectively. Faecal samples (50-100 g) were collected on the sampling days by digital stimulation of the anus. The consistency was scored as: (1) normal to pasty, (2) semiliquid to liquid, (3) watery, and (4) haemorrhagic and/or with tissue according to Mundt et al. (2005) . Oocyst excretion was determined using the quantitative McMaster method, as described previously (Thienpont et al., 1990; Bangoura and Daugschies, 2007b) .",

The observed increase in oocyst numbers in the faeces and increasing faecal scores from day 15 onwards in this study correlated well with the known clinical characteristics of eimeriosis (Fig. 1S ). According to this study, a difference of 100,000 E. zuernii oocysts between group 1 and 2 resulted in differences in faecal oocyst concentrations and faecal consistency scores on specific days, but differences in the overall patterns during the experiment period were only borderline significant. Holst and Svensson (1994) previously explored fibrinogen (Fb) as an APP in the blood during experimental and natural infection with Eimeria alabamensis, but had only limited success. To our knowledge, our study is the first to examine the relationship between Hp and SAA levels and experimental infections with Eimeria in cattle, although studies on SAA and Hp levels in response to Eimeria infection have been performed in rabbits and goats. Rabbits infected with 10,000 Eimeria stiedai oocysts were reported by Freitas et al. (2011) to exhibit increased APP concentrations of ceruloplasmin, transferrin and Hp from 7 to 28 days post-infection. Infection of goat kids with 1,000 or 100,000 sporulated Eimeria arloingi oocysts was also reported to increase blood levels of Hp and SAA (Hashemnia et al., 2011) .",

This result supports the theory that the reduced weight gain commonly observed during eimeriosis is the result of an immunological reaction that coincides with the production of Hp and SAA at the time of clinical disease manifestation. Arthington et al. (2005) demonstrated previously the association between higher APP levels and reduced weight gain in beef calves, and studies in growing pigs demonstrated a negative relationship between Hp concentrations and body weight gain (Hiss and Sauerwein, 2003; Sauerwein et al., 2005) . The negative association between APPs and weight gain could be explained by a decrease in food intake due to the effect of pro-inflammatory cytokines on the central nervous system (Langhans and Hrupka, 1999) . Alternatively, it could result from enhanced catabolism of body tissues (Webel et al., 1997) . In experimental infection of goat kids with E. arloingi (Hashemnia et al., 2011) , in both infection groups, SAA concentrations and increased levels of TNF-\u2423 and IFN-\u2425 were associated. This further supports the hypothesis that APPs and weight gain are associated via the action of pro-inflammatory cytokines during infection.",

The concentrations of Hp increased as predicted, but only in group 2, and a dosedependent difference between group 1 and 2 was observed for Hp ( Fig. 1) . Interestingly, the concentration of Hp also appeared to decline near the end of the 2-week patent period when the faecal oocyst excretion also declined. This supports the hypothesis of a relationship between the release of oocysts, resulting in tissue damage, the production of APPs, and inappetence, resulting in weight loss. However, changes in SAA concentrations during infection showed no clear association between the control group and group 1, or between the infection groups. At the same time, considerable fluctuations in SAA concentrations were observed during the prepatent period (Fig. 1 ), but generally above the reported median value (32 mg/l, min-max 2-150 mg/l) for calves above 14 days of age using the same assay (Sepp\u00e4-Lassila et al., 2013) . The different patterns of Hp and SAA concentrations observed in this study could be a reflection of the distinctive cytokine response of calves to E. zuernii infection, such as TNF-\u2423, IL-1 and IL-6 that are predominant pro-inflammatory cytokines that stimulate the hepatic synthesis of APPs (Baumann and Gauldie, 1994; Alsemgeest et al., 1996) .",

Calves exhibit elevated concentrations of SAA, but not Hp, during the first 3 weeks after birth . The differences observed between calves infected with 250,000 oocysts compared to non-infected calves may be best explained by the naturally occuring changes in SAA early in the calves life. This appear to coinciding with the the timing of the prepatent period in the experiment, and less likely to be due to a rise in SAA concentrations in infection groups.",

It is possible that mild Eimeria infections causing less severe tissue damage may interact differently with the local immune response than massive infections associated with more severe tissue destruction. In the case of mild disease, APPs may be used locally to limit infection and initiate the repair process, leading to a transient systemic reduction in APP levels, while more severe damage may initiate a systemic up-regulation of APPs. The main function of Hp is binding of free haemoglobin (Eaton et al., 1982) , and increased consumption of circulating Hp will increase during haemolysis. This may also be reflected by the observed reduction in Hp concentrations when less than 500 OPG were shed by calves, resembling mild tissue damage, but not for calves shedding more than 500 OPG. When more severe tissue damage occurs, stronger inflammatory stimulus will up-regulate the hepatic synthesis of Hp, and systemic concentrations will increase despite higher consumption of Hp due to haemorrhage. Higher levels of Hp, above the previously reported reference value for calves up to 2 months of age (<196 mg/l) (Sepp\u00e4-Lassila et al., 2013) , were observed in haemorrhagic and diarrheic faeces in calves infected with 250,000 E. zuernii oocysts compared to calves in the same group with other faecal scores (Fig. 2) . The presence of blood in the diarrhoea of calves with E. zuernii infection indicates tissue damage as a consequence of the release of oocysts that expose and potentially rupture intestinal capillaries (Blaxter and Wood, 1958) . It is possible that the additional fluid loss, loss of haemoglobin, and presence of an acute inflammatory reaction due to haemorrhage increases the demand for Hp to speed up the repair of the tissue, resulting in the observed rise in Hp.",
