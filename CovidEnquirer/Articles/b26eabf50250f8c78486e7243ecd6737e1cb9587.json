Materials and methods: HRCT findings and clinical course were studied in 13 hospital-treated NE patients. Chest radiograph findings were studied in 12 of them. Results: Twelve patients (92%) showed lung parenchymal abnormalities in HRCT, while only 8 had changes in their chest radiography. Atelectasis, pleural effusion, intralobular and interlobular septal thickening were the most common HRCT findings. Ground-glass opacification (GGO) was seen in 4 and hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy in 3 patients. Atelectasis and pleural effusion were also mostly seen in chest radiographs, other findings only in HRCT. Conclusion: Almost every NE patient showed lung parenchymal abnormalities in HRCT. The most common findings of lung involvement in NE can be defined as accumulation of pleural fluid and atelectasis and intralobular and interlobular septal thickening, most profusely in the lower parts of the lung. As a novel finding, lymphadenopathy was seen in a minority, probably related to capillary leakage and overall fluid overload. Pleural effusion is not the prominent feature in other viral pneumonias, whereas intralobular and interlobular septal thickening are characteristic of other viral pulmonary infections as well. Lung parenchymal findings in HRCT can thus be taken not to be disease-specific in NE and HRCT is useful only for scientific purposes.",

NE is prevalent in Scandinavia, European Russia, Balkans, and also in many parts of Western Europe [1] .

The histological picture is characterized by intersitium and airspace edema, mild to moderate interstitial infiltrates of lymphocytes, and epithelial necrosis with destruction of alveolar pneumocytes and hyaline membranes [15] . Two case reports about high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) findings in HCPS were published [17, 18] . HRCT demonstrated extensive bilateral GGO most severe in the middle and lower lung zones. Also noted were a few slightly thickened interlobular septa, a few poorly defined small nodules, bronchial wall thickening and small bilateral pleural effusion [17] . In the other case report \"crazy paving\" pattern was also seen [18] .",

In a study with 10-dengue hemorrhagic fever patients who underwent sonography and chest radiography, sonography detected pleural effusion in all 10, whereas radiography detected it only in 3 cases [25] .

To the best of our knowledge, lung HRCT findings have not previously been systematically studied in NE. CT scans and chest radiographs of the lungs have been examined in a Swedish prospective study involving 19 patients with acute NE [6] . CT revealed pulmonary infiltrates and/or pleural effusion in 10 (53%) patients and in 2 of them abnormalities were shown only by CT [6] . Patients with pathologic lung findings evinced a more pronounced inflammatory response, as measured by CRP and blood leukocyte count, than did those yielding normal findings. HRCT is more accurate than CT and much more accurate than chest radiography, and parenchymal findings are easier to detect with HRCT, which would explain the difference.",

We assume that the interstitial infiltrates previously seen in NE patient chest radiographs are the same finding as intralobular and interlobular septal thickening in HRCT. Also in the present study HRCT parenchymal findings, intralobular and interlobular septal thickening or GGO, were not seen in chest radiographs. In the previous case report about HRCT findings in HCPS, chest radiograph showed minimal bilateral hazy increased opacification and small bilateral pleural effusion but HRCT demonstrated extensive bilateral GGO and also few slightly thickened interlobular septa, a few poorly defined small nodules, bronchial wall thickening and small bilateral pleural effusion [17] . In the other case report \"crazy paving\" pattern was also seen [18] , such kind of finding was not seen in our study. Septal thickening is early stage finding in interstitial edema and GGO can be seen in alveolar edema, otherwise typical pulmonary edema findings were not seen in our study.",

This is interesting because the respiratory tract is probably the transmission route and the primary site of replication for Puumala virus and other Hantaviruses [21] . Hilar adenopathy is variable in viral diseases, being common in measles pneumonia and infectious mononucleosis but rare with other viral pneumonias [9] . Hilar and mediastinal lymphadepathy may be seen, usually accompanied by pulmonary parenchymal involvement, and not uncommonly by pleural effusions [27] . In the other study mediastinal lymphadenopathy may also associate with subacute congestive heart failure [28] . In the present study, all three patients having adenopathy had pleural effusion, and two of them had also pericardial fluid. Thus the pathogenesis of adenopathy may be related to Puumala virus-induced capillary leakage and overall fluid overload.",

Due to limited number of patients no significant difference in reading was expected and therefore we used consensus reading. The multislice-CT scanner was not used and the CT slices were thick. Further, the most severe oliguric phase of the NE disease did not coincide optimally with the time of CT examination. In the future a study with higher number of patients and more precise correlation of lung HRCT findings with patients' clinical findings could show, if pathological HRCT findings are caused by capillary leakage due to virus-associated endothelial damage or by fluid volume overload induced by ARF.",

As a novel finding, lymphadenopathy was seen in the minority, probably as a consequence of capillary leakage and overall fluid overload. Based on this HRCT study and our previous chest radiograph studies, [7, 8] lung parenchymal findings can be taken not to be disease-specific in NE, and HRCT is useful only for scientific purposes. Hantavirus infection should be considered as one possible differential diagnosis of patients who present with acute febrile illness and ARF of an unknown origin and with nonspecific radiologic findings.",
