Initially, an SGT gene, designated as OsSGT1, was isolated from O. saundersiae. OsSGT1-containing cell free extract was then used as the biocatalyst to react with 49 structurally diverse drug-like compounds. The recombinant OsSGT1 was shown to be active against both 3\u03b2-and 17\u03b2-hydroxyl steroids. Unexpectedly, in an effort to identify OsSGT1, we found the bacteria lacA gene in lac operon actually encoded an SGA, specifically catalyzing the acetylations of sugar moieties of steroid 17\u03b2-glucosides. Finally, a novel enzymatic two-step synthesis of two ASGs, acetylated testosterone-17-O-\u03b2-glucosides (AT-17\u03b2-Gs) and acetylated estradiol-17-O-\u03b2-glucosides (AE-17\u03b2-Gs), from the abundantly available free steroids using OsSGT1 and EcSGA1 as the biocatalysts was developed. The two-step process is characterized by EcSGA1-catalyzed regioselective acylations of all hydroxyl groups on the sugar unit of unprotected steroidal glycosides (SGs) in the late stage, thereby significantly streamlining the synthetic route towards ASGs and thus forming four monoacylates. The improved cytotoxic activities of 3 0 -acetylated testosterone17-O-\u03b2-glucoside towards seven human tumor cell lines were thus observable.",

The resulting steroidal glycoside esters (SGEs) exhibit a wide variety of biological activities, like cholesterol-lowering effect 2 , anti-diabetic properties 3 , anti-complementary activity 4 , immunoregulatory functions 5, 6 and anti-cancer actions [7] [8] [9] , which made ASGs promising compounds with pharmaceutical potential. Numerous methods, including direct extraction 9 , chemical synthesis 10, 11 and biosynthesis 12 , have been developed to synthesize these acylated steroidal glycosides. Direct extraction from varied organisms is one of the main methods to obtain ASGs [7] [8] [9] . However, the content of ASGs was usually low in natural sources [7] [8] [9] . Moreover, the extraction routes were highly time-consuming and required laborious purification procedures [7] [8] [9] 13 , resulting in poor yields and/or low purity of the final products. The production of ASGs was also achieved by chemical synthesis previously [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . However, these efforts often encounter a fundamental challenge, namely, regioselective acylation of single hydroxyl group of unprotected SGs in the late stage of the chemical synthesis of ASGs. SGs generally possess multiple hydroxyl groups with similar reactivity. Regioselective acylation of a particular one of multiple hydroxyl groups generally requires multi-step protection/deprotection procedures, which makes the synthetic pathway of these SGEs costly, wasteful, long and timeconsuming, and results in low yield in the end.",

Hence, the successful gene isolation and functional characterization of SGAs have become a prominent challenge for bioproduction of ASGs. Herein, the functional characterizations of a plant-derived SGT with activity against both 3\u03b2-and 17\u03b2-hydroxyl steroids, and a bacterial SGA, as well as their application in the biosynthesis of ASGs are reported.

Unexpectedly, in an effort to identify the function of OsSGT1, we characterized LacA protein (designated as EsSGA1) from E. coli as a SGA, catalyzing testosterone-17-O\u03b2-glucoside (T-17\u03b2-G) and estradiol-17-O-\u03b2-glucoside (E-17\u03b2-G) to form corresponding acylates.

The cytotoxic activities of these monoacylates were evaluated against seven human tumor cell lines (HCT116, Bel7402, MGC803, Capan2, NCI-H460, NCI-H1650 and A549) and 3 0 -acetylated testosterone17-O-\u03b2-glucoside was observed to display improved cytotoxic activity against these seven cell lines (Scheme 1).",

O. saundersiae is thus selected as the candidate plant for SGTs isolation. The transcriptome of O. saundersiae was thus sequenced with the aim of isolating genes encoding SGTs. A total of 92,995,146 raw reads were generated after the transcriptome sequencing of O. saundersiae. After removal of dirty reads with adapters, unknown or low quality bases, a total of 82,518,740 clean reads were retained. These clean reads were combined by assembling soft trinity to form longer unigenes. Finally, an RNA-seq database containing 107,084 unigenes with mean length of 766 bp was obtained. Next, these unigenes were aligned to publicly available protein databases for functional annotations, retrieving unigenes displaying the highest sequence similarity with SGTs. Unigene 32070 with 2182 bp in length was thus retrieved from the unigene database for its high similarity with SGTs ( Supplementary Information Fig.  S1 ). Moreover, ORF Finder result showed that this unigene contained a complete open reading frame (ORF) of 1773 bp, starting at nucleotide 99 with an ATG start codon and ending at position 1871 with a TGA stop codon. The unigene contained 98 bp of 5 0 -UTR (untranslated region) and 311 bp of 3 0 -UTR. Therefore, unigene 32070 was selected for further investigation.",

The amplicon was then inserted into pEASY TM -Blunt plasmid (Supplementary Information Table S2 ) to form a recombinant vector for sequencing. Results indicated that the amplified product was 100% identity with that of unigene 32070, confirming unigene 32070 was a bona fide gene in O. saundersiae genome. The 1773bp ORF encoded a polypeptide of 590 amino acids (aa) with a predicted molecular mass of 64.61 kDa and pI of 6.16.

Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) indicated that most of the expressed OsSGT1 protein was present in the form of insoluble inclusion body, which was regarded to be devoid of bioactivity.

Each member of the acceptor library (1-49, Fig. 1B and Supplementary Information Fig. S4 ) was first assessed as sugar Table S3 ). Of the 49 substrates, only 10 steroids were observed to be glucosylated by OsSGT1, forming corresponding monoglucosides (Figs. 1-3 and Supplementary Information Figs. S5-14) . The ten steroids included seven 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroids (1-7, Supplementary Information Figs. S5-11), two 17\u03b2-hydroxylsteroids (8-9, Figs. 2 and 3) and one 3\u03b2,17\u03b2-dihydroxysteroid (10, Supplementary Information Fig. S14 ). The reaction activities of OsSGT1 towards the ten substrates indicated that OsSGT1 was an SGT showing activities towards both 3\u03b2-and 17\u03b2-hydroxysteroids, consistent with the predicted result by bioinformatics analyses (Supplementary Information Figs. S1 and S3). In fact, the reports of SGTs with glycosylation activity against steroids at positions other than C-3 were limited and only three SGTs from yeast were verified to exhibit selectivity towards both 3\u03b2-and 17\u03b2-hydroxylsteroids 17 . OsSGT1 was therefore viewed as the first plant SGT with selectivity towards both 3\u03b2-and 17\u03b2-hydroxylsteroids (Figs. 2 and 3 and Supplementary Information Figs. S5-14) . However, the glycosylation activity of OsSGT1 towards 17\u03b2hydroxyl group would be lost if additional hydroxyl group at 2\u03b2-(2\u03b2-OH-testosterone, 13), 15\u03b2-(15\u03b2-OH-testosterone, 14), 16\u03b2-(16\u03b2-OH-testosterone, 15), or 16\u03b1-position (16\u03b1-OH-testosterone, 16) , even a methyl group at C17-position (methyltestosterone and its derivatives, 17-20) was attached to testosterone (8), generating not any glycosylated products. Moreover, OsSGT1 has no activity towards other compounds, including steroids without 3\u03b2-and 17\u03b2-hydroxyl groups (11-12 and 21-24) , flavonoids (25-31), alkaloids (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) , triterpenoids (39-42), phenolic acids (43-47) and coumarins (48-49) as shown in Supplementary Information Fig. S4 .",

This bacterial strain contains at least 35 putative acetyltransferase genes, in which lacA, maa and wecH, were predicted to encode O-acetyltransferase (Supplementary Information Table S15 ). As shown in Supplementary Information Fig. S56 , further sequence analyses revealed WecH protein was a membrane-bound protein with a total of 10 membrane-spanning helixes, inconsistent with the above results, in which the candidate acetyltransferase was determined to be a soluble protein in bacterial lysate. LacA and Maa proteins were predicted to have no transmembrane helixes, suggesting their soluble form in bacterial. Thus, the remaining two genes, lacA and maa, were further investigated. First, the entire ORFs of the two genes were isolated from bacterial genome using gene-specific primers (Supplementary Information Fig. S57A and Table S1 ). The ORFs of lacA and maa genes were 612 and 552 bp encoding polypeptides of 203 and 183 aa, respectively. The predicted molecular weights of the two proteins were 22.77 and 20.1 kDa. The two genes were then inserted into pET-28a(\u00fe) to generate two recombinant vectors, which were introduced into BL21(DE3) for heterologous expression. After isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) induction, the accumulation of approximately 23 or 20 kDa was observed in the lysate of bacterial strain harboring pET28a-lacA or pET28a-maa (Supplementary Information Fig. S57B ). Moreover, the presence of bacterially-expressed His-LacA or His-Maa fusion protein in the bacterial lysate was verified by Western-blot with anti-His antibody ( Supplementary  Information Fig. S57C ). The expressed LacA or Maa protein was then purified to near homogeneity by affinity chromatography ( Supplementary Information Fig. S57B ).",

It is generally accepted that hydrolases and acyltransferases are two classes of enzymes responsible for acylation reactions of SGs 22 . The enzymatic acylations reported now are largely performed by hydrolases like lipases 22 . On the other hand, not any genes encoding SGAs are isolated up to date 16, 22 . EcSGA1 is therefore regarded as the first steroidal glycoside acyltransferase catalyzing the attachment of acyl groups into the hydroxyl groups of steroidal 17\u03b2-glycosides, to our knowledge. Also, EcSGA1 was observed to catalyze another steroidal 17\u03b2glycoside, E-17\u03b2-G (9a), to form corresponding acylate (9b, Fig. 5, upper panel) . On the other hand, the other glucosides listed in Supplementary Information Fig. S58 could not be acetylated by EcSGA1, testifying EcSGA1 was specific to steroidal 17\u03b2-glycosides.",

Next, the 100 \u03bcL screening scale of OsSGT1-catalyzed glycosylation reaction was scaled to 53 mL scale, in which 152 mg testosterone (8) were glycosylated to form 61 mg T-17\u03b2-G (8a) under optimized conditions (Scheme 1). The resultant T-17\u03b2-G (8a) was subsequently used as the substrate applied in the scale-up of the whole-cell system of BL21(DE3)[pET28a-EsSGA1] (135 mL) under optimized pH 5.0 and 40 1C. The resulting reaction mixture was subjected to high-performance liquid chromatography-solid phase extraction-NMR spectroscopy (HPLC-SPE-NMR) measurement. Comparison of the 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra of 8c-8e with those of 8b suggested that compounds 8c-8e had the same framework as 8b and the structural difference might be the position of the acetyl group. The location of acetyl group was determined to be at C-2 0 based on the HMBC correlations between H-2 0 (\u03b4 4.68) and C-1\" (\u03b4 170.3) as shown in Supplementary  Information Fig. S63 . Thus, compound 8c was assigned as 2 0 -AT-17\u03b2-G. The isolated glucose proton at \u03b4 4.91 (H-3 0 ) of compound 8d exhibited long-range correlations with carbonyl carbons at \u03b4 172.7 ( Supplementary Information Fig. S64 ). Moreover, H-4 0 (\u03b4 4.73) of compound 8e showed long-range Table S3 ). Lower panel, HPLC profile of acetylated products of 9a separated by chromatogramic method (Supplementary Information Table S3 ). correlations with C-1\" (\u03b4 170.7), as revealed by the HMBC spectrum ( Supplementary Information Fig. S65 ). These data supported that the structure of 8d and 8e was elucidated as 3 0 -AT-17\u03b2-G and 4 0 -AT-17\u03b2-G, respectively. Hence, the three trace products at t R \u00bc 18.243, 19.013 and 23.680 min were thus assigned to be 3 0 -(8d), 4 0 -(8e) and 2 0 -AT-17\u03b2-G (8c) based on their respective NMR data (Tables 3-5 and Supplementary  Information Figs. S63-77) . These data indicate that EcSGA1 can effectively introduce the acetyl group into the primary hydroxyl group and each secondary hydroxyl group of T-17\u03b2-G (8a), yielding four monoacylates without the formation of diacylates ( Fig. 4 and Scheme 1). Because the primary C(6 0 )-OH was the most reactive of the four hydroxyl groups in T-17\u03b2-G (8a), acetylation of T-17\u03b2-G (8a) took place preferentially at the C (6 0 )-OH, giving 6 0 -O-acylate predominantly in 82% yield ( Fig. 4 and Scheme 1). Also, EcSGA1 can regioselectively acetylate each secondary hydroxyl of T-17\u03b2-G (8a) in the presence of the primary hydroxyl group, giving 2 0 -(8c), 3 0 -(8d) and 4 0 -AT-17\u03b2-G (8e) in 8%, 6% and 4% yield, respectively. These data revealed the reactivity trend of hydroxyls is 6 0 -OH4 42 0 -OH43 0 -OH44 0 -OH.",

However, according to the catalytic behavior of EcSGA1 towards T-17\u03b2-G (8a), it was easy to infer that these products were most likely 2 0 -(9c, t R \u00bc 14.513 min), 3 0 -(9d, t R \u00bc 13.873 min) and 4 0 -AE-17\u03b2-G (9e, t R \u00bc 14.213 min, Fig. 5 ). The order of reactivity of the hydroxyls was determined as 6 0 -OH442 0 -OH43 0 -OH4 4 0 -OH with a yield ratio of 80:10:6:4 (Fig. 5) . Regioselective acylation of one of the multiple hydroxyl groups in SGs is the major obstacle to the synthesis of SGEs and direct methods for site-selective acylation of unprotected SGs have rarely been documented. In this contribution, we successfully achieved the regioselective acylation of fully unprotected SGs using EcSGA1 as the biocatalyst, thereby leading to an extremely short-step synthesis of ASGs.",

There are two enzymes, namely SGTs and SGAs, responsible for the biosynthesis of ASGs. To synthesize ASGs, the primary premise is to obtain glycosyltransferases capable of catalyzing the formation of SGs from the abundantly available free steroids. O. saundersiae is thus selected as the candidate plant for SGTs isolation. O. saundersiae is a monocotyledonous plant rich in acylated steroidal glycosides, suggesting that it may contain SGTs and SGAs responsible for the biosynthesis of ASGs 23 . Thus, the transcriptome of O. saundersiae was sequenced with the aim to facilitate the genes discovery. OsSGT1 was then isolated from O. saundersiae based on the RNA-Seq data. Subsequently, OsSGT1-containing cell-free extract was used as the biocatalyst for glycosylations of 49 structurally diverse drug-like scaffolds. The use of cell-free extract offers a number of advantages. Unlike the ambitious purification procedures, the preparation of cell-free extract was simple and timesaving. Moreover, compared the purified enzymes, the recombinant proteins used in crude extract-based system were more stable. Steroidal glycosides are one of the main sources of innovative drugs 17 . SGT-catalyzed glycodiversification of steroids could expand the molecular diversification, thereby facilitating the discovery of pharmacological leads. Thus, the search of SGTs with catalytic promiscuity may provide potent biocatalysts for glycodiversification. Therefore, a library containing 49 structural diverse drug-like molecules was utilized to react with the recombinant OsSGT1 with the aim to explore the substrate flexibility of OsSGT1. In vitro enzymatic analyses revealed that OsSGT1 was active against various steroids, including physterols (1-3, Supplementary Information Figs. S5-7) , steroid hormones (4, 7-10, Figs. 2 and 3 , and Supplementary Information Figs. S8, S11 and S14), steroidal sapogenin (5, Supplementary Information  Fig. S9 ) and cardiac aglycon (6, Supplementary Information  Fig. S10) , exhibiting a wider substrate range than that of previously identified SGTs from plant 18, 24 .",

It is well known that lacA is one of three structural genes (lacZ, lacY and lacA) in lac operon 25, 26 . The function of LacZ and LacY is well-characterized 25, 26 . LacZ encodes a \u03b2galactosidase, catalyzing the cleavage of lactose into glucose and galactose. LacY encodes a lactose permease responsible for lactose uptake 25, 26 . The third structural protein encoded by lacA gene in lac operon was initially inferred to be an acetyltransferase. The exact action of this protein, however, remains in doubt until now. In this investigation, in an effort to identify the function of OsSGT1, we unexpectedly characterized LacA protein from E. coli as a SGA. In vitro enzymatic analyses revealed that LacA protein could specifically catalyze the attachment of acyl groups into the hydroxyl groups of sugar moieties of steroidal 17\u03b2- glycosides (Figs. 4 and 5) . Although we have no evidences for the role of LacA protein in vivo, these findings in the present work may provide a starting point for identifying the exact activity of LacA protein in lactose metabolism. The bottleneck in enzymatic synthesis of ASGs is the lack of well-characterized SGAs. The successful characterization of LacA made it to be the first SGA and LacA protein was thus designated as EcSGA1.",

The compounds listed in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Information Fig. S4 include diverse structures like steroids , flavonoids (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) , alkaloids (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) , triterpenoids (39-42), phenolic acids (43-47) and coumarins (48-49) are used as the sugar acceptors for OsSGT1-catalyzed glycosylation reactions ( Fig. 1 and Supplementary Information Fig. S4 ). The sugar donors consist of seven UDP-activated nucleotides, among which, UDP-Dglucose (UDP-Glc), UDP-D-galactose (UDP-Gal), UDP-D-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcA) and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Co., LLC. (St. Louis, MO, USA). UDP-D-xylose (UDP-Xyl), UDP-L-arabinose (UDP-Ara) and UDP-D-galacturonic acid (UDP-GalA) was synthesized by enzymemediated reactions in our laboratory [27] [28] [29] . The acyl acceptor library is made up of 10 steroidal glucosides (1a-10a) and 13 other glucosides (50-62) listed in Supplementary Information Fig. S58 . The acyl donor library includes acetyl-CoA, succinyl-CoA, arachidonoyl-CoA, palmitoyl-CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA, all of which were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co., LLC. The other chemicals were either reagent or analytic grade when available. ",

Next, these Oacetyltransferase-encoding genes were heterologously expressed in BL21(DE3) as described above. SDS-PAGE and Western-blot of these recombinant proteins were conducted as that of OsSGT1 (see above). The recombinant O-acetyltransferase proteins were subjected to purification with Ni-NTA agarose columns according to the manufacture's protocol.

In brief, total RNA was extracted from the frozen bulbs of O. saundersiae using TRIzol reagent (CWBIO Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The concentration, the RNA ratio of 28 S to 18 S and RNA integrity number (RIN) were evaluated using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The RNAs with RIN value Z8.5 were sent to BGI Tech Solutions Co., Ltd. for cDNA preparation and library construction.
