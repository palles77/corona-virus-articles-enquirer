Using a population-based telephone survey, 3011 Hong Kong Chinese adults were randomly assigned to one of the three disease conditions and were interviewed about their attitudes and beliefs towards the assigned disease. Findings showed that public stigma was the highest towards HIV/AIDS, followed by TB and SARS. Using multisample model structural equation modeling, we found that the attributions of controllability, personal responsibility, and blame were applicable in explaining stigma across three disease types. Knowledge about the disease had no significant effect on stigma. Participants with less stigmatizing views had significantly more favorable attitudes towards government policies related to the diseases. The study is an important attempt in understanding the attributional mechanisms of stigma towards infectious diseases. Implications for stigma reduction and promotion of public awareness and disease prevention are discussed. r",

Among the various infectious diseases, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and tuberculosis (TB) are important public health concerns in Hong Kong. Although their means of infection and disease course differ, they pose a health threat to the general public and are issues of concern for public health professionals in terms of preventing their spread, promoting public awareness, and educating the public about the diseases.

Among various infectious diseases, the stigma attached to HIV/AIDS has been the most blatant and widely studied (Crawford, 1996) . Over the decades, evidence has shown that individuals with or being suspected of having HIV/AIDS have been denied health care services and employment, refused entry to foreign countries, shunned by neighbors and co-workers, and experienced social disruptions with family members and friends (Crandall & Coleman, 1992; Herek, 1999) . Stigmatization towards individuals with TB has also been reported. Infected individuals are often regarded as dirty and their level of contagiousness is greatly exaggerated (Yamada, Caballero, Matsunaga, Agustin, & Magana, 1999) . Fear and isolation of individuals with TB is common, even among their families and friends (Jaramillo, 1999; Kelly, 1999) . Besides HIV/ AIDS and TB, stigma towards other infectious diseases such as SARS (Lee, Chan, Chau, Kwok, & Kleinman, 2005) , syphilis (Whitty, 1999) , and genital herpes (Breitkopf, 2004; Fortenberry, 2004) has also been documented. Generally speaking, stigma of infectious diseases can be as devastating to the infected individuals as the diseases themselves.",

Such attitudinal effects may impact resource allocation and direction of public health planning (Gilmore & Somerville, 1994; Goldin, 1994; Herek, Capitanio, & Widaman, 2003) . In other words, illness perceptions and perceived risks of infection can play an important role, sometimes more so than the actual disease itself, in shaping public responses to health care policies (Burris, 2000) . Previous studies have used some of these illness perceptions, including controllability, internality, behavioral causality, responsibility, blame, infection risk, severity, and incurability (Bos, Kok, & Dijker, 2001; Crandall & Moriarty, 1995; Dijker, Kok, & Koomen, 1996; Peters, den Boer, Kok, & Schaalma, 1994) to understand stigma towards AIDS and other physical diseases. Extending from this line of research, the present study used an attribution model to compare public stigma towards HIV/AIDS, SARS, and TB, and examined the effects of stigma on policy attitudes among the general public in Hong Kong.",

When the public regards contraction of the disease to be controllable by the individuals, the public is more likely to hold the infected individuals to be responsible for their own illness. Hence, the public is more likely to blame the individuals and reject them from society Corrigan, Markowitz, Watson, Rowan, & Kubiak, 2003) . Support of such attributional pathway has been found in psychiatric stigma (Corrigan, 2000) . However, this chain has yet to be tested on stigma towards infectious diseases. To examine comprehensively the attribution model of stigma towards infectious diseases, the present study tested the pathway of controllability, responsibility, and blame to stigma among the general public in Hong Kong. We hypothesized that people who attributed the control of contracting the disease to be internal to the individuals are likely to assign greater level of personal responsibility to these individuals, and would be more likely to blame them and attach greater stigma to them.",

However, as w 2 statistics are sample size dependent (Marsh, Balla, & McDonald, 1998) , the large sample size in this study might have led to the failure of p 4.05 with respect to different models. Therefore, the goodness-of-fit indices, specifically, the Comparative Fit Index (CFI) and the Root Mean Square Approximation Error (RMSEA), were also assessed. CFI ranges between 0 and 1, with values greater than .90 indicating good fit (Byrne, 1994) . RMSEA is a measure of the discrepancy between the model and the data per degree of freedom. RMSEA values less than .05 indicate close fit (Browne & Cudeck, 1993) .",

Before the findings are discussed in further detail, some limitations of the present study are noted. First, to reduce the time of administration over the telephone and enhance the response rate, participants in the study were only randomly assigned to one disease condition instead of responding to all three conditions. Although this manipulation precluded concurrent examination of stigma and its psychosocial associates within the participant, given the sample across three disease conditions were similar and representative of the general population, merging the samples for aggregate analysis was deemed to be appropriate. Second, the stigma claimed by participants was relatively small, and it might suggest that their responses towards stigmatization and policy attitudes might be affected by social desirability. Although telephone survey is considered to be effective in ensuring anonymity thus maximizing honest responses from participants, we could not preclude the possibility that the participants may respond positively towards the three diseases. Thus, our findings might have underestimated the extent of stigmatization of the diseases.",

            "text": "Despite these limitations, the present study serves as a promising step in examining public stigma and its policy implications based on the attribution model. Extending from previous studies that focused on describing public perceptions towards the diseases (Jaramillo, 1999; Lau et al., 2005; Malcolm et al., 1998) , the present study focused on the explanatory factors of stigma and the resultant effects on policy attitudes. Results suggested that individuals with HIV/AIDS, TB, or those who were previously infected with SARS were stigmatized by the general public in a varying extent, with individuals diagnosed with HIV/AIDS being the most harshly and blatantly stigmatized, followed by those with TB and those who recovered from SARS. The public also perceived the infection of HIV/AIDS to be more internally controlled by the individuals and regarded individuals having HIV/AIDS as more responsible and blameworthy of their disease than their SARS and TB counterparts. Differences in disease attributions and stigma hinge on several features related to the diseases: (1) whether the disease creates physical limitations to the infected, (2) whether the disease poses serious consequences to others, and (3) whether the disease is associated with symbolic meaning or negative images (Goldin, 1994; Herek, 1999; Pryor, Reeder, & Landau, 1999; ) . Unlike TB and SARS, which are highly contagious but can be readily cured with antibiotic medications, HIV/AIDS has been widely perceived to be a fatal condition with little hope of recovery since its earliest days (Malcolm et al., 1998) . Thus, in terms of physical limitations to the infected, the courses of TB and SARS are acute but time-limited, whereas that of HIV/AIDS is chronic. As for disease threat, although all three diseases are infectious, HIV/AIDS may be regarded as posing the greatest level of threat to the general public in terms of its lethality. Previous research on AIDS stigma has found the disease to be associated with perception of danger, fear of contagion, and overestimation of risks caused by casual contact (Herek & Capitanio, 1993; Herek, Capitanio, & Widaman, 2002) . Compared with TB, which may be seen as relatively benign given its treatability, AIDS has been considered as incurable (Peters et al., 1994) As for SARS, no new cases have been reported since 2003, and recovered SARS patients are not regarded as a threat to the public. In addition to the chronic impact that the disease has on the infected and the severe threat it poses towards the public, HIV/AIDS also carries many negative connotations. It is often being associated with intravenous drug use, sexual promiscuity, and homosexuality/bisexuality; behaviors that in themselves are considered to be deviant and are subject to disapproval by the society (Crandall, Glor, & Britt, 1997; Herek & Capitanio, 1999; Herek & Glunt, 1988) . The general public may perceive those infected with HIV/AIDS to have contracted it through voluntary and immoral behaviors, leading to the assignment of controllability, responsibility, and blame, and greater level of stigmatization. In contrast, SARS and TB do not carry this moral package. Although SARS and TB are associated with physical suffering, they are considered to be caused mainly by external factors, such as bacterial infection and poor hygiene, which are not perceived as morally reprehensible (Kelly, 1999) . Thus, stigmatization of SARS and TB may be driven mainly by the dread of the illness itself, which may be reduced with a decrease level of perceived threat (Lee et al., 2005; Person et al., 2004) .",

Given that public stigma is driven by lay beliefs and emotional responses and lacks a knowledge base, education makes little difference to making the public more accepting of conditions that are aversive to their lay beliefs (Kaye, 1998) . In other words, factual understanding of the disease plays only a small role in shaping stigmatizing attitudes towards infected individuals. The public's perceptions or beliefs about the disease played a much greater role in stigma formation.",

            "text": "The present model provided preliminary support to the sequential processing of attribution in the development of stigma across three types of infectious diseases. In the attribution process (Weiner, 1995) , people first make attributions about the controllability of the individual's illness, whether the individual can control disease contrac-tion by him/herself. Their control attribution then leads to inferences about the responsibility of the infected, whether the individual is held personally responsible for the disease or is deemed helpless in the circumstances. Such inferences lead to emotional reactions as to whether the individual should be blamed, and to what extent the individual should be stigmatized. In the present study, the effects of controllability and blame were found to be equivalent across diseases, whereas the effect of responsibility varied. In other words, while the influence of controllability and blame was equal across diseases in the attribution process, responsibility has greater weight in the determination of blame towards TB and HIV/AIDS than towards SARS. Given that SARS is an acute and nascent disease with its nature still uncertain, the public may be less likely to blame people for their infection when much is unknown about the disease. On the other hand, given that TB and HIV/AIDS have been around for some time, the public is more likely to blame the people who are deemed to be responsible for contracting the disease. In future studies, researchers should account for risk perceptions and other illness perceptions, such as dread and familiarity, to further analyze the sources of stigma. Moreover, longitudinal design should be used to establish causation and to trace the stigma trajectory as the disease progresses over time (Alonzo & Reynolds, 1995) .",

It also showed stigma to be related to public attitudes towards government policies. Whereas SARS stigma was found to affect public's views towards prevention, public education, research, and protection of the infected, stigma did not seem to affect public attitudes towards AIDS research and legal protection of individuals with TB. Given that AIDS is widely publicized in the media and much medical attention has been paid in the treatment of HIV/AIDS across the globe, the public may regard the support for AIDS research as already sufficient, or not necessary in Hong Kong. As to the protection of individuals with TB, since TB is treatable, the public may regard the infected status to be temporary and thus does not warrant any special legislation to protect against discrimination. Future research should focus on identifying disease-specific factors that may better inform us about public attitudes towards government policies.",

More efforts should be placed in strategically changing the attributions made by the public towards infectious diseases. In so doing, the public would develop more acceptable attitudes towards the diseases and the affected individuals, which in turn are related to more favorable attitudes towards governmental support. All in all, stigma plays a significant role in the battle against infectious diseases. For preventive programs of infectious diseases to be effective, their associated stigma must be actively addressed.",
