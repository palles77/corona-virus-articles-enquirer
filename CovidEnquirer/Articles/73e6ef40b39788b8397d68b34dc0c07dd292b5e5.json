            "text": "Bovine enteric coronaviruses (BEC) are important pathogens inducing diarrhea in newborn calves worldwide. They are found alone or in association with rotaviruses, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli or cryptosporidia (Baljer and Bachmann, 1980; Reynolds et al., 1986; Snodgrass et al., 1986; Baljer et al., 1987) . The detection of BEC in feces still gives much difficulty and requires elaborate techniques. The most commonly applied methods for direct virus detection are negative staining electron microscopy (Stair et al., 1972) and immune electron microscopy (Almeida and Waterson, 1969) . The unquestionable advantage of very rapid diagnosis is counteracted by the high cost of equipment, low detection limit ( 106 particles ml-1 ), limited number of samples which can be processed and subjective assessment by the investigator. Immunofluorescent antibody techniques (Mebus et al., 1973; Woode et al., 1978) can only be used for postmortem diagnosis and depend on fresh material, which is not usually available for routine diagnosis. Sharpee et al. (1976) established an assay in which the specificity of the hemagglutinating activity of BEC is confirmed by a hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test. However, neither this test nor the hemadsorption-elution-hemagglutination test (HEHA) as described by Ellens et al. (1978) met with general acceptance in routine diagnosis. Nonspecific hemagglutination (HA) reactions caused by other hemagglutinating agents occurring in fecal samples (e.g., enteroviruses) and the temperature dependence in HA of different BEC strains are responsible for non-reproducible results. The reversed passive hemagglutination assay (RPHA, Sato et al., 1984) can be carried out with impressive ease, but a high percentage of falsepositive reactions causes difficulties in practice. Additionally, antisera purified by affinity chromatography have to be used.",

            "text": "Titration curves of cell culture-adapted BEC strains were of similar shape, but the extinction values depended on their HA titers (Fig. 1 ) . For the detection of BEC V270/83, it did not matter whether one or two MAbs were used for antigen capture (Fig. 2) . MAb 1/1 (I/3) was slightly more effective than MAb 2/1 (II/3), but an amplifying effect of the combination of both MAbs (III/3) was not seen. This could generally be confirmed when fecal samples were tested. However, in a small number of specimens there were striking differences in the reactivity of the two antibodies with the BEC isolates. The catching efficacy of the two MAbs was significantly different. The weak reaction of one MAb was compensated for by the other. With two samples, the neutralizing MAb 1/1 failed to react entirely. In other samples, MAb 2/1 bound Table 3 . The samples are grouped according to their reaction with the two MAbs. DISCUSSION ELISA techniques have been developed for the detection of antigens of many different viruses (Yolken, 1982) . Most of these assays use polyclonal antibodies only, whereas MAbs have been introduced mainly to increase specificity. However, in the case of BEC, only two ELISAs using polyclonal antibodies exclusively have been described to date (Ellens et al., 1978; Reynolds et al., 1984) . Like others (Crouch et al., 1984) , we also failed to establish such an assay for antigen detection. This failure was due to high background reactions and low sensitivity. Crouch et al. (1984) explain their failure with antibodies to rotaviruses that may have been elicited during the immunization period or with antibodies directed against cellular components as being a result of the use of insufficiently purified immunogens. In this report, we used highly purified antigen preparations which were not reactive with MAbs directed against cellular components (C.-P. Czerny, unpublished data). Antibodies to rotaviruses in the sera we used being a reason for non-specific reactivity are unlikely as the antisera did not react with rotaviruses to a greater extent than with other viruses (bovine herpesvirus type I or vaccinia virus) or with uninfected cell cultures. Even with uncoated plates, a similar behaviour was seen. This nonspecific binding is frequently observed at low dilutions, but can be overcome by higher dilutions of the antisera. This procedure, however, was not effective in establishing an ELISA for the detection of BEC antigens as with higher dilutions of polyclonal catching antibodies sensitivity decreased sharply. Purification of these catching antibodies on Protein A-Sepharose or treatment with kaolin did not improve the results. One approach to overcome these problems is purification of the antibodies by affinity chromatography on purified BEC virions, as described by Sato et al., (1984) . We preferred as an alternative the production of highly specific MAbs. Out of 908 tested hybridoma colonies, only five were positive by ELISA. After thorough testing, only two of them proved to be BEC specific whereas the others cross-reacted with cellular components or were reactive with uncoated plastic plates (\"sticky antibodies\"). The BEC-specific MAbs were used as catching antibodies and could be coated directly onto the plates. For antigen detection, rabbit immune serum proved to be superior in terms of sensitivity as optimal specificity was guaranteed by the catching MAbs. However, untreated serum could not be used. Kaolin treatment turned out to be optimal compared to other procedures. Antiserum produced in guinea pigs or antibodies extracted from yolk gave unacceptably high background reactions that could not be reduced by different techniques. The use of conjugated (HRP or biotin) rabbit serum resulted in decreased sensi-tivity, indicating that the anti-species IgG conjugate serves as an additional amplifier. Vautherot and Laporte (1983) reported different reaction patterns of MAbs with BEC field strains. Our studies confirm these results. Therefore, both MAbs were essential for antigen capture. They did not complement one another additively, but compensated for each other when one antibody was less effective in antigen capture due to epitope differences between BEC strains. The protein specificity of the two MAbs could not be determined because they failed to react in immunoblotting. The epitopes recognized by the MAbs are obviously conformation dependent and are probably located close together on the virion. This was seen in competition ELISA, where the neutralizing MAb hindered the non-neutralizing MAb from binding. Hogue et al. (1984) as well as Deregt et al. ( 1987 ) have shown that BEC proteins of 120 and 100 kDa are responsible for neutralization. Some of the isolates tested probably lost the epitope recognized by the neutralizing MAb 1/1.",
