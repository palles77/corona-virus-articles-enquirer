Previously, groups had targeted conserved 9 coronavirus proteins as a strategy to generate live-attenuated vaccine strains against current 10 and future CoVs. With this in mind, we explored whether manipulation of CoV NSP16, a 11 conserved 2'O methyltransferase (MTase), could provide a broad attenuation platform against 12 future emergent strains. Using the SARS-CoV mouse model, a NSP16 mutant vaccine was 13 evaluated for protection from heterologous challenge, efficacy in the aging host, and potential 14 for reversion to pathogenesis. Despite some success, concerns for virulence in the aged and 15 potential for reversion makes targeting NSP16 alone an untenable approach. However, 16 combining a 2'O MTase mutation with a previously described CoV fidelity mutant produced a 17 vaccine strain capable of protection from heterologous virus challenge, efficacy in aged mice, 18 and no evidence for reversion. Together, the results indicate that targeting the CoV 2'O MTase 19 in parallel with other conserved attenuating mutations may provide a platform strategy for 20 rapidly generating live-attenuated coronavirus vaccines.",

Similarly, in vivo characterizations found no deficit in viral replication at early times (days 1 103 and 2), but a marked attenuation at late times post infection (19, 20) . These results suggest that 104 the early portions of dNSP16 infection are equivalent to wild-type virus infection. To further 105 explore this question, we utilized a systems biology approach to compare wild-type and dNSP16 106 mutant in 20-week old C57BL/6 mice. In this model, mice infected with the mouse-adapted mutant has no discernable attenuation at days 1 or 2 (Fig. 1C) ; however, at day 4, a 100-fold 111 reduction in replication is observed in the lungs of dNSP16 infected mice that corresponds with 112 the kinetics of interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression. Importantly, the global host 113 expression response models the same trend. PCA plots of total RNA expression finds that wild-114 type and mutant virus profiles cluster together at days 1 and 2 ( Fig. 1D) dNSP16, monitored for 28 days, and subsequently challenged with the chimeric strain following vaccination (Fig. 2D) .

Both wild-type and331 mutant viruses were derived from either SARS-CoV Urbani or corresponding mouse adapted 332 (MA15) infectious clone as previously described (25, 29). For NSP16/ExoN mutant construction, 333 we utilized the constructs previously generated for individual NSP16 (19) and NSP14 ExoN (16) 334 mutants located on different fragments (D & E respectively). Thereafter, plasmids containing 335 wild-type and mutant SARS-CoV genome fragments were amplified, excised, ligated, and 336 purified. In vitro transcription reactions were then preformed to synthesize full-length genomic 337 RNA, which was transfected into Vero E6 cells.
