According to the U.S. Renal Data System (USRDS), infections occurred at a rate of 45 per 100 patient-years during the first 3 years after transplantation. 1 The most common infections are bacterial, followed by viral and fungal. Parasitic infections are rare. Notably, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection rates have decreased since the mid-1990s as a result of effective antiviral prophylaxis; hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection rates increased during the same period for unclear reasons.",

Similar to those that follow any major surgical procedure, most bacterial infections during this period involve wounds, catheters, and drainage sites. Aspiration pneumonia and urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common. Infections specific to renal transplant recipients include perinephric fluid collections due to lymphoceles, wound hematomas, or urine leaks; indwelling urinary stents; and UTIs secondary to urinary tract abnormalities, such as ureteral stricture, vesicoureteral reflux, or neurogenic bladder. Most UTIs are caused by common gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas) and gram-positive bacteria (enterococcus). Preventive measures for UTIs include early urethral catheter removal and antibiotic prophylaxis. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or ciprofloxacin prophylaxis during the first 3 months after transplantation effectively reduces the frequency of UTIs to less than 10% and essentially eliminates urosepsis unless anatomic or functional derangement of the urinary tract is present.",

Viral infections, such as CMV, HSV, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), HBV, and HCV, may occur from exogenous infection or reactivation of latent disease due to the immunosuppressed state. Repeated courses of antibiotics and corticosteroid therapy increase the risk of fungal infections, whereas viral infections may not only result from the immunosuppression but may themselves further impair immunity to increase the risk for additional opportunistic infections. Opportunistic infections may occur with Pneumocystis jiroveci (previously Pneumocystis carinii), Aspergillus species, Listeria monocytogenes, Nocardia species, and Toxoplasma gondii. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis (see early post-transplantation period, outbreaks of donor-transmitted viral infections, such as lymphocytic choriomeningitis and West Nile virus, have been reported.

There is currently no effective antiviral therapy against either infection, and adherence to current guidelines for vaccinations in solid organ transplantation is recommended (discussed later). Other emerging or reemerging viral infections include adenovirus, human herpesvirus 6, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus.

Seronegative individuals who receive organs from latently infected seropositive donors are at greatest risk for primary infection and severe CMV disease. A suggested CMV prophylaxis protocol is shown in Figure 101 Clinical CMV disease is treated with intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg twice daily for 3 weeks, dose adjusted for renal dysfunction) with reduction of immunosuppression, such as withholding of MMF. Treatment is continued until clearance of viremia as assessed by PCR or antigenemia. Anecdotal reports have suggested that calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) to sirolimus switch in conjunction with ganciclovir therapy may be beneficial in patients with apparent ganciclovir-resistant CMV. 8 In patients with gastrointestinal CMV infection, the use of these assays is unreliable, and repeated endoscopy should be considered to assess response to therapy. In patients who have primary infection and respond slowly to therapy, the addition of CMV hyperimmune globulin (150 mg/kg per dose given intravenously every 3 to 4 weeks for 3 months) may be of benefit. 5 In patients with tissue invasive disease, intravenous ganciclovir is recommended with conversion to oral therapy when there is evidence of a good response, followed by a 3-month course of oral ganciclovir or valganciclovir prophylaxis. 5 Whereas oral valganciclovir provides good bioavailability and may be effective in mild CMV disease, it is not recommended for the treatment of occur 1 to 4 months after transplantation except for chorioretinitis, which occurs later in the transplant course. 5 Quantitative CMV assays of serum in patients with invasive colitis and gastritis or neurologic disease including chorioretinitis are often negative.

            "text": "BK virus is a ubiquitous human virus with a peak incidence of primary infection in children 2 to 5 years of age and a seroprevalence rate of more than 60% to 90% among the adult population worldwide. After primary infection, BK virus preferentially establishes latency within the genitourinary tract and frequently is reactivated in the setting of immunosuppression. In renal transplant recipients, BK virus is associated with a range of clinical syndromes including asymptomatic viruria with or without viremia, ureteral stenosis and obstruction, interstitial nephritis, and BK allograft nephropathy. During the last decade, BK nephropathy has emerged as an important cause of allograft dysfunction after renal transplantation. Most series report that 30% to 40% of renal transplant recipients develop BK viruria, 10% to 20% develop BK viremia, and 2% to 5% develop BK nephropathy. The highest prevalence of BK viruria and viremia occurs at 2 to 3 months and 3 to 6 months, respectively. The risk for development of BK viremia increases when urine viral load is greater than 10 4 copies/ml, whereas BK nephropathy is unusual in the absence of BK viremia. BK nephropathy commonly presents with an asymptomatic rise in serum creatinine during the first posttransplantation year. However, BK nephropathy may occur as early as the first week to as late as 6 years after transplantation. Diagnosis is made by allograft biopsy, which demonstrates BK viral inclusions in renal tubular cell nuclei and occasionally in glomerular parietal epithelium (Fig. 101.4A ). There are variable degrees of interstitial mononuclear inflammation (Fig. 101 .4B), often with plasma cells, degenerative changes in tubules, and focal tubulitis, which may mimic acute rejection. BK nephropathy often is associated with very focal and sharply demarcated areas of tubulointerstitial inflammation, corresponding to foci of viral infection. Immunohistochemistry (Fig. 101.4C ), in situ hybridization, or electron microscopy is required to confirm the diagnosis. BK infection and acute rejection may occur simultaneously, and distinguishing between BK nephropathy and acute rejection or the presence of both can be a diagnostic challenge. In late BK nephropathy, few characteristic intranuclear inclusions are seen, and the histologic changes may be indistinguishable from chronic rejection. A histologic classification system for BK nephropathy based on the degree of active inflammation, acute tubular injury, and tubulointerstitial scarring may have prognostic significance. 10 Urine cytology for decoy cells and quantitative determinations of viruria and of viral load in blood have been proposed as surrogate markers for the diagnosis of BK nephropathy. Treatment strategies include reduction in immunosuppression that involves reduction or discontinuation of MMF and azathioprine with judicious reduction in CNI therapy or other immunosuppressive regimen. Switching from tacrolimus to cyclosporine or to sirolimus (rapamycin) has resulted in resolution of BK nephropathy and viremia or viruria in anecdotal case reports. Switching from CNI to sirolimus may have the added benefit of avoiding the long-term nephrotoxic effect of CNI therapy. Although no approved antiviral drug is available, adjunctive therapy with leflunomide, cidofovir, quinolones, or intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) may be beneficial, especially in patients with progressive allograft dysfunction. Quinolones are preferred by some centers because of low cost and ease of administration; leflunomide is used by others because of its potential simultaneous antiviral and immunosuppressive properties. Cidofovir is highly concentrated in urine and renal tissue, and the use of low-dose cidofovir in BK nephropathy has been reported to be devoid of nephrotoxicity or serious adverse events. Anecdotal established CMV disease, and intravenous ganciclovir is required. Cidofovir and foscarnet are alternative therapeutic agents, but in view of their nephrotoxicity and potential synergistic nephrotoxicity with CNIs, they are reserved for use when ganciclovirresistant strains are clinically suspected.",

In the absence of active viral replication, patients with graft loss due to BK nephropathy can safely undergo retransplantation. Active surveillance for BK virus reactivation after transplantation is recommended.

Hence, all renal transplant candidates should have a PPD skin test (tuberculin skin test) placed before transplantation. A positive skin test response or a prior history of TB mandates further evaluation to rule out active disease. Isoniazid prophylaxis for a total of 9 months is recommended for those who have a positive skin test response. Of interest, most of the patients who develop TB after transplantation had negative PPD skin test results before transplantation. 13 Some centers recommend isoniazid prophylactic therapy in selected PPD-negative patients with (1) a history of inadequately treated TB, (2) radiographic evidence of granulomatous disease and no history of adequate treatment, (3) an organ from a PPD-positive donor, or (4) close and prolonged contact with a case of active TB. 13 In patients with a known history of adequately treated TB infection, we advocate the use of isoniazid prophylaxis for the first 9 months after transplantation and during intensification of immunosuppression. Others, however, have suggested that isoniazid prophylaxis is not indicated for those patients whose TB had been properly treated. 12 Clinical, radiologic, or culture evidence of active TB infection is a contraindication to transplantation. Enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT), which detects T cells specific for Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens, is unaffected by bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccination and has become a major advance in TB screening. In some centers, the tuberculin skin test has been replaced by the ELISPOT assays (T-SPOT.TB assay).",

The Israel Penn International Transplant Tumor Registry data on the time of appearance of different neoplasms after solid organ transplantation are shown in Figure 101 .9. PTLD generally occurs early after transplantation; skin cancers occur with increasing frequency with time. The intensity and duration of immunosuppression as well as the ability of these agents to promote replication of various oncogenic viruses are important risk factors. The associations between human papillomaviruses and cervical and vulvar carcinoma, EBV and PTLD, HBV and HCV and hepatocellular carcinoma, and HHV-8 and Kaposi's sarcoma are well established.

Based on the World Health Organization classification, PTLD can be divided into three distinct morphologic groups: (1) diffuse B-cell hyperplasia, (2) polymorphic PTLD (usually monoclonal), and (3) monomorphic PTLD that includes high-grade invasive lymphoma of B-or T-lymphocyte centroblasts. Diffuse B-cell hyperplasia is usually seen in children and young adults and commonly occurs within the first year after transplantation. Polymorphic PTLD represents the most common type of PTLD in both children and adults and may occur at any time after transplantation. In contrast, monomorphic B-cell PTLD is often seen several years after transplantation and may resemble non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in the general population. In a retrospective analysis of registry data for 402 recipients of kidney transplants, PTLD occurred at a median of 18 months (range, 1 to 310 months) after transplantation.",

A history of pretransplantation malignant disease and fewer HLA matches are associated with an increased risk of PTLD. Cyclosporine and tacrolimus may enhance the development of EBV-associated PTLD by directly promoting the survival of EBV-infected B cells, presumably through the inhibition of EBV-transformed cells from apoptosis. 23 Reduction or discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy, particularly antilymphocyte antibody, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, or MMF, is recommended as first-line treatment; prednisone is increased to 10 to 15 mg daily to prevent allograft rejection. Sirolimus has a strong antiproliferative effect on PTLD-derived B-cell lines, 24 but whether sirolimus may limit B-cell lymphoma growth while simultaneously providing immunosuppression to prevent graft rejection awaits studies. Acyclovir or ganciclovir therapy and reduction in immunosuppression are beneficial and may be curative in benign polyclonal B-cell proliferation.

Although registry studies have limitations, all transplant recipients should adhere to standard cancer surveillance appropriate for age (Fig. 101.11 ). 20 In patients with a history of pre-transplantation malignant neoplasms, close monitoring for recurrences in the post-transplantation period is mandatory. The highest recurrence rates have been observed with multiple myeloma (67%), non-melanoma skin cancers (53%), bladder carcinomas (29%), sarcomas (29%), symptomatic of 375 mg/m 2 ) in patients with PTLD (in conjunction with reduction in immunosuppression) have shown promising results. Complete remission rates of 30% to 60% have been reported. 24 Although the response rates appear to vary substantially among patients and centers, rituximab in conjunction with reduction in immunosuppression is evolving as the treatment of choice for CD20 + PTLD. The role of cytokine-based therapy, such as interferon alfa and anti-IL-6, remains poorly defined 25 ; increased risk of allograft rejection is seen with anti-IL-6 treatment. Sirolimus, an immunosuppressant with antiproliferative properties, has been demonstrated to prevent proliferation of B-cell (but not T-cell) PTLD-derived tumor cell lines in vitro and in vivo. 26 Limited data from nine European transplant centers have shown tumor regression in 15 of 19 patients with PTLD who underwent minimization or withdrawal of CNIs and sirolimus conversion. 27 Factors that adversely affect survival include multiple-versus single-site involvement, increasing age, B-cell predominance, use of antilymphocyte globulin or antithymocyte globulin and OKT3, and \"early\" versus \"late\" onset (within 6 to 12 months versus more than 12 months). In recipients of renal transplants with PTLD restricted to the allograft alone, transplant nephrectomy may improve survival. role of antiviral therapy in B-cell monoclonal malignant transformation is less well defined; 50% to 90% mortality has been reported despite antiviral therapy. Surgical resection with or without adjunctive local irradiation has been suggested for localized disease. Local irradiation has been advocated as the treatment of choice for PTLD involving the central nervous system.",

It has been proposed by experts in the field that immunosuppression dose reduction or withdrawal may permit recovery of the immune system and control the progression of life-threatening malignant neoplasms. The former allows intact immune surveillance against malignant cells. Nonetheless, this approach is not without its attendant risk of graft rejection and graft loss. Furthermore, little is known as to how much and to what extent immunosuppression reduction or withdrawal might alter the natural history of established post-transplantation malignant neoplasms. In our opinion, CNI to sirolimus switch or CNI minimization in conjunction with sirolimus may be a viable therapeutic option (the antitumoral effect of sirolimus is discussed later). In patients with metastatic cancer, manipulation of immunosuppression is probably futile, and the risk of rejection and graft loss necessitating a return to dialysis is likely to outweigh the benefit. Studies suggest that immunosuppressive agents have different effects on cancer risk after transplantation. The carcinogenic effects of OKT3, antithymocyte globulin, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and azathioprine have been well documented. In contrast to azathioprine, MMF has been shown to have antiproliferative effects and has been suggested to protect against posttransplantation malignant neoplasms. 30, 31 Analysis of more than 17,000 adult patients with preexisting DM indicated a significantly higher incidence of malignant transformation in azathioprine-treated than in MMF-treated patients (3.7% versus 2.2%; P < .01). 31 However, whether MMF is protective of posttransplantation malignant neoplasia remains speculative.",
