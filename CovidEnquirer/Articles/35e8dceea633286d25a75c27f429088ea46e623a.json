These three processes diffuse simultaneously through human social networks, and interact with one another, forming negative and positive feedback loops in the complex human-disease systems. Few studies, however, have been devoted to coupling all the three diffusions together and representing their interactions. To fill the knowledge gap, this article proposes a spatially explicit agent-based model to simulate a triple-diffusion process in a metropolitan area of 1 million people. The individual-based approach, network model, behavioral theories, and stochastic processes are used to formulate the three diffusions and integrate them together. Compared to the observed facts, the model results reasonably replicate the trends of influenza spread and information propagation. The model thus could be a valid and effective tool to evaluate information/behavior-based intervention strategies. Besides its implications to the public health, the research findings also contribute to network modeling, systems science, and medical geography.",

These images depict three basic components of epidemics, namely infectious diseases, information about diseases, and human preventive behavior against diseases. From a perspective of diffusion theory, each of the three components can be viewed as a spreading process throughout a population. The disease could be transmitted through person-to-person contact, the information is circulated by communication channels, and the preventive behavior can spread via the 'social contagion' process, such as the observational learning. The interactions among these three diffusion processes shape the scale and dynamics of epidemics (Funk & Jansen, 2013; Lau et al., 2005; Mao & Yang, 2011) .",

This is rarely the case because it is natural for people to protect themselves when realizing disease risks (Eames, Tilston, Brooks-Pollock, & Edmunds, 2012; Ferguson, 2007) . To improve, there has been much recent interest in modeling two diffusion processes in an epidemic, either a behavior-disease diffusion (House, 2011; Mao & Bian, 2011; Vardavas, Breban, & Blower, 2007) , or an information (awareness)-disease diffusion (Funk, Gilad, Watkins, & Jansen, 2009; Kiss, Cassell, Recker, & Simon, 2010) .

First, the contacts among individuals form a network structure as a basis for diffusion and interaction. Second, infectious diseases are transmitted through direct contacts among individuals (the middle layer). Disease control strategies, such as vaccination program, case treatment and isolation, pose external effects on the disease diffusion. Third, the diffusion of diseases prompts the \"word-of-mouth\" discussion among individuals, which disseminates the information concerning diseases and prevention (the upper layer). The outbreak of diseases may also stimulate various mass media, such as TV, newspapers, and radio, to propagate relevant information, thus accelerating the diffusion of information. Fourth, people being informed start to consider and make a decision toward the adoption of preventive behaviors. The adoptive behavior of individuals also influences their network neighbors to adopt, widely known as the \"social contagion\" effects (the lower layer). The diffusion of preventive behaviors, in turn, limits the dispersion of diseases and speeds the diffusion of information. Behavioral interventions, as an external factor, can be implemented by health agencies to promote preventive behaviors, such as educational, incentive and role-model strategies. During an epidemic, these three diffusion processes interact with one another and form negative/positive feedbacks loops in the human-disease system, shown as arrows between layers in Fig. 1 . Manipulated by the three external factors, these three diffusion processes, hereinafter named as the triple-diffusion process, determine the spatial and temporal dynamics of an epidemic.",

The constant b is a scaling parameter that controls the intensity of mass-media propagation, and a small b results in a large g mass . A mass-media campaign then can be modeled by varying the b, the timing of campaign (when to start), and the frequency of campaign (time intervals between two broadcastings). Once informed by either the discussion or the mass media, individuals will become decision makers toward the adoption of preventive behavior. In such a manner, the diffusion of information is coupled with the diffusion of disease and that of preventive behavior.",

The decision depends on individuals' own characteristics and inter-personal influence from their social networks. This research uses a threshold behavioral model (Granovetter & Soong, 1983) to formulate the decision process. Specifically, each individual has two adoption states, and the change of state is calculated based on Equation (4) For a given time step t, individual i will evaluate the proportion of adopters in i's personal network, as the peer pressure of adoption a i (t). Once the peer pressure reaches a threshold T p;i (called the threshold of adoption pressure), an individual will decide to adopt. Meanwhile, individual i also evaluates the proportion of symptomatic individuals in the personal network, as the perceive risks of infection m i (t). If the perceived risk exceeds another threshold T r;i (termed the threshold of infection risk), an individual will also adopt. The individualized thresholds (T p;i and T r;i ) reflect personal characteristics of individuals, while the events of evaluation represent the inter-personal influence between individuals. In such a way, the diffusion of disease elevates the perceived risks of individuals, and stimulates them to adopt preventive behavior. In turn, the adoption of preventive behavior impedes the diffusion of disease, forming a negative feedback loop in the human-disease system.",

Each individual is programmed into a software agent with attributes and events (Table 1) . Besides a unique identifier, each individual has 6 groups of attributes, including the network, demographic, spatiotemporal, infection, adoption, and information attributes. The events change the values of corresponding attributes. The social network is realized by a previously developed algorithm that assigns values to the demographic and network attributes of individuals (Mao & Bian, 2010) . The value assignment involves a large amount of geo-referenced data, including census data, business location data, land parcel data, transportation network, and results of a household travel survey. Statistical distributions derived from these datasets, such as distributions of family size, workplace size, and household daily trips, are used to ensure the validity of value assignments. To differentiate the weekdays and weekends, individuals are not assigned to work (or schools) at weekends except those who work in service-oriented businesses (such as restaurants and grocery stores). Those who do not work during the weekends would have increased trips to service-oriented businesses. The completion of assignments forms three linked populations, including a nighttime population at homes, a daytime population at workplaces, and a pastime population at service places or neighbor households. The three populations represent the same set of individuals, but at different locations and time periods of a day. Individuals have contact with a number of other individuals at a same time period and same location, forming a spatio-temporally varying network. The simulated network has an average of 16.9 daily contacts per person, consistent with the observed number (16.8) from empirical studies (Beutels, Shkedy, Aerts, & Van Damme, 2006; Edmunds, 1997; Fu, 2005) .",

First, the model assumes that symptomatic individuals has a 75% likelihood to adopt flu prophylaxis to mitigate the symptoms and reduce their infectivity (McIsaac, Levine, & Goel, 1998) . Second, the preventive efficacy of flu prophylaxis (E prevention in Equation (1)) is set to 70% and 40% for susceptible and infectious individuals, respectively, indicating that their likelihood of being infected or infecting others can be reduced by such amount (Hayden, 2001; Longini et al., 2004) .

The shape and peak time of the predicted curve correspond well with those of the reported epidemic, although the magnitude of simulated cases is much larger than the reported data. The first possible reason is that many sick people may choose self-care instead of seeing a doctor, and thus cannot be reported. Second, for those who seek healthcare, only a small portion of their specimens were submitted for laboratory testing. Therefore, the number of influenza cases is often highly under-reported, and a complete data is rather difficult to collect. The laboratory data, so far, is the best available touchstone for model validation. In this sense, the model performs well in predicting the trend, and at least allows the estimate of a worse case result. Fig. 5 compares the simulated weekly number of newly informed people to the excessive weekly Google Flu search statistics that indicate the amount of online searching behavior relevant to influenza epidemic during the 2004e2005 flu season. The excessive weekly search statistic (the left Y axis) is the difference between the observed statistics and its long-term average (1296), which removes searches of influenza in a normal day but not caused by the epidemic. The temporal course of the information diffusion is well predicted. Since the two measurements are not in a same unit (primary and secondary axis in Fig. 5 ), their magnitudes are not comparable but are highly correlated.",

A majority of previous models cannot validate themselves by observed facts, particularly for the information diffusion. The triple-diffusion model, thus, could provide a reliable foundation to devise much-needed control and intervention strategies for infectious diseases, such as behavior promotion strategies and massmedia campaigns. Fig. 6 shows how the diffusion of influenza motivates people to adopt preventive behavior. The two diffusion processes take a similar shape, but there is a time lag about 1 week between their peak times. As the number of influenza cases rises, individuals perceive increasing risks, which motivate them to adopt preventive behavior. Their adoptive behavior further influences surrounding individuals to adopt. The time lag between the epidemic and adoption curves is possibly the time individuals need to be informed and take preventive actions. Fig. 6 also suggests that monitoring the real-time flu prophylaxis sales could detect the epidemic peak about 1 week ahead of the traditional disease surveillance networks, such as the CDC sentinel network, which take up to 2 weeks to collect, process, and report disease cases registered at health centers.",

A possible reason is the wide coverage of modern mass media over the population, enabling a faster spread of information than the disease. At the beginning of the epidemic, only a few influenza cases occurred and a vast majority of people were unaware of the disease. As the diffusion of influenza took off (January 2nde9th), individuals started to notice the disease problem and discuss with each other. When the epidemic became more sensational and drawn attention from the mass media (January 10the16th), the awareness curve climbed steeply and reached the peak in four weeks. Fig. 7 implies that overseeing the diffusion of disease information, such as the Google flu trend, could warn the public 1e2 week earlier before the epidemic peak actually occurs.",

            "text": "Still in its infancy, the triple-diffusion model has several limitations in its design and implementation. First, the contact network used in the model could be further refined into three different but partially overlapping networks, namely an infection network, information network, and influential network, each channels a diffusion process. Admittedly, the model would be more realistic, but building these networks requires extensive social survey to collect relevant data, which is often costly and time consuming. Recent work on extracting social networks from Facebook and Twitter may be a promising method to address this issue (Lewis, Kaufman, Gonzalez, Wimmer, & Christakis, 2008) . Second, the effects of mass media is formulated as a simple formula, but could be more complicated if further considering various types of media and their corresponding coverage. Probably, a sophisticated function could depict the human communications better, such as an exponential decay or a power-law decay function. Life style data of individuals may be helpful to identify their preferred media and delineate the media coverage. Third, the discussion rate is assumed homogenous over the study area. This rate may vary between age groups, occupations, and personalities. A health behavior survey may need to estimate discussion rates for different groups of individuals. Fourth, there would be a certain amount of uncertainty if the model was used to predict the future influenza outbreaks. If new census data and travel survey data were filled in, this model could reasonably predict the timeline and scale of a future outbreak of seasonal influenza. However, for a pandemic influenza, such as the new H1N1, most of the model parameters should be adjusted to account for the highly infectious virus, the faster circulation of information, and possibly distinct response of individuals toward preventive behaviors. All these limitations warrant a future study. After all, the goal of modeling is not to predict what exactly happen during an epidemic, but rather to observe how the epidemic may proceed and encourage appropriate questions. In this sense, the model results provide valuable knowledge regarding city-wide epidemics. ",

The conceptual framework integrates three interactive processes: the diffusion of influenza, the diffusion of information, and that of preventive behavior, upon a human social network. The agentbased approach, network model, theories from epidemiology, information and behavioral sciences are used to formulate the conceptual framework into a working model. For illustration purposes, the model is implemented in an urbanized area with a large population. Compared to the reported data, the proposed model reasonably replicates the observed trends of influenza infection and online query frequency. The model, thus, could be a valid and effective tool for exploring various control policies.",

            "text": "There are two key contributions of this research to the literature body of network diffusion theory, public health, and agent-based modeling. First, the proposed triple-diffusion framework is a significant advancement to previous disease-only models and dualdiffusion models, such as Bian and Mao's work. The fusion of disease, information, and human behavior allows a more comprehensive 3D cubic view of the human-disease system, which can only be studied from a 2D planar perspective before. The increase of one dimension exposes much more details of an epidemic and thus enables a deeper understanding of this complex system, for example, the interactive mechanisms among the three diffusion processes. The proposed modeling framework can flexibly accommodate the mobile phone tracking data and the latest census data to improve the accuracy of modeled daytime and nighttime populations. The online social networking data (from Facebook and Twitter) can also be included to modify the way of communications between individuals, as well as the personal influence between them. Second, this model can be further developed into a virtual platform for health decision makers to test disease control policies in many other metropolitan areas. Particularly, since the model explicitly represents the diffusion of information and human preventive behavior, it permits a systematic evaluation of disease control policies that have not been well studied before, such as the mass-media campaigns and behavioral incentive strategies. The evaluation results will enrich the family of disease control polices, and help the public health overcome the socio-economic challenges posed by potential influenza outbreaks.",
