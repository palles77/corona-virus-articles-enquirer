Furthermore, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve were universally applied for a performance evaluation of the fuzzy logic techniques.

Infectious diseases are the major cause of illness and death for any given population [2, 3] . Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), H1N1 influenza and Poliomyelitis are examples of an infectious disease [3, 4] . While globally the incidence of the infectious disease varies greatly between countries, in the 21st century, the main incidences are hand-foot-mouth disease, Hepatitis B, and Tuberculosis [3] . These diseases have a significant impact on the global health and economies [5] . Despite numerous valuable achievements regarding the procedures for preventing and controlling of various diseases, infectious diseases remain a massive threat to a population's well-being [6] . Aspects such as the increasing in antimicrobial resistance, increase in population and environmental changes are important in an infectious disease transmission [7] . Of 57 million mortality reported per year throughout the world, 14.9 million were related to infectious diseases; which represent more than 25% of the overall deaths [3] .",

It has been shown that the fuzzy based techniques have an essential part in the determination of infectious disease outbreaks. As an example for that, we have the HIV outbreaks, these techniques can identify at what time a viral transmission has occurred, its outbreak stage and the sexual behavior pattern of the specific population in which a disease is spreading. Moreover, the infectious diseases annihilation and elimination techniques dictate that the transmission process itself has to be the target not the disease.

In last few years, a large number of the transmissible diseases that were supposed to be eliminated have made a comeback. Certain factors such as manufacturing, agricultural practices, wars, changes in lifestyles, development and urbanization, and environmental change are all effective in the appearance and reappearance of an infectious disease [50] . This SLR's result demonstrates that even though these are the most of the infectious diseases that were investigated, but there is still more area that needs to be covered. Nevertheless, more work should be carried out on the appearance and reappearance diseases domains such as H1N1, SARS, Zoonosis and the Rift valley fever.",

Or we can say, the deployment of a unified spatial and social network structure to define the spreading of an infectious pathogens in a given populace will allow insights into both the understanding to the disease method of distribution and the possible process associated with the observed patterns. Since there are various studies regarding social media information analysis, we recommend the use of this dataset for the prediction of an infectious disease epidemic. This research has its limitations. Even with the use of a broad search approach, some of the publications regarding the fuzzy logic deployment in an infectious disease could not be recovered, as in the case of grey literature and reports that were not published in surveyed digital databases, which we have reviewed. Thus, it is recommended that additional SLR papers should be carried out to go through the other noticeable databases. Additionally, some studies did not report clearly on the performance assessment technique.
