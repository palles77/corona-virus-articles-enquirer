Here, we report phenotypes associated with a null Ddx1 (Ddx1 AX ) mutation generated in Drosophila melanogaster. Ddx1 null flies are viable but significantly smaller than control and Ddx1 heterozygous flies. Female Ddx1 null flies have reduced fertility with egg chambers undergoing autophagy, whereas males are sterile due to disrupted spermatogenesis. Comparative RNA sequencing of control and Ddx1 null third instars identified several transcripts affected by Ddx1 inactivation. One of these, Sirup mRNA, was previously shown to be overexpressed under starvation conditions and implicated in mitochondrial function. We demonstrate that Sirup is a direct binding target of Ddx1 and that Sirup mRNA is differentially spliced in the presence or absence of Ddx1. Combining Ddx1 null mutation with Sirup dsRNA-mediated knock-down causes epistatic lethality not observed in either single mutant. Our data suggest a role for Drosophila Ddx1 in stress-induced regulation of splicing.",

Vasa has also been implicated in chromatin condensation and generation of small non-coding RNAs (Pek and Kai, 2011; Zhang et al., 2012) . Belle, which is closely related to Vasa, is essential for larval development and required for both male and female fertility (Johnstone et al., 2005) . Mutation of pitchoune, encoding another DEAD box helicase, results in developmental arrest during the first instar stage. Pitchoune has been implicated in regulating cell growth and proliferation (Zaffran et al., 1998) .",

DDX1 is also a prognostic marker in breast cancer (Balko and Arteaga, 2011; Germain et al., 2011) , and plays a role in (Tanaka et al., 2009) . Large scale screens for disease associated genes have identified DDX1 as a potential gene of interest in cervical cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Johanneson et al., 2014; Smolonska et al., 2014) . As well, DDX1 is significantly down-regulated in Down syndrome fetal brains (Kircher et al., 2002) . Clues to DDX1's role in these diseases come from in vitro analysis. For example, DDX1 was identified in a subset of RNA transport granules involved in the subcellular localization of RNA molecules in neuronal axons (Kanai et al., 2004) . DDX1's role in RNA trafficking is not limited to endogenously coded genes as HIV replication requires DDX1 for efficient export of unspliced viral genomic RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Edgcomb et al., 2012; Fang et al., 2005; Robertson-Anderson et al., 2011) . This effect is mediated through an interaction between DDX1 and two virally encoded proteins, Rev and Tat, that are essential for RNA export (Lin et al., 2014) . DDX1 is also required for efficient replication of coronavirus (Wu et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2010) , and has been shown to transactivate hepatitis C and JC viral genes (Sunden et al., 2007a; Sunden et al., 2007b; Tingting et al., 2006) .",

When under metabolic stress or starvation conditions, developing egg chambers undergo autophagy in order to conserve energy (Barth et al., 2011; McCall, 2004) . To determine if developing egg chambers in Ddx1 null flies are undergoing autophagy, we carried out immunofluorescence analysis of control and Ddx1 null ovarioles. Early stage egg chambers and germ-line stem cell niches appeared normal, indicating that the early stages of oogenesis are not disrupted in Ddx1 null flies (Fig. 5A ). Next, we stained dissected ovarioles with LysoTracker Red, a dye that is commonly used to identify autophagic cells (DeVorkin and Gorski, 2014) . In Ddx1 null ovaries, at both 3 and 10 days post eclosion, we observed midstage autophagic egg chambers ( Fig. 5B-C, arrows) . Autophagic egg chambers were not observed in control and heterozygous ovaries. As mature egg chambers lacking dorsal appendages were observed in Ddx1 null ovaries, we imaged stage 8-9 egg chambers of control and Ddx1 null ovarioles for the localization of Gurken, a key factor in dorsal appendage development which localizes to the anterior dorsal corner of mid-stage oocytes (Neuman-Silberberg and Schupbach, 1996; Schupbach, 1987) (Fig. 5D ). As expected, control egg chambers displayed normal Gurken localization. While a subset of egg chambers in Ddx1 AX /Df(3L)ED230 ovaries (approximately half) showed the expected Gurken localization pattern, the remaining Ddx1 AX /Df(3L)ED230 egg chambers and all egg chambers present in Ddx1 AX/AX ovaries lacked any notable Gurken expression pattern.",

We utilized RNA isolated from control and Ddx1 null 3 rd instars, as phenotypes are present at this point and wandering 3 rd instars can be easily staged in spite of developmental delays associated with Ddx1 null mutants. We identified 72 significantly down-regulated and 261 significantly up-regulated transcripts, using a cut-off of p o 0.01 (Table S1 ). Of note, we found that RNA is expressed from the portion of the Ddx1 AX allele retained in the genome of our Ddx1 null flies, although RNA levels were significantly reduced compared to that found in control flies. Further analysis of the region directly upstream of the Ddx1 AX allele suggests that transcription is initiated approximately 150 bp upstream of the deletion site. Immediately upstream of this putative transcriptional start site is a variant TATA box sequence (CATAAAG) that may act as a cryptic transcription initiation site in the absence of the normal start site.",

The authors indirectly inferred that the described allele affected Ddx1; however, unknown at the time, there is another gene between Ddx1 and CSP, CG11523. A subsequent report showed that disrupted CG11523 is associated with a lethal phenotype (CG11523 GD7321 ) (Mummery-Widmer et al., 2009) . It is, therefore, likely that the effect attributed to Ddx1 mutation in 1994 was actually due to disruption of CG11523. Alternatively, the lethal phenotype observed by Zinsmaier et al. may be the result of a truncated Ddx1 product, as the location of the P-element used to generate the Ddx1 9W1 allele is such that deletions would likely result in a truncation. A truncated gene product (G) Progeny generated from y 1 w * ; Actin5C-Gal4/CyO; Ddx1 AX /TM3, Sb x y 1 w * ; UAS-Sirup-RNAi; Ddx1 AX /TM3, Ser GFP crosses.

Chi square analysis comparing observed distribution to expected distribution was used to determine significance. could cause a divergent phenotype from that of a null allele.

Ddx1 null flies are significantly reduced in size, developmentally delayed and out-competed by heterozygous animals when raised in crowded conditions. In addition, Ddx1 null flies are infertile due to aberrant gametogenesis, with both oogenesis and spermatogenesis being affected. We observed significantly smaller ovaries containing few to no mature eggs in Ddx1 null flies. One possible explanation for reduced ovary size is disruption of stem cell maintenance and/or division; however, mutants in which the stem cell pool is affected typically display reduced numbers of early egg chambers (Li et al., 2009; Shen et al., 2009) . Ddx1 null ovaries appear to have normal numbers of egg chambers, suggesting that regulation of stem cell niche is not the cause of the small ovary phenotype.",

Our RNA deep-sequencing did not identify any of the well-characterized Gurken localization factors as being differentially expressed in Ddx1 control versus null flies. Thus, in Ddx1 null flies, disruption of gurken translation, rather than gurken RNA/protein localization, may underlie the absence of Gurken protein in the anterior dorsal corner. Intriguingly, it has been shown that the DNA damage response and small RNA processing are required for proper Gurken translation (Chen et al., 2007; Klattenhoff et al., 2007) . Human DDX1 has previously been implicated in both the DNA damage response and small RNA processing (Han et al., 2014; Li et al., 2008) .

Our RNA deep sequencing data indicate that neither TOR nor S6k mRNA levels are significantly affected in Ddx1 AX/AX flies.

Thus, Ddx1 AX /Df(3L)ED230 flies may have slightly higher metabolic function than Ddx1 AX/AX flies.

It is possible that tRNA generation efficiency is reduced in Ddx1 AX/AX flies, but a compensatory mechanism is coming into play.

We were also able to show that Ddx1 protein binds Sirup mRNA, which suggests that this splice site modification is due to a direct interaction with Ddx1, rather than being an indirect downstream consequence of the loss of Ddx1. Previous work has demonstrated that loss of Sirup results in shortened life span and neurodegeneration (Van Vranken et al., 2014) .

Alternatively, recent studies have shown a strong relationship between antisense non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and alternative splicing in humans (Morrissy et al., 2011) . As DDX1 has RNA/RNA unwinding activity, Drosophila Ddx1 may act by unwinding dsRNA formed by ncRNAs bound to mRNA molecules. While it is still not clear whether ncRNAs promote or repress specific splice sites, it is possible that they may act in either fashion, depending on where they bind to target RNAs.",

            "text": "Although the relationship between Ddx1-dependent splice regulation of Sirup mRNA and the metabolic disruption observed in Ddx1 null flies remains a matter of speculation, Sirup's known role in mitochondrial function provides a possible explanation for the epistatic lethality observed in Ddx1 null/Sirup knock-down flies. We propose that Sirup's unspliced form is required for steady state metabolic function. The unspliced form of Sirup retains an early stop codon that produces a transcript that encodes a short 36 aa product missing conserved domains required for succinate dehydrogenase activity. However, there is evidence suggesting that this stop codon undergoes read-through by ribosomes, thereby generating a 145 aa length protein in spite of the stop codon (Dunn et al., 2013) . Under stress conditions, suppression of Ddx1 activity may promote splicing of Sirup mRNA thereby generating a shorter 118 aa product that has reduced succinate dehydrogenase activity. The resulting slowdown in mitochondrial function would reduce resource usage by the cell, allowing it to survive periods of nutrient scarcity. Under this model, the observed epistatic lethality in Ddx1 AX/AX /Sirup knock-down flies would be the result of a reduction in the amount of Sirup mRNA expressed combined with production of the less efficient form of Sirup protein.",
