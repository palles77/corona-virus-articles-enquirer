            "text": "During the last years it has been shown that within the hematopoietic system CD 13 expression is not restricted to myelomonocytic cells. It has been longly known that this antigen is frequently expressed on lymphoid tumour clones. The frequencies of such CD13-positive clones vary between 5 and 30% [13,21] . Recently, it has been proven that other immune cells such as resting lymphocytes and NK cells express membrane-bound APN as well. In contrast to myelomonocytic cells, these cells express low amounts of APN; however, their CD 13 surface expression is increased by different mitogenic stimuli or after co-cultivation with synoviocytes or other CD13-expressing cells [16, [22] [23] [24] . The functional relevance of this induction is unclear as yet, but it has been proposed that APN like other membrane-bound peptidases such as neutral endopeptidase (E.C. 3.4.24.11, CD10) , aminopeptidase A (E.C. 3.4.11.7) or angiotensin-converting enzyme (E.C. 3.4.15.1, CD 143 ) may function as a regulatory molecule that degrades bioactive peptides [5] . The induction of CD 13 on Tcells is generally accompanied by an increase of the corresponding enzymatic activity and APN mRNA level [16, 24] . To gain insight into the mechanism underlying the CD 13 induction on T-lymphocytes, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of the APN gene. Actinomycin D inhibits nearly all RNA synthesis by intercalation into DNA. Furthermore, it also prevents the binding of ribosomes to transcripts and, therefore, subsequent protein synthesis [25] . Using this approach, the half-lives of the APN transcript were determined in different immune cells. The average half-life span of human transcripts is about 10 h, ranging from less than 15 min to more than 24 h [26] . Talking into account these data, the APN half-lives of 3.5-6 h could be considered as medium. Since no data on APN half-life time in any tissue are available, the data obtained in this study can only be compared to those of other glycoproteins. Comparable half-life times were described for annexin VII (3-6 h) , lactoferrin (8-9 h) and myeloperoxidase (4-5 h) [27,28] .",

            "text": "The transcriptional regulation of APN gene expression was revealed by two excellent studies. Both Shapiro and co-workers as well as Olsen and co-workers identified separate promoters that initiate transcription in intestinal epithelial and myeloid cells. In epithelial cells, transcription is controlled by a classical promoter containing a TATA box immediately upstream to the first codon of APN, whereas an alternative GC-rich promoter located about 8 kb upstream from coding region is active in myeloid cells as well as in fibroblasts [29, 30] . Both promoter regions considerably differ with respect to transcription factor-binding sites. The transcription factors LF-B1 and Sp-1 represent the major regulators in epithelial and liver cells, whereas myb and Ets-2 both transactivate CD13 expression in myeloid cells [29, 31] . The importance of promoter-mediated regulation is emphasised by reports showing that modulation of APN surface expression on endometrial cells and leukaemic B-cells is directly linked to the activity of the tissue-specific APN gene promoter [32, 33] .",

            "text": "The transcription of the APN gene in hematopoietic cells is controlled by the alternative promoter [31] . RNA synthesis inhibition leads to a linear decrease of steady-state APN mRNA levels with half-life times of 3.5-6 h in different hem-atopoietic cells. Therefore, it could be assumed that factors involved in APN mRNA degradation seem to be more stable than transcription factors which control the constitutive APN gene expression in resting T-cells. The activation-dependent induction of APN gene expression in T-cells may be due to the action of new transcription factors, an assumption which is supported by the increase of APN-promoter activity detected in stimulated T-cells. Shapiro and co-workers identified putative Sp-1, PU-AP-2, myb-and ETF-binding sites in the alternative promoter which probably contributes to the transcriptional activation of the APN gene [30] . However, the prolonged half-life time of APN-transcript in stimulated Tcells as well as the discrepancy between the 2.7-fold increase of APN transcript level and the 1.7-fold rise of transcription rate in these cells suggest the appearance or disappearance of factors directly involved in the degradation of APN transcript. Post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA decay after stimulation is a common regulatory mechanism described for other transcripts such as the CD 11 a, the mMCP-2 (chymase-homolog protein) [34, 35] .",
