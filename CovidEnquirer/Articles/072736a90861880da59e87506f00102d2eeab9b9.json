Expression of lncRNAs increased substantially following the progression of the infection. Among 645 significantly expressed lncRNAs, the expression of 398 was changed more than 2-fold. More than 80% of them were up-regulated and 80% of them were detected during the late phase. Based on the genomic locations of the deregulated lncRNAs in relation to known mRNAs and miRNAs, they were predicted to be involved in growth, structure, apoptosis and wound healing in the early phase, cell proliferation in the intermediate phase and protein synthesis, modification and transport in the late phase. The most significant functions of cellular RNA-binding proteins, previously shown to interact with the deregulated lncRNAs identified here, are involved in RNA splicing, nuclear export and translation events. We hypothesize that adenoviruses exploit the lncRNA network to optimize their reproduction.",

            "text": "For decades adenoviruses have served as an outstanding model system to study eukaryotic gene structure and expression. They are non-enveloped, icosahedral particles containing a linear, double-stranded DNA molecule. Based on adenovirus gene expression, the replication cycle can be divided into two phases, an early and a late phase, defined by the start of viral DNA replication. Early viral proteins are involved in regulation of the cell cycle and suppression of the cellular antiviral response, whereas the viral structural proteins are synthesized during the late phase (see review by Shenk (1996) ). Based on the cellular gene expression profiles in primary lung fibroblasts, the adenovirus infection can be further divided into four periods. Each period is characterized by deregulation of specific sets of genes. Genes involved in the inhibition of cell growth, control of the cell cycle, regulation of nucleic acid and protein synthesis, and cellular structure are deregulated during the first, second, third, and fourth period, respectively (Zhao et al., 2007) . Most previous studies on the regulation of host cell gene expression during an adenovirus infection have been focused on the mRNA level. Recently, deregulation of cellular microRNA expression has also been addressed (Zhao et al., 2015) .",

LncRNAs are transcripts of more than 200 nucleotides and most of them are 5 0 capped, spliced, and poly-adenylated, but lack open reading frames (ORF) of significant lengths (Derrien et al., 2012) . In general, lncRNAs lack strong conservation and only short regions of them are constrained by structure or sequence-specific interactions. Most of them are present at levels 10 to 100-fold lower than mRNAs although there are exceptions (Palazzo and Gregory, 2014; Palazzo and Lee, 2015) . They are enriched in the nucleus, within the chromatin-associated fraction. They can interact with various chromatin regulatory proteins and recruit them to specific sites on DNA, thereby regulating gene expression (Wang and Chang, 2011) . In addition, several lncRNAs have been shown to play important roles in organizing the nuclear structure, cell growth and survival, migration and differentiation, organismal development and various types of cancers (Gutschner and Diederichs, 2012; Imamachi et al., 2014; Nakagawa et al., 2013; Richards et al., 2015) .",

The most significant class of differentially expressed lncRNAs is antisense RNAs. Antisense RNAs are transcribed from the opposite strands of protein coding genes (sense RNAs). Thus, they have a complementary overlap with the sense RNAs. It has been shown that more than 70% of the protein-coding genes have antisense partners (Katayama et al., 2005; Rosok and Sioud, 2004) . Because of their low evolutionary conservation and expression, they have been considered as junk until recently. Emerging evidence indicates that antisense RNA can regulate gene expression at different levels such as transcription, posttranscriptional processing, RNA stability, transport and translation (Lapidot and Pilpel, 2006; Pelechano and Steinmetz, 2013) .",

            "text": "Few studies have so far examined lncRNA expression during a virus infection. By using deep sequencing, it was shown that the expression of approximately 500 annotated lncRNAs was changed in mice during a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection (Peng et al., 2010) . About 40% of these changes were also detected in mice and mouse embryonic fibroblasts infected with influenza virus A and in response to interferon treatment. There were a higher proportion of down-vs upregulated lncRNAs in SARS-CoV infected mice and in interferon stimulated cells. Deregulation of lncRNA expression has also been demonstrated in lung epithelial cells after influenza A virus infection and in human RD cells after an enterovirus 71 infection by using microarray analysis (Winterling et al., 2014; Yin et al., 2013) . Deregulation of cellular lncRNAs expression was also revealed in HIV-1-infected T cells and eighteen out of 83 lncRNAs tested were differentially expressed (Zhang et al., 2013) . Among them, up-regulation of NEAT1 is interesting. Knockdown of NEAT1 could enhance virus production by increasing nucleus-tocytoplasm export of Rev-dependent instability elementcontaining HIV-1 transcripts. On the other hand NEAT1 is induced by influenza virus and herpes simplex virus infection . Here, we extended these studies to human adenovirus type 2 (Ad2) and studied the deregulation of cellular lncRNA expression in human primary lung fibroblasts (IMR-90) during the course of an Ad2 infection by using deep sequencing.",

Following in-gel tryptic digestion (Shevchenko et al., 2000) , peptides were extracted and analyzed using QExactive Orbitrap Plus Mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) Acquired data (raw-files) were imported into MaxQuant software (version: 1.4) and searched against a FASTA-file containing both cellular and Ad2 proteins. The ratio of the chromatographic areas of heavy and light peptides matching to specific proteins was used for determining the protein expression levels.

Among 21 RBPs that were expressed at the RNA level, 15 were also detected at the protein level. The lower number is most likely due to the limited dynamic range of MS or difficulties in extracting certain proteins. Similar RNA and protein expression profiles were observed for eIF4AIII, UPF1, FUS, IGF2BP1, MOV10, FXR1 and EWSR1. The expression of hnRNPC, QKI, TIAL1, IGF2BP2 and IGF2BP3 was stable at the protein level although their expression at the RNA level was up-(hnRNPC) or down-regulated (TIAL1, IGF2BP2, IGF2BP3, FXR2, TAF15 and QKI). In contrast, expression of CAPRIN1 was slightly up-regulated at the protein level, but its RNA remained constant during infection.

IMR-90 cells have been used in our studies because of the slow progression of the adenovirus infectious cycle which offers possibilities to examine the cellular gene expression changes during different phases of an infection. Our results have shown that deregulation of mRNA and miRNA occurs in a stepwise manner, switching from genes involved in the cell cycle, growth control, and antiviral response in the early phase to those required for DNA, RNA and protein synthesis in the late phase. Using paired-end sequencing, 645 cellular lncRNAs were identified to be expressed in IMR-90 cell before or after adenovirus infection. Among them, the expression of 398 cellular lncRNAs changed more than 2-fold during infection. Two features characterized the change in lncRNA expression; first, the most striking deregulation occurred during the late phase, and second, the majority of the altered lncRNAs were up-regulated (76% and 82% lncRNAs were up-regulated at 24 and 36 hpi, respectively). The fact that 80% of the differentially expressed lncRNAs showed an increasing expression in the late phase suggests that adenovirus genes are responsible for the regulation. Since the biological functions of the bulk of the lncRNAs are unknown, the functional predictions of deregulated lncRNAs were focused on those lncRNAs which were antisense to known genes and those which have been characterized previously. Antisense RNAs are the most noteworthy class of differentially expressed lncRNAs. They have been shown to exert their effects on their sense partners in cis or in trans (Berretta et al., 2008; Camblong et al., 2009; Guttman and Rinn, 2012) . Here, we only studied effects of antisense RNAs on the expression of sense genes in cis.",

            "text": "Clustering analyses showed that deregulation of lncRNA expression correlated with the progression of the infection. Our previous transcriptome studies have shown that the host cell response to the incoming virus is very rapid (Granberg et al., 2006) . Thus, the transiently up-regulated lncRNAs during the early phase (Clusters II and IV) must represent a host cell immediate response to the incoming virus since it occurs before viral gene expression has commenced. The lncRNAs in clusters II and IV overlapped with genes that are involved in cell growth control, rearrangement of cellular structure, transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, as well as wound healing. The up-regulation of lncRNAs in the period between the early and the late phase of infection (Clusters I and III) should be caused by early viral gene activity. The up-regulation of these lncRNAs lasted until the late phase, thus their functions would benefit virus replication. A characteristic of adenovirus is its ability to force infected cells to enter the S-phase, thereby providing optimal condition for viral DNA replication. Among 13 lncRNAs in clusters I and III, RP11-973D8.4 and MIR17HG are most noteworthy. RP11-973D8.4 is an antisense RNA which overlaps with the CDK2 gene. In a complex with cyclin E, which also is up-regulated (Zhao et al., 2012) , CDK2 plays a critical role in the transition from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle. Consistently, similar expression profiles were observed for CDK2 mRNA and RP11-973D88.4 although there was a slight delay. MIR17HG is a precursor for the miRNA in mir17-92 cluster, a well characterized oncogenic miRNA known as oncomir-1. It comprises miR-17, miR-18a, miR-19a, miR-20a and miR-92a and has been shown to be the most significantly deregulated miRNA cluster during an adenovirus infection (Zhao et al., 2015) . Their main targets include E2F, PTEN and BIM which are critical for cell proliferation and apoptosis (Mogilyansky and Rigoutsos, 2013) .",

            "text": "The down-regulation of lncRNAs from the early to the late phase of infection appears to be more complicated and should result from both host cell and adenovirus activities. Among the most significant lncRNAs in this category were the antisense RNAs CTC-428H11.2, CTD-2033D15.3, RP11-366L20.2 and BDNF-AS which overlap with RASA1, THBS1, HMGA2 and BDNF, respectively. These genes showed very similar expression profiles at the RNA level as their antisense RNAs. Both RASA1 and THBS1 are negative regulators of signaling pathways and have been implicated in the regulation of cell growth, proliferation and survival. RASA1 acts as a suppressor of RAS function, thus inhibiting cellular proliferation and differentiation. The role of THBS1 in control of cell growth remains controversial (Sid et al., 2004) . HMGA2 functions as a transcriptional regulator by binding to the CCNB2 promoter, activating its transcription (De Martino et al., 2009 ). HMGA2 activates E2F1 by interacting with pRB and by displacing HDAC1 from the pRB/E2F1 complex. Other significantly down regulated lncRNAs were MIR22HG and MIR29B1, host genes for miR-22 and miR-29b. Expression of miR-22 followed the MIR22HG expression changes, whereas miR-29b was slightly up-regulated at 12 hpi before becoming down-regulated at 24 hpi (Zhao et al., 2015) . miR-22 is known as a tumor suppressor. It inhibits the growth of several different cancer cell lines by targeting the c-Myc binding partner Max and by silencing the c-Myc binding protein MYCBP, a positive regulator of c-Myc (Ting et al., 2010; Xiong et al., 2010) . miR-29 plays diverse roles in different types of cancers and its overexpression has been shown to interfere with bovine viral diarrhea virus replication (Fu et al., 2015) .",

            "text": "In the late phase, expression of lncRNAs increased dramatically. The most significant functions of the protein-coding genes that overlap with the antisense lncRNAs were regulators of transcription, DNA, RNA, and protein metabolism as well as cell cycle and growth control. Genes involved in protein synthesis, modification, and transport became more prominent at 36 hpi. These results were consistent with our earlier transcriptome studies (Zhao et al., 2012 (Zhao et al., , 2003 . More than 75% of the antisense RNAs displayed similar expression changes as the mRNAs from the overlapping protein-coding genes. Several differentially expressed lincRNAs identified here have been characterized previously, including MEG3, XIST, FENDRR, NEAT1, RMRP and CRNDE. It has been shown that the expression of MEG3, a putative tumor suppressor, is lost in many human tumors and tumor cell lines (Zhou et al., 2012) . Reexpression of MEG3 results in accumulation of p53 protein, as well as stimulation of transcription from p53-dependent promoters, inhibiting tumor cell proliferation in culture. Thus we speculated that up-regulation of MEG3 in the late phase is likely to represent a host antiviral response. Increased MEG3 expression could stimulate p53-dependent transcription and prevent adenovirusinduced cell growth. XIST and FENDRR showed similar expression levels and profiles, both being up-regulated from 24 hpi and remaining increased until 36 hpi. It has been shown that they bind the chromatin-modifying complex PRC2 (polycomb-repressive complex 2) and silence gene expression (Wutz, 2011) . XIST plays a role in transcriptional silencing of the X chromosome by recruiting transcriptional silencers and maintaining the inactive state by recruiting PRC2 (Riising et al., 2014) . FENDRR plays an essential role in mammalian embryogenesis (Grote and Herrmann, 2013) . Expression of FENDRR has been detected in the lung, and is associated with a lethal lung developmental disorder (Stankiewicz et al., 2009) .",

Subsequent studies revealed that its expression also is induced after HIV, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), and measles virus (MV) infection Zhang et al., 2013) . Further studies showed that NEAT1 plays an important role in the innate immune response by facilitating the expression of antiviral genes including cytokines like IL-8. We show here that expression of NEAT1 is slightly up-regulated (1.5-fold) at 12 hpi, and then became down-regulated at 36 hpi. Upregulation of NEAT1 at 12 hpi is likely to be a host antiviral response which subsequently was suppressed by the virus during the late phase. Consistently, the expression of IL-8 increased more than 9-fold at 6 hpi, before decreasing 2-, 7-and 15-fold at 12, 24 and 36 hpi (data not shown here).",

In yeast, it is involved in ribosome synthesis, the generation of RNA primers for mitochondrial DNA replication and the degradation of cell cycle-regulated mRNA (Gill et al., 2004; Lygerou et al., 1996; Welting et al., 2004) .

Seventeen SNHGs were differentially expressed with very similar expression patterns, e.g. up-regulated during the late phase except SNHG17. Among them, up-regulation of SNHG19 was very dramatic and reached 23-and 63-fold high at 24 hpi and 36 hpi, respectively. Furthermore, 10 out of 17 SNHGs have been demonstrated to interact with more than 10 RBPs. However, the biological functions of these SNHGs are unknown except for SNHG1, also known as U22HG, which is essential for the maturation of 18S rRNA (Tycowski et al., 1994) . Several deregulated lncRNAs are host genes for miRNAs or involved in regulation of miRNA expression. Besides MIR17HG, MIR22HG, MIRLET7DHG, MIR155HG and MIR29B1 discussed above, FTX harbors 4 miRNAs in its introns, miR-374a, miR-374b, miR-421 and miR-545. In addition, it has been shown that FTX regulates XIST expression, thus playing a major role in X chromosome inactivation (Chureau et al., 2011) . Here, we showed that expression of FTX was down-regulated during the late phase of infection. However, 4 miRNAs generated from FTX intron showed different expression profiles (Zhao et al., 2015) . miR-374a and miR-545 were up-regulated from 12 to 24 hpi and then their expression decreased at 36 hpi. Expression of miR-421 was up-regulated at 36 hpi, whereas miR-374b remained stable during infection. Another miRNA related lncRNA is DANCR, which was up-regulated after 24 hpi. Although DANCR does not encode any miRNA, it blocks miR-320a, miR-199a and miR-214 mediated repression of catenin beta-1 (CTNNB1) expression (Yuan et al., 2015) . CTNNB1 is a subunit of the cadherin protein complex and acts as an intracellular signal transducer in the Wnt signaling pathway. A battle between adenovirus and its host in the control the Wnt signaling pathway has been shown in a previous study (Zhao et al., 2007) . Many cellular genes involved in Wnt signaling were differentially expressed at different stages of infection. An inhibitory effect of the host cell on the Wnt pathway in the early phase is suppressed by the virus during the late phase. Here, we suggest that one of adenovirus mediates activation of Wnt signaling by up-regulation of DANCR.",

Based on information in this database, the differentially expressed lncRNAs identified here should have the potential to interact with 33 RBPs of which 21 were expressed at the RNA level in IMR-90 cells and 15 of them were detected at the protein level. The most important RBPs were eIF4AIII, UPF1 and FUS. They are predicted to interact with more than 50 differentially expressed lncRNAs identified here. Their expression increased during the late phase of the infection. EIF4AIII is a nuclear matrix protein, a member of the DEAD box protein family of putative RNA helicases that are characterized by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD). They are implicated in a number of cellular processes involving alteration of RNA secondary structure, translation initiation, nuclear and mitochondrial splicing, and ribosome and spliceosome assembly. UPF1 is part of a post-splicing multiprotein complex involved in both mRNA nuclear export and mRNA surveillance. FUS belongs to the FET family of RNA-binding proteins which have been implicated in cellular processes, such as regulation of gene expression, maintenance of genomic integrity, as well as mRNA and microRNA processing. The facts that more than 80% of the lncRNAs were up-regulated in the late phase and that many of them are involved in posttranscriptional regulation suggests that cellular lncRNAs play important roles in the late stages of adenovirus replication. The most significantly deregulated lncRNAs and their potential targets, as well as functions are summarized in Fig. 5 . ",
