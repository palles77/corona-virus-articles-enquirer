Four cDNA clones, 5-79, 1 O-99, 6-37, and 4-148, which were previously used for sequence analysis, had been cloned into the Pstl site of pBR322 (Ihara et a/., 1985) . By a series of restriction digestions and ligations with these clones, a full-length PTV M cDNA clone was constructed and inserted into pGEM-3 (Promega Biotech, Madison, WI), designated as pGEM-M. It was found, however, by analysis of protein synthesis in an in vitro transcription and translation system using pGEM-M and by subsequent sequence analysis that pGEM-M contained deletion mutations in the middle of the Gl glycoprotein coding region. It was also found that the sequences preceding the Gl coding sequences seem to have some inhibitory effects on growth of bacterial colonies. Because of these problems, most of the 5'sequence preceding the Gl coding region was removed by digestion with Ba13 1 exonuclease. In order to repair the mutations, the Ncol-Xbal restriction fragment which contains the mutated region was replaced by the corresponding fragment from clone 5-79, one of the original clones used for sequence analysis (Fig. 1) . After transformation and colony selection, two clones were obtained, one of which contained an M fragment beginning with nucleotide residue 702 that had an ATG at nucleotide residue 716, whereas the other contained a fragment beginning with residue 765 and lacked an initiation codon for synthesis of G 1 and G2 glycoproteins.",

As shown in Fig. 6 , lanes fj, only faint bands were seen in the surface immunoprecipitate. No increase in the intensity of Gl or G2 proteins was seen during the chase, indicating that the proteins are not being transported to the cell surface during this time period. It was also confirmed that the ascitic fluids specific for PTV possess virus neutralizing activity, and hence have the ability to react with extracellular forms of PlV glycoproteins (data not shown). In order to determine whether the PlV glycoproteins are secreted, supernatants of W-G-infected cell cultures were examined. At 16 hr p.i., infected cells were labeled with [35S]methioninefor 6 hr, and proteins present in culture media were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. No detectable amount of the Gl or G2 glycoproteins was found in the medium (data not shown).",

Also, the apparent molecular weight of the unglycosylated form of Gl glycoprotein in PTV -infected cells corresponded to the size predicted from sequence analysis (60,000 Da). The observed difference in size (2-3 kDa) between unglycosylated Gl of PTV and of W-G may, therefore, correspond to the extra 24 amino acids preceding the Gl glycoprotein, which are derived from the putative NS~ coding region. In this case, cleavage between Gl and the partial NSM sequence may not take place. Although there seems to be a consensus sequence after alanine for the potential cleavage sites in the putative precursor protein for PTV as well as Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) (Ihara et a/., 1985; Collett et a/., 1985) the present results indicate that an additional factor such as secondary structure of the protein may also be necessary for proper cleavage.

The majority of proteins produced from the VV-G, recombinant remain intracellularly thorughout the infection period. The intracellular location of these glycoproteins was further examined by digestion of proteins with endo H. It is generally considered that the time required for the acquisition of endo H resistance corresponds to the transport time from the RER to the Golgi complex (Strous and Lodish, 1980) . The finding of endo H resistant forms of Gl and G2 glycoproteins indicates that these glycoproteins are transported from the RER to the Golgi complex. Furthermore, after 6 hr treatment with cycloheximide, both glycoproteins were still localized in the Golgi region by immunofluorescence, indicating that these proteins are retained in the Golgi complex. At late times postinfection, small amounts of proteins were detected on the cell surface by 1251-protein A binding assays but not by immunofluorescence. Since these glycoproteins were retained in the Golgi region for 6 hr in the presence of cycloheximide, any transport from the Golgi complex to the cell surface must be extremely slow if it takes place. Cell-surface expression of small amounts of glycoproteins has also been reported for other bunyaviruses (Kuismanen et a/., 1982; Madoff and Lenard, 1982; Gahmberg et a/., 1986) . However, these proteins may be present on cell-associated virions (Smith and Pifat, 1982 Schmaljohn eta/., 1987). Unlike PTV or RVFV, the HTN M genome segment lacks the 5' sequences which may encode another protein. Instead it possesses 18 amino acids following the first ATG of the M segment, and preceding the Gl glycoprotein, which may simply act as a signal peptide. These results, as well as the present observations, indicate that the glycoproteins of bunyavirus are synthesized, processed, and localized properly without a requirement for any other viral components, such as viral nucleocapsid or virus-coded nonstructural",
