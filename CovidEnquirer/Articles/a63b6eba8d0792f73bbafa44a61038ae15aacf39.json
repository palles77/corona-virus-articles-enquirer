            "text": "Background: Rhinovirus-induced acute asthma is the most frequent trigger for asthma exacerbations. Objective: We assessed which inflammatory mediators were released from bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) after infection with rhinovirus and then determined whether they were also present in subjects with acute virus-induced asthma, with the aim to identify a biomarker or biomarkers for acute virus-induced asthma. Methods: BECs were obtained from bronchial brushings of steroidnaive asthmatic subjects and healthy nonatopic control subjects. Cells were infected with rhinovirus 16. Inflammatory mediators were measured by means of flow cytometry with a cytometric bead array. Subjects with acute asthma and virus infection were recruited; they were characterized clinically by using lung function tests and had blood taken to measure the inflammatory mediators identified as important by the BEC experiments. Results: IFN-g-induced protein 10 (IP-10) and RANTES were released in the greatest quantities, followed by IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-a. Dexamethasone treatment of BECs only partially suppressed IP-10 and TNF-a but was more effective at suppressing RANTES, IL-6, and IL-8. In acute clinical asthma serum IP-10 levels were increased to a greater extent in those with acute virus-induced asthma (median of 604 pg/mL compared with 167 pg/mL in those with non-virus-induced acute asthma, P < .01). Increased serum IP-10 levels were predictive of virus-induced asthma (odds ratio, 44.3 [95% CI, 3.9-100.3]). Increased serum IP-10 levels were strongly associated with more severe airflow obstruction (r 5 20.8; P < .01). Conclusions: IP-10 release is specific to acute virus-induced asthma. Clinical implications: Measurement of serum IP-10 could be used to predict a viral trigger to acute asthma. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2007;120:586-93.) ",

            "text": "Viral respiratory tract infections are the most common trigger for asthma exacerbations, 1,2 including the most severe requiring hospitalization, 3 with human rhinoviruses the most frequently isolated pathogen. In a cohort of children at high risk for asthma, rhinovirus-induced lower respiratory tract symptoms were the strongest predictor for recurrent wheeze. 4 Although treatment with corticosteroids has clearly improved long-term asthma control, they appear to be significantly less effective in preventing virus-associated acute exacerbations of disease in children. 5, 6 In adults virus-induced acute asthma has been associated with a specific inflammatory phenotype characterized by neutrophilic inflammation that was directly related to clinical severity but that also appeared to respond less well to treatment with corticosteroids. 7 These observations are supported by the finding that moderate doses of inhaled steroids only partially affect the airway inflammation in experimental rhinovirus-induced asthma. 8 These clinical observations suggest that rhinovirus infection has the ability to induce a specific inflammatory response in predisposed individuals that results in worsened asthmatic symptoms and increased airway inflammation poorly controlled by current treatment with corticosteroids. Therefore the ability to clearly identify this group clinically will be important if new treatment targets are developed for virus-induced acute asthma.",

We used primary bronchial epithelial cell (BEC) models of rhinovirus infection to determine whether there were specific mediators released after rhinovirus infection and whether these differed quantitatively or qualitatively in BECs derived from asthmatic subjects.

There were no differences seen between subjects with asthma and healthy control subjects, although there was substantial within-group variation. In the context of severe acute asthma in subjects presenting to the emergency department, serum IP-10 levels were acutely increased in the sera of those with acute virus-induced asthma, and increased serum IP-10 levels, in combination with low TNF-a levels, were predictive of a virus-induced cause as the trigger for acute asthma. Finally, levels of serum IP-10 at presentation of subjects with acute asthma were strongly associated with more severe airflow obstruction and a reduced b 2 -agonist bronchodilator response during their initial emergency department presentation.",

            "text": "Although rhinovirus infection of the epithelium does not lead to widespread epithelial desquamation, it has been proposed that cold symptoms and acute exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are triggered by virus-induced release of proinflammatory mediators. Previous in vitro studies of rhinovirus infection of human cultured airway epithelium have shown virusspecific induction and release of RANTES, IL-8, IL-6, GM-CSF, TNF-a, and IL-1b. [17] [18] [19] These findings are supported by increases in these mediators found in natural rhinovirus infection 20 and experimental rhinovirus infection in asthma. 8 Our work has confirmed these findings and, to our knowledge, is the first to extend them by examining the response of primary BECs derived from subjects with asthma and nonatopic control subjects. We were unable to detect any differences between the groups, although we observed substantial within-group variation in mediator responses. The inherent variation seen within groups was not due to testing inaccuracy because there was excellent agreement between 2 separate mediator detection methods (ELISA and flow cytometry) and all experiments were performed in duplicate. The mediators showing the greatest magnitude of response to RV-16 were IP-10 and RANTES. RANTES is an important chemoattractant for eosinophils and T lymphocytes and is overexpressed in allergic airway inflammation. 21 In vitro induction of RANTES by rhinovirus infection of BECs has been shown to be specific to replicating virus, 18 is triggered by rhinovirus RNA, and is closely related to levels of viral replication in BECs. 22 However, RANTES production in BECs also occurs as a consequence of exposure to house dust mite allergen (Der p 1) and therefore is not specific to virus infection. 23 IP-10, or CXCL-10, is a chemokine ligand that has been shown to be induced in BECs after infection with RV-16, with a close link to rhinovirus replication and through a mechanism that is not dependent on prior induction by either IFN-g or the type I IFNs IFN-a and IFN-b. 24 It is suggested that IP-10 release might be triggered through double-stranded viral RNA reacting with Toll-like receptor 3 and leading to the translocation of nuclear factor kB to the nucleus. 24 Activation of Toll-like receptor 3 has been shown to lead to the translocation of IFN response factor 3, and this has induced production of both IP-10 All values are expressed as medians and interquartile ranges. *Significantly different from non-virus-induced acute asthma at presentation (P < .001, Mann-Whitney U test).

            "text": "and IFN-b. 25 In support of this, we found a correlation between levels of IP-10 and RANTES released along with rhinovirus replication in BECs. However, rhinovirus replication was much greater in BECs from asthmatic subjects independent of the inflammatory response that was also seen. We have previously demonstrated that BECs from asthmatic subjects are more susceptible to infection with rhinovirus, and they respond to infection with a deficient type I IFN response that is associated with increased cytolysis, which is directly related to enhanced rhinovirus replication. 26 These results therefore support the concept in BECs from asthmatic subjects that there is a deficient innate immune response that does not adequately react to the levels of rhinovirus replication, although they are still capable of releasing sufficient inflammatory mediators to recruit and activate inflammatory cells to the airways that worsen tissue injury. IP-10 interacts with CXCR3, a receptor that is highly expressed on activated CD4 1 , CD8 1 , and natural killer T cells and stimulates directional migration of these cells. 27 T cells expressing CXCR3 have usually been associated with sites of T H 1 inflammation, 28, 29 and IP-10 has even been reported to be antagonistic to T H 2 cells. 30 In an OVA-sensitized mouse model, overexpression of IP-10 decreased IL-4 release and eosinophil recruitment to the airways. However, when IP-10 was administered exogenously to the lungs of mice that already had established allergic inflammation, there was an increase in eosinophil accumulation in the lungs and increased IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 levels, and although airway responsiveness was initially dampened, it rebounded by 24 hours. 31 However, CXCR3 is not exclusive to T H 1 cells, with low levels of expression on T H 2 cells, 32 and when these T H 2 cells are activated, they appear to be selectively recruited to the airways. 31, 33, 34 These events clearly indicate that in individuals with established allergic inflammation, IP-10 is capable of worsening preexisting asthmatic airway inflammation and, in association with TNF-a, might lead to a marked worsening in airway inflammation and epithelial permeability. It is of particular note that IP-10 and TNF-a were not as sensitive to suppression with dexamethasone, although RANTES IL-8 and IL-6 production were. This is in keeping with experimental findings that moderate doses of inhaled corticosteroids are effective in reducing bronchial hyperresponsiveness and infiltration with eosinophils but do not prevent the accumulation of cytotoxic T cells within the airways after experimental RV-16 infection. 8 Involvement of IP-10 and CXCR3 in acute virus-induced asthma might identify signalling pathways that are not as responsive to treatment with corticosteroids and help explain their lack of efficacy in this cause of acute asthma. 5, 6, 35 We sought to determine whether these early events resulting from BEC infection with RV-16 also led to a similar pattern of mediator release in the sera of subjects presenting with acute asthma. By using a cohort presenting to the emergency department with acute asthma, increased IP-10 levels were highly specific for acute asthma with evidence of virus infection. Levels of serum RANTES were not detected, and this might in part be explained by our in vitro observation that production of this cytokine was more effectively suppressed by corticosteroids. Nearly all the subjects with acute asthma were regularly using inhaled corticosteroids, and this might have been sufficient to reduce RANTES release but not sufficient to reduce the release of IP-10. This is in keeping with our BEC model that only saw suppression of IP-10 at a 10-fold higher dose of dexamethasone.",

Although rhinovirus seemed to induce a smaller increase in IP-10 levels than other viruses, an increase of IP-10 level to 168 pg/mL or higher was powerful in predicting all virus-triggered asthma exacerbations. This suggests that serum IP-10 levels can be used to differentiate acute virus-induced asthma from non-virus-induced acute asthma. Although at the moment no specific antiviral therapies have undergone a trial in acute virus-induced asthma, effective antirhinovirus agents exist, 36 and a simple blood test that identifies those who might benefit would be instrumental in allowing such trials to go forward. Because we did not have a control group without asthma but with an upper respiratory tract infection, we are unable to determine whether the magnitude of increase in IP-10 level is greater in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic subjects. Viral infections elsewhere in the body might also induce the release of IP-10. Its induction has been well characterized in chronic hepatitis C infection, and it can even be used to predict response to treatment with IFN and ribavarin. 37 Therefore other viral infections would likely also induce an increase in serum IP-10 level and reduce its specificity to predict acute virus-induced asthma. However, it is very unlikely that our clinical subjects had other viral infections. We recruited adults who reported symptoms of a recent upper respiratory tract infection. None of the subjects had another acute illness at presentation. We did not enquire about possible chronic viral infections, such as hepatitis B or C, but believe it is most unlikely that their presence would have confounded our results in these circumstances. The fact that IP-10 levels decreased dramatically at follow-up is highly suggestive that they were directly related to the acute trigger and that chronic infection was not prevalent in our sample.",

Subjects with severe asthma are known to have higher levels of TNF-a than subjects with milder asthma 43 ; it might be that those with non-virus-induced asthma had more inherently unstable chronic asthma, and this predisposed them to exacerbate, although they did not have lower lung function, nor did they use higher doses of inhaled corticosteroids. It might also simply be that the non-virus-induced acute triggers led to a greater induction of TNF-a than virusinduced acute asthma.",

            "text": "In conclusion, our results have shown, using an in vitro model of primary BECs, that rhinovirus is capable of initiating an intense inflammatory response from BECs with marked release of IP-10 and RANTES, which correlates with in vitro rhinovirus replication. We have confirmed, using a cohort of acute asthmatic subjects, that there is increased serum IP-10 release, which appears to be highly specific for virus-induced acute asthma and is also associated with more severe airflow obstruction and a reduced bronchodilator response. These results demonstrate that IP-10, perhaps in combination with TNF-a, might be a useful clinical maker to identify rhinovirus-and other virus-induced induced acute asthma and suggests that either IP-10 or CXCR3 has a prominent role in worsening airflow obstruction and airway inflammation in acute rhinovirus-induced asthma, highlighting them as potential therapeutic targets.",
