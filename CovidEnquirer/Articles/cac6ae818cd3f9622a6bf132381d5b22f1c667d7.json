Three pairs of vicinal oxygen-substituted carbons were assigned from the COSY correlations between signals at ~ 4.38 (H-3) and 4.14 (H-4), 4.01 (H-6) and 3.34 (H-7), and 4.71 (I-I-15) and 3.86 (H-16), and the wealth of HMBC correlations (Table 1) allowed their positions on the sterol nucleus to be assigned. The final oxygen-substituted carbon was located at C-23 of a 24-methyl substituted side chain on the basis of I-IMBC correlations from both Me-26 and Me-27 to C-24 and C-25 and from Me-28 to C-23, C-24 and C-25. Furthermore, a correlation between H-16 and C-23 provided evidence for the position of the ether ring. Chemical shift data suggested that the sulfate and sulfamate groups were at C-3 and C-15. Hydrolysis ofhaplosamate A in 1:1 dioxane-pyridine at 130\u00b0C for 2 hr. gave the desulfated derivative 3 that retained the N-methyl sulfamate group (6H 3.59 and 3.63). The observed shift of the H-3 signal from 8 4.38 in 1 to 3.87 in 3 indicated that the sulfate ester was at C-3 and thus the sulfamate group was at C-15. By default, there are three hydroxyl groups at C-4, C-6 and C-7. Placement of the N-methyl sulfamate group at C-15 explains the presence of two N-methyl signals in the NMR spectra. Hydrogen bonding of the NH proton to the ether oxygen allows the N-methyl group to adopt two conformations as illustrated in Figure 2. The two isomers present as a result of the sulfamet\u00a2 functionality The relative stercochmistry of haplosamatc A (1) was assigned primmly on the basis of NOESY data. Very strong correlations were observed between the signal at 5 1.50 (I-I-5) and those at 4.14 (H-4), 4.01 CrI-6) and 3.34 (H-7), thereby placing all four protons on the same face of the molecule. The small coupling constants associated with H-3, H-4 and H-6 are consistent with an equatorial conformation for each of these protons and the unusual chemical shift of the Me-19 signal at 8 1.32 is typical ofa 4~),6~l-dihydroxy sterol, n The throe large coupling constants associated with H-8 indicate that H=7, H-g, H=9 and H= 14 are all axial and the hydroxyl group at C-7 then has the equatorial conformation. The w-coupling between Me=19 and H-5 and H-9 and betw~n Me=l 8 and H-14 established the normal all-trans sterol nucleus. The NOESY correlations between H= 14 and both H-15 and H-17 and between Me= 18 and H-16 established the stereochemistry about the D-ring while correlations from H=16 to H=20 and H=23 defined the stereochemistry about the ether ring.",

Haplosamate B (2) gave rise to strong IR bands at 1195 and 1040 cm \"t, and 1380 and 1090 cm \"~, indicative of sulfate and sulfamate moieties. The )H NMR spectrum differed from that of(l) in the region 8 3.4 -4.9, where the shifts for protons attached to carbons beating oxygen were observed somewhat downfield compared to those in (1). Most notable were the shifts for H-6 (8 4.51 in 2:4.01 in 1), H-7 (3.96 in 2:3.34 in 1), H-g (2.53 in 2:2.26 in 1) and H-15 (4.85 in 2:4.71 in l). In the ~3C NMR data, there were notable differences in the chemical shifts for C=6 (8 76.8 in 2:78.0 in 1) and C=7 (84.2 in 2:80.0 in l). Based on these chemical shift considerations and comparison with literature values for other hydroxylated and sulfated sterols, n the sulfate group was placed at C-7. All other data, including COSY, HMQC, HMBC and NOESY spectra, were compatible with the structure proposed for haplosamate B (2).",
