A method of derivation was developed and several indexes, such as tourism mean center, and tourism standard distance are further applied to measure temporalspatial changes between the two adjoining cities. The results reveal the dynamic tourism spatial interaction between Beijing and Tianjin has been influenced by a range of factors including population, destination attractiveness, disposable income and income elasticity, changes in the domestic and international spatial structure of tourist flows and how destination management organizations react to the changes. The study has implications for both the research and practice of city transportation and tourism development.",

By the end of 2017, China's HSR network had grown to 25,000 km (China Ministry of Transport, 2018) and is planned to increase to 30,000 km by 2020 (China Ministry of Transport, 2017) . It is expected that the temporal and spatial changes facilitated by the HSR system (Chen, 2019) will both booster domestic tourism flows and generate significant changes in the structure of tourism flows . Theoretically, the compression of travel time and space induced by short-distance HSR services provides opportunities for adjoining cities to be regarded as the \"same city\". In practice, however, adjoining cities tend to operate independently, and each can be expected to adopt strategies that will increase its competitiveness vis \u00e0 vis the other city. Understanding the current spatial relationship between adjacent cities and the impact potential impact of HSR has important implications in relation to collaboration on tourism policy development and planning.",

Empirical studies conducted in China show that there has been an increase in accessibility of all cities and regions along HSR lines (Liu and Zhang, 2018) . Research has also found that regional economic disparity has decreased since the introduction of HSR (Chen and Haynes, 2017) , with the exception of a number of central-Eastern cities where there is some evidence that they might gained greater accessibility benefits from HSR than other regions (Cao et al., 2013) . HSR promotes wider destination choice, which can create significant changes in the spatial distribution of tourism resources .",

This study aims to contribute to the transport and tourism literatures by addressing this gap by assessing the impact of high-speed railway on tourism spatial structures between two adjoining metropolitan cities. We chose Beijing and Tianjin for this study based on the size of the two cities, their adjacent location, welldeveloped tourism infrastructure, and the length of time that HSR has been operating (Wang et al., 2018) . Specifically, this study attempts to understand: a) the impact that HSR can have on the dynamics of tourism spatial interaction between Beijing and Tianjin; b) the changes in spatial structure of both international and domestic tourist flows between the city pair. In addition, we also examine how each city responded to the impacts of HSR in its tourism development and https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2019.102495 Received 3 June 2019; Received in revised form 8 August 2019; Accepted 14 August 2019 marketing policies, as evidenced by the impact of high-speed rail on tourism spatial structure.",

In general, tourism demand is negatively related to distance, i.e. the longer the distance, the smaller the demand. This is the so-called \"distance-decay effect\" (Bull, 1991) . Geographic distance is invariable, but travel time can be reduced with the introduction of new transportation technology thus stimulating tourism demand. In addition, reduced travel time enables tourists to spend more time enjoying tourism activities at a destination. Travel time thus replaces distance as a determinant of tourist demand in the gravity model, widely used to investigate interaction between spaces (Gu and Pang, 2008; Prideaux, 2000) . The result is time-space compression known as the \"time compression effect\" of HSR (Wang et al., 2018) . The \"time compression effect\" also provides destinations connected to the HSR network with the opportunity to grow the level of tourist arrivals to that destination (Zhou and Li, 2018) .",

Plassard (1991) observed that a centralizing effect occurred in France where Paris has become the center of the star-shaped TGV network. Masson and Petiot (2009) noted that after the introduction of HSR between Paris and Marseille in 2001 there was an increase in short stay travel to Marseille and as well as a change in travel by specific market sectors such as seniors and international travelers. However, the introduction of HSR does not automatically lead to increased tourist flows. The construction of a HSR line from Perpignan in southern France to Spain generated increased flows of French visitors to Spain but not of French visitors to Perpignan (Masson and Petiot, 2009) , because French tourists were more attracted to Spanish cities such as Barcelona than Perpignan.",

We found that domestic and international tourists exhibited different distribution patterns. The mean center of domestic tourist's distribution was closer to Beijing than that of international tourists. Domestic tourists initially concentrated in Beijing after the opening of HSR services but became more interested in Tianjin after more frequent HSR services were added. This is a new finding that has not been previously reported. In contrast, the spatial structure of international tourist has continued to move towards Tianjin with or without HSR, which is consistent with the findings by Chen and Haynes (2015) and Pagliara et al.

For example, the relationship between the opening of the HSR and the change in the location of the mean center appears to be an example of the operation of the \"structuring effect\" where firms, in this case Beijing's tourism sector, were able to take advantage of the change and boost business. It is also apparent that in the post 2008 period there was a change in the intensity of competition which in turn influenced the location of tourism firms. This change highlights how the intensity of competition between connected destinations may increase because of the agglomeration effect as described by Masson and Petiot (2009) and Yan et al.
