Our recent study indicated that SARS-CoV infection induces activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and the p38 MAPK inhibitor partially inhibited its cytopathic effect in Vero E6 cells. The results of the present study indicated that before cell death, Akt, which is an inhibitor of apoptosis, was also activated in response to viral replication. Phosphorylation of a serine residue on Akt was detected at least 8 h postinfection (hpi), which declined after 18 hpi. Thus, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway is activated in virus-infected Vero E6 cells. However, a threonine residue was not phosphorylated. A downstream target of Akt, glycogen synthase kinase 3h (GSK-3h), was slightly phosphorylated, indicating that the level of activation of Akt was very low. PKC~, which is downstream of the PI3K pathway, was also phosphorylated in virus-infected cells. These results suggested that weak activation of Akt cannot prevent apoptosis induced by SARS-CoV infection in Vero E6 cells.",

Although the mechanism of SARS pathogenesis in vivo may involve both the effect of viral replication in target cells and immune responses, there is a lack of molecular pathological data including signaling pathways of SARS-coronavirus (CoV) infection. Recently, we reported that infection with SARS-CoV caused apoptosis in Vero E6 cells and that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was activated during infection (Mizutani et al., 2004) . Thus, it is important to investigate the apoptotic events that occur in SARS-CoV-infected cells to understand the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV. Generally, both proapoptotic and pro-survival signaling pathways are activated after apoptotic signaling, and there are many pro-and anti-apoptotic proteins involved in these pathways in cells. The present study was performed to clarify the activated signaling pathways related to apoptotic events in SARS-CoVinfected Vero E6 cells.",

            "text": "One such signaling pathway, protein kinase B (PKB), known as Akt, has been studied intensively (Toker, 2000;  Brazil and Hemmings, 2001; Scheid and Woodgett, 2003) . Akt is phosphorylated at both serine 473 and threonine 308 residues through a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)dependent mechanism on stimulation by growth factors, insulin, and hormones (Welch et al., 1998 ). An important function of activated Akt in cells is inhibition of apoptosis. Downstream targets of Akt induce cell survival via phosphorylation of the forkhead transcription factor (FKHR) family, glycogen synthase kinase 3h (GSK-3h), caspase-9, and Bad (Cardone et al., 1998; Cross et al., 1995; Datta et al., 1997) . To examine the phosphorylation of Akt in virus-infected cells, Western blotting analysis was performed using anti-phospho Akt antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1A , serine 473 of Akt was phosphorylated at 8 hpi by SARS-CoV. The phosphorylated serine 473 of Akt began to accumulate at least 8 hpi and maximal phosphorylation was observed at 18 hpi. Western blotting analysis with a phosphorylation-state-independent anti-Akt antibody revealed the presence of Akt in Vero E6 cells, whereas a threonine 308 phosphorylation-state-dependent antibody failed to demonstrate the presence of threonine 308 phosphorylated Akt in virus-infected cells (Fig. 1A ). In addition, serine phosphorylation was dependent on SARS-CoV infection into Vero E6 cells, because the UVinactivated virus failed to induce serine phosphorylation. Brief stimulation by epidermal growth factor (EGF) also showed only serine 473 phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 1B) , suggesting that threonine 308 of Akt is difficult to phosphorylate in Vero E6 cells. Therefore, total activity of Akt may be low in Vero E6 cells. However, it is possible that the anti-phospho Akt (threonine 308) antibody used in the present study is unable to recognize threonine phosphorylation of Akt in Vero E6 cells as the datasheet included no description of cross-reactivity with monkey. To investigate whether SARS-CoV-induced Akt serine phosphorylation represented a biologically active kinase, we examined the in vitro kinase activity of phosphorylated Akt in SARS-CoV-infected cells. The SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells were lysed at 18 hpi and serine 473phosphorylated Akt in the cell lysate was precipitated by anti-serine 473-phosphorylated Akt antibody. GSK-3h protein was added to the immunoprecipitated phosphorylated Akt with ATP, and Western blotting was performed using anti-phosphorylated GSK-3a/h (Ser21/9) antibody. As shown in Fig. 1C , immunoprecipitated Akt was almost at the same amount between SARS-CoV-infected cells and mock-infected cells at 18 hpi. The amount of serine 473phosphorylated Akt in SARS-CoV-infected cells was higher than that in mock-infected controls. The level of phosphorylation of GSK-3a/h in virus-infected cells was slightly higher than that in mock-infected controls. These results strongly suggested that Akt in Vero E6 cells was phosphorylated only at serine residues by SARS-CoV infection, but the level of activity of Akt was low.",

            "text": "To investigate phosphorylation of up-and downstream targets of Akt in virus-infected cells, Western blotting analysis was performed. Of the Akt targets mentioned above, the level of phosphorylation of GSK-3h (Ser9) was slightly increased, while phosphorylated Bad and FKHR were not detected (Fig. 1C ). GSK-3 h is a pro-apoptotic signaling molecule and is inactivated by phosphorylation of the Nterminal serine residue Ser9 (Pap and Cooper, 1998) . Therefore, these results suggested that the phosphorylation of Akt in Vero E6 cells results in a low level of anti-apoptotic response to SARS-CoV infection. Recent studies explained the activation cycle of Akt as outlined below (Toker, 2000; Brazil and Hemmings, 2001; Scheid and Woodgett, 2003) . Activation of PI3K results in local accumulation of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns)-3,4,5-triphosphate (P3) at the plasma membrane, and PTEN phosphatase inhibits PI3K signaling. Cytosolic Akt is inactive and the activity of cytosolic PDK-1 is low. PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 recruits PDK-1 and Akt to the plasma membrane, and then Akt is autophosphorylated at serine 473. After PDK-1 activation on the plasma membrane, PDK-1 phosphorylates Akt on threonine 308, and then Akt shows a high level of activity. Thus, activation of upstream kinases of Akt is important for the activation of Akt. Fig. 1C shows that the amounts of both phosphorylated PTEN and PDK-1 were not significantly altered in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells. Therefore, these results may explain why no increase in threonine 308 phosphorylation of Akt was observed on virus infection.",

They reported that SARS-CoV S protein is cleaved in the presence of trypsin and that the cleaved S induces cell fusion. Their results suggested that SARS-CoV enters cells via endocytosis. Before a virus infection experiment, to verify that LY294002 has no effect on acidification of intracellular compartments in Vero E6 cells, LY294002 was added to the cells, followed by staining with acridine orange to detect intracellular acidic compartments (Mizutani et al., 2003) .

PKC~was originally discovered as a unique PKC isotype (Ono et al., 1989) . B cell survival by nerve growth factor (NGF) is mediated by PI3K-dependent activation of PKC~ (Kronfeld et al., 2002) and Akt could interact with PKC~ (Konishi et al., 1994) . To determine if PKC~is phosphorylated by SARS-CoV infection, Western blotting analysis was performed using an anti-phospho PKC~(Thr410) antibody. As shown in Fig. 3 , PKC~was phosphorylated at 8 hpi, suggesting that PKC~is activated as an anti-apoptotic response to virus infection. The antibody used in the present study can also detect phosphorylated PKCE, and the function of PKC~is still not clear. A novel PKC subfamily PKCu was also very slightly phosphorylated by virus infection. In addition, PKCa/hII and y (Ser643) were always phosphorylated in both virus-infected and mock-infected cells. These results suggested that the interaction of phosphorylation of PKCw ith Akt plays an important role in protection against SARS-CoV infection (Fig. 4) .",

In virus infection, two conflicting cellular programs are triggered in cells: apoptosis to eliminate virus-infected cells and cell survival delaying cell death to alert naive cells by producing antiviral cytokines.

The role of p38 MAPK signaling in cellular responses is diverse depending on the cell type and stimulus. For example, p38 MAPK signaling has been shown to promote cell death as well as to enhance cell growth and survival (Juretic et al., 2001; Liu et al., 2001; Yosimichi et al., 2001) . In virus-infected Vero E6 cells, CREB and HSP-27, which have anti-apoptotic roles, were shown to be phosphorylated (Mizutani et al., 2004) . Therefore, pro-apoptotic molecules downstream of targets of p38 MAPK may exist in Vero E6 cells. On the other hand, Akt, which is a key regulator of cell survival events, targets several different cytoplasmic proteins, including pro-apoptotic molecules, such as GSK3h, caspase-9, Bad, and FKHR. Phosphorylation of these proteins by Akt generally results in their inactivation and inability to activate pro-apoptotic pathways. In the present study, phosphorylation of GSK3h serine 9 was found in virus-infected cells. However, our results suggested that the level of phosphorylation of GSK3h is not sufficient to prevent apoptosis.",
