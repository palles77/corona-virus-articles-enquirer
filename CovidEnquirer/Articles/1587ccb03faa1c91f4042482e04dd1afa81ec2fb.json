For the classic European strain (CV777) of PEDV, mortality rates, while significant, are not viewed as a severe threat to European pork production (Coussement et al., 1982; Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978) . Since 2010, variant strains of PEDV that differ from the classic European strain appeared in China, South Korea, Japan, and many Asian countries, causing up to 100% mortality in suckling piglets (Chen et al., 2010; Song and Park, 2012) . In May 2013, PEDV was identified as a new cause of neonatal diarrhea in Iowa and rapidly spread to more than 30 states, Canada and Mexico and caused significant economic losses in the swine industry (Huang et al., 2013; Stevenson et al., 2013) . Sequence analyses suggest that US PEDV strains originated from China (Huang et al., 2013) .",

As shown in Table 1 , the VN titer of four PdCV sera ranged from 382 to 544 and no VN titer was detected in PEDV and control sera when PdCV was used as antigens. Thus, only PdCV immune serum neutralized infectivity of PdCV; neither control sera nor PEDV specific antisera neutralized PdCV. A similar homologous relationship was found when PdCV serum was tested for neutralizing activity against PEDV; cross-neutralizations were not observed. The PEDV-specific VN titer of four PEDV-infected piglets ranged from 230 to 256, and no PEDV-specific VN titer was detected in PdCV and control sera.",

After fixation and staining, the plaques were counted and 50% plaque reduction titers were calculated as the PEDV or PdCV-specific VN antibody titers. The assay was repeated for 3 times for each sample. 4.7. Detection of PEDV and PdCV-specific antibody by ELISA Ninety-six-well plates were coated with 50 ml of highly purified PEDV or PdCV (2.5 mg/ml) in 50 mM NaCO 3 buffer (pH 9.6) at 4 C overnight. Briefly, serum samples were 2-fold-serially diluted and added to PEDV or PdCV antigen-coated wells. After incubation at room temperature for 1 h, the plates were washed five times with PBS-Tween (0.05%), followed by incubation with 50 ml of goat antiswine IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma) in 4% normal goat serum in PBST at a dilution of 1:80,000 for 1 h. Plates were washed and developed with 75 ml of 3,3 0 ,5,5 0 -tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), and the optical density (OD) at 450 nm was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plate reader. End point titer values were determined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution that had an absorbance value greater than background level (DMEM control).",

Confluent ST cells were infected with PEDV VBS2 strain or PdCV Michigan/8977/2014 strain at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1.0. After 1 h absorption, the inoculum was removed, the cells were washed once with DMEM, and fresh DMEM (supplemented with 5 mg/ml trypsin 1:250) was added, and the infected cells were incubated at 37 C. When cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed, the cells were fixed with 4.0% (v/v) paraformaldehyde-0.2% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (PPB), pH 7.4, for 15 min, 22 C, followed by washing 3 times with PBS. After permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min, the cells were washed with PBS, blocked with PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, 22 C. Then cells were incubated with PEDV or PdCV polyclonal antibody. After 3 washes with PBS, the cells were further incubated with FITC-labeled rabbit anti-pig secondary antibody overnight at 4 C. After 3 washes with PBS, samples were examined under Olympus fluorescent microscope system at The Ohio State University. Photos at upper panels were taken under a light microscope (100\u00c2). Photos at lower panels were taken under an immunofluorescent microscope (100\u00c2). (B). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of small intestine sections from Gn piglets. PEDV VBS2 infected duodenal tissue at 72 h PI, PdCV infected Michigan/8977/2014 duodenal tissue at 72 h PI, or uninfected controls were stained with anti-PEDV serum or anti-PdCV serum. Black arrows indicate positive antigens. Hematoxylin, 300\u00c2. Five-micron sections of paraffin-embedded tissues were placed onto positively charged slides. After deparaffinization, sections were incubated with target retrieval solution (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) for antigen retrieval. After blocking, a primary anti-PdCV or PEDV serum antibody was incubated for 30 min, 22 C followed by incubation with a biotinylated horse anti-pig IgG secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Slides were further incubated with ABC Elite complex to probe biotin (Vector Laboratories) and then developed using a 3,3 0 -diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogen Kit (Dako); hematoxylin was used as a counterstain.",

The proteins were transferred onto a Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ) in a Trans-Blot semidry electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The blots were blocked in 5% skim milk in PBST (phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.02% Tween) and incubated with each antibody at a dilution of 1:100 in blocking buffer. Afterwards, the blot was incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-pig IgG secondary antibody (1:2,500 dilution).
