Methods: Feces samples from 82 diarrheic dairy calves from farms around Tiaret (Western Algeria) were collected. These samples were tested by ELISA assay. Results: The results showed that the prevalence of rotavirus and coronavirus infection are 14.63% (12.2% alone and 2.43% associated with bovine coronavirus) and 20.73% (18.3% alone and 2.43% associated with GARV), respectively. Conclusions: The present study demonstrates that the both BCoV and GARV are involved in the neonatal calves' diarrhea, where the frequency of BCoV is clearly higher than that of GARV.",

Briefly, 26 of the calves included in this study were 1-7 d old, and 13 presented BCoV alone and 2 calves (2.43%) were associated with GARV. Likewise, GARV infections were detected in 12 calves (14.63%). GARV was the only agent detected in 10 calves (12.2%), the remainder of GARV (2.43%) infections is combined with BCoV (Table 1) . Table 2 summarizes the proportions of positive samples as for the two enteropathogens during the four weeks of life. ",

The 2-and 4-week-old calves were the most susceptible to GARV and BCoV infections, which may be due to decreasing of passive immunity and the absence of the natural resistance against infection for both enteropathogens. The presence of BCoV infection in older calves (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) d) could be explained by the method of livestock farming of calves (using the grouping of the calves instead of individual stall). The 3-weeks-old calves are characterized by absence of GARV, this may be highlighted by an increased natural resistance against infection for this enteropathogen and small number of sample cooperated with 1 and 4 age-group, in spite of the absence of significant difference among the various age-groups.",

Whereas, in our study the percentage of the females affected by rotavirus is superior to males.

Furthermore, the multifactorial etiology (bacterial, viral and protozoa agents) influenced by nutritional and environmental factors, as well as difficulties in the clinical diagnosis of neonatal diarrhea and failure of the treatment in young calves affected by diarrhea require to adopt the prophylactic measures such as hygiene, management and vaccination of dam cows by an immunization through the injection of either modified-live or inactivated vaccines. This will result in enhancement of antibody titres in the colostrum and milk of vaccinated cows for prevention of neonatal diarrhea caused by coronavirus and rotavirus.",
