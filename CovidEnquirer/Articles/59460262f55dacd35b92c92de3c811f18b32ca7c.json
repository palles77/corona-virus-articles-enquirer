The science of im munology can be said to have been founded by Edward Jenner, who in his well known \"An enquiry into the causes and effects of the variolae vaccinia,\" published in 1798, described the inoculation of variolous matter into the arm of Mary Barge, who had previously had cow pox. He noted: \"It is remarkable that variolous matter, when the system is disposed to reject it, should excite inflammation more speedily than when it produces the Small Pox.\" This is the first description of delayed hypersensitivity, and reactions to vaccination and rashes produced by virus infections were taken as examples of allergic reactions by von Pirquet (1907) in his pioneering study of allergy.",

The important epidemiologic consequences of the use of vaccines against smallpox, yellow fever, and poliovirus are well known, and it seems likely that vaccines against measles and rubella virus will also reduce the incidence of these diseases. In the veterinary field, vaccines against canine dis temper, canine hepatitis, hog cholera, and Newcastle disease and Marek's disease of chickens have been highly effective. Thus, the immunogenicity of animal viruses is of considerable practical impor-tance, and an enormous amount of information has accumulated on antibody formation in a wide range of animal forms inoculated with viruses or virus vaccines.",

With small viruses and viruses of intermediate size, such as adenoviruses or myxoviruses, the relationship between major antigens and the subunits assembled into intact virions is better understood. In this chapter only a few representative examples can be selected for dis cussion, to illustrate certain general principles concerning the immunogenicity of animal viruses and in what way they resemble or differ from responses to other antigens. Brief descriptions of the structures and known antigens of selected viruses will be followed by an account of the humoral and secretory responses elicited by them.",

The problem of memory formation in T and B lymphocytes to thymus-dependent and thymus-independent antigens is currently under vigorous investiga tion and observations on the sequential responses to cross-reacting viral antigens may be pertinent to this problem.

Certain virus infec tions (as with LDV, measles virus, the thymic agent) can dramati cally affect the immune system. In addition to having important clinical consequences, these infections should be considered when interpreting laboratory studies of immune responses. Intercurrent virus infections occur in most animal colonies (especially Sendai virus, minute virus of mice, mouse pneumonitis virus). Mouse hepa titis virus can behave much like an endogenous virus, being undetectable until animals are immunosuppressed, and is frequently found in nude mice. Most passaged tumors carry LDV and other viruses. The effects of some of these virus infections on immune responses will be discussed.",

In a few cases their structures are known and their antigens well characterized and related to the virion structure, e.g., with adenovirus and influenza virus described below. With small viruses such as the enteroviruses, the antigenic composition is relatively simple. In each of the three types of poliovirus, for instance, two an tigens are distinguishable by immunodiffusion and complement fixa tion (CF). Infectious virions containing RNA have a D (dense) an tigen whereas noninfectious particles have a C (coreless) antigen (Hummeler et al., 1962) . The D antigen can be converted to C an tigen by denaturation, so that the C antigen can be regarded as a pro tein that has not attained or retained the D configuration brought about in the complete virion by association with the RNA-containing core. A third antigen, the S antigen, can be obtained by guanidine degradation of the virus and is probably a protein precursor of the virus coat (Scharffand Lewinton, 1963) . Humans infected with poliovirus develop type-specific antibodies against C and D antigens, but only the latter neutralize the virus. In the following sections, the structures and antigens of more complicated viruses -adenovirus, influenza virus, paramyxoviruses, togaviruses, rhabdoviruses, and the herpesviruses -will be described.",

The herpesviruses naturally infecting man tend to produce latent infections and focal cytopathology and are divided into four groups: (1) herpes simplex (HSV), (2) cytomegaloviruses (CMV), (3) varicellazoster (V-Z), and (4) Epstein-Barr (EB) virus. All of these viruses multiply in the cell nucleus where the naked icosohedral nucleocapsids can be seen and acquire their envelopes when budding through the inner lamella of the nuclear membrane or during their egress through the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum. Shortly after infection, host DNA and protein synthesis cease as that of the virus commences. Viral mem brane protein synthesis begins before viral DNA synthesis, and glycosylation of the virus proteins occurs in the membrane and is ac complished by host enzymes. HSV virions contain at least 24 virusspecific proteins and, although earlier studies showed HSV could be agglutinated by antisera made against the uninfected host cell (Watson and Wildy, 1963) , recent studies reveal essentially no host proteins in the virion (see review by Roizman and Heine, 1972) .",

The subunits have varying capacities for HA: hexons and vertex capsomeres show no such capacity whereas all pentons and the fibers of subgroups II and III show partial HA. The latter is due to the univalency of these particles since dimers of pentons and fibers (at least in the case of subgroup III) show complete HA. Heterotypic sera, which can react with group or subgroup antigens on the fibers or vertex capsomeres can enhance HA by aggregating fibers or pentons into polyvalent complexes; this is termed the hemagglutination enhancement (HE) test. Vertex capsomeres can be identified by their ability to absorb HE antibody and thus decrease the HA normally found when a standard preparation of pentons is subsequently added; this is termed the HE antibody consumption (HEC) test.",

The hexon a antigen ap pears to be located on the inner aspect of the capsid since antibody to it lacks HI activity and cannot be seen on ultrastructural examina tion ; moreover, processes that disrupt the virion result in increased C F activity . The presence of a typespecific antigen, e, was suggested by the surprising finding that only anti-hexon sera contain neutralizing antibody (Wilcox and Ginsberg, 1963; Kjellen and Pereira, 1968 ). Antibody to a antigen can be ab sorbed with heterotypic virus or hexons, leaving homotypic (anti-e) antibody which is active in hemagglutination inhibition and neutral ization assays. Using negative staining, this antibody has been shown to attach to the outer surface of hexons in intact virions . Agglutination of virions was prominent and might account for the HI activity of this antibody. Another possible mechanism for this HI activity is steric hindrance of the fiber hemagglutinin by antibody attached to paravertex hexons; this latter mechanism is supported by the finding that the HI activity of different anti-hexon sera was inver sely related to the fiber length of the viruses tested . Serotypes of subgroup III, with the exception of type 4 virus, differ from those of subgroups I and II in that hexons of the latter are considerably more efficient in the induction of neutralizing antibody. Antibodies to subgroup III hexons do attach to the hexons as shown by their ability to sensitize the virus to neutralization by antiglobulin antisera . Absorption tests suggest that hexons possess minor intrasubgroup antigens as well as a and e . Haase and Pereira (1972) have recently demonstrated neutralizing capacity of antibody directed against the hexon e antigen of adenovirus type 2. Crystallized hexons of adenovirus type 5 were coupled to Sepharose and an immunoadsorbent column prepared. Antisera to purified hexons of adenovirus type 2 were then passed over the col umn to adsorb group-specific (anti-\u03b1) antibody. The unbound mate rial possessed neutralizing ability against type 2 virus but not type 5 virus. The subsequently eluted antibody neutralized neither virus. This elegant experiment demonstrates that the type-specific (e) an tigen is the crucial hexon antigen involved in neutralization.",

It is this antigen which is active in HE tests. Some intersubgroup specificity has also been detected . Wigand and Fliedner (1968) observed that some adenovirus strains react differently in HI and neutralization tests, suggesting they might be intermediate strains. The two type-specific antigens, y and e, can be differentiated in HI tests using soluble and virion-associated hemagglutinin, respectively. Such analyses have been reported for two strains, and the HI antigen specificity was related to the fibers and the neutralization specificity to the hexons (Norrby, 1969b) . The latter relationship was not complete, suggesting mutational changes in the hexon after a previous recombination between prototypes. Of practical importance, infection with such mosaic viruses might result in HI tests indicating one prototype but neutralizing antibody and protection would be against another type.",

The nucleo capsid of influenza virus is unique among myxoviruses in that it is fragmented into at least three nucleoprotein pieces which contain segments of the viral RNA. During virus infection a nonglycosylated viral protein, termed the \"membrane protein\" or M protein, aligns it self under the plasma membrane and viral proteins accumulate in the cell membrane above it to the exclusion of host proteins.

There is great genetic stability of the internal antigens while the V antigen, exposed to immunologie selec tion, undergoes frequent minor changes that result in influenza epi demics.

The HA and neuraminidase activities of SV5 , NDV Sendai virus (Tozawa et al., 1973; Scheid and Choppin, 1974) reside in a single glycoprotein of MW 65,000-70,000. The hemolytic and cell-fusion activities of Sendai virus have long been thought to be associated with virus protein and recent studies have confirmed this. Hosaka and Shimiza (1972) showed that isolated virus glycoprotein and virus membrane lipids were inactive separa tely but reconstitution of hemolytic and cell-fusion activities occurred when they were recombined. Scheid and Choppin (1974) recently demonstrated a Sendai virus glycoprotein (MW 53,000), derived from a larger precursor by natural proteolytic activity in vivo or by trypsinization in vitro, which is responsible for the hemolytic and cellfusion activities of the virion and also influences its infectivity. An tibodies to both the hemagglutinin/neuraminidase glycoprotein and to the fusion/hemolytic glycoprotein are probably important in virus neutralization, while antibodies to the nucleocapsid protein or to the internal \" M \" protein are not.",

The finding that HI antibodies can block hemolysis while HLI antibodies have only slight HI activity suggests that the hemolysin represents a separate entity in the virus envelope. Following natural measles infections nucleocapsid C F antibodies predominate and neutralizing antibodies correlate better with HLI than with HI antibodies (Norrby and Gollmar, 1972) . In subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), oligoclonal IgG antibodies to the various virus components were found, especially in the CSF (Vandvik and Norrby, 1973) . In one case, a population of antibodies with HLI and neutral izing but no HI activities was identified. Patients with multiple sclerosis have increased amounts of antibodies to all measles virion components in sera and CSF (Link et al., 1973; .

The carbohydrate portion of this glycoprotein is largely hostspecified (B\u00fcrge and Huang, 1970; B\u00fcrge and Strauss, 1970; Grimes and B\u00fcrge, 1971) , and may reflect the antigenicity of the host cell membrane (Ansel, 1974) . The virus glycoprotein is easily purified and thus provides a tool with which to study alterations in the glycosylation of membrane proteins induced by cell transformation (Moyer and Summers, 1974) . In mixed infections of VSV and the paramyxovirus SV5, phenotypic mixing occurs and the SV5 peplomers may replace those of VSV on VSV virions without altering their overall morphology (McSharry et al., 1971) ; these virions can then be neutralized with antibody to SV5. It is not known if host glycoproteins can replace virus glycoprotein as peplomers. Nonionic detergents can be used sequentially to dissect the VSV or rabies virions until only the infectious ribonucleoprotein remains (Cartwright et al, 1970) .",

Two closely related envelope glycopeptides, gp69/71, have molecu lar weights of 69,000 and 71,000 daltons and contain prominent group-specific (common to many or all MuLV) and type-specific (limited to a particular virus) antigens, and less easily detected inter species determinants. Neutralization studies have led preliminarily to the classification of laboratory MuLV isolates into 5 categories (Table II) . High incidence leukemia mouse strains (AKR, C58) pro duce MuLV serologically identical to Gross virus (with GVEA) (Hartley et al, 1969) . Cell surface antigens (CSA's) of MuLV-infected cells were first defined in tumor transplantation studies. Animals rejecting such tumor grafts possess specifically cytotoxic antibodies which can (in the presence of complement) lyse tumors induced by the same virus. Most antibodies to the CSA's are not neutralizing antibodies since adsorption of virus-neutralizing activity with purified virus leaves the cytotoxic activity of the serum undiminished (Pasternak, 1967; Steeves, 1968) . Also, immunoelectron microscopy studies demon strate VEA's and CSA's in topographically separate regions of the cell surface (Aokiei al., 1970) . Cross-reactive patterns with cytotoxic antibodies define two major subgroups on the basis of CSA's: Gross and Friend -Moloney -Rauscher (FMR). Type-specific CSA deter minants have not been analyzed. The Gross CSA is found on many normal and preleukemic cells of high-leukemic mouse strains (AKR). In contrast, the FMR determinant is not found on normal cells. The FMR antigen appears to be an internal virion protein that differs from p30 (Friedman et al., 1974) . Although they are not the principal CSA's of MuLV-infected cells, both p30 and gp69/71 are found on the surface of infected cells (Ikeda et al., 1974; Yoshiki et al., 1974a) . Expression of the various genes coding for structural proteins of MuLV is regulated by many genes (Lilly and Pincus, 1973; Rowe, 1973) . Multiple copies of some genes coding for virus proteins may be present in each cell and not coordinately linked (Strand et al., 1974) .",

In both cases with adequate antigen dose after a short inductive phase (8-12 hours in the case of PV) IgM antibodies ap peared, followed later by IgG antibodies (Fig. 9 ).

Again, this sec ondary response began the day after inoculation of PV and persisted for only 4 days.

From Ogra et al (1968). tibody was detected in low titers in one-fourth of the infants aged 2 months; no sera contained IgM. IgM and IgG were detected 3 days after the first vaccine dose. The IgM titers rose more rapidly than those of IgG and became maximal during the second week before declining to undetectable levels by 8-10 weeks. IgM declined more slowly in recipients of inactivated virus as they had repeated antigenic stimulation (3 doses). IgG titers in both groups continued to rise for 7-10 weeks before leveling off. Serum IgA titers were not detected until 2 weeks after initial immunization; they rose slowly over a 3-month period. After the booster at 12 months, IgM titers showed a transient rise to previous levels, thus duplicating the find ings in rabbits (Fig. 13 ). Recipients of live virus had neutralizing IgA in their nasal and duodenal secretions after 16-21 days, which per sisted for at least 90 days (duodenal) and 300 days (nasal); recipients of inactivated virus had no secreted IgA antibody to poliovirus.",

A triv ial explanation for not finding IgM against a particular antigen is that the IgM response is transient unless there is continued antigenic stimulation. An exclusively IgM response may occur with small immunogenic stimuli, as discussed above. Thus, wart virus, growing only in the epidermis, does not have ready access to the bloodstream or lymphatics to immunize the host. This has led to the suggestion that susceptibility to recurrent attacks of warts may be related to fail ure of very small doses of antigen to promote an IgG response, the presence of the latter being a good indicator of healing (Pyrhonen and Penttinen, 1972) .",

Nonresponders pro duce only IgM antibody to the specific antigen (Grumet, 1972) unless certain conditions such as an allogeneic stimulus are imposed (Ordal and Grumet, 1972) . Similar situations with viral antigens may also occur, but have not yet been described. However, an increased humoral response to measles virus has been associated with HL-A3 in man (Arnason et al., 1974) . An increased incidence of multiple sclerosis is associated with HL-A3 but there is no such association with optic neuritis, which often evolves clinically into multiple scle rosis. Also, patients with optic neuritis have normal levels of an tibody to measles virus. The association of high titers of antibody to measles virus with multiple sclerosis may thus reflect the prevalence of high titers to the virus in people with the HL-A3 genotype.",

Several groups of investigators have reported that parenteral administration of inactivated viruses increases levels of serum IgG and IgM antibodies, but not levels of IgA antibodies in nasal secretions, whereas natural infection results in the formation of IgA secretory antibodies and better resistance to reinfection Smith et al., 1966; Alford et al., 1967) . This does not nec essarily imply that IgA is responsible for the resistance to rein-fection because the natural infection could have other effects, in cluding local stimulation of T lymphocytes. Claims that local IgA production and protection follow aerosol administration of inac tivated influenza virus (Waldman et al., 1970) have not been con firmed in other laboratories (Shore et al., 1973) and further work on the subject is required.",

Immunization of selected segments of the large intestine in subjects with double-barreled colostomies induced an IgA antibody response against poliovirus in the immunized segment with little or no response elsewhere. How ever, subcutaneous immunization with killed poliovirus has not only eliminated paralytic disease but also the transmission of the virus in the Swedish population, as shown by large scale examinations of feces of persons admitted to hospital for any reason (Perkins, 1974) .",

This has given rise to the con cept of the \"thymus dependence\" of antigens, some antigens being more dependent than others on T lymphocytes for a normal humoral response. Originally, thymus dependence was defined in terms of the amount of serum antibody formed to an antigen in a T lym phocyte-deprived animal. Later, it was found that IgM responses are less dependent on T lymphocytes than those of other immunoglobulin classes and that humoral responses to certain \"thymus independent\" antigens (pneumococcal polysaccharide type III) are regulated by T lymphocytes. \"Thymus dependence\" is thus a rela tive term and depends on animal species and strain as well as mode of antigen presentation. Generally, \"thymus-independent\" antigens are large, slowly metabolized molecules with repeating antigenic de terminants (epitopes). It might be expected that some viruses, many of which possess antigenic polyvalency inherent in their structures, could have some epitopes in the proper repeating spatial rela tionship to be immunogenically thymus-independent.",

Although nude mice may possess abnormalities in addi tion to those presently recognized, they are probably the best an imals for studying thymus dependence. W. H. Burns (unpublished observations) has compared the humoral responses of nude mice and their normal (nu/+, +/+) littermates to infections with a number of viruses. Insignificant or very low (probably IgM) levels of neutral izing antibodies were found in nude mice infected with Coxsackie Bl virus, encephalomyocarditis virus, West Nile virus, VSV, or HSV. No HI antibodies were detected after infections with influenza or Sendai viruses and no C F antibodies were detected after infection with mouse adenovirus. However, infection with Sindbis virus re sulted in high titers (1:1000) of neutralizing antibody, solely of the IgM class; this titer was comparable to that in control littermates and was sustained for 2 weeks. The antigens of Sindbis virus that react with neutralizing antibody are two membrane glycoproteins. Using rabbit antisera, Kennedy (1974) has demonstrated that the antigenic determinants of Semliki Forest virus (an alphavirus similar to Sindbis virus) are in the polypeptide portions rather than the carbo hydrate moieties of the envelope glycoproteins. It will be of interest to determine if the \"thymus-independent\" antigenic determinants of Sindbis virus similarly reside in the protein part of the molecules. Recently, \"natural\" antibody in sera of nude mice has been detected that neutralizes a xenotropic virus isolated from these mice (S. Cross, H. M. Morse, and J. Hartley, personal communication, 1974) . Pre sumably the antibody (predominantly IgM) is directed against viral envelope proteins and/or glycoproteins.",

However, this aim is difficult to achieve be cause of a property of immunologie memory that Francis (1955) has called \"original antigenic sin.\" The response of various age groups of the human population to vaccinations with different strains of influ enza A virus showed that the s\u00e9rologie response of an individual is dominated throughout his life by the type jf antibody produced as a result of his first exposure to an influenza A virus (Francis, 1953 (Francis, , 1955 Davenport and Hennessy, 1956) . This type of response is char acteristic of infections of long-lived animals with any virus of which there are several cross-reacting antigenic types, e.g., flavi viruses-group B arthropod-bone viruses (Hearn and Rainey, 1963), paramyxoviruses (van der Veen and Sonderkamp, 1965) , and enteroviruses (Mietens et al., 1964) . It can be reproduced in laboratory animals either by successive infections with cross-reacting viruses or successive vaccination with inactive vaccines made from such cross-reacting viruses. The phenomenon is also observed when mice are immunized with purified cross-reactive influenza virus hemagglutinins (Virelizer et al., 1974a) . Analogous responses have been re ported in animals immunized with cross-reactive serum albumins, HL-A antigens, and haptens. Westaway et al. (1974) recently re ported that, after sequential infections of rabbits with related togaviruses, the cross-reactive antibodies produced after rechallenge were of the IgG class while IgM antibodies were specific for the most recent immunizing virus. In geographic areas where flavivirus infections are common and s\u00e9rologie diagnosis difficult because of cross-reacting antibodies and the recall phenomenon, determination of IgM specificity can permit diagnosis Edelman and Pariyanonda, 1973) .",

It is para doxical, since it implies a qualitative failure in the specificity of im munologie memory. The cellular basis of the phenomenon is un known, and investigations in detail have begun using two purified influenza hemagglutinins, H 0 and \u0397 1? possessing specific as well as cross-reactive determinants (Virelizier et al., 1974a,b) . As mentioned above, formation of antibody against both these determinants is thymus-dependent. However, the thymus dependence of antibody formation against the cross-reactive determinant could be overcome by repeated inoculations of hemagglutinin in TXBM mice, indicating the presence of memory in these animals. Strong, secondary type responses were observed in primed, thymus-deprived mice after reconstitution with syngeneic virgin thymus cells, showing that spe cific immunologie memory is elicited by both determinants despite the absence of detectable antibody secretion. These observations are interpreted as examples of immunologie recognition and memory mediated by B lymphocytes. They suggest that the helper effect of T lymphocytes is exerted at a late stage in the differentiation of specific populations of B cells into antibody-secreting cells.",

The influence of the host cell was shown by Kjellen and Schlesinger (1959) , who found different levels of residual infectivity of VSV when the same virus-antibody complexes were assayed on chick and human cells. Complexes of virus and mammalian an tibody were more efficiently neutralized when propagated on mam malian cells than chicken cells, whereas chicken antibody was more effective with chicken cells. Philipson (1966) reported analogous findings with poliovirus when assayed on monkey and human cells, and others have made similar observations with various virus-host cell systems (Lafferty, 1963a; Hawkes, 1964) . Thus neutralization is a complex process involving three components: virus, antibody, and host cell. Neutralization in vivo where leukocytes and accessory factors are present may differ in important respects from that ob served in cell cultures.",

Some workers found the interaction to be reversible, e.g., with influenza virus (Burnet et al., 1937; Fazekas de St. Groth, 1962; Lafferty, 1963a) , while others felt it was essentially irrever sible, e.g., with poliovirus (Dulbecco et al., 1956; Mandel, 1961; Philipson, 1966) , adenovirus (Kjellen, 1962) , NDV (Granoff, 1965) , and HSV (Yoshino and Taniguchi, 1965b) . Philipson (1966) , using a two-phase aqueous polymer system that distributes free and an tibody-bound virus in different phases, examined the interaction of poliovirus with various immunoglobulins. After a short lag, IgM an tibody bound virus irreversibly while IgG antibody, following firstorder kinetics, bound virus rapidly and irreversibly. Using a countercurrent distribution procedure with a total dilution factor of 10 18 , only a small fraction of poliovirus-antibody complexes could be dis sociated. Mandel (1961) showed that such complexes were stable for 50 days when resuspended in media without antibody. However, dissociation can occur and infectious poliovirus recovered after ex posure of the complexes to acid or alkali (Mandel, 1961) , treatment with fluorocarbon (Ketler et al., 1961 ), sonication (Keller, 1965 , or exposure to proteolytic enzymes (Keller, 1968) .",

            "text": "Correlations between antigenic structure and neutralization have been made for several viruses, and a few examples will now be con sidered. The neutralization of adenovirus takes place in two steps, with firm initial antibody-virus binding followed by increasing inactivation (Kjellen, 1962) . Although either univalent or bivalent Fab fragments bind to adenovirus and block whole antibody HI activity, neither fragment blocks the neutralizing activity of whole antibody. Since HA is mediated by the fiber y antigen while neutralization requires interaction with the hexon e antigen, this could be ex-plained if Fab fragments bind to y but not to e. Binding of Fab frag ments of antisera prepared against capsid subunits would clarify this. Since antisera against the hexon e antigens neutralize (Wilcox and Ginsberg, 1963; Kjellen and Pereira, 1968; Philipson, 1969) while those against fibers usually do not (Kjellen and Pereira, 1968; Pettersson et al., 1968) , neutralizing antibody may not prevent adsorp tion to host cells but may alter a later step such as uncoating. Intrasubgroup heterotypic antisera neutralize adenovirus type 5 at low pH, and addition of these heterotypic sera to homotypic sera at normal pH enhances neutralization (Kjellen and Pereira, 1968) . It was suggested that low pH or the interaction of homotypic antibody with the outer aspect of hexons might expose inner sites with sub group specificity which then could react with heterotypic antibody and enhance neutralization. According to this view, conformational changes of the hexons are important in adenovirus neutralization, possibly leading to faulty uncoating and degradation in heterophagic vacuoles, as has been described for antibody-complexed NDV and vaccinia (Dales and Kajioka, 1964; Silverstein and Marcus, 1964; Dales, 1969) .",

The G protein of VSV is a glycoprotein forming the spikes that protrude from the virus coat and can be solubilized by detergents and purified. Antisera produced against this protein have good neutralizing activity (Kelley et al., 1972) . The envelope glycoprotein of another rhabdovirus, rabies, can also be ex tracted and purified; it can induce neutralizing antibody and protects animals against later challenge with rabies virus and offers a new form of vaccine. Cohen et al. (1972) have reported purification from HSV-infected cell of a virion glycoprotein that is capable of stimulating in rabbits monoprecipitin antisera that neu tralize HSV. Other workers have isolated envelope glycoproteins from HSV types 1 and 2 which react with type-specific neutralizing antibodies (Powell et al., 1974) . Neutralization of influenza virus results primariily from the interac tion of antibody with hemagglutinin although high concentrations of antibody to neuraminidase can neutralize some virus strains (Kilbourne et al., 1968) . Antibodies to hemagglutinin can prevent virion attachment to cells while antibodies to neuraminidase do not. Both antibodies prevent viropexis and in their presence virions remain at the cell surface (Dourmashkin and Tyrrell, 1974) . Antineuraminidase may also interfere with egress of virus from infected cells.",

After inoculation of rabbits with HSV, early (8-day) sera contained both IgM and IgG antibodies which required complement for neutralization Taniguchi, 1964, 1965a) . Late sera contained both IgM and IgG which could neutralize HSV without complement, but complement increased the IgM neutral izing capacity and raised the neutralization rate constant but not titer of late IgG (Hampar et al., 1968) . Neutralizing antibody against rubella virus, especially IgM and early IgG, also requires comple ment (Rawls et al., 1967; Leerhoy, 1968) . The inefficiency of early and late IgM and early IgG antibody against equine arteritis virus in neutralization was not affected by complement, but an exception to the above findings is the observation that late IgG antibody to this virus is strongly dependent on complement for neutralization (Hyllseth and Pettersson, 1970; Radwan and Burger, 1973) . This finding was noted in sera from five species and is therefore probably charac teristic of the virus rather than the source of antibody.",

Antibody from in fected chickens reacted only with the virus-specified projections, recognizing the virion membrane as self (host-derived).

The neutralizing capacity of all three antisera was enhanced by complement, and electron microscopy showed complement at tached to projections when antibody was bound there and 100 A holes in the membrane after complement reacted with antibody at that site.

Interest has recently turned toward an alternate pathway in which C3 is activated without interaction of the preceding three components (Osier and Sandberg, 1973) . Certain immunoglobulins or immunoglobulin fragments, after binding antigen, can activate complement by the alternate pathway. Guinea pig \u03b32 antibodies efficiently activate complement by the classic pathway in which interaction of the Fc portion of the an tibody molecule with C l is essential. However, the F(ab')2 fragments of \u03b32 immunoglobulins activate complement via the alternate path way. A. L. Sandberg (personal communication) has used F(ab')2 frag ments of anti-HSV \u03b32 to determine whether complement-dependent enhancement of HSV neutralization can occur by the alternate path way. She found that the F(ab')2 fragments bound to the virus but were not as efficient in enhancing neutralization as were the parent undigested antibodies. Furthermore, there was only minimal lysis of HSV-infected rabbit kidney cells by the alternate pathway after bind ing of the F(ab')2 fragments to the cell membrane. More viruses must be examined before conclusions can be drawn concerning the impor tance of the alternate pathway in virus neutralization, but there may be a specific requirement for the first complement components in the enhancement of neutralization of some viruses.",

Thus, it was found that for LDV sensitization occurs sooner than neutralization and for both LDV and HSV that as sensitization increases the neutralization constant diminishes.

Rabbit or human anti-HSV IgG antibody was reacted with HSV and then with human RF. No reduction in the persistent fraction of these HSV-IgG-RF complexes occurred unless the preparations were al lowed to react further with complement or anti-human IgM an tiglobulin. Apparently the attachment of RF provides new sites for complement reaction and attachment on the complex. If Fab frag ments of anti-HSV were used to sensitize the virus, no enhancement of neutralization was observed after reaction with complement or anti-IgM, presumably because of the inability of RF to attach to the Fab fragment. Hayashi et al. (1973) have shown that RF can bind to infected cells after they have been exposed to antiviral antibody. Whether RF plays a protective role in vivo by enhancing neutral ization of infectious virus-antibody complexes is unknown. Alterna tively, by enhancing the complement-fixing capacity of complexes it may lead to increased pathology in immune complex diseases. Mims (1964) has summarized evidence that viruses introduced into the lungs or other sites are taken up by macrophages in the local tissues and in lymph nodes, where they are demonstrable by immunofluorescence. Likewise, viruses entering the blood from the primary site of multiplication or introduced into the bloodstream (e.g., by arthropod vectors) are removed by Kupffer cells and other macrophages lining blood sinuses. Usually, the viruses cannot multi ply sufficiently well in the macrophages of adult hosts to spread to other cells which are highly susceptible, such as hepatic paren chymal cells. However, if the macrophage barrier is bypassed by ex posing liver parenchymal cells directly to infection (e.g., by injecting virus into the bile duct) a lethal infection with widespread mul tiplication of virus in parenchymal cells results. Similarly, the brain is a highly susceptible organ, and intracerebral injection of many viruses in adult animals will result in lethal infections.",

Such a relationship exists, and is most strikingly demonstrated where major genetic factors determine the susceptibility to infection. Bang and Warwick (1960) found that adult mice of the Princeton (PRI) strain are susceptible to lethal infection with the Nelson strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-2), whereas the C3H strain of mice is resistant. Mating experiments show that the susceptibility to infection segre gates as a single Mendelian dominant genetic factor. It was found, moreover, that cultures of hepatic or peritoneal macrophages taken from susceptible hosts support multiplication of MHV with cytopathic effects, whereas macrophages from resistant mice do not. This interesting observation showed that inherited resistance is a property of individual macrophages, manifested in vitro in the ab sence of an acquired immune response. Observations on other MHV strains also emphasize the relationship between virulence and the capacity of viruses to multiply in macrophages. Thus, the avirulent strain MHV-1 does not multiply in macrophages, whereas the viru lent strain MHV-3, which after intraperitoneal injection into adult mice of most strains produces a lethal hepatitis, multiplies readily in mouse peritoneal macrophages with giant cell formation (Fig. 15 ) (Allison and Mallucci, 1965) . Only the A strain of mice resists infec tion with MHV-3 as adults, and cultures of peritoneal macrophages from this strain again show no cytopathic effects after exposure to MHV-3 (J. L. Virelizier and A. C. Allison, unpublished observations, 1974) .",

Another system that has been analyzed in detail is the inherited resistance against arthropod-borne viruses of the B group. Sabin (1954) found that the striking difference in susceptibility of HSVS and PRI mice to yellow fever virus is determined by a single pair of genes, with resis tance dominant. The PRI mice also show marked resistance to other flaviviruses. This resistance is not a general one to all types of virus; in fact, the PRI mice which are resistant to flaviviruses are highly susceptible to MHV-2, and the two resistance factors segregate in- dependently among the offspring of hybrids (Kantoch et al, 1963) . It was shown by Goodman and Koprowski (1962) that macrophages from susceptible mice support multiplication of flaviviruses very ef ficiently, whereas macrophages from resistant mice do not. Similar observations have subsequently been made in Koprowski's labora tory on mice congenic for the resistance gene. B. Rager-Zisman and A. C. Allison (unpublished observations, 1974) have found that encephalomyocarditis virus, which is virulent in adult mice, can repli cate in macrophages. Hence, there is little doubt that the capacity of a virus to multiply in macrophages is an important aspect of viru lence, but not of course the only one.",

Experiments with herpes simplex virus in mice can be used to illustrate the point, which probably applies also to many viruses as well as to other intracellular infections. Intraperitoneal inoculation of newborn mice with herpes simplex virus is followed by rapid spread of virus to the viscera, encephalitis, and death, whereas similar injections into weanling or adult mice result in no viral spread to the liver or brain and no morbidity or mortality. The resistance to intraperitoneal infection develops rapidly during the first few weeks of life. Transfers of peritoneal macrophages from adult CBA to syngeneic suckling mice were able to confer a large measure of protection against intraperitoneal infection with herpesvirus; similar transfers of peritoneal lymphocytes from adult animals were without any protective effect (Hirsch et al., 1970) . Further studies showed that the adult macrophages, particularly when stimu lated by prior injections of proteose-peptone, were much more ef ficient at taking up and preventing the spread of virus than macro phages from suckling animals, whether stimulated or not. This was reflected in the diminished capacity of infected adult macrophages to establish infectious centers when cultured together with susceptible cells, and similar findings were reported by Johnson (1964) .",

The higher gangliosides are formed by the sequen tial addition of various hexose moieties and sialic acid and is mediated by transferase enzymes. An examination of one transferase involved has revealed it to be markedly reduced in most SV40 and polyoma virus transformed cells (Brady et al., 1973) .

The Fc receptor appeared on the surfaces of all infected cells tested, including fibroblasts and epithe lial cells from mice, hamsters, monkeys, and humans. Receptors ap peared on HeLa cells within 4 hours after infection and at 11 hours after infection an estimated 5 X 10 4 molecules of IgG per cell bound to the cell membrane during 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. Experiments with actinomycin D and puromycin suggested an early need for RNA syn thesis after infection and for continuing synthesis of receptors. No evidence was obtained to suggest unmasking of Fc receptors already present in a cryptic form. Antisera against uninfected host cells or HSV blocked the subsequent attachment of immunoglobulin to the infected cells. This could be due to steric hindrance or the Fc receptor might contain host and viral antigenic determinants; a viral protein glycosylated by host enzymes and functioning as an Fc re ceptor could have this characteristic. It is not known whether the virus codes for a protein which is the receptor itself or which can be glycosylated by cellular enzymes and resemble the Fc receptor known to be present on macrophages, neutrophils, B lymphocytes, and possibly some T lymphocytes. Alternatively, infection could result in derepression of the appropriate host gene(s) controlling syn thesis of the receptor. This latter possibility is intriguing in view of recent suggestions that the Fc receptor is a product of the Ir gene complex. Since these genes control some immune responses, infec tion of lymphocytes by viruses that activate genes in this complex might affect immune responses or perhaps permit autoimmune responses.",

Hecht and Summers (1972) found a 70% reduction in the capacity of VSV-infected mouse cells to adsorb cytolytic antibodies directed against H-2 antigen. This was not due to inhibition of pro tein synthesis as treatment of cells with cycloheximide for a similar time period did not reduce the H-2 concentration, nor did infection with encephalomyocarditis virus which inhibits host protein synthe sis. Whether other cell antigens, particularly tumor antigens, will behave similarly during infection merits examination. At least one tumor antigen is known to cocap and thus to be linked with H-2 an tigen and conceivably may be altered by those factors influencing H-2 density (Gooding and Edidin, 1974) . Recently, Hecht and Summers (1974) reported that NDV-infected L (mouse) cells lose 50% of their H-2 antigen.",

Leukemias induced by leukemogenic viruses in the TL-positive mouse strains result in the appearance of the TL antigen on leukemic cells. If such leukemic cells are trans planted to TL-negative animals previously immunized with TL an tigen and producing antibody to it, the antigen is quickly lost from the cell surface but can reappear if the leukemic cells are trans planted back to a TL-positive host (lacking antibody to TL). Phenotypic expression of TL was found to markedly reduce the demonstra ble quantity of H-2 antigens, especially those specified by the D region. With loss of TL by antigen modulation, an increase in the H-2 antigens was observed ).

These investigators re ported that lymphocytes from LCM-infected mice are capable of mediating a cytotoxic reaction only with infected target cells which share similarity at either the K or D region of the H-2 locus. The reactive lymphocytes were sensitive to anti-0 and complement and thus are T lymphocytes. (It should be mentioned that found no such H-2 requirement in a similar system.) R. V. Blanden (personal communication) has obtained similar results using ectromelia virus. One explanation for this phenomenon is that the in teraction of cytotoxic T lymphocytes with somatic cells requires an intimate contact that is strongly dependent on some degree of histocompatibility, as is suggested for the interaction of helper T lym phocytes and B lymphocytes (Katz et al., 1973a,b) . An alternative explanation is that the immune lymphocytes recognize a composite antigen consisting of virus protein and H-2 material, or that the virus infection results in altered H-2 antigens that are no longer recog nized by the lymphocytes as \"self.\"",

Currently, much interest is centered on under standing lymphoid cells and cell-mediated immunity. Various methods have been used to illustrate the presence of cell-mediated immunity against virus-specific antigens. Each has its own advan tages and limitations. Although delayed hypersensitivity to many viruses or viral antigens has been demonstrated, it must be in terpreted with caution. For example, some reactions are elicited by antigens from the heterologous cells in which viruses are grown. An tibody-mediated reactions to replicating antigens may be maximal between 24 and 72 hours after intradermal inoculation; even the histology may be ambiguous. Of the in vitro tests for cell-mediated immunity, M IF production correlates better with delayed hypersen sitivity than does blast transformation (David and Schlossman, 1968; Rocklin et al., 1970) . With peptides of tobacco mosaic virus and glucagon, delayed skin reactions correlated with the production of MIF by lymphoid cells in vitro, but not always with the stimulation of DNA synthesis on the exposure of host lymphocytes to the an tigens (Spider et al, 1970; Senyk et al, 1971) . It seems that MIF production is a particularly good in vitro correlate of delayed hyper sensitivity in guinea pigs, but attempts to obtain MIF production with cells from other species, including man, have not been easily reproducible in all laboratories.",

Even so, from these investigations some useful generalizations are beginning to emerge. Sensitization of T lymphocytes in virus infections is an early event, being demonstrable 3 to 7 days after infection, reaching a peak of cy totoxic reactivity at 7 to 14 days and then falling to near background levels. A population of memory cells, not themselves cytotoxic but able to generate cytotoxic eifector cells, then persists for weeks or months.

However, congenital infections by the murine leu kemia viruses formerly were thought to result in tolerance to the virus antigens and only recently has circulating antibody to these viruses been demonstrated. The concept of \"split tolerance\" in which humoral responses are not accompanied by cell-mediated responses was then suggested. Recently, Proffitt et al. (1973) pre sented evidence for cell-mediated immunity in carrier C3H mice for Moloney leukemia virus. Lymphocytes from such animals mediated cytotoxic reactions against syngeneic cells infected with Moloney leukemia virus but not against uninfected cells. Wahren and Metcalf (1970) had reported similar results using C3H carrier mice (for Mo loney MuLV) and embryo cell cultures from these mice as target cells; lymphocytes from normal C3H mice were not cytotoxic for these target cells. The latter investigators also reported cytotoxic reactions of lymphocytes from preleukemic AKR mice for cell monolayers of AKR embryos or of AKR thymic epithelial cells. Many tissues of AKR mice are known to possess Gross MuLV antigens and these target cells probably possessed viral antigens since the cyto toxic reaction was prevented by pretreatment of the target cells with antisera to Gross cell surface antigens. At variance with the above studies, Chieco-Bianchi et al. (1974) have reported no cytotoxic reac tions between spleen lymphocytes from adult C57BL/6 mice in fected neonatally with Moloney MuLV and syngeneic Moloney MuLV-infected target cells. Differences in the production of the virus carrier state and in the cytotoxic assays employed may account for this discrepancy. In this last study a chromium-release assay was used while in the previous studies a microcytotoxicity assay (similar to colony inhibition assays) was used and important differences in these assays are known (Biesecker et al., 1973; Bloom et al., 1973) .",

The response was not altered by the presence of complexes of virus and anti-rubella IgG but virus complexes with anti-rubella IgM were markedly inhibitory. Normal IgM mixed with rubella virus or anti-rubella IgM mixed with poliovirus or influenza virus had no effect. In a study with HSV (Rosenberg et al., 1972a) hyperimmune sera mixed with HSV did not inhibit blastogenesis; anti-HSV antibodies in this sera probably were of the IgG class.

Late immune cells lacked these properties in re acutely infected mice, but had strong antiviral activity when trans planted to chronically infected mice -a situation in which early im mune cells had little effect. Also, the cytotoxic and antiviral activities of the early immune cells were relatively resistant to X-irradiation, while the antiviral activity (on transfer to chronically infected mice) of late immune cells was radiation sensitive.

The salivary gland virus of guinea pigs could be recovered any time after infection and in the presence of antibody (Cole and Kuttner, 1926) .

Measles virus has been isolated from brain and lymph nodes of patients with subacute sclerosing panen-cephalitis (Horta- Barbosa et al., 1969; Payne et al., 1969) and from the lymph nodes and spleens of normal subjects some years after in fection (Enders-Ruckle, 1965) . Adenoviruses are commonly isolated from human tonsillar and adenoidal tissues (Israel, 1962; Strohl and Schlesinger, 1965) , and in rabbits they persist for long periods in splenic and lymph node cells (Pereira and Kelly, 1957; Reddick and Lefkowitz, 1969; Allison, 1970; Faucon et al., 1974) .

Human CMV is often isolated from leukocytes of normal persons (Diosi et al., 1969; Perham et al., 1971; Lang, 1972) . EB virus may be induced in lym phocytes years after recovery from infectious mononucleosis (Diehl et al., 1968) . Varicella-zoster virus remains dormant for years after chicken pox and reappears clinically as zoster. Initial HSV infection presents as a childhood stomatitis with subsequent positive titers for C F and neutralizing antibody (Yoshino et al., 1962) . HSV can later be isolated from asymptomatic subjects as well as those with herpetic lesions (Buddingh et al., 1953; Kaufman et al., 1967) . Over 40 years ago Goodpasture (1929) suggested that the virus remains in a dormant state between recurrences in the sensory ganglia. Direct proof for this concept was lacking until recently, when Stevens and Cook (1971b) isolated HSV from the spinal ganglia of mice weeks after recovery from posterior paralysis following virus inoculation of hind footpads, and from rabbit trigeminal ganglia months after recov ery from corneal infection Stevens et al., 1972) . Virus was recovered only from the ganglia and not from prox imal or distal nerve structures except during acute infection. Virus could not be detected in the ganglia by electron microscopy or by in fectious virus assay, and only after the ganglia were explanted and cultured for a period of time in vitro could virus be recovered. Recov ery of HSV from in vitro cultures of human trigeminal ganglia ob tained at autopsy from patients without active herpes infection has now been reported (Bastian et al., 1972; Baringer and Swoveland, 1973) . J. R. Baringer (1974) has recently isolated type 2 (genital) herpes from the sacral ganglia of humans. It appears that the virus is activated by the explantation and culture, probably due to metabolic changes in the neurons subsequent to injury rather than to the re-moval of the tissue to an environment free of immune responses. This interpretation is consistent with the finding that HSV can be ac tivated in dorsal ganglia after sciatic nerve injury (Walz et al., 1974) and with the well-known observation that proximal rhizotomy of the human trigeminal ganglion results in activation of HSV (Cushing, 1905; Carton and Kilbourne, 1952) .",

Infection of adult mice with LCM leads to an immunopathological disease and antibody formation. The lack of antibody after congenital LCM virus infection was one of the observa tions that led Burnet and Fenner (1949) to postulate the existence of immunologie tolerance. More recently, Oldstone and Dixon (1967) and Benson and Hotchin (1969) have demonstrated in mice congenitally infected with LCM virus the presence of antiviral antibody and the accumulation in the kidneys of immune complexes containing viral antigen and antibody (Oldstone and Dixon, 1971) . Hence, the congenitally infected mice are able to make some antibody against viral antigens. Volkert and Hannover-Larsen (1965) found that, if spleen cells from LCM-immune mice (infected as adults) are trans ferred to syngeneic congenitally infected carrier animals, very high levels of antibody are formed, but no immunopathological disease results.",

In the absence of specific helper cells, only a small amount of antibody is produced, and this combines with antigen liberated into the circulation to form immune complexes which accumulate in the kidney, leading eventu ally to immunopathological glomerulonephritis. However, when virus-specific T cells are supplied by adoptive immunization, a helper effect greatly increases antibody formation in the recipients.

Thus, even in the presence of B cells from immune donors, little antibody is formed unless sensitized T cells are also present. The interpretation of these experiments is complicated by the fact that in the recipients the level of virus is reduced, so that the antigenic load is less and the chances of finding free antibody are increased. However, the levels of antibody in recipients are so high that this is unlikely to be the whole explanation.",

Previously preparation in mice of antisera to Gross virus had resulted in the production of antibodies against GCSAs but not of neutralizing antibodies directed against virion envelope antigens (GVEA's). This led to the hypothesis that, due to occult infections early in life, mice might be tolerant to VEA's. However, old NZB mice were found to make \"natural an tibody\" to GVEA's . Recently, Yoshiki et al. (1974b) reported that NZB, NZW, and their Fj hybrid mice contain remarkably high concentrations of the viral envelope glycoprotein gp69/71, and that this protein is deposited as immune complexes in the glomeruli of these mice in much greater concentration than the major structural protein of the virion, p30.",

Hirsch et al (1969) and Branca et al (1972) found that mice congenitally infected with Moloney leukemogenic and sarcoma viruses have complexes of viral antigen and antibody in their glomeruli. Recently, endogenous murine oncornaviruses, re leased spontaneously from cells of BALB/c and NZB mice and unable to grow in mouse cells but able to grow in cells of other species and thus called xenotropic viruses, have been isolated and designated BALB:virus-2 and NZB-MuLV, respectively. Neutral izing antibodies to these two viruses are cross-reactive and wide spread, being present in high titers in 2-month-old mice of all strains tested except the NIH strain (Aaronson and Stephenson, 1974) . These investigators suggest that previous studies detecting \"natural\" antibody to the Gross viral antigens may have been primarily directed against the BALB:virus-2 class of endogenous viruses but cross-reactive at a lower level with Gross-type virus. Some crossreactivity between BALB:virus-2 and Gross leukemogenic virus does exist since antisera against the latter virus neutralized the former, but normal BALB/c sera which neutralized BALB:virus-2 did not neu tralize viruses of the Gross or FMR subgroups and the antigenic rela tionships of these viruses awaits clarification. Another xenotropic virus has been isolated from athymic nude mice and neutralizing an tibody to this virus, mainly IgM, has been detected in high titers in the nude mice from which the virus was isolated; this sera also neu tralized BALB:virus-2 and NZB-MuLV (S.

Whether they can also mount cell-mediated immune responses to these viral antigens is less clear. Recently, Proffitt et al. (1973) have found that lymphocytes from C3H carrier mice (carrying Moloney leukemogenic virus) are cytotoxic to cells bearing virusspecific antigens. If these reactions are mediated by T lymphocytes, a lack of tolerance is suggested. Similar observations for Gross leuke mogenic virus (MuLV-G) have been published by Wahren and Metcalf (1970) . Absence of tolerance in mice neonatally infected with polyoma virus has been found by Allison (1970) : lymphocytes from such animals were able to protect immunosuppressed recipients from polyoma tumor formation. Many investigators have described T lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity of cell cultures in which LCM virus is replicating (vide supra). It is observed in mice infected with LCM virus as adults but not in carrier mice infected as newborns. This supports the view that the carrier mice do not have T lympho cytes reactive against virus-specific antigens, not necessarily the same antigens that enter the circulating blood. These studies suggest that it is more difficult to induce tolerance to virus-specific antigens than was formerly supposed, although some examples of selective tolerance (e.g., specifically induced unresponsiveness of T lympho cytes after congenital LCM infection) appear to exist. It is not yet known whether this is due to deletion or inactivation of T lympho cytes or temporary inhibition of their responses by antigen or im mune complexes.",

In an analogous way the presence of the highly immunogenic chicken isoantigen B along with the weaker isoantigen A on the same cells will elicit a stronger than normal immune response to the latter (Schierman and McBride, 1967) . Conceivably, highly immunogenic viral coat proteins may increase the response to less immunogenic components. Tumor transplantation antigens are often weakly immunogenic, and the immunogenicity of various tumors has been improved by association of the tumor antigens with stronger immunogens by forming somatic hybrids with more antigenic cells (Watkins and Chen, 1969) , or by virus infection (reviewed by Lin denmann, 1974). Thus, Lindenmann and Klein (1967) prepared viral oncolysates by infecting Ehrlich ascites tumor cells with influenza virus and showed that immunization of mice with such preparations would protect them against 100 lethal doses of the uninfected tumor cells eleven days later. Even if inactivated, partially purified virus from oncolysates was protective, indicating direct viral lysis of the tumor in vivo was not involved. Antisera to the virus (prepared against influenza virus grown in eggs) eliminated the protective ef fect and simple mixtures of virus and tumor cells were not effective, indicating that close coupling of viral and tumor antigens was required. These findings have been confirmed (H\u00e4kkinen and Halonen, 1971 ). Since the virions were not rigorously purified after oncolysis, it cannot be decided from these experiments whether the immunogen was fragments of cell membrane containing virus an tigens or virions containing host material. The latter interpretation is favored in similar experiments with VSV and fowl-plague virus in which the viral oncolysates were immunogenic only when prepared following the appearance of progeny virus, long after the incorpo ration of virus proteins into cell membranes (Lindenmann, 1970) .",

            "text": "In other studies virus was not purified from tumor lysates and tumor cell membranes containing virus antigens may be the immunogen. Thus, Eaton et al. (1973) reported increased immunogenicity of a Gross virus lymphoma when syngeneic mice were immunized with lysates of tumor cells infected with NDV or Sendai virus, and membrane fractions were more effective than concentrated virus. Kobayashi et al. (1970) have shown that infection of rat tumors with Friend virus increases their immunogenicity and similar find ings in the hamster for SV40-transformed human cells have been reported using oncolysates prepared by infection with NDV (Axler and Girardi, 1970). A syngeneic system using SV40-transformed 3T3 cells transplanted to BALB/c mice and oncolysates produced by influenza virus or VSV yielded similar results (Boone et al., 1971 (Boone et al., , 1974 Boone and Blackman, 1972) . Boone et al. (1974) found that tumor immunity cannot be induced by viral oncolysates if mice are first made tolerant to the virus by cyclophosphamide treatment. This was considered evidence for a carrier-hapten relationship between the virus and tumor antigens, but interpretation is difficult because of the complexities of cyclophosphamide treatment (Aisenberg, 1973; Lagrange et al., 1974) . The use of viral oncolysates from human tumors to improve the im munizing efficiency of patients to their own tumors following surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy is potentially important, es pecially if inactivation of the virus does not diminish tumor im munogenicity. Infection of cancer patients with various viruses has sometimes been thought to have beneficial effects (Webb and . However, critical evaluation of this approach is required. The cooperative effect in virus infections may also prove useful in the preparation of antisera to cellular isoantigens in allogeneic systems (Lindenmann and Klein, 1964) and of potent antilymphocyte sera in xenogeneic systems (Bandlow et al., 1972 (Bandlow et al., , 1973 .",

Infection by LDV presents a special example of impaired clearance. Following infection, phagocytic activity of the RES as reflected by carbon particle clearance is only transiently impaired (Mahy, 1964) while there is permanent impairment of the clearance of certain enzymes (LDH, isocitrate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, aspartate transaminase) but not others (alkaline phosphatase, alanine transaminase). Little consideration has been given to the clearance of endogenous enzymes (those enzymes that are useful intracellularly but which, after becoming extracellular due to cell leakage or cell death, have no known extracellular functions). It has long been held that the RES plays a role in clearing proteins gener ally (Hyman and Paldino, 1960) and, based on their studies showing decreased clearance of endogenous enzymes after RES blockade, Wakim and Fleisher (1963) suggested a similar role for the RES in clearing endogenous proteins. Infection by LDV, which replicates almost exclusively in macrophages in vitro, appears specifically to eliminate or impair the function of a subpopulation of macrophages or cells of the RES responsible for clearance of certain endogenous enzymes. The specificity of the clearance cells for certain enzymes is presumably on a nonimmunological basis since there is no evidence to suggest that the extracellular enzymes are structurally (an-tigenically) altered and therefore the animal should be tolerant to them. One can postulate that specific membrane receptors for the en zymes cleared exist on a particular population of cells infected by LDV. Because of its selective tropism, LDV may prove to be a useful tool to define and explore the functions of subpopulations of macro phages, especially in regard to their clearance functions.",

Rowe and Capps (1961) described a virus, recently characterized as a herpesvirus (Parker et al., 1973) which causes transient massive destruction of thymus cortex and medulla in newborn mice. Studies by S. Cross and H. M. Morse (personal communication) demonstrate that this virus (called the thymic agent) replicates in thymocytes of newborn mice and later can be found only in the salivary glands. Several weeks after infection, lymphocytes from thymus, lymph node, and spleen have minimal reactivity in the graft-versus-host reaction; lymph node cells show normal reactivity at 8 weeks postinfection. Mitogenic responses to T lymphocyte mitogens but not to lipopolysaccharide are also depressed for weeks (G. H. Cohen, personal com munication). A human herpesvirus, varicella-zoster, can also grow in the thymus. Cheathem et al. (1956) observed evidence of virus growth in thymuses of children dying of fatal varicella infections. Many intranuclear inclusion bodies were seen in thymus reticular cells and Hassall's corpuscles were necrotic.",

White and Boyd (1973) studied autopsy material from eight children less than 3 years of age who died during or shortly after measles infec tion. Beginning 4 days after the onset of illness, there was severe aggregation and syncytial formation of thymocytes in the thymus cortex and subsequent total loss of cortex in some cases. No recovery of cortex was discernible until 3 or 4 months after infection. Exami nation of other lymphoid tissues, including spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes, did not reveal similar changes. In tissue cultures a prominent cytopathic effect of measles infection is syncytial forma tion (Enders and Peebles, 1954) . White and Boyd felt the syncytial cell formation in the thymus differed from the Warthin-Finkeldey \"giant cells\" (Warthin, 1931) found in peripheral lymphoid tissue during the prodromal stage of measles. It is difficult to relate these thymus observations to the previously noted suppression of delayed hypersensitivity reactions by measles infection since, in mice at least, the effects of thymectomy on cell-mediated immunity are not seen for weeks. More likely, immunosuppression occurs because of (McCullough et al., 1973) , as did rinderpest virus infections of rabbits (Yamanouchi et al., 1974a) .",

Although LDV can grow in macro phage cultures, it does not replicate in lymphocyte cultures and cannot be demonstrated by electron microscopy within the lympho- cytes of infected spleens (Snodgrass \u03b2\u03af \u03b1\u0396., 1972). It is postulated that its toxic effect on lymphocytes is mediated by viral growth in den dritic macrophages near the lymphocytes with disruption of tropic influences or the release of toxic materials. Alterations in T lympho cyte migrations could also result. Peripheral lymphoid necrosis is a common feature of infections by mouse hepatitis virus (Hirano and Ruebner, 1965; Biggart and Ruebner, 1970) as well as the medipest viruses already mentioned. The bursal infectious agent, an avian virus that causes lymphoid necrosis in young chickens resulting in a syndrome termed Gumboro disease, replicates in thymus, lymph nodes, spleen, and the bursa of Fabricius (Cheville, 1967) . A severe inflammatory reaction occurs in the bursa, which is the only lym phoid organ that does not repopulate with lymphocytes after infec-tion. During infection, viral antigen and virus particles can be de tected in macrophages in the bursa but not in the affected lympho cytes. Damage to the lymphocytes may therefore be indirect and pos sibly of an autoimmune nature.",

Persistent infections may result in more subtle disturbances of cell function. It has been hypothesized that infected lymphocytes may have alterations in protein synthesis, responses to hormones, interactions with other lymphoid cells, mac rophages, or antigens, and in migration characteristics. Migration of lymphocytes in vivo is partly determined by cell membrane charac teristics such as sialic acid content (Woodruff and Gesner, 1969; Berney and Gesner, 1970) . The surfaces of infected cells are often al tered (vide supra) and the appearance on cell membranes of viral neuraminidase after infection with SV5 can result in release of cell membrane sialic acid Klenk et al., 1970) . Woodruff and Woodruff (1974) have reported that inoculation of NDV into rats causes a transient diversion of homing thoracic duct lymphocytes from lymph nodes and spleen to liver with resulting depletion of lymphocytes in thymus-dependent areas of nodes and spleen. This appeared to be due to viral neuraminidase acting on the lymphocyte surface. The importance of this phenomenon in natural infections is not clear.",

The ability of infected cells to participate in graft-versus-host reactions (Pur chase et al., 1968; Howard et al., 1969; Bennett and Steeves, 1970) , reject skin grafts (Howard et al., 1969) , and be stimulated by PHA or an in vitro allogeneic exposure (Hagry et al., 1970) has been used to determine the immunocompetence of infected T lymphocytes, and transfer-reconstitution experiments with infected bone marrow cells have been used to ascertain B lymphocyte competence (Bennett and Shearer et al., 1973) . Interpretation of these experiments is difficult since transfers of infected cells often result in transfer of infectious virus as well. Experiments with Friend virus are particularly complicated by contamination with Rowson-Parr virus, lymphatic leukemia virus, and LDV (Bennett and . In a recent transfer-reconstitution experiment, Shearer et al. (1973) demonstrated that the antibody response to a D-amino acid polypeptide (a thymus-independent antigen) was significantly re duced after infection of bone marrow cells with the SJL/J leukemogenic virus, regardless of whether thymocytes were infected or not. Hence, infection with this virus may result in a decrease in the response of B lymphocytes, but the experiments provide no informa tion on possible effects on T lymphocytes. Peled and Haran-Ghera (1974) found that infection of mice with the radiation leukemia (Gross) virus resulted in depressed responses of spleen cells to sheep erythrocytes but normal responses to the thymus-independent antigens polyvinylpyrrolidine and pneumococcal polysaccharide SIII. They concluded that the immunosuppressive effect of this virus is on T lymphocytes.",

Mice were primed with ovalbumin-DNP (OA-DNP), a carrier-hapten conjugate, or with chicken \u03b3-globulin (CGG), a secondary carrier, and their spleen cells used in combination to adoptively immunize irradiated recipient mice; secondary anti-hapten responses were measured after chal lenge with the appropriate conjugate. The effect of measles virus in fection was ascertained by infecting either the CGG primed donor or the OA-DNP primed donors, and it was found that infection of CGG primed donors resulted in diminished anti-hapten responses while infection of OA-DNP donors had no effect on the response.

            "text": "Finally, virus infections can abrogate tolerance. Inoculation of BALB/c mice with subimmunogenic amounts of pneumococcal polysaccharide (SIII), a relatively thymus-independent antigen, results in unresponsiveness to subsequent immunogenic amounts of antigen; this state lasts for months and is specific for SIII (Baker et al., 1974) . Tolerance in this system appears to be mediated by suppressor T cells since it is broken by the administration of ALS along with SIII; also, tolerance to SIII cannot be induced in athymic nude mice. P. J. Baker and W. H. Burns (unpublished observations) have found that infection with LDV will abrogate tolerance, although to a lesser ex tent than ALS administration. This is not due to an adjuvant effect since well-known adjuvants like complete Freund's adjuvant, poly I-C, and lipopolysaccharide do not abrogate tolerance in this system. Figure 16 shows that 48 hours after infection the thymus-dependent areas of the spleen (and lymph nodes) are depleted of lymphocytes and have the appearance of lymphoid tissue following administration of ALS. Whether LDV alters T cell migration or is directly or indi rectly toxic to T cells is not clear. It is doubtful that the virus selec tively impairs the functions of suppressor T cells, but rather impairs the functions of all or most T cells. In this system with SIII as an tigen, the predominant influence of T cells on specific B cells is a suppressive one and destruction or impairment of T cell functions results in a diminution of their suppressive effect. Thus, as demon strated here, virus infections can unbalance the normal regulatory mechanisms of the immune system. The frequency of virus infec tions in all animals, the presence of \"endogenous viruses\" in most or all cells, and the persistent and latent infections by \"exogenous viruses\" in many cells require an awareness by immunologists of the influences of these viruses on immune responses.",
