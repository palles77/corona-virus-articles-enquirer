Food safety regulatory authorities also need summary of outbreak data, as these data indicate where the existing food supply system should be improved. To obtain information on epidemiology of FBDOs in China, FBDOs reported to the China National Foodborne Diseases Surveillance Network by 12 surveillance provinces that include 43% of the Chinese population was summarized. Between 2003 and 2008, 2795 FBDOs were reported, resulting in 62559 illnesses, 31261 hospitalizations, and 330 deaths. Outbreak size ranged from 2 to 464 cases, with a median of 14 cases. The outbreak rate had decreased from 1.37 per 1 million population in 2003 to 0.46 per 1 million population in 2008. Of the 2176 outbreaks with a single known etiology, bacteria (1051 outbreaks, 48%), man-made chemical hazards (550 outbreaks, 25%), and animal and plant toxins (536 outbreaks, 25%) were the main courses. Only one outbreak was caused by virus. Of the 1930 outbreaks with a single commodity, plant-based foods were the most common reported (930 outbreaks, 48%), followed by animal-based foods (590 outbreaks, 31%). Outbreaks most frequently occurred in private residences (32%), workplace cafeterias (21%), and restaurants (17%). The most common factor reported in the 2190 outbreaks with known contributing factors were improper cooking (510 outbreaks, 23%), contaminated ingredient (503 outbreaks, 23%), cross contamination (475 outbreaks, 22%) and improper storage (295 outbreaks, 13%). It is considered that FBDOs continue to be an important public health problem in China.",

            "text": "Foodborne disease is a significant public health concern in both developed and developing countries. Although the disease is usually mild and self-limiting, due to the high number of individuals affected each year, foodborne disease exerts a substantial socioeconomic burden on the population and healthcare system. In the USA, foodborne disease causes about 47.8 million illnesses, 127839 hospitalizations, and 3037 deaths per year (Scallan, Griffin, Angulo, Tauxe, & Hoekstra, 2011) . In Australia, foodborne gastroenteritis causes an estimated 5.4 million illnesses, 14700 hospitalizations, and 76 deaths each year (Hall et al., 2005) . In England and Wales, foodborne gastroenteritis caused an estimated 2.4 million illnesses, 21138 hospitalizations, and 718 deaths in 1995 (Adak, Long, & O'Brien, 2002) . A study of acute gastrointestinal illness (AGI) in China estimated 209 million episodes of foodborne disease occurred in 2010e2011, and the relative incidence in China appears to be within the range of incidence reported in the abovementioned countries (Chen et al., 2013) . However, the method used to estimate the burden of foodborne disease in the United States, England and Wales and Australia was different from that in China. In the above-mentioned studies, pathogen-specific data were used to calculate the foodborne proportion of AGI. However, due to the lack of pathogen-specific data used to calculate the foodborne proportion of AGI, the Chinese study only used the foodborne proportions calculated by those studies to roughly estimate the foodborne disease in China.",

Only a small part of foodborne diseases, hospitalizations, and deaths happen as portion of identified outbreaks (Dewey-Mattia, Roberts, Vieira, & Fullerton, 2016) . However, the outbreak report is essential for a better understanding of the epidemiology of foodborne diseases. Although the summary of the outbreaks cannot lead to a clear conclusion of the disease trend, by identifying the implicated food vehicles and contributing factors, the health administration could be encouraged to evaluate and adopt suitable measures to prevent and control outbreaks in the future. Knowledge of implicated food vehicles and contributing factors allows consumers to be educated on decreasing high-risk behaviors, thereby reducing the risk of being affected by foodborne diseases. Up to date outbreak data can help food safety regulatory authorities to identify problems in the existing food supply system. Several countries systematically review foodborne disease outbreaks (FBDOs) in order to develop strategies to reduce the disease burden (Dalton et al., 2004; Gould et al., 2013; Lindqvist, Andersson, de Jong, & Norberg, 2000; O'Brien, Elson, Gillespie, Adak, & Cowden, 2002) .",

Seasonality of microbial foodborne outbreaks was observed in this summary, with a peak in the summer. Summer is associated with increased rates of Salmonella and Vibrio infection in China. The seasons might affect the incidence of infectious foodborne disease, investigating of the reasons for the summer dominance of FBDOs should be the focus of surveillance in the future. However, the seasonal peak of infection attributed to some foodborne pathogens is not in the summer. For instance, norovirus and rotavirus increase in autumn or in winter (Ahmed, Lopman, & Levy, 2013; Zhang et al., 2017) .

During 2003e2008, the virus replaced the bacterial pathogens as the most common cause of the reported FBDOs in the USA. As the number of outbreaks of viral causes increase, the number of outbreaks of unknown etiology is proportionally reduced (Gould et al., 2013) . During the same period, probably due to lack of molecular biological and immunological techniques by local health sectors, only one rotavirus outbreak was reported to China NFDSN. The percentage of outbreaks with unknown etiology was almost doubled during the period 2003e2008 (20%) compared with that of 1992e2001 (10%). In the present study, about 20% of these outbreaks had an incubation period of equal or greater than 15 h, suggesting that many were of viral causes (Olsen, MacKinnon, Goulding, Bean, & Slutsker, 2000) .

It is also a common cause of foodborne diseases in Asian countries (Alam, Tomochika, Miyoshi, & Shinoda, 2002; Raghunath, Acharya, Bhanumathi, & Karunasagar, 2008) . Consistent with the 1992e2001 report, V. parahaemolyticus remains the number one cause of foodborne disease in 2003e2008 in the area covered by the China NFDSN. Consumers can reduce the risk of shellfishrelated infections caused by V. parahaemolyticus by not eating raw or uncooked shellfish; doctors and individuals need to use antibiotics with care, since blind use of antibiotics may increase V. parahaemolyticus infection risk (Yan et al., 2015) .",

In the present study, of the outbreaks with a single known etiology, manmade chemical hazards accounted for 25% of outbreaks, 14% of cases and 55% of deaths. The number of outbreaks and mortality attributed to man-made chemicals is remarkable, and all of these outbreaks are acute poisonings. To guarantee the chemicals such as food additives, pesticides and veterinary drugs are safely used, the Chinese government needs to develop stricter regulations on food and agricultural products, and to improve the administrative law enforcement mechanism.",
