            "text": "Introduction: Infectious mononucleosis (IM) is a common viral infection that typically causes fever, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy in young patients. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the most common cause of IM, followed by cytomegalovirus (CMV). Given that serological testing is associated with limitations regarding its accuracy, availability, and time to receive results, clinical differentiation based on symptoms, signs, and basic tests would be useful. We evaluated whether clinical findings could be used to differentiate EBV-IM from CMV-IM. Methods: In this single-center retrospective case-control study, we evaluated >14-year-old patients with serologically confirmed EBV-IM or CMV-IM during 2006e2017. We compared the patients' symptoms, physical findings, blood counts, and serum biomarkers to create three regression models: model 1 (symptoms and signs), model 2 (model 1 plus sonographic hepatosplenomegaly and blood counts), and model 3 (model 2 plus hepatobiliary biomarkers). Results: Among the 122 patients (72.6%) with EBV-IM and 46 patients (27.4%) with CMV-IM, the median age was 25 years and 82 patients (48.8%) were male. The median age was 10 years older in the CMV-IM group (p < 0.001) and the median interval from onset to visit was 5 days longer in the CMV-IM group (p < 0.001). Logistic regression revealed that EBV-IM was predicted by younger age, short onset-to-visit interval, lymphadenopathy, tonsillar white coat, hepatosplenomegaly, atypical lymphocytosis, and elevations of lactate dehydrogenase and gamma-glutamyl transferase. All regression models had areas under the curve of >0.9. Conclusion: History and physical findings, especially when used with atypical lymphocytosis and sonographic hepatosplenomegaly, can help physicians differentiate EBV-IM from CMV-IM.",

            "text": "Relative to IM caused by EBV (EBV-IM), IM caused by CMV (CMV-IM) reportedly affects patients who are 10e15 years older and who present with milder lymphadenopathy and pharyngitis, but more frequent and serious hepatitis and thrombocytopenia. However, some reviews have concluded that EBV-IM and CMV-IM are nearly indistinguishable [4, 5] . In this context, serological examination is useful for identifying the causative agent. Heterophile antibody tests (HAT), which are widely available and relatively rapid tests, are limited by their low sensitivity in the early phase and in young patients [3] . Although combinations of antibodies specific to EBV or CMV are more accurate [6] , even these specific antibodies have several limitations. First, serological examination is not useful for the initial diagnosis, as it requires several days to obtain the results, which can limit its application to retrospective confirmation. Second, serological examination is expensive and not widely available, which are especially important issues in the primary care setting and in rural areas. Third, despite combinations of EBV-specific antibody tests having high accuracy, they do infrequently produce inaccurate results, such as false negatives [7] and cross-reactivity with CMV-IM [8] . Furthermore, there are questions regarding the accuracy of CMV-IgM for diagnosing primary acute CMV infection [9] . Thus, it would be helpful for primary care physicians to differentiate between EBV-IM and CMV-IM based on symptoms, clinical signs, and readily available laboratory data, such as complete blood counts (CBC). However, we are only aware of a few studies that have directly compared the clinical characteristics of EBV-IM and CMV-IM [2, 10] , and those studies were limited by their small size and the absence of multivariate analyses. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine whether clinical findings could be used to differentiate between EBV-IM and CMV-IM before serological confirmation could be obtained.",

The center's ethics committee approved the study's retrospective protocol (M17295). Patients were included if they were >14 years old and received inpatient or outpatient treatment for clinically evident and serologically confirmed EBV-IM or CMV-IM at the General Medicine and Emergency Care department between January 2006 and December 2017. Serological confirmation of EBV-IM was based on a <10 \u00c2 result for EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA) plus a !10 \u00c2 result for viral capsid antigen IgM (VCA-IgM), which were both measured using fluorescent antibody (FA) technique. Serological confirmation of CMV-IM was based on a !0.8 \u00c2 result for CMV-IgM, which was measured using enzyme immunoassay. All tests were performed by SRL (Tokyo, Japan). We regarded the initial dilution concentrations, officially provided by the manufacturer (Fujirebio Inc. Tokyo, Japan), of each examination kit as cut-off values for EBNA and VCA-IgM; this was due to the methodological difficulty involved in setting clear cut-off values for tests that use the FA technique (we discussed this issue with a staff member of SRL). The CMV-IgM cutoff value was set as 0.8 based on the value provided by the manufacturer (Denka Seiken Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) [11] . Although values between 0.8 and 1.2 were border-line, we selected the lowest value of the range to obtain the most sensitive results [11] . We intended to categorize patients who had diabetes mellitus, liver cirrhosis, end-stage renal diseases, or cancers or had received immunosuppressants or glucocorticoids as immunocompromised for exclusion. Pregnant women were not intentionally excluded. Doctors in charge of the patients included both resident doctors who had completed their 3rd post-graduate year at least and experienced attending physicians. All laboratory data were collected at the first visit.",

First, limiting the patients to serologically confirmed EBV-IM and CMV-IM cases (i.e., excluding other differential diagnoses of IM) may have produced the higher prevalence of CMV-IM in our study. Second, differences in patient ethnicity and age may be relevant, as most of the previous studies have evaluated non-Asian or pediatric patients [1, 2] . Third, a difference in the serological tests (i.e., HAT vs. EBV-specific antibodies) may explain this discrepancy. These issues in the context of serological diagnosis are discussed in the following paragraphs, as the characteristics of serological testing are relevant to the different prevalence of CMV-IM and the significance of our findings.",

In addition, HAT has been widely used to serologically support the diagnosis of EBV-IM because it is inexpensive, rapid, and widely available [7] . However, HAT can provide a negative result in 25% of EBV-IM patients during the first week of infection, and a positive result in only 25e50% of EBV-IM patients who are <12 years old [3] . Thus, given its low sensitivity, HAT is no longer recommended for the diagnosis of EBV-IM [7] and is not widely available in Japan. Given that CMV-IM was referred to as a differential diagnosis of \"heterophile antibody negative mononucleosis\" in a previous review article [3] , previous studies have probably differentiated between EBV-IM and CMV-IM based on HAT results. However, we used specific antibodies for EBV or CMV, instead of heterophile antibodies, and the differences in the serological testing methods may explain the different prevalences of CMV-IM. The current recommendation is to use EBV-specific antibodies to diagnose EBV-IM because of its better diagnostic ability than that of HAT [7] . Combined use of VCA-IgM, VCA-IgG, and EBNA provides sensitivity of 95e100% and specificity of 86e90% [6] , although the sensitivity of VCA-IgM during the first week is 85% [7] . Furthermore, cross-reactivity with CMV-IM has been reported in some patients [8] . Thus, even EBV-specific antibodies may produce inaccurate results. The reliability of CMV-IgM for diagnosing primary acute CMV infection is also problematic, as poor correlations have been reported between several commercial testing kits and false-positive results due to persistent elevation and reactivation [9] . In addition to these technological issues, specific antibody tests for EBV and CMV are expensive, difficult to use in the primary care setting, and require several days to obtain the results. Thus, although EBV-specific antibody tests are good tools for diagnosing EBV-IM, their limitations highlight the importance of not excessively relying on serological tests and to estimate the appropriate pre-test probability based on symptoms, signs, and rapidly available test results before the serological results are received.",

In this context, hepatosplenomegaly is a well-known sign of EBV-IM [3, 5] , although leukocytosis is not. Thrombocytopenia may be a predictor of CMV-IM [2, 10] , although the previous studies have reported inconsistent results and our findings indicate that thrombocytopenia was more severe, albeit not significantly, in EBV-IM cases. Although atypical lymphocytosis is assumed to be a non-specific reaction caused by various immune disturbances, we found that it significantly predicted EBV-IM in all regression models, and this result is compatible with the findings of previously studies [5, 21] .",

Similar to our results, some previous studies of hepatobiliary markers in EBV-IM and CMV-IM cases have revealed significantly higher hepatobiliary biomarkers in EBV-IM patients [10, 13] . However, other recent studies have indicated that the differences were not significant [2, 22, 23] . Our logistic regression analyses revealed that mild-to-moderate elevation of GGT and LDH were independent predictors of EBV-IM, and this finding may be useful when evaluating hepatobiliary biomarkers in IM patients. In this study, we compared hepatobiliary markers of patients with EBV-IM and CMV-IM at the time of first visit because we aimed to demonstrate the clinical differences between EBV-IM and CMV-IM that are recognizable before serological confirmation. However, the time of testing is important for interpretation because reportedly, elevation and recovery of hepatobiliary markers takes longer in CMV-IM cases than in EBV-IM cases. Thus, for precise interpretation, the interval between onset and testing should be considered for each case [2, 13] .",

However, addition of the hepatobiliary biomarkers only improved the AUC value by 0.01 (model 3). Thus, physicians may be able to accurately differentiate between EBV-IM and CMV-IM using H&P factors with or without widely available test results (e.g., CBC and hepatosplenomegaly detection), rather than relying on serological examinations.",

First, the sample size was small (168 patients and only 46 CMV-IM cases) and there were relatively large number of explanatory factors, which might affect the odds ratio estimates of variables in the logistic regression models, especially for model 3. Nevertheless, our study was larger than previous similar studies [2, 10] . We recognized that the small sample size could not allow us to estimate precise odds ratio values. However, we performed logistic regression for specific clinical and laboratory findings because we aimed to clarify the contribution of each clinical sign and laboratory finding independently. Second, our study had a potential risk of interaction among covariates in the model because clinical symptoms such as lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly and laboratory data such as lymphocytosis may have deep correlations as they have the same etiology. Although we excluded apparent multicollinearity by evaluating the variance inflation factor, the possibility of interaction and its negative impact on statistical reliability should be addressed. Third, insufficient exclusion of other differential diagnoses of IM could have reduced the reliability of our results. Because no participants (who were serologically confirmed to have EBV-IM or CMV-IM) underwent tests for serological exclusion of other differential diagnoses of IM including infection with toxoplasmosis, HHV-6, HHV-7, adenovirus, rubella, HSV, influenza/ parainfluenza, rhinovirus, and coronavirus and acute HIV infection. Although simultaneous mixed infection with EBV or CMV and other IM-causing infectious agents is rare, routine serological exclusion might have improved reliability of the study findings. Given that our study was performed in the metropolitan city of Tokyo, our study findings may have been influenced by potential confounding from undiagnosed concurrent acute HIV infection. Our results should be cautiously applied for patients with clinical IM because the patient groups in the present study were limited to patients serologically diagnosed with EBV-IM and CMV-IM and not all patients with clinically diagnosed IM. Fourth, we could not access data regarding other important factors (e.g., history of present illness and common symptoms, such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and the specific sites of the swollen lymph nodes). Fifth, variance in the clinical expertise of doctors in charge of each case may affect the results of physical examinations and reliability of the study. Sixth, we did not consider lymphocyte counts as we elected to use atypical lymphocytosis because it is more specific and significant than measured lymphocyte counts. It is possible that this approach limits the applicability of our findings, as automatic lymphocyte counts using flow cytometry are often more readily available than atypical lymphocyte counts in clinical practice [24] . Seventh, because we considered the distribution of our data, some cut-off values for the present study were not previously defined, and our values could be considered arbitrary. Further studies are needed to address these limitations, although we believe that our study provides important preliminary evidence that H&P factors and other clinical characteristics may be useful in the diagnosis of EBV-IM.",
