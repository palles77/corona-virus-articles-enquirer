We report the crystal structure of the cysteine protease domain of murine cytomegalovirus M48 (M48 USP ) in a complex with a ubiquitin (Ub)based suicide substrate. M48 USP adopts a papain-like fold, with the active-site cysteine forming a thioether linkage to the suicide substrate. The Ub core participates in an extensive hydrophobic interaction with an exposed b hairpin loop of M48 USP . This Ub binding mode contributes to Ub specificity and is distinct from that observed in other deubiquitinating enzymes. Both the arrangement of active-site residues and the architecture of the interface with Ub lead us to classify this domain as the founding member of a previously unknown class of deubiquitinating enzymes.",

Accordingly, these pathogens have learned to exploit or subvert to their own advantage the cellular enzymatic machinery that could otherwise be deployed against them. A number of these pathogens have thus evolved an elaborate molecular armory that includes pathogen-encoded ubiquitinating and deubiquitinating activities, as well as proteins capable of manipulating/hijacking the host's Ub machinery. The known functions of these pathogen-encoded activities are quite diverse. Regulation of the cell cycle, activation or suppression of the NF-kB pathway, destruction of the class I MHC glycoprotein, and regulation of intracellular trafficking are but a few examples (Gao and Luo [2006] and references cited therein).",

            "text": "How can we detect Ub-related activities that relate to host-pathogen interactions? A functional proteomic approach-where active DUBs are targeted selectively in crude cell extracts with epitope-tagged, Ub-based suicide substrates, retrieved by immunoprecipitation, and identified by mass spectrometry-has proved particularly useful in identifying new deubiquitinating enzymes (Borodovsky et al., 2002; Ovaa et al., 2004) . Using this approach, we identified a unique deubiquitinating activity present in herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1/a subfamily)infected cells . The DUB activity mapped to the N-terminal portion of UL36, a large (3156 residues) and presumably multifunctional protein of the a-herpesvirus HSV-1. UL36 is a constituent of the amorphous proteinaceous layer located between the nucleocapsid and the envelope of the herpesvirus particle, referred to as tegument. All known herpesviruses sequenced to date contain homologs of this large tegument protein. The putative key catalytic residues of the protease domain found in UL36 are conserved throughout all herpesviridae subfamilies: a, b, and g (Schlieker et al., 2005) . Deubiquitinating activity was confirmed for the UL36 homologs of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV/b subfamily), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV/b subfamily), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV/g subfamily), M48, UL48, and BPLF1, respectively (Schlieker et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2006) . Although the in vivo function of this activity is currently unknown, its strict conservation through all herpesvirus subfamilies suggests an important role in their biology. To gain insights into the structural and functional properties of this activity, we set out to determine the structure of this enzyme.",

The proposed catalytic triad and oxyanion residues of this cysteine protease module are conserved in all herpesviruses. The tegument protease domains otherwise display only moderate sequence conservation (%12% identity between representatives of a, b, and g subfamilies) yet share a high degree of structural similarity according to secondary structure predictions (Schlieker et al., 2005) . Neither BLAST searches (Altschul et al., 1997) nor threading programs that employ sequence alignment and protein-fold recognition algorithms (McGuffin et al., 2000) uncovered homologs other than herpesvirus tegument proteins (data not shown). This suggested that htUSPs have structural properties that are distinct from known DUBs and other cysteine proteases Sulea et al., 2006) . Accordingly, UL36 USP and its homologs represent an independent family (C76) in the CA clan of proteases in the MEROPS peptidase database (Rawlings et al., 2004) . To explore the structural and mechanistic properties of htUSPs, we expressed an N-terminal fragment encompassing residues 1-236 of the MCMV M48 tegument protein (M48 USP ), which likely comprises the entire USP domain of M48, because it is followed by an $70 residue region that is likely unstructured according to secondary structure predictions. To confirm that this domain is a functional deubiquitinating enzyme, we first tested the ability of M48 USP to hydrolyze the fluorogenic substrate Ub C-terminal 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (UbAMC). UbAMC hydrolysis followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with k cat / K M = 9.17 3 10 6 M \u00c01 s \u00c01 (data not shown). To determine whether M48 USP can cleave true isopeptide-linked Ub chains, we examined its ability to attack K48-linked or K63-linked diUb by using a 500-fold excess of substrate over enzyme. Both adducts were converted to free monomeric Ub, albeit with $5-fold slower kinetics for K63-linked compared to K48-linked diUb ( Figure 1A) .",

To address this issue, 293T cells were transiently transfected with HA-tagged Ub and treated with a proteasome inhibitor, ZL 3 VS (Bogyo et al., 1997) , to allow accumulation of (poly)-ubiquitinated species. Cell lysates were prepared and incubated in the absence and presence of M48 USP or its catalytically inactive counterpart, M48 USP -C23A (Schlieker et al., 2005) , and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting ( Figure 1B ). Both free Ub and Ub conjugates were readily detectable, the latter being more prominent in samples derived from ZL 3 VS-treated cells. Upon exposure to nanomolar concentrations of M48 USP , the majority of cellular Ub conjugates were deubiquitinated, as judged by the near-complete elimination of high molecular weight, anti-HA-reactive material and a corresponding increase in free Ub. For comparison, we also tested the homologous EBV-derived protease BPLF1 USP and observed similar deubiquitinating activity ( Figure 1B) , confirming that the activity exerted on poly-Ub adducts is conserved among herpesviruses.",

We crystallized M48 USP in a covalent complex with UbVME, a suicide inhibitor that forms a thioether bond with the active-site cysteine of DUBs (Borodovsky et al., 2002; Misaghi et al., 2005) . The structure was determined by using crystals of SeMet-labeled M48 USP covalently bound to UbVME in a single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) experiment. Continuous electron density was observed for residues 1-232 of the two M48 USP molecules and all residues of the two UbVME molecules in the asymmetric unit. The final model was refined to 1.8 \u00c5 resolution to an R factor of 15.8% (R free = 21.4%) (see Table 1 for data collection and refinement statistics). Because the Ca atoms of both complexes can be superimposed with 0.3 \u00c5 rootmean-square deviation (rmsd), we limit our discussion to a single complex of M48 USP with UbVME (chains A and C).",

Electron density indicates a 1.9 \u00c5 covalent bond between the M48 USP C23 Sg atom and the Cb-carbon atom of the former VME moiety that replaces the C-terminal G76 of wild-type Ub ( Figure 2C ), reminiscent of the covalent complex between UbVME and UCH-L3 (Misaghi et al., 2005) . Complex formation buries 1840 \u00c5 2 of solvent-accessible surface area, corresponding to 816 \u00c5 2 (7%) and 1024 \u00c5 2 (21%) of the total solvent-accessible surface area of free M48 USP and UbVME, respectively. The size of this interface is comparable to the corresponding ones in UCH enzymes, e.g., 2300 A 2 in UCH-L3 (Misaghi et al., 2005) , but smaller than in HAUSP (3600 \u00c5 2 ) (Hu et al., 2002) and other USPs. Electrostatic surface potential calculations show a high degree of charge complementarity: positively charged surface regions of the extended Ub C terminus (residues 71-75) are deeply buried in the largely acidic cleft of M48 USP ( Figure 2B ). The backbone of the Ub C terminus adopts an extended b conformation and is extensively coordinated by seven salt bridges and hydrogen bonds to residues lining the M48 USP cleft, conferring sequence specificity for the Ub C terminus ( Figure 3A ). In addition, a hydrophobic pocket lined by M48 USP V140 and Y192 accommodates the Ub L73 side chain (Figures 2B and 3A) . Binding of the C-terminal Ub segment in an extended conformation in the active-site cleft is a common feature of DUBs, as observed in the crystal structures of Ub derivatives in complex with UCH-L3, HAUSP, USP2, and USP14 (Hu et al., 2002 (Hu et al., , 2005 Misaghi et al., 2004; Renatus et al., 2006) .",

This prediction is unambiguously confirmed for C23, which forms a thioether linkage to the UbVME suicide inhibitor ( Figure 2C ). The addition of C23 to the former VME moiety imposes an sp3 configuration on the VME b carbon atom, thus resembling the tetrahedral reaction intermediate during catalysis, but with the oxyanion replaced by a hydrogen atom. This hydrogen is located in a pocket that is lined by the conserved Q10 and corresponds to the oxyanion hole observed in other cysteine proteases ( Figure 4C ). Thus, the transition-state oxyanion is likely coordinated by the Q10 side chain and the backbone NH groups of Q22 and the catalytically active C23 ( Figure 4C ). Furthermore, the catalytic aspartic acid residue can be assigned to D156 due to its location and distance to the catalytic C23 ( Figure 4B ). Consistently, an D156A substitution results in a 180-fold reduction of catalytic activity ( Figure 5A) .",

A side-chain rearrangement is required to position either histidine within hydrogen bonding distance to C23 and D156, in order to form a functional proton relay system. Possible scenarios for either rearrangement can be derived from structurally related cysteine proteases. Figure 4D shows that in superimposed structures of M48 USP and UCH-L3, C23, D156, and H141 correspond to UCH-L3 catalytic triad residues. Therefore, to form a functional catalytic triad, the M48 USP H141 side chain may adopt a rotamer conformation observed for the corresponding UCH-L3 histidine, as is observed in the vast majority of cysteine proteases. On the other hand, the conserved M48 USP H158 could instead participate in catalysis after adopting a conformation that corresponds to the unusual histidine alignment found in the catalytic triad of the structurally related human cysteine protease Atg4B ( Figure 4E ).",

Enzymatic activity was assessed by measuring the hydrolysis of UbAMC. Both sin-gle substitutions remained enzymatically active, with a 3.5-fold and a 146-fold reduction of hydrolytic activity compared to WT enzyme for the H141A and H158A mutants, respectively ( Figure 5A ). In contrast, the doublemutant protein (H141A/H158A) completely lacked catalytic activity ( Figure 5A ). However, activity was partially restored in a concentration-dependent manner upon addition of imidazole (data not shown). We conclude that H158 is the principal catalytic histidine as judged by the more pronounced reduction of catalytic activity of the H158A mutant, consistent with H158 being conserved throughout the htUSPs. Nevertheless, the residual activity of H158A is still substantial at saturating substrate concentrations (k cat = 1.38/min, Figure 5B ). To confirm that the residual catalytic activity observed for H158A indeed involves H141, we mutated H141 to glycine or tyrosine, the corresponding residues in HSV-1 and EBV, respectively ( Figure 4A ), or to glutamine-a conservative replacement-into a H158A background ( Figure 5A ). All three double mutants were catalytically inactive, even when tested at 50-fold-higher enzyme and saturating substrate concentrations ( Figure 5B ). Therefore, neither glycine, tyrosine, nor glutamine can replace H141 when H158 is changed to alanine. Because the H141Q and H141Y single mutants had 58% and 68% of WT activity, respectively Figure 5A ), the inactivity of the double mutants is unlikely to result from structural distortions, albeit we cannot formally exclude this possibility.",

For example, USP21 and UCH-L3 can cleave Ub and NEDD8 (Gong et al., 2000; Misaghi et al., 2005; Wada et al., 1998) , whereas USP14 is bispecific for Ub and ISG15 (Hemelaar et al., 2004) . In contrast, M48 USP and its relatives in the herpesvirus family are highly specific for Ub, because NEDD8-, SUMO-, and ISG15-based suicide inhibitors fail to inhibit enzymatic activity, even when present in a 100-fold molar excess over the respective enzyme What is the structural basis for the observed specificity? In general, DUBs feature a largely acidic catalytic cleft that accommodates the complementary basic C-terminal Ub stretch ( 71 LRLRGG 76 ), implicating the cleft in substrate recognition and specificity (Hu et al., 2002) . For instance, the C-terminal sequence of SUMO ( 72 QEQTGG 76 ) is clearly different and of opposite charge compared to the Ub C terminus, and consequently, SUMO cannot bind to M48 USP . Other Ubls, however, terminate in a sequence similar or identical to Ub ( Figure S1B ). For example, the ISG15 C-terminal sequence LRLRGG is identical to that of Ub. Therefore, additional interactions outside the active-site cleft must determine substrate specificity. A superposition of the structure of free ISG15 (Narasimhan et al., 2005) on UbVME bound to M48 USP indicates that the ISG15 C terminus would require only minor structural changes to enter the M48 USP active site (data not shown). However, the M48 USP b hairpin that tightly interacts with the Ub core domain ( Figure 3A ) lacks surface complementarity for the ISG15 core domain (data not shown), suggesting that several unfavorable contacts between the b hairpin of M48 USP and ISG15 mainly account for the discrimination between Ub and ISG15.",

To test whether the NEDD8 A72 indeed determines M48 USP specificity, we generated a NEDD8-based suicide inhibitor (NEDD8-VME) and its mutant derivative (NEDD8 A72R -VME). In agreement with our previous data (Schlieker et al., 2005) , we observed negligible covalent adduct formation of M48 USP with NEDD8-VME. In contrast, NEDD8 A72R -VME readily reacted with M48 USP to yield a covalent adduct ( Figure S2 ).

A structural similarity search using the DALI algorithm (Holm and Sander, 1993) showed that $140 aa in the catalytic core of M48 USP share moderate structural similarity to papain-like cysteine proteases (best Z score, 7.1) and only weak similarities to DUBs like USP6 from S. cerevisiae (1vjv; Z score, 4.2) and human UCH-L3 (1uch; Z score, 2.2) (Table S1 ). For comparison, UCH-L3/ UCH-L1 and USP2/HAUSP pairwise comparisons yield Z scores of 33 and 27, respectively, whereas a pairwise comparison of two classes, e.g., UCH-L1/HAUSP as representatives from UCH and USP families, yields scores of $4. We conclude that M48 USP is a member of the papain protease superfamily but is only distantly related to cellular DUBs of known structure.

Furthermore, H141, which is not conserved but might participate in catalysis, is also shown. The covalently bound UbVME is represented by green sticks.

(C) The proposed oxyanion hole is occupied by the hydrogen atom of the b carbon atom of the former vinylmethylester moiety, thus resembling a catalytic intermediate except that the oxyanion is replaced by a hydrogen. The Q10 side chain and NH groups of C23 and Q22 are <4 \u00c5 from this hydrogen atom and are thus likely to coordinate the oxyanion during catalysis.

Second, UCH-L3 features a crossover loop that is disordered in the substrate-free structure and ordered above the active-site cleft when Ub is bound (Johnston et al., 1997; Misaghi et al., 2005) . Third, HAUSP lacks an a helix corresponding to a helix C in M48 USP and features an extensive ''N-terminal'' insertion dubbed the finger domain that forms mainly water-mediated contacts with the Ub (Ubl) core domain during catalysis (Hu et al., 2002) . Fourth, M48 USP is more closely related to the classic papain-like proteases than to other DUBs and features a unique b hairpin to recognize Ub and discriminate other Ubls (see above and Table S1 ). Fifth, sequence alignments ( Figure 4A ) and our mutational data suggest that H158 is the principal participant of the catalytic triad, yielding the primary sequence order cysteine / aspartic acid / histidine. This order has so far been observed only in Atg4B (Kumanomidou et al., 2006) , whereas all other cysteine proteases of known structure, including DUBs, feature a cysteine / histidine / aspartic acid/ asparagine catalytic triad in their primary sequence. In conclusion, M48 USP shows distinct features in its tertiary fold and catalytic triad and a unique Ub binding b hairpin. In agreement with the listing of HSV UL36 as the founding member of a new cysteine protease family in the MEROPS database (Gao and Luo, 2006; Rawlings et al., 2004) , we conclude that the M48 USP structure defines a previously unknown class of cysteine protease DUBs and confirms the existence of a new cysteine protease family (C76), which we term herpesvirus tegument USPs (htUSPs).",

This mutant is impaired in sustaining a productive infection in mice in vivo (L.M.K, C.S., H.L.P., unpublished data). With additional data in support of an essential role of the USP activity in vivo, htUSPs, and possibly other pathogen-encoded DUBs, deserve scrutiny from the perspective of drug design for treating pathogen infections. The respective structures will be important scaffolds to facilitate the design of specific inhibitors, all the more so if the pathogen-encoded DUBs are sufficiently different from cellular proteases, as exemplified by htUSPs.",

The corresponding domain of EBV, BPLF USP , specifying aa 1-276, was purified accordingly. Ub C-terminal 7amido-4-methylcoumarin (UbAMC) and diubiquitin (K63-and K48-linked) were purchased from Boston Biochem. Densiometric quantifications for diUb conversions were obtained with ImageJ and subsequently fitted to a single exponential decay in Kaleidagraph. UbAMC hydrolysis assays were performed in assay buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT [pH 7.5]), supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Roche) at 25 C. Enzyme concentrations were determined with the Bradford reagent (Biorad) and BSA (Pierce) as standard. Measurements were performed in triplicate with 20 pM (unless stated otherwise) of the respective enzyme in a total volume of 30 ml/well in a 384-well plate (NUNC) using a Spectramax M2 plate reader (Molecular Devices), with a 368 nm/467 nm filter pair and a 455 nm cutoff. 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Anaspec Inc.) was used for calibration. Kinetic parameters (V max , K M ) were calculated by fitting initial velocities via a nonlinear regression to the Michaelis-Menten equation in Kaleidagraph, using substrate concentrations ranging from 0 to 5 mM. k cat was determined from the equation k cat = V max / [E]; with [E] = total enzyme concentration.",

Hydrolytic activities are given as the ratio of initial velocities (nM AMC released/min) and total enzyme concentration E (nM). Errors are the standard deviations calculated from three independent experiments. (B) The mutants indicated by ''1'' in (A) have no catalytic activity, within experimental error. The corresponding mutants were therefore tested at 50-fold higher enzyme concentrations (5 nM) and saturating substrate concentrations (5 mM; [UbAMC] >> K M ), further demonstrating that they are completely inactive. 684 Molecular Cell 25, 677-687, March 9, 2007 \u00aa2007 Elsevier Inc.",
