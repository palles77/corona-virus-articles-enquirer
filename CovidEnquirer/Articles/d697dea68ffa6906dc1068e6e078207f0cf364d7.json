Infectious bronchitis virus causes an acute, highly contagious respiratory and urogenital disease of chickens which results in significant economic losses in commercial broilers, layers and breeders. A rapid, highly sensitive and specific method is needed in the differential diagnosis of infections of different serotypes. A multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was developed and optimized to simultaneously detect Massachusetts (Mass) and Arkansas (Ark) serotypes of IBV. One common primer and two serotype specific primers were chosen from the S1 gene sequences of IBV and used in one PCR reaction. Under optimized PCR conditions, two serotype specific PCR products, 1026 bp for Mass and 896 bp for Ark, respectively, were amplified and detected by agarose gel electrophoreses. The specificity of the technique was verified by using 20 different strains and isolates of IBV, and other avian bacterial and viral pathogens. Using a serial 10-fold dilution of the artificial mixture of both Mass and Ark samples, the detection limit was found to be 5 pg RNA after 35 cycles of PCR. The multiplex PCR was able to detect and differentiate both serotypes in embryonated eggs that were co-infected with different EID 50 virus titers of Mass 41 and Ark 99. The multiplex PCR developed in this study will be valuable for rapid identification, differential diagnosis, and epidemiological studies of these two serotypes of IBV infections.",

Sequence analysis of different serotypes of IBV S1 An IBV specific multiplex PCR amplification technique was optimized which would be able to identify gene suggested that a few amino acids change could give rise to a new serotype, particularly if it occurs Mass and Ark serotypes of IBV in a single RT-PCR reaction. The IBV multiplex PCR products consisted in an area close to the N-terminus of S1 gene. 1, 25 Most of the nucleotide mismatches are concentrated of 1026 bp for IBV-Mass and 896 bp of IBV-Ark serotypes as expected and there were no detectable DNA in the N-terminus of S1 gene, few are found in the C-terminus of S1 gene. Kwok et al. 28 demonstrated bands observed for the other IBV strains or serotypes (Fig. 1) . No spurious PCR amplification reactions that two to three mismatches at the end of 3\u2032 of primers can be specific and can be applied in the between these two serotypes were observed. There were no PCR products generated from the NDV, avian design of strain-specific primers. In this study, one common lower primer was selected from the C-Reovirus and M. gallisepticum S6 nucleic acid (data not shown). The experiment was repeated three times terminus and two serotype specific upper primers from the N-terminus by comparing the known S1 and the results were reproducible. The multiplex PCR assay developed and evaluated in this study was sequences of different serotypes or strains from North America to use in multiplex PCR. found to be a specific assay for IBV Mass and Ark serotypes.",
