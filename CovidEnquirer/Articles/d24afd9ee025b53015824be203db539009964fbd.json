Oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal specimens from all patients were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, China, and were found positive for pandemic novel H1N1. [7] All patients were treated by a team of specialists in the fields of infectious respiratory disease and critical care medicine, assigned during the outbreak of novel H1N1. A standard treatment protocol was arranged and implemented, including combined therapy with antibacterial, antiviral, and corticosteroid agents, as well as ventilation support when necessary. Eight patients died during hospitalization. The remaining 82 patients were discharged after clinical improvement. Although all 82 were scheduled for thin-section CT follow-up study, 24 patients (15 men, 9 women; mean age, 40 years; age range, 22-69 years) who had been discharged from our hospital between September 15, 2009 and January 1, 2010 were enrolled in the study after informed consent was obtained. These patients underwent a thin-section CT examination 3 years after the onset of symptoms. The remaining 58 patients refused to participate in the study after their discharge from the hospital.",

Each lung was divided into three zones: Upper, middle, and lower. Each of the three zones spanned one-third of the craniocaudal distance of the lung on a frontal radiograph. The percentage area of parenchyma involved in each zone for each lung was assessed by visual estimation, with the maximum percentage of each zone being 100%.

In the remaining 17 patients (70.8%), the predominant thin-section CT findings included ground-glass opacity in 15/24 (62.5%), architectural distortion in 10/24 (41.7%), and parenchymal bands in 10/24 (41.7%) [ Figure 1 ]. Other CT findings were as follows: Air trapping in 9/24 (37.5%) [ Figure 2 ], reticulation in 8/24 (33.3%), and traction bronchiectasis in 2/24 (8.3%). Among the 17 cases with abnormalities, no thin-section CT evidence of consolidation or honeycombing was found. Ten patients with the CT finding of architectural distortion (two patients with traction bronchiectasis, concomitantly) were designated as Group 1 (10/24; 41.7%), and other fourteen patients without the CT findings of fibrosis were designated as Group 2 (14/24; 58.3%). The most common CT pattern observed was ground-glass opacity along with superimposed architectural distortion in Group 1 patients (100%; 10/10) and ground-glass opacity in Group 2 patients (35.7%; 5/14). In addition to the most common pattern, parenchymal bands (80%; 8/10), air trapping (60%; 6/10), reticulation (70%; 7/10), and traction bronchiectasis (20%; 2/10) were noted in Group 1 and parenchymal bands (14.3%; 2/14), air trapping (21.4%; 3/14), and reticulation (7.1%; 1/14) were noted in Group 2. Besides two patients with mechanical ventilation therapy during the acute phase, the distribution of abnormal follow-up thin-section CT findings of 22 patients was consistent with the same region on previous CT scans. The two patients with mechanical ventilation therapy typically had pulmonary sequelae and were most pronounced in the anterior nondependent portions of the lung, which showed only mild involvement during the acute phase.

The mechanical ventilation therapy rate was higher in Group 1 patients than in Group 2 patients (Z = \u22122.340, P = 0.019). During their hospital stay, Group 1 patients also received a higher number of doses of cumulative prednisolone-equivalent than did Group 2 patients (Z = \u22122.579, P = 0.010).

The normal range of AST, LDH, and CK level at our institution is 0-40 U/L, 114-240 U/L, and 0-190 U/L, respectively. The peak opacification on chest radiographs was higher in Group 1 patients compared with that in group 2 patients (Z = \u22122.743, P = 0.006).

            "text": "The CT findings of patients in the acute stage of H1N1 virus-associated pneumonia were unilateral or bilateral ground-glass opacities with or without focal or multifocal areas of consolidation, [12] which tended to result in short-term residual disease. [13, 14] In our study, follow-up thin-section CT scans obtained in discharged patients 3 years after the H1N1 virus-associated pneumonia showed that pulmonary sequelae occurred in 17 of 24 (70.8%) patients, and fibrosis occurred in 10 of 24 (41.7%) patients. These findings of our study revealed that pulmonary sequelae, especially fibrosis, are a frequently long-term complication of H1N1 virus-associated pneumonia. According to reports in the literature, the main pathological change associated with H1N1 virus-associated pneumonia is diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). [13] The histologic appearance of DAD is divided into acute phase, and organizing phase depends on the time from the initial lung injury to lung biopsy. From the initial injury through the 1 st week, acute phase DAD is characterized histologically by the presence of hyaline membranes and edema of the alveolar walls. After the 1 st week, the organizing phase of DAD predominates and is characterized by organizing fibroblastic tissue and fibrosis. [14] Histologic appearance of DAD can mirror by paired inspiration-expiration thin-section CT scans. [15] In our study, thin-section CT evidence of architectural distortion (10/24; 41.7%) and traction bronchiectasis (2/24; 8.3%) were found. Architectural distortion is characterized by abnormal displacement of bronchi, vessels, fissures, or septa, and traction bronchiectasis represents irregular bronchial and bronchiolar dilatation caused by surrounding pulmonary fibrosis, [8] both of which reflect the pathological findings of lung fibrosis. [16, 17] With the exception of architectural distortion and traction bronchiectasis, the follow-up thin-section CT findings included ground-glass opacity (15/2; 62.5%), parenchymal bands (10/24; 41.7%), air trapping (9/24; 37.5%), and reticulation (8/24; 33.3%). Patients in group 1 had a higher rate of ground-glass opacity (100% [ [1 of 14] ) than patients in Group 2. Some of these CT findings reflect pulmonary fibrosis but could not be used as evidence of fibrosis, since it may also be present during the acute illness. Ground-glass opacities as nonspecific findings are generally pathologically attributable to the combined effects of diminished intra-alveolar air and increased cellular density, alveolar cuboidal cell hyperplasia, or thickening of the alveolar septa. [18] Persistent ground-glass opacity present on serial inspiration thin-section CT scans suggests the possibility of organizing pneumonia or focal fibrosis. [19] Air trapping is defined as parenchymal areas with less than normal increase in attenuation seen on end-expiration CT scans and lack of volume reduction. [20] Air trapping may be caused by diseases of the small airways. [21] It has been reported that the extent of air trapping assessed by expiratory CT significantly correlates with airflow obstruction. [22] Air trapping observed on thin-section CT in our patients was similar to that observed in the late stages of SARS, such as in the research of Chang et al. [15] in which air trapping was found in 16 of 20 patients at 140.7 \u00b1 26.7 days after symptom onset.",

These parameters during treatment in patients with H1N1 virus-associated pneumonia are most likely a reflection of the severity of disease. According to former studies, the extents of abnormalities on radiographs during patient treatment are most likely a reflection of the severity of influenza pneumonia. Cho et al. [23] found that patient with severe H1N1 virus-associated pneumonia had a significantly greater extent of lung involvement than those nonpatients. LDH, AST, and CK are reliable independent indicators of a worse clinical result. Xi et al. [24] found that LDH was independent predictors of hospital mortality in H1N1 virus-associated pneumonia. Patients with increased serum level of AST are at a higher risk of death during hospitalization. [25] CK is also a biomarker of severity in H1N1 infection. Elevation of CK was associated with more complications and increased ICU length of stay. [26] Patients with evidence of fibrosis at thin-section CT also had a higher requirement of steroid therapy during treatment. The need for pulsed steroid therapy may reflect the magnitude of the cytokine \"storm\" elicited by the viral antigen, which may be the underlying pathogenesis of lung damage and subsequent development of fibrosis. [27] Besides the severity of disease, barotrauma or oxygen toxicity maybe also a major cause of lung fibrosis. N\u00f6bauer-Huhmann et al. [28] found that ARDS frequently is followed by fibrosis in lung, and the distribution pattern of fibrotic changes are predominantly located in the ventral zones of the lung. They confirm that the anterior location of the fibrosis may be related to barotrauma due to mechanical ventilation or oxygen toxicity, whereas the dependent lung is protected by collapse. In our study, 2 of 6 patients (33.3%) with mechanical ventilation therapy were predominantly located in the ventral zones of the lung [ Figure 3 ], and we speculate that the barotrauma due to mechanical ventilation or oxygen toxicity was one of the causes of long-term pulmonary sequelae and fibrosis.",

There is a difference between patients with evidence of fibrosis at thin-section CT and those without in terms of rate of mechanical ventilation therapy, cumulative prednisolone-equivalent dose, maximum levels of AST, maximum levels of LDH, maximum levels of CK, and peak radiographic opacification during treatment, which suggests that fibrosis is more likely to develop in patients with more severe disease, and barotrauma due to mechanical ventilation or oxygen toxicity was also one of causes of lung fibrosis. However, we wish to clearly state that our findings are only preliminary, and larger studies will be necessary to better determine the long-term outcome for patients with H1N1 virus-associated pneumonia.
