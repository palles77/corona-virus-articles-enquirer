            "text": "The primary aims of a microbial forensics investigation are to identify the biological agent, its source, and the individuals responsible for the event (1). Analytic approaches will differ when the suspected biothreat agent is encountered in a container or the environment, as opposed to in vivo in a human, animal, or plant. Analyses of trace elements, pollens, growth media, latent fingerprints, and microbial and nonmicrobial nucleic acids are all applicable to the container and environmental sample (2) . However, once the microorganism or its toxin is in the living host, it is no longer possible to analyze the preceding items except the microbial nucleic acid. However, the host's response to the biological agent may be available for analytic clues. This is akin to other forensic studies where physical traces of bite marks, scratches, wound trajectories, and sizes of wounds are often surrogate evidence of the teeth, fingernails, and bullets (3) . While the forensic pathologist is familiar with evidence related to determining the manner of death, including the host response, those involved with health care alone are more familiar with the host response. In the context of microbial forensics it is important to integrate all of these with intelligence information so that they may be included in the analytical data and attribution picture.",

            "text": "The host response to a microorganism or other foreign substance is often a well-orchestrated series of events, which may protect the individual from harm or ameliorate its effects (4) . At the same time, these host responses may provide clues as to the identity of the offending microorganism or toxin, as well as a rough chronology of when it occurred and for how long it has been persisting. Emerging technologies, such as transcriptional arrays and bioinformatic analysis, will eventually be refined and methods validated to provide even greater help in delineating more of the pathways and components of the host response to an infectious agent (5, 6) . Other technologies are sufficiently mature to be of use today. The immune system and its components are a mainstay of our protection against infections and malignancies (4, 7) . Inflammation is often a side effect as the immune system contains and eradicates a microorganism or eliminates foreign tissue. Specific arms of the immune system can be used as markers in support of or against the presence of an infection. The humoral or antibody response to an invading microorganism is one example of a specific immune response that can have forensic value. Some of the antibodies produced may have a protective role together with other parts of the immune system by eradicating the pathogen or neutralizing a toxin. Other antibodies may not be as effective in this role. However, by virtue of their ability to recognize unique and specific microbial antigens, they can serve as indicators that a specific microorganism was recently present or was present in the past. In the case of vaccine-induced immunity, antibodies may recognize highly specific epitopes of one microbe versus those of a related microbe (e.g., influenza virus). This is especially so with different recombinant vaccines and could have forensic importance. Substances such as antibiotics, which can kill a pathogen rapidly, may modify the immune response by removing or reducing the stimulus for a full-scale response. As noted earlier, in clinical and veterinary medicine, measurement of the immune response helps the diagnostician decide what infection was present and how recently. In these situations, the intent is to provide treatment. The forensic scientist may exploit parts of the immune response to discover who is likely a victim of an attack and who might be responsible. This chapter discusses the basics of the host immune response that can have forensic utility.",

A vaccine can be a live or attenuated microbe, a whole nonproliferating microbe or an antigenic (recombinant) component of the microbe, or a toxoid. Vaccines may contain an adjuvant (e.g., alum) to stimulate the humoral response of the host. Regardless, the intent of immunization is to engender protection, often by the generation of protective neutralizing antibodies. Although the half-life of an individual IgG molecule is less than a month, a population of antibodies of the IgG isotype form may persist for life. Memory B cells can sustain these antibodies and retain the ability to respond quickly by generating the appropriate antibodies when challenged. When the immune system encounters another infection or is subjected to a revaccination (booster), the result is an accelerated production of the particular antibody and an increase in the levels of antibodies that circulate in the blood (Figure 21 .1).",

The first time the immune system encounters antigen X (AgX) it responds as shown in Figures barely discernible; then levels rise and later fall to a plateau. If a simultaneous exposure were to occur with AgX and a new AgY from another microorganism, the immune system would quickly mount a brisk response with high levels of Ab to AgX, while the course of Ab to AgY would be slow and delayed, just as it was in the response to the first exposure to AgX. This phenomenon, termed \"immunological memory\" or an \"amnestic response,\" can be useful when the symptoms and signs of exposure to either X or Y are similar.

As illustrated in Table 21 .4, a person infected for the first time with one strain of the influenza virus has a response to most of its antigens (as a theoretical example, Ag 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Three years later, the same individual exposed to a partially similar influenza virus responds preferentially to those antigens that were also present on the original influenza virus (secondary immune response). The person also has a primary antibody response to new antigens, that is, those not shared with the first virus. Ten or 20 years later, during a new flu season and exposure to a third strain of influenza, the most brisk responses would be to antigens previously recognized by the immune system. This is the scientific basis for giving the flu vaccine, which contains a variety of possible antigens common to multiple strains of the flu virus so that a rapid and protective antibody response will occur.",

The study by Dewan and colleagues (26) provides a contemporary background database on a group of postal workers who may have been exposed to B. anthracis. Beginning on October 29, 2001 , 1657 postal employees and others who had been to the Washington, DC, postal facility went to the D.C. General Hospital for antibiotics. Added to this number were those people whose treatment began on October 21, 2001 . Serum samples were also obtained from the 202 individuals who had been to the Washington, DC, postal facility during the previous 2 weeks. All were negative for anti-PA IgG, including three individuals who reported a remote history of anthrax vaccination. The consistent negative findings may be explained by the fact that antibiotic therapy was initiated before serum was obtained for testing and that there were no baseline serum samples available for testing. Also, the time period from exposure to sampling was very short. Among 28 individuals in the Capitol region with culture-positive nasal swabs who received prophylactic antibiotics immediately, none had a positive culture from a nasal swab repeated 7 days later, and none developed IgG to PA 42 days after exposure. This again emphasizes the limitation and interpretation of a test in someone who had early antibiotic treatment. It does raise forensic utility considerations. Even with these easily disseminated spores, an antibody response may be aborted or modified with antibiotics by early treatment. Furthermore, antibiotics taken prior to exposure would likely be effective in preventing laboratory and clinical signs of an infection. Detection of microbial DNA, antigen, or the organism itself on a person's body, clothing, or possessions should be an indicator for exposure.",

            "text": "Plague is a zoonotic infection caused by Yersinia pestis, which occurs in the western United States with regularity and has an animal reservoir. The situation with the naturally occurring plague is in contrast to the appearance of a case of smallpox, which would be an immediate indication of a bioterrorist event (see Chapter 15) . Cases need to be approached from an epidemiological standpoint first to determine whether it is a naturally acquired case or whether facts point to a deliberate introduction of the organism. Currently, analytical techniques could include genomic analysis of an isolated organism and immunological response of the host. In the new era of rapid and deep sequencing, our capacity to investigate the genomics is growing (37) (see Chapter 27) . In consideration of animal reservoirs, ELISA assays were compared with other tests for detection of plague antibody and antigen in multimammate mice (Mastomys coucha and M. natalensis) (38) , which were experimentally infected and then sacrificed at daily intervals. IgG ELISA was equivalent in sensitivity to passive hemagglutination and more sensitive than the IgM ELISA and complement fixation. Antibody was detectable by day 6 after infection using all four tests. IgM ELISA titers fell to undetectable levels after 8 weeks. Plague fraction 1 antigen was detected in 16 of 34 bacteremic sera from M. coucha and M. natalensis. This antibody pattern comparison shows that the principle of IgM versus IgG to this pathogen works to temporally situate the infection as an early versus late or past event. It also shows that when the information is combined with antigen detection, it engenders more confidence in the results. It should be noted that conclusions from this older reference have been substantiated with more defined antigens and assay technologies.",

            "text": "The context and geographic location where an infection or biothreat occurs may dictate how an infection is viewed and evaluated. An example is provided by melioidosis, which is not endemic to the United States. Melioidosis is caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei (39) . Key clinical signs and laboratory results may raise the possibility of an infection with this pathogen. Whether it is an acute, persistent, or past infection can be determined by assessing several host responses. Often a simple nonspecific indicator such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein (CRP) can raise the clinical suspicion of an infection. In a study of 46 patients with clinical melioidosis, 35 (22 culture positive and 13 culture negative) had relatively uneventful disease courses. Initially, they had elevated serum CRP that decreased with antibiotic therapy and returned to normal as the disease resolved. In another series of patients, IgM and IgG were measured by ELISA in 95 sera from 66 septicemic cases and 47 sera from 20 cases with localized melioidosis (40) . Sixty-five sera from culture-negative cases were seronegative for other endemic infections but those suspected of melioidosis were also examined. Other controls included serum from 260 nonmelioidosis cases, 169 high-exposure risk cases, and 48 healthy individuals. The IgG ELISA was 96% sensitive and 94% specific. All sera from cases with septicemic and localized infections and 61 of 63 sera from clinically suspected melioidosis cases were positive for IgG antibody. Sensitivity and specificity of the IgM ELISA were 74 and 99%, respectively. A geometric antibody index for IgM antibody in sera of melioidosis cases was significantly higher in cases compared with that of noncase controls. In another study, a rapid test for IgG and IgM was shown to have clinical utility (41) . A study with the intent of evaluating the utility of an IgG assay compared with other assays illustrates how the clinical and temporal context must be integrated for interpretation (42) . It also illustrates how there is room for technical improvement in tests but the best setting is often the endemic area itself or at least using samples from that area in which the infection is occurring. These tests were evaluated in the actual clinical setting in an area endemic for melioidosis. Specificity of IgG (82.5%) and IgM (81.8%) assays were significantly better than that of an indirect hemagglutination test (IHA) (74.7%). Sensitivity of the IgG assay (85.7%) was higher than that of the IHA test (71.0%) and the IgM test (63.5%). Specific IgG was found in septicemic cases (87.8%) and localized infections (82.6%). The IgG test was also better than the IgM test and the IHA test in identifying acute melioidosis cases in the first 5 days after admission. IgG antibody to a B. pseudomallei antigen remained high for longer than 5 years in recovered, disease-free patients. Because this is a disease that may have an incubation of days to years, an acute case may very well be detected by a rise in specific IgM if it were a matter of days from infection. Although endemic for southeast Asia, if B. pseudomallei was used as a biothreat agent in a different environment, its course and manifestations may not be recognized due to unfamiliarity with the disease.",

            "text": "Anthrax can be used as an example where investigatory leads can be generated by considering a scenario in toto. The elderly woman who died in Connecticut from inhalation anthrax clearly had no occupational exposure nor was she known to have had contact with anyone who had anthrax. It was possible that she had contact with cross-contaminated mail. However, if this case had occurred as the index case or out of context of the mail attacks, it would have been reasonable to question her travel history; what her work, if any, was; or if she received or used spore-contaminated products from an anthrax-endemic area. Similarly, the Vietnamese woman who died of inhalation anthrax in New York City would also have had these questions investigated. It would have been useful to search for direct or indirect evidence of anthrax by physical examinations of her contacts or close neighbors. Inspection and cultures from her workplace, apartment, and apartment complex (especially contiguous neighbors) are important for detecting the presence of B. anthracis. Co-workers, friends, neighbors, and other contacts could have had their serum analyzed for antibody to antigens of B. anthracis. These samples could have been frozen so that if one were positive it would be available for a subsequent comparison study. At a minimum, these types of studies could serve as future control data for the geographic region. With molecular methods, even trace amounts might be detectable (49) , although parallel investigation using background controls would be necessary. Although hypothetical, several results could have occurred, and each will be considered separately. First example: a close contact is positive for IgM to one of the B. anthracis antigens, such as PA. This finding would suggest that this person had recent exposure and, if nothing else, should be treated. This individual could conceivably be the one who knowingly or unknowingly passed the spores to the patient. Given the October 26 onset of illness, which Possible Scenarios of Bioterrorism Attacks is late in the mailing sequence, it would be less likely that this individual was a perpetrator but rather a recent victim. However, if this person were IgG positive, then there are several other possibilities. Perhaps this person had past exposure in an endemic region and was treated (e.g., Haiti, where anthrax is known as \"charcoal disease\"); this person could have been vaccinated for bona fide reasons, such as a researcher who received it to protect against occupational exposure; or this person could have obtained the vaccine originally for legitimate or illegal purposes but was nevertheless vaccinated. The vaccine usage may have been for a clinical trial or for animal experimentation. Animal vaccines may be more obtainable without strict record keeping. This person could have loaded the mail with relative impunity if there was protective antibody generated from the vaccination. Situations similar to this one will require intelligence information regarding access, ability, and motive. In an area where recombinant vaccines are being developed or used, the antibody response would be different between someone using one type of recombinant vaccine as compared to someone using another type of vaccine. Nevertheless, finding IgG to one or more antigens of B. anthracis could point investigators toward such a seropositive individual, whereas an IgM finding could justify critical therapy. Where information points to a particular individual, investigation could be extended to search for ingestion or injection of antibiotics as illustrated later in the ciprofloxacin example. Questions would be raised regarding access to antibiotics, recent ingestion/injection of them, half-life of the antibiotic, half-life of the metabolites of the antibiotics, and in which body fluids or tissues can the residual be found. As illustrated from data in the earlier sections, someone with antibiotics in his/her system may be protected following exposure to a potential pathogen. This person would be antibody negative and likely antigen and microbial DNA/RNA negative, as the infection would have been eradicated before the organism could proliferate to any significant level. The widespread prophylactic use of ciprofloxacin during the period following the anthrax mailing attacks is illustrative of an understudied area. Ciprofloxacin has been increasingly associated with tendonitis and ruptured Achilles tendons (50, 51) . In the future, better methodology to follow pharmacokinetics of an anti-infective compound may have forensic implications. In the last example, someone who takes an antibiotic prophylactically while manipulating a lethal microbe may exhibit side effects that, in proper context of an investigation, may add to the picture of possible culpability. This area is far from established at this point in time.",

Computed tomography of the chest showed bilateral effusions and multilobar pulmonary consolidation but still no significant mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Pleural fluid aspiration was positive for B. anthracis DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Bacterial cultures of bronchial washings and pleural fluid were negative. Immunohistochemical staining of a transbronchial biopsy demonstrated the presence of B. anthracis capsule and cell-wall antigens. During hospitalization, his white blood count rose to 26,800/ mm 3 , and fluid from a second thoracentesis was positive for B. anthracis DNA by PCR. Immunohistochemical staining of both pleural fluid cells and pleural biopsy tissue demonstrated the presence of B. anthracis capsule and cell-wall antigens. Serial serum samples demonstrated \ue02e4-fold rise in serum IgG antibody to the PA component of the anthrax toxins by an ELISA assay.The patient was able to leave the hospital on October 23 and was on oral ciprofloxacin.Table 21.5 illustrates both the clinical and microbial forensic approach and the context in which to analyze such a patient. It is likely to be common to most situations where a biocrime is suspected to have potentially affected individuals. The first set of questions is directed toward whether the person is sick: does the person have any indications of not being well and is laboratory evidence indicative of an infection? The second set of questions asks whether there is any specific and objective laboratory evidence of a particular infection. A third set of questions arise if the cause of infection was an agent on the Select Agent list(27). These questions include (i) was the infection acquired naturally or was it an intentional action that led to the infection and (ii) how did the particular individual acquire it if it was not a natural",

A positive test by today's methodologies from a 1970 serum sample from Kansas would be considered a probable false positive and warrant further investigation. Today, several viral and nucleic acid assays are available that would provide a definitive diagnosis in a short period of time(22). However, the same sample tested at the beginning of HIV testing could have been positive if the person had adult T-cell leukemia, which is caused by human T-cell leukemia virus-1 (HTLV-1), because original tests for what became known as AIDS involved whole viral lysates in which up to 30% of the HTLV-1 sera cross-reacted. Questions regarding interpretation of test results could be raised by knowledge of different presentations of the infection. For example, HTLV-1 can actually be used in the laboratory to immortalize cells. In the patient it actually increases the T-cell count, as is the nature with leukemia, instead of decreasing them, as with HIV infections. Other laboratory indicators such as hypercalcemia would now raise leukemia as a consideration.",
