This disease is one of the most important infectious diseases in cats, and it is associated with high mortality, particularly among younger cats. In this study, we isolated a wild-type FIPV HRB-17 epidemic strain from the blood sample of household pet cat exhibiting the characteristic wet-form FIP symptoms, which has been confirmed further by animal infection. Further, we developed an EvaGreen-based real-time RT-PCR assay for the accurate detection of FCoV based on the amplification of the highly conserved FIPV N gene. Then, using a combination of the real-time RT-PCR approach and a serum chemistry assay, we performed an epidemiological survey of FIPV infection in cats living in Harbin City, Northeast China. The results indicated that the EvaGreen-based real-time RT-PCR assay can be used for screening FCoV infection in the affected cats at an analytical detection limit of 8.2 \u00d7 10 1 viral genome copies/\u03bcL, but could not effectively distinguish FIPVs from FECVs. Additionally, the results of the epidemiological survey investigating feline blood samples (n = 1523) collected between July 2017 to July 2019 revealed an FIPV prevalence of approximately 12% (189/1523). Maybe, the prevalence would be less than 12% due to the real-time RT-PCR assay could not accurately differentiate FIPV and FECV. Nevertheless, it still highlighted the severity of the FIP epidemic in cats and reiterated the urgent need to develop effective anti-FIP therapeutic agents and anti-FIPV vaccines. As pet cats are household animals, risk communication and continuous region-extended surveillance cat programs are recommended.",

This disease is associated with high mortality, and this is particularly true among younger cats that are housed in breeding catteries and animal shelters [1] . This disease continues to be an elusive and frustrating problem for veterinary practitioners and cat breeders, mainly due to the challenges associated with achieving a definitive diagnosis and determining effective treatments [2] . FIP was first reported in the United States in 1963 as an important disorder in cats [3] , and its causative agent was subsequently determined to be a virus [4] . FIPV, a highly contagious coronavirus, has been clearly demonstrated to belong to the genus Alphacoronavirus and family Coronaviridae, which is a virulence biotype of the feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) [5] [6] [7] . Due to the general application of the generic name feline coronavirus (FCoV) to all serotypes and biotypes of feline coronaviruses, FECV is technically an enteric biotype of FCoV, and FIPV, the mutant form is an infectious peritonitis biotype [8] . Although FIPV is similar to FECV morphologically and serologically, it possesses a highly virulent mutation that results in the development of the fatal feline infectious peritonitis disease that presents the characteristic symptom of fibrin peritonitis-the accumulation of a large number of ascites-and a high mortality rate [8] [9] [10] [11] . Unfortunately, there are currently no effective methods to prevent or control FIPV infection. include the \"wet\" and \"dry\" forms. The wet form causes significant ascites effusion and can be effectively diagnosed following the appearance of clinical symptoms, while the dry form results in the development of granulomas within the organs of cats, making its diagnosis more challenging due to the lack of easily recognizable clinical signs [1, 12, 13] . Although FIPV is a mutant form of the feline enteric coronavirus FECV [14] , it is rarely detected in the feces of cats presenting FIP clinical symptoms [15, 16] . The clinical signs of FIP rapidly progress to a severe state, necessitating the requirement of rapid and accurate diagnostic methods. In China, type I and type II FCoV strains have been shown to co-circulate within FIP-affected cats, and the type I FCoV strains exhibit high prevalence and genetic diversity [17] . The traditional method of isolation and identification of the causative virus is not suitable for rapid clinical FIP diagnosis. Although many researchers have used RT-PCR or real-time RT-PCR to detect FCoVs in both experimentally and naturally infected cats [18] [19] [20] , it remains challenging to effectively distinguish FIPVs from FECVs. In some cases, hyperglobulinemia, which is observed in approximately 90% of the FIPinfected cats, could support the clinical diagnosis of the disease [21] .",

Sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of the EvaGreen-based realtime RT-PCR assay As shown in Fig. 3 , FIPV-positive feline blood samples were subjected to 10-fold serial dilution, total RNA extraction, and detection by the EvaGreen real-time RT-PCR assay. According to the standard curve calculations, the detection limit of the assay for FIPV in the clinical samples was 8.2 \u00d7 10 1 virus genomic copies/\u03bcL. The assay was only positive for FIPV and not for other viruses (PEDV, TGEV, PoRV, PDCoV, BVDV, BRV, BPV, BRSV, and IBDV) (Fig. 4A) , indicating a good specificity. Generally, FCoV comprises two biotypes, FECVs that inhabit the feline intestine and are associated with asymptomatic, persistent enteric infections, and FIPVs, which arise from FECVs by mutation causing feline infectious peritonitis in cats and can only be detected in the blood. Although the EvaGreen real-time RT-PCR assay developed in this study could not accurately distinguish FIPVs from FECVs (Fig. 4B) , it can be used for screening FCoV infection in the affected cats. Additionally, the intra-and inter-assay reproducibility results exhibited a < 0.5% coefficient of variation (Table 2) , indicating improved reproducibility.",

As hyperglobulinemia is observed in approximately 90% of the cats afflicted with FIP [21] , serum chemistry assays (including albumin: globulin and \u03b3-globulin) were introduced to increase the accuracy of clinical diagnosis. As shown in Table 3 , a total of 189 FIPVpositive feline blood samples were detected by the real-time RT-PCR assay, and the rate of FIPV infection in cats was approximately 12%, indicating a serious epidemic. Maybe, the prevalence would be less than 12% due to the real-time RT-PCR assay developed in this study could not accurately differentiate FIPV and FECV. Additionally, in accordance with established criteria that allow for the determination of FIP-associated hyperglobulinemia (albumin: globulin < 0.8 and \u03b3-globulin > 2.5 g/dL), we tested all feline blood samples and observed a positive rate of approximately 10%. Among these blood samples, 124 samples collected from the diseased cats suspected of wet-form feline infectious peritonitis with the clinical symptoms of abdominal distension and ascites production were all positive detected by the real-time RT-PCR assay and the serum chemistry assays, showing a 100% coincidence rate. However, the total positive rate of these 1523 blood samples detected by the serum chemistry assay was lower than that of the Eva-Green-based real-time RT-PCR assay. This may be attributed to the entry of the FCoV mutant into the blood circulation that ultimately resulted in FIPV viremia during the early stage of viral infection, as at this stage, hyperglobulinemia had not yet developed [8, 24, 25] . Thus, at this stage the FIPV infection in cats could only be detected by the realtime RT-PCR assay and not by the serum chemistry assay. However, FIP-mediated hyperglobulinemia can be detected as the disease progressed. Therefore, combining the real-time RT-PCR assay with the serum chemistry assay could be helpful to screen FCoV infection in cats at different stages of infection, while the definitive diagnosis of FIPV infection should rely on the immunohistochemical staining of viral antigen in the macrophages or monocytes of the affected cats [26] .",

            "text": "In conclusion, following the isolation of wild-type FIPV HRB-17 strain, an EvaGreen-based real-time RT-PCR assay for detecting FCoV was developed that targeted the highly conserved N gene. This is a sensitive and specific assay capable of helpfully screening FCoV infection in cats. The results of two-year epidemiological surveillance of FIPV infection in cats living in Harbin City, Northeast China, reiterated the urgent need to develop effective anti-FIP therapeutic agents and anti-FIPV vaccines. Additionally, as pet cats are household animals, risk communication and continuous region-extended FCoV surveillance programs are highly recommended. ",
