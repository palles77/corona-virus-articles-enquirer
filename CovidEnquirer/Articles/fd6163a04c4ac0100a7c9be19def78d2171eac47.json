To the best of our knowledge, the SIR model proposed by Kermack and McKendrick (1927) almost a century ago is the first (and one of the most important) attempt to describe the development of an epidemic with a deterministic ordinary differential equation (ODE) system. Over the years, numerous modifications and generalizations have been made on the original SIR model to accommodate different epidemic characteristics, among which, the SIS model and SEIR model are most widely accepted ones. It is not surprising various deterministic dynamic models have been again designed and employed to the current outbreak of COVID-19. We hereby present a brief review on some of the representative works as follows.",

In such models, the increment or decrement of different compartment at each step is a function of the configuration in the previous step (s) . Earliest examples of a DE include the well-known geometric and Fibonacci sequence, which can both be used to describe the growth of a biological population. Recently, a discrete time DE model was introduced in Yang et al. (2020) to predict the epidemic trend of COVID-19. The proposed model correctly took the infectious incubation into account. However, this model did not consider the time lag between symptoms onset and diagnosis or the medical tracking.

As a result, numerous stochastic dynamics models (see Section 3 for references) have been developed since the pioneering randomization of SIR model in . In fact, a deterministic ODE model can often be seen as the mean-field equation of the corresponding stochastic counterpart. Under certain conditions, the mean-field equation may represent the evolution of the expectation of the corresponding stochastic model. In some more generalized cases, the mean-field equation is a large scale approximation of the corresponding stochastic model, which can be seen as a process version of Law of Large Numbers. However, when the size of outbreak is not comparable to that of the total population, the approximation aforementioned may not be interpreted that the stochastic and deterministic models are close to each other by themselves, since they have both been rescaled to approximately a constant in these scenarios. See Section 3 for more details. Thus compared with deterministic models, the stochastic model may be a better choice to account for the non-negligible random nature of the COVID-19 outbreak. Furthermore, the stochastic dynamic model is also known for its expandability to incorporate individual variations , or even spatial structures Durrett (1988) , which may not be fully captured by its mean-field equations. To our knowledge, the stochastic dynamic modeling for COVID-19 is yet relatively rare comparing to its deterministic counterparts, though preliminary approaches such as statistic exponential growth models was considered in recent studies of Zhao et al. (2020) . Very recently in , an existing discrete time, stochastic model ) was employed to estimate the \"effect of travel restrictions on the spread\" of COVID-19. However, unique features of SARS-CoV-2, such as the infectious incubation and asymptomatic carriers, as well as control measures such as medical tracking, are still yet to be captured in .",

To be more specific, r H is the inverse of the average time from symptoms onset to diagnosis, r s is the inverse of the mean incubation period, while r q is the inverse of mean difference between infectious period and serial interval. Based on preliminary trials, we find there is very limited information of \u03b3 A which can be obtained from the data, and the estimate is highly influenced by the choices of prior. A possible explanation towards it is that \u03b3 A is less related to the observations. Hence, instead of estimating \u03b3 A with large uncertainty, we prefix \u03b3 A = 1/10. Sensitivity analysis is conducted on the different choices of \u03b3 A .",

Figure 5 shows the 95% confidence interval of the containment time of the outbreak for each region when T c = 10. Among the six regions in this study, Shanghai is predicted to have the earliest containment time of February 21, while the containment time in Guangdong is predicted to be the latest, around March 7. From the daily report of NHC of China, new infections in Shanghai from February 17 to February 21 are 0,0,0,1,0; and new infections in Guangdong in the same period are 6,3,1,1,6, which potentially supports our prediction.
