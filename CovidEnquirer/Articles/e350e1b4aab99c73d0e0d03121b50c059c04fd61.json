By using genomic, sequence, 21 structural and evolutionary analysis, we show that Alpha-and Beta-CoVs possess several novel families 22 of immunoglobulin (Ig) domain proteins, including ORF8 and ORF7a from SARS-related coronaviruses 23 and two protein groups from certain Alpha-CoVs. Among them, ORF8 is distinguished in being rapidly 24 evolving, possessing a unique insert and a hypervariable position among SARS-CoV-2 genomes in its 25 predicted ligand-binding groove. We also uncover many Ig proteins from several metazoan viruses 26 which are distinct in sequence and structure but share an architecture comparable to that of CoV Ig 27 domain proteins. Hence, we propose that deployment of Ig domain proteins is a widely-used strategy by 28 viruses, and SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 is a potential pathogenicity factor which evolves rapidly to counter the 29 immune response and facilitate the transmission between hosts. 30 31",

This might be due to a 178 recombination event between the SARS-related CoVs (as suggested by the similarity plot analysis) 179 and/or unusual divergence under selection. To better understand the functional difference between 180 ORF8 and ORF7a, we examined the column-wise Shannon entropy in the 20 amino acid alphabet and 181 found that the ORF8 has significantly higher mean entropy than ORF7a (ORF8: 1.09 vs ORF7a: 0.22, p< 182 10 -16 for the H0 of congruent means by t-test) ( Figure 2D ",

These viral Ig domains 219 are highly divergent; many of them are only found in certain viral groups.

ORF7a is a known member of the 151 immunoglobulin (Ig) domain superfamily and is specifically related to extracellular metazoan Ig domains 152 that are involved in adhesion, such as ICAM (35, 36). The Beta-CoV ORF8, ORF7a and the Alpha-CoV Ig 153 domains display a classic \u03b2-sandwich fold with seven \u03b2-stands and share the characteristic pattern of 154 two cysteines which form stabilizing disulfide bonds with metazoan Ig domains(Figure 2AandFigure S2) 155 (37). However, they are unified as a clade by the presence of an additional pair of conserved disulfide-156 bonding cysteines(Figure 2A). Nonetheless, there are notable structural differences between the three 157 groups of proteins. ORF8 is distinguished from ORF7a and Alpha-CoV Ig proteins by the loss of the C",

By comparing column-wise entropies in both 183 the 20 amino acid and a reduced 8-letter alphabet (where amino acids are grouped based on similar 184 side-chain chemistry), we found at least 14 positions in ORF8 which show high entropy in both alphabets 185 as compared to a single position in ORF7a (Figure 2D). This indicates that ORF8 is a fast-evolving protein 186 under selection for diversity as contrast to ORF7a. Strikingly, one of these highly variable positions, 187 which features residues with very different side characters (hydrophobic, acidic, alcoholic and proline),188 corresponding to Leu84 was also identified as the most variable position across 54 closely related 189 human SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences (38). In our structural model, this residue is positioned at the 190 domain proteins are newly acquired in subsets of Alpha-and Beta-CoVs 196 We examined the distribution of CoV Ig proteins in the context of a phylogenetic tree of both Beta-and 197 Alpha-CoVs based on their polymerase proteins (Figure 3A). Other than the two subsets of Beta-CoVs 198 and Alpha-CoVs that contain the above-described Ig domain proteins, no other CoVs contain any Ig 199 domain proteins (Figure 3A). The immediate sister-groups of the Ig-containing CoVs typically have Spike, 200 E, M and N, and one or two other uncharacterized accessory proteins which are not Ig domains to our 201 best knowledge. The Alpha-CoV ORF9/10 share a C-terminal TM helix and, along with ORF7a of the Beta-202CoVs, lack the insert in the Ig domain (Figure 2A). Hence, it is possible that this architecture represents 203 the ancestral state which was present in the common ancestor of both Alpha-CoVs and Beta-CoVs. 204Under this scenario, the protein was displaced/lost both in certain Alpha-CoVs and Beta-CoVs. 205Alternatively, ORF7a could have been exchanged between Alpha-and Beta-CoVs by a recombination 206 event. In both scenarios, ORF8 arose likely via a duplication of ORF7a in specifically the Beta-CoVs. 207Although we couldn't identify the ultimate precursors of the CoV Ig domains, they are likely to have 208 been acquired on at least two independent occasions from different sources. The CoV ORF7a-ORF8 209 families might have derived from the metazoan adhesion Ig families, and the ORF4a/b-like Ig domains of 210 Alpha-CoVs were likely acquired from adenoviral CR1 Ig domains with which they share some",

Thus, although the Ig 222 domains are not the universally preserved component of viruses, they have been acquired and selected 223 independently by a wide range of viruses. The presence of a proofreading 3'-5' exonuclease has been 224 proposed to favor the emergence of larger RNA genomes in CoVs (40). Indeed, this might have also 225 contributed to the acquisition of potential pathogenesis factors such as the Ig domains described herein 226 which are comparable to those seen in DNA viruses. 227 228 Novel CoV Ig domain proteins are potential immune modulators 229 Why have diverse viruses independently acquired the Ig domain during their evolution? First, the Ig 230 domains are major mediators of adhesive interactions in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes (37, 41, 42). 231 Thus, this domain can be used for adherence for cell to cell spread (e.g. herpesviral Ig domain proteins) 232 (43). Further, Ig domains are major building blocks of metazoan immune systems. Thus, viruses often 233 utlize this domain to disrupt immune signaling of the host. For example, in adenoviruses, the CR1 Ig 234 domain proteins have been shown to block the surface expression on infected cells of class I major 235 histocompatibility complex molecules by blocking their trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 236 to Golgi (44). This has been shown to affect the host inflammatory response and modulates the 237 presentation of viral antigens to T-cells (45). In poxvirus, the secreted Ig domain proteins function as 238 interferon receptors or decoys that bind the interferon-\u03b1/\u03b2 and disrupt signaling via the endogenous 239 host receptors (46). Further, SARS-ORF7a has been implicated in the interaction with bone marrow 240 stromal antigen 2 (BST-2), which tethers budding virions to the host cell in a broad-spectrum antiviral 241 response, to prevent the N-linked glycosylation of BST-2 thereby crippling the host response against the 242 virus (47). Given their shared evolutionary history and similar sequence and structural features, we 243 predict that the newly identified CoV Ig domain proteins, such as ORF8 of SARS-CoV-2, might similarly 244 function as immune modulators. 245 246",
