The genome was directly accessed from the stool sample of a patient in Beijing. Comparative genomics methods were used to analyze the sequence variations of 116 SARS-CoV genomes (including BJ202) available in the NCBI Gen-Bank. With the genome sequence of GZ02 as the reference, there were 41 polymorphic sites identified in BJ202 and a total of 278 polymorphic sites present in at least two of the 116 genomes. The distribution of the polymorphic sites was biased over the whole genome. Nearly half of the variations (50.4%, 140/278) clustered in the one third of the whole genome at the 3' end (1 9.0 kb-29.7 kb).",

It is interesting to find that 3 unique polymorphic sites (positions 13 804, 15 031 and 20 792) in the BJ202 genome were all composed of 2 different nucleotides. Positions 26428, 26477 and 27243, which were not unique polymorphic sites to BJ202 genome, were also composed of mixed nucleotides. Position 18379 was actually polymorphic, although it had not been discovered as such in any of the other SARS-CoV genomes. Among 14 clones sequenced, 8 were nucleotide A and 6 were nucleotide G at this position. The results verifies the polymorphic nature of the SARS-CoV genome as previously rep~rted\"~'. It also warns us that when we directly sequence the PCR products, we may fail to identify many polymorphic sites.",

To date, there have been about 18 kinds of deletions and 2 insertions ranging from 2 to 578 bp in length identified in the 116 SARS-CoV genomes including BJ202. The deletions are located in Orf9, Orfla, Orfl, OrfN and mostly in the region encoding Orf 10-11. As discussed above, the region encoding Orf10-11 also has the highest frequency of sequence variations. Of the two insertions, one (10 bp) is in Orflb of GD69 genome and the other (6 bp) in Orf9 of the LLJ2004 genome. Only early phase clinical SARS-CoVs (such as GDOl and GZ02 etc.) and animal origin SARS-CoVs (SZ3 and SZ16 etc.) are free of deletion ' ' ' I. It might mean that OrflO-11 is related to host range or tissue tropism of SARS-CoV against animals and is not a contributing factor in the infection against human beings.",

Although it was reported that the in vitro mutation rate of the SARS-CoV in Vero cell passage was negligible['81, there might be difference between the genomic sequences obtained directly from clinical samples and from isolates of the cell culture. As we know from this work, when S ARS-CoVs of different genotypes were mixed in the same sample, only the dominant genotypes would be identified by the strategy of sequencing the RT-PCR products. Moreover, when the clinical sample is subjected to cell culture, viruses with different genotypes duplicate at different rates. Those with dominant genotypes in the sample might not be the prominently duplicated ones and would be diluted by their counterparts during the cell culture. Consequently, it is difficult to effectively identify the polymorphic sites induced in vivo by sequencing the RT-PCR products of the cell culture isolates.",

However, most genomic sequences of SARS-CoV available in the NCBI CenBank were derived from viral isolates of cell cultures, which might cause some problems when we analyze the sequence variations of SARS-CoV, because sequence from the cell culture isolates might be different from the direct clinical sample. In this work, we completed the sequencing of SARS-CoV genome directly from the stool sample and analyzed the polymorphism of the SARS-CoV genome. All these would provide valuable experimental data for further research in the mechanism of SARS-CoV mutation.",
