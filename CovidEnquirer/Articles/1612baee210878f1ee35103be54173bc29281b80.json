This study was designed to examine the effects of sorafenib on macrophages, the major ontogeny of innate immunity. Materials and methods: Macrophages were derived from sorted CD14 + monocytes of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Cell viability and surface antigens were examined by trypan blue analysis. Autophagy was characterized by light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy for morphology, Western blotting for microtubule associated light chain protein 3B (LC-3B) I lipidation, and acridine orange staining for acidic component vacuoles. Soluble factors contained in culture medium and serum were measured by ELISA. Results: We found that sorafenib inhibited the viability of macrophages accompanied by morphological changes characteristic of autophagy. This autophagy-inducing effect was validated by LC3B-I lipidation and autophagosome accumulation. The surface antigen expression and the function of activated macrophages were inhibited by sorafenib, including the expression of co-stimulatory molecule CD80, phagocytosis, and the production of reactive oxygen species. The secretion of IL-10, but not IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 nor TGF-\u03b2, was reduced by sorafenib. Conclusion: Sorafenib, in addition to being a cancer targeted therapeutic agent, can induce autophagy and modulate the function of human macrophages.",

By using acridine orange staining, the formation of acidic vesicular organelles (AVO) in macrophages was demonstrated (Fig. 3) . Microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) is the corresponding mammalian homologue of yeast autophagy protein Atg8, which aggregates to autophagosome membranes when autophagy occurs. Western blotting showed an increase in the conversion of free cytosolic LC3B (LC3B-I) to phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated LC3B (LC3B-II) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4) . The increase of LC3 I lipidation persisted to at least day 7. Taken together, they suggest that sorafenib could induce autophagy in human macrophages.",

Thus, the role and function of autophagy in macrophages remain controversial and need to be clarified. It implies that pharmacological manipulation of macrophages by inducing autophagy might have the potential to benefit the disease outcome of clinical immunological disorders. However, the phenomenon of autophagy induction and the candidate agents to induce autophagy in macrophages have not been reported. In our preliminary study, sorafenib could induce autophagy in both macrophages and dendritic cells (data not shown), indicating a potential role modulating innate immunity. Furthermore, the sorafenib-induced autophagy in human macrophages could be categorized as autophagy-associated cell death.",
