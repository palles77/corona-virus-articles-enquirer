The NRG and PSF were firstly dispersed in toluene under continuous stirring. Then, maleic anhydride (MA) was added into the mixture. Effects of blend ratio and of MA content (0.5-15%, w/w) on physical properties of the polymer composite were investigated. The toluene resistance of the polymer blend was improved after adding MA and cellulose. The highest toluene resistance was achieved when using 12% cellulose. The chemical reactions of MA with polymer blend and with composite were confirmed by ATR-FTIR. The hardness of the polymer blend and composite increased as a function of PSF. In addition, their impact strength increased with increasing NRG and cellulose contents.",

After its use, NRG is generally left as garbage which is difficult to biodegrade since polyisoprene chains of NR are crosslinked either by sulphur (Riyajan et al., 2003; Hall et al., 2009) or peroxide system. The problem of NRG waste disposal is, therefore, growing as a direct result of rapid industrialization and population growth. Especially, the infectious waste from hospital and other toxic hazardous waste might cause serious environmental problem and great health risk to public. For example, the diseases like diarrhea, leptospirosis, typhoid and cholera can be transmitted through the mismanagement of waste. Moreover, the public increasingly concerns over the handling of medical waste because of the recent acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) dilemma, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, Avian influenza and those posed by other communicable diseases such as hepatitis B.",

The pyrolysis of the rubber waste by using Y-zeolite as catalyst gave mainly of limonene and oligomers of polyisoprene.

In addition, the rubber waste was blended with virgin synthetic rubber and NR to improve the polymer processing. However, the blend of NRG waste with polystyrene foam (PSF) waste was not found in literature. The reports concerned only about the use of PSF waste in polymeric flocculants (Wies\u0142aw et al., 2005) , ion adsorption (Long et al., 2010) , polymer mortar panels and electrolyte (Bhutta et al., 2011) . The polymeric flocculant, i.e., poly(styrene sulphonate) acid, was obtained from PSF waste and virgin PS during the sulphonation process using H 2 SO 4 as sulphonating agent and Ag 2 SO 4 as catalyst. The effectiveness of the flocculation depended on the number of sulphonic groups per monomer unit and its molecular weight. In addition, PSF waste blended with poly(methyl methacrylate) and reinforced with steel fiber was applied in polymer mortar panels (PMPs) (Bhutta et al., 2011) . Due to their high ductile and load-bearing capacity, PMPs could replace a commercial polymer-impregnated mortar panel in practical applications.",

It was believed that the high NRG content whose molecules were still partially crosslinked with sulphur was responsible for the high gel content. As expected, the gel contents of all NRG/PSF blends strongly increased by adding cellulose fiber as shown in Fig. 3(b) . The gel contents of polymer composites containing 3, 5 and 12% were 58, 60 and 63%, respectively.

When adding 5% (w/w) in polymer composite (Fig. 5(b) ), the poor adhesion between cellulose and polymer matrix was observed. But when MA increased from 5 to 10 or 15% (w/w) (Fig. 5(c) and (d)), the strong adhesion bonding between the polymer matrix and the cellulose fiber appeared due to more occurrences in chemical reaction between polymer matrix and hydroxyl group from cellulose which may reduce the damage of fracture. This result suggested that the adhesion between the matrix and cellulose fiber was very good. Accordingly, the interfacial strength was improved when MA was over 5% (w/w).",

After adding MA, the strong adhesion or chemical bond between cellulose fiber and polymer matrix occurred in Fig. 5 (f) which would affected the mechanical strength of the polymer composite. It was observed that the tensile strength of PSF was 2 MPa and that of polymer blend without cellulose in Fig. 6 (a) decreased from 3.4, 1.4 to 0.7 MPa when NRG/PSF were 30/70, 50/50 and 70/30, respectively. After addition of 3, 5 and 12% cellulose in the 30/70 NRG/PSF, the tensile strength of the polymer composites in Fig. 6 (b)-(d) increased from 5.2, 5.8 to 6.2 MPa, respectively. The results agreed well with those of NR filled cellulose previously reported (Bras, 2010) . The drop in the tensile properties of the polymer composites when increasing NRG content was reasonably due to poor interaction between cellulose and the NRG/PSF matrix. Moreover, the poor dispersion and/or agglomeration of the filler in the matrix led to the in-homogeneity of phase morphology which became the dominant process in the mixing. This effect was more pronounced with increasing filler content.",

At 50/50 NRG/PSF, the impact strength values of the polymer composites with 0, 3, 5 and 12% cellulose were 7, 12, 21 and 23.5 J/m 2 , respectively. The reinforcement might be because a polymer chain could interact with several units of the fibers. If this chain breaks due to the impact energy, the load is transferred to many other chains providing the increase in impact strength of the material (Megiatto et al., 2010) .",

Their mechanical properties were better than those of PSF due to the chemical reaction between PSF/cellulose and MA which were confirmed by gel content and ATR-FTIR. The highest tensile strength of sample was found in 30/70 NRG/PSF blended with 10% MA and 12% cellulose. This observation was supported by SEM, toluene resistance, impact strength and hardness. The polymer composite would potentially be used in artificial wood, artificial bone, pot and picture frame.",
