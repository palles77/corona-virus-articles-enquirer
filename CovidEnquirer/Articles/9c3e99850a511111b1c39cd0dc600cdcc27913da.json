An empirical analysis was applied to inbound tourists to Taiwan. The results shed light on diversification in tourism market and offer tourism authorities and policy-makers explicit guidelines for risk management in the destination planning process. Specifically, using optimal mixes with various return/risk options can facilitate a more stable pattern of arrivals from foreign countries. To achieve the Doubling Tourist Arrivals Plan, introduced by the Taiwanese government in 2002, the tourism authorities should take the high-return/ high-risk option and shift available resources to Japan. More policy implications are provided to guide tourism authorities and policy makers. r",

It becomes an important source of business activities, contributing to income and generating employment. The tourism industry, however, shows considerable instability in demand (Sinclair, 1999) . It is desirable that tourist arrivals keep increasing and contributing to the growth of income and employment. Decreased arrivals can adversely affect a local economy, with an especially substantial effect if one of the primary tourist markets sees a sharp decrease in international arrivals. Accordingly, efforts should be made to alleviate the level of fluctuation in tourist demand. Thus, the goal of volatility management for tourist arrivals from different source countries needs to be incorporated into the tourism planning process. A destination country should attract a distribution of nationalities, so the total level of volatility in tourist arrivals is minimized.",

The instability pattern of arrivals can differ by nationality because tourists from each country are sensitive in different ways to changes in these variables (Board, Sinclair, & Sutcliffe, 1987) . For economic, political, and social changes, different tourist nationalities have different levels of volatility, or risk, as measured by the variations in demand. Policy makers in charge of the long-term development of the tourism industry should make good use of available resources to attract a distribution of tourists by nationalities to minimize the volatility of tourism demand.",

            "text": "Minimizing instability in tourism demand is quite similar to stock investors trying to choose optimal portfolios that minimize return volatility. Mutual fund managers decide on optimal stock mixes that minimize return volatility (risk), based on a financial portfolio theory. In general, the portfolio theory helps investors choose the proportion of their total investment budgets to allocate to different securities. Tourism policy makers may be able to borrow the portfolio theory for deciding optimal market mixes. In developing a financial portfolio theory, Markowitz (1952 Markowitz ( , 1959 , the 1990 Nobel Laureate in economics, suggested that particular combinations of securities could reduce the overall level of instability of returns, because each security has a unique level of risk and expected return. He defines risk as a variation in return in the theory. Simply put, the portfolio theory recommends that investors construct security mixes that have minimum risks for any level of return, or maximum return for any level of risk. In the contemporary finance world, the portfolio theory has become the most popular tool to build risk-minimizing portfolios of securities, given the expected returns of the individual securities. Sets of these optimal portfolios comprise an efficient frontier, which specifies the maximum return for any risk level from the possible investments ( Fig. 1) . Among the optimal points on the efficient frontier, some investors may prefer lower-risk, lowerreturn portfolios; others, medium-risk and medium-return portfolios. Still others may choose high-risk, high-return portfolios. Given the knowledge of the investor's return/ risk trade-off and estimates of the expected return and risk associated with each security, portfolio analysis can determine optimal mixes of securities for the investor (Board et al., 1987) .",

Similar to stock markets, tourist markets have different levels of return (arrivals) and risk (instability). Even though return and risk in tourism cannot be defined in exactly the same way as in the finance field, O'Leary (2002, 2004) provide a hint about an application of financerelated idea to tourism research. Indeed, Jang et al. (2002 Jang et al. ( , 2004 explained how return and risk concepts in finance can be applied to tourism. What they actually employed in their study includes profitability measured with mean travel expenditure, risk gauged with the standard deviation, and coefficient of variance (CV) using both mean and standard deviation. Along the similar line, we use the number of arrivals as the tourist market return and the standard deviation of a mean arrival as volatility, or market risk, in this study. As in selecting an optimal combination of securities, portfolio analysis can help determine the optimal tourist market mixes to minimize variance in demand.",

Earlier studies using the portfolio theory for tourism have primarily dealt with specific objectives such as bed-night demand optimization and seasonality minimization. However, to make wide use of the theory in the tourism industry, it is critical to apply it using readily available data. In that respect, this study uses easily obtained tourist arrival data. Also, the uniqueness of this research among the few financial portfolio studies in tourism is that it attempts to segment foreign tourists by nationality, as often is done in the industry, and to propose an efficient frontier to tourism authorities to optimize tourist arrivals, so that they can use the frontier as a longterm guide for development and resource allocation. That is, this research provides more practical and realistic solutions to achieve destination policy-makers' objectives of stable foreign tourism demand on a long-term basis.",

            "text": "Traditionally, Taiwan has been known as an exportsoriented economy (Ghartey, 1993; Jin, 1995) , and the tourism sector has never been considered a leading industry in Taiwan. Nonetheless, Kim, Chen, and Jang (2006) have showed that the tourism industry contributed to the Taiwanese economy. According to annual statistics from the Tourism Bureau of Taiwan (2003 Taiwan ( , 2004 , tourism revenues accounted for 4.39% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 1996 and 5.31% of the GDP in 2001. These figures exceeded the contribution of agriculture to the GDP in each year, showing that tourism has become a major industry in Taiwan. Kim et al. (2006) further demonstrated that tourism expansion in Taiwan has a long-run equilibrium relationship with economic growth, and moreover, tourism expansion and economic growth reinforce each other. In other words, tourism development strengthens the Taiwanese economy, and an expanding economy also enhances the tourism industry. These empirical findings offered important guidance for government and private tourism policy makers and authorities in Taiwan. Because of the long-running equilibrium relationship and the twoway causality between tourism and economic development, both the tourism segment and other major industries require attention to stimulate both the tourism sector and the overall economy. The Tourism Bureau of Taiwan (2005, p.29) reports that ''tourism activities generated a total of 279,147 full-time jobs in the food and beverage, transportation, retail trade, and lodging service industries in 2000.''",

If growth rates had been used, the growth rate of Singapore (10.75%) would have to be treated as higher return than the growth rate of Japan (4.08%), which would indicate that Singapore is a much more important market than Japan, despite its small market size. In reality, however, Japan, which generates more arrivals (return), should be more important. In other words, the optimal solutions are decided purely by the variance-covariance combination of growth rate, assuming that the number of arrivals from countries is almost the same. Thus, using the growth rates may lead to erroneous solutions for Taiwan. In addition, the number of arrivals in tourism can be understood as comparable to return on investment (ROI) in the stock market, even though arrivals represent the static size of demand and ROI means changes in stock price. Tourist arrivals coming from a source countryfrom a destination perspective-are the number of tourists that a destination gains from that market (the country), whereas ROI from a stock is what an investor earns from the stock investment. It is reasonable to consider arrivals in tourism as analogous to the ROI in the stock market.

An efficient portfolio will offer the maximum expected arrivals for varying levels of risk and offer minimum risk for varying levels of expected arrivals (see Fig. 1 ). To find all possible efficient portfolios, we must calculate the expected arrivals and variance of each market and the pair-wise covariances between markets. After computing the expected arrivals and the variance/covariance matrix, the problem is reduced to the optimization of a quadratic function subject to constraints.

That is, in order to realize point I, Taiwanese tourism authorities need to focus on Japan, the US, Thailand, the Philippines, and Europe. At points J and K, the Japanese market continues growing but the USA and Europe lose their shares. At point L, the greatest mean arrival (647) is achieved, but instability (81.03) is also maximized. To achieve point L, Taiwan should focus on the Japanese market (58.4%), maintain efforts on Thailand (8.6%) and the Philippines (8.2%), but minimize weights for the rest of the countries. Overall, the extreme risktaking policy makers would pursue the point L, by seeking the suggested market shares at L, so that they can reach the most arrivals possible. On the other hand, extreme risk-avoiders will seek point C to reach the lowest instability level. Arrival-instability ratio (AIR) was then calculated as mean yearly market arrival divided by standard deviation to measure the relative arrival level after adjusting for instability. The ratio should provide better information for comparison because it considers arrivals and instability at the same time. The points F, G, H, and I were identified as the highest level, all above 8.7 in the AIR. Thus, as optimal foreign tourist arrivals, selecting one point between F and I, depending on the destination's demand-instability preference, is appropriate. If the policy makers, however, have a strong preference for the high-arrival/high-instability option, they can choose point L or for the low-arrival/ low-instability mix, they can choose point C.",

Total arrivals in 2005 were 3.378 million, so the expected total market arrivals from foreign countries were estimated by proportional equations. For example, at point I (mean arrivals: 500), total arrivals would be 3.643 million ( \u00bc 3.378 \u00c2 500/463.7). In other words, the maximum expected arrivals at point L under the current upper and lower limits would be 4.713 million, which is slightly lower than the Taiwanese Doubling Tourist Arrivals Plan of five million.",

Any portfolio mix that lies on the frontier has the least instability, defined as the least variation in arrivals. Any points in the interior of the frontier line are not efficient, because points on the frontier guarantee more arrivals at the same level of instability or less instability at the same level of arrivals. Thus, policy makers should choose any points that fall along the frontier by allocating their available resources, as suggested by the optimal mix solutions of Table 4 . As explained earlier, the optimal mix depends on an individual's return/risk (arrival/ instability, in this study) trade-off preference. Thus, the points between F and I are highly recommended as results of the AIR, which represent relatively high levels of arrivals after adjusting for instability.",

As explained in the previous section, there could be a set of optimal market mix solutions. Taiwan tourism authorities can choose one of the obtained solutions, according to their return (arrivals)/risk (instability) preference. If they pursue a high-return/high-risk solution, they have to focus their efforts on the Japanese market. In addition, they need to increase the visitors from Thailand and the Philippines to mitigate the volatility of the Japanese market. To achieve the Doubling Tourist Arrivals Plan, Taiwan should take the high-return/high-risk option and shift available resources to Japan. The market shares of recent years shown in Table 1 indicate a rapid rise in the Japanese market, as suggested, but the share patterns of Thailand and the Philippines are not in the same direction that the optimal mixes demonstrate in Table 4 .",

            "text": "As noted earlier, international tourism is an important part of generating income and employment in many countries. However, the instability of tourism demand has been criticized as a critical drawback, leading to adverse effects on a local economy. Efforts have been directed toward increasing the diversification of tourism products, but studies as to how to mitigate the instability level have been rare. This study stresses volatility management for foreign tourist arrivals and illustrates how to achieve quantitative solutions using financial portfolio analysis. Even though the portfolio theory was not developed for the tourism market, portfolio mixes can give useful information to travel destinations, providing a better picture and understanding of each tourist market to help policy makers effectively devise strategies for longterm tourism development and also help policy makers focus on the concept of risk management. After market mixes options are estimated, it is important to compare the actual mix of tourists to the optimal mix, which will allow consideration of current standing and future direction. This may provide guidelines for a marketing program aimed at influencing market distribution and, ultimately, making tourism a stable industry. The suggested mix of each market may serve as a guide or stimulus to policy makers to explore significant shifts in resources but probably cannot be implemented without modification. One such modification could involve specifying upper and lower limits for the weights of markets. The limits used in this study are only one example. Thus, they can be adjusted for policy-makers' preferences.",

First, unlike stock markets, it is not possible to instantly adjust the market composition of tourist arrivals. Thus, the optimal market mix solutions can be used as a long-term objective, but not as a shortterm goal. Second, tourist arrivals often follow a trend over time, but Markowitz's portfolio theory is not designed to address any specific trend. Instead, the theory simply considers interrelationships among markets. Thus, the solutions on the frontier do not reflect trends that may be the reasons behind arrival patterns. That is why it is important to consistently monitor the frontier of the same destination by conducting analyses on a regular basis.",

Also, locating actual portfolios and comparing them with the efficient frontier to see how close the actual portfolios have been to optimal solutions would be another meaningful future study.
