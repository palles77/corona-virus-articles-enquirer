We define three kinds of event relationships: temporal, content dependence, and event reference, that can be used to identify to what extent a component event is dependent on another in the evolution of a target event (i.e., the query event). The search results are organized as a temporal event map (TEM) that serves as the whole picture about an event's evolution or development by showing the dependence relationships among events. Based on the event relationships in the TEM, we further propose a method to measure the degrees of importance of events, so as to discover the important component events for a query, as well as the several algebraic operators involved in the TEM, that allow users to view the target event. Experiments conducted on a real data set show that our method outperforms the baseline method Event Evolution Graph (EEG), and it can help discover certain new relationships missed by previous methods and even by human annotators. \u2729 This article is an extension version of a conference proceeding published in Cai et al. (2013) [1], and some notations, definitions, formulations, descriptions, figures, tables and so on are reused to make new contributions smoothly in this article. The new contributions of this article are (1) new methods of event ranking and temporal event map construction; (2) algebraic operations of the event map; (3) more examples, case studies, and metrics in experiments; and (4) more comprehensive literature review and descriptions.",

Indeed, readers are often interested in the whole picture of an event's evolution or development along a timeline. This calls for modeling the dependence relationships among component events and identifying which component events play important roles in the evolution of the entire event. Unfortunately, most current news web sites do not facilitate users quest to discover relevant news articles, and readers may need to go through multiple news articles in order to understand the interrelationships among component events and the importance of each to the development of the overall event. This is a time consuming job for a reader, given the huge amount of news articles available online. Therefore, it is necessary to provide an effective way for users to efficiently search for events in which they are interested, and to organize their search results in an easily understandable manner syntactically, so that users can obtain an overall picture of events easily and meaningfully from a semantic perspective.",

Using two factors alone is inadequate for identifying dependence relationships among component events for the purpose of forming an overall picture of a major event's evolution. For example, the event ''Toyota recall due to safety problems from 2009 to 2010'' shares little similar content with the events ''NHTSA conducts investigations for Toyota recall'' and ''US congressional hearings hold for Toyota recall''. It is obvious that the first event has a strong affect on the latter two events, as it actually caused them to happen. Unfortunately, previous work in this field has not analyzed event relationships and cannot discover the dependence relationships between any two events that do not share enough similar content. As a result, the main picture of a ''big event'' that has been discovered by previous scholarship is often incomplete, and significant relationships are missing. Furthermore, as there is no facility in this work for measuring event importance, it does not identify milestone events that are significant for most users to know.",

However, there may be some keywords (in the two events) that are related/dependent but not identical. For example, ''hospital'' and ''doctor'' are dependent, but previous methods have treated them as having no relationship. To avoid this limitation, we adopt mutual information criteria to measure the dependence between two terms (features), and we then aggregate all mutual information among features in events to measure the degree of content dependence between the events. This process is called content dependence (CD) analysis, and the dependence relationship that is discovered based on the dependence features of two events is called the content dependence relationship.",

For instance, some news articles about the event ''Toyota recall due to safety problems from 2009 to 2010'' refer to the event ''NHTSA conduct investigations for Toyota recall''. Motivated by this phenomena, we explore event reference (ER) analysis to detect whether there is an inter-event relationship specified by authors. The relationship between two events discovered by ER analysis is considered an event reference (ER) relationship, which has not been explored by previous research.",

In daily life, a tremendous number of events happen every day, e.g., disasters, diseases, military conflicts, business events and so on. These events are reported in the form of news every day, and they are called news events. People are becoming more and more accustomed to reading their news online to keep up with current events. It is important to handle the news events that introduce emerging stories to the world. A composite/complex news event may consist of several component events, i.e., episodes. The news events usually are reported in the form of unstructured text documents. Because major news events are often emergent and complex, defining the pattern of news events is difficult and time consuming. Different from the structured events found in current Complex Event Processing, our proposed work focuses on mining the event relationships based on unstructured text documents, so as to construct the temporal event map that shows the event evolution.",

[16] focuses on something called TISE, which is a temporal search engine supporting temporal content retrieval for Web pages. TISE supports Web page searches with temporal information embedded in Web pages, and the search relies on a unified temporal ontology of Web pages. However, TISE can neither handle event searches nor discover event relationships or measure event importance. Topic detecting and tracking (TDT) is currently a hot research topic that is also related to our work. Given a stream of constantly generated new documents, TDT groups documents of the same topic together and tracks the topic to find all subsequent documents. There are several techniques for detecting news topics and tracking news articles toward a new topic. For instance, Allan et al. [17] define temporal summaries of news stories and propose methods for constructing temporal summaries. Smith [18] explores detecting and browsing events from unstructured text/s. Chieu et al. [19] present a framework and a system that extracts events according to a query from a set of documents and organize events along a timeline. Some techniques are proposed to detect particular kinds of events. For example, Fisichella et al. [20] propose an approach combining aspects from different feature-based event detection methods to detect public health events in an unsupervised manner. Modeling and discovering relationships among events is generally out of the scope of current TDT research. Mei and Zhai [21, 22] study a particular task of discovering and summarizing the evolutionary patterns of themes in a text stream. A theme in an interval may be part of an event or a combination of several events that occur in the interval. Their work does not however capture the interrelationships of major events. Fung et al. [23] propose an algorithm called Time Driven Documents-partition to construct an event hierarchy in a text corpus based on a user query, but their work catches only the subsumption relationships between events, instead of the dependence relationships that may be more interesting to users. Shahaf et al. [8] try to provide a structured way to connect documents (i.e., find a coherent chain linking various documents) for users to navigate.",

They consider temporal relationships instead of evolution relationships. Although the temporal relationships can help organize event episodes in sequences according to their temporal order, they do not necessarily reflect the evolutionary paths between events. Some extended examples of these methods are presented in [7] and [29] . Yang et al. [6] define the event evolution relationships between events and propose a way to measure these event evolution relationships. In their work, identifying an event evolution relationship between two events depends on the similarity of the features of the two events. Based on a small number of documents and events about a given news topic, Nallapati et al. [30] define the concept of event threading. Their definition of event threading is based on the content similarity relationship from a previous event to a later event. The event threading is organized as a tree structure rather than a graph. In order to identify event threading, they employ a simple similarity measure between documents to cluster documents into events, and they use the average document similarity to estimate the content dependencies between events. Feng and Allan [4] extend Nallapati's work to passage threading by breaking each news story into finer granules, and they propose a model called incident threading in [5] . Table 1 shows the comparison of our methods and previous methods regarding different dependencies.",

However, two events may have some keywords that are dependent but not identical, which causes the previous work done in this field to be inadequate in measuring how relevant the two events are. There are several semantic techniques that are relevant to the analysis of content semantic relations, such as ontologies. However, to use ontologies for semantic analysis, we need to obtain high quality ontologies relevant to the event domain. One major way to build up high quality ontologies depends on domain experts efforts, and it is a time consuming job. Thus, there are not many high quality ontologies for various domains, and events are related to various domains. Although there are some automated ways to build up ontologies, their computation cost is relatively high, and the quality of the ontologies may not be good enough for event content dependence analysis.",

Our method's F \u2212 measure score is also approximately 0.8, since it is a combination of Precision and Recall. Note that CDM outperforms EEG slightly on all metrics, and the reason is that using mutual information to measure feature dependence is better than only matching keyword similarity (as was done in most previous research). ERM outperforms EEG and CDM on all three metrics. This indicates that using event reference analysis (i.e., ERM) to identify event dependence relationships is more effective than using content dependence relationship analysis (i.e., CDM) and content similarity analysis (i.e., EEG). Also, it is quite interesting to see that the Recall of CDM is greater than that of ERM, while both of them are smaller than those of our method. This means that the event dependence relationships identified by CDM and ERM are indeed different and complementary. Our method is a combination of CDM and ERM, and it has the strength of both methods. In other words, taking both content dependence and event reference analysis into consideration in identifying event dependence relationships produces better results than taking just one of these. For event ranking, Table 3 shows that our method obtains a higher value of NDCG than the ERM and CDM methods. In particular, the NDCG of our method is 0.9662 while that of ERM and CDM is 0.8923 and 0.8687, respectively. This means that combining both content dependence relationships and event reference relationships to rank events can also achieve a better result.

In Fig. 7 , the size of each node represents the importance of an event, and width of each line represents the strength degree of a dependence relationship between events. According to the result, our method misses only 7 relationships, while the EEG method misses 17 relationships. Table 5 shows the statistics of the event relationships discovered by our method and EEG, vis-a-vis the results of the human annotators for this case. As shown, our method finds more, and miss less, correct inter-event relationships. In addition, our method discovers not only the inter-event relationships but also the strength degrees of such relationships. Comparing the relationships missed by our method and EEG, we find that most missing relationships (6 out of 7) are also missing in EEG, and these relationships are: from event 5 to event 1, from event 5 to event 12, from event 2 to event 12, from event 4 to event 6, from event 6 to event 1, and from event 10 to event 8. Only one relationship missed by our method was found by EEG, which is from event 8 to event 11. In contrast, most relationships missed by EEG were discovered by our method. For instance, EEG did not find any relationships for events 1, 4, 5 and 10, while our method found their dependence relationships with other events. We find that most of the relationships missed by EEG were discovered by our method due to event reference analysis rather than content dependence analysis. This means that content dependence analysis and event reference analysis should work together in identifying event dependence relationships. More interestingly, our method found some new relationships that were not found by EEG or by the human annotators. Such new relationships are confirmed and approved later by the annotators as meaningful ones (e.g., the relationship from event 5 to event 2 and the relationship from event 3 to event 2). For the relationship between events 5 and 2, note that event 5 is about the outbreak of SARS and infections that can cause more new SARS cases to appear and make the disease more serious. For the relationship between events 3 and 2, note that event 2 is about the number of SARS cases reported by hospitals, and when SARS cases increased and the disease spread, more and more patients contracted the disease and called for hospital care. According to the annotators, the main reason they missed these relationships was that there were just too many relationships among the events in the data set, which inevitably caused them to miss some during their annotation processes.",

The two sets of event rankings are similar. 5 For events 2, 9 and 10, our method regards these as important because they have many relationships with (much effect on) others, while events 1, 4, 6, 7 and 12 are not so important because they have fewer relationships with (less effect on) others. This shows that ranking events by event relationships is a reasonable and effective approach. Such an event ranking facility can help users find the ''milestone'' component events easily. Exceptions, such as event 8 and event 7, have lower ranks because our method also missed 7 relationships (such as the one from event 8 to event 11 and so on.) This further confirms the necessity and importance to find out 5 The seminal event 5 and ending event 11 are ranked with the highest score in our method for all target events, and this is also in line with the human annotators. more dependence relationships in order to facilitate better event search and ranking. Event 8 is an example of an exception, and as mentioned earlier, our method misses 7 relationships, including the one from event 8 to event 11 and the one from event 10 to event 8.

The search results are represented by a temporal event map (TEM), which is a global picture showing the dependence relationships between events, thereby illustrating the evolution or development of an event along the timeline. A method to measure degrees of event importance has been proposed for discovering the important component (milestone) events for a given query. Experiments on a real data set show that our proposed method outperforms the baseline methods, and it can discover relationships that are missed by previous methods and sometimes even by human annotators.",

How to automatically choose the ''right'' number of core features for event reference analysis of different data sets is an open issue for further study. Another potential extension is to implement a visualization tool with a sophisticated user interface based on our current method. Also, we plan to investigate personalized temporal event searches, as different users may have their own preferences and interests about different kinds of component events. This sort of event search may be used to recommend news articles to a user based on his/her current knowledge of his/her interested event. Furthermore, it is also possible to exploit the temporal event map in some domain-specific applications, including first story detection [37] and financial news analysis [38] . ",
