In this study, recombinant baculoviruses, rBac-NF and rBac-NG, were generated to express F and G proteins of NiV. The expressions of recombinant G (rNG) and F (rNF) proteins in rBac-NF and rBac-NG-infected cells were confirmed by Western blot. Both rNG and rNF showed sensitive and specific antigenic reaction to rabbit serum anti-Nipah virus in indirect immunofluorescence detection and indirect ELISA. Immunization with rBac-NF and rBac-NG-infected insect cells elicited G and F protein-specific antibody responses in mice. Furthermore, the G and F protein-specific antibodies could neutralize the infectivity of the VSV\u0394G*F/G, the NiV F and G envelope glycoproteins of pseudotype recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus expressing green fluorescence protein. The results demonstrated that the F and G proteins expressed by the recombinant baculoviruses could be safe diagnostic antigens for the surveillance and monitoring of NiV and could also be promising subunit vaccines for the prevention of NiV.",

Initially, the illness in pigs was attributed to Classical Swine Fever. The mortality in humans was attributed to Japanese encephalitis (JE), a mosquito-borne RNA virus. However, the vaccination for Swine Fever and JE and efforts to control mosquitoes failed to arrest the epidemic. By December 1998, the outbreak had spread to Sungai Nipah village and Bukit Pelandok (the biggest pig-farming region) in the state of Negeri Sembilan. A month later, a group of 11 human cases of febrile encephalitis illness along with one case of death was reported among abattoir workers in Singapore who had handled pigs from the outbreak regions in Malaysia [2] . In March 1999, a novel paramyxovirus, Nipah virus (NiV), was isolated from the cerebro-spinal fluid of a patient from Sungai Nipah village, who was subsequently identified with encephalitis; this virus was the aetiological agent that was responsible for the outbreak. By December 1999, a total of 283 human cases of acute febrile encephalitis including 109 cases of death associated with the outbreak were reported, with a mortality rate of 38.5 % [3] .",

Therefore, fruit bats were suspected to be the natural reservoir of NiV [6] . In 2002, NiV was isolated from the urine samples and swabs from partially eaten fruits by flying foxes of Pteropus genus. The world distribution of flying foxes extends from the western Indian Ocean islands through Southeast Asia, including southwest Pacific Islands, and Australia excluding Tasmania [7] . In 2001 and 2002, serological evidences indicated that the neutralizing antibody to NiV was found in fruit bats from Bangladesh, the northern India, and Cambodia. In 2004, there was an outbreak of NiV in Bangladesh, in which 30 people were infected and 18 were killed.",

The attachment glycoprotein is associated with virion attachment to the cellular receptor and has been designated as the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein (HN), the hemagglutinin protein (H), or the G protein, which has neither hemagglutinating nor neuraminidase activities, whereas, the F glycoprotein induces fusion between the viral and cellular membranes. G and F acted in concert to bring about fusion. The existing studies showed that only coexpression of the attachment glycoprotein and fusion glycoprotein of Newcastle disease virus [12] , Human parainfluenza virus [13] , and Measles virus [14] induced fusion. In addition, only coexpression of the G protein and F protein of NiV also induced fusion. The binding of G protein and the cellular receptor induced a series of configuration changes in the F protein, which further induced the fusion of viral envelope and cellular membrane or the fusion of cellular membranes, resulting in the entry of the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm and the formation of typical syncytia. For most paramyxoviruses, the heterotypic fusion activity that has been measured is considerably lower than a virus's homotypic fusion activity. However, the NiV and HeV envelope glycoproteins could efficiently mediate fusion in heterologous envelope combinations with each other. The existing studies confirmed that the G and F proteins of NiV could mediate high-level fusion of BSC-1 cells, U373 cells, BHK 21 cells, and cat embryonic cells [15] . This study demonstrated that the F protein precursor F0 expressed by the recombinant baculovirus could be cleaved to produce F1 subunit and F2 subunit similar to natural F proteins. In this study, the recombinant baculoviruses rBac-NiV-F and rBac-NiV-G coinfected sf9 insect cells that induced quiet syncytia, which suggested that the recombinant F and G proteins possess partial biological activity.",
