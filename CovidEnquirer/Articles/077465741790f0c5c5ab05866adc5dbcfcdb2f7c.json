Therefore, this edition can be considered a completely new publication, to which, besides the author, 10 prominent research workers in the field of feline diseases have contributed. Each part of the book is followed by a comprehensive list of references; the many photographs are very illustrative. In the introduction, a detailed description is given of the place of the cat in the zoological system and of the domestication of the cat, followed by a survey of the various domestic cat races and their main features.",

The problem of the control of neonatal diarrhea by immunization procedures has been amply discussed by L.L. Myers, M.R. Wilson, I. McCallum and G. Khachatourians and the clinical treatment by O.R. Radostits as well. It seems that considerable progress has been made, for instance by the use of the K88 antigen as an immunogen. The antibody thus produced should be protective by prevention of the adhesion of enteropathogenic coli strains to the epithelial cell. Also bacterins and E. coil vaccines of minicell cultures and immunoglobulin preparations have been successfully used.",
