Compounds 3a and 3d in which the quaternary nitrogen atoms are separated by the C5H10 and C9H18 aliphatic chain, exhibited the highest efficiency as an agent inhibiting the reproduction of the influenza virus A(H1N1)pdm09. The cytotoxicity data of compounds 3 and 4 revealed their moderate activity against malignant cell lines; compound 3f had the highest activity for the CEM-13 cells. These results show close agreement with the data of independent studies on toxicity of these compounds, in particular that the toxicity of compounds strongly depends on spacer length.",

            "text": "Functionalization of natural compounds exhibiting native biological activity is one of the most efficient approaches for the synthesis of biologically active substances in medicinal chemistry. Symmetric nitrogen-containing molecules bearing at least two natural fragments linked with a spacer have become widely used for medical applications. The type of natural fragments is rather diverse: alkaloids, steroids, mono-or diterpenes, etc. Thus, dimeric and trimeric compounds, which exhibited a strongly pronounced antitumor effect, have been synthesized based on artemizinine. 1 Hybrids of steroid framework have been studied as analogues of juvenile hormones. 2 The strategy of bivalent ligands has been successfully implemented for searching for acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. The alkaloids tarcine 3 and galanthamine 4 were used as starting natural compounds, and their bis-derivatives appeared promising agents for treating Alzheimer's disease. There are some examples in the literature of dimeric molecules acquiring properties that are completely different from those of the precursor molecules. 5 Indeed, symmetric derivatives of the alkaloid camphotecine enhance solubility of a compound, reduce its toxicity, and increase its specific interaction with an enzyme. 6 Meanwhile, symmetric compounds containing two quaternary nitrogen atoms separated by different size spacers are generally known to exhibit high biological activity. 7 These agents have been most widely used as myorelaxants. 8, 9 Furthermore, many of them have been tested as antimalarial drugs. 10, 11 However, very few examples of synthesis of dimeric compounds based on natural molecules linked to quaternary nitrogen atoms via spacers have been published. For example, ammonium derivatives of the diterpenoids steviol and isosteviol exhibited antimicrobial properties 12 and dimeric steroids can acts as a catalyst 13 Hence, synthesis of compounds containing several natural fragments linked with spacer groups, involving the insertion of two quaternized nitrogen atoms, is a promising trend in chemistry of biologically active substances.",

Its mechanism of activity was supposed to be similar to that of rimantadine. Several attempts were undertaken to optimize the molecule of amantadine and to overcome the virus' resistance. [16] [17] [18] [19] In particular, adamantane-based spiroderivatives have been tested against influenza virus and demonstrated high inhibiting activity. In this regard, activity of spiro[piperidine-2,2 0 -adamantane] appeared comparable with that of amantadine while other 2-alkyl-2-aminoadamantanes appeared less effective. Moreover, none of them demonstrated an activity against influenza B virus thus suggesting the specific target for their activity that is absent in influenza B viruses.",

It was previously shown that (1R,2R,3R,5S)-3-pinanamine appeared more potent than amantadine in inhibiting amantadine-susceptible influenza virus. 22 Moreover, although at relative high concentrations, some of pinanamine derivatives were able to inhibit amantadine-resistant mutant bearing S31N mutation, the fact suggesting the principal possibility to overcome the resistance of influenza viruses to adamantane derivatives using cage scaffold-based compounds. The target of adamantane derivatives is virus-specific proton channel M2. Initially, these compounds were supposed to interact with the internal channel of M2 protein. In general, in their protonated form these compounds are considered to block the tetrameric M2 ion channel pore, formed by its transmembrane domain and hence, its proton transport function. Amino acid substitutions conferring rimantadine-resistant phenotype are localized at positions 27, 28, 31 and 34. In 2008-2009, NMR solution revealed another adamantane-binding site around the amino acid position 44. 23, 24 This study suggested that rimantadine bound to the outside of the M2 protein helices facing the lipid bilayer with residue D44 participating in a hydrogen bond interaction with rimantadine. It was postulated that the high-affinity binding site corresponded to the M2 ion channel pore; whereas the secondary, low-affinity binding site could be attributed to the lipid face of the pore. These two studies proposed different sites of and different models for the interaction of adamantane drugs with M2 first, anion channel pore-binding model and, second, the lipid-facing binding model. 25 In the later case, the drug was shown to inhibit the channel from outside by an allosteric mechanism by stabilizing its closed state.",

On the other hand, when developing the compounds interacting with amino acids and/or lipid bilayer from outside the channel, one may use a much wider set of side substituents.

Cross peaks are also observed between Me-10 and H-4c, 5c, as well as between Me-9 and H-2c, which enables the unambiguous assignment of their signals (Fig. 1 ). It follows from the calculated data that the E configuration is 5 kcal/mol more energetically profitable than the Z configuration. Let us mention that the similar camphor imines have previously also been classified as E isomers. 28 Because of insufficient solubility of compounds 3a-g and 4b in CDCl 3 , their NMR spectra were recorded in MeOH-d 4 . The substitution of a proton at the exo position 2 of the bornane framework by a deuterium atom was observed. The deuteration degree varied from sample to sample, which can presumably be attributed to different solvent exposure times and slightly varied acidity of the medium for the samples. The substitution at the vinyl position of imines in MeOH-d 4 solution is observed rather frequently and occurs due to the presence of the tautomeric equilibrium with the enamine form. 29 Broadened signals for certain carbon atoms (and the signal for carbon atom C-(1) in the imino group in particular) were observed in the 13 C NMR spectra of compounds 3a-g and 4a, b.

These compounds, similar to those synthesized in the course of our study, are based on cage structure (adamantane for amantadine and rimantadine; isoborneol for deitiforin and compounds 3a-g and 4a, b). As indicated previously, the influenza A virus contains a proton-selective ion channel (M2) that is the target of the adamantane family of drug inhibitors. Despite structure similarity of camphor derivatives to rimantadine and deitiforin, some of them appeared active against pandemic influenza strain that is resistant to adamantane derivatives. This suggests that the target site for our compounds should include amino acids differing from those interacting with rimantadine (27, 28, 31 and 34) . Indeed, molecular modeling of interaction of dimeris camphor derivative 3a with M2 revealed that it preferentially binds with two adjacent chains of M2 tetramer ( Fig. 2 ) in the region of amino acids 40-54. This model allows a speculation of why linkers of specific length confers the symmetric dimeric derivatives of camphor higher activity comparing to monomers. As M2 is a tetramer consisting of four peptides, there are four sites in the M2 molecule able to interact with camphor derivative as it is presented in the figure. Combination of two camphor moieties in one molecule might increase a probability of M2 binding and increase the strength of such binding, especially if these two moieties are linked with each other by linker of appropriate length allowing to reach two binding sites. In other words, if two camphor moieties are linked, binding of one moiety to the M2 target increases a probability of binding of second moiety to neighboring binding site of M2 comparing to two independent molecules. This suggestion undoubtedly should be a subject for further study. ",

GFP was used as a reporter protein in these test kits. The expression of the GFP protein gene in cells of the biosensor carrying the pRAC-gfp plasmid is controlled by the regulatory region of the recA gene of Proteus mirabilis, which is linked to it. It has been demonstrated that this E. coli strain can be used as an indicator strain ensuring the detection of mutagens of both physical and chemical nature. 42 The designed whole-cell biosensor can presumably also be used to study the genotoxic effect of various compounds, novel drugs, dietary supplements, and foodstuffs. The fluorescence values of GFP synthesized by the cells of two types of whole-cell biosensors (E. coli/pRAC-gfp and E. coli/pET36b-gfp) and intended for assessing the possible mutagenic and toxic effects of the analyzed compounds are listed in columns 3 and 4. In controls \u20441 and \u2044\u20442 , water (negative control) or nalidixic acid at concentration of 10 lg/l (positive control), respectively, was added to the E. coli/pRAC-gfp cell cultures instead of the analyzed compounds. In control \u2044\u20442 , water was introduced to the E. coli/ pET36b-gfp cell culture instead of the analyzed compounds; after 1.5 h, IPTG was also added to final concentration of 1 mM. Another variant of a whole-cell biosensor is based on the E. coli strain BL-21(DE3) carrying pET36b-gfp plasmid that ensures isopropyl-b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-induced expression of the gfp gene, which is contained in it and is regulated by bacteriophage T7 promoter. The toxic effect of any compound under study on biosensor cells is accompanied by inhibition of macromolecular synthesis reactions, including the protein synthesis reaction and, in particular, IPTG-induced synthesis of GFP. The total toxic effect of the compounds under study on a cell can be estimated from the decrease in induced synthesis of GFP. Table 2 lists the results of determining the possible mutagenic and toxic effects of compounds 2-4 on cells of E. coli biosensor strains BL-21(DE3) carrying the pRAC-gfp or pET36b-gfp plasmid.",

Moreover, when comparing the cytotoxicity of compounds regarding four cell lines used in the study (CEM-13, U-937, MT-4 and MDCK), it should be noted that MDCK cells appeared much more resistant to toxic action of camphor derivatives. This may be explained by (i) different conditions of cultivation of these cell lines and (ii) selective toxicity of the compounds studied against lymphoblastoid cells comparing to ones of epithelial origin. Further studies are therefore required to get additional data to evaluate the properties of symmetric camphor derivatives as potential cytotoxic anti-cancer agents.",
