We have primarily studied human adenovirus type 12 (Ad12) which induces undifferentiated tumors in Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) either at the site of subcutaneous Ad12 injection or intraperitoneally upon intramuscular injection. Up to 90% of the hamsters injected with Ad12 develop tumors within 3-6 weeks. Integration of foreign DNA, its de novo methylation, and the consequences of insertion on the cellular methylation and transcription profiles have been studied in detail. While viral infections are a frequent source of foreign genomes entering mammalian and other hosts and often their genomes, we have also pursued the fate of food-ingested foreign DNA in the mouse organism. The persistence of this DNA in the animals is transient and there is no evidence for the expression or germ line fixation of foreign DNA. Nevertheless, the occasional cell that carries integrated genomes from that foreign source deserves the oncologist's sustained interest.",

Ad12-infected hamster cells continue to grow, and transformed cells get a chance to survive and, when originating in newborn hamsters, to develop tumors. In contrast, human Ad2 replicates in Syrian hamster cells, but fails to induce tumors, presumably because the virus kills all infected cells.",

There is minimal transcription of some of the early Ad12 functions [23, 24] , and only traces of early viral proteins are detectable [24] . Late Ad12 genes are not transcribed in Ad12-infected hamster cells. In contrast, human Ad2 replicates in hamster cells [20, 25] . Several attempts to salvage Ad12 DNA replication or steps beyond it in Syrian hamster cells have, at best, led to limited Ad12 DNA replication, even to late RNA synthesis in Ad5-transformed BHK297-C131 cells [26] but not to replication of Ad12 virions in substituting systems [21, 22, 24, [27] [28] [29] . Even after introducing amounts of Ad12 DNA comparable to that found in productively infected human cells, Ad12 DNA was still unable to overcome the barrier in Syrian hamster cells (Fig. 2) [22] . The replication of Ad12 virions in hamster cells is deficient in several essential cellular and/or viral functions. Syrian hamsters therefore become susceptible to Ad12-induced tumorigenesis since the Ad12-infected hamster cells survive infection, and some of them can develop into tumor cells.",

The SYREC DNA molecule consisted of a long palindrome with a left-terminal 2081 bp fragment of Ad12 DNA including the viral packaging signal at either terminus and many kilo base pairs of cellular DNA on its inside. This palindrome could fold back upon itself to form a hairpin structure. These results provided definitive proof for the occurrence of recombinants between viral and cellular DNAs in human cells productively infected by Ad12 as had previously been shown [58, 60] . The cellular DNA incorporated into the SYREC molecule was not methylated, whereas the same DNA sequence in the cellular genome itself proved hypermethylated [37] . Hence, viral or cellular DNA, that was part of a free adenoviral genome and replicated in the nucleus of infected cells, escaped DNA methylation, although the same cellular DNA sequence as an integral part of the host genome remained subject to it. The relation of a DNA molecule to chromatin, not merely its presence in the nucleus, was required to maintain or establish de novo methylation. The discovery of the adenovirus SYREC molecule served as the model for the construction of the gutless adenovirus vector molecules [61] .",

Adenovirus vector DNA integrated via the termini mostly as intact molecules. Analysis of the junction sequences indicated vector integration without an obvious preference for particular chromosomal regions, but with a preference for integration into genes. Patchy homologies between vector termini and chromosomal DNA were found at many integration sites. These results confirmed many of the conclusions our laboratory had reached much earlier on the mechanism of adenovirus DNA integration in hamster cells [39, 47] These results [62] demonstrate uniformity of integration mechanisms in mammalian cells and also refute the unwarranted claim that adenoviral genomes did not integrate into the genomes of human host cells.

The revertants had lost most or all chromosomally integrated multiple Ad12 genome copies [19, 33, 63, 64] , but nevertheless retained their oncogenic potential when re-injected into hamsters. Obviously, the persistence of integrated viral genomes was not required for the maintenance of the oncogenic potential. Thus, events set in motion by the integration of Ad12 DNA into the recipient genome initiated the oncogenic transformation of the hamster cells. Subsequently, the continuous presence of the viral genomes was no longer essential to maintain the oncogenic phenotype. Alterations of cellular DNA methylation patterns in hamster cells transformed by the integrated Ad12 genomes persisted in these revertants even in the absence of all viral genome copies [46] .

Recently, we determined the epigenetic status of integrated Ad12 DNA in cell line TR12 which is a fibroblastic revertant of the Ad12-transformed epitheloid hamster cell line T637 with 15 copies of integrated Ad12 DNA and carries an integrate of one Ad12 DNA copy plus a 3.9-kbp fragment from an additional copy [52] . The cellular insertion site for the Ad12 integrate is identical in both cell lines and represents a >5.2-kbp inverted DNA repeat (Fig. 3) . The Ad12 transgenome exhibits nucleosome configuration. The cellular nucleotide sequence at the Ad12-cell DNA junction is more sensitive to micrococcal nuclease digestion at Ad12-occupied than at unoccupied sites in non-Ad12 transgenic hamster cells. Bisulfite sequencing [52] revealed complete de novo methylation in most of the 1634 CpGs of the integrated viral DNA, except for sequences of the Ad12 E4 region that are located at its termini. Isolated unmethylated CpG dinucleotides extend over the entire Ad12 integrate (Fig. 4) . Similar islands of unmethylated CpG dinucleotides are also observed in the fully methylated human FMR1 promoter in fragile X patients [68] . Islands of unmethylated CpG dinucleotides in a background of heavily methylated DNA sequences may be a landmark of de novo methylated DNA, as in an integrated Ad12 transgenome or a silenced FMR1 promoter in cells from individuals with the fragile X syndrome. The fully methylated Ad12 transgenome segments in cell line TR12 are characterized by promoter silencing and histone H3 and H4 hypoacetylation [52] .",

We investigated factors that influenced de novo methylation. Homologous recombination was used to re-integrate the B lymphocyte kinase (BLK) gene into its authentic genome position in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells [69] . The methylation patterns were analyzed for both homologously recombined and randomly integrated foreign DNA in the ES cell clones. Upon homologous reinsertion of the BLK gene into the mouse genome, its methylation patterns were reestablished as they existed in the nonmanipulated mouse genome. In homologously recombined DNA, sequences carrying the weak adenovirus type 2 promoter were heavily methylated. In contrast, constructs with the much stronger SV40 promoter and an SV40 enhancer remained unmethylated or hypomethylated. Upon removal of the enhancer element, these inserted constructs also became heavily methylated. In addition, all randomly integrated constructs were heavily methylated independently of the promoter and enhancer element present in the construct. These results indicate that modes and sites of integration as well as the inserted nucleotide sequence, possibly promoter strength, are factors directing de novo methylation [69] .",

In normal hamster kidney and spleen DNA, on the non-occupied chromosome in the tumor cell line T1111 (2) , and in several Ad12-transformed hamster cell lines, this pre-insertion sequence is methylated at all 5 -CCGG-3 (HpaII) and 5 -GCGC-3 (HhaI) sequences.

Thus, the insertion of unmethylated foreign DNA can lead to the hypo-methylation, i.e. a significant change in DNA methylation in the flanking cellular target sequence [80] .

For several cellular DNA segments investigated, in particular for the intracisternal A particle retrotransposons, extensive increases in DNA methylation were found in comparison with the methylation patterns in BHK21 or primary Syrian hamster cells [46] . Interestingly, increased methylation of cellular genes was maintained in the hamster cell revertant TR3 that had originally carried integrated Ad12 DNA but subsequently lost all Ad12 DNA copies. Thus persistence of the foreign DNA was not required to preserve the changes in cellular DNA methylation patterns. By fluorescent in situ hybridization, the viral DNA integrate was located on only one hamster chromosome. The endogenous intracisternal A particle genomes showed striking distribution patterns on many hamster chromosomes, frequently on their short arms [82] . We attribute the alterations in cellular DNA methylation, at least in part, to the insertion of foreign DNA into the established hamster genome. Since alterations in DNA methylation patterns are likely to affect the transcription patterns of cellular genes, it is conceivable that these changes have played a role in the generation or in the maintenance of the Ad12-transformed phenotype.",

Hence, clonal BHK21 hamster cell lines were generated that carried in their genomes bacteriophage lambda and/or plasmid pSV2neo DNA at a single chromosomal site [50] . In different cell lines, the loci of foreign DNA insertion were different. The inserted lambda DNA frequently became de novo methylated. In some of the thus generated hamster cell lines, the levels of DNA methylation in the retrotransposon genomes of the endogenous intracisternal A particles were increased in comparison to those in the non-transgenic BHK21 cell lines. The results of genomic bisulfite sequencing documented alterations in the patterns of DNA methylation in selected segments of the IAPI sequences [50] . Among the BHK21 cells used in these studies differences in methylation patterns did not existed prior to lambda DNA integration. The DNA in a total of 66 nontransgenic BHK21 cell clones showed identical IAPI methylation patterns [50] . Further control experiments [50] led to the conclusion that the observed changes in the DNA methylation patterns in BHK21 cells with integrated lambda DNA had not pre-existed and had not been caused by the transfection procedure. Our data support the interpretation that the insertion of foreign DNA into a pre-existing mammalian genome can profoundly change the cellular patterns of DNA methylation. The cellular sites affected by and the extent of these changes might depend on the site and size of foreign DNA insertions [50] .",

By applying the technique of methylation-sensitive representational difference analysis (MS-RDA) [83] , we identified several cellular DNA segments that were indeed more heavily methylated in lambda DNA-transgenic as compared to non-transgenic hamster cell lines [51] . By using a suppressive subtractive hybridization technique to cDNA preparations from non-transgenic and Ad12-transformed or lambda DNA-transgenic hamster cells, several cellular genes with altered transcription patterns were cloned from the transgenic cells [51] . In control experiments, no differences in gene expression or DNA methylation patterns were detectable among individual non-transgenic BHK21 cell clones. We again conclude that the insertion of foreign DNA into mammalian genomes can lead to alterations in cellular DNA methylation and transcription patterns.",

Another source of foreign DNA entering mammalian organisms on a regular basis and in large amounts is the DNA ingested with the constant and inevitable food supply. We have therefore studied the fate of food ingested DNA in the mouse by several methods [56, 84] . Food-ingested foreign DNA was not completely degraded in the gastrointestinal tract of mice. Phage M13mp18 DNA as a test molecule was detected in the contents of the small intestine, the cecum, the large intestine, or the feces. In 254 animals, M13mp18 DNA fragments of up to 976 bp were found in blood 2-8 h after feeding. M13mp18 DNA fragments were traced by PCR in peripheral leukocytes and located by fluorescent in situ hybridization in about 1 of 1000 peripheral white blood cells between 2 and 8 h, and in spleen or liver cells up to 24 h after feeding. M13mp18 DNA could be traced by FISH in the columnar epithelial cells, in the leukocytes in Peyer's patches of the cecum wall, in liver cells, and in B cells, T cells, and macrophages from spleen. These findings suggested transport of foreign DNA through the intestinal wall and Peyer's patches to peripheral blood leukocytes and into several organs. Upon extended feeding, M13mp18 DNA could be re-cloned from total spleen DNA and, in one clone, was covalently linked to an 80 nt DNA segment with 70% homology to the mouse IgE receptor gene [56] .",

(ii) In a number of the Ad12-infected hamster cells, the viral genome becomes stably integrated into the host genome. (iii) Integration proceeds mainly by non-homologous recombination at a large number of possible cellular sites. There is no apparent specificity in the selection of the recombination site, except that short or patchy sequence homologies between the termini of the Ad12 genome and the recipient cellular DNA sequences or transcriptional activity can help target the integration reaction. (iv) In most instances, multiple copies of the Ad12 genome are integrated at a single chromosomal site. In 60 analyzed Ad12induced tumors, only one had Ad12 genomes integrated at two different chromosomal locations. There are no free Ad12 DNA copies in Ad12-transformed or tumor cells. Ad12 oncogenesis is a clonal event. (v) Observations described for integrated Ad12 molecules also hold for integrated DNA of bacteriophage lambda, and probably for many types of foreign DNA when integrated into a mammalian host genome. (vi) There is ample evidence that adenovirus DNA can also be integrated into the genomes of permissive human cells. Integrates are found at many different sites in the human genome. Their existence has been proven in Ad12 SYREC molecules or upon the infection of human cells with gutless, high capacity adenovirus vectors that are unable to replicate in and therefore do not kill human host cells. These results clarify the integrative capacity of adenoviral DNA and present a caveat towards the application of adenovirus vectors in human gene therapy. (vii) Integrated foreign (Ad12) genomes become rapidly de novo methylated. Methylation starts regionally in the transgenomes. In a revertant of an Ad12-transformed hamster cell line that harbors only one copy of Ad12 DNA and a right terminal fragment of a second Ad12 genome copy, the epigenetic profile of the integrate both with respect to de novo methylation and chromatin modifications has been determined. Except for the two terminally located Ad12 E4 regions, the entire integrate has become methylated and the genes almost completely silenced. In a background of completely de novo methylated DNA, there remain a few clustered or single CpG dinucleotide isles that, for unknown reasons, have escaped de novo methylation. The occurrence of such isles of unmethylated CpGs in a background of hypermethylated DNA sequences appears to be a characteristic of de novo methylation. (viii) Adenovirion DNA, free viral DNA in the nuclei of productively or abortively infected cells does not become de novo methylated. Cellular DNA sequences that are methylated in the intact genome, lack methylation when inserted into a symmetric recombinant of Ad12 DNA. (ix) The insertion of foreign DNA into an established mammalian genome leads to changes in methylation and transcription patterns in the recipient cellular genome. It is unknown whether this phenomenon is general and to what extent the host genome can be affected by these alterations. Extent and regions affected by these alterations may depend on the location of the site of foreign DNA insertion [85, 86] . (x) The finding of altered methylation patterns in cellular DNA segments upon foreign DNA insertion into the mammalian genome is of relevance for many fields of research in biology and medicine, e.g. in gene therapeutic regimens where the consequences on the structure and function of the rest of the genome have rarely been considered. Similarly, the frequent de novo methylation of inserted foreign DNA often limits the continued expression of the inserted foreign genes and even of reinserted authentic genes unless they become integrated at their authentic genome locations. (xi) As large amounts of foreign DNA constantly enter mammalian organisms through the food chain, it will be important to follow the fate of these DNA molecules in the recipient organisms. The persistence of a small fraction of this DNA in the animals is transient, and there is no evidence for the expression or germ line entry and fixation of foreign DNA in the host. Nevertheless, the occasional cell that genomically integrates fragments of food-ingested deserves the oncologist's interest.",
