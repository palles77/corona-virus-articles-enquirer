First-line antibiotic therapy for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should include amoxicillin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) for 7-10 days (strength of recommendation: A). High-dose amoxicillin (80-90 mg/kg divided twice daily for 5-7 days) is the antibiotic of choice for the initial treatment of acute otitis media (AOM) (strength of recommendation: B); lack of subjective improvement after 72 hours of treatment with amoxicillin indicates treatment failure, at which point the patient should be switched to amoxicillin/ clavulanate. Patients with persistent symptoms after therapy with high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate should receive 1-3 doses of intramuscular ceftriaxone (strength of recommendation: B). Pharmacotherapy treatment for influenza should be initiated within 48 hours of the start of symptoms, and it has been shown to reduce the duration of symptoms by only 1 day compared with placebo (strength of recommendation: B). The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recommends that persons at high risk of infection, recipients of transfusions or organ transplants before July 1992 (when HCV screening became standard), healthcare workers after a needlestick injury, and sexual partners of HCV-infected persons be tested for HCV infection (strength of recommendation: C). Currently, not all patients with HIV infection require the use of antiretroviral medication. Because of the adverse effects and the risk of the development of resistance associated with treatment, these medications are now initiated only when the CD4 count falls to below 350 cells/mL or in the setting of acute infection (strength of recommendation: B). More severe immune compromise occurs in HIV-positive patients at CD4 count levels of less than 200 cells/mL, at which point prophylactic antibiotics such as TMP/SMX are recommended (strength of recommendation: B). In cases of traveler's diarrhea (e.g., enterotoxigenic E. coli, Shigella, Salmonella, or Campylobacter infection), prompt treatment with a fluoroquinolone or, in children, TMP/SMX has been shown to reduce the duration of the illness from 3-5 days to less than 1-2 days (strength of recommendation: A). Patients with fever and bloody diarrhea should be treated empirically with TMP/SMZ or a fluoroquinolone (strength of recommendation: A). Recommended treatment regimens for gonococcal urethritis and proctitis include ceftriaxone, cefixime, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, or levofloxacin in single doses; if chlamydial infection is not ruled out and suspicion is high, then azithromycin or doxycycline should be given concomitantly (strength of recommendation: A). Parenteral administration of penicillin G is the preferred drug for treatment for all stages of syphilis (strength of recommendation: A).",

Given the broad scope of infectious diseases that affect men, we have selected several topics that are especially relevant to this patient population. These topics include community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), sinusitis, otitis media and externa, influenza, viral hepatitis (A, B and C), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, infectious diarrheas, and sexually transmitted diseases. Our aim in this chapter is not to provide an exhaustive review of these topics, but primarily to present an up-to-date and evidence-based approach to diagnosis and treatment of these common illnesses for primary care physicians in caring for male patients.",

Further complicating the treatment of CAP is the emergence of antibiotic resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, perhaps the most common organism implicated. 1 The rates of pneumonia are higher in men discharged from the hospital (4.1% in men versus 3.1% in women). 2 Microaspiration of organisms is the most common mechanism of infection leading to CAP, though hematogenous spread can also occur. 3 Host factors that predispose patients to an increased risk of the development of CAP include smoking, underlying lung disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] , bronchiectasis), uremia, malnutrition, alcohol abuse, ciliary motility defects (e.g., Kartagener's syndrome), alterations in consciousness, immunosuppression (e.g., HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS], corticosteroid use), advanced age, and gastric acid suppression. 4 Both bacterial and viral virulence factors play a significant role in the development of CAP.",

Admitted patients with severe illness or with chronic lung disease should have an arterial blood gas performed to assess for oxygenation and hypercapnia. 1 Hospitalized patients should have two sets of blood cultures drawn, and patients with pleural effusions should undergo thoracentesis to assess for empyema or complicated parapneumonic effusions. 4 Serologic antibody testing and cold agglutinin assays are not helpful initially and should only be performed if the patient's condition does not improve or for epidemiologic purposes. 4 ",

These agents have been proved to be superior to placebo and are as effective as other agents that are more expensive, have a greater risk of adverse effects, and should be reserved for more serious infections that require treatment with amoxicillinclavulanate, cefuroxime, or cefpodoxime. 11 For partial but incomplete resolution of symptoms after an initial course of antibiotics, the duration of initial therapy should be extended to complete a course for 21 days. In patients with moderate disease or in those with minimal to no improvement with initial therapy, high-dose amoxicillinclavulanate or levofloxacin should be used. 11 In areas of the United States where there is a high level of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, resistance to macrolides and TMP/SMX will also be prevalent, and second-generation cephalosporins (e.g., cefuroxime) should be used as initial therapy. 7 More recently, high-dose short-course regimens (3-5 days) have been used to improve adherence and to decrease drug exposure. 7 Clinical outcomes using these regimens compare favorably to more traditional 10-14-day regimens. 13 ",

If the auditory canal is occluded by fluid discharge, then the patient may complain of fullness and hearing loss. Fever and other systemic signs are uncommon in uncomplicated cases of OE. On physical examination, a serous or purulent exudate is commonly seen in the auditory canal, and pulling on the pinna elicits pain.

Influenza B viruses are not categorized into subtypes and do not cause pandemics. Since 1977, influenza A H1N1, influenza A H3N2, and influenza B viruses have been circulating worldwide. In the last century there have been three pandemics of influenza A that occurred in 1918, 1957, and 1968 . The most devastating of these pandemics was the 1918 outbreak of \"Spanish flu,\" which killed 40-50 million people worldwide and 500,000 in the United States. The outbreak of avian influenza (H5N1) in Southeast Asia that started in 2003 and caused 70 deaths as of January 2006 has raised concern about a seemingly overdue pandemic. 21 Epidemiology On average, approximately 36,000 people die from influenza-related complications and 226,000 are admitted to the hospital for influenza each year in the United States. 20 Very young children (0-4 years) and elderly persons (older than 65 years) compose the majority of these cases. The mortality rate in the 1990s for persons older than 65 years was 98.3/100,000 and was 7.5/100,000 in those aged 50-64 years.

There is no chronic infection with hepatitis A; treatment is supportive because the infection is self-limited. The diagnosis of HAV infection is based on a combination of symptoms and the presence of serum transaminase (i.e., alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase) and bilirubin elevations. Definitive diagnosis requires serologic evidence of acute disease via the presence of immunoglobulin M (IgM) anti-HAV. The presence of only IgG anti-HAV is not sufficient to diagnose acute hepatitis A, as approximately 33% of the US population has had exposure at some time. 26 Prevention of HAV infection can be achieved through vaccination or passive immunization. 26 Inactivated whole-virus HAV vaccine is used in the United States and confers protection in 94-100% of adults. The two formulations used in the United States include Havrix and VAQTA. Adverse events from vaccination are rare and are usually limited to local irritation at the site of intramuscular injection. Twinrix, a combination vaccine containing HAV and hepatitis B components, should be administered in three doses at 0, 1, and 6 months.

The vaccine is available as a single-antigen formula (Recombivax HB, Engerix-B) or in combination with HAV vaccine (Twinrix). Since March of 2000, HBV vaccines do not contain thimerosal; all formulations are safe with minor site reactions being the most common adverse effect. Vaccination consists of three intramuscular injections at 0, 1, and 6 months for adults and children. In immunocompetent adults, vaccination is likely to be protective for 15-20 years. HBV vaccine is currently recommended in childhood and mandated by many states before children are allowed to enter school. Immunocompromised patients (e.g., persons with HIV/AIDS), patients receiving dialysis, persons receiving clotting factors via transfusion, healthcare workers and persons coming into contact with blood in the workplace, injection/intranasal drug users, persons with multiple sex partners, inmates and workers in correctional facilities, and international travelers should all strongly consider prophylactic vaccination.",

            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a single-stranded RNA virus that causes chronic liver disease and is the most common reason for liver transplantation in the United States. 29 The prevalence of HCV antibody (anti-HCV) in the United States is 1.4%, and approximately 36,000 new infections occur every year. Thus, 3.9 million persons are anti-HCV positive, and between 8000 and 13,000 die each year from end-stage liver disease. The highest incidence of infection is among 20-39 year olds, and males and African Americans are more likely to develop chronic infection. 29 HCV is transmitted through contact with infected blood or mucosal secretions. 30 Those at increased risk of acquiring HCV infection include intravenous and intranasal drug users, healthcare workers, persons having unprotected sex with multiple partners, and persons undergoing body piercing or tattoos; data on acquisition of the virus through sexual contact and tattooing have been inconsistent. Acquiring HCV infection through the blood supply or from blood products is unlikely today in the United States given current blood and blood product testing. Sexual transmission of HCV is reportedly lower than HBV, especially among monogamous couples, and transmission through casual contact is not believed to occur. Perinatal transmission occurs in 5% of infants born to anti-HCV-positive mothers. 30 Quite alarming is that 44% of newly diagnosed cases have no risk factors identified over the previous 6 months. 30 Unlike HAV and HBV, acute infection with HCV is usually asymptomatic, and jaundice is present in fewer than 25% of cases. 31 Eighty percent of persons acutely infected with HCV remain anti-HCV positive, and 60-80% will have persistently elevated serum transaminase levels. Most patients with chronic HCV infection are asymptomatic and the only clue to disease is the elevated serum transaminase levels. Cirrhosis eventually develops in 7-17% of patients with chronic infection after an average of 20-25 years 31 ; immunocompromised patients (e.g., persons with HIV/AIDS) and alcoholics may progress to cirrhosis more quickly. The development of cirrhosis is silent, but end-stage liver disease eventually occurs at a rate of 3.9% per year. These patients will eventually develop jaundice, ascites, anasarca, and esophageal varices and the mortality rate is 43% at 34 months unless liver transplant is performed. 31 Hepatocellular carcinoma develops at a rate of 3% per year in patients with cirrhosis. 31 The diagnosis of HCV infection is difficult because few persons present symptomatically with acute disease 32 ; many clinicians discover the infection on further investigation of incidental elevated serum transaminase levels. Given the success of newer treatments for HCV infection, an early diagnosis is essential. Currently, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recommends that persons at high risk of infection (see above), recipients of transfusions or organ transplants before July 1992 (when HCV screening became standard), healthcare workers after a needlestick injury, and sexual partners of HCV-infected persons be tested. 32 Persons who are found to be HCV positive should be counseled to avoid sharing dental and shaving equipment with others, to cover any bleeding wounds, and to avoid donating blood or blood products. In addition, HCVinfected persons should be counseled that the risk of sexual transmission is low and that infection is no reason to change sexual practices in a long-term relationship. 32 Diagnosis of HCV infection is achieved via serologic assays for anti-HCV. Those persons with a positive anti-HCV should undergo HCV PCR testing to quantify viral load and genotype testing to determine HCV type (e.g., type 1, 2). Selected patients should undergo a liver biopsy to determine the extent of hepatic disease. 32 Treatment decisions should be individualized and are based on the severity of liver disease, the potential of serious adverse effects, the likelihood of treatment response, and the presence of comorbid conditions. 32 Thus, HCVinfected persons should be monitored by an expert in infectious diseases or hepatology. The current treatment of choice is pegylated interferon plus ribavirin for a period of 6-12 months. 32 Success of therapy depends on HCV genotype (genotype 1 is the most refractory to treatment), underlying comorbidities, and the extent of hepatic injury. A sustained viral response, defined as the absence of HCV virus in the blood 6 months after treatment, is achieved in 25-40% of treated persons. Re-treatment is sometimes necessary for nonresponders or in the case of relapse. 32 Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome",

Conversely, up to 89% of patients who acutely are infected with HIV will have a constellation of symptoms consisting of fever, rash, myalgias, headache, and anorexia. 35 They also may develop laboratory abnormalities including thrombocytopenia and transaminitis. Unfortunately, these signs and symptoms are quite nonspecific and may be confused with other viral infections. Therefore, a high index of suspicion must be maintained and HIV testing must be performed if any risk factors are discovered after careful evaluation (Table 11 -9) . Identifying patients with acute HIV infection is important since people are most highly infectious to others at the time of initial infection, and since the virus is multiplying at a very high rate before an organized immune response. It remains unclear whether initiating antiretroviral therapy during this time is of clinical benefit, although this issue remains a subject of ongoing study since decreasing the rate of HIV replication early in the course of infection may theoretically preserve specific CD4 cell responses. 36 ",

Since 1996, when multiple antiretroviral medications became available that acted at different stages of the viral life cycle, the long-term prognosis for patients living with HIV infection has improved dramatically. Pharmacotherapy is now available in four different classes that act to disrupt viral replication at the level of HIV RNA to DNA transcription (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors), HIV capsid assembly (protease inhibitors), and HIV fusion to the CD4 positive T cell (fusion inhibitors). These drugs are used in certain combinations under the guidance of an HIV specialist to create highly active antiretroviral therapy that fully suppresses HIV replication and allows the regeneration of CD4 cells that reconstitute the patient's immune system to improved levels of functioning. 38 When the immune system is successfully reconstituted, patients are no longer at a high risk for the opportunistic infections associated with the morbidity and mortality that occurs with AIDS. Currently, not all patients with HIV infection require the use of antiretroviral medication. Because of the adverse effects and the risk of the development of resistance associated with treatment, these medications are now initiated only when the CD4 count falls to below 350 cells/mL or in the setting of acute infection. 38",

Glucose intolerance and hyperlipidemia can occur with the use of some protease inhibitors as well including lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra). 38 Mitochondrial toxicity leading to lactic acidosis can be caused by any of the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and has been particularly linked to the use of stavudine (Zerit) and didanosine (Videx), especially when used together. 38 The non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors such as nevirapine (Viramune) can cause a drug-induced hepatitis and sometimes severe cutaneous drug eruptions. 38 Although antiretroviral therapy has significantly reduced the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection and has been of great benefit to many patients, these drugs must be used judiciously to minimize the risk of severe toxicity.",

Although the highest mortality worldwide occurs among children, in the United States most of those who die from diarrheal disease are elderly. 45 Since many different microorganisms can cause infectious diarrhea, it is useful to divide them into three groups: community-acquired or traveler's diarrhea, nosocomial diarrhea, and persistent diarrhea (diarrhea lasting for greater than 7 days) ( Table 11 -11). 45 The most common community-acquired organisms include viruses such as Norovirus, Enterovirus, and Rotavirus and bacteria including Campylobacter, Salmonella species (non-typhi), Shigella species, Escherichia coli, and enterotoxigenic S. aureus. A new vaccination is available for rotavirus and is administered to children at 2, 4, and 6 months of age; the previous version of the vaccination was taken off the market several years ago as a result of numerous fatal cases of intussusception. Traveler's diarrhea is most likely to be caused by E. coli, but Entamoeba histolytica and Salmonella typhi must also be included. Nosocomial diarrhea is almost exclusively caused by Clostridium difficile, although S. aureus has been implicated in some cases. Both of these diarrheas are associated with antibiotic use. Although clindamycin is classically associated with C. difficile infection, any antibiotic (particularly broad-spectrum antibiotics) can cause the disease. Persistent diarrheas are most commonly caused by protozoal organisms including Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora, and Isospora belli.",

The incubation period is typically 2-5 days, but recent studies suggest that this may be increasing. 51 Dysuria is usually more prominent and the discharge is generally more profuse and purulent than NGU. Epididymitis, proctitis, and pharyngitis are less common complication of N. gonorrhoeae infection. Anorectal gonorrhea is frequently the only site of infection in MSM and is uncommon in heterosexual men. Symptoms of proctitis include a mucopurulent rectal discharge, anal pruritus, tenesmus, pain, and rectal bleeding. Oropharyngeal infections with N. gonorrhoeae are frequently asymptomatic. First-line treatment for gonococcal pharyngeal infection is either intramuscular ceftriaxone or oral ciprofloxacin. 48 Disseminated gonococcal infection results from gonococcal bacteremia and is often highlighted with petechial or pustular acral skin lesions, asymmetrical arthralgia, tenosynovitis, or septic arthritis. 48 It is a relatively common cause of infective arthritis in young adults. Gonococcal bacteremia often is intermittent, so that a minimum of three blood cultures should be obtained when disseminated disease is suspected. Approximately one half of patients with a disseminated gonococcal infection will have positive cultures of blood or synovial fluid. 52 Hospitalization is recommended for initial therapy, especially for patients who may not comply with treatment. Patients should be examined for clinical evidence of endocarditis and meningitis. The recommended regimen for disseminated gonococcal infection is intramuscular or intravenous ceftriaxone (1 g every 24 hours). 48 Culture for N. gonorrhoeae remains the gold standard for diagnosis. Urethral, rectal, and pharyngeal specimens can be obtained using cotton swabs plated on Thayer-Martin agar. Nucleic acid amplification tests offer noninvasive, rapid results on both urine and urethral specimens and are the most commonly used assays in practice today. The sensitivity and specificity of nucleic acid amplification tests via both specimens is similar, and in some studies greater, than via standard culture. 48 Recommended treatment regimens for gonococcal urethritis and proctitis include ceftriaxone, cefixime, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, or levofloxacin in single doses (Table 11-12) . Quinolone-resistant N. gonorrhoeae is common in Hawaii, California, and parts of Asia and the Pacific and among MSM, 44 and thus quinolones are no longer recommended for the treatment of gonorrhea in these areas or in MSM; the first-line therapy for these groups is ceftriaxone. 48 A detailed travel history for the patient and his or her partners is recommended before a therapy is chosen. If chlamydial infection is not ruled out and suspicion is high, then azithromycin or doxycycline should be given concomitantly. 48 ",

Treponemal tests include the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed and T. pallidum particle agglutination tests.

The nontreponemal tests are recommended as screening tools, and the treponemal tests are required for confirmation. Nontreponemal tests usually correlate with disease activity and usually become nonreactive with time, which can provide a false-negative result if they are the sole test performed in a patient with a previous infection. Reactive treponemal tests usually remain reactive regardless of treatment or disease activity. Some HIVinfected patients can have atypical serologic tests results (unusually high, unusually low, or fluctuating titers). 48 Positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) VDRL results are diagnostic of neurosyphilis, if the specimen is not contaminated with blood.

            "text": "Human papilloma virus (HPV) is a DNA virus that causes penile and perirectal warts in men. 48 The prevalence of anal HPV (i.e., PCR positive) in MSM is approximately 57% and the most common genotype seen is HPV-16, a high-risk type associated with anal cancer. Nineteen percent of men attending sexually transmitted disease clinics in the United States have been found to be seropositive for HPV-16. 48 The most consistent risk factor for HPV acquisition is unprotected sexual activity and is directly related to the number of sexual partners a patient has had. In men, HPV most commonly presents as a painless, cauliflower-like anogenital wart (i.e., condyloma acuminatum) that grows over time. Although the diagnosis of HPV is most often made on a clinical basis, definitive diagnosis can be obtained via biopsy. There is currently no antiviral medication available for HPV eradication; however, ablative treatment is useful (see Table 11 -12) . HPV can be transmitted even when lesions are not present, and condom use does not guarantee protection because the virus is often transmitted through nonpenetrative sexual contact. Males who practice anal receptive intercourse should have yearly examinations for anal warts and, if lesions are present, a biopsy should be performed to evaluate for anal cancer. A vaccine against many serotypes of HPV (Gardasil) has shown success in various trials and was approved by the FDA in 2006, but it currently only has an indication in females aged 9-26 years.",

            "text": "Herpes simplex virus types 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2) were linked to more than 200,000 genital infections in 2003, and it is estimated that more than 30 million persons in the United States currently have genital HSV. Although HSV-2 is responsible for most cases of genital infection, the prevalence of HSV-1 is rising, especially among women. The highest rates of HSV-2 seroprevalence in the United States have been reported among female prostitutes and homosexual males (83%). 57 Males are only one half as likely as females to be infected with both HSV-1 and HSV-2. 57 There is a wide spectrum of HSV genital disease, ranging from asymptomatic shedding to a painful genital ulcer with dysuria, painful inguinal adenopathy, and fever. In men, a vesicular penile ulcer with an erythematous base and dysuria are the most common presenting symptoms. Recurrent genital lesions are common, especially with HSV-2 (60%). 57 Nineteen days is the average duration of lesions seen in primary infection, and this decreases by up to 10 days with recurrences. Although transmission to sexual partners is higher with active lesions, 70% of transmissions are attributed to asymptomatic viral shedding. Transmission is greater with male versus female source patients (17% versus 4%). Diagnosis is usually suggested by a painful, shallow, genital ulcer, but viral culture, direct fluorescent antibody testing, and PCR can be used as confirmatory tests. 57 PCR is especially useful in the diagnosis of asymptomatic carriage. Serologies are most helpful for epidemiologic studies and are not useful acutely to diagnose infection. Various treatment options for HSV genital infection are outlined in Table 11 -12. 48",
