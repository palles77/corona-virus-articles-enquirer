First, we generated a soluble recombinant partial spike S1 protein (aP2) from PEDV in E. coli and then evaluated the utility of aP2 subunit vaccine-loaded hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate microspheres (HPMCP) and RANKL-secreting L. lactis (LLRANKL) as a candidate oral vaccine in pregnant sows. Pregnant sows were vaccinated twice (with a 2 week interval between doses) at 4 weeks before farrowing. Titers of virus-specific IgA antibodies in colostrum, and neutralizing antibodies in serum, of sows vaccinated with HPMCP (aP2) plus LL RANKL increased significantly at 4 weeks post-first vaccination. Furthermore, the survival rate of newborn suckling piglets delivered by sows vaccinated with HPMCP (aP2) plus LL RANKL was similar to that of piglets delivered by sows vaccinated with a commercial killed porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PED) vaccine. The South Korean government promotes a PED vaccine program (live-killed-killed) to increase the titers of IgA and IgG antibodies in pregnant sows and prevent PEDV. The oral vaccine strategy described herein, which is based on a safe and efficient recombinant subunit antigen, is an alternative PED vaccination strategy that could replace the traditional strategy, which relies on attenuated live oral vaccines or artificial infection with virulent PEDV.",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a highly infectious and contagious enteric disease of swine (Song and Park, 2012) . The disease is characterized by severe diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and death, and has a mortality rate among suckling piglets of more than 90 % (Lee, 2015) . Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), the causative agent of PED, is a RNA virus belonging to the alpha genus of the coronavirus family (Wang et al., 2013) . The spike(S) protein is the primary target for development of subunit vaccines against PEDV. The S protein of PEDV, which comprises two domains(S1 (amino acids (aa) 1-789) and S2 (aa 790-1383)), is a transmembrane glycoprotein localized on the virion surface (Sun et al., 2007) . The S protein plays a pivotal role in binding to cellular receptors, fusion with the target cell membrane, and most importantly, induction of neutralizing antibodies (Song and Park, 2012 ). Subsequently, a novel neutralizing epitope, S1D (aa 636-789), was identified on the S1 domain; this is the epitope responsible for induction of neutralizing antibodies against PEDV (Sun et al., 2007) . To date, a number of expression systems have been used to generate the S protein of PEDV; these include mammalian cells, transgenic plants, yeast, and E. coli (Sun et al., 2007; Kang et al., 2004; Oh et al., 2014; Park et al., 2007) . Despite the absence of post-translational modifications (i.e., phosphorylation, acetylation, and glycosylation), expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli has marked advantages over other expression systems in terms of cost, ease-of-use, and scale. However, over expressing recombinant proteins in E. coli often leads to the misfolding of the protein of interest into biologically inactive aggregates known as inclusion bodies (IBs) (Yamaguchi and Miyazaki, 2014) .",

Both synthetic and natural polymers, including enteric coated polymers, are being evaluated as vehicles to deliver proteins to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate (HPMCP) is an example of an enteric coating excipient used widely by the pharmaceutical industry (Singh et al., 2008) . The RANKL/RANK system plays an important role in development and regulation of the immune system; for example, it is involved in lymph-node organogenesis, lymphocyte differentiation, dendritic cell survival, and T-cell activation, and it promotes the functions of antigenpresenting cells (Maharjan et al., 2016) . Therefore, increasing the number of microfold cells (M cells) by delivering RANKL may be a promising biomimetic strategy to increase the efficacy of oral vaccination (Kim et al., 2015) . Oral vaccination of pregnant sows to induce lactogenic immunity is a fundamental strategy used to protect suckling pigs from infection with PEDV (Langel et al., 2016) . The extent of this protection depends on the presence of virus-specific IgA antibodies in the milk of immunized sows.",

The antigen comprised the S1D epitope (aa 636-789) of the S1 domain of the S protein of PEDV CV777 strain (GenBank Accession No. AF353511). The antigen was synthesized after codon-optimization using GenScript (Piscataway, NJ, USA). A seed culture was prepared by inoculation of a single colony of recombinant E. coli BL21 strain into a 50 ml sterile plastic tube containing 5 ml LB broth supplemented with 100 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin; the culture was then grown overnight. To express the recombinant protein, 1 % of the seed culture was routinely inoculated into 500 ml LB broth containing 100 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin. Cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C with shaking (at 230 rpm). When the OD 600 of the culture reached about 0.6, recombinant proteins were induced by addition of 0.3 mM IPTG and cultured at 37\u00b0C for 4-6 h. After induction, cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at \u221220\u00b0C until required. To purify IBs, cells from a 1 l culture of each recombinant strain were harvested by centrifugation for 5 min at 5000 g, washed twice in distilled water, and lysed in lysis buffer I (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing 10 mg/ml lysozyme and 1 mg/ml DNase I. After 1 h, cells were disrupted by sonication for 3 min using a 2 s-on and 5 s-off cycle, and an amplitude of 30 %. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 4\u00b0C for 5 min at 32,000 g. Next, the pellet was washed three times in lysis buffer II (lysis buffer I containing 0.5 % Triton X-100). Purified IBs were collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 32,000 g.

Another group of pigs received oral vaccination with 10 12 CFU RANKL-secreting L. lactis (group 5). A control group (group 2) received IM vaccination with a commercial PED vaccine, a commercial killed vaccine (SM98 strain), using the same regimen. Finally, another control group (group 1) was mock-vaccinated (Table 1) . Serum samples were collected from pregnant sows before and at 4 weeks post-vaccination (at the time of farrowing), and colostrum samples were collected from lactating sows at the time of delivery. Whey was separated from colostrum and tested in a virus neutralization assay. Offspring suckling piglets were housed with their sows and received no artificial colostrum or milk. Three-day-old piglets were selected at random from each farrowing sow in the vaccinated and control groups, and challenged with virulent PEDV. Briefly, 76 sucking piglets were transported from the farm to an environmentally controlled facility at the Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency (APQA), where they received artificial milk four times daily. The suckling piglets (aged 5 days) were challenged orally with 10 ml/dose (10 2.5 TCID 50 /ml) of wild-type virulent PEDV (K14JB01 strain, GenBank Accession No. KJ623926). Clinical signs of diarrhea, morbidity, and mortality were monitored three times daily up to 14 days post challenge (dpc). Rectal swabs were collected and body weight was checked every day (from Day 0 (pre-challenge) to 14 dpc). Diarrhea was scored daily for the first 14 dpc and then every other day thereafter.

            "text": "Here, we generated a soluble aP2 protein containing PEDV S1D and loaded it into pH-sensitive HPMCP microspheres. SEM images revealed that the microspheres ranged from 1 to 10 \u03bcm in size and were spherical. The size of microspheres affects their uptake by APCs and M cells. Particles smaller than 5 \u03bcm may transfer to the draining lymph nodes and spleen, where they stimulate both mucosal and systemic immune responses, where as particle sizes measuring 5-10 \u03bcm are retained in the Peyer's patches, where they stimulate mainly mucosal immune responses. Particles measuring more than 10 \u03bcm are too large to be taken up by immune cells or M cells. The loading content and efficiency of aP2-loaded HPMCP microspheres were 6.3 % and 42.5 %, respectively. Moreover, an in vitro release test revealed that 70 % of aP2 was released from microspheres within 1 h at pH 7.0, but only 20 % were released at pH 2.0, suggesting that HPMCP (aP2) is suitable as an oral vaccine. HPMCP55 is a pH-sensitive polymer that dissolves at pH > 5.5. The observed rapid dissolution of aP2-loaded HPMCP microspheres may be due to the pH of PBS, which is far higher than 5.5. In the GI, the pH gradient from stomach to ileum is 2.0-7.4. Therefore, we assume S. Choe, et al. Veterinary Microbiology 242 (2020) 108604 that aP2 will be released slowly from HPMCP microspheres after passing through the stomach, and then more rapidly as it approaches the ileum. The colostrum neutralizing antibody titer of sows vaccinated intramuscularly with HPMCP(aP2) microspheres was 6-7 (log 2 ), suggesting that humoral immune responses were induce defficiently by injection of HPMCP(aP2) microspheres, and that virus-neutralizing IgG antibodies were transferred to the colostrum after farrowing. Sows vaccinated orally with HPMCP(aP2) microspheres alone or with microspheres plus the LL RANKL adjuvant showed higher serum and colostrum neutralizing antibody titers than mock-vaccinated sows, suggesting that both humoral and mucosal immune responses are induced efficiently.",

            "text": "Maternal L-K-K (attenuated live vaccine-killed vaccine-killed vaccine) vaccination is more efficacious than K-K vaccination in terms of absolute improvement in survival rates and significant mitigation of diarrhea, as well as the quantity and duration of viral shedding in stool (Jang et al., 2019) . Oral vaccination of sows with HPMCP (aP2) plus LL RANKL induced high neutralizing antibody titers in serum, colostrum, and whey, and induced IgA antibodies in colostrum and whey. The mortality rate of piglets delivered by sows vaccinated with HPMCP (aP2) plus LL RANKL was the same (50 %) as that of piglets delivered by sows vaccinated with the commercial killed PED vaccine. Therefore, our current oral vaccine strategy based on a recombinant subunit antigen (aP2) in conjunction with the HPMCP carrier and LL RANKL adjuvant could be a novel alternative vaccination strategy for preventing PED. Lactogenic immunity is described as a continuous supply of passively acquired immunoglobulin (IgG, IgM, and sIgA) through ingestion of colostrum and milk (Klobasa and Butler, 1987) . This is dependent on trafficking of pathogen-specific IgA + plasmablasts to the mammary gland (MG) and accumulation of secretory IgA (sIgA) antibodies in milk, defined as the gut-MG-sIgA axis (Bohl and Saif, 1975; Bohl et al., 1972; Fink, 2012) . Maternal vaccination to increase the amount of protective antibodies (induced via the gut-MG-sIgA axis) passively transferred in milk is the strategy used to protect suckling piglets from PEDV immediately after birth (Langel et al., 2016; Chattha et al., 2015) . The increased rate of protection is associated with high titers of IgA antibodies in colostrum and milk. We expect that if the suckling piglet challenge experiments were performed while the piglets were cohabitant with vaccinated sows (i.e., piglets received PED-sIgA-containing milk), then the survival rates after challenge with virulent virus would be higher. Because the milk of sows vaccinated with HPMCP (aP2) microspheres plus LL RANKL contained sIgA specific for PEDV, continuous milk intake would increase immunity to PEDV. This demonstrates that enteric viral infection stimulates the intestinal mucosa, thereby influencing lactogenic immunity via the gut-MG-sIgA axis (Langel et al., 2016; Chattha et al., 2015) . Many swine researchers in South Korea promote a PED vaccine program (live-killed-killed) to increase IgA and IgG antibody production by pregnant sows to ensure effective prevention of PEDV. In Korea, the L-K-K vaccine program involves continuous inoculation during pregnancy to raise IgA and IgG antibody titers in pregnant sows and in the colostrum fed to their piglets. The L-K-K vaccine program involves vaccinating pregnant sows three times. The first vaccination is with a live attenuated PED vaccine at 7-8 weeks before delivery, followed by two vaccinations with killed vaccine at 5-6 weeks and 2-3 weeks before delivery. Optimal timing (at 58-65 days of gestation, the middle period of pregnancy) of oral vaccination increases maternal immunity and lactogenic immunity for at least 7-8 weeks. A previous study examined survival of piglets born to sows infected with PEDV during the early, middle, and terminal stages of pregnancy (Langel et al., 2019) . All piglets born to sows infected during mid-gestation survived, compared with 75 % of those in the early gestation group and 25 % of those in the late gestation group (Langel et al., 2019) . Thus, maternal immunity and lactogenic immunity were strongest when sows were exposed to PEDV during the mid-gestation period; in addition, the diarrhea scores and virus shedding by neonatal suckling piglets after PEDV challenge were low (Langel et al., 2019) . Therefore, we propose that immunization with HPMCP (aP2) microspheres plus LL RANKL is likely to be most effective during the mid-pregnancy period.",
