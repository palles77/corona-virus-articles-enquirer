Moreover, our results show that relieving personal protection too early may lead to the spread of disease for a longer time and more people would be infected, and may even cause epidemic or outbreak again.

([6] ) analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan and determined the epidemiologic characteristics of COVID-19. Based on their estimates, the mean incubation period was 5.2 days, and R 0 was 2.2, which is in line with the result estimated by Riou et al. ([7] ). Zhao et al. ( [8] ) assessed the unreported number of COVID-19 cases in China in the first half of January with the estimation of R 0 2.56. Considering the impact of the variations in disease reporting rate, Zhao et al. ( [9] ) modelled the epidemic curve of COVID-19 cases, in mainland China from January 10 to January 24, 2020, through the exponential growth and concluded that the mean R 0 ranged from 2.24 to 3.58 associated with 8-fold to 2-fold increase in the reporting rate. Li et al. ([10] ) conducted a mathematical modeling study using five independent methods to assess R 0 of COVID-19. Their results illustrated that R 0 dropped from 4.38 to 3.41 after the closure of Wuhan city. Over the entire epidemic period COVID-19 had a R 0 of 3.39. Moreover, Tang et al. formulated a deterministic compartmental model. Their estimations based on likelihood and model analysis showed that R 0 with control measures might be as high as 6.47 ( [5] ). Most recently, Chen et al. ( [11] ) developed a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People transmission network model to simulate the potential transmission from the infectious sources to human. The estimated values of R 0 were 2.30 from reservoir to person and 3.58 from person to person. We noticed that the estimations of R 0 in varied studies are different. As mentioned in [5, 12] , variability in the estimation of the basic reproduction number is a general recognized methodological issue, and standardized methods both for calculating and reporting R 0 are still missing. Furthermore, the value of R 0 may vary with key clinical parameters inferred from data which depend on the time period, quality, accuracy, and reliability. To better quantify the evolution of the interventions, Tang et al. fitted the previously proposed model in [5] to the data available until January 29th, 2020 and re-estimated the effective daily reproduction ( [13] ). There are also some literatures focusing on the prediction of COVID-19 development trend. Wang et al. formulated a complex network model and analyzed the possible time node and All rights reserved.

Assuming that the adjusting time is from March 5th, 2020, Figure 6 (a) and (b) illustrate that contact rate with 20% of the initial value c 0 will not cause the disease re-bounce. However, the epidemic period will be extended for about 40 days until early May and the cumulative number of confirmed cases will increase by around 0.5% to 13227. While if the starting time of the adjusting is postponed to March 20th, the epidemic time of disease will be extended for about one week and the cumulative number of confirmed cases will increase by only around 0.05% to 13161, compared with the scenario of no changes. Nevertheless, if the contact rate is half of the initial value, i.e. q 1 = 0.5 and R e (t) = 1.68, COVID-19 will re-bounce All rights reserved.

Particularly, we adopted two novel function forms which dynamically captured the real-time endemic situation. The first one is the contact rate, c(t), which was assumed to be dependent on the cumulative number of confirmed cases to better quantify the varied interventions and self-protection measures. The other one is the contact tracing rate, which was dependent on the number of new cases. We evaluated the impact of partial lifting control measures on COVID-19 transmission. Our results show that relieve self-protection too early may lead to the spread of the virus for a longer time and more people would be infected, and may even lead to the mass transmission of the virus again. The reduction of the emergency response level does not mean that people can be off guard. At least until the end of March, life will not be able to return to normal.",

It requires certain time from unknown to known. Therefore, the data accuracy in Wuhan, Hubei is a major issue for parameters' calibration.
