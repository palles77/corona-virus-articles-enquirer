In addition, the report identified that approximately 24 MHz would be needed within five years of the report; yet, by the fall of 2001, few of these recommendations had been implemented. The 1997 Balanced Budget Act enabled the FCC to allocate 24 MHz for public safety from television (TV) channels 60-69 (746-806 MHz). Existing TV stations are to relinquish these channels by December 31, 2006, or when 85% of households in the market have switched to digital television (DTV), whichever is later. State and local governments need a firm date for planning, funding, system design, and construction. The current 85% exception creates a loophole that may hamper implementation of the 1997 rules.

Problems with communications have been documented where emergency calls are dropped, 9-1-1 operators are overwhelmed with multiple calls, and responses are delayed for lack of information.

As was shown in a field test conducted in western New York State, ACN systems can detect a crash that has occurred and automatically notify 9-1-1 dispatchers of the event and the location, leading to a decreased scene response time (RT). 2 However, because the ACN system measures real-time collision parameters, such as force vector, change in velocity, and vehicle dynamics, it can also be used to predict the likelihood of injury in a given crash. If this technology were integrated with an organized trauma system, and if data were efficiently and effectively relayed to all care providers, it could not only expedite identification of vehicle crashes, but also predict injuries.

A recent study was conducted to determine the effect of current RTs on survival in an urban EMS system. The 90% fractile RT specifications required for county compliance include 10:59 minutes for emergency life-threatening calls (priority 1) and 12:59 minutes for emergency non-life-threatening calls (priority 2). All emergency responses resulting in a priority 1 or priority 2 transport to a level 1 trauma-center emergency department over a six-month period were evaluated to determine the relation between specified and arbitrarily assigned RTs and survival. Of the 5,424 transports reviewed, no statistically significant difference in median RTs between survivors (6.4 minutes) and nonsurvivors (6.8 minutes) was noted. Further, no statistically significant difference was identified between observed and ex-pected deaths. However, mortality risk was 1.58% for patients whose RT exceeded 5 minutes, and 0.51% for those whose RT was under 5 minutes. The mortality risk curve was generally flat over RT intervals exceeding 5 minutes. In this observational study, emergency calls in which the RT was less than 5 minutes were associated with improved survival when compared with calls in which the RT exceeded 5 minutes. Although variables other than time may be associated with this improved survival, there is little evidence in these data to suggest that changing this system's RT specifications to times less than current specifications, but greater than 5 minutes, would have any beneficial effect on survival. 3 An additional barrier to communications networking is that there is no comprehensive, electronic directory of all emergency-response and public-health agencies. No entity, governmental or otherwise, has the ability to send emergency warnings or data to all or some emergency responders or to public information outlets in a particular area. A system must be developed so that emergency data and information can be sent to a shared map resource by emergency managers, telephone companies, wireless carriers, and others, and displayed/shared by all relevant emergency responders. These and broadband connections to a safety network create a basic platform on which a wide variety of other applications can operate.",

Since that time, the concept of medical-priority dispatch training has spread throughout North America, with an estimated 400 municipalities using some form of medical-priority dispatching. The emergency medical dispatcher (EMD) is the principal link between the public caller requesting emergency medical assistance and the EMS resource-delivery system. The traditional medical dispatch systems that are used to dispatch EMS to medical emergencies include the following: 1) systematized caller interrogation questions, 2) systematized prearrival instructions, and 3) protocols matching the dispatcher's evaluation of injury or illness severity with vehicle-response mode and configuration. As such, the EMD plays a fundamental role in the ability of the EMS system to respond to a perceived medical emergency.",

A critical component of early detection and warning resides with the dispatcher. The early-warning biosurveillance system uses real-time information pulled from 9-1-1 and other public-safety calls to recognize aberrant patterns in call density or frequency. Such a system analyzes calls as they are coded by a dispatch center, compares them with historical and regional data, and automatically alerts specified personnel and leadership of any suspicious activity based on preset triggers. Such systems allow presetting of call clustering triggers to alert 9-1-1 of out-of-the-ordinary data observations based on standard dispatch interrogation and clinical coding system input.",

A study by Clawson et al. tested the hypothesis that appropriate performance feedback would increase dispatcher compliance with the protocol. The investigators examined how EMDs complied with the protocols contained in a dispatch system. Six key areas and overall compliance were studied. Dispatchers performed for two months without feedback and for a further two months with performance feedback. The mean overall compliance score improved from 76.4% 6 10.2% (mean 6 SD) in the absence of performance feedback to 96.2% 6 4.0% (n = 217; p , 0.001) when performance feedback was provided. Five of six key areas showed similar improvements. The investigators concluded that providing EMDs with regular and objective feedback regarding their performance dramatically improves how rigorously they follow a systematized dispatch protocol. 4 Dispatch will likely be the first point of contact in any incident. How dispatchers react depends on the balance between the need for information collection and the time constraints imposed by needing to act quickly and decisively. It is imperative that dispatchers relay information regarding the event and how to deal with it to responders and leaders. Information management must guard against the ''garbage in, garbage out'' problem. Data acquisition and analysis must be standardized and reproducible so that data between centers can be compared and preset thresholds can be used to screen for situations requiring more detailed analysis.",

The study compared the prospective identification of patients as ALS or basic life support (BLS) using emergency medical dispatch with that using dispatch criteria based on chief complaint. Each patient served as his or her own control. The ALS or BLS priority was assigned using both chief-complaint and emergency medical dispatch criteria. Dispatching based on chief complaint meant that all patients with preestablished chief complaints received ALS without further triage questions, whereas emergency medical dispatch allowed the dispatchers to question callers using a scripted set of questions. The outcome measures included the number of calls categorized as ALS or BLS, the number of calls canceled by BLS, and the number of ALS calls released to BLS care. There were 11,174 patients enrolled. The use of emergency medical dispatch was associated with a statistically significant decrease in the proportion of calls designated as ALS (44.7% vs. 55.8%), as well as a statistically significant decrease in the number of ALS responses canceled by BLS (9.2% vs. 23.8%) and patients released to BLS by medical control (4.7% vs. 7.3%). The investigators concluded that implementation of an emergency medical dispatch system significantly decreased inappropriate ALS dispatching, as defined by a decreased rate of ALS cancellations and BLS releases. 5 With bioterrorism a mounting threat, early detection of a possible ''stealth'' attack from agents such as smallpox or anthrax has become a national priority. Data provided from hospitals, laboratories, drug stores, schools, and the workplace must be integrated to facilitate detection of abnormal patterns. Homeland Security and public health officials have been seeking ways to detect trends representing possible outbreaks more quickly. However, current U.S. epidemiologic systems designed to identify public health trend changes cannot react as quickly as would be needed to preempt widespread inoculation.

Response plans must consider that, in addition to meeting emergency needs, the baseline needs of the communities must continue to be met during an event. This is particularly true when medical, surgical, or pediatric subspecialty care is required, as the numbers of skilled subspecialty providers available to any community are apt to be limited.",

Solutions might include using local stockpiles maintained by the hospital or other entities, borrowing from other facilities, purchasing from local retailers, or rapidly replenishing supplies via hospital vendors. As with hospital staff, administrators must be mindful that competition may exist for these additional equipment and supplies. Further, simply identifying a source for needed equipment and supplies may not be enough; transport and distribution within the facility should be considered.",

Therefore, as the outbreak develops and the disease spreads, it may make sense to treat patients using a wardstyle approach.

However, the chal-lenge is getting so many independent agencies from so many backgrounds to standardize. A possible solution may be to create a national agenda for the future on mass-casualty preparedness to guide these agencies. This may also include a disaster template for how to develop a community's capacity to respond to a disaster. Along with plan standardization, some consideration must be given to equipment standardization so that equipment can be used across agencies, because patients may be transported to a variety of receiving facilities and equipment may be brought in from outside agencies. Second, good communication and strong relationships are key to a successful disaster response. It is essential that agencies work together and know each other before a disaster occurs. These relationships can be built during disaster planning or practice drills. Maintaining communication during day-today operations, not just in the event of a disaster, also can enhance interagency relationships. Along with building relationships, jurisdictional issues need to be resolved, and mutual-aid infrastructure must be developed. For this to be accomplished, a clear leadership chain will need to be developed.",

A good strategy to begin the planning for future needs would include the use of the recommendations from the EMS Agenda for the Future 7 and to convene a national consensus panel for the purpose of establishing standards. A national template is needed that could be used by communities to achieve a fully interoperable response system. These strategies and the evaluation of best practices should be used to determine how funding dollars would be spent. Communities and national associations should be provided with a mechanism to allow feedback to policy makers at the federal level. Lastly, it is important to note that many of these changes could have a positive effect not only on a community's response to a mass-casualty incident, but also on its day-to-day operations.",

Properly train staff to use the new systems and technology, and to prepare for current working conditions that may be more stressful and demanding, given the increased threat of a terrorist attack. 4. Create a regional-based ''threat forecast,'' which would be updated as needed and reviewed annually by regional first-responder organizations. Funding and training levels could be guided by the threat forecast so that high-probability and high-impact threats are addressed. 5. Mandate multiagency training opportunities. Training should focus on establishing and maintaining critical linkages between law enforcement, EMS, and medical, public health, and emergency management.6. Develop threat-warning systems for first responders to enable them to use protective equipment at the earliest possible moment. 7. Obtain HIPPA exclusion for health issues related to national security, and cover reporters under ''Good Samaritan'' statutes. 8. Redesign the EMT curriculum to reflect current issues. 9. Assemble a consortium of first-responder agencies. Its tasks should include reviewing and suggesting revisions to federal legislation, as well as ensuring that future programs are designed to enable seamless response and maximum efficiency. 10. Create partnerships in acute care/emergency response with the community, the government, and the military. 11. Develop a national model for emergency response to help standardize response on a national scale. 12. Establish and mandate the use of standard language/terms among emergency responders. 13. Create national standards for training, equipment performance, and interoperability. 14. Develop reliable, real-time, two-way communication systems between hospitals, field providers, and public health for use during day-to-day operations, as well as during a disaster response. 15. Have communities determine hospital surge capacity as well as communitywide surge capacity. These plans should address each of the types of resources necessary for different types of disasters. Specifically, the plans should consider the types and amounts of equipment, supplies, beds, and personnel necessary to care for patients with trauma, burns, infectious diseases, chemical contamination, or inhalational injuries. 16. Develop plans for how the system will ''degrade gracefully'' in times of disaster; that is, which rules must be followed and which can be bent, including federal regulations. 17. Develop regional plans in addition to plans that are already in place for individual hospitals or agencies. Create a ''big picture'' plan that includes the entire region.",
