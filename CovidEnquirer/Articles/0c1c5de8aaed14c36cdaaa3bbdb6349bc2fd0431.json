            "text": "Science foresight comprises a range of methods to analyze past, present and expected research trends, and uses this information to predict the future status of different fields of science and technology. With the ability to identify high-potential development directions, science foresight can be a useful tool to support the management and planning of future research activities. Science foresight analysts can choose from a rather large variety of approaches. There is, however, relatively little information about how the various approaches can be applied in an effective way. This paper describes a three-step methodological framework for science foresight on the basis of published research papers, consisting of (i) life-cycle analysis, (ii) text mining and (iii) knowledge gap identification by means of automated clustering. The three steps are connected using the research methodology of the research papers, as identified by text mining. The potential of combining these three steps in one framework is illustrated by analyzing scientific literature on wind catchers; a natural ventilation concept which has received considerable attention from academia, but with quite low application in practice. The knowledge gaps that are identified show that the automated foresight analysis is indeed able to find uncharted research areas. Results from a sensitivity analysis further show the importance of using full-texts for text mining instead of only title, keywords and abstract. The paper concludes with a reflection on the methodological framework, and gives directions for its intended use in future studies.",

This issue manifests itself at different scales and plays a role in private companies and public authorities as well as academia. For example, individual scientists and research departments have a keen interest in spending their time and money in areas with potential for high impact (Kajikawa et al., 2008; Kostoff, 2008; Kostoff and Schaller, 2001; Leydesdorff et al., 1994; Ogawa and Kajikawa, 2015) . Likewise, (inter)national governmental institutions seek to establish policy instruments (e.g. legislation and funding schemes) that give priority to development and application of innovative solutions with the highest positive contribution for society (Coccia, 2009; Kidwell, 2013) .",

Making well-informed decisions requires detailed knowledge of past findings and current trends, and a deep understanding of emerging technology pathways (Leydesdorff et al., 1994; Yoon and Park, 2005) . At the same time, it asks for a broad perspective to oversee future needs while identifying the opportunities that arise in neighboring research domains. The context in which such decisions are made is becoming increasingly complex because traditional science and engineering domains are getting more and more interconnected (Morillo et al., 2003; Porter and Rafols, 2009) . In addition, the information that is documented in patents, reports and research papers continues to grow in size at an exponential rate (Kajikawa et al., 2008; Kostoff and Schaller, 2001; Larsen and Von Ins, 2010; Bengisu and Nekhili, 2006) . The availability of input for research and technology planning can therefore be perceived as overwhelming, especially for decision-makers who are new to the field. The inability to properly analyze and comprehend all this information may lead to wrong recommendations and suboptimal priorities in research and development agendas.",

The literature on science foresight covers a wide variety of qualitative and quantitative means for monitoring clues and indicators of evolving trends and developments (Coates, 1985) . To facilitate successful science foresight analyses, it is clear that the methodology needs to be matched with e.g., the purpose of the study, the size and quality of the database, and the type of output that is expected. However, the available information about the relative effectiveness of different science foresight methods is very limited, and it is therefore difficult to support such decisions. In addition, most methods perform well at some, but typically not all aspects of science foresight. The potential of combining the positive sides of different science foresight methods into one overall framework has so far remained relatively unexplored.",

Although we aim at wider applicability, in this paper, the framework is developed and demonstrated with respect to wind catchers; a sustainable natural ventilation system for buildings. This topic was specifically chosen because it is manageable in scope and size (i.e. the veracity of the results can be checked), yet has experienced a complex development history, is an active field with mixed research methods, and has a non-trivial future outlook. This paper uses a combination of existing methods: life-cycle analysis, text mining and cluster analysis, but combines them in a novel way that has not been described before. Given the importance of the impact of textual data on the accuracy of text mining, a sensitivity analysis is also carried out for three cases, when (i) title, (ii) title, abstract and keywords, and (iii) full-text of the papers are considered as the textual data. This evaluation is based on the methodology of the research papers. This paper continues by describing the development of a methodological framework for science foresight on the basis of life-cycle analysis, text mining and cluster analysis (Section 2). The sensitivity analysis is also presented in this section. Characteristics of wind catchers, the topic of the application study, are introduced in Section 3. In Section 4, this methodology is applied in the case of wind catchers, to describe the status of research in this field, predict future trends and identify knowledge gaps in order to identify possible opportunities for new research and development activities. In Section 5, a reflection on the methodological framework and its potential in future studies is given.",

Ernst (Ernst, 1997) suggests that the accumulation of patent applications is useful for measuring technology trends. The evolution over time can be plotted as S-shape curve to represent its technology life-cycle. There are four stages in a technology life cycle: introduction, growth, maturity and saturation (Ernst, 1997) . During the introduction stage, there is a little growth in the number of patent applications. The growth stage, on the other hand, is characterized by exponential growth. As the patent application rate declines, the maturity stage is entered. The saturation stage indicates limited growth with only few additional patent applications (Trappey et al., 2011a) .",

For example, it has been widely adopted to explore the complex relationships among scientific documents (de Miranda Santo et al., 2006; Singh et al., 2007) . A main theme supporting text mining is the transformation of text into numerical data. This transformation uses statistical methods to convert text mining into a classical data mining encoding. Despite the inability to explicitly understand linguistic concepts such as grammar or word meaning, statistical text mining has proven remarkably successful (Weiss et al., 2010) . Many projects have used different techniques of statistical text mining in various fields of science or technology. In these studies, the full-text or abstract of papers or patents are considered as the database. Table 1 provides an overview of previous studies in which different techniques of text mining were implemented in science and/or technology.",

This is important for further analysis because without identifying the tokens, it is difficult to imagine extracting higher-level information from the document. Therefore, the textual data is analyzed to identify all the words and phrases in the papers. Once the papers have been segmented into a sequence of tokens, the next step is to convert each of the tokens to a standard form. In English, as in many other languages, words occur in text in more than one form. Often, but not always, it is advantageous to eliminate this kind of variation before further processing. When the normalization is confined to regularizing grammatical variants such as singular/plural and present/past, the process is called stemming (Weiss et al., 2010) . After the process of stemming, the extracted words and phrases, are filtered by the experts to define the most relevant and meaningful keywords. These keywords are used to make a dictionary.

This approach is useful to identify the existing themes or sub-fields. In order to find the knowledge gaps efficiently, experts' opinion is needed to consider all aspects of a scientific field, even those that are not explicitly mentioned in research papers. An ontology tree, or hierarchy, can help the experts specify a general overview of a scientific field. This hierarchy specifies the relationships between concepts and is used to extract meaningful words and phrases from the papers. Since generating a hierarchy is domain specific, experts must select the keywords and phrases related to this technology. In this study, the hierarchy is generated based on experts' opinion. Using the keywords that were automatically extracted from the papers, experts were able to generate this hierarchy easier. Note that the experts are allowed to add, remove and replace keywords during this step. To make the technology hierarchy, the method presented by Yoon and Park (Yoon and Park, 2005) is used. They used this method to generate a technology tree and transform it into a morphology box. This method helps to break a complex problem or technology into several parts (dimensions), so that it can be analyzed more easily. In the present study, three sections are considered: \"Procedural\", \"Structural\" and \"Application\". The \"Procedural\" section deals with the aspects related to the methodology of the papers. The \"Structural\" section addresses the different features of a technology and the factors affecting its performance. The \"Application\" section is related to the function of this technology in various sectors. Using this method, also the aspects that have not yet been taken into consideration in existing studies are included in the hierarchy. It can also be useful to find all relevant keywords that could help to find the knowledge gaps more efficiently.",

Regarding the fact that each paper can have a different number of pages and words, it is reasonable to conclude that the size of a paper and the average number of words, can affect the frequency of the keywords. As a remedy, this study used the method proposed by Trappey et al. (2011b) , which normalizes the weights for the frequency of key phrases by the number of words in each document. The function normalized TF-IDF or NTF approach is expressed by Eq. (4) where tf ik is the number of key phrases i in document k, WN k is the number of words in document k, n is the total number of documents in the document set, and df i is the number of documents of key phrase i in the document set. With this function, the effect of the size of a paper can be eliminated (Trappey et al., 2010) . . A correlation between a set of data is a measure of how well and to which extent they are related. The correlation between keywords of documents has been used in many studies for clustering and discovering the relationship between the keywords. In these studies, the correlation, similarity or cooccurrence are calculated between all dictionary keywords (Dubari\u0107 et al., 2011; de Miranda Santo et al., 2006; Trappey et al., 2011a; Daim et al., 2006; Andrade and Bork, 2000) . In the present study, however, the research methodology of each paper is used as the clustering variables. Using this method, the correlation of each research methodology with dictionary keywords can be determined, which is important to support effective research planning.

In addition, the knowledge gaps can also be identified, by analyzing cases where there is no high co-occurrence or correlation between the research methodology and dictionary keywords. In the interpretation of the knowledge gaps, it is particularly interesting to link these findings back to the evolution of research methodologies, as identified through the combination of text mining and life cycle analysis. Therefore, after normalizing the frequency of the keywords, the correlation between these keywords and the keywords related to the methodology of the papers, are measured with the Pearson correlation coefficient as shown in Table 3 . Note that the keywords related to each methodology are determined by the experts. For each methodology, the total frequency of all related keywords is used as an input for the correlation measurement. This measurement is based on the keywords' co-occurrence with the methodology keywords in each paper. In Table 3 KP represents the keywords or key phrases and R i,j is the correlation between keyword i, and the group of keywords related to methodology j. 2.2.2.4.2. Clustering. Clustering is a statistical approach for classification of patterns into groups based on similarities of internal features or characteristics. K-means is a common clustering algorithm that has been used in a wide variety of applications to partition a data set into K groups (de Miranda Santo et al., 2006; Chemchem and Drias, 2015) . To do so, the user must assign a number K as the expected number of clusters. Since the centroids of clusters are randomly chosen, the algorithm must repeat many times to adjust centroids and can only achieve locally optimal clustering results. The optimal number of clusters is defined by the experts after analyzing the result of clustering with different numbers. So choosing the best clusters is an expert-based procedure. In addition, to verify the authenticity of the experts' opinion, the Davies-Bouldin index (Bezdek and Pal, 1998 ) is used.",

Natural ventilation strategies have the potential to become a viable alternative for energy-intensive air-conditioning systems, but new approaches are needed to lead to wider adoption. Inspiration for new concepts can be found by looking at traditional design strategies such as the \"wind catcher\", which was used to provide natural ventilation and passive cooling in hot and arid regions of Iran and neighboring countries (Saadatian et al., 2012) . The cooling performance of both ancient and modern wind catchers has been analyzed and optimized by several researchers, using experimental, computational or analytical methods (Saadatian et al., 2012; Montazeri and Azizian, 2009; Montazeri, 2011; Montazeri and Azizian, 2008; Montazeri et al., 2010; Bahadori et al., 2008; Soutullo et al., 2011; Hassan and Lee, 2014; Su et al., 2008; Calautit et al., 2013; Calautit et al., 2014) . In addition to academic contexts, industry has also paid attention to the development of these systems. These technology transfer activities have led to the invention of multiple new commercial wind catcher systems that meet the requirements of modern-day building design (Hughes et al., 2012) . However, considering the relatively slow uptake in practice, it can be argued that further research and development is still needed to fully utilize the potential of wind catchers.",

            "text": "The keywords are clustered with the K-means algorithm, based on their correlation and co-occurrence with internal characteristics of the papers. In this study, clustering has been performed based on the research methodology of the papers. Research on wind catchers is usually performed using (i) full-scale measurements, (ii) wind-tunnel Bahadori (1994) measurements, (iii) CFD simulations and (iv) Building Performance Simulation (BPS), Air Flow Network (AFN) and analytical methods. In this study, therefore, the clusters are determined based on these four research methodologies as the clustering variables. After analyzing the clusters with different numbers of K, nine clusters were chosen to be the optimal number of clusters according to the experts' opinion. To verify the authenticity of the experts' opinion, it was also verified using the Davies-Bouldin (DB) index. This index is a function of the sum of within-cluster variance to between-cluster-center distances. The appropriate number of clusters is indicated by the minimum value of the DB index (Bezdek and Pal, 1998; Wu et al., 2013) . The results are presented in Table 5 for different numbers of clusters. It can be seen that K = 9 is superior with DBI = 2.97. By analyzing the relationship between the keywords in each cluster and the correlation between these keywords and the methodology of the papers, characteristics of each cluster are defined by the experts. The nine clusters including all keywords are presented in Table 6 . Note that the number of clusters greatly depends on the number of clustering variables. The total number of clusters reflects how the keywords in the dictionary keywords have been investigated from a methodological point of view. Depending on the strength of co-occurrence and correlation between keywords and research methodologies, different scenarios can be distinguished. These scenarios are therefore an aggregation of possible cases. Given the clustering results, four possible scenarios can be considered for research on a specific keyword: a) There is a high correlation between the keyword and a single research methodology. This scenario indicates that only one research methodology has been used to investigate the keyword. In this study, the total number of possible clusters for this scenario is 4 clusters (WT, FS, CFD, and BPS, AFN & AN). In total, 26 out of 57 keywords in the dictionary keywords have been investigated using only one methodology. b) There is a high correlation between the keyword and multiple research methodologies. In this case, the keyword has been investigated using a combination of two or more research methodologies, in which the keyword has a high correlation with all those research methodologies, and no correlation with others. In this study, the total number of possible clusters for this scenario is 11 (WT + FS, WT + CFD, WT + BPS, AFN & AN, etc.). Clusters 5, 6 and 8 have been identified in this category. The results show that 20 keywords have been investigated using two or three research methodologies. c) There is a low correlation between the keyword and one methodology but high correlation with multiple research methodologies. Cluster 7 represents this scenario. It comprises keywords that have been investigated using two or more research methodologies (three in this case), in which the correlation between the keywords and at least one of the research methodologies is significantly lower than the other methodologies in the cluster, but not zero. Out of many possible combinations, only one such cluster was identified in this study. Such a moderate correlation indicates that a trend is certainly discernible, but that the correlation is less pronounced than is the case for the two previous scenarios. In the present case, it is interesting to observe that keywords in cluster 6 (belonging to the second scenario) can all be characterized as 'structural', following the classification introduced in Section 2.2.2.2.2. Keywords in cluster 7 are connected to the same research methodologies as cluster 6, but can be connected to either 'procedure' or 'application'. d) The correlation between the keyword and the four research methodologies is zero. It indicates that no significant research on this combination has taken place yet. Keywords in cluster 9 belong to this scenario.",

The results show that wind-tunnel measurements mainly have been used to investigate the aerodynamic characteristics of wind catchers (Clusters 1 and 6). In recent years, wind-tunnel measurement and CFD studies are used in a complementary way, as the accuracy and reliability of CFD are of concern, and validation studies are normally performed using wind-tunnel measurement data (e.g. Montazeri et al., 2010; Ghadiri et al., 2013) .

Therefore, keywords like \"wind direction\" do not occur in this cluster because of its limited control over the boundary conditions. The reason of occurrence of the phrases \"evaporative cooing\" and \"water spray\" with full-scale measurement is related to the complexity involved in the two-phase flow in water sprays as the evaporation process depends on several physical parameters that are not easily varied independently (Montazeri et al., 2015a; Montazeri et al., 2015b) .",

Another characteristic feature of this group of methods is the fact that thermal considerations, instead of aerodynamic effects, can easily be taken into account in the analysis. It is for this reason that, key words such as \"conduction\", \"temperature\" and \"radiation\" are strongly correlated to BPS, AFN and analytical methods.

In this study, clusters with co-occurrence or correlation with the research methodology and dictionary keywords (Clusters 1 to 8) can be useful for researchers to identify how different research methodologies have been used. This can therefore result in choosing more appropriate research methodologies for a specific application. For example, research on the impact of evaporative cooling in enhancing the cooling performance of wind catchers has been performed using full-scale measurements. Given the advantages of CFD, the results of the current study suggests the possibility of using CFD as a powerful tool for the investigation of water spray systems in wind catchers. It is expected that the results by CFD will lead to new insights and information that could not have been obtained with full-scale measurements. c. In some occasions, different research methodologies are used in a complementary way. For example, Clusters 1 and 2 provide useful information on whether experimental data (e.g. full-scale or wind tunnel) is available in the literature for validating the mathematical models developed for a specific application. For example, windtunnel data for three-sided, six-sided and twelve-sided wind catchers (Cluster 1), and full-scale data for water spray systems in wind catchers (Cluster 2).",
