Many patients who in the 1950s and in the early part of the 1960s would have died of cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic, gastrointestinal, or oncologic problems can be saved through the use of new pharmacologic agents or a variety of life support devices. This progress in medicine has at the same time added a new dimension to the problem of hospital-acquired, or nosocomial, infection.",

            "text": "The word nosocomial was first used in 1940 by Joyce Wright in a paper discussing streptococcal infection in children's wards in London. 1 Nosocomial infections in the past were defined as those diagnosed within 48 hours after admission. It may be more proper to define nosocomial infections as those that are neither present nor incubating at the time of admission, since it is now recognized that a number of infections such as hepatitis, sternal wound infections, or fungal infections may be acquired in the hospital yet may not be recognized until long incubation periods have passed. Data presented by Allen et al. 2 at the Second International Conference on Nosocomial Infections, held in August 1980, indicated that the nosocomial infection rate, which was 341 per 10,000 patients discharged in 1975, had declined to 329 per 10,000 patients in 1979. Infection rates for community-teaching and municipal hospitals declined from 1970 to 1979, whereas those for community and university hospitals did not decline. There has been in the past decade, and continuing to the present, a decline in the rate of surgical wound infection, whereas infections on other services have increased. Of interest, there was an increase in bacteremia in the decade of the 1970s. Observations at our own institution suggest that bacteremia has continued to be a significant problem, and that other forms of infection have remained at a level similar to the level of the previous decade, despite improvements in infection control within the hospital.",

            "text": "The distribution of endemic nosocomial infections occurring in the hospital has remained fairly stable for the past decade. Urinary tract infections account for 35%-40% of infections, surgical wounds for 25%-30%, pneumonia for 15%-20%, skin structure infections for 5%-10%, bacter-emia for 5%, and other forms of infection for about 5%-10%. Although great progress has been made in the past two decades in improving urinary catheter care with the institution of closed drainage systems, urinary tract infections related to instrumentation of the urinary bladder continue to be a major kind of nosocomial infection. 3 The same may be said for respiratory tract infections. 4 There has been a marked increase in the use of respiratory support systems in patients who would have succumbed to pulmonary insufficiency in previous years. Although problems associated with contaminated respiratory care equipment are distinctly less frequent today than they were in the 1960s, nonetheless, nosocomial pneumonitis remains a major cause of death in hospitalized patients. ~' 6 The pathogens causing nosocomial infections have not significantly changed in the past decade. Escherichia coli is still the most frequent organism isolated in approximately 20% of infections with Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci both being encountered in about 10% of infections, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 9% to 10% and Klebsiella infections and Proteus infections in about 7% to 8%. The frequency of Klebsiella infections and Proteus infections has declined to some extent in recent years, whereas there has been an increase in the number of infections caused by Enterobacter species and Serratia marcescens. One change in the organisms causing infections has been in the antimicrobial susceptibilities. There has been an increase in resistance to first-generation cephalosporins among organisms such as Klebsiella and E. coli, and organisms such as Serratia and Enterobacter have shown resistance both to aminoglycosides and to fourth-$eneration penicillins and third-generation cephalosporins. ~ Analysis of epidemics of nosocomial infections is difficult since epidemics usually involve infection by unusual organisms or particularly resistant organisms. Stamm et al. s noted that epidemics accounted for a small proportion of preventable infections acquired in the hospital, but epidemics have been extremely useful in defining the modes of spread, the source, and the methods to prevent and to control nosocomial infections. The pathogens involved in epidemics have been primarily S. aureus, Klebsiella, Salmonella, hepatitis B, Pseudomonas, and group A streptococci (Table 1) . Although urinary tract infections are a common form of nosocomial epidemic infections, gastroenteritis, skin infections, bacteremia, meningitis, and hepatitis are more frequently involved, since these are the infections for which the aid of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has been sought to solve the problem of infectious epidemics.",

Acinetobacter has been considered to be a relatively avirulent organism, although it has definite pathogenic potential. It has been associated with a wide variety of illnesses in debilitated, hospitalized patients. 9 RespiratSry tract infection in intensive care patients has been the most common problem associated with Acinetobacter infection. Buxton et al., 1\u00b0 investigating an outbreak in Connecticut, found that one third of hospital personnel in an intensive care unit had transient hand colonization with multiple strains of Acinetobacter. Pharyngeal, vaginal, and rectal carriage was rare, however. Gram-negative bacilli generally are a transient rather than a resident flora on the hands of most individuals. In epidemic periods, hands of personnel may transmit gramnegative bacilli from patient to patient, but most bacteria persist for less than 24 hours on the hands. In the presence of dermatologic disease, however, organisms can persist for a much longer period. In the outbreak studied by Buxton et al., dermatitis involving the hands of a respiratory therapist probably predisposed him to persistent colonization of Acinetobacter. The personnel and patients remained a reservoir of Acinetobacter, causing continued cross-contamination of respiratory therapy equipment and infection of intubated patients in the intensive care unit. In another outbreak studied by Cunha et al., 11 Acinetobacter pulmonary infections were traced to Wright respirometers. Over a 30-day period, Acinetobacter accounted for hospital-acquired pneumonia in ten patients and colonized the upper respiratory tract in an additional nine patients. The Wright respirometer acted as a means of aerosolizing fluid into the lung.",

Ramphal and Kluge 9 reported on 13 patients who acquired the organism from the hospital environment and who then developed bacteremia. Conversely, pseudobacteremia with false positive blood cultures has also occurred with Acinetobacter. Syndman et al. 12 reported that children in mist tents had blood cultures positive for Acinetobacter, probably as the result of contamination of the hands of respiratory therapy technicians and blood-drawing personnel. However, children did have colonization of the skin and nose with the organism, and hence would be at risk for development of infection. Contamination of materials has also resulted in an outbreak of Acinetobacter infection associated with peritoneal dialysis. Abrutyn et al. 13 found that over a 4-month period, 14 patients had fluid cultures positive for A. calcoaceticus in dialysis drainage. A water bath used to warm bottles of peritoneal dialysate was the reservoir of the bacteria, and the dialysate became contaminated when the prong of the fluid administration set was inserted through the rubber bung on the dialysis models. This outbreak illustrates the potential importance of environmental reservoirs in infections complicating peritoneal dialysis. In several of these Acinetobacter outbreaks a seasonal incidence was noted, with the organism more frequently isolated during summer months. ~t This would be in keeping with its occurrence on the skin of personnel or in water solutions.",

Legionella is found in the soil and natural water sources. 17 In nature it appears to be associated both \u2022 18 with blue-green algae and with amebae. Although the organisms grow quite well in natural water sources, they also seem to have a great predilection for man-made hot water systems.

There may also be diarrhea, obtundation, hematuria, and impaired liver function. Factors that may suggest that the pneumonia is caused by Legionella are prior corticosteroid medication, lack of symptoms of upper respiratory tract involvement, negative routine bacterial cultures, and failure to respond to therapy with ~-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics. Pleuritic chest pain has been noted to be a frequent problem in individuals with Legionnaires' disease, and the course of illness is often complicated by acute renal failure, refractory hypoxemia, and, in some patients, the development of pulmonary abscesses.

The precise way Legionella is transmitted to patients is unknown. It is clear, however, that showerheads frequently contain Legionella and can aerosolize Legionella to patients.24, 25 Cordes and colleagues 26 investigated the showerheads in a hospital ward in Chicago where three patients had contracted Legionnaires' disease and found that nine of 16 showerheads were positive for the organism. Each patient had used one of these showers 2-10 days before the onset of symptoms. One problem with these investigations is that showerheads in hospital wards where patients have not contracted Legionnaires' disease also yield L. pneumophila. Aerosolized tap water from respiratory devices also has been a source of nosocomial Legionella pneumoniaY Tap water in respiratory devices has been reported as a mechanism of transmission of Legionella, and there has appeared to be an association between the disease and drinking tap water. 16 However, recent studies have shown the ubiquity of Legionella in water systems of hospitals and hotels.",

In the past, this was extremely difficult since diagnosis was characteristically based on serologic titers, which were not available until 3 weeks after the infection developed. It is now feasible to grow Legionella in media available in most microbiology laboratories, with isolation of the organism within several days of submission of a specimen. Thus, development of an unexplained pneumonia in a patient with a hematologic malignancy, and particularly in patients with renal transplants, cardiac transplants, or bone marrow transplants, from whom no microorganisms are isolated, should prompt an attempt to isolate Legionella. Once sputum or bronchial samples are obtained for culture for Legionella, it seems reasonable to begin a chemotherapeutic trial of erythromycin, since this antibiotic is infrequently utilized as initial therapy in these kinds of patients but has proved to be quite effective in the treatment of Legionella infection. Once Legionella is diagnosed, the patient's environment should be carefully evaluated to prevent further episodes occurring within the hospital. The development of several cases should cause one to ensure that patients at high risk avoid any aerosolized water while the potable water and shower systems and air conditioning are being evaluated.

Infection caused by corynebacteria characteristically follows a break in a skin barrier where the organism may cause infection, either singly or with other agents. Characteristic sites of infection have been intravenous (IV) catheter insertion sites, bone marrow biopsy sites, adhesive tape removal sites, or sites of skin wounds of other types. These organisms also have the ability to cause endocarditis. A combination of prolonged granulocytopenia together with a break in mucocutaneous barriers, such as that incurred in the placement of a Hickman or Broviac catheter, sets the stage for infection by these organisms.

This nurse used handcreams and plastic gloves overnight, maintaining the Citrobacter around the sites of rings. Removal of the hand carrier resulted in elimination of neonatal colonization and decreased the number of other enteric bacteria found on umbilical stumps.

The outbreak was traced to contamination of the calibration device used on the pressure monitoring system and the sensor surfaces of transducers used in the system. Although the transducer membrane was intact, reflux of fluid into the monitoring line occurred, resulting in the contamination. Sterilization of the transducers and revision of the calibration device abruptly terminated the outbreak. Other organisms have contaminated pressure dome devices, and the appearance of an unusual organism in patients in whom these devices are used should suggest the possibility of contamination. 69 Conversely, Semel et al. reported a P. maltophilia pseudosepticemia outbreak. During a 17-month period, 25 hospitalized adult patients had blood cultures positive for P. maltophilia. Review of the patient's hospital records showed that these organisms were contaminants and that blood for coagulation studies and for cultures that were subsequently positive had been drawn simultaneously. The source of the contamination was the black-top evacuated collection tubes used for coagulation studies in adults. Inoculation of contaminated black-top tubes prior to the inoculation of blood culture bottles would yield false positive blood cultures, hence, pseudosepticemia. However, one patient undergoing therapy for streptococcal infection of a prosthetic heart valve, who had frequent coagulation studies done, was found at autopsy to have superinfection of the prosthetic heart valve with P. maltophilia. Presumably, infection occurred after reflux of contaminated anticoagulant from the evacuated collection tube into the vein. Thus, contaminated collection tubes are a potential source of confusion in the diagnosis of infection as well as a potential source of true infection.",

It is generally accepted that the incidence of infection following orthopedic and vascular surgical procedures can be reduced by administering antibiotics at the time of the procedure. Brief use of a cephalosporin antibiotic on the day of the surgery generally does not result in an increase in methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis. However, prolonged use of a cephalosporin or the penicillinase-resistant semisynthetic penicillins as prophylaxis in orthopedic or cardiac procedures will cause proliferation of methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, which will produce more nosocomial infections.",

Six of the patients had received a renal transplant. N. asteroides could be isolated from air and dust within the unit and elsewhere within the hospital. Biochemical and metabolic and immunologic examination of isolates indicated that those from the patients and from the environment were identical and different from the most common type of human Nocardia strains. Both of these reports suggest that, indeed, immunocompromised patients should not be in the same environment as individuals from whom Nocardia can be isolated. On the other hand, there are no data to indicate that routine environmental surveillance for Nocardia would be required in renal transplant units or in oncology units handling patients with Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The reports do suggest, however, that following the appearance of a case in a patient who has been in the hospital for a considerable period of time, it would be wise to do some form of environmental sampling. Candida glabrata, formerly called Torulopsis glabrata, has also been recognized as an important cause of fungemia from IV catheters and to produce genitourinary infections on a nosocomial basis. Most of the patients who are infected with C. glabrata have had recent antibiotic therapy and surgery, and many are immunosuppressed. TM This organism has caused endocarditis, endophthalmitis, and disseminated infection. 132 Colonization with the fungus appears to be the primary problem leading to the nosocomial infection when the clinical setting provides the fungus access to body areas from which it is normally excluded. 47 ",

Since viral infections of the respiratory tract are so frequent in small children, it is inevitable that a number of children admitted to a hospital may be shedding the virus asymptomatically. It is also important to understand that viral nosocomial infections of the respiratory tract do not necessarily occur more often in immunocompromised children than in normal children.

RSv is the most important cause of lower respiratory tract disease in the first several years of life. The characteristics of the virus that allow it to cause nosocomial infection are (1) the frequent winter or spring outbreaks, (2) the susceptibility of persons in all age groups (with reinfections common throughout life), (3) an immunity of short duration, and (4) the fact that infants admitted with RSv bronchiolitis or pneumonia shed large amounts of the virus for long periods of time, and provide the focus for nosocomial spread of the virus. Despite use of infection control procedures, such as gown-changing, handwashing, and isolation of high-risk patients, nevertheless, in outbreaks of RSv, 26%-38% of patients have developed nosocomial infections with pneumonia, and case-fatality rates have ranged from 7% to 17%. Furthermore, 34%-56% of staff have become infected. Unfortunately, RSv can be communicated both by large droplets or by self-inoculation of contaminated secretions. Hall and colleagues 137 evaluated methods to control the spread of RSv in the infant wards during a community outbreak of infection with the organism. Infants were divided into cohorts and were isolated, with strict attention to handwashing and the use of gowns. Staff who attended the ill infants were also divided into cohorts. Nineteen percent of infants acquired nosocomial RSV disease. Three of 80 developed pneumonia, and one died as a result. Some 56% of 43 staff members became infected, and 82% became symptomatic. Furthermore, four staff members acquired repeated infections after the initial infection. Previous studies from this institution had revealed that 45% of infants, and 42% of staff, in contact with infected infants would acquire nosocomial RSv infections.137, 13s To some extent procedures of isolation will reduce the transmission of RSv to infants, but they do not appear to be very effective with staff, who are often infected by close contact with the infants.

Indeed, on the hand, the virus has a shorter survival--one-half hour--than it does on gloves used for iaolation. Studies have indicated that staff who cuddle infected infants or touch contaminated surfaces became infected with RSv. Unfortunately, control of nosocomial spread of RSv has not proved successful, even with division of infants into cohorts and limiting patient contact. However, it is clear that handwashing is extremely important. It seems that the major reason for wearing a mask when handling RSv patients is that it prevents one from touching one's nose with one's hands and therefore spreading the infection to personnel, who would then spread it to other infants 14\u00b0. Unfortunately, immunization against RSv is not possible at present. Eriksson and colleagues 141 have shown that RSv may be detected rapidly by immunofluorescence studies. With early detection it may be possible to plan the care of the patient and the personnel in an optimal way to avoid or to maintain nosocomial infection at a low level. It is extremely important that personnel understand that environmental conditions with RSv may permit survival of the virus on their surfaces and skin and that through selfinoculation they will contaminate their nasal surfaces and become infected.",

It has recently been recognized as an important pathogen producing serious diarrheal disease in patients with AIDS. It is well known that veterinarians can become infected with Cryptosporidium, and outbreaks of diarrheal disease with this organism have occurred in veterinary schools. One must be extremely careful in handling stool specimens from patients with diarrhea caused by Cryptosporidium. To date, no major nosocomial outbreaks have been recorded, but it seems likely that we will see nosocomial infections with this interesting parasite. Person-to-person transmission of Cryptosporidium has been reported from Great Britain, where a nurse contracted the disease from a child who was infected. 158a",

Scabies affects persons of all ages but it is more common in children in underdeveloped countries. 1~7 It has been a problem in nursing homes, hospitals, and mental institutions. ~58 Gooch et al. 1~9 reported on a nosocomial outbreak of scabies in a 558-bed teaching hospital. There had been reports of scabies throughout Michigan for a year prior to the outbreak. There was an epidemic spread of scabies from a patient to 38 hospital employees and their families and associates. Patients admitted to hospitals from shelters or from nursing facilities in which care is suboptimal may be contaminated with scabies. Unexplained cutaneous lesions compatible with irritation because of infestation with this organism should alert hospital personnel to the problem. There is pruritus, most severe at night. Careful microscopic examination of lesions and microscopic examination of the parasite will identify the problem.",

Major improvements in sanitation and hygiene caused a marked reduction in many community-acquired infections. We have seen the reduction in certain nosocomial infections through strict decontamination of respiratory care equipment, urinary catheters, and vascular catheters. However, some infections in hospitalized patients will not decline as rapidly in the coming decade. The reason is that serious infection, particularly nosocomial infection, in the critically ill patient frequently is different from infection acquired within the community. Infections in the hospital are not just the result of failure in infection control, but of acquisition of bacteria, fungi, or viruses that cause infection or invade the host during procedures carried out to maintain life. The body whose mucocutaneous defenses are bypassed by IV or urethral catheters is much more vulnerable to invasion by pathogens. Therefore, we shall continue to see nosocomial urinary and vascular infections caused by gram-negative organisms and fungi. New bacteria will appear, as noted in this monograph. We know that gram-negative bacteria have surface structures that allow them to adhere to respiratory, gastrointestinal, and uroepithelial cells. The healthy individual is less readily colonized by bacteria or staphylococci. Colonization preceds invasion and infection. The healthy individual may have only a transient bacteremia from an improperly cared-for catheter, whether vascular or urologic, and he or she will be rid of the organism. But patients in intensive care units or individuals with underlying neurologic disease frequently will suffer serious nosocomial infection.",

We shall continue to see outbreaks of RSV, parainfluenza virus, and influenza virus in both pediatric and adult patient care settings. New pathogens such as Legionella and Aspergillus have become significant problems in some institutions. Rapid recognition of the problem and institution of measures to improve water supplies or decrease dissemination of fungal spores will halt such outbreaks. A better understanding of the microbiologic and pathophysiologic aspects of unusual infections acquired in the hospital should aid us in developing more rational approaches to infection. It is hoped that this discussion has provided information to the physician about the less common and more unusual forms of nosocomial disease.",

Three patients subsequently developed Listeria septicemia. The mechanism of transmission of the infection was not elucidated. Filice et al. TM reported an outbreak of L. monocytogenes infection in seven neonates in a hospital in Greenville, South Carolina. Although nosocomial transmission was not proved, the cause of the large number of cases in a short period of time was never established. Stamm et al. 1\u00b01a reported an outbreak among renal transplant patients. L. monocytogenes can colonize the intestine, which may lead to nosocomial infection. If there is a patient in a transplant unit excreting the organism in stool, he or she may be a hazard to other patients. Several of our patients have excreted Listeria in stool long after the successful treatment of meningitis and bacteremia. Most physicians and health care workers are aware of the risk of spread of Neisseria meningitidis.

These patterns are primarily those of a patchy bronchopneumonia; occasionally there is lobar involvement or a miliary pattern. Multiple sites are involved, and lesions tend to be in the periphery of the lung. Unfortunately, sputum specimens are rarely diagnostic for Aspergillus, and the diagnosis can be made most effectively by bronchoscopy with brushing and biopsy, if the patient's platelet level and clotting indices permit. Blood cultures are virtually never positive for Aspergillus in this setting. Certainly nasal specimens should be obtained for culture, and since Legionnaires' pneumonia, which is easily treated with erythromycin, can produce a similar picture, it should be excluded by proper culture techniques. Although a number of serologic tests have been advocated for the diagnosis of Aspergillus infection, in general they have not proved to be highly effective. Therapy for AspergiUus pulmonary infections is with amphotericin B. None of the other antifungal agents is active against Aspergillus. The proper dose and duration of therapy are not established. Thus, clinical indices such as defervescence and radiographic clearing are the best indicators of response.",

Muder and colleagues 19 eliminated nosocomial legionellosis by periodically heating the water to 77 \u00b0 C. If this technique is used, one must make sure that patients or personnel do not develop burns from the water. Hyperchlorination is successful in eliminating L. pneumophila from a water system but it causes erosion of the pipes and is exceedingly difficult to achieve in a complicated system. Indeed, it may be necessary to install chlorinators at the outlet of the hot water tank in order to achieve adequate chlorine levels. All plumbing would have to be flushed following an outbreak, since in the Iowa City episode, Legionella was isolated from two vacant rooms in which the water had not been flushed for at least 14 days. 2\u00b0 IfLegionella is not found in the water system, it is important to examine the air intakes of rooms in which patients have developed infection by Legionella, since one outbreak clearly was associated with air intake near a cooling tower contaminated with Legionella. 21 Wound infection due to L. pneumophila group 4 has been",
