The infl uenza epidemic started in January 2008 and peaked in late February, but the 2-week school closure did not begin until March 12. Consequently, the school-based epidemic was on the decline by the time offi cials closed schools. Other studies have suggested that early school closures can help reduce infl uenza illness in the community and among school children, especially during a pandemic (2-6). However, surveillance systems that rely on school absenteeism or deaths would likely provide information too late during the outbreak for school closure to effectively reduce infl uenza transmission.",

Specifi cally, CDC recommends rapidly initiating activities such as advising sick persons to stay home, dismissing children from schools, closing childcare facilities, and initiating further social distancing measures within a state or a community at the beginning of the upslope of a pandemic wave (acceleration interval), i.e., when cases are initially identifi ed and community transmission begins to occur (8). We concur with the authors that the 2007-08 infl uenza season was already waning by the time the decision was made to close schools (deceleration interval).",

Socially disruptive measures like early school closure and keeping children from congregating in the community would likely reduce community transmission of pandemic disease, but would also create secondary challenges (9,10). Therefore, to ensure maximal benefi t for reducing disease transmission, interventions should be implemented early and concomitantly with other nonpharmaceutical and pharmaceutical measures, accompanied by public education, and used judiciously based on pandemic severity. In Response: We agree with Koonin and Cetron (1) that early application of any intervention during an infl uenza epidemic or pandemic is critical in maximizing population health benefi ts. Further, the longer an intervention is sustained, the greater the likely benefi t.",

In our analysis of the effect of school closures in Hong Kong, we used a simple statistical technique (3) to estimate the underlying reproductive number. Changes in the epidemic curve may lag behind changes in the underlying transmission dynamics by at least 1 serial interval, as has previously been shown for severe acute respiratory syndrome (3) (4) (5) . Public health practitioners must be encouraged to use these methods routinely.",
