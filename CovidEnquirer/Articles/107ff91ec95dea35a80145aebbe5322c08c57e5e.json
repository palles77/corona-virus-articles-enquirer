Samples were also collected from adults who were categorized as healthcare workers, members of the general population seen in the emergency room, and renal transplant outpatients. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Sao Paulo Federal University and written consent was obtained from all patients or those responsible for the individual patient. The first protocol used RT-PCR to amplify the 5'UTR gene of viruses from the Picornavirus family (17), followed by hybridization to increase the picornavirus detection. These picornavirus-positive samples were then hybridized with enterovirus-specific probes to differentiate enterovirus-from non-enterovirus-positive samples (4, 17). Those samples which did not hybridize to the enterovirus probe were considered positive for rhinovirus by exclusion.",

These data suggest a lower sensitivity for the duplex semi-nested-RT-PCR protocol, but only some of our discordant samples were compared among the three different protocols.Moreover, the fact that only 1 out of 16 samples was not detected and confirmed by the RT-PCR/sequencing protocol(Table 1)suggests a higher specificity for the sequencing protocol. Seven samples demonstrated a positive result from both the duplex semi-nested-RT-PCR and the sequencing protocol, but 2 other samples had discordant results and were confirmed as rhinoviruses (1 HRV A and 1 HRV C) by the RT-PCR/sequencing protocol after having been classified as enterovirus by the duplex semi-nested-RT-PCR assay.
