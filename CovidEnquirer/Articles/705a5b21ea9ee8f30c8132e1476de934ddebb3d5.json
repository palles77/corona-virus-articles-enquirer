However, evidence to this effect has been inconsistent. Furthermore, previous urban studies have indicated the interaction between urban morphology and indoor environment. This study thus goes beyond indoor environment to investigate: i) the effects of neighborhood environment on occupant health; and ii) the mediating roles of indoor environment on the neighborhood environment and occupant health relationships. To achieve this aim, buildings located in different neighborhood environment in Hong Kong are selected. Data are collected by post-occupancy evaluation (occupant health), indoor environment assessment (thermal comfort, indoor air quality, ventilation, visual comfort, and acoustic comfort) and neighborhood environment assessment (neighborhood building density, building height, cleanliness and greenspace) through questionnaire survey. Through correlation analysis, regression modelling and Sobel test, it is found that: i) occupant health is significantly affected by neighborhood building height, building density and cleanliness; ii) the relationships between neighborhood environment and occupant health are significantly mediated by indoor environment, in terms of visual and acoustic comfort; and iii) neighborhood greenspace affects occupant health indirectly through influencing indoor air quality. To cross validate the results of the survey study, which is conducted using subjective data, objective measurements and analyses are further conducted. The objective study, echoing the survey study results, indicates that buildings with lower neighborhood building density and height, and cleaner neighborhood environment have better visual (higher illuminance level) and acoustic (lower noise level) performances.",

However, building occupants are not isolated from its neighborhood environment. Buildings serve not only to shelter occupants from adverse outdoor environment and weather; but also bring favorable natural elements, such as natural lighting and fresh air, into occupants' work and life. Permeability is one of the key features in any buildings (e.g., [55] . It is this permeability nature which puts occupants of a building and its neighborhood environment into connection. Therefore, the impact of neighborhood environment is a key factor which cannot be overlooked when studying occupant health and indoor environment.",

Previous studies have indicated that poor IAQ can cause bronchoconstriction, asthma symptoms, lung cancer, irritation to eyes, visibility problems, headaches, dizziness and even fatal poisoning in occupants (e.g., [19, 50] .

In developed cities, like Hong Kong, transport noise, such as road traffic and railway noise, is the major source of noise affecting building occupants [38] . In this case, neighborhood buildings can act as obstructions to the free propagation of noise from street and road traffic, attenuating its sound level [21] . In current study, since the two Group 2 buildings are located right next to two main roads, with the absence of neighborhood buildings serving as sound obstructions, Group 2 buildings are found to have higher noise levels than that of Group 1 buildings. Enhancing sound insulation level of a building can reduce the level of sound energy emitted from the neighborhood environment entering its inner space, thus, enhancing occupant acoustic comfort and relieving the significant impact of outdoor noise to occupants.",
