The chapter begins with the corporate obligation of \"duty of care\" and what that means at a fundamental level, and then provides examples of different kinds of risks that companies should think about and implement plans to address. There are an infinite number of potential use cases for risk exposure to travelers, but these examples provide good food for thought, in particular to those companies whose knee-jerk reactions to creating a TRM program is typically comments about their not necessarily needing one because they don't believe that they travel to high-risk destinations, which is a farce.",

It can also be about risks that are specific to a traveler, their behavior and any number of other factors, some of which may be foreseeable, and some not. This information is important, but in the absence of a moderate to high risk rating, there is still the potential for an individual or widespread crisis that can affect groups of people and even an entire company. Subsequent chapters will delve into greater detail on some more common risk factors, along with case studies and precedents.",

The business judgment rule stands for the principle that courts will not second guess the business judgment of corporate managers and will find the duty of care has been met so long as the fiduciary executed a reasonably informed, good faith, rational judgment without the presence of a conflict of interest. The burden of proof lies with the plaintiff to prove that this standard has not been met. If the plaintiff meets the burden, the defendant fiduciary can still meet the duty of care by showing entire fairness, meaning that both a fair process was used to reach the decision and that the decision produced a substantively fair outcome for the corporation's shareholders. iJET International defines \"Duty of Care\" specific to TRM as follows: 2 Duty of Care: This is the legal responsibility of an organization to do everything \"reasonably practical\" to protect the health and safety of employees. Though interpretation of this language will likely vary with the degree of risk, this obligation exposes an organization to liability if a traveler suffers harm.

For companies who have been paying attention since 9/11, the ones who, outside of the public eye, have had to deal with critical incidents that had the potential for loss of lives, corporate liability, and damage to their company's reputation, having a structured TRM program not only reduced the potential for risk, but heightened the awareness of risk to their travelers. Their definition of \"travelers\" extended beyond employees (transient travelers to expatriates) to contractors, subcontractors, and dependents. Keeping travelers aware of imminent dangers takes effort and planning, and isn't something that employers can any longer react to after the fact. In some countries, lack of planning or resources to support business travelers has the potential to be grounds for claims of negligence in a company's duty of care responsibilities, and can lead to a criminal offense, such as with the United Kingdom's (UK) Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act of 2007. What the \"business judgment rule\" in the above duty of care definition means in layman's terms is that a company must be able to prove that it put forth reasonable best efforts to keep its travelers safe. How this applies in different circumstances, jurisdictions and countries will vary. Most countries' duty of care requirements fall under their occupational safety and health laws. For a comprehensive list of occupational health and safety legislation by country, an updated global database is maintained by the International Labour Organization (www.ilo.org 3 ). Simply put, companies cannot afford to no longer have a proactive TRM program and just react after an incident takes place. The end result could reflect negligence on behalf of the company.

The level of investment and complexity may vary between companies, but in general, all companies must have a plan for how to address the issues provided herein and others. Duty of care is never finite in its definition because companies must consider how laws from one country to the next will apply to travelers, contractors, potential subcontractors, and expatriates and their dependents, as well as any potential for conflict of law.

A Crisis Management Team must possess sufficient inherent or delegated power to command unrestricted access to a full cross-section of corporate disciplines, including HR, sales, customer service, information technology (IT), security, operations, facilities management, communications, department/business unit headsfrom every corner of your organization. The Crisis Managers must know who from these disciplines are to be brought on to support the Crisis Management Team on an as-needed \"on-demand\" basis. Note that these disciplines are for advice and support, not crisis decision making.",

Many airlines have an airflow mix of approximately 50% outside air, and 50% recirculated, filtered air whereby the environmental control systems circulate the air in a compartmentalized fashion by pushing air into the cabin from the ceiling area, and taking it in at the floor level from side to side, versus air movement from the front to back of the aircraft. However, most viral respiratory, infectious diseases, such as influenza and the common cold, are transmitted via droplets that are most commonly transmitted between passengers by sneezing or coughing. These droplets can typically only travel only a few feet this way. However, it is their survival rate once they land on seats, seatbelts, tray tables, and other parts of the passenger cabin that can provide additional exposure, which is why sanitation of your personal seating area when traveling, particularly your hands with an alcohol-based sanitizer before eating, is important. Surgical masks have been shown to reduce the spread of influenza in combination with hand sanitization, particularly when worn and practiced by the infected individual.",

In the absence of such a device, place tape or a sticker over the inside peephole opening. 4. Choose your hotels carefully. Make it clear to your employer that you take safety seriously and that you expect safety considerations to have been taken into account when designating preferred hotels for employees to stay at. Employers should be able to articulate what kinds of safety standards go into their preferred hotel selections, which form the basis for how different incidents can be mitigated or handled should an incident occur. 5. Never stay at hotels or motels where the room door is exposed to the open air (outside). 6. Try to not accept hotel rooms on the ground floor. Being on a higher floor makes it more difficult for an assailant to get away or not be seen on surveillance cameras. 7. Never tell anyone your room number verbally. If a hotel employee asks for it, provide them with it in writing and personally hand it to them. Do not write it on a check and leave it unattended. You don't want someone in the area to overhear you providing this information verbally or to view it on your check. 8. Alcohol consumption-Never leave your drink unattended or out of your sight. A momentary distraction is an opportunity for someone to place drugs into your drink. Also, never drink until intoxicated while on business and be mindful of locations where drinking alcohol may even be illegal. 9. Emergency phone numbers-Know the equivalent of 911 or the local emergency services phone number and your local consulate or embassy phone numbers and preprogram them into your mobile phone, in addition to your company's provided crisis response hotline. Whichever number you are instructed to call first according to your company's policies (if your company provides a crisis hotline), having those numbers handy can save your life when moments count. 10. Never tell anyone that you are traveling alone. Avoid solitary situations. Try to remain in social situations where plenty of people are around. If you feel uncomfortable, leave. 11. Leave a TV or radio on when you leave your hotel room to provide the perception that someone is in the room. 12. Never hesitate to ask security or someone to escort you to your room, and avoid exiting an elevator on your hotel room's floor when sharing the elevator with a man. If necessary, go back to the lobby level until more people get on the elevator or you can ride it alone.",

If ever you are away and need to return, and you either don't remember the address, or your driver doesn't know where it is, or you don't have a signal on your mobile device, you can use the card to provide address details (usually in the local language). 15. Do not use door-hanging room service order forms (typically for breakfast), as they often note how many guests you are ordering for. 16. Make sure you have adequate insurance. Just because you are on a business trip, doesn't mean that your employer has obtained enough insurance or services to support you in the event that a crisis occurs. Hopefully, employer-provided insurance and support services are adequate and have been effectively communicated, but don't travel for business without a thorough understanding of what kind of coverage and support you have. In particular, any medical coverage should guarantee advance payment to local service providers and not require travelers to pay for services and file for reimbursement upon their return home. Most people don't have access to the many thousands of dollars that might be necessary to procure sufficient treatment and support. 17. Travel with smart travel accessories. Travel with a small, high-powered flashlight and one or more rubber door stops for the inside of your hotel room (be aware of the downside of using in case of a fire). 18. Leave copies of your passport with someone at home who can easily get a copy to you if you need it. Having a copy can expedite the replacement of a lost or stolen passport if needed.",

Honor killings have been known to happen to nonfamily members in strict, culturally conservative countries. Perceived inappropriate behavior, typically with a female member of a conservative family, could result in the killing of the female family member and the nonfamily suspect. Such killings can even take place in broad daylight. In Lahore, Pakistan in 2014, one such incident occurred involving multiple participants while the police looked on. The victim killed for marrying a man that she loved without family consent. 8 Often these crimes are hard to document or record because they are disguised as suicides or, in some Latin American countries, as \"crimes of passion.\" The United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) estimates that as many as 5000 women fall victim to honor killings each year. 9",

Additionally, a kidnap and ransom insurance policy is something for all companies to consider, with an understanding that kidnappings happen at anytime around the world, and largely go unreported. According to The Guardian News and Media (UK), approximately 75% of Fortune 500 companies have kidnap and ransom (K&R) insurance. K&R insurance originates from 1932, when it was first offered by insurance provider Lloyd's of London, after the kidnapping and murder of American aviator Charles Lindbergh's infant son. In 2015, the UK's Home Secretary, Theresa May, supported and passed the UK's \"Counter-Terrorism and Security Act of 2015,\" which prohibits insurers from paying claims used to finance payments to terrorist groups. The UK is where many of the world's K&R insurers operate. Many insurers insist that it shouldn't matter because they claim to not pay or finance ransoms, but instead pay claims for services and expenses related to negotiating the release of the captives in question, medical and counseling treatment, along with things such as employee salaries while in captivity. It's difficult to obtain information from clients who hold such policies, because most policies have strict cancelation provisions to prevent a company from disclosing the fact that it has such a policy. Details specific to restrictions on insurance related payments associated with terrorist related ransoms in the UK's Counter-Terrorism Act of 2015 can be found at http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/6/section/42/enacted.",

These laws are typically intended to provide some form of medical benefits and wage replacement for employees who are injured on the job. This coverage is often provided to employees in exchange for releasing their right to sue their employer for negligence, sometimes with fixed limits on payment of damages. Employers need to understand whether the workers' compensation coverage that is applicable and in place for their and their employees' protection, covers international travel. In some cases, additional policies or riders will be required to provide coverage for travel outside of the traveler's home country or state. Additional considerations to this kind of coverage should be as to \"when\" and \"where\" the coverage is in effect outside of a company office or facility (e.g., business travel). In some cases this may limit employer liability, but whether it does varies by jurisdiction and circumstance. Considering how workers' compensation benefits have been reduced in recent years, especially in the United States, 14 much consideration needs to be given to assessing what coverage is needed for traveling employees above and beyond workers' compensation, and coordinated with crisis response protocols and risk management support providers for efficient case management, claims, and documentation. All of these considerations provide a strong business case for why employers should have unique and specific programs in place for medical services and evacuations for employees and contractors traveling abroad in addition to their standard domestic health care plans and workers' compensation plans. No traveler should embark on a business trip without the complete confidence that medical coverage and resources not requiring their personal, out-of-pocket expenditure is being provided by their employer.",

One major UK retailer has stated that 95 percent of its global fresh produce is already at risk from global warming. According to the French Foreign Minister, commenting at a 2015 UN conference in Japan, two-thirds of disasters stem from climate change. Comments were made days after the 4-year anniversary of the Fukushima nuclear disaster that killed approximately 19,000 people in 2011 from an earthquake and tsunami. Margareta Wahlstrom, the head of the UN Disaster Risk Reduction Agency, stated that preventative measures provided a very good return as compared to reconstruction. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon asked world nations to spend US$6 billion dollars a year on prevention. An important aspect of both a company's TRM and business continuity plan is to determine what are the unique dangers or risks associated with where your offices or facilities are located, as well as where you travel to on a regular basis, making emergency evacuation and safety plans in the event that a unique incident occurs, such as the following case study related to the 2011 Japanese Earthquake and Tsunami. It is important to know what local governments have made available in close proximity to your travelers' or expats' locations in terms of resources, or something that your company itself may provide, such as \"vertical evacuation points\" to escape rising tsunami flood waters. These vertical evacuation points may be in a building that is tall enough to support large numbers of the local population at a high water level, with ample support systems and supplies. Not understanding and communicating these plans to your people when appropriate could exact a cost in lives, money, and corporate reputation. * American Red Cross, \"Japan Earthquake and Tsunami: One Year Update, March 2012,\" http:// www.redcross.org/images/MEDIA_CustomProductCatalog/m6340390_JapanEarthquakeTsunami_ OneYear.pdf.",

            "text": "The term \"open booking\" refers to a booking made by a traveler that was made outside of their managed corporate travel program, avoiding usage of any contracted travel management company (TMC). Technical advances have found ways to incorporate reservations data from multiple websites or suppliers for a traveler's trips into one place for reporting and calendar population. However, to properly capture this data, there are two primary methods available. The first is to allow the applications the ability to scan our inbox for travel-related e-mails and import the data accordingly. The second method is having travelers or independent suppliers e-mail reservation confirmations to an application or \"parser,\" which can parse the data into a standardized database. With some major travel suppliers (such as airlines, for example) there are \"direct connections\" from their websites to some of these applications. However, in the absence of a direct connection, if you cannot get beyond the security concerns of a third-party application scanning your inbox, one cannot guarantee the automatic capture of 100 percent of open booking data because of human error. For that reason and many others relative to policy and program management, and because of the high probability of human error, for effective TRM, open booking should not be promoted as a primary booking method within a managed travel program. However, there is a place for open booking technology within a managed travel program: to help capture data from travel data normally considered \"leakage,\" which is often not collected for reporting. Such data can originate from conference-or meeting-based bookings made via housing authorities or meeting planners, or perhaps for travel that is booked and paid for by a client. Companies who allow open booking for all travel struggle to effectively locate travelers in a crisis, disclose any potential risks or alerts, or provide services to some travelers in the event of a crisis. Outside of suppliers with direct connections to open booking applications or parsers, even when your travelers are trained to e-mail those open booking itineraries to the required application for data capture, employers have no control over when they do this. Within a managed program (via most TMCs), all new bookings, modifications and cancelations are usually updated in the database in real time or close to it, providing employers with ample opportunities to mitigate risk in a number of ways when time is of the essence. Some well-known companies, offering travel-related solutions, claim that open bookings equate to more traveler choice and that their solutions can bridge the gap for any potentially missing data. When using an open booking application's itinerary data for security purposes, changes and cancelations can be a major issue. Some applications require user intervention to manually delete trips that have been canceled, or to resubmit trips for changes unless an update can be e-mailed or picked up by an e-mail scan.",

Days later, the traveler needs to cancel that booking and rebook with another airline to travel with someone else from the company. The arrangements are made with the new airline, but the traveler forgets to delete the original trip in the open booking application. Now there are two trips in the system for the traveler. Imagine the confusion this could cause with employers if similar circumstances impacted multiple employees at the same time? A good managed travel program can still provide a variety of options, including easy methods of making reservations, yet still capture critical reservations data needed to effectively manage risk for business travelers. Trying to manage risk with a completely unmanaged booking process for the sake of open booking, even if it did offer more traveler choice, is not worth the risk, considering that in a crisis you have a higher likelihood of inaccurate data unlike if the traveler had booked via your managed program (via a contracted TMC working in conjunction with your TRM provider). Does that mean that managed program data is perfect? No, but if implemented properly, reservations data can be more tightly controlled.",

The office in question contacted their TMC, but was unable to obtain any information on the traveler, so they then turned to the travel manager. By this time, the inquiring family member had intentions of coming into the office because he wanted \"some answers,\" for which there were none at the time. Human Resources suggested that the relative contact the crisis response hotline, while dispatching security to the office in question to protect the facility and its personnel. Human Resources also advised the person to stay home for any communications, and for their safety, considering the person was so upset. It turns out that the traveler in question was on a legitimate business trip, but that the traveler had purchased the trip online (outside of the employer's managed program), with the traveler's personal credit card, and without using an open booking application for itinerary data capture. Because of this situation, it was difficult or nearly impossible to get helpful intelligence to the traveler or the traveler's family or to provide adequate resources and support, and had there been a death or severe bodily injury involved, the traveler wouldn't have been eligible for their corporate credit card's accidental death and dismemberment (AD&D) coverage.",

In general, most countries allow up to a 30-day supply of legitimately prescribed medications, in their original bottle. More than 30 days of prescription medication on a traveler can be considered a violation of many country's laws, particularly when it comes to controlled substances, such as narcotic pain medication or psychotropic drugs. In some cases, it simply isn't enough to carry the original prescription bottles with medication in them; travelers may be required to carry additional documentation along with having filed advance approval forms to be in compliance with the jurisdiction in question.

The Single Convention codified all existing multilateral treaties on drug control and extended the existing control systems to include the cultivation of plants that were grown as the raw material of narcotic drugs. The principal objectives of the Convention are to limit the possession, use, trade in, distribution, import, export, manufacture, and production of drugs exclusively to medical and scientific purposes and to address drug trafficking through international cooperation to deter and discourage drug traffickers. The Convention also established the International Narcotics Control Board, merging the Permanent Central Board and the Drug Supervisory Board.

Notwithstanding the preceding subparagraph, when abusers of drugs have committed such offences, the Parties may provide, either as an alternative to conviction or punishment or in addition to conviction or punishment, that such abusers shall undergo measures of treatment, education, after-care, rehabilitation and social reintegration in conformity with paragraph 1 of article 38.",
