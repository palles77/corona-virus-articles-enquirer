Subsequently, several studies from different countries detected CIV isolates in respiratory samples and concurrent anti-CIV antibodies in dogs with mild respiratory signs as well as cases of fatal respiratory disease (Yoon et al. 2005 , Daly et al. 2008 , Payungporn et al. 2008 , Song et al. 2008 , Kirkland et al. 2010 , Li et al. 2010 , Song et al. 2013 . Furthermore, isolation of human-related influenza strains from dogs was successful (Lin et al. 2012) . To date, at least seven influenza virus subtypes showing different ability of interspecies and intraspecies transmission have been isolated from dogs. These subtypes are mainly prevalent in the USA (H3N8), Eastern China and South Korea (e.g. H3N2), but some of them have also been reported from European countries (Sun et al. 2013 , Xie et al. 2016 supporting the hypothesis that dogs may play a role in transmission and spread of influenza virus among animal species and even humans.",

Influenced by their geographic origin, these studies show quite divergent results indicating a dynamic process of virus spread. Frequent surveillance is key for assessing the emergence and spread of novel, potentially zoonotic or vaccine resistant viral diseases. The present study was initiated to investigate the status quo of viral CIRD-associated pathogens in and around Vienna, Austria, with a population of almost 1.9 million citizens and 55,705 registered dogs (Magistrat Wien 2017). Despite the seasonal influenza epidemics in humans, in none of the obtained canine samples were influenza A virus RNA detected. This finding is in line with the results of other studies from Europe that also found no evidence of influenza A viruses within investigated dog populations (Schulz et al. 2014b , Viitanen et al. 2015 , Decaro et al. 2016 , Mitchell et al. 2017 .",

CDV and CAV-2 field strains were not detected in this study. This is consistent with other studies reporting low detection rates of these viruses. In contrast, a study from Japan detected CDV in 1.5% and CAV-2 in 2.9% of the examined household dogs (Mochizuki et al. 2008) , and studies (Schulz et al. 2014a , Decaro et al. 2016 detected no CDV-or CAV-2-specific nucleic acid at all. However, CDV-and CAV-2-specific nucleic acid has been detected in 7.4 and 12.5% of asymptomatic shelter dogs in the USA (Lavan & Knesl 2015) .

A much higher detection rate of viruses was found in the examined shelter animals (24.4%, group B) than in the group of privately owned dogs (12.1%, group A). This finding meets the general opinion that CIRD predominates in crowded dog populations because of higher infection pressure in shelters (Erles & Brownlie 2008 , Ford 2012 . The most commonly detected pathogens in and around Vienna were CRCoV (7.5%) and CPiV (6.5%). Recent studies from other European countries revealed higher prevalence rates for CPiV, namely 37.7% (Schulz et al. 2014a) , 35.0% (Viitanen et al. 2015) and 13.0% (Decaro et al. 2016) , respectively. In the present study, the comparably low detection rate of CPiV (6.5%) may be related to a generally high vaccination rate in the population under investigation, especially dogs in group B that were almost all vaccinated against CPiV (92.9%). Interestingly, 50% of the dogs that tested positive for CPiV were regularly vaccinated against it. As the time between vaccination and onset of signs was documented in most of the positive cases, positive results due to recent vaccination were unlikely. Detecting CPiV-specific nucleic acid in dogs despite a current vaccination status might be explained by the fact that the vaccine is not preventing CPiV infection but is rather diminishing the severity of disease caused by CPiV (Day et al. 2016) .",

As seroconversion of asymptomatic home-raised working dogs after transferal to training centres at the age of 1 year has been demonstrated (Erles & Brownlie 2005 ) the existence of subclinical CRCoV infections in certain dog populations has already been proven and could be an explanation for positive PCR results in some dogs. Nevertheless, the complementary serological examinations of the obtained paired serum samples in this study basically reveal good concordance to the PCR results for CRCoV, mostly confirming acute infection. This is especially true for 13 kennelled working dogs that showed seroconversion (fourfold increase in antibody titre or higher) in 76.9% of the cases during an outbreak of CIRD. Concurrent CRCoV-specific nucleic acid was detected in six of these dogs. As viral shedding has been shown to occur in the first days after infection, starting at day 2 and ceasing at day 6 in most cases (Mitchell et al. 2013a) , collection of swab samples too early or too late in the course of disease might be an explanation for negative PCR results in the remaining dogs. However, the results of the present study further contribute to the assumption that CRCoV can be a primary cause of CIRD especially in kennelled dog populations and emphasise the supportive value of obtaining paired serum samples to verify viruses as an underlying cause of disease.",

            "text": "Other viral agents (e.g. canine herpesvirus, CnPnV, canine bocavirus) have been detected in dogs with respiratory disease (Buonavoglia & Martella 2007 , Kapoor et al. 2012 , Mitchell et al. 2013b ). They are discussed as secondary contributing factors probably causing more severe CIRD. However, it cannot be excluded that some are actually opportunistic agents that benefit from the weakened immune system in affected dogs. In this study, these viruses were not investigated and so we cannot exclude them as causes or contributors to the clinical presentation in the evaluated dog population. In conclusion, CRCoV should be considered as a clinicallyrelevant cause of CIRD in crowded dog populations. Acutely diseased dogs of younger age are predisposed. For sample collection, the nasal mucosa can be recommended as the favoured site. Especially in larger dog shelters, supplementary use of paired serum samples is indicated to confirm the causal relevance of a certain virus in dogs with CIRD in order to implement adequate hygiene measures. Failure to detect CAV-2 and CDV infection in this study indicates good immunisation protection in the examined dog population and emphasises the relevance of regular core vaccinations. WSAVA guidelines for the vaccination of dogs consider vaccines against CPiV as non-core vaccines (Day et al. 2016) . This recommendation may be generally applicable for dogs in Austria unless they are exposed to possibly non-vaccinated dog populations (e.g. dog exhibitions, animal shelters). More studies are needed to discover the true relevance of CRCoV but also other emerging viral pathogens in the context of CIRD and to assess the need for new vaccines.",
