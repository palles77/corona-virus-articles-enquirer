Methods: We included infants hospitalized for acute bronchiolitis from 2004 to 2014. All infants underwent a nasal washing for virus detection. A regional agency network collected meteorological data (mean temperature, relative humidity and wind velocity) and the following air pollutants: sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, benzene and suspended particulate matter measuring less than 10 \u00b5m (PM 10 ) and less than 2.5 \u00b5m (PM 2.5 ) in aerodynamic diameter. We obtained mean weekly concentration data for the day of admission, from the urban background monitoring sites nearest to each child's home address. Overdispersed Poisson regression model was fitted and adjusted for seasonality of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, to evaluate the impact of individual characteristics and environmental factors on the probability of a being positive RSV. Results: Of the 723 nasal washings from the infants enrolled, 266 (68%) contained RSV, 63 (16.1%) rhinovirus, 26 (6.6%) human bocavirus, 20 (5.1%) human metapneumovirus, and 16 (2.2%) other viruses. The number of RSV-positive infants correlated negatively with temperature (p < 0.001), and positively with relative humidity (p < 0.001). Air pollutant concentrations differed significantly during the peak RSV months and the other months. Benzene concentration was independently associated with RSV incidence (p = 0.0124). Conclusions: Seasonal weather conditions and concentration of air pollutants seem to influence RSV-related bronchiolitis epidemics in an Italian urban area.",

The air quality network, owned and operated by ARPA Lazio (http://www.arpalazio.net/main/aria/doc/pubblicazioni), currently has 41 chemical measuring stations, some also equipped with meteorological sensors, distributed across five provinces with 21 municipalities. The ARPA Network routinely measured air pollutants. We retained data from the urban background monitoring sites only. These sites are representative of ambient air pollution in the Rome area. We obtained mean weekly concentration data for the day of admission, from the urban background monitoring sites nearest to each child's home address. We chose \"a priori\" to use mean exposure during the week before admission since the incubation period of bronchiolitis is very short (less than 5 days).",

            "text": "During the 10-year study, as other studies in European countries confirm (Forsberg et al., 2012; D'Amato, 2011) , mean temperature and relative humidity in Rome progressively increased, but these increase has not been reported in terms of regression. These climate changes could be influenced by numerous environmental factors, including air pollution. The meteorological data differed notably during peak RSV activity and during the other months, temperatures being lower and relative humidity higher. RSV transmission is inversely related to temperature (Vandini et al., 2013; Lanari et al., 2002) . Climatic factors could promote viral infections in different ways: for example, by increasing virus survival, affecting their climate-dependent behavior (for example, greater persistence in closed and crowded ambient settings when temperatures remain low) and by acting on the pediatric population's immune response (Cui et al., 2015; Tang and Loh, 2014; Paynter, 2015; du Prel et al., 2009; Nelson and Demas, 1996; Haus and Smolensky, 1999; Vandini et al., 2015) . RSV is more active at cold temperatures because cold makes the virus' lipid envelope more resistant and therefore more stable in the secretions through which it is transmitted (Vandini et al., 2013 (Vandini et al., , 2015 Cui et al., 2015; Tang and Loh, 2014) . Equally important, cold temperatures might drive populations indoors where RSV spreads more readily (Vandini et al., 2015; Barnett et al., 2005) . Crowding, along with a suitable susceptible population of newborns and infants, could trigger seasonal RSV epidemics. Another major climatic factor that in our study correlates with RSV activity is relative humidity. Many studies have underlined the association of increased humidity and RSV, hCoV and PIV3 detection rates (Cui et al., 2015; Vandini et al., 2015; Welliver, 2009) . These observations support a previous finding that high average humidity (80%) favored virus survival (Cui et al., 2015; Tang and Loh, 2014; Vandini et al., 2015) . The other climatic factor we investigated, mean wind velocity, had no correlation with RSV-positive cases nor did it correlate with the peak RSV activity. Previous studies disagreed on whether wind velocity influenced seasonal changes in RSV activity (Cui et al., 2015; Vandini et al., 2015) . In our infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis, neither temperature, relative humidity nor wind velocity affected RV detection.",

The inverse correlation with RSV receives support from the finding that O 3 values peaked in the summer whereas the other air pollutant concentrations we tested increased in the autumn-winter season (October-February). Conversely, no correlation was found between air pollutants and the number of RV-positive cases. These new findings obtained by analyzing the correlation between bronchiolitis from 14 viruses and environmental factors during 10 seasonal epidemics corroborate and extend current knowledge on how environmental factors influence RSV seasonal bronchiolitis. Moreover, we decided to correlate the week of admission because the incubation period of bronchiolitis is very short, less than 5 days, and we thought that it was the week more closely correlated with times of virus acquisition, incubation, replication and clinical registration (S\u00e9gala et al., 2008) . Ample evidence has already shown a positive correlation between air pollutants and morbidity for viral respiratory infections and other respiratory conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Lin et al., 2005; Dong et al., 2011) . In another study conducted in Italy, Vandini et al. (2013) examined RSV bronchiolitis in Bologna (Italy) during three consecutive winter seasons and obtained a similar correlation between RSV peak and mean temperature but no correlation with relative humidity concentrations. Unfortunately, they studied the correlation only between RSV and PM 10 and PM 2.5 . As we did, they found a correlation between RSV and evaluated pollutants but in the regression model, neither were predictive factors for RSV bronchiolitis. Conversely, S\u00e9gala et al. (2008) showed a short-term relationship between air pollutants and daily numbers of emergency hospital consultation and hospitalization for bronchiolitis among children < 3 years of age in Paris.",

The main anthropogenic sources of air pollutants are mobile and stationary combustion sources, derived from traffic density, thermoelectric Data are expressed as median and interquartile range (IQR). sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), nitrogen oxide and dioxide (NO x , NO 2 ); carbon monoxide (CO); ozone (O 3 ); benzene (BZ); levels of suspended particles less than 10 \u00b5m (PM10) and less than 5 \u00b5m (PM2.5) in aerodynamic diameter. a Mann-Whitney U test. Nenna et al. Environmental Research 158 (2017) 188-193 system, incinerators, industrial systems and domestic heating (Kampa and Castanas, 2008) . Benzene is released to our environment from industry effluents, combustion of gasoline and other petrochemicals used in our cars and industries. Evidence from experimental models has suggested the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying benzene-induced toxic damage to the respiratory airways causing apoptotic changes in the parenchymal components of the lungs (Weaver et al., 2007; Bahadar et al., 2014) . Common cellular mechanism by which most air pollutants exert their adverse effects is their ability to act directly as lipid and protein pro-oxidants or as free radical generators, promoting oxidative stress and inducing inflammatory responses (Menzel, 1994; Rahman and MacNee, 2000) . To bring air pollutants down we probably need to obtain more reliable information on the state of the air we breathe and to implement preventive maneuvers to minimize exposure to pollutants. Although the possible pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the potentially clinical risk factors go beyond our objectives in this study enrolling infants hospitalized for acute viral bronchiolitis, our findings may indicate future research directions. Infants and children differ strongly from adults in toxicokinetics. Their peculiarity and vulnerability consist of lower body weight, higher relative liver weight, higher ratio between body surface and body weight, smaller lung caliber, higher particle deposition in the respiratory tract, and generally immature lungs (Heinricha and Slama, 2007; Samuel, 1973) . Our findings suggest that one way to reduce RSV bronchiolitis morbidity in infants may be to develop simple and inexpensive patient-centered measures that reduce infant exposure to indoor and outdoor pollution. For example, parents should avoid taking infants into polluted environments R. Nenna et al. Environmental Research 158 (2017) 188-193 in cool and humid weather conditions. A limitation in our study is that we were unable to obtain significant correlations for coinfections or for some viruses that we detected less often than RSV and RV. Other limitations are that we had no information on travel history (outside of Roma) of the children before their hospital admission and we could examined acute background air pollution exposure alone. Moreover, we have no data on outpatients with mild bronchiolitis and on patients from other hospitals in Rome. Another important issue is that, insofar as infants spend the majority of their time inside the home, some variables such as ventilation, gas or oil heating or cooking, may be significant unmeasured confounders or causative agents. Finally, this study was focused only on the meteorological and pollution exposure during the week before admission; it would be interesting in future studies to evaluate the maximum value for the meteorological and pollution data within the week before the admission.",
