While the majority of cases of acute community acquired pneumonia (CAP) are due to bacteria, especially Streptococcal pneumoniae and less commonly the atypical organisms, respiratory tract viruses also contribute to a substantial proportion. More importantly, in general, viral pneumonia has a higher outbreak potential. A wide spectrum of viruses can cause viral pneumonia (Table 1, Figure 1 ). The relative importance of these viruses depends on the host's age, immune status, comorbidity, and the local epidemiological determinants such as seasonality.",

            "text": "Influenza viruses belong to the genus Orthomyxovirus within the family Orthomyxoviridae. This enveloped virion contains eight (influenza A and B) or seven (influenza C) segments of single, negative-stranded RNA. The pleomorphic envelope is composed of two major antigenic glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) . Major changes in the antigenic protein structure of HA (i.e., antigenic shift) may occur and lead to a pandemic. Minor changes involving a small number of amino acid substitutions (i.e., antigenic drift) lead to an epidemic of influenza. Antigenic shift is rare, whereas significant antigenic drift occurs once every few years. Altogether, 16 different subtypes of HA and nine different subtypes of NA have been identified from influenza A viruses from various animal species (Table 2) . Currently, two subtypes of influenza A, A/H1N1 and A/H3N2, are in human circulation. Introduction of a new subtype into humans can result in a large-scale pandemic with high morbidity and mortality. This is because of the naive immunity and the absence of an effective vaccine in the initial phase of outbreak. Three influenza pandemics occurred in the twentieth century. The most severe of these was 'Spanish flu' A/H1N1, which occurred in 1918-19 with a global mortality of at least 20-25 million people. It was estimated that 50% of the global population became infected, half of which suffered clinical illnesses. The A/H2N2 pandemic that occurred between 1957 and 1958 caused about 70 000 deaths in the US. In 1968, a new type (A/H3N2) emerged and remains in circulation today. A series of genetic reassortment events have been demonstrated to be traceable to the precursor of the A/H5N1 virus that caused the initial human outbreak in 1997, and the subsequent avian outbreaks in 2001 and 2002 in Hong Kong. These events gave rise to a dominant A/H5N1 genotype (Z) in chickens and ducks that was responsible for the regional outbreak ",

A/H5N1 viruses with pandemic potential have become endemic in birds in the region and are not easily eradicated. The greatest concern is that there will be reassortment between the current avian A/H5N1 strain and circulating human or porcine influenza viruses, producing a novel, virulent, and readily transmissible human strain.

Asymptomatic infection may occur and this is highlighted by the fact that 10% of poultry workers had positive serology to A/H5N1 and at least one worker who had participated in culling of poultry in Hong Kong in 1997 showed evidence of seroconversion without any symptoms.",

Occasionally, pulmonary manifestations may occur during the oliguric phase of renal failure, and present as pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly with or without pleuropericardial effusion.",

However, some species (e.g., deer mouse and white-footed mouse) may enter human habitation in rural and suburban areas. The association of hantaviruses with rodent reservoirs warrants recommendations to minimize exposure to wild rodents. The mortality for HPS treated with intravenous ribavirin (47.7%) appeared slightly lower than when treated conservatively (63.4%). The use of methylpredniso lone was associated with a dramatic decrease in mortality to 13.3%.",

In humans, influenza is mainly transmitted by respiratory droplets. The incubation period ranges from 1 to 4 days. The onset of illness is remarkably abrupt with fever, headache, photophobia, shivering, malaise, myalgia, nausea, dry cough, hoarseness of voice, and nasal congestion. Fever is usually continuous and lasts for about 3 days. A biphasic fever pattern may occur. Most patients recover after 1 week.Pneumonia in patients with influenza can be a primary viral pneumonia sometimes complicated by secondary bacterial infections, often due to Staphyloccocus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Haemophilus influenzae. Both forms of pneumonia are relatively uncommon for infection with usual human influenza subtypes. Pneumonia is mainly seen in immunocompromised hosts and the elderly with preexiting cardiopulmonary diseases or chronic illnesses.Birds, particularly aquatic and migratory species, are natural hosts of all 16 HA subtypes of influenza A virus, whereas only a few subtypes have established transmissible infections in humans, pigs, and other mammals (Table 2). In 1997, 18 people in Hong Kong were infected with the avian influenza A/H5N1 virus, resulting in six deaths. Subsequent serological studies have shown that human-to-human transmission can occur although the transmission efficiency is low. In 2003, there were another two human cases of H5N1 probably imported from Fujian, mainland China, to Hong Kong. The highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 has caused further disease outbreaks in poultry in multiple East Asian countries since late 2003. The virus caused fatal human infections in Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia. From January 2004 to mid-June 2005, at least 107 cases of human avian H5N1 occurred in Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia with reported mortality rates ranging from 46% to 100%.",

The type of pneumonia that develops in the immunocompromised host is determined by whether the immune defect is secondary to abnormalities in neutrophils, T lymphocytes, or B lymphocytes. Although coughing, fever, and shortness of breath develop commonly, pneumonia may be clinically silent or have unusual radiographic findings. Therefore, diagnosis often requires an open mind toward unusual organisms that may exist, as well as information acquired by sputum analysis, bronchoscopy, and/or surgical lung biopsy. Immunofluorescence and other organ-specific techniques may also be helpful in some patients. Antibiotics should be guided by cultures and other microbiology data; however, when such data are not available, they must be administered empirically.",
