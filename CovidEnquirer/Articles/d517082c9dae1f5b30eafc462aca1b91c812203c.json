            "text": "Throughout history, infectious diseases caused by viruses have posed a serious threat to human populations worldwide. In recent times, Ebola virus caused more than 11,290 deaths in Africa [1] , and over 160 people were infected with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in South Korea [2] , illustrating the devastating effects of viruses on international communities. Influenza the causative agent of influenza in birds, can also lead to highly infectious respiratory disease in mammals. Viral genome mutations (antigenic drift) and periodic gene segment reassortment between humans and animals (antigenic shift) can result in the emergence of new viral pathogens, with the potential to cause serious pandemics. During the past 100 years, pandemic influenza occurred in 1918, 1957, 1968, and 2009 [3] . The most severe pandemic, in 1918, resulted in approximately 40 million deaths worldwide [4] , while the most recent pandemic, the Swine flu pandemic of 2009, emerged in 214 countries and caused more than 18,000 deaths, according to a World Health Organization report [5] . Highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza was first identified in Hong Kong [3] . As the high pathogenicity of such a strain and the lack of host protective immunity against such viruses continue to threaten lives, effective infection control measures are crucial for the prevention of serious outbreaks. Viral particles released from infected patients through coughing or sneezing can survive for prolonged periods in the air and on surfaces. Viral transmission occurs through direct person-toperson contact or through the uptake of contaminated airborne droplets or contact with contaminated surfaces [6] . The use of antiviral materials is an effective way to inactivate viral particles in the environment preventing viral transmission and thereby lowering the risk of infection [7, 8] . For this purpose, solid-state inorganic compounds such as metal oxides are good candidates because of their chemical robustness and their feasibility for use as a coating material. Copper and silver have been recognized for their biocidal properties since ancient times [9, 10] . However, unlike their ionic forms (Cu 2+ and Ag + ), the biocidal properties of solid-state copper and silver compounds such as CuO, Cu 2 O and Ag 2 S, that are poorly soluble in water, remain to be fully elucidated.",

The inactivation of bacteriophages is mainly mediated by direct contact with solid-state copper(I) compounds, rather than exposure to reactive oxygen species or leached copper ions. Here, we investigated the antiviral activities of four groups of compounds, solid-state copper compounds (Cu 2 O and CuO), a copper ionic compound (CuCl 2 ), a solid-state silver compound (Ag 2 S), and silver ionic compounds (AgNO 3 and Ag 2 O), against pathogenic influenza A virus and bacteriophage Q\u2424. The effects of these compounds on the surface proteins of influenza viruses, hemagglutinin (HA), and neuraminidase (NA), were also investigated to reveal mechanistic insights into viral inactivation by these compounds.",

The measured BET surface areas of Cu 2 O, CuO, and Ag 2 S particles were 1.23, 1.20, and 0.14 m 2 /g, respectively. Ethanol suspensions of the compound particles were uniformly spreading on glass slides (2.5 cm \u00d7 2.5 cm), followed by heating at 120 \u2022 C for 3 h for sterilization. The particles were spread at 2.1 mol metal (copper or silver), corresponding to 0.24 g/m 2 for Cu 2 O, 0.27 g/m 2 for CuO, 0.36 g/m 2 for Ag 2 O, and 0.42 g/m 2 for Ag 2 S. Although Ag 2 O is moderately water-soluble, glass samples were prepared with the same procedures as other solid-state compounds. In the case of water-soluble compounds, CuCl 2 and AgNO 3 , the dried particles (0.45 g/m 2 for CuCl 2 and 0.57 g/m 2 for AgNO 3 ) from the ethanol solution on the glass substrate at room temperature were used to avoid oxidation by heating treatment.",

Thus, the antiviral activity of two types of viruses with different surface structures, H1N1 influenza A virus (A/PR8/H1N1) and bacteriophage Q\u2424, on the surfaces of solid-state copper or silver compounds was evaluated. Influenza A virus possesses a viral envelope, a cell membrane-like structure that encases its central core, while bacteriophages lack an envelope, instead their surface is composed of protein capsids. These two viral suspensions were inoculated onto glass slides loaded with Cu 2 O and CuO particles. After incubation for specified time periods, the viruses were harvested and the viral titers were evaluated by determining the TCID 50 /mL (Fig. 1a) . The titer of influenza A virus drastically decreased on contact with Cu 2 O particles by over 3 orders of magnitude after 30 min exposure to 2.1 mol copper amount (log 10 (N/N 0 ) = \u22123.7). By contrast, the CuO-loaded sample showed no reduction (log 10 (N/N 0 ) > \u22120.01) in influenza A viral titer after 30 min exposure, indicating a significant difference in the antiviral activities of different oxidation states of copper oxide. Borkow et al. reported that copper oxide-impregnated face mask largely inactivate human influenza A and avian influenza virus (log 10 (N/N 0 ) \u223c \u22123) within 30 min [9] . Since the oxidation state of copper was not discriminated in their paper, our results suggest that the active compound of the material would be only Cu 2 O.",

Another study by Imai et al. reported that purified influenza viruses are inactivated by 5.5-log fold reduction after 48 h treatment at high concentration (500 M) [20] . Among the copper compounds, solid-state Cu 2 O appears to be the most effective inhibitory agent against influenza virus. Similar findings were observed with the nonenveloped bacteriophage Q\u2424 (Fig. 1b) [11] . In fact, the titer of bacteriophage Q\u2424 decreased by six orders of magnitude after a 30 min incubation with Cu 2 O particles (log 10 (N/N 0 ) = \u22125.8), whereas CuO particles and Cu(II) ions had little effect on viral titer (log 10 (N/N 0 ) = \u22120.088 and \u22120.24 for CuO and CuCl 2 , respectively).

Several studies also showed strong anti-influenza effects of silver nanoparticles [21] [22] [23] , which seems similar to our findings. Compared with influenza virus, the inactivation of bacteriophage Q\u2424 by Ag 2 O and AgNO 3 decreased more slowly, indicating that water-soluble silver compounds such as AgNO 3 and Ag 2 O are not effective against the nonenveloped virus. Furthermore, insoluble silver compounds such as Ag 2 S, were unable to inactivate either virus.

Thus, we evaluated antiviral activities of Cu 2 O against influenza A virus containing 0.1 and 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA), including the protein amount in allantoic fluids (0.2-0.4 mg/mL). Influenza viruses on the exposure to Cu 2 O were inactivated in the presence 1 mg/mL BSA, whereas the viral inactivation efficiency significantly decreased (log 10 (N/N 0 ) = \u22122.8, \u22122.8 and \u22121.7 with 0, 0.1 and 1.0 mg/mL BSA, respectively, at 20 min exposure) with the increase of the amount of coexisting protein. Similar tendency has been found in anti-influenza activity of another metal oxide material (TiO 2 ) [12] . These results suggest that the inactivation efficiency of copper and silver compounds would be affected by coexisting proteins and that the antiviral activity in the real environment would be lower than that under controlled laboratory condition.",

HA is a glycosylated lectin protein that recognizes sialic acid residues on the receptor proteins of host cells [24] . Once influenza viruses bind through the HA-sialic acid interaction, they can enter host cells through endocytosis. NA is an endoglycosidase that is necessary for the release of viruses from the surface of host cells and is also involved in the initiation of influenza infection [25] .

Exposure to Cu 2 O decreased the HA titer at lower metal concentrations than the two silver compounds (AgNO 3 and Ag 2 O) (Fig. 4a) . In addition, HA activity was significantly decreased over a range of Cu 2 O concentrations (0.001-0.01 mol), whereas NA activity was not affected under the same conditions (Fig. 4a, b) . This difference in the dose response between HA and NA activities suggests that influenza virus inactivation by solid-state Cu 2 O at low concentration mainly originates from the inhibition of HA protein. On exposure to silver ionic compounds, NA activity was lost at a lower metal concentration than observed with Cu 2 O (Fig. 4b) , suggesting that silver ionic compounds inactivate the virus by preferentially losing the enzyme activity of NA. Imai et al. reported that treatment with Cu 2+ -containing zeolite decreased NA activity, while did not affect HA titers [20] , which is similar tendency to our findings of silver ionic compounds.",

            "text": "Furthermore, we asked whether the structure of viral proteins would be destabilized by contact with copper and silver compounds by evaluating the total thiol (R SH) concentration from both disulfide (S S) bonds and cysteine residues. Disulfide bond formation is essential for protein folding and for maintenance of the structure and function of proteins. Like other proteins, HA and NA proteins possess multiple disulfide bonds that stabilize their structure. A previous report detailed a method for determining the total concentration of thiols by evaluating by fluorescence of monobromobimane using trypsin inhibitor protein, which possesses two S S bonds and one cysteine residue per molecule, as a model protein [26] . As shown in Fig. 5 , CuO and Ag 2 S, which cannot inactivate both influenza virus and bacteriophage Q\u2424, did not affect the thiol concentration. By contrast, copper ion from CuCl 2 and silver ion from AgNO 3 or Ag 2 O clearly decreased the thiol from trypsin inhibitor protein, suggesting that copper and silver ions denature proteins by breakage of S S bonds according to the following reactions [27, 28] : R S S R + Ag + \u2192 2R S Ag, R SH + Ag + \u2192 R S Ag + H + R S S R + Cu 2+ \u2192 R S Cu S R, 2R SH + Cu 2+ \u2192 R S Cu S R + 2H + (R S S R and R SH represent disulfide (S S) bond and cysteine residues in trypsin inhibitor protein.) As Ag 2 S or CuS were formed at the end of these reactions, the fluorescence generated by the reaction of -SH and monobromobimane was hardly detectable. Table 1 summarizes the antiviral activity of each test compound against influenza virus and bacteriophage Q\u2424, and the effect on the function and structure of viral proteins. Copper and silver ions such as CuCl 2 , AgNO 3 , and Ag 2 O inactivate influenza viruses and also inhibit NA enzyme activity at low concentrations, indicating that the biocidal activity of such ionic compounds is mainly mediated by NA inhibition. In addition, these ions were able to induce protein destabilization through the breakage of S S bonds. Disruption of the disulfide bonds in NA may result in loss of enzymatic activity because mutation of cysteine residues in NA has been reported Table 1 Summary of the antiviral activity of copper and silver compounds against influenza virus and bacteriophage Q\u2424, and the denaturation of HA and NA proteins. to significantly impair enzyme activity [29] . By contrast, solid state Cu 2 O inactivated viruses with or without viral envelopes (influenza virus and bacteriophage Q\u2424) and preferentially inhibited HA activity. HA is involved in host cell recognition through ligand-receptor interactions on the cell surface. Our previous study revealed that the major biocidal effect of Cu 2 O is mediated when viruses come in direct contact with metal-coated solid surfaces [11] . Thus, direct contact of the protein with Cu 2 O would cause the structural denaturation of HA, resulting in impaired ligand-receptor recognition. This idea is supported by the efficient inactivation mediated by solid-state Cu 2 O of bacteriophage Q\u2424, a virus possessing capsid proteins on its surface instead of a viral envelope. Like HA inactivation, the denaturation of the surface proteins in bacteriophage Q\u2424 can inhibit infection into host bacteria. Such inactivation effects are distinct from those observed for ionic copper and silver compounds in our study. The denaturation of protein structure is partially caused by the cleavage of S S bonds; however, Cu 2 O decreased the thiol concentration by approximately half despite the high antiviral activity, which is weaker than the effects of ionic copper and silver compounds. These results suggested that Cu 2 O can denature protein structures by other mechanisms, such as disorder of hydrogen binding networks or ionic interactions in protein surfaces. We found that there are significant differences of protein adsorption and denaturation between Cu 2 O and CuO [11] , which might cause the opposite antiviral activities. Although interactions between proteins and solid surfaces have been studied [30] , the effects of solid-state Cu 2 O on viral protein structure following direct contact require further clarification.",

            "text": "In conclusion, we evaluated viral activity in response to exposure to copper and silver compounds and demonstrated that the antiviral mechanism of these metals against influenza viruses is mediated by inactivation of HA and NA surface proteins. Comparative analysis of these compounds revealed that the antiviral effect of Cu 2 O significantly differs from that of other ionic copper and silver compounds. With respect to influenza virus, one of the major strategies to control virus transmission is vaccination. However, vaccines are typically not effective against newly emerged viruses owing to the lack of suitable target antigens [31] . Inhibitors of NA, such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu \u00ae ) and zanamivir (Relenza \u00ae ), are also currently used as anti-influenza drugs. Despite their reported efficacy, it is likely that influenza viruses will gradually develop resistance to these drugs [32] . Combined with current strategies, the utilization of inorganic chemicals containing copper and silver as anti-influenza materials would potentially reduce the risk viral transmission in the environment. In particular, solid-state Cu 2 O has superior activity against both types of viruses, enveloped and nonenveloped compared with silver compounds, because of its unique inactivation mechanism mediated by direct contact. Furthermore, Cu 2 O is low-cost and widely available as a surface coating agent in various material surfaces and air-cleaning filters. Cu 2 O can also be combined with other biocidal coating chemicals such as photocatalytic TiO 2 nanoparticles [33] . The use of Cu 2 O for the treatment of both public and living spaces may help limit, or even prevent, future influenza pandemics.",
