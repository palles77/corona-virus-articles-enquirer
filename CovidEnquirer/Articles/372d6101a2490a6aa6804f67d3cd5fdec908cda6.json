In China alone, 5327 people became infected, 349 died, and nearly half of the survivors had somatic complications, ischemic necrosis, hypoadrenocortical dysfunction, or mental disorders. 13 In March 2013, a new subtype of influenza virus A, H7N9, was discovered in eastern China. Of the 469 laboratory-confirmed cases, 182 died (a mortality rate of 38.9%). Simultaneously, the H1N1 swine flu virus began to spread in South America and was subsequently reported in China, eventually resulting in 128,033 laboratory-confirmed cases (805 deaths). Vaccination is key to fighting seasonal influenza and reducing the burden of disease. However, owing to the variability of influenza viruses, traditional vaccines do not provide effective immunity to evolutionary strains. 7 In 1976, Ebola was first discovered in Central Africa. Ebola hemorrhagic fever has been rampant in West Africa since 2014; it has spread rapidly to South America and Europe and is almost out of control. As of August 2015, the worst-affected countries are Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, with a total of 280,005 cases and 11,287 deaths (40.3% mortality), which has caused global panic. 1 Ebola virus causes a strong inflammatory response, destroys the host's immune response, and causes multiple organ disorder syndrome. 6 Ebola remains a priority disease for the World Health Organization (WHO) owing to the risk of relapse it poses, and the lack of effective vaccines and antiviral drugs to combat it. 8 In May 2015, the first case of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) was reported in Guangdong, China. Nipah virus in Southeast Asia and Hendra virus in Australia are also import risk factors. If they spread, these infectious diseases will pose a considerable threat to global health.",

Biological pathogens can be artificially modified to enhance their toxicity, drug resistance, environmental stability, genetic characteristics, and immunogenicity. Such modifications can even result in ''gain-of-function mutations\" in which the altered gene product has a new molecular function or a new pattern of gene expression. Gain-of-function mutations are almost always dominant or semi-dominant. Once spread from the laboratory, genetically engineered microorganisms (GEMs) may have direct or indirect effects on the external environment. 12 In 2011, scientists in the Netherlands and the United States developed an H5N1 avian influenza virus with human-to-human transmission capacity through targeted transformation. Studies suggest that influenza hemagglutinin (HA) is the main barrier to interspecific transmission. The H5N1 subtype prefers to identify the Siaai and 3Gal receptors of poultry airway epithelial cells, which are specific for poultry receptor binding. 4 Although it can spread from birds to humans, it is difficult for the virus to spread through the respiratory tract. One research team found that only five point mutations or four gene re-assortments allowed the virus HA to break through the interspecies barrier. 11 The successful transformation of the H5N1 subtype of avian influenza virus was an important milestone in influenza virus research, and is highly significant to the direction of evolution of the epidemic strain. However, such biotechnological breakthroughs have both favorable and unfavorable consequences: they pose a major threat to human survival and global biosecurity as well as providing early warning of outbreaks.",

In 2007, the British Institute of Animal Health allowed a virus to leak from a damaged sewage system, causing an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in nearby farms. In 2009, a researcher died after becoming infected with plague bacillus at the University of Chicago Medical School.
