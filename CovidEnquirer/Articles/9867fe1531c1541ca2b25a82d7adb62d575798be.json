            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus that is responsible for the COVID-19 2 pandemic. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 was reported recently, but its 3 transcriptomic architecture is unknown. Utilizing two complementary 4 sequencing techniques, we here present a high-resolution map of the 5 SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome and epitranscriptome. DNA nanoball sequencing 6 shows that the transcriptome is highly complex owing to numerous 7 recombination events, both canonical and noncanonical. In addition to the 8 genomic RNA and subgenomic RNAs common in all coronaviruses, 9 SARS-CoV-2 produces a large number of transcripts encoding unknown ORFs 10 with fusion, deletion, and/or frameshift. Using nanopore direct RNA 11 sequencing, we further find at least 41 RNA modification sites on viral 12 transcripts, with the most frequent motif being AAGAA. Modified RNAs have 13 shorter poly(A) tails than unmodified RNAs, suggesting a link between the 14 internal modification and the 3 \u2032 tail. Functional investigation of the unknown 15 ORFs and RNA modifications discovered in this study will open new directions 16 to our understanding of the life cycle and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. 17 Kim et al. Highlights 21 \u2022 We provide a high-resolution map of SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome and 22 epitranscriptome using nanopore direct RNA sequencing and DNA 23 nanoball sequencing. 24 \u2022 The transcriptome is highly complex owing to numerous recombination 25 events, both canonical and noncanonical. 26 \u2022 In addition to the genomic and subgenomic RNAs common in all 27 coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 produces transcripts encoding unknown 28 ORFs. 29 \u2022 We discover at least 41 potential RNA modification sites with an AAGAA 30 motif. 31 Kim et al. designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 34 (Zhou et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). Like other coronaviruses (order Nidovirales, 35 family Coronaviridae, subfamily Coronavirinae), SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped 36 virus with a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of~30 kb. 37 SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the genus betacoronavirus, together with SARS-CoV 38 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (with 80% and 39 50% homology, respectively) (Kim et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). Coronaviruses 40 (CoVs) were thought to primarily cause enzootic infections in birds and 41 mammals. But, the recurring outbreaks of SARS, MERS, and now COVID-19 42 have clearly demonstrated the remarkable ability of CoVs to cross species 43 barriers and transmit between humans (Menachery et al., 2017). 44 CoVs carry the largest genomes (26-32 kb) among all RNA virus families 45 (Figure 1). Each viral transcript has a 5 \u2032 -cap structure and a 3 \u2032 poly(A) tail (Lai 46 and Stohlman, 1981; Yogo et al., 1977). Upon cell entry, the genomic RNA is 47 translated to produce nonstructural proteins (nsps) from two open reading 48 frames (ORFs), ORF1a, and ORF1b. The ORF1a produces polypeptide 1a (pp1a, 49 440-500 kDa) that is cleaved into 11 nsps. The \u22121 ribosome frameshift occurs 50 immediately upstream of the ORF1a stop codon, which allows continued 51 translation of ORF1b, yielding a large polypeptide (pp1ab, 740-810 kDa) which 52 is cleaved into 16 nsps. The proteolytic cleavage is mediated by viral proteases 53 nsp3 and nsp5 that harbor a papain-like protease domain and a 3C-like protease 54 domain, respectively.",

While nanopore DRS is limited in sequencing accuracy, it 91 enables long-read sequencing, which would be particularly useful for the 92 analysis of long nested CoV transcripts.

It was previously shown in other168    coronaviruses that transcripts with partial sequences are produced(Furuya and 169    Lai, 1993;Liao and Lai, 1992;Luytjes et al., 1996). These RNAs are considered as 170 parasites that compete for viral proteins, hence referred to as \"defective171 interfering RNAs\" (DI-RNAs) (Pathak and Nagy, 2009). Similar sgRNAs have 172 also been described in a recent sequencing analysis on alphacoronavirus 173 HCoV-229E (Viehweger et al., 2019), suggesting this mechanism may be 174 conserved among coronaviruses. While this may be due to erroneous replicase 175 activity, it remains an open question if the noncanonical recombinations have an 176 active role in the viral life cycle and evolution. Although individual RNA species 177 are not abundant, the combined read numbers are often comparable to the levels 178 of accessory transcripts. Most of the RNAs have coding potential to yield examine if these unknown ORFs are actually translated and yield functional 187 products. 188 As nanopore DRS is based on single-molecule detection of RNA, it offers a 189 unique opportunity to examine multiple epitranscriptomic features of individual 190 RNA molecules. We recently developed software to measure the length of 191 poly(A) tail from DRS data (Choi and Chang, unpublished). Using this software, 192 we confirm that, like other CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 RNAs carry poly(A) tails 193 (Figures 4A-B). The tail is likely to be critical for both translation and replication. 194 The tail of viral RNAs is 47 nt in median length. The full-length viral RNA has a 195 relatively longer tail than sgRNAs. Notably, sgRNAs have two tail populations: a 196 minor peak at~30 nt and a major peak at~45 nt (Figure 4B, arrowheads). Wu 197 and colleagues previously observed that the poly(A) tail length of bovine CoV 198 mRNAs change during infection: from~45 nt immediately after virus entry to 199 65 nt at 6-9 h.p.i. and~30 nt at 120-144 h.p.i. (Wu et al., 2013). Thus, the short 200 tails of~30 nt observed in this study may represent aged RNAs that are prone to 201 decay. Viral RNAs exhibit a homogenous length distribution, unlike host 202 nuclear genome-encoded mRNAs (Figure 4C). The distribution is similar to that 203 of mitochondrial chromosome-encoded RNAs whose tail is generated by 204 MTPAP (Tomecki et al., 2004). It was recently shown that HCoV-229E nsp8 has 205 an adenylyltransferase activity, which may extend poly(A) tail of viral RNA 206 (Tvarogova et al., 2019). Because poly(A) tail should be constantly attacked by 207 host deadenylases, the regulation of viral RNA tailing is likely to be important 208 for viral end replication. 209 Next, we examined the epitranscriptomic landscape of SARS-CoV-2 by using 210 the DRS data. Viral RNA modification was first described more than 40 years 211 ago (Gokhale and Horner, 2017). N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most widely 212 used modification (Courtney et al., 2017; Gokhale et al., 2016; Krug et al., 1976; 213 Lichinchi et al., 2016; Narayan et al., 1987), but other modifications have also 214 been reported on viral RNAs, including 5-methylcytosine methylation (5mC), 215 2 \u2032 -O-methylation (Nm), deamination, and terminal uridylation. In a recent 216 analysis of HCoV-229E using DRS, modification calling suggested frequent 217 Kim et al. Length of poly(A) tail. A-B, Poly(A) tail length distribution of viral transcripts.

But since no direct 218 control group was included in the analysis, the proposed modification needed 219 validation. To unambiguously investigate the modifications, we generated 220 negative control RNAs by in vitro transcription of the viral sequences and 221 performed a DRS run on these unmodified controls (Figure S1A). The partially 222 overlapping control RNAs are~2.3 kb or~4.4 kb each and cover the entire 223 length of the genome (Figure S1B). Detection using pre-trained models reported 224",

Interestingly, modified RNA molecules have shorter poly(A) tails than 249 unmodified ones (Figures 5H and S3). These results suggest a link between the 250 internal modification and 3 \u2032 end tail. Since poly(A) tail plays an important role 251 in RNA turnover, it is tempting to speculate that the observed internal 252 modification is involved in viral RNA stability control. It is also plausible that 253 RNA modification is a mechanism to evade the host immune response.

Like other RNA viruses, CoVs undergo frequent 267 recombination, which may allow rapid evolution to change their host/tissue 268 specificity and drug sensitivity. The ORFs found in this study may serve as 269 accessory proteins that modulate viral replication and host immune response. 270 The RNA modifications may also contribute to viral survival and immune 271 evasion in infected tissues as the innate immune system is known to be less 272 sensitive to RNAs with nucleoside modification (Kariko et al., 2005). It is yet to 273 be examined if the ORFs and RNA modifications are unique to SARS-CoV-2 or 274 conserved in other coronaviruses.

SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase 327 (Invitrogen) was adopted instead of SuperScript III, and the reaction time of 328 reverse transcription was lengthened by 2 hours. The library was loaded on 329 FLO-MIN106D flow cell followed by 42 hours sequencing run on MinION 330 device (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). For nanopore sequencing on 331 SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments by in vitro transcription, the same method was 332 applied except for a total 2 \u00b5g of fragment RNAs and 30 minutes reaction time 333 of reverse transcription. The nanopore direct sequencing data were basecalled 334 using guppy 3.4.5 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) using the high-accuracy 335 model. The sequence reads were aligned to the reference sequence database 336 Kim et al. -k 13 -x splice -N 32 -un\". We used the sequence of the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain 340 (GenBank NC_045512.2) as a backbone for the viral reference genome, then 341 corrected the four single nucleotide variants found in 342 BetaCoV/Korea/KCDC03/2020; T4402C, G5062T, C8782T, and T28143C 343 (GISAID). The sequence alignments were further improved by re-mapping the 344 identified viral reads to the viral genome using minimap2 options \"-k 8 -w 1 345 --splice -g 30000 -G 30000 -A1 -B2 -O2,24 -E1,0 -C0 -z 400,200 --no-end-flt 346 --junc-bonus=100 -F 40000 -N 32 --splice-flank=no --max-chain-skip=40 -un 347 --junc-bed=FILE -p 0.7\". Chimeric reads were filtered out according to the flag 348 from minimap2. The mapped reads from canonical sgRNAs were identified 349 using the start and end positions of large deletions \u2265 10000 nt. For a valid 350 assignment to a species of sgRNA, we required that the start position is between 351 55 and 85 in the genomic coordinate. The first AUG in the downstream of the 352 end position of a large deletion was used for identification of the \"spliced\" 353 product. The dwell time of poly(A) tails were measured using poreplex 0.5.0 ( 354 https://github.com/hyeshik/poreplex). For the conversion from a dwell time to a 355 nucleotide length, we divided a poly(A) dwell measurement by 1/30 of the mode 356 of the poly(A) dwell time of the ONT sequencing calibration control which has a 357 30 nt-long poly(A) tail. 358 DNBseq RNA sequencing Total RNA from SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cell was 359 extracted by using TRIzol (Invitrogen) followed by DNaseI (Takara) treatment. 360 Dynabeads\u00ae mRNA Purification Kit (Invitrogen) was applied to 1 \u00b5g of total 361 RNA for rRNA depletion. RNA-seq library for 250 bp insert size was constructed 362 following the manufacturer's instruction (MGIEasy RNA Directional Library 363 Prep Set). The library was loaded on MGISEQ-200RS Sequencing flow cell with 364 MGISEQ-200RS High-throughput Sequencing Kit (PE 100), and the library was 365 run on DNBSEQ-G50RS (paired-end run, 100 \u00d7 100 cycles).

[Figure 3A] We counted the number of 5 \u2032 and 3 \u2032 sites in 100nt-wide 379 bins. The red dots that indicate the frequently used 3 \u2032 sites were identified using 380 the SciPy's scipy.signals.find_peaks(prominence=2) (Virtanen et al., 2020). 381 [Figures 3B-3G] The JSRs were categorized by the position of 5 \u2032 and 3 \u2032 site 382 positions. A JSR was marked as a leader-to-body junction when the 5 \u2032 site of the 383 deletion is between 55 and 85.

Sampling frequency of a 392 fragment was controlled by the read counts within a 100-nt bin with the lowest 393 coverage in each fragment. We sampled the reads so that the result contain 394 roughly 10,000 reads from every IVT fragment. The viral RNA reads and the 395 downsampled IVT reads were processed for squiggle analyses by ONT tombo396 1.5 (Stoiber et al., 2017) with a minor tune to improve the sensitivity of sequence 397 alignments (-k8 -w1). The modified base detection was done by using the 398 \"model_sample_compare\" mode with an option \"--sample-only-estimates\" 399 unless otherwise specified.
