The infectious nature of the disease (and its death toll) generated a high degree of fear among the public and influenced the parents. Parental anxiety extended to disturbances in family and work life during the child's hospitalization. Moreover, parental response to the child's hospitalization could well be affected by other family members, friends, and colleagues. Some families did not want to tell others that their children were hospitalized due to suspected SARS to avoid stigmatization. Being able to bring favorite toys or personal items to their hospitalized children and the daily telephone calls from pediatricians provided parents with coping mechanisms, thus alleviating part of their uncertainty and anxiety.",

Previous studies showed that specially designed programs can allow children and their families the opportunity to preview the hospital experience to reduce anxiety and enhance coping. 14, 15 Developing a multidisciplinary program for parents at times of infectious disease outbreak on isolation procedures, environment, communication channels, plan of care and treatment, and drugs to be administered with possible side effects may help. Psychological preparation can begin in the accident and emergency department by informing parents about the admission and hospital isolation practices so that they can prepare their children.

The use of advanced communication technologies such as viewing cameras, 3G mobile phones, and telephone conferencing in isolation rooms can facilitate child and parent communication. 13, 16, 17 The small sample size limits generalization to other parents of SARS patients. However, we believe the issues of infection control, isolation, and anxiety could be similar in both SARS and HSS patients. We did not explore the views of pediatricians and nurses on their care provision, the challenges in caring for a child in an isolation setting, their fear of contracting SARS, and their dilemma in providing care to the child while adhering to the minimal contact rule of infection control. 6 The parents of HSS pediatric patients experienced fear and anxiety during their child's hospitalization. The fear arose from the infectious and life-threatening nature of the disease and the immediate isolation. Ample psychological preparedness and appropriate communication by pediatricians and nurses might minimize fear and anxiety, sustain trust, and facilitate a mutual understanding between parents and health care workers during an infectious disease outbreak.",
