            "text": "Immune-Mediated Disorders I mmune-mediated dermatoses are well recognized\" but uncommon skin diseases in dogs and cats. These dermatoses have been reported to account for 1.4% and 1.3%, respectively, of all canine and feline dermatoses examined by the dermatology service at a university small animal practice.P\" They have been subdivided into primary or autoimmune, and secondary or immune-mediated, the latter believed to be primarily diseases wherein tissue destruction results from an immunologic event that is not directed against normal self-antigens. 25 , 65 In autoimmune disease, antibodies or activated lymphocytes develop against normal body constituents and induce the lesions of the disease by passive transfer. is, 59 This may result from failure to eliminate high-affinity self-reactive lymphocytes in primary lymphoid organs or failure to regulate the activity of low-affinity self-reactive lymphocytes.\" A major level of control of the autoreactive clones of lymphocytes is suppression by suppressor T cells that are specific for those clones. 25 , 65 The development of autoimmune diseases is a reflection of a lack of control or a bypass of the normal control mechanisms. Over the years, a variety of possible defects have been described, but the exact abnormal mechanism and what induces these diseases still remain unknown. Some of the possibilities include (1) suppressor T cell bypass, (2) suppressor T cell dysfunction, (3) abnormal major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II expression or interaction, (4) cytokine and receptor ligand abnormalities, (5) autoantigen modification, (6) cross-reacting antigens, (7) inappropriate interleukin (IL)-2 production, (8) idiotype/anti-idiotype imbalance, (9) mutations in receptor affinity, and (10) failure of clonal deletion of low-affinity autoreactive thymocytes. t In addition, there is sexual dimorphism in the immune response, with female sex hormones tending to accelerate immune responses and male sex hormones tending to suppress responses.\"",

After other test results are reviewed, and with the recommendation of the pathologist, the indirect immunofluorescence test may still be performed by an appropriate laboratory or the serum may be submitted to appropriate research centers to support future progress. This sample may also be used at a later date as a pretreatment sample for some serum biochemical parameters.",

These initial attempts at treatment, although often successful, led to many side effects (see Chap. 3 ).

In addition, activation of cholinergic receptors can prevent, stop, and reverse the acantholysis elicited by pemphigus antibodies in vitro. Thus, the acantholysis in pemphigus may be mediated by at least two complementary pathogenic pathways: (1) anticholinergic receptor autoantibodies that weaken intercellular adhesion between keratinocytes via inactivation of the cholinergic receptor-mediated physiologic control of cadherin (desmoglein) expression and/or function, which causes dyshesion, cell detachment, and rounding up (acantholysis), and (2) autoantibodies to other adherence molecules (e.g., desmoglein) that prevent the formation of new desmosomes.",

This hypothesis has been supported by an epidemiologic study correlating exposure to black flies as a risk factor for endemic pemphigus foliaceus.r\" Genetic factors in humans and dogs also appear to be important. In humans, both pemphigus foliaceus and pemphigus vulgaris have HLA associations, and some populations may be susceptible to pemphigus vulgaris due to differences in their immune response genes. 18 Although this has not been demonstrated in dogs, breed predispositions and familial cases have been shown. 47 , 150 Other factors thought to be involved in the (pathogenesis of some cases of pemphigus are drug provocation (especially penicillamine and phenylbutazone), ultraviolet light, and emotional upset.\" 18. 47. 139. 157, 163, 164 Drugs and chronic skin disease both seem to be important in the pathogenesis of some cases of canine and feline pemphigus. 130, 131 Interestingly, drug-induced disease in humans is less commonly associated with classic immunopathologic findings. 172 Possibly, the human druginduced form is more similar to animal pemphigus.

Certain diagnostic features, however, can be applied to the whole group. The most important diagnostic aspects are the history, physical examination, and histopathologic findings. Detection of pemphigus antibody by direct immunofluorescence or immunohistochemical testing may also be helpful but, owing to costs, technical problems, and relatively poor diagnostic sensitivity and specificity at routine laboratories, these tests are not routinely recommended. If they are performed, however, all the pemphigus variants should show an intercellular deposition of IgG or complement components (see Fig. 9 -IA). 47, 163. 164 In three of seven dogs with pemphigus foliaceus, the IgG was of the IgG2 or IgG4 subtypes.P Occasionally, immunoglobulins of other classes are found. Indirect immunofluorescence testing infrequently yields positive results unless a research laboratory is used; even then, results are still not routinely positive.P' Pemphigus erythematosus may show deposition of immunoreactants along the basement membrane zone in addition to the intercellular findings (see Fig. 9 -IB). Microscopic examination of direct smears from intact vesicles or pustules or from recent erosions often reveals numerous nondegenerate neutrophils, occasionally numerous eosinophils, and numerous acantholytic keratinocytes. 55 , 164 One or two acantholytic keratinocytes may be visible in an occasional high-power microscopic field during microscopic examination in any suppurative condition, but when these cells are present in clusters or large numbers in several microscopic fields, they are strongly suggestive of pemphigus.",

The disease develops in dogs with no previous history of skin disease or drug exposure. The second form, drug-induced pemphigus foliaceus, may be more common in Labrador retrievers and Doberman pinschers. Drug-induced pemphigus is becoming more frequently recognized, with several cases associated with the administration of trimethoprtm/sulfonamides.\" The third form occurs in dogs with a history of chronic skin disease. These dogs often have had one or more years of usually pruritic or allergic skin disease. They suddenly experience \"more severe disease with new features\" that ends up being diagnosed as pemphigus foliaceus. These dogs with chronic, disease-associated pemphigus foliaceus often have been exposed to multiple drugs, so their-disease may occasionally be drug-induced, though a cause-and-effect relationship is not obvious, nor does the eruption go away when the drugs are stopped. No seasonality or environmental risk factors were found in a study of pemphigus foliaceus in dogs and cats. 152 Pemphigus foliaceus usually begins on the face and ears ( Fig. 9 -7B); it commonly involves the feet, clawbeds, footpads (villous hyperkeratosis or \"hard pad\") (see Fig. 9 -7C to E), and groin and becomes multifocal or generalized (see Fig. 9 -7A) within 6 months in many animals. Very early lesions consist of erythematous macules that rapidly progress through a pustular phase (see Fig. 9 -2G) and end up as dry, yellow or honey-colored to brown crusts (see Fig. 9 -2H). There are usually scales, alopecia, and erosions bordered by epidermal collarettes. The Nikolsky sign may be present. Mucocutaneous orientation is uncommon, and oral cavity involvement is very rare. Some dogs and cats with pemphigus foliaceus present with only footpad lesions and may be lame.U\" 134 Paronychia and involvement of the nipples are common in cats. 132 Various claw abnormalities (onychodystrophy, onychorrhexis, onychogryposis) occasionally occur in dogs. Nasal depigmentation is common and may result in photodermatitis (see the following discussion of pemphigus erythematosus). Pruritus and pain are variable, and secondary bacterial pyoderma and peripheral lymphadenopathy may be present. Severely affected animals may be anorectic, depressed, or febrile.

After induction, the dosage is tapered to an alternate-day regimen. In cats, patients failing to respond to prednisone may respond to dexamethasone (0.2 to 0.4 mglkg q24h) or triamcinolone (0.4 to 0.8 mglkg q24h) and can be safely maintained by administration of either product every second or third day. It has been suggested that oral triamcinolone may be superior to prednisone and prednisolone; however, this needs to be evaluated.P! Oral glucocorticoids are ineffective or unsatisfactory in at least 50% of cases. In the dog, the next most common treatment is the addition of azathioprine for combination immunosuppressive therapy. In the cat, chlorambucil or chrysotherapy is used.

It has also been suggested to be a mild form of pemphigus foliaceus. The antigen target has not been definitely identified in humans or dogs though, in humans, it is believed to be similar to pemphigus foliaceus.!\" 59 Pemphigus erythematosus has been reported in dogs and cats. 5 ,5, 161, 164 No age or sex predilections are known. In dogs, collies and German shepherds may be predisposed. 55 This disease has been considered to be photoaggravated in some cases, similar to canine discoid lupus erythematosus. This was confirmed in a study demonstrating in vivo and in vitro sensitivity to UVB. 139 Pemphigus erythematosus is characterized by erythematous, pustular dermatitis of the face and ears (see Fig. 9 -7F). Because the primary lesions are transient, dogs and cats typically present with oozing crusts, scales, alopecia, and erosions bordered by epidermal collarettes. The Nikolsky sign is infrequently present. Pruritus and pain are variable. The disease involves, and is often limited to, the facial/nasal region. The nose frequently becomes depigmented, whereupon photodermatitis becomes an aggravating factor (see If the nasal region is primarily involved, the condition is often worse in sunny weather and the dog may be misdiagnosed as having nasal solar dermatitis (\"collie nose\"). Often the depigmentation is an early sign in pemphigus erythematosus. This is in contrast with pemphigus foliaceus, wherein the depigmentation comes later. In addition, the crusting is often milder than what occurs in pemphigus foliaceus. Oral cavity involvement has not been reported, and affected animals are usually otherwise healthy. Occasional animals have isolated skin lesions distant from the face and ears, such as on the paws or genitalia.",

            "text": "The natural course of untreated cases is unclear. Veterinarians have long recognized refractory mucocutaneous ulcerative disorders that resulted in the death or euthanasia of affected dogs. Retrospectively, some of these dogs may have had bullous pemphigoid. On the basis of the small number of cases documented in the veterinary literature, canine bullous pemphigoid is usually a severe disease. The prognosis for true bullous pemphigoid is not yet established, but it appears to be a more localized and more benign disease than epidermolysis bullosa acquisita.P\" Extensive cases may be fatal unless treated. Therapy of canine bullous pemphigoid may be difficult, requiring large doses of systemic glucocorticoids with or without other potent immunomodulating drugs. In one study of nine dogs with subepidermal blistering disease believed to be bullous pemphigoid.l'\" the following observations were made: 1 mglkg prednisolone, given orally q12h, was ineffective for controlling the disease, and 3 mglkg prednisolone, given orally q 12h, was effective for controlling the disease. Two of the nine dogs requiring the larger dose were euthanized, however, because of unacceptable side effects, and another two died after 7 to 10 days of therapy (from acute pancreatitis). Thus, systemic glucocorticoids were unsatisfactory for treatment in four of nine dogs (44%). Suspected bullous pemphigoid cases have, in our experience, usually required combinations of immunosuppressive agents. One case (seen by GE.G.) even required glucocorticoids, azathioprine, and chlorambucil to be kept in remission. Therapy usually must be maintained for prolonged periods if not for life. Thus, the therapeutic regimen must be individualized for each patient, and owner education is essential. Mild cases of canine bullous pemphigoid may be successfully managed with topical glucocorticoids or relatively low doses of systemic glucocorticoids (2.2 mg/kg/day of prednisolone or prednisone orally for induction), and therapy may occasionally even be terminated. 55, 186 Tetracycline and erythromycin have been reported to be beneficial in the treatment of bullous pemphigoid in humans.l\" 189 It is thought that the benefit derived from these drugs is related to their ability to inhibit neutrophil chemotaxis and random migration and to increase dermo-epidermal cohesion and inhibit proteases that might be involved in blister formation.",

These have also been applied to dogs with minor modifications, primarily those reflecting the humoral immunologic responses of the canine (Table 9_4 ).196 Dogs that experience four or more of the modified criteria during any given observation period have systemic lupus erythematosus. It has also been suggested that a probable diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus is appropriate if three criteria are present or polyarthritis with ANA is present. Though these criteria are helpful guidelines, they must be used cautiously. In humans, numerous situations that may lead to a false diagnosis based on the American Rheumatism \u2022 The prognosis in systemic lupus erythematosus is generally unpredictable and depends on the organs involved.f\" 55, 196, 200, 217 In general, the earlier the diagnosis is made, the better the prognosis. In the dog, it appears that patients with joint, skin, or muscle disease respond more reliably to medication and are maintained in relatively long periods of clinical remission. On the other hand, dogs with severe hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, or both often do not respond satisfactorily to systemic glucocorticoids and require other immunomodulating drugs, splenectomy, or both. Animals with glomerulonephritis regularly experience progressive renal failure in spite of therapy, and this finding indicates a poor prognosis, Therapy of systemic lupus erythematosus must be individualized. The initial agent of choice is probably large doses of systemic glucocorticoids (e.g., 2 to 6 mg/kg prednisone q24h). 47, 55, 196, 217 When systemic glucocorticoids are unsatisfactory, other immunomodulating drugs may be useful: azathioprine (Imuran) given orally at 2.2 mg/kg q24h, then q48h (dog only), or chlorambucil (Leukeran) given orally at 0.2 mg/kg q24h, then q48h. 47 . 55, 217 Splenectomy may be needed for patients with severe hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, or both. Cyclophosphamide, 2 mg/kg q24h orally, 4 days a week, may be given for acute episodes of hemolytic anemia.P\" Vincristine, 0.01 to 0.025 mg/kg intravenously, once weekly, may be useful when thrombocytopenia is severe.!\" Levamisole (Levasole), given orally at 2.5 mglkg q48h, has occasionally been beneficial in dogs and humans with systemic lupus erythematosus.f The combination of levamisole, 2 to 5 mg/kg (maximum dose, 150 mg) q48h, with prednisone, has been reported to give good results in 75% of canine cases, with remissions lasting for months to years . 196, 200 The prednisone is initially dosed at 0.5 to 1.0 mglkg twice daily, then tapered off over 1 to 2 months with long-term therapy consisting of just levamisole. Only 2 of 33 dogs treated experienced unacceptable side effects (neutropenia, excited behavior, and aggressiveness) from levamisole.P\" 200",

Early depigmentation manifests as a slate blue or gray color change (see Fig. 9 -24B). A helpful early change is the conversion of the normally rough, cobblestone-like architecture of the nasal planum into a smooth surface (see Fig. 9-24C and D) . Later lesions commonly include erosion, ulceration, and crusting. Initially, lesions tend to occur dorsally at the junction between the nasal planum and haired skin or along the ventral or medial aspects of the alar folds. Typically, with time, nasal involvement becomes more extensive and the lesions may spread up the bridge of the nose. Less commonly, lesions may be visible periocularly, on the pinnae (see Fig.  9 -24F), on the distal limbs, and on the genitals. The lips may also be involved (see Fig.  9-24E) , and small punctate ulcers may be detected in the oral cavity (see Fig. 9-24G) , most commonly involving the tongue or palate (see Fig. 9-24E) .

Initially, topical glucocorticoid therapy is most successful when potent agents, such as betamethasone or fluocinolone in DMSO (Synotic), are applied every 12 hours. After the dermatosis is in remission, topical glucocorticoids are applied as needed (once daily, q48h, and so forth), and less potent agents (e.g., 1% to 2% hydrocortisone) may be sufficient for maintenance. Anecdotal reports indicate that the topical application of 1% cyclosporine is effective. 232a In some cases, a I-month course of systemic prednisone (2.2 mglkg orally q24h until remission is achieved, then q48h) is helpful. The topical agents may then be sufficient to maintain the remission. Though not frequently effective as the sole therapy, systemic vitamin E (400 to 800 IV daily) is recommended because it may have a beneficial effect. 234 Vitamin E appears to have a 1-to 2-month lag phase before its benefit is recognized clinically, and systemic glucocorticoids may be used concurrently during this period. Vitamin E should be administered 2 hours before or after feeding. Two of us (D.W.S., W.H.M.) have had good success in some cases with the oral administration of products containing omega-Szomega-f fatty acids (DVM Derm Caps) and now use these products instead of vitamin E. Various combinations of fatty acids, vitamin E, and other treatments have been used successfully.

The simultaneous expression of MHC II and CDla provides altered keratinocytes with the capability of antigen presentation. Keratinocytes in adjacent, noninflamed epidermis also expressed ICAM-l and MHC II, suggesting that the upregulation of both adhesion molecules may represent an early phase in the development of erythema multiforme.

The first point of separation is on presentation because most cases of erythema multiforme are relatively mild; have an acute onset of lesions, including classic target lesions; have no fever or prodromal symptoms; and, if there is mucosal involvement, it is usually mild and limited to the oral cavity.306 These cases are self-limited, and lesions clear within I to 3 weeks.",

In the third neutrophilic form, the major lesion is thrombosis and resultant tissue ischemia. This pattern is more often associated with gram-negative septicemia and infections that target the endothelial cells.P Eosinophilic vasculitis is associated with arthropod reactions, food hypersensitivity, eosinophilic granuloma, and mast cell tumors.P-72, 342 However, the \"vasculitic\" nature of these eosinophil-associated lesions has been challenged.v\" Interstitial granulomatous dermatitis with vasculitis associated with cyclosporine administration was observed in a dog with periocular edema and alopecia and a swelling at the base of one ear. 349 In humans, vasculitis is also categorized by the size of the affected vessel (large or small), though this has been considered of little value in the dog and cat. 72 , 339 In most cases, cutaneous vasculitis involves small dermal blood vessels (postcapillary venules). Vasculitis can occur via immune and nonimmune mechanisms.P: 330, 341 As a cause of cutaneous disease, vasculitis most commonly is thought to be immunologically mediated and the result of a drug reaction or infection.F: 347 The pathomechanism of most cutaneous vasculitides is assumed to involve Type III hypersensitivity reactions.14, [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] 69 Type I hypersensitivity reactions may be important in the initiation of immune complex deposition in blood vessel walls. However, it appears to be more complex, and multiple mechanisms likely playa role. It has been postulated that differences in membrane receptors (probably adhesion molecules and cytokines) for immunoglobulin and complement on leukocytes may account for the different histologic appearances of neutrophilic and lymphocytic vasculitides.\" Additionally, initial neutrophilinduced damage to endothelial cells could result in the expression of \"not self' antigens, whereupon dendritic cells and T cells could initiate a secondary cell-mediated immune response, thus perpetuating the vascular disease and producing a lymphocyte-dominated infiltrate.P? In cutaneous necrotizing vasculitis, endothelial cells show increased expression of ICAM-l and E-selectin. 347 E-selectin is an adhesion molecule for neutrophils. In some cases and forms of vasculitis there has been an association with the presence of autoantibodies that react with neutrophil cytoplasmic structures (e.g., proteinase-3, myeloperoxidase) or endothelial cells. 337 , 347 Cutaneous vasculitis may be associated with coexisting disease (infections, food hypersensitivity, insect bites, malignancies, connective tissue disorders [such as lupus erythematosus]), precipitating factors (infections, drugs, vaccines), or it may be idiopathic (about 50% of all cases).\" Infections may induce immune complex or septic vasculitis. 22, 72, 282 About 7.5% of the dogs treated with itraconazole at 10 mglkglday experience cutaneous vasculitis (lymphedema and/or necrotizing lesions on one or more limbs), whereas dogs treated with 5 mglkglday do not experience this reaction.P\" Focal cutaneous vasculitis reactions at the site of rabies vaccination have been described in dogs, and rabies viral antigen was detected in blood vessel walls.F' In a retrospective study of cutaneous vasculitis in 18 dogs and 1 cat, food hypersensitivity was diagnosed in 2 dogs, adverse drug reaction in 2 dogs, rabies vaccine reaction in 4 dogs, and the condition was idiopathic in 10 dogs.

Palpable purpura, with lesions pinpoint to 10 em in diameter, is characterized by reddened areas that rapidly become dark red to purple to black and then slough. Lesions are multiple and most commonly occur on the limbs and, less commonly, the groin and trunk (Figs. 9-58 and 9-59). Within 1 to 2 days, the lesions ulcerate and discharge a serosanguineous fluid. The ulcers are well-demarcated and usually extend into the subcutis. Healing is slow, resulting in scar formation within 1 to 2 months. Many dogs experience pitting edema, especially distal to the stifle or elbow, on limbs that have ulcers. In most dogs, new lesions do not develop after the initial lesions resolve. Some dogs experience pyrexia, lethargy, polydipsia, polyuria, vomiting, dark or tarry stools, and acute renal failure. This syndrome is thought to be produced by verotoxin (shiga-like toxin) elaborated by E. coli in contaminated raw beef products (similar to the herrwlytic-uremic syndrome in people).329 A genetic predisposition may help explain the susceptibility of Creyhounds.P'\" Familial (autosomal recessive trait) cutaneous vasculopathy of German shepherd dogs has been reported in young puppies.\"?
