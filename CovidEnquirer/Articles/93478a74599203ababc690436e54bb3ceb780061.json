Simultaneously, and at each dose of cocaine, unconditioned psychomotor stimulant behavior induced by cocaine was studied in terms of multiple concurrent measures of spontaneous behavior and by activity pattern analysis, a study of spatial patterns of locomotion. Time course studies showed that the neurochemicai effects of cocaine (10, 20 , and 40 mg/kg SC) significantly (p<0.0001) increased accumbens synaptic concentrations of dopamine (DA) and concurrently and significantly (p<0.0001) decreased accumbens synaptic concentrations of serotonin (5-HT) in a dose response manner. Simultaneous behavioral time course studies showed that cocaine (10, 20 , and 40 mg/kg SC) significantly (p<0.0001) increased ambulations (locomotor activity), fine movements (stereotypic movements of sniffing and grooming) and rearing behavior, while significantly decreasing agoraphobic behavior, as measured by a statistically significant increase in central ambulations (p<0.0001). The high dose of cocaine (40 mg/kg SC) significantly increased fine movements over those produced by the lower doses of cocaine (p<0.0002). One import of the findings is that the DA and 5-HT biogenic amine response occurs in a behavioral paradigm of psychomotor stimulation, which is a known measure of reinforcement. Another is that the biogenic amines DA and 5-HT are affected by cocaine in this reinforcement paradigm with exactly opposite directionality. Finally, acute cocaine administration is shown to produce a dose response inhibition of agoraphobia (fear), which is highly correlated (p = .983, p<0.01) with the opposing effects of cocaine on the accumbens biogenic amines, DA and 5-HT.",

Within this theoretical consideration, psychomotor stimulant behavior, i.e., approach behavior or locomotor behavior is a predictor and a measure of reinforcement (32) . Within this context, cocaine is known as a distinctive psychomotor stimulant. Moreover, compelling evidence through various reinforcement paradigms shows that cocaine exerts its potent reinforcing properties through a dopaminergic molecular component, particularly in mesolimbic neuronal circuitry, and particularly at the dopamine transporter (6, 26, 27, 31) . In tandem, the hyperactive locomotor activity produced by psychomotor stimulants has been shown to be highly correlated with increased DA levels in nucleus accumbens, postmortem (18) . Thus the first purpose of this paper was to study a possible underlying commonality between a reinforcing dopaminergic mechanism and a reinforcing behavioral mechanism of cocaine, simultaneously, in vivo, on line, instantaneously and in real time, to further elucidate what appears to be the satisfying or compensating events of cocaine.",

Extending the dopaminergic hypothesis to other neurotransmitters then is becoming crucial in terms of cocaine treatment modalities. A 5-HT mechanism is a good candidate for study because psychiatric and emotional disorders, including anxiety, have as their underlying neurobiological etiology, deficits in 5-HT functioning (16) . Indeed, cocaine has been reported to cause such psychiatric disorders (15) . A review of the literature shows (a) that cocaine is a potent reuptake inhibitor of 5-HT at the synapse (28), (b) that cocaine depressed 5-HT levels, postmortem (24) , (c) that cocaine decreased 5-HT synthesis and turnover post mortem (11) , (d) that impulse frequency in dorsal raphe 5-HT neurons was depressed by cocaine (5) and (e) that there may be a role for the reinforcing effects of cocaine through a 5-HT mediation (22) . As is with DA mechanisms, 5-HT-cocaine interactions are associated with transporter mechanisms (25) . Thus the second purpose of this paper was to study the effect of cocaine on the indoleamine, 5-HT, in nucleus accum- 05, 95% confidence limits of the mean (CL)] between ten and twenty minutes after cocaine injection. Cocaine significantly decreased synaptic 5-HT (p<0.05, 95% CL) between forty and fifty minutes after cocaine injection (cf. the Results section for ANOVA statistics).

            "text": "In the present studies, in vivo voltammetry was used. Specif-ically, semidifferential electroanalysis was used because this tech nique provides a clear separation of the biogenic amine neurotransmitters, DA and 5-HT. Dopamine and 5-HT were detected with a stearate working electrode (diameter: 175-200 p.m) at oxidation potentials of +0.14---0.015 V and +0.29---0.015 V respectively. The microelectrode was fabricated by pulling the Teflon coat of a stainless steel wire (Medwire Corp., Mt. Ver-non, NY) 500 Ixm over the edge of the stainless steel component of the wire to form a microcavity inside the teflon well. The microcavity was then packed with a graphite-nujol-stearate paste mixture. (2) . After each electrode was fabricated, it was examined for homogeneity of paste distribution under a dissecting microscope at 30 \u00d7 magnification (Nikon, SMZ-1 with Nikon Transformer Illuminator XN, Garden City, NY). Then, a gas chromatographic and a combustion analysis method for the exact determination of electrode paste composition after paste synthesis can be performed. These methods are also published (3) . A medium exchange technique was performed on each electrode in vitro before surgical insertion and implantation of the electrode in vivo. This procedure consisted of performing a selective preconcentration of the analytes, DA and 5-HT onto the electrode surface in phosphate buffer (0.01 M) pH 7.4, in a closed semidifferential circuit, scanning from -0.2 V to +0.4 V, at 2 nA/V, three separate times on three separate days. This method achieves optimum and stable preconcentration of analytes and improves the selectivity, the efficacy and the sensitivity of the electrode for analytes in electrolyte environments. The in vivo electrochemical signal, both in vitro and in vivo, for DA was detected, without interference at the same oxidation potential, from 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) or ascorbic acid. The electrochemical signal, both in vitro and in vivo, for 5-HT was detected, without interference at the same oxidation potential, from the 5-HT metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) or uric acid. Potentials were applied with a CV37 detector (BAS, West Lafayette, IN). The CV37 detector was electrically connected to a Minigard surge suppressor (Jefferson Electric Magnetek, NY) which was then connected to an electrical ground in isolation. Potentials were applied from -0.2 V to +0.4 V with respect to a Ag/AgC1 (1 M NaC1) electrode, at a scan rate of 10 mV/s. One voltammetric scan was scanned in 60 seconds. Nonfaradaic charging current was eliminated in the first 25 seconds. The neurotransmitters, DA and 5-HT, were detected in approximately 13 and 12 seconds each respectively, in a sequential manner. The coulombic efficiency for the detection of serotonin was two-to three-fold greater than that for DA with a stearate electrode (1). The recording probes were stable in vivo throughout the studies without significant changes in their recording characteristics.",

Working electrodes were also postcalibrated in vitro in a fresh deoxygenated phosphate buffer solution, pH 7.4 (0.01 M) made exactly as was the precalibration buffer, after each study was completed. Peak areas for DA and 5-HT were then measured and compared with in vitro measured precalibration peak areas for DA and 5-HT.

            "text": "Statistical differences between DA and 5-HT effects with and without cocaine treatment were determined by standard repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). ANOVAs were followed by the post hoc test, Fisher PLSD, (least square difference) (Statview, BrainPower Inc., Calabasas, CA) to determine statistically significant differences in neurotransmitter changes which occurred hourly after drug administration. Ninety-five percent confidence limits measures were also performed on each point of the time course data following the administration of drug. Behavioral (frequency) data were treated the same. Changes in DA and 5-HT values after drug treatment are presented as percent change of measurements (peak area) from unstimulated baseline values (peak area) to minimize normal between animal variations. Neurochemical and behavioral correlations were statistically analyzed by the Spearman Rank Coefficient of Correlation (p). 1.0, p<0.01) . Figure 3a -d shows specific activity patterns induced by cocaine (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg SC) and by saline respectively. It is evident that cocaine induces longer acting psychomotor stimulant effects with a dose response relationship. The most dramatic inhibition of the agoraphobic response at the highest dose of cocaine is notable. Table 1 shows a time course effect of cocaine (10 mg/kg SC) on the psychomotor stimulant behavior: ambulations, rearings, fine movement and agoraphobic behavior, as measured by the central ambulation parameter. Cocaine (10 mg/kg SC) significantly (ANOVA: p<0.0001, N=6, df=4,20) increased ambulations (F=42.589), rearing (F= 47.095), fine movements (F= 42.864) and central ambulations (F= 18.052) above basal same animal control values. Concurrent DA and 5-HT changes were highly correlated with ambulation behavior (p=.9, p<0.01). The reduction in agoraphobic behavior is significant (p<O.0001) and occurs immediately after cocaine injection. Moreover, DA and 5-HT changes were highly correlated with the reduction in agoraphobic behavior (p= 1.0, p<0.01). Table 2 . DA and 5-HT changes were highly correlated (p= .9, p<0.01) with ambulation behavior. Agoraphobic inhibition began to occur immediately and significantly (p<0.0001) after cocaine injection. The inhibition of agoraphobia was also highly correlated with simultaneous DA and 5-HT changes induced by cocaine (p = 1.0, p<0.01). Table 3 ambulations (F=63.961) above basal same animal control values. Inhibitory agoraphobic behavior occurred immediately and significantly (p<0.0001) after cocaine injection. Reduction in agoraphobia was highly correlated with cocaine-induced alterations in the biogenic amines, DA and 5-HT (p = .95, p<0.01). DA and 5-HT changes were highly correlated with ambulations behavior (p= .85, p<0.05), rearing behavior (p= .8, p<0.05) and fine movements (p= .95, p<0.01). Fine movements were significantly (p<0.0002) increased over those which were induced by cocaine (20 mg/kg SC). DISCUSSION The data show that synaptic concentrations of DA in nucleus accumbens in freely moving rats are significantly increased by cocaine. These data are consistent with others (7, 17, 21) , and lend support to the generally accepted hypothesis that the continuous changes in synaptic DA induced by cocaine are due to an indirect agonist action (12) , which occurs by either a DA reuptake inhibition (4), increased DA release (3a,29) or both. The data support the reported action of an acute decreased response of somatodendritic DA neurons to a cocaine-induced terminal accumbens activated DA increase (9) . The strong correlation between the cocaine-induced increase in DA synaptic concentra-tions and the cocaine-induced psychomotor stimulant behavior supports the hypothesis that the neurochemically reinforcing and the behaviorally reinforcing properties of cocaine are coincident in homology (32) . The long-lasting effect of cocaine, when it is given by the subcutaneous route, is consistent with the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous cocaine (19) . The significantly increased stereotypic grooming and sniffing behaviors (fine movements) after cocaine are most dramatic at the highest dose of cocaine. This is a finding consistent with previous behavioral data (23) .",

            "text": "That cocaine decreased synaptic concentrations of 5-HT, in vivo, is a new finding. The opposing directionalities of the serotonergic and the dopaminergic action of cocaine show a high correlation to cocaine-induced measures of psychomotor stimulant activity. The relevant outcome of this finding is that decreased synaptic concentrations of 5-HT are highly correlated with the reinforcement capabilities of cocaine. Also important about the present findings is that the depressed serotonergic neurochemistry, underlying the action of cocaine on presynaptic mesolimbic circuitry, is consistent with a direct coupling to a cocaine-induced depressed somatodenditic dorsal raphe impulse frequency, previously shown by others (5). The previous paper (5) attributed the silenced 5-HT neurons in dorsal raphe after cocaine to a consequence of somatodendritic autoinhibition. It was postulated that 5-HT neuronal depression may be due to a compensatory neuronal feedback from cocaine-induced enhanced 5-HT-reuptake inhibition at neuronal terminals. The present data, however, indicate a direct autoreceptor-type agonistic action for cocaine on 5-HT. The discovery that cocaine acts peripherally at the 5-HT 3 receptor (10), although as a weak antagonist, supports this hypothesis. Since the CNS serotonergic properties of cocaine are just emerging, it is not unlikely that cocaine exerts a 5-HT agonist action centrally and a 5-HT antagonist action peripherally, similarly to the action of the psychostimulant lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) (8) . Future provocative strategies for cocaine treatment modalities, then, can be based on the simultaneous and opposing modulatory roles for DA and 5-HT in reinforcement.",

Synaptic concentrations of DA increased maximally to 176.25% of control (p<0.05) and this occurred 190 minutes after injection of cocaine. Analysis of the electrochemical signal showed a trend towards baseline in the 4th hour (approximately 50% of the animals had a DA signal returning to baseline). At the 20 mg/kg SC dose of cocaine, those DA synaptic concentrations that did not return in the fourth hour to baseline did so during the fifth hour (data not shown). Synaptic concentrations of 5-HT reached a maximum decrease to 62.81% of control (p<0.05) at 190 minutes and showed a trend toward a return to baseline values in the 4th hour.
