MERS is responsible for the death of more than 587 people all over the world from 2012 to 2015 (MOH, 2015) . First and the highest number of cases are reported from Saudi Arabia (Zaki et al., 2012) . Now in 24 countries MERS cases are reported (Bermingham et al., 2012) , in which Middle East countries are on the top. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) belong to the genera Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus. Betacoronaviruses are further divided into four genetic clades, clade a to clade d (Gorbalenya et al., 2004) . MERS-CoV belongs to Betacoronavirus clade c. The other virus of this family is responsible for common cold except SARS, which is responsible for the death of more than 8400 cases and 800 deaths (World Health Organization, 2014) .",

Although, According to the current reports the transmission rate is decreasing but still this seems to be widely present in dromedary camels in the Middle East countries, the current report from Agriculture ministry of Saudi Arabia has conducted a test on 112 camels and have found that 85% of the animals carried a deadly MERS-CoV, transmission is expected to continue for a long period of time in these regions hence situation is not completely under control.

Although MERS-CoV can be inhibited by type I interferons in vitro but patients will not be cured completely. Some drugs like ribavirin (plus IFNa2b) (Omrani et al., 2014) , cyclosporin A, and mycophenolic acid, Chloroquine, chlorpromazine, loperamide, and lopinavir inhibit MERS-CoV growth in vitro but their activity on the human is yet to be established. However, they can be the future drugs for MERS-CoV. ''Prevention is better than Cure\" is the best proverb for MERS until we have the specific treatment for MERS. Camel owners, health workers, and pilgrims are easiest targets for MERS-CoV so they should take extra precautions, like health workers should wear protective gears like gloves and masks while treating the patients, Camel owners should avoid direct contact with camel's eye, nasal fluid, and faeces. Good infectious disease surveillance and control measures can prevent the major outbreak of MERS during mass gathering activities like Haj or Umrah. The Ministry of Health, Saudi Arabia has done a commendable job to overcome this serious issue by spreading awareness, proper diagnosis and treatment which clearly shows the significant fall in a number of cases reported.",
