            "text": "One of the most important concerns for managing public health is the prevention of infectious diseases. Although vaccines provide the most effective means for preventing infectious diseases, there are two main reasons why it is often difficult to reach a socially optimal level of vaccine coverage: (i) the emergence of operational issues (such as yield uncertainty) on the supply side, and (ii) the existence of negative network effects on the consumption side. In particular, uncertainties about production yield and vaccine imperfections often make manufacturing some vaccines a risky process and may lead the manufacturer to produce below the socially optimal level. At the same time, negative network effects provide incentives to potential consumers to free ride off the immunity of the vaccinated population. In this research, we consider how a central policy-maker can induce a socially optimal vaccine coverage through the use of incentives to both consumers and the vaccine manufacturer. We consider a monopoly market for an imperfect vaccine; we show that a fixed two-part subsidy is unable to coordinate the market, but derive a two-part menu of subsidies that leads to a socially efficient level of coverage.",

The World Health Organization (1999) reports that infectious diseases are the world's biggest killer of young adults and children, and describes them as a ''crisis of global proportions. . . threatening hard-won gains in health and life expectancy.'' Every one in two deaths in developing countries is caused by an infectious disease; globally, infectious diseases account for over 13 million deaths every year. In 2000, HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria, together, killed 5.7 million people and caused debilitating illnesses in millions more (World Health Organization, 2002) . Influenza and pneumonia claim about 250,000-500,000 lives every year globally, and about 36,000 deaths in the US alone (World Health Organization, 2005) . In addition to the emergence of new infectious diseases, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or SARS (World Health Organization, 2003) , some of the diseases that were once eliminated resurface in populations earlier considered free of the disease. Old infections, such as tuberculosis and diphtheria, have occurred in large epidemics in Europe and other industrialized countries. The 1996 outbreak of polio in Albania, Greece, and the then Federal Republic of Yugoslavia indicates that an infectious disease can easily resurface, if immunization coverage is allowed to drop (World Health Organization, 1999) .",

Among a variety of intervention strategies, we focus on vaccination programs in this research, as they are well-known for both their efficiency and cost-effectiveness. In fact, the World Health Organization (2000) considers vaccination to be the ''ultimate weapon against infection and drug resistance.'' For influenza (or flu, more commonly), Germann et al. (2006) argue that vaccination, among other control programs such as social distancing, school closure, and use of antivirals, remains the most effective tool to eliminate the epidemic. They show that even if a flu vaccine is poorly matched to the circulating strains, it can still drastically slow down the spread of the disease.",

As the fraction of vaccinated individuals grows, the chance of contacting an infection diminishes. Therefore, the willingness to pay for the vaccine reduces, an effect contrary to the positive network effect, in which the willingness to pay for a product increases with the size of the network (Katz and Shapiro, 1985) .",

Some research in the operations management area has been devoted to the role of supply uncertainty and its effect on the supply chain outcome. For example, Chick et al. (2008) argue that the production risk due to unknown vaccine yields, which is assumed by vaccine manufacturers, is the primary reason for an insufficient supply of influenza vaccine in the market. They design a variant of a cost sharing contract which provides incentives to manufacturers, as well as to governments that purchase vaccines, so that a supply chain achieves an optimal balance between for-profit manufacturer incentives and public health incentives. Deo and Corbett (2009) examine the role of production yield in explaining the limited number of players in the influenza vaccine market. However, these works do not consider the negative network effect and the consumers' willingness to pay for the vaccine. On the other hand, the demand-side issue has started receiving some attention in more recent literature in operations management. For example, Cho (2010) studies consumers' willingness to pay, and Arifoglu et al. (2012) address network externality effects in a similar context. However, the objective of these articles are quite different from the current one, as we are concerned with designing contracts to coordinate the vaccine market.",

They show that a voluntary vaccination program without any government intervention fails to achieve the vaccination level necessary to eliminate the epidemic. Brito et al. (1991) provide a more comprehensive model in their economic analysis of the situation, but lack the necessary epidemiological details. Geoffard and Philipson (1997) also consider vaccine subsidies with the goal of complete eradication of the disease, but do not consider the cost of production and do not discuss an efficient coordination of the vaccine market. They find that a subsidy program would not be effective at achieving eradication because of network externalities. In a more recent article, Althouse et al. (2010) study how public subsidies can help bring the vaccine uptake to a more efficient level in the case of a disease that is subject to network externalities, 1 but they consider only the consumers-their subsidy is designed to maximize the aggregate consumer utility.

Recently, Mamani et al. (2012) consider the role of governments in market coordination through subsidies in the presence of multiple vaccine manufacturers, but they do not take into account the yield uncertainty inherent in the production process, which, as shown here, has major implications in the subsidy program. In particular, they find that a constant one-part subsidy coordinates the market in a deterministic setting. In extending their results, one would naturally expect that a constant two-part subsidy should align the incentives of different parties under the presence of production uncertainty. Our results, however, indicate that, when the yield is stochastic, a constant two-part subsidy is just not sufficient to align both consumer demand and production quantity with the first-best outcome; rather, a menu of subsidies is necessary. The purpose of this research is to bridge this conspicuous gap in the literature by considering yield uncertainty and network externalities together in order to develop a more comprehensive analysis and to provide a more practical coordination scheme.",

Cho (2010) considers the issue of consumers' willingness to pay and price elasticity to determine the socially optimal policy for selecting strains that are to be included in an influenza vaccine. This threshold policy is obtained based on a trade-off: On one hand, retaining the current composition of influenza strains could lead to an ineffective vaccine if new strains were to emerge. On the other, including new strains in the vaccine composition could increase the production yield uncertainty. Arifoglu et al. (2012) combine consumption-side externalities with the supply uncertainty, and show that the limited availability of vaccines lead to an inflated demand. They quantify the level of ineffectiveness of the decentralized model with partially centralized scenarios. In this paper, we, too, combine negative network effects with yield uncertainty to identify the level of inefficiency in a market-based system. However, unlike Arifoglu et al. (2012) , we investigate this inefficiency with the lens of contract theory to design incentive 1 The role of subsidies in market coordination has also been studied in other contexts that exhibit network effects. For example, within the context of security, Zhuang (2010), Zhuang et al. (2007) show that providing fully subsidized security to targeted agents (with heterogeneous time preferences) can reduce the total social cost of security and improve the performance of the system. mechanisms that can induce consumers and suppliers to make decisions that are aligned with the social optimum.",

(2012) ; similar to theirs, our model also includes consumers' freeriding behavior, the production cost borne by the vaccine manufacturer, and a central planner's desire to achieve the social optimum using subsidy. In addition, however, we also consider the production yield uncertainty faced by the manufacturer. In our model, the yield is stochastic, and hence the vaccine coverage is uncertain. Consequently, the quantity decision is made by the manufacturer under yield uncertainty, whereas the demand decisions are made by consumers facing both the supply uncertainty and the negative network effect. These two decisions are not necessarily aligned with the social objective, and a central planner has a role in aligning them towards the social optimum. This modeling difference has critical consequences on the equilibrium solution, social optimum, and coordination mechanisms. In particular, in (Mamani et al., 2012) , where the yield is deterministic, a one-part subsidy is shown to be sufficient in coordinating the market. In our paper, unsurprisingly, the stochastic yield makes a one-part subsidy ineffectual for market coordination. Perhaps more unexpectedly, even a two-part fixed subsidy scheme cannot coordinate the market. The coordinating subsidy is a two-part menu of subsidies that depends on the coverage. This fundamental difference in the equilibrium outcome is essentially a result of the significant differences in the modeling contexts, requiring different analyses.",

For example, Taylor and Yadav (2011) investigate two forms of contracts for public products (e.g., essential medicines): a purchase subsidy (to the retailers) and a sales subsidy (to the consumers). They show that when consumers are homogeneous in their valuation of the product, the subsidy provider (donor) would prefer a purchase subsidy, whereas a sales subsidy is more preferable for heterogeneous consumers. A key assumption in (Taylor and Yadav, 2011) is that the retailer has freedom to set prices after market uncertainties are resolved and the product is acquired. This is a valid assumption for their model as they consider populations in developing countries where the retailer can change prices based on market conditions. In our model, however, the uncertainty exists with respect to the yield (not the demand), and pricing and production decisions are made prior to the realization of the yield. The manufacturer, once committed to a fixed price, cannot change it easily. Ovchinnikov and Raz (2012) study a number of mechanisms to coordinate price and quantity decisions in a market for public goods where these decisions are made simultaneously. They show the effectiveness of subsidies compared to rebates in coordinating either price or quantity decisions. They also show that a joint rebate-subsidy mechanism can coordinate both decisions. However, both the aforementioned papers assume a deterministic supply but a random demand. We, on the other hand, consider a scenario where supply is uncertain and demand is deterministic (e.g., the case of pre-orders for influenza vaccine). Finally, we focus on a specific class of products-vaccines-rather than a generic product. This allows us to derive a demand function that is based not only on economic parameters such as the vaccine price, but also on other epidemiological factors such as the population's perception of the vaccine effectiveness and the dynamics of the infection.",

Second, our model contributes to the operations management literature by considering contracting issues within a production process with random supply and price-dependent demand. While others have examined single-period models with random and price-dependent demand (Petruzzi and Dada, 1999) , as well as supply contracts in that setting (Cachon, 2003) , we show that effects of random supply are different than those of random demand when considering price-sensitive consumers, and thus the resulting coordinating mechanism must differ accordingly. More specifically, we show that a menu of two-level incentive mechanism is needed to coordinate the market, and a simple two-part fixed subsidy is not sufficient to align both the quantity and pricing decisions simultaneously. Our results have important implications in terms of the role of governments and global health organizations in managing vaccine programs and provide directions for appropriate incentive schemes that can work towards a greater good.",

At the beginning of the production season, the manufacturer decides the vaccine price and the production volume, and incurs the corresponding production cost. Next, consumers follow with their choice of whether (or not) to get immunized, which determines the demand for the vaccine. This decision is based on the consumers' expected utility that takes into account their probability of infection, disutility from the infection, and the price they pay for the vaccine.

This assumption, however, may not be valid for a number of infectious diseases of interest, such as seasonal influenza and HIV. 3 In this regard, we follow Mamani et al. (2012) and assume that vaccines may indeed be imperfect-a vaccinated consumer, albeit less likely, can still get and transmit the infection. There are two ways in which an imperfect vaccine affects the transmission of the disease: First, imperfect vaccines can reduce the probability of becoming infected if exposed to an infectious contact, which is known as the vaccine effect on susceptibility. Second, imperfect vaccines can also affect the probability of disease transmission when a vaccinated individual gets infected; this is known as the vaccine effect on infectiousness (Datta et al., 1998; Hill and Longini, 2003) . To combine these two effects, we take an approach that is similar to the one adopted by Longini et al. (1978) . Let 0 < / 6 1 be the vaccine efficacy parameter that reflects the combined effect of vaccine on transmission, which includes both susceptibility and infectiousness effects.

It must be noted that, if R 0 6 1, the infection probability is zero, and the disease transmission dies out. Hence, for the remainder of the paper, we only consider the interesting case of R 0 > 1. We note that F \u00bc R 0 \u00c01 /R 0 is the minimum vaccination fraction that drops the overall infection probability, r(f), to zero.

In contrast, if R 0 < 1 or / < 1, the term P(f) \u00c0 p(f) is lower than 1 and is no longer independent of f. This implies that, for the same consumer, WTP u is lower than in the limiting case considered above, and its specific value depends on the overall coverage level. Therefore, the desire to purchase depends not only on a consumer's own preference, but also on decisions made by other consumers. This happens because an unvaccinated individual could benefit from the (partial) immunity of the vaccinated population. Put differently, unlike typical products or services, in the vaccine market, a consumer does gain some utility from the vaccine, without having to actually purchase it.

Indeed, beyond this point, the vaccine price becomes so low that production costs outweigh expected revenues and the manufacturer chooses not to enter the market. This threshold occurs at a lower value of f when the vaccine is less perfect because the equilibrium price of a vaccine with a lower / is also lower. We also notice that for a fixed coverage level f, the lower the value of /, the lower is the quantity produced by the manufacturer, since the vaccine price decreases as / decreases. Finally, we note that q m (f) is not necessarily monotonic in f, even to the left of the threshold; this can be clearly seen in the plot corresponding to / = 1. There, the quantity first increases in f as a larger demand provides incentives to supply higher quantities.

In classical Newsvendor models, the price-dependent demand is either (linear) additive or (exponential) multiplicative.

First, for low values of the production cost, the vaccine coverage at equilibrium decreases with vaccine effectiveness, but this trend reverses for high production cost. This illustrates that a more ineffective vaccine requires more coverage in the population to achieve the same level of protection, which is possible only when the vaccine is cheap enough to produce. When it is more expensive, a lack of effectiveness makes the vaccine less worthwhile to purchase, and coverage drops. Moreover, the equilibrium quantity is lower than when the vaccine is perfect.

This is to be expected-as the vaccine effectiveness goes down, it becomes necessary to immunize a larger fraction of the population to obtain the same level of immunity and to produce more to meet that higher coverage level. However, at high values of c, maintaining a high level of immunity is no longer desirable. There, the trend reverses. Both optimal production and coverage level decrease quickly and reduce to zero as the vaccine effectiveness decreases. It is not optimal to keep producing an ineffective vaccine at a high production cost. It is also clear from these plots that the socially optimal production and coverage levels increase with R 0 .

Of course, as amply demonstrated in Fig. 4 , achieving the herd immunity may not always be optimal for the society as a whole (if, for example, the vaccine is very expensive to produce and an infection causes little harm or disutility to consumers). Government intervention should thus aim at not necessarily achieving a vaccine coverage equal to the critical vaccination fraction, but rather to some fraction that optimizes a measure of the societal benefit.

We focus on subsidies to simultaneously coordinate price and quantity decisions. Furthermore, since both price and quantity decisions are made before resolving the yield uncertainty, a simple one-parameter subsidy is not sufficient to coordinate both decisions at the same time. This is due to the fact that a subsidy that can provide incentives to the individuals to ensure a sufficiently high level of vaccine coverage (coordinate price) does not necessarily align the manufacturer's production decision, under yield uncertainty, with the central planner's objective (coordinate quantity). A similar behavior can be observed in the classical Newsvendor model with price-dependent demand (e.g., Cachon, 2003) . Therefore, we consider a two-parameter incentive mechanism (s, e), in which a subsidy s is provided to the consumers (to coordinate the vaccine price or equivalently vaccine coverage, f), and, under a cost sharing proposal, the central planner agrees to pay e to the manufacturer for every production unit (to coordinate production quantity, q). 5 The cost sharing component in this contract is analogous to the purchase subsidy, and the subsidy component of our contract is similar to the sales subsidy in (Taylor and Yadav, 2011) . One way to implement the contract, among several other possible alternatives, would be to offer both incentives as a package. The manufacturer could purchase the raw materials for the production directly from the government at a per unit cost of c \u00c0 e. In return, the manufacturer would get a payment of s for each vaccine sold to the consumers, whereas the customers would only pay w \u00c0 s to the manufacturer at the time of purchase. Thus, the effective production cost to the manufacturer would become c \u00c0 e, and the demand-price relationship can be written as:",

It is interesting to observe, from Fig. 5 , that as R 0 increases, i.e., as the negative externality effect lessens, the subsidy to the manufacturer decreases and that to consumers increases. Indeed, a higher value of R 0 implies a higher vaccinated fraction at the social optimum, hence a higher subsidy to consumers is necessary to induce the socially optimal coverage. Some of this subsidy to consumers gets transferred to the manufacturers via a higher demand, and thus the direct subsidy to the manufacturer decreases. Finally, as the vaccine becomes less effective, that is, as / becomes smaller, the subsidy to consumers decreases. Two effects are at play here for the overall impact of vaccine effectiveness on the subsidies. On one hand, a less effective vaccine requires more individuals to be vaccinated to achieve the same level of immunity within the population; hence, for low c, f \u2044 increases as / decreases (see Fig. 4 ). On the other, subsidizing a less effective vaccine represents a more wasteful measure to protect the population as more vaccinated individuals will contract the disease, especially when the vaccine is costly to produce. As a result, for high values of c, f \u2044 is zero for a less effective vaccine, but f \u2044 is positive for a more effective vaccine. The socially optimal subsidy program is a combination of these two effects. We find that the second effect dominates the first and the subsidy to consumers is lower for a less effective vaccine. Finally, a quick comparison of the first two panels in Fig. 5 with the last two reveals that our results are quite robust to distributional assumptions about U.",

In order to see how well the subsidy scheme works, we also plot the social welfare when no subsidy is provided. It is clear from this figure that the subsidy scheme provides a significant increase in the total social welfare. We can also see that the social welfare increases with /, while it decreases with R 0 . This is expected. As / increases, the vaccine becomes more effective, resulting in better control of the disease and higher social welfare. On the other hand, as R 0 increases, the disease becomes more contagious and the social welfare diminishes. Finally, as expected, the total social welfare decreases with c-as the cost of production increases, the optimal production quantity becomes lower and the resulting social welfare goes down.",

Vaccines are available for many of these diseases and are generally considered a safe and cost-effective prevention tool. Government intervention via vaccine subsidy programs is an important weapon against the spread of infectious diseases. Without this type of programs, spontaneous market behavior leads to a vaccine coverage that is often too low to achieve herd immunity and is always less than the socially optimal level of vaccine coverage. There are two reasons for this: On the consumer side, there are negative network effects of vaccines-as more individuals get vaccinated, the chance of infection, and hence the willingness to pay for the vaccine, for an unvaccinated individual, decreases. On the supply side, production uncertainties make it too risky for manufacturers to produce sufficiently large quantities. Government intervention may improve public health by providing subsidies as incentives to reduce these inefficiencies. In this paper, we synthesize concepts from three areas-economics, operations management, and epidemiology-to analyze the effect of the network externalities and yield uncertainties on the outcome of the monopoly market as well as the first best solution. We also derive a coordination scheme via subsidies to align the market outcome with the centralized solution. We show that a fixed one-or two-parameter subsidy structure cannot provide appropriate incentive to the consumers and the vaccine manufacturer to guarantee a socially optimal vaccine coverage that maximizes the total social welfare, but a two-part menu of subsidies can.",

This is amply illustrated in Figs. 4 and 5, where we plot the socially optimal outcomes and subsidy payments, respectively, for two different distributions of the yield. In the first two panels in each figure, the yield is uniformly distributed and, in the last two, it follows a truncated normal distribution (with the same mean and variance as the uniform distribution). It can be clearly seen that the results do not seem sensitive to the distribution of the production yield; in fact, two very different types of distributions lead to very similar results for other key metrics such as equilibrium outcome (Figs. 2 and 3) and social welfare (Figs. 5 and 7) as well. This robustness of the equilibrium outcome, first best solution, coordinating subsidy scheme, and social welfare with respect to the distribution of the yield has important practical implications. Often, it is quite difficult to accurately estimate the distribution of an uncertain parameter such as the production yield. It is common to have good estimates for some of its characteristics, such as the mean and variance, but to expect a full knowledge of the exact distribution is often unrealistic. Our results indicate that this would not be an issue within our research context, as the findings are almost unchanged when the distribution is modified while retaining the mean and variance at their respective values. The material implication is that inaccuracies in estimating the yield distribution would not have much of an impact in the implementation of our approach.",

It would be interesting to investigate the impact of competition in this market. We could do this by extending our model to consider two or more competing firms in the same vaccine market. Although the algebra becomes intractable, we can obtain numerical results in that case. Second, in this study, we assume a constant unit cost of production. In reality, there are usually large fixed costs and economies of scale in vaccine production. Both these factors tend to impact the production decision in exactly the opposite manner, when compared to the impacts of negative network effect and yield uncertainty-while the former two favor a higher output, the latter two tend to induce the manufacturer to under-produce. This trade-off is an interesting topic to explore. While analytical solutions are difficult to obtain, once again, we can obtain numerical solutions for this trade-off. Furthermore, we do not address the issue of how to pay for the subsidy. In order to achieve revenue-neutrality, one would need to develop a combined tax-subsidy scheme where the taxes exactly pay for the subsidies. Finally, in practice, a big portion of the total demand for influenza vaccine is realized as pre-orders from healthcare providers, and the manufacturer caters to the current unmet demand only after meeting the pre-orders received prior to vaccine production. In this paper, we assume that the total demand from a healthcare provider for a certain vaccine price effectively mirrors the actual demand from consumers based on demand and price elasticity information from prior periods; this translates to merging the actual consumers with healthcare providers as the ''consumers'' in our model. It may be interesting to extend the model to distinguish the pre-order and consumer demands. We are examining all these issues in an ongoing project to develop a more complete picture of the public policy challenges in this area.",
