As of March 02, 2020, there were over 87137 confirmed cases worldwide, with 2977 deaths. 1 To date, several latest studies have reported the clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), including signs, symptoms, laboratory test results, imaging features, therapeutic strategies and effects, and multiple organ dysfunction. [2] [3] [4] [5] Notably, acute myocardial injury (AMI), defined as troponin T-hypersensitivity (TNT-HSST) serum levels > 99th percentile upper reference limit (>28 pg/ml) by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force for myocardial infarction and non-myocardial infarction diseases, 6 was detected in approximately 7.2%-12% COVID-19 patients in previous studies. [2] [3] Furthermore, both severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have been linked to acute myocarditis, AMI, and rapid-onset heart failure. 7-9 Reportedly, 2 nearly 40% of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID- 19 have underlying comorbidities such as cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases.",

However, further evidence is urgently needed to assess the mechanism of cardiac damage in large-sample autopsy or biopsy studies. Previous studies have indicated that SARS-CoV can mediate MI and damage associated with the downregulation of the myocardial angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 system; this may be responsible for the myocardial dysfunction and adverse cardiac outcomes in patients with SARS, which has also been detected in COVID-19 patients. [19] [20] [21] [22] Until now, the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV has not been completely understood. Although full-genome sequencing and phylogenic analysis has shown that SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, the pathophysiological mechanism of cardiac infection or damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 needs to be further validated in future studies. 23 In our study, AMI usually occurred in COVID-19 patients with old age, underlying comorbidities, severe or critically severe NCP, and ARDS. Among 44,672 patients with confirmed COVID-19, as reported in the China CDC Weekly on Feb 11, 2020, approximately 31.2% patients were aged >60 years. The overall case fatality rate was 2.3% (1,023 deaths); more importantly, the majority (81%) of deaths occurred in patients aged \u2265 60 years or in those with underlying medical conditions. 24 Similarly, in our study, all the six AMI patients were aged >60 years and had one or more underlying conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, COPD, and cardiovascular diseases.

Notably, although only six patients had clinically confirmed AMI based on strict inclusion criteria in our study, most patients had elevated levels of one or more cardiac injury biomarkers and LV diastolic dysfunction. Although long-term outcomes of COVID-19 patients with AMI need to be further validated, significantly more clinical attention should be paid to avoid underdiagnosis because of classic symptoms and because of the possible overshadowing of cardiac complications in the context of coronavirus, as cautioned by the ACC Clinical Bulletin. 16 To date, the underlying mechanisms of AMI and potential impacts in COVID-19 patients remain unknown. Clinically, the increased serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12, interferon-gamma, interferon-inducible protein 10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, suggest that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is associated with cellular immune deficiency and coagulation activation. 17 Thus, the direct effects of the virus, cytokine storm induced by viral invasion, and sustained inflammatory response are presumed to be the main pathophysiological mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Cardiac markers of 23 (43.39%) patients were within the normal range (4 [17.39%] aged >60 years; median age, 40.00 years [IQR 23.00, 51.00]). There were no significant gender differences among the three subgroups. Epidemiology of all the groups was similar (all p>0.05), such as being a local resident, Wuhan residence exposure, and COVID-19 exposure. No patients had direct Huanan seafood market exposure. No exact epidemiological link was found between the first case and the later ones. Almost all the patients' first onset symptoms were fever (n=47, 88.68%) and dry cough (n=41, All rights reserved.

Further analysis (Table S2 in supplementary appendix) demonstrated that increased CRP levels (OR, 1.186; 95CI% [1.047, 1.344]), representing the inflammatory condition of the body, may be a risk factor for AMI in COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients with more severe NCP type (OR, 2.896; 95CI% [1.266, 6.621]) may have a higher risk of AMI than other patients. It is worth mentioning that the presence of comorbidities (OR, 4.336; 95CI% [1.11, 38.55]) may be the most critical risk factor for AMI in COVID-19 patients.",
