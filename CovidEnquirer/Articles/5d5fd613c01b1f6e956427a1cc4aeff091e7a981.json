Thomas D\u00f6 rner and Andreas Radbruch look at the secreted, circulating, and locally produced immunoglobulins (Igs) that have at least the potential to neutralize virus at the point of mucosal entry, the holy grail for vaccinologists. Their discussion of the balance between established memory, circulating Ig, and recall responses has particular relevance for immunization strategies.

Kaech and Wherry focus particularly on the nature of these lymphocyte subsets and the factors influencing the underlying cell-fate decisions, introducing a burgeoning area of molecular and cellular analysis.

Through the course of evolutionary time we would, as implied in the discussion by Steven Deeks and Bruce Walker, select a human population that lives happily with HIV. Socially, of course, we could never accept the massive dieback in the human family that this would involve. Even so, some of the most promising avenues for developing novel possibilities for HIV control lie in determining how the inherent genetic resistance mechanisms described by Deeks and Walker work at the molecu-lar and cellular levels. As those of us who are involved in the Centre for HIV and AIDS Vaccine Immunology (CHAVI), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) vaccine grant administered by Barton Haynes at Duke University, realize, we have to go back to analyzing the basics of virus transmission, genetic resistance, and the earliest phases of both innate and adaptive immune responsiveness if we are to develop novel conceptual and technical strategies for defeating this virus.",

Of course, that might be in the process of changing as we incorporate new molecular strategies gained from the analysis of the innate immunity into product design, but we should be modest when we recall that we still have no effective vaccines to protect children in the developing world against infection with malaria species. and Mycobacterium tuberculosis.",
