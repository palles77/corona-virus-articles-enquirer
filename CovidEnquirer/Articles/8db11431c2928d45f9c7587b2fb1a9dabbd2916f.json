Objective To identify and determine the prevalence of major respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal secretions and adenoid tissue pre-and postoperatively of children undergoing adenoidectomy. Methods A prospective observational study was conducted in 36 patients under 12 years of age with upper airway lymphoid hypertrophy who were undergoing adenoidectomy, in which various respiratory viruses were investigated using realtime polymerase chain reaction in adenoid tissue and nasopharyngeal secretions collected preoperatively and 30 days postoperatively. Results At least 1 viral agent was isolated in any of the samples collected in 58.3% of children and 25.9% of total samples. Respiratory viruses were identified in 33.8% of preoperative nasopharyngeal specimens and in 19.8% of postoperative secretion. Of the 21 patients with positive results for any respiratory virus, 6 (28.6%) had more than 1 virus. Considering all 36 respiratory viruses found, the main agent isolated was rhinovirus (27.8%), followed by bocavirus (22.2%). Conclusion The virus found more frequently in all samples was rhinovirus. After removal of adenoid tissue, there was a decrease in the prevalence of the virus contained in nasopharyngeal secretion 30 days after surgery.",

There is no certainty about what determines the onset of chronic infection. Viral infection with bacterial infection may be one of the triggering mechanisms of chronic infection, but the effects of the environment, personal factors, and diet, among others, may also be involved. Several studies and theories have been published based primarily on allergic mechanisms or viral and/or bacterial infectious processes. [6] [7] [8] [9] Although it is a very common health problem in daily medical practice, the presence of respiratory viruses in lymphoid tissues of the nasopharynx and oropharynx and their impact on recurrent infections and hypertrophy of these tissues are not yet fully understood and are being studied by numerous researches. Many authors have identified the presence of multiple viral agents in these tissues, latent in asymptomatic patients. 6, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] Most of these studies in the literature are performed among symptomatic and hospitalized children with acute disease, which hampers a better understanding of this pathophysiology.",

The authors evaluated 121 children who underwent adenotonsillectomy and found high rates of viral detection in adenotonsillar tissues. The authors were researching respiratory viruses on palatine tonsils, adenoid tissue, nasal secretions, and peripheral blood but did not evaluate the postoperative nasopharyngeal secretions. 8 Review of the literature found no studies comparing the prevalence of the virus in nasopharyngeal secretions pre-and postoperatively. Some studies revealed that the adenoid tissue may be a reservoir of viruses. Comparing the prevalence of virus pre-and postoperatively, we aimed to analyze a possible influence of adenoid tissue in the maintenance of these viruses in secretions. After the analysis of preoperative nasopharyngeal samples, this study found that 33.3% of patients (n \u00bc 12) were positive for at least 1 respiratory virus.",

After surgery, the positivity of respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal secretions of these patients decreased: in only 13.9% of patients (n \u00bc 5) was at least 1 viral agent isolated in the sample. In the postoperative secretions, 8 respiratory viruses were detected, and adenoviruses were identified in 2 patients. These results suggest a decrease in the prevalence of the virus after surgery (p \u00bc 0.0522). However, the number of patients in the study is relatively small, and a greater number of samples are required to confirm or reject this hypothesis.",

These data suggest that the persistence or latency of respiratory viruses on nasopharyngeal and adenoid tissue after an acute infectious process may be related to the pathogenesis of lymphoid hypertrophy of the upper airways and that these tissues may function as a reservoir of virus, with possible influence on its transmission in the community. After adenoidectomy, a decrease in respiratory viruses present in nasopharyngeal secretions was observed. From this finding, we can infer a lower chance of occurrence of infections as well as secondary superinfections and virus transmission to contacts after surgery. Considering the age group studied, in which there is a greater interpersonal contact, this decrease in the circulation of respiratory viruses becomes important for public health, with positive impact on the quality of life of these children.
