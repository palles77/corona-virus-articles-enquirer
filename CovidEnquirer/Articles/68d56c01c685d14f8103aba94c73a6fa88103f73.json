            "text": "Vascular endothelial activation, marked by de novo expression of E-selectin, is an early and essential event in the process of leukocyte extravasation and inflammation. Evidence suggests that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) ameliorates inflammation in animal models of renal disease, implying that HGF might inhibit specific components of the inflammatory response. This study examined the effect of HGF on endothelial E-selectin expression in acute inflammation induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a. In vitro, HGF suppressed TNF-a-induced cell surface expression of E-selectin in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and inhibited E-selectin mediated monocytic adhesion to endothelial monolayers. HGF activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt that in turn inhibited its downstream transducer glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)3. Blockade of the PI3K-Akt pathway with specific inhibitors abrogated HGF induced inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3 and suppression of E-selectin. In addition, selective inhibition of GSK3 activity by lithium suppressed TNF-a-induced E-selectin expression and monocytic adhesion, reminiscent of the action of HGF. Moreover, ectopic expression of an uninhibitable mutant GSK3b, in which the regulatory serine-9 is replaced by alanine, abolished HGF's suppressive effect on endothelial E-selectin. In vivo, administration of exogenous HGF reduced endothelial expression of E-selectin induced by bolus injection of TNF-a. This was associated with less sequestration of circulating fluorescence-labeled macrophages in the kidney. These findings suggest that HGF ameliorates acute renal inflammation in part by downregulating E-selectin mediated macrophage adhesion to the inflamed endothelium.",

            "text": "Inflammation, characterized by tissue infiltration by leukocytes, is a basic biological reaction and part of the innate defense to injuries induced by various pathogenic factors. 1 An inflammatory response of appropriate magnitude and timing is crucial to tissue repair and homeostasis. 1, 2 Most inflammatory responses are acute and self-limiting; however, an excessive inflammatory reaction may result in critical and fatal conditions as systemic inflammatory response syndrome, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and acute renal failure. In addition, if the inflammatory response is prolonged or frequently relapsing chronic persistent inflammation develops, which may promote fibrosis and loss of organ function. 3 Immunosuppressants including glucocorticoids are widely used to treat patients with excessive or chronic inflammation and reduce the likelihood of these complications, despite an increased risk of opportunistic infections. [1] [2] [3] Vascular endothelial activation and dysfunction play a critical role in the inflammatory response. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Normally, leukocytes continuously patrol the vasculature, alert for signals of inflammation. Proinflammatory substances released by pathogens (e.g. lipopolysaccharide) or by damaged tissue (e.g. tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a) upregulate the expression of adhesion molecules on the endothelium and initiate the migration of leukocytes to the inflamed area. Leukocyte migration from blood to tissues involves several steps: rolling, sticking, diapedesis, and chemotaxis. 9 Among these processes, rolling is the earliest and indispensable event initiating leukocyte extravasation and inflammation. Rolling is mediated by the selectin family of adhesion molecules, endothelial E-selectin, platelet P-selectin, and leukocyte L-selectin. 10 Both E-and P-selectins are expressed by endothelial cells; L-selectin is found only on leukocytes. P-and L-selectins are constitutively expressed whereas E-selectin is elicited by proinflammatory stimulate and is considered essential for leukocyte trafficking. 10 The importance of E-selectin in initiating inflammation is demonstrated by the potent anti-inflammatory effect of E-selectin blockade. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a mesenchymalderived, pleiotropic multifunctional growth factor. 17 Upon binding to its receptor, c-Met, HGF triggers several signal transduction pathways, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt, Ras-Mek-Erk, and Stat3 pathway, and modulates diverse cell processes including mitogenesis, motogenesis, morphogenesis, and antiapoptosis/survival in epithelial and endothelial cells. 17, 18 Evidence suggests that HGF ameliorates both acute and chronic injury in various organs including kidney, 19 liver, 20 lung, 21 and intestine. 22 Of note, inflammation is an invariable finding in both acute and chronic disease. Inflammation subsides in response to HGF treatment; however, the potential beneficial effects of HGF on inflammation have been largely overlooked. Recently, we reported that HGF treatment substantially attenuated inflammation in the rat remnant kidney model of chronic renal failure; 23 however, the mechanisms responsible for this action remain uncertain. In this study, we show that HGF abrogates monocyte to endothelial adhesion and ameliorates acute renal inflammation by suppressing endothelial Eselectin expression. These findings suggest that the beneficial effects of HGF in both acute and chronic disease may be partially ascribed to its systemic anti-inflammatory action on the endothelium.",

E-selectin is found both on the cell membrane and in the intracellular reservoir in activated endothelial cells. 24 Only membrane Eselectin is accessible to leukocytes and functionally active in mediating the endothelial-leukocyte adhesion.

            "text": "Inflammation is a common finding in both acute and chronic injuries of diverse etiologies. Leukocyte to endothelium adhesion mediated by the selectin family of adhesion molecules, in particular E-selectin, is an indispensable event initiating the inflammatory reaction. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] In the present study, we found that HGF suppresses monocyte to endothelial adhesion and attenuates acute renal inflammation via inhibition of endothelial E-selectin expression. HGF exerts this action via activation of PI3K-Akt-GSK3b pathway in endothelial cells. This finding complements our recent report demonstrating that HGF attenuates renal inflammation in the rat remnant kidney model of chronic renal disease. 23 HGF has also recently been reported to be anti-inflammatory in non-renal diseases. 21, [31] [32] [33] [34] In a murine model of inflammatory bowl disease (IBD), HGF gene transfection diminished inflammatory infiltrates in the intestinal epithelium. 31 Similarly, Arthur et al. 32, 33 reported that direct intravenous infusion of exogenous HGF to rats with IBD significantly ameliorated gross and microscopic bowl inflammation. In a murine model of airway hyperresponsiveness, airway inflammation was reduced by administration of recombinant HGF. 34 In the present study, exogenous HGF significantly attenuated TNF-a induced macrophage infiltration and acute renal inflammation in rats. The finding that HGF has systemic anti-inflammatory effects suggests that HGF may intercept common processes in the general inflammatory reaction rather than organ-specific mechanisms. Leukocyte adhesion to an activated endothelium is a prerequisite for generating an inflammatory infiltrate and is found in virtually all-inflammatory diseases. 8, 9 Increased expression of particular adhesion molecules is an important early marker of endothelial activation. E-selectin is of particular interest because it is only found on the inflamed endothelium in contrast to other adhesion molecules, which have a wide constitutive tissue distribution. 9 Previous studies demonstrated that inhibition of endothelial activation by glucocorticoids 35 or statins 36 attenuates inflammation by decreasing endothelial expression of adhesion molecules, including E-selectin. Similarly, blocking the interaction between the endothelium and leukocytes with E-selectin antibodies as well as selectin antagonists also ameliorates various inflammatory diseases. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] For instance, anti-Eselectin blocking antibody or E-selectin gene disruption protected mice from ischemia-reperfusion induced acute renal failure. 12 Similarly, antibody blockade of E-selectin decreased adventitial inflammation and attenuated intimal hyperplasia in rat carotid arteries after balloon injury. 13 Moreover, transgenic mice producing soluble E-selectin that can competitively inhibit the binding of inflammatory cells to E-selectins on the endothelium are resistant to bleomycin induced chronic pulmonary inflammation and lung fibrosis. 14 All these studies suggest the therapeutic potential of Eselectin blockade in inflammatory diseases. In our study, HGF was found to suppress endothelial E-selectin expression in cultured HUVEC cells and in vivo in rats injected with TNF-a. Suppression of E-selectin in turn was responsible, at least in part, for HGF-induced suppression of monocyte to endothelial adhesion and inflammation in the kidney.",

            "text": "The mechanism by which HGF regulates endothelial Eselectin expression is not well studied. The PI3K-Akt pathway is a major signaling cascade triggered by the binding of HGF to its cognate receptor c-Met on endothelial cells. [17] [18] [19] In the present study, HGF activated PI3K-Akt in endothelial cells and specific blockade of PI3K-Akt overrode HGF suppression of E-selectin expression. These data are consistent with another study in a murine model of endotoxemia, 37 in which blocking the PI3K-Akt pathway with wortmannin or LY294002 enhanced LPS-induced E-selectin levels and exacerbated macrophage infiltration in liver and kidney. GSK3 is an important downstream substrate of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway that has been shown to regulate the inflammatory response. 29, 38 A ubiquitously expressed serinethreonine kinase, GSK3 exists in two isoforms, GSK3a and GSK3b and is a unique signal transducer in that it is constitutively active under normal conditions. GSK3 is inactivated in response to PI3K signaling, as a result of Aktmediated inhibitory phosphorylation. 39, 40 We found that HGF induced inhibitory phosphorylation of both GSK3a and GSK3b in endothelial cells. Selective inhibition of GSK3 by lithium also inhibited phosphorylation of GSK3 and suppressed TNF-a-induced E-selectin expression in HUVEC cells, reminiscent of the action of HGF. Furthermore, ectopic expression of a mutant construct encoding the uninhibitable GSK3b blunted HGF-induced suppression of E-selectin, again suggesting that HGF inhibits E-selectin via inhibition of GSK3b. A regulatory role for GSK3b in E-selectin gene expression was also reported by Hoeflich et al. 29 In that study, E-selectin-luciferase transcription induced by TNF-a or IL-1b was reduced in GSK3b \u00c0/\u00c0 cells and could be restored by the expression of exogenous GSK-3. The mechanism by which GSK3b inactivation modulates E-selectin is unclear. Recent data suggest that GSK3b is an essential element for NF-kB activation. [41] [42] [43] Sequence analysis reveals the presence of multiple putative kB elements in the promoter region of the E-selectin gene. 44 In addition, interaction between NF-kB and kB elements in the E-selectin promoter is required for E-selectin expression. 44, 45 Therefore, it is possible that HGF inhibition of endothelial E-selectin and inflammation might be due to suppression of NF-kB via GSK3b inactivation. GSK3b has been recently suggested to be a key regulator of multiple cellular processes implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetes and chronic inflammatory diseases. 26, 38 Due to its regulatory effect on GSK3b, HGF might represent a novel potential strategy for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.",

In experiments with GSK3 blockade, the general apoptosis inhibitor BOC-Asp-CH 2 F (Enzyme Systems Products, Dublin, CA, USA) was added to the culture at the final concentration of 50 mM to reduce cell loss due to induction of apoptosis. 27 Cell viability was assessed by Trypan blue exclusion. Human monocytes (THP-1) and RAM were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) and were cultured in suspension respectively in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and Ham's F12K containing 15% fetal bovine serum. For fluorescent viable labeling, THP-1 and RAM cells (1 \u00c2 10 7 ) were incubated in their respective media containing 5 mg/ ml Calcein-AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) at 371C for 30 min. Excess dye was removed by washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline.",

After a 45-min equilibration period, HGF (100 mg/kg wt) or an equal volume of vehicle was administrated as a bolus injection into the left carotid artery. After 30 min, a bolus injection of rat TNF-a (2 mg/kg wt) (R&D system) or vehicle was given to stimulate the systemic inflammation. To demonstrate the pro-inflammatory role of Eselectin, a rabbit anti-E-selectin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or preimmune IgG was given prior to TNF-a injection. At 4 h after TNF-a injection, fluorescent-labeled RAM cells (1 \u00c2 10 4 ) resuspended in normal saline were infused via the carotid artery. Rats were killed before or 30 min after RAM cell infusion and various organs harvested for further investigation. One portion of the kidney was immediately frozen for cryostat sectioning.

To examine the effect of HGF on Eselectin expression in acute inflammation in vivo, rats were given a bolus intra-arterial injection of TNF-a. After 4 h, fluorescent immunohistochemistry revealed abundant staining for E-selectin in the kidney(Figure 8c) that was distributed in the pattern of the interstitial microvasculature (Figure 8e).
