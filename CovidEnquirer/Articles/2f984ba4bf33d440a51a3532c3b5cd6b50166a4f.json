The working group included representation from the Healthcare Infection Society, Public Health England, Health and Safety Executive (HSE), Association of National Health Occupational Physicians, Health Protection Scotland, Infection Prevention Society, Intensive Care Society, Clinical Virology Network and British Infection Association. The guidance is based upon a review of the literature (which can be accessed separately) and expert consensus. 3 Although the guidance also takes account of relevant current UK health and safety legislation, the majority of the material will be more widely relevant.",

The European standard for filtering face masks [EN 149 (currently 2009)] lists three classes of filtering face piece (FFP): FFP1, FFP2 (approximately equivalent to N95) and FFP3. 5 These are classified by inward leakage in laboratory tests and simulated real-life use. Inward leakage can result from penetration through the material matrix of the face piece or through any gap between the face piece and the wearer's face (see Appendix 1 'fit testing'). FFP3 offers the highest level of protection. Although most of the evidence base supporting the use of FFP respirators in the prevention of airborne transmission of infection is based upon N95/FFP2 devices, FFP3 is the only FFP class acceptable to HSE for use against infectious aerosols in health care in the UK (Appendix 3). In the USA, N95 (approximately equivalent to FFP2) is acceptable, as is the case in a number of other countries. ; cardiopulmonary resuscitation; bronchoscopy; surgery and postmortem procedures in which high-speed devices are used; dental procedures; non-invasive ventilation (e.g. bi-level positive airway pressure ventilation and continuous positive airway pressure ventilation); high-frequency oscillatory ventilation; and induction of sputum. NB. These procedures are likely to change as new evidence emerges. b Maintaining immunity in the healthcare worker population helps to prevent transmission of vaccine-preventable diseases to and from healthcare workers and patients. Staff who have regular clinical contact with patients and who are directly involved in patient care should have a documented history of all immunization. NB. In relation to childhood illnesses and use of masks, no vaccine offers 100% protection and a small proportion of individuals get infected despite vaccination. 20 Personal protective equipment should be used as a means of protecting from the risks that remain. 4 For further information regarding selected vaccinations for healthcare workers, please refer to the Green Book. 20 c In routine clinical practice, healthcare workers do not commonly wear masks when dealing with patients presenting with symptoms of a 'common cold' or 'influenza-like illness'. However, in a patient with undiagnosed respiratory illness where coughing or sneezing are significant features, or in the context of known widespread respiratory virus activity in the community or a suspected or confirmed outbreak of a respiratory illness in a closed or semi-closed setting, the need for appropriate respiratory and facial protection to be worn should be considered as per Figure 1 .",
