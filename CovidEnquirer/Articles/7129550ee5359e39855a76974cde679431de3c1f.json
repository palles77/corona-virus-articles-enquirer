Equilibrium constants could be calculated for four of the five mAbs tested. These were in the nanomolar range. The ranking order was very similar to that obtained with an affinity ELISA, (an equilibrium system) but as others have found, affinities were 2-lo-fold lower as measured by SPR (a flow system). No data were obtained with mAb HC58 although it had one of the highest affinities using an ELISA format, and was 2%fold higher than another mAb (HCIO) which gave good data by SPR. This may relate to the orientation of its binding on the virion surface. The K d,J ,<I' of the Fabs was only 3-lo-fold higher compared to their IgGs. Fab from the lowest affinity IgG (HClO) could not be measured, possibly because it fell below the threshold for detection.",

No-antibody-affinity data have been published before for whole enveloped virus particles. The applications of SPR to virology were first highlighted (Dubs et al., 1991 , D.J. Schofield, NJ. Dimmock /Journal of' Virological Methods 62 (1996 33-42 1992) when it was shown that interactions between antibodies and a number of animal viruses particles (vaccinia virus, poliovirus) and plant viruses (TMV and cowpea mosaic virus) could be studied in real time.

(2) Interactions of viral components with antibody in relation to neutralization including the use of surrogate antigens, such as purified viral protein, viral peptides and anti-idiotype antibodies instead of whole virus. The majority of data relate to HIV-l and its surface proteins: gp120 (Richalet et al., 1994; VanCott et al., 1994; Roben et al., 1994; Burton et al., 1994) and gp41 (Conley et al., 1994; Mani et al., 1994) , and also peptide T which blocks gpl20-CD4 binding (Ramsdale et al., 1993) . Mouse hepatitis coronavirus has also been studied, but functional affinity data for IgG, F(ab')2 and Fab were obtained using an anti-idiotype mAb as a surrogate viral antigen (Lamarre and Talbot, 1995) . (3) Screening of combinatorial Fab fragments prior to neutralization studies using HIV-l gp120 (Ditzel et al., 1995; Roben et al., 1994; Barbas III et al., 1994; Burton et al., 1994) and respiratory syncytial virus F glycoprotein (Barbas III et al., 1992; Lounsbach et al., 1994) . (4) Cell receptor-virus interactions using human rhinovirus serotype 3 with ICAM-(CD54) (Casasnovas and Springer, 1995) and HIV-l gp120 with soluble CD4 (Brigham-Burke et al., 1992) . Viral peptides, recombinant viral proteins and purified viral proteins offer convenient ways of determining antibody affinity values. However, the structure, conformation and interrelationship between such subunits and whole virus particles is likely to differ. Antibody affinities obtained using viral subunits as antigens may give misleading data as there are differences in antigen conformation and density/accessibility of epitopes compared to whole virions. The importance of studying virus-antibody interactions in a manner that is as close to the in vivo situation as is possible has been highlighted recently as differences between the monomeric and oligomeric forms of the envelope protein of HIV-l have been found (Sattentau and Moore, 1995; Moore et al., 1995) .",

            "text": "SPR is an optical phenomenon which permits biomolecular interactions to be monitored in real time and without the need to label the interacting components (Pharmacia BIAtechnology Note 101). SPR arises when light illuminates a thin conducting film under certain conditions. The interaction between electromagnetic vectors in an incident light beam and surface plasmons (free electron constellations in the conducting film) results in a resonance (Welford, 1991) . Total internal reflection produces an evanescent wave which is propagated away into the medium of lower refractive index. SPR arises if the interface is coated with a thin conducting layer (in the Pharmacia Biosensor BIAliteTM instrument this is gold). The resonant coupling between the incident light energy and the surface plasmons in the film occurs at a specific angle of incident light. The light energy is absorbed and this causes a drop in the light intensity for this angle. The incident light is focused on the surface as a wedge, and such a drop in intensity at the resonance angle shows up as a shadow in the light wedge that is reflected off the conductor surface. This resonance angle is sensitive to the refractive index of the medium into which the evanescent wave is propagated. The evanescent wave decays exponentially with increasing distance from the interface (Kovacs, 1982) thus for BIAliteTM the maximum distance for detection is 300 nm, i.e. in theory it is suitable for most virus particles. Biomolecular interactions occurring at the sensor surface cause a change in mass which affects the refractive index providing it is within the range of the evanescent wave, thus allowing SPR to be used to monitor such interactions.",

The calculated equilibrium dissociation constant (K,r,.,5,J ranged from 0.98 to 14 x 10 ~~' M, with a rank order of HC2 > HC61 > HC3W > HClO.

K,,,V,,. is the reciprocal of K ',,, ~c,,~ Rate constants were determined for HC2, HC3W and HC61 Fab fragments (Table 1) . No data were obtained for HC 10 Fab. The k,, values ranged by 2.9-fold from 1.3 to 3.7 x lo5 M ' S ~ ', with a rank order of HC2 > HC3W > HC61. HC2 was also the most active IgG. The k,, values ranged by 1.9-fold from 3.2 to 6.0 x 10 p4 s ' with a rank order of HC61 > HC2 > HC3W, exactly the same as the IgGs. KC,,,,,,,, values ranged by 9-fold from 3.1 to 28 x 10 ' M with a rank order of HC2 > HC61 > HC3W. exactly the same as the IgGs. (Dubs et al., 1992) first used the double antibody sandwich for measuring virus-antibody interactions. This was a valuable innovation for the BIAliteTM system where traditionally small antigens are coated to the sensor chip, and the association/dissociation of larger molecules (e.g. antibodies) is detected. Here we have used IgG to capture a 120 nm diameter influenza A virus particle (Taylor et al., 1987) and monitored the association/dissociation of a 9-15 nm long IgG (Nisonoff et al., 1975) , and a 7 nm long Fab fragment (Porta et al., 1994) . Despite the relatively large size of these virions, the distance from the sensor surface is still within the 300 nm maximum detection distance defined for the BIAliteTM system. Thus this is the first time that whole enveloped virus particles have been used to study ligand binding in conjunction with SPR, although (Lamarre and Talbot, 1995) admit having tried and failed with murine hepatitis virus. In all only a few non-enveloped virions have been used in antibody binding studies and epitope mapping (see Section l), although it would seem that whole virus particles in the flow cell of the BIAliteTM system closely mimics the in vivo situation where antibodies in solution pass over virus particles attached to cell receptors. We found considerable variability in the kinetic data, mainly in the association phase. The coeffi- cient of variation (CV) from a mean of three determinations ranged from 16.1 to 67.0%. However, other published data, where given, show a similar CV, e.g. 8.7 to 43.1% for antibody fragments binding to anti-idiotype antibody (Lamarre and Talbot, 1995) , 2.0 to 97.0% for recombinant human antibodies to self antigens (Griffiths et al., 1993) , 6.0 to 13.0% for ICAM-binding to human rhinovirus serotype 3 (Casasnovas and Springer, 1995), and 0.5 to 11.4% for recombinant Fabs to HIV-l gp120 (Ditzel et al., 1995) . It may be that the high CV found here was due to the complex nature of the system under examination, i.e. virus particles possessing a potential 3000 binding sites for antibody on 1000 densely packed HA spikes (Taylor et al., 1987) . In contrast protein or peptide capture antigens will be uniformly distributed on the sensor surface, and usually have only one epitope per molecule for the applied ligand.",

These recent studies show relatively small differences in functional affinity between IgG and Fabs, although only Cavacini et al. (1994) used native protein. This is in contrast to anti-dinitrophenol (DNP) IgG, purified from serum which neutralized bacteriophage conjugated with DNP, as its Fabs had up to lOOO-fold less functional affinity than the IgG for the DNPphage complex (Hornick and Karush, 1972; Blank et al., 1972) . Differences in rate constants and equilibrium constants between the IgGs and their Fabs have been ascribed to the bivalent interac- tion of igG versus the monovalent binding of Fab (Cavacini et al., 1994; Lamarre and Talbot, 1995) . However for mAbs of very high affinity, bivdlent binding may have an insignificant effect on functional affinity, and Parham (1983) suggested that a loss of bivalency became significant only at a Ku,FsoL., of < lOa M -'. This may account for the large differences in affinity between IgG and Fab seen by Hornick and Karush (1972) and Blank et al. (1972) as the association constants for the IgGs examined were around 10' M ' On the other hand the BIAliteTM system may favour monovalent binding by preventing its conversion to bivalent binding. Dissociation of antibody would then probably result in its removal from the flow cell, if it was unable to bind to another immobilised virus on the sensor surface. Alternatively a small proportion of the IgG molecules may be binding biva-lently while most are binding monovalently. The slight differences observed between IgG and Fab would then be due to the slower dissociation of bivalently bound IgG in a background of faster dissociating monovalently bound IgG. Using the BIAliteTM system Malmborg et al. (1992) saw a slightly biphasic dissociation curve for IgG, but not for Fab, which they attributed to bivalent interaction with the antigen (tetanus toxoid) on the sensor chip. However, dissociation of the antigen was monophasic in both cases when Fab or IgG was coated to the sensor chip. It has been suggested (Malmborg et al., 1992 ) that a mixture of bi-and monovalently bound IgG would give a biphasic dissociation curve. In the system described here the rate of dissociation of all the mAbs was slow, and it was not possible to assess if the dissociation curves were mono-or biphasic. Under conditions which were adequate for the other IgGs and Fabs, no data could be obtained for HC58 IgG and its Fab, or HClO Fab. This was unexpected as the K,,,,,., of HC58 by affinity ELISA was comparable with the best of the others, and 28-fold higher than HClO which could be assayed by SPR (Schofield and Dimmock, 1996) . However, our model for the binding of HC58 IgG/Fab proposes that antibody molecules are orientated at around 90\" to the HA, so that the bulk of the IgG lies between HA globular heads and parallel with the surface of the virion, whereas other IgGs bind at about 180\" to the extremity of the HA (Schofield and Dimmock, unpublished data) . The necessity to interdigitate at right angles with the HA might make it difficult for the IgG to access its epitope in a flow cell, and might account for the failure of HC58 IgG or its Fab to bind to virions. HClO had the highest K,,,v ,,,, L', (lowest affinity) of the mAbs studied here and it seems likely that its Fab would have an even lower affinity as did all the other mAbs. This may have taken the affinity below the threshold for detection in the SPR system. Coincidentally, the K,,s,,,,, of mAb HClO (7.1 x lo8 M-') is close to the value which Parham (1983) suggested would be associated with a major reduction in affinity on conversion of the bivalent IgG to the monovalent Fab.",
