Comprehensive molecular testing of single lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens achieved pathogen detection in 87% of CAP patients compared with 39% with culture-based methods.

Viruses were present in 30% of cases; 82% of these were codetections with bacteria. Most (85%) patients had received antimicrobials in the 72 hours before admission. Of these, 78% had a bacterial pathogen detected by PCR but only 32% were culture-positive (P < .0001). Molecular testing had the potential to enable de-escalation in number and/or spectrum of antimicrobials in 77% of patients.",

Due to the range of pathogens responsible for CAP, in moderate or severe infection, broad-spectrum antimicrobial cover should be initiated before de-escalating to narrowspectrum pathogen-directed agents once a microbiological diagnosis has been made [1, 5] . Unfortunately, de-escalation is uncommon in practice because current diagnostic methods may identify a pathogen in only 30%-40% of patients with CAP [4, 6, 7] . Recent studies have highlighted the need for more timely and sensitive microbiological diagnostic methods in CAP, particularly for bacteria and in the common scenario of antibiotic administration prior to sampling [4, 8, 9] .",

However, a similar approach has not yet been adopted for typical bacterial pathogens. It is difficult to interpret PCR results for typical respiratory bacteria in nonsterile samples such as sputum due to the potential for contamination with the same organisms from oropharyngeal flora. However, accurate molecular quantification of bacterial loads may aid in distinguishing infection from contamination in a way that is analogous to the use of quantitative cultures.",

Exclusion criteria included the following: bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, or healthcareassociated pneumonia (hospitalized in an acute care hospital for 2 or more days within 90 days of the infection or resided in a nursing home or long-term care facility) [34] . Radiology reports were reviewed for all patients, and only patients with radiological changes consistent with pneumonia were included. Where there was any uncertainty, the images were reviewed by an experienced respiratory physician (A. T. H.). Clinical data including comorbidities, outcomes, and antibiotic prescriptions were collected retrospectively from patient hospital records using a standard pro forma as part of a clinical audit of pneumonia management (approved by the Quality Improvement Team, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh). Drug administration prior to hospitalization, including antibiotic prescription, was obtained from the electronic primary care prescription records on admission and later verified by a pharmacist.",

Isolates were identified using standard biochemical methods and/or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (Bruker, Coventry, United Kingdom). Specimens with any named bacterial species identified by culture were considered to be culture positive. Following routine culture, LRT specimens were centrifuged, and mucopurulent material was stored at \u221280\u00b0C for up to 15 months. As part of the study protocol, specimens and associated clinical data were collected and anonymized before molecular testing in accordance with local ethical approval (South East Scotland Scottish Academic Health Sciences Collaboration Human Annotated BioResource reference no. 10/S1402/33). Thawed specimens were homogenized by vortexing with sterile glass beads, and a 200-\u03bcL aliquot was treated with lysozyme at 37\u00b0C followed by proteinase K at 56\u00b0C for 1 hour each. Total nucleic acid was then extracted using the automated nucliSENS easyMAG (BioM\u00e9rieux, Basingstoke, United Kingdom) instrument with an off-board lysis protocol, including the addition of phocine herpes virus as an internal extraction control. Extracts were stored at 4\u00b0C for up to 5 days or longer at \u221280\u00b0C. Fast multiplex real-time PCR was performed using a combination of multiplex assays developed or adapted in-house for the following [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] 33] . As previously described [33] , bacterial loads for S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii were expressed as colony forming units (CFUs) per milliliter of purulent material and calculated from standard curves generated by target gene plasmid dilution series on each PCR run. Quality control reactions (quantitative real-time PCR for GAPDH human gene and qualitative real-time PCR for gB phocine herpes virus internal control [IC]) were carried out on all specimens [33] . Quantitative GAPDH PCR was used as an indication of the cell content of each specimen because the GAPDH gene is present in human DNA. Negative (no template) controls were included on every extraction and PCR run to check purity of reagents. Runs were accepted if the negative controls were negative and the standard curves were linear; runs that failed quality control were repeated. Qualitative results were accepted if the internal control was positive or if at least 1 other target was positive. Quantitative results were accepted if the internal control quantification cycle (Cq) value fell within the range \u00b11 log Cq difference to negative extraction controls. Outside of this range, quantitative results were not accepted due to the potential for partial PCR inhibition leading to inaccuracy of measurement.",

Testing can be carried out within 1 working day to enable reporting of results in a clinically relevant time-frame, requires only a single LRT specimen, and is not negatively impacted by antibiotic administration prior to sampling. Only limited quantitative molecular bacterial testing has been carried out in a well-defined CAP setting [21, 25, 28, 29, 31] . As our study focused on testing sputum by molecular methods, our high level of pathogen detection for typical bacteria may not be directly comparable to results from other recent studies in hospitalized adult CAP. By combining several methodologies such as serology, culture, antigen detection, and PCR on multiple sample types, etiology was determined in 38%-76% of cases [4, 7, 21, 31, [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] . Atypical bacteria were uncommon in our cohort (<5% patients), but it was not an epidemic period for M. pneumoniae [42] . Viruses were detected in approximately one third of patients, which is in agreement with the 13%-56% range reported in previous studies; influenza was also detected at comparable levels (<10%) [4, 7, 21, 31, 36, 38, 39, 43 ]. Although we were not able to test controls, viral detections by PCR from the upper respiratory tract have been found to be rare in asymptomatic adults compared with those with CAP in a recent study [43] .",

Sputum is a pragmatic, although imperfect, choice of specimen type for the microbiological investigation of CAP. Microscopy for sputum quality is not routinely carried out locally; however, only mucopurulent material was tested, and the cellular content was quantified by human GAPDH gene PCR to rule out salivary specimens. However, sputum that is expectorated from the lower airways will always be at risk of oropharyngeal flora contamination. Despite the limitations, national CAP guidelines [1, 5] recommend sputum investigation for patients admitted to the hospital with moderate to severe CAP, both to aid microbiological diagnosis in order to guide therapy as well as for surveillance. Alternative lower respiratory specimen types such as bronchoalveolar lavage fluids may be expected to be less at risk of contamination, but these require a semi-invasive procedure that is certainly not routine in nonintubated patients.",

Quantification of bacterial DNA load may be important in distinguishing infection from oropharyngeal contamination in sputum. Most molecular work done to date has focused on S. pneumoniae, and a cutoff of 10 4 -10 5 gene copies/mL is typically described as a significance threshold [20, 21, 29, 44] . A cutoff of 10 5 CFU/mL is also generally agreed upon for sputum culture as determined through years of experience. Based on these data, we applied a significance threshold of \u226510 5 CFU/ mL for all bacterial loads, and this did not significantly decrease overall pathogen detection. However, it remains unclear whether a single molecular cutoff is relevant for all bacterial species and whether cutoffs for sputum culture are relevant to sputum PCR. Quantitative molecular tools for many bacterial species are new [32, 33] , and there is a clear need for further exploration of their role. Determination of thresholds for significant and nonsignificant detection are key targets for future work.",

With the quantitative molecular tools now available for the relevant bacteria, these issues can also be further investigated.",

            "text": "A recent review has noted that interventions to reduce excessive and increase effective antibiotic prescribing in hospitalized patients can have a positive impact on antimicrobial resistance, hospitalacquired infections, and clinical outcomes [45] . However, studies in the pneumonia setting have been small and either focused on atypical bacteria and viruses [46] or nonquantitative molecular detection of bacteria [30] , demonstrating 11% and 67% antibiotic modification, respectively. The results of comprehensive molecular testing in our study were not available to the treating physicians due to the anonymized study protocol. However, we estimated that de-escalation and/or reduction in the number of agents might have occurred in three quarters of our CAP patients. This was based on significantly improved bacterial detection capability, high rates of broad-spectrum empirical antibiotic usage in our cohort, and knowledge of local antimicrobial resistance patterns.",

However, the lack of positive microbiological identification is a significant issue, and it is highly likely that enhancing the detection of pathogens and reporting of bacterial loads would have a major impact on the clinical decision-making process. Therefore, our study illustrates the feasibility of providing the physician with significantly more information on which to base treatment decisions than is currently available and suggests that comprehensive PCR testing including bacterial load quantitation should be one of the inputs to future prospective studies in this area.",
