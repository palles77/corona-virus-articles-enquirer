Methods: A structured questionnaire was adapted from a World Health Organization survey. Data were collected from Results: ICNs showed the following scores (mean \u00a7 SD): knowledge (19.5 \u00a7 2.3), perception (69.9 \u00a7 8.9), attitude (46.9 \u00a7 5.8), and role model (39.2 \u00a7 6.0). HH performance of health care workers (HCWs) was 75.2 \u00a7 15.5. Mean HH performance scores of HCWs (P = .007) differed significantly according to infection control experience (3 groups: \u2264 12 months, 13-24 months, > 24 months). Perception, attitude, and role model scores showed positive correlations with each other (P < .01). The regression model for HH performance of HCWs was calculated as follows: Y 1 = 31.638 + 0.067X 1 (perception of ICNs) + 0.133X 2 (attitude of ICNs) + 0.825X 3 (role model of ICNs) (P < .001; adjusted R 2 = 0.115). Discussion: Perception, attitude, and role model scores of ICNs were significant predictors of HH performance of HCWs.",

[1] [2] [3] [4] The primary transmission of pathogens between patients in HAIs takes place via the hands of health care workers (HCWs). 5 Thus, hand hygiene (HH) is the single most important factor for preventing HAIs. 1, 3, 4 Proper HH among HCWs is one of the foremost techniques for reducing HAIs. 1, 2 However, HH performance among HCWs was reported to be as low as about 38%. 1, 6 Therefore, infection control activities focus primarily on enhancing the HH performance of HCWs; various kinds of infection control activities for HH, such as education, monitoring, and feedback, and a convenient supply of HH products, have been recommended and implemented. 1, 3, 5 The recommended ratio of infection control nurses (ICNs) was 0.8-1.0 ICN per 100 beds in 2002 7 to 1.2 ICN per 100 beds in 2014 8 in an acute care hospital, because ICNs are key persons to successfully decrease HAIs by managing and developing infection control activities. 7, 8 During the Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak in the Republic of Korea from May 20, 2015, to July 28, 2015, the importance of infection control in hospitals was highlighted. 9, 10 Since 2016, the Korea Institute for Healthcare Accreditation has included the ratio of ICNs to beds as an essential accreditation standard of medical care. 11 Today, numerous new ICNs (whose primary responsibility is infection control) are abruptly assigned infection control activities in many hospitals. The number of ICNs is increasing rapidly because of the recent amendment to the medical law in 2017 that strongly recommended a ratio of 1 ICN per 150 beds in general hospitals. 12 Therefore, as the number of nurses newly assigned to ICN positions surpasses the capabilities of existing education programs for ICNs in Korea, it is necessary to develop a professional HH education and training program. The knowledge and perception of ICNs regarding HH can also affect the HH performance of other HCWs because ICNs are responsible for HH performance improvement activities such as HH education, campaigns, monitoring, and feedback. 1, 3, 4, 7 Therefore, ICNs should first acquire knowledge and receive professional education and training in HH.",
