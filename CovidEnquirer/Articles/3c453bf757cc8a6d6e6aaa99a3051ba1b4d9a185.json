There are well-documented cases of airborne transmission of tuberculosis during air travel, 1 the airborne spread of measles through the heating, ventilating and air conditioning system in a medical office, 2 and the longrange airborne spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus during the Amoy Gardens outbreak in Hong Kong. 3 The potential for any of these organisms, probably including a human variant of avian flu, to be spread by dental aerosols/ splatter arising from the mouth of an infected person to dental personnel and other patients was discussed in a JADA 2004 article written by me and Dr. John Molinari. 4 While vaccines are a longterm answer to many public health threats, they usually are available only after the threat has been isolated. Until an effective vaccine exists, the use of simple and inexpensive infection-control procedures for the control of dental aerosols/ splatter is dentistry's only defense against potentially being implicated as a source of infection in the rapidly expanding area of emerging and reemerging infections. Unfortunately, this facet of dental infection control often is ignored.",

Even with these challenges, U.S. academic dental institutions remain the fountainhead of a competent work force to meet the oral health care needs of the public. In 2005, the American Dental Education Association (ADEA) formed the Commission on Change and Innovation in Dental Education (ADEA-CCI) as its primary mechanism to lead and coordinate the Association's efforts to assist in the development of curricula for the 21st century. ADEA-CCI was formed based on the premise that no meaningful curricular change can occur unless it is systemic and includes the various external agencies and stakeholders that influence curricula.",
