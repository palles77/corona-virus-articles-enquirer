Hall and later Brenner and Horne used phosphotungstic acid for contrasting plant viruses. 8, 12 This technique was extended in 1959 to coliphage T2. 9 Viruses and their components stood out as white on a dark background with unprecedented clarity. Negative staining by phosphotungstates rapidly superseeded shadowing for virus visualization. Uranyl salts and ammonium molybdate were introduced later. The standards of viral electron microscopy were set in the 1970s. 11, 20, 21 Today, negative staining is done almost exclusively with uranyl acetate (UA) and phosphotungstate (PT) salts (Figs. 1 and 2) and has been applied to thousands of viruses. At present, at least 6,300 bacterial and archaeal viruses have been examined in the electron microscope after negative staining. 6 Transmission electron microsocpes (TEMs) fall into three categories. (1) Conventional or \"manual,\" also called \"analogue\" microscopes using mechanical devices for stage drive and aperture alignment and analog potentiometers or variable resistors for electronic controls. Images are recorded on photographic film or plates. (2) \"Digital\" microscopes using far fewer controls due to a computer-based system with digital potentiometers, electronic stage drives, and a digital alignment via a centralized computer interface. Objects are generally visualized on a monitor screen and images are acquired via a \"chargedcouple device\" or CCD sensor, replacing film or plates as the recording media.",

These instruments were marketed almost simultanously by three major competing companies that did so with meager or no instructions relating to contrast and image quality. An additional modification by microscope manufacturers was to change the focal length of the objective pole piece (zeta or Z angle) to increase fidelity at the cost of reduced contrast. All these factors could explain a wave of poor electron microscopical images 1 which, seemingly, has not abated. Unfortunately, this wave coincided with the death of several famous and highly skilled electron microscopists, such as E. Kellenberger in Switzerland, D.E.",

The adjectives \"poor and good\" are somewhat subjective and we apologize for this. The micrographs had been obtained with a wide selection of about 50 types or models of electron microscopes, most of which were \"digital.\" The vast majority of articles presented several pictures. \"Manual\" microscopes were apparently disappearing fast.

The most frequent types of transmission electron microscopes (TEMs) used in phage research are produced by JEOL (Japanese Electron Optical Laboratories), Hitachi and FEI, a successor of Philips (Eindhoven, The Netherlands), followed distantly by Carl Zeiss, Germany. One also finds a few old AEM (England) and Tesla (Czechia) instruments. The prevalence of JEOL and Hitachi instruments may be attributed to their relatively low cost. The most popular types are the JEOL 1200 EX, the Hitachi H-1700, and three instruments of the Philips family (FEI CM 100, Technai Spirit or Morgagni). A few \"manual\" microscopes, for example the Philips EM 300, persist and seem to be, because of their high quality, the objects of a cult among inconditionals of electron microscopy. FEI-Tecnai electron microscopes appear to be the most highly evolved TEMs and have indeed produced excellent micrographs, whereas, for example, the JEOL 1200 is often associated with poor pictures. This impression is superficial. Indeed, good and poor pictures have been produced with JEOL, Hitachi and Philips-FEI instruments. In conclusion, electron microscopes are above all \"operator-sensitive.\" Poor pictures must generally be attributed to poor maintenance and untrained users. There is no cure but know-how.",

Crude lysates contain huge amounts of impurities, notably proteins (Figs. S4 and S19). This results in contrastless, flat images and the presence of bacterial debris and even complete bacteria. The debris may mimic certain types of bacteriophages ( Table 2) . Images of nonpurified specimens should not be accepted for publication. Purification can be achieved by centrifugation in sucrose or CsCl density gradients; unfortunately, this technique is limited to a small number of specialized laboratories. Instead, we recommend to sediment phages in Eppendorf tubes followed by two washes in buffer or even tap water. Using fixed-angle rotors, phages can be sedimented in as little as 1 h at 25,000 g. It is not necessary to stain phages for long minutes or to fix them. Staining is almost instantaneous and fixation is merely a complication. While purification is mandatory for any real investigation, crude lysates can be examined for quick checks of phage presence and identity. It is also possible to examine phages extracted from a lysed agar surface. 23 For this, a drop of staining solution is deposited on the agar and the Petri dish is agitated gently. The drop is then touched with a grid and excess liquid is drawn off.",

Much has been said in manuals of electron microscopy (e.g., in ref. 7) about focusing and astigmatism and this does not need to be repeated. Digital microscopes allow the investigator to use the FFT (Fast fourier transform) function as a measure of astigmatism (Fig. 3) . This function is available in FEI, Hitachi, and JEOL instruments and, for example, the widespread AMT, Gatan, and OlympusSis cameras.

Finally, contrast can be improved in the darkroom by means of fast developers, polycontrast papers and optical filters. Unfortunately, this is very difficult with \"digital\" electron microscopes where contrast must be adjusted before or after image acquisition. CCD digital technology offers a wide range of gray scale values. They can be selected to favor the mid-tonal range, thus reducing the extreme dark and white values. For example, a 12-bit image comprises 4,096 levels from black to white. If the software is set to adjust the predominant intensity to a middle tonality, all values will be adjusted accordingly. The mid-tones typically yield lowcontrast images. Contrast levels should therefore be set to exclude a given percentage of black and white outliers. After image acquisition, the histogram camera software allows for adjustments of gamma (a function of luminance), contrast, and brightness. 19 The observer is left to find his or her best combination by trial and error. Contrast may also be improved by third-party software (e.g., Adobe Photoshop or Image J; http// rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). This seems often to be misunderstood or ignored.

In positive staining (Figs. S9 and S13), virus particles themselves are stained and then may appear black on a white background. This is due to the strong affinity of uranyl ions to dsDNA 13 and seen in any viruses with compact masses of DNA, e.g., phage heads and adeno-or herpes-viruses. It never occurs in filamentous or ssRNA phages. Positively stained phage heads are invariably shrunken by about 10-15% 5, 16 and show neither capsomers nor transverse edges. Phage tails are not stained and appear as shadows. Consequently, these viruses can rarely be identified by EM. Their dimensions are perfectly useless and should not be published. If positive staining is generally an undesirable artifact, it has however two important applications. It allows (A) the visualization of phage heads in sectioned bacteria and (B) facilitates the quantification of aquatic viruses. 4 The reasons for positive staining are unknown.

In one recent case, four washes were needed to obtain a clean preparation. CsCl, used for phage purification, may persist after incomplete dialysis. CsCl forms flat crystals, but does not interfere with staining. Arborescent or flat NaCl crystals are frequent in lysates from halophilic bacteria which require NaCl for growth, e.g., Vibrio and Halobacterium. Again, bacteriophages may act as nuclei of crystallization (Fig. S18) . NaCl crystals may obscure phage particles, but do not alter the quality of staining. In lysates from bacteria prepared with meatbased media, e.g., of clostridia, one may observe occasional fibers of striated muscle and bundles of double-walled rings which resemble phage tails (Fig. S41) and may be be attributed to self-assembly under the action of phospholipase C. 3 From bacteria (Table 2 ). Bacteria contribute proteins, DNA, ribosomes, cytoplasm, capsular material, pili, flagella, and fragments of plasma membrane and cell wall. Proteins and cytoplasm may interfere with the staining process, but are not a source of error. However, this is the case with the other cellular constituents that one may find in a lysate. Their presence depends very much on the phage host. For example, slime and capsular material are present in huge amounts in lysates of Acinetobacter and Xanthomonas and cell wall debris abound in those of Pseudomonas.",

This error is easily explained. Upon bacteriophage lysis, bacteria fall into pieces, many of which are round and have indeed the size of plasmaviruses or cystoviruses (70-80 nm). The latter are characterized by an envelope surrounding an isometric capsid. When superposed over each other, some cellular elements exhibit what seems to be external and internal (Fig. S25) . Cell wall fragments carrying an adsorbed phage tail may be taken at low magnification for tailed phages (Fig. S26) . These membrane fragments are much more than an inconsequential nuisance because phage counts in seawater and freshwater are increasingly often based on fluorescent microscopy. 19 As it happens, bacterial DNA can associate with membrane fragments during lysis 18 and will stain with fluorescent dies. The fluorescent membrane fragments are approximately of the size of phage heads and appear as tiny green dots simulating phages. So far, investigations of phage prevalence in the environment seem to have neglected this potentially serious source of errors. 18 From Bacteriophages (Tables 2 and 3) Bacterial viruses produce a wide variety of abnormal particles ( Table 3) . Nearly all of them have been observed in tailed phages, although the filamentous inoviruses sometimes give rise to doublelength particles. Tailed phages are classified into three families according to tail structure: Myoviridae with contractile tails, Siphoviridae with long, noncontractile tails and Podoviridae with short tails. Nature and frequency of \"freaks\" or \"monsters\" vary with the complexity of phages. Some aberrations have a genetic basis, others reflect errors of assembly, and still others result from propagating phages and their hosts on the wrong substrate, e.g., a medium containing amino acid analogs. 10 The subject has been reviewed elsewhere in some detail. 2 Phage T4 and its relatives have a particular propensity to produce aberrant particles.

The latter indicates the presence of a malformation. The matter requires prolonged observation at magnifications above 150,000\u00be.",

            "text": "Exact magnification depends first on the adjustments made on installing an electron microscope. It must be controlled later by means of test specimens (e.g., beef liver catalase crystals 13 or T4 phage tails) because magnification may change over time and at every repair. Latex crystals and diffraction grating replicas are for low magnification only and to be rejected. In \"manual\" TEMs, magnification is easily and rapidly adjusted in the darkroom by means of a photographical enlarger. In \"digital\" TEMs, magnification can be controlled, if necessary, by calculation of correction factors. This potentially tedious procedure seems to be very unpopular with today's phage electron microscopists. Indeed, magnification control is seldom mentioned in recent phage descriptions and one suspects that it is rarely done. As a result, particle dimensions from \"digital\" TEMs sometimes appear as products of fantasy.",

            "text": "Lastly, electron microscopy depends heavily on the quality of observations and interpretations. 19 For example, a common error is to call every phage head with a hexagonal outline an icosahedron although, geometrically speaking, it could also be an octahedron or a dodecahedron ( Table 2 ). The past five years have generated scores of strange publications. Some investigators of soil phages saw novel viruses in every round or oval particle or isolated tail sheath, others interpreted particles with contracted and extended tails of the same Bacillus myovirus as members of different species, and still others confused negative and positive staining or myo-, sipho-and podo-viruses. This denotes a decline in the general knowledge of viruses and of bacteriophages in particular. Misdiagnosis is particularly frequent in the interpretation of natural samples (water, soil and feces) because these may contain almost anything: algal, plant and vertebrate viruses, muscle fibers, abiogenic material, and of course the omnipresent bacterial debris of any kind. Ultimately, the human factor is the root cause of most problems: failure to maintain, repair and align an electron microscope; failure to focus properly and to correct astigmatism; improper or no specimen preparation; failure to recognize artifacts and fake viruses; absence of magnification control; finally failure to consult the now very abundant literature on electron microscopy in general and that on phages in particular. This translates as \"everything that can go wrong, will.\" Fortunately, there are reasons to be optimistic as any man-made problems can be corrected by humans.",
