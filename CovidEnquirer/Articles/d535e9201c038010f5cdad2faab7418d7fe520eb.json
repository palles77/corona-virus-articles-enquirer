Inoculation of processed sputum sample from the patient on viral cell cultures (LLC-MK2 and Vero) produced specific cytopathic effect in a Netherlands virology centre known as Erasmus Medical Center and so the identified virus was initially labelled as Human Coronavirus Erasmus Medical Center. 1 In September 2012, similar virus was recovered from a patient with severe respiratory symptoms who had a history of travel to Saudi Arabia and had been transferred from a hospital in Qatar to a hospital in London and so named as Human Coronavirus England 1. 2 This new disease was also traced to an earlier time period. In April 2012, a cluster of cases of pneumonia occurred in health care workers of an intensive care unit in a hospital in Zarqa, Jordan, of which 2 patients died, both of whom were confirmed to be infected with the novel coronavirus by retrospective analysis of stored sample. 3 ",

The case fatality rate in the outbreak was 65% and it was found that the disease presentation ranged from mild to fulminant in clinical severity. Clinical syndrome was found to be similar to severe adult respiratory syndrome (SARS), with initial presentation as nonspecific fever and non-productive cough, later progressing to pneumonia. Significant number of patients with MERS-CoV infection also had gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting and diarrhoea), a finding similar to that with SARS. In the majority of patients in the study, fever was high, but the pulmonary involvement on chest radiography was variable. The survival rate was higher among patients who were identified by active surveillance during the outbreak than among those patients who were identified clinically. The incubation period of MERS-CoV was estimated to have an incubation period of 14 days, with 5% of cases developing within 1.8 days and 95% within 10.6 days. 6 ",

Our hospital is a 150 bedded secondary care level facility and an outbreak with MERS-CoV among 5 patients occurred in October 2015 where the 1st patient was diagnosed on the 2nd of October 2015. All the 5 patients were confirmed by virological diagnosis and all these patients succumbed to their illness at a government referral centre dedicated to care for patients with MERS-CoV infection. The cause of death was respiratory failure along with renal shutdown. During this outbreak, 2 nursing staff who cared for the above patients in the medical intensive care unit were also infected with MERS-CoV. Of the 2 nursing staff, one was asymptomatic and the other was severely symptomatic who needed ventilator support as she progressed to respiratory failure. Both the nursing staff recovered completely with 3 negative virology tests on their respiratory samples.

A team was formulated to come up with the analysis, results, and effectiveness of planned solutions to the problem with implementation of the following preventive measures. Scheduled monthly meeting of project team members was conducted and was continuously reviewed. Review and update of MERS-CoV policy and procedure along with structural compliance was adhered to. Intensive onsite education to all HCWs of the hospital and subsequent competency test results were tabulated and reported to the MOH preventive medicine department.

Any epidemiological history of contact with a confirmed or suspected MERS-CoV infected patient, camels or its products in the previous 14 days were to be considered for MERS-CoV screening. The virus gets suspended in the air for at least 36 h and commonly spreads by air borne route especially when aerosol generating procedures are conducted 6 . Hence, individuals identified with the above signs, symptoms and epidemiological link are promptly transferred to air borne infection isolation rooms (AIIRs) for further evaluation by the physicians. New respiratory illness room with portable High efficiency particulate arrestors (HEPA) was created to isolate suspected MERS-CoV infected patients within the Emergency Medical Services. The physicians were provided with hands on training on proper collection of nasopharyngeal samples to prevent occurrence of false negative virology results. HCWs prior to entering the patient room were strictly supervised for donning the personal protective equipments (PPE) in sequence after adequate hand hygiene. Sequences of wearing the PPE are as follows; clean gown, N95 Mask, Face shield and gloves. Removal of the PPE after completion of patient care was also done in a sequence in the reverse order and special emphasis was laid on performing hand hygiene between each PPE removal. The hospital management of information system installed video programs on all infection prevention practices including the case definitions for MERS-CoV on the hospital portal and all televisions displayed at all patient care locations. Social workers and patient educators were trained and encouraged to provide education to all visitors, patients and their families on MERS-CoV infection and prevention methods.",

The housekeeping staff had been provided with adequate training on the process of terminal cleaning and subsequent use of the fumigation system. Portable radiological machines such as ultrasound, Carm machines have been used for all clinically suspected MERS-CoV patients. The hospital construction services created additional AIIRs which totaled to 22.

Surveillance studies of viruses in animal species, including bats, rodents, and livestock, will help us to understand the potential human pathogens that exist in the environment before they can spill over human population. There are no antiviral medications available to treat MERS-CoV infections and the patient management is purely symptomatic.

So the Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses decided to call the new coronavirus as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). This name was accepted by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Ministry of Health (MOH) of Saudi Arabia. 4 From the identification of 1st MERS-CoV patient, until January 17, 2017, 1879 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection with 666 (35.4%) deaths have been reported.5",
