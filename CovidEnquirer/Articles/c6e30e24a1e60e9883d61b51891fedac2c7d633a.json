Striking examples include severe respiratory pathogens (e.g. the SARS or MERS coronavirus) [1] and haemorrhagic fever viruses (e.g. Ebola virus) [2] . Many countries have already implemented disease control measures that include the establishment of specialized facilities such as negative-air-pressure isolation rooms for the containment of patients, and reference diagnostic laboratories in which potentially infectious samples can be safely analysed to provide diagnosis and virus characterization. Additionally, protocols have been established for the transportation, reception and management of patients, and the corresponding shipment of biological samples to specialized reference laboratories.",

Accordingly, as viral infections produce a wide range of clinical presentations [3] [4] [5] , detection should not be performed only in cases that meet the criteria for severe infection (e.g. haemorrhagic fever), but should rather be extended to febrile syndromes occurring in patients returning from an epidemic area. This has practical implications in terms of the capacity to provide a clinical diagnosis rapidly, for a potentially significant number of patients, and this issue is discussed further below.",

Thus, the management of cases possibly infected with an HiPaV should not reduce the efficiency of identifying these patients with specific treatable infections [6] . However, in the vast majority of cases, the medical team cannot gain access to classic biological investigations until the reference laboratory has excluded HiPaV infection. Therefore, the patient may spend a significant period of time without access to basic biological investigations that should guide aetiological treatment or intensive-care management. In some cases, this may represent a loss of opportunity to save the lives of patients.",

This implies that hospital laboratories should whenever possible, perform the first-line tests for detection of HiPaV infections. This is possible in most cases, when the diagnosis relies on real-time PCR or RT-PCR detection of the viral genome in biological samples, because such tests are easy to standardize and highly reproducible (and many already exist in the form of commercial kits) [7] [8] [9] . Moreover, hospital laboratories, most often, already have considerable experience in using them. This, however, raises considerable biosecurity issues. The introduction of dedicated, biologically safe sampling techniques that automatically inactivate the sample at the patient's bedside would be of great value in this context, and their development should be encouraged and actively supported by health authorities. This would greatly increase the speed of the diagnostic process, as patients with a suspicion of HiPaV infection could be safely tested by the use of standard laboratory and sample transportation protocols.",
