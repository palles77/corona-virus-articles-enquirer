[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] One of the major public health concerns in relation to mass gatherings is the importation or exportation of infectious diseases, and spread between attendees and to the local population. [6] [7] [8] [9] The gathering of huge numbers of pilgrims can compromise the health system of the host countries. [10] [11] [12] [13] Additionally, the threat to global health security posed by infectious diseases that might be exported to the pilgrims' home country shows the importance of advance planning, global communication, public health surveillance, and response at religious mass gatherings. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] The Hajj or pilgrimage to Makkah, Saudi Arabia, is one of the largest yearly religious mass gatherings worldwide, with more than 2 million people from more than 184 countries. 1, 2 Hajj is one of the obligatory fi ve pillars of Islam-a duty that all physically healthy, ablebodied adult Muslims must undertake once in their lifetimes if they can aff ord it, 1,2 and is undertaken over 5 days during Dhul Hijjah 8-12, the 12th month of the Islamic calendar (fi gure 1). The proximity between pilgrims due to the crowded accommodation, congregation, and prayers creates an ideal environment for transmission of infectious diseases, many of which are preventable if appropriate measures are taken. In this report, we describe the extensive public health planning and surveillance systems that were used to monitor public health risks, and provision of and access to health services during Hajj 2012 and Hajj 2013, which together attracted more than 5 million pilgrims from 184 countries.",

The busiest period for the Umrah is during Ramadan, the month of fasting, which is about 3 months before the Hajj. Although during the Hajj, pilgrims visit the holy cities Makkah and Medina, Saudi Arabia, the strict defi nition of Hajj only applies to the pilgrimage to Makkah. The lunar calendar is 10 days or 11 days shorter than the Gregorian version used in the west. Thus, the Hajj moves forward by 10 days or 11 days every year according to the Gregorian calendar.",

To minimise the health risks to the pilgrims, the Saudi Ministry of Health liaises with governments of all countries from which pilgrims visit Makkah and Medina throughout the year. The public health measures for Hajj are focused on provision of safe water and food supplies, sanitation, vector control, pre-travel health regulations and advice about vaccinations, health checks, and specifi c immunisation at the port of entry, health education campaigns, and provision of free health care to pilgrims through several clinics and hospitals. A proactive public health programme is initiated before each Hajj, with focus on prevention and surveillance of health hazards, and health-care provision during the pilgrimage. Before each Hajj, the Saudi Ministry of Health disseminates the health requirements for issuance of travel visas, and provides advice about public health guidelines to prevent the spread of respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] This advice is re-enforced with widespread health education and prevention campaigns through reading materials, travel agents, pilgrims' group leaders, and media communication during the Hajj.",

All end-user surveillance stations gather and send data to the Hajj operation team at the Command and Control Centre through the major local area networks that connect all end-user stations with both wired and wireless connections to the centre. These end-user stations are hospitals, clinics, and medical centres in Mina, Arafat, and Muzdalifah. The information technology system gathers data, does the statistical analysis, and displays and transfers the results to the Command and Control Centre. These results are displayed on the video wall and interactive board. A digital pen was used in 2012 to convert the conventional paper-based system into a digital system for provision of demographic and medical data. Thus, the entire demographic and health data for each case can be captured and relayed rapidly. Information technology is also used by the ambulance information system to record data about medical and administrative procedures done by ambulance staff on patients. The data are transferred swiftly to the hospital emergency departments before the arrival of patients.",

The fi rst such recorded outbreak was in 632 AD, when malaria was originally called yethrib fever. 36 A realisation of the adverse implications of the threat of malaria to public health at the Hajj focused the attention of the Saudi Government on enforcing the regional malaria eradication programme. 30 A wide range of viral and bacterial infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract can occur during the Hajj. [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] Bacterial and viral pneumonia are common causes of hospital admission in pilgrims. 39, 40, 43, 44 Factors that contribute to the spread of these pathogens include proximity between pilgrims, shared accommodation, and dust in the environment. Transmission of tuberculosis during Hajj is diffi cult to ascertain because of the long incubation. 41, 47 The risk of tuberculosis during the Hajj is estimated to be about 10% based on data from before and after screening visits for latent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. 48 Most pilgrims come from areas that are highly endemic for tuberculosis 49 and many travel to Makkah with active disease or infection that is reactivated by stress. Pulmonary tuberculosis was a leading cause of hospital admission in patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Strategies to reduce the transmission of tuberculosis during the Hajj and development of an evidence base for appropriate intervention measures remains one of the priorities for the Saudi Ministry of Health.",

However, no major outbreaks have occurred at the Hajj as shown by the results of a cohort study of French pilgrims in 2012. 50 In 2009, fewer than 100 cases of infl uenza A H1N1 were reported during Hajj at the peak of the pandemic, and only 26 confi rmed cases during Umrah. 51 In another study, no infl uenza A H1N1 infection was detected in 559 pilgrims. 52 The results of this study, however, showed rapid infection with respiratory viruses and bacteria, particularly rhinovirus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The Saudi Ministry of Health is assessing vaccines for prevention of pneumococcal infections. 53 The ministry is also in the process of defi ning the exact burden of pneumococcal sepsis (pneumonia, meningitis, or invasive disease) during Hajj. 53 Pneumococcal vaccines (polyvalent), specifi cally for people older than 65 years and those with splenectomy, are available. Additionally, other forms of prevention are widely available and are known to reduce the burden of disease associated with S pneumoniae. Although the eff ectiveness of pneumococcal vaccination for the prevention of S pneumoniae infections in elderly pilgrims is yet to be ascertained, these individuals might benefi t from vaccination with the polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine for the common pneumococcal serotypes that are circulating during Hajj.",

Concerns that mass immunisation with vaccines that do not protect against all serogroups could lead to an increase in the incidence of meningococcal disease caused by N meningitidis strains that are not included in the vaccine have not been substantiated. The Saudi surveillance data for invasive meningococcal disease showed a reduction in the number of Hajj-related cases and non-Hajj-related cases after the introduction of the ACYW vaccine in 2002. 63 Continued surveillance with yearly analysis of data is necessary to bring about the adaptation of public health measures and avoid future epidemics of invasive meningococcal disease during the Hajj in subsequent years. Data from Hajj 2011 and Hajj 2012 are very encouraging and no further cases have been reported of invasive meningococcal disease.",

Because pilgrims on arrival might be incubating the infectious cause of diarrhoea, the focus of public health surveillance is on proactive surveillance, early diagnosis, treatment, and contact tracing and quarantine.",

As the events in relation to the recent MERS-CoV outbreak show, the Hajj will continue to pose substantial public health challenges for health authorities in Saudi Arabia, the countries from where pilgrims travel, and worldwide. The introduction and spread of infectious diseases during and after the Hajj or any mass gathering event will remain important topics on the public health agendas for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, the Hajj off ers a great opportunity for creating a health legacy that will enable improvements in health systems and services for mass gatherings. It presents major opportunities to do high-quality cross-sectional, case-control, and longitudinal cohort studies to generate an evidence base for the development of optimum recommendations for prevention, management, and control of infectious diseases and for sustaining global health security for Hajj 71 and other mass gatherings. The Saudi Ministry of Health established the Global Center for Mass Gathering Medicine in 2012 with the headquarters in Riyadh. This centre is a virtual research network of UK academic and public health institutions in partnership with the WHO Collaborating Centre on Mass Gatherings Medicine and WHO Global Capacity Alert and Response. This unique network will undertake longitudinal and cross-sectional cohort studies, review and publish reports, and has brought together a coalition of interested partners to gather and translate an appropriate evidence base into public health policy for use by countries that host mass gatherings. So far, the Global Center for Mass Gathering Medicine has established an overarching board chaired by the Saudi Minister of Health with membership of experts from the University College London, Public Health England, WHO, Saudi Council for Health Specialties, and the Saudi national research funding agency King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology. The Global Center for Mass Gathering Medicine has held two scientifi c advisory committee meetings and an international conference. The centre has already embarked on achieving its mandates by undertaking research into the MERS-CoV outbreak, tuberculosis, and HIV in Saudi Arabia. [33] [34] [35] [72] [73] [74] [75] The centre's fi rst group of ten Saudi physicians has embarked on a diploma programme for mass gatherings medicine approved by the Saudi Council for Health Specialties. The current focus of research is on MERS-CoV and other respiratory viral infections and best strategies to prevent them. Through provision of a scientifi c evidence base the Global Center for Mass Gathering Medicine aims to drive the best health promotion, prevention guidelines and practice, and health education for attendees at the Hajj and other mass gatherings.",

Increased surveillance during Hajj 2012 and Hajj 2013 was achieved with a MERS-CoV response team monitoring and gathering data at all clinics and hospitals in Arafat, Makkah, Mina, Muzdalifah, and Medina.During Hajj 2012 and Hajj 2013, no cases of MERS-CoV infection were detected. Also, no cases were reported after pilgrims returned home. In a cohort study of 154 French pilgrims from whom nasal swabs were obtained before they returned to France, 83% had respiratory symptoms, but none tested positive for MERS-CoV infection. 50 58% of the French pilgrims in 2012 and 29% in 2013 had comorbidities that increased their risk of MERS-CoV infection.50 By the end of 2013, no cases of MERS-CoV infection were reported in 5 million pilgrims who undertook the Umrah.",
