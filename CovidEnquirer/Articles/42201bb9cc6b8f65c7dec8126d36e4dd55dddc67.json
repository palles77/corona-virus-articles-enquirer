Not only do yearly endemic outbreaks lead to significant local morbidity and mortality, but less frequent pandemicsd4 in the 20th century alonedcause death tolls in the millions. The ''Spanish flu'' of 1918 to 1919 resulted in 20 to 40 million deaths worldwide. 1 In the late 1990s, after several decades of fairly stable human influenza viruses, highly pathogenic avian influenza infected humans in Southeast Asia for the first time. In the setting of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic and emerging human infections with these highly pathogenic avian influenza strains, the prospect of a pandemic looms large for public health authorities and should prompt preparative measures from emergency care providers.",

            "text": "The ability of influenza to cause repeated outbreaks lies in its viral structure and ease of genetic reassortment. Influenza viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family and contain singlestranded RNA. These enveloped viruses can be classified into A, B, and C types on the basis of their internal nucleoprotein and matrix protein identity. Only influenza A and B are associated with major outbreaks. 2 Influenza A is more diverse, associated with more outbreaks, and includes all avian influenza strains. Influenza A contains 8 distinct genes. Two surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, account for its infectivity as well as trigger the host immune response. Hemagglutinin binds sialic acid receptors on the host cell membrane to gain access to the cell; this is the main target of antibodies and vaccines. Neuraminidase facilitates release of progeny virions from host cells after replication and is the target of antiviral therapies. These proteins are also used to identify different strains; to date, 15 hemagglutinin (H1-15) and 9 neuraminidases (N1-9) have been identified. Only 3 hemagglutinin (H1-3) and 2 neuraminidase (N1, N2) subtypes of influenza A persist in humans. Certain hemagglutinin and neuraminidases subtypes are associated with pigs (H1, H3, N1, N2) and horses (H7, N7, N8). All hemagglutinin and neuraminidase subtypes are established in aquatic birds. 2, 3 The epidemiology of influenza is closely linked with the genetics of these 2 proteins. Local epidemics, like the severe ''flu season'' of 2003 to 2004 in the United States, are caused by antigenic drift. This means that random point mutations in the genetic sequence escape repair, leading to gradual ''drift'' of the gene pool. The genes coding for hemagglutinin and neuraminidase are inherently unstable and constantly undergoing genetic drift. People are more susceptible to these slightly altered strains but also retain some degree of crossimmunity from prior influenza exposures. Thus, resultant epidemics are limited in scope and severity.",

            "text": "Aquatic birds serve as the primary reservoir for influenza A, carrying the viruses largely without adverse effects. 4,6 Domestic poultry, however, are highly susceptible to avian influenza. Depending on the virulence of the particular strain, poultry may manifest mild upper respiratory infections or rapidly fatal illness. 4 Formerly known as ''fowl plague,'' highly pathogenic avian influenza is now identified as strains H5 and H7, which cause severe disease in terrestrial birds. 6, 7 Since the Hong Kong pandemic of 1968, the human strains of influenza A had remained fairly stable. 5 However, in the late 1990s, new avian strains began to infect humans in relatively small numbers. Eighteen people were infected with influenza A (H5N1) in Hong Kong in 1997; 6 died. 4, 8 In 1999, H9N2 was isolated for the first time from 2 children in Hong Kong, who both recovered after mild respiratory illnesses. 4, 8 Most concerning, however, is this year's re-emergence of influenza A (H5N1)dslightly different genetically than the 1997 strain. [9] [10] [11] Affecting poultry across Southeast Asia, this is the most widespread outbreak of avian influenza in history. More than 100 million poultry have died or been killed as a result. 12 As of September 28, 2004, in Thailand and Vietnam, 42 cases were reported in healthy young adults and children, with a 71% mortality rate. 13 The H5N1 strain of influenza transmitted to humans this year has 2 of the 3 classic features of a potential pandemic: high mortality and an immunologically naive population. 14 Lacking, up to this point, is efficient human-to-human transmission. 5 Of note, some evidence shows limited human-to-human spread during the 1997 Hong Kong outbreak. A case-control study of health care workers in 3 hospitals caring for infected patients showed that more exposed health care workers were seropositive for H5N1 antibodies than nonexposed workers (3.7% versus 0.7%). 15 None exhibited signs of illness.",

These agents reduce the severity and duration of symptoms when initiated within 2 days of symptom onset. 2 These antiviral medications have not been well studied for avian influenza but may play a role in preventing concomitant human and avian influenza infection. The current H5N1 avian strain is resistant to M2 protein inhibitors. 4, 9, 11 Neuraminidase inhibitors, steroids, and broad-spectrum antibiotics were variably used in the recent H5N1 outbreaks. Given the relatively small number of patients and the completely uncontrolled manner in which the medications were used, however, no conclusions can be drawn regarding their efficacy. Influenza vaccination appears to be the most logical method of controlling the spread and prevent potential epidemics, but current vaccines provide no protection against avian H5 or H7 strains. Because H5 and H7 strains are highly lethal to chicken embryos, current vaccine production methods cannot produce avian vaccine efficiently. Newer vaccine production techniques, including the use of reverse genetics technology that can tailor rapidly to specific influenza strains, appear to be promising. 17 Full respiratory isolation precautions, similar to those for SARS, are recommended in all cases of suspected human infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. These include hand washing, gloves and gown, N95 masks, eye protection, and a negative pressure isolation room, if available. Those discharged home should be isolated in the home setting, as is recommended for SARS. These precautions should be continued for 14 days after onset of symptoms until an alternative diagnosis is established or test results indicate the patient is not infected with influenza A. The diagnosis of influenza A H5N1 should be considered and isolation precautions instituted for any patient with respiratory symptoms and either contact with poultry or recent travel to Southeast Asia.",
