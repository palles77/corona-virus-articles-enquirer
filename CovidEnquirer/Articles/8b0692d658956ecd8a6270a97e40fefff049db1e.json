Vector systems based on human adenovirus type 41 (Ad41) have been constructed and used to develop recombinant vaccines. Here, we attempted to study the seroprevalence of NAbs to Ad5 and Ad41 among children and adults in Qinghai province, China. The positive rates (titer P 40) of Ad5 and Ad41 NAb in adults from Xining city were 75.7% and 94.7%, respectively. The moderate/high-positive rates (titer P 160) of NAb were quite close between the two viruses in adults (70.4% for Ad5 and 73.5% for Ad41). Age-dependent increase of NAb seroprevalence was observed for both viruses in children. NAbpositive rate of Ad41 reached 50% at 3.3-4.6 years of age for children from Chengxi district, Xining city, approximately 1.5 years earlier than that of Ad5 did. Interestingly, NAb level was also associated with sanitary conditions among young children. For Ad5, 8-15% children (0.2-3.0 years of age) from city or town, where the sanitations were relatively better, had moderate/high-positive NAb, while the same rate was 62% for children from villages. For Ad41, 22% children from city, 47% from town and 88% from villages possessed moderate/high-positive NAb. The possible influence of NAb titer distributions on the application of Ad41-vectored vaccines was discussed in detail. Our results suggested that children from places with poor sanitations should be included for comprehensive Ad NAb seroprevalence studies, and provided insights to the applications of Ad41 vectors.",

Human adenovirus type 2 (Ad2) and Ad5, both of which belong to adenovirus species C (Ad-C), are the first types to be reconstructed into gene transfer vectors and are widely applied in gene therapy or recombinant vaccine studies [1, 2] . After that, Ad vectors based on other human or mam-malian Ad types were invented in succession to extend the cellular tropism since different Ads could recognize and infect different types of cell [3] . Preclinical studies and Clinical trials showed that serum neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) severely impaired the effect of Ad vector-mediated gene transfer [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . The use of various Ad vectors has additional benefits besides expanded cellular tropism: it can help evade the pre-existing NAb because NAbs against different Ad species have little cross-reactivity [9, 10] .",

The correlation analysis showed that the NAb titer values of Ad5 was independent with that of Ad41 (Kendall's tau-b = 0.014, P = 0.800).

However, rank-sum test result showed that there was no statistically significant difference among these age groups (P = 0.531). If the NAb levels were categorized into negative/low (640) and moderate/high positive (P160) subgroups and the data were re-analyzed with Pearson Chi-square test, statistically significant difference could only be found between age groups of 18-30 and 51-83 (P = 0.046). Logistic regression analysis of Ad41 NAb data showed that both gender and age had no impact on NAb level. The analysis of the child data also showed that gender was not a contributory factor to NAb titer. Therefore, gender factor was negligible and will not be further mentioned in following parts of the results section.

The trend of Ad infection was further investigated in children from 0.2 to 14 years of age. Enrolled were serum samples collected at Chengxi district of Xining city in 2014. The NAb titer distribution histograms were very different between Ad5 and Ad41 ( Fig. 2A) . If the columns of <40 were removed from the histograms, we could see that more children had low or high Ad5 NAb titer while very small number of children had the middle level of Ad5 NAb. The reverse was the case for Ad41. Age was the major factor influencing NAb level for both Ad5 and Ad41 when analyzed with logistic regression. Samples were grouped to 3 categories according to the age, and the percentages of NAb levels in different age groups are shown in Fig. 2B . Data of adults were also combined to build the plots although statistically significant differences between adult and child groups were not labeled. For Ad5, the prevalence rate increased as the age grew. The pairwise comparison results showed that NAb levels were significantly different between all child age groups. The percentage of high-positive Ad5 NAb kept going up among the child groups sorted with a growing age, and decreased in the adult group. This is because saturated infection had been reached in adult group and the NAb level would wane gradually in years post infection. For Ad41, the moderate/high rate was low (22%) in age group of 0.2-3.0 years, and it grew very rapidly and reached 90% in age group of 3.1-7.0 years. The pairwise comparison results showed that Ad41 NAb titers were significantly different between group 0.2-3.0 and other groups. The difference between groups 3.1-7.0 and 7.1-14 was not significant (P = 0.193). Actually, the infection had been saturated before age 7 as the high-positive percentage started to decrease after that. To find the age when 50% NAb-positive rate could be reached, the data of children were re-categorized into 5 age groups (each group consisted of 33 or 34 cases). As shown in Fig. 3 , NAbpositive rate of Ad5 reached 50% at the age of 4.7-6.7 years, approximately 1.5 years later than that of Ad41 did.",

Therefore, the data collected from children between 0.2 and 7.0 years of age in Chengxi district of Xining were combined. Logistic regression analysis showed that both geographic location and age had impact on NAb level of Ad5 and Ad41. The data from the 0.2-to 3.0-year age and the 3.1-7.0-year age groups were analyzed separately. As shown in Fig. 4A , children under 3 years of age in villages had an obviously higher Ad5 or Ad41 NAb titer than those living in town or city. For Ad41, children in town also had a higher NAb seroprevalence than those in city. More than 50% children in villages had moderate/high NAb level of Ad5 or Ad41 before 3 years of age. For children between 3 and 7 years old, the difference of NAb level between city, town and village gradually diminished as shown in Fig. 4B . Statistically significant difference was only found in Ad5 NAb between city and village (P = 0.006).

Prevalence rate of Ad5 NAb in China was reported to be 60-82% in healthy adults, which slightly fluctuated according to different geographic locations and age [24] [25] [26] . Our results showed that the seroprevalence of Ad5 NAb in adults in Xining was 75.7%, which was consistent with the published investigations [24] [25] [26] . Yu and the colleagues determined the Ad2 and Ad5 NAb titers of 274 children below 12 years of age in Changchun (the capital city of Jilin province, China), and found that Ad5 NAb prevalence rate was age dependent and the overall prevalence of Ad5 NAb was 43%. Our results of the Ad5 NAb prevalence in children in Xining were similar with that in Yu's report. In addition, we found that sanitary conditions might play an important role in Ad5 infection among young children less than 3 years of age. Children living in villages had higher titers of Ad5 NAb than children in town or city. This phenomenon is worth noting for Ad5-based vaccine development because children are supposed to be the major vaccination population and most of them are from rural or poor sanitation areas in china and other developing countries. Our results suggested that children from poor sanitation area should be included for comprehensive seroepidemiological surveys of Ad.",

In previous Ad41 NAb assay, wildtype Ad41 were commonly used and the titer of NAb was determined by observing the inhibition of diluted serum specimens on the occurrence of cytopathic effect (CPE) of indicator cells. CPE method was insensitive, subjective and time-consuming [20] . The inaccuracy might be further magnified by the fastidiousness feature of Ad41. We constructed recombinant Ad41 carrying GFP reporter gene, and directly determined the expression of reporter gene with a multimode plate reader. The sensitivity was substantially improved, as evidenced by increased titer value and prevalence of Ad41 NAb. We found a prevalence rate of Ad41 as high as 94.7% among healthy adults in Xining. The growth of prevalence was age-dependent in children, and positive rate reached 50% between 3.3 and 4.6 years of age.",

We found that children living in villages did have higher NAb level than those in town below 3 years of age (Fig. 4A) . Intriguingly, the difference in Ad41 NAb titer diminished in children more than 3 years of age. These results demonstrated that the sanitary condition was an important factor affecting the Ad41 NAb level at early time in life and Ad41related pathogens existed extensively in the environment. While our data implied that NAb of Ad5 seldom cross-reacted with that of Ad41, the NAb cross-reactivity between Ad40 and Ad41 was not investigated in this study. Ad-F comprises two members of Ad40 and Ad41. In Kidd's report, the cross-reaction between Ad40 and Ad41 NAbs was so strong that Kidd chose to use one Ad41 variant to determine the NAb of both Ad40 and Ad41 [27] .

Human maternal antibodies can persist for 6-12 months after birth [35] . If we looked into the NAb titer data of children in Chengxi district under 1 year of age, considerable number of infants (30%, 8/27) had an Ad5 NAb titer of 40, which might partly correspond to the maternal antibody. Interestingly, none of the 27 infants had an Ad41 NAb titer of 40.

When looking into this issue from the angle of quantitative analysis, it was suggested that low levels of Ad5 NAbs had no effect on the protective efficacy of Ad5 vectorbased vaccine [6, 36] . Ad40 or Ad41-based gene transfer vectors have been used in gene therapy or recombinant vaccine studies [18, 37, 38] . However, the impact of NAb on the infection of Ad40 or Ad41 is little known. In mouse model, passively transferred serum NAb to Ad conferred little resistance to intestinal challenge The data of adults served as controls and were not included for statistical analysis. The difference between each age groups was analyzed with nonparametric method (Kruskal-Wallis test), and a P value of <0.05 considered statistically significant. * P < 0.05; ** P < 0.01; and *** P < 0.001. by homologous virus although IgA in intestine could protect mice from re-infection [39, 40] . These findings led Kidd to comment that maternal serum NAb could not protect infants from the infection of Ad40 or Ad41 [27] . That serum NAb could not block re-infection of pathogen from mucosal route was also seen on Ad5 vector in mouse model [41] . Actually, it was Unicomb and the colleagues who dug deepest into this subject although their work is not frequently cited [42] . They found that even the NAb in intestine failed to protect infants from re-infection of enteric adenovirus. Of course, re-infection did not always mean a concomitant symptom of diarrhea. They attributed the weak neutralizing activity of NAb to the low titer. We found an obvious rise of Ad41 serum NAb prevalence in the people's early years of life. The proportion of strong positive Ad41 NAb was highest in children at 3-7 years of age and went down gradually after that age. For the healthy adults, the distribution of log-transformed Ad41 NAb titer was very close to a normal distribution, which was very different from that of Ad5 NAb (Fig. 1A) . Here, we tried to give a possible explanation to the reasons behind these phenomena. For Ad41, the pathogen is wildly spread. When infants without Ad41 NAb are infected, strong immune response is induced to produce high level of NAb to prevent a secondary infection. The high level of Ad41 NAb wanes as children grow to adults. When adults contact the pathogen, only those who have high titer of NAb in the intestine are protected from re-infection. However, most of adults have low level of NAb and will be re-infected (this explains why the pathogen is widely spread). For the infected adults with a low level of NAb, the preserved immunity against Ad41 can restrict the infection to be latent without occurrence of diarrhea symptom, and immune system is re-stimulated to produce moderate level of NAb in serum. For Ad5, pathogen in the environment is relatively rare. There exists a population who haven't contacted the pathogen during their entire life time. When people are infected, strong immune response can be stimulated to produce high level of NAb, and low level of Ad5 NAb can prevent the host from re-infection (this explains why the pathogen is rare in environment). The high level of Ad5 NAb in serum wanes naturally as people get older.",

Since re-infection of Ad41 occurs naturally and frequently, such vaccines can be applied to populations of all ages and don't need to be restricted to the NAb-negative children. It also means Ad41 as an antigen carrier can be reused several times during one's life span. Furthermore, restricted infection will make the vaccines safer. On the other side, mild infection will simultaneously lead to reduced immune response to the target antigen carried by Ad41 vector. More studies need to be performed to address these assumptions and questions.",
