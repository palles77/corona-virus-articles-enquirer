Bovine TB in deer and cattle has created immense fi nancial consequences for the livestock industry and hunting public. Surveillance identifi ed coyotes (Canis latrans) as potential bio-accumulators of Mycobacterium bovis, a fi nding that generated interest in their potential to serve as sentinels for monitoring disease risk. We sampled 175 coyotes in the bovine TB-endemic area. Fifty-eight tested positive, and infection prevalence by county ranged from 19% to 52% (statistical mean 33%, SE 0.07). By contrast, prevalence in deer (n = 3,817) was lower (i.e., 1.49%; Mann-Whitney U 4,4 = 14, p<0.001). By focusing on coyotes rather than deer, we sampled 97% fewer individuals and increased the likelihood of detecting M. bovis by 40%. As a result of reduced sampling intensity, sentinel coyote surveys have the potential to be practical indicators of M. bovis presence in wildlife and livestock.",

Diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian infl uenza, transmis-sible spongiform encephalopathies, Rift Valley fever, West Nile disease, anthrax, and Escherichia coli O157 infections recently have resulted in major public health and economic concerns, as well as public anxiety. Over 60% of the 1,415 known human pathogens and 75% of the 175 emerging pathogens are zoonotic (1) . Many emerging diseases have spilled over from wildlife directly (e.g., West Nile virus infection, hantavirus infection, and Lyme disease) or indirectly through domestic or peridomestic species (e.g., avian infl uenza, SARS, and Nipah virus infections, plague) (2) . Early detection of new disease outbreaks in domestic and wild animals is an essential prerequisite of disease control and eradication. Development of methods for early detection of diseases in free-ranging wildlife is problematic.",

            "text": "Development of practical strategies for conducting surveillance in free-ranging wildlife to detect and monitor disease and evaluate control efforts is a necessary component of predicting and managing emerging zoonoses. A case in point is bovine tuberculosis (TB). Mycobacterium bovis, the bacterial pathogen that causes bovine TB, has been identifi ed in wildlife, domestic animals, and humans (3) (4) (5) (6) . Transmission of M. bovis may occur through ingestion of infected tissues or, less likely, through inhalation of aerosolized bacilli (7) ; typically, granulomatous lesions develop in the thoracic lymph nodes and lung after aerosol exposure, and granulomatous lesions develop in the abdominal lymph nodes after oral exposure. Bovine TB often progresses slowly, and clinical symptoms may not appear until advanced stages are reached (8, 9) . In 1995, M. bovis was found in free-ranging white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in a localized area in the northeastern Lower Peninsula of Michigan (10) . In subsequent years, a reemergence of M. bovis in Michigan cattle was detected; deer Sentinel-based Surveillance of Coyotes to Detect Bovine Tuberculosis, Michigan were postulated to be the source of infection. Because the socioeconomic impact of this discovery has been immense (11), a strategy was developed and implemented to monitor and eradicate M. bovis from wildlife and cattle. Although the strategy successfully reduced the apparent prevalence of M. bovis in deer, the disease still persists at low levels (e.g., 2001-2006 statistical mean 2.3%) because of high deer densities (statistical mean 13/km 2 ) and spatiotemporal crowding resulting from supplemental feeding (12) . As prevalence of M. bovis in deer decreases, the sample size required to detect positive deer increases, making monitoring of the disease in deer more diffi cult and costly. Eventually, prevalence in deer may become too low to accurately estimate through current methods because of the diffi culty and expense of obtaining a suffi cient sample size, and consequent diffi culty of verifying disease eradication. We hypothesized that the presence of M. bovis in wild deer at low prevalence could be more accurately determined through an indirect estimator (i.e., a sentinel species). Use of sentinel animals has been suggested as a costeffective way to infer prevalence in host populations when direct estimation in such populations is diffi cult (13) . As facultative scavengers, coyotes (Canis latrans) may act as biological sensors and bio-accumulators of M. bovis. by consuming infected host material, resulting in high rates of infection. Furthermore, social foraging by coyote populations (14, 15) should increase the likelihood of multiple coyotes ingesting infected tissue from the same M. bovispositive deer. As a logical corollary, the increased numeric exposure of coyotes to M. bovis should mediate an increased detection probability relative to sampling effort. Support for this hypothesis was provided by research (5) , which reported an apparent prevalence of M. bovis. in opportunistically sampled coyotes as 4% in the general area where apparent prevalence in deer averaged 2.3% from 1995 through 2001 (16) . Finally, coyote home-range sizes (statistical mean 14.25 km 2 , 95% confi dence interval [CI] 9.54-18.96 km 2 ) in Michigan allow for reasonable estimates of where infection was acquired (17) .",

DMU 452 is the historic core bovine TBendemic area and remains a focal site of intensive sampling of hunter-killed deer (18) . Prior carnivore surveillance conducted by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) had detected M. bovis in 18 of 249 sampled coyotes. Given the history of intensive surveillance and elevated M. bovis prevalence in the area, it was the logical choice to implement and evaluate a sentinel-based surveillance program. Habitat associations within DMU 452 were diverse; moraine uplands were dominated by forests of jack pine (Pinus banksiana), white pine (P. alba), oak (Quercus spp.), and maple (Acer spp.). Dominant lowland vegetation included tag alder (Alnus rugosa) and white cedar (Thuja occidentalis), and wetland ephemera were common. Annual precipitation typically ranged from 71 cm to 91 cm; most occurred as snowfall (19) . Mean yearly summer and winter temperatures were 21\u00b0C and -10\u00b0C, respectively (19) .",

We trapped coyotes in 6 townships in Alcona County, 5 in Oscoda County, 2 in Montmorency County, and 2 in Alpena County. Because a large proportion of land in the study area was privately owned (e.g., commercial hunting clubs, agricultural operations, residential development), landowner permission to access property dictated trap placement. Thus, we were unable to randomize trapping locations or distribute traps proportionally among counties. Within each township, traps were checked daily, and trapping was terminated when 10 coyotes were collected. Because multiple captures could occur on the fi nal day of trapping, we occasionally collected >10 coyotes/township. We killed trapped coyotes with a 0.22-caliber gunshot to the brain, determined their age on the basis of tooth wear and eruption (20) , and performed necropsy examinations on them within an hour of death to minimize autolysis. Tissues containing visible lesions as well as the parotid, mandibular, retropharyngeal, bronchial, mediastinal, and mesenteric lymph nodes were collected and submitted in formalin for histologic examination and fresh for mycobacterial culture.",

            "text": "Early in the study, we discovered the importance of collecting diagnostic samples as soon as possible after death. Rapid autolysis of the gastrointestinal tract and associated mesenteric nodes quickly minimizes the utility of these tissues for histologic and microbiologic examination. Delays between time of euthanasia and tissue collection reduced the ability to identify lesions and associated acid-fast organisms as well as to propagate the organism in culture and consequently lower the apparent incidence of disease. Related to this, because MDNR only submitted diagnostic samples from deer with visible lesions and because samples collected from deer were not taken as quickly after death as those from coyotes, the prevalence rates in deer may have been underestimated. Also, infection of coyotes was independent of age groups and sex, which suggested that our sampling design did not bias detection of M. bovis occurrence relative to coyote demographic characteristics. This fi nding is critically important as to whether focal species are considered effectual disease sentinels (28) because age-or sex-biased dispersal can severely confound attempts to correlate the spatial distribution of disease occurrence between the sentinel and host. Capture biases in wildlife studies can be a legitimate concern, particularly where complex social behavior, such as agonism, can differentially infl uence the vulnerability of animals to various methods of capture. Our decision to collect coyotes exclusively by means of foot-hold traps, rather than hunting with dogs or with predator calls (the methods preferred by sport hunters), should have minimized sampling bias: socially dominant individual animals are potentially more susceptible to predator calls (29) . Furthermore, standardizing sampling effort to a single trapping period with a goal of 10 animals/transect should have ensured that the animals that were captured, and their disease status, were representative of the at-large population (30) .",

However, TB is a chronic infection, and animals usually survive in relatively good condition until severe clinical symptoms, such as extreme malaise (8) , appear at the penultimate stage of disease (9) . Because of this, there is a relatively short temporal frame (\u22482 weeks) between the onset of moribund condition and death (9) when capture probabilities may be biased by disease status. We found no evidence of physical debilitation positively or negatively infl uencing capture probability. Of 58 M. bovis-positive coyotes captured, none showed symptoms of severe emaciation or lethargy suggestive of advanced disease, and only 1 coyote bore widely disseminated lesions visible on gross inspection during necropsy. Thus, we believe our trap-transect method of sampling coyotes was robust to potential bias associated with coyote disease status. Because the animals were euthanized upon capture, our work was not replicable. Therefore, we could not use a design based on mark-recapture to determine if, in fact, our sampling protocol produced stable, increasing, or diminishing prevalence estimates over successive trapping sessions.",

            "text": "It appears that for coyotes infected with M. bovis, lesions predominantly localized to the lymphoid tissue of the gastrointestinal tract, although lesions concurrently developed in lymph nodes of the head in 16 coyotes. Lesions ranged from acute to chronic; marked fi brosis and few acid-fast organisms were noted in the chronic lesions. Only 1 animal had evidence of advanced disease, as evidenced by lesions in the lung and liver, which may have been caused by a large infectious dose, a compromised immune system, or long-term infection. The spectrum and locations of lesions led us to postulate that coyotes may acquire M. bovis orally and have the immunologic ability to minimize and possibly eliminate the bacteria. Our study was not designed to determine route of transmission or whether coyotes were a maintenance reservoir for M. bovis. However, preliminary results of current research indicate that excretion of M. bovis by coyotes experimentally inoculated with oral doses (ranging from 10 to 10 5 CFU) is probably unlikely or undetectable (M. Dunbar, National Wildlife Research Center, pers. comm.). If excretion of M. 1866 Emerging Infectious Diseases \u2022 www.cdc.gov/eid \u2022 Vol. 14, No. 12, December 2008 bovis is not likely in orally inoculated coyotes, then it is not likely to result in widespread infection among coyotes that would have become infected by ingesting infected tissue. Moreover, the absence of M. bovis in control coyotes sampled from the Upper Peninsula, where bovine TB has not been detected in white-tailed deer or cattle (12) , lends further credence to the belief that coyotes are spillover rather than maintenance hosts. For agrarian areas where livestock operations predominate, regular testing of domestic animals and slaughter of reactors can effectively prevent the long-term maintenance of M. bovis within localized livestock (34) . However, in areas where livestock densities are low, M. bovis prevalence in wildlife must be surveyed directly (13) . The disparity in prevalence relative to sampling effort between coyotes and deer is strong evidence that coyotes could be useful for monitoring M. bovis occurrence in Michigan (4). Coyotes in Michigan generally have larger home ranges than deer (coyotes, statistical mean 14.25 km 2 ; white-tailed deer, statistical mean 2.11 km 2 ; 17,35) and appear to have a much higher per capita probability of developing detectable infection. However, because of discrepant home-range sizes, attempts to spatially correlate sources of infection for coyotes, sympatric wildlife, and domestic livestock will be confounded by spatial scale. Thus, some question about the source of infection in coyotes will always remain; the presence of an infected coyote can only provide a broad indication of the location of the original source of infection. Although we noted that 44% of all M. bovis-positive coyotes were trapped within the boundaries of private hunt clubs, we cannot infer that coyotes acquired the pathogen within club boundaries. The only way to circumvent this inferential defi cit is to gather spatial information on a large sample of animals before killing them to determine their infection status (13) and then to develop probabilistic resource selection models (36) .",

For example, others have followed our lead to investigate the feasibility of using coyotes as sentinels for M. bovis in Manitoba, Canada, without documenting M. bovis in coyotes (37) . Their results could have occurred because prevalence rates in cervids were so low that they were not detected, given the number of coyotes sampled; coyotes are not the appropriate sentinel species; or both. Just as it is useful to determine why coyotes can function well as sentinels in Michigan, it is valuable to point out why the same does not appear so in Manitoba. We concur with the authors of the Manitoba study (37) that their negative results could be due to 1) the fact that it was unknown if trapped coyote ranges overlapped cervid ranges (much less if they overlapped the ranges of potentially infected cervids), 2) too low coyote sample size relative to prevalence rate in cervids, and 3) coyotes not being likely to prey on elk (Cervus elaphus); if they scavenge kills of other predators (wolves [Canis lupus], black bears [Ursus americanus]; which may be appropriate sentinels in Manitoba), infected tissues are likely no longer present (38) . Other reasons for their negative results could include the following: 1) ranges and diets of coyotes in the area were unknown, 2) the prevalence rate for cervids during the life of most coyotes collected was unknown and likely very low (<0.1%), and 3) if sample quality from carcasses salvaged from trappers or collected opportunistically was compromised, it could negatively affect the ability to detect M. bovis.",

Our work shows that coyotes are sensitive indicators of disease presence in Michigan. The collection protocol we designed to sample coyotes ensured the likelihood that sampled individuals were representative of the population and estimates of disease prevalence were relatively bias-free. Sentinel coyote surveys appear to be effectual cost-and labor-sensitive indicators of M. bovis presence in sympatric wildlife and domestic livestock. We concur with others (1,28) who endorse the use of sentinel-based surveillance programs, particularly when project goals include monitoring spatiotemporal changes in disease risk. In addition, we believe sentinel-based programs could facilitate adaptive monitoring of disease occurrence where the likelihood of horizontal transmission is great and/or spatial epidemiology is uncertain. From another perspective (39), we also believe that wildlife can serve as effective biologic sensors and satellites of some infectious disease epidemics and bioterrorism that threaten human health and safety.",

Mean apparent prevalence was signifi cantly greater in coyotes than in deer (Mann-Whitney U 4,4 = 14, p<0.001); this overall trend was consistent for all 4 counties.
