Two Cymbidium mosaic potexvirus (CymMV) isolates, M1 and M2, were studied. Both can infect Phalaenopsis orchids, but only M1 can systemically infect Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Protoplast inoculation and whole-mount in situ hybridization revealed that both isolates can replicate in N. benthamiana; however, M2 was restricted to the initially infected cells. Genome shuffling between M1 and M2 revealed that two control modes are involved in CymMV host dependent movement. The M1 coat protein (CP) plays a dominant role in controlling CymMV movement between cells, because all chimeric CymMV viruses containing the M1 CP systemically infected N. benthamiana plants. Without the M1 CP, one chimeric virus containing the combination of the M1 triple gene block proteins (TGBps), the M2 5\u2032 RNA (1-4333), and the M2 CP effectively moved in N. benthamiana plants. Further complementation analysis revealed that M1 TGBp1 and TGBp3 are co-required to complement the movement of the chimeric viruses in N. benthamiana. The amino acids within the CP, TGBp1 and TGBp3 which are required or important for CymMV M2 movement in N. benthamiana plants were mapped. The required amino acids within the CP map to the predicted RNA binding domain. RNA-protein binding assays revealed that M1 CP has higher RNA binding affinity than does M2 CP. Yeast two-hybrid assays to detect all possible interactions of M1 TGBps and CP, and only TGBp1 and CP self-interactions were observed.",

Plant viruses possess only limited genetic information; hence, to complete their infection cycles, interactions between virus proteins and necessary host factors is critical. For a virus to successfully infect different plant hosts, the limited number of virus-encoded proteins must have the ability to recognize and interact with factors in different hosts for a successful infection. For some plant viruses, host plants restrict viral cell-to-cell movement rather than viral replication, which results in a subliminal infection (Cheo, 1970; Sulzinski and Zaitlin, 1982) . In other cases, viruses may move from cell-to-cell, but the plant prevents viral long-distance spread (Fujita et al., 1996; Saenz et al., 2002; Wang et al., 1998) . Failure to accomplish any of the stages can be thought of as resistance.",

            "text": "In our previous studies, we collected several isolates of Cymbidium mosaic virus (CymMV) for construction of virus-induced gene silencing vectors for orchid functional genomic studies (Lu et al., 2007) . CymMV is a prevalent orchid virus and belongs to the genus Potexvirus in the family Flexiviridae (Adams et al., 2005b) . The recorded natural host range is largely limited to species belonging to Orchidaceae (ICTVdB: The Universal Virus Database of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses [http://www.ictvdb.iacr. ac.uk/Ictv/fr-index.htm.]; (Adams et al., 2005a; Zettler et al., 1990) . Interestingly, we found two distinct CymMV isolates, M1 and M2, both of which can infect Phalaenopsis orchids, but only M1 can systemically infect Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Because both isolates can systemically infect orchids, this suggests that viral-encoded replication and movement proteins are functional in orchids. However, because only M1 can systemically infect N. benthamiana plants this suggests that M1-encoded proteins could interact successfully with factors in both plant species to allow a systemic infection, but M2-encoded proteins do not. M1 and M2 share very high nucleotide sequence identity (97%), which suggests that subtle differences contribute to the differences in host reaction.",

Studies of potexviruses have contributed importantly to our understanding of the complexity of the mechanisms of plant virus movement within plants (Lucas, 2006; Verchot-Lubicz, 2005; Verchot-Lubicz et al., 2007) . Comprehensive studies of potexviruses has revealed that triple gene block proteins (TGBps) and coat proteins (CP) work cooperatively to promote viral movement between cells and long-distance in their plant hosts (Bayne et al., 2005; Beck et al., 1991; Chapman et al., 1992; Fedorkin et al., 2001; Forster et al., 1992; Ju et al., 2007; Krishnamurthy et al., 2003; Lin et al., 2006; Lough et al., 1998 Lough et al., , 2000 Mitra et al., 2003; Tamai and Meshi, 2001; Verchot-Lubicz, 2005 ). The current model suggests that TGBp1 increases the plasmodesmatal size-exclusion limit and moves into neighboring cells to suppress RNA silencing (Bayne et al., 2005; Howard et al., 2004) ; both TGBp1 and CP bind viral RNA (vRNA) forming viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNP; (Karpova et al., 2006; Lough et al., 2000 Lough et al., , 2001 ; the complex is then delivered by TGBp2 induced vesicles (containing TGBp3) to plasmodesmata, and through plasmodesmata to neighboring cells; later, after the free form of TGBp1 binds membrane-associated TGBp2 and/or TGBp3, then TGBp1 (on the vRNP complex) binds with the membrane-associated TGBp1 complex (TGBp1 with TGBp2 or TGBp3) to form a membrane-bound complex and begin new rounds of replication (Verchot-Lubicz, 2005) .",

In this study, we aimed to use our CymMV-M1, -M2 and N. benthamiana system to study the molecular basis of CymMV isolatedependent host movement determinants, and to resolve the mechanism involved in CymMV translocation. Our studies not only help to identify the molecular determinants of CymMV isolate-dependent host movement, but other phenomena that are not easily resolved by studies using a single isolate. Finally, our efforts revealed two control behaviors, dominant and matching modes, involved in CymMV host dependent movement, and showed that the binding strength between the CymMV CP and genomic RNA is correlated with the dominant control mode.",

Our results indicated that the important amino acids of the CP that allowed for the CymMV systemic infection are located within the previously predicted RNA binding domain ( Fig. 7A; 1) . Thus, it might be that the binding affinity between CPs and RNAs of CymMV M1 and M2 may play roles in CymMV movement, and therefore we attempted to analyze and compare their binding affinities. Because the whole genomic RNA of CymMV is 6227 nucleotides in length, which made conventional gel-shift assays difficult, we performed modified RNA-protein pull-down assays for our analyses. Our data indicated that CymMV M1 CP has a higher binding affinity as compared to CymMV M2 CP (Fig. 7D, lanes 1-4) . We then also performed CP and CymMV RNA binding assays on CymMV M2 CP with the amino acid changes G82A and L89P (derived from clone pCymMV-M2-CP-GL/AP; Fig. 6H ). The results indicated that with these amino acid changes (G82A and L89P), the binding affinity was higher as compared to wild-type CymMV-M2 CP (Fig 7D, lanes 3 ,4,5 and 6).",

Similarly, site-directed mutagenesis was conducted on pCymMV-M2/TGB1-M1 (Fig. 4C ) and pCymMV-M2-TGB3-M1-TGB1 HR/YH (Fig. 8K) to construct clones substituted with Q8L and/ or S71A at TGBp3 (Fig. 8L-O) . Both Q8L and/or S71A in M2 TGBp3 were important but not required for M2 to systemically infect N. benthamiana. Mutants having only one of these changes moved systemically, but the ratio of systemically infected plants was much reduced (Figs. 8G-O). The Y 44 (position 44) and H 94 in TGBp1 are located within the previous predicted NTP/helicase domain but not in the identified conserved motifs (Kadare and Haenni, 1997; Kalinina et al., 2002; Leshchiner et al., 2006) , and L 8 and A 71 in TGBp3 are also not located in the previously identified transmembrane domain ( Fig. 9B;21) .",

Interestingly, our data also showed that if CP was not properly functional (e.g., M2 CP), alterations in TGBps (e.g., M1 TGBp1 and 3) may compensate for the function of CP and allow CymMV to systemically infect N. benthamiana plants (Fig. 3F ). In addition, when comparing pCymMV-M2/TGB-M1 and pCymMV-M1/CP-M2 (Figs. 3F and G), only pCymMV-M2/TGB-M1 was movement competent. The TGBps and CP are the same in both chimeric viruses. These data indicate that another control mode which required correct matching of the particular movement accessory components (M2 5\u2032 RNA, TGBp1 and TGBp3 and M2 CP) also allowed the systemic infection of CymMV in N. benthamiana ( Fig. 3F and Fig. 5 ).

However, no matter what the proposed form of vRNP that moves between cells, all data suggest that potexvirus CP and vRNA are involved in forming the vRNP which traffics to the plasmodesmata. Our analysis indicated that the CymMV CP-vRNA binding affinity likely plays an important role in CymMV movement in N. benthamiana plants. Therefore, it is possible that the binding between CP-vRNA may affect the nature of vRNP; thus affecting the movement of CymMV in different hosts.",

When the binding between CP-vRNA is higher (Fig. 7 D) , the need for TGBps in CymMV movement is more flexible (Figs. 3A, C, E, H) ; however, when the binding between CP-vRNA is weaker, the need for TGBps in CymMV movement is critical and only certain combinations of CymMV movement accessory components allowed for CymMV movement (Figs. 3B, F, 4G). It has been previously reported that in systemic hosts of PVX, the movement of TGBps are host dependent (Krishnamurthy et al., 2002; Yang et al., 2000) . Because in different hosts the cellular conditions and morphology are different, it is possible that potexviruses may use different strategies to adapt to different hosts. Adjusting movement accessory components could be an efficient way to generate the diversity of functions in response to changes of cellular conditions and provide flexibility for virus movement in different hosts, and thus could be an advantage for viruses with modular designed movement proteins (Morozov and Solovyev, 2003) . Although interactions between potexvirus TGBp1 and TGBp2 and between TGBp1 and TGBp3 have been suggested (Karpova et al., 2006; Krishnamurthy et al., 2002; Lough et al., 2000; Verchot-Lubicz, 2005; Yang et al., 2000) , the interactions have yet to be proven. Interestingly, our data, showed that CymMV M1-encoded TGBp1 and TGBp3 are corequired for M2 systemic infection of N. benthamiana (Fig. 4G) ; which support the hypothesis for interactions between TGBp1 and TGBp3. However, the results of our yeast two-hybrid analysis were similar to those that have been recently reported showing that TGBp1 was selfassociated, but showed no interactions between TGBp1 and TGBp2 or TGBp3 (Samuels et al., 2007) . Thus, the interactions may not occur physically, or the interactions could be transient and not easily detected.",

Although, currently the roles of NTPase/helicase domains in potexvirus movement have not been well established , mutations eliminating the DEY motif affects the protein subcellular targeting and mutations eliminating the DEY and GKS motifs inhibit the ability of TGBp1 to increase plasmodesmata size-exclusion limits as well as virus movement (Angell et al., 1996; Lough et al., 1998; Morozov et al., 1999) .

The amino acids are also not in the positions within the NTPase/helicase domain previously reported as essential for Bamboo mosaic potexvirus movement (Lin et al., 2004) .

The amino acids identified in TGBp3 which are important for CymMV-M2 movement in N. benthamiana are not located in the transmembrane domain ( Fig. 9 ; Krishnamurthy et al., 2003) . Because all amino acids identified in CymMV TGBp1 and TGBp3 are not located in the conserved motifs previously identified among potexviruses, nor within the amino acids reported as essential for potexvirus movement, we speculate that changes in these regions may only slightly affect but not abolish the function (as we see in the case of CymMV-M2 CP) of TGBp1 and TGBp3, and the differential function required for virus movement is host dependent. This may explain why M1 and M2 can both systemically infect Phalaenopsis orchid, but only M1 can systemically infect N. benthamiana. (Thompson et al., 1997) . The previously identified conserved positive charged amino acids are indicated by stars (Abouhaidar and Lai, 1989) It is worth noting that correct matching of the particular movement accessory components also includes the CymMV 5\u2032 RNA sequence and/or the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The potexvirus RdRp has not been reported to be required for virus movement, however it has been suggested that the 5\u2032 untranslated region of the potexvirus genomic RNA plays a role in viral cell-to-cell movement (Lough et al., 2006) .",
