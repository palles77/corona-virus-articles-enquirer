Viral 'fusion proteins' facilitate this process. They vary greatly in structure, but all seem to have a common mechanism of action, in which a ligand-triggered, large-scale conformational change in the fusion protein is coupled to apposition and merger of the two bilayers. We describe three examples-the influenza virus hemagglutinin, the flavivirus E protein and the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein-in some detail, to illustrate the ways in which different structures have evolved to implement this common mechanism. Fusion inhibitors can be effective antiviral agents.",

One or more viral membrane proteins facilitate the various fusion steps. Several such fusion proteins have now been studied in great detail, with crystal structures determined for both the form of the protein present on the viral surface before interaction with the cell ('pre-fusion' conformation) and the form of the protein after fusion is complete ('post-fusion' conformation). The proteins show a variety of molecular architectures, but what we can infer from the various structures and from experiments both in solution and with cells suggests that all of them catalyze fusion in essentially the same way. We can even draw a rough analogy to serine proteases, which can have very different polypeptide chain folds but identical active-site mechanisms.",

All viral fusion proteins studied so far have two membrane-interacting elements: a C-terminal transmembrane anchor that holds the protein in the viral membrane and a distinct hydrophobic patch ('fusion peptide' or 'fusion loop(s)') that ultimately interacts with the target membrane. Moreover, they all happen to be trimeric in their fusion-active state. In the initial step in the fusion reaction, the fusion protein, responding to binding of a ligand (protons in many cases, as the mechanism has evolved to respond to the low pH of an endosome3,4, but cellular or viral protein ligands in other cases), undergoes a conformational change that extends each subunit toward the target membrane and yields a contact between that membrane and the fusion peptide or loop(s) (Fig. 1a to Fig. 1b) . Many fusion proteins are C-terminal fragments of a larger precursor (for example, the HA2 fragment of influenza virus hemagglutinin or the gp41 fragment of HIV Env), and initiating the fusion process requires that they must first shed their N-terminal fragment, which often contains a receptor-binding domain (for example, HA1 or gp120-see the more detailed description of influenza virus hemagglutinin below). Although strong, the evidence for an extended intermediate is indirect. The putative extended state is sometimes called a 'pre-hairpin intermediate', as the next step is collapse into a folded-back conformation. The intermediate may have a relatively long half-life; for HIV-1 gp41, the half-life seems to be many minutes, but in other cases, it may only be a few seconds.",

The core of HA1 is a sialic acid-binding domain, borne on a stalk formed by HA2. The central feature of the stalk is a three-chain, \u03b1-helical coiled coil. HA0 and its cleaved product, prefusion HA1-HA2, are essentially identical in overall structure. The cleavage, which normally happens in the trans-Golgi network (TGN), but which can also occur after viral budding, leads to a modest local rearrangement, in which the newly generated N terminus of HA2 inserts into a pocket along the three-fold axis, burying the fusion peptide (the first 20-25 residues of HA2). The pocket is created by a splaying apart from each other of the C termini of the HA2 coiled-coil helices, so that the three helices diverge from the three-fold axis and from each other, rather like a narrow tripod (Fig. 3a) .",

As the plasma membrane recycles regularly through various forms of endocytosis, the virus-receptor complex may not require a specific endocytic signal in order to reach an endosome. When the HA1:HA2 trimer encounters low pH, it undergoes a large-scale conformational rearrangement, in which HA1 separates from HA2 ( Fig. 3a to Fig. 3b ), except for a residual disulfide tether, and the latter effectively turns inside out20,23,24. The two key features of this HA2 refolding are a loop-to-helix transition25 in the region connecting the fusion peptide to the central coiled coil (Fig. 3b to Fig. 3c ) and reorientation of the C-terminal part of the molecule so that it zips up alongside the extended coil ( Fig. 3c to Fig. 3d ). These correspond, respectively, to formation of the extended intermediate and to its collapse into a conformation that brings together the fusion peptide and the transmembrane anchor. The loop-to-helix transition in the N-terminal part of HA2 augments the central coiled-coil at its N-terminal end (Fig. 3c) ; reorientation of the C-terminal part of the protein breaks the central helices where they splay apart, at the site from which the fusion peptide has withdrawn earlier in the fusion process ( Fig. 3c to Fig. 3d ).",

E has both receptor-binding and fusogenic activities; M is the proteolytic residuum of a precursor, prM, which is the form incorporated into immature virions. The virus assembles by budding into the endoplasmic reticulum, and furin cleavage of prM in the TGN releases most of its ectodomain. Immature virions do not fuse, even when triggered by lowering the pH, as prM is essentially a chaperone that prevents the fusion-inducing conformational transition. Cleavage of prM to M is the processing step that primes the particle for low pH-induced membrane fusion and hence is not a modification of the fusion protein itself, but rather of its companion30. The closely related alphaviruses (for example, Sindbis and Semliki Forest viruses) have a different cellular maturation pathwaythey bud at the plasma membrane-but their fusion proteins (designated E1) are very similar in structure to those of the flaviviruses, and priming is likewise by cleavage of a partner protein (E2).",

Collapse of the extended, trimeric intermediate that results from these events can then proceed, by rotation of domain III in each subunit about the segment that links it to domain I and (presumably) by zipping up of the stem alongside the clustered domains II. Protonation of one or two conserved histidine residues at the domain I-domain III interface probably contributes to initiating this process37. Mutations around a hydrophobic pocket at the domain I-domain II interface also affect the pH threshold; this region undergoes a hinge-like change during the transition, and alterations in the bulk of the hydrophobic side chains that face the pocket could influence both the kinetic barrier and the net free energy change of the process10.",

We can analyze the structure as three domains, each of roughly invariant fold, linked by segments that change conformation as the domains rotate with respect to one another (Fig. 5) . A core domain, based on a \u03b2-sandwich (red in Figs. 5b-d) and a relatively long \u03b1-helix (light blue in Figs. 5b-d), dominates the threefold contact in the high-pH (prefusion) conformation. This domain contains residues from the N-terminal segment of the polypeptide chain and residues from near the C-terminal part of the chain: we can consider it a framework around which the rest of the molecule reorients. The other two domains form a jointed, two-part fusion machinery. The net effect of their rotations relative to each other and to the core domain is to translate the fusion loops, at the tip of the outermost domain, away from the viral membrane and toward the target membrane. In a likely extended intermediate conformation (shown in Fig. 5c , but for which there are as yet no direct structural data), the C-terminal segment still connects 'downward', even as the fusion loops interact with the target. In the fully rearranged, low-pH conformation (Figs. 5d,e), the Cterminal segment has zipped up along the fusion domains, much as in the flavivirus fusion transition. Aside from this zipping up of the C terminus, the most pronounced conformational change is the loop-to-helix transition of the 12-residue segment between the fusion domains and the core domain ( Fig. 5b to Fig. 5c , blue helix), reminiscent of the even more notable loop-to-helix transition in influenza HA2. As in hemagglutinin, the loop-tohelix transition in VSV-G creates a long, three-chain coiled coil at the trimer axis and seems to propel the fusion loops toward the target membrane.",

Only the presumptive post-fusion structure of gB has been determined so far. The gB conformational transition is triggered not by changes in pH, but rather by receptor binding to another surface protein, gD.

For these viruses, priming occurs during transport of the immature glycoprotein to the cell surface, either before assembly of the virus particle by budding at the cell surface or after a formation of an immature particle by budding through an internal membrane. The glycoproteins of other viruses-Ebola virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus in particular-require cleavage by endosomal cathepsins B or L during cell entry rather than during maturation42,43. The SARS coronavirus spike protein, S, is a trimer of uncleaved chains on the virion surface, but receptor binding seems to make it susceptible to cathepsin L (ref. 43 ). In addition to making the fusogenic conformational rearrangement possible, cathepsin attack, by releasing a covalent constraint, may also be sufficient to induce the rearrangement-that is, cleavage may be a triggering as well as a priming step, after a 'prepriming' by the receptor interaction. The Ebola virus glycoprotein, GP0, is cleaved by furin to GP1 and GP2 before incorporation into virions. Degradation of GP1 by cathepsins may be part of the triggering step, to release GP2 from the constraints that prevent its fusogenic conformational rearrangement, but some further endosomal activity seems to be required as well44.",

Once that covalent restraint has gone (irreversibly), a high kinetic barrier still separates the primed from the post-fusion conformation. The trigger that lowers this barrier (or provides the required activation energy) can be binding of a proton, for viruses that have evolved to detect a low-pH, endosomal environment, or binding of a co-receptor in some other cases (for example, HIV-1); for herpesviruses and paramyxoviruses, the trigger is an altered lateral contact with another viral surface protein that has itself changed conformation because of binding with a cellular receptor.

The post-fusion conformation of the gp41 ectodomain is particularly simple-just a trimer of hairpins, in which both prongs of the hairpin are \u03b1-helices49-51 (Fig. 6 ). Approximately 50 residues immediately C-terminal to the fusion peptide (designated HR1, where \"HR\" stands for \"heptad repeats\") form a central, three-chain coiled coil. A loop that contains a conserved disulfide bond connects the HR1 segment to a second heptad-repeat element, HR2, which forms an outer-layer \u03b1-helix. Peptides from this outer layer can inhibit the fusion process52,53. The mechanism involves association of the peptide with the inner core, preventing transition to the post-fusion conformation. The lifetime of the intermediate, as detected by the capacity of such peptides to inhibit fusion during the period after attachment and initiation of conformation change, is at least several minutes54; its magnitude is probably determined by the resistance of the two membranes to being pulled toward each other. Without that resistance, the zipping up of the outer layer might be too rapid for peptide to intervene. HIV fusion occurs at the cell surface, and one such inhibitory peptide (T-20, or enfuvirtide) is a clinically useful drug55. Mutations conferring resistance to T-20 can occur at various positions in the envelope protein, including residues in gp120 (ref. 56) . Some of the mutations in HR1 that reduce T-20 binding also retard fusion and enhance sensitivity to antibodies targeting the membrane-proximal region of gp41 (ref. 57 ).

            "text": "Cell-cell fusion mediated by influenza virus hemagglutinin responds nonlinearly to the concentration of hemagglutinin on the cell surface, in a manner consistent with cooperativity in fusion-pore formation59. An estimate obtained from analysis of the lag time to fusion (after a drop in pH) for red blood cells with hemagglutinin-expressing cells suggests that three or four hemagglutinin trimers might participate in a single fusion event. As the resistance of the two membranes to deformation and the height of the kinetic barrier leading to hemifusion will probably change with membrane composition, it is likely that the actual number of hemagglutinin trimers required will vary from cell type to cell type. Cooperativity, if it occurs, could have two distinct mechanisms. One requires lateral contacts between adjacent trimers in a ring around the fusion pore site. A specific structure for such a ring has been proposed for the alphavirus fusion protein17. Lateral contacts would couple the conformational change of one trimer to that in another, as in allosteric regulation of multi-subunit enzymes. The other mechanism, which will contribute even if the former does also, results simply from the response of the two membranes to the distortions necessary to promote fusion. At least two properties of bilayer membranes will cause them to resist the collapse of the extended protein intermediates that bridge them. One is the energy of bending-for example, into the nipple-like configuration (Fig. 1c) ; the other is the so-called 'hydration force', which creates a substantial barrier when apposing membranes come closer than about 10-20 \u00c5 (ref. 61) . Because all the proteins participating in a fusion event bridge the same pair of membranes, the behavior of one extended intermediate is not independent of the behavior of a neighboring one-they are coupled by the deformation energies of the two bilayers they connect.",

Deformation of a planar membrane into a nipple-like bud (Fig. 1c) creates a nearly hemispherical cap, with roughly uniform positive curvature, and a flared region joining it to the planar membrane of the membrane. The flared region has positive curvature in one direction (around the axis of the nipple) and negative in the other (within the plane of the cross-section in Fig. 1c) , and hence little net elastic distortion. Using reasonable dimensions for the bud5, one can estimate the difference in area between the inner and outer leaflets of the positively curved cap as 2 \u00d7 10 4 \u00c5 2 . Available structural data show that fusion loops and fusion peptides insert only partway into the outer leaflet of the target membrane, displacing lipid head groups laterally and therefore favoring curvature of the leaflet11,17,27. But their contribution is probably only a modest fraction of the total curvature in the cap. For example, the tip of one flavivirus trimer occupies about 800 \u00c5 2 . Hence, insertion of the tips of even five or six trimers will provide only 20%-25% of the required distortion. The direction of curvature promoted by the observed insertion does suggest, however, that as the extended intermediates collapse, their fusion peptides or fusion loops may tend to concentrate in the positively curved cap and migrate toward the developing hemifusion stalk. At this stage, they may contribute substantially to the difference between the areas of the inner and outer leaflets.",

The membrane-proximal segments of influenza virus hemagglutinin might have a defined role in stabilizing the final, post-fusion structure (and hence potentially in stabilizing an open fusion pore) (Fig. 3e) . The membrane-proximal region of HIV gp41 has been studied with particular attention, as it is the target of two well-characterized, broadly neutralizing antibodies, both of which seem to target the extended intermediate rather than the pre-fusion envelope trimer.

It thus seems that collapse of the extended intermediate-the transition that induces hemifusion-stalk formation-is not sufficient to drive the fusion process to completion. At the hemifusion stage, a hemagglutinin-induced fusion pore can flicker open and closed6, and we may infer that some property of the fusion protein, connected with complete traversal of the membrane, must accelerate the forward reaction. The capping of the central helix in influenza HA2 (Fig.  3e) shows that formation of a well-defined structure, with tight hydrophobic and hydrogenbonding interactions among the participating amino acid residues, brings about a concerted closure of the conformational transition, drawing the near ends of the transmembrane helices together and causing the cytoplasmic segments on the opposite side of the membrane to pass into or through the nascent fusion pore24. Presence of these segments in the aqueous channel of a fusion pore will prevent its resealing and may explain how a cytoplasmic element at the far end of the transmembrane anchor can drive the fusion process forward65. In other words, formation of a cap on the HA2 helical bundle when zipping-up is complete becomes a mechanism for making pore formation irreversible28 because cap formation couples to a translocation, into or through the pore, of material from the cytoplasmic face of the bilayer.",

Small molecules have been found that block HIV fusion, by screening for compounds that compete with an outer-layer peptide for binding to the three-helix bundle of the post-fusion gp41 inner core66. It might be possible to extend this strategy to many other viruses, as zipping up of an outer-layer segment against the inner core of an intermediate is a universal feature of the fusion-inducing conformational changes illustrated in Figures 3-6 .",

The site for these molecules is probably a pocket in gp120 that closes up in the initial, CD4-induced conformational transition68. Productive receptor binding must expel the compound from this site and thus incur an inhibitor-specific free-energy cost. A candidate has been described for a similar kind of site on dengue virus E-a pocket that disappears when the protein starts to rearrange10. Indeed, any protein that undergoes a large-scale conformational change is likely to have some sort of small-molecule binding site that changes or disappears in the transition from one state to the other. We need now to understand when it is practical to exploit this property for discovery of useful compounds. A structure-based, mechanistic analysis of membrane fusion, as outlined in this review, can clearly contribute to the discovery process. Schematic diagram illustrating the (free) energy changes during fusion of two bilayers. The relative heights of the various barriers are arbitrary. Fusion proteins accelerate the process by coupling traversal of these barriers to energetically favorable conformational changes. Figure  1 . (e) Detail illustrating some features of the membrane-proximal region of influenza virus HA2 after fusion is complete. The N termini of the coiled-coil helices are capped by contacts with amino acid residues in the link between the fusion peptide and the coiled coil, as well as with residues near the C terminus of the ectodomain, proximal to the transmembrane helices24. This cap locks into place all the membrane-proximal components of the structure. The fusion peptides at the N termini of three HA2 chains are shown as cylinders (possible amphipathic helices) lying partly immersed in the outer leaflet of the membrane bilayer, as suggested by NMR and EPR studies27. The transmembrane segments, likely to be \u03b1-helices, are also shown as cylinders. The relationships in this drawing among the fusion peptides and the transmembrane helices, chosen to illustrate the scale of the structures and the approximate distances between them, are purely schematic, as there is no single structure yet determined experimentally that contains all the elements included here. Only the crystallographically determined components are in ribbon representation. VSV-G: proposed fusogenic conformational changes. (a) Pre-fusion trimer. The three subunits are in red, blue and green. The fusion loops (asterisk) are held away from the target membrane. The crystal structure13 does not include about 40 residues, represented here for each subunit by a slightly wavy line, that connect to the transmembrane anchor. (b ) Prefusion conformation of one subunit (in the orientation of the red subunit in a). Core domain, red; \u03b1-helix at the trimer contact, light blue; two-part fusion apparatus, dark blue; C-terminal segment, dark green. Dashed line, the part of the C-terminal segment that is missing from the crystal structure; letter N, the N terminus. (c ) Suggested extended intermediate conformation of one subunit, colored as in b. The fusion domains have reoriented (curved arrow in b), with the fusion loops (asterisk) now in contact with the target membrane; the reorientation seems to be driven in part by a loop-to-helix transition that elongates the helix at the trimer contact. The C-terminal segment still connects to the viral membrane (dashed arrow), but it must fold back along the outside of the trimer (curved arrow) to complete the transition to the post-fusion conformation. (d) Post-fusion conformation of one subunit, in the orientation and colors of the subunit in b and c. The C-terminal segment has folded back, and it now projects toward the fusion loops. (e) Post-fusion conformation of the trimer12, with colors as in a. It is shown in a 'horizontal' orientation, to correspond to the sequence in Figure 1 . The transition between the trimeric extended intermediate and the post-fusion conformation of the HIV gp41 ectodomain. In the extended intermediate (left), the HR1 segment of each of the three subunits is shown as an \u03b1-helix, and the HR2 segment as an extended chain. The fusion peptides are imagined to be inserted into or against the target-cell membrane (top) and the transmembrane anchors pass into the viral membrane (bottom). In the post-fusion conformation (right), the HR2 segment has zipped up into a helix along the outside of the HR1 three-chain coiled-coil, creating a 'trimer of hairpins', and the two membranes have fused.

Experiments with HIV and HIV pseudotypes containing a mixture of cleavable and uncleavable (and hence active and inactive) fusion proteins suggest that only one active retroviral envelope trimer is sufficient for fusion, while confirming the requirement for several hemagglutinin trimers60. The fusion proteins of HIV and other retroviruses may have evolved to manage with a single fusion protein, as the complement of trimers on the virion surface can be rather sparse: estimates of 15-20 trimers total have been made for HIV. Rough calculations based on the known (K d \u2248 1 nM) affinity of an HIV gp41 outer-layer peptide for a trimeric inner core suggest that the free energy liberated during collapse of the extended intermediate to the folded-back trimer of hairpins might approach the estimate of ~40-50 kcal mol \u22121 for the hemifusion barrier.",

(a) The protein in the pre-fusion conformation, with its fusion peptide or loop (light green) sequestered. The representation is purely schematic, and various features of specific proteins are not incorporated-for example, the displacement of the N-terminal fragment of proteins that are cleaved from a precursor or the dimer-to-trimer rearrangement on the surface of flaviviruses. (b ) Extended intermediate. The protein opens up, extending the fusion peptide or loop to interact with the target bilayer. The part of the protein that bears the fusion peptide forms a trimer cluster. (c) Collapse of the extended intermediate: a C-terminal segment of the protein folds back along the outside of the trimer core. The segments from the three subunits fold back independently, so that at any point in the process they can extend to different distances along the trimer axis, and the entire trimer can bow outward, away from the deforming membrane. (d) Hemifusion. When collapse of the intermediate has proceeded far enough to bring the two bilayers into contact, the apposed, proximal leaflets merge into a hemifusion stalk.

The binding site for the receptor, sialic acid, is at the top of each subunit, but contact with a receptor molecule is not shown. Red asterisk, the sequestered fusion peptide of the red subunit, at the N terminus of HA2. (b) HA1 dissociates from its tightly docked position in response to proton binding. Each HA1 remains flexibly tethered to the corresponding HA2 by a disulfide bond (near the bottom of the ectodomain, in the orientation shown here). (c) The extended intermediate. The loop between the shorter and longer helices in HA2 (for example, the two red helices and the loop connecting them, in b) becomes a helix, thereby translocating the fusion peptide toward the target membrane. The fusion peptides (asterisk) are shown interacting as amphipathic helices with the target bilayer. The loop-to-helix transition creates a long, threechain coiled coil at the core of the trimer. (d ) Collapse of the extended intermediate to generate the post-fusion conformation. The lower parts of the protein (as seen in the orientation in c) fold back along the outside of the three-chain coiled coil. The collapse is complete only when the two membranes have fused completely. The post-fusion conformation is shown in a 'horizontal' orientation, to correspond to the sequence in",

(a) The packing of 180 E subunits (90 dimers) in an icosahedral array on the surface of a flavivirus particle31. The red, yellow and blue parts of each subunit correspond respectively to domains I, II and III of the ectodomain. (b) 'Side view' of the pre-fusion, dimeric conformation of the E protein, based on the crystal structure of dengue E (residues 1-395)10, supplemented by a representation of the 'stem' segment (two helices linked by a short loop, lying in the plane of the membrane head groups) and the transmembrane anchor (a helical hairpin), derived from a cryo-EM reconstruction of the virion31. The domains in one of the two subunits are colored as in a; the other subunit is in gray. The fusion loop is at the tip of domain II, on the far right of the colored subunit, buried at the contact with domain III of the dimer partner. (c ) Monomeric transition between the pre-fusion dimer and the trimeric extended intermediate. The three subunits that will associate into the extended intermediate in d are not yet in contact. The drawing embodies the suggestion that domains I and II have swung outward, while domain III and the stem remain oriented against the membrane roughly as in the pre-fusion state. The fusion loop is now at the top of the diagram and is shown already interacting with the target bilayer. (d) Extended intermediate. Domains I and II have associated into the trimeric core of the post-fusion conformation, but domain III has not yet flipped over (upper arrows) to dock against them47.To indicate that the stem segment must then zip back along the trimer core (lower arrows), the stem is represented by loops 'poised' to reconfigure. (e ) Post-fusion conformation. Domain III has reoriented, and the stem (dashed line, as there is no direct structural information on its conformation or exact position in the post-fusion trimer) connects it to the transmembrane anchor, now brought together with the fusion loop in the single, fused bilayer. The post-fusion conformation is shown in a 'horizontal' orientation, to correspond to the sequence inFigure 1.",
