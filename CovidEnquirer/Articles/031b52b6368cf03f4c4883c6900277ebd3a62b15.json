A deletion of 5 amino acids in the viral neuraminidase stalk has also been observed, which may be responsible for the change in viral tropism to the respiratory tract or to enhanced viral replication [1] .

Males predominated in number over females, with a sex ratio of about 2:1. Despite the fact that the exact reason remains to be elucidated, the uneven age distribution might explain the expected 60% prevalence of comorbidities (eg, coronary heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension), which may further add to the complexity of clinical management of these critically ill patients.",

Positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) was commonly set at 10 to 20 cm H 2 O. Higher PEEP level or recruitment maneuver was seldom attempted because (1) high PEEP level exerted minimal, if any, effect to improve oxygenation, a surrogate marker of alveolar recruitment; and (2) similar to coronavirus [7] , respiratory syncytial virus [8] , 2009 influenza A (H1N1) [9] , and other viral infections, H7N9 infections were associated with significantly increased risk of barotrauma (eg, pneumothorax and/or pneumomediastinum) (Fig. 1) . Thus, in those patients with severe hypoxemia and high risk of barotrauma, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was used to improve oxygenation. Despite the lack of uniform entry criteria, patient characteristics before the commencement of ECMO were compatible with those of 68 patients with severe 2009 influenza A (H1N1)-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome reported by Davies and his colleagues, that is, acute lung injury score of 3.8 (3.5-4.0), the lowest PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratio of 56 (48-63), highest FIO 2 of 1.0, and highest PEEP of 15 to 20 cm H 2 O [10] . Currently, a total of 16 patients had been treated with ECMO. As of April 27, 2013, 5 were successfully weaned from ECMO or even mechanical ventilation, 3 had died, and the remaining 8 were still receiving ECMO as well as other supportive therapies. The duration of severe hypoxemia was usually 7 to 10 days, after which the patients gradually recovered with regard to arterial oxygenation and could be weaned from ECMO or mechanical ventilation.",

            "text": "Whether antiviral therapy for influenza can improve clinical outcome of the disease is a question of substantial importance to health care workers and public health decision makers [11] . In a meta-analysis of 90 observational studies involving 34 895 patients of whom 85% had laboratoryconfirmed 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1), Muthuri and coworkers found that antiviral therapy, principally oseltamivir, initiated within 48 hours after symptom onset significantly reduced mortality by 62% (early vs late treatment) and 65% (early treatment vs none), respectively [12] . With regard to avian influenza A (H7N9), both viral sequence data and virus susceptibility testing indicated antiviral resistance to adamantanes and susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) [1, 2] . Our preliminary data showed that the median time interval from symptom onset to antiviral therapy was 6 days. Moreover, none of the 6 patients receiving NAI within 72 hours after symptom onset died, whereas 14 of 60 patients who received late or no NAI treatment died as of April 23. All these suggested the beneficial effect of early antiviral therapy to improve clinical outcome in H7N9 infections. Unfortunately, rapid influenza diagnostic test failed to serve as an effective screening test because of its low to moderate sensitivit7y (10%-70%) [13] . We therefore believe that, in adults hospitalized with an influenza-like illness, the presence of live poultry exposure or travel history to the affected areas, in combination with otherwise unexplained relative lymphopenia, constitutes the diagnosis and merits prompt early antiviral therapy even without laboratory confirmation.",
