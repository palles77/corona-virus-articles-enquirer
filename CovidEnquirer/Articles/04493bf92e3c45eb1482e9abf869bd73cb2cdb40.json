            "text": "Outbreaks of SARS-CoV, influenza A (H5N1, H1N1) and measles viruses in recent years have raised serious concerns about the measures available to control emerging and re-emerging infectious viral diseases. Effective antiviral agents are lacking that specifically target RNA viruses such as measles, SARS-CoV and influenza H5N1 viruses, and available vaccinations have demonstrated variable efficacy. Therefore, the development of novel antiviral agents is needed to close the vaccination gap and silence outbreaks. We previously indentified mucroporin, a cationic host defense peptide from scorpion venom, which can effectively inhibit standard bacteria. The optimized mucroporin-M1 can inhibit gram-positive bacteria at low concentrations and antibiotic-resistant pathogens. In this investigation, we further tested mucroporin and the optimized mucroporin-M1 for their antiviral activity. Surprisingly, we found that the antiviral activities of mucroporin-M1 against measles, SARS-CoV and influenza H5N1 viruses were notably increased with an EC 50 of 7.15 g/ml (3.52 M) and a CC 50 of 70.46 g/ml (34.70 M) against measles virus, an EC 50 of 14.46 g/ml (7.12 M) against SARS-CoV and an EC 50 of 2.10 g/ml (1.03 M) against H5N1, while the original peptide mucroporin showed no antiviral activity against any of these three viruses. The inhibition model could be via a direct interaction with the virus envelope, thereby decreasing the infectivity of virus. This report provides evidence that host defense peptides from scorpion venom can be modified for antiviral activity by rational design and represents a practical approach for developing broad-spectrum antiviral agents, especially against RNA viruses.",

            "text": "Rapidly changing global landscapes and local environments, enormous increases in the human population and urbanization in many developing countries, and the advances in the speed and volume of global transportation have created increased opportunities for the emergence and re-emergence of viral diseases. Viruses with RNA as their genetic material can quickly adapt to and exploit these various conditions because of their high genetic variation rates (mutation, recombination and reassortment). Not surprisingly, many prominent recent examples of emerging or re-emerging diseases have been caused by RNA viruses, such as SARS-Coronavirus, H5N1 avian influenza viruses, H1N1, HIV, Han-tavirus, and West Nile virus [10] [11] [12] 15, 21, 23, 32] . Outbreaks of measles continue, and it is still the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide, despite the availability of live attenuated vaccines for more than 30 years [2, 6] . Effective antiviral agents are lacking that specifically target RNA viruses such as measles, SARS-CoV and influenza H5N1. The current available therapies used in the clinic for measles virus infection treatment, which is administered orally or intravenously alone or in combination with immune serum globulin, have demonstrated variable efficacies and side effects such as high teratogenicity and anemia [2, 30, 31] . Many other strategies, such as antisense molecules, adenosine and guanosine nucleosides, brassinosteroids, coumarins, peptide inhibitors, and modulators of cholesterol synthesis, have also failed [2, 25, 26] . Moreover, approved or universally recommended therapies have been lacking for SARS-CoV and influenza H5N1 infections until now, even though more and more antiviral agents against SARS-CoV and influenza H5N1 have been reported [8, 17, 24] . Therefore, the development of new antiviral agents is needed to provide more options for managing cases of diseases caused by RNA viruses in both developed and developing countries.",

We found that mucroporin can effectively inhibit standard bacteria, especially gram-positive bacteria. The optimized design of mucroporin-M1 by amino acid substitution resulted in inhibition of gram-positive bacteria at low concentrations and increased inhibition of antibiotic-resistant pathogens [9] . Recently, we also found a novel \u2423-helical peptide Hp1090 from scorpion venom can inhibit HCV replication and prevents the initiation of HCV infection [33] . In this investigation, we tested mucroporin and its optimized peptide variant mucroporin-M1 for other bioactivities including antiviral function against measles, SARS-CoV and influenza H5N1 viruses. Surprisingly, we found that the virucidal activity of mucroporin-M1 was notably increased, whereas the original peptide mucroporin showed no virucidal activity at all. The results in this report indicate that scorpion venom-derived antimicrobial peptides are not only a natural resource for inhibiting antibiotic-resistant bacteria but also can be molecular templates for designing antiviral peptides and antiviral agents for measles, SARS, influenza and other emerging or re-emerging RNA viral diseases.",

            "text": "Despite vaccination, measles remains a burden in both developed and developing countries. Currently used antiviral treatments for MeV infections are limited to ribavirin and/or immune serum globulin [4, 27] , which show variable efficacy against different MeV strains. Furthermore, the IC 50 value of ribavirin varies from 40 to 500 M in vitro [3, 14] , and therapeutic use of ribavirin is also limited by its side effect such as anemia [2] . Development of novel antiviral agents is needed to close the vaccination gap and treat increasing outbreaks, which urged us to test our scorpion venomderived peptides for anti-MeV activity and more. In previous work, we isolated different kinds of cationic antimicrobial peptides from a cDNA library of the venomous gland of scorpion and identified their potent growth-inhibitory activity against antibiotic-resistant gram-positive pathogens [9, 18] . Mucroporin is the first cationic host defense peptide that has been isolated from the venom of the scorpion Lychas mucronatus; we recently cloned it and demonstrated its specific effects on inhibiting bacteria [9] . We found that mucroporin can effectively inhibit standard bacteria, especially gram-positive bacteria. Moreover, the mucroporin-M1 optimized by amino acid substitution resulted in inhibition of gram-positive bacteria at low concentrations and inhibition of antibiotic-resistant pathogens [9] . The main aim of this investigation was to further test mucroporin and mucroporin-M1 for their anti-viral activity. We found that the anti-MeV activity of mucroporin-M1 was notably increased by the molecular modifications, while the original peptide mucroporin showed no anti-MeV activity at all. In the optimized modification, the Glycine and Proline residues of mucroporin were replaced with Lysine or Arginine, thereby enhancing the net positive charge of the hydrophilic side and changing the secondary structure of the peptide. The modifications enabled the peptide to interact directly with MeV particles with increased affinity (Fig. 5) . The anti-MeV activity of mucroporin-M1 presented an EC 50 value of 7.15 g/ml (3.52 M), while the original peptide mucroporin showed no anti-MeV activity at all. Moreover, we found that mucroporin-M1 could also inactivate two other enveloped RNA viruses: SARS CoV, with an EC 50 of 14.46 g/ml (7.12 M), and influenza H5N1, with an EC 50 of 2.10 g/ml (1.03 M). Although the selective indexes (SI) of mucroporin-M1 to SARS-CoV and H5N1 pseudoviruses shows big diversity (4.26 and 39.69, respectively), our results provide evidence that host defense peptides from scorpion can be modified for antiviral activity by rational design and represent a template approach for developing broad-spectrum antiviral agents.",

A peptide produced by Enterococcus mundtii ST4V isolated from soya beans showed very broad-spectrum of antiviral activities against herpes simplex viruses HSV-1 and HSV-2, polio virus and measles virus in addition to its anti-bacterial activities [29] . More natural resources should be screened for their potential antiviral activity. Scorpion venom is a cocktail of peptides and proteins with a diversity of special bioactivities, thus representing an unexplored resource for use in drug design and development [18, 22, 37] . We believe scorpion venom is also a valuable resource for antiviral drug development and tried testing mucroporin-M1 and its original molecular template mucroporin for their anti-MeV activity.

When the Glycine and Proline residues of mucroporin were replaced with Lysine or Arginine, which resulted in mucroporin-M1 with a more net positive charge of the hydrophilic side, mucroporin-M1 could inactivate MeV effectively. Inactivation of MeV was enhanced as the concentrations and treated time of mucroporin-M1 increased, revealing that the mechanism of action of mucroporin-M1 is at least partly due to direct interaction with the measles virus surface. Further studies on the relationship between peptide inhibition and the MeV replication cycle suggest that once the viral attachment step achieved, the peptide is unable to interfere with the following steps of virus replication. Experiments testing various treatment times and orders of addition of mucroporin-M1 revealed that MeV treatment with mucroporin-M1 by mixing together and incubating for 1 h in advance of infecting cells showed the most effective inhibition. Taken together, we speculate that mucroporin-M1 inhibits MeV, SARS-CoV and influenza H5N1 by direct virucidal action. Mucroporin-M1 may bind to the virus envelope by surface charge interactions and drastically decrease the infectivity of the above three viruses. However, mucroporin has no inhibitory activity against vaccinia virus, an enveloped DNA virus (data not shown). Therefore, whether the mucroporin-M1 functions against the viral surface protein, or just surface lipid, or both need to be investigated further.",

Vero cell monolayers in 24-well plates were infected with MeV and then were treated with 20 g/ml of mucroporin-M1 at different time intervals of 0-12 h, 12-24 h, 24-36 h, and 36-48 h p.i. Infected monolayers without peptide treatment were used as controls. At 48 h p.i., the infected cells were harvested, and the yields of MeV were analyzed by plaque assay. (B) The inactivating effect by different treatments of mucroporin-M1 on MeV. Group 1, Vero cells were pretreated with mucroporin-M1 and then infected with MeV; Group 2, MeV and mucroporin-M1 were mixed and incubated for 1 h, and then the mixture was inoculated in Vero cells; Group 3, MeV and mucroporin-M1 were mixed but without incubation and the mixture was inoculated in Vero cells immediately; Group 4, Vero cells were infected with MeV and then treated with mucroporin-M1; and Group 5, Vero cells were infected with MeV but without mucroporin-M1 as a control.
