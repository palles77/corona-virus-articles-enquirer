The first outbreak of SARS in Toronto occurred in late March 2003 (hereafter referred to as SARS 1).12-14 A second outbreak occurred in late May 2003 (hereafter referred to as SARS 2). Both Toronto outbreaks were determined to be nosocomial, mostly limited to hospital exposures. Both resulted in the closure of some hospitals to protect patients, physicians, nurses, and other hospital workers from SARS, and to prevent the outbreak from becoming an epidemic. During SARS 2, 4 hospitals in Toronto were directed by the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care to form a SARS Alliance and to dedicate specific wards and intensive care units (ICUs) to SARS patients. North York General Hospital (NYGH) was one such hospital. Indeed, the SARS patient volume and rapidly expanded SARS wards and ICU quickly transformed NYGH into the facility with the largest exposure to, and experience with, SARS in North America.",

Such measures were based on Health Canada reports of healthcare infections following intubation of a SARS patient. 14,16",

Although no experience in an obstetrical patient has been described, the nosocomial basis of spread ofSARSlO,12-14 is a potentially serious problem for health-care workers. The potential for public exposure to the disease, particularly through the sick and hospitalized patient, makes it a significant public health problem. An explosive infectious disease outbreak, such as that exhibited by SARS 1 and SARS 2 in Toronto, calls for decisive monitoring of the local patterns of disease spread. In taking measures for the control of such a disease, the obstetrician should collaborate with infectious diseases practitioners, public health workers, and medical program leaders of their hospital and those of nearby health-care institutions. SARS presented opportunities for research into \"Best Practice\" scenarios, which should result in a better understanding of the effects of the acute viral illness and its treatment on the mother and her baby. The lessons learned from SARS 1 and SARS 2 will introduce significant changes to how medicine is practised worldwide.",
