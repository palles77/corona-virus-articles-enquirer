            "text": "Rationale: HSV is one of the most widespread human viral pathogens. HSV-1 infects a large portion of the human population and causes severe diseases. The current clinical treatment for HSV-1 is based on nucleoside analogues, the use of which is limited due to drug resistance, side effects and poor bioavailability. AMPs have been identified as potential antiviral agents that may overcome these limitations. Therefore, we screened anti-HSV-1 peptides from a scorpion-derived AMP library and engineered one candidate into a histidine-rich peptide with significantly improved antiviral activity and development potential. Methods: A venomous gland cDNA library was constructed from the scorpion Euscorpiops validus in the Yunnan Province of China. Six putative AMPs were characterized from this cDNA library, and the synthesized peptides were screened via plaque-forming assays to determine their virucidal potential. Time of addition experiments according to the infection progress of HSV-1 were used to identify the modes of action for peptides of interest. The histidine-rich modification was designed based on structural analysis of peptides by a helical wheel model and CD spectroscopy. Peptide cellular uptake and distribution were measured by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy, respectively. Results: The peptide Eval418 was found to have high clearance activity in an HSV-1 plaque reduction assay. Eval418 exhibited dose-dependent and time-dependent inactivation of HSV-1 and dose-dependent inhibition of HSV-1 attachment to host cells. However, Eval418 scarcely suppressed an established HSV-1 infection due to poor cellular uptake. We further designed and modified Eval418 into four histidine-rich derivative peptides with enhanced antiviral activities and lower cytotoxicities. All of the derivative peptides suppressed established HSV-1 infections. One of these peptides, Eval418-FH5, not only had strong viral inactivation activity and enhanced attachment inhibitory activity but also had high inhibitory activity against intracellular HSV-1, which was consistent with its improved intracellular uptake and distribution as confirmed by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Conclusion: We successfully identified an anti-HSV-1 peptide, Eval418, from a scorpion venom peptide library and designed a histidine-rich Eval418 derivative with significantly improved potential for further development as an anti-HSV-1 drug. This successful modification can provide a design strategy to improve the bioavailability, cellular distribution and antiviral activity of peptide agents.",

Humans are the only natural hosts of HSV, and HSV infection is almost exclusively limited to epithelial cells and peripheral nervous system (PNS) neurons [2] . HSV can cause diseases ranging from mild conditions to lethal infections, including mucocutaneous lesions in labialis and skin, herpes keratitis and herpes encephalitis [3] . Most of the licensed treatments are based on nucleoside analogues such as acyclovir, valacyclovir and famciclovir. However, current treatments are unable to prevent establishment of latency and reactivation of latent virus [4] . Due to the drug resistance, side effects, and poor bioavailability associated with current treatments and the lack of an effective HSV-1 vaccine, the discovery and development of novel anti-HSV-1 agents are still urgent.",

For the sake of predation and survival, they have evolved unique venom systems containing neurotoxins, antimicrobial peptides, enzymes and other components. Natural AMPs from scorpion venoms and their derivative peptides have exhibited attractive antiviral activities, and some of these peptides have been studied in previous reports. The recombinant peptide scorpine (RScp) has been reported to inhibit Dengue-2 replication in C6/36 cells [11] . A natural amphipathic \u03b1-helical peptide Hp1090 can directly interact with the HCV viral envelope and decrease viral infectivity [12] . The scorpion venom-derived synthetic peptide mucroporin-M1 exhibited virucidal activities against measles, SARS-CoV and influenza H5N1 viruses via a direct interaction with virus envelope [13] . Mucroporin-M1 also inhibited HBV replication in vitro and in vivo by activating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and then reducing the expression of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4\u03b1 (HNF4\u03b1) [14] . Kn2-7, a scorpion venom peptide derivative, can inhibit HIV-1 by direct interactions with viral particles [15] . Histidine-rich mutants of another scorpion-derived peptide, Ctry2459, showed significantly enhanced bioavailability and anti-HCV activity [16] . Two scorpion venom peptides, Hp1036 and Hp1239, inhibited HSV-1 [17] . Recently, a scorpion defensin, BmKDfsin4, was reported to inhibit HBV replication in vitro [18] . Thus, the scorpion-derived AMP library is a rich source of new antiviral agents that are still awaiting further utilization.",

Eval418 disrupted the initial steps of infection but hardly suppressed an established HSV-1 infection, which was speculated to be a result of its poor cellular uptake. Since introducing histidine residues can improve peptide helicity and amphiphilicity, we attempted to modify Eval418 into four histidine-rich derivative peptides to improve its cellular uptake, intracellular distribution and subsequently, its antiviral activity. The helicities and amphiphilicities of the peptides were characterized by circular dichroism (CD). Anti-HSV-1 experiments showed that the modified peptides exhibited greater inhibition of HSV-1 than did the parent peptide. Especially, the modified peptide Eval418-FH5 exerted the lowest cytotoxicity and highest anti-HSV-1 activity. The results of confocal microscopy and flow cytometry analyses also revealed that Eval418-FH5 had enhanced cellular uptake and a dispersed cellular distribution.",

HSV-1 or Vero cells were incubated with Eval418 at 10 \u03bcg/mL for different periods of time, and the inhibitory effects were measured by PRA ( Figure  4a ). After pre-incubation with HSV-1 or following addition to the cells during the attachment step of HSV-1, Eval418 exhibited potent inhibition of plaque formation, suggesting an initial inhibitory activity against HSV-1 infection. On the contrary, Eval418 scarcely reduced plaque quantity when pre-incubated with Vero cells or added to cells after infection and showed a weak inhibition against viral entry. These results suggested that Eval418 only exerted a viral inactivation effect and prevented initiation of HSV-1 infection but did not affect intracellular anti-HSV-1 activity. (c) Time-dependent inactivation activity of the Eval418 peptide. HSV-1 (60 PFU/well) was directly incubated with the Eval418 peptide over serial durations, and the mixture was applied to a plaque reduction assay on Vero cells.

Eval418 was added to the cell culture medium at a series of concentrations simultaneously with HSV-1 at the viral attachment step and rinsed out before viral entry. Then, the inhibitory effect was measured by plaque reduction assay. (e) The inhibitory activity of the Eval418 peptide against HSV-1 at the viral entry step. After viral attachment, Eval418 was added and co-incubated with cells during the viral entry step. The inhibitory effect was then measured by plaque reduction assay. (f) Cellular localization of the Eval418 peptide in Vero cells. Eval418 was labeled by FITC, and the cellular localization of Eval418 was determined by confocal microscopy after incubation for 24 h with Vero cells. Scale bars: 10 \u00b5M. Figure 4b , HSV-1 was incubated with Eval418 over a series of concentrations, and the mixture was then used to infect Vero cells. The data from PRA experiments showed that plaque formation was inhibited by Eval418 in a dose-dependent manner and that the 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) was 2.48 \u03bcg/mL. The viral inactivation effect of Eval418 was also time-dependent at 10 \u03bcg/mL (Figure 4c ). When treated with Eval418 for 5 min, the PFU of HSV-1 decreased by 20%, suggesting a rapid-onset inactivation. After treatment with Eval418 for 15 min, the average reduction increased to 67.87%. The reduction was more than 90% after 30 min and almost 100% following Eval418 treatment for 1 h.",

            "text": "In the past decades, many antiviral peptides have been discovered or designed, and most have exerted potential virucidal activities. However, the greatest difficulty in treating viral diseases is the clearance of established infection in most natural and clinical conditions. However, the lipophilic muramyl peptide MTP-PE has been reported as a potent inhibitor of HIV replication in macrophages [23] . NP-1, a rabbit \u03b1-defensin, can simultaneously prevent the entry and intercellular spread of HSV-2 [24] . The derivative virucidal peptide, C5A, exhibits antiviral activities against HCV, HIV-1 and HSV-1 by disturbing viral membranes. In addition, C5A can block viral entry and suppress established infection [25] [26] [27] . Our group also has completed several studies of antiviral peptides that can inhibit established viral infection. Anti-HBV experiments demonstrated that a scorpion-derived short linear peptide, mucroporin-M1, can inhibit HBV replication in vitro and in vivo by activating the MAPK pathway and down-regulating HNF4\u03b1 expression [14] . Designed histidine-rich peptides from the template of the scorpion venom peptide Ctry2459 showed considerable inhibition against HCV RNA when added at 4 h, 24 h and 48 h after infection [16] . The scorpion defensin BmKDfsin4 can inhibit HBV replication in vitro [18] and also showed ion-channel blocking activity and antibacterial activity in another study by us [28] .",

The cytotoxicity and hemolysis activity of Eval418 were further tested, and the results showed that Eval418 is minimally toxic at a concentration of 10 \u03bcg/mL.

For example, addition of D-amino acids [29, 30] or fluorinated amino acids [31] may enhance peptide transmembrane delivery. The presence of lysosomotropic agents or introduction of histidine residues can enhance the transfection efficiencies of vehicle peptides as well as AMP cellular uptake and antiviral ability [16, [32] [33] [34] . In a previous study from our group, a glycine residue and a proline residue of the scorpion venom derived peptide mucroporin were replaced with a lysine residue and an arginine residue, respectively, to enhance the net positive charge of the hydrophilic side of the molecule. After the modifications, mucroporin-M1 exhibited a stronger virucidal activity and additional inhibition of HBV replication in vitro and in vivo [13, 14] . Ctry2459, another scorpion-derived peptide from the scorpion C. tryznai, has been modified into 2 histidine-rich mutant peptides to overcome the barriers of cellular uptake and endosome escape. These modifications significantly enhanced the anti-HCV activities and cellular uptake and introduced inhibition of established viral infection [16] .",
