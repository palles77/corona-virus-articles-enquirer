            "text": "Nervilia fordii (Hance) Schltr. has been widely used as a medicinal and edible herb in Southwest China and Southeast Asia. In this study, NFP-1, a new water-soluble polysaccharidewith a purity of 97.8%, was purified from water extract of Nervilia fordii by DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex G-100 chromatography. NFP-1 has a relative molecular weight of 950 kDa determined by high performance gel-permeation chromatography (HPGPC). Its monosaccharide compositions were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) after pre-column derivatizing its hydrolysate with 1-phenyl-3-methyl-5-pyrazolone (PMP). NFP-1 mainly consists of galactose, arabinose, rhamnose, and galacturonic acid. Based on FT-IR, methylation and GC-MS analysis, and NMR, the structure unit of NFP-1 was established as \u21924)-\u03b1-Rhap-(2\u2192 4)-\u03b1-GalpA-(1\u21922)-\u03b1-Rhap-(1\u21922)-\u03b1-Rhap-(4\u21921)-\u03b2-Galp-T containing two branch chains of \u21922,4)-\u03b1-Rhap-(1\u21925)-\u03b1-Araf-(1\u21923)-\u03b1-Araf-(1\u2192, and \u21922,4)-\u03b1-Rhap-(1\u21924)-\u03b2-Galp-(1\u2192. The immunomodulatory assays revealed the dual-functionalities of NFP-1. NFP-1 could significantly induce the secretion of nitric oxide (NO), and promote the secretions of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2 in RAW264.7 macrophages. NFP-1 could also significantly inhibit the production of NO, depress the secretions of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 in RAW264.7 macrophages activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and promote the production of IL-10 meanwhile. Our study suggested that Nervilia fordii could be an ideal medicinal or functional food due to its dual immunomodulatory activities.",

During SARS epidemic period, it showed that the decoctions of traditional Chinese herbs could significantly alleviate SARS symptoms in clinic [3, 4, [6] [7] [8] . Thus, we have been studying the phytochemicals and pharmacological activities of Nervilia fordii since 2009 [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Modern pharmacological studies demonstrated that Nervilia fordii has antitumor, antiviral, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory activities [14] [15] [16] [17] . In our previous work, we found that the flavonoids and polysaccharides are two main constituents in Nervilia fordii which display compelling anti-inflammatory activities [10, 11, 13] .",

The level of pro-inflammatory mediators releasing from RAW264.7 macrophages activated by LPS (1 \u03bcg/mL), including TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, IL-10, and NO, were dramatically increased as compared to those of control-group (P b 0.01, Fig. 8 ). Thereafter, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2 and the radical NO releasing from LPS-activated RAW264.7 macrophages which have been treated with NFP-1 of different concentrations were significantly decreased as compared to those of LPS-vehicle group (Fig. 8A , B, C, E). It was worthy to be noted that IL-10 releasing from LPS-activated RAW264.7 macrophages which have been treated with NFP-1 of different concentrations were assuredly promoted as compared to that of LPS-vehicle group (Fig. 8D) . It is well known that IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine which can predominantly inhibit LPS mediated induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 [45, 46] .

Botanical polysaccharides could induce a variety of immune responses in macrophages, such as promoting the proliferation, inducing the production of NO, promoting the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Activated macrophages play an important role in the occurrence and development of inflammation disease. However, the pro-inflammatory mediators cascade would break out when macrophages were excessively activated by the severe infection, such as bacteria and viruses [49] . In vitro studies have demonstrated that NFP-1 could modulate the immune responses in macrophages with or without LPS. Therefore, it was considered that NFP-1 possessed dual function in immunomodulatory.",
