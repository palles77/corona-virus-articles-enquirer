The ages of patients ranged from 10 to 86 years (median = 55 years), and the incidence of SFTS increased with age. The female:male ratio of cases was 1.008:1, and 54.6% (77/141) and 1.4% (2/141) of the cases were confirmed by qPCR to be SFTSV and Hantavirus (HV) infection, respectively. No case of simultaneous infection with two or more pathogens was found. The research in this paper showed that some suspected SFTS cases are confused with HV infection due to similar symptoms. The analysis showed that the distribution of SFTSV has a marked regional aggregation in Hubei province.",

In March 2011, a new virus was isolated from a patient's blood by the Chinese CDC and named SFTS bunyavirus (SFTSV) (Li, 2011) . An aetiological investigation of the disease was undertaken by the Hubei CDC. According to the above clinical characteristics and case definition, surveillance for SFTS was initiated in Hubei province. To evaluate the aetiology and epidemiology of SFTS, enhanced surveillance of acute febrile illness was carried out in Hubei province in 2011.",

Moreover, no evidence of HGA and Brucella infection was found in these patients. These results suggest that some cases with the symptoms of SFTS may be caused by HV; therefore, the underlying cause of SFTS should be diagnosed and interpreted with caution.",

            "text": "Following the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003, the Chinese government has focused on establishing an infectious disease surveillance and reporting system to facilitate identification of both known and unknown diseases. Among the 17 prefectural-level cities in Hubei province, 13 (including 29 counties and districts) reported SFTS cases. An investigation was performed to identify whether SFTS was caused by other pathogens. The clinical symptoms resembled those of human anaplasmosis, Brucellosis, and hemorrhagic fever (HFRS). Neither the specific nucleotide nor antibodies against those pathogens could be detected in blood samples from a majority of the patients. Instead, SFTSV and Hantavirus (HV) were detected from patients' blood. Because most SFTS cases in Hubei province were SFTSV infections, with few being HV and none being HGA, SFTSV was the major aetiological agent of SFTS in Hubei Province. However, the few cases of HV suggested that some suspected SFTS cases are confused with HV infection due to similar symptoms. There is no significant difference in the clinical symptoms between those patients with confirmed HV infection and those with confirmed SFTSV infection, but there are significant differences in clinical symptoms between laboratory-confirmed and unconfirmed cases (X 2 = 12.45, p < 0.001). Differences in symptoms between laboratory-confirmed SFTSV tests are thrombocytopenia (100%) and leukopenia (100%), and laboratory-unconfirmed SFTSV tests were 53% and 38%, respectively (Table 2 ). These results are helpful for accurately diagnosing SFTS.",

Reports from Henan province in China showed that only 8% of SFTS cases had evidence of HGA (Xu et al., 2011) . Infection with Anaplasma phagocytophilum has been suggested as a cause, but the pathogen was not detected in laboratory testing of the majority of patients in 2011 in Hubei province. This suggests that SFTSV may cause subclinical infections in children and adults. Moreover, the cytopathic effects of SFTSV were modest in Vero cells, rendering detection problematic. Therefore, the distribution of SFTSV and HGA infections in Hubei p rovince should be investigated further.",
