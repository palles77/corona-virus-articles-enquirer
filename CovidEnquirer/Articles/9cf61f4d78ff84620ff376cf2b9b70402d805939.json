The difficulty in differentiating between bacterial and viral pneumonia often leads to unnecessary antibiotic use. Current guidelines by the Pediatrics Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend amoxicillin (90 mg/kg/d orally in 2 doses) as the primary therapy for presumed bacterial pneumonia and azithromycin (10 mg/kg on day 1, followed by 5 mg/kg once daily on days 2-5) as the primary therapy for presumed atypical pneumonia in children younger than 5 years or aged 5 years or older. For children aged 5 years or older with presumed bacterial CAP who do not have clinical, laboratory, or radiographic evidence that distinguish bacterial CAP from atypical CAP, PIDS/IDSA guidelines note that a macrolide can be added to the b-lactam antibiotic. Much of the pediatric CAP guidelines is based on evidence of poor to moderate quality, and there many gaps in the evidence remain.",

These problems affect the management of CAP, and lead to emergence of resistance as a result of overtreatment. Management decisions are complicated because there are few randomized controlled trials in children that evaluate different antibiotic therapies and treatment duration. Although guidelines exist, they are often based on poorquality evidence.",

In that case-control study of 865 children, RSV, PIV, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and influenza were significantly more common in hospitalized cases than control children, but rhinovirus, adenovirus, and coronavirus were not. The high occurrence of asymptomatic carriage, such as in up to a third of asymptomatic children harboring rhinovirus, complicates the frequent detection of these respiratory viruses [10] [11] [12] ; the causative nature of many respiratory viruses in pneumonia, particularly ones identified by sensitive new molecular diagnostics, remain unclear. However, rhinovirus identification has been associated with bronchiolitis, asthma, and wheezing. 13, 14 hMPV, isolated in 2001, 15 has been recovered in 3.8% to 8.3% of isolates of nasopharyngeal and throat specimens of hospitalized children or children with CAP. 16, 17 Human bocavirus, first described in 2005, has been detected in up to 19% of clinical samples, mainly in infants and young children 18 ; its detection in serum and stool suggests that the virus may cause systemic disease. 18 In 2007, WU and KI polyomaviruses were detected in the respiratory tract samples of adults and children, 19, 20 and subsequently shown to be present in respiratory secretions in patients with acute respiratory illness. 21, 22 Severe acquired respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus was the first novel coronavirus to be characterized among a succession of other novel coronaviruses that decade. [23] [24] [25] Using sensitive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, Dominguez and colleagues 26 detected coronavirus RNAs in 5% of pediatric respiratory specimens, and 41% of coronavirus-positive patients had evidence of a lower respiratory tract infection. Twenty-six percent of that group presented with vomiting or diarrhea, and 8% with meningoencephalitis or seizures, which suggests that coronavirus may have more systemic involvement than previously believed. Fungal pathogens such as Histoplasma, Coccidioides, Blastomyces, and Cryptococcus can cause pneumonia the immunocompromised patient population and may cause clinical illness in immunocompetent hosts, but usually not with the presentation of CAP. Blastomyces can cause prolonged fever and respiratory symptoms that mimic a prolonged CAP; however. Cryptococcus gattii, which can infect immunocompetent hosts, 27 has caused an increasing number of infections in the US Pacific Northwest since 2004 and has been detected in the southeastern United States. 28 The pathogen can cause cryptococcomas in the lungs, and in 1 report, 54% of infected patients had documented pneumonia. 27 Mycobacterium tuberculosis and nontuberculous mycobacteria can likewise cause CAP, but tend to be limited to people with high-risk exposures. Similarly, other high-risk exposures suggest specific causes, as outlined in Table 2 .",

            "text": "Clinical features in children with CAP vary with the age of the child, although none of them is very specific. Cevey-Macherel and colleagues 2 showed that more than a fifth of patients diagnosed with CAP as defined by WHO guidelines had completely normal breath sounds on admission, and auscultation was ruled to be poorly sensitive and specific in diagnosing WHO guideline-defined CAP in young children. However, WHO guidelines rely solely on respiratory rate and, using other criteria for a diagnosis of pneumonia or lower respiratory tract infection, respiratory rate has been shown to be less sensitive and specific in the first 3 days of illness. 31 In a study that defined pneumonia/lower respiratory tract infection as the presence of crepitations (crackles), wheeze, bronchial breathing, or chest radiograph (CXR) abnormalities, respiratory rates of less than 40 breaths/min were seen in 55% of children older than 35 months with a diagnosis of pneumonia. 32 Canadian guidelines regard oxygenation as a good indication of the severity of disease, 29 and oxygen saturation is recommended by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) as a guide for referral of care and further diagnostic testing. 33 Clinical features do not reliably distinguish between viral, bacterial, and atypical pneumonias. 34, 35 Pneumococcal pneumonia has been associated with a history of fever and breathlessness and signs of tachypnea, indrawing, and toxic appearance, but these features can be indistinguishable from staphylococcal pneumonia at the beginning of illness. Similarly, mycoplasma pneumonia has been associated with cough, chest pain, and wheezing, symptoms being worse than the signs, as well as nonrespiratory symptoms such as arthralgia and headache, but studies have not successfully distinguished viral and bacterial CAP or between types of CAP by clinical Approach to Common Bacterial Infections signs alone. 36, 37 In addition, many children with CAP have mixed bacterial and viral infections. Mycoplasma pneumonia is more common in children aged 5 years or younger, and is typically characterized by slow progression, sore throat, low-grade fever and cough developing over 3 to 5 days. Although some children have more abrupt onset of symptoms or higher fevers, this pattern may help to distinguish it from pneumococcal or staphylococcal pneumonia, and influence treatment decisions, because there are no rapid laboratory tests that allow clear distinction between classic bacterial and atypical pneumonia.",

CXRs in children, unlike in adults with pneumonia, may not show any abnormalities, especially if taken at the onset of illness. 38 Beyond providing radiographic evidence of opacification, the use of a CXR is limited and has not been shown to correlate with clinical signs 39 or to help differentiate bacterial from viral pneumonia. 40 A prospective study in Switzerland enrolling 99 patients found that only 79% of patients had radiographic consolidation, with poor correlation between radiographic findings and diminished breath sounds, and no association with severity or cause of pneumonia. 2 A prospective study in the United Kingdom by Clark and colleagues 41 showed that lobar CXR changes were not associated with severity. In a study from Brazil, upper lobe involvement was shown to have 84% specificity and 65% positive predictive value for severity in children aged 1 year or younger hospitalized with CAP. 42 Whereas IDSA guidelines support a posteroanterior (PA) and lateral CXR in patients with suspected or documented hypoxemia or significant respiratory distress, and in those who have failed an initial course of antibiotic therapy, BTS guidelines do not recommend that a lateral CXR should be performed routinely. 43 This recommendation was based on a retrospective study from the United States that indicated that a frontal CXR was 100% sensitive and specific for lobar consolidation but would underdiagnose nonlobar infiltrates in 15% of cases. The investigators considered the clinical implications to be unclear. However, patients hospitalized for management of CAP (Box 1) should have both PA and lateral CXRs, to ensure that all infiltrates are detected and to assess for pleural effusion. Follow-up CXRs are unnecessary in children who recover uneventfully from an episode of CAP, but should be obtained in children who do not improve clinically and in those with progressive symptoms or clinical deterioration after 48 to 72 hours of antibiotic therapy. 33, 43 Most patients with bacterial pneumonia present with a lobar infiltrate (Fig. 1) . Interstitial infiltrates can be found in bacterial as well as viral and atypical pneumonia. 35 Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia can have diffuse infiltrate radiologically out of proportion with clinical findings; lobar consolidation, atelectasis, nodular infiltration, and hilar adenopathy have also been described. Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia can present with round infiltrates (see Fig. 1B ), as can also be seen with other bacteria.",

Because age is the best predictor of cause of pediatric pneumonia, guidelines for treatment are typically categorized by age and suspected pathogens. 33 BTS guidelines recommend that children with a clear clinical diagnosis of pneumonia should receive antibiotics, given that bacterial and viral pneumonia cannot be reliably differentiated.

Atypical bacterial pathogens such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae are more prominent in school-aged children and older patients, and macrolide therapy is recommended for those with compatible findings, generally based on clinical findings. However, there are few high-quality data on the effectiveness of macrolide antibiotics in the treatment of children with Mycoplasma pneumonia, so the recommendation of treatment with a macrolide for this condition is listed as a weak recommendation in the PIDS/IDSA guidelines. 33 Bacterial-viral coinfections have been well documented to occur with influenza and Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and group A Streptococcus. 51 Hence, children with serious viral lower respiratory tract infections may still benefit from empiric therapy for bacterial agents. Adjunctive treatment with corticosteroids has been studied but has not shown proven benefit on outcomes. 52, 53 The summary PIDS/IDSA guidelines for CAP in children continue to recommend amoxicillin (90 mg/kg/d orally in 2 doses) as the primary therapy for presumed bacterial pneumonia and azithromycin (10 mg/kg on day 1, followed by 5 mg/kg once daily on days 2-5) as the primary therapy for presumed atypical pneumonia in children younger than 5 years or aged 5 years or older. For children aged 5 years or older with presumed bacterial CAP who do not have clinical, laboratory, or radiographic evidence to distinguish bacterial CAP from atypical CAP, PIDS/IDSA guidelines note that a macrolide can be added to the b-lactam antibiotic. 33 As noted earlier, there are no definitive clinical, laboratory, or radiographic findings that distinguish bacterial from atypical CAP, so the decision to use or add a macrolide remains based on an overall indication from the combined findings, rather than from a clearly defined set of criteria based on these findings.",
