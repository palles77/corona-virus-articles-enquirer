            "text": "Surveillance of infections is based on reporting cases of illness, often syndromic reporting of CNS or pulmonary infections among others, but unspecified brief febrile illnesses are rarely reported, even in pregnant women. In addition, assigning a possible diagnosis to syndromic surveillance requires suitable laboratory tests to be readily available for the causative agent and require a considerable laboratory capacity. During the first six months of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in West Africa, the weak diagnostic laboratory capacity in the affected countries was an important factor in the rapid spread of the outbreak. 9 As a result of intense international efforts, over 27 laboratories were established to provide rapid in-country testing for Ebola virus. These laboratories included both mobile and temporary laboratories equipped to do molecular diagnostic testing and several laboratories to provide local genomic sequencing of the virus to help in contact tracing. However, since the laboratories were mostly run by Non Governmental Organizations and volunteers from overseas public health laboratories, most of these efforts provided only a temporary solution, rather than a long-term sustainable solution. Furthermore these laboratories were focused on a single, known infection.",

The urgent need for new methods for diagnostics that are scalable, accurate and accessible were highlighted in the recent WHO report. 7 While the WHO has called for strengthening of national capabilities, most national public health reference laboratories, where they exist, do not have the equipment or expertise to identify unknown pathogens in clinical samples, or in many cases even to look for the many known pathogens that may be uncommon to their own geographical area.",

The call for upgrading national capacity in detecting and analyzing new or emerging pathogens is in principle correct, but it must be realized that the capacity to perform the required analysis looking for new, so far unknown pathogens, or known but unexpected pathogens and analyzing the vast amount of data from genomic studies, can at present be done in a very few places. As examples Nipah virus and SARS was identified by the CDC and MERS by the Erasmus Medical Center, Netherlands not national laboratories. [15] [16] [17] Except for a very limited number of countries, only academic centers have the capacity to perform this type of analysis. However academic centers are invariably funded by research grants and it is thus not certain that the appropriate samples will reach such laboratories and again not certain that the right analysis will be performed and in time -it has to fit into the research strategy and is thus haphazard.",

The international community must consider the longevity of their support.

Regional public health laboratory networks established by WHO AFRO and its Member States, along with their technical partners, undertake the reporting of these outbreaks. However much of sub-Saharan Africa have weak health systems, inadequate resources, and poor capacity to identify and respond quickly and effectively to disease outbreaks, making them very vulnerable to the devastating effects of most infectious diseases epidemics. The scale and overwhelming effects of the recent EVD epidemic in West Africa clearly demonstrates this. This situation is compounded by lack of preparedness and capacity to conduct comprehensive and wellcoordinated research in response to such disease threats.",
