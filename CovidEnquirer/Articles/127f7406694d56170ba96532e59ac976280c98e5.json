The recent experience with anthrax-laced letters is indicative of this, but what does that portend? Might there be a more spectacular event in our near future?

            "text": "Looking toward the future, it is clear that as the power of biological science and technology continues to grow, it will become increasingly possible that we may face an attack with a pathogen that has been deliberately engineered for increased virulence. This enhanced virulence could take the form of resistance to antibiotic drugs, increased infectiousness (pathogenicity), or a new virulent pathogen made by combining genes from more than one organism. Threats arising from deliberate human action are not the only dangers we confront because naturally occurring infectious diseases emerge or reemerge on a regular basis (Garrett, 1995) . Current examples of this include the emergence of bird flu due to H5N1 avian influenza virus and swine flu due to nH1N1, which led to a mild pandemic in 2009-2011 (see Fig. 14 .1). The pathogen emerged in 1997 and, in a 10-year period, was responsible for the culling of nearly 300 million birds and more than 200 associated human deaths. The disease emerged in Hong Kong but, in the course of 10 years, spread across Asia and into Africa and Europe. Most human deaths reported have come from Cambodia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam. There have been two likely small clusters of human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 virus, and it is possible that other such transmissions have occurred. It is also possible that the H5N1 virus, through genetic mutation or recombination with a human-adapted influenza virus, could become easily transmissible among people. Given the poor condition of public health systems in many underdeveloped regions and the speed of modern air travel, the consequences of such an event would be severe. However, biosecurity programs sponsored by the World Health Organization and its partners, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have managed to bring sufficient attention and resources to the problem that a pandemic may have been averted. When public health strategies and biosecurity programs are successful, it is hard to know just how far the problem may have gone without intervention. The world certainly did not benefit from such programs, modern day technologies, containment strategies, and surveillance infrastructure when the 1918 Spanish flu circled the globe, leaving an estimated 40 million people dead in its wake.",

Molecular genetics, genomic sequencing, and gene splicing therapies have dual-use potential. Paradoxically, the same biotechnology for developing a new drug or new vaccine may be used to develop more virulent biological weapons. As such, science that can be used to save lives may also be used to take lives (Ainscough, 2002) . An outbreak of a biologically engineered pathogen might have greater disease potential than recently discovered naturally emerging diseases. A terrorist attack with a biologically engineered agent may unfold unlike any previous event. The pathogen may be released covertly, so there will be a delay between exposure and onset of symptoms. Days to weeks later, when people do develop symptoms, they could immediately start spreading contagious diseases. By that time, many people will likely be hundreds of miles away from where they were originally exposed, possibly at multiple international sites. Acutely ill victims may present themselves in large numbers to emergency rooms and other medical treatment facilities (Ainscough, 2002) .",

The report they produced explored a wide range of possibilities open to genetically engineered pathogens, including some that could be achieved with current state-of-the-art techniques and others that would be realized in the near future. The prospects for future bioweaponry advanced by technology are sobering (Block, 1999) . In fact, technology over the past 20 years enabled scientists to engineer pathogens to be qualitatively different from conventional bioweapon agents. In terms of bioweaponry, this includes the ability to give these \"classic\" pathogens attributes that might make them safer to handle, more virulent, more transmissible, harder to detect, and easier to disseminate (Block, 1999) .",

These include binary bioweapons, which are two-component systems that are relatively safe to handle but become deadly when the two components come together on deployment. The same technology has been used with chemical weapon systems. The Jason Group also postulated the existence of designer genes, in which specific unnatural gene sequences are built into viruses or other life forms to incorporate into the genome of the unsuspecting host, which later becomes the victim. On a similar note, they suggested that, once gene therapy becomes a medical reality, the technology that should one day allow medicine to repair or replace defective genes in a diseased individual might be subverted to introduce pathogenic sequences into healthy individuals. In addition, stealth viruses could be fashioned by a researcher to infect the host but remain silent until activated by some physiological or environmental trigger. New zoonotic agents, referred to by the Jason Group as host-swapping diseases, might be developed specifically for bioweapon purposes by modifying existing pathogens to seek human hosts. Finally, detailed knowledge of biochemical signaling pathways could conceivably be used to create designer diseases.",

As discussed in chapter Seeds of Destruction, while the United States and her allies were dismantling their bioweapons programs in the 1970s, the Soviets, under Biopreparat, were assembling a huge bioweapons production capacity, comprising dozens of production facilities and as many as 60,000 personnel. This massive program aimed to build offensive capabilities by mass producing many of the Category A and B agents. More important, the Soviet bioweapons program also created research institutions with top secret goals and objectives to use biotechnology toward creating pathogens and toxins with superior capability. As we know now, the Soviets were producing Bacillus anthracis spores by the ton. We know that Soviet strains of B. anthracis were engineered to carry a form of antibiotic resistance; however, we did not know whether the North Atlantic Treaty Organization conventional anthrax vaccine was effective against all Soviet variants.

(An excerpt from the interview, entitled \"Creating 'Superbugs',\" can be accessed on the Internet; see NOVA, 2001.) In the interview, Popov admitted that the Soviets were producing synthetic genes to give microbes properties that they did not possess in nature. When Popov was asked by the interviewer \"What would be the point of that?\" he replied, \"Imagine a new weapon which is difficult to diagnose initially and then which is impossible to treat with conventional antibiotics.\" Popov explained that \"the idea was that a new weapon has to have new and unusual properties, difficult to recognize, difficult to treat.\" By his own admonition, the goal of his research program was to create a more deadly biological weapon. He briefly described the goal of Project Bonfire, which dealt with the creation and potential exploitation of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. Under Project Bonfire, the Soviets were able to produce a strain of Yersinia pestis that was shown to be resistant to almost 10 antibiotics. Furthermore, a recombinant strain of anthrax had resistance to 10 antibiotics. In the Hunter Program, Popov explained that whole genomes of different viruses were being combined together to produce completely new hybrid viruses. They wanted to combine two microorganisms in one (eg, a combination of encephalomyelitis virus and smallpox). This completely artificial agent would purportedly manifest as illness with new symptoms, probably with no known way to treat it. One might ask what would be the purpose and danger of this.

Popov explained the idea was to create a bacterial agent that harbored a virus. The virus would remain silent until the bacterial infection is treated. Therefore if the bacterial disease was recognized and treated with an antibiotic, there would be a release of virus. After the initial bacterial disease was completely cured, there would be an outbreak of a viral disease on top of this. According to Popov, a good example of this superbug model would be plague bacteria, which is relatively easy to treat with antibiotics, and viral encephalomyelitis inside. So, in case of biological attack, people would be treated against plague, and after that, the weakened host would manifest with a highly fatal infection affecting the brain and central nervous system. Remember that the encephalitides are normally transmitted by arthropod vectors, making them unlikely candidates and impractical for biowarfare. In the superbug model, the need for a vector is eliminated.

In fact, between 2008 and 2014 the US government invested more than $800 million dollars in synthetic biology research (HHS, 2014) . The Department of Defense, specifically within the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, has accounted for most of that funding. The Wilson Center completed a study in 2015 that shows that there has been very little focus on risk research with these monies. Indeed, less than 1% of the total US funding is focused on risk research and approximately 1% addresses ethical, legal, and social issues. The Wilson Center study also found that funding in other countries is rapidly increasing. In 2014 the United Kingdom and the European Commission investments in synthetic biology exceeded nondefense spending in the United States (Wilson Center, 2015) . In summary, synthetic biology is a promissory field of research and an emerging technology in need of governance.",

So what remains of the former Soviet arsenal and where are all of the seed stocks from the bioengineering efforts of Project Bonfire and the Hunter Program? Have deadly superbugs been sequestered for dark days ahead? Furthermore, what other countries have had and remain actively engaged in bioweapons production and research? The Office of the Secretary of Defense identified countries that maintain various levels of offensive biological warfare capabilities or research facilities. China, Iran, Israel, Libya, North Korea, Syria, and Taiwan are believed to have produced operational quantities of biological weapons (U.S. Congress, Office of Technology Assessment, 1993) . The Henry L. Stimson Center also identified Egypt, Israel, and Taiwan as countries of proliferation concern (Block, 1999) . The Al Qaeda network is reported to have sought to purchase biological agents, and some on-site reports suggest that their rudimentary laboratory facility at Tarnak Farm, Afghanistan, was being set up for biological and chemical agent production.",

Multiplex diagnostics possessing broad-spectrum activity rapidly differentiate various common and lesser-known pathogens in a single clinical sample, identify drug sensitivities, and determine how a sample pathogen is related to known pathogens. Consider the lab-on-a-chip concept, in which a clinical specimen is placed on a microchip-like device, which has a complex microarray of DNA-or ribonucleic acid (RNA)-based diagnostics. The chip allows the processing unit to test for dozens of possibilities simultaneously based on DNA-or RNA-hybridization modalities. Some exciting new developments along these lines have already occurred. Vaccines demonstrating broad-spectrum activity include cross-protective and multiple-component vaccines. Cross-protective vaccines induce an immune response against constant components of a microbe; therefore they are effective against pathogens that naturally or deliberately evolve or \"drift\". Figure 14 .3 A scientist in the process of transferring specimens in one of the Centers for Disease Control biosafety level-4 laboratories, located in Atlanta, Georgia. The scientist wears a protective airtight suit equipped with a helmet and face mask. She is seated at a negatively pressurized laminar flow hood that allows no air flow to escape back into the laboratory environment. Using this negatively pressurized, hooded environment, any airborne pathogens or toxic vapors are drawn back into the hooded container and up into a filtered ventilation system, thereby avoiding the spread of contaminants through the laboratory. Although these facilities are very costly to staff and maintain, they are vital and give us the ability to investigate unknown threats and emerging diseases.

A limited number of antiinfectives with broad-spectrum activity directed at common, invariable, and essential components of different classes of microbes could be effective against traditional and nontraditional threats. This approach would allow a small number of drugs to replace dozens of pathogen-specific drugs. In addition, the strategies to overcome antibacterial resistance could extend the clinical utility of existing broad-spectrum anti-infectives and have immediate benefits. Treatments that target host immune responses have the potential to be effective against multiple diseases. These immune modulators reduce morbidity and mortality by controlling responses that contribute to disease (eg, cytokine storms) or nonspecifically activating the host's natural immune defenses to induce a faster, more potent protective response.",

Developing countermeasures that will be useful in responding to future threats represents a major challenge given the capabilities that these products must possess. They should be safe and effective against multiple pathogens in people of any age and health status. To be appropriate for storing in the Strategic National Stockpile, the products should be suitable for long-term storage at room temperature, have simple compact packaging, be easily delivered in a mass casualty setting, confer protection with limited dosing, and have single-dose delivery devices that can be self-administered. Added to these factors is the potential need to produce additional quantities with little notice, requiring manufacturers to take the costly step of keeping production facilities on standby. A recent example of this is the relatively rapid creation and production of a vaccine for H5N1 bird flu, which is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration with 5 million doses placed in the Strategic National Stockpile.",

Biological warfare and bioterrorism are multifaceted problems requiring multifaceted solutions (Block, 1999) . We need our best critical thinkers and biological researchers to solve this constantly evolving problem. Fortunately, the same advances in genomic biotechnologies that can be used to create bioweapons can also be used to set up countermeasures against them. The probability of a terrorist use of a genetically engineered biological agent on a given city is very low, but the consequence of such an event would obviously be very high. With maximum casualties the likely goals, metropolitan areas are most at risk for an attack. However, the indiscriminate nature of biological warfare and bioterrorism puts all communities at risk. This dilemma is the challenge of local communities, which are sensitive to the need for preparedness but have finite resources. Community officials must have a plan and sufficient medical and public health resources accessible to sustain a response for up to 24 h. Robust federal assistance would be made available promptly, but it would not be immediate. At present, all military and civilian populations throughout the world are vulnerable to a bioweapons attack. We remain grossly ill-prepared to respond to an epidemic caused by a novel genetically engineered biological agent.",

Acting responsibly, he put an end to our biological weapons arsenal and focused our assets on biodefense rather than biooffense. We now have in place sophisticated and well-developed biosecurity and biodefense programs. These programs are essential to countering the asymmetric warfare threat, but they are costly and perishable. Future directions in biosecurity and biodefense may very well be determined by the \"next event.\" However, it is this author's opinion that the most likely events are those that naturally and accidentally threaten human and animal health through the emergence of novel pathogens and the reemergence of others in light of new environmental or societal factors.",

            "text": "\u2022 Binary bioweapons. A two-component system consisting of innocuous parts that are mixed immediately before use to form the pathogen. This process occurs frequently in nature. Many pathogenic bacteria contain multiple plasmids (small, circular, extrachromosomal DNA fragments) that code for virulence or other special functions. Virulent plasmids can be transferred among different kinds of bacteria and often across species barriers (Block, 1999) . \u2022 Designer diseases. The possibility that science one day might allow a researcher to propose the symptoms of a hypothetical disease and then design or create the pathogen to produce the desired disease complex. Designer diseases may work by turning off the immune system; by inducing specific cells to multiply and divide rapidly (similar to cancer); or possibly by causing the opposite effect, such as initiating programmed cell death (apoptosis). This futuristic biotechnology would clearly indicate an order of magnitude of advancement in offensive biological warfare or terrorism capability (Block, 1999) . \u2022 Designer genes. The entire genomes of numerous organisms have been published in unclassified journals and on the Internet. Now that the codes are known, it seems only a matter of time until microbiologists develop synthetic genes, synthetic viruses, or even complete new organisms. Some of these could be specifically produced for biological warfare or terrorism purposes (Block, 1999) . \u2022 Gene therapy. Gene therapy will revolutionize the treatment of human genetic diseases. The goal is to effect a permanent change in the genetic composition of a person by repairing or replacing a faulty gene. The same technology could be subverted to insert pathogenic genes in a targeted host of population (Block, 1999) . \u2022 Host-swapping diseases. Viruses that \"jump species\" may occasionally cause significant disease. Manageable infectious agents can be transformed naturally into organisms with markedly increased virulence (Block, 1999) . \u2022 Stealth viruses. The concept of a stealth virus is a cryptic viral infection that covertly enters human cells (genomes) then remains dormant for an extended time. However, a signal by an external stimulus could later trigger the virus to activate and cause disease. In fact, this mechanism occurs fairly commonly in nature. For example, many humans carry herpes virus, which can activate to cause oral or genital lesions. Similarly, varicella virus sometimes reactivates in the form of herpes zoster (shingles) in some people who had chickenpox earlier in life. However, the vast majority of viruses do not cause disease (Block, 1999) . \u2022 Synthetic biology. Synthetic biology is an interdisciplinary branch of biology combining disciplines such as biotechnology, evolutionary biology, molecular biology, systems biology, biophysics, computer engineering, and genetic engineering.",
