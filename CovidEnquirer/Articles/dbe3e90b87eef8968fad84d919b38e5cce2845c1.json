Serum samples (1247) were taken from sows from 58 different herds for this purpose throughout 1988 and were tested by a monoclonal antibody-capture ELISA (MACELISA), a test which detects antibodies to both transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and PRCV. In order to discriminate positive sera to both coronaviruses, a blocking inhibition ELISA was used for all MACELISA-positive sera. By MACELISA, 31.4% of sera tested were positive and all of them were confirmed specifically as PRCV-positive by blocking inhibition ELISA, thus ruling out the presence of TGEV in the sampled area; 64% of the farms had at least one PRCV-seropositive sow, indicating that the infection was widespread Farms were classified into three categories, according to size and management practices. No significant differences were found in the prevalence rates among the three farm types; there was, however, a highly significant correlation between increasing farm size and increasing within-farm seropositivity.",

Martin et al., personal communication, 1992 ) . Many piglets are sent from Central Europe to these Spanish regions for fattening. Furthermore, at the time of our sampling, a TGE outbreak was diagnosed in the center of Spain, in a farm which had recently imported pigs from Belgium (Laviada et al., 1988 ) . The reasons why TGE does not seem to have spread to Castilla y Le6n remain obscure, but two facts could explain it: first, the entrance of TGEV infection by means of carrier pigs from other European countries seems unlikely, since piglets are rarely imported to Castilla y Le6n from other European countries; second, the diffusion of TGEV from other parts of Spain is also unlikely, since pig trade between Castilla y Le6n and other parts of Spain is mainly based on the export of piglets which are to be fattened in large intensive units located along the Mediterranean coast. On the other hand, the spread of PRCV seems to be much easier, since it is spread by airborne transmission (Wesley et al., 1990 ).",
