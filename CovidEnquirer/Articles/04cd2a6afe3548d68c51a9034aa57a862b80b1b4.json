A clinical diagnosis of CIRDC can typically be made with a history and physical examination; however, an etiologic diagnosis should be pursued in dogs with severe or prolonged clinical signs or in disease outbreak situations. Clinical signs of CIRDC are typically mild and self-limiting, resolving after approximately 1 week. Antimicrobial treatment is warranted in dogs suspected to have bacterial pneumonia and optimally should be directed based on bacterial culture and susceptibility results. The development of pneumonia should raise concern for underlying canine distemper virus infection or other underlying immunosuppressive disease. Vaccinations do not induce sterilizing immunity; therefore, more comprehensive prevention strategies are necessary, especially in group-housing situations.",

            "text": "B bronchiseptica is a worldwide cause of respiratory disease in dogs and also causes disease in other species, including cats, pigs, rabbits, and people. Different strains of this gram-negative coccobacilli likely vary in their host range and ability to cause disease, [18] [19] [20] and isolation of B bronchiseptica from apparently healthy dogs can occur. [21] [22] [23] [24] Transmission of B bronchiseptica is via the airborne route, and it is highly contagious. Once inhaled, the organisms adhere to the respiratory cilia by way of adhesion molecules (fimbrial adhesions, filamentous hemagglutinin, pertactin, and lipopolysaccharides). 6 The organisms can evade the host defenses using virulence factors, such as the outer capsule, or the O antigen, which protects the bacteria from phagocytosis and complement mediated attacks. 25 Other virulence factors have also been described, including type III secretion systems that allow for bacterial colonization, [26] [27] [28] adenylate cyclase toxin with anti-inflammatory and immune evasion properties, 29, 30 and exotoxins that cause necrosis of epithelial cells. 31 Once colonization has been established, altered respiratory epithelial cell function leads to excessive mucus secretion and further impairment of the local innate immune defenses, predisposing the host to infection by opportunistic secondary pathogens. The incubation period of B bronchiseptica ranges from 2 to 10 days. Clinical signs can vary dramatically. Mild upper-respiratory tract disease can lead to mucopurulent nasal discharge, sneezing, and a cough. In more severe disease cases that involve the lowerrespiratory tract, signs of systemic illness can be present, including lethargy, decreased appetite, fever, and a productive cough. The organism can be shed for at least 1 month, and in some cases, for several months. 32, 33 Mycoplasma cynos Many Mycoplasma spp are commensal organisms that colonize the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract, and their role in canine infectious respiratory disease is not clear. Mycoplasma spp are fastidious organisms that lack a cell wall, are the smallest known free-living organisms, and can be isolated from the lungs or trachea of about 25% of healthy adult dogs. 34 M cynos is the only Mycoplasma spp significantly associated with respiratory disease in dogs, 35 most commonly pneumonia. 36, 37 It is still unclear if M cynos is a primary or secondary pathogen in dogs, because it can be cultured from the lungs of dogs both with 34, 35 and without 35, 36 other identifiable infectious respiratory disease. Recently it was associated with lethal bronchopneumonia in a litter of golden retriever puppies 38 and a colony of laboratory beagles. 39 Experimental infection of dogs, by either endobronchial infection or exposure to infected dogs, results in development of clinical pneumonia, destruction and loss of respiratory cilia, and influx of neutrophils and macrophages into the alveolus. 37, 40 Younger dogs are more likely to be infected with this organism as compared with older dogs, and dogs become infected within the first 2 to 3 weeks upon entering an animal shelter. 35 M cynos can persist in the lung for up to 3 weeks following infection and be Canine Infectious Respiratory Disease transmitted via aerosols. 40 It is unknown how long the organism can persist in the environment. However, other Mycoplasma spp can survive for several weeks outside of the host; therefore, it should be assumed that M cynos can also persist in the environment.",

It is a commensal organism of the upper-respiratory tract of horses, but also can cause opportunistic infections, such as abscesses, and endometritis and can result in abortion. 41 Outbreaks of severe hemorrhagic pneumonia have been described in several populations of group-housed dogs in which S equi subsp zooepidemicus was identified as the causative agent. [42] [43] [44] A history of contact with horses has been identified in some, but not all infected dogs. 45 Rarely, S equi subsp zooepidemicus can be isolated from dogs without clinical signs. [42] [43] [44] Dogs initially have mild clinical signs, including a cough and nasal discharge; however, their clinical signs can rapidly progress within 24 to 48 hours of onset, resulting in development of severe acute fibrinosuppurative, necrotizing, and hemorrhagic bronchopneumonia. 46 The pathogenesis is not fully elucidated; however, bacterial exotoxin genes have been identified in S equi subsp zooepidemicus, and the course of clinical disease in dogs is similar to that of streptococcal exotoxin-induced toxic shock syndrome in people, in which an overzealous host immune response induces significant pathologic condition. 46, 47 Coinfection with other pathogens has been noted in some, but not all cases. In experimental models, coinfection of S equi subsp zooepidemicus with CIV (H3N8) resulted in severe clinical signs, whereas infection with S equi subsp zooepidemicus alone did not induce disease. 16 ",

Dogs that present with respiratory signs consistent with CIRD that also have GI signs, ocular discharge, neurologic signs, and/or an unknown vaccination history should be considered at high risk of having distemper.

The route of vaccine delivery for these pathogens and its impact on the immune response have been debated in the literature. Intranasal or intraoral vaccination has been recommended to improve mucosal immune responses and permit rapid onset of protection in overcrowded environments, such as shelters. However, mucosal vaccination can sometimes result in vaccine-induced disease, and it can be difficult to know whether disease in a shelter environment is secondary to the vaccine or natural infection. Concern has also been raised that intranasal vaccine strains of B bronchiseptica might be capable of causing human disease in the immunosuppressed, although molecular evidence of this is lacking. Vaccination with intranasal vaccines is followed by the development of low titers of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG), whereas serum IgG responses are higher after parenteral vaccination. 80 A recent study suggested that intranasal vaccination may provide greater clinical protection against challenge than oral vaccination. 81 Additional studies are warranted to further assess the optimal vaccine type for dogs. Parenteral vaccines are available for reduction of clinical signs owing to CIVs, including individual H3N8 or H3N2 vaccines and combination (bivalent) vaccines. 82, 83 No commercially available vaccines are available for reduction of clinical signs caused by CRCoV and CHV.",

In grouphousing situations, precautionary measures should include an isolation period for dogs entering the population, rigorous daily monitoring for development of clinical signs within the group, and quarantine protocols for dogs with clinical signs associated with CIRDC. Care should be taken to prevent overcrowding and stress within the population. If an outbreak does occur, facilities should have an infectious disease protocol in place to limit exposure to other dogs in the facility, isolating ill animals from the population at large and applying proper disinfection protocols. An attempt should be made to determine the etiologic agent so targeted prevention and treatment protocols can be instituted.",

Molecular techniques have led to discoveries of CIRDC pathogens that were not previously associated with the disease complex and highlighted the importance of coinfections in disease severity. With increased travel of dogs around the world, it is likely that novel pathogens will continue to emerge as CIV variants have in the past 2 decades. Because there are no specific therapies available for viral CIRDC pathogens, and available vaccines do not convey sterilizing immunity, prevention of infection is vital in group-housed dogs.",
