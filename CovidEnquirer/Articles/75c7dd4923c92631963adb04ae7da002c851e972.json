Mean wind flow around each building model and wind-induced flow inside re-entrant bays are computed. To determine the ventilation efficiency of the bay, the computed flow field is used to disperse a scalar pollutant initially occupying the entire bay at a uniform concentration. The subsequent time decay of pollutant concentration inside the bay is studied and the ventilation efficiency is quantified by the retention time. The results show that wind-induced flow inside the bay, especially on the building side face, is complex and highly three-dimensional. Air exchange rates through the roof opening and vertical side opening are analyzed for each bay and their relationship to the ventilation efficiency is discussed. The bays on the building side faces are much worse ventilated than those on the windward or leeward building face. The deeper the side bay, the worse is the air exchange and ventilation. The building height is found to have a governing effect on the ventilation of the windward and leeward re-entrant bays.",

Wind breezes are always desirable for cooling in warm weathers and for wind-induced dispersion of unwanted emissions from a building. For a low-rise house, wind can often be collected by large scale wide open features, like atriums or courtyards (Aldawoud and Clark, 2008; Rajapaksha et al., 2003; Sharples and Bensalem, 2001) . However these architectural features are not easily adopted by high-rise buildings. For high-rise multi-apartment residential buildings, which are increasing common in metropolitan cities, it is important to optimise between views and ventilation. In order to satisfy both requirements, these high-rise buildings often adopt an irregular cross-sectional shape with apartments arranged as wing sections extending from a central core. Between adjacent building wings are deeply recessed re-entrant bays (recessed cavities) or ''light-wells'' towards which kitchen and bathrooms windows open. Unwanted matters and heat are emitted into the re-entrant bays which do not occupy the most important views of the building.",

The wind loading study of Building Research Establishment (Cook, 1985) suggested that wind flowing around a building with recessed corners or re-entrant bays intends to skip past a narrow recessed bay and leave an almost stagnant flow inside it but details of flow information were not provided. Chow et al. (2002) carried out a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) study of wind flow around a building with a re-entrant bay installed at the mid-width of the building front face. They pointed out that at this normal incidence, some flow might come down the re-entrant bay from its roof opening face if there was no heat discharged into the bay.",

            "text": "In real-life situations, a poorly ventilated re-entrant bay can lead to disastrous consequences in the built environment. In 2003, Hong Kong experiences the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Crises with almost 300 people died (Yeoh, 2003) . Many victims lived in Amoy Garden, a group of high-rise multiapartment buildings. The first patient lived on the 16th floor of a 36-storey residential building. The level was about 1/3 times the building height (H) above its podium. After a very short period, there were more than 200 cases found in the same housing but there were no cases reported at a level below 9th floor (0.15H). A subsequent study by building and medical professionals in Hong Kong suggested that the SARS virus might be discharged from the bathroom of the infected unit and subsequently spread to the other rooms through air flow paths inside the re-entrant bay (Hong Kong Government, 2004) . The re-entrant bays of Amoy Garden buildings are deeply recessed into the building side walls, having a width-todepth (W/D) ratio of 0.25-0.33. According to Cook (1985) , flow inside these deep recessed bays is largely stagnated. And this stagnant flow condition would prolong a long-time residence of SARS viruses emitted into the bay and thus increasing the chance of their transmission into the connecting apartments through air exchange with the bay (Yu et al., 2004) . This event demonstrates the importance of wind-induced natural ventilation of re-entrant bays in buildings for dispersion of pollutants and matters. Other adverse consequences of poor natural ventilation of the re-entrant bays include increased risks of environmental health and fire safety of the building that may arise from poor dispersion of waste gases or fire smoke discharged into the bay. In warm regions, domestic air conditioners often have their air-cooled condensers installed inside the re-entrant bays and insufficient ventilation of the bays may lead to increase in energy consumption as a result of built up of condensing temperature.",

Two re-entrant bays are thus presented on two opposite walls of the building. The ''H'' shaped cross section has a square envelope of breadth B. Nine ''H'' shapes are studied and their configurations were shown in Table 1 . In these ''H'' shapes, the horizontal dimensions of the re-entrant bay vary in a systematic manner which covered three different widths; W/B\u00bc{0.25, 0.5, 0.75}, and three different depths: D/B\u00bc{0.125, 0.25, 0.375}. Flow over a square building with no re-entrant bay is also studied. Three groups of buildings with different building height; H/B\u00bc{4, 6, 8}, are studied. Including the control square buildings, wind flow over a total number of 30 buildings are computed in this study. In addition, computations are carried out for each building at two wind incidence angles. At wind angle 01, wind blows normally onto the building face with a re-entrant bay (Table 1) . At wind angle 901, the re-entrant bays are on the two side faces of the building.",

Three-dimensional (3D) flow simulations are carried out by ANSYS CFX at a reduced geometric scale of 1:300, which is also the scale of the accompanying wind tunnel tests. The computational domain has a width at 3 m and a height at 1.7 m. These values match the cross-sectional dimensions of the boundary layer wind tunnel of the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Hong Kong where some flow measurements around models of H-shaped tall buildings are carried out. The computational domain has a length of 6 m and the building model is located at 1 m downstream of the inlet plane of the domain. This means that there will be more than 1H distance upstream the building and at least 6H downstream distance between the building and the inlet or outlet plane. The 3D computational domain is discretized into unstructured tetrahedral elements with element sizes stretching progressively outwards from the building walls to the domain boundary walls (Fig. 1) . In regions far from the building, no element has a dimension greater than 0.1 m and mesh elements generated close to the building walls are refined to have a minimum dimension of 0.01 m so as to fulfil the application requirements of the wall functions. The numbers of computation elements range from 4 to 8 millions and this mesh resolution complies with the recommended requirements of AIJ (Tominaga et al., 2008) for computational wind flow studies of buildings.",

For the study of wind-induced flow through a refugee floor on an intermediate level of a tall building, the computed flow vectors have been compared to measured velocities in a wind tunnel model (Cheng et al., 2005) and the mean velocity components u/U H are repeated there in Fig. 2 . In the computation of pedestrian-level wind around a group of tall buildings (Lam and To, 2006) , extensive comparison has been made between computed and wind tunnel flow vectors. In the present study, some wind flow velocities around an H-shaped tall building model are measured in the wind tunnel with a 7-hole cobra probe (Aeroprobe Inc.) on the horizontal plane at midbuilding height. The probe can measure 3D velocity components for flow coming within a cone of 701 from its axis. In the measurement, the probe is aligned towards the approaching wind direction and reliable data are obtained in regions around the building. Fig. 3 shows a comparison of the computed and measured flow vectors for the 0.6 m tall building model with Case 2 re-entrant bays. The measured flow vectors show the separated wind flow from the building upwind corner. Accurate numerical reproduction of this separated flow is a challenge for RANS-based CFD. Imposing the measured turbulence intensity profile as a boundary condition is essential. It is observed in Fig. 3 that the computed flow vectors tend to over-predict slightly the size of the separation region but there is reasonable agreement between wind tunnel data and CFD results. The present wind flow simulations are performed on a 64bit quad-core computer and it takes about 6 h to complete one simulation. In terms of numerical accuracy, iterations are stopped when the average root-mean-square residual of the final iteration step is reduced to below 0.000001. Subsequent to the computation of wind flow patterns, the second part of the study is concerned with the dispersion of matter and pollutants inside the re-entrant bay. For this purpose, windinduced ventilation of the re-entrant bay filled initially with a passive scalar is studied. This enables the wind-induced flushing behaviour of the bay or the retention time of the scalar pollutant inside the bay to be studied and compared among re-entrant bays of different dimensions. In the computation, a passive and non-buoyant scalar species is used to represent a pollutant and this scalar species is set to fill up the entire volume of the re-entrant bay under study at a uniform concentration at time zero. Afterwards, the scalar is dispersed by the computed wind flow field.",

The same global flow behaviour is observed on the leeward face of the H-shaped buildings. Similar to the windward face, only little flow enters into the leeward side re-entrant bays.

Fig. 6(a, b) shows the vertical distributions of C n (z) for, respectively, the windward and leeward re-entrant bays of width W/B\u00bc 0.5. The distributions for bays of the other two width values are similar and not shown for brevity. The distributions of C w (z) are not shown but the values at the roof opening are presented in Fig. 6(c) . Fig. 6 shows that little air exchange occurs on the middle building levels between the windward bays and their outside. Only at and above the stagnation point level that wind causes significant amount of flow to enter the bay. This inflow rate increases towards the building top level. One part of this amount of air entering the bay goes up and leaves the bay through the roof opening. The other part travels down the bay with little net air exchange with the outside and leaves the bay at levels near the ground, z/Ho0.2. The distributions are similar for bays of different widths or depths, bay or different building heights. The magnitudes of the normal outflow velocity coefficient near the building top or bottom levels are, however, dependent on those dimensions. A larger peak C n is found in deeper bays while the width of the bay has no noticeable effect. The shorter buildings, H/B\u00bc 4, have slightly larger values of peak C n but this occur over a shorter physical vertical distance (over similar ranges of z/H but H is physically smaller) so that the absolute amount of air inflow rate is not as high as that on a taller building. As a result, the amount of air leaving rate through the roof opening, as measured by C w (H), increases with the building height (Fig. 6(c) ). The dependence of C w (H) on the bay dimensions is that a higher average vertical velocity occurs at the roof opening of a narrower and shallower bay. The dependence, as shown in Fig. 6(c) , is only at a slight degree and the absolute amount of air flow rate (which is caused by C w (H) and the bay cross-sectional area) still increases with the size of the bay.",

The decay rate is rapid at the beginning but starts slowing down after the concentration level drops to C/C o o0.1. As an illustration, Fig. 11 shows these decay curves for the re-entrant bays of W/B \u00bc0.25. It can be observed that for the deeper bays, the decay is slower for the bays in a taller building. Little differences are observed for the shallowest re-entrant bays with D/B \u00bc0.125. Fig. 12(a) compares the ventilation efficiencies of the 27 different re-entrant bays using the retention times. It is obvious that a taller height of the building or the re-entrant bay always leads to a longer retention time, which means poorer ventilation or slower dispersion of pollutant. This is because the transport paths are mainly from the roof opening and from near the ground (Fig. 10) so that it takes a longer time to ventilate a taller bay. Fig. 12 clearly shows that the narrowest bays (at W/B\u00bc0.25) are the worst ventilated and the widest bays (at W/B \u00bc0.75) have the shortest retention times. For the widest bays, the retention time increases with the bay depth (D/B) in a near-proportional manner.",

This results in similar dispersion behaviour of the leeward bay as shown in Fig. 10(b) where pollutant leaves the bay from the horizontal roof opening face and from the vertical opening face near the ground. The pollutant leaving the roof opening is brought slightly upwind over the building roof before being blown downward by the separation flow from the building roof. The pollutant leaving the bay near the ground surface keeps flowing along the ground up to about 2.5B distance behind the building rear face before it is lifted upward and slightly upwards, probably due to the recirculation flow behind the building as a whole (Lam and To, 2006) . Similar decay rates of pollutant concentration inside the bays are found for the leeward bays as those in Fig. 11 but the rates of decay are much slower. Fig. 2(b) compares the retention times of the 27 re-entrant bays on the leeward face of a tall building. The values of retention times are longer than those of the windward bays by a factor of about 1.5. Since the air exchange paths are similar to the case of the windward bays, that is, from the roof and the base of the bays, the retention time is found to increase with H. Similar effects of the bay widths and depths on the retention time are observed as for the windward bays.",

            "text": "Re-entrant bays on the building side face are passively ventilated and the dispersion of pollutant out of these bays takes a much longer time than the windward or leeward bays. Fig. 13(a) shows the progress of dispersion of a deep re-entrant bay of dimensions W/B\u00bc0.25 and D/B\u00bc 0.375 on an H\u00bc8B tall building. As described earlier, air exchange is dominated by the large secondary-flow vortex near the ground level which brings in clear air from outside and ejects pollutant-laden air at a short height above. This effect on pollutant dispersion is clearly observed in Fig. 13(a) . For this deep bay, the roof vortex mainly acts to bring in clear air from outside and thus diluting the pollutant concentration near the top of the bay. Fig. 8 has shown that the flow is mainly vertically downward inside the deep bays. This explains why the pollutant cloud in Fig. 13 (a) is retracting towards its lower edge and why there is little dispersion out from the vertical opening of the bay. Fig. 13(b) shows the dispersion of a shallow bay at D/B \u00bc0.125 and it is evident that it is much better ventilated than the deep bay in Fig. 13(a) . This is because the small flow out of the vertical opening of the bay is sufficient to disperse a larger portion of the pollutant inside the shallow bay. Fig. 14 shows the concentration decay curves for 9 bays of the same width at W/B \u00bc0.25 and it is obvious that the decay is much slower for the deeper bays. Another observation is that the heights of the bays do not significantly affect the decay curves. Fig. 15 compares the retention times of the 27 re-entrant bays on the building side faces. It is worth noting that the range of retention times is a few times those for the windward and leeward bays in Fig. 12 . As contrast to the windward or leeward bays, the retention time does not depend on the building or bay height, except for the deepest bays at D/B \u00bc0.375 where a taller height leads to slightly longer retention time. This is because the dispersion of pollutant mostly occurs evenly along the building height (Fig. 13) . Obviously, the retention time is strongest affected by the bay depth. This is indeed observed in the figure where the nine curves are separated into three groups with the deepest bays at D/B\u00bc0.375 occupying the three uppermost curves of the longest retention times and the shallowest bays at D/B\u00bc0.125 making the three lowermost curves of the shortest retention times. The width of the bay also affects the retention time with a shorter retention time for a wider bay but the effect is not as strong as the bay depth. It can also be stated that the ventilation efficiency of the side bays depends on their cross-sectional areas (W \u00c2 D). standard k-e model for turbulence closure. Natural wind profiles of the open land exposure are used as the inlet boundary conditions. After solution of the mean flow field, the entire re-entrant bay is filled with a scalar species at uniform concentration and subsequent dispersion of the scalar by wind-induced ventilation of the bay is computed using the mean flow field. The results revealed that the external wind flow around a building is not significantly altered by the presence of a re-entrant bay. Whether a re-entrant bay is on the windward, leeward or side face of the building, the induced flow inside it occurs at slow velocities. The flow inside a bay on the side face of the building is highly 3D and very complex while the flow inside a windward or leeward bay is simpler. For a re-entrant bay on the windward face of the building, flow stagnation point occurs in the time-averaged sense at z/HE0.8 and flow entering the bay above this height escapes through the roof opening. On lower heights, flow mainly travels downwards inside the bay and escapes upwind near the ground level. Of the bays on different faces of a building, the windward bays are the best ventilated with the shortest retention times. The retention time increases with the height of the building and the ventilation improves with a wider and narrower bay. The flow pattern inside a bay on the leeward side of the building is very much the reverse of that of the windward bay. Air is sucked into the bay from the building wake at an upper height and escapes through the roof opening and near the ground level. The flow rate is less than the windward bay and the retention time is about 1.5 longer.",

The air exchange rate with the external wind flow is much slower than that of the windward or leeward bay. The retention time of the trapped pollutant is a few times longer. The flow is highly 3D and complicated. On the horizontal plane, a recirculation vortex is observed inside the bay and the vortex is particularly well developed for bays having W/D near unity. On the vertical plane, two secondary-flow vortical structures with streamwise vorticity are observed. One vortex is located near the ground bringing air from outside into the bay at levels near the ground and ejecting air at z/HE0.2-0.4. Another vortex is located below the roof opening. Between the two vortices, flow inside the bay is mainly downward over a large and middle portion of the bay height. Air exchange between the bay and outside occurs over most of the bay height. As a result, the ventilation efficiency of the side re-entrant bay, as measured by the retention time of pollutant, does not depend significantly on the building height. The determining factor is the bay depth followed by the bay width. This study does not consider buoyant pollutant and heat discharge. In those cases, buoyancy acts as an additional factor for flow and scalar transport inside the bays. As an implication to the ventilation design of the re-entrant bays, our results show that the depth of the bay reduces the ventilation efficiency in a significant manner. The bays on the building side face are much worse ventilated than the windward or leeward bays but their ventilation efficiency is not affected by the building height which plays a governing effect on the pollutant dispersion for the later two types of re-entrant bays. In general, air exchange and pollutant dispersion are the worst in taller and deeper bays. In these conditions, windinduced flow by the natural wind might not be able to take away harmful gaseous discharges or waste heat from the bays. In the worst case, disastrous events like the Amoy Garden Crises would result. Therefore, it will be suggested that to deploy a shallow recessed re-entrant bay, say depth not larger than 1/8 the building breadth. ",
