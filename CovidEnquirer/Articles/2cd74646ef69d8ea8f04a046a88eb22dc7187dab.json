From the perspectives of shippers and freight forwarders, a selection must align with cost control strategy and sustain service reliability across cooperative service providers. This paper assesses the selection with the options of both sea and air transports, and from the influence of country of origin of the company. Critical factors of transshipment hub selection, both qualitative and quantitative, are identified through focus group discussions. Relative importance of these factors is determined based on collective views of logistics stakeholders. The competitiveness of transshipment hubs is then assessed using an AHP approach. Our analysis is based on the historical implementation of direct transportation link policy between Mainland China and Taiwan. With this empirical work, the finding suggests that even the spawn of other nearby ports with shorter transport distance and closer proximity to cargo sources, there remain overriding factors such as customs regulations & government policies and connectivity that a transshipment hub is preferred.",

Nowadays, it is a common practice for logistics service providers and airlines to transport cargo from Asia via ocean to the Middle Eastern freight hub and then transfer to an aircraft for the second leg of the journey to Europe or Latin America ( Kulisch, 2016 ) . In Northern Canada, it has been witnessed that water conditions impact shippers' route choice decisions and the overall performance of multimodal freight transport systems ( Du, Kim, & Zheng, 2017 ) . Here an intermodal operator (e.g. shipper, carrier, or terminal operator) typically designs her service products by following dynamic allocation policies of resources (e.g. air and sea resources), and make her route choice based on the intermodal transportation network ( Wang & Meng, 2017; Wang, Wang, & Zhang, 2017 ) . Both the real-world practices and the relevant academic studies endorse that when selecting a transshipment hub, the services related to both sea and air transports should not be assessed in isolation.",

Country of origin, when associated with products, could be regarded as synonymous of high quality and original design, influencing the value perceived by the customers ( Insch & McBride, 2004 ) . It could also be a critical factor affecting particular strategic decision making, such as supply chain configuration of the firms ( Brun et al., 2008; Teng & Jaramillo, 2005 ) . Other literatures have suggested that companies with different country of origin could have significant different emphasis in strategic decision making ( Demirbag, Tatoglu, Glaister, & Zaim, 2010; Harzing & Sorge, 2003 ) . Similarly, in our study, a company's decision makers are likely to have deeper understanding of the ports in the region where their company originally established and more concrete knowledge of their country's unique competitive edge as a selling point in the market.

It is interesting to note that nine of out of the top ten container ports are in Asia and they are all competing for transshipment cargo. In this paper, Hong Kong and Taiwan's current role as a transshipment hub are examined in the greater China region where direct transportation link (DTL) policy has been implemented. As a transshipment hub, Hong Kong has enjoyed a steady increase in cargo flows since 2005. 1 Hong Kong's transshipment hub status is unwavering as there is a lack of transportation policies between Taiwan and the Mainland. However, the DTL policy opens direct cargo flow, by sea and air, across the Straits between Taiwan and the Mainland China. Without direct flights to Taiwan from the Mainland, many thousands of Taiwanese companies based in Guangdong and Fujian provinces have to hub their components and finished products in their export operation through Hong Kong. Now related logistics stakeholders in the region have to carefully frame the global transport network and select transshipment hub accordingly.",

These single transportation mode studies were conducted from the perspective of logistics stakeholders in the sea transport community. For instance, Nir, Lin, and Liang (2003) examined Taiwan shippers' behavior when making selection among the three local sea ports, while Lirn et al. (2004) studied the same set of ports from the perspective of global ocean container carriers. These studies provided an understanding of sea port selection in key global regions. More recently, Wang and Hong (2011a) argued, with respect to air freight transportation, Taiwan had taken on this endeavor to gain competitive advantages under Direct Transport Link policy. In our study, we are not looking at selection of a single-modal port among competitive ones in a region, but rather at the selection of a transshipment hub, where choices of different modals are presented, in the context of global cargo logistics.",

Chang, Lee, and Tongzon (2008) performed exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis in shipping lines' port selection with main haul services between East Asia and Europe. This study identified five important factors, including advancement/convenience of port, physical/operational ability of port, operational condition of shipping lines, marketability , and port charge. Recently, Wang, Jung, Yeo, and Chou (2014) studied the cruise lines' port selection using the fuzzy-AHP method. The study specified the most considerable factor, i.e. tourism attractions , which is problemspecific and two important concerns, i.e. connectivity and agility and terminal facilities , which are general in port selection. In the context of West Africa, the AHP study conducted by Gohomene, Yang, Bonsal, Maistralis, Wang, and Li (2016) has identified port infrastructure as the most crucial factor, along with other important concerns, including port draught, political stability, market size , and international networks . Onut et al. (2011) formulated a production firm's selection of container ports within the Marmara region as a fuzzy AHP model, which examines six major criteria, i.e. port location, hinterland economy, physical features of port, port efficiency, cost , and some others. Ahn, Lee, and Han (2014) examined port selection of import and export companies in metropolitan areas trading with China and they identified a set of relevant concerns, including port fee, ocean freight changes , and port information services . It is found that port location and cost were typically important factors in a variety of research contexts.",

AHP is a flexible and powerful approach to measure both tangible and intangible criteria. With AHP, an expert develops multiple decision criteria with a hierarchy and assesses the relative importance of these criteria by comparing each pair of the criteria-that is, a pairwise comparison process. Pairwise comparison can be conducted by surveying either the whole population or a sample of qualified decision-makers ( Hughes, 2009 ; Lirn et al., 2003 ). With the relative importance of all the criteria, the overall ranking of the alternatives is then calculated. The rating is rather subjective and is based on the experience and expertise gained by the respondents. Therefore, AHP studies commonly take samples of experts or participants from top management teams (e.g. chief executive officer, general manager, or division director) of relevant organization(s) from professional industrial communities ( Di Gravio, Patriarca, Mancini, & Costantino, 2016 ) . Representative group judgments could be then obtained by aggregating individual weights through geometric mean ( Van Den Honert & Lootsma, 1997 ) .",

Moreover, inconsistency may also happen due to the incorporation of 9-scale points in the survey. For example, if an respondent put an answer that Factor A is more important than Factor B at \"3\" (i.e. moderately important), and Factor B is more important than Factor C at \"9\" (i.e. extremely important), and Factor C is less important than Factor A at \"2\" (i.e. moderately important), then inconsistence happens again in terms of scale points. Table 3 shows the results of consistence tests of individual judgments. To deal with inconsistent adjustments, researchers could request interviewees to change their entry iteratively until interviewees' judgments are near consistent ( Saaty, 2003 ) . In our study, each interviewee has to complete 9 pairwise comparison matrixes. The current interview lasts for 50-55 min, with the first 5-10 min to introduce the project and the remaining 45 min to complete the questionnaire. If we perform to correct inconsistent weights, the iterative change would substantially extend the interview time. Moreover, it may create survey fatigue, i.e., interviewees may feel bored, tired or uninterested in the survey and begin to perform less honestly. Interviewees could \"become arbitrary and thus distort the validity of the derived priority vector in representing the underlying decision\" ( Saaty, 2003 , page 85) . Therefore, to make the interview manageable and to ensure the quality of the judgments, we exclude the practitioners whose individual responses fail in consistence tests (i.e., the consistence level is higher than 0.1) from our AHP analysis. As a result, 25 out of 33 respondents are included in this study. Representative group judgments. Representative group judgments are obtained by aggregating the individual judgments of respondents within the same group. Individual practitioners in a category typically have some similar concerns in selecting a transshipment hub. Aggregating individual judgments is generally a proper way to represent the common concerns of the identified group. Certain computation techniques are used, such as calculating the geometric average of respective pairwise comparison weights of all the respondents, in order to obtain the overall rating on each factor and attribute collected from each group.",

As the seaports in Mainland China have been gradually developed with advanced technologies and facilities, the seaports in Hong Kong have yet to show similar driving force to maintain its leading role and competitiveness. Such lack of development progress would incur inconveniences and handicaps for 3PLs and shippers to make full use of the policy. Taiwan, on the other hand, ports have been unattractive possibly due to unstable climate especially in typhoon seasons, which could incur higher operation costs such as delays in cargo delivery. This could result in lower motivation for the 3PLs and shipping lines to use Taiwan ports. Indeed, comparatively inefficient facilities and less transparent cargo information lead to inconvenience to operators and 3PLs for cargo handling.
