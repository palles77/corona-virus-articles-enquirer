Microbiol., Pregnant sows were inoculated with inactivated transmissible gastroenteritis virus and with preparations of virus surface projections and subviral particles derived by detergent treatment of the virus. Neutralising antibody was demonstrated in serum and colostrum from animals that received whole virus or preparations of surface projections whereas subviral particles failed to stimulate neutralising antibody formation. Similar results were obtained with serum from rabbits inoculated with whole virus and structural components. All three preparations stimulated the formation of agglutinating antibodies, as demonstrated by sedimentation analysis and filtration studies with radiolabelled virus.",

Similarly rabbits immunised with purified whole virus or surface projections produced neutralising antibody to TGEV while administration of subviral particles produced no detectable neutralising activity. These data suggest that neutralising antibody raised during infection of swine with TGEV is directed against a structural antigen of the virion and that this antigen is associated with the surface projection, a similar finding to that obtained with other lipid enveloped viruses (Webster and Laver, 1966; Cartwright et al., 1969; Jennings et al., 1974; Hunsmann et al., 1975) . The fact that no neutralising antibody was produced in the pigs and rabbits that received subviral particles alone strongly suggests that the structural elements of these particles are not involved in virus neutralisation; conclusive proof of this, however, would necessitate the use of more animals than were available in the present study. The possibility existed that the TGEV subviral particles were not antigenic in the animals used. This seemed unlikely as we had previously shown that these structures of 60 nm diameter, readily visualised by electron microscopy, contained all the structural proteins except for the sulphated glycoprotein of the SP (Garwes et al., 1976) . Standard serological tests, such as complement fixation and radial immunodiffusion, are not sensitive enough to detect the levels of antibodies present in the experimental sera. The radioimmune assay techniques described above indicated, however, that antibody directed against the surface of the virus was produced in response to inoculation of sows with whole virus or either of the structural moieties. The sedimentation analyses showed that these sera caused an increase in the sedimentation coefficient of the virus, presumably by coating the particles with antibody molecules, and brought about sufficient aggregation to pellet radioactivity to the bottom of the gradient.",

The use of this technique to quantitate agglutinating antibody is complicated by the need to incorporate rabbit anti-porcine IgG serum into the test. As discussed in the text, purified TGEV adsorbs irreversibly to membrane filters containing cellulose nitrate. This necessitated using cellulose acetate filters, for which the smallest pore diameter available is 200 nm. Assuming that virus aggregates are approximately spherical and composed of particles 70--80 nm in diameter, the smallest aggregate that sould be retained reproducibly by such filters would need to comprise 20--30 virions. The secondary antiserum to porcine immunoglobulin is required to achieve complexes of this size. The low level of retention of virus incubated with low dilutions of immune sera presumably reflects the solubility of antigen--antibody complexes in the presence of large excesses of either of the two reactants.",

(1975) . Whether this discrepancy is due to differences in the types of antigen used is not known. It is of interest that sow no. 9, which received SP antigen, produced neutralising antibody of the IgA class in the colostrum and was the only animal capable of protecting her piglets against challenge with live virus. The possibility that this sow encountered live TGEV prior to farrowing and that the experimental inoculation generated a secondary immune response cannot be totally ruled out, since infection with the live virus stimulates IgM and IgA antibody production (sow no. 1 above; Lucas et al., 1974; Stone et al., 1974) and may result in limited protection of the litter. There was no other reason to believe that prior infection with TGEV had occurred, however. All the control sows remained sero-negative throughout the experimental period. The apparent lack of neutralising antibody of the IgM class in the pigs that received inactivated viral material may have resulted from the materials used and the route of inoculation; the times at which the serum samples were taken may have been too late, however, to have detected a transitory IgM response.",

            "text": "It has been reported that a soluble antigen from TGEV-infected swine testis cells could induce neutralising antibody formation when injected into rabbits. From the data presented above we should anticipate that the soluble antigen concerned is likely to comprise viral SP either free in solution or bound to small fragments of membrane. Since the viral SP is characterised mainly by the molecular weight of its component glycopolypeptide and has neither haemagglutinin nor enzyme activity associated with it, the task of recognising the presence of SP in crude tissue extracts is difficult. It should be possible, however, to develop a radioimmune assay using specific antibody to purified components. Such a test would facilitate the preparation of potent antigen suspensions and work is in progress to this end.",
