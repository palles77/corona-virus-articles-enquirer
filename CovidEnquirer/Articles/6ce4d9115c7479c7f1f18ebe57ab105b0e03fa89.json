It is estimated that approximately 350 million people are under the risk of leishmaniasis infection and 12 million are infected (Alvar et al., 2012) . In southern Europe, leishmaniasis is a zoonotic protozoan disease caused by Leishmania infantum. This parasite is transmitted by phlebotomine sand flies under natural conditions during feeding. Although various phlebotomine species have been implicated in the transmission of L. infantum in Europe, only two species are the most important vector of canine leishmaniosis in the Iberian Peninsula: Phlebotomus perniciosus and Phlebotomus ariasi (Lucientes et al., 2005) . Female Phlebotomus feed on a variety of vertebrate hosts, including humans, livestock species, dogs, wild rabbits, hares, rodents and cats.",

Inflammation was characterized by dense infiltrates of macrophages, few neutrophils, low numbers of lymphocytes and plasma cells, and rare multinucleate giant cells. The auricular cartilage was unaffected. This lesion was accompanied by areas of necrosis in the dermis and proteinaceous edema and serocellular crusts. Macrophages and multinucleate giant cells contained large numbers of oval organisms with an eccentric nucleus and pale cytoplasm, measuring approximately 3 to 4 \u03bcm in diameter, compatible with Leishmania spp. amastigotes or Histoplasma spp. yeasts were observed (Fig. 2) . To determine the presence of Leishmania parasites in tissue section, immunohistochemistry was performed using a standard protocol with an Autostainer Link48\u2122 (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) and an in-house rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for L. infantum. Blocking of endogenous peroxidase activity (Dako REAL\u2122 Peroxidase-Blocking Solution, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) was performed before sections were incubated for 30 min with the primary antiserum at room temperature (RT) (1 in 500 dilution in EnVision Flex\u2122 antibody diluent, Dako). Thereafter, sections were incubated for 30 min at RT with Dako EnVision+ System-HRP,Rb\u2122. The substrate used for detection was 3.3\u2032-diaminobenzidine incubated for 10 min. Sections were then counterstained with hematoxylin for 8 min (EnVision\u2122 FLEX Hematoxylin, Dako) and covered in slides. For the negative control, the primary antibody was replaced with non-immune rabbit serum. A biopsy sample of the lymph node from a dog with clinical leishmaniosis was included as a positive control.

WB was performed as described by Riera et al. (1999) , with some modifications. It was done on 0.1% SDS-13% polyacrylamide gel on a Mini-gel Bio RadSystem. Sera diluted at 1/50 were assayed and a protein A peroxidase conjugate (1/1000 dilution; Pierce) was used. A serum positive was considered when immunoreactivity against the 14 and/or16 kDa Leishmania antigen fraction was observed. ELISA was performed as described by Riera et al. (1999) . Sera were diluted at 1/50 and a protein A peroxidase conjugate (dilution, 1/8000; Pierce) was used. The cutoff was set to 0.137 optical density units (OD) (mean + 4 standard deviations of values from 8 ferrets with a negative result for Leishmania real-time PCR in blood). Each test included serum from a L. infantum confirmed symptomatic dog from Spain with a L. infantum isolation as positive control and serum from a healthy, non-infected dog as negative control because the protein A peroxidase conjugate has been employed in canine samples. Immunoreactivity from the Leishmania antigen was detected by WB (band of 16 kDa) and specific antibodies against L. infantum were detected by ELISA. Medium levels of antibodies were determined with an OD result of 0.599. Later, other quantitative serological tests were performed including an in-house immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT), for detecting L. infantum immunoglobulin G antibodies using L. infantum (strain MHOM/FR/78/LEM75 zymodeme MON-1) as whole-parasite antigen fixed on multi-spot slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). All samples were diluted 1:20 with phosphatebuffered saline (PBS), and the endpoint titer of positive samples was determined by preparing serial twofold dilutions of the serum starting from the cutoff value. Immediately thereafter, 20 \u03bcL of every diluted serum sample were applied per well. The slides were incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C in a moist chamber. Slides were then washed twice with PBS for 5 min and once with distilled water. Following the washing procedure, 20 \u03bcL of fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-ferret immunoglobulin G (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) diluted 1:16 in Evans blue solution were added to each well. The slides were incubated in a moist chamber at 37\u00b0C for an additional 30 min in the dark. The washing procedure was repeated, and several drops of mounting medium were then added to the cover slips. Slides were examined under a fluorescence microscope (Leica DM750 RH; Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) at 400 \u00d7 magnification and each well was compared to the fluorescent pattern observed in the positive Fig. 2 . Histological sections of affected tissues with leishmaniosis in a ferret. a: Note a papular thickening of the ear (delimited with arrowheads) due to granulomatous inflammation. c = auricular cartilage. b: A higher magnification of this inflammatory lesion reveals infiltrates of macrophages and low numbers of lymphocytes as a well as a multinucleate giant cell (arrow). The cytoplasm of macrophages and this giant cell are ladden with oval microorganisms with an eccentric nucleus. Hematoxylin and eosin. and negative controls. The samples were examined by two different researchers. The cutoff for this technique was set to 1:20 dilution by analyzing 8 serum samples from ferrets with a negative result for Leishmania real-time PCR in blood. The same procedure was repeated with the modification of fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-dog immunoglobulin G (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Due to the lack of ferret positive reference serum samples, the ferret IFAT was determined by carrying out a parallel canine test run, using positive serum control (a dog from Spain with L. infantum confirmed with positive L. infantum culture) and negative serum control (dog from United Kingdom, a non-endemic area). Positive and negative controls were included on each slide. The result of the ferret IFAT was positive at 1:160 dilution with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-ferret immunoglobulin G. However, a negative result of the ferret serum sample was obtained with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-dog immunoglobulin G.",
