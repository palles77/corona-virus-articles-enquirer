This motif is a generalized feature of viral fusion proteins and has been exploited in generating antiviral fusion agents. In the present paper, we report structural characters of Env protein from another lentivirus, bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV), which contributes to a good animal model of HIV. BIV HR1 and HR2 regions are predicted by two different programs and expressed separately or conjointly in Escherichia coli. Biochemical and biophysical analyses show that the predicted HRs of BIV Env can form a stable trimer-of-hairpins or six-helix bundle just like that formed by feline immunodeficiency virus Env. Cell fusion assay demonstrates that the HR2 peptide of BIV can efficiently inhibit the virus-mediated cell fusion.",

            "text": "Biophysical and biochemical studies suggest that the rather diverse enveloped viruses, including retroviruses, paramyxoviruses, filoviruses, coronaviruses, etc., adopt a similar mechanism in membrane fusion [1] . The homologous virus fusion model is based on the similar structures characterized with a trimer-of-hairpins or six-helix bundles, which are formed by two heptad repeat regions (HR1 and HR2) from virus envelope proteins [2] . It was also demonstrated that blocking the trimer-of-hairpins formation by external peptides derived from HR1 or HR2 regions could inhibit virus-cell fusion, which had led to the production of an antiviral drug used in AIDS [3, 4] . For the genus lentiviruses of retroviruses, most studies about virus fusion were focused on the well-known HIV and SIV and few works were carried on the other two members, FIV and BIV, especially BIV, named by Gonda in 1987 for its similarity to HIV-1 and SIV in morphology, immunology, and genetics [5, 6] . As an infectious retrovirus, BIV induces splenomegaly and lymphademopathy syndromes with associated fatal immune dysfunctions [5] . Although BIV does not appear to infect human, the virus is able to replicate productively at the mucosal surfaces in rabbits, emphasizing the importance of BIV/rabbit system as a good small-animal model [7, 8] . Remarkably, BIVsmall-animal model can be useful in studying mechanisms of lentivirus persistence as well as methods of intervention relevant to HIV infection, both being crucial in current researches on the fatal disease of AIDS. Unfortunately, despite its potential significance, thus far little is known about BIV, including the structural characters of the envelope protein. that BIV might share the same fusion mechanism as HIV and SIV, but there is no evidence to support it yet.",

The gp120 can bind the receptors at cell surface, while the gp41 subunit contains specific domains necessary for virus fusion, including fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeat region 1 (HR1), and heptad repeat region 2 (HR2). Crystal structure indicates the formation of trimer of HR1 and HR2 heterodimers for HIV and SIV [9, 10] . As other retroviruses, the surface glycoprotein of BIV is essential to the entry of viral genomes into host cells and genomic analysis of BIV, which suggests that the transmembrane protein is more conservative than the surface protein [5, 11] , which also indicates that BIV Env might share the common features with homologous proteins in the family of retroviruses, although the fusion peptide of BIV has not been reported up to the present.",

            "text": "Two different programs, LearnCoil-VMF and Coils, were employed to predict the heptad repeat regions for the BIV Env protein. As illustrated in the research work of Kim and co-workers [12] , LearnCoil-VMF is a specialized program for identifying the coiled-coil-like regions that compose the trimer-of-hairpins motif in viral membrane fusion proteins. Results show that this program is able to predict two such regions (corresponding to HR1 and HR2) in almost all viral membrane fusion proteins, including retrovirus envelope proteins, paramyxovirus fusion proteins, orthomyxovirus hemagglutinins, coronavirus spike proteins, arenavirus glycoproteins, and baculovirus envelope glycoproteins. Most of these predictions have been supported by the crystal structures [9, [14] [15] [16] 10, 17, 18] . In the lentiviruses, two HR regions were successfully predicted by Learn-Coil-VMF in the envelope proteins of HIV-1, SIV, FIV, Visna virus, and CAEV. Instead, only one HR region was detected in the Env protein from BIV with the same program (Fig. 1A) . However, another completely different region can be predicted with high likelihood in BIV Env by the Coils program (Fig. 1A) . These two predicted regions are located in the similar positions of HR1 and HR2, which occur also in the Envs of other lentiviruses, like HIV and FIV (Fig. 1C) . Therefore, it might be suggested that the two regions predicted by LearnCoil-VMF and Coils were corresponding to HR1 and HR2, respectively (Figs. 1A and B) . The amino acid sequence multiple alignments also indicate the similar characters of the possible HR1 and HR2 of BIV Env as those of other lentiviruses, in which the residues a, d in the heptad repeats are almost all hydrophobic amino acids ( Figs. 2A and B) .",

The resulting trimer structure of 2-Helix shows that the interaction between HR1 and HR2 in BIV is most probably an intrinsic tendency, demanding no external impact such as a covalent bond. This is also true in other lentiviruses. The same results were also obtained with FIV 2-Helix protein (Fig. 4B) .

The CD spectra of HR1s also indicate the characteristic of a-helix, while HR2 appeared to be largely random coils characterized by a minimum around 200 nm. However, the mixture of HR1 and HR2 in equimolar amounts at room temperature for 1 h exhibited a CD spectrum curve with intensified double minima at 208 and 222 nm compared to HR1 or HR2 alone, which indicates a higher a-helix content, demonstrating the helical interaction of HR1 and HR2 (Figs. 5C and D) . Thermodynamic stability analysis also showed that the 2-Helix protein was thermal-stable with a T m as high as 80\u00b0C (Fig. 5B ). All these results provide the evidence that the predicted HR1 and HR2 peptides of BIV can form a stable six-helix bundle or a trimer of HR1/HR2 heterodimers, which might represent the core structure of Env protein at the postfusion state. This core structure has been well studied in the family of lentiviruses as well as many other enveloped viruses. Therefore, BIV might share the same fusion mechanism as the other lentiviruses and the HR peptides could also be inhibitors of virus fusion. ",

According to our previous research on Newcastle disease virus (NDV), the fusion partner GST (26 kDa) does not affect the inhibition [21] . The non-inhibition of GST-2-Helix indicates that HR2 peptides work as competitors to the endogenous HR2 regions by binding to the HR1 sites of Env. The IC 50 value of HR2 was measured to be 1.17 \u00b1 0.3 lM. This result shows again that BIV shares the similar fusion mechanism as HIV. For enveloped virus, it has been shown that, unlike the HR2 regions, not all HR1s show fusion inhibitory effects [19, 21] .

The HR1 and HR2 peptides from BIV show exactly the same interacting activities as those shown by corresponding regions in other lentiviruses, which indicates the probability of similar roles in virus-cell fusion. This is another evidence, which demonstrates that all the envelope proteins from different lentiviruses have common structure features, despite the lack of sequence homology among them.

In HIV-1, the C-peptides (derived from HR2), effective at nanomolar concentrations, are much more potent than N-peptides (derived from HR1), which require micromolar concentrations for effectiveness. The C-peptides could inhibit entry by competitively binding to the conserved groove on surface of the endogenous HR1 central coiled-coil trimer, which is also the binding site of outer C helices within viral gp41. The N-peptide might inhibit fusion by interfering with formation of the central, coiled-coil trimer within viral gp41 and/or by binding to endogenous viral HR2 region [9] . The broad inhibitory activity of C peptides against diverse HIV isolates is explained by the highly conserved hydrophobic groove to which these peptides bind. Toward the bottom of the groove is a deep cavity that is filled by three hydrophobic residues from the C helix. This pocket is potentially a good target for inhibiting HIV invasion [1] .

BIV and FIV could share the same fusion mechanism with HIV-1 and SIV based on structural similarities. The crystal structures of the trimer of HR1/HR2 heterodimers in HIV-1, SIV, and Visna virus of lentiviruses, as well as Ebola of filoviruses, SV5 and HRSV of paramyxoviruses, and mouse hepatitis virus of coronaviruses, indicate that three HR1 domains are parallel coiled-coil in the interior of the bundle, and three HR2 domains are packed in an antiparallel manner in the grooves of the HR1 trimer. It will be helpful for fusion inhibition study to determine the interaction characters of HR1 and HR2 from BIV and FIV at molecular level, which is currently under our effort.",
