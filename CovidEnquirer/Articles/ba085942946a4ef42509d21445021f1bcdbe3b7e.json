However, the metaanalysis of 18 randomized and controlled studies, being five in children and 13 in adults, indicates that it does not have benefit of the indiscriminate use of the IBPs in chronic cough (33) . The eight patients who cough in the period where pH of exhaled air remained below of 7,4 had been the ones that had answered to the therapy made with IBP during one month -the pharmaceutical, doses and dosage had not been specified. The researchers suggest to apply this method in the selection of the cases of chronic cough to detect, of not invasive form, the acidification of VAS for gastroesophageal reflux, and thus to prevent the unnecessary use of IBPs.",
