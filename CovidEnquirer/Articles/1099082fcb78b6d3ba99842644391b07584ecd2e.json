Although human beings are believed to have originated about 3\u00c04 million years ago, the oldest record of virus in history was found only 4000 years ago in ancient Egypt ( Fig. 1.1 ). The victim of poliovirus was inscribed in a stele. In addition, evidence of smallpox 1 was found in Egyptian mummies. The earliest physical evidence of it is probably the pustular rash found on the mummified body of Pharaoh Ramses V of Egypt (1149\u00c01145 BC). Smallpox was described in the literature of ancient China (700 BC) as well. It is believed that the collapse of the Inca and Aztec cultures in South America can be attributed to smallpox and measles 2 that were brought by European explorers. After all, viruses have greatly influenced the fates of ancient cultures extinguished in human history.",

It was the moment of discovery of the yellow fever virus (YFV) in 1902-the first human virus ever isolated. In fact, the discovery of YFV involved human volunteers including colleagues of Walter Reed, some of whom unfortunately succumbed to the virus they discovered.

Louis Pasteur had earlier used rabbits for transmission of rabies for the development of rabies vaccine (see Box 25.1). Therefore, unlike yellow fever, an animal model for transmission was already available before the discovery of the etiologic agent. Nonetheless, Louis Pasteur failed to isolate and cultivate a rabies microbe in a media, in which bacterium are expected to grow. Almost two decades later in 1903, Paul Remlinger demonstrated that the filtrates of rabies inoculum transmit the disease to animals. Thus, rabies virus, a filterable agent that causes rabies in animals, was discovered. In 1908, Karl Landsteiner, an Austrian scientist, reported the FIGURE 1.3 Chronicle of the major discoveries in virus research. The major milestones in virus research are shown. Small pox vaccine (by Edward Jenner) and rabies vaccine (by Louis Pasteur) were developed even prior to the discovery of virus by Ivanowski in 1892, as demarcated by a separate arrow bar.

            "text": "One big question that remained unanswered until the 1950s was what is the genetic material of life? A prevailing view was that protein rather than nucleic acid was more likely to be the genetic materials responsible for inheritance due to its higher diversity (ie, 20 amino acids versus 4 bases). In fact, the experiment that proved nucleic acids to be the genetic material was carried out by an experiment using bacteriophages 7 (ie, a virus of bacteria). Bacteriophages, which propagate rapidly in bacterial hosts, became a favorite experimental subject during 1940\u00c01960. In 1952, when the identity of the genetic material was still in debate, Hershey clearly demonstrated that the nucleic acid component of bacteriophage T2 was the genetic material ( Fig. 1.4) . In his experiment, nucleic acids and proteins were radiolabeled distinctively either with 32 P and 35 S, respectively. Such a prepared T2 phage was used to infect a bacterium, and examined to see whether 32 P or 35 S was detectable in the cell pellet after centrifugation. Since T2 phage was known to inject the genetic material into the host cell, what is detected in the cell pellet represents the genetic materials. Indeed, 32 P (nucleic acid) was abundantly detected in the pellet, while 35 S (protein) was detected in the supernatant, revealing that FIGURE 1.4 A seminal experiment, which demonstrated that DNA is the genetic material. T2 phage, that was propagated either in the presence of 32 P (purple) or 35 S (green), was used to infect Escherichia coli, a host. The mixture was subjected to blending to detach the phage from the host cells. Following centrifugation, the amount of 32 P and 35 S was measured from cell pellet (E. coli) and supernatants (T2 phage). 7. Bacteriophage A bacteriophage (informally, phage) is a virus that infects and replicates within bacteria. The term is derived from Greek word phagein \"to eat.\" the nucleic acids are the genetic materials. This work represents a seminal discovery that clearly proved that \"DNA is the genetic material\" (see Fig. 1 .3).",

Briefly, two strains of TMV, that exhibits distinct lesions on the leaf, were employed. After separating into proteins and RNA, two hybrid viruses were reconstituted by mixing two components. These hybrid viruses were used to infect the host plant. Remarkably, the phenotype of the reconstituted hybrid viruses was determined by the RNA, but not the proteins.

In addition, it is submicroscopic and the physical size of the most of animal viruses ranges from 30 to 300 nm in diameter ( Fig. 1.6 ). Hence, a virus can be aptly said to be a \"nanoparticle\" in nature. On the other hand, a \"virus\" can be viewed as a molecular complex constituted of the nucleic acids and the protein shells that encompass the nucleic acids. The nucleic acids can be either RNA or DNA. Although all living organisms on the globe have a DNA genome, viruses are the only organisms, if you may, that still employs RNA as genome. The role of protein shells, also called capsids, is to protect the viral genome from biochemical damage. In addition, some viruses have an envelope (ie, a lipid bilayer) that coats the capsids. What are the common features that are shared by viruses? Because viruses are found in almost all living organisms on earth, their biological properties should be as diverse as their host organisms. Nonetheless, five common features of viruses, regardless of their hosts, are perceived. A defining feature is that a \"virus\" replicates only inside living cells. In other words, a \"virus\" is simply a physical entity outside of cells, as it cannot reproduce outside of cells. More precisely speaking, what a virus really belongs to is an interface between living and nonliving matter (Box 1.1).

Moreover, oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes were mainly discovered through studies on RNA tumor viruses and DNA tumor viruses, respectively (see chapter: Tumor Viruses).

Note that the mutation rate of retroviruses are lower than that of single-stranded RNA viruses, but comparable to that of single-stranded DNA viruses. What is the biological implication of having a higher mutation rate? A living organism has to cope with environmental changes via a process called \"adaptation\" or \"evolution.\" Mutation is the driving force for evolution. In other words, mutations are not always harmful, but can be beneficial to an organism. Being random events, the vast majority of mutations lead to the loss of gene function. Some of the mutations, at least, can be advantageous for the virus to survive in challenging environments. The process of outgrowth of a virus having such advantageous mutations is termed \"selection\" or \"adaptation.\" Therefore, the emergence of viral mutants (ie, variants) is the consequence of not only mutation but also selection.

These subviral agents will be described in more detail in chapter \"Subviral Agents and Prions.\" Subviral agents comprise three kinds: satellite viruses, viroids, and prions (Table 1 .4). A satellite virus is morphologically indistinguishable from a regular virus, and composed of nucleic acids and capsid proteins. However, one important distinction is that its replication depends on another virus (ie, a host virus). Since the satellite virus cannot replicate in the absence of a host virus, it can be said to be \"a parasite of parasite.\" The second kind of subviral agent is the \"viroids\" that are found only in plants.

Jean-Michel Claverie wittily added that \"The discovery of virophage makes 'virus' more living organisms.\" Paradoxically, \"being sick\" can be said to be the evidence of \"living.\" It was the first report that a virus particle was found packaged inside a host virus, which is already acting as a parasite of the host organism. genome replication mechanism of a novel virus immediately upon the availability of nucleotide sequence. On the other hand, subviral agents, such as viroids and prions, are extraordinary in the sense that RNA or protein itself is an infectious agent, as detailed in chapter \"Subviral Agents and Prions.\" Another extraordinary infectious agents are giant viruses discovered in amoeba. These two extraordinary infectious agents seem to blur and challenge the classical definition of the virus.",

G Virology: Virology is a discipline, which studies the diverse aspects of virus replication and its consequences to the host cell. Virology, the study of viruses, has been established and has advanced a great deal over the past century. G Classification: Animal viruses are classified into three groups: DNA viruses, RNA viruses, and reverse transcribing (RT) viruses. They are further classified into seven groups, according to their genome or by the Baltimore classification.
