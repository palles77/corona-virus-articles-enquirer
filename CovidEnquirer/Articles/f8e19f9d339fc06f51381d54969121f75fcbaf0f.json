Personnel contributed 3 serologic samples during June-October 2009, with seroconversion defi ned as a >4-fold increase in hemagglutination inhibition titers to pandemic (H1N1) 2009. Of 531 participants, 35 showed evidence of seroconversion. Seroconversion rates were highest in nurses (28/290) and lowest in allied health staff (2/116). Signifi cant risk factors on multivariate analysis were being a nurse (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 4.5, 95% confi dence interval [CI] 1.0-19.6) and working in pandemic (H1N1) 2009 isolation wards (aOR 4.5, 95% CI 1.3-15.6). Contact with pandemic (H1N1) 2009-infected colleagues (aOR 2.5, 95% CI 0.9-6.6) and larger household size (aOR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0-1.4) were of borderline signifi cance. Our study suggests that seroconversion was associated with occupational and nonoccupational risk factors.",

Exposure data covered nonoccupational exposures such as travel out of Singapore and episodes of ARI and FRI in household members, as well as occupational exposures such as care of patients with confi rmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection and contact with sick colleagues who have subsequently confi rmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009. Healthcare workers were also asked, when appropriate, how often they used either a surgical mask or N95 respirator during patient care and to estimate their average daily number of visitor and patient contacts.

Serum samples were pretreated with receptor-destroying enzyme II (Deka Seiken Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), 1:4 (vol/ vol), at 37\u00b0C for 16 h before enzyme inactivation by the addition of an equal volume of 1.6% trisodium citrate (Ajax Chemicals, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia) and incubation at 56\u00b0C for 30 min. A/California/7/2009 A(H1N1) pandemic virus was purifi ed on a sucrose gradient, concentrated, and inactivated with \u03b2-propiolactone, to create an infl uenza zonal pool preparation. Twenty-fi ve microliters (4 hemagglutination units) of infl uenza zonal pool A/ California/7/2009 virus were incubated at room temperature with an equal volume of receptor-destroying enzyme II-treated serum samples, with different wells for serum titrated in 2-fold dilutions from 1:10 to 1:1,280 in phosphate-buffered saline. After incubation of serum for 1 h, 25 \u03bcL of 1% (vol/vol) turkey erythrocytes was added to each well. HI was read after 30 min, with titers expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum in which hemagglutination was prevented. For computing geometric mean titers (GMTs), we assigned titers <10 a value of 5, and titers \u22651,280 a value of 1,280. These values were then log transformed before we computed means and associated 95% confi dence intervals (CIs). GMTs were then obtained by back transformation (17) .",

The higher seroconversion rates in nurses posted to designated pandemic (H1N1) 2009 isolation wards should be interpreted with some caution in view of the small number of seroconversion events (2 of those infected had symptoms and 2 did not) and participants (n = 17) from these wards. Since masks (either surgical or N95 masks) were widely used in all clinical areas around the hospital, this group essentially had the same level of protection as other staff while being far more intensely exposed to pandemic (H1N1) 2009. The higher risk for seroconversion for nurses on multivariate analysis also deserves notice. Nurses had higher seasonal infl uenza vaccination rates and were more compliant than other occupational subgroups in following preventive measures such as mask use. However, they also were more likely to be exposed to patients as well as to have colleagues with confi rmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009; the latter factor was signifi cantly associated with seroconversion by univariate analysis (and of borderline significance on multivariate analysis), and staff-to-staff transmission was also implicated in TTSH and elsewhere (10, 13) . Non-ward-based nurses also had higher contact rates than the other main occupational subgroup (allied health staff), a factor that we could not account for in multivariate analysis (as questions on contact rates were not answered by all participants). We also could not account for the nature of patient contacts, which might be more prolonged and intense in nurses (3) . We suggest that our fi nding of the higher seroconversion risk in nurses is the result of residual confounding by the sum of these factors, many of which are an integral part of the nursing profession. Lastly, our study suggests that nonoccupational exposures should not be forgotten as a potential source of healthcare worker infections. Other studies based on case investigations have also attributed some infections to community sources, and in our study, we found that having a child of primary school age was a risk factor on univariate analysis, particularly if that child had an FRI during the study period, although the direction of transmission in the latter could not be ascertained. Studies on nonpandemic infl uenza have found that index cases from pediatric age groups were more likely to generate secondary cases (25, 26) , although the same was not observed with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (27) . The effect of having children in the household was superseded in multivariate analysis by overall household size, which was unsurprising since households with children also tended to be larger. In any case, the signifi cance of such nonoccupational exposures should be taken into account in any hospital-level pandemic preparedness plan.",

Moreover, the unexpectedly low seroconversion rates in our cohort reduced the power of the study to investigate exposures more weakly associated with the outcome. We were also unable to assess the usefulness of personal protective equipment due to the lack of appropriate control groups. The resolution of exposure data from what was a self-administered questionnaire survey was also lower than insights that may be gained from detailed case investigations or exposure diaries that have been used in the healthcare setting (3, 11) . Finally, the lack of randomization also leaves scope for bias in our results.",

Seasonal infl uenza vaccination rates may be atypically high in TTSH because of its designated status as a fi rst-line screening and referral center; 1 study on healthcare workers from 2 other hospitals in Singapore found that only 39% of participants were vaccinated (30) . Although the low incidence of healthcare workers infections provides some suggestion that measures in place during the pandemic were effective, our fi ndings suggest that some occupation-related risk factors remain. Nurses, particularly those working in pandemic (H1N1) 2009 isolation wards, were disproportionately affected, possibly because their higher levels of protective behaviors inadequately compensated for their increased oc-cupational risk. This situation should be recognized when planning for future pandemics.",
