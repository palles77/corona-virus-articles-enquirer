As a result, the current literature reports widely varying estimates. We developed an alternative geostratified debiasing estimation framework by incorporating human mobility with case reporting data in three stratified zones, i.e., Wuhan, Hubei Province excluding Wuhan, and mainland China excluding Hubei. We estimated the latent infection ratio to be around 0.12% (18,556 people) and the basic reproduction number to be 3.24 in Wuhan before the city's lockdown on January 23, 2020. The findings based on this debiasing framework have important implications to prioritization of control and prevention efforts.",

On the contrary to Wuhan, other places in China have ample screening and treatment resources in relative terms, and started various stringent surveillance programs after the Wuhan lockdown, to screen and monitor people who travelled from Wuhan to these places. As such, the chance of under-screening and underreporting is much lower outside Wuhan, especially outside Hubei Province. Our approach stratifies mainland China into three zones, i.e., Wuhan, Hubei Province excluding Wuhan, and mainland China excluding Hubei (Fig. 1) . Incorporating data capturing the size of the population-level movement from Wuhan to the destinations in other zones with the official confirmed 2019-nCoV case counts in these destinations, we obtained a reliable estimate of the latent infection ratio, defined as the proportion of L&I persons among the population, in Wuhan before the lockdown. In turn, this estimate enabled us to derive the basic reproductive number, the number of L&I persons in Wuhan before and after the lockdown, and assess the progression of the epidemic nationally. Fig. 2A shows the relationship between the number of people traveling from Wuhan during the period of January 16, 2020 to January 22, 2020, and the number of confirmed cases in 12 representative provinces and municipalities during the period of January 23, 2020 to January 29, 2020. The lag between these two time intervals was introduced to accommodate the commonlyassumed 7-day incubation period for 2019-nCoV (3). These representative provinces and municipalities are those that had received at least 30,000 travelers from Wuhan within a threeweek window starting on January 1, 2020 and ending on January 22, 2020, prior to the lockdown.",

Based on this latent infection ratio, we inferred that there were in total 18,556 (95% CI: 14,134-22,978) L&I persons in Wuhan before the lockdown, under the assumption that this latent infection ratio remained the same for people traveling from and remaining in Wuhan.

Our R0 estimate is 3.24, indicating that on average one infected case is expected to generate 3.24 secondary infected cases prior to isolation or death. This value is within the range of that of the 2003 SARS epidemic (2-5) (8), and higher than that of influenza (2-3) (9) and Ebola (1.5-2.5) (10). Compared to the WHO's estimate (1.4-2.5) and other recently reported estimates (2.2-3.1) of 2019-nCoV (1, 3-5), our estimate is at the high end. This can be partially explained by the fact that most published estimates are based on all confirmed 2019-nCoV cases, including the Wuhan case counts, prone to the under-screening and underreporting biases. When considering the possibility of a large number of infected and infectious individuals who will not develop clinical disease, the actual value of R0 could be even higher.",

First, the previous estimates of R0 are likely to have resulted in an underestimation of the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV, mainly due to the under-reporting bias during the early phase in Wuhan. Second, the actual epidemic size in Wuhan and Hubei is larger than what has so far been reported based on confirmed case data. Third, for parts of Mainland China outside Hubei the risk of further outbreaks is likely to be limited, as long as locally occurring cases of secondary and tertiary transmissions can be detected and isolated effectively.

It is therefore paramount that available resources are used optimally. An understanding of the spatial distribution of the L&I persons is critical in this context, since they are the reservoir of clinical cases and of secondary transmission, although to a lesser extent than clinical cases.

The management of the epidemic over the coming weeks when people travel back from their hometowns to their work places will be critical for being able to bring it under control. We recommend that the national and local authorities process real-time human movement data through mathematical models to forecast the spatio-temporal dynamics of further 2019-nCoV outbreaks across Mainland China. This will allow developing early detection, isolation and quarantine strategies tailored to the very dynamic epidemiological situation, as well as identify potential problems in the implementation of local disease control policies and inform the design of any necessary adjustments.",
