An estimated 60% of known infectious diseases and up to 75% of new or emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic in origin (1, 2) . Globally, infectious diseases account for 15.8% of all deaths and 43.7% of deaths in low-resource countries (3, 4) . It is estimated that zoonoses are responsible for 2.5 billion cases of human illness and 2.7 million human deaths worldwide each year (5) . Emerging zoonoses are responsible for some of the most high profile and devastating epidemics (6) (7) (8) ; however, endemic zoonoses (9,10) may actually pose a more insidious and chronic threat to both human and animal health. As one comparison, the 2014 Ebola epidemic was responsible for 11,316 deaths and $2.2 billion in economic losses (11) , whereas each year rabies accounts for \u224859,000 human deaths and roughly $8.6 billion in economic losses worldwide (12) . The global impacts of emerging and endemic zoonoses on both human and animal populations make fostering collaboration between human and animal health sectors using a multisectoral, One Health approach a critical step toward improving animal and human health.",

The OHZDP tool enables a country or region to bring together representatives from human, animal, and environmental health sectors to prioritize the endemic and emerging zoonoses of greatest national concern that should be jointly addressed by human, animal, and environmental health ministries using country-or region-specific criteria. Zoonotic diseases can be prioritized even in the absence of reliable prevalence data by using alternative measures for disease burden so that outcomes are provided in a timely manner, enabling country representatives to give immediate feedback, develop action plans, and capitalize on collaborations built during the prioritization process.",

Voting members chose ordinal variables for all responses assigned to each criteria question. Seven (17.5%) questions had a binary response (yes/no), whereas most (82.5%) had >3 possible responses per criteria question. Regardless of the number of responses per question, all scores were normalized among criteria by using standard OHZDP tool methods (22) . A higher ordinal value (or score) was assigned to the responses for each question that correlated with a more severe, or negative, outcome. For example, a disease with a 50% case-fatality rate would receive a higher ordinal value than a disease with a 10% case-fatality rate. For questions that evaluated existing preventive measures, diagnostic capacity, and multisectoral collaboration, a higher ordinal score was given to responses indicating existing capacity or resources.

            "text": "Musings on Sketches, Artists, and Mosquito Nets James Abbott McNeill Whistler was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, on July 11, 1834. When he was 9 years of age, his family moved to St. Petersburg, Russia, and there he studied drawing at the Imperial Academy of Science.In Man at Table beneath Mosquito Net, Whistler himself might be the subject of this black ink drawing, part of a collection of such drawings from 1854 to 1855. Whistler captures the continued struggle of humans versus biting and stinging insects, including those that transmit vectorborne pathogens, from an intimate perspective.Despite the mosquitoes teeming around him, the man is able to sketch intently and without worry, sheltered by the confines of his personal impenetrable veil. The flurry of cross-hatched, finely scrawled lines in these ephemera could be seen to mimic a mosquito's flight path but this was simply a common technique that Whistler used in his sketches.Mosquito nets, particularly bed nets or sleeping nets, have, in some shape and form, been used for thousands of years. Herodotus described how people living in marshes in ancient Egypt fished with nets during the day then slept under the same nets to repel insects. Today, pyrethroid-treated mosquito nets are used extensively in malaria-endemic countries in Africa, yielding life-saving returns for little cost.The World Health Organization reported that in 2012, 207 million cases of malaria occurred, causing an estimated 627,000 deaths, mostly in children under 5 years of age. Today, another aspiring young artist working under his or her mosquito net may be sketching formative works that will someday inspire conversation and comment, and be a prelude of greater things to come, as did Whistler's Man at ",
