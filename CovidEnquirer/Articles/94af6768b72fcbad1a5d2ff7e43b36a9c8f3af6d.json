This change favored the appearance of the first eukaryotes; oxygen levels were increasing, and about 750 million years ago during the eon Phanero, there was a new event known as Neoproterozoic Oxygenation Event that led to the appearance of the first organisms multicellular (Knoll and Nowak, 2017) . On the other hand, it has been suggested that infections have been present at the same timescales through evolution. But it has been difficult to demonstrate conclusively, since no fossil elements have been found, which allow establishing the exact moment of evolution in which infectious diseases appeared throughout the evolutionary process. However, the etiological agents that produce diseases can be the result of a complex coevolutionary process. Interactions between host, infectious agents, and immunity have determined the epidemiological dynamics, which has played an important role at the evolutionary level. The coevolution of viruses and the host defense system may have been a determining factor in the evolution of both viruses and their hosts (Mideo et al., 2011) . The emergence of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases, with a high impact on morbidity and mortality throughout history, has been the result of the interaction of multiple environmental factors and the genetic pressure exerted by microorganisms and their hosts in both pathways.",

They were discovered at the end of the 19th century as pathogens of plants and animals. They are the most abundant organisms in nature, infect all known forms of cell life and are present in all the environments explored, and the repertoire of viral genes is greater than that of some eukaryotic cells (Koonin and Dolja, 2013) . Viruses have played an important role in the understanding of cell evolution, even for a long time, they have not been part of conventional biology, nor are they included in the tree of life. This has been supported, among other aspects, by their small size, intracellular nature, absence of functional translation mechanisms, lack of metabolic activity, and scarce presence of fossil records compared to cells (Nasir et al., 2012) .",

Each bracovirus and its wasps act together as a single genomic entity that shares the same evolutionary history. So that their speciation events are contemporary, therefore, to build the phylogenetic tree of DNA insect virus, age was used, based on the age of the amber fossil of the wasps belonging to the bracovirus carrying the microgastroid complex. Using this information, it was possible to establish that the ancient baculovirus, nudivirus, and bracovirus insect viruses appeared possibly 350 million years ago in the Paleozoic era in the Carboniferous period, when insects and crustaceans were already believed to have appeared 400 million years ago. It is important to note that in the carboniferous period the holometabolic insects with larval stages and complete metamorphosis appeared (Th\u00e9z\u00e9 et al., 2011) .",

When the insects evolved into new species, they provided an evolutionarily modified form of the ecological niche required for the cycle of replication of the virus, which adapted and colonized the new host. This mechanism of ecological speciation eventually produced new species of virus. In the evolutionary timescale, with the extinction of many phylogenetic lineages of the host insects and the viruses, the genes of the viruses were maintained, so a very large cophylogenetic divergence should not be expected (Th\u00e9z\u00e9 et al., 2011) . Findings on the evolution of foamy retroviruses, which have evolved with values above 100 Ma (Katzourakis et al., 2009) , suggest that common macroevolutionary scenarios affected viruses regardless of their modes of replication or origin.",

However, comparisons of RNA arbovirus sequences reveal that they are relatively stable in nature, and genetic studies suggest that strong purifying selection dominates their evolution (Holmes and Twiddy, 2003; Jerzak et al., 2005) .
