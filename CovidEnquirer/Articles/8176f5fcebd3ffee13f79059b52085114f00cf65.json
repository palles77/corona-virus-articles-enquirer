This is despite the fact that significant resources have been expended in preparing for just that eventuality, possibly at the cost of other public health initiatives [3] . The disenchantment with current preparedness led the American Medical Association to study the feasibility of developing a federal public health disaster intervention team, which would be better equipped to respond to these disasters. Although this initiative may add to the response of a recognized disaster, it would add little to an individual institution's ability to be better prepared to handle the initial presentation of a biologic disaster or a bioterrorist event.",

The inherent problem with most bioterrorism preparedness plans lies in the initial triggers that would kick the plan into action. Most clues that signal a bioterrorist event rely on unusual clustering of illness with regards to time, place, or person [4, 5] . If one waits for an automated or manual surveillance process to raise a warning about a possible clustering, the scenario exists wherein a group of contagious patients already would have been admitted to the hospital and caused exposure to other patients and health care workers. Although this syndromic surveillance mechanism is useful for its public health implications, it does not provide adequate safeguards for a hospital against the initial untoward biologic exposures.",

This readiness could be achieved by integrating the hospital's day-to-day preparedness in dealing with the threat from naturally occurring biologic agents within the context of preparedness initiative for a less likely bioterrorist event. The success of an institution's bioterrorism preparedness program would be determined by how effectively it handles the implementation of such a conjoined program to maximize the ''dual benefit'' [8] .

Some degree of decentralized operations needs to be built in so that when communications fail, the lower tier leaders could make onthe-spot decisions geared toward achieving the plan's overall goals. The plan should identify all the crucial tasks and roles that must be performed, assign responsibility for accomplishing each of these roles, and ensure that designated individuals have prepared standard operating procedures that detail how they carry out their critical tasks.

The institution needs to undertake realistic strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis to see if the plan withstands the challenge of different presentation scenarios. A multidisciplinary team should be organized to validate the functionality of the plan and should include key individuals from the emergency department, infection control, disaster management, and physical plant/engineering. This team should use the ''tracer methodology'' [11] to do a walk-around of the process of registration, triage, emergency department assessment, and admission to the hospital, exercising different scenarios of initial presentation. This process should be more than simply touring the facility; it should include taking the time to understand the physical layouts, patient flow, and security systems.

Running the ''fire drills'' tests how well the plan has been laid out and how effectively it has been communicated to the employees. The institution should let employees know they are going to test their familiarity with disaster procedures at random times, then simulate some of the scenarios set out in the plan rather than playing out the entire drill each time, recognizing that normal functioning of the hospital cannot be stopped during the exercise. The idea is to assess individual components of the preparedness plan during different shifts and to prioritize testing of the weakest link. Drills should not be intended as a test in the strictest sense, but rather as an opportunity to identify weakness; build teamwork; improve coordination; and enhance acquired skills, knowledge, and competencies. After completion of the drill, the institution should ensure a proper debriefing session facilitated by trained observers [18] , to maximize the learning opportunity, provide for constructive critique, and discuss changes that need to be implemented as a result of the exercise.",

A detailed checklist for each role, enumerating assigned responsibilities and tasks, should be incorporated as an attachment to the plan to allow for substitute personnel to fill in the role at the last minute.

This situation underscores the need for addressing issues related to surge capacity, to enable hospitals to expand beyond their normal operations to meet a sudden increase in demand that can be sustained for an extended period. To be adequately prepared, the plan should assume no outside help during the first 72 hours and count on existing staff only. This assumption would imply staff working longer hours and extra shifts and needing arrangements for overnight stay in the hospital. Medical equipment and other hospital supplies, including personal protective gear and pharmaceutical caches, would need to be stocked adequately to cater to the increased demand during this period. Ability to update hospital inventory in a real-time manner would need to be incorporated to allow sufficient notice to address continued additional demands though the strategic national stockpile. The CDC's FluSurge software program [19] could be used to estimate some of the potential increased hospital requirements during a pandemic influenza outbreak and to provide a basis for extrapolating usage in response to other biologic disasters or bioterrorist events.",

In this context, Eisenhower's dictum could be interpreted to mean that in planning for a bioterrorist threat, original plans would need to be changed to address the dynamics caused by uncertainty, but proper planning with periodic testing would go a long way in minimizing the chaos associated with this change. If after all this preparation the outlook still looks dismal, some consolation can be derived from the quote of a German officer, ''the reason the American army does so well in war is because war is chaos and the American army practices chaos on a daily basis.''",
