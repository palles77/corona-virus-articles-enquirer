The algorithm was designed to target antimicrobial therapy in systemically ill calves from on two dairy farms. Retrospective (farm 1: 529 calves; farm 2: 639 calves) and prospective (farm 1: 639 calves; farm 2: 842 calves) cohorts were examined for 12 months before and after implementation of the algorithm. The Mantel-Haenszel test and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to assess the cumulative incidence risk (CIR) and time to development of each outcome before and after implementation of the algorithm. The CIR of antimicrobial treatment rates was 80% lower after implementation of the algorithm on both farms (CIR 0.19, 95% confidence interval 0.17-0.21). There was no difference in the CIR of overall mortality, but the CRI for mortality of diarrhoeic calves was lower in the period after implementation of the algorithm on one farm. The faecal microbiota of 15 healthy calves from both farms at each time period were characterised using a sequencing platform targeting the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. On both farms, there were significant differences in community membership and structure (parsimony P < 0.001). Use of the algorithm for treatment of diarrhoeic calves reduced antimicrobial treatment rates without a negative impact on the health of calves. However, the experimental design did not take into account the potential confounding effects of dietary changes between the study periods.",

However, antimicrobial therapy may not be beneficial in many (or most) cases of calf diarrhoea (e.g. diarrhoea due to viral or parasitic infections), may result in longer recovery times (Berge et al., 2009) , and may contribute to antimicrobial resistance and environmental contamination with antimicrobial compounds (Zhao et al., 2010; Sura et al., 2014) .",

Farm environmental contamination with these antimicrobial residues could reach the gastrointestinal tract of healthy untreated calves, resulting not only in maintenance and development of antimicrobial resistance, but also producing alteration of the normal gut microbial populations (Panda et al., 2014; Schokker et al., 2015) . One approach to reduce and improve the use of antimicrobial agents on dairy farms is the application of algorithms 1 to guide the user towards a more rational course of action (Berge et al., 2009) . Simple and cost effective measures such as this could be an asset to the dairy industry to improve calf management and reduce unnecessary usage of antimicrobial agents. Therefore, the aims of the present study were to evaluate the impact of an antibiotic use algorithm on calf health (morbidity and mortality) and antimicrobial treatment rates, and to characterise the faecal microbiota of healthy calves before and after implementing the algorithm.",

No changes in management in the years before and after enrolment in the study were anticipated (e.g. expansion, new buildings or major changes in disease management practices); however, there was an unexpected change between use of milk replacer and pasteurised milk between study periods on both farms. The characteristics of farms identified in each period are presented in Table 1 . The production systems on both farms consisted of free stall housing with an automated milking system. The milking herds consisted of approximately 600 cows on farm 1 and 700 cows on farm 2. The average milk production was 10,300 kg/cow/year on farm 1 and 10,400 kg/cow/year on farm 2. Neither farm had a treatment protocol for diarrhoeic calves at the time of enrolment. Calves that developed diarrhoea on farm 1 were treated with three antimicrobial agents (trimethoprim-sulphadoxine, spectinomycin and lincomycin), while diarrhoeic calves on farm 2 were treated with one antimicrobial agent orally (sulphamethazine) and one parenterally (trimethoprim-sulphadoxine or sodium ceftiofur). Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the University of Guelph Animal Care Committee (approval number eAUP 3793).",

The outcome (survival or death) at 30 days of life was registered. When the cause of death was not registered, the following decisions were made: (1) if the calf died while being treated for diarrhoea, the death was attributed to diarrhoea; or (2) if a calf died suddenly or while being treated for another disease (e.g. pneumonia), the cause of death was not considered to be diarrhoea. In the period following implementation of the algorithm, farm staff registered the cause of death; if the cause of death was not clearly identified, a gross post-mortem examination was performed, but no additional samples were collected for laboratory examination.",

However, in our study, targeting therapy to systemically ill diarrhoeic calves resulted in lower rates of antimicrobial treatment, without a negative effect on the overall morbidity and mortality attributed to diarrhoea. Similar results have been documented in some European countries, in which the use of antimicrobial agents in farm producing animals has decreased by >50%, with a minor impact on health and productivity (Wierup, 2001; Aarestrup et al., 2010; Speksnijder et al., 2015) . Possible reasons for the lack of adverse effects include improvements in diet, including the quality and quantity of colostrum, water quality, housing and environmental conditions. Improving feed quality in pig production can contribute to reduced antimicrobial use and Table 5 Relative abundance (median in percentage and ranges) of the Families (>1%) and Genera (>2.5% of the total of sequences) identified in faeces of healthy calves from farms 1 and 2 during the before and after period.",

Poor housing conditions are an impediment to decreasing antimicrobial use in pig farms in the United Kingdom (Coyne et al. 2014 ). Improvements in housing and environment are important for prevention of disease in dairy cows (LeBlanc et al., 2006; Vaarst et al., 2006) . Changes in the behaviour of veterinarians and farmers towards the usage of antimicrobials in calves, including focussing efforts on preventative measures (e.g. optimal housing and hygiene practices, climate control, and improved feed and water quality), with the aim to enhance the health of calves and the quality of the environment, may contribute to the reduction in antimicrobial use without a negative impact on the health of calves. Differences in bacterial membership and structure of the faecal microbiota of calves in the periods before and after implementation of the algorithm were evident on both farms. Diet, pathogen occurrence, environmental factors (e.g. season) and reduction in antimicrobial treatment rates could have influenced the composition of gut microbiota and could play a role in the observed temporal changes (Jami et al., 2013; Rey et al., 2014) . Our statistical analyses used the period before and after implementation of the algorithm as the main exposure of interest. This approach meant that we could not differentiate the effects of dietary changes from the reduction in antimicrobial treatment rates on the faecal microbiota of healthy calves. The DMM analysis identified the presence of two groups of enterotypes comprising all samples from the period before and after implementation of the algorithm, respectively, irrespective of the farm of origin, and the RFC analyses had a perfect ability to separate samples into their appropriate period (0% error rate). In addition, the results of the LEfSe analyses demonstrated that the changes on faecal microbiota were similar in both farms in the period after implementation of the algorithm. These results suggest that a factor common to both farms, i.e. the reduction in antimicrobial treatment rates, may have contributed to changes in the faecal microbiota after implementation of the algorithm. Although dietary changes occurred on both farms, the nutritional source was also different between farms (the diet was changed from non-antibiotic treated pasteurised milk to non-medicated milk replacer on farm 1, while the diet was changed from non-antibiotic treated milk replacer to nonmedicated pasteurised milk on farm 2). If the dietary changes had a major role in the observed changes, the DMM would have been expected to identified enterotypes based on diet rather than period (e.g. all calves fed non-antibiotic treated pasteurised milk on farm 1 before implementation of the algorithm and farm 2 after implementation of the algorithm might be expected to be similar, and vice versa) (Holmes et al., 2012) . In addition, RFC would have been expected to assign samples to farm/period rather than to period (Knights et al., 2011) .",

The reduction in antimicrobial treatment rates and dietary changes on both farms after implementation of the algorithm were associated with decreased representation of members of the Phylum Proteobacteria (Family Enterobacteraceae and Genera Escherichia-Shigella) in the faecal flora of calves. The higher representation of Proteobacteria in healthy calves in period before implementation of the algorithm was unexpected, because enrichment with members of this Phylum has been associated with intestinal dysbiosis in other species (Costa et al., 2012; Suchodolski et al., 2012; Singh et al., 2015) , as well as diarrhoea in dairy calves (Gomez et al., 2017) . Marked differences in the faecal microbiota of healthy beef calves have been identified among farms, with some farms having Firmicutes-dominant microbiota and others Proteobacteria-dominant microbiota; in general, higher Proteobacteria levels were present on farms with high usage of antimicrobial agents (Weese and Jelinski, 2017) . These results are aligned with the hypothesis that antimicrobial agents can have a broader or cumulative impact on farms, where regular use results in the development of a particular microbiota in those calves, regardless of their individual antimicrobial exposure (Weese and Jelinski, 2017) .",

To reduce possibility of confounding, the inclusion criteria aimed to include only herds that had no plan to change treatment and prevention protocols. Although a randomised field trial with concurrent treatment arms within the same source population would have been the preferred design, its implementation was not possible because of the cost and effort required from farmers and veterinarians (e.g. farmers were willing to follow only one simple treatment protocol). Another major limitation is that the confounding effects of changes in diet between periods on both farms could not be evaluated. However, the results of statistical analyses (i.e. DMM and RFC) suggested that the reduction in antimicrobial treatment rates was the variable with the main effect on the observed changes.",
