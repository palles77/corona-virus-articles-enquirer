            "text": "Glycyrrhizin (GL) is known to have various immunomodulating activities and has long been used clinically as an antiallergic and anti-hepatitis agent. While the potency of GL against lung inflammatory diseases has been expected, the effect of GL on the lung has been poorly understood. Lung fibroblasts are known as a potent producer of inflammatory chemokines, IL-8 and eotaxin 1, by which neutrophils and eosinophils are strongly attracted during inflammation. Therefore, we studied the effects of GL on the production of these chemokines using a human fetal lung fibroblast cell line, HFL-1, stimulated with TNFa and IL-4. Moreover, we examined the structure-activity relationships of GL to explore more beneficial compounds. 18a,h-GL inhibited IL-8 dose-dependently and inhibited eotaxin 1 slightly. 18a,h-Glycyrrhetic acid (GA) did not inhibit IL-8 but inhibited eotaxin 1. The effect of 18a,h-glycyrrhetic acid monoglucuronide (MGA) resembled that of 18a,h-GL but was weaker. Both 3h-[(2-O-h-d-glucopyranuronosyl-h-d-glucopyranuronosyl)oxy]-18h-11-deoxo-olean-12-en-30-oic acid (11deoxo-GL) and 3h-[(2-O-h-d-glucopyranuronosyl-h-d-glucopyranuronosyl)oxy]-olean-11,13(18)-dien-30-oic acid (hetero-GL) exhibited inhibitory activity with significant cytotoxicity. 3h-[(2-O-h-d-Glucopyranuronosyl-h-d-glucopyranuronosyl)oxy]-18h-olean-9,12-dien-30-oic acid (homo-GL) did not have cytotoxicity but its activity was mild like that of 18a,h-GL. 3h-[(2-O-h-d-Glucopyranuronosyl-h-d-glucopyranuronosyl)oxy]-olean-11,13(18)-dien-30-ol (hetero-30-OH-GL) and 3h- [(2-O-h-d-glucopyranuronosyl-h-d-glucopyranuronosyl)oxy]-18h-olean-9,12-dien-30-ol (homo-30-OH-GL) showed potent inhib-1567-5769/$ -see front matter D itory effects, at concentrations lower than 18a,h-GL with no significant cytotoxicity. These results suggest that GL-related compounds are effective in reducing chemokine production and that GL-modified compounds including hetero-30-OH-GL and homo-30-OH-GL appear most beneficial in view of their inhibitory capacity with less cytotoxicity.

SNMC is now under clinical trial in Europe in patients with chronic hepatitis C [18, 19] . So far, GL has been demonstrated to have a variety of activities, such as the production of several cytokines, namely IFN-g [20] , IL-2 [21] , IL-12 [22] , and IL-10 [23] , and the augmentation of NK cell/NKT cell activity [24] . Also, GL administration induces anti-inflammatory, cytoprotective effects in vivo and anti-viral effects in vitro [25] . Some other pharmacological effects of GL and related compounds have been demonstrated [26] [27] [28] .",

Since no significant IL-8 and eotaxin 1 production was induced by these compounds alone (data not shown), the effects on TNF-a or TNF-a plus IL-4-induced chemokine production were evaluated.",

Both compounds exhibited similar inhibitory effects on IL-8 production in a gradual dosedependent curve. Significant inhibition was observed at more than 300 Ag/ml ( Pb0.01) and IL-8 production was reduced to 25% at 1000 Ag/ml ( Pb0.001). The cytotoxicity of 18a-GL was slightly stronger than that of 18h-GL ( Fig. 2A) with a CC 30 of 330 Ag/ml for 18a-GL vs. N1000 Ag/ml for 18h-GL (Table 1) . 18a-GL did not indicate significant effect on IL-8 mRNA expression, 18h-GL inhibited IL-8 mRNA expression moderately at 1000 Ag/ml (Fig. 2B) . On the other hand, the effects of both compounds on eotaxin 1 production and mRNA expression were rather different. 18a-GL had more of an inhibitory effect on eotaxin 1 production at a lower concentration (IC 50 =25 Ag/ml) than 18h-GL. The cytotoxicity of both compounds was mitigated in the presence of IL-4 (Fig. 2C) compared to TNF-a alone (Fig. 2A) . The actions of both compounds on eotaxin 1 mRNA expression basically paralleled the ELISA data, i.e., 18a-GL inhibited the mRNA expression slightly at 10 and 100 Ag/ml but 18h-GL did not inhibit it at the same doses (Fig. 2D ).",

In view of the structure-activity relationships among GLs, GAs, and MGAs, glucuronic acid had different effects on IL-8 and eotaxin 1 generation. 18a,h-GL inhibited IL-8 production in a gradual dose dependent manner, and 18a-GL showed inhibitory effect on eotaxin 1 production. However, mRNA level was not well correlated with the amount of chemokines. Therefore, 18a,h-GL may regulate the chemokines production also by the posttranscriptional level like at the protein secretion or degradation. Further experiments are needed to explore in more detail. When one molecule of glucuronic acid was removed from GLs, MGAs did not show significant differences in IL-8 and eotaxin 1 production, but cytotoxicity increased with a CC 30 of more than 100 Ag/ml compared with more than 1000 Ag/ml by 18a,h-GL. Moreover, when two molecules of glucuronic acid were removed from GLs, GAs indicated rather different actions on IL-8 and eotaxin 1 production. That is, while GAs did not show any inhibitory action against IL-8 production up to 10 Ag/ml, GAs showed inhibitory effect of eotaxin 1 production at less than 10 Ag/ml, with increasing cytotoxicity at more than 30 Ag/ml. The results of both IL-8 and eotaxin 1 mRNA expression at 10 Ag/ ml were not necessarily corresponded with the result of ELISA. The reasons for this remain unclear. This concentration seems to be close to the cytotoxic concentration, so the effects of GAs on the protein level or mRNA level might be unstable. Alternatively, the timing at which eotaxin 1 production starts is later than that of IL-8, so this kinetic difference may reflect the different effects of GAs. As for the stereospecificity of the C18 position, there were no great differences between 18a-and 18h-compounds except for eotaxin 1 production; 18a-GL has a much stronger effect on eotaxin 1 production than 18h-GL.",

            "text": "Second, we examined the structure-activity relationship of 18h-GL-modified compounds in group 4. Comparing the effects of 11-deoxo-GL, homo-GL, and hetero-GL which were modified at C-11 and C-18, 11-deoxo-GL and hetero-GL indicated strong inhibition at 100 Ag/ml but cytotoxicity arose simultaneously. Hetero-GL is a previously reported com- pound that has inhibitory action against HIV and herpes simplex virus replication [26] . Therefore, the pharmacological potency of hetero-GL can be expected, but we found that the range of efficacy and toxicity is narrow. We demonstrated here that the effect of homo-GL on IL-8 and eotaxin 1 production was weaker than that of 11-deoxo-GL and hetero-GL but with less cytotoxicity. As the effect of homo-GL on eotaxin 1 production, mRNA level was not correlated with the protein level. Homo-GL also may modulate eotaxin 1 production by the porttranscriptional level as well as GLs. Moreover, as for hetero-30-OH-GL and homo-30-OH-GL (group 5), modified compounds of hetero-GL and homo-GL at the C-30 position, both compounds showed moderate inhibitory activity against IL-8 and eotaxin 1 expression. That is, the IC 50 of hetero-30-OH-GL and homo-30-OH-GL against IL-8 and eotaxin 1 was lower than that of GLs and the cytotoxicity was less than that of hetero-GL. In terms of IC 50 , homo-30-OH-GL (IC 50 for IL-8 was 60 Ag/ml and IC 50 for eotaxin 1 was 12.5 Ag/ml) was superior to homo-GL. These results suggest that the reduction of the carboxyl group at C-30 may augment the inhibitory activity without changing the cytotoxicity. Taken collectively, modification of GLs at the C-11 and C-18 positions may augment the activity of GLs.",

            "text": "GL has been used widely and effectively as a treatment for chronic hepatitis [16, 19] . Furthermore, GL has been described as an anti-viral agent against many kinds of viruses, including herpes simplex virus type 1 [37] , HIV [38] , human cytomegalovirus (CMV) [39] , influenza virus [40] , SARS-associated coronavirus [29] , etc. Murayama et al. [41] demonstrated that IL-8 enhanced human CMV replication in human lung fibroblasts. Also, an elevation of IL-8 was observed in SARS patients [30] . Thus, it seems that there is a close connection between viral infection and IL-8 production in the lung. In addition, IL-8 is known as a significant attractant for inflammatory cells in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [42] . Therefore, the results of our study that GL and related compounds reduced IL-8 generation in human lung fibroblasts explain the activity of these anti-inflammatory drugs against lung diseases. Eotaxin 1 is thought to be a potent eosinophil chemotactic factor, recruiting eosinophils into the airways after allergic stimulation. This notion is supported by some in vivo experiments [9, 43] . Moreover, the correlation between eotaxin and eosinophil accumulation in bronchoalveolar lavage of asthmatic patients has been identified [44] . In this study, we demonstrated that GL derivatives had inhibitory capacity against eotaxin 1 production caused by TNF-a plus IL-4 stimulation in lung fibroblasts. These results would imply that GL derivatives could be useful as anti-allergic and antiinflammatory agents in lung eosinophilic diseases like asthma. GL also has the ability to enhance Th1 cytokines, IFN-g [20] , IL-2 [21] , and IL-12 [22] and to modulate Th2 cytokines, IL-10 enhancement [23] , or IL-4 reduction in CD4 + T cells [34] . Because the generation of eotaxin 1 is induced by IL-4 and is suppressed by IFN-g [11, 13] , GL-related compounds may improve allergic and inflammatory lung diseases not only by inhibiting proinflammatory chemokine production but also by shifting the Th1 axis. Although GL needed high doses i.e.,~1 mg/ml to inhibit IL-8 and eotaxin 1 production, we demonstrated that other GL-related compounds, especially hetero-30-OH-GL and homo-30-OH-GL, are effective at much lower doses (less than 100 Ag/ml). Thus, we assume that these compounds are more beneficial from the perspectives of their inhibitory concentration and cytotoxicity. In summary, the present study showed the inhibitory effect of GL and related compounds on IL-8 and eotaxin 1 production by human lung fibroblasts. Notably, GL-modified compounds, hetero-30-OH-GL and homo-30-OH-GL, are presumed to be good candidates with their inhibitory activity against both IL-8 and eotaxin 1 production.",
