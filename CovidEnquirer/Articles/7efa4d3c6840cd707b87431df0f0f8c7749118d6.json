Numerous CLRs belong to pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that recognize foreign pathogens, and play key roles in host immune responses [1, 2] . The type II CLRs are classified as their cytoplasmic tail (CT) located in the NH 2 terminus domain. Other type II CLRs domains include the transmembrane domain (TMD) following the CT, a single carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) exposed extracellularly at the carboxyl terminus, and the neck domain between the TMD and CRD [1, 2] .",

            "text": "A human gene cluster of type II CLRs, CD23/CLEC4G/DC-SIGN/L-SIGN, which is localized in human chromosome 19p13.3, has received increasing interest during the past few years. Human CD23 (FCER2) is a low affinity IgE receptor that plays an important role in cell-cell adhesions, B cells survival and antigen presentation [3] . Human DC-SIGN (hDC-SIGN, CD209) was initially identified as an ICAM-3 binding protein mediating dendritic cells (DCs) and T cell interaction, an ICAM-2 binding protein regulating chemokineinduced trafficking of DCs across both resting and activated endothelium, and a HIV-1 gp120 receptor mediating transmission of HIV-1 to susceptible cells in trans [4] [5] [6] . The second hDC-SIGN homologue, hL-SIGN (CD209L), was subsequently shown to have Developmental and Comparative Immunology 33 (2009) 747-760 similar but subtly distinct property of pathogen recognition to hDC-SIGN [7] . Both hDC-SIGN and hL-SIGN bind to asparagineslinked high-mannose glycans present on a broad spectrum of enveloped viruses [8] . Human CLEC4G (hCLEC4G, previously named LSECtin), co-expressed with hL-SIGN on liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cell (LSECs), is the third hDC-SIGNrelated CLR recently identified [9, 10] . hCLEC4G was found to interact with the surface glycoproteins of Ebola virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [11] . However, unlike hDC-SIGN and hL-SIGN, the hCLEC4G selectively binds to glycoproteins terminating in a disaccharide, GlcNAcb1-2Man, resulting in its interacting with truncated glycans on glycoprotein of Ebola virus [12] . Since these four CLRs form a tight gene cluster and share overall protein domain structure, similar genomic organization and possible analogous function, it has been proposed that they are derived from a common ancestor [9] .",

            "text": "DC-SIGN homologues have been experimentally identified from other mammalian species including non-human primates and mouse [13] [14] [15] . Interestingly, there exist seven mouse DC-SIGN paralogues, SIGNRs 1-5 as well as SIGNRs 7-8, on mouse chromosome 8A1.1, indicating widely divergent biochemical and probably physiological properties of DC-SIGN-related proteins in mouse [14] . However, none of these SIGNR molecules were shown to be the functional orthologue to hDC-SIGN. Recently, DC-SIGN homologues from domesticated animal species such as dog, cattle and horse have also been predicted from the completed genome projects. We recently reported the molecular cloning and characterization of the full-length cDNA and gene of porcine DC-SIGN (pDC-SIGN) in the absence of computer-based screening of DC-SIGN homologues in pig genome database [16] . Phylogenetic analysis revealed that pDC-SIGN, together with the putative bovine, canis and equine DC-SIGN, are more closely related to mouse SIGNR7 and SIGNR8 than to human DC-SIGN or other mouse SIGNR homologues and form a separate clade, indicating a distinct evolutionary pathway [16] . Since no other DC-SIGN sequences were detected in the bovine and canis genomes, the pDC-SIGN likely exists as a single gene analogously, although the relevant porcine genomic region has not been identified. Moreover, we observed that L-SIGN homologues only exist in human and non-human primates but not in other non-primate mammalian species [16] . Indeed, a previous study showed that the current L-SIGN gene, presented in apes such as chimpanzee and human but not in Old World monkeys (OWM) such as rhesus macaque, was newly duplicated from the ancestral DC-SIGN, whereas the older duplicator, CD209L2, was lost in human but still retained in OWM and apes [13] . The study indicated that the DC-SIGN/L-SIGN gene family in primates has undergone duplications and deletions during recent evolutionary processes [13] .",

Besides these two isoforms, a series of higher-molecular-weight bands were amplified (Fig. 1) , which are recognized as the intermediate products of pCLEC4G pre-mRNA during splicing (see discussion below).

Similarly, the merging of exons 3 and 4 of the canonical 9-exon-containing CLEC4G gene into one exon results in a total of eight exons for the putative human CLEC4G pseudogene. However, the loss of protein-coding ability of the human pseudogene, along with the chimpanzee CLEC4G pseudogene, is due to a point mutation (G to A) at the proposed ATG start codon (Fig. 3) . Two rhesus macaque CLEC4G homologues, CLEC4G1 and CLEC4G2, were predicted based upon the genomic sequencing data. However, in spite of the existence of nine exons, both homologues encode a carboxyl terminus-truncated protein product with CRD deletion due to a 1-nt insertion on exon 3 (for CLEC4G1) or a 1-nt deletion on exon 5 (for CLEC4G2), which are also recognized as the pseudogenes (Fig. 3) . Two CLEC4G homologues were identified in both opossum and duck-billed platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) that represents the non-placental and ancestral model animal of the mammalian species. The putative opossum CLEC4G1 contains 10 exons. The first 9 exons have a similar structure with those from the other 9exon-containing CLEC4G genes, whereas the tenth exon encodes an extra 119-aa tail at the carboxyl-terminus. The putative opossum CLEC4G2 gene, containing 7 exons, encodes a soluble protein due to lack of the deduced TMD. The platypus CLEC4G1 is a canonical 9-exon-containing gene, whereas the platypus CLEC4G2 gene has 7 exons in which only two exons (exons 3 and 4) encode the neck domain. Except for the two rhesus macaque CLEC4G pseudogenes, all identified CLEC4G homologues share an important structure feature in which the CRD always spans the last three exons. The DC-SIGN homologues in mammals identified thus far share the same feature [16] .",

All placental mammalian CLEC4Gs share a unique Ala residue distinct from DC-SIGNs at aa 233, whereas the residue at aa 237 is variable among CLEC4G homologues. All CLEC4G members share the Asp, residue instead of the conserved Asn residue, at aa 263. The conserved Asp269 of Ctype lectins is identical in most of the CLEC4G proteins but is substituted by an Asn residue in human and chimpanzee CLEC4G as well as in opossum CLEC4G1. In addition, there are 9 and 29 unique residues in the CRD shared by all mammalian CLEC4G proteins and placental mammalian CLEC4Gs, respectively (Fig. 4a) . These unique substitutions suggested that the CLEC4G family members would be expected to have different sugar-binding abilities.",

The lymph node and thymus also had a very weak pCD23 mRNA expression that was not easily visible in the gel picture (Fig. 5) .

In this study, we included rat SIGNR homologues, which has not been reported but are available from the rat genomic database, for the phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 6) . Thirteen rat SIGNR genes related to mouse SIGNRs 1-7 were found on the rat chromosome 12p12 (see discussion below), indicating that the rat SIGNR homologues are more widely presented than mouse SIGNRs. However, the pre-assumed rat SIGNR8 does not exist. Instead, six SIGNR2-related homologues, designated here as SIGNR2-R1 to -R6, were identified. Although the phylogenetic tree based upon the alignment of DC-SIGN, CLEC4G and CD23 family members did not show the evolutionary relations of these new SIGNR-related homologues, another tree generated with only mouse and rat SIGNR molecules clearly indicated that they are probably derived from SIGNR2 progressively, from SIGNR-R1 to SIGNR-R6, and that rat SIGNR7 is more close-related to SIGNR-R6 (data not shown).",

            "text": "When the coding region of pCLEC4G cDNA from pig liver was amplified, we observed the possible processing of pCLEC4G pre-mRNA characterized by the appearance of a series of highmolecular-weight PCR fragments in addition to the expected mature mRNA (Fig. 1a) . Each of these high-molecular weight PCR fragments was excised and cloned to determine the respective sequence. The sequencing results showed that these transcripts were actually splicing intermediate products of pCLEC4G mRNA precursors with the sizes of 1707, 1491, 1381 and 1176 bp, respectively. These intermediate splicing products retained various introns compared to the pCLEC4G gene (2721 bp). Based on the intron removals of these splicing intermediate products, we proposed a temporal order of the splicing pathway of pCLEC4G pre-mRNA (Fig. 7) . First, introns A, E, G and H are to be removed either simultaneously or in an order that could not be predicted from the RT-PCR result to yield an intermediate product of 1707 bp, leading to the integrities of the CRD encoded by the last three exons as well as the CT encoded by the first two exons. Further processing of the 1707-bp intermediate results in a 1491-bp pre-mRNA by splicing of the intron F. Subsequent removal of the intron D yields an mRNA that is 1381 bp. Intron C appears to be spliced at this point to yield the 1176-bp pre-mRNA that retains only the intron B. The mature pCLEC4G mRNA, detected as a 909-bp product, is produced by the removal of the intron B. The processing of pCLEC4G exons encoding the neck region appears to follow a strictly temporal and positional order by splicing of the relevant introns one-by-one, from the 3 prime exon E to the 5 prime exon B. Furthermore, exon 2 is removed from the mature mRNA product to yield an 807-bp isoform lacking the TMD. Alternatively, since the exon 2 and intron B are linked together, the isoform may be generated by simultaneous splicing of them from the 1176-bp pre-mRNA (Fig. 7) .",

It should be noted that the RT-PCR detection was done in liver, which may accurately reflect the processing pathways of these pre-mRNAs in vivo. It will be interesting to see whether the processing of the exons encoding CRD and CT domain prior to the TMD and neck region observed here could also be present in other C-type lectins such as DC-SIGN and L-SIGN. The known DC-SIGN/L-SIGN mRNA as well as the hCLEC4G isoforms identified so far exist as TMD-lacking or partialtandem-neck-repeats-lacking variants due to the skipping of the exon encoding the TMD and/or the presence of cryptic splicing sites on the exon encoding the neck region [10, 20] . This may be linked to the temporal order of the splicing in that different patterns of aberrant splicing occur during the later splicing events. Moreover, the variant neck-region tandem repeats of L-SIGN have been associated with the susceptibility of several infectious diseases such as SARS-CoV, HIV-1, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis [21] . Other factors including the quality of the donor and acceptor sites, splice enhancers or suppressors, the RNA secondary structures or the size of introns and exons may also contribute to controlling the order of intron removal [22] [23] [24] . The identification of sequential splicing intermediate products of pCLEC4G pre-mRNA in vivo may provide a good model to study how the splicing machinery selects the correct pairs of splice sites to ensure the orderly intron removal in C-type lectins, and whether these could be linked to the interactions with the pathogens.",

The third pathway with two CLEC4G duplications and/or DC-SIGN deletion followed by the inversion and rearrangement of the three-gene cluster CD23/CLEC4G1/ CLEC4G2 may lead to the formation of the current arrangement of these genes in horse (Fig. 8b ).",

In addition, the 3 0 -UTR of equine CLEC4G2 was shown to be phylogenetically more closely related to primates as mentioned before. Taken together, we speculated that primates and horses probably share an ancestral gene cluster. The later process of evolving to OWM may include the events of CLEC4G2 duplication, inversion and rearrangement, which resulted in the arising of the ancestral CLEC4G pseudogene downstream of DC-SIGN, and the events of the deletions of ancestral CLEC4Gs 1 and 3. The L-SIGN2 duplicated from the ancestral OWM DC-SIGN may emerge subsequently (Fig. 8b) . The subsequent evolutionary processes in apes and human had been described.",

The peaks in the same color indicate conserved regions within exons while the peaks in pink color denote conserved regions within introns. The cutoff value of percent identity is set to 70%. The human and chimpanzee CLEC4G pseudogenes lost their protein-coding ability due to a point mutation (G to A) at the proposed start codon. The two rhesus macaque CLEC4G pseudogenes are unable to encode functional CLEC4G proteins due to a 1nt insertion or a 1-nt deletion leading to the frame shift. The exon 4 sequence of chimpanzee CLEC4G gene is not available thus far. Abbreviations: porcine CLEC4G (pCLEC4G),",
