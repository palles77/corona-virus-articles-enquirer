In addition, WCS manages some 400 conservation projects in 60 countries around the world. The commitment to the well-being of animals in zoos and to the conservation of critical landscapes around the globe provides a unique and robust set of competencies to provide critical health care programs that work to ensure the health of people, domestic animals, and wildlife. This was clearly demonstrated in 1999, when veterinary pathologists of the WCS were the first to connect the deaths of people, wild free-ranging birds, and zoo birds to a new disease to the Western Hemisphere. With samples from the WCS wildlife health surveillance program, the disease was confirmed to be West Nile virus.",

Best theories suggest that LPAI H5N1 moved from wild birds to domestic fowl, and in 1997, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 was first identified as a disease of domestic fowl that spread to people in close contact with them in Hong Kong. The resurgence of this disease in Southeast Asia in 2004 brought a new wave of poultry and human deaths. One must study the cultural and agricultural practices in Asia to understand how this disease might mutate to a highly pathogenic form in domestic fowl, how it might spread to humans, and how it might jump back to wild migratory waterfowl. Religious practices, such as merit bird releases, bring people and passerine birds into intimate contact. The popular practice of cockfighting results in people moving these birds across vast regions and caring for injured cocks, which then results in human contact with bird blood and body fluids. It is common practice for people in rural areas to live in close proximity with their domestic animals, often times sharing room in the home or nearby. It is a typical scene to see cattle, ducks, chickens, and pigs living in or very near a family dwelling. The methods in which ducks are raised can include providing access to recently harvested rice paddies, where mixing with wild birds is commonplace. The aquatic environment is an excellent media for the persistence of viable avian influenza virus.",

The animal markets or \"wet markets\" of Asia are a mixing bowl of domestic animals, wildlife from near and far, and people. Most often, sanitation and hygiene are very poor to nonexistent, and both people and animals are under a tremendous amount of stress, lowering immuno-competency. Those in the marketplace are handling live birds and butchering others without any personal protection and often live, eat, and sleep in their shops amongst their animals for sale. This serves as an excellent environment in which pathogens can mutate and jump into novel species. While it is uncertain that civet cats were the source of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the Guangdong markets of China, it is clear they carried the disease. Since initial findings implicated civet cats, other species, such as domestic cats and fruit bats, have been shown to harbor the virus.",

Our work has demonstrated low pathogenic strains of avian influenza as far south as the Falkland Islands. In August 2005, a multi-disciplinary team comprised of FVP field veterinarians and Mongolian scientists performed field surveillance research in nine different sites along the migratory waterfowl flyway in Mongolia, including Erhel Lake, where a bird die-off was reported. At these nine sites, 850 fecal samples were collected, including 433 samples at Erhel Lake. All birds sampled were identified as to species and this information recorded. All species at a given location were identified and individuals counted so prevalence rates could be calculated. No virus was detected in live bird fecal culture samples. Six dead birds were necropsied. HPAI H5N1 was isolated from a whooper swan on Erhel Lake. The organism was isolated from samples provided to the United States Department of Agriculture ARS Poultry Laboratory in Athens, Georgia. The H5N1 isolate was determined to be a Clade II strain and selected by the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to be included in the research efforts to produce a human vaccine.",

The fact that the vast majority of birds appeared healthy and their fecal cultures were negative also suggests that the prevalence of virus is low. Further, the observation that sick birds died and one of these few animals had H5N1 raises the question as to whether the migratory birds in this surveillance project were highly competent carriers of the organism. Further work must be performed to determine if there is a species of wild bird that can carry the disease for long distances. If wild birds prove to die precipitously from the disease, then wildlife birds are not likely the source of spread for HPAI H5N1, but rather one must consider other sources for spread into domestic poultry populations. These sources could easily be domestic poultry or the vast number of animals moving through the trade in domestic animals and wildlife for meat and pets that are being placed into markets in distant and disparate sites. The most effective method of protecting people from contracting HPAI H5N1 is to educate them on proper sanitation and hygiene for themselves and their domestic poultry. Basic preventive methods such as hand washing and proper protective garb when handling poultry will greatly reduce the risk of spread to humans from animals. Killing wild birds will be an unsuccessful mitigation method. It will not halt the spread of this disease in domestic poultry and subsequently into those that are in close proximity to these animals.",

The planet clearly needs a new health paradigm that not only integrates the efforts of disparate groups but also balances their respective influences to help bridge the gaps between them. This is especially so since the immediate effects of a particular illness are often the least of the problem.

Or consider the Ebola virus, which has a similar history. The disease first came to international attention in 1976, when it appeared around the Ebola River in what was then called Zaire. The virus infects people, gorillas, chimpanzees, and monkeys, causing severe internal and external hemorrhaging and leading to death in up to 90 percent of its human victims. Human infection spreads quickly, especially via caregivers and people who flee an area to escape the illness. Since the disease first appeared, succes-sive human outbreaks have been recorded in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Gabon, Sudan, and Uganda. But humans have not been the only victims; lowland gorillas and chimpanzees in Gabon and Congo and chimpanzees in western equatorial Africa have been decimated by the sickness. Other forest animals, such as duikers (small antelopes) and bush pigs may also be affected. When subsistence hunters discover a sick or dead animal in the forest, they view it as good fortune and bring it home to feed their families or trade with their neighbors. The Ebola virus then easily infects those handling the meat, and a chain of contacts and infections ensue. Each of the human outbreaks in central Africa during the late 1990s and the first years of this century was traced to humans handling infected great apes.",

Although modern factoryfarm practices maximize food production, they also make livestock more susceptible to illness. Infection spreads quickly through crowded animal pens, and growing antibiotic resistance makes fighting disease more difficult.

The Nipah virus appeared in the country's pig and human populations in 1998, killing 105 people and forcing the Malaysian government to cull more than 1 million pigs to stop the spread. Five species of fruit bats were also found to carry the virus, suggesting a wide prevalence of the pathogen among healthy bats. It seems that people acquired the virus from handling infected pigs, which contracted the disease from bats feeding in fruit trees standing in newly developed pig farms.",

The report of the U.S. National Intelligence Council's 2020 Project, \"Mapping the Global Future,\" has identified a global pandemic as the single most important threat to the global economy. In early 2003, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization reported that more than one-third of the global meat trade was being embargoed as a result of mad cow disease, avian influenza, and other livestock illnesses. According to Bio Economic Research Associates, the rash of emerging or re-emerging livestock dis-eases that have cropped up around the world since the mid-1990s (illnesses that include mad cow disease, foot-and-mouth disease, avian influenza, swine fever, and others) has caused losses of an estimated $100 billion; SARS alone cost the global economy half that amount. The pain caused by such crises, moreover, has spread far beyond those responsible; wildlife market traders were not the ones who paid for the SARS outbreak, and the African rodent importer in Texas did not reimburse the United States and local governments for the millions of dollars spent to contain monkeypox in 2003.",

Since 2003, for example, efforts to control the spread of avian influenza in Asia have required the culling of more than 140 million chickens. In countries such as Thailand and Vietnam, the vast majority of these animals were not owned by large, industrial producers, but by small farmers and peasants. Losing their livestock was painful indeed, especially since financial compensation schemes for rural poultry owners are rare to nonexistent in much of Southeast Asia. Not only did this lack of compensation increase the damage done by the disease; it also created a serious disincentive for bird owners to report suspicious illnesses among their flocks.",

In much of the world, reducing disease in domestic animals would benefit several industries, improve human health and livelihoods, and help safeguard wild animals. As this suggests, strategically increasing protections in one area of health care can benefit another. For example, gorillas and chimpanzees in central Africa have little to no immunity to common human diseases, and so they are endangered by contact with local people and tourists. This risk could be dramatically reduced by implementing good preventive health programs and practices in local villages, which would benefit both people and wildlife. Already, work with the Ebola virus in gorillas and chimpanzees has shown that investments in wildlife health can protect urban human populations; in Africa, animal health workers detected the presence of Ebola in wildlife months before the first human cases occurred, providing critical lead-time to warn villagers not to hunt or handle the animals that were a source of the infection. Such a broad, \"one health\" approach to disease can be much more effective and inexpensive than the traditional \"quarantine and stamping out\" strategy for fighting an illness after an outbreak has already begun. Specialists in human and animal health, in conjunction with wildlife conservation professionals, have already developed a set of guiding concepts on these themes, called the Manhattan Principles. But the ideas still need much broader acceptance to be more effective.",

To begin with, better worldwide surveillance to detect infectious diseases among wildlife is needed to improve response time and reduce the costs of new outbreaks. Such surveillance differs from traditional hypothesis-driven disease research because it involves very broad searching rather than attempts to answer a highly focused question. Investment in gathering advance information can pay off handsomely; early warning of how diseases work and of their normal characteristics among animals can help limit the damage when the illnesses start to spread.",

For example, under its agreement with member states, the World Animal Health Organization cannot accept information on wildlife diseases in a country unless that information has been submitted officially by a national agricultural authority -few of which are mandated or organized to monitor wildlife diseases. These policies should be reformulated to facilitate cooperation among governments, corporations, and nonprofit organizations, and formal mechanisms for sharing information should be established.",
