            "text": "By combining molecular-biological techniques with our increased understanding of the effect of gene sequence modification on viral function, yellow fever 17D, a positive-strand RNA virus vaccine, has been manipulated to induce a protective immune response against viruses of the same family (e.g. Japanese encephalitis and dengue viruses). Triggered by the emergence of West Nile virus infections in the New World afflicting humans, horses and birds, the success of this recombinant technology has prompted the rapid development of a live-virus attenuated candidate vaccine against West Nile virus. Yellow fever live-attenuated vaccine YF 17D vaccine strain was developed 65 years ago by empirical methods, which included a substantial passage history 16 . The vaccine is used for wide-scale immunization of children in tropical areas, travelers and military personnel. This long experience in >350 million people has provided assurances of safety and efficacy, making yellow fever an ideal vector for foreign genes. However, there are disadvantages to this practice. As with any other positive-strand virus, the high rate of genetic variation caused by viral replication by polymerases without proofreading enzymes and mutations involved in adaptation to different host cells could lead to unexpected surprises. Replacing the structural genes of YF 17D with those of other flaviviruses might alter tropism, and the potential of replication in unanticipated tissues will have to be examined individually. On the other hand, a significant advantage of a live vaccine includes the development of rapid and durable HUMORAL and cell-mediated immune responses that closely mimic those directed against the wild-type virus. 21 , there are insufficient data to recommend the use of the JE-VAX\uf6da to protect humans and horses. The development of the WN vaccine followed the path drawn by the development of a live-attenuated YF-JE chimeric vaccine (ChimeriVax-JE) 13, 22 . The same two-plasmid system used to develop ChimeriVax-JE was utilized by replacing the sequences for the JE prM and E genes with those of the WN NY-99 strain virus (Fig. 1) . The resulting VIRION has the envelope of WN, containing structures involved in virus-cell attachment and virus internalization, all antigenic determinants for neutralization, and epitopes for T-cell mediated immunity. The capsid protein, nonstructural proteins and non-translated termini (UTR) responsible for virus replication remain those of YF 17D vaccine. Like ChimeriVax-JE, the chimeric YF/WN virus replicates in tissue culture to titers in excess of 7 log 10 plaque-forming units (PFU)ml \u22121 . The chimeric virus is expected to replicate efficiently in the host as well as provide protective immunity against WN virus.",

CYTOTOXIC T CELLS eliminate viruses that were able to establish intracellular infections. This defense mechanism recognizes the E protein as well as nonstructural proteins, making infected cells a target for cell killing 23 . Exposure to the virus by natural infection post-vaccination would lead to a rapid secondary response, stronger than the primary response, and increased cross-reactivity with other members of the Flavivirus genus encoding similar epitopes. Studies in mice 24 and monkeys 25, 26 were conducted to determine the ability of ChimeriVax-JE vaccine to protect animals against challenge. Challenge of both immunized and control monkeys with JE virus was performed by an intracerebral (IC) inoculation of 5 log 10 PFU. Natural JE infection occurs by peripheral inoculation of small doses of virus in mosquito saliva; it was estimated by in vitro methods that a female mosquito releases about 2 log 10 PFU while blood feeding 27 . Typically, rhesus monkeys do not develop brain infection and encephalitis after peripheral JE virus inoculation. The IC inoculation disease model is thus used in vaccine efficacy tests.",

Flavivirus genome replication lacks proofreading activity, resulting in a significant rate of mutations. For example, one single codon alteration from GAA (glutamic acid) to AAA (lysine) in the envelope protein gene markedly reduced the virulence of a JE virus isolate 28 . To study the genetic stability of a ChimeriVax vaccine construct, the virus was passed six times in brain tissue of mice and up to 18 times in cell culture. For ChimeriVax-JE, the vaccine genome and attenuated phenotype were shown to be stable on passage 24 . The molecular basis of attenuation of ChimeriVax-JE vaccine was studied by systematic mutagenesis 22 . Neurovirulent JE strains and attenuated JE strains were compared by sequence analysis, and amino acid residues in the prME sequence of the vaccine that were implicated in virulence were reverted. The elucidation of multiple attenuation determinants in the E gene provided a rationale for the development of a chimeric WN vaccine.",

The live-attenuated JE SA14-14-2 vaccine is used only in China and possesses an excellent safety record 29 . The basis of attenuation lies within the genome sequence of these RNA viruses. Sequence changes affect the phenotype by altering the function of the gene products, the secondary structure integrity of the RNA molecules, or both. The effect of the sequence of the prME genes of JE on its virulence phenotype was revealed following mouse studies that compared ChimeriVax-JE with a corresponding neurovirulent YF/JE Nakayama construct 13 . The study showed lack of neurovirulence for ChimeriVax-JE relative to the Nakayama construct or to a YF 17D vaccine control.

WN virus is a member of the JE antigenic complex, a subgroup of very closely related flaviviruses defined by cross-neutralization 30 . The sequence similarity of the E protein of WN and JE is shown in Fig. 2 . Because of the high degree of similarity, it is hypothesized that the introduction of mutations linked to the attenuation of JE SA14-14-2 will also attenuate ChimeriVax-WN. For ChimeriVax-WN, the approach will be to systematically mutate the sequence of the wild-type WN NY99 strain E protein to assess the effect of single mutations at the equivalent of residues E138, 107, 176 and 279. Additional mutagenesis targets could be considered from the outcome of other Flavivirus studies. Mutations in the vicinity of E315 are associated with altered virus tropism and changes in virulence [31] [32] [33] . Position E244 might not play a significant role as it is either a glycine (G) or glutamic acid (E) in several virulent JE strains analyzed 34, 36 . Position E439 represents a conserved K\u2192R substitution in the transmembrane region of the E protein with very little chance of any major effect. A tyrosine (Y) at position E176 (Table 1 ) might contribute to the attenuation of ChimeriVax-WN in its present configuration. The hypothesis will be tested by targeted mutation of E176 to isoleucine and testing for an increase in neurovirulence. Eventually, combinatorial mutation studies will define an attenuated vaccine.",

Young adult mice (five per group) inoculated IC with graded doses between 2 and 6 log 10 PFU resulted in scattered deaths (ranging from 20-60% mortality) without a clear dose effect, perhaps owing to the susceptibility of the model used. By contrast, YF 17D was 100% lethal at doses >1 log 10 PFU in the same mouse model. In addition, ChimeriVax-WN has lost the NEUROINVASIVE property typical of wild-type WN. Virus replication in brain tissue or viremia levels in moribund animals was not measured. However, the average survival times (nine days) were similar for both viruses. The data suggest that the sequenceunmodified chimera might be a vaccine candidate. Ultimately, the safety of a live attenuated ChimeriVax-WN will rely on sequence stability of the genome particularly at the E protein amino acid positions identified to play a role in attenuation.",

Fort Dodge Animal Health (USA) has initiated development of both a formalin-inactivated and a DNA plasmid vaccine for horses. The DNA technology was developed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Ft. Collins (CO, USA) and a study in horses at Colorado State University demonstrated protection against virus challenge 35 . Lustig et al. produced a live attenuated WN virus isolate derived from empirical passage of a wild-type strain in Aedes aegypti mosquito cells. One dose of the attenuated virus showed 100% protection in both mice and geese IC inoculation disease models challenged with a homologous wild-type WN (Ref. 37) . A formalin-inactivated WN vaccine should work as effectively as JE-VAX\uf6da against JE. However, requiring multiple doses for efficacious protection, this vaccine would not be beneficial in an immediate threat of epidemic disease. A DNA vaccine for expression of WN prME genes only might be protective for horses but is likely to require multiple doses. Considering the possibility of a spontaneous virulent reversion owing to the relatively high mutation rate of RNA viruses, a live attenuated fulllength WN vaccine is not as safe as the WN prME DNA vaccine. Furthermore, the WN prME DNA vaccine will produce antibodies only against the WN Identical and conserved residues are shown in blue and green, respectively. A 77% identity was predicted by CLUSTAL W alignment. Red arrows map the location of ten amino acid residues that distinguish virulent JE Nakayama strain E protein (see Table 1 ).",

The most promising candidates for a human vaccine include an 'old technology' formalin-inactivated virus vaccine, and a live chimeric vaccine where a rational approach is used to create a safe recombinant vaccine. A live vaccine that rapidly elicits immunity after a single dose would be much preferred over a multi-dose product for use in an impending epidemic, as surveillance of birds and mosquitoes provides only a brief warning of virus activity before the risk of human disease. The ecology of WN virus in the western hemisphere is still evolving. At least five species of mosquitoes were found to be competent vectors in experimental transmission studies with the WN NY99 strain 18 . Further understanding of the basic transmission cycle of WN in birds and mosquitoes is needed to implement proper control mechanisms. Ultimately, clear definition of the risks associated with WN virus epidemics might help create sufficient preventive measures to avoid the use of a vaccine. In the meantime, for as long as outbreaks continue to occur predominantly in urban areas where media attention is so ubiquitous, and with a system that relies on sightings of dead crows to forecast a potential WN epidemic, the need to develop a vaccine will continue.",
