Rather than continuing slow evolution of tweaking of sludge treatment, the authors believe there are existing technologies that provide a new approach to sludge treatment.",

            "text": "The history of sewage sludge treatment and disposal can be viewed as a game of playing catch-up with the regulations. In 1988, Congress passed the Ocean Dumping Ban Act, essentially mandating that all sewage sludge disposal be land-based. The Clean Water Act was amended in 1993 with Code of Federal Regulations Title 40 Part 503 to regulate the use and disposal of treated sewage sludges (U.S. EPA, 1994) . Land application of Class B sludges (i.e., treated sludges that still contain pathogens) on agricultural fields was encouraged under the idea that organics in the sludges would promote soil stabilization, enrich soils, and enhance crop growth. However, land application, by which 55% of sludge is disposed, continues to face setbacks ranging from public tolerance for odor to public health and environmental concerns stemming from presence of non-regulated metals and contaminants of emerging concern (CECs). Alternatives to land application include landfill disposal (30% of sludge) and incineration (15% of sludge) (Peccia and Westerhoff, 2015) . Incineration poses human toxicity concerns associated with releasing heavy metals and particulates into the air (Hong et al., 2009 ). Thus, for treated sludges with high metal or CEC content, landfilling is increasingly the only remaining disposal method. These sludges are subject to municipal and hazardous waste landfill regulations set forth by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). (40 CFR 261, 2011) Landfilling faces several drawbacks -specifically, space is limited due to the growing strain of urbanization, leading to increased cost of hauling to distant locations. Additionally, there is public distaste towards landfill odor, and environmental concerns regarding the release of greenhouse gases and the potential for groundwater contamination from the leachate.

            "text": "Wastewater treatment technology has adapted to increasing regulations and concerns regarding the effects of disposal on aquatic life and water reuse applications. Activated sludge technology to reduce biological oxygen demand was first implemented in the mid-20th century. In the 1960s, chemical phosphorous precipitation was added, followed by biological treatment trains with nitrification, denitrification, and enhanced biological phosphorous removal (EBPR). These modifications produced higher quality effluents and increased viability for reuse; however, the biological processes also produce large volumes of low density (98% water) biological solids, chemicals, and inert particles associated with the lipid-rich bio-cellular materials. This ultimately results in a longer solids retention time (SRT) for sludge stabilization during anaerobic digestion, up to 30 days. These very long SRTs result in large reactor volumes with high capital costs and consequently only become economically viable for larger utilities (i.e., WWTPs that serve populations on the order of >100,000) (Peccia and Westerhoff, 2015) .",

Anaerobic digestion has been used since the early 1900s and is one of the most popular sludge stabilization technologies. In the absence of oxygen, organic compounds and cells break down to produce biogas (65-70 vol% of methane, CH 4 , 30-35 vol% CO 2 ). A 56-65.5% reduction in volatile suspended solids (VSS) occurs after a SRT between 15 and 30 days (depending on the operating temperature of the reactor). Aerobic digestion (i.e., in the presence of oxygen) can also stabilize sludges, but it does not allow for energy recovery, and the resulting sludge has poor dewaterability. Stabilized sludges are only 5-10 wt% dry solids and must be mechanically dewatered to 25-35 wt% dry solids using centrifuges and belt presses prior to disposal in order to reduce volume and mass for transportation (Appels et al., 2008; Metcalf and Eddy, 2013) .",

            "text": "It is worthwhile to consider shifting the perspective of WWTPs from being waste treatment and disposal facilities to resource recovery facilities. Human-generated wastes consist of most everything used to nourish health and livelihood -metals, nutrients, organics, and more. Rather than disposing these items and investing time, money, and labor to produce and mine additional resources, society will benefit by seeking more sustainable practices that reuse and recycle these resources. The contents of sludges is a matter of perspective -metals, nutrients, and organics can be viewed as hindering waste disposal or as opportunities for resource recovery, recycling, and sustainability. The goal of this paper is to identify and evaluate alternate sewage sludge treatment trains to enable energy and metal recovery. Thermochemical processes and liquid solvents are explored for their potential to convert biomass into reusable forms while simultaneously destroying CECs without releasing harmful pollutants. Specifically, hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), a thermal process adapted from the algae biofuel industry, is unique in that it can directly convert liquid biomass to energy in the form of bio-oil, thereby avoiding energy and costs associated with sludge dewatering. The technology occupies a minimal land footprint and operates 100 times faster than anaerobic digestion. The dry mass of the HTL product is half of the initial reactants, which will substantially reduce costs for hauling and disposing biosolids, and metals and nutrients are concentrated within this small remaining mass. As such, the remainder of this review identifies techniques adapted from the mining industry to extract these resources (metals and nutrients) for financial gain.",

Metals 40 CFR Part 503 established ceiling concentrations for 10 metals in land-applied biosolids (As, Cd, Cu, Cr, Pb, Hg, Mo, Ni, Se, Zn) (U.S. EPA, 1994). However, Cr was removed from the list in 1995 because: (1) Cr appeared primarily in the less toxic, trivalent form rather than the toxic hexavalent form, and (2) field data did not show Cr toxicity to plants at the cumulative loading concentrations (60 Federal Register 206, 1995) . RCRA established limits on 8 metals in landfilled solid waste using the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Potential (As, Ba, Cd, Cr, Pb, Hg, Se, Ag) ( Table 1) (40 CFR 261, 2011) . There is a wealth of data for concentrations of these metals in sewage sludges in North America, Europe, and Asia (Pathak et al., 2009) . Less is known about non-regulated metals such as posttransition and precious metals (Au, Pt, Pd, Te, Bi, Sb, In) used in electronics and platinum group metals (Pt, Pd, Rh) used in chemical, petroleum, and glass industries, jewelry, dentistry, and car catalysts (Chancerel et al., 2009; Saurat and Bringezu, 2009) . Recent breakthroughs in nanotechnology have led to metallic nanoparticles incorporated in foods (Ag, TiO 2 , Si, Pt), textiles (Ag), and medicine (Au, Si) (Chaudhry and Castle, 2011; Gao and Cranston, 2008; Marchesan and Prato, 2013) . WWTPs remove these nanoparticles effectively from the liquid effluent and accumulate them within sludges (Westerhoff et al., 2013) . Engineered nanomaterials may be detrimental to the environment if disposed on land, therefore identifying methods to limit their entrance into the environment is desirable (Gottschalk et al., 2013) .",

In a separate survey, sludges across the United States were analyzed for 58 regulated and non-regulated elements and were found to have heavy metals (Al, Ba, Cr, Fe, Mn, Sn, Ti) and precious metals (Ag, Au, Pd, Pt, Rh, Ru) in addition to Part 503 regulated metals. The metals all had enrichment factors above unity, indicating likely anthropogenic sources rather than dust or soil . Internationally, metal content of sludge ash postincineration has also been evaluated. In Germany, Si, Ca, Fe, and Al were found in abundance, followed by Zn, Mn, Ba, Cu, Sr, Cr, Pb, and Zr (Kruger et al., 2014) . Rare earth element concentrations were calculated for sewage sludge ash in Japan and found to be enriched with Sm, Eu, Tb, Sc, and Gd and slightly enriched by La and Ce (Zhang et al., 2001) . Table 2 compares metal concentrations in sewage sludge from the United States, India, and South Africa with sludge ash from Germany and Japan. For nearly all reported metals, incineration increases the metals concentration by up to one order of magnitude. This is likely because incineration reduces the dry mass of solids by more than 65% (Williford et al., 2007) .",

The metals recovery processes for sludges could be modeled after current recycling programs for glass, paper, and aluminum. In 2013, 1.95 million tons of Al were mined from ore in the United States, and 1.44 million tons were recovered from scrap (Lee Bray, 2014) . Using values presented in Table 2 , 336,000 tons of Al could be recovered globally from sludge, and 150,000 tons could be recovered within the United States (4.4% of total Al produced). For gold, a high commodity metal, mining from ore produced 2.77 million tons (George, 2014) . In comparison, extraction from global sludges can recover 18 tons of Au. The mass is <0.00065% of total Au mined, but it is valued at $20.5/ton of sludge (December 2015 price for pure gold $34,277.66/kg). Resource recovery calculations assume 1.2 billion people living in developed countries generate 30 million tons of Table 1 Metal concentrations and loading rates for land-applied and landfilled sewage sludges. Ceiling concentrations are the maximum allowable concentrations of metals in landapplied sludges. Cumulative pollutant loading rates are the maximum allowable concentrations of metals applied over the lifetime of a sludge disposal site. Regulatory levels are maximum concentrations of contaminants in municipal landfills obtained by the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure.",

Wastewater phosphorous concentration can be between 4 and 16 mg/L (Rittmann et al., 2011) . Half of this phosphorous integrates into the cellular biomass of sludges, while the other half discharges into waterways from the WWTPs. Phosphorous concentrations in wastewater effluent disposed to surface waters is limited to less than 2 mg/L across the United States to deter eutrophication. Common treatment processes to achieve these limits are chemical precipitation with iron and biological phosphorous removal. Both approaches accumulate phosphorous in sludges. Phosphorous bound to iron oxides is generally not bio-available to plants and is difficult to recover, but biologically sequestered phosphorous remains bio-available and may be easier to recover upon cellular oxidation. EBPR processes, which stimulate growth of bacteria likely to uptake phosphorous, currently operate at full scale and enhance phosphorous removal compared against conventional activated sludge treatment processes. EBPR increases sludge phosphorous concentrations from 0.02 to 0.06-0.15 mg/ mg VSS. This increased sludge phosphorus concentration coupled with the potential for land-applied treated sewage sludges to be subject to erosion and runoff can amplify phosphorus exposure in the environment (Rittmann et al., 2011; Wentzel et al., 2008) .",

Because ammonia can be toxic to aquatic life due to its oxygen consumption, nitrogen can be a nutrient to algae and cause eutrophication, and nitrate can cause blue-baby syndrome within infants, wastewater treatment processes must reduce concentration of nitrogenous compounds within the liquid waste effluent. Biological nitrification converts ammonia to nitrate, and the nitrifying bacteria settle through sedimentation, increasing the mass of sludge produced. Ultimately, 2.4-6.7% of the activated sludge dry mass consists of nitrogen (i.e., 24-67 g N/kg dry solids), and the remaining N is denitrified to become N 2 gas (Sedlak, 1991; Shammas and Wang, 2007) .",

Antibiotics are particularly scrutinized as they can increase the risk of antibiotic resistance through genetic mutation or gene transfer. Antibiotics and their metabolites enter sewage through feces, urine, or direct medication disposal and will ultimately enter the environment if not removed during sewage treatment. In particular, pharmaceuticals classified as fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, and sulfonamides can be taken up by flora (McClellan and Halden, 2010) . A Swedish study (Lindberg et al., 2005) showed two fluoroquinolones, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, were present in all 10 samples collected from five different treatment plants at concentrations between 0.1 and 4.8 mg/kg (dry weight). The adsorption of these antibiotics to the sludge during treatment was 87% (Lindberg et al., 2005) . Average concentrations for these fluoroquinolones in sludges in the United States were 6.8 and 0.42 mg/kg for ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, respectively (Golet et al., 2002; McClellan and Halden, 2010) . Other CECs found in sludges to date are brominated flame retardants (BFRs), perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and alkylphenol ethoxylates (APEO). BFRs can persist in soil for at least 3 years, PFAS are resistant to biodegradation, and APEO metabolites have been shown to mimic hormones and can induce endocrine disruption within organisms exposed to the contaminant. These CECs are dangerous when released into the environment as their inability to completely decompose can lead to spreading within soil, air, and water and can bioaccumulate in microbes and animals Halden, 2014, 2013a,b) .",

There is an immediate need for new technologies that will convert wastewater treatment plants to resource recovery centers. Guided by the three pillars of sustainability (economy, environment, and society), resource recovery creates economic opportunities, limits reintroduction of hazardous metals and CECs into the environment when solids are disposed, and potentially reduces public concerns related to odors emanating from sludges or ''not in my backyard\" apprehension for siting incineration facilities. Instead, metals will be recycled for reuse and economic gain and CECs will be destroyed. Resource recovery technologies can be inspired by and adapted from fields outside of conventional treatment such as the algal biofuel, petroleum, and mining industries. This paper proposes several existing sludge treatment alternatives within the categories of thermal processes and liquid solvent application prior to precipitation or adsorption/extraction of the valuable products. Additionally, results are presented for bench-scale evaluations of HTL, a thermal treatment process. Table 3 summarizes the thermal and liquid solvent processes discussed in this review for sludge treatment and resource recovery. The advantages and disadvantages are outlined in terms of energy use, cost, products, and feasibility for sludge application.

While several thermal technologies (e.g., pyrolysis, combustion, gasification) require dry biomass to maximize energy recovery potential, HTL operates with 5-30% solids. The avoided dewatering and drying costs significantly reduce energy use relative to pyrolysis and other conventional high temperature processes. HTL is all-encompassing, simultaneously achieving multiple sludge stabilization goals by increasing dewaterability, decreasing mass of the reaction product, and removing harmful pathogens and pollutants. Therefore, it is evaluated in depth for its potential to follow and even replace anaerobic digestion. In HTL, liquid biomass reacts at a high temperature (250-350\u00b0C) and pressure (10-15 MPa), causing cells to lyse and proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates to break down into reactive molecules in the solvent (e.g., water, acetone, ethanol) and to repolymerize into oily compounds (Zhang et al., 2010) . The four products of HTL are bio-crude oil, a solid residue termed biochar, an aqueous component containing water soluble compounds, and CO 2 gas. The biochemical composition of the biomass influences bio-oil yield and follows the trend lipids > proteins > carbohydrates (Biller and Ross, 2011) . HTL has been used to deactivate antibiotic resistant genes and remove bioactive compounds such as estrone, florfenicol, and ceftiofur in Spirulina algae and swine manure (Pham et al., 2013) .",

HTL efficiency can be compared to anaerobic digestion by calculating the loading rate. With a conservative estimate of 1 gram of solid reacting in a 300 mL vessel for 30 min, the equivalent loading rate is 160 kg/m 3 /day, or 100 times more efficient than the anaerobic digestion solids loading rate of 1.6-4.8 kg VSS/m 3 /day (Metcalf and Eddy, 2013) .

Approximately 60-80% of each element concentrated within the bio-char fraction, the bio-oil fraction contained less than 7% of each metal, and the remaining percentage was unaccounted for within the pyrolyzed mass. Elsewhere, similar results were seen for Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb undergoing liquefaction with acetone or ethanol (Leng et al., 2015 (Leng et al., , 2014 ). Fig. 3 shows concentrations of RCRA and 40 CFR Part 503 regulated metals from this work. Fig. 4 shows concentrations of all other metals present at concentrations higher than two times the detection limit of the ICP-MS. The authors hypothesize that significant volatilization is seen for arsenic due to biological formation of methylated arsenic species from organoarsenicals (arsenic ions reacted with carbon). The boiling points of these species vary between 128 and 215\u00b0C, indicating that volatilization is possible at 300\u00b0C (Smithsonian Institution, 1873). In separate work, phosphorous phase partitioning in algae was similar to this study's sludge experimental data; 80% of P in algae went to the aqueous phase after HTL at 250\u00b0C.

Oxidation creates hydroxyl and peroxide radicals that transform complex organics to low molecular weight carbon compounds and simultaneously destroy CECs and pathogens. WCO converts 99% of biomass to CO 2 , H 2 O, and non-hazardous byproducts, without producing hazardous byproducts such as nitrous oxides, sulfur oxides, dioxins, furans, and ash. Chemical oxygen demand is reduced by 15%. An additional advantage over incineration is its ability to operate using aqueous phase biomass, making it an ideal application for sewage sludge (Fytili and Zabaniotou, 2008; Hii et al., 2014) . Oxidation can potentially leach metals from sludge and the HTL bio-char product. In the mining industry, refractory ores with a high carbon content require a pre-oxidation step to assist with releasing tightly bound metals (Marsden and House, 2006) . Given that sludge also has a high organic content and that 35-70% of metals are present in the oxidizable phase of the bio-char, oxidation can be used to liberate metal ions and colloids that may be firmly bound to the solids (Fig. 1) .",

The Soxhlet extraction technique, which can use chloroform, methanol, or toluene, has been successfully demonstrated on sewage sludges by extracting 12 wt% lipids (Boocock et al., 1992) . These polar solvents target the polar heads of the phospholipid membranes in sludge microorganisms (Dufreche et al., 2007) .

Oxidizing agents such as nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide decompose complex organic material into carbon dioxide. In fact, the BCR sequential extraction procedure, which was used by Yuan et al. to identify speciation of metals after HTL, uses nitric acid, perchloric acid, and hydrogen peroxide in its final step to extract metals still bound to organics after the initial three extractions (acetic acid, hydroxylammonium chloride at pH 2, and hydrogen peroxide followed by ammonium acetate at pH 2) (Yuan et al., 2011) . However, this process is likely to completely remove all organic content from char and produce acid waste that is difficult to dispose.

New resource recovery centers can improve environmental quality by eliminating hauling of biosolids for land application, which will decrease carbon dioxide emissions and ensure hazardous materials are not reintroduced to the environment. Westerhoff et al. determined that for a community of 1 million people, metals in biosolids are valued up to $13 million per year. Extracting the 13 most valuable elements (Ag, Cu, Au, P, Fe, Pd, Mn, Zn, Ir, Al, Cd, Ti, Ga, and Cr) from sewage sludges could amount to a relative potential economic value of $280/ton of sludge produced. Nitrogen in sludges amounts to $24/ton of sludge, while phosphorous is valued at $7/ton of sludge (Peccia and Westerhoff, 2015; Westerhoff et al., 2015) . These extracted elements would return directly into society for reuse, ensuring minimization of waste and maximization of resources. Society pays to keep the environment clean by funding municipal solid waste programs, including recycling and reuse of glass, aluminum, and plastic. For example, a 2016 notice of beverage container recycling processing fees in California shows that recycling bimetal cost of $677.40/ton is an order of magnitude greater than the scrap value of $53.37/ton. Glass had no monetary recycling value -it cost $99.97/ton to process, and in turn the scrap value paid to recyclers amounted to negative $1.10 (Smithline, 2015) .",

Novel thermal processes and liquid solvent technologies described herein can eliminate the need for anaerobic digestion and significantly reduce capital costs for land. In terms of sludge loading, HTL is 100 times faster than anaerobic digestion (see Section 3.1.1), thereby decreasing SRT for sludge stabilization, energy production, and resource concentration. Recovery will also contribute to decreased cost. These benefits outweigh initial capital costs for installation of new HTL and oil processing technologies ($$450 million for 440,000 tons/yr reactor) and further operation and maintenance (O&M) costs ($$60/ton, estimate adapted from algae biofuel analysis) (Jones et al., 2014) .
