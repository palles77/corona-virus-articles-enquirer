Methods: From August through December 2009, 964 symptomatic adult outpatients were included. RT-PCR was used to detect the following pathogens: influenza A (H1N1) and B, parainfluenza 1e4, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, human coronavirus (OC43, 229E, NL63), Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella species. The Dutch GHOR, American CDC and WHO, and British HPA case definitions were evaluated. Results: A respiratory pathogen was detected in 41% of tested patient samples; influenza A (H1N1) and human rhinovirus were both detected in 16%. Clinical presentation of influenza cases was significantly more serious when compared to rhinovirus or negative-tested cases. Test characteristics were almost similar for all 4 case definitions, with an average sensitivity of 66%, specificity of 70%, positive predictive value of 34% and negative predictive value of 90%. Conclusions: Influenza A (H1N1) and human rhinovirus were the major pathogens responsible for respiratory disease. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic in Amsterdam followed a mild course. Test characteristics of 4 different clinical case definitions seemed comparable but rather useless.",

Furthermore, we aim to provide an overview of the distribution and possible mutual interferences of different viral agents causing respiratory infections in our outpatient population. Another secondary objective is to evaluate the practical usefulness of several existing clinical case definitions attempting to predict influenza virus infection by comparing their predictive values.",

In patients with RT-PCR confirmed human rhinovirus infection, less statistically significant differences, when compared again with patients in whom we did not detect any pathogen, were seen. When comparing influenza A (H1N1) cases with human rhinovirus cases, a history of fever !38.5 C was reported more frequently by H1N1-positive cases (65% versus 34%; p < 0.001) and those patients suffered more cough, less rhinorrea, more myalgia and more subjective chills than those infected with rhinovirus.

For all criteria sets sensitivity was significantly higher for GP referrals than self-referrals (80% versus 51% in Fig. 2) .

The incidence of confirmed H1N1-positive cases over the course of time, however, does correspond fairly well with numbers reported during the past 2009 H1N1 pandemic by sentinel stations for influenza surveillance in the Netherlands and Europe. 21, 22 During the course of the pandemic, different pathogens were dominating the etiologic picture of upper airway infection at different periods. In August and September, human rhinovirus infection peaked among symptomatic patients, with a corresponding 20% of throat swab samples having tested positive in those months. Novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus infection encountered its highest peak prevalence of 30% in the month October. RSV, a less frequently seen viral cause of airway disease in adults, did reach a 7% prevalence rate in December. The consecutive outbreaks of human rhinovirus, influenza A (H1N1) and RSV followed its usual pattern. Unlike postulations from French investigators, the interaction between the pandemic flu and rhinoviruses, did not cause a delay in the circulation of respiratory syncytial viruses in our population. 15 Clinical features of the 157 cases of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) were different from cases that had not been diagnosed with any respiratory viral infection. A history of fever was reported twice as much by the H1N1-positive cases. Most flu-signs and -symptoms were reported significantly more often and vital parameters were slightly, but significantly worse than in the cases in which no respiratory virus could be demonstrated. When comparing the H1N1-positive cases with patients with human rhinovirus infection, less statistically significant differences were seen, but on average the 'flu' patient could be regarded as being sicker than the 'common cold' patient. Our study is the first to compare clinical features of patients in an outpatient setting in relation to different pathogens that have been detected during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. A Chinese observational study described clinical features of 426 persons infected with the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus, using thermal scanners installed at airports and ports of entry to China to include travelers and subsequently their close contacts. 6 Furthermore, a report from the United States summarized clinical findings from hospitalized patients only with 2009 H1N1 influenza infection. 23 In the Netherlands, with a population size of approximately 16.5 million people, the pandemic followed a relatively mild course. Until the end of December 2009, a total of 2156 hospitalizations of cases with laboratory confirmed influenza A (H1N1) were reported of which 10% required intensive care, and in total 53 patients had died. In our population, the low number of H1N1-related hospitalizations, and the fact that only two adults had to be admitted to the ICU because of respiratory insufficiency, all confirmed the mild course of the pandemic. An important finding from our study is that treatment with oseltamivir could be discontinued in 38 of 61 patients after the test results had become available and turned negative for influenza virus. These adults, had they not been tested by a throat swab and RT-PCR, would have been treated for an unnecessarily long time with the antiviral drug and, although clinically probably not very serious, subjected to an unnecessary risk of adverse effects. 24 Four different case definitions for influenza-like illness were evaluated. The corresponding criteria sets were derived from the World Health Organization (WHO), the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United Kingdom Health Protecting Agency (HPA), and the Dutch organization of Medical Assistance for Accidents and Disasters (GHOR). Overall, performance characteristics were rather poor and similar for the different criteria sets. Positive predictive value increased and negative predictive value decreased when comparing the lower-prevalence period AugusteSeptember with the higher-prevalence period OctobereNovember. This finding is not surprising since the predictive value is determined by the prevalence of disease in the population being tested. 25 Further statistically significant differences were seen within criteria sets when comparing patients that had been referred by their GP with patients that visited the outpatient clinic without having been referred. For all criteria sets, sensitivity was significantly higher for GP referrals than self-referrals, and specificity was significantly lower. This could be explained by some kind of selection bias, i.e. general practitioners referring those patients who were more ill and therefore might meet case definition criteria more easily.",

Even though a maximum positive predictive value of 53%, which was seen in October and November at the peak of the epidemic, is still rather useless when wishing to confirm the diagnosis being sought, a maximum negative predictive value of 90% (among patients that had been referred by their GP) might be of quite some value to our practicing clinicians, who also want to be confident that a negative case definition rules out infection with influenza virus.
