Studies have shown that M pro s of difference coronaviruses are highly conserved in terms of both sequences and 3D structures (Xue et al., 2008) .

The protein sequences of SARS-CoV M pro and 2019-nCoV M pro are 96% identical(Figure 1a), and the spatial structure of the previously reported lopinavir/ritonavir bind pocket is also conserved between SARS-CoV M pro and 2019-nCoV M pro(Figure 1b). The conserved amino acids Thr24-Asn28 and Asn119(numbered according to positions in SARS-CoV M pro as the present sequence of 2019-nCoV M pro in GenBank is in polypeptide form) formed the binding pockets for lopinavir/ritonavir in the spatial structure of both SARS-CoV M pro and 2019-nCoV M pro ,",
