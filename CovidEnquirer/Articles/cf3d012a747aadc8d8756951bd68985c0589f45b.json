            "text": "Background: Pneumonia, a leading cause of childhood mortality, is associated with household air pollution (HAP) exposure. Mechanisms between HAP and pneumonia are poorly understood, but studies suggest that HAP may increase the likelihood of bacterial, instead of viral, pneumonia. We assessed the relationship between HAP and infant microbial nasal carriage among 260 infants participating in the Ghana Randomized Air Pollution and Health Study (GRAPHS). Methods: Data are from GRAPHS, a cluster-randomized controlled trial of cookstove interventions (improved biomass or LPG) versus the 3-stone (baseline) cookstove. Infants were surveyed for pneumonia during the first year of life and had routine personal exposure assessments. Nasopharyngeal swabs collected from pneumonia cases (n = 130) and healthy controls (n = 130) were analyzed for presence of 22 common respiratory microbes by MassTag polymerase chain reaction. Data analyses included intention-to-treat (ITT) comparisons of microbial species presence by study arm, and exposure-response relationships. Results: In ITT analyses, 3-stone arm participants had a higher mean number of microbial species than the LPG (LPG: 2.71, 3-stone: 3.34, p < 0.0001, n = 260). This difference was driven by increased bacterial (p < 0.0001) rather than viral species presence (non-significant). Results were pronounced in pneumonia cases and attenuated in healthy controls. Higher prevalence bacterial species were Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Exposure-response relationships did not yield significant associations between measured CO and nasal microbial carriage. Conclusions: Our intention-to-treat findings are consistent with a link between HAP and bacterial nasal carriage. No relationships were found for viral carriage. Given the null results in exposure-response analysis, it is likely that a pollutant besides CO is driving these differences.",

The combustion of these fuels produces a complex mixture of air pollutants collectively termed household air pollution (HAP). These air pollutants contributed to 59 million disability-adjusted life years and 1.6 million premature deaths worldwide in 2017 (IMHE, 2017) . Of the diseases HAP contributes to, pneumonia has the largest impact on children (Gordon et al., 2014; Smith et al., 2014) . Pneumonia is the second leading cause of mortality worldwide for children under five years of age (Stanaway et al., 2018) , and almost half of that mortality is in Sub-Saharan Africa (Troeger et al., 2017) . In Ghana, where our study is based, pneumonia is the second leading cause of death for children under five, and caused over 6000 childhood deaths in 2016 (Troeger et al., 2017; UNICEF, 2018) .",

A number of HAP-specific studies have found such an association (Dherani et al., 2008; Smith, 2000) . However, evidence from randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) has been inconsistent with observational studies (Mortimer et al., 2017) . Intention-to-treat results for RESPIRE in Guatemala yielded inconclusive results for pneumonia, but severe pneumonia showed significant results. Exposure-response analyses in RE-SPIRE, however, did find a significant relationship with pneumonia (Smith et al., 2011) . A small subset of air pollution studies has specifically investigated the etiology of HAP-associated pneumonia. The RESPIRE study, for example, found a decrease in severe respiratory syncytial virus negative (RSV-) pneumonia with lower levels of HAP exposure, but no impact on severe RSV+ infections. Other studies suggest that air pollution exposure may increase susceptibility to bacterial pneumonias, but not viral pneumonias (Rylance et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2011; Zhou and Kobzik, 2007) .",

Fieldworkers referred suspected cases to a study clinic for clinician diagnosis and treatment. Nasopharyngeal swabs were taken for all clinician-diagnosed cases. Fieldworkers then identified healthy infant controls, who were also sent for nasopharyngeal swabs. The fieldworkers chose healthy controls that were the same sex and close to the same age as the case, prioritizing those living in the same (or a neighboring) community. A total of 669 unique samples were catalogued and stored for future analysis. Samples were stored in a \u2212 80\u00b0C freezer until microbial profiling, except for transport to the Unites States when on dry ice. With resources to analyze 290 samples, a computer-generated random selection of swabs selected 145 pneumonia cases, and their matched controls, for PCR analysis (Fig. 1 ). Swabs were only selected from the LPG and 3-stone arms of the study to maximize the exposure contrast among samples. We determined that fieldworker selection of controls did not achieve sufficient balance on matching variables, so a \"nearest neighbor\" algorithm was used to perform a 1:1 match of each pneumonia case with its nearest control. The nearest neighbor algorithm finds the closest possible match between participants in the dataset based on chosen covariates, in our case, minimizing the difference between age and sex. We then removed all repeat pneumonia cases (swabs from reoccurring pneumonias), with their associated healthy controls, to preserve independence and given prior literature on altered microbiomal development with prior infection (Bosch et al., 2017) . Our final sample consisted of 130 pneumonia cases and 130 healthy controls for our intention-to-treat analysis. ",

The monitor measured CO every 10 s in parts per million. It was attached to the participants' clothing, close to the breathing zone, except during sleep or bathing, when participants were asked to keep the monitor off the ground and nearby. Fieldworkers visited daily to ensure wearing compliance and proper device functioning. Devices were checked against certified span gas every six weeks, and a data validation system addressed low-quality deployments. Final session values were based on a 48-h measurement period. See Quinn et al. (2016) for additional information. Two separate exposure variables were used to assess effects based on timing of exposure. First, a prenatal maternal exposure average was calculated using the data from the four prenatal sessions, herein referred to as the Mean Prenatal CO. Second, for the postnatal session, children's exposures were linearly interpolated between time points to provide regular estimates over time. The interpolation estimates the most recent CO value at the time of the nasopharyngeal swab, herein referred to as Recent Postnatal CO. We report R 2 and intraclass correlation coefficients for CO measurements, for the entire GRAPHS cohort, by arm of the study and by individual repeated measures (Supplementary Table 2 ). These are provided to aid in the interpretation of results based on the exposure variables.

The Asset Index was constructed using a principal components analysis of variables including: type of housing materials, type of toilet facility, primary water source, type of home ownership, household ownership of livestock animals, and household ownership of consumer durables (Gunnsteinsson et al., 2010) . The population density measure was constructed using mapped census information from the Kintampo Health and Demographic Surveillance System. A 100-meter radial buffer was created around each home to aggregate the number of individuals within 100 m of the reference household using a spatial join. The season of swab was based on the date of an infant's swab, comparing the Harmattan/dry season to the non-Harmattan/wet season. Ultimately, we found that the season of swab was the only potential confounder variable correlated with the exposure and the outcome, identified via univariable regressions with p-values < 0.05. Season of swab was included in the final regression analyses. Age at swab and sex were also included in the analysis given a priori knowledge of relationships with the exposure and outcome.",

In an intention-to-treat analysis, we observed lower bacterial species presence among participants in the LPG study arm compared to the 3-stone fire study arm. This observation persisted among all three of the bacterial species analyzed. The difference was pronounced for pneumonia cases, and attenuated for healthy controls. We did not observe a difference in viral species presence between the LPG and 3-stone study arms. This finding is interesting given that colonization or infection of the upper airways is one of the first steps of pneumonia etiology (Bogaert et al., 2004) . Other studies have shown that HAP is associated with increased bacterial abundance in the lower airways (Rylance et al., 2015) and impaired phagocytic response in the lower airways (Rylance et al., 2015; Zhou and Kobzik, 2007) .

A suggestive D. Carri\u00f3n, et al. Environment International 133 (2019) 105150 observation in our multinomial model indicates that postnatal HAPexposure may increase the likelihood of testing positive for one bacterial species compared to none -either H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, or M. catarrhalis. More research is needed to understand the role of HAP in upper airway microbial carriage. The timing of exposure is also emerging as an important variable in these investigations, as many air pollution studies indicate that risk changes over the life course (Goldizen et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2018) . This can have important ramifications for policy. For example, if the antenatal period comprises a window of susceptibility, then policies that target exposure reductions to pregnant women may be particularly effective. We, however, find no evidence of an effect of prenatal air pollution exposure on nasal carriage. This study has many strengths, including cookstove randomization, robust disease surveillance, and exposure monitoring. Past studies in this field either have lacked microbial specificity or have not employed a prospective study design, thus limiting the ability to account for confounding factors (Smith et al., 2011; Rylance et al., 2016) . Our analysis is nested in a well-characterized longitudinal cohort tracked in the prenatal and postnatal periods.

Our findings support an association with HAP exposure and bacterial nasal carriage, which is on the pathway to pneumonia. This provides additional evidence on the ways in which HAP may be altering pneumonia susceptibility. This is an important area of investigation given the vast burden of disease caused by HAP, specifically on young children. However, given the null results in exposure-response analysis, it is likely that a pollutant besides CO is driving these differences. Identification of the etiologic relationships between HAP and pneumonia may spur advancements in vaccination, infection control, or allow for refined burden of disease estimates, which can support targeted public health initiatives.",
