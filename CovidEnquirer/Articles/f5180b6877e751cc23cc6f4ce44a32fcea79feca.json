Entry of ebolavirus is mediated by the viral glycoprotein, GP; however, the required host factors have not been fully elucidated. A screen utilizing a recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) encoding Zaire ebolavirus GP identified four Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell lines resistant to GP-mediated viral entry. Susceptibility to vectors carrying SARS coronavirus S or VSV-G glycoproteins suggests that endocytic and processing pathways utilized by other viruses are intact in these cells. A cathepsin-activated form of the ebolaviral glycoprotein did not overcome the entry restriction, nor did expression of several host factors previously described as important for ebolavirus entry. Conversely, expression of the recently described ebolavirus host entry factor Niemann-Pick Type C1 (NPC1) restored infection. Resistant cells encode distinct mutations in the NPC1 gene, resulting in loss of protein expression. These studies reinforce the importance of NPC1 for ebolavirus entry.",

            "text": "Ebolavirus is a non-segmented, negative-sense RNA virus of the Filoviridae family that is associated with outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever in humans and non-human primates in sub-Saharan Africa. Ebolavirus infects a wide range of cell types during an infection, including macrophages, dendritic cells, and hepatocytes. Entry into cells is mediated through the viral glycoprotein (GP), but the process is poorly characterized. Recent studies suggest that the virion enters the cell through macropinocytosis (Hunt et al., 2010; Nanbo et al., 2010; Saeed et al., 2010) . Although the trigger for this uptake is not known, several host factors have been identified that could be involved in this step (Hunt et al., 2010; Kondratowicz et al., 2011) . Once in the endosome, the virion encounters the cysteine proteases Cathepsin B (CatB) and Cathepsin L (CatL). These proteases cleave GP within a disordered loop (Chandran et al., 2005; Kaletsky et al., 2007; Schornberg et al., 2006) . Although this cleavage appears to be necessary for entry, it is not sufficient to induce viral fusion with the host membrane. A subsequent step requiring cathepsins is also necessary (Kaletsky et al., 2007; Schornberg et al., 2006) . The substrate of this second cathepsin cleavage has not been defined. Recently, Niemann-Pick Type C1 (NPC1) was identified as a host protein important for entry of Ebola virus (Carette et al., 2011; Cote et al., 2011) . NPC1 is thought to interact with the processed form of GP (Cote et al., 2011) , but a mechanism of action has not been determined.",

The cell lines were analyzed for defects in established host factors involved in ebolavirus entry, and all four were found to have a defect in expression of NPC1. Exogenous expression of NPC1 restored susceptibility to infection in all four clones. Additionally, overexpression of several other purported ebolavirus entry factors did not overcome a defect in NPC1. Although NPC1 is not expressed in any of these clones, the mutations leading to this loss of expression are unique in each clone. The fact that we isolated multiple clones with distinct, natural mutations in the NPC1 gene lends weight to the recent evidence suggesting that NPC1 is a key host factor necessary for entry of ebolavirus.",

Infection of unmutagenized CHO cells with VSV EboGP mCherry at an MOI of 8 produced numerous colonies. In contrast, infection with VSV-GFP, a VSV vector expressing its own glycoprotein and a GFP marker, did not produce any viable colonies. This observation suggests that there is a high level of natural resistance to ebolaviral entry in CHO cells. After expansion, colonies were pooled and cloned by limiting dilution. Clonal cell lines were tested for susceptibility to VSV EboGP mCherry and VSV GFP. Four clonal cell lines (R1, R2, R4, and L2) that displayed complete resistance to VSV EboGP mCherry, while maintaining susceptibility to VSV GFP, were chosen for further characterization. These four cell lines were derived from resistant colonies isolated from separate plates challenged with VSV EboGP mCherry. The R2 and L2 cell lines display a similar morphology to wildtype (WT) CHO-K1 cells while R1 cells are much larger than WT cells with a more fibroblast-like appearance, and the R4 cells are larger and rounder than the CHO-K1 parent.",

A more quantitative analysis using flow cytometry demonstrates that all four cell lines are effectively infected with VSV GFP (Fig. 1b) .

Cells were fixed 48 h PI and analyzed by flow cytometry for GFP expression. All four resistant clones had similar levels of transduction with HIV/VSV G as WT CHO-K1 cells, as determined by the percent of cells expressing GFP (Fig. 2a) . In contrast, while on average approximately 26% of WT CHO-K1 cells expressed GFP following transduction with HIV/ZEBOV GP, less than 2% of the resistant cells were transduced. This represents less than ten percent of the level of transduction of WT CHO-K1 cells (Fig. 2a) . A similar result was seen when the resistant cells were challenged with HIV pseudotypes bearing Sudan ebolavirus (SEBOV) GP, Cote d'Ivoire ebolavirus (CIEBOV) GP, or Reston ebolavirus (REBOV) GP (Fig. 2b) . There was no statistically significant difference in the level of infection for each cell line when comparing across filoviral glycoproteins.

To test whether the resistance to infection in the isolated CHO cell lines was due to a defect upstream of the ebolavirus GP proteolysis step, we challenged the resistant cells with an HIV pseudotype bearing a mutant form of GP that mimics processed GP (GP 0 , Fig. 2a ). This mutant form, GP 0 , contains a furin recognition sequence, RRKR, at amino acids 203-206 (Fig. S1a ). In the presence of furin, GP 0 is cleaved at amino acid 207, producing a GP1 fragment that is six amino acids longer than the CatL processed species (Hood et al., 2010) . Cells were transduced with HIV/ZEBOV GP 0 pseudotypes encoding GFP and analyzed by flow cytometry. Although GP 0 incorporates into HIV virions at a ratio of approximately 0.5:1 compared to WT GP, pseudotypes bearing GP 0 are more infectious (see Fig. 2a , WT cells). The increased susceptibility of WT CHO-K1 cells to HIV/ZEBOV GP 0 (average of 45% of cells infected compared to 26% with WT GP) was not seen in the resistant cell lines. The lack of an increase in susceptibility for the resistant cell lines indicates that the resistance to infection seen in these cell lines could not be overcome by prior cleavage of ebolavirus GP (Fig. 2a) .",

However, the percent of cells expressing mCherry was still less than 1%, suggesting that this minor increase is likely not biologically relevant. The lack of infection of R1, R2, R4, and L2 cells in the presence of overexpression of CatB or CatL indicated that a loss of expression of CatB or CatL is not the cause for the resistance to GP-mediated infection.

Chinese hamster cells lack functional surface receptors for SARS-CoV. Accordingly, the ebolavirus-resistant cell lines were transiently transfected with an expression plasmid for human ACE2, the receptor for SARS-CoV, 48 h prior to transduction with VSV/SARS S or VSV/ZEBOV GP. Untransfected cells were also challenged with VSV/SARS S as a negative control. R1, R2, R4, and L2 cells expressing ACE2 displayed high levels of luciferase activity following challenge with VSV/SARS S (Fig. 4d) . Conversely, as before, these cell lines were refractory to transduction mediated by ebolavirus GP, with only background levels of luciferase activity seen following challenge with VSV/ZEBOV GP. These background luciferase values for the mutant cells lines were not statistically different compared to those seen with VSV/SARS S transduction in the absence of human ACE2. The high level of transduction of all four clones with VSV/SARS S indicates that the endosomal uptake and CatL pathways are intact and do not appear to be the mechanism for resistance of these cell lines.",

            "text": "Recently the endosomal-resident protein NPC1 was shown to be important for Ebola infection (Carette et al., 2011; Cote et al., 2011) . Therefore, we analyzed the resistant CHO-K1 cell lines for defects in NPC1 expression. Expression of full-length NPC1 is readily evident by Western blot analysis of WT CHO-K1 cells (Fig. 6b) whereas no expression is seen in the four ebolavirusresistant cell lines. To determine the basis for the loss of expression of NPC1 in the resistant cells we performed RT-PCR on total cellular RNA. Sequence analysis of the cDNA for three of the clones, R1, R2, and L2, reveals that they contain unique frameshift mutations in the NPC1 gene. The R1 cell line encodes an 8-nucleotide (nt) duplication in exon 12, starting at nt 1832 and resulting in a truncated protein predicted to be 624 amino acids long. The R2 cell line contains an 874-nt insertion in exon 8 flanked by a 3-nt repeat (see Fig. 6a ). This insert results in a predicted 466 aa product. L2 contains a substitution (P98S) in exon 4 and a 20-nt deletion in exon 6. The deletion results in a truncation of the protein after NPC1 residue number 225. RT-PCR analysis using several sets of primers failed to detect an intact transcript encoding NPC1 in the R4 cell line, suggesting there is a large deletion or major rearrangement of the locus in these cells. To establish whether the loss of expression of NPC1 in the R1, R2, R4, and L2 cell lines is the cause for their ebolavirus-resistant phenotype, we generated cells that stably express human NPC1. A lentiviral vector encoding the Hygromycin B resistance gene and NPC1 or GFP was used to transduce parental WT CHO-K1 and the four resistant cell lines. Hygromycin B selected cells were used for protein analysis by Western blot or challenged with VSV EboGP mCherry and analyzed by flow cytometry. Varying, but readily detectable, levels of NPC1 were seen in all of the Hygromycin selected cell lines (Fig. 6b) . In all cases, stable expression of NPC1 was able to at least partially restore susceptibility to ebolavirus GP-mediated infection (Fig. 6c) . The transduced R1, R2, and L2 cell lines were infected by VSV EboGP mCherry at roughly 49-60% that of WT cells (Fig. 6c) . While the restoration of susceptibility was less efficient in the R4 line, with an average infection level of about 19% of WT, this level was still approximately100-fold above that seen without NPC1 expression. A similar trend with the R4 clone showing the lowest degree of restoration was seen when the cells transiently expressed NPC1 (data not shown). By comparison, stable expression of NPC1 in M12 cells, a CHO cell line carrying a deletion of the NPC1 locus (Millard et al., 2000) , resulted in $40% level of infection in WT cells. While the basis for the varying degrees of susceptibility in the transduced cells is unclear, these results demonstrate that restoration of NPC1 expression in these cell lines confers susceptibility to ebolavirus infection.",

Because CHO-K1 cells are functionally haploid at most alleles, a mutation in a single allele of a gene is likely to result in a phenotypic effect on the affected protein. By not mutagenizing the cells prior to selection, we limited our screen to naturally occurring mutations that disrupted a function vital for viral entry. In doing so, we also increased the likelihood of selecting for genetic variants with mutations in a single gene. Four independent cell lines that demonstrated complete resistance to infection with VSV EboGP mCherry were identified and selected for further characterization.",

This resistance was attributed to a defect in processing of CatB and CatL caused by a lack of expression of a5b1 integrin on the cell surface. Unlike CHO B2 cells, our cell lines express the active, DC form of CatB and CatL. Furthermore, the R1, R2, R4, and L2 cell lines are susceptible to infection by pseudotypes bearing the SARS CoV spike protein, confirming that both endosomal internalization and CatL are functional in these cells. Although there was a slight, albeit statistically significant, increase in susceptibility of the R4 cell line to VSV EboGP mCherry when human CatL was overexpressed, the level of infection was still less than one percent, suggesting that the increase is not biologically relevant.",

Overexpression of these proteins in our resistant cell lines did not restore susceptibility, suggesting that the R1, R2, R4, and L2 cells do not have a defect in either of these genes.

Axl can also provide an alternative entry pathway for Lassa virus in cells deficient for the primary receptor adystroglycan by a process that does not require Gas6 (Shimojima et al., 2012) .

            "text": "During entry into target cells, ebolavirus likely uses multiple host factors to accomplish the steps of attachment, uptake, trafficking, and fusion. Defects in host proteins involved in any of these steps could potentially confer cellular resistance to infection. Consequently, the relatively unbiased selection method employed here could result in isolation of mutants with defects in several different genes, as was seen with a similar screen looking at diphtheria toxin resistance (Moehring and Moehring, 1977) . However, all four of the independently isolated ebolavirus GPresistant CHO cell lines contained mutations in the same gene, NPC1. Although all of the resistant cell lines characterized had mutations in NPC1, the mutations were all unique, indicating that they arose from discrete events. Furthermore, exogenous expression of NPC1 restored susceptibility of the resistant cells, indicating that the loss of expression of NPC1 was sufficient to render these cells resistant. It is possible that these resistant cell lines could have an additional defect in another gene. However, given the high level of restoration seen with exogenous expression of NPC1, any such mutation is likely to only play a minor role, if any, in susceptibility to entry. Recently, two groups independently identified NPC1 as a key component in ebolavirus GP-mediated infection (Carette et al., 2011; Cote et al., 2011) . Carette et al. used an insertional mutagenesis approach to identify cells resistant to infection by ebolavirus GP. Although they utilized a recombinant VSV-EboGP vector similar to the one employed here, the insertional mutagenesis strategy employed could have biased the results toward NPC1 because of the large target size ( 455 kilobases) of the NPC1 gene. Similarly, the studies by Cote and colleagues used a compound library screen to identify NPC1, and thus were biased toward ''druggable'' targets. Our findings, using a selection strategy with a bias for naturally occurring mutations, also identified NPC1 in multiple ebolavirus-resistant cell lines. Despite performing a selection screen with VSV-EboGP using four independent pools of CHO-K1 cells, and in contrast to the selection screen of Carette et al. (2011) , the current studies did not identify any other targets of ebolavirus entry aside from NPC1. The fact that our screen did not identify the HOPS (hemolytic fusion and protein sorting) endosomal sorting complex proteins found by Carette et al. (2011) may suggest that CHO cells with defects in these genes are rare or that the screen was not saturating. Taken as a whole, three strategies, each with a different selection bias, identified the same host factor, confirming the critical role of NPC1 in Ebola entry. NPC1, an important player in cholesterol homeostasis, is a 1278-amino acid protein that has 13 predicted membrane-spanning domains and is normally localized within late endosomes. Mutational analysis of NPC1 in human patients has revealed over 100 different alterations, widely distributed throughout the gene, which affect cholesterol regulatory function (Carstea et al., 1997; Garver and Heidenreich, 2002) . The majority are missense mutations, several of which result in essentially normal amounts of NPC1 protein but impair cholesterol control Ribeiro et al., 2001) . Missense and deletion mutations that affect NPC1 localization to the late endosome have also been identified (Blom et al., 2003) . However, in our studies all of the CHO mutants selected for resistance to ebolavirus GP abrogated NPC1 protein expression. This suggests that simple mutations that impair the cholesterol regulatory function of NPC1 do not cripple the protein's role in ebolaviral entry.",

For HIV/ZEBOV GPrrkr, 8 mg of pSPAX, 8 mg of pLenti CMV GFP Hygro, 20 mg of pCAGGS-Ebola GPrrkr-V5, and 4 mg of pcDNA3.1 furin were used. Viral supernatants were collected 48 h post-transfection and concentrated through a 20% sucrose cushion by ultracentrifugation at 28,000 rpm in an SW28 rotor for 2 h at 4 1C. Pellets were resuspended in HBS at 4 1C overnight. Incorporation of ebolavirus glycoproteins was determined by quantitative western blotting with either a polyclonal anti-V5 rabbit antibody (Bethyl) or a polyclonal anti-GP1 rabbit antiserum. VSV pseudotypes were made by Graham Simmons as previously described (Ray et al., 2010) . Briefly, 293T cells were transfected with pCAGGS SARS S or pCB6-EboZ GP 30 h prior to infection with VSVDG virions derived from VSV-XN2 rLuc. Supernatant was harvested 48 h post-infection, filtered through a 0.45 mm filter, and stored at \u00c0 80 1C.",
