            "text": "To establish an experimental model of early stage avascular necrosis of the femoral head (ANFH) caused by corticosteroid in adult rabbits and to observe the pathological changes with various imaging techniques. Methods ANFH was induced by a combination of hypersensitivity vasculitis caused by injection of horse serum and subsequent administration of a high dose of corticosteroid. The pathological changes were detected with digital radiography (DR), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ink artery infusion angiography, hematoxylin-eosin staining, and immunohistochemistry. Results The imageological and pathological changes corresponded to the clinical characteristics of early stage ANFH. DR showed bilaterally increased bone density, an unclear epiphyseal line, and blurred texture of cancellous bone. CT showed spot-like low-density imaging of cancellous bone, thinner cortical bone, osteoporosis, and an unclear epiphyseal line. MRI showed bone marrow edema and spot-like high signals in T2-weighted imaging in cancellous bone. Ink artery infusion angiography showed fewer obstructed blood vessels in the femoral head. HE staining of pathological sections showed fewer trabeculae and thin bone, an increased proportion of empty osteocyte lacunae, decreased hematopoiesis, thrombosis, and fat cell hypertrophy. Immunohistochemistry showed attenuated expression of vascular endothelial growth factor in osteoblasts and chondrocytes, and on the inner membrane of blood vessels. Conclusion Experimental rabbit model of early stage ANFH caused by corticosteroid can be successfully established and provide the foundation for developing effective methods to treat early stage ANFH.",

In most patients, ANFH involves both femoral heads. Without treatment, femoral heads will deform, even collapse, impairing the hip joint function and causing permanent disability.",

In our study, injection of serum in combination with corticosteroid hormone increased the successful rate for ANFH, showing that our model is consistent with the clinical disease progress of hormone-induced ANFH because a large dose of hormone was used to treat patients with underlying diseases, usually vasculitis. Systemic lupus erythematosus is associated with a high incidence rate of ANFH [4] . Saito et al. [5] showed that hormone treatment and vasculitis are the most likely cause of ANFH. Matsui et al. [6] induced vasculitis in animals by injecting horse serum and then a large amount of hormone, which produced typical osteonecrosis. Small arteries are the target organ of vasculitis, which is caused by the binding of immune complex to the blood vessel wall. Subsequent administration of hormone inhibits the synthesis of collagen and elastic protein [7] , aggravating the contraction of the blood vessels with vasculitis, platelet aggregation, and necrosis of endothelial cells, and causing breakdown and obstruction of small arteries. The processes led eventually to avascular necrosis in the bone. While developing this model, we regulated the dose and injection time of horse serum and hormone. To avoid killing the animals with an excessive immune response caused by the two injections of a large dose (10 mL/kg) of horse serum, we halved the second dose of horse serum and injected it once a day for 2 days. To improve the success rate, we injected prednisolone acetate (7.5 mg/kg) four times instead of three times.",

The sensitivity of MRI in diagnosing ANFH is 88.8 -100 , and the specificity is 98 -100 [8] [9] [10] . However, CT is better than MRI for detecting a bone fracture under the joint cartilage [11] . In the present study, DR showed increased density of femoral heads, unclear epiphyseal line, and blurred texture of the cancellous bone. CT demonstrated spot-like low-density images of the cancellous bone, thinner bone cortex, unclear epiphyseal line, and osteoporosis. MRI revealed an edema and a spot-like high level T2WI signal in cancellous bone. These results are consistent with the image characteristics of early ANFH, which could be classified as I-II stage according to the clinical Ficat stage criteria [12] .",

The earliest and most obvious features are the significant decrease in the medullary hematopoietic organization, few cells and a sparse cell network, and a larger volume of fat cells. These data support that corticosteroid hormone plays a role in causing disorders of lipid metabolism and abnormal hypertrophy of medullary fat cells, which increase the pressure in bone cavity and medullary blood vessels, which in turn induce the pathological process of osteonecrosis [13] . In our model, 23.7 of bone lacunae were empty. Matsui et al. [6] classified the pathological stage of hormone-induced rabbit ANFH model into three grades scored 0-2. In grade 0, the trabeculae are intact and the bone marrow is normal with no necrosis. In grade 1, the bone marrow shows necrosis but dissolved bone cells and hypertrophic fat cells. In grade 2, both the bone marrow and trabeculae have necrosis. Beside the phenomenon in grade 1, there are increasing empty bone lacunae. Our model belongs to the pathological grade of 1-2.",

This is important in regulating blood vessel infiltration during growth in the epiphyseal plate. In the rabbit model of early hormone-induced ANFH, the number of bone cells decreased, bone formation was attenuated, and the cartilage cells were in the resting stage. These changes occur at the same time when the hormone inhibits the cellular expression of VEGF [16] [17] . These events decrease VEGF secretion by cells in the femoral head. During hormone-induced ANFH, the decreased blood flow produces local hypoxia, thus stimulating VEGF expression. The decreased VEGF expression in our model also suggests a poor ability of necrotic tissue to repair itself.",
