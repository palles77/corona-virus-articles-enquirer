Using a data set that matched the details of all nuclear reactors in China with information on land transactions around them before and after the FNA, we find that the accident had dynamic effects on land markets in China. Land prices within 40 km of nuclear power plants dropped by about 18% one month after the nuclear accident. However, the impact of FNA decreased over the longer term, eventually becoming statistically insignificant. Also, the impacts of the disaster varied with plant characteristics such as operating status, construction year, and size.",

            "text": "This paper provides empirical evidence of the effect of the 2011 Fukushima Nuclear Accident (FNA) on Chinese land markets located close to nuclear power plants. The FNA was triggered by an earthquake off the coast of Japan that registered 9.0 on the Moment magnitude scale. The earthquake and the ensuing tsunami resulted in massive economic losses and environmental damage. 1 Over 100,000 residents who lived within 20 km of the nuclear power plant were forced to evacuate one day after the accident. The Japanese Science Ministry reported that long-lived radioactive cesium had Chernobyl accident in Ukraine, FNA reignited global concern over the safety of nuclear power plants and led to a significant decline in the development of the nuclear energy industry worldwide. 3 Social media played an important role in transmitting information about the direct consequences of the disaster. To provide a flavour of the public's reaction to this large-scale nuclear accident, Fig. 1 presents the frequency of Google searches involving the keywords \"Nuclear Power Plant\" across six countries. 4 In each country, search frequencies soared to their peak levels in the days immediately after the FNA, but then declined sharply over the following one to two months. The trend of Google searches appears very similar across the six countries. Although the search frequency trend suggests intensive but short-lived public interest, the real effects of the FNA on the public acceptance of nuclear power are still unclear. On one hand, if people overreacted only temporarily as predicted by prospect theory, then the FNA will not have a persistent effect on risk perception. On the other hand, it is possible that risk assessment is permanently heightened as a result of the increased awareness of nuclear safety concerns in the post-FNA era.",

            "text": "The property market provides a unique lens to examine public perceptions of environmental hazards. Using data from various sources, a growing body of literature has sought to track the impact of environmental disamenities on property values using revealed preference models. 5 An implicit assumption of early studies is that the risk associated with environmental disamenities is constant over time. However, this assumption is not sensible in our case, because the FNA led to the public updating their assessment of the risks of nuclear energy, which consequently affected their marginal willingness to pay for property located near nuclear plants. China was selected for our study on the price effects of changes in perceptions of nuclear safety-related risk because it has a fast-growing number of nuclear power plants. However, it was not itself directly impacted by the FNA, as it experienced neither earthquake-related destruction, nor radiation contamination. Using a comprehensive micro-level dataset of urban land transactions that took place between July 2010 and December 2011, our empirical results suggest that, first, land prices in a 40 km radius around nuclear plants in China dropped by about 18% one month after FNA, which can be translated into about 2.2 billion RMB (347 million US dollars) loss in land transaction revenue for the local governments. However, we did not find significant negative effects further than that distance. This geographic cutoff is similar to the extended distance of contamination in Japan. Second, the effects are transitory, as the impact of FNA on land prices near nuclear plants decreased in the months following the disaster and became statistically insignificant. Third, the effects are heterogeneous across nearby plants. That is, the estimated short-run effects are stronger for land parcels near operational plants and those under construction. Additionally, older plants and those with a larger capacity impacted nearby land prices more profoundly, demonstrating the rational variance of price with the level of perceived risk.",

Much attention has been paid in the literature to the health and economic consequences of the FNA in Japan. However, the impact of the FNA has been felt worldwide, with ongoing concerns about nuclear safety in countries around the world (Davis, 2012) , making it no less important to estimate the costs of increasing public nuclear risk perception outside of Japan. 6 Our paper is related to two recent works by Bauer et al. (2013) and Boes et al. (2015) , which study the impacts of FNA on Germany's housing markets and Switzerland's rental markets near nuclear power plants. Both studies find that the housing prices near nuclear power plants have decreased after FNA. However, due to the social media censorship in China, the spreading of information, which can consequently influence the updated risk perception, may result in different impacts on real estate markets in China than in other countries. Indeed, we find that compared to the evidence from Switzerland and Germany, the reaction of land markets in China is much stronger in terms of magnitude and affected distance. However, it only lasts for one month, which is substantially shorter than the estimates found in those two countries. We believe that the empirical findings of this paper will highlight important economic implications of the development of the nuclear industry and energy policy in China.",

Many studies in this area tend to look at the value of housing in proximity to hazardous sites over a long term period, assuming that people get complete information. Muller and Mendelsohn (2009) consider the role of regulation policy and calculate the welfare gain of switching pollutant trading program for 3130 electric generating units in the US. While such studies tend to disregard the FNA-like shocks that dramatically influence risk perception, the current paper aims specifically to evaluate the effects of such shocks on public risk assessment and on price. Our study thus adds to the discussion on how an exogenous shock that impacts the perceived risk arising from proximity to hazardous sites influences the marginal value of property in the area. Since the FNA did not have a direct impact on China's environment, we believe that the findings we present represents the pure price effect of the updated perceived risk associated with hazard facilities.",

As outlined previously, as well as having direct economic consequences (Barone and Mocetti, 2014) , natural disasters also influence people's risk perception. Theories of experimental psychology predict that people and markets will overrespond to unpredictable events by giving more recent information more weight (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979) . These theories are supported by numerous empirical studies that track stock prices following such unpredicted events (Bondt and Thaler, 1985 , Brooks et al., 2003 , Ederington and Lee, 1993 . Nevertheless, it is worth noting that such an overreaction to changed risk perception is not universal, and that patterns of risk perception make it such that this effect does not hold in all markets (Viscusi, 1990) . In the case of the real estate market, it is still unclear if it can respond as fast as the stock markets. Many recent empirical studies have investigated the reaction of property prices to different unexpected events, and found mixed results. 7 Our paper therefore contributes to the literature by showing how a disaster can change risk perceptions internationally.",

Nuclear energy is a potentially clean and efficient source of energy that does not produce greenhouse gases, and currently provides about 20% of the world's energy. The investment in a nuclear power plant can have significant economic effects on local communities and empirical studies have shown that the establishment of a nuclear energy facility generally stimulates per capita income and employment (Ando, 2015) . However, unlike other large-scale power generation projects, the major issue associated with nuclear power is the unpredictability of the health and environmental risks posed to neighbouring communities. The public concern over nuclear hazards has historically been provoked by a number of significant nuclear plant accidents. Of these, only two have measured up to level 7 (the highest level) on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES). These were the April 1986 Chernobyl accident in Ukraine, and the March 2011 Fukushima accident (FNA) in Japan.",

The first explosion of the No.1 reactor occurred on March 11, 2011 and was followed immediately by the evacuation of people living within a 20 km radius of the power plant. The subsequent explosions on March 15 of the No. 2 and No. 4 reactors raised the overall level of concern and the evacuation zone was extended up to a 30 km radius. The melting of the reactor on the same date raised concerns over the spread of radiation to a wider area through wind and rain. The graphs in Appendix A illustrate the ground level dose rate and the rate of deposit of radioactive substances (mainly cesium-134 and cesium-137) that were being leaked by the reactor one month after the accident. The graphs show that the most affected areas were in the northwest parts of the plant. While the radiation dose for people living within 40 km of Fukushima is greater than 2lSv per hour (equivalent to about 7884 millirems per year), the average exposure to natural radiation among people in non-contaminated zones is only 300 millirems per year (at sea level). Even the US federal limit for occupational radiation exposure for individuals involved in work in nuclear zones (5000 millirems per year) is far surpassed in the area surrounding the plant. What's more, the two main radionuclides, cesium-137 and cesium-134, have 30-year half-life and 2-year 7 Beron et al. (1997) find evidence that real estate markets initially overreacted to the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake in the US. Similarly, Deng et al.'s (2015) assessment of the housing price impacts of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in Sichuan, China, shows disparities between changes in the housing prices of lower and higher floors. Studies have found that other extreme events, such as Hurricane Floyd (Bin and Polasky, 2004) and 9/11 attack (Abadie and Dermisi, 2008) , have significantly affected house prices. However, Wong (2008) found no evidence of excessive price reactions to the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Hong Kong.",

While the first commercial nuclear plant began operation at Daya Bay only in February 1994, the nuclear industry subsequently moved into a rapid phase of development. Soaring demands for energy coupled with serious concerns over pollution led to the establishment of huge incentives to build new nuclear power plants. This policy, together with the substantially lower costs of constructing a nuclear power plant in China relative to other countries, means that China's nuclear generating capacity is the fastest growing in the world (Davis, 2012) . The construction of eight additional nuclear power plants was announced in the Tenth Economic Five-Year Plan (2001 -2005 , and the numbers have risen consistently in the years since. Prior to the FNA, the government aimed to increase China's nuclear power generation capacity to 70-80 GWe by 2020, 200 GWe by 2030, and 400-500 GWe by 2050.",

            "text": "During the phase of rapid development of the nuclear industry between 1970 and 2005, China mainly adopted the nuclear technology from France, Canada and Russia (Zhou, 2011) , with particular focus on using the French element in the local development. However, in 2004, the central government decided to use the Westinghouse AP1000, a Generation-III technology, rather than the indigenous technology pushed by the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), to be the main nuclear reactor technology in the near future. The latest technology acquisition is therefore mainly from the US via Westinghouse (owned by Toshiba) and French. The safety level of a nuclear power plant is associated with many aspects including the generation of the reactor technology, training of nuclear power workforce, and the safety culture at the operation level. It is expected that along with the newly planned AP1000 reactor and the investment in nuclear power workforce training, the risk of nuclear accident will be substantially reduced in the future. In fact, as China has endeavoured to achieve world's best standards in nuclear safety, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) concludes high confidence on China's nuclear safety regulation system (World Nuclear Association, 2014). 8 The FNA received immediate and extensive coverage in Chinese media such as newspapers, television, internet and state radio (He et al., 2014 , Thomson, 2011 , Wang et al., 2014 . The Chinese public became more aware of the advantages and limitations of nuclear power plants. They also pressed the authorities to release more information about the operation, construction and future development of China's nuclear power (Thomson, 2011) . In response to the FNA and the subsequent rising concern of the general public over the safety of nuclear power, the State Council announced its decision to temporarily suspend the approval of new nuclear power plants. The authorities also decided to conduct a comprehensive safety check of all nuclear power plants, which were all found to be safe after the inspection (He et al., 2014 , Wang et al., 2014 . The national policy toward nuclear energy changed from \"positive development\" in 2004 to \"steady development with safety\" between 2011 and 2012. Nevertheless, the suspension of the approval of new nuclear power plants was short-lived and new construction projects received official approval from October 2012.",

            "text": "The 1982 Constitution of China delineates that land is publicly owned and private ownership is legitimately prohibited in China. Initially, administrative orders were mainly used for urban land redistribution. However, the 1988 Amendments of the Constitution and the Amendments of the Land Administration Law (LAL) separated land use rights from ownership and allowed it to be transferred through fixed-term leasehold. In particular, the city governments are the only legitimate sellers in the primary urban land markets. After some reforms in the early 2000s, the procedure of urban land market transactions has been standardized. At the beginning of each year, a local land planning committee decides on leasehold details, including the total amount of leaseholds, land use regulations, the sequences of sales, and reserve price of each individual parcel. Subsequently, the land parcels are sold by the land bureau via a selected transaction method, such as negotiated sales, English auctions, two-stage auctions, and sealed bids (Cai et al., 2013 , Qin et al., 2016 . 9 Among these transaction methods, negotiated sales differ from the others in terms of transaction transparency: transaction prices are negotiated between potential buyers and local land bureau. Negotiated sales were widely used in the 1990s and the early 2000s. However, since the reform in 2002 officially banned the negotiated sales of for-profit use land after 2004, the proportion of negotiated sales has decreased substantially over time (Qin et al., 2016) . The English auction, two-stage auction, and sealed bid can be labelled as different land auction forms. In practice, auctions with detailed land characteristics are announced about 20 days in advance, a cash deposit is required to be made for each auction participant. It is noteworthy that different from the conventional English auction where potential bidders enter simultaneously, the two-stage auction has a first stage of approximately 10 days during which the auction details are listed, bidders are required to express interest in entering the auction with their minimum prices publicized. If there are at least two bidders willing to offer prices above the reserve price set by the government, then the transaction turns into an English auction in the second stage (Cai et al., 2013) .",

Information obtained from the WNA included the name of the various nuclear power plants, their location, capacity, model of the reactors used, the company that controls the project, as well as the construction and operation dates for each plant. As one nuclear power plant usually contains multiple reactors constructed at different times, newer reactors had to be manually matched with their plants by crossreferencing their project names. By referencing the construction dates and the dates of operation, we were able to infer the operating status of each nuclear power reactor. Using the time of the FNA (2011) as our frame of reference, we categorized the plants into three major groups: operational, under construction, and in planning. If a nuclear plant had at least one operating reactor, it was categorized as being operational. Plants were defined as being \"under construction\" if at least one new reactor was being constructed, and no other reactors were operational.",

Additionally, 48 nuclear reactors with a combined capacity of up to 52,502 MWe capacity were being constructed at that time. A further 125 reactors capable of generating at least 164,960 MWe of electricity were in the planning phase of development. After grouping the reactors into different plants by their project names, Fig. 2 presents the location of all 45 nuclear plants, each of which either were already hosting or were going to host one or more reactors. Most of these 45 plants were sited in southern China because of the uneven distribution of the population, the demand for energy and the availability of natural resources. Except for the \"Chinese Experimental Fast Reactor\" which is located close to the capital, Beijing, all other plants were located in coastal regions. Although nuclear power plants are more complex to build inland than on the coast, new inland plants are being planned in increasing numbers and it is estimated that they will soon account for 38% of all Chinese nuclear plants. Fig. 3 shows another significant feature of the new plants, specifically their ever-increasing electricity generating capacity. The first commercial nuclear plant built in China was the Qinshan Phase 1 with one reactor and a capacity of 298 MWe. Subsequent plants far surpassed Qinshan in their generational capabilities. Prior to the FNA, the biggest plant in operation, the Lingao Phase 2, had two M310-CPR-1000 reactors with a combined generating capacity of 2052 MWe. The average capacity of plants currently operating across China is 1507 MWe, with the plants currently being constructed having average capacity of 2047 MWe. The plants in the planning phase have even greater generational power (average 3549 MWe). In addition, the average planned capacity of single inland plant is much larger than the coastal plant, mainly due to the newer and more advanced adopted technology of power generation.",

To verify whether our selected land transactions were affected by nearby earthquakes, we collected information on significant earthquakes in China between July 2010 and December 2012 from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Fig. 4 lists the 11 significant earthquakes that occurred in the period under study. However, all of them took place in the far west of China, outside of the 140-km buffer zones we selected around the nuclear plants. The most significant one among the 11 earthquakes was the Kaishi earthquake in Xinjiang Province on August 11, 2011, which had a magnitude of Mw 5.7 but caused no deaths. Since all domestic earthquakes in that period were far from our research region and were not associated with any nuclear risk, we can assume that land transactions near nuclear power plants were more likely to be affected by FNA rather than domestic earthquakes.",

Since obtaining official data at the community/town level in China is difficult in China, following Henderson et al. (2012) , we use a different measure of economic activity: the level of night light observed from space. We matched the land parcels with the night light images obtained from NOAA in the 2010 and 2011 waves. Each satellite-year data set is a highresolution raster image representing the average amount of light observed from satellites, and every pixel represents approximately 1 km 2 . The pixel values range from 0 to 63, where higher values reflect a higher level of lighting, and hence, more intense economic activity. 12 We calculated the average pixel value (i.e. the average level of lighting) of a 5 km zone around each land parcel to capture the level of economic activity in each neighbourhood during the transaction year. Fig. 5 is an example of the geographic information and light measures used for the land parcels. Table 1 shows the summary statistics of our sample. 13 Overall, 79,688 land transactions occurred between July 2010 and December 2011. The average unit land price was about 11.2 million Yuan per hectare. The relatively large standard deviation in land prices indicates that land values vary significantly in our sample. This may due to disparities in the level of development and urbanization in China. About 43% of observations are newly-developed land parcels transferred from the rural sector, suggesting that almost half of our sample is likely to be located at the urban fringes. This makes sense because, besides geological and seismological issues, another important consideration for selecting nuclear power sites is that the plants should be in low population density zones to avoid any potential adverse impacts on public health.",

The levels of economic activities measured by average light at night are also lower in areas closer to nuclear power plants. The characteristics of land parcels also differ by the operational status of the nearest nuclear power plant.

That is, the public's perception of the risk of nuclear accidents and the expected disutility of disaster exposure decreases with distance from the plants. Therefore, if any, the treatment effects of FNA on land prices are expected to decline with distance. To examine this, we use the regression method to search for effects at different distance bands from the nuclear plants. Specifically, we divide the 100 km buffer zones around the nuclear power plant sites into five rings, and estimate the effects of FNA on land prices using each individual band as a treatment group until the estimated effects of FNA on land prices taper off. Hence the cut-off distance of the significant effects and insignificant effects implies the maximum geographic extension of the impact of FNA.",

Therefore, multiple groups in the same distance buffer exist, depending on how administrative boundaries divide the buffer zones. Finally, the city-distance groups are denoted by the subscript c. In the equation, the dependent variable ln(P ict ) is the log of unit price of land parcel (in 10,000 RMB per hectare) i which locates in the city-distance group c and was transacted at time t. A c and B t are city-distance band and year-months fixed effects, respectively. X ict are individual controls, including land characteristics and other geographic covariates. As discussed in the data section, land characteristic controls include floor area ratio (FAR), land size, length of leasehold, transaction methods, land origins, land classes, land use, and 5 km average level of night light. Geographic covariates include the shortest distance from each land parcel to inland water and coastal line. I post\u2212FNA is a binary variable equal to 1 if land parcel i is sold after FNA, while I treatment is a binary variable equal to 1 if land parcel i is in the treatment group. Therefore, the coefficient of I post\u2212FNA \u00d7 I treatment implies the average treatment effect of FNA on surrounding land prices. The error term of Eq. (1) might be serially and spatially correlated, which may lead to problematic statistical inference of treatment effects. To address this problem, we follow Bertrand et al.

Using proximity to nuclear plant sites as a criteria for defining treatment and control groups fits well into the special context of this paper because the impacts of FNA on risk perception tend to differ spatially. 15 Moreover, the land market policies during the investigation window largely focused at the national level, and are unlikely to be regional-specific or differ with the distance to nearest nuclear plants. One potential concern on the validity of our identification strategy is about the general economic impacts of nuclear plants, which may subsequently affect the land prices. For example, Ando (2015) shows heterogeneous effects of nuclear power plant establishment on the local economic growth. However, we consider that the potential growth effect of nuclear plants will not influence our causal inferences for three reasons: First, in our regressions, we include the 5 km night light around each land parcel and city-distance band fixed effects to partially capture the local economic activity. Second, the economic growth effect of nuclear plants tends to exist in the long run, 16 however, our study only focuses on a much shorter time period (9 months) after FNA. Third, and more importantly, as the key assumption for the DID estimations in this study is that there is no significant difference between the changes of land prices for treatment group and control group before FNA, in Section 5, we will show that this common trend assumption indeed holds by estimating Eq. (3).",

The results show that the coefficient for April 2011 is the same as that in Column 1. Additionally, there is a clearly decreasing trend of magnitudes of short-term, mid-term, and long-term coefficients, implying that the estimated effects tend to decline over time. In contrast, in Column 3, we equally divide the nine postevent months into three groups. Although the magnitudes of the coefficients also decrease over time, the estimated parameter for the short-term (April 2011 to June 2011) is marginally insignificant. Therefore, we prefer categorizing Column 2, which can highlight the short-term impacts of FNA, in the previous manner to further investigate other heterogeneous treatment effects. There are two possible explanations for the short-lived effects of the FNA on land prices. First, people may have shifted their attention from the FNA over time. Fig. 1 in Section 1 displays the frequency of Google searches involving the keywords \"nuclear power plant\". It shows that the search frequency in China soared to their peak levels immediately after the FNA, but then declined to the normal frequency within one to two months. This pattern is similar in 5 other countries including France, Germany, Japan, UK and the US. Second, the Chinese believed that the nuclear power plants are safe in China. Soon after the FNA, the Chinese Government started a comprehensive safety review of all nuclear power plants, which were all announced to be safe after the inspection (He et al., 2014 , Wang et al., 2014 . The study by He et al. (2014) shows that \"Chinese citizens tended to choose the government as the most trustworthy source when it came to information provision on nuclear risks and in cases of nuclear accidents\" and \"in responding to nuclear accidents, Chinese citizens trusted most of all governmental authorities\" (page 448).",

This is because individual risk perceptions about nuclear energy are determined by the weight placed on the prior information available to them, as well as updated risk perceptions. It is possible that neighbourhoods near plants of different operating status will place different weights on updated risks. For example, individuals living near existing plants and those being constructed may put a higher weight on updated risk perceptions because they are more likely to care about the potential exposure risk. In contrast, people living near plants that are still being planned may put less weight on updated risk perceptions as nuclear energy is not seen as being immediately hazardous to them. To test this, we separate the plants' operating status in 2011 into three major groups: operating, under construction, and under planning. Table 6 reports the results of these heterogeneous effects by estimating Eq. (4), where the treatment indicators at different time scales interacted with these three statuses respectively.",

Hypothetically, individual risk perceptions may be influenced by features of nuclear power plants that they learned about from various channels, such as the mass media or social networks. In this section, we examine how the effects of FNA differed across two major pieces of information about nuclear power plants that people can easily obtain: the construction year and capacity of the plants. Plants constructed in earlier years tend to use older production techniques, making maintenance more difficult and increasing the chances of leaks. For the public, the construction year of a plant is more straightforward than the other reactor details as a signal of the technology and safety level. Therefore, individual risk perceptions may decrease with construction year. Moreover, electricity-generating capacity can also affect individual risk perceptions, as it is sensible to assume that larger plants may cause more damage in case of a nuclear accident. The regressions in Table 7 use land transactions associated with nuclear power plants with specific information on construction year and generating capacity.",

In Column 2, the post-treatment period is divided into three parts: April 2011, May to August 2011 and September to December 2011.

These regressions use land parcels in 0-40 km to the nearest nuclear power plant as treatment group and land parcels in the 100-140 km distance band as control group. The core variables are products of a time dummy It and a treatment indicator Itreatment, the coefficients of them represent the treatment effect estimates of different periods. Control variables include land characteristics defined in Table 1 , city-distance band fixed effects, and year-months fixed effects.

As the land transactions we used in the regressions are limited to the primary land market, where the local governments are the sellers and they have market power in their own land markets. Therefore, to ascertain that the short-term negative price effects of FNA on neighbourhood land markets we estimated are driven by the increased risk perception of the buyers, rather than the temporary changes of other factors such as strategic sales of the governments after FNA. We restrict our regression sample to land transactions that are sold via three major auction types in Chinese land market: two-stage auction, English auction and sealed bid, which account for about 56% of our total observations. The advantages of using this sub-sample in our analysis are twofold. First, the land sold via public auctions are typically hot land parcels (Cai et al., 2013) . As we described in the background section, the land development planning and sequence of land sales are determined by a local land planning committee each year, so it is less likely that the local government can change their publicized land selling schedule temporarily. Second, different from the mechanism of negotiated sales, in which the seller (local government) and buyer are negotiating a price, and the land sale can be closed if the negotiated price is higher than the reserve price set by the government. The public auction sales, however, are much more competitive. If the nuclear risk perception of bidders has increased after the FNA, then it should be reflected in the final transaction prices. Table 10 shows the regression results using this sub-sample. The estimated short-term effects are similar to our findings in column 2 of Table 5 in terms of magnitude and significance level. Therefore, we argue that the price effects of FNA are mostly driven by the public's increased risk perception.",

If individuals overreact to the disaster, then the immediate policy response of governments will be driven by these overreactions and may not be efficient in the long run.

Second, we find the impacts are heterogeneous in various aspects. We find that the impacts were mainly concentrated in April 2011, the first month after FNA, which is a clear evidence of overreaction in the market. In addition, the effects of FNA varied significantly by plant running status. In the short run, land prices dropped significantly near operating and constructing plants, while there are still long-lived effects for the plants being constructed.
