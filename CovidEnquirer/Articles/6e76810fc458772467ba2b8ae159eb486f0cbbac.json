A lack of suitable reagents and specific assays for monitoring host responses has limited the use of this animal model to clinical observations, pathology and humoral immune responses. The objective of this study was to establish and validate assays to monitor host immune responses in the hamster including important proinflammatory, anti-inflammatory and innate immune responses, as well as markers of apoptosis, cell proliferation, cell junction integrity and coagulation. Commercially available mouse and rat ELISA and luminex panels were screened for potential cross-reactivity, but were found to be of limited value for studying host responses in hamsters. Subsequently, quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays for the detection of 51 immune-related and four internal reference genes were developed. To validate the immune-related assays, hamsters were infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Indiana species, or treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and host immune responses were monitored in selected organs. Ribosomal protein L18 was identified as the most stable internal reference gene. In conclusion, these new assays will greatly improve the use of the hamster as an important small animal model in infectious disease research.",

In particular, hamsters have been recognized as valuable animal models for studying emerging and high consequence acute human viral diseases caused by bunyaviruses (Niklasson et al., 1984; Hooper et al., 2001; Milazzo et al., 2002; Fisher et al., 2003) arenaviruses (Smee et al., 1993; Sbrana et al., 2006) , henipaviruses (Wong et al., 2003) , flaviviruses Xiao et al., 2001; Siirin et al., 2007) and SARS-coronavirus (Roberts et al., 2005) . For some of these pathogens, such as Andes virus, a New World hantavirus and a causative agent of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, hamsters are the only lethal disease model (Hooper et al., 2001) . However, due to a lack of available reagents and specific assays to monitor host responses in hamsters, including disease-decisive acute and early innate immune responses, investigators are currently limited to studies on disease progression (clinical symptoms), humoral immune responses (antibodies) and pathology. For other disease models using rodents, nonhuman primates and ferrets, expression microarray proteome and luminex technology-based quantification assays have been developed and utilized (Kayo et al., 2001; Datson et al., 2007; Bruder et al., 2010; Ierna et al., 2010) . However, for Syrian (Golden) hamsters similar specific assays are not available due to the lack of a complete genome sequence.",

Due to limited cross-reactivity in ELISA and luminex based assays, the development of qRT-PCR assays seemed the most practical and useful strategy to quantify specific host responses in the hamster model. A few qRT-PCR assays for the quantification of a limited number of immunological responses have been previously reported (Melby et al., 1998; Muller et al., 2001; Vernel-Pauillac and Merien, 2006) . We developed a unique extended panel of TaqMan\u00ae primer/ probe assays for 51 different genes targeting specific markers in the pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory, innate immuni-ty, apoptosis, cell junction and coagulation responses of the hamster. With ribosomal protein L18 we identified a more suitable and stable housekeeping gene. The assays were validated by monitoring host responses to treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and infection with vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus (VSV), both of which are known to strongly activate host responses in the hamster (Fultz et al., 1981b; Muller et al., 2001) . The new assays will allow for a broader monitoring of host responses against infection and an advanced utilization of the hamster model.",

Three of the controls and VSV infected, and six of the LPS treated hamsters were euthanized by exsanguination while under deep anesthesia (inhalational isoflurane) one day post inoculation. The remaining control and VSV inoculated hamsters were euthanized at 3 days post inoculation. Whole blood was collected by cardiac puncture into EDTA vacutainers, after which plasma was separated by centrifugation and frozen at \u221280\u00b0C. Lung, liver and spleen samples were harvested from euthanized hamsters, cut into approximately 50-100 mg pieces and submerged in 1 mL of RNAlater (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) overnight at 4\u00b0C. The following day RNAlater was removed and the tissues were frozen at \u2212 80\u00b0C. Approximately 30 mg of the tissue samples were mechanically homogenized in RLT buffer and the RNA was extracted from the homogenate using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The concentration of the extracted RNA was determined using a NanoDrop 8000 instrument (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and adjusted to a final concentration of 10 ng/\u03bcL. All experiments were conducted under BSL2 conditions, and approval for animal experiments was obtained from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

First, we compared amino acid sequence homologies of representative cytokines and chemokines between hamsters, rats, and mice. We selected target proteins showing N90% homology at the amino acid level (data not shown) and tested crossreactivities of ELISA kits for their detection. In total 63 antibody-based (55 luminex, 8 ELISA) assays were tested for cross-reactivity with hamster proteins and only 14 were determined to display cross-reactivity ( Table 2 ). The mouse and rat ELISA kits tested in this study had limited crossreactivity with hamster proteins. Of the eight ELISA kits tested, only three (mouse IL-1\u03b2, rat IL-10 and rat/mouse/ porcine/canine TGF\u03b21) displayed cross-reactivity against the hamster homologues (Fig. 1A , Table 2 top panel). Additional problems with the ELISA results are the unusually high (roughly 1000-fold higher than to be expected) levels of TGF\u03b21 detected in comparison to mice. Therefore, we concluded that the tested ELISA kits are unreliable and of limited use for monitoring proteins involved in immune responses of hamsters. Similarly, the luminex rat and mouse panel data suggests that of the 55 different proteins tested only mouse IL-13 and MIG, and rat GM-CSF, IL-1\u03b1, Leptin and GRO/KC were detected with confidence in hamster plasma (Fig. 1B, Table 2 bottom panel). In addition, mouse Eotaxin, MIP-1\u03b2 and IL-12 p40 as well as rat RANTES and IL-10 showed weak cross-reactivity for hamster proteins (Fig. 1C) . All other cytokine analyses failed to show values above the limit of detection. These data suggest that, as with the ELISA kits, the tested luminex panels for rat and mouse cytokines/chemokines, with the exception of the six mentioned previously, are unreliable for the detection of immune responses in hamsters.",

Hamsters are outbred animals and therefore variability is inherent between individual animals. This makes selection of an appropriate internal reference critical (Dheda et al., 2004) . \u03b2-actin, \u03b22M, HPRT, and RPL18 were selected as potential housekeeping genes and individually evaluated for their expression levels in lung, liver and spleen tissues of treated/infected and control hamsters (n = 17 per tissue, n = 51 total). Fig. 2 shows the distribution of the fluorescence curves within representative tissues of infected, treated and untreated hamster tissues. \u03b22M and RPL18 vary less than HPRT and \u03b2-actin (\u03b22M standard deviation (SD) \u2264 1 cycle within tissues, 1.29 cycles between all samples; RPL18 SD \u2264 0.5 cycles within tissues, 0.87 cycles between all samples; HPRT SD \u2264 4.6 cycles within tissues, 3.4 cycles between all samples; \u03b2-actin SD \u2264 7.2 cycles within tissues, 7.5 cycles between all samples).

The average r 2 values of the slopes were determined to be 0.9969 (range 0.9911-0.9996) from the DNA template (Fig. 3A) and 0.9616 (range 0.8148-0.9995) (Fig. 3B) from the RNA template. The signal generated per target template between the control and reference primer/probe sets was considered to be comparable as the efficiencies of the primer/probe sets were within 10% of the average (Ling et al., 2008) . The limit of detection for the assayed primer/probe sets was determined to be between 10 \u2212 6 to 10 \u2212 8 ng gene-specific RNA which corresponds to 9-900 copies of the target RNA. The lowest amount of total RNA which could be used in these sets of experiments was determined to be 50 ng/25 \u03bcL reaction. The advantage of the approach is the sheer number of available assays and the diverse aspects of the immune system that can be analyzed, as well as the low amount of RNA necessary to perform each of the assays. Together, this allows for detailed analysis of several important genes even with lower RNA isolation yields.",

Hamsters used in our study developed severe \"sepsis-like\" symptoms (lethargy, ruffled fur, hunched posture and labored breathing) within one day following LPS treatment (50 \u03bcg) and were therefore euthanized and their tissues harvested. Hamster immune modulation was studied in selected tissues on day 1 post treatment (Fig. 4) . The expression of pro-inflammatory genes was upregulated with high transcript levels detected in the spleens and livers of the treated animals. Up-regulation of proinflammatory gene expression was less pronounced in lung tissue. Anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory genes were up-regulated in all three tissues examined with liver being the strongest. The cell regulatory response was enhanced in >50-fold increase 20-to 50-fold increase 10-to 20-fold increase 5-to 10-fold increase 2-to 5-fol dincrease <2-fold increase or decrease 2-to 5-fold decrease 5-to 10-fold decrease 10-to 20-fold decrease 20-to 50-fold decrease >50-fold decrease spleen and liver tissues, but the anti-apoptotic gene expression was unaltered in all three tissues. Cell junction and integrity responses appeared to be minimally altered in the spleen, increased in the lung and nearly unaffected in the liver in response to LPS treatment and the expression level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was strongly decreased in the three tissues examined, suggesting a lack of endothelial cell proliferation (Ferrara and Davis-Smyth, 1997) . A previous study focusing on LPS induced sepsis in the hamster model noted that liver and spleen showed higher levels of gene expression than lung and other tissues (Muller et al., 2001) . In our study here the responses to LPS inoculation were also more pronounced in liver and spleen than in lung tissue, suggesting a much greater impact on these organs.",

            "text": "Hamsters are especially susceptible to VSV infection. Previous studies report that, in hamsters, as few as 10 pfu of VSV inoculated i.p. will result in uniform lethality within 72 h (Fultz et al., 1981a (Fultz et al., , 1981b . Upon infection with VSV (10 6 pfu) pro-inflammatory, innate and anti-inflammatory responses were largely up-regulated in all three organs examined with some being down-regulated (Fig. 5) . Downand up-regulation were especially pronounced in liver and spleen tissue ( Fig. 5A and C) . Pro-apoptotic genes were minimally up-regulated in expression in all tissues, but antiapoptotic gene expression was increased only in the livers of infected animals. Expression of genes encoding for cell junction proteins was generally unaffected by VSV infection in liver, increased in the lungs, and reduced in the spleen of infected hamsters. Expression of fibrinogen was increased initially followed by a substantial decrease in expression in spleen and liver in final stages of the disease. This suggests that after infection with VSV there is a deregulation of cytokine and chemokine expression, which may precede or induce coagulation abnormalities in spleen and liver tissues of hamsters. Interestingly, the opposite was found for lung tissue (Fig. 5B) (Muc1) >50-fold increase 20-to 50-fold increase 10-to 20-fold increase 5-to 10-fold increase 2-to 5-fold increase <2-fold increase or decrease 2-to 5-fold decrease 5-to 10-fold decrease 10-to 20-fold decrease 20-to 50-fold decrease >50-fold decrease tissues monitored during both early and terminal stages of infection. Overall the data imply that hamsters mount more robust immune responses in the liver and spleen than in the lung during VSV infection. Previous work identified the spleen and liver as the organs displaying pathological changes during VSV infection without notable involvement of the lungs, kidney, brain or intestinal tract (Fultz et al., 1981b) . The similarities between our results and previous studies demonstrate the usefulness of our assays for more in depth evaluation of host responses to infection in an important animal model for which tools are largely lacking.",
