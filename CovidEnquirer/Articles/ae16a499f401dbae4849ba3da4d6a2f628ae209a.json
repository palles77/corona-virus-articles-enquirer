            "text": "The papain family of proteases includes a subfamily of eleven human lysosomal cysteine peptidases known as the cathepsins (B, C, F, H, K, L, O, S, V, W and X). 1 Although the first cathepsin was discovered in the 1940s, cathepsin C, these cysteine proteases have only been more thoroughly characterized structurally and biologically in the last 10-15 years. 2 Several of these proteins are responsible for the degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in addition to other physiological processes such as intracellular protein turnover. Recent studies have shown that specific cysteine proteases, such as cathepsins B and L, participate in tumor progression, hyperproliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis and metastasis by malignant cells. 3 Cathepsins L and B have a broad tissue distribution and are overexpressed in several human tumors including breast, prostate, lung, gastrointestinal, and epidermal. 4 Therefore, cysteine proteases are of special interest as targets for the development of novel chemotherapeutic drugs. 5 Cathepsin L is a globular endosomal cysteine protease that plays a vital role in biological and physiological processes such as bone remodeling, cancer metastasis, tumor cell invasion, rheumatoid and osteo-arthritis. 6 Cathepsin L also catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of specific peptide bonds involved in antigen processing, bone resorption, and turnover of proteins. Cathepsin L activity has also been reported to be involved in diseases such as Ebola hemorrhagic fever, 7 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 8 and Leishmania. 9 Inhibitors of cathepsin L-like cysteine proteases also have potential utility in the treatment of protozoan infections such as trypanosomiasis and malaria. 10 Cathepsin B is characterized by a dual function as a lysosomal endopeptidase and as an exopeptidase. 11 In addition to facilitating ECM and basal membrane degradation, cathepsin B also plays an important role in promoting invasion of certain solid tumors. 12 Overexpression of cathepsins L and B contributes to the migration of cancer cells into surrounding tissue resulting in further metastasis. 13 The thiosemicarbazone moiety has been recognized as a functional group that presumably interacts with the cysteine-25 residue in the active site of the cathepsin L-like cysteine protease cruzain from the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. 14 Recent studies by our group and others have demonstrated the effectiveness of the thiosemicarbazone moiety (I & II) for inhibition of cathepsin L ( Fig. 1 ). 14f,15 In addition, a variety of other small molecules including peptidic: thiocarbazate (III), 16 aldehyde (IV), 17 epoxide (V), 18 nitrile (VI), 19 cyanopyrrolidine (VII) 20 and non-peptidic: azepanon (VIII) 21 and cyanamides (IX) 4 have been identified as inhibitors of cathepsin L (Fig. 1) .",

            "text": "In general, cysteine proteases are small monomeric proteins with an average mass of approximately 30 kDa. Structurally, the cathepsins consist of two domains (left and right) with a Vshaped active site cleft located along the domain interface. 22 This site contains two active residues, a Cys-25 located on the left domain and a His-159 located on the right domain which together, form a stable thiolate-imidazolium ion pair required for the enzyme's activity. 4 Molecular modeling of the most active analog 1 with cathepsin L showed that the conformation with the most favorable relative interaction energy places the bromophenyl ring deep in the S2 pocket with the thiosemicarbazone in close proximity to the active site Cys-25 (Fig. 2) . The thiosemicarbazone is oriented at the active site by two hydrogen bonds between the NH and NH 2 groups and the enzyme Asp-162 ( Fig. 2) . Details regarding the molecular modeling studies can be found in the Supplementary data. All 36 thiosemicarbazone analogs were evaluated based on their ability to inhibit both cathepsin L and cathepsin B in separate assays (Tables 1-3) . The most active inhibitors of cathepsin L all contain a 3-bromo functionality in one of the aryl rings (Table 1) . Activity against cathepsin L decreases dramatically when the A-ring bromide is located at the 4-position (Table 2) , as observed in a comparison of analog 1 (IC 50 = 30.5 nM) with 24 (IC 50 = 2220 nM). Within the 3-bromo A-ring series, as the functional group at position 2 in the B-ring is varied (F, Cl, Br, and Me) the activity decreases substantially. A fluorine substituent at positions 2 or 4 in the B-ring leads to compounds that are more active inhibitors of cathepsin L compared to analogs containing a fluorine sub-stituent at the 3-position. Additional fluorine substituents in the Bring tend to provide compounds that are potent inhibitors of cathepsin L (analogs 14, 16 and 22), although certain substituent patterns are less desirable in terms of cathepsin activity (analogs 15 and 21). Analog 23 (nor-3-bromo, 2 0 -fluoro) is an important control compound verifying that the strong inhibitory activity of analog 1 (3-bromo, 2 0 -fluoro) against cathepsin L is due to this compound itself and not the inseparable by-product (H replacing Br).",

Since chronic dosing would likely be required of such an antimetastatic treatment, it is important that such compounds demonstrate low cytotoxicity. Three of the analogs were tested against selected human cancer lines and found to exhibit low cytotoxicity (Table 5) . 23 In summary, a small library of 36 functionalized thiosemicarbazone analogs was prepared by chemical synthesis and each compound was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against cathepsins L and B. The activity of six of these analogs (1, 7, 9, 14, 16, and 22) against cathepsin L is especially noteworthy, and suggests that these analogs are excellent candidates for future in vivo preclinical studies.",
