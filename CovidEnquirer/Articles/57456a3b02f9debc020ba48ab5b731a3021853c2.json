The histopathologic appearance gives clues regarding the duration of the inflammation. Acute hepatitis is characterized by a combination of inflammation, hepatocellular apoptosis, necrosis, and possibly regeneration, but a lack of fibrosis. The relationship between the development of hepatitis and necrosis is complex, and it can be difficult to determine which abnormality was the initial lesion. 1 Chronic hepatitis, on the other hand, is identified by the presence of fibrosis, proliferation of ductular structures, and regenerative nodules in addition to an inflammatory infiltrate, apoptosis, and/or necrosis. 2 The type of inflammatory cellular infiltrate may give the clinician some clues regarding the cause. Occasionally, causative agents are identified within biopsy specimens. However, the cause remains unknown for many cases of hepatitis and cholangiohepatitis in dogs and cats. This chapter discusses the clinical presentation of animals with hepatitis and cholangiohepatitis and outlines the most commonly recognized clinical syndromes with respect to diagnosis and treatment of the specific disease. Effective treatment of patients with hepatitis or cholangiohepatitis includes specific therapy of any identified inciting cause and aggressive symptomatic and supportive therapy. A discussion of symptomatic treatment and supportive therapy for the sequelae of hepatitis and cholangiohepatitis can be found in Chapter 116.",

Mechanisms of hepatocellular injury that are not specific to hepatitis include tissue hypoxia, lipid peroxidation, intracellular cofactor depletion, intracellular toxin production, cholestatic injury, endotoxic insults, and hepatocyte plasma membrane injury. 3 Hepatocytes are especially susceptible to anoxia because the liver receives a mixture of venous and arterial blood. Hypoxic damage quickly leads to plasma membrane and cytosolic organelle injury secondary to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion.

This disease can be seen in acute and chronic stages. In acute neutrophilic cholangitis (ANC), edema and neutrophilic inflammation may extend into the portal areas. In chronic neutrophilic cholangitis (CNC), a mixed inflammatory infiltrate may be noted in portal areas, along with varying degrees of fibrosis and bile duct hyperplasia. 7 This syndrome was referred to previously as acute cholangiohepatitis or suppurative cholangitis-cholangiohepatitis. 8, 9 NC can occur in cats of any age, breed, or sex. Clinical signs are nonspecific and include anorexia, lethargy, vomiting, and weight loss. The duration of these clinical signs ranges from a few days to a few months and may be shorter in cats with ANC than in those with CNC, 8 but this is not a consistent finding. 10, 11 Physical examination findings commonly include dehydration and icterus. Fever is present in 19% to 37.5% of cases. 10, 12 Some reports suggest that fever is associated more commonly with ANC than CNC, 12 whereas others recognize no difference. 10, 11 Hepatomegaly is seen in fewer than half of the cases and abdominal pain is noted occasionally. 8,10,11 Biochemical analysis commonly reveals increased activity of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and \u03b3-glutamyltransferase (GGT) ranging in severity from mild to severe. However, increased liver enzyme activity may be absent in some cases. 13 Cholangitis in cats has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and pancreatitis, 12 and many investigators believe that NC is the result of an ascending bacterial infection from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. However, rates of bacterial isolation using traditional methods have varied greatly, from less than 20% to more than 60% in affected cats. 8, 10 When isolated, common bacterial species include Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Clostridium spp., and Staphylococcus spp. Samples for aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures should be obtained in any cat suspected of having cholangitis; gallbladder bile is preferred to liver tissue as the culture source. 14 Treatment with a broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy, focusing on enteric flora, is recommended pending results of culture and susceptibility testing. Prognosis for cats with NC is typically good with aggressive treatment, although sequelae may include bile duct obstruction, acute necrotizing pancreatitis, sepsis, and multiple organ dysfunction.",

Corticosteroids are the only class of drug shown potentially to provide benefit 19 and their use is indicated in patients with signs of hepatic failure. Other immunomodulatory drugs that may be used include ursodeoxycholic acid, metronidazole, azathioprine, and cyclosporine. Colchicine may delay progression of hepatic fibrosis.

Activity of serum liver enzymes is increased in many but not all cases and varies in severity.

The commonly isolated serovars in small animals include Leptospira icterohaemorrhagiae, Leptospira canicola, Leptospira pomona, Leptospira hardjo, Leptospira grippotyphosa, and Leptospira bratislava. Infection in dogs most commonly results in acute renal failure, although hepatic involvement may occur in 20% to 35% of cases. 3, 23 Other clinical manifestations of infection include pulmonary hemorrhage, uveitis, and acute fever. 24 Infection in young animals and infection with serovars L. icterohaemorrhagiae and L. pomona are more likely to result in hepatic involvement. 25 Affected dogs may show acute hepatitis or develop chronic hepatitis with subclinical acute infection. Although cats are generally resistant to leptospirosis, experimental infection with L. pomona has caused hepatic lesions in this species. 3 Patients with hepatic involvement show increased activity of hepatic enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP), although ALP often is affected most severely. Hyperbilirubinemia and signs of hepatic failure may occur. Diagnosis of leptospirosis usually is based on clinical suspicion because of renal and hepatic involvement combined with serologic evidence of infection. However, antibody titers may be negative during the first week of infection, and antibody production may persist for only 2 to 6 weeks. 3 Suspected patients with negative antibody titers and a short duration of illness should be treated as though they have leptospirosis, and antibody titers should be repeated in 2 weeks. Histopathologic changes in the liver of affected animals may include coagulative necrosis and infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells with lesser numbers of neutrophils and macrophages. Organisms may be identified in biopsy specimens with silver staining, but this is an insensitive diagnostic test. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques to detect organisms in blood and urine samples are available. These techniques have not been well studied in dogs with clinical disease, but they are likely to make this diagnosis less challenging in the future. Historically, treatment recommendations have included penicillin to eliminate the leptospiremic stage, followed by doxycycline to eliminate the carrier state. However, treatment with doxycycline alone is effective for the leptospiremic stage and carrier state (5 mg/kg PO/IV q12h). 24 Penicillins may be used in animals that do not tolerate doxycycline.
