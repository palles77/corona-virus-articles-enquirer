Cohort 3 comprised hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) patients. A total of 115 patients (1.6%) among 6052 (17/1647, 12/2013, and 86/2392 in cohorts 1, 2, and 3, respectively) were SAFV-positive. The samples from 82 SAFV-positive patients were successfully sequenced, and four genotypes were identified: 8 SAFV-1, 41 SAFV-2, 29 SAFV-3, and 4 SAFV-6. A significantly higher detection rate was found in the HFMD patients than in other two cohorts (both P ,0.001). A higher frequency of severe clinical outcome and nervous system manifestation were also observed in the SAFV-positive HFMD patients. Additionally, 6 (3.5%) cerebrospinal fluid and 7 (2.2%) serum samples from the HFMD-associated encephalitis patients were SAFV-positive. Based on the VP1 sequences, all four genotypes displayed distinct geographical clustering. SAFV infection might be associated with a wide clinical spectrum and contribute to HFMD.",

Cohort 1 comprised hospitalized patients with acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI), which was determined based on cough, rhinorrhea, dyspnea, and/or acute fever.37.5uC. For recruited patients, nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) samples were collected upon hospital admission. Cohort 2 comprised outpatients with diarrhea, who had. 3 loose stools in the previous 24 hours. Patients who had confirmed inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, cystic fibrosis, food intolerance, or patients who had any apparent clinical respiratory signs or symptoms were excluded. Stool samples were collected from the recruited patients. Cohort 3 consisted of patients who were diagnosed with hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), according to the guidelines released by the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China (http://www.moh.gov.cn/publicfiles/business/htmlfiles/ mohyzs/s3586/201004/46884.htm). The outpatients were generally mild, with fever, and manifested at least one of the following features: maculopapular or vesicular rash on the palms, and/or soles, vesicles or ulcers in the mouth. Hospitalized patients were diagnosed with severe HFMD if they manifested one of the following additional complications: encephalitis, meningitis, AFP, or cardiorespiratory failure. For all HFMD patients, stool samples were collected, whereas for some cases, stool, throat swab, and serum samples were collected. In addition, CSF was additionally collected for some cases diagnosed with encephalitis. Healthy children who were recruited from the community during the same study period were used as controls, from whom stool, throat swab, and serum samples were also collected. None of the recruited healthy children exhibited ARTI, diarrhea, or HFMD-related symptoms during the recent one month of recruit.",

For the Chinese lineage, an obvious geographic-specific distribution was observed, with strains from three locations grouped separately into three sublineages. All the SAFV-1 cases from the current study were grouped into the Chongqing sublineage, regardless of the cohort group. In SAFV-2, five lineages were constructed, which included European, North American, Middle-Eastern, Japanese, and East Asian lineages ( Figure 2B ). The strains from the present study were grouped into East Asian lineage, which, however, diverged from those from Beijing or Thai strains. In SAFV-3, six lineages were formed depending on the geographical origin. The Chongqing strains in this study were classified into the Asian lineages, forming a sublineage that was distinct from the strains of other regions ( Figure 2C ).

On the other hand, although the HFMD cohort was tested using stool, respiratory, blood, and CSF samples, an over-estimation of infection rate was not generated, because stool samples offered the highest diagnostic sensitivity. When we took no account of the patients with stool negative while other sample types are positive, a prevalence rate of 3.1% was still obtained.

The co-detection of SAFV with other viruses ranged from 0% to 100% in previous studies, and the variation in results is probably due to different diagnostic assays applied [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . In the present study, 15 common respiratory viruses in ARTI patients, 9 common viruses in diarrhea patients, and all EVs in HFMD patients were detected. The current results might represent a higher probability of single infection than the previous studies. Still, single-infection by SAFV is only true relative to the list of viruses that are being tested. Second, this study also revealed the negative detection of SAFV in healthy children, indicating that SAFV is less likely to be present in asymptomatic subjects. This result is consistent with a previous study that was conducted among 39 asymptomatic patients in northern Germany 11 . Finally, more severe clinical outcome and manifestation of nervous system were exhibited by SAFV-positive HFMD patients than in SAFV-negative HFMD patients.",

For ARTI and diarrhea cohorts, no differential clinical manifestations were inferred from the patients with SAFV single detection or SAFV co-detection, probably due to small sample size for comparison. However, for HFMD patients, we found the co-detection of SAFV could aggravate the clinical outcome of EV71 infection. We are uncertain whether SAFV/EV71 co-detection can lead to synergies in the HFMD pathogenic mechanism, and therefore responsible for the pathogenesis of severe HFMD, which need further investigation in the future. Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of SAFV in CSF, but it was only limited to the case report 25, 34 . In 2011, SAFV-3 was isolated from the CSF sample of a 9-year old boy with aseptic meningitis 34 . SAFV-2 was subsequently detected in the CSF and fecal samples of one child with cerebellitis as well as in the CSF, blood, and myocardium of another child who died suddenly with no history of illness 25 . In the current study, the existence of SAFV-3 was observed in the CSF and SAFV-2 was observed in serum samples from the patients with HFMD-associated encephalitis. Furthermore, among half of the SAFV-positive CSFs and sera, SAFV was the solely detected pathogen. This information provided the first valid estimation of SAFV in pediatric encephalitis.",

The common agents of viral encephalitis include herpes simplex virus 1, varicella zoster virus, EV, Epstein-Barr virus, human herpesvirus 6, and measles virus 35, 36 . However, an etiological diagnosis was reached in less than 50% of the cases despite the use of modern microbiological and radiological methods 35, 37 . The list of uncommonly observed etiological agents for pediatric encephalitis remained far from complete. Animal experiments have suggested showed that both SAFV-2 and SAFV-3 can infect the heart and the central nervous system of 129/Sv mice 39 . Furthermore, they found that SAFV-3 was more neurotropic than SAFV-2, and intracerebral inoculationof SAFV-3 into FVB/n mice caused acute encephalitis 39 . In the current study, the existence of SAFV-2 and SAFV-3 was observed in the patients with HFMD-associated encephalitis. The present results, together with those of the earlier studies, indicate that SAFV-2 and SAFV-3 might play a role in the pathogenesis of viral encephalitis. However, these results warrant further confirmation by independent studies.",

The high frequency of SAFV in the stools, CSFs, and sera of children with HFMD and the absence of SAFV in healthy children suggest that this new virus might contribute to HFMD, especially in HFMD-associated encephalitis. This finding has important public health implication for HFMD disease control, especially among severe HFMD patients. Although with various patient types and large sample size, the major findings in the present study, especially the causal relationship between SAFV and the clinical disease, should be confirmed by serological study in the future.
