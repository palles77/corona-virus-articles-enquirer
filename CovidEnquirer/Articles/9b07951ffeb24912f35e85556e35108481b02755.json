Methods: The National Health Insurance claims data of Taipei were analyzed. We calculated the changes in utilization between June 2002 and June 2003 to estimate the impact that SARS had on utilization. Results: The top three disease categories with the most significant drop in utilization were gastroenteritis (\u221253%), acute bronchitis (\u221245%), and tonsillitis (\u221240%) in ambulatory care and acute bronchitis (\u221282%), gastroenteritis (\u221272%), and pneumonia (\u221264%) in inpatient care. On the other hand, the disease categories with the smallest reduction were allergic reactions (\u22124%), skin infections (\u22126%), and anxiety (\u221210%) in ambulatory care and respiratory failure (+40%), delivery (\u22122%), and fractures of lower limbs (\u22125%) in inpatient care. Conclusions: Disease categories could be classified into three groups according to the extent of change in utilization during the SARS outbreaks. Diseases with a prominent reduction were respiratory diseases, minor problems, and elective procedures. Diseases with a moderate reduction were mainly chronic diseases. Diseases with a limited reduction were acute conditions, difficult mental disorders, or procedures that could not be postponed. The utilization of some diseases shifted significantly from medical centers to district hospitals or clinics.",

The CCS grouping scheme, which was composed of 260 mutually exclusive disease categories, was developed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) for the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). CCS categories are revised regularly in response to ICD-9-CM annual changes, and the entire CCS can be downloaded for free from the Internet [10] . CCS has proven to be a good classification scheme for casemix adjustment [11] and for utilization studies [12] . One special feature of the CCS grouping scheme is that diseases with a similar etiology across organ system chapters are combined [13] .",

On the other hand, most patients with chronic diseases need regular medications. To solve this dilemma, many hospitals provided a medication mailing service for patients with chronic diseases. We therefore found a moderate decrease in utilization by patients with chronic diseases.",

Indirect evidence of this negative impact is represented by the reduction in notification of tuberculosis in Hong Kong during the SARS epidemics.

To avoid infection with SARS, healthcare workers would see patients less frequently were reluctant to partake in aggressive treatments, such as suction of sputum or using mechanical ventilation. An indirect indication of the poor quality of care was the increased number of admissions due to respiratory failure in all levels of health facilities.

Additionally, given that we used the utilization data from 2002 as a reference, it was unlikely that coding errors would differ within 1 year. Thirdly, because we confined our analysis to the 25 most utilized CCS categories, we therefore lost information on changes in utilization amongst many of the other less common CCS categories.
