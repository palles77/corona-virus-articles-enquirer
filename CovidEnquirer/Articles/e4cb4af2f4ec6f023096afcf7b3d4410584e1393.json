The ability of gremlin-1 to induce fibrosis in organs and transduce angiogenesis makes it a target for cancer therapy. RNAi-based therapy has proven to be very efficient and specific in tumor growth inhibition. The efficacy and specificity of siRNA-mediated gene silencing depends on the designing approaches. Here, empirical guidelines for siRNA design and comprehensive target site availability analysis were used to select effective siRNA from a plethora of potential candidates designed using several computation algorithms. Then, the selected siRNA candidates were subjected to stringent similarity searches in order to obtain siRNA candidates with reduced off-target effects (high specificity). The best candidates were compared to experimentally successful gremlin-1 siRNAs in order to predict the silencing potency of the selected siRNAs. siRNA-6 (sense strand: 5'-CCAAGAAAUUCACUACCAU-3'), siRNA-7 (sense strand: 5'-CCAUGAUGGUCACACUCAA-3') and siRNA-47 (sense strand: 5'-GGCCCAGCACAAUGACUCA-3') were predicted to be highly effective siRNA candidates for gremlin-1 silencing. These siRNAs can be considered for RNAi-based therapy because off-target effects are predicted to be minimal.",

The physiological versatility of gremlin-1 explains why the protein is linked to several human pathologies [6] and cancer progressions [7-9]. Gremlin-1 induces fibrosis in many organs which results in progression of several pathologies including diabetic nephropathy and pulmonary hypertension [10] . Moreover, gremlin-1 mediates thrombo-inflammation in some cardiomyopathies [11] . Over the years, considerable evidence depicting gremlin-1 as an oncogenic and pro-angiogenic factor has been reported. The overexpression of gremlin-1 in tumor cells as well as their neighboring stromal cells has been observed in several carcinomas including those of the breast [12] and colon [13] . Apart from modulating BMP signaling, gremlin-1 can be involved in a BMP-independent signaling via vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) to promote angiogenesis [14] .",

RISC has an ATP-dependent RNA helicase domain that separates the two strands of the siRNA.

High scoring siRNA candidates therefore exhibit enough nucleotide-based features required for effective gene silencing. As shown in Table 2 , four siRNA candidates scored at least 75%. The ideal length of siRNA for effective gene silencing is still a subject of controversy in the design of siRNA. The dicer-mediated processing of dsRNAs results in short sequences (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) of siRNA with 2 nucleotide overhangs. Longer siRNA sequences (25) (26) (27) have also been reported to be functional because the dicer will process such sequences [29] . The GC content of an siRNA duplex is a parameter that can define the gene silencing efficacy of siRNAs. A moderate occurrence of GC in the siRNA (\u224832%-\u224858%) is preferential [24] . GC content of the high scoring siRNAs ranged from 34% to 58% (Table 2) . A high GC% delays unwinding of siRNA duplex by nuclear helicases whereas a low GC% slows hybridization of siRNA to target mRNA [24] .",

Effective design of siRNA candidates is crucial, as non-specific siRNAs can produce unwanted effects. Several research groups reported sequence-based features of effective siRNAs and developed guidelines for siRNA design. In this study, guidelines proposed by three different research groups were used to select the best siRNA from a number of candidates designed using reliable computational algorithms. In Table 2 , the highest scoring siRNA candidates are shown. These siRNA candidates achieved more than 75% based on the scoring criteria, hence, satisfy the sequence requirements for effective siRNA. Small interfering RNA molecules that satisfy the Ui-Tei guidelines were able to cause a significant reduction in firefly luciferase activity and also in chick embryo [22] . Meanwhile, siRNA candidates that obeyed the nucleotide composition demands of the Amarzguioui guidelines were described as functional [24] . Nucleotide sequence preference improve siRNA silencing efficiency as bases at particular positions define target recognition and cleavage [23] . For example, 'A' but not 'G' or 'C' is preferred at the 19 th position of the sense strand (Reynolds rule) in order to facilitate selection of siRNA entry into RISC [38] . Formation of stable intramoleular hairpin secondary structure may reduce availability of siRNA strands to mediate gene silencing. The secondary structures for all selected siRNA candidates were predicted with Sfold. The Srna algorithm of Sfold generate the secondary structure of the RNA with the minimum free energy (Table 2 ).",

This was to reduce off-target effects of siRNAs, a major challenge in RNAi-based therapy [16] . The three siRNA candidates shared a maximum of 78% similarity with other transcripts not recognized as gremlin-1. However, RNA transcripts are subjected to processing including splicing of intron segments to form mature mRNA. It is possible that the homologous nucleotides in the other transcripts are not components of an mRNA sequence. Furthermore, the mRNA target for this study was searched and aligned against human transcript and genome database and all the hits were identified as gremlin transcripts (see Supplementary Fig. 3d) The selected siRNA candidates were compared to experimentally functional siRNAs, in order to evaluate the silencing potential of the designed siRNAs in this study. Reference [39] used gremlin-1 siRNAs to silence gremlin-1 mRNA in a study to determine the effect of gremlin-1 on BMP2-induced osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. The siRNA sense strands used are designated as H1, H2, H3 and H4 in Table 2 . The functional siRNAs (H1 and H2) were compared with the selected siRNAs in this study in terms of preferred sequence features for effective silencing. All three selected siRNAs in this study outscored H1 and H2, suggesting that they are effective siRNA candidates to silence human gremlin-1.",
