In January 2014, intestines from a deceased neonatal piglet, which had severe diarrhea, were positive for PEDV by real-time reverse transcription PCR, and PEDV was sequenced per request of the veterinarian. The sample was processed for next generation sequencing and analyzed by mapping to reference strain USA/Colorado/2013 (7) . During the assembly of PEDV strain USA/Minnesota188/2014 (GenBank accession no. KM077139), a region of the spike only had 5\u00d7 coverage and ambiguity bases in the consensus contig whereas the coverage across the remaining PEDV genome was 50\u00d7. The consensus contig was separated at this region, and the 2 separate contigs were created. After remapping, the 2 contigs were aligned back into a new consensus contig, and the new consensus contig was remapped to verify the accuracy of the contig, which had 50\u00d7 coverage.",

The role of genetic changes in the US PEDV strains to clinical disease has yet to be reported. The clinical presentation of diarrhea in this case was reported as equally or more severe than such presentation in cases caused by the prototype PEDV Colorado/2013. Other factors such as concurrent infections and the rate of group exposure, which is rapid in most PEDV cases affecting neonatal piglets, may influence the clinical presentation.",

Animal studies are required to define the effects of these mutations on clinical disease, pathogenesis, immunity; these studies will be conducted in the future with the S2aa-del strain. A consistent model to properly evaluate these differences is required to control PEDV infection. The most compelling need is to understand how exposure by sows to different PEDV strains correlates with protection of piglets from clinical disease. Whether the PEDV S2aa-del strain will circulate in the North American swine population is not known.",

In experimental animals, intermittent diarrhea has been observed, sometimes containing blood or mucus, in addition to a loss of appetite, progressive anemia, and, especially, blood eosinophilia, a sign which, as in humans, indicates that the infestation is recent. Under natural conditions, the disease is believed to be mainly subclinical and chronic. It should be noted that the acute form of the disease is more common in sheep (5) . With regard to lesions, the disease is closer to intestinal schistosomiasis (caused by S. mansoni) than to urinary schistosomiasis. The lesions are characterized by the formation of gray-white granulomas \u00b35 mmin diameter, or by polyps, and intestinal hemorrhaging due to bleeding of the granulomas formed during migration of the parasite's eggs to the intestinal lumen. In the liver, granulomas may also be observed, as well as fibrosis of the portal vein. Hepatomegaly and cirrhosis may also be present. These lesions are caused by adult parasites in the mesenteric vessels and the portal vein.",

The alignment indicated a spike gene nucleotide deletion at positions 164-169 (TTG-GTG), which corresponded to amino acid deletion at positions 55 and 56. The spike gene amino acid alignment identified substitution at positions 23 (I), 31 (H), 57 (K), and 59 (E), which have not been identified in the complete PEDV genomes available from North America.",
