These NPs are effective in the distribution of medications to target specific organs and control drug delivery. These drug carriers not only transport drugs to sites of cancer or other target diseased organs, preventing damage to healthy cells, but also protect the drug from degradation [3] . Some of the metal nanoparticles (e.g., gold, silver, or PLGA) themselves may have dual functions, working both as carriers and as targeted delivery systems using the membranes of cancer cells, which contain tumor-associated markers. In a recent study, Fang et al. used a membrane from mouse melanoma cancer cells in the outer layer of PLGA nanoparticles. These NPs were stable and persisted in the structure during cellular endocytosis, activating the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and presenting especially to T cells that have TCR binding to gp100 and inducing the production of IFN-g. Moreover, the authors found that the PLGA covering membrane had receptors that allow interaction with cancer cells and delivery of the drug [4, 5] . Furthermore, the NPs were used to deliver drugs to the specific site of organ transplantation to prevent rejection. Systemic immunosuppression is a high risk for recipients of organ transplantation, as it uses high doses of immunosuppression agents that make them more susceptible to infections and in some cases cause death. Previous studies found that diabetic mice were transplanted with islets into the eye to prevent islet graft immune rejection in vivo using rapamycin MPs. The islets transplanted with the immunosuppressed drug MPs survived more than 1 month compared with the control (empty MPs), which rejected the islets in the second week [6] .",

However, new variants of antibiotic-resistant pathogenic microorganisms have emerged and are becoming a challenge for designing new vaccines and adjuvants. Until now vaccines have been developed from live-attenuated microorganisms or killed pathogens (first-generation vaccines) [7] , DNA vaccines (third-generation vaccines), subunit vaccines [8] , and synthetic peptides (second-generation vaccines). The last three vaccine types eliminate the risk of developing the disease, but they must be used in conjunction with an adequate adjuvant or delivery system (Table 7.1). The combination of  the vaccine with the adjuvant or delivery system  should be safe, stable, and have the ability to  induce long-lived memory B and T cell  responses, preferably with a single dose and a maximum of two doses and be free from strict storage requirements [9] . DNA and RNA vaccines are safe but need a second boost with recombinant protein or DNA from another vector. NPs have become an alternative to targeting vaccine delivery to immune cells, improving vaccine efficacy with slow release, easy antigen uptake, and induction of humoral and cellular responses [8] .",

They are composed of lipids, which have a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail that maintain hydrophilic inner and outer membranes, in lamellar lipid bilayers or in multilayers that simulate vesicles found within cells [22] . Liposomes can induce cellular responses or humoral responses, depending on the charge, size, and lipid composition. A previous study showed that charge had the main role in activation of the cellular or humoral immune responses. The authors' approach was to investigate the importance of the antigeneliposome interaction in immunogenicity and depot formation. They used subunit antigens Ag85Be ESAT-6 (pI \u00bc 4.9) from TB, and \"CTH1\" (pI \u00bc 9.0), from Chlamydia vaccines and a model antigen, lysozyme (pI \u00bc 11).

Once at the lymph nodes, the nanocarriers deliver their cargoes to APCs for immune processing. (C) Nanovaccine properties can be tuned to efficiently deliver their cargoes for maximum immune activation. For example, NPs can be modified to target specific subsets of immune cells. They can also be delivered to specific intracellular compartments, where receptors for immune pathways can be triggered. ",

Previous studies have shown that DDA induces proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines after infiltration of monocytes and macrophages in vivo [24] . One of the advantages of liposomes is mimicking properties of the pathogens, inducing humoral and cellular immune responses. The antigen's presentation to APCs depends on the membrane characteristics, size, and ligand-receptor binding. Liposomes could induce Th2 responses if the lipids are unsaturated whereas saturated lipids promoted Th1-type immune responses [25, 26] . Liposomes could be modified according to the needs of delivery to produce Th1, Th2, Th17, or Tfh immune responses. Cationic liposomes can increase the uptake of subunit vaccines as synthetic peptides and recombinant proteins; this can be explained by the interaction between positively charged liposome with the APCs that have a negative charge in their membrane [26, 27] . Another modification is the pH-sensitive fusogenic liposomes, which are stable in neutral pH 7.4, but in acidic conditions, the antigen is released and presented by MHC class I or II. These liposomes containing phosphatidylethanolamine and amphiphilic stabilizers allow PE-containing liposomes to form aggregates, due to the poor hydration of their headgroups, which can explain their high affinity to adhere to cell membranes [28, 29] . Another study designed a unique structure composed of inter-bilayer-crosslinked multilamellar vesicles (ICMVs), which is stable in the extracellular environment but rapidly released in endosomes/lysosomes, thereby enhancing vaccine immune responses. The ICMVs carried the antigen OVA mixed with the adjuvant monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA). This mixture amplified vaccine responses and upregulated the costimulatory cells on splenic and bone marrow DCs. In addition, splenic DCs incubated with the OVA \u00fe vaccine MPLA triggered proliferation of na \u20ac ive OT-1 CD8 \u00fe T cells in vitro, suggesting that the ICMVs enhanced cross-presentation of the antigen. The same results were obtained in vivo after the vaccination of mice with the mixture, and the ICMVs elicited robust antibody titers that were w1000-fold greater than simple liposomes. These results could be attributed to activation enhancement of DCs and antigen cross presentation [30] . The first use of liposomes as a delivery system for a malaria vaccine was in the 1980s. Ballou et al. synthetized peptides derived from the repetitive region of the circumsporozoite (CS) protein of Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites. The synthetic peptides were conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) proteins and were incorporated into liposomes. Immunized mice and rabbits produced antibodies against the repeat region of the protein with biologic activity correlated with protection [31] . RTS, S is the only vaccine against malaria that is in phase three clinical trials in Africa. The RTS, S vaccine has the central repeat region of CSP, and T cell epitopes localized in the C-terminal region are fused to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast. This virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine also contains MPLA and QS-21, which enhances humoral and CD4 \u00fe T cell responses in the first 4 years, with a level of protection of 18%e36%. Protection decreased rapidly thereafter, with negative efficacy in some children. The problem is not RTS, S nor the adjuvant system, as both induce potent immune responses. However, the CSP part of RTS, S is an antigenic polymorphism, and T cell epitopes present on the CS protein that are incorporated into the vaccine are also polymorphic. To address this problem, the newest generation of this vaccine is coformulated with Matrix-M, a saponin-based liposomal adjuvant [32] . However, the vaccine protection against P. falciparum has not been achieved due to the short-lived memory cells and the evasion mechanisms of the parasite [33] . The first malaria vaccine was tested in 1967 in animals using Plasmodium berghei s radiation-attenuated sporozoites, with a 100% of protection [34] . Hoffman et al. reported in 2002 that 10 human volunteers were vaccinated with irradiated sporozoites of P. falciparum strain NF54, and all of them were protected between 2 to 9 weeks [35] . This vaccine will be used to vaccinate 360,000 children a year in three African countries (Ghana, Malawi, and Kenya). The vaccine could prevent 4 in 10 cases according to previous clinical trials.",

The NPs and MPs (PLGAePEG) were loaded with tetanus toxoid peptideeFITC linked to a LyseLys cathepsin cleavage site and an anti-DC-SIGN antibody. The DCs targeted PLGAbased vaccine NPs but not MPs. The NPs were efficiently taken up with the help of anti-DC-SIGN antibodies and induced proliferation of T cells (Fig. 7.3) .

NPs have been designed from metals and nonmetals, polymeric materials, lipids, VLPs, and bioceramics, giving distinctive physicochemical and electrical characteristics that specifically interact with a targeted cell or organ. However, NPs can enter easily into the human body by crossing lipid bilayers and may interact with sensitive organs [48] . The clearance and excretion of NPs is mediated through the mononuclear phagocytic system, the renal urinary system, and by biliary clearance. Macrophages phagocytize the NPs and keep them in the secondary lymph organs and/or liver using the Mertk (Mer) receptor (the same receptor tyrosine kinase family as Axl and Tyro-3), which is responsible for promoting apoptotic cell engulfment and supports platelet aggregation and clot stability in vivo [49] . In addition, Kupffer cells, which are liver macrophages, sequester 100-nm nanoparticles [50] . When the particles are 5 nm in diameter, they are rapidly cleared from the circulatory system via renal filtration [51] . On the other hand, some studies have shown that metallic NPs (MeNPs) have effects on innate immunity. Specifically, in vitro assays showed that MeNPs have some cytotoxicity and genotoxicity and interfere with cytokine production and gene expression due to receptor modifications. The response of the innate immune system to threats is mediated by inflammation and the production of cytokines, chemokines, free radicals (nitric oxide) [52] , and other reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this process, there is an accumulation of oxidized glutathione (GSSG), generating stress from the proinflammatory signal (involving TLRs) on the MeNPs and causing cell death and cancer [53] . Other studies have shown that adenovirus VLPs combine with a gene to control Gelsinger's ammonia metabolism (encoding ornithine transcarbamylase), which invades all the organs and induces severe reactions that can lead to death [54] . Other severe side reactions have been reported as carcinogenesis or germline alterations observed in animal models, in which the VLPs can become widely dispersed in the body, and the viral vector could end up in the ovaries and testes [55] . Eudragit is a drug delivery polymer: poly (ethyl acrylate-comethyl methacrylate-cotrimethylammonioethyl methacrylate chloride) 1:2:0.1. It has been reported that using NR8383 macrophages cocultured with NP/ERS, the NPs were close to the inner membrane of the mitochondria, as observed by transmission electronic microscopy. The authors also analyzed genes responsible for mitochondrial function by microarray and found that Opa1 was reduced in expression. This gene helps to maintain network morphology and dynamics and in the regulation of the signaling pathways for cell death, and NP/ERS-treated cells reduced glutathione (GSH), stimulating ROS production. Due to unbalancing of oxidanteantioxidant homeostasis and changes of proteins implied in activation and autophagy, the mitochondria decay through phagophore and autophagosome formation, and mitophagy can occur [11] . The NPs are characterized for their size (<100 nm) with greater surface area per mass compared with larger-sized particles of the same chemistry causing NPs more active biologically. The physicochemical properties of the material could increase the uptake by the antigen-presenting cells, but they can go to other tissues that can generate adverse biological effects such as apoptosis or necrosis. There are some materials that can be degraded easily.",

Nevertheless, intranasal immunization with NPs had been reported to cause lung injury through oxidative stress, which induced the production of cytotoxic cellular responses and inflammatory cytokines. Another problem with the NPs is the aggregation that may block the blood vessels in the host. Modifications of polymeric NPs with PEI have been used to prevent the recognition to other cells such as epithelial cells in the lung. Other technologies could be used as the singlechain fragment region of antibodies binding to NPs, which recognizes the specific receptor on dendritic cells or macrophages that may deliver the antigens to target organ. Other modifications in the NPs have been used as PLGA covered with PEG (PLGAePEG) and formulated with tetanus toxoid peptideeFITC linked to a Lyse Lys cathepsin cleavage site and an anti-DC-SIGN antibody, which help the delivery to DCs but not macrophages, with enhanced efficient proliferation of T cells [56] . Negatively charged NPs prevent the activation of the immune system and induction of immunotolerance, therefore preventing the effect of exacerbated inflammatory responses. Nanoparticles can also be engineered to be porous to increase the diffusion of intracellular proteases, resulting in earlier processing of APCs and presentation T cells [57] . In addition, some NPs carrying antigen and adjuvant in the same NP are less efficient to induce the immune response than the ones with adjuvant separated from antigens in different NPs. This may because of the competing effect of coactivation in several pathways [58] .",

Despite advances in immunology, it is critical to understand the mechanisms of entry of NPs into cells and activation of the adaptive immune response and related toxicity. Some approaches inhibit the cytokine and chemokine cascade with DCs and T and B cells. NPs have great potential in immunology, although in-depth study of toxicity is necessary. In addition, NPs require molecules, such as antibodies or ligands, that bind to receptors on target cells to ensure that NPs only adhere to those cells. Any modification should be tested in cell lines or animals to prevent side effects or death. The synthesis of NPs can be shifted to methods that generate reproducible nanoparticles in terms of size (<10 nm, allowing elimination by the kidney), shape, and composition (biodegradable materials) to reduce cytotoxicity.",

DCs were incubated with FITCeTT containing MPs (green; light gray in printed version) for 1 h to confirm uptake by human DCs. Cells were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The cell surface was visualized by MHC class II staining (blue; white in print version). The image represents the middle focal plane of the DCs, with the iris set at 2 nm (A). Presentation of PLGA-encapsulated FITCeTT peptide was studied by culturing DCs for 18 h in culture medium alone, medium supplemented with empty PLGA MPs (PLGA), or with 0.1 mg of FITCeTT peptide encapsulated within PLGA MPs (PLGA TT). In addition, DCs were pulsed with 1 mM TT peptide as a positive control for antigen presentation (TT). Subsequently, autologous TT-responsive peripheral blood lymphocytes were added. After 3 days, cellular responses were assessed in a proliferation assay. Data are mean proliferation indices AE SD relative to medium control for experiments performed in triplicate.

The NPs and MPs were stained with fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies and analyzed on a flow cytometer (B). PLGA MPs were mounted on glass slides and analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy to visualize antibodies present on the particle surface. FITCeTT peptide was detected as a green (light gray in print version) fluorescent ring surrounding the PLGA particles (see also Fig. 7.2A).
