Early small-scale surveys indicated that the epidemic was serious, but the true scope of transmission was largely unknown until 1996, when a large-scale survey was carried out among plasma donors in Fuyuan, Anhui Province, showing an HIV prevalence of 12.5%. 12 To respond to this crisis, China's Blood Donation Law was drafted in 1996 and enacted in 1998. The most important components of the law highlight voluntary donation and prohibit repeated commercial donation. At same time, nationwide blood collection facilities were established and manual collection of blood or plasma was prohibited.",

The language of early documents was carefully selected to avoid condoning 'social evils', such as prostitution and drug use. Terms such as condom social marketing, needle social marketing and community-clinic-based therapeutic treatment for drug users were used to describe HIV prevention measures that were incorporated into China's first 5-year action plan (2001-05). 16 China's first 5-year action plan was a policy milestone in terms of supporting effective policies for condom promotion, methadone maintenance and needle exchange. One of most important policy directions laid out in the first 5-year action plan was pilot testing of harm reduction strategies, including methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) and needle exchange programmes. 30, 31 However, implementation of the plan was not adequately budgeted, weakening its impact, particularly in the first 3 years, between 2001 and 2003. After the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak in 2003, public health rose to the top of China's policy agenda, and funding for the HIV/AIDS 5-year action plan increased. 18 China's second 5-year action plan (2006-10) was drafted in a more supportive political environment in which public health was given a higher priority. First, there was much stronger political commitment and financial commitment for controlling HIV/AIDS from Chinese Central Government. In 2003, a new administration led by President Hu Jintao, Premier Wen Jiabao and Vice Premier and the then Health Minister Wu Yi put the implementation of evidence-based HIV policies high on the national agenda. 18 Secondly, China's 'Four Frees and One Care' policy to increase access to anti-retroviral therapy (ART) was announced in late 2003 and had greatly facilitated implementation of HIV prevention, treatment and care and support.",

Another target was set to establish MMT clinics in counties and cities with more than 500 drug users registered with the Public Security Bureau, and for 570% of opiate users to receive MMT services. This target has greatly facilitated the scaling up of the MMT programme in China; for example, the number of drug users receiving methadone increased from 8116 in 2005 to 241 975 in 2009, almost a 30-fold increase. 32 Other targets included:",

Intervention teams have increased the reach of HIV prevention programmes. On average, these teams have reached about 460 000 female sex workers and 120 000 men who sex with men per month. 38 National HIV/AIDS regulation In early 2006, the Chinese government issued the national HIV/AIDS regulation to define the roles and responsibilities of government, civil society and people living with HIV/AIDS.

By the end of 2009, a total of 680 MMT clinics were set up in 27 provinces/autonomous regions/municipalities. A cumulative total of 241 975 heroin addicts received MMT, with a retention rate of 65.6%. MMT clinics provide free regular HIV and hepatitis C virus testing and counselling services. Needle and syringe social marketing and exchanges were gradually expanded; localizing the production of AIDS-related medications and promoting antiretroviral therapy (ART): In 2002, the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Finance, State Taxation Administration, and General Customs Administration jointly obtained the approval of the State Council for a 5-year tariff-free import of AIDS-related medications. In 2003, the Food and Drug Administration approved the production of four anti-retroviral drugs by two domestic pharmaceutical manufacturers. The cost of anti-retroviral drugs was reduced to 3500-4000 Chinese yuan per patient per year, significantly increasing the accessibility of ART; and paediatric ART was launched in 2005. By the end of 2009, a cumulative total of 79 946 adults and 1793 children received ART in 1821 counties across China. 23 AIDS POLICIES IN CHINA ii7 policy, HIV testing was performed at all entry points into China. Those who meet the criteria for HIV testing at the entry were requested for HIV testing. Over time, it became clear that HIV-positive foreigners were not driving HIV transmission in China. The first major outbreak of HIV infection in China occurred in 1989 among injecting drug users along China's border with Myanmar, 7 and few infections were transmitted from HIV-positive foreigners entering China. 10 In 2004, China's national surveillance system indicated that HIV prevalence among aliens entering China was 0.147%, with the highest rate along the border between China and Myanmar. Between 2007 and 2009, foreigners accounted for 0.3% of reported HIV infections in China's HIV/AIDS data system.28 China temporarily lifted its travel ban for special events, such as the Asian Games in 1990, the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995, the Global Fund Board Member Meeting in 2007 and the Olympics in 2008.
