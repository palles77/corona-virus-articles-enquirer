The BALB/cV subline was used to study the molecular basis of potential virus-host interactions involving cell surface-expressed MMTV proteins. Cell surface iodination identified virus-specific proteins expressed on BALB/cV primary mammary tumor cells grown in culture. In contrast to (C3H)MMTV-producing cell lines which expressed MMTV gp52, BALB/cV tumor cells lacked gp52 and expressed instead a 68K, env-related protein. The 68K\"\" protein was also detected on the surface of metabolically labeled BALB/cV tumor cells by an external immunoprecipitation technique. The expression of 68Kp\"\" was restricted to mammary tissues of BALB/cV mice that also expressed other MMTV proteins.

The expression of viral-specific antigens at the surface of virus-infected or -transformed cells may be important for several reasons. Surface-associated structural proteins are frequently involved in the maturation pathways of viruses which bud from the cell. Additionally, surface-expressed viral antigens are more likely to be detected by host immune surveillance systems than are viral proteins localized inside the cell. Thus, immunization strategies would be most logically directed against those exposed antigens. Finally, the possibility exists that virus-specific cell surface antigens might be shed from the cell and serve as tumor-blocking factors, with subsequent effects on the host immune regulation of growing tumor cells.",

Electron micrographs revealed numerous intracytoplasmic A-type particles (Fig. 9A) , as well as virus particles budding into intercellular spaces (Fig. 9B , see arrows). Type-B morphology, typical of MMTV, was noted with the extracellular virus particles (Fig. 9C, see arrows) . DISCUSSION This report describes a thorough analysis of the expression of MMTV-specific proteins on the surface of BALB/cV mammary tumor cells. In contrast to other MMTV-producing systems in which gp52 is the main viral cell surface protein detected (for a review, see Schochetman et al, 1980) , the BALB/cV tumor cells lack detectable levels of MMTV gp52 on the cell surface. Instead, we identified a 68K env-related protein. The finding of a highmolecular-weight form of the MMTV env protein on the cell surface in the absence of properly processed gp52 is not unique to the BALB/cV system, having been reported for GR lymphoma cells , DBA/B leukemia cells (Racevskis and Sarkar, 1982) , and BALB/c D-2 preneoplastic mammary cells (Slagle et cd., 1985) . In those reports, the aberrant expression of an unprocessed env precursor at the cell surface was associated with a lack of virus production. Therefore, the BALB/cV system differs from those in that type B virus particles are readily detected by electron microscopy in BALB/ cV tumors (see Fig. 8 ).",

First, the 68Ke\"\" protein may represent an MMTV env precursor from which the leader sequence has not been removed. The size of the predicted MMTV leader sequence varies (11,000,7000, or 5700 Da), depending on which of the three potential methionine starts is utilized in viva (Redmond and Dickson, 1983; Majors and Varmus, 1983) . Thus, the BALB/cV 68K\" is approximately the size expected of a 60K apoprotein 'plus an uncleaved 7000-Da leader. The molecular process that might allow a protein to retain its leader sequence is unclear. One possible explanation involves the intracellular location of env mRNA translation. In the avian sarcoma virus system, 10% of the pp60Wcspecific mRNA is translated on membrane-bound ribosomes (presumably resulting in plasma membrane-localized pp60Wc), while the remaining 90% is translated on free ribosomes (resulting in cytoplasmic localization of the protein; Purchio et al., 1980) . Any MMTV env mRNA similarly translated on free ribosomes might be expected to retain its leader sequence. However, the mechanism by which the 68K\"\" would then get transported to the cell surface is unknown.",

It remains to be determined whether the env gene of Mtv-8 in BALB/c mice contains the same termination codon as observed in Mtv-8 of GR mice. Such a mutation conceivably could result in the phenomena of aberrant processing and instability of the protein in the plasma membrane reported for 68K\" in this paper.

Several possible explanations for this observation can be considered. Mature gp52 may indeed be in the plasma membrane, but oriented such that it is inaccessible not only to surface iodination (Figs. 2-4, 6) but also to labeling by the NaB3H., technique. Alternatively, gp52 may be present in its normal conformation, but may be interacting with 68K\" such that it is hidden by the. larger protein and unavailable for labeling. Such an interaction would involve a gp36 portion of 68K\", since gp52 and gp36 have been shown to associate in forming the spikes of the viral envelope (Dion et al, 1979; Westenbrink and Koornstra, 1979; Racevskis and Sarkar, 1980) . It is also possible that properly oriented surface gp52 is present, but at levels below detection using the available techniques. Finally, we must consider the possibility that BALB/cV tumor cells lack cell surface gp52 and that 68K\" is providing the function of serving as the cell surface budding site for maturing virus particles (discussed below).",

We must consider the possibility that the MMTV expression observed in BALB/cV tumors is coming from more than one proviral template. For example, the 68K\" might be expressed from a defective provirus, while the virus particles are produced from the proviral template of the milk-transmitted (BALB/ cV)MMTV. Alternatively, the milk-transmitted proviral template might also be defective. In this scenario, the properly processed env-gene products found in BALB/cV tumor cells could be explained by occasional readthrough of a termination codon in the env gene of Mtv-8. A final consideration in determining the template for 68K\"\" expression is that the primary tumors in this study arose from a dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA)-induced preneoplastic HAN outgrowth line (Cv-2; Slagle et aL, 1984) . The aberrant processing of the BALB/cV env gene is not unique to this particular outgrowth line, nor is it due to a mutagenic effect of DMBA treatment, because the same surface 68K\"\" can be detected on normal mammary tissue from lactating BALB/ cV mice and in hormone-induced preneoplastic BALB/cV tissue (Table 1) .",
