Objective: To evaluate the correlation of viral load as well as viral and bacterial co-infections with disease severity in hospitalized children with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). Study design: This is a prospective study conducted in children admitted for LRTIs for two seasons. To determine viral and bacterial load of respiratory pathogens we performed multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction and semiquantitative bacterial cultures on nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA). Results: During the study period 244 (60%) children were hospitalized for LRTI with acute virus-induced wheezing and 160 (40%) for radiologic confirmed pneumonia. In the first NPA, viruses were identified in 315 (78%) of the 404 samples and bacteria in 198 (63.3%) of 311 samples. The viral load significantly decreased between the first and second NPA sample in most single and viral co-infections, except rhinovirus and human bocavirus infections. Viral load was inversely related to CRP in RSV infections, whereas a positive correlation was observed in adenovirus infections. Duration of hospitalization was significantly longer in RSV single infections compared to rhinovirus single infections whereas in the latter, leucocytosis and use of systemic steroids was more common. In RSV viral co-infections the presence of fever, leucocytosis, and the use of antibiotics was significantly more frequent. Positive cultures of Haemophilus influenzae dominated in RSV and rhinovirus single infections and Moraxella catarrhalis in RSV viral co-infections. Conclusions: Specific viral single and co-infections as well as viral load contribute to disease severity in children with LRTIs.",

All positive results were confirmed in a monoplex-assay and quantified using plasmid standards. The sensitivity and specificity was as demonstrated as described elsewhere. 12 The specimens were simultaneously submitted to the Institute of Medical Microbiology and Hospital Hygiene of the University Hospital D\u00fcsseldorf where standard bacterial cultures were performed. For standard bacterial cultures NPAs were plated on Columbia agar for aerobic and anaerobic cultures, chocolate agar and MacKonkey agar (bioMerieux, N\u00fcrtingen, Germany) and incubated at 36 \u2022 C for 48 h. Aerobic Columbia and chocolate agars were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 . Cultures were examined after 24 and 48 h. The results of the bacterial cultures were expressed in semiquantitative steps: \"no bacterial growth\", \"occasional pathogenic bacteria\", \"moderate amount of pathogenic bacteria\" and \"abundant pathogenic bacteria\".",

            "text": "The comparison of clinical characteristics of RSV and rhinovirus infections revealed a shorter duration of hospitalization in rhinovirus infections, but a more frequent use of systemic steroids in rhinovirus infections. Physicians may tend to treat LRTI caused by rhinovirus with corticosteroids due to initial severity of presenting symptoms. A recently published controlled clinical trial demonstrated a benefit of systemic prednisolone in children with picornavirus (i.e. rhinovirus or enterovirus) LRTI. 22 The high incidence of fever and leucocytosis might explain the higher rate of antibiotic use in RSV viral co-infections compared to RSV single infections in our study. However, viral factors may be responsible for RSV subgroup-related disease severity differences, including differences in the ability of certain viruses to promote a pathogenic inflammatory host response. 23 Previous studies have investigated the relationship of viral load and viral dynamics to etiological role and disease severity in respiratory tract infections. 24, 25 Gerna et al. found a significant drop in RSV viral load between admission and discharge in children hospitalized for RSV LRTI. 8 In contrast, Bosis et al. did not find a significant impact of the RSV viral load on the disease severity in children admitted to hospital for the first episode of acute wheezing. 16 There were also no significant correlation of viral load and disease severity in human bocavirus infections. 26 This study is the first to investigate the influence of the viral load and viral dynamics of a broad range of respiratory viruses and different clinical correlates of disease severity and inflammatory parameters in blood in a multiplex PCR assay. We found a consistent fall of the viral load between admission and discharge in single infections with most of the viral pathogens (significant for RSV, parainfluenza virus and hMPV single and additionally adenovirus co-infections). Since patients were discharged from hospital when they were clinically improved, a relationship between viral load and disease severity can be assumed. Our findings are in agreement with a very recently published study in children with acute respiratory tract infections that has shown a correlation between clinical improvement and a reduction of viral quantity after 3 days of hospitalization. 27 A high initial viral load at presentation may represent a recent infection, a low viral load a past infection, but an additional study powered to confirm this aspect has to be performed.",

            "text": "However, we hardly found a strong correlation of viral load with clinical characteristics. A significant negative correlation between the absolute viral load in RSV infections and an elevated C-reactive protein in serum and presence of a leucocytosis was detected. Accordingly leucocytosis occurred in RSV infections significantly less frequently than in rhinovirus infections. It is possible that RSV could depress the signs of infection in blood. Suppression of the induction of interferons by the NS1 and NS2 proteins of RSV has also been demonstrated in human epithelial cells and macrophages. 28 Purcell et al. recently proposed that an abnormal white blood count is of limited use for the detection of concurrent bacterial infection in RSV infections. 29 In contrast, adenovirus infections have been demonstrated to promote acute-phase response with elevated CRP in children. 30 Respiratory infections with certain bacteria may be associated with predisposition for certain types of viral infection or vice versa. The colonization rates for M. catarrhalis, H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae in healthy children are high and depend on various factors. 31, 32 A few population based studies suggest a relationship between RSV infections and invasive bacteria. 33, 34 Increased numbers of non-typeable H. influenzae (NTHi) and Streptococcus pneumoniae adhering to human respiratory epithelial cells have been detected in RSV infections in vitro. 35 In this study M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae were the most commonly detected bacterial agents. In RSV and rhinovirus single infections H. influenzae detections dominated while in RSV and rhinovirus co-infections M. catarrhalis was more frequently found. Therefore, a positive link between infection or colo-nization with certain bacteria and viral co-infections may be assumed.",
