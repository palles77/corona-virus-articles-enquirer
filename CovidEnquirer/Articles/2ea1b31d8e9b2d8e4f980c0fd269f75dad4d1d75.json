The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practice (KAP) of hand hygiene in primary care settings. Methods: A cross-sectional study using a self-reported questionnaire was conducted in primary care settings located in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, under the service of King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC). The Institutional Review Board of KAMC Research Centre approved the study. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS software. Results: A total of 237 participants were included in the analysis. Participants who received hand hygiene training within the last 3 years (2012\u00c12014) scored higher on a knowledge scale. Generally, there was an overall positive attitude from participants toward hand hygiene practice. In total, 87.54% acknowledged that they routinely used alcohol-based hand rub, 87.4% had sufficiently decontaminated hands even under high work pressure, and 78.6% addressed that this practice was not affected by less compliant colleagues. Conclusion: Practicing hand hygiene was suggested to be influenced by variables related to the environmental context, social pressure, and individual attitudes toward hand hygiene. We believe that addressing beliefs, attitudes, capacity, and supportive infrastructures to sustain hand-hygiene routine behaviors are important components of an implementation strategy in enhancing health care workers' KAP of hand hygiene.",

In 1983, Semmelweis highlighted that cleansing contaminated hands with antiseptic products before and after contact with patients may reduce health care-associated infections (4) . Thereafter, CDC published the first formal guidelines on handwashing practices in hospitals (5) , followed by guidelines from the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC) (6) .",

            "text": "Understanding the knowledge, attitudes, and practice (KAP) of handwashing among health care professionals is essential to bring forth a sustained change in behaviors of individuals and institutions and to improve such practices when designing interventions. Several factors are involved in hand hygiene behavior such as attitude, perceived social norm, perceived behavioral control, perceived risk for infection, hand hygiene practices, perceived role model, perceived knowledge, and motivation (7) . Despite the number of published studies on hand hygiene, many questions concerning attitudes and knowledge of health care workers (HCWs) remain unanswered. This is particularly true in primary care settings where the volume of patients and complexities of cultural, institutional, and health policy factors can influence the practice of handwashing. Various studies have confirmed an inverse relation between intensity of patient care and adherence to hand hygiene practice (8\u00c110). Additionally, the current burden of the spreading Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) implied an action to review our basic strategies in hand hygiene practice. In a descriptive study (47 cases), MERS-CoV was found to be associated with substantial mortality in admitted patients who have medical comorbidities (11) . This calls for effective infection control measures in health care settings, in particular hand hygiene. Hence, KAP of hand hygiene will continue to be a concern and are essential to explore to bridge the theory\u00c1practice gap. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the KAP of hand hygiene among primary care health workers.",

This was done because all the instruments in the literature were designed and worded according to a hospital setting. The first instrument was developed by expert groups from the World Health Organization as a knowledge and perception questionnaire (12) . The second one was adapted because of its wider contextual factors compared with the WHO instrument, such as the social support and norms that could influence the attitudes of HCWs toward hand hygiene practice (13) . Questions related to hospital settings, such as questions about hospital bed contact and peripheral catheter insertion, were excluded.

This is essential, in particular, with the current epidemics of MERS in the Arab countries, when all HCWs need to be vigilant to prevent and control such infections in the community.

            "text": "Practicing hand hygiene among HCWs was suggested to be influenced by variables related to the environmental context, social pressure, and the actual and perceived risk for cross-transmission and to a positive individual attitude toward hand hygiene (8) . This is particularly true in the current surge of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia at the national level and Middle East at large, where HCWs have to be vigilant to strict infection control procedures such as hand hygiene practice. In Saudi Arabia, it has been found that some of the nurses did not follow infection control procedures fully and therefore had maximal exposure to MERS-CoV (18) . Social cognitive and psychological determinants (i.e., knowledge, intention, beliefs and perceptions) might provide some insight into hand hygiene behavior. This has been explained by the social cognitive theory, which is widely used to explain behaviors and behavioral intentions in different social situations. Social Cognitive theory has also been used to explain adherence to hand hygiene practice among nurses (19\u00c121). This theory postulated that behavior (practice) could be anticipated from intention, which, in turn, is molded by personal attitudes, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norms (22) . Hence, intention is assumed to be the most instant factor to determine behavior.",
