The well-recognized pioneers who had promoted this field, particularly at the international level, are the late Dr. Alexander Hollaender and the late Dr. Frits Sobels. Through their independent efforts, they had organized workshops in countries where the field of environmental mutagenesis were non-existence. From these activities, many scientists in these countries had received education and training to initiate their careers and scientific societies that were committed to the field of environmental mutagenesis. With dedicated effort from many scientists, the initiatives from the late Hollaender and the late Sobels continued to flourish and became sustainable programs. Many of these programs are subsequently promoted by the EMS-Hollaender Fund for International Programs of the Environmental Mutagen Society and the International Association for Environmental Mutagen Societies. One sustainable program is the series of conferences known as the International Conferences on Environmental Mutagens in Human Populations.",

Besides conducting research studies, they also considered opportunities in organizing outreach activities such as conferences. They recognized that the ongoing series of International Conferences on Environmental Mutagens have been organized once every 4 years but these conferences are held specifically in well-developed countries. There was a lack of such conferences of the similar caliber that were held in developing countries. They also recognized that many scientists from the latter countries would not have the resources to travel long-distance to attend International Conferences in Expensive Cities. Therefore, they decided to organize a series of conferences that would be held in countries where the field of environmental mutagenesis is in the developmental stages and where environmental health is of major concern locally and regionally. The overall objectives are to enhance the awareness of and to identify solutions to human environmental health problems, to facilitate interactions and to foster international collaborations.",

They brought their idea to Dr. Sobels (at that time, Dr. Hollaender had passed away already) with the anticipation that they would have to answer a lot of difficult questions, such as their experience in organizing international conferences and the financial commitment to the conference. At that time, the answers to the two questions would have been \"no\", except that the two were committed to take on the challenge. Dr. Sobels listened to the presentation carefully and appreciated their honest answers to his questions. He maintained his positive attitude towards the proposal. His only recommendation for change was that they should consider organizing only one meeting and evaluate the outcome before considering additional conferences. Most important of all, he felt that the proposed conference would succeed and he would take an active role in soliciting international sponsorship. The tremendous trust he had placed on the two junior and untested scientists was extremely stimulating and the trust instilled confidence in them. The three worked together for the following 3 years to develop the scientific program, solicit financial support and organize the conference. With the help from Dr. Sobels, the conference received support from many sponsors, notably the EMS-Hollaender Fund for International Programs and the International Association for Environmental Mutagen Societies. The Cairo Conference was so successful that the participants requested the organization of additional conferences according to the similar topic. Subsequent meetings were organized by Dr. Au in collaboration with Dr. Sram, Dr. Chulasiri and Dr. Ribeiro in Czech Republic, Thailand and Brazil, respectively ( Fig. 1 ). All conferences were tremendously successful and they generated numerous new collaborations and sustainable programs. The following is a brief description of the accomplishments and unique challenges for each conference. Different areas of accomplishments are highlighted for each.",

Wagida Anwar and William Au were co-chairpersons for the conference. The objective of the conference was focused on the state of knowledge on environmental, biological, genetic and reproductive problems affecting humans from exposure to environmental mutagens. The 6-day conference was organized into symposia, oral contributed presentations, poster sessions and workshops. The conference attracted over 200 participants and 199 abstracts from 31 countries. More than half of the participants were from the Middle East and Africa. Invited speakers were requested to submit manuscripts of their presentations for publication in the meeting monograph. The monograph was published in Environmental Health Perspectives [1] . With 56 manuscripts in 338 printed pages, the monograph is an impressive issue. These accomplishments certainly justified international status of the conference and the value of hosting the meeting in countries where the field of environmental mutagenesis is in the developmental stages.",

At the end of the meeting, the participants were bused back to Bangkok for their departure. Khao Yai was obviously a major contrast to Bangkok in terms of size, social activities and geographical setting. Its small size and remoteness actually created tremendous opportunity for the participants to interact with each other for 3 days.

The scientific program of the conference included topics such as the identification of genes involved with environmental diseases, use of genomics in understanding toxicological responses and the functional evaluation of polymorphic genes for susceptibility. Specific symposium topics were: (1) mechanisms of mutagenesis and carcinogenesis, (2) biomarkers for mutagen exposure and for prediction of health risk, (3) health impact of environmental pollutants, (4) genetic and acquired susceptibility to environmental disease, (5) genome-based technology for toxicology and health, (6) health impact of food-borne mutagens and antimutagens and (7) unique concerns for environmental health in Latin America.",

Like the previous meetings, the quality of science was outstanding. There were over 600 participants in the conference representing 27 countries. Besides the outstanding oral presentations, there were approximately 300 poster presentations. Therefore, participants in the conference achieved scientifically and socially rewarding experience.",

            "text": "Anyone who is involved with organizing international conferences would agree that these meetings take extraordinary dedication and perseverance to overcome unique challenges. The most significant challenge is that each conference needs to be financially self-supportive, with a budget of approximately US$ 150,000. Other challenges include problems caused by differences in language, time zone, means of communication, currency, customs, regulations and laws. In addition, the ICEMPH are held in less developed countries which are located in regions with generally less stability in politics and economy than well-developed nations. For example, the 1st ICEMHP Conference in Egypt was delayed by 1 year due to the Gulf War. The 2nd Conference was held in Prague soon after the former Eastern European Communist countries became independent. These countries were in the middle of drastic social and financial changes. The 3rd Conference was held in the middle of the Asian financial crisis. The 4th Conference was held in the middle of the global financial hardship, the war in Iraq and the threat of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) infectious disease. Nevertheless, due to the tremendous effort of the organizers and the generous support of sponsors and participants, each conference was highly successful in overcoming challenges and in achieving the objectives. The local organizing committees for the conferences should be recognized for their dedication, perseverance and unique contributions. In addition, all the invited speakers were aware of the financial status of the conferences. Therefore, they have contributed their own funds to help defray the cost to attend the conferences.",

It is not an exaggeration to state that the ICEMHP Conferences provide outstanding value to many scientists that could not have been possible in other means. All participants gain academic knowl-edge and social value that were useful for improving scientific careers and quality of life. Future success of this series of conferences will be based on continued improvement of the scientific and social value of the conference, and generous contributions from dedicated scientists and sponsors.",
