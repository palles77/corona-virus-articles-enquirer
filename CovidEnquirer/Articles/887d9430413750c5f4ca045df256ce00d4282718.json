Although chest radiograph and computed tomography are the commonly used diagnostic tools for the early diagnosis of lung manifestations of infections, they lack the specificity for the wide range of chest infections which can occur in immunocompromised patients. Systematic analysis of the imaging findings in correlation with the clinical settings along with comparison with the old images can expedite early and accurate diagnosis for subsequent appropriate management. Computer tomography findings in immunocompromised patients with respiratory infections, with regards to various clinical settings, will be discussed here.",

ICPs as a result of organ transplantation are vulnerable to infections with cytomegalovirus (CMV) and rarely Herpes virus. Coronavirus and Hantavirus infections are commonly observed during seasonal and non-seasonal outbreaks. Pneumonia due to multidrug-resistant organisms such as S. pneumoniae (DRSP) or S. aureus (MRSA) are often seen in ICPs. Viral infections can be also be complicated by secondary bacterial super-infections. Fungal infections are very common in ICH with leukemia, cancer chemotherapy or organ transplant, mainly seen in later stages of immunosuppression either as a primary infection or as a result of a super-infection. Pneumocystis jiroveci Pneumonia (PJP) constitutes the most frequent opportunistic fungal infection. Other common fungal infections reported are Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans, and Cryptococcus neoformans.

Correct interpretation of abnormal radiological findings is limited by several factors, such as insufficient clinical information and failure in obtaining old radiological imaging for comparison. Furthermore, overlapping imaging features of different organisms, lack of experience of the radiologist, subtle findings which are difficult to correlate and co-morbidities (such as congestive heart failure, cor pulmonale, radiation induced changes etc.) pose further difficulty in correct assessment of radiological changes.

Chemotherapy induced patchy pneumonitis is not uncommon and should be considered in differential diagnosis when approaching lung parenchymal changes [21] . These are anticipated changes in later stages of chemotherapy regime. However, Paclitaxel and anti EGFR agents may show similar changes in the earlier cycles of chemotherapy. Many cytotoxic agents and the new agents may show GGO and consolidation (mTOR antagonist like Everolimus, Temsirolimus, Bleomycin) or a COP like image. Some drugs (Gemcitabine) may cause capillary leakage syndrome and few agents may cause interstitial changes due to heart failure (Doxorubicin).",
