The current methods used for the laboratory diagnosis of influenza include virus isolation by cell culture, direct antigen detection (DAD), and nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT). Virus isolation by cell culture permits identification of infectious virus with fairly high sensitivity, but is time-and resource-consuming and largely limited to specialized laboratories. DAD has been widely used because of its short turn-around time (TAT), but is limited by its lower sensitivity, especially in adult patients and those presenting several days after symptom onset [4, 5] . NAT is characterized by high sensitivity and specificity, semi-quantification in real-time formats, and its amenability to automation and multiplexing [6] . However, NAT requires a molecular diagnostic laboratory with skilled personnel, appropriate instrumentation, but rarely delivers results with TAT of <6 h.",

RespiFinder-22 \u00ae served as the primary reference test. A second prospective series of 225 samples submitted between December 2014 and February 2015 (cohort 2) compared only Alere TM Influenza A&B with RespiFinder-22 \u00ae . Discordant results were retested using the local in-house QNAT [7]. The 436 nasopharyngeal swabs were taken from 178 females and 258 males (median age, 4 years; interquartile range [IQR] 0-49 years) for influenza diagnostics between February 2014 and May 2014 and December 2014 and February 2015. Of the 275 pediatric patients, 140 (50.9%) were less than 1 year old. Of the 161 adult patients, 69 (42.9%) were older than 60 years. 423 samples (97.0%) were analyzed prospectively from fresh samples, 211/436 were examined in parallel with all 4 methods (DADs, isothermal NAT and multiplex NAT). For 13 (3.0%), testing was done retrospectively from frozen samples. Alere TM Influenza A&B, BinaxNOW \u00ae Influenza A&B, and Sofia \u00ae Influenza A + B testing was performed as described by the manufacturer. The average assay time was 15 min for Alere TM Influenza A&B and BinaxNOW \u00ae Influenza A&B, and 20 min for Sofia \u00ae Influenza A + B.
