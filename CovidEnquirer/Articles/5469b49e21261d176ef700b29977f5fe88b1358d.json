            "text": "a b s t r a c t CXCL10 is part of the group of interferon-stimulated genes and it plays an important role during different viral infections by inducing cell activation, chemotaxis and lymphocyte priming toward the Th1 phenotype. In this study, we investigated in vitro the effects of CXCL10 in activated human primary T lymphocytes in terms of apoptosis or survival, and delineated the signaling pathways that are involved. CXCL10, in combination with IL-2 and/or IFNa, induces apoptosis in T lymphocytes. Moreover, CXCL10-induced activation of CXCR3 also triggers pro-survival signals that can be blocked by pertussis toxin. The analysis of the downstream signaling kinases shows that apoptosis is p38 MAPK-dependent and the pro-survival signals rely on the sustained activation of PI3K and the transient activation of Akt. On the other hand, the transient activation of p44/p42 ERK did not have an impact on T lymphocyte survival. We propose an immunological model in which CXCL10, together with other co-stimulating cytokines, participates in the activation of T lymphocytes, promotes survival and expansion of certain lymphocyte subsets, and induces chemotaxis toward the infected tissues. On the other hand, CXCL10 might contribute to the triggering of apoptosis in other subsets of T lymphocytes, including those lymphocytes that were transiently activated but later lacked the appropriate sets of specific co-stimulating signals to ensure their survival.",

Although initially identified to be an IFNc-responsive gene, a number of different cytokines including IFNa/b are capable of inducing CXCL10 expression in diverse cell types. The chemokines CXCL4, CXCL9 (Mig), CXCL10 (IP-10), and CXCL11 (I-TAC) bind the receptor CXCR3 and exert a potent chemotactic effect on activated T lymphocytes [5] ; however, CXCL10 is the one that plays the most prominent role during the antiviral responses. CXCR3 is expressed on 35-40% of normal blood T cells and its expression is enhanced by treatment [6] with IL-2. Additionally, CXCR3 is expressed on other cell types such as natural killer cells (NKs), eosinophils, B lymphocytes, and different epithelial and endothelial cell types. CXCR3 is a receptor that is coupled to a G protein-signaling pathway. Binding of chemokines to CXCR3 activates G protein-mediated signaling and results in downstream activation of phospholipase C (PLC), kinase A and C, formation of phosphatidyl inositol-1,4,5-triphophate, and also the increase of intracellular calcium ions [7] . Despite the functional diversity of the cells that can express CXCR3, the downstream activation seems to be quite homogeneous, involving p44/ p42 ERK, Akt, PI3K and p38 [5, 8, 9] . However, the effects of CXCR3 activation are very diverse, ranging from chemotaxis in T lymphocytes [8, 10, 11] and airway epithelial cells [9] to anti-proliferation in human embryonic kidney cells [10] and induction of apoptosis in acinar cells [12] .",

Apoptosis plays an essential role in tissue development and is required for maintaining tissue homeostasis [14] . Although apoptosis can be triggered by many different stimuli, executioner caspases always participate in the organized degradation of the cellular organelles; when activated, executioner caspases cleave a variety of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins including caspases themselves and their downstream substrates [15] through controlled proteolysis [16] . Induction of apoptosis is a tightly regulated process and it is the balance between prosurvival and pro-apoptosis signals that eventually determines the fate of the cells [17] . Vlahakis et al. have shown that G protein-coupled chemokine receptors can activate both the survival and the apoptotic signaling pathways [18] . It has been reported that CXCL10 can trigger apoptosis in several cellular models, such as acinar cells [12] , neurons [19] , HeLa cells [20] and microvascular endothelial cells [21] ; however, the role of CXCL10 in determining survival or death in blood T lymphocytes remains largely unknown.",

Furthermore, pre-incubation of T cells with IL-2 (400 U/ml), which increases CXCR3 expression but not apoptosis rates ( Fig. 2B and C) , enhanced CXCL10-induced early apoptosis dramatically (Fig. 4C ). Cell incubation with IFNa alone (5000 U/ml) also leads to T cell early apoptosis. Moreover, the highest rates of early apoptosis were observed with simultaneous treatment with CXCL10 + IL-2 + IFNa (Fig. 2C) . The cytokine treatments that were tested also produced increased necrosis rates (Annexin V positive, 7-AAD positive) in parallel with the observed rates of early apoptosis ( Fig. 2A and B) . To determine whether the cell death was CASP3-mediated, we analyzed whole cell lysates from T lymphocytes treated with CXCL10 + IL-2 + IFNa; the presence of active were treated with IL2, IFNa and CXCL10 and analyzed by FACS for apoptosis.

CXCL10 (50 nM) induced a transient, time-dependent increase in Akt phosphorylation, reaching the maximum levels in 15 min and returning close to the basal levels in the 60-min time-point (Fig. 4A ). When using a lower concentration of CXCL10 (10 nM), the phosphorylation peak was detected after 45 min of incubation, and the levels were still high 60 min after the beginning of the stimulation (data not shown). These findings were confirmed using western blot analysis (Fig. 4B) . Our results also suggest that CXCL10-mediated Akt phosphorylation is stronger when IL-2 and/or IFNa are present (Fig. 4B) . Next, we examined the activation of the p44/p42 ERK kinases following exposure of peripheral T cells to CXCL10 + IL2 + IF-Na. Exposure of CXCR3-expressing lymphocyte cells to CXCL10 (50 nM) resulted in a transient increase in p44/p42 ERK phosphorylation which peaked after 30 min of exposure to CXCL10 (Fig. 5A  and B) . However, in the assay where different combinations of cytokines were tested, the incubation time was too long (16 h) and the ERK phosphorylation was indistinguishable from the basal activation (Fig. 5B) , indicating that the transient ERK activation had already extinguished. However, considering the other assays Freshly isolated human T cells were cultured in medium alone, or treated with IL-2, IFNa, or CXCL10 or a combination of the three, for the times indicated. Cells were then washed and analyzed by FACS. FACS was performed using an antibody specific for the activated p38 MAPK (phospho-p38 [p-p38]). The results are shown for events in the live cell gate and are representative of at least three independent experiments. (B) Western blots using a phospho-p38-specific antibody (left) were performed on protein derived from human T cells cultured either in medium alone or treated with CXCL10 + IL-2 + IFNa, for the times indicated. The phosphorylation was quantified by chemiluminescence and standardized against the same blots stripped and re-probed with antibodies that recognize total p38 protein. Actin was used as a loading control. Western blots and band quantification (right) in T cells that were untreated or cultured with IL-2, IFNa, CXCL10, or a combination of the three, as indicated, for 16 h. Cells were then lysed and phosphorylation of p38 was determined by western blot analysis using specific antiphospho-p38 antibodies. within this study, it is reasonable to conclude that ERK activation is stronger when CXCL10 incubation occurs in combination with IL-2 and/or IFNa.",

As expected, cells treated with CXCL10 + IL-2 + IFNa, but not inhibitors, showed a notable increase in cell death as compared with the untreated cells (medium only). Both pertussis toxin (inhibitor of G-coupled protein signaling) and wortmannin (PI3K inhibitor) induced a significant increase in the percentage of cell death as compared with the no-inhibitors group. On the other hand, cells treated with SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor) showed similar levels of cell death as the untreated group (medium only), indicating that the inhibitor was able to revert the apoptosis induced by CXCL10 + IL-2 + IFNa. Finally, the inhibitor PD98509 (MEK inhibitor, upstream of ERK) did not modify the levels of cell death as compared with the no-inhibitor group, suggesting that the activation of p44/p42 ERK is not connected with the induction of either cell death or survival. Additionally, T lymphocytes were treated separately with all the inhibitors and no increase in the levels of apoptosis was observed for any of them (data not shown).",

            "text": "The expression of CXCL10 is part of the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) response and its presence is one of the hallmarks of the immune responses during viral infections [2] . During a selflimited influenza infection process, high levels of CXCL10 can be detected during the early stages of the disease, and shortly after the virus has been cleared CXCL10 returns to its basal levels, even though other markers of inflammation and repair may remain elevated beyond that point [1] . On the other hand, in situations where the host fails to control the viral infection the levels of CXCL10, together with other ISGs and inflammatory mediators, human T cells were cultured in medium alone or treated with IL-2, IFNa, and CXCL10 for the times indicated. Cells were then lysed and phosphorylation levels of AKT were determined by western blot analysis using specific anti-phospho-p38 antibodies. Phosphorylation was quantified by chemiluminescence and corrected for total AKT MAPK expression on the strip blot. Total AKT and actin were used as loading controls. Right, T cells were untreated or treated with IL-2 or IFNa or CXCL10, or in combination, as indicated for16 h; phosphorylation of p38 was determined by western blot analysis using specific anti-phospho-AKT antibodies. remain highly elevated throughout the process and possibly cause detrimental effects by means of excessive immune activation and cell death [22] . We found that CXCL10 alone is a very modest inducer of apoptosis (according to the Annexin V results). Consequently, we needed to consider the addition of other lymphocyte activators that are present during antiviral responses in vivo to unleash the full potential of CXCL10. Since CXCL10 shows its true biological effects in combination with other cytokines, such as IL2 and IFNa, the signaling status upon treatment with this combination of cytokines was the focus of our study. It can be argued that the observed downstream signaling might not correspond to a pure CXCL10 response and some of the observed effects might be overlapping with those from IL2 or IFNa. On the other hand, it should be noted that the presence of these cytokines during viral infections is a proven fact that merits scientific attention, while an in vivo response mediated by CXCL10 alone is an unlikely scenario.",

Our observations are in accordance with previous studies which revealed that CXCR3 expression in T lymphocytes is fine-tuned and it is determined by the presence of certain cytokines [24] . It would appear that both CXCR3 + and CXCR3-populations of cells are undergoing apoptosis. While IL2 did not cause a detectable increase in the level of apoptosis (Annexin V) or CASP3 activation (Fig. 2C and D) , CXCL10 and INFa each alone caused a modest increase in apoptosis. The dual combination of Il-2 plus IFNa induced substantially greater levels of apoptosis, and the combination of CXCL10 and IL-2 and the triple combination of IL-2, IFNa and CXCL10 induced the highest levels of apoptosis. Therefore, it is likely that CXCL10 responsive CXCR3 + and CXCR3cells are undergoing apoptosis.",

The highest levels of CASP3 activation resulted only with the combined treatment with CXCL10 + IL-2 + IFNa, closely followed by CXCL10 + IL-2 treatment.

Moreover, in our study we have shown that CXCL10-induced apoptosis was abrogated by the p38 inhibitor SB203580 (Fig. 6) , which confirms the role of p38 in the pro-apoptotic signaling during incubation with CXCL10. The anti-apoptotic Bcl2 has been identified as a p38 MAPK substrate [26] , and by direct phosphorylation of Bcl2, p38 MAPK prevents Bcl2 from exerting its anti-apoptotic function and allows the apoptotic process to occur [27] . Our results did not clearly show any changes in the expression levels of Bcl2 upon incubation of T lymphocytes with CXCL10 + IL2 + IFNa; however, the phosphorylated form of Bcl2 was more prominent in the chemokine-treated group (Supp. Fig. 3 ) which confirms the activity of p38 MAPK.",

            "text": "Induction of cell survival is also a critical role of CXCL10 and other CXCR3 ligands. We found that pertussis toxin dramatically increased the rate of apoptotic T cells treated with CXCL10 + I-L2 + IFNa, indicating that anti-apoptotic signals are G-protein dependent (Fig. 6) ; also, pre-treatment of T cells with wortmannin (PI3K inhibitor) led to a significant increase in cell death (Fig. 6) . The controls treated only with either pertussis toxin or wormannin did not show increased levels of apoptosis (data not shown), ruling out the possibility that these inhibitors triggered pro-apoptotic signals directly. These results show that CXCR3-mediated signaling plays a critical role in the induction of pro-survival signals in activated T lymphocytes; however, the exact mechanism requires further investigation. Later, we studied the activation profile of Akt, which is a downstream signaling mediator of PI3K. Akt was found to be phosphorylated in T lymphocytes treated with CXCL10 together with IL2 and/or IFNa, and its activation was found to be transient; strong Akt phosphorylation can be detected as early as 5 min after stimulation and it is barely detectable after 60 min (Fig. 4) . Akt is crucial for cell survival, proliferation, gene expression and cell migration [8] , and the pro-survival effects are explained, at least in part, by the fact that Akt inactivates the apoptotic factor BAD by direct phosphorylation [28] . PI3K and downstream activation of Akt are closely related; however, additional studies are required to elucidate some aspects of their association, such as the involvement of other PI3K downstream signaling mediators, the mechanism through which Akt phosphorylation is rapidly ended, or the conditions that would be necessary for sustained Akt activation. As previously demonstrated for CXCL12 and CXCR4, the loss of Akt signaling after transient activation may be the triggering event for chemokine-induced apoptosis [8, 18] . This process might be required not only to promote cell migration, but also to induce programmed cell death in T cells when CXCR3 ligands are highly expressed. As mentioned above, we found that CXCL10 induced transient phosphorylation of ERK in activated T lymphocytes; however, pretreatment of T cells with the MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059 (MEK is an upstream regulator of p44/p42 ERK) does not alter the percentage of apoptotic cells (Fig. 6) , suggesting that CXCL10-induced activation of p44/ p42 ERK does not play a relevant role in the survival/apoptosis signaling. Taken together, these results highlight the relevance of G-coupled chemokine receptor signaling to promote survival during lymphocyte activation, a mechanism in which the downstream signaling is mediated by PI3K and Akt. 6 . CXCL10 mediated death of T cells via initiation of proapoptotic signals. T lymphocytes were untreated or treated with a combination of IL-2, IFNa, and CXCL10, following separate pre-incubations with the following inhibitors: pertussis toxin (inhibits G-protein coupled signaling), wortmannin (PI3K inhibitor), SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor), and PD98509 (MEK inhibitor). 24 h later, the percentage of T cell death was determined using an Annexin V-PE Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD Biosciences). Fig. 7 . Proposed model of CXCL10 functions during lymphocyte activation. During viral infections and other insults, CXCL10 is produced in response to interferon signaling. IL-2, which is also part of the early immune response, augments the proportion of CXCR3-expressing T lymphocytes and increases their responsiveness. CXCL10 binds its receptor CXCR3, and through transient phosphorylation of Akt and p44/p42 ERK, CXCL10 participates in T lymphocyte activation, survival, proliferation, differentiation and chemotaxis toward the infection sites. However, additional co-signaling is required to maintain long-standing activation, and without it, CXCL10 induces p38-mediated apoptosis, which causes the elimination of lowaffinity T lymphocyte subsets.",

In vivo, CXCL10 participates in the activation of T lymphocytes during viral infections by priming toward the Th1 phenotype and inducing chemotaxis toward the infected tissues, however, the biological role of CXCL10 as modulator of apoptosis and survival in T lymphocytes is still unclear. We speculate that CXCL10 may help to focus the adaptive immune responses by inducing apoptosis of low-affinity T lymphocyte subsets [29, 30] , including those lymphocytes that initially were activated but later lacked the appropriate sets of specific co-stimulating signals to ensure their survival (Fig. 7) . Additional studies in terms of cell maturity, antigen selectivity, and Th1/Th2 phenotype are required to delineate the features of the T lymphocytes that are positively selected by CXCL10 from those which are depleted by apoptosis in the context of a viral infection.",
