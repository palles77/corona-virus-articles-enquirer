The epoxide ring was opened by the attack of benzylate anion at the least hindered site to produce 2-benzyloxymethyl-l,3-dibenzyloxy-2-propanol (410), which was activated as the thiomethyl ether system 411 using acetic anhydride in DMSO. The thiomethyl ether is readily activated by iodine, allowing nucleophilic attack at the methylene position. As a result, compound 411 was coupled to purines and pyrimidines using the silylated base procedure. As usual, the guanine derivative was produced in the lowest yield. The N-7 isomer is produced in significant quantity along with the N-9 isomer. The N-7 isomer crystallizes from solution after removal of the N-acetyl group from the direct condensation product. The route chosen to the adenine derivative involved 6-chloropurine in the condensation step. Very little of the N-7 isomer is present at the end of the reaction. The chlorine at position 6 is readily displaced by ammonia to give the adenine derivative (84CJC1622; 87BBA127). Only the guanine derivative had an ED-50 of less than 100 pg/ml with HSV-1.",

The crystal and molecular structure of Penciclovir (BRL 39123) and Famciclovir (BRL 42810) were determined. In the former, the plane of the acyclic N-9 substituent is orthogonal to the purine ring. It has an extensive network of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. In Famciclovir, however, there are no major hydrogen bonding interactions, but there are r--8 interactions between parallel overlapping pyrimidine moieties (90MI2).Thepyrimidine ring in 499 could be constructed by the condensation of 492 with acrylamide 498, followed by base-catalyzed cyclization to = H, R' = Bn 496 R NH2, R' = Bn 497 R NH2, R' = H SCHEME 95 494 Sec.

The synthesis of the chiral isomers allowed identification of the (+)2S,3R as the most potent ADA inhibitor. This led to enhancement of ara-A activity against human pancreatic and colon carcinomas.

Alternatively, it was formed from the D-xylose derivative 735 by partial hydrolysis to 734, followed by tosylation and then benzoylation. Reaction of 733 with the sodium salt of bases gave 736. Hydrolysis of the isopropylidene group followed by periodate oxidation, reduction, and then debenzoylation gave 737The synthesis of the enantiomeric threo analogs started from D-or Larabinose (79CCC593). Thus, the adenine analog 743 was prepared from D-arabinitol738 by conversion to the benzyliaene derivative 739. Its periodate oxidation and reduction gave 740, whizh was tosylated and then benzoylated to give 741. Reaction of 741 with the sodium salt of adenine gave 742, which was deprotected to give 743.The racemic DL-threo derivative 747 was prepared starting from ethyl DL-tartarate, whose reaction with dimethoxypropane gave 744. Subsequent reactions, as shown in Scheme 144, gave 745, then 746, which was deprotected to 747. An analogous synthetic procedure was also done for the preparation of the racemic erythro derivative (79CCC593).Eritadenine (750) is one of the significant hypo-cholesterolemic components of Lentinus edodes sing. Moreover, eritadenine and its stereomers have antiviral effects against vaccinia, vesicular stomatatis virus, and measles (85MI4). Several methods has already been elaborated for its synthesis. Thus, reaction of 4-amino-4-deoxy-~-erythronic acid (748) with 4-amino-6-chloro-5-nitropyrimidine followed by reduction of the nitro group gave 749, whose cyclization with formamide gave 750 (69E1237). The condensation of 2(R),3(R)-O-protected dihydroxybutyrolactone 754 with the sodium (79CCC593). )wed by hydrolysis gave 750 ( reaction of methyl-5-0-tosyl-2,3-O-isopro~ (751) with the sodium salt of adenine gave t 3C1573). Alternatively, ene-P-D-ribofuranoside :orresponding reversed nucleoside 752, whose deprotection gave 753 and whose oxidation gave 750 (73JOC2887). This approach is convenient and was used successfully for the synthesis of analogs with different configurations and chain lengths [7OJCS(CC) 10471. The enantiomeric and racemic forms were also prepared (84MIP1). The ethyl-4-(2-amino-6-chloropurin-9-yl)-2-hydoxybutyrate was prepared by alkylation with the 2-h ydroxy-4-bromobutyra te ester (85USP4495 190). freshly prepared triflyl azide, followed by liberation of the 4'-hydroxyl group using DOWEX (90TL4879).",

The use of 2,3-diaminopyridine gave the two corresponding isomeric products (96UP3).
