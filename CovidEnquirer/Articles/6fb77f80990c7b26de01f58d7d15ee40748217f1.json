This article describes 3 of these important and less emphasized issues: first, the ambiguity of the definition of voluntary nonremunerated blood donation and its relationship to an adequate blood supply; second, the current inadequacies of cost recovery from the blood service system; and third, the lack of a universally implemented program of hemovigilance. Currently, there is controversy regarding these challenges. Open recognition and discussion offers the prospect of bringing solutions closer to reality.",

The infrastructure of blood services has become more coordinated and consolidated, and performance has improved. In China, there are 3 types of facilities exclusively collecting blood and supplying hospitals in their localities. According to their range of functions undertaken and services provided, administration level, and locality, blood establishments are categorized as provincial blood centers, prefectural regional blood banks, or small county blood banks usually located in remote areas. All blood establishments are public, independent of each other, and under the supervision of local government and health authorities. There were approximately 430 blood establishments in 2015, the number being half that present in the year 2000. Improvements in both the number of blood donations collected each year and in overall geographic coverage in the collection program indicate that the overall accessibility of blood service provision in China has improved.",

This article focuses on 3 additional challenges that have received less attention: the sustainability of voluntary donations, blood service cost assessment and recovery, and systematic and objective evaluation of blood service safety. These challenges center on the determinants for sustainable motivation of blood donors, the means to financially secure the operation of blood establishments, and the implementation of systematic methods to improve the quality and safety of the entire blood service. Understanding these issues is important to gain a better understanding of China's current blood collection service, predict future trends, and plan a long-term strategy for sustainable and affordable blood services that can adequately meet clinical needs.",

The World Health Organization estimates that a gross donation rate of no less than 1% to 3% of a population is required to meet their basic clinical transfusion demands [9] . However, the donation rate in China was barely 1% in 2015. Given the already low donation rate and the slow growth rate, the number of available blood units must continue to increase by at least 10% to meet the increasing demand for blood. According to the Year Books of Chinese Health released by the National Health and Family Planning Commission (equivalent to a Ministry of Health in other nations), the number of inpatient admissions to hospitals has been increasing at an annual rate of 11.48% or more since 2008 [2] . There is no doubt that the most urgent priority for blood services is to motivate new potential donors and to stimulate those who have historically donated to continue to donate on a regular basis. At the same time, researchers, policy makers, and practitioners of blood service society need to understand the underlying cause of the current slow rate of growth in annual blood collections.",

            "text": "Since the World Health Assembly released its resolution WHA 28.72 in 1975, which calls for member states to promote the development of national blood services based on VNRBD, this altruistically motivated form of donation has been proven to be the cornerstone for both safety and adequacy of blood supply globally (WHA Resolution 58. 13, 2005) [10]. The World Health Organization defines VNRBD as a donation in which \"a person gives blood, plasma, or cellular components of his/her own free will and receives no payment for it, either in the form of cash, or in kind which could be considered a substitute for money. This would include time off work other than that reasonably needed for the donation and travel. Small tokens, refreshments, and reimbursements of direct travel costs are compatible with voluntary nonremunerated donation\" [11] . This definition has been adopted by almost all international organizations devoted to transfusion medicine and by most of national authorities. With this principle, donors do not receive direct benefits or repayment for blood donation in monetary form or its substitutes; the motivation is altruistic. Because of the deeply rooted traditional belief in the personal value of blood to one's own health, the general public in China does not intrinsically see benefit in taking time and effort to donate blood for unknown others without personal return. As a result, it was predictable that implementation of a system of blood donation based on altruistic motivation in China would result in an initial slow growth phase. It takes considerable effort to disseminate information on the importance of blood donation and transfusion and to build a case for altruistic donation practices. Once people have accepted the altruistic principle and become donors, naturally there will be high chances that they will remain regular donors. With more people accepting the altruistic principle, blood collection is expected to enter a sustainable growth phase with a steady increase in the number of blood donations. The authors believe this 2 phase growth pattern to be inevitable: a slowly growing initial phase followed by a sustainable growing phase. Time is also needed for blood services to become more efficient, and to eliminate spurious altruism or nonmonetary forms of compensation, which harm efforts to increase altruistic and voluntary donation [12] . In the long term, as has been proven globally, altruistic blood donation is expected to meet the demands of hospitals and patients. In contrast, blood donation based on personal incentives may be less sustainable and studies have suggested that personal incentives may reduce the number of blood donors in the long term [13, 14] . The anticipated effects of a blood donation system based on either altruistic motivation or on motivation by personal incentives are illustrated in Figure 2 .",

In cases where blood is in a short supply, donors and their families may be prioritized to receive blood that is available should they require transfusion. These privileges are referred to as the \"Give Blood Voluntarily and Use Blood for Free\" provision. The amount of blood that one shall donate to receive these benefits differs by regional regulations. In some places, a single unit donated enables the donor unlimited free transfusions throughout their lifetime. The waived costs are borne by the blood service facility that collected their blood originally. As shown in Figure 1 , the rate of donation increased substantially over the initial 12 years of implementation, but has since slowed substantially. This trend is consistent with the biphasic trajectory of the benefit-driven mode of blood donation depicted with the predications by the authors as shown in Figures 2 and 3 .",

According to this report, for many blood establishments, funding received for provision of services was significantly less than the cost of providing them.

Although the 200-mL collection volume is not favored by blood collection agencies, until the law is amended, the collection volume remains the decision of the donor. When a donation is made for a double unit (400 mL), the revenues to be collected will be doubled too. More double-unit donations will also save indirect expenses that cannot be attributed to a specific unit of blood, such as the expense of public education and donor recruitment, as well as fixed running costs such as human resource, electricity, water, and so on. Among the 174 institutions that participated in the survey, 38% of the blood collected was in double units. This may partially explain how a blood service could remain functional in spite of an unbalanced financial sheet. Another explanation was the significant indebtedness of these institutions. The survey indicated an average debt-to-fixed assets ratio of 21%, ranging from 0 to 180%, which was equivalent to an average debt of RMB 71400 (US $11156) per employee. It should be noted that debts are not allowed for government-sponsored establishments in China. These debts and increasing financial burden threaten the viability of organizations providing vital blood services. It could be a significant concern if these establishments are suddenly required to pay off these debts.",

As for the expenditures, they should have their budgets approved first by supervising agencies of the government. After budget approval, the actual expenses can be reimbursed from the deposited revenues. Governments may add subsidies if the amount of depositions cannot balance the approved expenses. The survey showed that two-thirds of the institutions that participated in the survey were permitted to use up all revenues they collected, and some were granted subsidies from local governments.

The central health authority expects to reach a donor/population rate of 1.5% by 2020, an ambitious increase of 50% over the next 5 years. Challenges are likely to be encountered, particularly related to meeting ever-increasing clinical demands for blood products while maintaining the safety, integrity, and sustainability of the service. Most of these challenges are already being addressed, including but not limited to inappropriate blood utilization [29] , the high prevalence of transfusion-transmitted infections [30] , restrictions on eligible donation ages and intervals, regional differences in development, and isolated information management systems. There are other challenges, however, that are not linked directly to any specific issues, but that are of more strategic significance and have greater long-term implications. Identifying and resolving these challenges will lay the groundwork for an effective and reliable blood service system. This article has identified a number of concerns facing the blood services industry in China that have thus far received inadequate attention. First, the amount of blood donated annually has not kept pace with demand. Second, blood services are being impaired by cost-assessment standards that were inadequate from the very beginning. Third and finally, there is not enough performance measurement in the blood collection and processing system. A number of questions on these issues remain: shall the current mode of donation motivation remain driven by personal incentives, or would it be appropriate to embrace a major change and reaffirm the original principle of VNRBD? Shall blood establishments remain fiscally squeezed, or will cost recovery and government subsides be reassessed and revised regularly? Is it time to implement hemovigilance programs, and if so, shall they be made mandatory or voluntary? The authors believe that highlighting such matters is of primary importance for a sustainable blood program in China.",
