We found that the volume control policy on ambulatory care decreased physician fees and increased both the number of visits and co-payments. However, it did not result in any change in the total medical expenses. A shift in ambulatory care expenditure from BNHI to patients did not improve patient satisfaction. While the patients were comfortable with the waiting line, they were not satisfied with the providers' strategy of limiting quota of visits during a period of time.",

From 1986 to 1999, almost every year, medical centers and regional hospitals grew over 10% in their volumes of ambulatory patients and physician fees, whereas community hospitals were around 8% [4] . It will harm the quality of patient care eventually if hospitals continuously increase their volume without improving their numbers of physicians, and necessary equipments and plants. On January 1, 2001, therefore, BNHI implemented a volume control policy to contain costs and to improve the quality of ambulatory care for regional hospitals and medical centers. By means of such control policy, referrals of some trivial severity of illness patients from medical centers or regional hospitals to the community hospitals are expected. A good referral system will assist medical centers and regional hospitals to take more care of the intensive or acute patients, which is one of their important social missions. Additionally, the referral system has an advantage of changing patient behavior by not squeezing them into medical centers or regional hospitals just for minor dis-eases. Although the policy is for regional hospitals and medical centers, it is recognized that this policy may have influence on both hospitals and physicians since most of the physicians are employees of hospitals in Taiwan.",

Then his/her payments will be the sum of 50 patients multiplied by NT$ 213 and 5 patients multiplied by NT$ 120. The final reimbursement payment for this physician in the particular section will be NT$ 11,250. Nevertheless, if the previous example followed the original payment method, NT$ 207 per visit, the total will be NT$ 11,385. The difference is not much when there is only one physician within one section; however, there will be a significant distinction when amounted to all physicians and all sections.

We used simple random sampling to draw one-half of 25 medical centers and one-thirds of 78 regional hospitals. The initial sample included 13 medical centers and 26 regional hospitals. However, four regional hospitals were deleted from our final study sample because they were closed down in the year 2001. Thus, the resulting sample included 13 medical centers and 22 regional hospitals. Then, we determined 490 patients from medical centers and 510 patients from regional hospitals according to their staffed beds to conduct face-to-face interviews. Only established patients, defined as not first time visit, were included. Sixty patients were not willing to participate and then excluded from this study. Final study sample contained 940 patients with 94% effective response rate.The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Bureau of National Health Insurance. The questionnaire was constructed by structured questions, including questions on the aspects of present visits, self-comparison between this time visit and before the new policy, patient satisfaction, and personal information. An expert review panel was convened to confirm and revise the questionnaire. The panel consisted of three clinicians, three academic scholars, and one health care administrator. The interviewers' training involved both the general introduction to survey interviewing and fieldwork techniques and procedures, and a review of specific aspects of the study for which interviewers were responsible. The period for collecting the primary data was from July 20, 2003 to August 20, 2003 .The second data source for this study included 1999 and 2001 of BNHI claim databases. Initially, there were 25 medical centers and 78 regional hospitals in the year 2001 in Taiwan. We merged 2001 databases with 1999 databases by matching the same hospital scrambled identification numbers (IDs). Only 60 hospitals could be reached. We were certain that in the study, 35 hospitals of primary data were included within the 60 hospitals because these 35 hospitals existed both in 1999 and 2001. The reason for not using 35 study hospitals of primary data only for the secondary analyses was that the real IDs could not be released from BNHI. Therefore, there was no way to match the specific 35 hospitals for secondary analyses. In total, 82,159 observations were taken from 1999 and 96,131 observations from 2001 databases. The data of year 2000 were not used because this particular year was prior to the new policy implementation and many hospitals informally received the information of the calculation formula before the official announcement. In consequence, the hospitals could prepare for responding to the new policy by increasing their ambulatory care visits to assure that their volume threshold is higher than their expectation (please refer to Appendix A for the components of the formula). The claim databases provided detailed data on physician fees, drugs, procedures and treatments, co-payments, and number of visits.",

Patient satisfaction has emerged as an increasingly important measure in the assessment of health care quality. Literature indicate that patient satisfaction, viewed as an outcome of health care delivery, is an indicator of quality of care in patient care settings [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Donabedian describes four specific reasons for investigating patient satisfaction. First, satisfaction is an objective of care; second, satisfaction is also a consequence of that care, and therefore an outcome; third, satisfaction can contribute to the effects of care as a satisfied patient is more likely to comply with advice; finally, satisfaction is also the patient's judgment on the care that has been provided [12] .",

With the implementation of NHI in Taiwan, the patients are sufficiently insured and they have easy access to necessary, not elective, surgical procedures [22] .
