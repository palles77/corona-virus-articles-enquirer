The Si protein is thought to contain the serotype-specific neutralization epitopes and to be the main target of antigenic variation. An alignment with sequences of three strains published previously showed that from the 545 amino acid residues only 243 have been conserved. Clustering of substitutions suggests that most serotype determinants are located within the first 300 amino acid residues of Sl. A phylogenetic tree of the Sl sequences showed very variable rates of divergence. Differences in topology with a tree based on RNAse-Tl fingerprint data indicate that some of the IBV strains have arisen by genetic recombination.",

Initially, IB was effectively controlled by vaccination with live attenuated IB virus (IBV). However, this did not prevent outbreaks caused by variant viruses (10, 13). RNase Tl fingerprinting analysis showed that field strains isolated from such outbreaks are related to vaccine strains (24) suggesting that the new strains have originated from vaccine virus by antigenic variation. As in other RNA viruses, antigenic variation is probably facilitated by the relatively high error rate of transcription (1 Om3) during the transcription of the RNA template and the absence of a proofreading mechanism (18, 33) .",

E2 is processed proteolytically to two noncovalently bound peptide chains, Sl and S2 (6, 34) . S2 contains the C-terminal half of the sequence, including the transmembrane anchor and two long a-helices that form the stalk of the peplomer (14). Sl forms the top part of the peplomer and presumably carries the serotypical determinants. This assumption is based on the findings that all strongly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies recognize Sl , and that immunization with purified Sl, but not with virus lacking Sl , induces neutralizing antibodies (5, 7, 29) .",

Virus growth, isolation of genomic RNA, cDNA synthesis, cloning, and sequencing were carried out essentially as described previously (31).

It has been suggested (9, 37) that in serotype-A strain the clustered substitutions in two regions, HVR 1 (56- 69 in the numbering of Fig. 1 ) and HVR 2 (1 17-133) coincide with neutralization epitopes. Indeed, a mutation in HVR 1 prevented neutralization by two different monoclonal antibodies (9). From the six differences between the serotype-B strains D207 and H6/82, three are in a region corresponding to HVR 2. The epitopes of IBV recognized by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against Sl are conformation dependent (unpublished data). As described elsewhere (25; Kusters et al., unpublished results) , the 30 N-terminal residues of the S2 subunit contain several overlapping conformation-independent epitopes that evoke a weak neutralizing response. Since these epitopes cross-react with antisera against different serotypes, they are not relevant for the serotype of the virus. An alignment of the Sl nucleotide sequences was used to calculate a distance matrix, from which the most likely phylogenetic tree was inferred by a program distributed as part of the PHYLIP package 2.6 (15).

However, this would not explain the similar Sl sequences of V1397 and D1466 vs the common RNase-Tl spots of V1397 and H120. Instead, we propose that genetic recombination has played a role in the generation of antigenie variants. For instance, V1397 may have acquired a D1466-like peplomer gene. In the murine coronavirus MHV, recombination occurs at a rather high frequency (19,X, 26) and may alter the serotype of the virus (27). For IBV, conditions that favor recombination are created in the field by vaccination of chickens with more than one attenuated IBV strain. Thus, infections of cells with two different strains, leading to the formation of recombinants, may very well have occurred.",
