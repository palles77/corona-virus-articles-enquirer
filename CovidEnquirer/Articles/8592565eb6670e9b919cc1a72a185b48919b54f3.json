Consequently, they have become promising targets for inhibitory drug and vaccine development. Structure-function traits common to all members of the family are their small size (ca. 60-120 aa), high hydrophobicity, and the presence of helical domains that transverse the membrane and assemble into oligomeric-permeating structures therein. The possibility that viroporins show in particular conditions any kind of specificity in the transport of ions and small solutes remains a point of contention in the field.",

            "text": "Here we have approached this issue using the Classical Swine Fever Virus (CSFV) protein p7 viroporin as a model. We have previously reported that CSFV-p7 induces release of ANTS (MW: 427.33) from lipid vesicles that emulate the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) membrane, and that this process is dependent on pH, modulated by the lipid composition, and recreated by a C-terminal transmembrane helix. Here we have assayed CSFV-p7 for its capacity to form ion-conducting channels in ER-like planar lipid membranes, and established whether this activity is subject to regulation by the same factors. The analysis of electrophysiological recordings in ER membrane surrogates suggests that CSFV-p7 forms pores wide enough to allow ANTS release. Moreover, we were able to discriminate between two pore structures with slightly different sizes and opposite ion selectivities. The fact that the relative abundances of each pore type depend crucially on membrane composition strengthens the view that the physicochemical properties of the lipid bilayers present in the cell endomembrane system modulate viroporin activity.",

Several viruses encode at least one protein displaying ion channel (IC) activity. These proteins are known as viroporins, the term being first proposed when it was observed that several proteins involved in virus-promoted cell membrane permeabilization shared common characteristics [1] . The list of identified viroporins is constantly growing, especially in RNA viruses [2, 3] . Thus, the M2 of influenza virus (IFV) [4] [5] [6] [7] , the p7 of hepatitis C virus (HCV) [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] , the vpu of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] , and the poliovirus (PV) 2B [18] [19] [20] [21] proteins are only some members of this list found in prominent human pathogens. Accordingly, viroporin activity blocking by specific inhibitors, and viroporin-defective live attenuated vaccines offer new therapy approaches to treat and prevent viral infection, which reinforces the importance of investigating these proteins [2] .",

They usually contain one (class I) or two (class II) \u03b1-helices long enough to transverse the lipid bilayer [2, 22] . These features enable viroporin insertion and oligomerization in cell membranes forming ion conductive pores, which alters the cell permeability allowing the transport of ions and other small molecules. The IC activity of these proteins is expected to be involved in virus entry, trafficking, morphogenesis and maturation [23, 24] .

Each hydrophobic domain is additionally intervened by a short loop with polar character, a feature also shared by integral membrane proteins that assemble into helical oligomers [22] . CSFV-p7 induces ANTS release from liposomes, a process that requires acid pH and evolves more efficiently in ER-like membranes [38, 42] . The pore-forming activity and its regulation by pH and lipid composition can be recreated by the p7C peptide, representing the C-terminal domain including the TM1-TM2 connecting basic loop (Fig. 1) . In order to improve the topological localization of the viroporin activity, p7-4, a TM2-based peptide lacking the basic loop, was designed. Interestingly, p7-4 also induces ANTS release from liposomes, but the process does not require acid pH and it is not inhibited by classic viroporin inhibitors [42] . These previous results could indicate that the TM1-TM2 connecting loop is essential for the CSFV-p7 activity regulation. Up to date, CSFV-p7 full protein and its constituent domains have been shown to participate in the permeabilization of lipid vesicles [38] , but electrophysiological measurements investigating their poreformation mechanisms at the single channel level are missing.",

This allows for a rough estimation of the channel radius of r~0.5-1 nm. In the context of protein channels, this is a relatively wide pore comparable in size to general diffusion porins [44] .

As displayed in the diagram of Fig. 1, p7N and p7C sequences spanned the potential N-and C-terminal TM1 and TM2 regions of CSFV p7, respectively, and overlapped along the conserved polar loop sequence [38] . In the case of p7-4, the sequence was selected to span the hydrophobic C-terminal TM2 of CSFV p7.

Both p7C and p7-4 peptides exhibited substantial IC activity, in agreement with the high values of leakage induced by these peptides in LUVs.

On the one side, p7C performs like the full CSFV p7 protein both in LUVs and in electrophysiological recordings (Fig. 5A) . On the other side p7-4 shows a distinctive feature in ER membranes. Increasing pH does not inhibit the ability of p7-4 to induce membrane permeabilization (Fig. 5B ). This seems a particular characteristic of ER membranes, because PI lacking control membranes show in both peptide samples very low currents at pH 5. The ANTS leakage induced by p7-4 also shows a significant reduction under these conditions as compared to PI-containing samples. Although the reduction in leakage is not so marked, once again, the correlation between planar electrophysiology and LUVs is maintained supporting our finding that in the absence of the 33 MRDEPI 38 turn, pores could be efficiently formed, but their activity was not pH dependent.

Fig. 6 compiles the histograms of current jumps recorded for lipid bilayers made by first keeping constant the amount of charged lipids (PI fixed) and changing the intrinsic curvature (decreasing PC:PE ratio) and then the other way round (i.e., PE fixed and decreasing PC:PI ratio). As previously discussed (Fig. 2B) , the main peak at 6 pA and the shoulder at ca. 10 pA observed in the 5:3:2 ER-like composition might denote the prevalence of a single channel, with slight contribution of simultaneous double insertions. As could be expected, [46, 47] the effect of the lipid charge in the channel function is remarkable: a decrease in the PI content (6:3:1 and 5:4:1 ratios) enhances a defined second peak in the histogram centered at 15 pA, which comprises current values that triplicate those of the main peak centered at 5 pA. In contrast, the excess of PI (3:3:4) yields a huge dispersion with no clearly defined maximum. On the other hand, altering the intrinsic curvature of the monolayer by including an excess of PE (3:6:1) leads to a single well-defined maximum at 5 pA. This is probably related to the fact that lipids with intrinsic negative curvature, like PE, restrict the formation of protein-lipid combined structures because of the energy penalty involved in the bending of the bilayer leaflet [48] . Notably, the intermediate composition (5:4:1) containing low PI and almost equimolar PC:PE ratio leads to the best definition of the 5 and 15 peaks in the histogram.",

The applied voltage that is needed to make zero the electric current (the so-called reversal potential, E rev ) reveals the preferential passage of either positive or negative ions. In the experimental protocol used here (see the Materials and methods section), a positive applied potential means that the pore is selective to cations and a negative one is associated to an anionic selectivity. We performed reversal potential experiments at pH 5.0 under a concentration ratio of 5 (C cis = 150 mM KCl, C trans = 750 mM KCl) or 10 (C cis = 150 mM KCl, C trans = 1.5 M KCl). Fig. 8 shows the permeability ratio (P + /P \u2212 ) distribution from performed reversal potential experiments. P + /P \u2212 N 1 values are tied to a cationic selectivity whereas lower than 1 values indicate a preference for anions. We see two different groups of values, one connected to a very weak anionic selectivity and other to a cationic one. Note that a cluster of identical small structures displaying a higher conductance would yield the same reversal potential as any of its constituents, not a different value with opposite sign. However, the reason for opposite selectivity in each type of pores remains unclear. This lipid dependence of CSFV p7 protein channel activity resembles that reported for the HCV p7 protein [49] although there are some differences regarding the lipid compositions explored, the sub-conductance states and the cationic selectivity found in that case.",

Under a variety of conditions we observe a good correspondence between the relative number of channel insertions and the leakage observed in LUVs. In both techniques either the pH or membrane composition are equally critical to regulate the pemeabilization of the membrane system. Remarkably, electrophysiological recordings show reproducible nanometer-sized pores that in accordance with the solved structure for HCV p7 should allow the transport of solvated ions, water and small molecules like ANTS. The pores display mild ion selectivity, compatible with the documented non-specificity of viroporins.",

This is in contrast to what is described for the HCV p7 protein, which contains the pore-forming region at the N-terminus, again emphasizing inter-genus differences among p7 products from the Flaviviridae family. In this scheme the functional role of the N-terminal hydrophobic region would remain unknown in the CSFV protein.",
