Two of these miRNA (ZIKV-miRNA-MD1 and -MD17) were found to hybridize with target transcripts from genes previously shown to be associated with microcephaly. Moreover, effective hybridizations among ZIKV-miRNA-MD1 and -MD17 and these target genes can be observed even inhighly stringent conditions (MFE > 30.0 kcal/mol). These results suggest a possible role of miRNAs on the expression of human genes associated with microcephaly and revealed candidate miRNAs that should be further confirmed by experimental analysis.

Viral miRNAs are mostly identified by traditional cloning from virus-infected cells [18], nevertheless, computational prediction and hybridization analysis are also applied to viral miRNA identification [19, 20]. To date, RNA virus-encoded miRNAs have been identified in Hepatitis C virus [21], Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [22], Bovine Leukemia virus (BLV) [23], Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus [24] Hepatitis A virus (HAV) [25] and Ebolavirus [26]. Interestingly, miRNAs have also been identified in other members of the family Flaviviridae, like West Nile virus (WNV) [27] or Dengue virus (DENV) [28]. Very recent in silico studies revealed the miRNA coding capacity of the ZIKV genome [29]. In order to get insight into the role of ZIKV genome in relation to miRNA coding, we computationally identified new potential miRNAs on the ZIKV genome along with their target genes. Our study may help to better understand hostpathogen interaction as well as to contribute to the development of new antiviral strategies against ZIKV infection.",

ItmiRNAs sequence conservation among ZIKV strains genomesAs an RNA virus, ZIKV has a high degree of genetic variability and heterogeneity.Recent studies have estimated the rate of evolution of ZIKV from 0.98 to 1.06 x 10 -3 substitutions per site per year (s/s/y)[37] and 1.20 x 10 -3 s/s/y[38]. Besides, previous phylogenetic analysis characterized two major genetic lineages of ZIKV, the African and Asian lineages[39]. Very recently, phylogenetic analyses revealed the presence of three distinct lineages, (Asian/American lineage, African lineage 1 and African lineage 2)[40]. For these reasons, it is important to establish the degree of conservation of the pre-miRNAs and mature miRNAs sequences of predicted miRNAs in the genome of Natal-RGN ZIKV strain among ZIKV strains from all genetic lineages and isolated elsewhere.In order to gain insight into this matter, all available and comparable ZIKV strains for which complete genome sequences are known were downloaded from the GenBank database and aligned using the MEGA6 program[41]. These strains were isolated elsewhere and represent all genetic lineages of ZIKV strains (for strains and accession numbers, see Supplementary MaterialTable 1). Once aligned, consensus sequences (i.e.",
