Ubiquitin is generally linked to the lysine residue of the target protein; however, a cysteine, serine, threonine, or N-terminal amino group of a protein can also be modified. This conjugation requires the successive activities of an E1-activating enzyme, an E2-conjugating enzyme, and then an E3 ligase. Ubiquitination is a fundamental PTM involved in many different cellular functions, including the trafficking of membrane proteins, endocytosis, signal transduction, DNA repair, and transcription regulation. Ubiquitin itself contains seven lysines, K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, and K63. Therefore, chains of ubiquitin can be formed by attaching additional ubiquitin molecules to a lysine residue of the previously attached ubiquitin.",

Some pathogen-encoded effectors display E3 ubiquitin ligase activities. An important fraction of these viral or bacterial E3 ligases shares structural homologies with eukaryotic E3 ligases, which are classically divided into HECT and RING E3s depending on their structures and mechanistic properties (reviewed in Kerscher et al., 2006) . HECT E3 ligases transiently bind ubiquitin before transferring it to the target protein. In contrast, RING E3 ligases do not link ubiquitin directly but rather facilitate ubiquitination by binding simultaneously to the charged E2 enzyme and the protein target.",

A few viral DUBs have been identified, but their roles in vivo, as well as their host targets, are unknown. In contrast, several DUB-like proteins have been characterized in pathogenic bacteria. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimu- Yersinia (blue) is an extracellular pathogen that injects effectors into the host cell's cytoplasm using a specialized type III secretion system (T3SS). Salmonella (red) triggers its own entry into host cells and replicates in a remodeled vacuole. It also secretes T3SS-dependent effectors. After cell invasion, Listeria (green) escapes from vacuoles and resides free in the cytoplasm, where it replicates and starts moving using the host cell's actin. Interactions with host factors are mediated by bacterial surface or secreted proteins. Effectors from all three of these bacteria (blue for Yersinia effectors, red for Salmonella effectors, and green for Listeria effectors) alter posttranslational modifications of host proteins (purple) to facilitate pathogens' replication, propagation, and evasion from host immune responses . rium (S. Typhimurium) is an invasive pathogen of the small intestine that, in mice, causes a disease similar to human typhoid fever. SseL, an effector secreted by this bacterium, displays deubiquitinating activity in vitro. It suppresses ubiquitination and degradation of IkBa, a central regulator of the NF-kB pathway (see below) ( Figure 1 ) (Le Negrate et al., 2008) . Infection with a strain of S. Typhimurium lacking sseL leads to the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins at the site of replicating intracellular bacteria (Rytk\u00f6 nen et al., 2007) . Strikingly, the decoration of intracytosolic bacteria with polyubiquitinated proteins has recently been proposed as a signal used by host cells to sense intracellular invaders ( Figure 1 ). This signal triggers cytosolic defense pathways, such as autophagy, although the nature of ubiquitinated proteins is unknown (Perrin et al., 2004; Thurston et al., 2009) . Bacterial DUBs may decrease this accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins and thus might represent a strategy developed by intracellular bacteria to escape these specific host defense systems.",

A striking example in which PTMs by the host cell strongly alter the behavior of bacterial effectors is the Salmonella SopE and SptP proteins. These two effectors contribute to the transient remodeling of the host cell's cytoskeleton during bacterial entry into the cell. SopE acts as a GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor) and activates host Rho-GTPases, resulting in actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, membrane ruffling, and subsequent bacterial uptake. In contrast, SptP acts as a GAP (GTPase-activating protein) to deactivate Rho-GTPases and allow the recovery of the actin cytoskeleton's normal architecture a few hours after infection. Although SopE and SptP are codelivered by Salmonella, they exhibit different half-lives. SopE is rapidly polyubiquitinated and degraded by the host proteasome, whereas SptP exhibits much slower degradation kinetics (Kubori and Gal\u00e1 n, 2003) . Recent studies found that Salmonella also hijacks the ubiquitination machinery to control one of its effectors, SopB, which displays two different activities depending on whether the protein is ubiquitinated or not (Patel et al., 2009; Knodler et al., 2009) . Thus, by actively co-opting the ubiquitination machinery of the host cell, Salmonella regulates the half-lives and activities of some of its key virulence factors.",

The human genome encodes three functional SUMO isoforms that can be linked to hundreds of different targets.

Indeed, infection by L. monocytogenes leads to the degradation of Ubc9, the human E2 SUMO enzyme . Listeriolysin O is a pore-forming toxin secreted by this bacterium, which plays a fundamental role in bacterial virulence (Figure 1 ). Listeriolysin O triggers the degradation of Ubc9, as well as the degradation of some SUMOylated host proteins . In contrast to the ubiquitin system, which includes dozens of E2 enzymes in humans, the SUMO system has only one E2 enzyme. Therefore, this degradation of Ubc9 leads to a blockade of the SUMOylation machinery and to a global decrease in the level of SUMO-conjugated host proteins in infected cells. Thus, by decreasing SUMOylation in infected cells, Listeria may alter the activities of host factors critical for infection .",

Nedd8, which is a member of the ubiquitin-like protein family, can be linked to cellular proteins in a fashion similar to ubiquitin (reviewed in Rabut and Peter, 2008) . The major class of currently known Nedd8 substrates is Cullins. Cullins act as scaffolding proteins in the assembly of multisubunit RING E3 ubiquitin enzymes, called Cullin RING ligases (CRLs). Neddylation of Cullins controls the activity of CRLs and thereby the ubiquitination and degradation kinetics of CRLs substrates.

In this context, reduced neddylation levels, in particular the decrease in Cullin-1 neddylation, have been associated with a downregulation of the NF-kB pathway and hypothesized to contribute to the inflammatory tolerance of the intestinal epithelium toward commensal bacteria (Kumar et al., 2009) .",

Therefore, not surprisingly, pathogens often target the MAP kinase pathway in order to facilitate their infection (Figure 3 ). One effector protein secreted intracellularly by Shigella is OspF, which possesses phosphothreonine lyase activity. OspF irreversibly dephosphorylates host MAP kinases and, therefore, was proposed to participate in the dampening of host immune responses Arbibe et al., 2007) . Interestingly, other bacterial virulence factors, such as SpvC from S. Typhimurium or HopAI1 from the plant pathogen P. syringae, possess the same phosphothreonine lyase activity as OspF and also target MAP kinases of their hosts (Mazurkiewicz et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2007) . In addition to these factors, the Yersinia YopJ/P effector can inactivate host MAP kinases by catalyzing their acetylation (Mittal et al., 2006; Mukherjee et al., 2006) .

For example, KSHV encodes two E3 ubiquitin ligases, K3 and K5, which both target the host protein's major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I). An essential player of the immune response, MHC I alerts the immune system to intracellular pathogens by sampling the protein repertoire of host cells and then presenting peptides to cytotoxic T lymphocytes. K3 rapidly mediates the polyubiquitination of MHC I molecules at the surface of the cell with K63-linked chains, leading to their endocytosis and degradation. Interestingly, K5 also mediates polyubiquitination of MHC I but with mixed K63 and K11 chains, instead of homotypic chains. Indeed, these mixed chains are required for the internalization of MHC I by K5, thus highlighting, for the first time, the putative importance of such mixed polyubi-quitin chains in the control of immune responses (Boname et al., 2010) . Some herpesvirus E3 ubiquitin ligases downregulate MHC I molecules by triggering their degradation by the ERAD (endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation) pathway (reviewed in Randow and Lehner, 2009) . Some viral proteins, such as HIV Vpu accessory protein, can act as adaptors of host E3 ubiquitin ligases to induce the proteasomal degradation of other types of host immunoreceptors, such as CD4 (cluster of differentiation 4) receptor on T cells (Schubert et al., 1998) . Finally, bacterial pathogens, such as Salmonella, can decrease the expression of MHC class II molecules at the cell surface by modulating their ubiquitination, which also leads to the dampening of host immune responses (Lapaque et al., 2009 ).",
