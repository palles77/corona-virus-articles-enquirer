            "text": "Generally, the synthesis of heteroarylphosphonates via the MeA reaction requires reflux of the halogen containing heterocycle with the corresponding trialkyl phosphite. Nevertheless, other methods of the phosphonic acid group introduction to the pyrimidine and purine bases exist. Phosphonate derivatives of uracil and adenine were prepared in poor yields (about 30%) by lithiation of the corresponding nucleobase derivative, followed by the reaction with diethyl chlorophosphate. 8 The synthesis of (4,6-diamino-1,3,5triazin-2-yl)phosphonates through various cyclization reactions has also been reported. 9 The MichaeliseArbuzov reaction 10 clearly is a method of choice for the preparation of heterocycles with directly attached phosphonate groups and this approach has recently been improved by the use of microwave irradiation. 11 Microwave-assisted (MW-assisted) organic synthesis has been shown to provide a number of advantages over the standard heating techniques, such as clean reactions, improved reaction yields and shortened reaction times, easy work-ups and/or solventfree reaction conditions. 12 Recently, a preparation of phosphonates derived from 2(1H)pyrazinone by MichaeliseArbuzov reaction of halopyrazinones with triethyl phosphite has been reported. 13 It was shown that compared to the conventional heating procedure, microwave irradiation reduces the reaction time dramatically (20 min compared to 12 h) while the MW-induction of side reactions lowered the reaction yields only slightly to moderately. 13 The efficient synthesis of purine nucleosides and non-sugar nucleoside analogues containing a phosphonate group at the C-6 position of the purine moiety via MW-assisted MichaeliseArbuzov reaction, starting from 6-chloropurine derivatives, has also been reported. 14 Recently, a novel class of acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (ANPs), the so called 'open-ring' analogues, with interesting antiviral (anti-HIV, anti-MSV and anti-HBV) properties has been discovered in which the pyrimidine base preferably contains an amino group(s) and the aliphatic phosphonate side chain linked to the C-6 position (e.g., PMEO derivative 1, Fig. 1 ). 15 We were interested to reveal whether analogues with an eliminated acyclic chain in which the phosphonate moiety is directly attached to the nitrogen containing heterocycles (e.g., compounds 2 and 3, Fig. 1 ) would retain any antiviral activity.",
