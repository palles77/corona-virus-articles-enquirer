Using detailed survey information on social encounters coupled to predictive models, we investigate the likely efficacy of the current UK definition of a close contact (within 2 meters for 15 minutes or more) and the distribution of secondary cases that may go untraced. Taking recent estimates for COVID-19 transmission, we show that less than 1 in 5 cases will generate any subsequent untraced cases, although this comes at a high logistical burden with an average of 36.1 individuals (95 th percentiles 0-182) traced per case. Changes to the definition of a close contact can reduce this burden, but with increased risk of untraced cases; we estimate that any definition where close contact requires more than 4 hours of contact is likely to lead to uncontrolled spread.",

In more recent years, contact tracing was also a valuable tool following importation of Ebola virus disease into the UK in 2014 (Crook et al 2017) and the cases of monkeypox in the UK in 2018 (Vaughan et al 2018). In general, contact tracing is a highly effective and robust strategy given sufficient resources. The main advantages are that it can identify potentially infected individuals before severe symptoms emerge, and if conducted sufficiently quickly can prevent onward transmission from the secondary cases. Contact tracing has proved hugely successful in the treatment of sexually transmitted infections, where the definition of a contact is relatively straightforward, where infection is often asymptomatic and where the time-scales of transmission are slow (Hogben et al 2016 , R\u00f6nn et al 2017 . In contrast, the use of contact tracing for novel invading pathogens has received less quantitative consideration, in part due to greater uncertainties over social contact structure (although see Ahmed et al 2018 , Hoang et al 2019 .",

In total, 5,802 respondents reported more than 50,000 encounters -one of the biggest studies of its kind to date. The encounter patterns of this study were in good qualitative agreement with other similar studies of social interactions (Mossong et al 2008 , Isella et al 2010 . In this study, the daily encounter data was first extrapolated to generate a pattern of contacts over a 14 day period (replicating random encounters and increasing the total duration associated regular contacts), to act as the basis for transmission and contact tracing simulations. Using this extrapolated data, we can classify interactions into those which satisfy the definition of a close contact for the purpose of contact tracing. From our social encounter data we can also distinguish interactions with people who could be later identified and traced, from those with unidentifiable strangers (schematic figure 1). We assume that all contact of longer than 1 hour or repeated contacts can be identified and traced, whereas shorter meetings with people for the first time are strangers who are unidentifiable. The second element of the simulation is to determine who gets infected from a source case chosen representatively from the survey respondents. This transmission process is stochastic, accounting for both the time spent with each contact and the infectivity on each day (see Appendix). Taken together these two predictions allow us to bound the efficacy of contact tracing.",

Using preliminary estimates of COVID-19 transmission (average latent period 4 days, average effective infectious period 1.61 days, R 0 =3.11 and assuming a simple SEIR formulation (Read et al 2020)) we compute the distribution of epidemiological, social and contact tracing characteristics across the population. Extrapolating the data from the social contact survey suggests that the average number of contacts over a 14 day period is 217, although the distribution is significantly over dispersed (with a median of 90 and around 3% of individuals having >1,000 total contacts). Of these total encounters, an average of 59 contacts (27%) meet the definition of a close-contact (in contact for >15 minutes, PHE 2020) and of these close-contacts we predict an average of 36 (61%) to be individuals known to the infected case that can be traced. Therefore, simply considering social contacts, it is clear that there are very many short duration contacts which do not meet the definition of a close contact, and although unlikely to become infected may pose a risk due to their greater abundance.",

As expected, given the model assumptions, the expected number of total secondary cases agrees with the assumed R 0 (mean=3.11, median=2, and 95th percentiles 0-10). Given that these cases are most likely to be those contacts of the longest duration, we predict that 95% of cases match the definition of a close contact. However, not all of these contacts will be identifiable; assuming that all repeated contacts and contact of longer than 1 hour can be traced, we predict that 93% of all cases meet the definition and can be identified. However, because of the extreme heterogeneity in contacts between individuals and the stochastic nature of transmission, we would still expect 15% of all primary cases to generate at least one secondary case that cannot be identified. Aggregating across all individuals and under the optimistic assumption that all the contact tracing can be performed rapidly, we expect contact tracing to reduce the basic reproductive ratio from 3.11 to 0.21 -enabling the outbreak to be contained (figure 2).",

Each new case requires an average of 36 individuals to be traced, with 8.7% of cases having more than 100 close traceable contacts (figure 2). We therefore consider the implications of changing the definition of a close contact. Clearly a more strict definition of a close contact (requiring more contact time) reduces the burden on the health services as fewer contacts need to be traced, but also increases the risk of cases being missed. Figure 3 provides a quantitative assessment of changes to the close contact definition. Definitions requiring more than four hours of contact, are unlikely to control an outbreak as the expected number of untraced secondly cases is greater than one. This therefore places a strict bound on level of contact tracing required. The added benefit from definitions shorter than 1 hour has relatively little impact on the mean number of untraced cases (figure 3b), but does reduce the probability that some untraced contacts occur.",

However, the first invasion into any new population or social setting generally has a larger expected number of secondary cases. The first invader enters a completely susceptible population; moreover all their close contacts (eg family members) are susceptible. In contrast, due to clustering of contacts, most secondary cases will be in a landscape with a depleted number of susceptibles -as close contacts such as family members will already have been exposed to the primary case. This susceptible depletion in the local social network may help to explain the change in R t over time reported for COVID-19 (Yang et al 2020). We therefore consider the impact of different values of the initial reproductive ratio (figure 4), which could capture this social aspect, or could represent heterogeneity between individuals in the amount of virus shed, or could inform about innate differences in behaviour between China and the UK. Given the strong biasing of transmission towards long-duration contacts, the impact of varying initial reproductive ratio is less extreme than might be expected; it is only for the highest values of initial reproductive ratio simulated (>9.8) that contact tracing fails to find more than one case such that infection can escape.",

In contrast, while short term predictions are subject to greater stochasticity, the distribution of possible behaviours can be readily captured. Here we have investigated contact tracing of a close-contact pathogen, using 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as the example, and considered the efficacy of contact tracing as a control measure. This work brings together a detailed survey of social encounters together with bespoke mathematical modelling of the transmission and tracing processes. Given the huge heterogeneties present in social encounters (both in terms of duration and number) mathematical models are vital to interpret the interplay between a low number of high risk encounters (e.g., household members) and the high number of low-risk less-identifiable encounters (e.g., commuters or retail customers).",

The public health implications of this tracing are more complex, and depend on the relative timing of events and the treatment of identified contacts. For contact tracing to be an effective public health measure requires secondary cases to be discovered before they become infectious; hence the time from the primary case becoming infectious to the tracing of their contacts needs to be shorter than the incubation period. Longer time scales would allow tertiary cases to be infected and would snowball the tracing process. In addition, those contacts that are traced either need to be effectively screened for infection and quarantined or otherwise isolated so that they do not pose a risk to others. Therefore, while contact tracing has the potential to control COVID-19 (and other close-contact pathogens) the ultimate success relies on the speed and efficacy with which suspect contacts can be contained.",
