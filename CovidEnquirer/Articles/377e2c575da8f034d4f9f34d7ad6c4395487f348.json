The assembly pathway of vaccinia virus displays several unique features, such as the production of two structurally distinct, infectious forms. One of these, termed intracellular naked virus (INV), remains cell associated while the other, termed extracellular enveloped virus (EEV), is released from the cell. In addition, it has long been believed that INVs acquire their lipid envelopes by a unique example of de novo membrane biogenesis. To examine the structure and assembly of vaccinia virus we have used immunoelectron microscopy using antibodies to proteins of different subcellular compartments as well as a phospholipid analysis of purified INV and EEV.

            "text": "data are not consistent with the de novo model of viral membrane synthesis but rather argue that the vaccinia virus DNA becomes enwrapped by a membrane cisterna derived from the intermediate compartment between the ER and the Golgi stacks, thus acquiring two membranes in one step. Phospholipid analysis of purified INV supports its derivation from an early biosynthetic compartment. This unique assembly process is repeated once more when the INV becomes enwrapped by an additional membrane cisterna, in agreement with earlier reports. The available data suggest that after fusion between the outer envelope and the plasma membrane, mature EEV is released from the cell. V ACCINIA virus is the best studied member of the family Poxviridae, the largest and most complex of the animal viruses (for reviews see Dales and Pogo, 1981; Fenner et al., 1989; Moss, 1991) . Its double-stranded linear DNA genome of 191 kbp has been sequenced and 263 potential genes have been identified (Goebel et al., 1990) . Unlike other DNA viruses, vaccinia virus replicates and assembles in the cytoplasm of the host cell. Both replication and assembly occur in discrete cytoplasmic foci termed viral factories which are thought to be devoid of cellular organelles and membranes (Joklik and Becker, 1964) . Assembly is first manifested by the appearance of crescent-shaped membranes within the viral factories. These membranes eventually form spherical, immature virions which undergo additional maturational events, including the cleavage of viral core proteins (Moss and Rosenblum, 1973) , to give rise to the first infectious, brick-shaped form of vaccinia virus (Dales and Pogo, 1981) . This viral form is by far the best characterized and has long been referred to as intracellular \"naked\" virus (INV) 1 despite the fact that it is bound by at least one lipid envelope. Phospholipid comprises \"~5 % of the INV by weight (Zwartouw, 1964) and disruption of the envelope by nonionic detergent increases its apparent density in cesium chloride gradients (Doms et al., 1990) . A variable amount of the INV is thought to be transported to the Golgi region of the cell (Ichihashi et al., 1971; Morgan, 1976; Hiller and Weber, 1985) where it is enwrapped by a membrane cisterna. The available data argue that this enwrapped form of the virus loses the outermost of its two newly acquired bilayers by fusing with the plasma membrane, after which it is released into the medium (Dales and Pogo, 1981; Fenner et al., 1989) . This second infectious form of the vi-rus, termed extracellular enveloped virus (EEV), contains additional polypeptides when compared with the INV (Payne, 1978) and is important for the dissemination of vaccinia both in cell culture and in the host animal (Payne, 1980; Payne and Kristensson, 1985; Moss, 1991, 1992) .",

If true, this would markedly differ from both cellular membranes, which are thought to be synthesized on a template organelle, predominantly the ER (Palade, 1983; Dawidowicz, 1987; Bishop and Bell, 1988) , as well as from other enveloped viruses which acquire their membranes from cellular organelles (Stephens and Compans, 1988; Petterson, 1991; Griffiths and Rottier, 1992) . Evidence for the de novo biogenesis model is derived largely from conventional electron microscopic studies which show the ends of the forming crescent-shaped viral membranes to be without obvious continuity to any cellular organelles (Dales and Mossbach, 1968; Nagayama et al., 1970) . Although a precise model has not been put forward for the de novo mechanism, a basic assumption has been that the viral membrane proteins and cellular lipids are assembled into a lipid bilayer by vaccinia encoded enzymes (Stem and Dales, 1974; Stern and Dales, 1976) .",

To examine vaccinia virus assembly, and in particular the derivation of the viral membranes of the INV, we have made an immunocytochemical analysis of vacciniainfected tissue culture cells. We have used thawed cryosections to examine the ultrastructure of the vaccinia particles and to perform immunolocalization at the ultrastructural level (Tokuyasu, 1973 (Tokuyasu, , 1980 . Thawed cryosections of fixed cells, as well as of gradient purified virions, showed that the INV form of vaccinia virus contains two, and the EEV form three membranes. We have used antibodies to several marker proteins of subceUular compartments and compared their localization with that of the assembling viral particles. Our data suggest that vaccinia virus uses a unique assembly pathway. Unlike other enveloped viruses which acquire a single membrane by budding into a cellular organelle, vaccinia virus becomes enwrapped by a membrane cistema thereby acquiring two membranes simultaneously and remaining free in the cytoplasm. This membrane cisterna does not originate de novo but rather is derived from the intermediate compartment between the ER and the Golgi stacks.",

For quantitation, electron micrographs were taken in a systematic fashion at a primary magnification of 10,000 and the density of gold labeling with p58 over virions, nucleus and cytoplasmic areas around the virions was quantified by point counting (Grifliths and Hoppeler, 1986) .",

Since well-characterized marker proteins for these structures have not been described, we identified them using markers for DNA (Esteban, 1977) . With bis-benzimide, a fluorescent DNA stain, we detected 2-5 viral factories per cell at 4 h PI which coalesced into one or two large, juxtanuclear factories at 8 h PI. For EM, cryosections of infected HeLa cells were labelled with the anti-DNA antibody (Hausmann et al., 1986) . Both the nuclei and cytoplasmic areas which contained crescent shaped membranes as well as discrete immature virions ( Fig. 1) were decorated with protein A-gold. The DNA within the virions could also be labeled ( Fig. 1, arrows) . However, the cytoplasmic areas labeled by the anti-DNA antibody were much larger than the areas where viral crescents were formed. Additionally, the crescents as well as most of the IV themselves were not labeled for DNA. We conclude that only parts of the cytoplasmic fluorescence seen after staining with the DNA stain corresponded to the cytoplasmic assembly sites of vaccinia virus observed by EM.",

Close inspection reveals membranous structures in close proximity ( Fig. 2 a) , or even continuity ( Fig. 2 e) , with the crescents. The membranes within the viral factories were better visualized in cryosections which also revealed that within the crescent, a second membrane could often be detected (Fig. 2 , b and g). In epon sections of infected cells the two membranes were difficult to resolve (see Topology of Virus Assembly, below). Occasionally however, at the ends of the crescents two membranes could be resolved ( Fig. 2 d) as well as membrane loops connecting the two bilayers ( Fig. 2 c) . The crescents further assemble into spherical, immature virions which also have electron-dense spicules in their membranes (Nagayama et al., 1970; Morgan, 1976) . Many images from very thin Epon-or cryosections suggested that there are two membranes within the immature virions ( Fig. 2 f) . Further, a small subpopulation of immature virions showed a distinct inner membrane that was separated from the outer one ( Between the two membranes of the INV a regular spike-like array was usually evident but whether these are identical to the spicules of the immature virions is unclear. After their formation, some of the INV particles become enwrapped by a cellular membrane cisterna (Ichihashi et al., 1971; Morgan, 1976; Hiller and Weber, 1985) , thus acquiring their third and fourth membranes simultaneously. We will refer to the resulting four-membraned viral form as the intracellular enveloped virus (IEV). In cryosections, we could easily identify viral particles which had four distinct membranes (Fig. 3 , c-e), whereas in Epon sections the innermost membranes could not be clearly visualized (Fig. 3 , a and b). The outer envelope of the IEV is thought to fuse with the plasma membrane, thereby releasing the EEV into the medium (Morgan, 1976; Payne and Kristensson, 1979) .",

Infected BHK or HeLa cells were incubated in the presence of rifampicin and then placed in drug-free media for various times before fixation at 8 h PI. When there was no chase-period, rifampicin bodies were easily detected by light microscopy using phase-contrast (Fig. 4, a and b) .

First, the de novo model does not account for the continuity of assembling virions with cellular membranes and second, it does not explain the acquisition of the two membranes of the INV. We could think of two alternative hypotheses which would be consistent with our data. The first would be that the virus buds into a cellular compartment, thereby acquiring its first membrane and forming the immature virus. Sub- Figure 5 .

The permeabilization led to a significant extraction of cytoplasmic proteins such as lactate dehydrogenase, which increased the membrane contrast and allowed a better visualization of membrane tubules. Under these conditions the continuities between the viral crescents and cytoplasmic membranes became obvious. Specifically, the viral crescents appeared to be continuous either with double membrane cisternae or with distinct tubular elements (Fig. 5) . These tubules, which have a uniform diameter of ~ 30 nm, are thinner than the average thickness of our thin sections and are difficult to visualize in nonextracted cells.

In some cases, however (Fig. 5 c) , images were obtained which show clearly that these structures also consist of two distinct bilayers. Such images lead us to propose that these cisternal structures would be organized with the same topology as ER or Golgi membranes with the space between the two bilayers representing an ecto-cytoplasmic compartment. In the next series of experiments we addressed this issue using an electrondense marker for the cytoplasm. Infected HeLa cells were gently broken to selectively perforate the plasma membrane, and incubated at 4\"C with BSA gold. Under these conditions, \"~50-70% of the cells were broken as judged by trypan blue staining and EM analysis showed that most of these cells retained their major cytoplasmic organelles and the viral factories. BSA gold had free access to the cytoplasm, to both sides of the crescent shaped membranes and to most of the immature virions (Fig. 6 a) . A small percentage of the immature virions had no BSA gold in their centres (Fig. 6 a, asterisk) , arguing that these particles had already completely sealed. Gold particles were excluded from the lumen of all identifiable cellular organelles, the nuclear envelope, rough ER (Fig. 6 a) , the Golgi complex and mitochondria (not shown). BSA gold also had access to the space between the INV and the wrapping membranes, but not to the lumen of this cisterna (Fig. 6 b) . Since these experiments argue that the assembling virions are not within a cellular organelle but free in the cytoplasm they should be accessible to proteolytic digestion in broken cells. When the broken ceils were treated with proteinase K on ice for 5 min, in a subset of these cells the assembling virions showed dramatic changes in their morphology, namely two membranes became clearly visible (Fig. 6, c-e) . In addition, the contents of these virions had been completely removed. In agreement with the BSA-gold data, in a small percentage of the spherical immature virus profiles the appearance of the viroplasm was not affected by the protease treatment (Fig.  6 e ) .",

            "text": "We used antibodies to these proteins to localize the intermediate compartment in vaccinia infected BHK, HeLa or J774 macrophage cells. Immunofluorescence experiments using an antibody to p53 showed that there was weak labeling in some regions of the viral factories as defined by DNA staining, as well as more extensive labeling in the areas adjoining the viral factories (Fig. 10, a and b) . Four different affinity-purified rabbit antibodies against rab2 were tested: two polyclonal sera raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to the COOH terminus of rab2 and two polyclonal sera made against a bacterially expressed fusion protein (Chavrier et al., 1990) . By immunofluorescence, one of the anti-eOOH terminus and one of the anti-fusion protein sera gave a viral factory (Fig. 10, c and d) or rifampicin body labeling (Fig. 10,fand h) , the two other sera gave a labeling similar to the p53 labeling. They all gave identical labeling patterns by immunoelectron microscopy. The labeling obtained with the two anti-COOH terminus sera couM be blocked by pre-incubating the sera with the specific synthetic peptide (amino acid 158-176 of rab2) whereas an unspecific peptide (amino acid 182-197 of rab5) had no effect. Double immunofluorescence experiments (not shown) confirmed that in vaccinia infected cells, two of the four antibodies against rab2 do not colocalize with p53 as they do in noninfected cells (Chavrier et al., 1990) . In rifampicin-treated infected cells, two of the four a-rab2 antibodies, and to a lesser extent, p53 (Fig. 10, e-h) , localized to the rifampicin bodies which contained the vaccinia precursor membranes. The significance of the difference in the labeling patterns seen with the two classes of rab2 antibodies is presently unclear. To determine whether the membranes of the viral factories were related to the intermediate compartment, we performed immunogold labeling. Antisera against rab2 (Fig.  11 a) , p53 (Fig. 11 b) and p58 (Fig. 11, c and d) labeled the membranes in some regions of the viral factories as well as membranes in continuity with assembling virions (Fig. 11,  a, c and d) . With all these antibodies tubulo-vesicular elements often extending a considerable distance from the Golgi stacks as well as one or two cisternae on one side of the Golgi stack were labeled (Fig. 11, a and b) . HeLa (a, b, and e-h) or BHK (c and d) ceils were extracted with saponin before fixation and labeled with anti-p53 (a and e) or anti-rab2 (c and f). b, d, and g show the corresponding DNA staining, and h the phase-contrast image corresponding to e, f, and g. In infected cells, labeling for p53 results in a perinuclear pattern (a) which is located on the same side of the nucleus as the viral factory, as defined by cytoplasmic DNA staining (b). In contrast, rab2 (c) colocalizes to a large extent with the viral factories (d). Double labeling of rifampicin-treated infected cells (e-h) shows that the bulk of the p53 labeling (e) is not changed by rifampicin whereas the bulk of rab2 (f) is concentrated on the rifampicin bodies, as identified by phase contrast (h). The arrows (e, f, and h) point to rifampicin bodies which overlap with the labeling for p53 and rab2. The rifampicin bodies occur predominantly in the region of the viral factories as defined by DNA staining (g). N, nucleus. Bars, 10 ttm.",

Since the membranes of the intermediate compartment in the vicinity of the assembling virions were often very difficult to visualize, we decided to quantify areas of cytoplasm within the viral factories. For comparison, we determined the amount of labeling over the virions themselves as well as over the nuclei. The membranes within the viral factories showed on average 3.05 (+0.41) gold particles/#m 2, whereas the virions or the nuclei had only 0.95 (+0.5) gold//xm 2 or 0.67 (+0.1) gold//~m 2, respectively. The virions and the nuclei are not expected to contain p58 and we therefore considered this labeling to be background. These data show that the labeling for p58 in the region of the viral factories was over three times higher than background values. Since the membranes of the intermediate compartment comprise only a fraction of the area of the viral factory on the micrograph that we used for quantitation, we expect that these data underestimate the amount of specific labeling associated with the membranes of this compartment.",

We chose a recombinant vaccinia virus (VV-El) which expresses the E1 integral membrane protein of the avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV El; Machamer and Rose, 1987) under the control of the vaccinia 7.5 k promoter. It has been shown previously using VV-E1 that the bulk of the protein remains Endo H sensitive (Machamer and Rose, 1987) indicating that it does not reach the medial Golgi apparatus. Under these conditions IBV E1 accumulates in membrane structures closely associated with the cis-side of the Golgi stacks (Machamer et al., 1990) . These results, together with the observation that another coronavirus, the mouse hepatitis virus, buds into a post-ER, pre-Golgi compartment (Tooze et al., 1984;  Krijnse-Locker, J., M. Ericsson, P.

Thawed cryosections of VV-WR infected BHK (a, 8 h after infection), J774 macrophages (b, 18 h after infection) or HeLa cells (c-f, 9 h after infection) were labeled with anti-PDI followed by protein A-9 nm gold. Cells in d-f were treated with rifampicin during the infection. Anti-PDI labeling reveals several ER-cisternae (ER) which occasionally extended to the viral factories (a). Occasionally, labeling for PDI is seen on a membrane cisterna in very close proximity to the viral crescents (CR), especially in J774 macrophages (b). In general, the membrane cisternae continuous with or in close proximity to the assembling virions are not labeled (a and c). PDI labeling is also found in close proximity to the Golgi stack, often extending in to one cisterna on one side of the stack (d). In rifampicin-treated cells, PDI labeling is high in ER-cisternae (arrows in e and f) and is present in small amounts on the membranes surrounding the rifampicin bodies. (R, arrowheads in e and f). CR, crescent;/E, immature virus; R, rifampicin body; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; (7, Golgi complex. Bars, 200 nm. tion), would argue that the bulk of IBV E1 should reside in a pre-Golgi compartment, presumably the intermediate compartment. There are two advantages in using VV-E1. Unlike tab2, IBV E1 glycoprotein is an integral membrane protein and, compared with p53 and p58, it is expressed at very high levels in VV-EI infected cells.",

When compared with p53 ( Fig. 12 b) , IBV E1 (Fig. 12 a) showed less labeling in the peripheral parts of the cells. This restriction of the IBV E1 labelling was especially evident in those cells in which cycloheximide was present during the last 2 h of infection to chase as much of the IBV E1 as possible out of the ER (not shown). In the presence of rifampicin, the bulk of IBV E1 also accumulated in a perinnclear location. Additionally, there was a lower labeling on the rifampicin bodies which contain the vaccinia precursor membranes (Fig. 12, c-e) . This experiment suggests that the vaccinia membranes are derived from membranes containing an abundantly expressed protein which is retained in an early biosynthetic compartment.",

Strong labeling for VV-E1 was obtained on the smooth membranes within the viral factories which were in close proximity to some of the assembling virions (Fig. 13 b) . However, many vaccinia crescent membranes were continuous with membranes that were not labeled for this marker. We next compared the localization of IBV E1 to p58 in vaccmia-infected cells. To accumulate viral crescent and immature virions, we used mouse macrophages infected with W-E1 in the presence of rifampicin and then chased for 30 min. In single-labeling experiments, anti-IBV E1 labeled many of the smooth membranes connected to the viral buds which had formed from the rifampicin bodies (Fig. 14 a) . Double-labeling experiments showed colocalization of IBV E1 with p58 on some but not all of the smooth membranes around the rifampicin bodies (Fig. 14, b and c) .

Since sphingomyelin is thought to be synthesized in the cis-medial-Golgi apparatus (Futerman et al., 1990; Jeckel et al., 1990) , its low concentration in the INN would be consistent with assembly on a compartment positioned before the Golgi stacks but after the ER (Fleischer et al., 1974; van Meer, 1989) .",

Such a composition is more similar to late compartments of the secretory route ( van Meer, 1989) . As noted previously (Stern and Dales, 1974; Hiller et al., 1981) , the INV form of vaccinia virus was enriched in a phospholipid that ran close to the solvent front of the thin layer plate. This lipid has been tentatively identified as acylbis(monoacylglyceryl)phosphate (Hiller et al., 1981) , a lipid related to the lysosomal lipid bis(monoacylglyceryl)phosphate (Wherrett and Huterer, 1972) . However, as in the previous work (Hiller et al., 1981) , an enrichment of this lipid was always accompanied by a decrease in the concentration of phosphatidylethanolamine. We are presently testing the possibility that the unknown lipid is the product of modification of phosphatidylethanolamine to N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine, a lipid that has been observed and has a structure very similar to that of acyl-bis(monoacylglyceryl)phosphate (Somerharju and Renkonen, 1979) .

Thawed cryosections of VV-WR infected HeLa cells at 8 h after infection were labeled with anti-rab2 (a) or with anti-p53 (b) followed by protein A-gold. The arrows (a) point to the two membranes within the assembling virions and to smooth membranes continuous with the virions. Anti-rab2 (arrowheads in a) labels membranes that are in part continuous with assembling virions (asterisk) as well as other membranes within the viral factories. Anti-p53 (arrowheads in b) labels membranes in close proximity to assembling virions (asterisk). Note the association of the gold particles for both anti-p53 and anti-rab2 with one cisterna of the Golgi complex (G; a and b). c and d show thawed cryosections of J774 mouse macrophages infected with the recombinant VV-E1 incubated in the presence of rifampicin for 14.5 h and followed by 30 rain without rifampicin to accumulate immature viral particles.

The arrows (c and d) point to the two membranes within the assembling virions and to smooth membranes continuous with the virions.

These results suggest that vaccinia membranes are not synthesized de novo but derived from the intermediate compartment of the host cell. This idea is supported by the phospholipid composition of the newly formed virions that is intermediate between the known membrane composition of the ER and that of later secretory compartments ( van Meer, 1989 ).",

Collectively, these data suggest that the membranes of the immature virions are derived from the intermediate compartment. It is clear from this, and other studies, that the membranes of the intermediate compartment have an extensive structure of complex tubulo-vesicular organization. Much of their surface area consists of smooth tubules which, we assume, correspond to the tubular profiles evident in many of the published immunofluorescent images (e.g., Saraste et al., 1987; Schweizer et al., 1988; Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1989 , 1990 . The organization of this region is especially obvious in thick sections of cells impregnated with osmium tetroxide (Lindsey and EUisman, 1985a,b; Rambourg and Clermont, 1990) . All the markers for the intermediate compartment we have tested localize to one or two cisternae on one side of the Golgi stack, as well as to membrane profiles extending considerable distances from the Golgi region, both in infected (this paper) and uninfected cells (G. Grifiiths, unpublished data). However, the distribution of some of these markers was altered in vaccinia infected ceils. For example, by immunofluorescence microscopy rab2 and p53 were enriched in different regions of the intermediate compartment in vaccinia infected cells. Whether this finding reflects different functional domains of this organelle is an intriguing possibility which can only be determined when more information is available on the organization and functions of this compartment.",

Only those immature virions that assemble in close proximity to the Golgi stacks were in continuity with IBV E1 enriched membranes. IBV E1 has previously been considered to behave as a Golgi resident protein (Machamer et al., 1990) . However, our data showing that much of this protein colocalizes with p53 argues that, at least when expressed in vaccinia infected cells, the IBV E1 is either exclusively in the intermediate compartment or both in the intermediate compartment and in the cis-Golgi. The boundary between these two compartments can only be defined when double-labeling studies are carried out to directly compare the localization of intermediate compartment markers with a bona fide resident protein of the cis-Golgi such as the Golgi mannosidase I.",

This budding would result in the acquisition of a single bilayer and would leave the virus within the lumen of the intermediate compartment. We were able to test this hypothesis by introducing an electron-dense marker, BSA gold, into the cytoplasm. The BSA-gold particles were excluded from cellular compartments but clearly had access to both sides of the viral crescents as well as to immature and mature virions. We propose therefore that vaccinia virus becomes enwrapped by a membrane cisterna (Fig. 15 ). This proposal is consistent with the existence of the two membranes that are seen both in immature virions as well as in the INVs. In addition, this model explains how the immature virions, as well as the INVs, can acquire two membranes while still remaining in the cytoplasm. We think that during the early steps in the assembly process the membranes of this cisterna are so tightly apposed that it is often difficult to distinguish the two bilayers. That two membranes do exist was shown by the protease treatment of perforated, infected cells.",

It seems likely that viral core proteins bind to so far unidentified viral transmembrane protein(s) that are targeted to the intermediate compartment, resulting in the formation of the crescents When the envelopment has been completed, an immature virus (/V) containing two tightly apposed membranes is formed. The morphologically distinct spicules of the crescents as well as the IV are indicated as lines in the outer membrane. These spicules become less visible as the virus matures. During the maturation of the virus particle, an intermediate form is seen in which two membranes become clearly visible; the inner one acquires the brick shape of the INV, while the outer membrane profile remains spherical. The next viral particle that is formed is the INV/IMV (intracellular naked virus or intracellular mature virus; see Discussion) where both membrane profiles are brick shaped. The INV becomes enwrapped by another cellular cisterna thereby forming the fourmembraned intracellular enveloped virus (IEV). The IEV is believed to fuse with the plasma membrane, releasing the threemembraned extracellular enveloped virus (EEV) into the medium.",
