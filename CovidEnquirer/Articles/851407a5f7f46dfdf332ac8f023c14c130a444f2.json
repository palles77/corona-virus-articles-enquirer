Techniques for ultrasonography of small exotic mammals and various reptile species have also been described. Ultrasound machines should be equipped with a transducer suitable for the size of the animal, with a small footprint or contact area. Transducers with frequencies from 7.5 to 12 MHz will be the most useful. Many standard ultrasound machines can be fitted with probes of this frequency. Color Doppler is advantageous for assessing blood flow, but it is harder to interpret. Most new ultrasound machines are capable of digital recording to facilitate further review after contact with the patient is completed.

            "text": "Another useful diagnostic modality that has recently received increased attention is diagnostic endoscopy of exotic animals. Rigid endoscopy for determination of sex is well recognized in birds maintained in pet and zoo collections. Recently, more attention has been given to diagnostic endoscopy and the collection of endoscopic-guided samples. 1, 2 Diagnostic endoscopy uses rigid endoscopes, most commonly 2.7 and 1.9 mm in diameter. Endoscopes use a high-intensity light source for illumination. The endoscope and light source are the minimum equipment required for visualization of the oral cavity, ear canal, and nasal cavity of small exotic mammals (Fig 2) . However, more advanced techniques such as endoscopic evaluation of the urethra, bladder, and vagina, and abdominal or thoracic endoscopy require a diagnostic sheath to allow insufflation of sterile fluid or air to enhance visualization. The diagnostic sheath also allows introduction of a variety of instruments for sample collection for cytology, culture and sensitivity, and/or biopsy. 3 All endoscopic procedures benefit from the addition of a camera to allow viewing of images on a monitor, and an image capture system to save images for education, documentation, or teaching purposes. In reptiles, diagnostic endoscopy is most often used to examine the oral cavity, coelomic cavity, vent, urinary tract, and even portions of the reproductive tract of female animals. 4, 5 Collection of diagnostic samples is only half the challenge of obtaining meaningful data. Samples must be submitted to laboratories that are familiar with the process and have some degree of expertise in the evaluation of exotic animal specimens. Many veterinary diagnostic laboratories are willing to accept these samples, and a number of facilities actively develop unique tests specifically for exotic animals (for example, tests for viral or bacterial pathogens). A few facilities are even dedicated solely to exotic animal testing. 6 See Table 1 for a list of some laboratories offering specialized tests specifically for exotic animals.",

Several manufacturers make smaller, inhalant anesthetic cones and endotracheal tubes with narrow interior diameters (for example, 1.5 mm). In exotic mammal medicine, intubation of rabbits, ferrets, and larger exotic pets is common. Laryngoscopes with straight Miller blades sizes 0 or 1 facilitate intubation and visualization, particularly in small carnivores. Intubation of smaller mammals is technically much more challenging than that for the larger exotic species previously mentioned. Endoscopically guided intubation may be useful in these difficult cases. Johnson recently described this technique in rabbits, ferrets, prairie dogs, chinchillas, and guinea pigs using a semirigid 1.9-mm endoscope (Focuscope; MDS Inc., Brandon FL USA). 7 This may be exceedingly more difficult to impossible to perform in chinchillas and guinea pigs using a true rigid endoscope that is incapable of making the slight bend required to direct the endoscope and tube into the trachea. Other equipment that may aid intubation includes a variety of mouth gags, one designed specifically for ferrets (Nazzy Ferret Mouth Gag; USI/BSI, Universal Surgical Instruments, Glen Cove, NY USA).",

Clear, transparent drapes allow one to view smaller patients to monitor respiratory rate, depth, and other important parameters. Monitoring devices used regularly in exotic pet medicine include vascular Doppler, a flexible, constant readout temperature probe, electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry, and indirect measurement of blood pressure in larger patients (Figs 4 and 5) . Recently, techniques have been developed for measurement of blood pressure with a cardiac Doppler and small blood pressure cuffs in patients weighing less than 1 kg. 9 Standard aseptic technique is critical in exotic mammal and reptile surgery, despite the fact that surgical site preparation is often more difficult. Less-than-optimal preparation carries the same risk of infection and wound dehiscence found in traditional pet surgery. Clipping of fur from delicate skin must be done carefully to avoid iatrogenic skin lacerations. Small clippers with fine blades are appropriate for these cases. Skin is prepared with warmed dilute (0.05%) chlorhexidine solution followed by warm saline solution rinse, because cold scrub solutions and alcohol can produce hypothermia in small patients. 10 A number of materials can be used as sterile drapes in these patients. However, most exotic animal surgeons and anesthetists prefer transparent drapes for reasons described above. Some transparent drapes are self-adhering or can be secured to the patient with smaller, less traumatic towel clamps.",

An example of a typical small exotic mammal/reptile surgical pack is described in Table 2 . Radiosurgery has been described for use in exotic mammals and reptiles, and is an effective method for initial incision and for intraoperative hemostasis (Surgitron; Ellman International, Oceanside, NY USA). Wire-tip electrodes are ideal for making incisions, and ball electrodes are useful for coagulation. Bipolar forceps are especially useful for the coagulation of individual vessels. 10 Access to the surgical field makes these surgeries extremely challenging. A number of specialized retractors allow adequate access. The most versatile retractor is a plastic ring device with a number of completely adjustable stay hooks that can be arranged in any number of useful configurations (Lonestar Retractor; Lonestar Medical Products, Stafford, TX USA) (Fig 7) .",

In most cases, magnification of 1.5 to 3.5\u03eb is adequate. Magnification allows greater visibility of tiny vessels and other structures, but surgeons must practice regularly and become accustomed to this ocular aid to maximize the benefits. Care must be taken to use a magnification system that allows the surgeon to maintain a normal, comfortable posture, and not be forced to lean over or significantly bend the neck. Improper posture leads to fatigue, thereby contributing to back and neck pain. 10, 11 Hemostasis during surgery is of extreme importance in smaller patients because of overall decreased blood volume. Blood losses acceptable in larger species are rapidly fatal in small exotic patients. Sterile, cottontipped applicators are useful for application of direct pressure. Radiosurgical hemostasis is mentioned above. Metal hemostatic clips are manufactured in a variety of sizes and are extremely useful in these patients, especially in situations where manipulation of suture material is extremely difficult to impossible (Hemoclip; Weck, Triangle Park, NC USA) (Figs 8 and 9 ).
