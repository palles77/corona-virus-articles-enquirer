The ELPA flavonoids were identified by HPLC-DAD and UHPLC-MS/MS. 27 The morphological analyses used light and fluorescence microscopy, and cell cycle and DNA 28 fragmentation analyses used flow cytometry to determine the mechanism of cell death induced 29 by ELPA in HL-60. Among the Passiflora leaf extracts evaluated; ELPA stood out with high 30 cytotoxic activity, followed by P. capsularis and P. quadrangulares with varying high and low 31 cytotoxic activity. ELPA presented high cytotoxic potency in HL-60 (IC 50 19.37 \u03bcg/mL), yet 32 without cytotoxic activity against PBMC, suggesting selectivity for tumor cells. The cytotoxic 33 activity of ELPA may well be linked to the presence of ten identified flavonoids. Cells treated 34 with ELPA presented the hallmarks typical of apoptosis and necrosis, with cell cycle arrest in 35 the G2/M phase. Conclusion: From among the studied species, ELPA presented greater 36 cytotoxic activity, possibly a consequence of synergistic flavonoid action which induces cell 37 death by apoptosis and necrosis.",

The steps up to 149 isolation included the addition of 3 mL of Ficoll followed by 15 minutes of centrifugation at 150 1500 rpm, and aspiration of the PBMCs present in the intermediate region between the red 151 blood cells and the plasma. The PBMC suspension was transferred to another tube which was 152 added with saline to the 11 mL volume and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 1000 rpm. The 153 supernatant was discarded, and the PBMC pellet was re-suspended in complete medium (RPMI 154 1640 plus 20% fetal bovine serum and 10 \u03bcg/mL ConA) and counted in a Neubauer chamber 155 for further dilution and plating. 156 157 Determination of the cytotoxic effect of Passiflora extracts on cancer cell lines 158 The MTT assay was used to determine the cytotoxic effect of the 14 extracts of 159 Passiflora leaves against tumor cell lines (20). For all experiments, HCT-116 cells (0,7 x 10 5 160 cells/mL in 100 \u00b5L medium), SF-295 and OVCAR-8 cells (0.1 \u00d7 10 6 cells/mL in 100 \u00b5L 161 medium) were seeded in 96-well plates and incubated in a humidified chamber with 5% CO 2 162 at 37\u00b0C for 24 hours. After this the 14 extracts of Passiflora were solubilized in dimethyl 163 sulfoxide (DMSO, 0.7%), and added to each well at the concentration of 50 \u00b5g/mL. The cells 164 were then incubated for 72 h at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere. After 72 hours, MTT (0.5",

            "text": "Passiflora spp. are usually C-glycosylated with one or more sugar 305 units. Different fragmentation patterns were observed in MS/MS experiments for flavone C-The observed cytotoxic activity of ELPA demonstrated in this study might be attributed 348 to the mixture of various flavonoids found in the extract. Flavonoids have the potential to 349 modify many biological cancer events, such as apoptosis, vascularization, cell differentiation 350 and proliferation (34). Flavonoids found in ELPA such as vitexin and isovitexin also exert 351 chemotherapeutic potential against breast, hepatic, colorectal, lung, skin, oral, prostate, cervix, 352 ovary, esophagus and leukemic cancers (35). Orientin shows an inhibitory effect on the 353 proliferation of esophageal cancer cells (EC-109) and isoorientin demonstrated the ability to 354 inhibit proliferation of liver cancer cells (HepG2) (36-38). Diosmetin, found in ELPA 355 conjugated with C-glucosyl groups (8-C-Glucosyldiosmetin and 6-C-Glucosyldiosmetin), is 356 described as having in vitro anticancer activity against several tumor cells lines, with potent 357 inhibition against leukemic cells (P-388), and lesser cytotoxic activity against HepG2, Hep3B, 358 MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, A549, and Ca9-22 tumor cells (39). These data may justify the in vitro 359 cytotoxic effect presented by ELPA. 360 For drug discovery, cell death related testing is paramount in oncology because 361 resistance to dying is a hallmark of cancer cells (40). Knowing the cytotoxic activity 362 demonstrated by ELPA, we decided to identify the mechanism of the cytotoxicity induced by 363 the extract. For this, HL-60 neoplastic cells were selected for subsequent testing based on the 364 fact that the lineage is among the most widely used cellular models of myeloid origin, and 365 simultaneously was the lineage against which ELPA demonstrated its highest cytotoxic 366 potency. Three concentrations of ELPA, \u00bd IC 50 (9.69 \u03bcg/mL), IC 50 (19.37 \u03bcg/mL) and 2 \u00d7 IC 50 367 (38.74 \u03bcg/mL) were chosen. 368 To ascertain the cellular death process in cancer cells, two tests were performed, 369 hematoxylin-eosin coloration analyzed by light microscopy, and ethidium bromide/acridine 370 orange coloration using fluorescence microscopy. After 72 h incubation, the effect of ELPA 371 was evaluated based on cell morphology using hematoxylin-eosin. The HL-60 cells treated Photomicrography of human tumor cells (HL-60) submitted to hematoxylin/eosin 378 differential staining after 72 hours of incubation and analyzed under a light microscope (100X). 379 A -negative control, B -cells treated with ELPA 9.69 \u00b5g/mL, C -cells treated with ELPA 380 19.77 \u00b5g/mL, D -cells treated with ELPA 38,74 \u00b5g/mL and E -cells treated with doxorubicin. 381 Black arrows indicate cell volume reduction and nuclear fragmentation; red arrows indicate 382 loss of membrane integrity, green arrows indicate cells in mitosis and orange arrow cell 383 swelling. 384 385 To confirm the light microscopy findings, we performed a morphological analysis of 386 cells treated with ELPA by staining and examining cells with AO/EB by fluorescence 387 microscopy. The percentages of viable, apoptotic and necrotic cells were calculated. After 72 388 h, HL-60 cells treated with ELPA showed a reduction in the percentage of viable cells for the 389 concentrations of 9.69 \u00b5g/mL (48.82 \u00b1 3.76%), 19.77 \u00b5g/mL (41.88 \u00b1 2.58%) and 38.74 \u00b5g/mL 390 (34.74 \u00b1 1.25%) when compared to the NC group (91.67 \u00b1 1.72%). The percentage of cells in 391 apoptosis increased for the concentrations of 9.69 \u00b5g/mL (30.74 \u00b1 3.22%), 19.77 \u00b5g/mL (32.44 392 \u00b1 3.23%) and 38.74 \u00b5g/mL (35.88 \u00b1 3.06%) when compared to the NC group (4.95 \u00b1 0.98%). 393 Another process of cell death observed was the increase in the percentage of cells in necrosis, data reaffirm the results found in the morphological analyses using light 398 microscopy; demonstrating that ELPA can cause cell death by apoptotic and necrotic 399 processes. Apoptosis is a programmed cell death process, and many studies suggest the 400 activation of apoptosis as one of the most effective forms of chemotherapy to prevent the 401 development and progression of cancer (41,42). Photodynamic treatment and certain 402 antineoplastic agents, such as \u03b2-lapachone and DNA alkylating agents induce cell death by 403 apoptosis and simultaneously induce cell death by necrosis in a variety of cancer cells (43,44). 404 Considering the two cell death processes involved, ELPA is a promising candidate for in vivo 405 evaluation in animal experimental tumor models. ELPA (\u00b5g/mL) The morphological analysis in HL-60 indicated that apoptosis is one of the mechanisms 417 of death involved in the cytotoxicity observed in ELPA, we resolved to determine DNA 418 fragmentation and alteration in the cell cycle through flow cytometry. The results concerning 419 cell cycle progression showed that the ELPA at all concentrations tested showed a significant 420 increase in the percentage of cells in the G2/M phase, being indicative of cell cycle arrest in 421 the specific phase (",

ELPA presented greater cytotoxic potential against tumor cells, 436 without cytotoxicity in non-tumor human cells. The in vitro cytotoxic activity may be a 437 consequence of synergistic action between the flavonoids found in ELPA, promoting cell cycle 438 arrest in the G2/M phase and inducing cell death by apoptosis and necrosis. This work thus 439 demonstrates the potential of Brazilian plants and opens perspectives for ELPA evaluation in 440 experimental in vivo tumor models. . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.
