In a study of subjects who had been isolated because they had had contact with a MERS patient, 7.6% showed anxiety and 16.6% had developed feelings of anger during the isolation period. 8 A cross-sectional study that examined the mental health of nurses working at a governmentdesignated hospital during a MERS-Coronavirus (CoV) outbreak revealed that the influences of stigma and hardiness on mental health are partially mediated through stress. 9 Psychological trauma of MERS victims and bereaved families has also been anecdotally reported, 10 as many patients suffer from rumors and discrimination even after being treated and cleared of the disease.",

Factor analysis showed first factor was recognition of fatigue and second factor was the interference of fatigue on functioning in physical, family and social area. 12 The PHQ-9 13 is used to monitor depression severity. The questionnaire consists of nine items based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition criteria for depression, scored from 0 to 3, providing a severity score ranging from 0 to 27. Accordingly, depression severity was defined as no depression (1-4), mild depression (5-9), moderate depression (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) , moderately severe depression (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) , and severe depression (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) . The Korean version of the PHQ-9 is a reliable and valid tool for screening and assessing depressed patients (Cronbach's alpha coefficient=0.81). 14 The IES-R was designed to assess symptoms associated with PTSD following a traumatic life event (MERS infection in our study). Symptoms are measured on 22 self-reported items for a total subjective stress assessment that can be further divided into intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal subscales. Individual items describe difficulties associated with stressful events, and participants were asked to indicate the extent to which each item distressed or bothered them over the last 7 days using a rating scale of 0-4. A total score \u226525 is considered clinically significant. 15",

This is in agreement with a longitudinal study 18 of anxiety, depression, and fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis that showed that depression strongly predicts anxiety and fatigue, and that anxiety and fatigue strongly predict subsequent depression. Moreover, previous studies conducted on subjects who had experienced disasters noted that current depression is a predictor of PTSSs. 19 The rate of participants reported clinically significant symptoms in CFS (32.7-48.1%), depression (17.3-26.9%), and PTSD (26.9-42.3%) was comparable to that following SARS. 4 In a 4-year survey in Hong Kong, more than 40% of the respondents had active psychiatric illness, and 40.3% reported a chronic fatigue problem. 20 In addition, a cohort study that investigated psychiatric complications among SARS survivors 30 months after infection found that the prevalence of any psychiatric disorder was 33.3%; 25.6% of patients had PTSD and 15.6% had depressive disorders. 21 Moreover, MERS survivors shared similar psychopathologies as other disaster survivors 22 who reported varying rates of PTSD (30-40%), 23 depression (25%), and fatigue symptoms (50%). These findings suggest that EIDs result not only in physical problems but also psychiatric sequelae in infected persons because they might experience those as disastrous events.",

In EIDs survivors, the Coronavirus itself may have directly caused sleep disorders, fatigue, and behavioral symptoms, which in turn may have resulted in chronic post-inflammatory central nervous system pathologies that adversely affected sleep, pain sensitivity, and energy. 2 It is noteworthy that chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) shares many symptoms with depression and the two are frequently co-diagnosed. 24 However, according to the study which measure the fatigue severity among patients with multiple sclerosis, patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, and healthy adults, fatigue was largely independent of self-reported depressive symptoms. 11 Despite this, the current study appears to be the only longitudinal examination of chronic fatigue, depression, and PTSSs in EIDs survivors.",

Although this was the short-term follow-up study, these results suggest we should give attention to the persisting depression during recovery period in MERS survivors. It would be important for clinicians to assess depression among EIDs survivors with CFS. Furthermore our findings suggest the need to promote interventional programs for MERS survivors with chronic fatigue to prevent prolonged PTSSs by ameliorate depression. Two pos- sible treatments for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) are cognitive behavioral therapy and graded exercise therapy. 25 There is less clear evidence of the benefit of drug therapy for CFS in patients without comorbid depression or anxiety disorders. There were several limitations to this study. First, some sampling bias may have occurred, as <50% of the MERS survivors in Korea consented to participate in the study. It is possible that people who were heavily affected by MERS or who were experiencing mental health difficulties were more prone to participate in the research. In addition, mental health and fatigue symptoms were evaluated using self-reported measures that are not diagnostic in nature but result in assessments of symptomatology. However, these measures have demonstrated validity and reliability in Korea and are consistently correlated with more comprehensive diagnostic tools used to assess corresponding symptoms. Despite these limitations, the present study is the first to examine the relationships among chronic fatigue, depression, and PTSSs in survivors after the MERS epidemic in Korea.",
