The latter process included several cross-species transmissions. We found that the recent, but not the ancient, evolution of astroviruses was associated with a switch in nucleotide composition and codon usage among non-human mammalian versus human/avian astroviruses. Virus and hosts phylogenies based on codon usage agreed with each other and matched the hosts' evolutionary emergence order. This recent switch in driving forces acting at the synonymous level points to the adaptation of codon usage by viruses to that of their hosts after cross-species transmissions. This is the first demonstration of nucleotide composition and codon usage being active driving forces during the recent evolutionary history of a virus group in the host-parasite system.",

Taxonomically, astroviruses belong to the virus family of Astroviridae and are separated into two genera. The Mamastrovirus genus comprises all astroviruses of mammals: eight serotypes of human (HAstV-1 to HAstV-8 from Homo sapiens), feline (FAstV from Felis catus), porcine (PAstV from Sus scrofa), ovine (OAstV from Ovis aries), and mink (MAstV from Mustela vison) astroviruses. The Avastrovirus genus comprises all astroviruses of birds: two types of astroviruses from turkey (TAstV-1 and TAstV-2 from Meleagris gallopavo) and two types of avian nephritis viruses from chicken (ANV-1 and ANV-2 from Gallus gallus) (Lukashov and Goudsmit, 2002) .",

This finding led to the separation of the Astroviridae into two genera, whereas all astroviruses were originally classified as belonging to a single genus of Astrovirus. Within the group of mammalian astroviruses, ovine astrovirus and the recently sequenced mink astrovirus (Mittelholzer et al., 2003a) formed a subcluster distinct from a subcluster of human, feline, and porcine astroviruses (Lukashov and Goudsmit, 2002) . This reconstruction of evolutionary events indicates that in the history of the Astroviridae, the separation between mammalian and avian virus lineages was followed by the consecutive divergence between the ovine/mink and human/feline/porcine virus lineages within the mammalian astroviruses, with the recent events involving several cross-species transmissions. This order of evolutionary events within the family of Astroviridae was evident when nucleotide substitutions were analyzed for the full-length genomes as well as when nucleotide and non-synonymous substitutions were analyzed for each of the three ORFs. However, analysis of synonymous substitutions Fig. 1 .

Boxes indicate topological differences between the two phylogenies. The avian astroviruses are in white, the mammalian astroviruses are in gray (human astroviruses-dark gray, non-human astroviruses-light gray). The scale bars represent either the number of amino acid replacements per site or the relative difference in synonymous codon usage between the species. The bootstrap values are shown. in all three ORFs of astrovirus genomes resulted in poorly structured trees, with avian and ovine viruses being virtually equidistant from each other and from the human viruses (Lukashov and Goudsmit, 2002) . Such a loss of tree structure in analysis of synonymous substitutions has also been observed in other virus families and has been widely interpreted as the result of saturation of synonymous substitutions, since they are subject to reduced selection pressure compared to non-synonymous substitutions.",

At the same time, the projections of both clusters to the X-axis did not overlap, indicating that the characteristics of codon usage in the ovine and mink (and, for ORF2, also in the feline and porcine) astroviruses are largely determined by a different nucleotide composition, in particular by higher GC3-values.",

Previous studies aimed at peculiarities of nucleotide composition and codon usage that are either general for large groups of viruses, like all (human) RNA viruses (Jenkins and Holmes, 2003) , all plant viruses (Dreher and Miller, 2006) , segmented versus nonsegmented viruses (Haseloff et al., 1984) or specific for individual virus species, like SARS coronavirus (Gu et al., 2004) and H5N1 influenza A virus (Zhou et al., 2005) . These studies did not address the role of codon and nucleotide preferences as driving forces in the evolution of particular virus families, primarily due to the lack of data on their evolutionary history. For instance, the differences in codon and nucleotide preferences among the Retroviridae were described (van Hemert and Berkhout, 1995; Berkhout et al., 2002) . Yet, pinpointing these differences to specific evolutionary events is obstructed by the lack of a reliable evolutionary history of this virus family.",

From the point of view of classical evolution, since the relatively low GC-content was observed in both lineages (avian and mammalian), while the relatively high GC-content was observed only in the mammalian lineage, the first feature has to be considered ancestral. The influence of these distinct evolutionary forces on nucleotide composition and codon usage largely explains the topological discrepancies between phylogenetic trees based on either synonymous substitutions (or codon usage) or non-synonymous substitutions (amino acid replacements) in the Astroviridae (Lukashov and Goudsmit, 2002) .",

We noticed a decrease of mean ENC-values in the order ORF2 > ORF1a > ORF1b for the human astroviruses (Fig.  3 , see also Simmonds, 2006) . Extent of codon bias in relation to the level of expression of virus genes in a host-parasite system has been described previously (van Hemert and Berkhout, 1995; Berkhout et al., 2002) . A preference for a subset of the available codons influences either positively (Bennetzen and Hall, 1982; Sharp and Li, 1987) or negatively the rate of translation by competition for iso-accepting tRNA species. Negative effects on the rate of protein synthesis have been demonstrated for poliovirus by deoptimization of synonymous codons (Burns et al., 2006; Mueller et al., 2006) . The reduction of virus particles produced by these mutants was limited to one order of magnitude, whereas viral infectivity decreased by several orders of magnitude. Synonymous substitutions, which do not change amino acids, nevertheless do affect the infectivity of polioviruses. Also, in vitro translation of codon-deoptimized virus genes is severely affected only in non-dialyzed extracts without exogenous additions and in the presence of competing cellular mRNAs (Mueller et al., 2006) , pointing to a crucial role in the shutoff of cellular protein synthesis induced in vivo by the virus (Sanchez et al., 2003) . Astrovirus triggers an apoptotic pathway in host cells (Guix et al., 2004) . In MCF7 cells, the mRNA proportion associated with polysomes is reduced to 3% within 4 h after induction of apoptosis (Bushell et al., 2006) . In addition, RNA editing by adenosine deamination cannot be excluded as a source of sequence diversification in viruses (Bass, 2002) . Species-specific characteristics of ADAR enzymes relevant for virus hosts have not yet been documented.",

The switch in codon usage during diversification of mammalian astroviruses (human versus nonhuman astroviruses) was related to their different nucleotide composition, rather than caused by translational selection, and pointed towards the codon usage of the host species.",

Next to the base content, translational selection can influence the codon usage in a gene. Several methods exist to interpret data in a codon usage table (Comeron and Aguade, 1998) . A single value can be calculated either for the use of a \"preferred set of codons\" or for the divergence from completely random codon usage. The measurement of the effective number of codons (ENC) belongs to the second method and produces a single ENC-value for each gene that is independent of its length and amino acid composition (Wright, 1990 ). An ENC-value can vary between the value of 61, which indicates a completely random, unbiased usage of all 61 existing sense codons, and the value of 20, which indicates the absolute preference, maximally possible bias, when only a single codon is used for each of the 20 amino acids. The upper limit of the ENC-value of 61 holds for the case when all four nucleotides are present in equal proportions (25% each). However, a bias in nucleotide composition limits the randomness of codon choice. For instance, if G and C were absent at the 3rd codon position at all (GC-content is equal to 0), there would be only 30 sense codons with A or T at the 3rd position, and the maximal ENCvalue is 30. On the other hand, with only G and C present at the 3rd codon position (GC-content is equal to 1), the maximum of the ENC-value is 31.",

A continuous line indicates theoretical ENCvalues with random codon usage as a function of GC3.
