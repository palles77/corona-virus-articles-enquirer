The channel properties of the cloned AChRs can be studied with patch clamp technology. Previous studies have shown that the AChRs retain their unique channel properties despite their foreign environment 22. When oocytes were injected with a mixture of c~-, 13-, y-and ~5-subunit mRNAs, they expressed channels that had the same prolonged open time and low conductance characteristic of AChRs in embryonic bovine muscle (Figs 3A and B) . Conversely, oocytes injected with ~-, I]-, ~-and 5-subunit mRNAs expressed AChRs with the brief open time and high conductance typical of channels in adult endplates (Figs 3C and D) . Further experiments showed that the subunit switch also can account for a developmental change in the voltage dependence of AChR channel open time. In this context it is interesting to note that previous work illustrated the importance of the ~-and 5-subunits in regulating AChR gating properties 22. Now two more subunits can be added to the list.",

It seems likely that this is a consequence of innervation. In the rat, denervation at birth inhibits the appearance of adult-type channels TM, suggesting that innervation might promote the expression of a rat e-subunit mRNA and inhibit that of y-subunit mRNA. However, the story may be more complicated. First, it is possible that innervation differentially regulates yand \u00a2-subunit mRNA stability rather than level of expression. Second, the amount of bovine ~-subunit mRNA falls to a low, though detectable, level at postnatal stages. The significance of this decrease in 6-subunit message production remains unclear, but one possibility is that the 6-subunit is also replaced. Finally, recent experiments in the rat indicate that adult-type AChR channels can appear more quickly at developing endplates than new AChRs are thought to be inserted into the membrane 23. This suggests that rats may have an additional mechanism for regulating channel open time.",

Assuming that rat embryonic-and adult-type AChRs also differ in their subunit composition, this suggests that endplate nuclei are producing e-subunit mRNA, while extrajunctional nuclei within the same cytoplasm are producing y-subunit mRNA. This could be tested with insitu hybridization of y-and e-subunit cDNA probes. The results will have important implications for the regulation of AChR gene expression.",

Studies of monozygotic twins discordant for MS have suggested a relationship between frequency and severity of viral disease in early life and development of MS later 9.

The most persuasive documentation of this relationship is Kurtzke's case-control study of American veterans TM. The latitude effect, together with the higher prevalence of MS in individuals of higher socioeconomic status 1, is often taken as supporting the importance of environmental (presumably infectious) factors in MS, and a comparison is made with poliomyelitis, in which similar relationships are observed. Migration data (between high and low prevalence areas) again point to a critical period around puberty before which exposure to the putative environmental agent must occur 15A6. However, recent evidence from Israel is said to negate these findings, since native-born residents of Israel now appear to carry the risk of their immigrant parents for MS (high among Askenazi Jews, low among Sephardic Jews) rather than the risk of the geographical location (Israel is a low risk area) 17. Similarly, in North America, high risk MS areas are congruent with areas of Scandinavian immigration TM.

An attempt has been made, through antibody and T-cell studies, to pin down one or more of these as a specific etiological agent. However, it has become clear that people with multiple sclerosis show elevated serum and CSF antibody titers to many viruses, and no one virus stands out as unusual in this regard, though there have been waves of enthusiasm for measles and for Epstein-Barr virus 24. These elevated titers may be more a reflection of altered immune response to virus in people with MS, than evidence that any single virus is tied to the disease. Immune complexes in the CSF have been found to contain multiple viruses 2s. The CSF also contains a polyclonal T-cell population reactive with many common viruses 26.",

Such MHC is normally not expressed on either vascular or parenchymal elements of the CNS. It is now clear that viral infection may lead directly to the expression of MHC by CNS vascular endothelial cells 36. Perhaps more significant is the release of y-interferon (IFN-y) by T-cells responding to virus. This molecule up-regulates expression of MHC class I and class II antigens, both on CNS vascular endothelium 37 and on astrocytes and other CNS elements, and permits presentation (e.g. of MBP to MBP-reactive Tcells) 3s. MHC expression has actually been demonstrated immunohistochemically on endothelium and astrocytes in and near MS lesions 39. The importance of this mechanism was established in a recent clinical trial, in which injection of IFN-~/was found to precipitate exacerbations of disease in patients with exacerbating-remitting MS 4\u00b0.

In fact, there is no evidence of this; the spouses of people with MS show concordance rates for MS no higher than those found among the general population. If any single virus is implicated, it may well be transmissible, but the disease MS will be seen as an uncommon complication. The evidence already cited makes it more probable that MS is associated with common viral diseases to which we are all exposed at some point in our lives. If this is so, the notion of developing a virus-specific vaccine for prevention of MS may not be realistic. Instead, to intervene in the MS process, we must turn our attention toward control of the immune response to the virus attack and to control of critical inflammatory mediators like IFN-y and recognition elements such as the MHC. In recent years these has been a heightened interest in finding gender differences in brain structure and function to explain presumed genderrelated differences in cognitive ability. The focus has been mainly on the question of hemispheric lateralization in cognitive processing, and in particular, visuospatial processing. The dominant theory holds that males process visuospatial information predominantly with the right hemisphere, and are thus said to be more lateralized, while females use both hemispheres, and are said to be less lateralized or more symmetrical than males. This difference in functional lateralization, or 'specialization', is viewed as an explanation for a presumed gender difference in visuospatial abilities, with males being superior to females.",
