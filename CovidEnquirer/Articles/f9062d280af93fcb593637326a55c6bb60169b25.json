All aerosol-generating procedures should be done in an airborne infection isolation room. Double-gloving, as a standard practice at our unit, might provide extra protection and minimise spreading via fomite contamination to the surrounding equipment after intubation. 3 An experiment with a mannikin showed that NIV or HFNC, when well applied with an optimal fit, only lead to minimal dispersion of exhaled air. 4 However, the specific NIV and HFNC models and modes tested in the study are not universally used across all hospitals. Therefore, to avoid confusion and potential harm, we do not recommend using NIV or HFNC until the patient is cleared of COVID-19. Airway devices providing 6 L/min or more of oxygen are considered highflow 5 and we discourage their use if an airborne infection isolation room is unavailable.",

Methods include the bed-up-head-elevated position, airway manoeuvres, use of a positive end expiratory pressure valve, and airway adjuncts. If manual bagging is required, we suggest gentle ventilation via a supraglottic device instead of bag mask ventilation. Although no robust evidence is available to show that the use of supraglottic devices are less aerosolgenerating than BMV, the devices are easy to insert and can achieve sufficient seal pressure. They also help to spare manpower and thus reduce staff exposure. Furthermore, many newer generation supraglottic devices provide a conduit for un assisted intubation.",
