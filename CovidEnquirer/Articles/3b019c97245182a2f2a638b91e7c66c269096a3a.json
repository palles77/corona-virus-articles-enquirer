The development of a computer based system of data management has made the storage, compilation, and rapid retrieval of large amounts of diagnostic information possible. This system is capable of handling large volumes of diagnostic data such as results of histopathology, serology, toxicology, virology, parasitology, necropsy, and microbiology examinations as well as demographic-zoographic/patient data. This system uses the full screen capabilities of IBM 3278 series computer terminals to display a blank panel (essentially a blank form for recording laboratory results) which is filled in by the laboratory technicians at the major data generating stations throughout the laboratory. Preliminary, final, and supplemental reports or select diagnostic data for each accession are printed by the computer directly from this information, and copies of these reports are sent to the person(s) responsible for submitting the accession. Individual accession records are kept in a VSAM database (IBM program product) and archived to magnetic tape every quarter. Information from these records is abstracted by the computer for an annual concordance catalogue index and other administrative reports. During the development of our data storage and retrieval system, several design objectives were conceived and followed. These included: 1. The system should be easy to use, and require little training; 2. The system should allow for easy production of summaries and year-end reports, preferably using an existing file processing package such as Mark IV (Informatics, Inc.); 3. The system should allow for easy update of accession records; 4. The system should interface with the existing concordance index program [2]; 5. There should be little or no keypunching or other data entry required to produce an 325 annual or other compiled concordance indexes. Data for compiled reports should be acquired passively from existing files originally created to store laboratory data for reporting purposes ;",

If the data entry operator needs more space than is available on the panel to enter or report a finding, a free text reference can be entered in the appropriate field, eg. the \"I A 1\" at the arrow on line 9 in Fig. 2 . This allows the operator to continue the report of a finding in a free text area (eg. \"I A 1 EYES.\"in Fig. 2 (a) on line 3).

In this case, a serological examination of aminals A-J was performed, using complement fixation tests and hemagglutination inhibition tests (Figs 9 and 9(a) ). The ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) panel is used for reporting results of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), rat coronavirus (RCV), Sendai virus, or Mycoplasma testing for serum antibodies (Fig. 10 ). An ELISA to test for Mycoplasma pulmonis antibody was performed on the sera of animals A-J (Figs 10 and 10(a) ). (Figs 11 and 12) There are two formats for entry of histopathology results. The first of these results in a tabular report (Fig. 11) is entered in complete sentences or narrative form on this panel, and printed out exactly as entered.

Multiple copies are generated without the need for preprinted forms. Errors are corrected electronically by data entry operators. Computer stored and accessed directories of complete mailing addresses of referring veterinarians and selected clients are entered by three digit code, thus speeding up data entry and improving accuracy and completeness of addresses. Use of window envelopes eliminates the need for addressing envelopes. There is no typing of reports per se, rather, data is entered from the laboratory by laboratory technicians or a data entry operator. Accession history and demographic-zoographic data is acquired for concordance indexing without the need for reentry. All data is held in a form accessible through Mark IV and specialized programs can be prepared for summarized reporting using an optional \"display\" mode. Additional panels can be created if needed, thus, allowing for future expansion.",
