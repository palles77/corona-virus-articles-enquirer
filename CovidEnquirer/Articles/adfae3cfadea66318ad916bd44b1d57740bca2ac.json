No new cases have been reported since then. A total of 299 patients died from the disease. Patients with the more severe form of SARS often required mechanical ventilation. For some of the patients who had a prolonged period of intubation, tracheostomy was needed for optimal respiratory care. At our hospital, 184 patients were admitted with SARS between the end of March and early June 2003. Most of the patients were residents of Amoy Gardens where the largest community SARS outbreak occurred. Forty-two patients with SARS were admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU), 34 (81%) of whom required tracheal intubation and ventilatory support. Two patients had surgical tracheostomy. Twenty-seven of the 34 patients (79%) died despite drug therapy, mechanical ventilation and organ support. We report our experience of the anaesthetic management of a SARS patient undergoing surgical tracheostomy.",

He went to the Accident and Emergency Department of our hospital on March 27, 2003 with fever and shortness of breath, and eventually SARS was con-\u00aermed. His condition deteriorated and he was admitted to the ICU on April 12 for mechanical ventilation. He was given ribavirin, kaletra (coformulation of lopinavir and ritonivir, both inhibitors of HIV protease), ritonivir, antibiotics, pulse methyprednisolone and immunoglobulin. His condition was further complicated by bilateral spontaneous pneumothoraces. His tracheal tube frequently became blocked with secretions. Thus, surgical tracheostomy was performed on May 7 when he was clinically more stable. Immediately before surgery he was on synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation with pressure support mode. His arterial saturation was 92% when he was ventilated with oxygen 40%. Both chest drains were swinging but not bubbling. He was anaemic, with a haemoglobin concentration of 11 g dl \u00b11 but his renal and liver function were normal. He was \u00aenally weaned off the ventilator 19 days after tracheostomy. He was transferred to a nearby district hospital for convalescence on June 5, a few days after being decannulated.",

All theatre personnel wore protective clothing consisting of a Tyvek\u00e2 BarrierMan (DuPont Nonwovens, Peoples' Republic of China) and water-resistant disposable gown, cap, boots, double gloves, goggles, N95 mask, and AirMate\u00d4 (3M Occupational Health and Environmental Safety Division, USA), with a Tyvek\u00e2 head cover down to both shoulders. A practice run immediately before the operation was conducted to ensure smooth running of the whole procedure, including transfer to and from the operating theatre, surgery, and for decontamination and disinfection of the operating theatre.

The patient was transported on an adjustable trolley with a portable ventilator to allow a safe distance between the patient and intensivist. After positioning with a shoulder support and head ring, the patient was operated on the trolley to reduce unnecessary disconnection of catheters and tubing during transfer to and from the operating table.

After preoxygenation with oxygen 100% for 3 min, apnoea was allowed to facilitate incision of the trachea and insertion of a tracheostomy tube. When the surgeon signalled that he was going to incise the trachea, the cuff of the tracheal tube was de\u00afated and the tube was pulled back 3 cm. No tracheal or wound suctioning was attempted, to avoid aerosol generation of blood or secretions. A closed suction system and a viral \u00aelter of 99.97% ef\u00aeciency were incorporated into the catheter mount to facilitate suctioning in a closed system. Another viral \u00aelter was connected to the breathing circuit for added safety. Once the tracheostomy tube was in place, as con\u00aermed by the presence of carbon dioxide on end-tidal gas sampling and chest movement, the tracheal tube was removed under a large piece of clear plastic in which it was immediately wrapped and disposed of in a plastic bag designated for contaminated waste. After the operation, which took 15 min, the patient was reconnected to the portable monitor and ventilator. Once his condition was stable, the patient was transferred back to the ICU by a separate transport team. This allowed the operating team ample time to decontaminate and disinfect the operating theatre, and then remove and dispose of their personal protective equipment without contaminating themselves.",

            "text": "Tracheal intubation and tracheostomy are aerosol-generating procedures which may facilitate transmission of the aetiological agent for SARS. It is thus recommended that aerosol-inducing procedures should be performed on SARS patients only when deemed absolutely necessary. Procedures should be carried out using both contact (e.g. gloves, gown and eyewear) and airborne precautions (e.g. respiratory protective devices with \u00aelter ef\u00aeciency of greater than or equal to 95%). 3 One survey showed that the practice of droplet and contact precautions was adequate in signi\u00aecantly reducing the risk of infection after exposure to patients with SARS. 4 However, in Toronto three anaesthetists using traditional respiratory and contact precautions contracted SARS after intubating patients with respiratory failure of unknown cause. 5 In Hong Kong, three out of 160 ICU staff at one teaching hospital contracted SARS despite stringent measures being in place. 6 We therefore decided that, in addition to contact and airborne precautions, staff should use the 3M AirMate power air purifying respirator. 5 The AirMate and head cover are not easy to put on quickly and training is highly recommended. We also followed the recommendation of putting on a double gown for maximum protection. 5 The outer gown is water resistant and is removed in the operating theatre. The outer pair of gloves is changed to a clean pair just before leaving the operating theatre. The AirMate, BarrierMan and boots are removed in an adjacent gown-down area. We prefer the BarrierMan, which is a full body overall with hood, instead of an inner gown because it covers the neck and both lower legs. The BarrierMan is dif\u00aecult to take off but training lessens cross-contamination. An inspector with full knowledge of infection control is required to supervise removal of personal protective equipment. Immediately afterwards, the staff should go directly to the changing room for a shower.",

Patients with SARS presenting for tracheostomy are in the pulmonary destruction phase of the illness. They often have a ground glass appearance on chest radiograph, poor arterial blood saturation, superimposed bacterial lung infection and a high risk of spontaneous pneumothoraces. The SARS process may affect the haematological system, resulting in anaemia, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. Patients may also have liver dysfunction re\u00afected by raised alanine aminotransferase and hypoalbuminaemia. 1 Renal impairment may develop and patients may require renal replacement therapy. A clinical picture resembling disseminated intravascular coagulopathy may occur. All these problems may be further complicated by the drug therapy. Ribavirin can cause haemolytic anaemia, hypotension, brady/tachycardia, seizures, nephrolithiasis, elevated serum bilirubin and ammonia, and skin eruptions.
