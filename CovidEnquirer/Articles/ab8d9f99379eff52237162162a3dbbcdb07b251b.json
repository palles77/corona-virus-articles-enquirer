Respiratory viral infections are key components in predisposing cattle to the development of this disease. To quantify the contribution of four viruses commonly associated with BRD, a case-control study was conducted nested within the National Bovine Respiratory Disease Initiative project population in Australian feedlot cattle. Effects of exposure to Bovine viral diarrhoea virus 1 (BVDV-1), Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) and Bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPIV-3), and to combinations of these viruses, were investigated.",

Compared to animals that were seropositive for all four viruses at induction, animals were at progressively increased risk with increasing number of viruses for which they were seronegative; those seronegative for all four viruses were at greatest risk (OR: 2.4). Animals that seroincreased for one or more viruses from induction to second blood sampling were at increased risk (OR: 1.4-2.1) of BRD compared to animals that did not seroincrease for any viruses. Collectively these results confirm that prior exposure to these viruses is protective while exposure at or after feedlot entry increases the risk of development of BRD in feedlots. However, the modest increases in risk associated with seroincrease for each virus separately, and the progressive increases in risk with multiple viral exposures highlights the importance of concurrent infections in the aetiology of the BRD complex. These findings indicate that, while efficacious vaccines could aid in the control of BRD, vaccination against one of these viruses would not have large effects on population BRD incidence but vaccination against multiple viruses would be expected to result in greater reductions in incidence. The findings also confirm the multifactorial nature of BRD development, and indicate that multifaceted approaches in addition to efficacious vaccines against viruses will be required for substantial reductions in BRD incidence.",

BRD has a multifactorial aetiology requiring pathogenic organisms, susceptible cattle and environmental stressors (Edwards, 2010) . Of the viral infections commonly associated with BRD, most in isolation are http://dx.doi.org/10. 1016/j.prevetmed.2016 .01.024 0167-5877/\u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. thought to not result in severe clinical signs (Ellis, 2009) . However under suitable conditions, viral induced immunosuppression and damage to the respiratory epithelia may lead to secondary bacterial respiratory tract infection and clinical signs of BRD (Ellis, 2009) . Viruses are believed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of BRD, but the clinical presentation can develop with different combinations of viruses and bacteria so no particular infectious agents are known to be necessary causes of BRD (Confer, 2009; Ellis, 2009 ). The relative importance of specific pathogens in a particular population is likely to depend on dynamic relationships between the presence, virulence, and rate of transmission of pathogens, and prevalence of immunity amongst cattle in the population and the associated degree of herd immunity (Panciera and Confer, 2010) .",

Reported seroprevalences for particular viruses at initial sampling around the time of feedlot entry have varied between populations.

            "text": "Animals with low antibody titres to BoHV-1 at feedlot entry were at increased risk of BRD compared with animals with high titres in two studies (Martin and Bohac, 1986; Martin et al., 1989) but no such association was evident at the group level (Martin et al., 1990) , nor at animal level where the risk of infection was low (Martin et al., 1999) . Animals that were seropositive for BVDV-1 or had higher concentrations of BVDV-1 antibodies at initial sampling were at decreased risk of BRD in several studies (Martin et al., 1989 (Martin et al., , 1999 Durham et al., 1991; Booker et al., 1999; O'Connor et al., 2001) . Seroincrease for BVDV-1 has been associated with increased risk of BRD at both the animal level and the group level (Martin and Bohac, 1986; Martin et al., 1990; O'Connor et al., 2001) . In one study BVDV-1 was isolated from 26 of 90 BRD case samples and zero of nine control samples from lungs sampled at necropsy (Booker et al., 2008) . Further studies demonstrated associations between both BVDV-1 serology and virus detection and occurrence of BRD (Fulton et al., 2000 (Fulton et al., , 2002b . Relationships between initial BRSV titres and BRD risk, and between seroincrease for BRSV and BRD risk, have been inconsistent (Martin et al., 1988 (Martin et al., , 1989 (Martin et al., , 1998 (Martin et al., , 1990 (Martin et al., , 1999 Allen et al., 1992; Fulton et al., 2002b) . While BPIV-3 has been isolated from BRD cases in combination with other agents (Fulton et al., 2000) , serological associations between BPIV-3 and BRD risk have also been inconsistent (Martin et al., 1988 (Martin et al., , 1989 (Martin et al., , 1990 (Martin et al., , 1998 (Martin et al., , 1999 Allen et al., 1992; Fulton et al., 2002b) . Viral genotypes/subtypes commonly associated with BRD and present in Australia differ from those reported elsewhere (Smith et al., 1995; Mahony et al., 2005; Horwood et al., 2008) so North American findings may not be generalisable to Australian feedlot populations. Australian seroprevalence surveys indicate that BoHV-1, BVDV-1, BRSV and BPIV-3 are ubiquitous in cattle herds (Dunn et al., 1995; Smith et al., 1995; Durham and Paine, 1997; Taylor et al., 2006) . In one Australian study seroprevalences at feedlot entry for 500 sentinel cattle in 24 feedlot pens in six feedlots over 18 months were 13% for BoHV-1, 68% for BVDV-1, 27% for BRSV and 57% for BPI-3 (Dunn et al., 1995) . In this population, seroconversion (i.e. changing from seronegative to seropositive) for BoHV-1 and BVDV-1 were associated with increased risk of BRD while seroconversion to BRSV and BPIV-3 were not (Dunn et al., 1995) . This study lacked power to assess the effects of viruses for which seroprevalence at induction was high and the effects of combinations of viruses on BRD.",

Further, the current study addresses the limitations of prior research by sampling animals from a large number of farms within a sufficient number of pens and feedlots across a range of time points and geographical regions, ensuring adequate power to investigate the effects of exposure to viruses and combinations of viruses on BRD across a large population with varying seroprevalences at feedlot entry.

To estimate the effects of each serological predictor on the risk of BRD, models were fitted based on a priori constructed causal diagrams which explicitly considered biologically plausible pathways (Greenland et al., 1999; Shrier and Platt, 2008; Dohoo et al., 2009; Textor and Liskiewicz, 2011) . One causal diagram depicted postulated causal relationships between measured exposure variables of interest in the case-control study and between exposure variables and being a BRD case (Fig. 1) . A further diagram (Fig. 2) was constructed for use with the combined virus variables. Causal diagrams can be used to determine 'adjustment sets' of appropriate covariates to include in models to determine the effects of interest. A minimal sufficient adjustment set is the minimal set of covariates which adequately controls confounding of the relationship between a specified exposure variable and the outcome variable. The causal diagrams (Figs. 1 and 2) were used to BoHV-1, bovine viral diarrhoea virus 1 (BVDV-1), bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPIV-3) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) \"change\" variables represent one of the three variables that measured change in serostatus between induction and follow-up, (e.g. BRSV composite, BRSV composite (collapsed) or BRSV seroconversion). c Cohort size: total number of NBRDI study animals enrolled into animal's cohort. d Mixing summary: mixing prior to day-27 (yes, no) and number of group-28s forming cohort. e BVDV-1 detected on quantitative real time-PCR testing of any pooled or individual sample from animal in the animal's cohort. f BVDV-1 persistently infected animal in group 28 days before induction. determine minimal sufficient adjustment sets to include as covariates in models when estimating the effects of serological exposures on risk of BRD. The postulated causal diagrams were reproduced within the DAGitty \u00ae software user interface to determine the minimal sufficient adjustment set to include in models to estimate the effects for each exposure of interest on the outcome of being a BRD case. The Stata \u00ae statistical software package (version 12) was used for all data management, preliminary analyses and to run the multilevel modelling software package, MLwiN \u00ae (version 2.27) which was used for modelling. For each exposure of interest, a model containing covariates determined by the minimal sufficient adjustment set was fitted using second-order penalised quasi-likelihood methods to produce starting values for the second model using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Test batch and selection batch were included in most models as fixed effects; but they were not included in seroconversion models because models with sparse or empty categories for these variables failed to run. Three-level models were fitted, with random effects for feedlot and cohort nested within feedlot. Non-informative prior distributions were specified. Convergence was assessed by inspecting diagnostic trajectory plots and summary statistics (Browne, 2012 ) as previously described (Hay et al., 2014) .

Being able to adjust for prior mixing history in the analyses was an important strength because serostatus at induction would be expected to vary depending on both if and when prior mixing occurred.",

BRD misclassification errors may have led to some misclassification bias. However, any such bias would be expected to be towards the null and confounding due to differences in misclassification amongst feedlots would be expected to be at least partially controlled by fitting random effects for feedlots.

An example of this was the timing of collection of the follow-up sera. While an optimal time, day 42, was stipulated, the actual day of collection was at the discretion of feedlot managers, based on availability of resources such as staffing, as long as it was within 35-60 days. Further, in the commercial setting, it was not feasible to repeat sample collection at a particular stage (i.e. induction or follow-up) if samples collected were unsuitable. Animals from nine cohorts were ineligible for inclusion in the case-control study because the time between initial and follow-up samples was more than 60 days (three cohorts), no samples were collected (five cohorts) or all sam- a Seronegative at induction was designated 0 and any positive value was designated 1. b BoHV-1: bovine herpesvirus 1, BVDV-1: bovine viral diarrhoea virus 1, BRSV: bovine respiratory syncytial virus, BPIV-3: bovine parainfluenza virus 3. c Pooled weighted seroprevalences calculated as (0.84 \u00d7 observed percentage in controls + 0.16 \u00d7 observed percentage in cases) based on the ratio of the sampling fractions for selection from the NBRDI project population as a case versus as a control (5.3:1).",

About 4% of case-control animals were excluded from analysis of the combined virus serochange variable because results for at least one virus were deemed biologically implausible. Incorrectly paired samples due, for example, to animal or sample identification errors could cause these.

Based on weighted seroprevalence, an estimated 24% of NBRDI study animals were seropositive for BoHV-1 at induction compared to 13% in a previous Australian study (Dunn et al., 1995) and 1-18% in North American studies (Martin and Bohac, 1986; Martin et al., 1989 Martin et al., , 1990 Martin et al., , 1999 . At induction, 69% of the NBRDI project population were estimated to have antibodies to BVDV-1; this is consistent with a prior Australian study that reported a seroprevalence of 68% (Dunn et al., 1995) . In the current study, 89% of animals were seropositive for BRSV and 91% were seropositive for BPIV-3 at induction, both of which are much higher than that reported in North American studies (Martin and Bohac, 1986; Martin et al., 1989 Martin et al., , 1990 Martin et al., , 1999 and seroprevalences of 27% and 57% for BRSV and BPIV-3, respectively, at initial sampling of cattle entering Australian feedlots (Dunn et al., 1995) . Overall, it is apparent that high proportions of cattle entering Australian feedlots are seropositive for BVDV-1, BRSV, and BPIV-3 with fewer seropositive for BoHV-1. The generally higher seroprevalence compared to those reported in North American studies are not unexpected because cattle entering feedlots in North America are generally younger and lighter (Snowder et al., 2007; Sanderson et al., 2008) . Although age of study animals at induction was unknown, median weight at induction for cattle enrolled in the NBRDI was 438 kg (Ref: Hay et al., 2016b) compared to a median of 335 kg in a large North American study (Sanderson et al., 2008) . Animals entering Australian feedlots have more extensive mixing histories (Hay et al., 2014) ; older animals which have previously been commingled with animals from other farms would be more likely have been exposed to and developed immunological memory to a wider range of pathogens compared to younger animals. Some differences between studies may also be attributable to differences in serological testing methods and classification cutpoints. For example, in the current study, substantial proportions of animals had low antibody levels (category 1), especially for BRSV (23%) and BPIV-3 (15%), and we classified these as seropositive; this may have resulted in higher seroprevalences compared with previous studies.",

            "text": "Our results indicate that induction serostatus categories of 1 or higher for BRSV and BPIV-3 at induction offered similar degrees of protection regardless of category. In contrast, induction serostatus category of 2 or higher for BVDV-1 was required for any protection from BRD, while for BoHV-1, category 2 and 3 was protective but 4 and 5 was associated with increased risk of BRD. It is possible that those animals in category 1 at initial sampling were recently exposed and had not yet developed maximal immunity. Similarly, categories 4 or 5 were possibly also more recently exposed animals whereas those in antibody categories 2 or 3 at induction may have been exposed a sufficient time prior to induction to produce a more effective immunity. Nevertheless, seropositivity at induction was associated with reduced risk of BRD for all four viruses. While findings from previous studies generally also indicate that seropositivity to BVDV-1 (Martin and Bohac, 1986; Martin et al., 1989 Martin et al., , 1990 Dunn et al., 1995; O'Connor et al., 2001) and BoHV-1 (Martin and Bohac, 1986; Martin et al., 1989; Dunn et al., 1995) at initial sam-pling was associated with decreased risk of BRD, effects of BRSV and BPIV-3 serostatus at induction have been inconsistent (Martin and Bohac, 1986; Martin et al., 1989 Martin et al., , 1990 Allen et al., 1992) . Seroepidemiological studies are subject to limitations in external validity because not all viruses of interest may be circulating in any particular feedlot population, the virulence of particular strains of virus may vary in different locations and over time, and the effects of particular viruses are likely to depend on the prevalence of immunity amongst cattle in the population and the associated degree of herd immunity, and on non-infectious factors. Limitations are more likely to impact on results of studies involving small or localised populations. These limitations are less likely to have influenced the external validity of results of the current study for extrapolating to the Australian feedlot population due to the large study population, the enrolment of a substantial number of geographically widely dispersed feedlots, and the fact that those feedlots obtained animals from a wide geographic area.",

This indicated that each of these viruses modestly to moderately increased the risk of BRD. Our results also indicated that these risk increases were cumulative. The risk of BRD increased as the number of the four viruses that the animal had antibodies to at induction decreased and those animals seroincreasing to one virus were at increased risk compared to those not seroincreasing to any viruses, with those seroincreasing to at least two viruses at markedly increased risk (Table 8 ). This accumulating risk demonstrates the complexity of BRD development and suggests additive effects of exposure to additional viruses. Importantly, 15% of cases did not seroincrease for any of the four viruses studied. Viruses are generally accepted as playing an important role in initiating BRD, but not all putative viruses or other infectious pathogens that have been associated with BRD were investigated in the current study. For example, Mycoplasma bovis (Horwood et al., 2014) and Bovine coronavirus (Moore et al., 2014) may play important roles. Although biological synergism between infectious agents is believed to play an important role in the development of BRD (Ellis, 2009) , close correlations in serological variables and significant interactions between effects of specific viruses on BRD risk were not observed in the current study.",

In determining the relative importance of these viruses at the population level, we need to consider the proportions of animals that seroincrease and the proportion of animals initially at risk of seroincrease (i.e. induction serostatus category 3 or less). In the NBRDI project population, the largest percentage (98%) of animals was susceptible to seroincrease for BoHV-1. Of animals not vaccinated at induction, 23% seroincreased, while across the NBRDI population an estimated 48% seroincreased. Thus, assuming similar odds ratios for BRD due to seroincrease to each virus, BoHV-1 probably had the greatest impact in the study population, contributing the largest increase in BRD incidence at the population level. Interestingly amongst animals vaccinated with Rhinogard \u00ae at induction, those seroconverting to BoHV-1 during the time on feed were at increased risk of BRD (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.6) compared with those not seroconverting, with a similar effect size to that observed with seroconversion or seroincrease for each of the other viruses, raising uncertainty about the efficacy of this vaccine in preventing BRD.",

The high seroprevalence at induction (66% ; Table 4 ) in this subset provides evidence that natural exposure to BVDV-1 is widespread in Australian cattle prior to feedlot entry. Of animals initially seronegative, more than half were estimated to seroconvert between induction and followup and seroconversion was associated with a markedly increased risk of BRD. This suggests that BVDV-1 infection is an important risk factor for BRD in populations of immunologically na\u00efve animals. Implications of this should be considered if a large-scale BVDV-1 control program is to be implemented in the Australian beef industry. If the proportion of cattle arriving at feedlots without immunity to BVDV-1 is decreased without substantial reductions in probability of exposure of feedlot cattle to BVDV-1, risk of BRD may be increased.",

Our results, unlike other studies, provide strong evidence that being seropositive for BRSV or BPIV-3 at induction is associated with reduced risk, while exposure to BRSV and BPIV-3 at the feedlot increases risk of BRD. The roles of individual viruses will be more important in populations with low seroprevalences at induction. Although not all viruses implicated in the BRD complex were investigated in the current study, for each virus investigated, seroincrease was associated with only a modest increase in risk, indicating that each virus in isolation has only a modest effect on BRD risk. However, seroincrease for multiple viruses further increased risk, indicating that exposure to multiple viruses resulted in markedly increased risk of BRD. These findings confirm the multifactorial nature of BRD development. In addition, for animals not vaccinated against BVDV-1 that seroconverted to that agent, BRD risk was markedly increased. Collectively these results indicate that, while efficacious vaccines could aid in the control of BRD, vaccination against one of these viruses would not have large effects on population BRD incidence but vaccination against multiple viruses would be expected to result in greater reductions in incidence. While viruses have a critical role in initiating BRD, there is also a need to focus on the multifactorial nature of the disease and consider other risk factors in addition to viral pathogens when planning BRD control strategies.",
