With another 0.5 million pilgrims from the host country, the Hajj is one of the most crowded annual mass gatherings on the planet [1, 2] . The focal attraction of the pilgrimage is the symbolic house of God, the Ka'bah, and its surrounding mountains, and the Holy Mosque (or Grand Mosque) compound, which confines the pilgrims in a semi-closed setting. As part of the rituals, pilgrims circumambulate the Ka'bah for hours in successive episodes, and then, in the later part of the festival, they move in a body to Mina, a valley on the outskirts of Mecca, where they stay in tents for several nights, usually in groups of 50-100 individuals in a large tent [2] . Prolonged close contact, physical exertion and overcrowding in a semi-closed setting increase the susceptibility of pilgrims to airborne infections, including meningococcal disease and influenza [2] [3] [4] .",

In addition, a range of other viruses, e.g., rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), can cause infections that frequently mimic influenza. Furthermore, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) has been reported to be an important cause of respiratory infections in children, as well as adults, since its discovery in 2001 [8] , but its incidence among the Hajj pilgrims is unknown. In this context, the present investigation used a consistent study design, including sample collection and laboratory methods, to compare the rates of influenza virus, rhinovirus, RSV, hMPV, adenovirus and parainfluenza virus infection among UK and Saudi pilgrims suffering from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) during the Hajj 2006.",

Two nasal swabs were taken from each pilgrim. The first was used for point-of-care testing for influenza virus (QuickVue influenza test; Quidel Corp., San Diego, CA, USA), and the second was immersed in lysis buffer for subsequent transport via a specialist courier service under optimum conditions to the UK for real-time RT-PCR (rtRT-PCR) assays. Nasal swabs were chosen, rather than nasal washings or throat swabs, because they are quicker and more acceptable to pilgrims, thereby allowing more sampling in the limited time available. Individuals who yielded positive results according to the QuickVue test were offered a course of oseltamivir if symptomatic for <48 h.

Immunisation uptake was low in both years [11] . The rate of influenza among vaccinated pilgrims was lower than that among unvaccinated pilgrims (7% vs. 14%), but this difference was not statistically significant, which is consistent with findings in previous studies [5, 7] . There are two possible reasons for the failure of influenza vaccine to make a significant difference: (i) a major proportion of vaccinated pilgrims were 'at risk' individuals who are naturally more susceptible to influenza virus (and in whom vaccine is less immunogenic) than the unvaccinated group, most of whom were otherwise healthy and hence less vulnerable to infection; and (ii) there was a possible mismatch between the vaccine strains and circulating strains. Thus, during the Hajj 2004 (in March), the commonest circulating strain of influenza virus was influenza B Sichuan [12] , but the corresponding vaccine strain was influenza B Hong Kong for both hemispheres [13, 14] . Other examples of vaccine failure and mismatch among non-Hajj travellers have been reported [15, 16] . It is open to debate whether the same influenza vaccine is fully protective in both hemispheres of the world, particularly in travellers with poor immunity. Therefore, antiviral drugs should be considered as an adjunct to vaccination for postexposure prophylaxis at the Hajj [17] .",

Only four (4%) Saudi 'not at risk' pilgrims had received the vaccine, with no improvement in uptake since 2003, when Balkhy et al. [6] reported 4.4% coverage among 500 international pilgrims, of whom a major fraction were Saudi. A recent survey also revealed a very low uptake (5.9%) of influenza vaccine among Saudi healthcare workers employed at the Hajj [18] . It seems that a vigorous campaign is required to improve influenza vaccine coverage among domestic pilgrims and healthcare workers at the Hajj. This is the first study to diagnose rhinovirus infection from respiratory specimens taken at the Hajj, although El-Sheikh et al. [19] used serological methods to diagnose five (7%) cases of infection with picorna virus (without species categorisation) among 76 serum samples taken at the Hajj in 1991 and 1992, which presumably were rhinoviruses. However, these viruses were not detected in virus culture of the throat sam-ples. Seasonal variations are the likely explanations for the varying results in these two studies. Scorching summer temperatures during the Hajj in 1991 and 1992 might have resulted in poor detection of the virus in the study by El-Sheikh et al. [19] , while the lower temperatures during the Hajj 2006 might have resulted in greater virus yields [20] . The frequency of rhinovirus was significantly higher in the Mecca City area than in Mina, indicating that rhinovirus was predominantly circulating selectively in the Grand Mosque area among certain groups of worshippers (e.g., UK pilgrims), who later introduced it to other individuals in their respective blocks of tents in Mina. Unlike influenza virus, rhinovirus spreads mainly via close personal contact [21] . The spread of rhinovirus specifically among the UK pilgrims may have been accelerated by the crowded conditions at the Grand Mosque during circumambulation and other prayers, and in local hotels at least 2 weeks before the domestic pilgrims attended the Hajj. Choudhry et al. [22] demonstrated that attendance at a large Mosque (i.e., Namera mosque in Arafat) increases the risk of acquiring URTI among Hajj pilgrims. During the Hajj, the Grand Mosque is more crowded than any other mosque in the world, facilitating the spread of respiratory viruses in Mecca City.",
