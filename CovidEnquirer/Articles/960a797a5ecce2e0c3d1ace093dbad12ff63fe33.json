Another problem frequently encountered is that in bacterial infections, antibiotics are frequently used without regard to an understanding of their efficacy against the typical bacterial causes of ABRS. Little logic exists when a patient with ABRS is first prescribed TMP/SMX, then is switched to cefaclor when symptoms do not improve, and subsequently is prescribed azithromycin when again there is still no improvement. No agent in this example provides adequate empirical treatment for S pneumoniae or H influenzae, both major bacterial pathogens in ABRS.",

Rather than just create a list of antibiotics, numerous factors (eg, microbiology of ABRS, pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic principles, features of common oral antibiotics, the resistance mechanisms of bacterial pathogens, and the results of surveillance studies focused on prevalence of resistant pathogens) assisting in the selection of antimicrobial agents are discussed. All this information, in conjunction with a mathematical model for analyzing treatment outcomes, leads to the development of rational treatment guidelines that will assist clinicians in providing optimal treatment for their patients.",

            "text": "In the United States, the average child has 3 to 8 and the average adult has 2 to 3 acute viral respiratory illnesses per year. 1, 2 Because up to 90% of these patients will have CT scan evidence of paranasal sinus involvement, they are considered to have a self-limiting viral rhinosinusitis (VRS). 1, 3 Bacterial infections, also referred to as ABRS, complicate roughly 0.5% to 2% of VRS. 1, 4 It is estimated that more than 1 billion cases of VRS occur annually in the United States. Assuming a 2% bacterial complication rate, 20 million cases of VRS are complicated by ABRS annually. In addition to its public health implications, rhinosinusitis has a considerable economic impact. In 1996, the primary diagnosis of rhi-nosinusitis led to expenditures of approximately $3.39 billion in the United States. 5 The National Center for Health Statistics conducts a sample survey of office-based physicians in the United States called the NAMCS. Data from NAMCS for 1980, 1985, 1989, 1992, and 1995 indicate an increase in the number of adult visits to physicians' offices resulting in a diagnosis of acute or chronic rhinosinusitis. 6, 7 According to NAMCS data, sinusitis is the fifth most common diagnosis for which an antibiotic is prescribed. A diagnosis of rhinosinusitis was made for 7%, 9%, and 12% of all antibiotic prescriptions written in 1985, 1989 , and 1992, respectively. 6 As the total number of antibiotic prescriptions increased throughout the last decade, resistance to antimicrobial agents among bacterial respiratory pathogens emerged as a significant public health issue. Because antibiotic use is causally related to the development and spread of bacterial drug resistance, [8] [9] [10] [11] strategies resulting in prudent and rational antimicrobial use are increasingly important. In rhinosinusitis, two scenarios for antibiotic prescribing are of particular concern. First is the frequent treatment of uncomplicated VRS with antimicrobials. Second is the selection of antimicrobial agents without documented efficacy. The goal of this panel is to develop guidelines for the judicious use of antibiotics in the treatment of ABRS.",

Human rhinovirus and coronavirus do not cause major epithelial damage, but influenza virus and adenovirus do damage the nasal epithelium. 13, 14 Most of these infections occur in the early fall to early spring seasons. Human rhinovirus enters the nose and attaches to a rhinovirus receptor on epithelial cells in the posterior nasopharynx. 15 Subsequent activation of both inflammatory pathways and the parasympathetic nervous system generates the symptoms and signs of viral rhinitis and viral sinusitis.",

            "text": "Patients with a common cold usually report some combination of the following symptoms: sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, hyposmia/anosmia, facial pressure, postnasal drip, sore throat, cough, ear fullness, fever, and myalgia. Contrary to popular belief, a change in the color or the characteristic of the nasal discharge is not a specific sign of a bacterial infection. [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] After a few days of a viral infection, mucopurulent nasal secretions may occur because of an influx of neutrophils. The point at which a viral URI becomes super- infected with pathogenic bacteria can only be determined with repeated sinus aspiration studies. Sinus aspiration studies in adults demonstrate significant bacterial growth in approximately 60% of patients with URI symptoms lasting at least 10 days. 27 The risk that bacterial superinfection has occurred is greater if the illness is no better or worse after 10 days. Because there may be cases that fall out of the \"norm\" of this typical progression and have specific findings suggesting bacterial infection (fever, facial erythema, swelling, and severe pain), practicing clinicians need to rely on clinical judgment when using these guidelines. In general, however, a diagnosis of ABRS may be made in adults or children with a viral URI that is no better after 10 days or worsens after 5 to 7 days and is accompanied by some or all of the following symptoms: nasal drainage, nasal congestion, facial pressure/pain (especially when unilateral and focused in the region of a particular sinus), postnasal drainage, hyposmia/anosmia, fever, cough, fatigue, maxillary dental pain, and ear pressure/fullness (Table 1) .",

Unlike acute otitis media, in which the tympanic membrane and middle ear space are readily available for direct examination, the paranasal sinuses are hidden deep within the skull. Anterior rhinoscopy (with or without topical decongestant) allows examination of the mucosa of the inferior turbinate, secretions within the anterior nose, and the orientation of the nasal septum. Fiberoptic endoscopy allows visualization of the middle meatus, and direct culture of purulence in this region may correlate with cultures from maxillary sinus aspirates. 28, 29 Endoscopy, however, is not necessary in uncomplicated cases of ABRS. Transillumination has a 60% and 90% reproducibility rate for assessing disease within the maxillary sinuses and the frontal sinuses, respectively, but this does not differentiate bacterial from viral infection. 30 B-mode ultrasound has replaced A-mode ultrasound for the diagnosis of diseases within the paranasal sinuses. However, because only the maxillary sinus can be adequately assessed, B-mode ultrasound has limited utility. A study correlating CT scan and B-mode ultrasound findings demonstrated a sensitivity for ultrasound of 72.8% for the maxillary sinuses, 23.1% for the frontal sinuses, and 11.3% for the ethmoids. 31 Compared with clinical evaluation, the sensitivity of B-mode ultrasound was 36% and the specificity was 90%. 32 Because ultrasound is technique-sensitive, there may be marked variations in the reliability of the information provided. 33 Ultrasound cannot distinguish between viral and bacterial rhinosinusitis. Plain film radiographs primarily reveal pathologic findings in the maxillary and frontal sinuses, whereas the ethmoids are poorly visualized. Additionally, plain radiographs are imprecise at determining the extent of disease. 34 A meta-analysis of 6 studies demonstrated that positive plain film radiographs have moderate sensitivity (76%) and specificity (79%) compared with maxillary sinus puncture. 7 A negative radiograph has more diagnostic value than either a negative clinical examination or ultrasound. CT scans clearly demonstrate abnormalities within the sinuses. However, as previously noted, abnormalities are frequently found on CT scans of patients with viral respiratory disease. 3 MRI scans, without exposing patients to ionizing radiation, distinctly reveal mucosal thickening and fluid within the paranasal sinuses. In patients with maxillary sinusitis, serial MRI scans demonstrate mucosal thickening persisting for up to 8 weeks. 35 CT and MRI scans are not indicated in uncomplicated cases of ABRS but are appropriate for cases with complications or those in which a serious problem may be suspected.",

            "text": "Bacteria are broadly classified into groups based on their cell wall composition, morphologic characteristics, and metabolic requirements. The cell wall, an important determinant of inherent susceptibility or resistance for any bacterium to many antimicrobial agents, consists primarily of proteins, lipids, and a peptidoglycan layer. The peptidoglycan layer is composed of oligosaccharide chains cross-linked by short peptides that serve as the major structural component for maintaining cell wall integrity. Although gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria share many common structural elements in their cell walls, the organization and content of these elements vary between these two bacterial classes ( Figure 2 ). The cell wall of gram-positive bacteria consists almost entirely of a thick peptidoglycan layer fused to the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane. Gram-negative bacteria, however, have cell walls composed of a hydrophobic lipopolysaccharide capsule surrounding a lipoprotein-phospholipid membrane that contains small channels called porins. A thin peptidoglycan layer lies between the outer membrane and the inner cytoplasmic membrane. These two biologic layers are separated by the periplasmic space. This space is an important site for degradation of antibiotics by drug inactivating enzymes, such as \u03b2-lactamases, in gramnegative bacteria. Penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), enzymes essential for cell wall synthesis, are located in the cytoplasmic membrane. PBPs are found in gram- negative and gram-positive organisms. Altered PBPs, which have decreased affinity for \u03b2-lactams, have been identified in a variety of organisms. The most common bacterial isolates recovered from the maxillary sinuses of patients with ABRS are S pneumoniae, H influenzae, other streptococcal species, and M catarrhalis. A review of sinus aspiration studies that have been performed in adults with ABRS have shown that S pneumoniae is isolated in approximately 20% to 43%, H influenzae in 22% to 35%, and M catarrhalis in 2% to 10% of aspirates ( Figure 3 ). 1, 27, [36] [37] [38] In children with ABRS, S pneumoniae is isolated in approximately 35% to 42%, whereas H influenzae and M catarrhalis are each recovered from about 21% to 28% of aspirates. Streptococcus pyogenes and anaerobes account for 3% to 7% ( Figure 4 ). 27, 36, 37, 39, 40 Other bacterial isolates found in patients with ABRS include S aureus and anaerobes. 27, 36, 37 ",

Tests such as the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimal bactericidal Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery S10 SINUS AND ALLERGY HEALTH PARTNERSHIP July 2000 concentration (MBC) or minimum lethal concentration, and time-kill testing are valid methods for the assessment of antimicrobial activity. It is, however, important to understand the usefulness and limitations of each of these tests. Antimicrobial activity is commonly evaluated by determining the MIC of a particular antibiotic against a specific bacterial strain ( Figure 5 ). Therefore, if an MIC is reported as 2 \u00b5g/mL, the true inhibitory concentration is somewhere between >1 \u00b5g/mL and 2 \u00b5g/mL. Two other terms used are MIC 50 , the MIC that inhibits 50% of the isolates tested, and MIC 90 , the MIC that inhibits 90% of the isolates tested. It is extremely important to remember that the MIC is an in vitro characteristic of the antimicrobial and is determined under strictly adhered to conditions. Because the environmental conditions at the site of infection rarely correspond to in vitro susceptibility test conditions, effects of elements such as oxygen tension, pH, and protein binding on the activity of the antimicrobial of interest need to be considered. For example, low pH can have a significantly detrimental effect on the activity of the macrolides. Therefore, even if an organism appears susceptible in vitro, clinical failure may occur if in vivo conditions detract from the activity of the drug. Similarly, some host factors may actually serve to improve the in vivo activity of an antimicrobial. Macrophages, opsonic factors, and complement may all act synergistically with an antibiotic and thus provide enhanced antibacterial activity over that which would be predicted in vitro. Additionally, many bacterial infections resolve spontaneously without the use of antimicrobial agents.",

MBC values generally range from 0 to 2 doubling dilutions higher than MIC values. Because MICs are better standardized, less costly, and less labor intensive, they are used more often than are MBCs.

For the antimicrobial with a short half-life, the duration of time between the drug concentration falling below the MIC and its total elimination from the body is relatively short compared with that of the antimicrobial with the longer half-life. For an antimicrobial with a 68-hour half-life (eg, azithromycin), total elimination from the body does not occur for 5 to 7 half-lives, or 14 to 20 days. This period of subinhibitory concentrations of drug may be the pharmacodynamic explanation for the aforementioned observations. This concept is controversial and requires validation in future studies.",

In fact, in most fluoroquinolone dose fractionation studies, the AUC/MIC ratio has a better correlation with efficacy than peak to MIC ratio. Data obtained from several sources, including animal models of sepsis, in vitro pharmacodynamic experiments, and clinical outcome studies, indicate that the magnitude of the AUC/MIC ratio can be used to predict response. Forrest et al 82 demonstrated that an AUC/MIC ratio of \u2265125 was associated with the highest bacterial eradication rates in the treatment of infections caused by gram-negative enteric pathogens. However, for gram-positive bacteria, it appears that effective AUC/MIC ratios can be appreciably lower. For instance, against S pneumoniae an in vitro model of infection demonstrated that for levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin an AUC/MIC ratio of approximately 30 was associated with a 4-log reduction in bacterial titers; whereas ratios less than 30 were associated with significantly reduced rates of bacterial killing and in some instances bacterial regrowth. 83 Similarly, Lister and Sanders 84 reported that for levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin an AUC to MIC ratio of 32 to 44 was associated with maximal eradication of S pneumoniae in an in vitro model of infection. These observations are supported by data from nonneutropenic animal models of infection in which survival was associated with an AUC/MIC ratio of 25 to 30 against the pneumococcus. 85",

Two of the most important factors are the drug exposure seen in a patient and how susceptible the offending pathogen is to the antiinfective agent selected for therapy. Unfortunately, the major limitation of the type of pharmacodynamic analysis described above is that variability in pharmacokinetic and microbiologic data are not accounted for. Both of these factors are highly variable. The variability in susceptibility is tracked by differences in MIC. Consequently, large collections of target organisms give the clinician a reasonable idea of the distribution of susceptibility to the drug among the pathogen(s) they care about.",

            "text": "These differing drug exposures would be therapeutically adequate for differing MICs and differing organisms. For instance, for pneumococcus, in which the target AUC/MIC ratio is approximately 30, essentially all patients would have adequate coverage, with a 500-mg dose producing the target AUC/MIC for MICs as high as 1.0 g/mL. For P aeruginosa, in which the pharmacodynamic target is 100 to 125, a substantial fraction of patients would not hit the target if the MIC was 1.0 g/mL or greater. For some patients, this target AUC/ MIC ratio could only be achieved if the organism had an MIC of 0.25 g/mL or less. For patients with a low plasma clearance, relatively high AUCs would result and patients would have adequate coverage for a organism with a higher MIC. \"Monte Carlo\" simulation is a way to take the variability seen in patients and microbiologic data into account when choosing a dose and schedule of an antibiotic. In Monte Carlo simulation, prior knowledge is used about the handling of a drug in a population of patients. This can be done by using the mean values for the pharmacokinetic parameters and also providing the covariance matrix for the parameters. The covariance matrix provides information about the variability of the pharmacokinetic parameters in the population and how they covary with one another. A Monte Carlo simulation program randomly samples from the population of patients described by the mean parameters and the covariance matrix. The program can be directed to perform the sampling a large number of times (eg, 1000 to 10,000 times). In this way, a population of simulated patients can be created. By using a large number of simulated patients, an accurate estimate can be developed of how often a patient whose plasma clearance is 2 L/h (AUC = 250 for a 500-mg dose of levofloxacin) will be encountered and how often a subject with a plasma clearance of 17 L/h (AUC approximately 30 for a 500-mg dose) will be encountered. At each value of the MIC, it is possible to determine how frequently the therapeutic target for the simulated population of patients is attained. The FDA advisory committee on anti-infective drug products found this method, as presented by Drusano, to be a reasonable approach in October 1998. A pharmacodynamic analysis conducted by some members of this panel 86 on H influenzae isolates, used the Monte Carlo method described by Ambrose and Grasela. 86 Data used for this analysis included human pharmacokinetic data obtained from FDA licensing trials and susceptibility data from 901 isolates collected in the United States during 1999. From this analysis and that of Jacobs et al, 55 oral \u03b2-lactams may be indexed as follows: cefixime = cefpodoxime proxetil = amoxicillin/clavulanate (high dose) > cefuroxime axetil > amoxicillin > cefprozil = loracarbef > cefaclor.",

For the fluoroquinolones and azithromycin, the PK/PD breakpoints can be based on the AUC/MIC ratio exceeding 25 to 30. Table 5 compares the susceptibility of isolates of S pneumoniae, H influenzae, and M catarrhalis to various antibiotics according to their PK/PD breakpoints. 56 The panel used PK/PD breakpoints in preference to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards 87 or FDA breakpoints to allow unbiased comparisons of sinusitis pathogens using one breakpoint for each agent. Current NCCLS breakpoints for the same agents vary considerably by pathogen. For example, the susceptible cefprozil breakpoint is \u22648 \u00b5g/ml for Haemophilus but is Table 6 (continued). Footnotes. 1 The terms mild and moderate are designed to aid the clinician in an antibiotic choice. Differences in severity of disease do not imply presence or absence of antimicrobial resistance. Rather, this terminology indicates the relative degree of acceptance of possible failure of therapy. The determination of the severity of disease rests on the clinician's evaluation of the patient's history and clinical presentation. Severe, life-threatening infection, with or without complications, is not addressed in these guidelines. 2 Prior antibiotic therapy within the past 4 to 6 weeks is a risk factor for infection with resistant organisms. Antibiotic choices need to be based on this risk factor. 3 Bacterial efficacy (microbiologic adequacy) is the mean and range of 3 sets of calculations from the Poole therapeutic outcome model using 3 susceptibility data bases: the US component of the 1998 Alexander Project, 1998 Sentry surveillance, and the 1998 CDC Active Bacterial Core Surveillance Report. These values do not guarantee clinical success or failure. 4 These values, which reflect the potential for therapeutic failure of initial therapy, are based on the US component of the Alexander Project 1998 surveillance study. Use of local surveillance data can provide valuable additional information on the prevalence of resistance applicable to a region. 5 When a change in antibiotic therapy is made, the clinician needs to take into account the limitations in coverage of the initial antibiotic. Amoxicillin lacks complete H influenzae coverage; cefuroxime and cefpodoxime do not cover penicillin-resistant S pneumoniae. Erythromycin, doxycycline, and TMP/SMX have limited coverage for both H influenzae and S pneumoniae. Amoxicillin/clavulanate, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin currently have the best coverage for both H influenzae and S pneumoniae. 6 Reevaluation is necessary because the antibiotics recommended at day 0 (initial therapy) are effective against S pneumoniae and H influenzae. Additional history, physical examination, cultures, and/or CT scan may be indicated and the possibility of other less common pathogens considered. 7 The total daily dose of amoxicillin and the amoxicillin component of amoxicillin/clavulanate can vary from 1.5 to 3.5 g/day. Lower daily doses (1.5 to 2 g/day) are more appropriate in mild disease in patients with no prior antibiotic use. Higher daily doses (3 to 3.5 g/day) may be advantageous in areas with a high prevalence of DRSP and in patients with moderate disease or who have had recent prior antibiotic use. There is a greater potential for treatment failure or resistant pathogens in these patient groups. These higher doses are currently not approved by the FDA in the United States and formal safety studies have not been published. 8 Although cefpodoxime and cefixime have excellent activity against H influenzae, they are not active against penicillin-resistant S pneumoniae. 9 Clindamycin provides excellent coverage for S pneumoniae but has no activity against H influenzae. 10 These antibiotics are not recommended unless the patient is allergic to \u03b2-lactam. Their effectiveness against the major pathogens of ABRS is limited, and bacterial failure of 20% to 25% is possible. Life-threatening toxic epidermal necrolysis has been associated with the use of TMP/SMX. 11 Based on in vitro spectrum of activity, combination therapy with amoxicillin (3.5 g/day) or clindamycin for gram-positive coverage plus cefixime for gram-negative coverage is suggested/recommended. There is no clinical evidence at this time, however, of the safety or efficacy of these combinations. 12 \u03b2-Lactams should be considered initially. A fluoroquinolone is recommended for patients who have allergies or intolerance to \u03b2-lactams or who have recently not responded to other regimens of therapy. ",

The healthy patient with 10 days of persistent anterior and posterior rhinorrhea, and fatigue (mild disease) is different from the patient with 10 days of nasal congestion who over the past 3 days has developed a low-grade elevation of temperature and increasing unilateral maxillary or frontal tenderness that worsens with bending over (moderate disease). Patients, however, may not always be neatly categorized into degrees of disease. An evaluation of the severity of the disease requires clinical judgment gained only by the clinician familiar with the patient. The differences in severity of disease do not imply the presence or absence of antimicrobial resistance. Rather, this terminology indicates the relative degree of acceptance of possible failure of therapy. Severe, life-threatening infec- 1 The terms mild and moderate are designed to aid the clinician in an antibiotic choice. Differences in severity of disease do not imply presence or absence of antimicrobial resistance. Rather, this terminology indicates the relative degree of acceptance of possible failure of therapy. The determination of the severity of disease rests on the clinician's evaluation of the patient's history and clinical presentation. Severe, life-threatening infection, with or without complications, is not addressed in these guidelines. 2 Prior antibiotic therapy within the past 4 to 6 weeks is a risk factor for infection with resistant organisms. Antibiotic choices need to be based on this risk factor. 3 Bacterial efficacy (microbiologic adequacy) is the mean and range of 3 sets of calculations from the Poole therapeutic outcome model (see text), using 3 susceptibility databases: the US component of the 1998 Alexander Project, 1998 Sentry surveillance, and the 1998 CDC Active Bacterial Core Surveillance Report. These values do not guarantee clinical success or failure. 4 These values reflect the potential for therapeutic failure of initial therapy are based on the US component of the Alexander Project 1998 surveillance study. Use of local surveillance data can provide valuable additional information on the prevalence of resistance applicable to a region. 5 When a change in antibiotic therapy is made, the clinician needs to take into account the limitations in coverage of the initial antibiotic. Amoxicillin lacks complete H influenzae and M catarrhalis coverage; cefuroxime and cefpodoxime do not cover penicillin-resistant S pneumoniae. Erythromycin and TMP/SMX have limited coverage for both H influenzae and S pneumoniae. Amoxicillin/clavulanate currently has the best coverage for S pneumoniae, H influenzae, and M catarrhalis. 6 Reevaluation is necessary because the antibiotics recommended at day 0 are effective against S pneumoniae, H influenzae, and M catarrhalis. Additional history, physical examination, cultures, and/or CT scan may be indicated and the possibility of other less common pathogens considered. 7a The dose of amoxicillin can range from 45 mg to 90 mg/kg per day. If lower doses of amoxicillin are used initially, treatment failure may be due to DRSP or \u03b2-lactamase-positive H influenzae or M catarrhalis. The higher dose schedule gives better DRSP coverage. 7b The amoxicillin component of amoxicillin/clavulanate also ranges from 45 mg to 90 mg/kg per day. The higher daily dose (80 to 90 mg/kg per day) may be advantageous in areas with a high prevalence of DRSP and for patients with moderate disease or who have had recent prior antibiotic use. There is a greater potential for treatment failure or resistant pathogens in these patient groups. These higher doses are currently not approved by the FDA in the United States. 8 Although cefpodoxime proxetil, cefuroxime axetil, and cefixime have higher activity against H influenzae and M catarrhalis than amoxicillin, they are not active against penicillin-resistant S pneumoniae. 9 Excluding \u03b2-lactams, clindamycin is the most active oral agent currently available with activity against 89% to 95% of S pneumoniae. It has no activity, however, against H influenzae or M catarrhalis. 10 Based on in vitro spectrum of activity, combination therapy (amoxicillin [80 to 90 mg/kg per day] or clindamycin) for grampositive coverage plus cefixime, cefpodoxime proxetil, or TMP/SMX for gram-negative coverage is suggested/recommended. There is no clinical evidence at this time, however, of the safety or efficacy of these combinations. 11 These antibiotics are not recommended unless the patient is \u03b2-lactam allergic. Their effectiveness against the major pathogens of ABRS is limited, and bacterial failure of 20% to 25% is possible. In addition, TMP/SMX is associated with increases in the risk of life threatening toxic epidermal necrolysis. The clinician should differentiate an immediate hypersensitivity reaction from other less dangerous side effects. Children with immediate hypersensitivity reactions to \u03b2-lactams may need desensitization, sinus cultures, or other ancillary procedures and studies. Children with other types of reactions and side effects may tolerate one specific \u03b2-lactam but not another. tion with or without complications is not addressed in these guidelines. Prior antibiotic use is a major risk factor associated with the development of infection from antimicrobialresistant strains. Other risk factors include age less than 5 years and attendance in day care centers. Risk factors for invasive infection include prior \u03b2-lactam use, residence in nursing homes or recent hospitalization, hematologic malignancy or serious comorbid illness, and immunosuppressive underlying disease. Prior use of TMP/SMX has also been identified as a risk factor for carriage of penicillin-nonsusceptible S pneumoniae. [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] Because recent antimicrobial exposure increases the risk of carriage and infection from resistant organisms, antimicrobial therapy should be based on the patient's history of recent antibiotic use. The panel's guidelines, therefore, stratify patients according to antibiotic exposure in the previous 4 to 6 weeks.",

Because S pneumoniae is the more pathogenic bacterial organism, the model incorporates a higher prevalence of S pneumoniae in children to ensure appropriate antimicrobial coverage. For each of the major pathogens, the spontaneous resolution rate was estimated from published data in which placebo was used in otitis media. The values used in this model were 30% for S pneumoniae, 60% for H influenzae, 80% for M catarrhalis, and 50% for other pathogens.

However, if a drug with 100% bacteriologic efficacy were to be used, the disease will theoretically resolve in all of the adult patients in the infected group and in 95% of all adult patients. Thus the theoretical disease resolution rates in the adults in this model, depending on efficacy of treatment, can vary from 46.6% (the rate from spontaneous resolution) to 100% (for patients treated with an antimicrobial with 100% bacterial efficacy). For the total adult group, these limits vary from 63% (untreated) to 95% (using agent with 100% efficacy). On the other hand, spontaneous resolution will occur in 49.6% of untreated children in the bacterially infected group and 64.8% of the untreated total pediatric patient group. Importantly, the individual values of the various parameters are estimates. Interested investigators could change any value and use the model to calculate the resulting effect on bacteriologic and clinical outcome. The next step was to calculate the resolution of disease based on current susceptibility data for each organism at PK/PD breakpoints. Agents with poor activity against all pathogens will result in resolution rates similar to the spontaneous resolution seen in the untreated group, whereas agents active against all pathogens will result in higher resolution rates. Resolution rates for the bacterially infected group and the total patient group (using the mean susceptibility data from the US component of the 1998 Alexander Project, the 1998 SENTRY Surveillance Report, and the 1998 CDC Active Bacterial Core Surveillance Report) are shown in Marchant plots (Figures 12 and  13) . 56, 58, 95 These datasets were used because complete MIC distributions were available and the proportion of isolates inhibited at PK/PD breakpoints could be determined. The outcomes of these calculations are shown as Marchant plots showing predicted bacteriologic outcomes in the bacterial infection group and the total patient group. The Marchant plot is only a relative rank order for the data used. Other surveillance data may therefore alter this relative rank order. These resolution rates are based on in vitro microbiologic efficacy and do not guarantee clinical outcome. However, in the absence of microbiologic outcome data from clinical studies for most agents, this model was used as the best method available for predicting clinical outcome.",
