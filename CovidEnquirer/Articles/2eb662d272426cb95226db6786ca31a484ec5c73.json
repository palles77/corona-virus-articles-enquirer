Entry of a virus into the specific host cell depends on the precise attachment or fitting of the viral surface molecules with the molecules of the host cell. Each viral strain is unique in its surface antigenic structure, host cell receptors, and life cycle, and thus adopts various invasion strategies to infect every form of life.

            "text": "Thus, the development of antiviral drugs requires great efforts. Several reports on the discovery of new drugs from traditional medicines [7e12] indicated the use of medicinal plants as a potential source for antiviral drug development [1,7e9] . Several reports indicated that a wide variety of phytochemicals, including alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenoids, polyphenolics, coumarins, lignans, have therapeutic applications [4e12] due to their interferences on viral entry or replication, along with their antioxidative properties [6, 9, 13] . Different in vitro and in vivo bioassays on phytochemicals lead to the identification of potential antiviral molecules. In this chapter, we will summarize the scientific approaches used to validate potential \"antiviral leads\" against selected genetically and functionally diverse viral families, from crude extracts to pure compounds. In-depth studies on some common in vitro antiviral assays with testing of efficacies, modes, and molecular mechanisms of action will be described here with in vivo methods against a few selected viruses. Viral infection control strategies include (1) public health measures to minimize the risk of infection, (2) vaccination to the exposed individuals, and (3) antiinfective drugs for infected individuals. Public health measures such as safe drinking water can prevent Polio and Rota virus infections, while pest control can prevent arthropod and rodent-borne yellow fever, dengue, encephalitis, and hanta and arena viruses. However, to provide these benefits to the people of underdeveloped and developing world is a challenge. A second challenge is to discover means to control airborne respiratory infections. As public health measures are never totally effective, vaccination is a second strategy. Although vaccines dramatically decreased the incidence of polio, yellow fever, rabies, measles, mumps, rubella, and hepatitis B, they are not yet effective in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), influenza, including common cold, caused by 100 \u00fe strains of Rhinoviruses. Developing a polyvalent vaccine against all these viruses is also a challenge. Moreover, Alpha and Filovirus (Ebola) cause devastating epidemics with sporadic outbreaks, and it is difficult to vaccinate the entire population to eradicate them. Thus, infection can and will occur despite the best effort of humankind. Hence, for antiviral drug development, scientists are looking into the features of an ideal antiviral drug that (1) effectively inhibits some essential viral processes, (2) prevents the development of drugresistant viruses, (3) has broad activity (single drug against any of the 100 \u00fe common cold viruses), and (4) has minimum or no effect on the host system. The first feature is obvious while the remaining depend on the viral process being targeted.",

Moreover, several viral diseases require long-term treatment that usually leads to the development of drug-resistant viruses. The existing antiviral nucleoside analogs act as antimetabolites in DNA synthesis and prevent viral replication in infected cells, and the related nucleotide analogs are used against hepatitis B virus (HBV), HCV, HSV, and HIV. In infected cells, these analogs are incorporated into the replicating DNA strand and phosphorylated as a chain terminator to stop viral DNA polymerase activity, and affect the mitochondrial DNA, leading to adverse effects such as bone marrow suppression. Another family of synthetic nucleoside analog reverse-transcriptase (RT) inhibitors help to design drugs with preferential activity, while some nucleoside analogs can act as nucleoside analog reversetranscriptase inhibitors and polymerase inhibitors for HBV. Thus, antiviral nucleotides analogs repress viral reproduction by interfering with viral nucleic acid replication, compete with natural deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTP)/NTP substrates, and incorporate into the nascent viral nucleic acid leading to chain termination or mutagenesis (Table 8.1) .",

            "text": "Despite continuous advancement in medical science, viral diseases are a major cause of death around the globe. The development of an antiviral drug depends on the unique features of hostevirus interactions, as viruses are acellular and host-and route-specific, and infect only by their nucleic acid(s) that regulate the host cell DNA for multiplication. Being an obligate intracellular parasite, viral replication depends on the metabolic pathways of the host. Thus, designing an effective antiviral drug to target virus-specific enzymes or replication steps without affecting the host cell is very difficult [20] . Advancement in molecular biology and genetics helps to design a rational approach for developing antiviral agents by targeting specific sites/steps of the viral life cycle, including (1) inactivation of the extracellular virus particles, (2) prevention of viral attachment or fusion, (3) entry or penetration, (4) replication of viral genome, (5) synthesis of viral-specific proteins or intermediates, and (6) assembly or release of new virions. However, the most desirable target is the inhibition of major viral enzymes essential for replication and spread of the disease. Most of the wellstudied inhibitors of HIV, HSV, or Influenza viruses target the host cell binding (T-20, betulinic acid), uncoating of capsid (amantadine, pleconaril), viral replication (RT inhibitors: zidovudine, abacavir, nevirapine), viral enzymes integrase or DNA/RNA polymerase (acyclovir, cidofovir, ribavirin), proteinases of polyprotein precursors, and assembly or maturation (indinavir, ritonavir, rimantadine). On the basis of these strategies, several compounds were tested on different viruses, but only 40 licensed antivirals are approved till 2014 [1, 5] . Moreover, studies on viral genomics, gene functions, and regulations led to the rational designing of genebased drugs that induce protective antiviral immunity, interference with viral replication, gene expression, or viral messenger RNAs with limited delivery to the sites of replication and nuclease degradation [13] .",

Thus, there has been a huge upsurge in the use of natural products for preventing and treating serious viral diseases. However, most herbal products have no quality control, are unable to provide consistent results, and even produce undesirable effects. About 40% of the modern-day anticancer and antimicrobial drugs have their roots in traditional medicine [4, 5, 20] , but till 2014, we have barely analyzed the tip of iceberg to design more drugs from plants. Hence, it is of utmost importance to search for phytochemicals with antiviral potential from unexplored plants used in ethnomedicine, before we lose our herbal resources due to rapid anthropogenic activities including industrialization and urbanization [1, 8] .",

During the past 40 years, numerous broad-based screening programs for the antiviral activity of medicinal plants have been initiated using in vitro and in vivo assays. Out of 100 British Colombian medicinal plants, only a few showed activities against corona viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), para influenza, and HSV [22] , while the marine algae Spirulina showed antimutagenic, immunomodulatory, and antiviral activities [23, 24] . Interestingly, Cyanovirin N, an 11-kDa protein of blue green algae, inactivates HIV-1 by binding with its glycoprotein120 [25] , while sulfated polysaccharides of seaweeds and alga showed anti-HIV and anti-HSV activities [26] . A list of selected medicinal plants and their compounds having antiviral activities against common viral diseases is presented in Table 8 .3, and the structures of some important compounds are depicted in Figure 8 .1.",

This initial evaluation is usually done at a twofold concentration (with a 10-fold difference, e.g., 1 and 10 ng/ml or mg/ml). An 18 h culture (80e90% confluency) of an appropriate cell line should be added with the test drug or placebo, immediately after the virus infection. When the drug effect was tested as pretreatment, cells need to be treated with the test drug for 15e180 min before virus infection, and incubated Here, the uninfected cell monolayer treated with the test drug will provide an idea of the maximum dose of drug causing minimum cell toxicity, as enlargement, granularity, rounding off, detachment, etc., and the degree of cytotoxicity as T (100% toxic), PVH (partially very heavy toxic, 80%), PH (partially heavy toxic, 60%), P (partial toxic 40%), PS (partial slightly toxic, 20%), or 0 (nontoxic, 0%). A 50% cell inhibitory or cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) and 50% end point of virus inhibitory or effective concentration (EC 50 ) can be determined from a graph plotted with the concentration versus cellular effect due to virus infection, while the selectivity or therapeutic index (SI or TI) is calculated as CC 50 /EC 50 .",

The mechanism is based on the conversion of a yellow water-soluble dye MTT or MTS to a purple colored insoluble formazan crystal by the mitochondrial enzymes of the viable cells. The quantitation of the amount of formazan produced in each well is then determined spectrophotometrically at 490 nm, and the same is subtracted from the background absorption of the plate at 650 nm. The cytotoxicity of the test drug needs to be evaluated in the same plate, and for data analysis, a statistical software program is used to determine the efficacy (EC 50 ), cell toxicity (CC 50 ), and SI or TI of the test drug. This method allowed the screening of a larger number of extract/compounds at the same time with a simplified procedure.",

TZM-bl cells are HeLa cell clones, engineered to express cluster of differentiation 4 and CeC chemokine receptor type 5, and contain integrated reporter genes for firefly luciferase and Escherichia coli b-galactosidase under the control of an HIV-1 long terminal repeat. Thus, they are highly sensitive and prone to infection by immunodeficiency viruses including primary HIV-1 isolates and cloned Env-pseudotyped viruses. Here, diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) dextran is used to enhance infectivity during neutralization. Soon after infection, reporter gene expression is induced by a viral transactivator protein Tat. Luciferase activity can be quantified by luminescence and is directly proportional to the number of infectious virus particles present in the initial inoculum [85] . This high-throughput assay requires a 96-well plate, and clonal cells provide enhanced precision and uniformity. This has been validated for a single-round infection with either uncloned viruses grown in human lymphocytes or molecularly cloned Env-pseudotyped viruses produced by transfection in 293T/17 cells [85] .",

The cells are washed with PBS (2X), and the quantity of the cell pack (2.0 ml blood yields 0.5e1.0 ml pack) is measured in 10% suspension with PBS. The RBC solution (0.75%) in PBS (0.75 ml 10% RBCs in 10 ml PBS, pH 7.2) is added to each well of a 96-well plate, except for the first well of each row, along with the antigen (culture fluid containing virus from drug-treated and untreated controls) to the first two wells of each row. A twofold dilution (transferring 50 ml from the second well of each column A2-K2 to A3-K3) is mixed with 0.75% RBCs (50 ml) in all wells, and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. The cell control needs to be checked for the complete settling of the RBCs, and the results are recorded in the HA sheet. The RBCs form a button or ring at the bottom of the wells that is recorded as \"O,\" while hemagglutination (RBCs remain in suspension) is recorded as a \u00fe symbol. The highest dilution of virus that causes complete hemagglutination is considered as the end point. The HA titer is the reciprocal of the dilution of the virus in the last well with complete hemagglutination (Figure 8.4) .",

Amplification of target DNA and detection of PCR products are performed with a GeneAmp1 5700 Sequence Detection System. Amplification of the target sequence is detected by an increase in fluorescence above a baseline with no or little change in fluorescence. To analyze the data, the reporter fluorescence is automatically normalized to a passive reference to avoid the measurement of non-PCR-related fluorescence [94] . A threshold is set above the baseline to get a threshold cycle value (Ct), which is the cycle number at which the fluorescence passes the fixed threshold with a statistically significant increase in fluorescence.

Gel shift assays are often performed to study transcription initiation, DNA replication, DNA repair, or RNA processing and maturation. Here, an oligonucleotide sequence (5 0 -GCATGCTAATGA-TATTCTTTG-3 0 ) of the promoter gene of a virus (e.g., ICP0 of HSV) is biotinylated by a Biotin 3 0 end DNA labeling kit. The nuclear extracts of virus-infected cells treated with the test drug for the indicated time are mixed with reaction mixtures (20 ml) containing 3 mg of nuclear extracts, 20 fmol of Biotin 3 0 end-labeled probe, 50 ng/ml of poly (dI-dC), 2.5% glycerol, 0.05% NP-40 (1%), 5 mM MgCl 2 , and 1X binding buffer. After incubation for 20 min at room temperature, reaction mixtures are applied to 4% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5X Tris-borate-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid buffer at 4 C, and the gels are transferred to Nylon membranes using a Semi Dry Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad, USA). The transferred oligos are then immobilized by ultraviolet crosslinking for 10 min. For detection of bound oligos, membranes are blocked with blocking buffer, followed by the addition of StreptavidineHorseradish Peroxidase conjugate and developed according to the manufacturer's instructions. For supershift assays, nuclear extracts are preincubated with host cell factor-1 polyclonal antibodies for 30 min on ice [9, 10] .",

Usually, HSV-1 is associated with orolabialis, keratitis, and encephalitis, whereas HSV-2 is associated with genital herpes [98] , and both are transmitted through close personal contact [99] . HSV can hide from the immune attack of the host by latency and reactivate frequently to cause recurrent episodes [100] . Moreover, HSV-2 is a high risk factor for acquisition of HIV infection [101, 102] . A recent report showed that HSV-suppressive therapy can greatly reduce HIV-1 load in persons coinfected with HSV [103] . Moreover, the determinants of effective immunity against HSV infection are not yet identified [104, 105] , and therapeutic vaccines failed to provide protection from infection or recurrences [104] . Hence, broad spectrum antiviral(s) of natural origin is an important strategy for the management of HSV infection. Thus, any agent that showed anti-HSV activity is usually tested for toxicity along with a skin irritation test to determine its acceptability for topical application, while in vivo efficacy studies are performed by developing cutaneous, vaginal, ocular (Figure 8.6) , and latency associated infection models, when required.",

The virus establishes latency and reactivates [109] . Successful inoculation (100%) of eyes on day 7 will produce herpetic dendritic ulcers with significant HSV-1 titer (10 4 pfu/ml) and viral shedding, determined by a neutralization test. After satisfactory anesthesia, the globe is proptosed with a wooden cotton applicator and an operating microscope for all surgical manipulations. The intrastromal injection (0.25-ml tuberculin syringe with a no. 30 short bevel needle) is given into the central corneal stroma. The first group is given deionized sterile endotoxin-free water; the second group is given 100 ml air, while the 3rd group is not given any injection. For all three groups, the needle should be carefully withdrawn with gentle pressure so that the proptosed globe gently returns to the orbit. The anterior chamber, injected with deionized sterile water, is made at the limbus, inserted into the anterior chamber parallel to the iris plane. The needle is carefully withdrawn, and the insertion site is pressed with a cotton swab for 30 s, to avoid aqueous loss, and return of the proptosed globe to its proper place in the orbit. For topical administration, 100 ml deionized sterile water is administered onto the cornea of the proptosed globe by means of a pipette, and the globe returns to the orbit by gentle digital pressure. Viral Shedding (latent HSV-1 after reactivation and induced shedding into the tear film) is determined by swabbing the eyes 2 days before treatment and for seven consecutive days after the treatment. Each eye swab is mixed with 0.3 ml MEM (Eagle's medium with Earle's salt, 10% newborn calf serum, 1% penicillinestreptomycin, 1% Fungizone), vortexed, and the eluant is plated onto a Vero cell monolayer. After a 1-h adsorption, 1.5 ml of medium is added to the well, and the plate is examined daily for 7 days for the CPE of HSV-1. Random HSV-1 isolates can be confirmed by neutralization [108, 110] .",

As in the footpad model, latent HSV genomes express LAT in a portion of those neurons maintaining them, and the virus can be recovered by cocultivation of the explanted ganglia. Interestingly, this method is similar to an in vivo method. Here, latently infected mice are transiently exposed to hyperthermia, and then trigeminal ganglia are excised, sectioned, and assayed for the presence of observable virus by immunohistochemistry or genetic engineering (when recombinant virus with an expressible marker in the genome is used).",

The currently available antivirals, though effective, are costly and beyond the reach of a vast majority of people. Thus, the development of safe, effective, and low cost antiviral drugs such as RT inhibitors is among the top priorities, as many viruses are not yet curable and have high mortality rates. Recently, considerable work has been done on medicinal plants focusing on anti-HIV activity [119e122], and there has been a considerable rise in the use of over-the-counter plant products containing orthodox drugs. The rationale is to reduce the side effects and to produce synergistic effects. But since in most cases pharmacological mechanisms of the combinations are not studied, adverse effects or therapeutic failures have been observed [123] . The most important consideration involving medicinal plants is to identify and standardize the method of preparation of extract, appropriate season of collecting plant material, and details of its administration [20, 124] . Since a significant number of plant extracts has yielded positive results, it seems reasonable to conclude that there are probably many potential antiviral agents, and further characterization of active ingredients of those potential plants will reveal useful compounds.",
