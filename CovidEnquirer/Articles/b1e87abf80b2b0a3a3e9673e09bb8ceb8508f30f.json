In Cuba, the presence of BCoV was first reported in 2006. Since then, sporadic outbreaks have continued to occur. This study was aimed at deepening the knowledge of the evolution, molecular markers of virulence and epidemiology of BCoV in Cuba. A total of 30 samples collected between 2009 and 2011 were used for PCR amplification and direct sequencing of partial or full S gene. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic studies were conducted using partial or complete S gene sequences as phylogenetic markers. All Cuban bovine coronavirus sequences were located in a single cluster supported by 100% bootstrap and 1.00 posterior probability values. The Cuban bovine coronavirus sequences were also clustered with the USA BCoV strains corresponding to the GenBank accession numbers EF424621 and EF424623, suggesting a common origin for these viruses. This phylogenetic cluster was also the only group of sequences in which no recombination events were detected. Of the 45 amino acid changes found in the Cuban strains, four were unique.",

Although the affected animals rarely die, coronavirus infection causes dramatic reductions in milk production in dairy herds and loss of body condition in both calves and adults (Saif et al., 1998) , resulting in severe economic losses. Thus, BCoV is currently considered an important pathogen that causes enteric disease, often in combination with clinical respiratory signs.",

The BCoV genome consists of a single molecule of linear, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA of 31 kb in length that is transcribed into a nested set of several 3 0 -coterminal subgenomic mRNAs that produce both non-structural and structural proteins (Chouljenko et al., 2001) . The virion contains five structural proteins: the nucleocapsid (N) protein, the transmembrane (M) protein, the small envelope (E) protein, the haemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein and the spike (S) protein (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997) .",

At the end of each run, the convergence of the chains was inspected through the average standard deviation of split frequencies and the first 15% of the trees were discarded. After burn-in, the convergence was again assessed based on the effective sampling size (ESS) using Tracer software version 1.4 (http://tree. bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/).

            "text": "It is also important to highlight that WD, which is the most severe clinical form of BCoV infection, occurs in adult cattle in the winter due to predisposing events such as cold temperatures and drinking cold water (White et al., 1989) . However, the tropical weather conditions in Cuba are far from ''cold temperatures in the winter season''. Similarly, some WD outbreaks associated with BCoV infections during warmer seasons have been reported (Decaro et al., 2008; Park et al., 2006) . These issues suggest that molecular changes in the currently circulating BCoV strains could have occurred to facilitate viral adaptation to the warmer environment. The molecular analysis of the S entire gene in the present work did not reveal any genetic markers linked to viral adaptation to hot weather. This suggests that the viral adaptation to temperature changes could be linked to others structural or non-structural genes.",
