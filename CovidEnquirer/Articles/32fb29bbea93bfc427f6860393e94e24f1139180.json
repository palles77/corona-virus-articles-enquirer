Diagnosing the disease effectively and accurately at early stage is essential for preventing the disease transmission and performing antiviral treatment. In this study, we raised monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV and mapped epitopes by using different truncated N protein fragments. The mapping of those epitopes was valuable for constructing pair-Abs used in serological diagnosis. The results showed that all of the six raised mAbs were divided into two groups recognizing the region of amino acids 249-317 (A group) or 317-395 (B group). This region spanning amino acids 249-395 contains predominant B cell epitopes located at the C-terminus of N protein. One pair-Abs, consisting of N protein-specific rabbit polyclonal antibody and SARS-CoV N protein-specific mAb, was selected to construct a sandwich ELISA-kit. The kit was able to specifically detect SARS-CoV N proteins in serum samples.",

One study demonstrated that fragment N8 (amino acid residues 51-422), N11 (133-422), and N13 (221-422) reacted with most of all tested 52 SARS patient sera [11] . The percentages of positive responses were 100%, 96%, and 100%, respectively. The results indicate that the C-terminus of N protein is highly immunogenic and is a good target for Supernatants from N-17-3 and S-39-2 mAbs had higher titers than other clones and they were selected for further experiments. The supernatants were collected from a 3 day-culture of 1 \u00b7 10 6 hybridoma cells in 9 ml medium and were used directly to detect values of OD 450 and isotypes by ELISA. serological diagnosis. It is assumed that if a mAb can recognize N13 fragment that is similar to our N2 fragment, it will be valuable to be used in serological diagnosis. To achieve this purpose, two mAb clones (N-17-13 and S-39-2) showing the highest affinity to N protein were selected ( Table 1 ). The mAbs recognized two different epitopes (amino acid residues 249-317 and 317-395, respectively) within N2 fragment (221-422) ( Table 2 ). The affinity for a given mAb is essential in ELISAkit. To test the affinity of the two selected mAbs (S-39-2 and N-17-3), their affinity constants were measured by non-competitive ELISA as described in Materials and methods.

The detection curve for N protein and the cross-reactivity to sera from different patients with unrelevant disease were tested by the kit. The results showed that the kit was able to detect N protein with a linear curve (from 1 to 1000 ng/ml) (Fig. 7) . It was also observed that all of selected patient sera, including tumor, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), syphilis, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) did not react with the kit (data not shown). To confirm whether the kit was suitable in detecting N protein in the sera, total 186 SARS-CoV patients were selected in Beijing area. All the patients were diagnosed to be SARS cases based on their clinical syndromes and tested positive for SARS-CoV S protein-specific IgG in the sera. In addition, the sera of 103 health individuals were collected in the same area to serve as negative control.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV has relatively high transmissibility and mortality. In order to block the disease transmission and perform antiviral therapy efficiently, a rapid and accurate diagnostic method to detect SARS-CoV at the early stage of the disease is needed. Three methods are currently used for SARS diagnosis. The first is a real-time PCR method that has a poor sensitivity due to false positive results. The second is to detect viral antigen-specific antibodies, but the Abs are detected only after 10-14 days following SARS-CoV infection. The third is to isolate the virus from cell culture, which needs more time and a biosafety P3 laboratory. Therefore, a sandwich ELISA to detect viral antigen can be helpful for the disease diagnosis. We initially considered the spike protein as a good candidate for antigen capture. Unexpectedly, our data and those from other authors suggested that the S protein was expressed at very low levels in vivo and in cultured cells [6, 12] . It was difficult to directly detect the soluble S protein from the patient\u00d5s blood. The S protein is exposed on the surface of SARS-CoV and distributed mainly in infected tissues, such as the lungs [13, 14] . Based on our observation, it was suggested that the S protein-specific Abs from patient sera had a potential in serological diagnosis, but at later stage of SARS infection [8] . In contrast, SARS N protein is important for the viral RNA transcription and provides nuclearimport signal during SARS-CoV replication [15, 16] . In addition, N protein is located inside the SARS-CoV particle, but is abundantly released in patient\u00d5s blood during the virus infection. Thus, its potential in clinical diagnosis has been investigated [3] .",

Our observation is consistent with the other report that the N protein fragment, N13 (amino acid residues 221-422), can react with 100% of sera from SARS patients [11] .

This kit needed to be validated for its capacity to detect N protein. Second, in all tested SARS patients, it is interesting to note that the N protein was detectable with the kit only at early stage (5-10 days) after SARS-CoV infection. A possible explanation is that N protein of SARS-CoV could be released into the peripheral blood during the stage of virus replication and later on would be neutralized and eliminated by the patient\u00d5s high titers of Abs raised against N protein.
