Six potential sources were identified and apportioned by PMF analysis on PNSD. Airport emissions contributed~20% to the total PNC. No specific local sources of BC can be identified as dominant. a b s t r a c t Atmospheric particles are of high concern due to their toxic properties and effects on climate, and large airports are known as significant sources of particles. This study investigates the contribution of the Airport of Venice (Italy) to black carbon (BC), total particle number concentrations (PNC) and particle number size distributions (PNSD) over a large range (14 nme20 mm). Continuous measurements were conducted between April and June 2014 at a site located 110 m from the main taxiway and 300 m from the runway. Results revealed no significantly elevated levels of BC and PNC, but exhibited characteristic diurnal profiles. PNSD were then analysed using both k-means cluster analysis and positive matrix factorization. Five clusters were extracted and identified as midday nucleation events, road traffic, aircraft, airport and nighttime pollution. Six factors were apportioned and identified as probable sources according to the size profiles, directional association, diurnal variation, road and airport traffic volumes and their relationships to micrometeorology and common air pollutants. Photochemical nucleation accounted for~44% of total number, followed by road \u00fe shipping traffic (26%). Airport-related emissions accounted for~20% of total PNC and showed a main mode at 80 nm and a second mode beyond the lower limit of the SMPS (<14 nm). The remaining factors accounted for less than 10% of number counts, but were relevant for total volume concentrations: nighttime nitrate, regional pollution and local resuspension. An analysis of BC levels over different wind sectors revealed no especially significant contributions from specific directions associated with the main local sources, but a potentially significant role of diurnal dynamics of the mixing layer on BC levels. The approaches adopted in this study have identified and apportioned the main sources of particles and BC at an international airport located in area affected by a complex emission scenario. The results may underpin measures for improving local and regional air quality, and health impact assessment studies.",

The transformation and combustion of fossil fuels are amongst the main sources worldwide impacting upon PM and are studied widely because of the increasing demand for energy driven by industrialised countries and the economic growth of emerging regions. Besides the well-recognised sources which combust fossil fuels (e.g., road traffic, shipping, industries, domestic heating), aviation deserves particular attention because of the rapid growth of civil aviation. Despite the occurrence of events of global impact, such as the terrorist attack of 11th September 2011, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2002e2003 and the recent global economic crisis (2008e2009), civil aviation has experienced an almost constant growth from the 1930s to present day. This trend (about \u00fe5% every year) is expected to continue over the next decades (Lee et al., 2009) .",

The major type of aircraft flying at VCE are short-to medium-range, narrow-body, twinengine airliners: A320 > A319 > A321 > B737-800 > B717; it is located close to a densely populated urban area (Mestre), where the levels of particulate matter pollution do not fully comply with the EC limit and target values (Masiol et al., 2014a) ; it is located in a coastal area and is therefore affected by the atmospheric circulation associated with sea/land breezes during the warm season. This circulation may potentially advect the pollutants emitted at the airport toward the mainland during the daytime; being located on the eastern edge of the Po Valley, it is potentially affected by the transport of pollutants at regional or even transboundary scales (e.g., Squizzato and Masiol, 2015) ; the air quality scenario of the area is extremely complex because of the high range of differing potential sources, including: (1) high density residential areas mostly using methane for domestic heating, even though the burning of wood (i.e. logs, briquettes, chips and pellets) is nowadays becoming an increasing alternative; (2) heavily trafficked roads which are highly congested during peak hours with light and heavy duty vehicles using gasoline, diesel and LPG fuels; (3) a motorway and a motorway-link which are a part of the main European routes E55 and E70, with the consequent heavy duty vehicle traffic transporting goods between Italy, Eastern and Central Europe; (4) an extended industrial area (Porto Marghera) hosting a large number of different installations, including thermal power plants burning coal and refuse derived fuels, a large shipbuilding industry, oil-refinery, municipal solid waste incinerators and many other chemical, metallurgical and glass plants; (5) the artistic glassmaking factories in the Island of Murano, which is made up of small and medium-sized glassworks without significant measures for emission abatement; (6) heavy shipping traffic due to public transport, commercial and cruise terminals (annually, 3600e4000 vessels pass throughout the harbour of Venice accounting for a total tonnage of more than 25 billion kg); A preliminary study (Valotto et al., 2014) has indicated a potential influence of airport emissions on PM 1 mass concentrations, mainly attributed to tyre wear during landing.",

The sampling site location ( Fig. 1 ) was the best compromise between stringent safety measures for flights and scientific purposes. Sea breezes occur during daytime approx. from April to October and blow air masses from the Adriatic Sea to the mainland (Fig. SI1 ). Aircraft mostly used the runway 04L (landing and takeoff direction predominantly from SW to NE). During the sampling campaign,~300 aircraft used the runway 22R (opposite direction to 04L, from NE to SW) out of a total of~9500 flight movements (~3.2%). Under such circumstances, the site was chosen to catch the aircraft plumes and was set in a place downwind of the latter part of the taxiway and the beginning of the runway, where aircraft run their engines at 100% thrust during take-off or where the wheels hit the ground during landing causing smoke clearly visible to the naked eye. This choice was further supported by a modelling study (Pecorari et al., 2015) reporting that the site is affected by aircraft engine plumes for gaseous pollutants.",

In this way, unmerged spectra have been used also in previous source apportionment studies (e.g., Zhou et al., 2004; Ogulei et al., 2006) . Input data were initially handled by averaging groups of three consecutive bins. This procedure has some advantages: (i) reduces the number of variables processed by the PMF, (ii) minimises the noise of raw SMPS data, which may cause high variability amongst consecutive bins and (iii) limits the number of null values (zeros) which are sometimes recorded in the more coarse bins of the SMPS and APS. This way, a total of 51 bins were used as input for PMF: 34 bins from the SMPS ranging from 14.6 nm to 552.3 nm and 17 bins from the APS (0.5e19.8 mm). In addition the total variable (total number of particles) was calculated by summing the concentrations of each size bin adjusted with the appropriate multipliers accounting for channel resolutions of the SMPS and APS.",

Essentially, the methodology aims to group single PNSD spectra (SMPS \u00fe APS data, 5 min-resolved observations, in this case) into a number k of clusters. The partition of each observation into a cluster is based on the similarity of the PNSD spectra with the cluster centroids (means), i.e. the method is optimised to group similarly-shaped PNSD spectra into the same cluster. This strategy has the advantage to group observations with similar spectra, which are likely to be originated by the same set of emission sources or formation processes. The optimum number of clusters was determined by an optimisation algorithm based on the shape of the spectra (Beddows et al., 2009 ).",

The highest average concentrations for other pollutants followed the order (in mg m \u00c03 ): Fig. 2b shows the diurnal profiles of pollutants at local time, flight traffic and weather parameters computed by hourly averaging the data. Nucleation range particles show an evident increase during daytime, which is broadly comparable with the diurnal pattern in solar irradiance. Similar diurnal cycles have been observed in other studies (e.g., Kulmala and Kerminen, 2008; Chen et al., 2011; Hirsikko et al., 2013) and have been attributed to nucleation events driven by photochemical reactions and possibly assisted by turbulent mixing in the atmosphere (Janssen et al., 2012) . However, the diurnal cycle of nucleation particles is also very similar to that of air traffic intensity. Aitken, accumulation and coarse particles, CO, nitrogen oxides and BC exhibit highest concentrations in the early morning and secondarily in the evening. These patterns are mainly driven by the interaction of emissions, dispersion and atmospheric chemical processes. Similar diurnal cycles have been previously observed at an urban background site in Mestre-Venice for gaseous pollutants (Masiol et al., 2014b) . Following the complex photochemistry of the NO-NO 2 -O 3 system, the cycle of O 3 , which show a daily peak in the afternoon, is the inverse of the cycle of traffic emissions. Despite the very low concentrations of SO 2 normally recorded over the study area, a daily cycle similar to ozone can be identified. Since the daylight hours of the warm season are characterised by the presence of sea breezes, an influence of the local circulation pattern on the levels of O 3 and SO 2 should be further considered. Fig. 2b also shows the daily pattern of wind, showing highest speeds in the afternoon (average 3.5 m s \u00c01 ), which are mainly caused by the influence of sea breezes.",

In Europe, despite the efforts to lower the NO x emissions, NO 2 levels do not yet meet the targets in many locations, including the study area. This is attributed to a discrepancy between achieving NO x emission reductions and NO 2 ambient concentrations (e.g., Grice et al., 2009; Cyrys et al., 2012) , which has been related to the growing proportion of diesel-powered vehicles with known high primary (direct) emissions of NO 2 (Carslaw et al., 2007) . In the study area (Province of Venice), the emission inventories for 2007/8 (ARPAV, 2014) Fig. 2 . a) Boxplots of some analysed pollutants (line \u00bc median, box \u00bc inter-quartile range, whiskers \u00bc \u00b11.5 \u00c2 inter-quartile range). b) Diurnal variations of levels of measured pollutants computed over the hourly averaged data during the sampling period (e.g., 6:00 refer to averaged data between 6:00 and 7:00). Each plot reports the average level as a filled line and the associated 75th and 99th confidence intervals calculated by bootstrapping the data (n \u00bc 200). In purple particle number data from SMPS and APS, which were roughly categorised as: nucleation (14e30 nm), Aitken nuclei (30e100 nm), accumulation (0.1e1 mm) and coarse particles (1e20 mm); in red gaseous pollutants; in black nongaseous pollutants and in green some micro-meteorological variables. Data of airport traffic only refer to civil aviation movements. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure caption, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) indicated a cumulative emission of 24.4 Gg NO x y \u00c01 , mainly attributed to road transport (37%), combustion in energy and transformation industries (24%) and other mobile sources and machinery (21%). Airport emissions fall into this latter category: aircraft engines emit NO x , and emissions increase with engine thrust, i.e. are higher during take-off and lower in taxi and idle phases. The NO-NO 2 partitioning in the emissions of modern high by-pass turbofan engines is also thrust-dependent: NO 2 is principally emitted at idle, while NO is dominant at higher thrust regimes (Wormhoudt et al., 2007) . At a first glance, the diurnal profile of NO 2 /NO x ratio can be related to airport emissions due to takeoffs (higher NO), however the daily pattern and value of the ratio are similar to those observed at an urban background site in Mestre-Venice (Masiol et al., 2014b) , indicating that vehicular traffic is probably the most influential source. The level of total oxidants (OX \u00bc O 3 \u00fe NO 2 , in ppbv) is useful to assess the oxidative potential in the atmosphere (Kley et al., 1999) . Results show that OX levels are mainly driven by ozone and highest concentrations are recorded in the afternoon.",

Polar annuli map the average levels of pollutants by wind direction and hours of the day. Generally, most air pollutants (NO, NO 2 , OX, SO 2 and PNC) show increasing average concentrations for winds blowing from the SE and SW quadrants, CO decreases for moderate winds from the South and stronger winds from NW, ozone shows no prevalent sector but increases with wind speed, while PM 2.5 and BC increase in calm wind periods and for moderate/strong winds from E, W and S.

This finding is also evident if considering the partitioning of NO x , which shows a remarkable drop of NO 2 /NO x toward the runway, indicative of a local source. In addition, NO also increases toward the S-SW sector probably because of emissions of road traffic in Mestre and shipping in Venice; Despite its very low concentration, SO 2 (an excellent tracer for shipping, aircraft and oil refineries) seems to be related more to industrial emissions (SW quadrant) and to the Port of Venice (SE), than to the airport activities (quadrant to NE); PNC increases toward the SE and SW quadrants, particularly for strong winds from the South, and to a minor extent, from the NE quadrant. These finding suggest that airport activities are not the main source of particles in the area; PM 2.5 increases towards the East, South and West. Although increases from S and W can be related to external sources such as main roads and urban settlements, the high levels recorded towards the East, which roughly corresponds to the section of runway where planes generally land, may relate to aircraft emissions during landing.",

Fig. 4 shows the median PNSDs calculated over the entire sampling campaign and categorised by time of day (01:00e07:00; 07:00e13:00; 13:00e19:00; 19:00e01:00 local time). Medians, 25th and 75th percentiles for SMPS and APS data were then merged using the algorithm developed by Beddows et al. (2010) , which also returns the particle volume concentrations (PVSDs). Results show a significant variation in diurnal modal structures of PNSDs with a main mode ranging from below 14 nm in the daytime periods t\u00f5 40e50 nm during nighttime and early morning. There are two main reasons for this results: (i) the increased airport activities (6 a.m.e10 p.m.) emitting fresh nucleation particles, as reported by several studies (e.g., Anderson et al., 2005; Kinsey et al., 2010; Mazaheri et al., 2013) and (ii) the potential role of nucleation processes during daytime. In this latter context, the diurnal occurrence of sea breezes cannot be disregarded since it may have a potential role in transporting fresh air masses from the Adriatic Sea and the nearby lagoon, which are affected by large tidal cycles and are known sources of aerosol precursor compounds. The production of secondary ultrafine particles may occur in the marine boundary layer by the nucleation of low vapour pressure gases produced naturally (but also of anthropogenic origin) (e.g., O'Dowd and De Leeuw, 2007; Modini et al., 2009) : through (1) homogeneous nucleation and (2) the subsequent particle growth via a number of mechanisms and scavenging of clusters by larger pre-existing particles. However, the diurnal variations may also be linked to the main (primary) emission sources in the study area, i.e. mobile emissions either from road or maritime sources (commercial and tourist ships, private and public transport boats). On the contrary, PVSDs seem to undergo only modest changes throughout the day, with two main modes at 300e400 nm and 3e5 mm.",

Hussein et al.

To facilitate the interpretation of results, a series of 5 consecutive days (23th May 0:00 to 27th May 23:00) was selected and investigated in depth; the period was chosen to be representative of the typical cycling of clusters and typical meteorological conditions. Fig. 6 reports a large number of variables measured within this period, including cluster number counts, airport movements (arrivals \u00fe departures), solar radiation, NO, SO 2 , and SMPS data (total PNC for nucleation, Aitken and accumulation ranges and the contour plot of PNSD). Arrows indicating the wind speed and direction data also accompany the plots to help the interpretation of results.",

Despite its diurnal profile and wind direction being compatible with the airport emissions, Fig. 6 clearly shows that cluster 5 well depicts local nucleation events centred in the early afternoon. Daytime nucleation events forming particles below 15 nm are often observed in coastal environments and are associated with high OH radical and SO 2 concentrations, but also with iodine oxide gasphase processes (O'Dowd et al., 1999; O'Dowd and Hoffmann, 2006) . They are also widely observed at southern European sites without a nearby marine influence (Reche et al., 2011) . At least 3 nucleation events can be found over the selected period (23th, 24th and 27th May): they can be recognised from their typical \"banana\" shape ( Fig. 6) . Midday nucleation events start at noon with a huge increment of PNC in the finest nucleation range and, then, particles generally continue to grow over the afternoon, evening and overnight to reach the Aitken and accumulation ranges. Most of the time, cluster 5 observations become dominant for several hours (generally from 4 to 8 h after the event), but the nucleation event generally lasts less than 24 h. PNSD spectra and clustering results were further investigated to detect and quantify the number of midday nucleation events during the sampling campaign. Despite the complexity of the emission scenario in VCE, a method similar to Dal Maso et al. (2005) was adopted. Data were visually analysed on a daily basis and midday nucleation events are then identified following well defined criteria: (i) only days with a significant number of non-missing records were evaluated; (ii) nucleation episodes must have a clear boost in particle below 30 nm starting around noon; (iii) most of the spectra in an event must be categorised into the cluster 5; (iv) increases in cluster 5-spectra must prevail over a time span of hours; (v) particles must show signs of growth after an event has been initiated. Following such criteria, 7 events have been successfully recorded from a total of 17 valid days (~40%).",

Cluster 2 links spectra characterised by a particles in the nucleation range and peaking below the minimum detection diameter of the SMPS (14 nm), while cluster 4 groups spectra showing a primary mode at 60e100 nm and, secondarily, below 14 nm. Most of the literature reports that aircraft engine exhausts emit particles in the nucleation range (Kinsey et al., 2010; Mazaheri et al., 2013; Masiol and Harrison, 2014; Lobo et al., 2012 Lobo et al., , 2015 , however, some studies also report a second mode in the accumulation range (e.g., Mazaheri et al., 2009 ). Looking at the aircraft traffic provided by the airport, it is clear that the hourly counts of cluster 2 well relate with the aircraft movements ( Fig. 2 and SI2) . On the contrary, hourly counts for cluster 4 are pretty constant through the day (Fig. 5 ) and the wind rose also recorded counts for winds blowing from the NNE sector, i.e. toward the airport terminal and aircraft park areas. In this light, it can be hypothesized that cluster 2 represents fresh emissions from taking-off or landing aircraft, whereas, cluster 4 is more related to background levels of particles due to the taxi phases and operations at the gates.",

A summary of PMF results is also provided in Table 1. A first attempt to link PMF factors with airport traffic was carried out by computing Spearman correlations among factor contributions and real airport traffic movements (total, arrivals, departures) at 5 min resolution. Airport traffic was elaborated to return the more plausible number of aircraft movements every 5 min and takes in account the exact timing of each movement. Traffic data include the timings of landing and parking at the terminal (for arrivals) and the timings of departure from gates and take-off (for departures). This way, each movement was adjusted for the real time that each aircraft was moving. The dataset was also handled to maximise the signal of aircraft, i.e. selecting hours with high airport traffic (10 a.m.e9 p.m.) and wind regimes blowing air masses from the taxiway and runway to the sampling site (45e170 ). No one factor showed significant (p < 0.001) strong (r > 0.6) or even weak (0.35 < r < 0.6) correlation with airport traffic. This result may be explained by a number of reasons: (i) airport emissions are complicated to model and predict due to the large number of different phases in the LTO cycles: even if it possible to know the exact time of each movement, it is difficult to predict the timing and the relative position of aircraft at different phases (e.g., the time spent by aircraft in the queue at the beginning of the runway was not recorded or when they are exactly upwind of the sampling site); (ii) although aircraft engines are expected to be the larger contributors to the air pollution at the airport, other sources may interfere by emitting particles with similar size distributions and, then, adding noise to the PMF results (e.g., the aircraft auxiliary power units (APU), which are small on-board turbines providing a source of electrical power and compressed air when aircraft are parked at the gate and sometimes during taxi); (iii) other strong sources are present in the study area; (iv) wind data are recorded hourly and then interpolated for obtaining 5 min time resolution, therefore unknown discrepancies may occur between estimated and real wind data. This latter point was overcome by investigating 1 h-averaged traffic and PMF data, but correlations were still low for all of the factors.",

However, its contribution to the volume distribution is~1%. This factor shows significant (p < 0.001) but weak (0.35 < r < 0.6) positive correlations with NO (but not NO 2 ), OX, solar irradiance, air temperature and exhibits an evident diurnal variation peaking at 1 p.m. and higher levels during the afternoon. The polar plot analysis (Fig. 8) indicates enhanced levels when winds blow from the SW and SE quadrants: whilst the increase from the SE quadrant arises for high wind speeds (>5 m s \u00c01 ) towards the airfield, the increase in the SW quadrant occurs for lower speeds (3e5 m s \u00c01 ). The polar annulus analysis indicates that the higher concentrations are for winds blowing from S to SW at 12 noon-4 p.m. This behaviour is consistent with the location of several anthropogenic sources in the study area which can contribute to particles in the nucleation range, i.e. the road traffic in the urban area of Mestre (toward SW), the stack emissions from the industrial area (SW), shipping in Venice and its tourist harbour (S) and the airport activities and aircraft movements (SE). In this context, particles peaking in the nucleation range have been observed for multiple anthropogenic sources: (i) fresh diesel engines (Shi and Harrison, 1999) , (ii) diesel-equipped boats at high engine loads (Petzold et al., 2010) , (iii) coal-fired power plants (Nielsen et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2010) aircraft (Anderson et al., 2005; Kinsey et al., 2010; Mazaheri et al., 2013; Lobo et al., 2015) . However, particles in this size range may also originate from photochemically-driven nucleation processes. The profile for this factor relates well to the shapes grouped in the cluster 5 in the kmeans cluster analysis (midday nucleation events). The polar plot for this factor (Fig. 8 ) also shows the highest intensity in areas of the plot showing the lowest PM 2.5 concentrations (Fig. 3) . This is consistent with nucleation being favoured by a low condensation sink (Dall'Osto et al., 2013) .",

A similar sampling campaign was carried out in July 2014 at a kerbside site in the urban area of Mestre using a similar set of instruments (SMPS, aethalometer). Preliminary results of this study are provided as supplementary material: Fig. SI6 shows the map of the sampling location, while Fig. SI7 reports the \"nucleation factor\" extracted by applying PMF analysis to SMPS data. These results show an identical size distribution (particles peaking at 15e20 nm) with a similar daily pattern (main peak at noon-1 p.m. followed by a second minor peak at 6e7 a.m.). However, the polar plot analysis significantly differs showing strong increases for winds blowing from the SE, i.e. the direction of the industrial zone. Since the kerbside site is located 9.5 km WSW from VCE and weather conditions were very similar (summer sea/land breeze regime), an origin of factor 1 from airport activities is not consistent with the results. An origin from the industrial zone is plausible. As already reported, a large coal-fired power plant and an oil refinery are located in the industrial area of Porto Marghera and both installations are potential sources of particles in the nucleation range (Nielsen et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2010; Cheung et al., 2012) and SO 2 . Emission inventories for 2010 (ARPAV e Regione Veneto, 2015) reported that combustion in energy and transformation industries accounts for~72% of total SO 2 emissions in the Venice Province. It has been reported that the probability of nucleation is increased by elevated SO 2 concentrations (e.g., Stanier et al., 2004) and a 13 year-long monitoring of airborne pollutants conducted in Mestre (Masiol et al., 2014b) reported evident peaks of SO 2 for winds blowing from the industrial zone. A large influence of oil refineries and/or coal-fired power plants upon the particle number concentrations in the nucleation range have been observed in many parts of the world (e.g., Stevens et al., 2012; Cheung et al., 2012; Gonz alez and Rodr\u00edguez, 2013) .",

In addition, the polar plot for factor 1 also shows minor increases towards the airfield for strong winds. The sulphur content in jet fuel is limited to 3000 ppm and is commonly reported within the range 300e1100 ppm (Masiol and Harrison, 2014 , and reference therein), which is approximately 30e100 times higher than that for automotive fuels (<10 ppm).

As a consequence, the hypothesis of multiple-source attribution for nucleation particles is plausible and it is impossible to assign to a specific one with certainty. However, the temporal profile and the fact that the same source profile was found in another site in the area and affected by different emission scenarios is very consistent with a nucleation source driven by regional processes and the most significant sources of sulphur dioxide in the area.",

Its contribution to the volume distribution is low (~5%) and peaks at 80 and 500 nm. Several observations link this factor to road traffic: (i) correlation analysis shows significant moderate positive associations with NO 2 (r \u00bc 0.44) and BC (r \u00bc 0.41), which are pollutants primarily emitted by road traffic (mainly diesel); (ii) such correlations have maxima at 0 h lag, suggesting covariant sources (Fig. 9) ; (iii) the diurnal variations reveal a typical cycle common to traffic-related sources (morning and evening rush traffic hours); (iv) the directional analysis shows increased levels when air masses move from the main populated sectors of the mainland, i.e. the urban area of Mestre (SW), and several mains road towards the N and (v) the factor profile is very similar to the cluster 1 (road traffic) extracted by the k-mean cluster analysis. It is extensively reported that particles in the size range of factor 2 may originate from the dilution of diesel exhaust emissions (Charron and Harrison, 2003; Janh\u20ac all et al., 2004; Ntziachristos et al., 2007; Harrison et al., 2011) as well as from gasoline-powered cars Huang et al., 2013) . Similar factor profiles have been also reported in the literature for road traffic (e.g., Yue et al., 2008; Costabile et al., 2009; Harrison et al., 2011) . However, the polar plot analysis also shows increased levels for winds blowing from S, i.e. the direction of the historic city centre of Venice and its passenger terminal and for high wind regimes from SSE, i.e. toward the Lido inlet, a main entrance of cruise ships into the Lagoon of Venice. A number of studies have associated particles in this size range with marine traffic. Jonsson et al. (2011) reported that emissions from cargo and passenger ships peak at~35 nm; Healy et al. (2009) (1999) , who investigated the mechanisms of particle formation during combustion within marine diesel engines affected by hot corrosion and erosion. In the light of this, besides road traffic, factor 2 can be also linked to the marine traffic emissions from ships, waterbuses and boats of public or private transport services, which are commonly equipped with marine diesel engines. Currently, the contribution of the Port of Venice to the levels of PM is heavily debated (Contini et al., 2015) and information on the emissions from waterbuses and the private boat fleet is still lacking (Pecorari et al., 2013a) . Factor 2 was interpreted as road \u00fe shipping traffic, mainly due to diesel engine emissions.",

No other factors show polar plots consistent with aircraft emissions. Some studies also report the presence of a second mode in the accumulation range for aircraft exhausts (Kinsey et al., 2010; Lobo et al., 2012; Mazaheri et al., 2013) . For example, in a study conducted at the Brisbane airport (Australia), Mazaheri et al. (2009) investigated a total of 283 individual aircraft plumes during landing and takeoff (LTO) cycles and reported accumulation modes between 40 and 100 nm, more pronounced in particle number size distributions during takeoffs. These findings are also consistent with Herndon et al. (2008) , who studied the emissions from in-use commercial aircraft engines downwind of operational taxi-and runways at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta airport (USA) and reported the presence of a mode at~65 nm associated with takeoff plumes and a smaller mode at~25 nm associated with idle. Comparing the profile of factor 3 with clustering results, it can be noted that it fits profiles for both cluster 2 and 4 (aircraft and airportrelated shapes). In particular, looking at the diurnal variations, factor 3 seems more related with cluster 4 than with cluster 2. Although factor 3 lacks a main peak in the nucleation range, its fingerprint (Fig. 7) shows the presence of a significant second mode for particles below 14 nm, which may represent the main peak in the nucleation range reported in the literature for aircraft emissions. An apparent shift towards smaller particle sizes can be attributed to evaporative shrinkage of particles before the exhaust plumes reached the sampling site Harrison et al., 2016) . In this context, the total number of particles attributed by our study to the aircraft exhaust emissions will be underestimated because the lower limit of detection of SMPS curtails this second peak below 14 nm.",

It has two modes in the number distribution (30 and 200 nm) and a main mode in the volume distribution (400 nm). Polar plot analysis does not reveal any significant directionality toward specific local sources, but shows a marked boost during wind calm hours (r wind speed \u00bc \u00c00.54) and low winds from the NNE. The daily pattern is the mirror image of the air temperature, and it is positively correlated with NO 2 (but not with NO), PM 2.5 and BC and negatively correlated with O 3 , OX and SO 2 . The factor 4 can be related to the cluster 3 (nighttime pollution): they match for the 30 nm peak and they show the same diurnal patterns. These results raise the following issues: (i) the higher levels reached in calm and low wind periods may suggest that the origin of the factor is local rather than external or linked to regional transport; (ii) an origin from the airport can be excluded because of the diurnal profile (very limited airport traffic recorded overnight); (iii) the directionality toward NNE, where there are no significant emission sources, may indicate that such a factor is not linked to freshly emitted pollutant. The peak intensity during the nighttime and the significant, but weak, association with NO 2 are highly consistent with the chemistry driving the heterogeneous reactions of N 2 O 5 and NO 3 on aerosol surfaces (Seinfeld and Pandis, 2006; Bertram and Thornton, 2009; Brown and Stutz, 2012) . This process has been observed in many polluted areas (e.g., Fine et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009 ). In particular, Dall'Osto et al. (2009) observed that most nitrate particles in London are: (i) locally produced in urban locations during nighttime; (ii) mainly present in particles smaller than 300 nm and (iii) internally mixed with sulphate, ammonium, elemental and organic carbon. Therefore, this factor clearly depicts the condensation of secondary nitrate on pre-existing particles occurring overnight and enhanced by the air temperatures below 20 C. The analysis of CCF (Fig. 9 ) confirms this interpretation by revealing a delay of about 2 h in maximum negative correlations with ambient temperature, which is likely linked to the time needed for the heterogeneous reactions on the surface of particles. Moreover, it would be expected that nitrate-containing particles can subsequently undergo evaporation during daytime. This latter interpretation relates well to a recent study by Squizzato et al. (2013) , who reported low levels of PM 2.5 -bound nitrate in Venice during the warm season because of the partitioning of nitrate towards the gas-phase.",

            "text": "Further information can be extracted by analysing this factor. The high correlation with BC (r \u00bc 0.64 with maximum correlations at 0 h lags) suggests that BC particles have a key role in the formation processes by acting as condensation nuclei for nitrate aerosol. BC is a primary pollutant and is therefore directly emitted from specific combustion sources: in the study area principally industries (mainly coal power plant), shipping and traffic. However, none of these primary sources are located toward the NNE. This correlation is mostly driven by the concurrent effects of the nocturnal circulation (prevalent winds blowing from the NNE) and the lower mixing layer height reached in the coldest nighttime hours (typically at 6 a.m.). In the warmest season, the mixing height over the study area may reach 1 km or more during daytime, allowing a greater dispersion of pollutants emitted at the ground, whereas it drops down to below 100 m or less during night (Pecorari et al., 2013b) . Therefore it can be speculated that locallyemitted BC particles and NO x undergo a wide dispersion within the expanded mixing layer during the daytime and move toward the mainland because of the sea breezes. Overnight, the reduction of the mixing layer height restricts BC and nitrogen oxides emissions to a layer close to ground level. In this scenario, both the reduction in air temperatures and the increased concentrations of NO x (Fig. 2b) potentially boost the formation of nitrate aerosol in the particle-phase on BC nuclei.",

Their contributions to the total particle volume concentrations are 21.1% and 12.2%, respectively, while their shares of PNC are negligible (3 and 1.5%, respectively). Apparently, both factors also show increased levels with high winds blowing from the first NE sector and diurnal cycles inverse to the air temperature. However, despite most factors showing repetitive or cyclic daily variations, factor 5 does not present a regular diurnal pattern, but exhibits two relatively short periods with very high contributions: 18e19 and 23e24 May. This result may indicate that it is not necessarily linked with local stationary sources and not strongly affected by micro-or meso-scale weather conditions, such as breezes. Consequently, the potential origin of this factor was investigated through the concentration weighted trajectory (CWT) analysis of the back-trajectories. Details of the adopted method are provided in Hsu et al. (2003) . Results reveal a potential regional origin from Central Italy (Fig. SI8 ), but also increased levels when air masses move from some populated areas of Central Europe. The best interpretation for this factor is therefore the regional/transboundary pollution transport across Italy and/or Europe.",

Super-micrometre particles are likely emitted from noncombustion sources. The daily cycle is very similar to that of nighttime nitrate (factor 4), BC and NO 2 , but no correlations are significantly high with those variables. On the contrary, factor 6 clearly shows weak negative correlations with O 3 , OX, wind speed, solar irradiance and air temperature. Strong winds from the NNE bring air masses from agricultural fields as well as from some places in the surroundings of the airport affected by work during the sampling campaign. Consequently, the most plausible interpretation for factor 6 is the local resuspension of large dust particles, presumed to be of crustal origin. The diurnal pattern is explained by the fact that land breezes occur at nighttime, only linking source areas to the sampling site at this time of day.",

The analysis of the polar plot for BC (Fig. 3) does not reveal substantial increases of concentration in any direction, but a marked rise in levels during calm wind periods. An estimation of the relative contributions of local sources upon the BC levels was then made by comparing data for winds blowing from differing sectors. Six sectors were identified according to the location of the main sources of the study area: (i) the urban area of Mestre as representative of traffic-related emissions; (ii) the main industrial zone of Porto Marghera; (iii) Venice as representative of urban emissions and shipping; (iv) the Island of Murano for glassmaking emissions; (v) the VCE airfield comprising runway, taxiway and the main terminals and (vi) remaining sector. Selected sectors and polar annulus results are provided in Table 3 and Fig. SI3 , respectively. Data were also filtered for wind speed >1 m s \u00c01 to remove wind calm periods. Results (Fig. 10) show that the BC levels are higher when air masses arise from the 'other direction' sector, while they are almost constant for sectors indicative of each specific local anthropogenic source. This result is quite unexpected as soot particles are known to be emitted by most combustion sources in the area, e.g., road traffic (Pant and Harrison, 2013) , aircraft (Masiol and Harrison, 2014) , and ships (Lack and Corbett, 2012) , while emissions from wood combustion due to domestic heating and open burning are negligible in warm periods. During daytime, none of the local sources seems to have a dominant role in influencing the levels of atmospheric soot, while the nocturnal circulation (slow winds prevalently from NNE) and the lower mixing layer height (ca. 100 m) at nighttime restricts soot particles to the surface layer close to the ground.",

            "text": "This study was carried out at an international airport located in an area with a very complex emission scenario with the aim of detecting and apportioning the most probable sources of particles and black carbon. The main results can be summarised as follows: the fingerprint of aircraft emissions on the PNSD sampled in real ambient conditions reveals a main mode at approx. 80 nm and a second mode in the nucleation range below the lower limit for particle detection of the SMPS (<14 nm). Air traffic contributes about 22% of PNC, but does not contribute significantly to the mass concentrations of black carbon. However, the size distribution fingerprint could be affected by evaporative processes which have shifted the particle size below 14 nm and, thus, the total amount of particles emitted by the airport could be underestimated; nucleation particles with a mode at 15e20 nm are the main contributors to PNC (44%) and may be linked to both photochemical nucleation from precursor gases and the evolution of primary particles emitted by several combustion processes and undergoing condensation/evaporation/dilution processes after emission. Cluster analysis has helped to identify and quantify the midday nucleation episodes, which were recorded for about 40% of sampling days; the emissions of road traffic from the main urban area and shipping traffic around the city of Venice contributes~26% of PNC (mode at 35e40 nm); Coarse particles originated from nighttime nitrate formation and from resuspension advected by regional transport are the main contributors to the particle volume concentrations and, therefore, mass concentrations, as clearly indicated by significant positive correlations with PM 2.5 ; levels of black carbon are strongly associated with the dynamics of the mixing layer, while no specific local sources can be identified as dominant in the study area. BC also has an important role by providing condensation nuclei for nighttime secondary nitrate aerosol formation.",

Beside aircraft traffic, airports are often located near major cities and attract large volumes of road traffic, which are additive to the local pollution. Furthermore, micro-and meso-scale meteorology may move, mix and transform emitted primary pollutants. It is therefore very difficult to differentiate between pollutants arising from airport operations and those from other local sources. The approaches proposed in this study have successfully identified and apportioned the main potential sources in an area affected by a complex emission scenario and the results can be utilised to plan local air pollution control measures.",

Although such techniques are widely used to detect and quantify the sources of airborne particles (both for mass and number concentrations), their application to data collected near airports, or even inside the airfields, is still very limited. There are a number of reasons for this as studies at airports must face several issues: (i) the need of specific authorisations to enter the airport area for carrying chemical substances and/or radioactive sources required by some scientific equipment; (ii) the space and time allowed for research is strictly limited for compliance with the strong security standards of airports; (iii) the positioning of sampling sites is also restricted to fulfil security standards. For these reasons, limitations affected this study, such as the length of the sampling campaign and the location of the sampling site.
