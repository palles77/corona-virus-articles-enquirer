In many cases such VLPs have structural characteristics and antigenicity similar to the parental virus, and some have already proven successful as vaccines against the cognate virus infection. The structural components of some VLPs have also proven amenable to the insertion or fusion of foreign antigenic sequences, allowing the production of chimeric VLPs exposing the foreign antigen on their surface. Other VLPs have been used as carriers for foreign antigens, including non-protein antigens, via chemical conjugation.

For example, expression of the small envelope protein of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in yeast or mammalian cells leads to the formation of 22 nm VLPs that are essentially identical to the SVPs that are a natural product of HBV infection, found in patient blood at levels far greater than the virion itself. Notably, these plasmaderived SVPs provided the Wrst-generation HBV vaccines. Similarly, expression of the L1 protein of human papillomavirus leads to the assembly of VLPs that are somewhat similar to the \"empty\" virus particles formed during papillomavirus replication, although the natural empty particles also contain the L2 protein. Recombinant human papillomavirus vaccines, based on the L1 protein of HPV, are expected to be licensed in the near future. Further examples of VLPs as vaccine candidates are shown in Table 1 .",

Fusion of peptide sequences with the core gene (HBcAg) of hepatitis B virus provided an early example of this approach. Alternatively, foreign vaccine proteins may be chemically conjugated to pre-formed VLPs. As one example, this approach has been used in the production of HBcAg VLPs contain-ing the extracellular domain of the M2 ion channel protein of inXuenza A virus.

For non-enveloped viruses (such as HPV), or core particles of enveloped viruses (such as HBcAg), one or more chimeric capsid proteins are expressed for self-assembly. Multiple capsid proteins may be assembled either from expression and subsequent processing of a precursor protein [3, 4] or by co-expression of the capsid proteins from bicistronic or multicistronic vectors in the same cell [5] . For enveloped viruses, VLPs are assembled from envelope proteins with or without the matrix/capsid proteins that form the authentic viral particle. In either case, the envelope proteins bud from the usual cellular compartments (ER, plasma membrane or lipid rafts associated with the plasma membrane) and thus contain the cellular lipids that make up the viral lipoprotein envelope. In some instances the VLPs may also include host cell proteins, for example, the lipid raft associated ganglioside M1 in Ebola and Marburg VLPs, [6] and CD55, CD59 and CD46 in HIV, which help evade complement lysis [7] .",

VLPs provide the spatial structure for display of conformational epitopes and in doing so are most likely to mimic the native virus structure, thereby enhancing the production of neutralizing antibodies. This may be especially true for surface proteins of parasites and enveloped viruses, where enveloped VLPs allow the vaccine proteins to be presented in their natural state as membrane-bound proteins, rather than as the soluble ectodomains alone. VLPs may therefore oVer a safe and eVective approach for the induction of antibody to surface proteins where soluble forms of the proteins have failed to be eVective. Some VLPs also have the capacity to present multiple vaccine proteins to the immune system. Despite the success of the HBV vaccine, improvements to its eYcacy have been sought by inclusion of the large and middle envelope proteins to the HBsAg particle, thereby mimicking the authentic virion envelope which contains these three proteins [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . HBV vaccines which include these additional envelope proteins have to varying extents elicited antibody responses to these proteins, but more specifically they [73] provide additional T cell epitopes which promote an earlier anti-HBsAg response and improve the seroprotection rate by overcoming non-responsiveness to the HBsAg vaccine [11] [12] [13] . InXuenza A virus presents an example where recombinant VLPs have been developed that closely mimic the native virus particle [14] [15] [16] . InXuenza VLPs have a similar size to the native inXuenza virus particle (around 120 nm), and provide a useful alternative to egg-derived or cell-culture derived vaccines based on inactivated virus. However, the large size of the inXuenza VLPs may not be optimal for immunogenicity.",

This has included the production of synthetic proteoliposomes on solid microspherical beads in order to mimic the lipid membrane environment for presentation of HIV gp160 [17] , as well as VLPs mimicking the intact HIV particle, containing the envelope proteins associated with the viral gag protein core (see [18] for a more extensive review of HIV VLP vaccines). This has evolved with increasing knowledge of envelope structure through X-ray crystallography and mutational analysis of key envelope domains associated with viral entry, coupled with the understanding that conserved regions, unlikely to undergo antigenic variation through immune pressure, are essential targets for eliciting a broadly neutralising antibody response (reviewed in [18, 19] ). Recently, research has focused on presentation of highly conserved, neutralizing epitopes of the HIV-1 gp41 envelope protein in a prefusion conformation, which is only brieXy exposed during viral entry (reviewed by McGaughey [20] ). These speciWc goals for vaccine development are likely to require experimentation with the wide variety of VLPs and expression systems available and the use of functional assays, such as receptor binding, reactivity to conformation-speciWc antibodies, and most importantly the induction of broadly cross-neutralizing antibodies, as a means to conWrm the appropriate envelope protein folding for vaccine eYcacy.",

            "text": "In some cases, VLPs do not appear to require the use of adjuvants to achieve potent immune stimulation. The selfadjuvanting eVects of such VLPs are inherent in their tendency to be a suitable size for uptake by dendritic cells (DCs) for processing and presentation by MHC class II and for directly promoting DC maturation and migration, essential for stimulation of the innate immune response [1, 21] . Exogenous VLPs can also be taken up and processed via the MHC class 1 pathway (cross-presentation) for activation of CD8 + T-cells, which are essential for the clearance of intracellular pathogens such as viruses. The ability of VLPs to target DCs is an important advantage of VLP vaccines, as targeting of this cell type is now understood to be essential for activating the innate and adaptive immune responses. Some VLPs that resemble infectious viruses and retain their receptor binding regions are able to target and enter cells via their normal receptor and are taken up by antigen presenting cells as exogenous antigens for class I presentation. Receptor-mediated uptake has been shown to occur via sialic acid interaction with the haemagglutinin/ Phage Qbeta Nicotine E. coli [2] neuraminidase of paramyxoviruses [22] , CD4 interaction with HIV-1 [23] and while binding to cells by HCV is envelope-speciWc, the receptor involved is still unclear [24] . Stimulation of DCs to produce cytokines, such as interferon-/ , does not require replication of the virus but rather an intact envelope of either an inactivated virus [25] or that of a VLP, as shown for Ebola and Marburg viruses [26] , or an intact non-enveloped VLP, such as HPV [27, 28] . In this context VLPs may have advantages over the cognate live viruses for immune activation, because several viruses that replicate in DCs are known to block activation and maturation of the cell through expression of particular viral proteins [29] [30] [31] , and even inactivated Ebola and Marburg viruses still interfere with DC activation, suggesting a viral protein present on the virus and not the VLP is responsible [26] .",

While HBV and HPV VLPs have made successful vaccines, pathogens that directly aVect immune cells and those that successfully evade the immune system, such as HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus have proven to be more challenging. It is clear that many individuals are exposed to large amounts of these authentic viral particle for years during chronic infection without developing a fully eVective immune response, which suggests that VLPs may also prove to be ineVective even when they closely mimic the native viral structure. Some candidates may thus require adaptations in VLP design (such as particle size, envelope structure), targeting in the host (DCs, mucosal surfaces) and route of administration to achieve the desired immune response.",

Chimeric VLPs may consist of a homologous VLP platform assembled with the fusion of epitopes from other or multiple strains of the virus or additional epitopes to the core VLP structure, such as fusion of the E6/E7 non-structural proteins to the L1 capsid protein of HPV [32] . Alternatively, chimeric VLPs may consist of a VLP platform for presentation of polyproteins or epitopes of a totally unrelated virus or pathogen (e.g. HBV core VLPs with malaria or human rhinovirus epitopes [33] or inXuenza M2 [34] [35] [36] [37] ). A major limitation to some VLP platforms is the small size of foreign epitopes that can be accommodated within particles, which can preclude the presentation of large antigens such as HIV envelope or inXuenza haemagglutinin proteins.",

The eVectiveness of VLPs as therapeutic vaccines may be aided by the addition of adjuvants such as CpGs which stimulate DCs via Toll-like receptor 9, with precise colocalisation and co-eVectiveness of the VLP/adjuvant made possible by techniques such as the packaging of CpGs into the VLPs. Vaccination with chimeric hepatitis B core VLPs with a CTL epitope of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus glycoprotein packaged with CpGs was able to induce high frequencies of peptide speciWc CD8 + T cells and cure mice of Wbrosarcoma tumours with a single dose [39] . Moreover, the eVectiveness of VLPs as T cell-based vaccines can be increased when administered as part of a DNA prime-VLP boost protocol [40] . Other ways of utilising VLPs as a delivery platform is through chemical cross-linking of peptide epitopes to reactive sites on the platform. This has been done by coupling peptides containing a free cysteine residue with lysines situated in the immunodominant exposed region on HBV core particles [41] .",

Oral vaccine initiatives have also produced HBV and Norwalk virus VLPs from various plants, including tobacco and lettuce leaves as well as potato [42] [43] [44] . Ease of expression, ability to scale-up and cost of production have made yeast a popular choice, however considerations such as appropriate protein glycosylation and correct folding and assembly as well as codon optimisation may dictate alternative production systems. E. coli does not allow for glycosylation, while yeast and baculovirus are limited to high mannose glycoprotein modiWcation, and this is sometimes inconsistent. Baculovirus-driven expression of inXuenza VLPs has provided the novel challenge of separating the progeny baculovirus vector particles from the inXuenza VLPs, with both having a similar size range of 80-120 nm [14] . Mammalian cell culture systems are favoured for appropriate modiWcations and authentic assembly, but are a less controllable system and more costly for production. Retroviruses in particular also tend to include unwanted host cell membrane proteins in their envelope during assembly. Future directions in manufacturing may include approaches such as in vitro chemical self-assembly of VLPs based, in the Wrst instance, on capsid components [45] .",
