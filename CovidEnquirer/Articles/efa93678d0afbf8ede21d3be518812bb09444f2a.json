Infections with two different viral agents at the same time occurred twice: influenza A and adenovirus; influenza B and adenovirus. Multiple respiratory tract viral infections were found in seven patients with at least 5 months between the two episodes ( Table 1 ). An at least four-fold titer rise in the complement-fixation test was seen in 25 of the 29 viral infections, and in four cases the first serum samples showed significantly elevated antibody titers (Table 2 ). Influenza A virus was the most frequent serologically proven viral pathogen (11 x ), followed by adenovirus (8 x ), influenza B virus (5 x ), parainfluenza virus serotype 3 (3 x ), parainfluenza virus serotype 1 and RSV (each of 1 x ). We found no serological evidence for infections with influenza ,C virus, parainfluenza virus of the serotype 2, M. pneumoniae or C. burnetii. There was no significant difference between the age distribution of the cystic fibrosis group with and without viral infection of the upper airways (mean age 14.4* 5.4 compared with 16.0 f 5.6). Infections with parainfluenzae viruses seem to appear more frequently in younger children, whereas the prevalence of the other viral agents in the different age groups was similar to the age distribution of all cystic fibrosis patients (Table 3 ). There was no correlation between carriage of P. aeruginosa and viral infection. Viral infections in cystic fibrosis occur during the entire year (Table 4 ). Infections with influenza A and B viruses are most frequent in winter and spring in contrast to parainfluenzae viruses and adenovirus which peak during the summer period.",

We found strong evidence for microbial synergism as significant changes (at least three-fold increases of the cfus per millilitre of sputum) of the bacterial sputum flora occurred in 93% and a clinical deterioration in 78% of patients with viral illnesses.

Quantitative bacteriological examination of the sputum with the testing of the antibiotic susceptibility of the bacterial isolates is also necessary to optomize antibacterial therapy. In contrast to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, S. pneumoniae was not found. As the detection of S. pneumoniae in a sputum of a patient with cystic fibrosis is rather difficult, even with a selective procedure to inhibit the growth of P. aeruginosa\", serological studies are in progress to determine the prevalence of S. pneumoniae in these acute exacerbations. We found no evidence of significant changes concerning the number of cfus for Can&a albicans or Aspergillus fumigatus in the sputum after viral respiratory illnesses, although C. albicans was the second most frequent microorganism. There were high antibody titers against C. albicans \" The role for respiratory viral or bacterial (mycoplasma, C. P. aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis is still unclear.
