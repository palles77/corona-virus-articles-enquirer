Of note, except for the introduction of the urinary antigen tests for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella, there has been slow advancement in diagnostic methods for determining the etiologic agent of CAP over the past century. For the most part, we have relied on techniques used since the time of Koch and Pasteur-standard microbiological stain and culture methods.",

            "text": "Over the past several decades, broad-spectrum empiric therapy had become the predominant approach to the management of CAP. Most studies found that once empiric therapy was given, the results of diagnostic laboratory tests did not affect management 2-6 because the spectrum of the empiric agents was so broad that regardless of whether or not the pathogen was identified, the clinical response was uniform and often was evident by the time the laboratory results were available to the physician. As a result, microbiological testing, including sputum cultures, Gram stains, and even blood cultures became deemphasized. According to the most recent Infectious Diseases Society of America-American Thoracic Society guideline, microbiological tests are presently universally recommended for highrisk patients intensive care unit (ICU) admitted to the hospital. 7 Although numerous reasons have been proposed for a decrease in microbiology testing, the most powerful influence by far has been the rise of empiricism. 8 With widespread use of broad-spectrum empiric therapy, antimicrobial resistance has increased. 8 In addition, there has been a trend toward a significant decline in the role of the microbiology laboratory in the hospital setting. 9 In many hospitals, microbiology specimens are outsourced to other health care facilities or private laboratories, which may lead to delays in turnaround times, decreased communication for results, and loss of specimen viability. In addition, the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, which required that staff have credentials to interpret Gram stains, virtually eliminated house staff and attending laboratories located on the ward. 9",

            "text": "The ICT urinary antigen test is particularly attractive for detecting pneumococcal pneumonia when cultures cannot be obtained in a timely fashion or when antibiotic therapy has already been initiated. In serial specimens from known bacteremic cases, the pneumococcal urinary antigen detected by ICT assay was still positive in 83% of cases after 3 days of therapy. 10 This form of urinary antigen testing has the principal additional advantages of rapidity (about 15 minutes), simplicity, and reasonable specificity in adults. Studies in adults have shown a sensitivity of 50% to 80% and specificity exceeding 90%. [11] [12] [13] In one study, the use of the ICT pneumococcal urinary antigen test increased the yield of etiologic diagnosis of patients admitted for CAP from 39.1% to 53.1%. 11 Of 269 patients in this study who had no defined etiology using conventional methods, 69 (25.7%) had a positive pneumococcal urinary antigen test. The immunochromatography assay is also highly accurate in diagnosing pneumococcal meningitis (95% sensitivity with cerebrospinal fluid, 57% sensitivity with urine, and 100% specificity). 14 The disadvantages of urinary antigen testing include the cost and the lack of an organism isolate for in vitro susceptibility tests. Notably, immunochromatography is not suitable for evaluation of therapeutic effect, because positive test results are obtained for several weeks to months after recovery. Moreover, the immunochromatographic assays are nonspecific for pneumococcal infections in children, particularly the very young, as nasopharyngeal carriage of S pneumoniae can cause false-positive results. 12 In one study, the presence of azotemia was an independent factor associated with a higher rate of a positive test for patients with bacteremia. 13 The investigators suggested this may have been because of increased concentration of urine for these patients, as most of the patients had reversible File impaired renal function most likely caused by dehydration. Supporting the theory of the effect of concentrated urine, Gutierrez and colleagues 11 reported increased test sensitivity after urine concentration by centrifugation, and a study conducted by the manufacturer found that the test's ability to detect pneumococcal antigen decreased with serial dilution. 15 Thus, patients may be more likely to test positive after urine sample concentration or before intravenous fluid resuscitation. Of note, pneumococcal vaccine may cause falsepositive results in urine in the Binax NOW Streptococcus pneumoniae test in the 48 hours following vaccination. 15 Legionella urinary antigen Presently the urinary antigen is the most used test in North America for detection of Legionella. 8 Although the test can reliably detect only one species, Legionella pneumophila, and only one serogroup, serogroup 1, it has significant advantages over previous \"standard\" tests (direct fluorescent antibody testing, serology, and culture), including its relatively low cost and rapid performance. Direct fluorescent antibody stains require substantial expertise for interpretation, and selection of reagents is critical. Culture on selective media detects all but very rare strains but is technically more demanding and requires 3 to 7 days. 16 Accurate interpretation of serologic tests requires comparison of acute and convalescent specimens, which is not relevant for clinical management. The Legionella urinary antigen test is 70% sensitive and greater than 90% specific for infections caused by L pneumophila serogroup 1 and should particularly be useful in the United States and Europe, as approximately 85% of community-acquired isolates are serogroup 1. 17, 18 It may be less sensitive for nosocomial cases because of frequent involvement of serogroups other than serogroup 1. Urine is usually positive for antigen on day 1 of illness and continues to be positive for weeks. 19, 20 A recent meta-analysis by Shimada and colleagues 21 summarized the performance characteristics of the Legionella urinary antigen as having very good specificity but lower sensitivity for L pneumophila serogroup 1; thus, it is better for ruling in than ruling out disease. A positive urinary antigen test result, in the appropriate clinical setting, virtually rules in legionellosis, but a negative urinary antigen test result does not rule out the presence of disease, as 26% of patients with confirmed legionellosis have a negative urinary antigen test result. One potential \"unintended\" adverse consequence of the availability of the Legionella urinary antigen test is decreased use of Legionella culture.",

This increases the speed and efficiency of testing and reduces the risks of operator error and cross contamination. This process can be performed with faster turnaround times, allowing results to be used in a more prominent role in direct patient management. Another advancement has been the development of multiplex PCR systems, in which multiple DNA targets are assessed in one reaction without increasing the required amount of technician time. 22, 23 Some commercially available assays can measure more than a dozen respiratory pathogens. These assays may also have the ability to recognize potential dual or triple infections in the same patient. Several commercial assays, which are based on automated extraction instruments, are available (but few are FDA approved at the time of this writing) and these vary according to methodology.

            "text": "Although PCR methods have been developed for several pneumonia pathogens, the clinical utility of these tests varies. [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] There are several advantages of PCR testing methods as compared with standard microbiological culture methods in the detection of pneumonia pathogens (Box 1). PCR is a potentially attractive diagnostic tool for rapid diagnosis because it does not rely on bacterial growth or the viability of the organism. Many pathogens, including Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and respiratory viruses, can be difficult to culture because of special growth requirements and slow growth. The time required for a final result is often too long to be clinically useful in the acute management of a patient. Real-time PCR has been shown to be as effective as culture methods for detecting these pathogens. 24 PCR for specific pathogens-bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most common pathogen associated with CAP, is easily detected by PCR in respiratory specimens. PCR techniques based on amplification of the pneumolysin or autolysin genes are applicable for the diagnosis of pneumonia, otitis media, and meningitis. Autolysin and pneumolysin PCR using sputum have shown a high sensitivity (more than 80%) but a low specificity (30%-40%). 30, 31 Interpretation of sputum PCR is limited by the difficulty in differentiating between pneumococcal colonization and true infection. On the other hand, in pleural fluid, PCR detects the pneumolysin gene with a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 93%. 32 One approach that may help to resolve the problem of colonization versus infection is quantification of the target organism by real-time PCR. Yang and colleagues 33 evaluated the utility of a real-time pneumolysin gene PCR test using sputum samples from patients admitted with CAP. Of 129 patients, 23% had S pneumoniae isolated from blood or sputum. The sensitivity and specificity using real-time quantitative PCR were 90% and 80%, respectively. Of note, PCR of blood samples from patients with S pneumoniae infection does not appear to be useful. One study compared the ICT S pneumoniae urine antigen test to PCR of blood in patients with bacteremic pneumococcal infections. 34 The urinary antigen test was positive in 51 of 58 bacteremic pneumococcal cases (sensitivity, 88%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 77% to 95%), whereas PCR was positive in only 31 cases (sensitivity, 53.5%; 95% CI, 40% to 67%; P<.0001), and all of these had detectable urinary antigens. Both tests gave positive results in 2 of 51 control patients (referred to as other-organism septicemia), giving a specificity of 96% (95% CI, 86.5% to 99.5%). In 77 patients with nonbacteremic CAP, urinary antigen was detected significantly more often (in 21 patients [27%]) than a positive result by the PCR protocol (6 [8%]) (P<.002). 34 A recent metaanalysis concluded that currently available PCR methods using blood samples for the diagnosis of invasive pneumococcal diseases lack the sensitivity and specificity necessary for clinical practice. 35 To date there are no FDA-approved PCR tests for S pneumoniae.",

Despite this, PCR is increasingly being recognized as a method of choice for detection of M pneumoniae and C pneumoniae. For both of these pathogens, diagnosis has usually relied on serology, which, as indicated previously, is usually not useful to the clinician during acute medical management. One large study examined the use of real-time PCR to detect M pneumoniae in children with CAP and found that File PCR detected more cases than standard diagnostic techniques, which included culture. 42 Of significance, PCR results were available within 2 hours-a major improvement over the 2 to 6 weeks usually required for serologic diagnosis. For C pneumoniae, culture on cell lines has traditionally been considered as a gold standard for diagnosis. However, cell cultivation is technically complex, and is associated with limited viability and slow growth such that it is restricted to specialized laboratories and is, therefore, not often used. For these reasons, PCR has become an option for diagnosis. There are numerous assays described (again non-FDA approved) but with various results of test performances and significant interlaboratory discordance of detection rates. 26, 36, 37 For tuberculosis (TB), molecular techniques have been valuable. 27 Because the organism can require 3 to 8 weeks to grow in culture, molecular techniques can be useful, allowing appropriate isolation, treatment, and disease control. FDAapproved PCR assays are available, which are most useful in patients with positive acid-fast smears. A positive PCR in a smear-positive patient is extremely likely to signal TB. Conversely, a negative PCR in a smear-positive patient likely signals infection with another species. Importantly, a negative PCR in a smear-negative patient does not rule out TB.",

Thus, many cases of viral illness go undetected and the exact incidence of viruses in CAP has remained uncertain. PCR offers the potential to significantly improve viral detection. For many respiratory viruses, PCR is now the most sensitive diagnostic approach. Most clinical microbiology laboratories use reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assays to detect RNA viruses from clinical specimens. 22 This technique is very sensitive and can detect transcript from a single cell. The method uses a reverse transcriptase enzyme to synthesize a complementary strand of DNA from an RNA template. The resulting complementary DNA is then used as the template in a PCR assay.",

In a prospective study during a 12-month period (2004) (2005) of adult patients admitted for CAP, etiology was assessed using molecular methods (PCR for viruses, Legionella, Mycoplasma, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and S pneumoniae; urinary antigen assay for S pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila, serogroup 1) in addition to conventional studies (blood, respiratory culture, serology) for 184 patients. 49 A microbial etiology could be identified for 67% of all the patients.

Thus, diagnostic testing to determine pneumonia etiology can have an essential role for patient care by ensuring appropriate and effective therapy for an individual. It can also play a vital role in disease surveillance and in defining etiologic spectrum and epidemiology characteristics of pneumonia cases and deaths. With the development of rapid antigen and molecular testing methods, the clinical laboratory is no longer reliant solely on traditional culture methods for detection of pathogens in clinical specimens and more rapid etiologic diagnoses may be achievable.

Guchev and colleagues 51 prospectively assigned patients with mild pneumonia to 2 groups. Those with positive urinary antigen test results were treated using pneumococcal-directed therapy with amoxicillin. Those with negative urinary antigen test results were treated with clarithromycin, based on perceived likelihood of infection by atypical pathogens. Of 219 evaluable patients, 22% had a positive urinary antigen test result. There was no difference in the clinical outcomes of the 2 groups. Notably, 47 (62%) of 71 patients in whom an atypical pathogen was identified were in the urinary antigen-negative arm, whereas 24 (38%) were in the urinary antigen-positive arm, indicating that they had S pneumoniae in association with an atypical pathogen. However, since the atypical pathogens were determined by serologic methods, these latter cases might have represented a primary atypical infection followed by secondary infection by S pneumoniae. In such cases, it is probable that the clinical manifestations of infection that were treated were attributable to S pneumoniae, and this may explain the good response to amoxicillin alone. The investigators concluded that the urinary antigen test allowed them to administer targeted therapy with a penicillinclass antibiotic rather than a broader-spectrum agent, and added that such narrow-spectrum therapy can be more cost effective and can allow broad-spectrum agents, such as macrolides or fluoroquinolones, to be reserved for patients whose urinary antigen test result is negative. Potential cost reductions are likely to be influenced by price differences between the targeted and broadspectrum agents and by the proportion of positive test results. Also, it should be noted that at the time of this study in Russia, there was little betalactam or macrolide resistance of S pneumoniae. In addition, the study was performed in military trainees who were young (mean age, 19 years) and generally healthy. The investigators suggested that additional trials are needed for other clinical settings.",

According to the investigators, targeted therapy was associated with a nonsignificant, slightly higher overall cost (primarily because of the cost of the antigen test), reduction in adverse events, and lower exposure to broad-spectrum antimicrobials. The investigators observed no significant clinical differences in outcomes (such as mortality, clinical relapse, or length of stay in the hospital). In fact, they observed more relapses in the targeted arm. The problem with this study, however, is that the investigators did not \"target\" therapy until 2 to 6 days after initial intravenous broad-spectrum therapy was initiated. Thus, this study really did not assess the potential for point-of-care decision.

An open randomized clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the clinical impact of PCR use for detection of etiologic pathogens in patients hospitalized with lower respiratory tract infections. 54 Between November 2002 and March 2004, 107 patients were included (55 had CAP, 22 had exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 30 had \"other respiratory infections\"). Patients were randomized to an intervention group, whereby results of PCR analyses (respiratory viruses and atypical pathogens) were reported (48 hours), or a control group, which relied on conventional diagnostic tests (although PCR was run but not reported). Real-time PCR increased the diagnostic yield from 21% to 43% of patients compared with conventional tests and this was primarily because of an increase in the detection of respiratory viruses. This led to cessation of antibiotic treatment for 6 (11%) patients, but overall antibiotic use was comparable in the intervention groups and the control groups. Use of PCR was associated with an increase in cost (because of the cost of the PCR test). Clinical outcomes (mortality, length of therapy) were not significantly different. As pointed out in an accompanying editorial, the lack of a change in antibiotic use was not unexpected, given the study design. 55 Most additional diagnoses in the intervention group were of viral pathogens. Many clinicians would not be brave enough to stop antibacterial agents solely on the basis of discovery of a viral pathogen, especially given the possibility of bacterial co-pathogens in adults. Furthermore, the results were not available at the point of initial antimicrobial decision when directed therapy might be most effective. As the investigators indicate, \"to mimic real-life situations, decisions regarding treatment changes after results of PCR analysis were left at the discretion of the physician.\" Thus, there was no standardized approach using this information by the clinician. One wonders if there had been an educational process to provide strategies for directed therapy there might have been a different result. Certainly with the present influence of antimicrobial stewardship programs, the knowledge of earlier diagnosis might be better suited for directed point-of-care therapy. As stated by the investigators in the discussion, \"real-time PCR might have been more costeffective if clinicians would have been less reluctant to change clinical management on the basis of test results. Studies with protocol-based and more-rigorous patient management are needed to address this issue.\" Such a protocol is now under way, funded by the National Institutes of Health. 56 ",

            "text": "Biologic markers have been used in an attempt to distinguish between bacterial and nonbacterial causes of pneumonia. The most promising marker is procalcitonin (PCT). PCT is a peptide precursor of calcitonin that is released by parenchymal cells in response to bacterial toxins and certain bacterial-specific proinflammatory mediators (ie, interleukin [IL]-1b, tumor necrosis factor-a, and IL-6), leading to elevated serum levels in patients with bacterial infections. 57,58 PCT shows a prompt increase upon initial infection within 6 to 12 hours and reduces rapidly when the bacterial infection is controlled by the host immune system and antimicrobial therapy. In contrast, PCT is downregulated in patients with viral infections because of release by cytokines typically associated with viral infections (interferon-g). The 2 most commonly available tests are the Kryptor assay and the (Lumiphore; Brahms Aktiengesellschaft, Hennigsdorf, Germany) assay; the former is preferred because of higher sensitivity. 57 PCT has been studied prospectively to facilitate the decision of whether to use antibacterial agents in patients with pneumonia. Using diagnosisspecific clinical algorithms, highly sensitive PCT measurements have been shown to markedly reduce the overuse of antimicrobial therapy without increasing risk to patients in 11 randomized clinical trials including more than 3500 patients. 58 These studies have been performed mostly in European countries and primarily in primary care or emergency department settings. In 2 trials, clinicians were strongly recommended not to prescribe antibacterials in patients with a PCT level lower than 0.1 mg/L, but were encouraged to use antibacterials in patients with levels higher than 0.25 mg/L. 59,60 Subsequent analysis suggested the correct decision in 83%. 60 Several trials have shown that using PCT results to help determine whether antibiotics are necessary results in lower rates of antibiotic exposure. [59] [60] [61] A large (1359 patients), randomized noninferiority trial compared guideline-directed usual care with use of a rapid PCT assay to guide antibiotic use in a group of patients with lower respiratory symptoms presenting to an emergency room in Switzerland. 61 Patients were randomized to administration of antimicrobials based on a PCT algorithm with predefined cutoff ranges for initiating or stopping antimicrobials (PCT group; Table 4 ) or according to standard guidelines (control group). Use of PCT testing among the 150 patients with acute bronchitis halved the percentage of patients who received antibiotic therapy (50.0% for usual care vs 23.2% for PCT-guided treatment) with no difference in rates of adverse outcomes. Antimicrobial prescribing rates in patients with CAP (n 5 925) remained appropriately high at 91%. In addition, the mean duration of antimicrobials in the PCT groups was lower (7 days) than in the control groups (10 days). Furthermore, the adverse effect rate for antimicrobials was also lower in the PCT group (23.5%) versus the control group (33.1%; 95% CI, -15.4 to -3.8).",

Thus, using the Kryptor method, initiation or continuation of antimicrobials is discouraged (<0.10 and <0.25, respectively) or encouraged (>0.50 or 0.25, respectively) (see Table 4 ). In case antimicrobials are initially withheld, clinical reevaluation and repeat PCT are recommended after 6 to 24 hours; if PCT has increased, a decision to initiate antimicrobials can be appropriate at that time. As with any guideline and to ensure patient safety, specific \"overruling\" criteria have been established such that the PCTbased recommendation should be bypassed based on associated factors and clinical judgment (see Table 4 ).",

            "text": "Over the past decade, diagnostic tests for detection of respiratory pathogens are rapidly evolving. Immunochromatographic-based urinary antigen tests are rapid, simple-to-perform assays that can be easily developed as point-of-care patient tests. Further development is dependent on defining new antigens that can be readily detected. Molecular diagnostic techniques are becoming increasingly popular in clinical microbiology laboratories. Many of these combine sensitivity, specify, and rapid turnaround time to allow timely patient care. With the development of these methods, the clinical microbiology laboratory is no longer reliant solely on the conventional culture methods for detection of pathogens. Molecular methods have created new opportunities for the clinical microbiology laboratory to affect patient care in the areas of initial diagnosis and therapy. Over time, the methods have become more automated and the potential for clinical utility increased. In addition to providing excellent new tools for diagnosis, molecular tests will also serve useful roles in infection control and public health. 55 A critical issue regarding the clinical utility of the molecular tests will be the turnaround time. If we are to be able to use these tests for point-of-care diagnosis, it will be optimal to have results within 1 or 2 hours. However, even if the turnaround time is longer, they can still be useful for more appropriate antimicrobial therapy by allowing earlier pathogen-directed or discontinuation of therapy. Moreover, there will be the question of 24/7 availability. Will smaller community hospitals be able to rationalize the added cost of equipment and personnel to run these tests in a timely manner? In addition, the issue of laboratory reimbursement needs to be addressed, as the current reimbursement by CPT code does not adequately cover the cost of many molecular tests (of course if the test results can result in downstream lower total cost of care by shortening illness and length of stay, these costs can be justified).",
