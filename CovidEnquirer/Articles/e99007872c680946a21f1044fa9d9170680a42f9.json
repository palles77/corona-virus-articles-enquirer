Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on the best available evidence. We did a Review of the psychological impact of quarantine using three electronic databases. Of 3166 papers found, 24 are included in this Review. Most reviewed studies reported negative psychological effects including post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger. Stressors included longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss, and stigma. Some researchers have suggested long-lasting effects. In situations where quarantine is deemed necessary, officials should quarantine individuals for no longer than required, provide clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols, and ensure sufficient supplies are provided. Appeals to altruism by reminding the public about the benefits of quarantine to wider society can be favourable.",

This outbreak has seen entire cities in China effectively placed under mass quarantine, while many thousands of foreign nationals returning home from China have been asked to selfisolate at home or in staterun facilities. 4 There are precedents for such measures. Citywide quarantines were also imposed in areas of China and Canada during the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), whereas entire villages in many west African countries were quarantined during the 2014 Ebola outbreak.",

The potential benefits of mandatory mass quarantine need to be weighed carefully against the possible psychological costs. 7 Successful use of quarantine as a public health measure requires us to reduce, as far as possible, the negative effects associated with it.",

In brief, we used a combination of terms relating to quarantine (eg, \"quarantine\" and \"patient isolation\") and psychological outcomes (eg, \"psych\" and \"stigma\"). For studies to be included in this Review, they had to report on primary research, be published in peer-reviewed journals, be written in English or Italian (as these are the languages spoken by the current authors), include participants asked to enter into quarantine outside of a hospital environment for at least 24 hours, and include data on the prevalence of mental illness or psychological wellbeing, or on factors associated with mental illness or psychological wellbeing (ie, any predictors of psychological wellbeing during or after quarantine). The initial search yielded 3166 papers, of which 24 included relevant data and were included in this Review. The screening process is illustrated in the figure.",

In the same study, quarantined staff were significantly more likely to report exhaustion, detachment from others, anxiety when dealing with febrile patients, irritability, insomnia, poor concentration and indecisiveness, deteri orating work performance, and reluctance to work or consid eration of resignation. In another study, 33 the effect of being quarantined was a predictor of post traumatic stress symptoms in hospital employees even 3 years later. Approximately 34% (938 of 2760) of horse owners quarantined for several weeks because of an equine influenza outbreak reported high psychological distress during the outbreak, compared with around 12% in the Australian general population. 28 A study 27 comparing posttraumatic stress symptoms in parents and children quarantined with those not quarantined found that the mean posttraumatic stress scores were four times higher in children who had been quarantined than in those who were not quarantined. 28% ( 18 People quarantined because of being in close contact with those who potentially have SARS 25 reported various negative responses during the quarantine period: over 20% (230 of 1057) reported fear, 18% (187) reported nervousness, 18% (186) reported sadness, and 10% (101) reported guilt. Few reported positive feelings: 5% (48) reported feelings of happiness and 4% (43) reported feelings of relief. Qualitative studies also iden tified a range of other psy chological responses to quar antine, such as confusion, [11] [12] [13] 23 fear, [12] [13] [14] [15] 23, 24 anger, 12,13 grief, 29 numbness, 23 and anxietyinduced insomnia. 14, 15 One study compared undergraduates who had been quarantined with those not quarantined immediately after the quarantine period and found no significant difference between the groups in terms of posttraumatic stress symptoms or general mental health problems. 29 However, the entire study population were undergraduate students (who are generally young, and perhaps have fewer responsibilities than adults who are employed fulltime) and thus it is possible that these conclusions cannot be generalised to the wider population.",

A study 28 of horse owners quarantined because of equine influenza identified several characteristics associated with negative psycho logical impacts: younger age (16-24 years), lower levels of formal educational qualifications, female gender, and having one child as opposed to no children (although having three or more children appeared somewhat protective). However, another study 16 suggested that demographic factors such as marital status, age, educa tion, living with other adults, and having children were not associated with psychological outcomes. Having a history of psychiatric illness was associated with experiencing anxiety and anger 4-6 months after release from quarantine. 17 Healthcare workers 25 who had been quarantined had more severe symptoms of post traumatic stress than members of the general public who had been quarantined, scoring significantly higher on all dimensions. Healthcare workers also felt greater stigmatisation than the general public, exhibited more avoidance behaviours after quarantine, reported greater lost income, and were consistently more affected psychologically: they reported substantially more anger, annoyance, fear, frustration, guilt, helplessness, isolation, loneliness, nervousness, sadness, worry, and were less happy. Healthcare workers were also substantially more likely to think they had SARS and to be concerned about infecting others. Conversely, one study 16 suggested that healthcare worker status was not associated with psychological outcomes.",

The ability to communicate with one's family and friends is also essential. Particularly, social media could play an important part in communication with those far away, allowing people who are quarantined to update their loved ones about their situation and reas sure them that they are well. Therefore, providing those quarantined with mobile phones, cords and outlets for charging devices, and robust WiFi networks with internet access to allow them to com municate directly with loved ones could reduce feelings of isolation, stress, and panic. 2 Although this is possible to achieve in enforced quarantine, it could be more difficult to do in the case of widespread home quarantine; countries imposing censors on social media and messaging appli cations could also present difficulties in ensuring lines of communication between those quarantined and their loved ones.",

Reinforcing that quarantine is helping to keep others safe, including those particularly vulnerable (such as those who are very young, old, or with pre existing serious medical conditions), and that health authorities are genuinely grateful to them, can only help to reduce the mental health effect and adherence in those quarantined. 19, 33 Notably, altruism has its limits if people are being asked to quarantine without adequate information on how to keep the people they live with safe. It is unacceptable to ask people to selfquarantine for the benefit of the community's health, when while doing so they might be putting their loved ones at risk.",

Although we anticipate that many of the risk factors for poor psychosocial outcomes would be the same for larger containment processes (such as entire towns or cities), there are likely to be distinct differences in such situations that mean that the information presented in this Review should only be applied to such situations cautiously.

It is also worth pointing out that a minority of studies assessed symptoms of posttraumatic stress using measures designed to measure posttraumatic stress disorder, despite quarantine not being qualified as a trauma in the diagnosis for post traumatic stress disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5. 43 Strengths of this Review include the handsearching of reference lists to identify any papers not found in the initial search, contacting authors who sent fulltexts of papers which were not available in full online, and having multiple researchers carry out the screening to improve the rigour of the Review.",

This is not to suggest that quarantine should not be used; the psychological effects of not using quarantine and allowing disease to spread might be worse. 44 However, depriving people of their liberty for the wider public good is often contentious and needs to be handled carefully. If quarantine is essential, then our results suggest that officials should take every measure to ensure that this experience is as tolerable as possible for people. This can be achieved by: telling people what is happening and why, explaining how long it will continue, providing meaningful activities for them to do while in quarantine, providing clear communication, ensuring basic supplies (such as food, water, and medical supplies) are available, and reinforcing the sense of altruism that people should, rightly, be feeling. Health officials charged with implementing quarantine, who by definition are in employment and usually with reasonable job security, should also remember that not everyone is in the same situation. If the quarantine experience is negative, the results of this Review suggest there can be longterm consequences that affect not just the people quarantined but also the healthcare system that administered the quarantine and the politicians and public health officials who mandated it. and Newcastle University.
