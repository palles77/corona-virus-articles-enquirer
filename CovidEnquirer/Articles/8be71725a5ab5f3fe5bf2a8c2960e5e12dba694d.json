It also characterizes the delineation of roles and responsibilities within OH services in B.C. health care settings and highlights areas where improvements to current OH programs could be made to prevent and control occupational infections. Given the breadth of OH responsibilities, resource allocation in many health care institutions for these services is inadequate and roles and responsibilities may not be clearly delineated.",

            "text": "here is increasing focus on the importance of maintaining the health of Health Care Workers (HCWs), particularly in light of the aging population, 1 an aging health care workforce 2 and increasing difficulties in the recruitment and retention of HCWs. 3 Health care managers and policy-makers are therefore examining ways to effectively and efficiently maintain healthy working conditions and develop programs to improve and protect the health and safety of HCWs. 4 Protecting HCWs from exposure to infectious diseases, for example, also serves to protect the health of their patients, other HCWs and the general public. 5 Maintaining HCW health has additional advantages for health care management. Prevention of infectious disease morbidity and mortality in HCWs can potentially benefit health care management through decreased absenteeism 6, 7 and reduced workers' compensation costs. 8 It is generally agreed that the primary purpose of an OH program is promotion of employee health and well-being. 9 OH services are delivered by health care professionals, including nurses and physicians, in all industries worldwide. Ironically, OH services in the health care sector, where the target population is HCWs, have tended to lag behind OH service provision in other Sue L. Pollock 10 This is problematic considering that many HCWs are at risk of exposure to infectious agents during work, and are known, for example, to have increased risk of acquiring diseases such as tuberculosis and influenza. 11, 12 This potential was highlighted through the experience of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 in which high levels of both occupational transmission as well as nosocomial spread were noted in Canada 13 and elsewhere. 14, 15 While standard and airborne infection control precautions were reportedly instituted in affected hospitals, they apparently were incomplete and/or intermittently applied, thereby resulting in occupational transmission. 16 The death of three Canadian HCWs from SARS highlighted the seriousness of occupational transmission, and focused attention on the care of HCWs. Not only was occupational acquisition of SARS well documented, 17 it was also demonstrated that caring for colleagues as patients was emotionally difficult. 18 In addition, OH professionals felt that their role was generally undervalued within health care. 19 SARS is only one of many emerging pathogens that have appeared in recent years. Additional examples include HIV, Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, monkey pox, and West Nile Virus. 20, 21 It is estimated that some 30 novel pathogens have emerged in the past two decades, and the incidence may be increasing. 22 HCWs are at the frontline of our defense against emerging and existing infections. Therefore, proper occupational health measures to reduce their exposure to infectious diseases are essential.",

Typically, OH professionals with responsibilities for preventing occupational infectious diseases must also address numerous other occupational concerns, making it harder to assess the exact number of OH professionals needed from the perspective of infection control per se. In 2002, the Public Health Agency of Canada published Prevention and Control of Occupational Infections in Health Care, clinical guidelines to assist OH professionals, medical directors and others responsible for the prevention and management of infectious diseases in HCWs. 23 These guidelines reinforced the necessity for collaboration between OH departments and Infection Control (IC) programs in order to reduce occupational health hazards.",

For example, ICPs may be required to assist with OH duties regarding the control of occupational infections, in spite of already being underresourced for their own duties. It is increasingly well documented that policy decisions in this area of infectious disease transmission, and the content of specific training programs, are best developed collaboratively, 26 and because of their overlapping responsibilities, OH professionals must interact regularly and effectively with ICPs. 27 For example, communication about employee safety within health care organizations, and especially between OH and IC, is important in creating safe workplaces, 19 and clearly defining roles is essential. 28 Coordination of OH services with other departments that support the IC objectives can promote improved surveillance for infection in HCWs, as well as assist with exposure investigation and implementation of preventive measures. 29 New occupational infections do occur in HCWs, and it is probable that another life-threatening and possibly unknown occupational infectious disease will emerge in the future. 15 Because of the risk of population health impact from emerging pathogens, it is critical to integrate OH, IC and public health. It is also critical that an adequate number of OH professionals be trained and hired to play an effective role in this collaboration, including the integration of up-to-date OH policies and procedures into the organization's overall infection control program, consistent and timely coverage for all employees, including contract workers and medical staff, dedicated OH professionals to liaise with ICPs, and in the event of an emergent situation, OH professionals to take the lead in organizing and coordinating an employee response plan.",

It has been suggested that one OH nurse is usually needed for >300 employees with one additional OH nurse for every 750 employees thereafter. Additionally, an on-site OH physician is generally agreed to be warranted part time when the workforce reaches 1,000 employees and full time when it exceeds 2,000. 27 In another source, appropriate OH nurse staffing levels for the delivery of OH services have been identified as one full-time OH nurse for every 200-450 employees. 30 While there are no objective studies on which to base authoritative statements on the appropriate number of occupational physicians and nurses for infection control, it is clear that in B.C, as elsewhere, more resources are needed to cover training and staffing of dedicated OH professionals to work in the clinical areas of exposure follow-up and management of outbreaks. All health care employers must maintain adequate staffing of occupational nurses and physicians to prevent and manage exposure of HCWs to communicable diseases, including follow-up, 31 without diverting funds from other OH needs.",

Three HAs reported that they did not know if policies and procedures related to occupational infections were the same for contract workers as for hospital employees. This response emphasizes the importance of ensuring that consistent occupational infection standards be implemented for all groups of HCWs, including hospital employees, contract workers and medical staff. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Guidelines for Infection Control in Health Care Personnel, contractual employees must receive appropriate OH services. One way to accomplish this is to ensure that contract employers have agreements with their contract employees for the provision of OH services consistent with the policies of the facility where the employees work. 32 Providing an adequate resource base for health and safety in the workplace is the employer's responsibility. Management must allow for the necessary resources and time to be dedicated to the program, demonstrate its desire for employees to participate and be willing to accept suggestions from employees. In addition, management must be able to assess the relative merits of various programs, determine priorities and delegate responsibility. 33 The resulting benefits for the health care manager extend beyond the critical goal of a healthy workforce. Additional advantages potentially include decreased absenteeism rates, in addition to cost savings and a reduction in liability risk.",
