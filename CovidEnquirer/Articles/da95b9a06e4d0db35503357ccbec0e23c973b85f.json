A two step inactivation procedure involving sequential formaldehyde and U.V. inactivation was utilised in order to ensure an extremely high safety margin with respect to residual infectivity. The immunogenicity of this double-inactivated vaccine was characterised in the mouse model. Mice that were immunised twice with the candidate SARS-CoV vaccine developed high antibody titres against the SARS-CoV spike protein and high levels of neutralising antibodies. The use of the adjuvant Al(OH) 3 had only a minor effect on the immunogenicity of the vaccine. In addition, cell mediated immunity as measured by interferon-\u2425 and interleukin-4 stimulation, was elicited by vaccination. Moreover, the vaccine confers protective immunity as demonstrated by prevention of SARS-CoV replication in the respiratory tract of mice after intranasal challenge with SARS-CoV. Protection of mice was correlated to antibody titre against the SARS-CoV S protein and neutralising antibody titre.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome is a new disease which emerged in China in late 2002 and spread rapidly around the world. This epidemic, which resulted in over 8000 infections and almost 800 deaths, raised considerable concerns that this emerging agent constituted a serious threat for global public health. The identification of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) associated with this syndrome [1] [2] [3] humans [4] . Thus, despite the disappearance of the disease in humans, there is still an urgent need for rapid development of a safe and effective vaccine. It is generally considered that live attenuated viruses are the most effective viral vaccines because of their ability to induce strong cellular and humoral immune responses [5] . However, the need for extensive safety testing of such vaccines can delay entry of such candidate vaccines into clinical trials. Multiple studies have reported that antibodies directed against the spike (S) glycoprotein can neutralise SARS-CoV infectivity [6] [7] [8] [9] . The S protein is reported to bind to the human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (hACE-2) protein to mediate viral entry to the cell [10] . Human monoclonal antibodies directed against the S protein have been reported to reduce replication of the virus in the lung of infected ferrets and to completely prevent the development of SARS Co-V induced lung pathology [11] . In addition, a number of candidate vaccines induced protection against challenge with live virus in animal models, and this protection was associated with high levels of neutralising antibody [12] [13] [14] . Thus, it is likely that an inactivated or recombinant candidate vaccine containing the S protein will be able to induce protective immunity based primarily on stimulation of a humoral immune response.",

This development of a candidate SARS-CoV vaccine was based on adaption of this well established technology, to establish optimal conditions for growth, inactivation and purification of the inactivated virus. The SARS-CoV had been reported to grow well on Vero cells [2, 3] , so it was considered that this was probably the optimal cell matrix for rapid vaccine development. A primary virus seed was generated from a human isolate by five sequential plaque clonings. This primary seed was further amplified to generate a seed virus bank, a working virus bank and a production virus bank. The production virus was then used to infect serum protein free cultures using a fermenter volume of 100 l. Following an incubation period of 2-3 days, the virus containing supernatant was then harvested and inactivated by 0.05% formalin treatment for 48 h followed by U.V. inactivation with an U.V. dose of 20 mJ/cm 2 . Virus infection at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 0.001 resulted in generation of high viral titres (\u223c10 8 TCID 50 /ml) in the supernatant and both the formalin and U.V. inactivation steps were independently capable of inactivating this titre with a large margin of safety (manuscript in preparation). Following inactivation, the virus was then subjected to a two-step purification involving continuous flow zonal centrifugation over a 0-50% sucrose gradient followed by an ultra/diafiltration process. The results of this two-step purification procedure are demonstrated in Fig. 1 . Two lots of purified vaccine were subjected to Western blot analysis and stained with both a specific anti-S glycoprotein (Fig. 1A) and anti-N antibodies (Fig. 1B) . In addition the protein composition was analysed by staining with colloidal gold (Fig. 1C) . These figures demonstrate that the final purified bulk vaccine is very pure and contains S protein and N protein bands at the equivalent molecular weights to the infectious virus particle prior to inactivation and purification. Some cross-linking of these proteins was also seen in inactivated preparations. An electron micrograph of the purified inactivated preparation confirmed this data ( Fig. 2) with virus particles being demonstrated to present well defined spikes on the virus membrane.",

For this purpose, groups of 10 mice were immunised twice with decreasing doses of the purified non-adjuvanted or adjuvanted vaccine at doses ranging from 1 g to 0.3 ng. To evaluate the effect of adjuvantation on the immunogenicity of the vaccine, a non-adjuvanted preparation and material adjuvanted with 0.05 and 0.2% aluminium hydroxide was tested at each antigen concentration. The S specific antibody titre and neutralising antibody titre for each individual serum was then determined as described in Sections 2.5 and 2.6. The geometric mean titre (GMT) determined for each group of animals is presented in Fig. 3 . These data demonstrate that the candidate vaccine is highly immunogenic in CD1 mice. Following a single immunisation with 1 or 0.2 g, S specific antibody titres with GMT up to approximately 1:5000 for the adjuvanted formulations and 1:1000 for the non-adjuvanted formulation were measured 2 weeks after the primary immunisation (data not shown). Neutralising antibody titres were not measured at this time point. Following the booster immunisation, ELISA titres were substantially increased and GMTs of up to 1:400,000 could be obtained with the 1 g dosage adjuvanted with 0.2% aluminium hydroxide. Reduction of the dosage to as little as 0.3 ng in an adjuvanted formulation still resulted in the development of a low titre antibody response (Fig. 3A) .

The type of immune response was determined by measurement of interferon-\u2425, a marker for Th-1 responses and interleukin-4 which is a marker for a Th-2 response. For cytokine studies Balb/C mice were immunised s.c. with 1 g of antigen adjuvanted with 0.2% alum. Booster injections with the same formulation were given 14 and 28 days post primary immunisation. Mice were sacrificed 21 and 35 days after the primary immunisation. Spleen cells were isolated from Balb/C mice and stimulated with a purified recombinant S protein or candidate vaccine (see Sections 2.3.2 and 2.7). The data presented in Fig. 4 shows that substantial IFN-\u2425 and IL-4 responses were obtained after two immunisations with whole virus vaccine. However, the responses to the whole virus vaccine were substantially higher than those obtained following stimulation with recombinant S protein, after two immunisations. Following a third immunisation, the IL-4 response to recombinant S protein was increased to the level obtained for whole virus antigen, whereas no significant IFN-\u2425 response could still be detected upon stimulation with recombinant S protein. In addition, it could be demonstrated that as little as 0.1 g/ml of whole virus antigen was sufficient to stimulate substantial Th-1 (IFN-\u2425) and Th-2 (IL-4) responses.",

We have favoured the strategy of a whole virus vaccine development for a number of reasons, including speed of development. The virus grows to very high titres in Vero cells, a cell line accepted by most regulatory authorities. A similar technology used for this development has been utilised for development and industrial scale production of an influenza virus vaccine [15] . Manufacturing facilities are also in place at the appropriate biosafety level to utilise this technology for rapid large scale vaccine production. However, in addition to these technology and logistical reasons, it is also likely that an inactivated whole virus vaccine would be most efficient in inducing neutralising antibodies, which are possibly critical in preventing SARS-CoV infection.",

Although formaldehyde is reported to react with protein and nucleic acid the reactions with nucleic acid, particularly when the nucleic acid is a component of a virus particle, are less well established. Therefore we have decided to introduce a second inactivation step in addition to formaldehyde, i.e. U.V. inactivation, directed primarily against nucleic acid.

The data presented in Fig. 3 demonstrated that the double inactivated preparation was highly immunogenic with S specific ELISA titres of up to 1:400,000 being obtained following two immunisations with 1 g antigen adjuvanted with 0.2% aluminum hydroxide. High neutralising titres were also obtained following an immunisation and booster with 0.2 g antigen, with titres of approximately 1:1000 being obtained. This immunogenicity appears to be higher than that reported for other whole virus vaccines subjected to a single inactivation step, although differences in methodologies make direct comparisons difficult [20, 21] . The double inactivated vaccine was also able to induce very high antibody responses even in the absence of adjuvant. This is similar to data reported for an U.V. inactivated vaccine [21] and for a \u2424propiolactone inactivated vaccine [20] where little difference in the level of neutralising antibodies in mice was reported. The minimal influence of adjuvantation on vaccine immunogenicity was also confirmed in these studies by calculation of the E.D. 50 . There was little difference in E.D. 50 of the non-adjuvanted and 0.2% alum adjuvanted material although the 0.05% alum adjuvanted material appeared to be more immunogenic (Table 1A) . However, this was not confirmed when the E.D. 50 was calculated on the basis of neutralising antibody responses, with the non-adjuvanted material being more immunogenic than the preparation with 0.05% alum (Table 1B) .",

The use of two inactivation steps based on different mechanisms of infection will ensure safety with respect to residual infectious virus. However, it has been reported that vaccination with a feline coronavirus vaccine resulted in antibody induced enhancement of infection [27, 28] . No suggestion of such a phenomenon could be induced from the challenge studies reported here or in other studies where protection was achieved by induction of neutralising antibodies with MVA [13] or parainfluenza [8] vectored spike protein live viral vaccines. However, vaccine induced enhancement of coronavirus infection will require further study as there have been reports that vaccination of ferrets with rMVA expressing SARS-CoV S protein was associated with enhanced hepatitis [29, 30] .",
