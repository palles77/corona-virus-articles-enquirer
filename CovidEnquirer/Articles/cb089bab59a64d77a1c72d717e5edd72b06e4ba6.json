The cause for the relatively abnormal growth of tonsils and adenoids is poorly understood. Methods: Non-acutely ill children undergoing tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy (T&A) for various reasons were enrolled prospectively in a study to determine the frequency of asymptomatic respiratory viral infections in each lymphoid tissue and to relate the number and types of virus to the degree of airway obstruction. Molecular techniques were used to detect 9 respiratory viruses while Brodsky scores and measurements of percentages airway obstruction were used to estimate the degree of airway compromise due to the tonsil and adenoid, respectively. Results: Viruses were detected in 70.9% of tonsils and 94.7% of adenoids, p < 0.001. Adenovirus was the most common virus detected at 71.1%. Adenoids had an average of 2.4 viruses compared to 0.92 for tonsils, p < 0.001. Higher Brodsky scores were only associated with EBV in tonsils, p \u00bc 0.03, while greater percentages of airway obstruction in the adenoids were associated with adenovirus, EBV, corona virus, parainfluenza virus and rhinovirus, p 0.005. Conclusions: Asymptomatic viral infections are common and directly related to the degree of airway obstruction significantly more often in adenoids than tonsils.",

            "text": "Tonsils and adenoids are lymphoid organs located at the entrance way to the respiratory and alimentary tracts. Their location makes them ideal as the first line of defense against inhaled and/or ingested viruses and bacteria. The list of respiratory viruses known to cause upper airway infections is long and includes such common agents as adenoviruses (AdV), Boca virus, coronaviruses (CoV), enteroviruses (EV), Epstein Barr virus (EBV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), influenza viruses (InfV), parainfluenza viruses (PIV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and rhinoviruses (RV). Each of these viruses along with cytomegalovirus (CMV), human herpes viruses (HHV) 6e8, herpes simplex virus (HSV), human papilloma viruses (HPV), human parvovirus B19 and polyomaviruses (PoV) have been detected in tonsillar and adenoidal tissues of asymptomatic individuals [1e21] . As many as 97% of tonsils and adenoids reportedly contain a detectable virus [7, 8, 13, 18] . Co-infections with multiple types of virus have been observed. Approximately 80% of adenoidal tissues may contain multiple viruses while lower rates have been reported in tonsillar tissue ranging between 59% and 68% [7, 8, 13, 18] . The rate of detection of viruses varies dependent on the diagnostic technique utilized, age of patient, virus type as well as season of year in which specimens were collected. It is almost certain that the number of microbes detected will continue to increase over time with improvements in the diagnostic tools employed. The effects of asymptomatic infections on tonsils and adenoids remain largely unknown.",

The study was open to children undergoing surgical removal of adenoids and/or tonsils for various reasons, regardless of gender, race or ethnicity. The tonsils were removed by monopolar cautery by two the surgeons and by the microbipolar technique by the third surgeon. In contrast all three surgeons used curettage to remove the adenoids. Children with craniofacial abnormalities and bleeding disorders were excluded. Data recorded included date of birth, gender, height, weight, BMI, weights of tonsils and adenoids and reason for surgery. The diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea or sleep disordered breathing was a clinical diagnosis; however, the degree of airway obstruction was estimated by the Brodsky scores for the tonsils and percentages of airway obstruction for adenoids.

AdV was also most commonly detected in adenoids at 71.4%, while EBV was the virus most often detected in tonsils at 40.0%. Coronavirus, InfV and hMPV were not detected in tonsils, whereas EV was not detected in adenoids. In four cases, it was not possible to distinguish EV from RV. Each virus identified in the present study was detected more often in the adenoid than tonsil with the exception of EBV; however, the differences were only statistically significant for adenovirus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus and coronavirus (Table 1) . Coronavirus, InfV, hMPV and PIV were only detected in adenoids and never in tonsils.",

Interestingly, two other recombinant adenoviruses were detected in this population, as well as five samples for which the type could only be determined in either the hexon or fiber gene (but not both), making the definitive designation of type or recombinant not possible.

Adenovirus remains latent predominantly in T lymphocytes while EBV remains latent predominantly in B lymphocytes [11, 23] . Lymphocytes latently infected with adenovirus can evade destruction by internalizing surface receptors recognized by the immune cells of the surveillance system [24] . The infection state of the virus remains unclear but is presumably chronic or latent given the high rate of detection of non-replicating virus and the absence of symptoms [1, 8, 15, 25] . Latency in large DNA human pathogenic viruses has been associated with latency-associated transcripts and other evidence of a different replication state to either symptomatic or asymptomatic infections. Such investigations were beyond the scope of the present study.",

Types 1 and 2 belong to species C and are among the most common adenoviruses known to infect young children [25, 27] as was also found in the current study. Additionally, types 1 and 2 have the ability to produce latent infections [25] . * Detected significantly more often in adenoids than tonsils *p < 0.002, **p < 0.001, PIV ***p < 0.003 and CoV p \u00bc 0.002. The current study also noted the presence of three and possibly more recombinant adenoviruses. An unusual recombinant adenovirus, H15/29/F9, similar to type 56, was identified in one of the obese subjects. This adenovirus represented a recombination of species D types, the only non-C species adenoviruses in the entire study population. Two other recombinant viruses were identified and for five additional samples, the presence of recombinant elements in the genome could not be determined. Another species D adenovirus, type 36, has been linked to obesity in humans [28] . However, HAdV36 was not identified in any of the 10 obese subjects in the present report. The second major observation of the present study documents the relationship between the presence of specific viruses and airway obstruction. In tonsils, the presence of EBV was associated with higher Brodsky scores and in adenoids, the presence of PIV, CoV, AdV or EBV was associated with greater percentages of airway obstruction. Higher detection rates of viruses in hypertrophied tonsils and adenoids compared to non-hypertrophied tonsils and adenoids from children has been documented in several other reports [13, 21] . The present study provides substantial evidence suggesting that chronic stimulation of both tonsils and adenoids is associated with obstructive airway disease in a quantitative manner. The actual number of different viruses in obstructive tonsils and adenoids remains unknown but is most certainly greater than those identified in the present or previous reports. The current study was limited by the number of microbes tested as well as by the number of children enrolled. Also, the absence of agematched controls without adenoidal or tonsillar disease makes the interpretation of the findings in this report, as well as in other studies, more complicated. Future studies should explore the mechanisms underlying the persistence of asymptomatic viral infections in tonsils and adenoids in individuals with and without airway obstruction.",
