Most of the existing studies assumed that all infected individuals can transmit diseaserelated information or can be perceived by their neighbors. However, owing to lack of distinct symptoms for patients in the initial stage of infection, the disease information cannot be transmitted in the population, which may lead to the wrong perception of infection risk and inappropriate behavior response. In this work, we divide infected individuals into Exposed-state (without obvious clinical symptoms) individuals and Infected-state (with evident clinical symptoms) individuals, both of whom can spread disease, but only Infected-state individuals can diffuse disease information. Then, in this work we establish UAU-SEIS (Unaware-Aware-Unaware-Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Susceptible) model in multiplex networks and analyze the effect of asymptomatic infection and the isolation of Infected-state individuals on the density of infection and the epidemic threshold. Furthermore, we extend the UAU-SEIS model by taking the individual heterogeneity into consideration. Combined Markov chain approach and Monte-Carlo Simulations, we find that asymptomatic infection has an effect on the density of infected individuals and the epidemic threshold, and the extent of the effect is influenced by whether Infected-state individuals are isolated or treated. In addition, results show that the individual heterogeneity can lower the density of infected individuals, but cannot enhance the epidemic threshold.",

For example, during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, people adopted some simple self-protective actions after they got the SARS-related information, including reducing travel, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently, staying at home, wearing a mask and so forth. The spontaneous protection of the public, combined with some compulsory measures implemented by governments or departments of health and hygiene, effectively controlled the spread of the disease [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . about the researches on the effect of individual behavior on the transmission of disease attracted much attention [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . For example, Funk et al. studied the effect of locally spreading awareness on the transmission of disease, and they found that in a well-mixed population, the spread of awareness can reduce the size of the outbreak, but cannot enhance the transmission of threshold [18] . Kiss et al. studied the impact of health information dissemination on epidemic outbreaks, and they found that if information spread fast enough, infection cannot survive [19] .",

Besides, there are many differences between the topology structure of the information network and the contact network. However, most previous works assumed that the transmission of information and epidemic occurred on the same network but with different dynamics [20, 21] . Recently, some scholars began to study the interplay dynamics of information and epidemic on multiplex networks [22] [23] [24] [25] . For instance, Granell et al. established an SIS-UAU model, and used a Microscopic Markov Chain Approach to investigate the intertwined competition effects between awareness diffusion and epidemic transmission on multiplex networks, and they found that the threshold of epidemic depended on the awareness dynamics and the topology of information network [26] . They also extended their model to the general scenario where acquiring awareness did not imply total immunization, and analyzed the effect of mass media on epidemic transmission dynamics [27] . Mengfeng Sun et al. proposed a concrete interplay between individuals and spread of disease in quenched multiplex networks, and they found the phenomenon of oscillation in epidemic network with adaptive behaviors [28] .",

However, for some infectious diseases (like Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) [29] ), in the early stage of infection, infected individuals have unobvious clinical symptoms, and they may even not be aware of infection. In other words, they cannot spread disease-related information to others, but they can infect others. There is the other scenario, they know that they are infected through medical examination or other means, but they worry about being discriminated against or isolated, so asymptomatic infected individuals may not choose to tell others the fact that they are infected. In both cases, the asymptomatic infection can affect individuals' assessment of risk and then may make inappropriate behavioral responses.",

They found that asymptomatic infection had an important impact on the disease dynamics. However, they did not consider the dissemination of disease-related information, and assumed that susceptible individuals got disease information and took behavioral responses only when they contact with I-state individuals. In reality, individuals can get disease-related information from other individuals and take protective actions before an infected person appears in their neighborhoods [18, 31] . Moreover, most previous researches assumed that the aware susceptible individuals can get infected with a smaller infection rate than an unaware susceptible individual, and the infection rate is same for all the aware individuals [19, 26, 27, 32] . However, heterogenetic individuals [33] with different infected neighbors and perceived infection risk [34] [35] [36] [37] took various behavioral responses and their infection rates were also different. Some studies incorporated the heterogeneity of individuals' perceived risk into individual behavior response model and got some interesting results. Wu et al. assumed that individuals' perceived infection risk depended on local information, global information and contact information. They found that local information and contact information could enhance the epidemic threshold [38] . Zhang et al. assumed that individuals took behavioral response based on the number of infected neighbors, and they found that hub nodes with different roles in speeding the spread of disease and preventing the transmission of disease [39] . Therefore, it is necessary to consider the impact of the individuals' heterogeneity on disease transmission in order to better predict and control the disease spread.",

We applied Microscopic Markov Chain Approach (MMCA) and Monte-Carlo Simulations to analyze the impact of asymptomatic infection on the dynamical interplay between behavior and disease transmission on the two-layer network [25] [26] [27] . Furthermore, we extended the model by considering the individuals' heterogeneity and studied the influence of individuals' heterogeneity to infection risk on the disease transmission dynamics. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly describes the proposed model including basic model and individual heterogeneity model. We present the theoretical analysis from Microscopic Markov Chain Approach (MMCA) in Section 3. Then Section 3.2 presents the simulation results based on Monte-Carlo approach.

As described in Fig. 1 , we build a multiplex network with two layers that one is physical contact layer on where the disease spreads and the other is information layer on where the dissemination of information evolves [30] . On the information layer, we use a UAU (Unaware-Aware-Unaware) process to describe the disease-related information dissemination. U-state (Unaware state) individuals do not acquired any information about the disease, and have not perceived any infection risk. A-state (Aware state) individuals are aware of the infection risk and can transmit their information to their neighbors on the information layer. Each A-state individual transmits the disease information to their U-state neighbors on information layer with a probability \u03bb. A-state individuals lose (forget) the disease information and return to state of U-state with a probability \u03b4. On physical contact layer, we adopt the SEIS (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Susceptible) epidemiological model. S-state (Susceptible state) nodes get infected and firstly go to E-state (Exposed state) with a probability \u03b2, and then E-state individuals enter the I-state with a probability \u03c3 , and I-state nodes can go back to the S-state with a recovery rate \u00b5. The interaction between information dissemination and disease transmission is modeled as follows. A U-state node on information layer will automatically become aware and transmit the disease information to their neighbors on the information layer once its counterpart on contact layer enter I-state. Similarly, S-state nodes on contact layer will take behavior response for reducing susceptibility once their counterpart on information layer become A-state.",

In reality, individuals who have different numbers of infected neighbors perceive different level of infection risk and take different behavior responses. In addition, existing works usually assumed that only susceptible individuals adopted protective measures, and E-state individuals did not take behavioral response [30, 32, 41, 42] . However, owing to E-state individuals have no obvious clinical symptoms, most of them are not aware that they have been infected, so they will take behavioral responses as susceptible individuals when they perceive the infection risk. In this study, we assume that S-state individuals and E-state individuals change their behaviors based on the number of I-state neighbors. We adopt exponential function to describe the susceptibility of S-state individuals and infectivity of E-state individuals. If a S-state(E-state) node i has k i inf I-state neighbors, then the susceptibility (infectivity) of node i reduces to e \u2212\u03b1k i inf (\u03b2e \u2212\u03b1k i inf )(\u03b1 \u2265 0), where \u03b1 stands for individuals' sensitivity for perceived infection risk and individuals are more sensitive to the risk of disease when \u03b1 is larger. From Fig. 2 , we can observe that in the case of \u03b1 = 0.2, individuals will take strong protective measures only when the number of I-state neighbors reaches 20; however, in the case of \u03b1 = 1, individuals will take strong protective behavior as long as one infected appears in their neighbors. In this part, we focus on the impact of the individual heterogeneity on the transmission of disease. Therefore, for simplifying the individual heterogeneity model, we only consider one scenario that I-state individuals cannot spread viruses, and the transmission rate p ij between susceptible individual i and infected individual (E-state or I-state) j is shown in Table 2 .",

The parameter \u03c3 accounts for the transition rate of infected individuals from asymptomatic to obvious symptomatic. From Fig. 5 , we can see that, for high values of \u03c3 , the fraction of I-state and E-state nodes are diminished, and the onset of the epidemic is enhanced. The result is not difficult to understand. Since increasing \u03c3 means that asymptomatic infected individuals more quickly enter I-state and then unaware nodes have more chances to obtain disease-related information; As a result, the epidemic size is reduced and the epidemic threshold is enhanced. We can also see, if comparing with the left and right panels, we can also see that \u03c3 has a more pronounced influence in the right panel. Fig. 6 depicts the density of the sum of I-state and E-state nodes for different values of \u03b8. In accordance with Fig. 5 , the left panel for the case of I-state individuals can spread viruses and the right one for the case of I-state individuals cannot spread viruses. The parameter \u03b8 regulates the susceptibility of A-state nodes which ranges from 0 (representing total immunization) to 1. From Fig. 6 , we can observe that for low values of \u03b8 the fraction of I-state and E-state nodes is lowed, and the onset of the epidemic is slightly enhanced. With the decreasing of \u03b8, the susceptibility of A-state nodes is reduced. That is the reason why decreasing the value of \u03b8 can effectively suppress the outbreak of epidemic. In order to systematically investigate the effects of \u03c3 on the epidemic dynamics, we further explore the full phase diagram \u03bb \u2212 \u03b2 in Fig. 7. From Fig. 7 , we can observe that the epidemic dynamic is not influenced by \u03bb when \u03b2 is smaller Table 3. than the epidemic threshold, since the disease cannot spread out itself. When \u03b2 exceed the epidemic threshold, the sum stationary fraction of I-state and E-state nodes decreases with \u03bb for different values of \u03c3 . Overall, we can see that the epidemic size and epidemic threshold are influenced by the value of \u03c3 . With the increasing of \u03c3 , the epidemic size is reduced, and the epidemic threshold is enhanced. In addition, by comparing with the left panels and the right panels, \u03c3 has a more pronounced influence on epidemic dynamics in right panels than in left panels.",

Combined Figs. 8 and 9, we can see that the epidemic threshold \u03b2c increases with \u03bb and reaches a certain value when \u03bb exceeds a certain value for different \u03c3 . And the epidemic threshold \u03b2c increase with \u03c3 for different \u03bb. By comparing with the left panel and right panel in Fig. 9 , we can see that in case of I-state individuals can spread viruses the epidemic threshold \u03b2c increases linearly with \u03c3 , in the case of I-state individuals spreading viruses, but the epidemic threshold \u03b2c shows curve growth with \u03c3 in the case of I-state individuals not spreading viruses. The above results are in good agreement with the analytical results from MMCA approach. The mechanism of such difference between the left panel and right panel of Fig. 9 needs further investigation. Table 3 . we can find that the degree of behavior response is not strong. Therefore, the change of epidemic threshold is not large. Fig. 11 describes the stationary fraction of I-state and E-state nodes as a function of the infectivity \u03b2 for different value of \u03b1. From Fig. 11 , we can see that the stationary fraction of I-state and E-state nodes decreases as the increasing of \u03b1. But, the effect of \u03b1 on the epidemic threshold is not evident. When \u03b2 is smaller than the epidemic threshold, the disease cannot spread out through the individuals and k inf i is very small. As the susceptibility (infectivity) e \u2212ak inf i (\u03b2e \u2212ak inf i ) depends on a and the number of I-state neighbors k inf i simultaneously, so no matter what the value of \u03b1 is, the epidemic threshold almost has no change.",

We also investigate the influence of \u03c3 and the transmission rate of information/awareness \u03bb on the epidemic threshold \u03b2c in the Individual heterogeneity model. The result is similar with the second case of the basic model, as the assumption that I-state individuals cannot spread viruses in the individual heterogeneity model is consistent with the assumption in the second case of the basic model. In other words, asymptomatic infection still has an impact on the epidemic dynamics after taking the heterogeneity of individuals' perceived risk into consideration (see Figs. 13 and 14 ).",

We analyzed the effect of asymptomatic infection on the coupled process of awareness/information and disease under different circumstances and obtained some interesting results. The results based on Microscopic Markov Chain approach and Monte-Carlo approach revealed that the size of infection can be reduced once the transition rate form E-state to I-state \u03c3 is increased or the reduction factor of susceptibility \u03b8 is decreased. In addition, the impact of asymptomatic infection on the epidemic dynamic is more pronounced in the case of I-state individuals not spreading viruses than in the case of I-state individuals spreading viruses. We further extended the model by considering the heterogeneity of individuals' perceived risk. The results showed that \u03c3 still had an impact on the epidemic dynamics, and the density of infection could be reduced with the increase of individual's sensitivity degree to infection risk \u03b1, but \u03b1 did not have an obvious impact on the epidemic threshold. The interplay between the disease and the information transmission has attracted much interest, but still face many challenges. In this work, we investigated the effect of asymptomatic infection on the epidemic dynamics in multiplex networks. However, in order to simplify the model, we only considered the transmission of information/awareness among individuals and ignored the impact of other sources of information (mass media, self-awareness). In addition, we did not consider the impact of the cost of the response behavior of individuals. In the future, we will improve the model to better predict and control disease transmission.",

FromFig. 10, we can observe that the effect of \u03c3 on the epidemic transmission dynamics still exists and is similar with the effect without considering the heterogeneity of individuals' perceived risk. The stationary fraction of I-state and E-state nodes decreases significantly with the increasing of \u03c3 . But the effect of \u03c3 on epidemic threshold is not obviously compared with the change of epidemic size. Whether the disease being prevented is determined by the number of individuals taking behavior response and the degree of behavior response.
