Fractions were collected and assayed for hemagglutinin and radioactivity. The profile in Fig. 1B equilibrium centrifugation may be further resolved into (1) a fast-sedimenting peak with radioactivity but little hemagglutinin, and (2) an upper heterogeneous peak of coincident hemagglutinin and radioactivity. The lower peak, which is not usually visible, probably consists of internal cell membranes and has been observed by Pocock and Garwes (1975) in the purification of TGEV. Heterogeneity in the upper peak is consistent with the high degree of pleomorphism observed for coronaviruses (Almeida et al., 1968) . Fractions from the upper peak, which were shown by electron microscopy to contain highly purified virus, were pooled, diluted to 5% sucrose with NET, and held at 4\" for RNA analysis. Final virus preparations contained ap proximately 11 cpm/HA unit and purification resulted in a 1Cfold enrichment of hemagglutinin per unit of protein. RNA extraction. The following methods were used. (1) In the warm phenol-SDS (WPS) method (Tannock, 19731 , the viral suspension was shaken for 10 min at 37\" with phenol containing 1% SDS. The two phases were separated by centrifugation, and the extraction was repeated. After a suitable marker RNA, 100 pg of carrier RNA, and sodium acetate to 0.15 it4 were added, 2 vol of ethanol were added and all RNAs were allowed to precipitate for 16 hr at -15\". The precipitate was collected by centrifuging at 43,200 g for 30 min in an SW 36 rotor and then dissolved in a suitable volume of NET. All RNAs were stored -70\" for analysis. (2) In the SDS-lysis (SL) method , SDS was added to 1% (w/v) to a purified virion suspension, and the mixture was held at 23\" for 15 min. The RNAs released were mixed with suitable marker RNA and immediately analyzed in preformed sucrose gradients or in polyacrylamide gels. (3) In the phenol-chloroform (PC) method for influenza modified from Pons (1975) by using the ribonuclease inhibitor diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEP) in place of bentonite, the virus sample was mixed with 5% DEP, 0.1 vol2-mercaptoethanol, 1 vol PC extraction buffer, and 1 vol of phenol:chloroform",

OC-43 70 S RNA was lysed with SDS and centrifuged to isolate the RNA complex as described (see Fig. 7 legend). The profile for total (acid-soluble and -insoluble) radioactivity from aliquots of each gradient fraction reveals a sharp peak of 32P radioactivity in the 70 S region (the RNA complex) and a much larger peak of low density material at the top of the gradient (Fig. 7A) . Similarly located but much smaller peaks for acid-insoluble, ribonuclease-resistant radioactivity are seen in Figs. 2B, 5A, and 6C.

This experiment thus confirms earlier evidence that the 70 S complex is held together by weak noncovalent bonds which are destroyed by phenol extraction (Figs. 2, 3) or gentle heating (Fig. 5) . The breakdown of isolated 70 S RNA by the PC extraction method is more complete than by similar extraction of purified virions.

The latter is a complex of several noncovalently linked subunits (MW 2.5-3.3 x lo'? which are freed by heating or treatment with DMSO (Duesberg, 1968; King, 1976) . In addition to 70 S RNA, a range of smaller fragments, including a 4 S species, is present in phenol extracts of RSV (Robinson et al., 1965; Duesberg, 1968; Bishop et al., 1970a, b; Dahlberg et al., 1974) . The 70 S OC-43 complex may also consist of noncovalently linked RNA subunits which are disrupted by DMSO, but unlike 70 S RSV, are highly susceptible to phenol. The complex is more readily broken down by heating than are similar complexes isolated from RSV (Duesberg, 1968) and the TGEV and HEV coronaviruses . Its apparent molecular weight, determined comparatively by coelectrophoresis with other RNAs, is 6.1 x 106; this value is only considered to be approximate, however, since 2.2% gels do not adequately resolve high molecular-weight RNAs (Loening, 1969; King, 1976) .",

Phenol extraction of purified virions produces fragments ranging between 15 and 50 S, and a small amount of a homogeneous 4 S RNA is also present (Figs. 2, 3, 6) . A range of fragments of molecular weight 0.7-5 x lo6 and a smaller species was obtained after PAGE, similar to that described by Tanneck (1973) for IBV RNA.

Again, however, ribonucleases could not be detected, because a preparation of TMV RNA, when included in the extraction mixture, remained undegraded (Fig. 7B) . Possibly, RNA extracted by phenol from purified virions contains more secondary structure. Alternatively ribonucleases could have been present throughout viral growth, producing nicks in an otherwise intact RNA molecule and subsequently being destroyed by phenol-chloroform extraction.",

Evidence against this comes from cesium sulfate gradient experiments in which the buoyant densities of the OC-43 complex prepared by SDS lysis and phenol-extracted TMV RNA were identical (Tannock and Hierholzer, unpublished observations) . Additionally, Lowry protein determinations and 8% acrylamide gels (protein-stained) on purified RNA samples containing 120 pg RNA did not detect protein, implying that any protein linkers present must constitute less than 2% of the RNA structure. The complexing of a few small proteins to a large RNA molecule, however, may produce no detectable difference in buoyant density, as Sen et aZ. (1976) have noted for Rauscher murine leukemia viral RNA and phosphoprotein P12, with a type-specific RNA binding affinity.",
