Recently, novel bat-origin coronaviruses were found in pigs. The large number of mutations on the receptor-binding domain allowed the viruses to infect the new host, posing a potential threat to both agriculture and public health. ",

Thus, pigs are regarded as mixing vessels for IAVs. However, pigs were not known to be susceptible to bat-origin coronaviruses until recently, when two independent groups reported the detection of novel swine enteric alphacoronaviruses (SeACoVs) distinct from known swine coronaviruses (with one group successfully isolating live virus). The SeACoVs were found to be phylogenetically close to bat coronavirus HKU2 [5, 6] . This suggests that bat-origin coronaviruses may have 'jumped' the species barrier to infect pigs.",

            "text": "In February 2017, outbreaks of severe watery diarrhea of suckling piglets were reported in commercial pig farms in Guangdong Province, China. The disease had high case fatality rates (CFRs, over 35% for <10-day-old suckling piglets), and none of the animals were positive for known pathogens responsible for porcine diarrhea [6] . Instead, two genomes of novel SeACoV were detected in the ill piglets by two independent groups, and preliminary analysis showed that the SeACoVs possibly originated from bat HKU coronaviruses [5, 6] . It is currently unclear whether SeACoVs had been circulating undetected in pigs, if the viruses had originated from cross-species transmission, or if the SeACoVs were the result of viral recombination. To understand the molecular origin and evolution of SeA-CoVs, we performed a detailed phylogenetic analysis at the genomic level by using all known alphacoronaviruses and bat-origin coronaviruses which are known to cause severe diseases, such as SARS and MERS. A total of 224, 312, and 778 complete genomes from MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and alphacoronaviruses, respectively, were used. Phylogeny was reconstructed using conserved regions in genomes by the maximum likelihood method with 300 replicates ( Figure 1A) . Consistent with previous studies, phylogenetic analysis shows that SeACoVs were closely related to the Rhinolophus bat coronavirus HKU2 isolated in southern China ( Figure 1A ). SeACoV was found to share a common ancestor with human coronavirus 229E/NL63, but these viruses are distant from other known swine alphacoronaviruses, indicating their different origins. Further analysis on the S gene, which determines virus attachment, host cell entry, and 'host jump' of coronaviruses [7] , showed that domain 0 in the S1 subunit has structural similarity to that of NL63. The rest of the domain on the S1 subunit was similar to that of murine hepatitis coronavirus (betaCov) [6] . There were 11 residues of the receptor-binding domain (RBD, also called C-terminal domain, CTD) of SeACoV directly in contact with its receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) that were mutated or deleted [7] (Figure 1B) . Seven mutations (a deletion of four amino acids, and three substitutions) among the 11 sites in SeACoV were also found in [ 8 1 _ T D $ D I F F ] 229E/NL63, indicating similarities in the receptor-binding mechanism between SeACoV and [ 8 1 _ T D $ D I F F ] [ 7 9 _ T D $ D I F F ] 229E/NL63. Therefore, SeACoV may be able to infect humans and should be closely monitored. Infection of SeACoV in Vero cells (a primate cell line) will provide experimental evidence to support this possibility [6] .",

It has already been reported that pigs are susceptible to infection with human SARS-CoV [10] and MERS-CoV [11] . Additionally, the CD26 receptor sequence alignment of pigs and humans shows 94.5% similarity, which is sufficient for potential cross-species transmission [7] .

Conserved genomic regions were used for phylogenetic reconstruction by using the maximum likelihood method under the GTR + G model. The extended majority rules (autoMRE) bootstrapping convergence criterion was applied here to determine the most suitable number of replicates. Bootstrapping convergence was considered to be reached if over 99% permutations have low Weighted Robinson-Foulds distances (<3%). The phylogenetic tree was visualized using SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as the outgroup. Only bootstrap values >90% were visualized as a purple circle in the middle of the branch. The size of the circle is proportional to the bootstrap value. (B) Alignment of the receptor-binding domain in the S gene. Residues in direct contact with the human receptor for NL63 were indicated by a '+' sign. Twenty-five substitutions between bat and pig were indicated by a star. If a substitution in pigs occurred in 229E or NL63, it was marked by a red star. Sequences from bat HKU, 299E, and NL63 were indicated by a different color, consistent with those from the phylogenetic tree.
