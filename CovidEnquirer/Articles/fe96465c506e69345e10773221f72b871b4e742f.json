Despite over 20 years of research, corticosteroids remain the only available pharmacological treatment for DMD, although significant benefits and extended life have resulted from advances in the clinical care and management of DMD individuals. Effective treatment of DMD will require dystrophin restitution in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscles and nonmuscle tissues; however, modulation of muscle loss and regeneration has the potential to play an important role in altering the natural history of DMD, particularly in combination with other treatments. Emerging biological, molecular, and small molecule therapeutics are showing promise in ameliorating this devastating disease, and it is anticipated that regulatory environments will need to display some flexibility in order to accommodate the new treatment paradigms.",

Under tissue-specific control of at least seven promoters, the full-length 427 kDa dystrophin isoforms, encoded by 79 exons spanning \u223c2. 4 Mbp, are expressed primarily in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscles and brain (for review see Love et al 2 ) . The prevalence of DMD may be attributed to the high frequency of de novo mutations, which in turn is influenced by the size, nature, and organization of the dystrophin gene. Many dystrophin introns are fivefold to eightfold larger than the average human gene of 30 kb pairs. One in three cases of DMD present with no prior family history, 3 and this fact, coupled with the size and complexity of the gene pose great challenges to prevention and genetic counseling programs.",

            "text": "In 1986/1987, mutations in the dystrophin gene were identified as causing DMD, and it became apparent that protein-truncating defects led to the severe form of muscle wasting, while in-frame deletions were often associated with a milder, less progressive form of muscle wasting, Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). [4] [5] [6] Dystrophin gene replacement therapy became a possibility, but the size, nature, and widespread expression in skeletal muscle were soon recognized as major challenges. The reading frame hypothesis proposed by Monaco et al 6 holds true in the majority of cases, although there are some exceptions, now explained by altered gene transcript processing. 7, 8 More importantly, the reading frame rule offered two potential avenues for therapy: 1) Insert the dystrophin-coding sequence from mildly affected/ asymptomatic BMD patients into viral vectors and exploit these smaller payloads. 9 2) Modify expression of the dystrophin gene to remove or bypass DMD-causing mutations so that a functional BMD-like dystrophin isoform is produced. This review will focus on novel therapeutic compounds invoking avenues of intervention to either restore or supplement dystrophin and some of the potential treatments designed to modulate muscle pathology in DMD (Table 1) . Each strategy offers different targets for intervention and some may be complementary, thereby providing additional possibilities for therapeutic benefit. The greatest benefit to patients is likely to be derived from dystrophin restitution; however, not all DMD mutations will be amenable to molecular interventions, and for some individuals, therapies that reduce muscle pathology may provide at least interim benefits. We will first consider potential treatments designed to modulate pathogenic processes arising from the loss of the functional 427-kDa dystrophin isoform and then discuss nonviral approaches",

            "text": "Corticosteroids have provided the best treatment option available to DMD patients to date and have also been used in limb girdle and BMDs 21-23 despite significant side effects and the somewhat limited therapeutic value of these drugs. Corticosteroids stabilize muscle strength, 24, 25 and in the short term, adverse effects were common but not clinically severe. 26 The use of corticosteroids in DMD is common and has been proposed as the 'gold standard', against which other treatments may be measured, 24 despite the uncertainty over the mode of action. The benefits of steroids in DMD in the short term have been validated through randomized clinical trials, 26, 27 although dosage regimens are yet to be standardized. Significant impacts on health, quality of life, and health care costs in DMD were reported with the long-term use of deflazacort in uncontrolled cohort studies. [28] [29] [30] Treated boys had significantly better pulmonary and cardiac function and remained ambulant longer than untreated boys. 28 The combination of steroid administration, respiratory and cardiac management, and physical care have led to dramatic improvements in quality of life, maintenance of function, and longevity in DMD. 31 DMD children treated by multiple interventions now have a possible life expectancy more than twice than that of those born in the 1960s, 32 and the optimism that appropriate combinations of indirect treatments, with restoration, repair, or replacement of functional dystrophin, will dramatically alter the natural history of DMD is justified. With steroids now in common use, it is probable that muscular dystrophy patients being considered as subjects for clinical trials of investigational therapies, including molecular interventions, will be taking, or will have been treated with, corticosteroids. It is imperative to not only identify any contraindications to combination treatment, but also identify agents that might enhance the effects of other interventions.",

The availability of the mdx mouse 33,34 and golden retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) dog 35, 36 dystrophinopathy models has led to extensive preclinical studies on potential therapeutics. However, the lack of standardized experimental end points for the mdx mouse 37 and phenotypic variation in the dog model, 38 together with the high cost of maintaining the dogs, have made rigorous comparisons difficult. Evaluation of a number of compounds for the ability to limit the decline in muscle strength in mdx mice by Granchelli et al 39 indicated that prednisone, pentoxifylline, Tinset \u00ae , insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), glutamine, glutamine plus alanine, and creatinine all improved muscle strength. Subsequent studies have failed to confirm some of these findings, particularly when treatment duration is extended. Implementation of validated preclinical assessment in mdx mice 37, [40] [41] [42] that includes in vivo functional end points and histopathology and biochemical markers will facilitate more rigorous comparison of preclinical data from different laboratories and expedite evaluation in the mdx mouse, leading to effective clinical treatments for DMD. 42 Although the mdx mouse is an appropriate 'molecular' dystrophinopathy model, its validity as a 'clinical' model for DMD, with its mild dystrophic pathology in muscles other than the diaphragm, is debatable. This has prompted the use of exercised mdx mice, which show a typical pattern of muscle weakness in vivo and exacerbated dystrophic pathology in heart. 43 Conductance to chloride in mdx muscle is impaired by chronic exercise and responds to treatment with compounds that stimulate regeneration (IGF-1 and steroids) or impede calcium-induced degeneration or inflammation (taurine and steroids). 40, 41 Short-term beneficial effects on dystrophic pathology in mdx mice using a number of agents, including corticosteroids and arginine, have been reported, while chronic, continuous treatment with prednisone showed deleterious effects to skeletal and cardiac muscles, 44 and arginine leads to fibrosis of dystrophic heart and muscles. 45 Prednisolone treatment in mdx mice did not affect force loss during eccentric contractions or recovery of force following injury. These data emphasize a limitation of using mice as a preclinical model for DMD, because the increase in muscle strength in boys with DMD and taking prednisolone does not appear to occur via the same mechanism in dystrophic mice. 46 Payne and colleagues 47 evaluated the potential benefit from creatine monohydrate, conjugated linoleic acid, alphalipoic acid, and beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate alone, in combination, and with prednisolone in exercised mdx mice and report evidence of therapeutic benefit from the fourcompound combination therapy alone and together with corticosteroids.",

Disruption of the myostatin signaling pathway by over expression of follistatin-related gene (FLRG), 51 GDF-associated serum protein, 52 and the myostatin propeptide 51 resulted in substantially improved muscle function and increased mass in both normal and dystrophic tissue. 52, 53 Myostatin is not the only regulator of muscle growth, and it is apparent that other members of the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily influence muscle mass. Activins are also members of the TGF-\u03b2 family and are structurally related to myostatin. Both activins and myostatin signal through activin type II receptors (ActRIIA and ActRIIB) and their activities are regulated by follistatins and FLRG and by intracellular receptorinteracting proteins by novel mechanisms (for review see Tsuchida 54 ). ACE-031 is a recombinant, soluble form of the activin receptor composed of the extracellular domain of the ActRIIB receptor and the human immunoglobulin Fc region. 13 Preclinical studies in the mdx mouse 13 and studies in normal volunteers were most promising, prompting further development of ACE-031 (see http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/ show/NCT00755638).

Although the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood, strategies to ameliorate dystrophic pathology are being considered. Kumar and colleagues 58, 59 postulated that since expression of various matrix metalloproteinases are increased in dystrophic muscle, their suppression could dampen the extent of muscle pathogenesis in dystrophin deficiency. The 2-week-old mdx mice received three intraperitoneal injections per week over a 5-week period of batimastat (BB-94), a broad-spectrum peptide inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases. Compared to sham-treated controls, the BB-94-treated mdx mice were found to have reduced necrosis, infiltration of macrophages, centronucleated fibers, and expression of embryonic myosin heavy chain. Deletion of the Mmp9 gene in mdx mice significantly improved muscle regeneration, pathology and function, and reduced muscle injury and inflammation. Pharmacological inhibition of Mmp9 activity also ameliorated skeletal muscle pathogenesis and enhanced myofiber regeneration in mdx mice. 59 Oxidative stress and in particular, abnormal production of reactive oxygen species in mitochondria by monoamine Dovepress Dovepress 33 emerging therapies for DMD oxidase have been identified as contributing to dystrophic pathogenesis. 60 Thus, administration of antioxidants could, in theory, be beneficial. Pargyline, a monoamine oxygenase inhibitor, reduced reactive oxygen species accumulation along with a beneficial effect on dystrophic phenotype and muscle strength in mouse muscular dystrophy models, including mdx mice. 60 Idebenone was cardioprotective and improved exercise performance in the mdx mouse 61 and has been evaluated in DMD and Friedreich's ataxia patients.

Two cohorts received daily infusions of gentamicin (7.5 mg/kg) for 2 weeks, and the serum creatine kinase was reduced to about 50% in the cohort of DMD individuals with nonsense mutations, whereas there was no change in the cohort of DMD participants whose genes had been inactivated by frameshifting deletions. Two additional cohorts received the low dose (7.5 mg/kg) either weekly or biweekly for 6 months, and dystrophin levels were increased, with the highest levels reaching up to 15% of normal levels. In this study, there was no apparent influence of the different premature stop codon sequences on read-through efficiency, and one patient appeared to raise antibodies to the novel dystrophin protein. This study both justifies and highlights the need for continued screening for compounds to safely induce readthrough of premature termination codons. During this study, one participant in the cohort receiving biweekly gentamicin infusions inadvertently received four doses that were 125% of that intended. He suffered transient high-frequency hearing loss and was withdrawn from the study due to protocol requirements. 18 The unequivocal demonstration of dystrophin restoration in some DMD cases in response to gentamicin treatment has prompted resurged interest into other compounds, which are more efficient at nonsense mutation read-through, as well as having a lower toxicity profile. Nudelman and colleagues 77 reported in vitro studies of read-through of several different mutations using the aminoglycoside 2 NB54, which was subsequently shown to be far less toxic than gentamicin.",

Different mutations across the dystrophin gene will require specific exon-skipping strategies, necessitating potential scores of oligomers. Unlike experimental therapies being evaluated to upregulate a homologous gene [78] [79] [80] or read-through premature stop codons 15, 17, 71 (for review see Nelson et al 81 ) , exon skipping must be regarded as a personalized therapy because of the spread of different mutations across the dystrophin gene, requiring different exon-skipping strategies. DMD is considered an 'orphan disease', based on the criteria that there are , 200,000 affected individuals in the USA, and there is little incentive to the private sector to develop and market specific therapies.

If the loss of the targeted exon bypasses a protein-truncating mutation, a new protein should be generated. Mindful of omissions in early AO design, a series of splice-switching oligomer controls, including random, scrambled, unrelated, and sense strand sequences, have been evaluated to confirm that any detectable changes in gene expression were sequence specific and not attributable to the oligomer chemistry or nonsequence-specific effects. [85] [86] [87] [88] However, the concept of exon skipping is now so well established that the majority of recent reports on dystrophin splice switching do not include random, scrambled, or sense oligomer sequences as negative controls. [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] There is little doubt that targeted exon skipping, assuming it can be induced at adequate efficiency in dystrophic muscle, would reduce the severity of most cases of DMD. The reading frame rule holds true in the majority of dystrophin mutations, 6 with any discordance between the genotype and phenotype normally resolved by studying the dystrophin mRNA and identifying secondary effects on RNA processing as a consequence of the mutation. 8 Ginjaar and colleagues 7 identified a nonsense mutation in dystrophin exon 29 in one BMD family that induced different levels of exon skipping in three affected boys. The phenotypes in this family varied from healthy to severely affected and appeared to correlate with the amount of exon 29 skipping, since the loss of this exon does not disrupt the reading frame and removes the mutation. Characterization of the dystrophin gene structure in mildly affected or asymptomatic BMD individuals provides templates for functional dystrophin isoforms and establishes which regions of the protein are partially redundant. 9,94-96 Furthermore, exon skipping has been shown to occur naturally, as evidenced by the presence of revertant dystrophin-positive fibers in many DMD individuals 97 and mouse 98 and canine 99 models of muscular dystrophy. Although occurring at a frequency too low to be of any substantial clinical benefit, these fibers may contribute to the immune tolerance of induced BMD-like dystrophin isoforms. 100 The successful implementation of exon skipping to treat DMD will require careful optimization of oligomer design, evaluation, and delivery, and then perhaps even more challenging will be establishment of a product development pipeline to bring new compounds to the clinic.",

            "text": "The application of AOs to induce targeted dystrophin exon skipping was first reported by Takeshima and colleagues, 101 after detailed characterization of an intraexonic deletion of 52 bp in dystrophin exon 19, which left the acceptor and donor splice sites intact but resulted in the loss of the entire exon. In a series of experiments using different oligomer chemistries and in vitro assessment systems, specific removal exon 19 was induced from the dystrophin mRNA in artificial constructs, 101 lymphoblastoid cells, 102 and later in human and mouse cells. 86 Early splice-switching studies in the mdx mouse model of muscular dystrophy targeted the obvious splice sites at the intron 22:exon 23 (acceptor or 3\u2032) and exon 23:intron 23 (donor or 5\u2032) splice sites, as these motifs offered easily defined and crucial motifs involved in pre-mRNA processing. 103, 104 Although the donor splice site proved to be a most amenable target for exon 23 skipping, the acceptor site was unresponsive, indicating a limitation to directing AOs to obvious splice motifs. 104 When designing AOs to other dystrophin exons, we chose an empirical approach, starting with the obvious donor and acceptor splice sites and then intraexonic motifs, potential exon splicing enhancers that are predicted binding sites for the SR proteins involved in exon definition. 105, 106 Several hundred AOs have now been designed to the dystrophin pre-mRNA 84, 85 (Wilton and Fletcher, unpublished data) , and the mechanisms by which antisense sequences influence exon recognition and splicing have still not been clearly defined. Aartsma-Rus and colleagues 107 suggest that intraexonic sequences provide better targets that splice sites and proposed that the higher GC content of the exons offered better thermodynamic properties. These authors concluded that 'when designing AOs to induce exon skipping in DMD, targeting exonic sequences is most likely to result in an effective AO. There are, however, exceptions, and of course, further optimization of the AO is often required'.",

            "text": "It is unlikely that a simple formula or set of thermodynamic parameters will guarantee design of effective spliceswitching AOs, as there is considerable variation in levels of induced exon skipping, both within and between exons. AO length and target sequence were identified as important parameters in AO design, 108 while Wee and colleagues 109 reported that cotranscriptional pre-mRNA folding influenced AO-induced dystrophin exon skipping. Secondary structures were predicted, and the frequency and localization of base-paired nucleotides in an AO target site correlated with AO performance of 94% of 176 previously reported sequences. 109 In a comparative study of several different AOs to induce human dystrophin exon 51 skipping, targeting the donor splice site proved ineffective, despite extensive micro-walking and variation in AO length. 110 The exons that were difficult to remove using single AOs could often be excised by select AO combinations, 111 suggesting that many factors are involved in exon recognition and splicing. Clearly, an oligomer preparation that can induce pronounced exon skipping in cultured cells at 5 nM will be more effective than an oligomer that promotes weak exon removal after transfection at higher concentrations. 111 Clinical application will require AOs that are effective at low dosages, thus reducing treatment costs and the likelihood of adverse effects, and to date, in vitro evaluation has been widely used to select AO sequences for dystrophin exon skipping. It was recently reported that in vitro evaluation of novel AOs reflected in vivo exon-skipping activity, at least in the mouse. 112 Despite strong homology in the dystrophin genes of human, mouse, and dog, directing AOs to the pre-mRNA motifs does not necessarily induce comparable exon skipping. Although the mouse dystrophin exon 23 was readily removed after targeting the donor splice site, the human equivalent was unresponsive. 113 In this study of comparable exons in human and mouse exon skipping, only one-third of targets were optimal in both species. Similarly, Saito and colleagues 93 reported that motifs targeted to excise canine dystrophin exons 6 and 8 were also effective in cells from a DMD patient missing exon 7, although it should be noted that there was a difference in removal of exon 9 between the two species.",

AO design and evaluation in vitro require transfection with either high concentrations of the compound, as uptake is poor, or the use of a delivery agent to enhance delivery. A large number and variety of reagents have been used to deliver charged AOs in vitro, including cationic liposomes, 87, 88, 104 PEI, 123 copolymers, 124,125 cationic nanoparticles, 126 or polymersomes. 127 Uncharged PMOs are largely ineffective in vitro unless applied at high concentrations with scrape loading, 128 although delivery can be greatly enhanced with the use of a sense strand leash and a cationic lipoplex 121 or coupling to cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) [129] [130] [131] [132] [133] or an octaguanidine dendrimer. 134, 135 Although many delivery reagents have facilitated AO uptake in vitro, most will not be applicable to preclinical evaluation or in the clinic. Fortunately, we observed that uncomplexed PMOs were efficiently taken up in the dystrophic muscle after direct intramuscular injection and restored robust dystrophin expression around the injection site. 120",

This work was particularly encouraging in that large amounts of PMO were administered without any obvious adverse effects, and dystrophin was expressed throughout the body. Like other studies using similar dosages of uncomplexed PMOs in the mouse, 120,136 dystrophin expression in the heart was low or undetectable, presumably reflecting limitations of uptake; however, systemic administration of a single dose of an uncomplexed PMO at 3 g/kg resulted in dystrophin restitution in skeletal and cardiac muscles in the mdx mouse, without clear toxicity. 144 Efficient AO delivery into many tissues, including the heart, may also be addressed by the use of specific CPPs coupled to the PMO. 130 These researchers recently reported long-term prevention (7 months) of cardiac dysfunction after early treatment with a CPP-PMO. 139 Other CPPs for enhanced PMO delivery have been reported, 141, 150, 151 and this promises to be a most active area of research.

The inconclusive dystrophin staining in this n = 1 study may be attributed to several factors, including a readily available but less-than-optimal oligomer chemistry or insufficient dosage and duration of treatment to restore detectable dystrophin expression. Although this trial did not generate unequivocal dystrophin expression or demonstrate any benefit to the recipient, there were no adverse effects, and the compounds were reported to be well tolerated. 152 ODNs are typically used to downregulate gene expression through induction of RNAseH, a ubiquitous enzyme that degrades the RNA strand of an RNA:ODN duplex. 153 We previously demonstrated that ODNs induce dystrophin exon 19 skipping, 86 but only after in vitro transfection at much higher concentrations than those used for the same sequence prepared as a 2OMe AO or PMO. Although RNaseH is found in the nucleus where the AO splice switching occurs during cotranscriptional processing, presumably once the target exon is excised from the mature mRNA, that transcript would no longer be susceptible to RNaseH degradation.",

Van Deutekom and colleagues 19 reported the administration of PRO051, a synthetic 20mer composed of 2\u2032-O-methyl modified bases, on a phosphorothioate backbone designed to excise exon 51 during dystrophin pre-mRNA processing in patients with deletions of exon 50, 48-50, 49-50, and 52. After injection of 0.8 mg of PRO051 into the tibialis anterior muscle, a biopsy was taken 28 days later and found to contain a high proportion of dystrophin-positive fibers. It was reported that accurate quantification of skipping efficiencies and the meaningful correlation between levels of RNA and protein were not possible since high-sensitivity RT-PCR conditions were employed. Nevertheless, results were sufficiently encouraging to proceed with systemic administration of PRO051, delivered subcutaneously at a weekly dose of 6 mg/kg for several months. Tantalizing unpublished data has been reported, indicating low-level, widespread dystrophin expression after 12 weeks of treatment, and peer-reviewed published data is eagerly awaited.",

After comparative evaluation of several PMO sequences, including PRO051, one was selected for further preclinical development. 110 This compound, licensed through the University of Western Australia to AVI BioPharma (Bothell, WA) was designated AVI-4658 and used in a single-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study, sponsored by the MDEX consortium, to confirm proof-of-concept that DMD mutations could be bypassed using a PMO. 20 The MDEX trial structure differed from the PRO051 study in that low (0.09 mg) or high (0.9 mg) doses were administered into the extensor digitorum brevis of one foot, while a sham (saline) injection was applied to the contralateral muscle. An open biopsy of both muscles was performed 3-4 weeks later, and samples were subjected to RT-PCR and immunohistochemical studies. There was a clear dose response. Dystrophin exon 51 skipping was detected in the muscle receiving the low dose, but no protein was evident under preestablished testing conditions. At the high dose, exon 51 skipping was readily detected by RT-PCR in test biopsies from all participants, and there was unequivocal dystrophin expression as determined by Western blotting and immunofluorescent staining. 20 The The preliminary results from the AVI-4658 study were sufficiently encouraging to commence dose-escalating systemic administration in DMD participants, whose genomic deletions would have the reading frame restored by exon 51 exclusion (Table 1) . Participants were divided into 6 cohorts, each receiving 12, once-weekly, intravenous infusions of AVI-4658 at doses of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 10, and 20 mg/kg (Muntoni, personal communication). Data indicate that exon skipping was induced in dose-dependent manner, and apart from one individual receiving 2 mg/kg who was found to be a 'strong' responder, all other participants receiving up to 4 mg/kg had transcripts missing exon 51, but protein was not detected. All boys receiving 10 or 20 mg/kg showed strong exon skipping by RT-PCR, and dystrophin expression was readily detectable in three out of four boys in each cohort. One boy from each of these cohorts had considerably higher dystrophin expression than the others who were deemed to be 'strong responders'. In summary, seven patients had unequivocally increased dystrophin expression after comparing pre-and posttreatment biopsies (Muntoni, personal communication). An extension to the MDEX study has not been offered to the participants at this stage (see http://www. actionduchenne.org/ duchennepedia/article/229/ recent-avi-4658-trial-results-), which is unfortunate considering the positive outcomes in terms of dystrophin expression at the higher doses of AVI-4658. One of the most attractive features of the PMO chemistry is that these compounds appear to be very well tolerated, with no PMO-related effects on cardiovascular, respiratory, global neurological, renal, or liver parameters after administration of the maximum feasible dose (320 mg/kg) in cynomolgus monkeys. 159 Both the mouse and the canine models of muscular dystrophy have received different PMOs at substantial dosages of 200 mg/kg in the GRMD animal 149 and 3 gm/kg in the mdx mouse. 144 Dystrophin expression was restored without overt toxicity; however, the consequences of long-term exposure at these dosages are yet to be established.",
