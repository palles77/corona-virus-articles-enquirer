Children are less commonly infected than adults, they have milder disease, are less infectious and present with non-specific clinical features. However, severe illness can develop in adolescents and young infants. 1,2 Detailed infection control guidances on SARS have been prepared by WHO, US Center for Disease Control, Health Canada, Health Protection Agency of UK, Ministry of Health Singapore, CDC of China, CDC of Taiwan and the Hospital Authority of Hong Kong. A comprehensive review and account of infection control measures will not be attempted. This article makes special reference to children, is based on personal experience and on local systems developed in Hong Kong. It may need modifying to suit local situations and will need to be updated as new knowledge arises.",

Using mathematical and statistical models it was estimated that 71.1% and 74.8% of SARS infections in Hong Kong and Singapore were attributable to super-spreading events. 5 It is not known whether the route of transmission affects the incubation period. PAEDIATRIC Summary The recent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak has almost mandated a re-evaluation of infection control practices in hospitals, clinics, schools and domestic environments, especially for patients with respiratory tract symptoms. Triage, early case detection followed by prompt isolation and quarantine are major preventive measures. Respiratory tract infections are the most common childhood illnesses and paediatric SARS poses special problems in diagnosis because of its non-specific presentation. The main lessons learnt from the outbreak were: (1) despite well established guidelines on infection control precautions, poor understanding of underlying principles and deficiencies in compliance are common among healthcare professionals, especially during emergencies; (2) even a slight lapse can be fatal; and (3) over-protection can be counterproductive. Hence it is important to: (1) be protected to protect others; (2) be vigilant and prepared for emerging infections; (3) be proficient and scrupulous in infection control measures; (4) be apposite and practical on personal protective equipments to ensure sustainability; and (5) be dutiful and prompt in informing of potential threats and work closely with others. \u00df 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

Viral excretion in NPA and stool peaked on days 12-14 but viral load in NPA specimen was at two orders of magnitude lower than viral excretion in stools. Hence, respiratory specimens including nasopharyngeal aspirates, throat swabs or sputum samples were the most useful clinical specimens in the first 5 days of illness, after this stools would be the best choice. 6 Infectivity is greatest in the second week of the illness, including those with severe illnesses, but patients can be infective within the first 1-2 days. There is no reported instance of transmission before the onset of symptoms of the disease and transmission after the second week of illness is rare.",

Large droplets do not travel far and usually settle within 2 metres but droplets of 3 mm can stay in the air for 3 h. With forced ejection a good portion of these droplets can be evaporated rapidly, especially under low humidity and they may suspend in air longer. Using fluorescentstained water, it was demonstrated that toilet seats had significant contamination by droplets after flushing and the aerosol effect can be up to the standing height of a child. 7 Huge amounts of submicron (0.3-0.5 mm) aerosols can be generated from drainage flow, in the order of 60 000 per litre of air in the domestic sewage drainage system of high rises, suggesting that airborne transmission is possible from the empty U-traps and pipes leaking and containing infectious agents. 8 ",

The role of faecal-oral transmission is unknown but is probably of some significance as profuse watery diarrhoea is common and large amounts of virus are found in stool.

Pneumonia developed in six, two had mild illness and one remained asymptomatic. 16 The emergency department is a high-risk area because of its nature of trauma, heavy workload, crowded environment and lack of isolation facilities. There were at least two outbreaks in community clinic settings in Hong Kong. In one, a nurse was first infected by a SARS patient attending the clinic and subsequently infected two other nurses, the doctor and his wife. In the second, a doctor was found to be infected on contact tracing of a household cluster of four SARS cases. On further case tracing two more of the doctor's patients were found to be infected. 17 Despite great concerns, compliance to infection control precautions by community general practitioners in Hong Kong lagged behind their hospital counterparts -97.7% had not worn masks at all times, a third did not wash their hands after seeing/examining a patient and half did not wear gowns. Three-quarters did not wear goggles during patient encounters, just over half insisted patients wore masks during their consultation and over 10 doctors (12.4%) who were diagnosed with suspected or probable SARS had closed their clinics. 18 However, the sample size is small and may not be representative of community doctors in Hong Kong. Healthcare workers (HCWs) working in small clinics are of particular concern because of their small size and lack of adequate decontamination facilities and a good ventilation system. Ingenious designs have been developed by some to overcome this.",

However, it should be noted that negative pressure rooms only prevent the virus from travelling outside the room and may not reduce viral load or environmental contamination inside the room. Several designs such as low level suction and laminar flow have tried to reduce the viral load inside the room but the effectiveness is unproven. 43 Various devices such as portable/mobile local exhaust ventilation devices, tents and personal isolation systems have been designed and tested but the usability, risk of contamination of staff and effectiveness are still under study. 44, 45 A rethink on the best design for effective infection control which also improves clinical and psychological care of patients is very much needed. No matter how good the design this cannot replace preparedness, a good clinical routine and appropriate personal protection.",
