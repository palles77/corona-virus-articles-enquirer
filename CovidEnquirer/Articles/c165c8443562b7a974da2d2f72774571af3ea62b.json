            "text": "Like other portions of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract with which it shares embryologic origin, the stomach consists of a tunica muscularis, submucosa, muscularis mucosa, and an innermost mucosa. Almost all of the histologic lesions of clinical significance arise within the mucosa, so endoscopic biopsies are preferred to full thickness biopsies for investigation of almost all gastric diseases. The only exceptions are those that seem restricted to the submucosa or tunica muscularis based on ultrasonographic evaluation (i.e., suspected smooth muscle tumors, pythiosis, and pyloric muscular hypertrophy). The advantages of endoscopic biopsies over full thickness samples have been described elsewhere, but from the perspective of the pathologist the advantages are the greater number of samples that can be taken and the ability to specifically sample abnormal mucosa. The small size and limited depth of the samples are not usually problematic.",

Because the stomach is adapted primarily for secretion rather than absorption, and because its acid environment does not permit much of a resident bacterial population, the leukocyte population is less than is found in the more distal portions of the GI tract. That should make detection of changes in leukocyte numbers easier than elsewhere in the GI tract. That same inhospitable environment also means that there are few infectious causes of gastritis compared with the numerous viral, bacterial, and protozoal diseases of the small and large intestine.",

Most proximal is the cardia, which surrounds the entry of the esophagus into the stomach, and most distal is the pyloric antrum leading to the sphincter that separates the stomach from the duodenum. In between, and occupying about two-thirds of the stomach, is the gastric body. The gastric fundus is an outpouching of the gastric body at its proximal end where it joins the cardia. This nomenclature is not absolutely standardized, and many authors refer to the combined fundus and body as the \"fundic region\" and habitually refer to biopsies from this region as being from \"fundic mucosa.\" 1, 2 Each of these regions has distinctive histologic appearance, but the transition from one portion to the other is not abrupt and in some biopsies the mucosa has an appearance intermediate between one region and the other.",

In all regions, the mucosa is divided into three horizontal zones. In the fundic/body region, the deepest 60% to 80% of the mucosa is occupied by densely packed branched glands consisting of mucusproducing cells and a variety of secretory cells. The glands are connected to the luminal surface by a narrow neck known as the foveola. In contrast to the more distal portions of intestine, the germinal population for all of the gastric epithelium lies at the junction between the glands and the foveolae, a region known as the isthmus, rather than at the base of the glands (Fig. 29-1 ). These germinal cells migrate upward to replenish the mucus neck cells and surface epithelium, and downward to repopulate the glands as part of normal mucosal turnover and in the event of unexpected epithelial loss. The overall mucosal turnover time is 4 to 5 days-a time that dictates the speed of wound healing, and the rate at which shallow ulcers disappear. The risk of a false-negative biopsy result when investigating episodic gastric disease has not been sufficiently emphasized.",

The regenerating epithelium is flatter and more basophilic, with little mucus and slight irregularity in orientation of the nucleus (Fig. 29-3 ). Shallow ulcers heal completely within just a few hours. The adjacent superficial lamina propria will usually have at least some edema and perhaps even hemorrhage, but the leukocytic reaction is usually minimal. A few neutrophils may be found in the very superficial lamina propria or intermingled with some fibrin and mucus filling in the ulcer.

Mineralization of submucosal blood vessels may become extensive, involving the full thickness of the vessel wall and accompanied by medial necrosis and endothelial destruction. 9 With ischemic injury related to vasculitis or vascular occlusion, the character of the lesion depends on the duration and completeness of obstruction. In gastric volvulus, venous obstruction is complete and the intensely congested gastric wall dies following infarction. The mucosa dies first, undergoing coagulation necrosis that quickly becomes lost amid diffuse hemorrhage.

To many, gastritis is defined simply as an increase in the number of leukocytes within the lamina propria beyond the normal range. The most obvious problem with this definition is that we do not know the normal range. Less obvious but even more fundamental is the question of whether an increase in leukocytes within a tissue designed to respond to antigenic challenge by increasing the number and activity of resident leukocytes should be interpreted as \"inflammation.\" An increase in lymphocytes or plasma cells in a lymph node is usually assumed to reflect an appropriate and purposeful response to antigenic stimulation. In the intestinal lamina propria, the largest lymphoid organ in the body, a similar increase in lymphocytes and plasma cells is generally viewed as pathologic and therefore deserving of therapeutic intervention. The distinction between adaptive and pathologic lymphoid proliferation lies not just in the number of leukocytes, but also in the phenotype and cytokine production profile of the cells.

In most cases, lymphocytes and plasma cells predominate, but there are almost always at least some eosinophils. Neutrophils are rarely present, but their presence almost always means nearby or recent ulceration. There may be a concurrent increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes, and in cats there can be an increase in intraepithelial large granular lymphocytes (formally known as globular leukocytes) that are of unknown significance. Edema accompanies the leukocytes and there is often activation of resident fibroblasts and blood vessels (Figs. 29-8 and 29-9) . It has been traditional to describe the predominant cell type (lymphocytic, plasmacytic, eosinophilic) as part of the classification system, but there is no evidence that this is useful. 7, 14, 24 First, there is no uniformity between laboratories in how well eosinophils, mast cells, or even plasma cells are stained. Second, pathologists differ in defining what proportion of cells is required before that cell type is considered \"predominant.\" Some will diagnose a lesion as \"eosinophilic\" if they believe that the eosinophils are the most numerous cells entering the tissue on an hourly basis, even if they are outnumbered by lymphocytes or plasma cells that have accumulated over weeks and months. Others use a more traditional approach and name the lesion based on the cell type that is most numerous within the tissue at the time of assessment. That means that almost any chronic gastritis will be classified as \"lymphoplasmacytic.\" Until everyone uses the same convention for naming such lesions, subclassification based on the predominant cell type will remain unreliable. It makes more sense to simply list each identifiable cell type as a percentage of the total infiltrate, so that such information can later be analyzed to see if it influences therapeutic response or other clinical parameters.",

The results from the eight \"normal\" dogs were not separately identified when tabulating the results (presented as the mean grading results from all 26 dogs). 13 The second and much larger study provided not only a series of pictorial templates, but also a brief text to guide the grading of GI biopsies, including those from stomach. It included pictorial templates for leukocyte accumulations, fibrosis, ulceration, and other parameters within the fundic and antral mucosa. 14 In both of these latter studies in which the pictorial templates were specifically designed to reduce interobserver variation, the results showed poor correlation among grading scores assigned by different pathologists. Painful though it is, we must collectively confront the reality that it is essentially impossible to compare results from different studies claiming to evaluate causation or therapy of \"gastritis.\" In most published studies of gastritis in either dogs or cats, the descriptions of leukocyte numbers or the published photographs of lesions claimed to represent mild and even moderate gastritis would be considered \"normal\" using criteria in the three studies listed previously.

The elongation of the foveolae may be so marked that a routine endoscopic biopsy will capture only the surface and foveolar epithelium and none of the underlying pyloric glands.

Even if one were to accept the hypothesis that colonization by Helicobacter causes a small increase in mucosal leukocytes (including lymphofollicular hyperplasia), the most plausible explanation is that the Helicobacter simply represent an increased antigenic challenge to the resident mucosal leukocytes that respond in an entirely appropriate fashion, analogous to what occurs when gnotobiotic animals are first introduced to a \"normal\" bacterial flora. 31",

It is unknown whether the eosinophils are involved in the development of the lesion, are the result of the lesion, or are unrelated. The prevalence of these lesions is directly related to the frequency of endoscopy and many are clinically silent. They become significant only if they grow large enough and if they are located where they may cause pyloric obstruction. The diagnosis is difficult to confirm in endoscopic samples. If orientation and depth are both perfect, then the diagnosis is based on seeing the biopsy filled with superficial and foveolar epithelium with no glands because the increased thickness of the foveolar region occupies the entire capacity of the biopsy forceps ( Fig. 29-12) .",

In part this is because smooth muscle tumors are usually small and affect tunica muscularis only, so the majority do not cause clinical signs and cannot be detected endoscopically. Estimates of prevalence therefore differ in studies based on clinical signs as contrasted with postmortem studies. 42, 43 Further confusion arises from the fact that many of those tumors initially classified as leiomyosarcomas based on traditional histopathology have been reclassified as gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) on the basis of immunohistochemistry (positive for CD117, negative for smooth muscle actin). 44, 45 Those papers addressed small intestinal, cecal, and colonic tumors rather than specifically looking at those in stomach, and in addition specifically addressed smooth muscle tumors initially diagnosed as poorly differentiated leiomyosarcomas rather than more common, mature leiomyomas. It is therefore a mistake to assume that all tumors previously diagnosed as well-differentiated smooth muscle tumors are at risk of having that diagnosis \"overturned\" by immunohistochemistry.",

The more information that the pathologist has concerning the clinical presentation and suspected differentials, the more likely an informative and helpful report will ensue. A final consideration is that the microscopic interpretation of intestinal biopsies (particularly endoscopic samples) is not a simple procedure. There is considerable interobserver variation in assessment of intestinal biopsies between different pathologists. 71 The WSAVA Gastrointestinal Standardization Group has proposed that intestinal biopsies should be evaluated in a systematic way using a \"tick-box\" list that encourages the pathologist to examine and record all of the salient aspects of the samples. 11 In this way, the clinician can be ensured that all relevant components of the tissue were examined, even if they were histologically normal. Most initial microscopic evaluation will be done with sections stained by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), but the pathologist should be able to follow this up where required with other histochemical stains (e.g., for identification of some infectious agents, for delineation of collagen in fibrosis). 10 It is also now generally possible for the pathologist to request immunohistochemical labeling, particularly in the case of phenotypic identification of round cell or stromal tumors. Clinicians should always develop a close working relationship with their deep to include the entire mucosa to the level of muscularis mucosa ( Fig. 29-14) . The diagnostic value of biopsies that comprise only individual villi that are \"scythed\" from the surface is severely limited (Fig. 29-15 ).",

While cats also have more T cells in the villus (compared with cryptal) lamina propria, there is only enrichment of IgM and IgA plasma cells within cryptal lamina propria-with equal numbers of IgG plasma cells in villus and cryptal lamina. Also in contrast to the dog, cats have increasing numbers of T cells from duodenum to ileum, and an increase (as opposed to a decrease) in IgA plasma cells from anterior to distal small intestine. The two most striking differences between these species lies with epithelial expression of class II molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and with the numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) (Fig. 29-18 ). Whereas dogs display constitutive epithelial expression of MHC class II, the normal feline enterocyte layer is devoid of this molecule. 20, 66 Additionally, cats have significantly more IELs than dogs, with an increasing number of these cells from duodenum to ileum (there is no anatomical difference in the dog). The majority of feline IELs are CD8 + (with an \u03b1\u03b1 homodimer) 52 and express the \u03b1E integrin that likely mediates their interaction with the epithelium. 73 It has been suggested that some of these changes may reflect the relatively greater number of microbial flora that are proposed to lie within the small intestinal lumen of the cat. 32, 45 Inflammatory Disease of the Small Intestine",

The first two of these are also well-recognized in the cat. These disorders likely share elements of pathogenesis relating to the interaction between the intestinal immune system and bacterial or food antigens, and there is probably a pathologic continuum with overlap between the three entities. 23 A range of canine breed-associated enteropathies (e.g., those affecting Irish Setters, 50 soft-coated Wheaten Terriers, 61 Norwegian Lundehunds, 14 and Basenjis 4 ) also likely fits within this pathologic spectrum.

The morphologic criteria that define small intestinal inflammation include villus stunting and fusion , epithelial injury, crypt dilation, distention or abscessation , lacteal dilation, and fibrosis. The types of inflammatory infiltrate that may occur are lymphoplasmacytic, eosinophilic, or neutrophilic ( Fig. 29-21 ). Mixtures of these three types of response may also occur. Additionally, assessment of the IEL count is an important component of such evaluation, as elevation of IELs may occur in these inflammatory disorders.",

One example of such change is that which accompanies parvovirus infection of the cryptal epithelia. The hallmark features of parvoviral enteritis in dogs and cats are extreme villus atrophy, crypt dilation, and distention, with characteristic epithelial necrosis and bizarre squamoid morphology of surviving cells, and minimal lamina propria inflammation . 5, 64 Later in the course of disease there may be crypt hypertrophy as a consequence of compensatory crypt epithelial hyperplasia/ regeneration. Feline leukemia virus has been proposed as a cause of cryptal necrosis similar to that caused by parvovirus. By contrast, feline (and canine) coronavirus enteritis causes loss of enterocytes from the tips of villi rather than affecting the crypts. Antigen from all three feline viruses may be identified within intestinal tissue by immunohistochemistry. 34 Crypt epithelial proliferation and mucosal erosion may occur in young pups with Campylobacter enteropathy and these bacteria may be identified within the crypt epithelial cell cytoplasm. 12 By contrast, in canine peracute hemorrhagic gastroenteritis (most often affecting young animals of toy and miniature breeds and suggested to have clostridial etiology; Clostridium perfringens type A) there is hemorrhagic necrosis of the mucosa with sparing of the crypts. In both dogs and cats, clinical disease and intestinal pathology associated with \"attaching and effacing\" hallmark of the entity termed lymphangiectasia, in which there is \"ballooning\" dilation of the lacteals accompanied by lamina propria edema and loss of lymphatic fluid (and associated cells and protein) into the intestinal lumen (protein-losing enteropathy) ( Fig. 29-22 ). Affected villi are generally blunt. Lymphatic vessels in the submucosa, muscularis, serosa, and mesentery may also be dilated. Lymphangiectasia is recognized in the dog and may be a congenital developmental disorder or be acquired secondary to occlusion of lymphatic outflow by inflammatory or neoplastic processes. 37, 58 Increased lamina propria cellularity is described in some cases, and specific elevation in the numbers of IgG plasma cells has been (e.g., the southern United States), granulomatous enteritis caused by the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum is prevalent in dogs. 7 Canine histoplasmosis most commonly affects the ileum and colon and organisms are prominent within the cytoplasm of infiltrating macrophages ( Fig. 29-26 ). Hemorrhagic granulomatous enteritis may also occur in canine \"salmon poisoning\" in which dogs ingest salmon infected by the fluke Nanophyetus salminicola, which transmits the causative rickettsial organism Neorickettsia helminthoeca. Granulomas with prominent eosinophil infiltration may surround fragments of migrating Toxocara canis in the intestine of young dogs with poor husbandry. This change is generally considered an incidental finding, but has been termed canine multifocal eosinophilic gastroenteritis. The attachment of hookworms to the small intestinal mucosa may also induce local tissue damage related to the ingestion of blood by the parasite. Tapeworms also attach to the intestinal mucosa, but they generally have minimal clinical significance for the host. Although primarily a colonic infection, Tritrichomonas foetus may also infect and induce inflammation in the ileum of cats. Small intestinal giardiasis is not uncommon in young dogs and cats, but the Giardia organisms produce little intestinal pathology other than damage to the enterocyte microvillus border.",

These tumors may be of epithelial, mesenchymal, or hemopoietic origin. A frequent small intestinal neoplasm is alimentary lymphoma, which may concurrently involve other regions of the GI tract or mesenteric lymph nodes. Alimentary lymphoma is the most common tumor of the small intestine in cats. With the advent of successful vaccination and testing programs for feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection there has been a change in the epidemiology of feline lymphoma. This disease now occurs principally in an older cohort of cats, is more likely to be unassociated with FeLV infection, and most frequently has alimentary Escherichia coli (AEEC) is recognized but in many cases other concurrent intestinal pathogens are identified. 65 A further specific example of a relatively common small intestinal inflammatory lesion is that which accompanies FIP virus infection. In this instance, the pathology is generally serosal (rather than mucosal) and characterized by the presence of vasculocentric pyogranulomatous reactions thought to be initiated by the deposition of antigen-antibody immune complexes ( Fig. 29-24 ). Granulomatous enteritis secondary to mycobacterial infection may also occur in cats and dogs following ingestion of unpasteurized bovine milk or infected small rodent prey ( Fig. 29-25 ). In certain geographical areas have characterized the majority of feline alimentary lymphomas as being T-cell in phenotype (some of which may be epitheliotropic), but B-cell lymphoma or mixed phenotype tumors also occur. 40, 68 By contrast, other studies report a dominance of B-cell lymphoma affecting the feline alimentary tract. 17 There is no clear evidence that immunophenotype is associated with survival time for feline alimentary lymphoma. 46 The greatest challenge in the diagnosis of feline alimentary lymphoma is distinguishing early incipient neoplasia from chronic lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory disease. It is well-recognized that lymphoplasmacytic enteritis may progress to alimentary lymphoma in the cat, as is also documented for human patients with celiac disease. 2, 38, 40 The microscopical distinction between lymphoid inflammation and neoplasia is very difficult, but adjunct tests such as immunohistochemistry or molecular \"clonality testing\" increasingly have been shown to have a role in determining whether an infiltrating population of lymphocytes is clonal (and therefore neoplastic). 40, 69 Although canine alimentary lymphoma shares gross and microscopic features with the feline disease, there is no evidence for a specific etiologic agent. Canine alimentary lymphoma most commonly arises within the small intestine. The lesions may be diffuse or nodular and involve a number of segments of the gut. There are fewer data on the immunophenotype or molecular rearrangements of canine alimentary lymphomas (epitheliotropic T-cell lymphomas are more common than B-cell, mixed, or null cell tumors), and although a transition from lymphoplasmacytic enteritis to lymphoma is suggested to occur in the dog, this has not been well characterized. 15 In one retrospective study of 44 cases of GI lymphoma (of which 29 involved the small intestine) there were more CD3 + T-cell tumors (n = 33) than either CD20 + B-cell tumors (n = 3) or tumors expressing neither marker (n = 8). The T-cell tumors were invariably epitheliotropic. 8 Canine alimentary T-cell lymphoma may be accompanied by a significant infiltration of eosinophils, a state that must be distinguished from intestinal mast cell tumor. 42",

Three distinct morphologic/phenotypic variants are described: small-cell lymphocytic villus lymphoma, large-cell or lymphoblastic lymphoma, and large granular lymphoma. Small-cell lymphocytic villus lymphoma affects older cats and begins as an accumulation of small T lymphocytes at the base of the villus. These cells gradually extend throughout the lamina propria and into the epithelium, and eventually the infiltrate becomes transmural. 6 Large-cell (lymphoblastic) lymphoma affects cats of any age and is a more aggressive, rapidly progressing, transmural tumor that forms nodular masses and metastasizes to mesenteric lymph nodes. At least a proportion of these tumors are of the B-cell phenotype. Large granular lymphoma is an aggressive metastatic form of disease involving large epitheliotropic lymphocytes with distinctive eosinophilic cytoplasmic granules that contain the molecule perforin immunohistochemically. 9, 33 This finding suggested that these cells may be either cytotoxic T lymphocytes or natural killer (NK) cells, but further phenotypic investigation revealed that they are CD3 + and also express a CD8\u03b1\u03b1 homodimer, and are therefore likely to be intraepithelial T lymphocytes. 51 These large granular lymphocytes are also considered to be the same population as \"feline globular leukocytes.\" Recent immunophenotypic studies ",

These lesions are an important differential for carcinoma and distinguishing between these tumors may require immunohistochemical or electron microscopic evaluation. Grossly, carcinoids may be annular stenosing or nodular in appearance. They display similar infiltrative and metastatic behavior to adenocarcinomas. The histologic pattern is of nests or cords of cells packeted by fine bands of connective tissue stroma. The neoplastic cells have a granular, eosinophilic cytoplasm and label positively for synaptophysin and chromogranin by immunohistochemistry. 54 The normal canine colonic mucosa is made up primarily of straight cylindrical crypts oriented perpendicular to the underlying muscularis mucosa. The crypts lie against each other, surrounded by a cell-poor lamina propria populated by stromal cells, vessels, and a sparse population of lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils, and mast cells. The base of each crypt is separated from the muscularis mucosa by no more than four cellular layers, in which eosinophils are often prominent. In dogs, crypt length varies from 400 to 600 \u00b5m, and in two-dimensional histologic sections consists of two parallel columns each with about 100 simple columnar epithelial cells. The lining of the superficial three quarters of the crypts appears dominated by goblet cells, but in fact the crypts are populated by a mixture of goblet cells, neuroendocrine cells, columnar absorption of epithelium, and germinal basal cells. Goblet cells are claimed to account for only approximately 10% of the total, but the distended mucus goblets often seem to crowd out the other cells and in routine histologic sections create the visual impression of an almost pure goblet cell population (Fig. 29-29 ). The number of recognizable Rare examples of degeneration and inflammation of the muscularis (visceral myopathy) are reported, but the pathogenesis of this disorder is poorly understood. 26 Dysautonomia is recognized in both the cat (Key-Gaskell syndrome) and dog. 25, 56 The etiology of this condition is uncharacterized but the clinical presentation may include constipation and ileal impaction. Characteristic lesions are present within the neurons of autonomic ganglia, including those of the myenteric plexus. These cells may be hypereosinophilic and shrunken with nuclear pyknosis or karyorrhexis. Cytoplasmic vacuolation and lack of Nissl granules is reported, and the surrounding stroma may contain mononuclear inflammatory cells.

Lymphocytes and plasma cells predominate throughout the more superficial lamina propria, although they may be accompanied by substantial numbers of eosinophils within the deep half of that mucosa. Eosinophils are not found in the superficial half of the lamina propria ( Fig. 29-30 ). Intraepithelial lymphocytes are present throughout, but are much less obvious than in small intestine (with a mean of 1.5 intraepithelial lymphocytes per 100 enterocytes). 3 Lymphoid aggregates are uniformly distributed within the deep lamina propria and superficial submucosa. Crypts may occasionally penetrate through the muscularis mucosa and into one of these submucosal lymphoid follicles, creating what are sometimes referred to as \"submucosal glands.\" The follicles are particularly large in dogs and cats younger than about 2 years of age, and they can be seen from the external surface when examining the colon during exploratory surgery. They are commonly mistaken for significant lesions (like ulcers, tumor nodules, or parasitic cysts). The key to the distinction is that these lymphoid follicles are all the same size and shape, and never coalesce. many examples of increased leukocytes in which there is no evidence of epithelial injury ( Fig. 29-34 ). Developing valid and uniform criteria for assessing the mucosal cellularity and for promoting acceptable interobserver agreement among pathologists remains problematic within the colon as in other parts of the GI tract. Part of the problem lies with incredible variation in histologic staining from laboratory to laboratory, so that recognizing eosinophils, mast cells or sometimes even plasma cells is problematic. 5 Additionally, the range in leukocyte numbers among clinically healthy dogs is quite wide (although much less so than in small intestine). In the only study of its type, normal dogs had up to four layers of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils separating adjacent crypts from one another. 4 There is no published range for eosinophil numbers, but eosinophils should be virtually absent from the superficial half of the mucosa. 3 Additional information about normal colonic mucosal cellularity comes from two studies directed specifically at lymphocyte subpopulations. In healthy dogs, the mean number of immunoglobulincontaining cells and CD3 + T cells per linear millimeter in routine histologic sections is approximately 300. Slightly less than half are T cells. 6, 7 In 11 dogs with clinically diagnosed IBD, the mean increased to 438. The proportional increase among IgG + , IgA + , and CD3 + cells was similar. In this study, only the IgM + cells failed to increase significantly. 6 There remains the fundamental question about whether an increase in leukocytes within any portion of the intestinal lamina propria should be considered \"pathologic,\" or simply an appropriate physiologic response to antigenic challenge.",

Those residual lesions include one or more of mucosal fibrosis, cryptal atrophy or tortuosity, and increased leukocytes with no evidence of active epithelial injury or vascular changes appropriate to active inflammation. Considering the waxing and waning clinical signs in many examples of canine or feline colitis and the rapidity of colonic repair, we need to pay much more attention to when the biopsies were taken relative to the last \"episode\" of clinical disease when assessing colonic biopsies. Lesions of mature mucosal fibrosis and mucosal atrophy are not likely to be relevant if the biopsies were taken in the midst of an acute episode of classical colitis; on the other hand, they may be extremely significant as a footprint of previous inflammatory disease if the biopsies were taken, for example, 2 weeks after the last episode (which is often the case just because of scheduling appointments with a specialist).",

As the vast majority of cases have no demonstrated etiologic agent, colitis is usually classified based on the predominant type and location of the cellular infiltrate. 4, [8] [9] [10] The shortcomings of such classifications are several. First, most of our biopsies capture only the mucosa and do not allow assessment of submucosa or muscularis propria. Second, because the normal colonic lamina propria is populated almost exclusively by lymphocytes and plasma cells, other infiltrating cell types have little chance of becoming \"predominant\" even when their increase may actually be greater and more directly related to the cause of the disease. For example, there is no agreement among pathologists about how many eosinophils it takes for colitis to be classified as \"eosinophilic.\" This is further complicated by the fact that most biopsies are taken fairly late in the course of the disease, at which time the long-lived lymphocytes and plasma cells are almost certain to predominate even if their daily proliferation or recruitment is far less than the recruitment of eosinophils or other leukocyte types. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, there is a huge interobserver variation in how pathologists assess leukocyte numbers and other grading criteria even when using a pictorial guide. 5 Unfortunately, there is no obvious solution to any of these significant shortcomings. At the moment, all we can do is acknowledge that it is indeed a dilemma, not only when making the original diagnosis, but also when trying to compare the results of different studies.",

HUC is a distinct disease syndrome with characteristic histologic lesions seen in young Boxers and French Bulldogs. It is a chronic, progressive, and eventually transmural disease characterized initially by shallow microscopic erosion and ulceration of the colonic surface and by an accumulation of large epithelioid macrophages containing PAS-positive cytoplasmic vacuoles between the muscularis mucosa and the base of the colonic crypts (Figs. 29-36 and 29-37) . Over time, the number of macrophages increases dramatically, with extension into submucosa and spread via lymphatics to occupy large portions of the draining colonic lymph nodes. 11, 12 The granulomatous proliferative disease is usually more obvious than the ulceration. In the early disease, the patchy deep mucosal granulomatous infiltrates can be missed if one postmortem assessment to know the prevalence of microscopic lesions in other tissues. In the largest retrospective study, most cats initially diagnosed with FIP on the basis of intestinal lesions eventually died with clinical signs of systemic FIP. 16 The fungus P. insidiosum causes characteristic necrotizing and granulomatous lesions anywhere in the GI tract of dogs. Lesions tend to be large, multifocal caseous nodules that are easily seen macroscopically. Lesions may be mucosal, submucosal, or transmural, but the submucosal lesions are probably the most prevalent. The fungi are numerous within such lesions, but they are difficult to see with H&E stain. 17 They are readily seen with any of the special fungal stains. As this disease has strong geographic predilections and is relatively common within those specific subtropical habitats, the lesions are usually quite familiar to pathologists working in those areas.",

We do not know whether this represents progression of rectal polyp to true carcinoma, or whether it was simply a mistaken initial diagnosis. The diagnosis of true carcinoma is most reliably made by seeing invasion through the muscularis mucosa and into the submucosa, but many samples are not deep enough to allow that distinction. Even shallow samples of carcinoma may, however, allow observation of invasion across the basement membrane and into the lamina propria, a behavior not seen in otherwise identical papillary adenomas.

They exhibit a wide range of histologic appearance with a wide range in mitotic activity and the degree of invasiveness. They are easily identified as pleomorphic spindle-cell tumors, but distinguishing whether they represent leiomyoma, leiomyosarcoma, or GIST requires immunohistochemistry.

Five dogs with excised leiomyosarcomas had a mean survival of 7.8 months.

Before the pathogenesis was understood, this lesion was usually only observed in the later stages. Early lesions associated with subclinical disease are characterized by infiltration of lymphocytes, and fewer plasma cells and macrophages, at the border of normal and disorganized atrophic parenchyma and extending into the normal parenchyma. Lymphocytes may also be present within acinar and ductal epithelium and lymphoid follicles may be present. The lymphocytes muscularis propria. They then implant throughout the peritoneal cavity, and can also spread by lymphatic and venous dissemination to liver, lung, and any other location. They are often quite welldifferentiated mucus-producing tubular carcinomas, and traditionally induce substantial scirrhous reaction. In the colon, however, approximately 25% of carcinomas are, at the time of initial diagnosis, extremely well-differentiated intraluminal papillary tumors that are seen rarely if ever in stomach or small intestine. If sampled just by shallow endoscopic biopsies, these can be mistaken for hyperplastic polyps (especially in dogs and especially if they occur in rectal mucosa where they overlap grossly and histologically with harmless rectal polyps). The key to the diagnosis of carcinoma is that these well-differentiated hyperchromatic columnar epithelial cells invade across the basement membrane and into the lamina propria ( Fig.  29-42 ).

Liquefactive necrosis may accompany or follow coagulation necrosis. Necrosis is often accompanied by peripancreatic fat saponification (Figs. 29-48 and 29-49) . Infiltrates of neutrophils frequently accompany both pancreatic necrosis and peripancreatic fat necrosis (Figs. 29-48 and 29-49) and exacerbate injury to the pancreas by the release of enzymes. Septa between lobules are usually expanded by hemorrhage, fibrin, neutrophils, and macrophages. There may be local destruction of small blood vessels associated with hemorrhage, and thrombi are common in small veins and arteries in severe disease (Fig. 29-50 ) leading to further ischemic damage to the pancreas. Thrombi may extend into the portal vein from the pancreas. 13 Occasionally, in both dogs and cats, neutrophils may predominate in acute pancreatitis without extensive necrosis. They may be seen in the parenchyma, in the interlobular septa, or in the pancreatic ducts. Suppurative ductal inflammation occurs in young cats, 11 but less commonly in dogs.",

Islet cell tumors may be positive for insulin, glucagon, or somatostatin and are usually positive for chromogranin by immunohistochemistry. Carcinomas may spread into the adjacent duodenum, stomach, and liver, and also spread throughout the abdomen (carcinomatosis). Pancreatic carcinomas frequently elicit a desmoplastic response with cells surrounded by fibroblasts and collagen (Fig. 29-62 ). In poorly differentiated tumors that have spread into adjacent organs, it may be difficult to determine whether cytoplasm that is more than three to four times the surface area of nucleus and the cytoplasm may be vacuolated to various extents. Frequently, there is a mild to moderate coarse, irregular, clear vacuolation caused by the presence of stored glycogen. Hepatocytes may vary in size in response to systemic or localized factors. Blood oxygen is highest in the periportal regions of the lobule where blood from the portal veins enters the sinusoids and lowest in the centrilobular areas. Centrilobular hepatocytes may become smaller than normal when blood oxygen levels become too low (e.g., during anemia or chronic congestion) or hepatocyte oxygen demands increase (e.g., during heat stroke). Centrilobular hepatocytes may become enlarged where there is induction of drug metabolizing enzymes as these enzymes are in the highest concentration in these hepatocytes. In older cats, the centrilobular hepatocytes often contain brown granular lipofuscin pigment. Mitotic activity of hepatocytes is rarely seen in the normal liver.",

            "text": "Abnormal histology of the liver can be best appreciated when the normal histologic appearance is well understood. There are a number of models that describe the structural unit of the liver. 1, 2 In this section, the standard lobule is used as the structural unit of the liver. The liver is a three-dimensional structure and can be envisioned as a tightly packed cluster of grapes with each grape representing a lobule. From the two-dimensional microscopic perspective the \"typical\" lobule is outlined by a hexagon of portal tracts about 1 mm in diameter with a central vein (terminal hepatic venule) at its center, although some lobules form imperfect hexagons (Fig. 29-63 ). Portal tracts usually contain a branch of the portal vein and one or two branches of the hepatic artery, as well as a bile duct. In addition, the portal tract contains abundant connective tissue as well as lymphatics and nerves. However, there is normal variation in the number of bile ducts and hepatic artery branches. Usually, the portal vein profile is larger than the surface area of the bile ducts and the hepatic arteries. There is a distinct border between the portal tract connective tissue and the initial surrounding row of hepatocytes, termed the limiting plate. Between the portal tract and the central vein the hepatocytes are arranged in radial plates that are one or occasionally two cells thick. Normal hepatocytes have abundant health of the liver. Wedge biopsies provide a more accurate view of most liver disorders than needle biopsies, 3 but it is disappointing, at the least, for the pathologist to receive a single wedge of liver after the patient has undergone a laparotomy. Despite the apparent normality of liver at surgery, histologic evaluation is frequently useful. Multiple small wedges from several lobes are preferred over a larger section from a single lobe. Needle biopsies can be sufficient for many approaches, but multiple biopsies from more than one liver lobe are desired. In any event, properly collected and handled tissue is essential for optimal microscopic evaluation. Once collected, the liver tissue should be handled as little as possible to avoid physical distortion or loss of tissue. This is particularly true of needle biopsies. Small or fragmented biopsies can be placed into embedding bags or plastic cassettes with a screen mesh. In most circumstances, the tissue should be placed immediately into 10% neutral buffered formalin. Tissue should not be more than 0.5 to 1 cm at its greatest thickness and the ratio of formalin to tissue should be 10 : 1. If immunohistochemistry (IHC) is to be performed, the tissue should be processed within 48 hours to avoid overfixation.",

Extrahepatic shunts occur more often in small breeds of dog. Typically, intrahepatic portosystemic shunts involve failure of closure of the fetal ductus venosus at birth. These shunts, like the ductus venosus, are most often located in the left side of the liver. This anomaly occurs most often in large breed dogs. Regardless of the site of the shunt, affected animals are typically stunted and frequently develop signs of hepatic encephalopathy. The liver is small and microscopically displays hepatocellular and lobular atrophy. 5 There is an increase in the profiles of hepatic arterioles within the portal areas, presumed to relate to a compensatory increase in systemic arterial blood flow, in response to the inadequate portal flow. There is also sometimes a proliferation of small caliber bile ducts. Portal vein profiles are smaller than normal or absent (Fig. 29-64) .

Sudden loss of perfusion from shock, ruptured chordae tendineae, or hemolysis can produce generalized centrilobular necrosis ( Fig. 29-67 ). This lesion is histologically very similar to acute hepatotoxicity and clinical data are often needed to clarify the pathogenesis. Random foci of ischemic necrosis are more likely attributed to localized disruption of blood flow, which can follow fibrin deposition within sinusoids during DIC.

Some cells in the ductal plate mature into the bile duct system, whereas others undergo apoptosis. Disturbances in development of this cell population give rise to a variety of biliary developmental abnormalities. Congenital biliary cystic disease is characterized by dilation of portions of the biliary tree and associated fibrosis. Similar lesions are frequently found in the renal tubules as well. Although the pattern of lesions and inheritance in domestic animals is not as clearly Debate continues regarding the nature of multicystic biliary lesions in the canine liver. It is likely that the majority of these lesions are congenital ductal plate disorders, rather than neoplasms.

Excessive amounts of endogenous or exogenous glucocorticoids cause extensive swelling of hepatocytes from the accumulation of glycogen.

Hepatic lesions caused by S. canis do not occur in all infections, but include multifocal and portal inflammation, which may involve the limiting plate, with neutrophils, mononuclear cells, giant cells, and foci of necrosis within which intrahistiocytic schizonts and free merozoites can be found.",

            "text": "As the recipient of all of the blood flow from the digestive tract, the liver is centrally positioned to protect the body from endogenous and ingested injurious substances. Consequently, it is also the most common site of toxic injury. Such injury often produces a characteristic distribution of acute coagulative necrosis within the hepatic lobule, most often centrilobular (Fig. 29-93 ). This pattern of toxininduced injury is attributed to the higher content of cytochrome P450 enzymes in this area of the lobule. Hepatic metabolism of many molecules destined for excretion usually goes through a three step process that involves oxidation of the parent molecule, conjugation with a polar molecule (often glutathione), and transport across the canalicular membrane into the bile. Hepatocellular injury can arise when the initial oxidation step leads to an excess of the oxidized (or bioactive) parent molecule. This bioactive form can bind to cellular proteins, RNA, and cell membrane lipids, causing acute toxicity, and in other circumstances bind to DNA and lead to carcinogenicity. Many naturally occurring and therapeutic hepatotoxins (e.g., acetaminophen, xylitol, aflatoxin B 1 ) produce centrilobular to massive necrosis, depending on the dose. [21] [22] [23] Cats are particularly sensitive to hepatic toxins such as acetaminophen and this is likely because of less robust antioxidant defenses and hepatic drug conjugation pathways compared with the dog. 24 Other types of toxins do not need hepatic metabolic activation and can cause injury directly, often producing random or periportal patterns of necrosis. However, drug-or chemical-induced acute necrosis in the proportion and distribution of these components vary widely and it is appropriate for the pathologist to include in the diagnosis the activity and stage of the disease as well as the possible cause. The activity of the disease is determined by the amount of inflammation and extent of hepatocellular apoptosis and necrosis. The stage of the disease and the prognosis may be determined by the extent and pattern of fibrosis and the presence of architectural distortion. Early fibrosis may be seen as fine septa penetrating the parenchyma from the portal tracts or along the sinusoids. This is common in association with interface hepatitis (inflammation at the limiting plate). Fibrosis is usually the result of direct activation of hepatic stellate cells that are positioned in the space of Disse or related cells in the portal tract and connective tissue around the central vein. Increased connective tissue may be present or the collapse and condensation of the reticulin network because of hepatocyte injury and loss may give the appearance of increased fibrosis. The more advanced patterns of fibrosis may include portal-to-portal, portal-to-central and central-to-central bridging, or it may dissect the lobule. Other changes seen in chronic hepatic injury or hepatitis include regeneration and regenerative nodules of hepatic parenchyma, and proliferation of ductular structures at the periphery of the parenchymal periportal or midzone of the hepatic lobule is uncommon in dogs and cats.",

The histologic appearance of acute toxic injury is heavily dependent on time, as a single insult can be nearly resolved in 3 to 4 days, depending on the severity of the initial insult. As a result, biopsies may fail to show significant lesions if the biopsy is obtained several days after a single exposure to a toxin, even though liver enzymes may still remain elevated.

Ascites and multiple acquired portosystemic shunts may develop when hepatic fibrosis disrupts hepatic blood flow leading to portal hypertension. Diminished hepatic function interferes with albumin synthesis, which can accentuate the formation of ascites.

Hepatocellular necrosis is not usually evident ( Fig. 29-99 ). Neutrophils may predominate in a proportion of the portal areas in acute extrahepatic diseases. There is slight to marked accumulation of inflammatory cells within the sinusoids and Kupffer cells may be prominent because of hyperplasia or hypertrophy. The central vein connective tissue may have similar changes to those in the portal tracts. The chronic form of nonspecific reactive hepatitis is characterized by infiltration of mononuclear cells, plasma cells and lymphocytes, and pigmented macrophages. The connective tissue around the central and sublobular veins, as in the case of acute disease, may mimic the changes in the portal tracts.

Histologic examination is often needed to make a final determination. Histologically, hepatocellular adenomas are compressive masses composed of well-differentiated hepatocytes that form uniform plates up to two to three cells thick. Within the mass there is usually no more than a single portal tract ( Fig. 29-101 ). Adenomatous hepatocytes tend to abut normal adjacent hepatocytes at right angles. Cystic areas of necrosis, hemorrhage, or serum, as well as foci of extramedullary hematopoiesis can be present. Hepatocellular adenomas can be difficult to distinguish from hepatocellular nodular hyperplasia in biopsies because of similarity between the level of differentiation of the hepatocytes in both lesions. Unlike adenomas, nodular hyperplasia retains normal lobular architectural elements, although the portal tracts are more separated than normal. In small biopsies it is nearly impossible to distinguish regenerative nodules from hepatocellular adenomas, as many microscopic features are identical, such as the degree of differentiation of the hepatocytes and the paucity of portal tracts. However, regenerative nodules arise in a background of hepatocellular injury and are typically multiple so an appropriate clinical history can aid in the correct interpretation. Hepatocellular adenomas are most likely underdiagnosed and often confused with welldifferentiated hepatocellular carcinomas because diagnostic criteria have been imprecise but the advent of newer criteria should clarify this issue. 7",

Microscopically, lymphoma is characterized by infiltrates of neoplastic lymphocytes into the portal tract connective tissue and around the central and sublobular veins ( Fig. 29-106 ). With advancing disease the neoplastic lymphocytes extend into the parenchyma. Usually there is no evidence of biliary proliferation in lymphoma that can help distinguish this tumor from feline lymphocytic cholangitis. Other hematopoietic neoplasms, including myeloid and erythroid neoplasia, malignant histiocytosis, and mast cell tumors can be found in the liver, although neoplastic cells are more likely to collect along the sinusoids, rather than within the portal tracts.",

Distinguishing metastatic neoplasms from primary tumors can be difficult, particularly in the case of poorly differentiated epithelial tumors.

It is important to ensure that a thorough postmortem examination is done, or when evaluating a biopsy, that the complete history is available to determine whether masses have been removed previously.
