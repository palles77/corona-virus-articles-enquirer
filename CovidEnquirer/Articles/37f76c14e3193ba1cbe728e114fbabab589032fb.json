Five of the 16 Hospital National Patient Safety Goals for 2016 of The Joint Commission (formerly the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations) target prevention of HAIs. 1 Hospitals have learned from high-reliability organizations (e.g., the aviation industry) the importance of adopting changes that include the leadership's commitment to achieving zero patient harm, a fully functional culture of safety throughout the organization, and the widespread deployment of highly effective process improvement tools. 2 Involvement of new stakeholders for improving patient safety and outcomes related to HAIs (e.g., Children's Hospitals' Solutions for Patient Safety, Children's Hospital Association, individual states' mandatory HAI public reporting programs, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, The Joint Commission) has broadened the arena for HAI prevention efforts. Knowledge of the complexities of prevention and control of HAIs in children is critical to many different leaders of children's healthcare facilities. One framework for patient safety in children's hospitals that includes infection prevention and control (IPC) was developed by the Ohio Children's Hospital Solutions collaborative and demonstrates the effectiveness of hospitalwide collaboration. 3 As more disciplines in healthcare become engaged in prevention of HAIs as well as antimicrobial stewardship, it is the responsibility of the healthcare epidemiologist and the IPC staff (infection preventionists, healthcare epidemiologists) to educate the facility leadership on the discipline of IPC.",

Although the term nosocomial still applies to infections that are acquired in acute care hospitals, the more general term, healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), is preferred because much care of high-risk patients, including patients with medical devices (e.g., central venous catheters, ventilators, ventricular shunts, peritoneal dialysis catheters), has shifted to ambulatory settings, rehabilitation or chronic care facilities, and the home; thus, the geographic location of acquisition of the infection often cannot be determined.",

Host (i.e., intrinsic) factors that make children particularly vulnerable to infection include immaturity of the immune system, congenital abnormalities, and congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies. Children with congenital anomalies have a high risk of HAI if their unusual anatomic features predispose them to contamination of normally sterile sites. Moreover, these children require prolonged and repeated hospitalizations, undergo many complex surgical procedures, and have extended exposure to invasive supportive and monitoring equipment.",

Knowledge of the epidemiology of infection of patients with cystic fibrosis and effective methods to prevent patient-to-patient transmission have expanded with the use of newer molecular diagnostic methods, resulting in a 2013 update in the Infection Prevention and Control Guideline for Cystic Fibrosis. 9 Fortunately, the population of children with perinatally acquired human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has decreased dramatically since 1994, but new cases of sexually transmitted HIV infection continue to be diagnosed in teens who receive care in children's hospitals. Finally, young infants who have not yet been immunized, or immunosuppressed children who do not respond to vaccines or who lose antibody during disease or treatment (e.g., patients with nephrotic syndrome), have increased susceptibility to vaccine-preventable diseases.",

            "text": "The source of many HAIs is the endogenous flora of the patient. An asymptomatically colonizing pathogen can invade a patient's bloodstream or be transmitted to other patients on the hands of healthcare personnel (HCP) or on shared equipment. Other important sources of HAIs in infants and children include the mother in the case of neonates, toys were implicated in an outbreak of multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a pediatric oncology unit. 23 Although the source of most Candida HAIs is the patient's endogenous flora, horizontal transmission, most likely through HCP hands, has been demonstrated in studies using typing by pulsed gel electrophoresis in the NICU and in a pediatric oncology unit. 24, 25 Newer molecular diagnostic methods (e.g., whole genome sequencing) are more sensitive and specific than pulsed gel electrophoresis and have proven to be valuable in identifying outbreaks of a variety of pathogens in both pediatric and adult settings. 26, 27 Droplet. Infectious respiratory droplets >5 \u00b5m in diameter are generated from the respiratory tract by coughing, sneezing, or talking or during such procedures as suctioning, intubation, chest physiotherapy, or pulmonary function testing. Transmission of infectious agents by the droplet route requires exposure of mucous membranes to large respiratory droplets within 3 to 6 feet (1 to 2 m) of the infected person. Large respiratory droplets do not remain suspended in the air for prolonged periods, and they settle on environmental surfaces. The dynamics of infectious aerosols can be affected by a variety of factors including characteristics of specific strains of bacteria, temperature, humidity, and number of air exchanges in a room. Adenovirus, influenza virus, and rhinovirus are transmitted primarily by the droplet route, whereas RSV is transmitted primarily by the contact route. 28 Although influenza virus can be transmitted by the airborne route under unusual conditions of reduced air circulation or low absolute humidity, ample evidence indicates that transmission of influenza is prevented by droplet precautions and, in the care of infants, the addition of contact precautions. 29 Airborne. Droplet nuclei that arise from desiccation of respiratory droplets and are <5 \u00b5m in diameter and contain infectious agents remain suspended in the air for prolonged periods and travel long distances on air currents. 4 Susceptible persons who have not had face-to-face contact or been in the same room as the source person can inhale such infectious particles. M. tuberculosis, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and rubeola virus are the agents most frequently transmitted by the airborne route. Although transmission of M. tuberculosis by the airborne route can occur rarely from an infant or young child with active tuberculosis, the more frequent source is the adult visitor with active pulmonary tuberculosis that has not yet been diagnosed; thus screening of visiting family members is an important component for control of tuberculosis in pediatric healthcare facilities. 30 Some agents (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus [SARS-CoV]) can be transmitted as small-particle aerosols under special circumstances of aerosol-generating procedures (e.g., endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy); therefore, an N95 or higher respirator is indicated for persons in the same airspace when these procedures are performed, but an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) may not always be required. Roy and Milton 31 proposed the following classification for aerosol transmission when evaluating routes of SARS-CoV transmission: 1. Obligate: Under natural conditions, disease occurs following transmission of the agent only through small-particle aerosols (e.g., tuberculosis). 2. Preferential: Natural infection results from transmission through multiple routes, but small-particle aerosols are the predominant route (e.g., measles, varicella). 3. Opportunistic: Agents naturally cause disease through other routes, but under certain environmental conditions they can be transmitted by fine-particle aerosols. This conceptual framework can explain rare occurrences of airborne transmission of agents that are transmitted most frequently by other routes (e.g., smallpox, SARS, influenza, noroviruses). Concern about airborne transmission of influenza arose during the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic. However, the conclusion from all published experiences during the pandemic was that droplet transmission is the usual route of transmission, and surgical masks were noninferior to N95 respirators in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza in HCP. 32, 33 Concerns about unknown or possible routes of transmission of agents that can cause severe disease and have no known treatment often result in more extreme prevention strategies. Therefore, recommended precautions could change as the epidemiology of emerging agents is defined and these controversial issues are resolved. Although no evidence supports airborne transmission of the Ebola virus under usual circumstances in the field, the aerosolization of body fluids that contain high titers of Ebola virus requires additional protection. 34 invasive monitoring and supportive equipment, blood products, total parenteral nutrition fluids, lipids, infant formula and human milk, HCP, and other contacts, including adult and sibling visitors. Maternal infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Treponema pallidum, HIV, hepatitis B virus, parvovirus B19, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, herpes simplex virus, or group B Streptococcus, or colonization with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), pose substantial threats to the neonate. During perinatal care, procedures such as fetal monitoring using scalp electrodes, fetal transfusion and surgical procedures, umbilical cannulation, and circumcision are potential risk factors for infection. Intrinsically contaminated powdered formulas and infant formulas prepared in contaminated blenders or improperly stored or handled have resulted in sporadic and epidemic infections in the nursery (e.g., Cronobacter [formerly Enterobacter] sakazakii), but such infections have become less frequent since the pathogenesis was defined and contamination reduced. 10 Human milk that has been contaminated by maternal flora or by organisms transmitted through breast pumps has caused isolated serious infections and epidemics. The risks of neonatal hepatitis, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, and HIV infection from human milk warrant further caution for handling and use of banked breast milk. With increasing numbers of procedures being performed by pediatric interventional radiologists, 11 an understanding of appropriate aseptic technique, as well as prevention and management of infectious complications, by interventional radiologists is important. 12 Construction, renovation, demolition, and excavation in and near healthcare facilities are important sources of environmental fungi, (e.g., Aspergillus spp., agents of mucormycoses, Fusarium spp., Scedosporium spp., Bipolaris spp.). 13 Immunocompromised patients and patients in the pediatric ICU (PICU) and NICU are at greatest risk for fungal infection, and case fatality rates can be \u226550%, especially if diagnosis and treatment are delayed.",

A significant association between reduced levels of nurse staffing and appropriately trained nurses has been demonstrated to increase risk of infection in many studies in both children and adults. 4, 14, 15 Theoretical concerns exist that infection risk also will increase in association with the innovative practices of co-bedding of twins and kangaroo care in the NICU because of increased opportunity for skin-to-skin exposure of multiple-gestation infants to each other and to their mothers, respectively. Neither the benefits nor the safety of co-bedding multiple-birth infants in the hospital setting has been demonstrated. 16 Overall, the infection risk is reduced with kangaroo care, but transmission of tuberculosis and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has occurred in kangaroo mother care units in South Africa. 17 Parents providing kangaroo care should be monitored for the presence of skin infections.",

Risk factors for Candida infections include prolonged length of stay in an ICU, use of central venous catheters, intralipids, histamine (H 2 )-blocking agents, and exposure to third-generation cephalosporins. GNB and Candida spp. are especially important pathogens for HAIs in patients with intestinal failure who are receiving total parenteral nutrition, and these organisms can cause repeated episodes of sepsis.

The most recently published clinical practice guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend the use of oral or intravenous fluconazole prophylaxis in infants weighing <1000 g at birth in NICUs with high rates (>10%) of invasive candidiasis, based on high quality of evidence to support efficacy and safety. 46 Additionally, empiric antifungal therapy in preterm infants of \u22641000 g birth weight is associated with improved survival rates without adverse outcomes. 47 The staff members of each NICU first must optimize infection control practices and then assess the remaining risk of Candida infections. Finally, environmental fungi (e.g., Aspergillus, Fusarium, Scedosporium, Bipolaris, agents of mucormycosis) are important sources of infection for severely immunocompromised patients; meticulous attention to the conditions of the internal environment of any facility that provides care for severely immunocompromised patients is required, as well as prevention of possible exposure to construction dust in and around healthcare facilities. 13 With the advent of more effective and less toxic antifungal agents and improved outcomes, it is important to identify promptly the infecting agent by obtaining tissue samples and to determine susceptibility to candidate antifungal agents.",

HCP rarely are the source of outbreaks of HAIs caused by bacteria and fungi, but when they are, certain factors are usually present that increase the risk of transmission (e.g., sinusitis, draining otitis externa, respiratory tract infections, dermatitis, onychomycosis, wearing of artificial nails). [35] [36] [37] Persons with direct patient contact who were wearing artificial nails have been implicated in outbreaks of P. aeruginosa and ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in NICUs; therefore, the use of artificial nails or extenders is prohibited in persons who have direct contact with high-risk patients. 4 Several published studies have shown that infected pediatric HCP, including resident physicians, transmitted Bordetella pertussis to other patients and can be the source of other vaccine-preventable infections in healthcare. 38 Pathogens associated with HAIs in children differ from those in adults in that respiratory viruses are more frequently associated with transmission in pediatric healthcare facilities. Respiratory viruses (e.g., RSV, parainfluenza, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus) have been implicated in outbreaks in high-risk units. As more respiratory viruses and gastrointestinal pathogens are identified by using highly sensitive molecular methods, epidemiologic studies will be required to define further the risk of transmission in healthcare facilities and the clinical significance of positive antigen detection test results. 40, 41 Healthcareassociated outbreaks of varicella, measles, and rotavirus infection now are rare events because of the consistent use of vaccines by children and HCP.",

Other MDROs (e.g., VRE, ESBLs, and CRE, especially K. pneumoniae) have emerged as the most challenging healthcare-associated pathogens in both pediatric and adult settings, and otherwise healthy children in the community can be colonized asymptomatically with these MDROs. 42 GNB, including ESBL and other multidrug-resistant isolates, are more frequent than MRSA and VRE in many PICUs and NICUs. Patients who are transferred from chronic care facilities may be colonized with MDR GNB at the time of admission to the PICU.

Thus the ratio of 1 infection preventionist to 250 beds that was associated with a 30% reduction in the rates of nosocomial infection in the Study on Efficacy of Nosocomial Infection Control (SENIC) performed in the 1970s no longer is sufficient because the complexity of patient populations and responsibilities have increased. Many experts recommend that a ratio of 1 infection preventionist to 100 beds is more appropriate for the current workload, but no study has been performed to confirm the effectiveness of that ratio. No information is available on the number of IPC personnel required outside acute care, but it is clear that persons well trained in IPC must be available for all sites where healthcare is delivered. Data collected from a member workforce survey conducted in 2015 by the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology are expected to help determine the optimal number of infection preventionists for different healthcare settings based on the current responsibilities and demographics of infection preventionists.",

The CDC recommends the following: (1) prospective surveillance on a regular basis by trained infection preventionists, using standardized definitions; (2) analysis of infection rates using established epidemiologic and statistical methods (e.g., calculation of rates using appropriate denominators that reflect duration of exposure; use of statistical process control charts for trending rates); (3) regular use of data in decision making; and (4) employment of an effective and trained healthcare epidemiologist who develops IPC strategies and policies and serves as a liaison with the medical community and administration. [53] [54] [55] The CDC has established a set of standard definitions of HAIs that have been validated and accepted widely with updates posted on the CDC NHSN website. Standardization of surveillance methodology has become especially important with the advent of state legislation for mandatory reporting of HAI rates to the public. The NHSN now receives, analyzes, and reports data from >17,000 healthcare facilities in the US. A standardized infection ratio (SIR) that takes into account differences in risk among healthcare settings, unit types, procedures, and patient populations has been included in summary reports of HAI rates since 2009. 56 The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and most states use the NHSN data for public reporting of HAI rates on their websites.

The microbiology laboratory can provide online culture information about individual patients, outbreaks of infection, antibiograms (antibiotic susceptibility patterns of pathogens summarized periodically), and employee infection data. The laboratory also can assist with surveillance cultures and facilitation of molecular typing of isolates during outbreak investigations. Rapid diagnostic testing of clinical specimens for identification of respiratory and gastrointestinal tract viruses and B. pertussis is especially important for pediatric facilities. The IPC division and the microbiology laboratory must communicate daily because even requests for cultures or other diagnostic testing from physicians (e.g., M. tuberculosis, Neisseria meningitidis, C. difficile) can identify patients early who are infected, are at high risk of infection, or require isolation. If microbiology laboratory work is outsourced, it is important to ensure that the services needed to support effective ICP be available, as delineated in a 2013 guideline developed by the IDSA and the American Society for Microbiology. 66 Control of unusual infections or outbreaks in the community generally is the responsibility of the local or state public health department; however, the individual facility must be responsible for preventing transmission within that facility. Public health agencies can be helpful, particularly in alerting hospitals of community outbreaks so that outpatient and inpatient diagnosis, treatment, necessary isolation, and other preventive measures are implemented promptly to avoid further spread. Conversely, designated persons in the hospital must notify public health department personnel of reportable infections to facilitate early diagnosis, treatment, and infection control in the community. Benefits of community or regional collaboratives of individual healthcare facilities and local public health departments for prevention of HAIs, especially those caused by MDROs, have been demonstrated, and this collaboration should be encouraged. 4 ",

Hospital administrative support for the infrastructure required for ongoing measurement and reporting of antimicrobial use and other related outcome measures, including feedback to prescribers, is a critical component of a successful antimicrobial stewardship program. An antimicrobial stewardship program can optimize clinical outcomes while decreasing unintended consequences of antimicrobial use, including the emergence of resistant organisms. Additionally, use of specific antimicrobial agents can alert the IPC program to the presence of potentially infectious patients (e.g., with pulmonary tuberculosis, MDROs). National guidelines exist for developing and implementing an institutional antimicrobial stewardship program, including core components for acute care hospitals and for long-term care facilities. 68, 70 The Natinal Quality Forum and its partners have also developed a Playbook that provides additional guidance for implementation of antimicrobial stewardship programs in acute care. The knowledge and skills required for antimicrobial stewardship leaders also have been defined. 50, 71 these data by the public remains difficult, and more research is needed to optimize methods of data display to the public. 57 New York State is the first state to have published an improvement in process and outcomes of central line-associated bloodstream infection rates in NICUs following implementation of a public reporting program. 58 Although various surveillance methods are used, the basic goals and elements are similar and include using standardized definitions of infection, finding and collecting cases of HAIs, tabulating data, using appropriate denominators that reflect duration of risk, analyzing and interpreting the data, reporting important deviations from endemic rates (epidemic, outbreaks) to the bedside care providers and to the facility administrators, implementing appropriate control measures, auditing adherence rates for recommended processes, and assessing efficacy of the control measures. Medical centers can use different methods of surveillance, as outlined in Box 2.1. Most experts agree that a combination of methods enhances surveillance and reliability of data, and some combination of clinical chart review and database retrieval is important. Whatever data collection systems are used, validation is required. Administrative databases created for the purposes of billing should not be used as the sole source to identify HAIs because of overestimates and underestimates that result from inaccurate coding of HAIs. 59 Use of software designed specifically for IPC data entry and analysis facilitates real-time tracking of trends and timely intervention when clusters are identified. The IPC team should participate in the development and update of electronic medical record systems for a healthcare organization, to ensure that surveillance needs will be met.",

            "text": "The most recent Guideline for Isolation Precautions published in 2007 4 reaffirms Standard Precautions, a combination of universal precautions and body substance isolation, as the foundation of transmission prevention measures. Critical thinking is required for HCP to recognize the importance of body fluids, excretions, and secretions in the transmission of infectious pathogens and take appropriate protective precautions by using PPE (e.g., masks, gowns, gloves, face shields, or goggles) and safety devices when exposure is likely even if an infection is not suspected or known. In addition, these updated guidelines provide recommendations for Standard Precautions in all settings in which healthcare is delivered (acute care hospitals, ambulatory surgical and medical centers, longterm care facilities, and home health agencies). The components of Standard Precautions are summarized in Table 2 Instruct symptomatic persons to cover the mouth or nose when sneezing or coughing; use tissues and dispose in no-touch receptacle; observe hand hygiene after soiling of hands with respiratory secretions; wear a surgical mask if tolerated or maintain spatial separation, >1-2 m (3-6 feet) if possible a During aerosol-generating procedures on patients with suspected or proven infections transmitted by aerosols (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome), wear a fit-tested N95 or higher respirator in addition to gloves, gown, and face and eye protection. Although targeted Contact Precautions and universal gowning and gloving are effective for preventing transmission of infectious agents, potential adverse effects in patients placed on Contact Precautions have been described (e.g., depression, fewer visits from the healthcare team, increased rates of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, increased falls). 80 Additionally, adherence to Contact Precautions decreases as the number of patients on Contact Precautions increases. 81 Finally, a simulation study demonstrated contamination of HCP skin and clothing during doffing of gowns and gloves 82 ; this study effectively demonstrated the PPE lessons learned during the SARS and EVD experiences. Evidence supports the importance of applying Contact Precautions only when indicated, obtaining training on the use of PPE, having effective PPE readily available, and practicing consistent and precise use of PPE. 83 Table 2.2 lists the 3 categories of isolation based on routes of transmission and their necessary components. Table 2 .3 lists precautions by syndromes, to be used when a patient has an infectious disease and the agent is not yet identified. For infectious agents that are more likely to be transmitted by the droplet route (e.g., pandemic influenza), droplet precautions (with use of surgical mask) are appropriate; however, during an aerosol-generating procedure, N95 or higher respirators are indicated. 84 ",

Ultraviolet light irradiation and hydrogen peroxide vapor systems have been shown to reduce surface contamination with common pathogens and decrease the risk of acquiring HAIs caused by those pathogens when these systems are added to a terminal cleaning regimen. [85] [86] [87] At specific wavelengths, ultraviolet light breaks the molecular bonds in DNA, thus destroying the organisms. Ultraviolet technology also has been considered as a method of disinfecting PPE, as a risk mitigation strategy for HCP caring for patients with EVD. 88 These technologies supplement, but do not replace, standard cleaning and disinfection because surfaces must be physically cleaned of particulate matter and debris. Other disadvantages of these systems are that they cannot be used when people are in the rooms, room turnover is delayed, and the systems are expensive to purchase. No recommendations have been made for routine use or specific indications because research on antimicrobial effectiveness, cost effectiveness, and feasibility of these systems is ongoing. Patients with the syndromes or conditions listed may have atypical signs or symptoms (e.g., neonates and adults with pertussis may not have paroxysmal or severe cough).

Several children's hospitals provide influenza vaccine or tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine, or both, to household contacts at no charge, thereby supporting the cocooning strategy endorsed by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and the American Academy of Pediatrics. 96 For patients requiring Contact Precautions, the use of PPE by visitors is determined by the nature of the interaction with the patient and the likelihood that the visitor will frequent common areas on the patient's unit or interact with other patients and their families. It is important to distinguish parents or guardians from nonhousehold visitors when determining whether the visitor should wear PPE. The risk-benefit decision should weigh not only the specific pathogen in question, but also the effect of parental or guardian PPE on breastfeeding, bonding, and family participation in the child's medical care. For family members who are rooming in with children who have prolonged hospitalizations, restriction of visitation to other patients is emphasized. A SHEA expert guidance document has been published to summarize the principles to follow to prevent transmission of infectious agents by visitors to patients because few data are available to inform evidence-based recommendations. 97 Although most pediatricians encourage visits by siblings in inpatient areas, the medical risk must not outweigh the psychosocial benefit. Families favorably regard sibling visitation, and no evidence indicates increased bacterial colonization or subsequent bacterial infection in the neonate or older child who has been visited by siblings. Strict guidelines for sibling visitation should be established and enforced in an effort to maximize visitation opportunities and minimize risks of transmission of infectious agents, most frequently viruses. The following recommendations regarding visitation can guide policy development: 1. Sibling visitation is encouraged in the well-child nursery and NICU, as well as in areas for care of older children. 2. Before visitation, parents should be interviewed by a trained staff nurse concerning the current health status of the sibling. Siblings should not be allowed to visit if they are delinquent in recommended vaccines, have fever or symptoms of an acute illness, or are within the incubation period following exposure to a known infectious disease. After the interview, the physician or nurse should place a written consent for sibling visitation in the patient's permanent record and a name tag indicating that the sibling has been approved for visitation for that day. 3. Asymptomatic siblings who recently were exposed to varicella but who previously were immunized can be assumed to be immune. 4. The visiting sibling should visit only his or her sibling and not be allowed in playrooms with groups of patients. 5. Visitation should be limited to periods of time that ensure adequate screening, observation, and monitoring of visitors by medical and nursing staff members. 6. Children should perform hand hygiene before and after contact with the patient or upon entry and departure from the patient's room. 7.

Sterilization is achieved by physical and chemical processes such as steam under pressure, dry heat, ethylene oxide, and liquid chemicals. The Spaulding classification of patient care equipment as critical, semicritical, and noncritical items with regard to sterilization and disinfection is used by the CDC. Critical items require sterilization because they enter sterile body tissues and carry a high risk of causing infection if they are contaminated; semicritical items require disinfection because they may contact mucous membranes and nonintact skin; and noncritical items require routine cleaning because they come in contact only with intact skin. If noncritical items used on patients requiring Transmission-Based Precautions, especially Contact Precautions, must be shared, these items should be disinfected between uses. Guidelines for specific objects and specific disinfectants are published and updated by the CDC. Multiple published reports and manufacturers similarly recommend the use and reuse of objects with appropriate sterilization, disinfection, or cleaning recommendations. Recommendations in guidelines for reprocessing endoscopes to avoid contamination focus on training of personnel, meticulous manual cleaning, high-level disinfection followed by rinsing and air-drying, and proper storage. 92 However, outbreaks of MDR GNB infections associated with exposure to duodenoscopes used for retrograde cholangiopancreatography that have been reprocessed according to recommendations suggest a need for new endoscope reprocessing technologies. 51, 93 These endoscopes have a complex design with long, narrow channels, crevices that are difficult to access with a cleaning brush, right-angle turns, and heavy microbial contamination following procedures. Until new methods are developed, meticulous adherence to recommended processes with enhancements should be followed. Medical devices that are designed for single use (e.g., specialized catheters, electrodes, biopsy needles) must be reprocessed by third parties or hospitals according to the guidance issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in August, 2000 with amendments in September, 2006; such reprocessors are considered and regulated as \"manufacturers.\" Available data show that single-use devices reprocessed according to the FDA regulatory requirements are as safe and effective as new devices.",

The association of communityassociated MRSA in HCP working in an outpatient HIV clinic with environmental community-associated MRSA contamination of that clinic indicates the potential for transmission in this setting. 112 Patientto-patient transmission of Burkholderia species and P. aeruginosa in outpatient clinics for patients with cystic fibrosis has been confirmed and prevented by implementing recommended IPC methods. 9 IPC guidelines and policies for pediatric outpatient settings, including office practices, were published by the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2007, 113 reaffirmed in 2015, and are updated currently. Prevention strategies include definition of policies, education, and strict adherence to guidelines. In pediatrics, among the most important interventions are separation of children with respiratory tract illnesses from well children and consistent implementation of respiratory etiquette or cough hygiene.

Despite the emphasis on safe injection practices, transmission of hepatitis B and C viruses continues to be reported in ambulatory care settings as a result of failure to follow recommended practices, thus indicating a need to reiterate the established effective practices. 77 During 2008 to 2014, 45 outbreaks (\u22652 cases) of viral hepatitis related to healthcare were reported to the CDC; of these, 42 (95%) occurred in nonhospital settings.

Am J Infect Control 2007;35(Suppl 2):S65-S164.combination, such precautions always are used in addition to Standard Precautions. Transmission-based precautions applied at the time of initial contact, based on the clinical presentation and the most likely pathogens are referred to as Empiric Precautions or Syndromic Precautions. This approach is useful especially for emerging agents (e.g., SARS-CoV, avian influenza, pandemic influenza), for which information concerning routes of transmission is evolving. The categories of clinical presentation are as follows: diarrhea, central nervous system, generalized rash or exanthem, respiratory, skin or wound infection. Single-patient rooms always are preferred for children needing Transmission-Based Precautions. If singlepatient rooms are unavailable, cohorting of patients, and preferably of staff, according to clinical diagnosis is recommended. The experience of treating EVD in the US in 2014 led to the development of special precautions after viral transmission to 2 nurses occurred as a result of patients' extraordinarily high viral loads and large volumes of emitted body fluids.6 PPE for all transmission-based precautions is donned upon entry into the room to protect against acquisition of pathogens from contaminated surfaces, even if direct contact with the patient is not intended.",
