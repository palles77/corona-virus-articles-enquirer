Here, we proved that three cysteines within the motif, but not dependent on position, are minimally required for the survival of the recombinant mouse hepatitis virus. When the carboxy termini with these mutated motifs of S proteins were respectively introduced into a heterogeneous protein, both incorporation into lipid rafts and S-palmitoylation of these recombinant proteins showed a similar quantity requirement to cysteine residues. Meanwhile, the redistribution of these proteins on cellular surface indicated that the absence of the positively charged rather than cysteine residues in the motif might lead the dramatic reduction in syncytial formation of some mutants with the deleted motifs. These results suggest that multiple cysteine as well as charged residues concurrently improves the membrane-associated functions of S protein in viral replication and cytopathogenesis.",

Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a member of the group II of coronaviruses (now called genus Betacoronavirus) (Carstens and Ball, 2009) , causes neurovirulence and hepatitis in rodents, such as mice and rats (Weiss and Navas-Martin, 2005) . MHV has been used extensively for in vivo studies of neurovirulence and mechanisms of coronavirus entry and assembly (Masters, 2006) . Three membrane proteins, including the spike (S), envelope and membrane proteins, are incorporated into the envelope of MHV virions (Masters, 2006; Siddell, 1995) . The S protein is a 180 kDa, N-glycosylated, type I membrane protein which is generally cleaved into separate N-terminal S1 and C-terminal S2 subunits. The main component of the S protein is the ectodomain (Ecto) in which a few functional domains have been clearly described. These include the receptor-binding domain from S1 as well as the fusion peptide and two heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2) from S2. The Ecto is responsible for the cellular tropism and membrane fusion in coronavirus infection (Masters, 2006; Siddell, 1995) . The minor part of the S protein is composed of a transmembrane domain (Tm) and an endodomain (Endo).",

We have found that a 13-residue deletion leaving only four to five cysteine residues in the motif reduced syncytia formation dramatically but did not distinctly affect the replication of recombinant MHVs in mouse L2 cells, suggesting that these residues in the motif play different roles in virion assembly and trafficking of the S protein to the plasma membrane (Yang et al., 2011; Ye et al., 2004) .",

There was no single \"key\" cysteine residue required in the motif for virus replication. However, at least three cysteine residues were found to be required for the survival of recombinant MHVs. Immunofluorescence analysis of the heterogeneous hook proteins (HK) expressed by recombinant MHVs (Yang et al., 2011; Ye et al., 2004) showed that the dramatic reduction of the cytopathic effect (CPE) of recombinant MHVs with a partial deletion of motif did not involve these cysteines. This effect might result from the deletion of some of the charged residues in the motif, which decreased the amount of S protein on the surfaces of infected cells. Furthermore, both incorporation into detergent-resistant membrane fractions (DRM) and the S-palmitoylation level of these recombinant protein were examined. Results showed that an association into lipid rafts and S-palmitoylation of the recombinant protein with a deletion motif containing six cysteines not only was detected but also exhibited a similar level to that of wild-type motif. However, the protein with a deletion motif containing only two cysteines could not be detected.",

The statistical analysis showed that the partial deletion mutant (Mut-d3) produced smaller plaques compared with other point mutants (Mut-p2 to -p7) that could be further divided into three groups from small to large: Mut-p4, -p5, and -p7; Mut-p2 and -p3; Mut-6. The tendency might be associated with the importance of these mutated cysteines in the motif. We observed that there was no significant difference between one and two cysteine substitution. Also, the substitution with alanine, serine, or glycine showed the similar effect. Notably, the boundary of the plaques formed by Mut-d3 seemed to be much fuzzy and the plaque size of Mut-p7 had a bigger deviation (Fig. 1B) .

To determine the exact number of cysteines required for the survival of MHV, mutant viruses with only one to six cysteines left in the CR motif of S gene were constructed ( Fig. 2A) . Meanwhile, in order to facilitate the detection of viral survival, gene 4 was replaced by an EGFP reporter in these mutants ( Fig. 2A) . L2 cells were infected with supernatants of the various mutant MHVs produced by targeted RNA recombination and visualised by microscopy at 24 h post infection (hpi). The recombinant MHVs containing one to four cysteine residues in the motif (MH54GFP-1C to -4C) failed to induce any visible syncytia, and the recombinant MHVs with five or six cysteine residues in the motif (MH54GFP-5C and -6C) induced only light syncytia formation (Fig. 2B) . Fluorescent microscopy showed that the MH54GFP-1C and -2C mutant viruses failed to express EGFP, that the MH54EGFP-3C virus expressed a low level of EGFP, and that the MH54GFP-4C, -5C and -6C mutants expressed a high level of EGFP (Fig. 2C ). These results indicated that the replication of the virus depends on the number of cysteine residues in the CR motif and that at least three cysteines in the motif are required for the viability of the recombinant MHVs.",

The mobility of the HKM and HK-6C proteins was significantly altered, whereas that of the HK-2C and HKP mutants was not (Fig. 5B) . These results indicated that the level of S-palmitoylation is correlated with the number of cysteine residues in the CR motif of the S protein endodomain. Moreover, the level of S-palmitoylation is consistent not only with the survival of the recombinant MHV ( Fig. 2) but also with the association of S protein in lipid rafts of the infected cells (Fig. 4) .",

One set, in which substitution or deletion mutations of the CR were directly located in the S protein Endo, was constructed to determine the survival and plaque morphology of recombinant MHVs in mouse L2 cells (Figs. 1 and 2) . The other set of recombinant MHVs was comprised of the S gene and the replacement of the hemagglutinin-esterase gene with a foreign Hook gene Ye et al., 2004 ). These recombinant viruses were able to infect mouse Neuro-2a cells and express the recombinant HK proteins (Yang et al., 2011) . The HA-tagged non-viral scFv Ecto of HK served as a surrogate for the S protein Ecto and was designed to eliminate possible interference of the cysteine residues in the S protein ectodomain. The HK proteins with four types of Tm/Endo combinations, constructed from wild type protein, mutated MHV S protein (HKM, HK-2C and -6C) and truncated PDGFR (HKP), were used to analyse the membraneassociated functions (Figs. 3 to 5 ). In addition, the non-essential gene 4 of MHV was replaced with the reporter gene EGFP in some recombinant MHVs (Das Sarma et al., 2002; Hurst et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2011) (Figs. 2C and 3B) .",

In this study, the cysteines in the CR motif were mutated either alone or in combination with alanine, glycine, or serine, and no specific cysteine was found to be crucial for the survival of the recombinant MHVs (Fig. 1) . The difference in the plaque morphology among these survived mutants implied that some cysteines may play more important roles in viral replication. We found that the plaques of Mut-p7 and Mut-d3 were uneven and slightly smaller than those of Mut-p2 and -p3, but the plaques of Mut-p6 were slightly larger than those of the other mutants (Figs. 1B and C) . The two cysteines in this region were more important for the incorporation of S proteins into virions, which consolidated previous results (Shulla and Gallagher, 2009; Ye et al., 2004) . On the other hand, the deletion of the CR motif (Mut-d1), the partial deletion of the motif near the Tm (Mut-d2), and the mutation of all nine cysteines to alanines (Mut-p1) were lethal for the recombinant MHVs, which indicated that six cysteines close to the Tm might be critical for survival of recombinant viruses (Fig. 1B) . Further, three cysteines in centre of CR motif (Mut-3 and Mut-4) might play more important role in viral replication (Figs. 1B and C).",

To verify this hypothesis, some deletion mutations of the motif retained one to six cysteines were introduced into recombinant MHVs in which the EGFP reporter gene was substituted for gene 4 ( Fig. 2A) . These results indicated that only the recombinant MHVs with three or more cysteines were viable (Fig. 2C) . However, the ability to induce syncytia by the recombinant MHVs with only three to six cysteines in S protein CR motif was dramatically decreased in L2 cells (Fig. 2B) . The decreased CPE was consistent with results of previous studies (Yang et al., 2011; Ye et al., 2004) .",

The distribution of the wild type S Endo (HKM) or PDGFR Endo (HKP) mutants was in the plasma membrane and on the cell surface. However, the mutants with truncated CR motifs (HK-2C and -6C) were distributed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3) . This redistribution of recombinant proteins might be attributed to the deletion of some of the positively charged residues other than the cysteines in the motif. The charged residues, located on the cytoplasmic tail of transmembrane proteins, generally serve as the trafficking and sorting signals to different membrane compartments, including the plasma membrane (Itin et al., 1995) . Further investigation of the charged residues in the CR motif of the MHV S will be needed to address this issue.",

In brief, infected monolayers of Neuro-2a cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and dissolved in 300 \u03bcl of IPP buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, pH 8.0) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail. Cell lysates were held on ice for 5 min and then clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 \u00d7g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. Clarified lysates were mixed with 15 \u03bcl of Anti-HA Affinity Matrix (Roche) by inversion overnight at 4\u00b0C. The matrix was precipitated by centrifuging at 12,000 \u00d7g for 30 s, and the supernatant was carefully removed. The matrix was washed with 1 ml of cold IPP buffer three times. The final rinsed matrix was suspended in 60 \u03bcl of 2 \u00d7 SDS sample buffer and heated at 95\u00b0C for 5 min. The immunoprecipitated proteins were divided into two parts. One was mixed with an equal volume of 2 M hydroxylamine (Sigma-Aldrich) in water at room temperature for 1 h, and the other was mixed with an equal volume of water as a control. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE with 4-20% gradient gel (Bio-Rad) and characterised by Western blotting using an anti-HA tag mAb (Roche).",

Masters (Wadsworth Center of New York State Department of Health, Albany, New York) for generously providing the plasmids and cell lines used in the generation of the recombinant MHVs and for valuable suggestions in manuscript preparation. S-palmitoylation could occur at all cysteines (C, in blue) in the motif, while the primary site may require a residue cluster containing at least three cysteines. The S-palmitoylation would be enhanced by extra cysteines in the motif and lead proteins to incorporate to lipid rafts. Two positive-changed lysine residues (KK, in red) in the motif might serve as a signal for transportation of S protein to cellular surface. The S-palmitoylation at the site between the transportation signal and the terminal cluster of negative-charged residues, a putative motif interaction with M protein of the virus, is crucial for viral assembly and entry.
