Both the pH and the NaC1 concentration of the extraction buffer were varied in attempts to increase the solubility of the virion spike glycoproteins (S-protein) and of the nucleocapsid proteins (N-protein). Monoclonal antibodies, hyperimmune sera and convalescent pig sera were used to identify and monitor these proteins by immunoprecipitation and Western blots. The solubility of the S-protein was optimal at pH 4, whereas that of the N-protein was optimal at pH 9. Consequently, it was possible to enrich for either S-protein or N-protein; increases in the NaC! concentration of the buffer were of no advantage in this respect. Enriched preparations of the S-protein and N-protein were used as ELISA antigen for the S-ELISA and N-ELISA, respectively. The S-ELISA proved to be the more effective of the two immunoassays. Antibodies against S-protein remained detectable for longer periods of time than anti-N-protein antibodies in the sera of PEDV-infected pigs. Using this ELISA of increased sensitivity, it was observed that only a small number of farms in Switzerland had been infected with PEDV.",

The major glycoprotein had an apparent molecular weight of 85 kD, most likely representing the monomeric form of the spike protein (S-protein). A second, RNA-binding protein, which was probably the nucleocapsid protein (N-protein), had a molecular weight of 58 kD. The third protein, which was in fact a cluster of proteins with molecular weights ranging from 20 to 32 kD, was apparently a glycoprotein and may have represented the integral membrane glycoprotein (M-protein).",

A less complicated method of antigen preparation would facilitate the application of ELISA for large-scale serological testing, e.g. for serological survey studies. (ii) The authors pointed out that their ELISA antigen consisted mostly of N-protein, with only a small number of spikes. N-proteins carry antigenic determinants which are conserved among the coronaviridae (Horzinek et al., 1982; Yaling et al., 1988; J6hr, 1989) , whereas the antigenic determinants of S-protein induce more specific antibodies (Talbot and Buchmeier, 1985; Jacobs et al., 1987; Correa et al., 1988 ) .

Slightly more S-protein could be accumulated in the soluble fractions when 0.125 or 0.25 M NaC1 was added to the lysates (data not shown). However, the solubility of N-protein also improved with the addition of NaC1, and the gain, in terms of accumulating S-protein whilst removing N-protein, was marginal.

Hofmann and Wyler (1987) had previously reported an anti-PEDV seroprevalence of 1.6% in Switzerland. However, in 1989 we were unable to detect seropositive animals in the cantons of Lucerne or Berne. Nevertheless, in order to perform a sero-epidemiological survey, the sample size would have to be increased, samples from all relevant areas of Switzerland would be required, and, above all, fattening pigs would have to be included. It is clear, however, that the S-ELISA would be the method of choice for such an analysis, since it provides a rapid, sensitive and defined assay for the detection and analysis of the antibody response against PED virus.",
