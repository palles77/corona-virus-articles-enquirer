However, in countries with relatively few cases, transmission was much rarer. This finding suggests that infection control measures are adequate to interrupt transmission to HCWs, but consistency is critical because the greater number of opportunities for lapses in the hardest hit centers likely led to more HCW infections. 7 The incubation period of SARS-CoV is between 2 and 10 days. 8 Diagnosis is based on polymerase chain reaction testing. Treatments attempted included corticosteroids and ribavirin, which were not found to be beneficial. Supportive care remains the cornerstone of care for SARS-CoV, although in vitro studies suggest that antivirals developed in the wake of the Ebola virus epidemic may inhibit SARS-CoV replication as well. 9 MERS-COV MERS-CoV was first reported in September 2012. 10 The virus was isolated from sputum of a man in Saudi Arabia hospitalized with a respiratory tract infection. 10 Since then, more than 2400 cases of MERS-CoV have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) in and around the Arabian Peninsula. 11 Periodic infections and localized outbreaks have continued. Similar to SARS-CoV, presentation is typically fever with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection and radiographic evidence of pneumonia or ARDS. Other manifestations might include renal failure, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Again, HCWs were disproportionately infected, although a large number of those cases were mild or asymptomatic. 7 The incubation period of MERS-CoV ranges from 1 to 14 days. Diagnosis is made by identifying the virus in respiratory samples by polymerase chain reaction testing. Treatment is largely supportive, 11 focusing on management of complications of sepsis and ARDS in intensive care units. Antivirals such as ribavirin and interferonbased treatments have had questionable benefit, but the role for these treatments remains experimental. 12 ",

Protection against this type of transmission involves use of face masks with eye protection, gloves, gowns, and hand hygiene. There is concern that airborne transmission may also be playing a role. This possibility is more problematic because airborne infectious particles can remain suspended in the air for long periods, the infection can be transmitted to larger numbers of people including those not in close contact with the index case, and protective measures include wearing a respirator and patient placement in negative air pressure rooms that may not be available at all medical centers. At the present time, the CDC recommends a combination of airborne precautions (patient placement in a negative air pressure room, HCWs to wear respirators), contact precautions (HCWs to wear gloves and gowns for all patient contact), and use of eye protection for patients hospitalized with suspected COVID-19 infection.",
