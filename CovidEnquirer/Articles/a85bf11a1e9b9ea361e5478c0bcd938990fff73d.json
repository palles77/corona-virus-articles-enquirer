This was a prospective year-round viral surveillance study in children <2 years of age admitted with acute respiratory symptoms and/or fever from March 2010 to September 2012 and enrolled from a government-run hospital, Al-Bashir in Amman, Jordan. Clinical and demographic data, including antibiotic use, were collected. Combined nasal/throat swabs were collected, aliquoted, and frozen at \u00c080\u00b0C. Specimen aliquots were shipped to Vanderbilt University and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and tested by rRT-PCR for MERS-CoV. Of the and tested at Vanderbilt, none were positive for MERS-CoV. Our negative findings from a large sample of young Jordanian children hospitalized with fever and/or respiratory symptoms suggest that MERS-CoV was not widely circulating in Amman, Jordan, during the 30-month period of prospective, active surveillance occurring before and after the first documented MERS-CoV outbreak in the Middle East region.",

Coronaviruses are a diverse group of positive-strand RNA viruses that commonly infect the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of mammals and birds. Human coronaviruses are most commonly associated with mild respiratory illnesses, but can cause severe illness, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. Genetic sequencing data indicate that the MERS-CoV is a betacoronavirus closely related to two bat coronaviruses (HKU4 and HKU5), but distinct from other human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV [1, 3] .",

The cases have originated from the following countries Middle Eastern countries to date: Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Tunisia and the United Kingdom have also reported laboratory-confirmed cases [2, 4, 5] . The first known MERS-CoV infections were detected retrospectively as occurring in April 2012 in Jordan [6] . Based on confirmed cases to date, the clinical syndrome consists of febrile illness and pneumonia, as well as renal failure in some patients. The majority of reported cases have been in adults and 64 of 151 cases have been fatal (42%) [4] . Some cases have occurred in clusters. One cluster involved two cases, both fatal, occurring near Amman, Jordan (Zarga, 20 km in distance), in April 2012 [6] . Stored samples from these two cases (one hospital worker and one student) tested positive for MERS-CoV retrospectively, and this cluster was temporally associated with cases of illness among hospital workers. Several other clusters suggested human transmission [5, 7, 8] ; although the risk of sustained transmission is unknown [2, 5] .",

A critical question is whether the cases identified thus far are the only MERS-CoV infections or whether the virus has circulated more widely undetected. This is of interest in light of the epidemiology of SARS-CoV, where infections in children < 12 years of age were generally milder, with no mortality and few hospitalizations [9] . To determine whether MERS-CoV was present among young paediatric ARI cases before, during and after the occurrence of the Zarga, Jordan MERS-CoV cluster, we tested upper respiratory tract specimens collected from a prospective study of paediatric ARI hospitalizations in Amman, Jordan, from March 2010 to September 2012.",

Young children are known to be a source of respiratory viral transmission; therefore, our negative findings epidemiologically suggest that MERS-CoV may not have been widely circulating in nearby metropolitan Amman, Jordan, during this interval. This is an important finding because there remains uncertainty over whether confirmed MERS-CoV cases are more likely to be detected due to the severity of illness, and the full extent to which MERS-CoV circulates more widely causing mild illness [8] . Nevertheless, further surveillance is still needed in the Arabian Peninsula and neighbouring countries to monitor current circulation and possible emergence of widespread transmission. The majority of the MERS-CoV cases reported to date have been in adults and the common symptoms have included fever, cough and shortness of breath, with a high proportion of cases resulting in death [1, 2, 5, 6, 8] .",

Nose/ throat swabs obtained during acute respiratory disease were tested, and the sensitivity of this specimen type for detecting MERS-CoV is currently unknown. The CDC recommends collecting respiratory specimens from different sites and at different stages of the illness, with lower respiratory tract specimens prioritized, but existing routine surveillance in the Middle East and elsewhere typically focuses on nose/throat swabs [5, 14] . Only samples that tested negative for a virus were sent to the CDC for testing; therefore, we may have missed instances of MERS-CoV co-infections, but all respiratory samples collected after the first MERS-CoV cluster occured in Jordan in April 2012 were tested. However, a strength of our study is that we tested almost 1000 children hospitalized with ARI symptoms for MERS-CoV.
