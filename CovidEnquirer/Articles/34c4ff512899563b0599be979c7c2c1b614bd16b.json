Th e small bronchi and bronchioles 2 mm in diameter are spread out from the fourth to the fourteenth generation of airway branching [2] . Th e total airway cross-sectional area expands rapidly beyond the 2 mm airways to provide for rapid diff usion of gas between the distal conducting airways and the gas-exchanging surface. Th e central conducting airways larger than 2 mm internal diameter are the major site of resistance to airfl ow in the n ormal lung because of their much smaller total cross-sectional area [3, 4] .",

Th e submucosa between the epithelium and outer edge of the muscle layer is often referred to as the \" lamina propria, \" but this term is technically incorrect because many airways are not completely surrounded by muscle [6] . Bronchi are defi ned by the presence of a layer of fi brocartilage external to the smooth muscle and tubuloalveolar glands, which communicate with the airway lumen via ducts [7] . Bronchioles lack both cartilage and glands and become respiratory bronchioles when alveoli open directly into their lumen [7] . Th e lining of the trachea and major bronchi consists of pseudostratifi ed, ciliated columnar epithelium which gradually becomes more cuboidal with fewer ciliated cells as the alveolar surface is approached [6] [7] [8] . Light microscopy reveals that the basal aspect of airway epithelial cells is attached to a thin basement membrane (80-90 nm width) that contains primarily type IV collagen and elastin [9] . Transmission electron microscopy shows that a true basement membrane or basal lamina can be readily distinguished from the connective tissue observed with the light microscope [6, 7] .

In the trachea and mainstem bronchi, the airway smooth muscle is located within the posterior membranous sheath, whereas, in the bronchioles, it surrounds the entire lumen of the airway [7, 8, 13] . Consequently, the same degree of muscle shortening has a smaller eff ect on the caliber of the trachea and central airways than on the distal bronchi and bronchioles [14] . Th e adventitial layer consists of loose bundles of collagen admixed with blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves. In the peripheral conducting airways, this layer interacts with the surrounding lung parenchyma through alveolar attachments that are distributed along the circumference of the adventitia. Th ese alveolar attachments have the ability to limit the amount of airway narrowing produced by smooth muscle contraction, particularly at higher lung volumes [14] .",

Th ey may originate from the fi rst to the third intercostal artery, from the right internal mammary artery, or from the right subclavian artery [8, 15] . Miller's classic anatomical account [8] showed that two to three arterial branches accompany each of the larger bronchi and that anastomoses between these branches form an arterial plexus in the outer wall of the airway. Small branches of this plexus penetrate the smooth muscle layer to form a capillary network below the epithelium. Short connecting branches extend from this plexus through the muscle layer to form a second plexus of venules along the outer surface of the airway smooth muscle ( Fig. 6. 2 ). In some species, this outer plexus contains large venous sinuses that can extend into the submucosal layer of the major bronchi, where there is no smooth muscle between the cartilage and epithelium [16] .",

Th ey are similar in structure to the tonsils and adenoids, the Peyers patches in the small bowel, and the appendix of the cecum which are also part of the mucosal immune system. Th ey are organized in the same way as other lymph follicles ( Fig. 6. 3 ) in that the B-cells are found in the germinal center of the follicle and the CD4 and CD8 T-cells are located around the edges of the germinal center. Th us dendritic cells migrating from the epithelium and subepithelium circulate through the T-and B-cell rich regions of the follicle and can present antigen to uncommitted T and B lymphocytes moving through these regions in the lymph ( Fig. 6 .3 ). Moreover the recirculation of lymphocytes though the follicle and back into the circulation enhances the opportunity for T Helper cells and B-cells that have recognized the same antigen to interact with each other and initiate an adaptive immune response. Th e appearance of lymphoid follicles with germinal centers in the tissue provides histological evidence that an adaptive immune response has been mounted within the peripheral lung. Some investigators have begun to study this response in detail [18] .",

Th ey emphasized the presence of intraluminal mucus secretion, airway epithelial desquamation, and repair (e.g. goblet cell metaplasia), and airway infl ammatory infi ltrates consisting of an admixture of mononuclear cells and eosinophils and the presence of a thickened, \" hyalinized \" subepithelial basement membrane. Later studies based on electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry showed that this feature of the basement membrane was due to deposition of collagen fi brils and extracellular matrix below the true basement membrane, rather than thickening of the basal lamina. Huber and Koessler's report noted that the tenacious plugs that fi ll the airway lumen consist of an exudate of plasma containing infl ammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, mixed with epithelial cells that had sloughed from the airway surface. Using an eyepiece micrometer to measure the external airway diameters, they concluded that the walls of bronchi and bronchioli of more than 2 mm outside diameter were thickened compared with non-asthmatic persons, and that this diff erence was due to an increased thickness of all of the components of the airway wall.",

Both clones produced IL-3 and GMCSF, and interactions between Th -1 and Th -2 subtypes allowed one type of clone to inhibit the other. For example, IL-4 is a mast cell growth factor that also stimulates IgE production, and IL-5 promotes the diff erentiation and survival of eosinophils. Robinson and associates [36] put forward the hypothesis that asthma was the result of a \" Th -2 response \" based on bronchoalveolar lavage and bronchial biopsy fi ndings.

Moreno and associates [39] calculated that the thickening of the airway wall observed in asthma would have only a minor eff ect on the caliber of the lumen of a fully dilated airway. However, when the smooth muscle in the airway shortens, the increased tissue between the muscle and lumen causes an excess reduction in airway c aliber. Subsequent studies by James et al. [40] showed that the increase in wall thickness observed in the small airways of asthmatics was suffi cient to close the lumen of these airways, even when smooth muscle shortening remained within the accepted normal range. Th is suggests that normal smooth muscle shortening may act in series with an abnormally thickened airway wall to narrow the airway lumen and it follows that the reduction in airway caliber produced by this mechanism would be rapidly reversed when the smooth muscle relaxed. Th is showed that an important feature of the pathology of asthma was the change in the structure of the airway wall produced by the remodeling of the tissue that occurs in relation to the infl ammatory p rocess. Th e important point is that these structural changes could result in excess airway narrowing with normal smooth muscle contraction and that excessive smooth muscle shortening will enhance the eff ect of these structural changes on the airway lumen.",

Th eir analysis ( Fig. 6.4 ) showed that maximum stimulation of the smooth muscle caused airway resistance to increase and reach a plateau in the normal lung. Th is fi nding was consistent with previous observations by Woolcock et al. [43] , who reported that the changes in the maximum volume of air that can be expired from the lung in 1 s (FEV 1 ) reached a plateau in normal subjects when maximally stimulated by inhaled bronchoconstrictors. However, when the data on airway structure were changed from normal values to those found in asthmatic lungs, a similar degree of airway smooth shortening resulted in a sustained rapid increase in airway resistance without a plateau. When the eff ect of disease on the central and peripheral airway function was examined separately, they found that the increase in airway resistance was primarily due to the eff ect of disease on the peripheral airways, where smooth muscle shortening produced widespread airway closure.

Lambert [45] was the fi rst to systematically study the normal folding pattern of the bronchial mucosa, and showed that in asthma the multiple mucosal folds that occur when normal airways narrow were replaced with fewer and larger folds that reduced airway caliber. Both Lambert and Wiggs et al . [46] suggested that the mucosal folding pattern was controlled by the stiff ness of the subepithelial layer relative to that of the surrounding airway tissue. Th is analysis suggested that changes in the subepithelial connective tissue might play a key role in determining the pattern of mucosal folding. Lambert and Wiggs et al . argued that the formation of a large number of folds in the normal airway placed a load on the airway smooth muscle that tended to prevent airway closure at low lung volumes. It followed that a change in the mucosal folding pattern in asthma may be one way in which this disease causes peripheral airway dysfunction.",

Exudation of plasma and the secretion of mucus on to the small airway lumen surface should increase surface tension and cause the airways to narrow. Th e analysis of induced sputum has confi rmed that plasma proteins, mucus, and infl ammatory cells are present in the airway lumen even in mild asthma, suggesting that some of the abnormalities in airway function of asthmatics might result from the presence of this material in the lumen. Kuyper and colleagues [48] recently re-assessed the importance of the occlusion of the airway lumen by infl ammatory exudates in deaths attributed to asthma. By examining the airway wall and luminal content of 275 airways from 93 patients with fatal asthma aged 10-49 years. Compared with control airways obtained from persons that died of causes unrelated to the lungs, the asthmatic airways showed much more extensive lumenal occlusion, by mucus and cells. Th ey concluded that widespread airway occlusion [38, 39] ) showing results from a computer model of the airways. The structural data from normal lungs were used to obtain the control measurements. These show that airway resistance increases from about 1 cmH 2 O per liter per second to reach a plateau of 12 cmH 2 O per liter per second, with maximum contraction of the airways smooth muscle. (A) When the structural features of asthmatic airways were used in the same computer model, the airway resistance continued to increase and did not reach a plateau at any physiologically meaningful value. (B) Data obtained from the model when the structural changes caused by asthma were limited to the central airway (i.e. those \u03fe 2 mm diameter). Note that asthmatic changes in the central airways increased total resistance and resulted in a plateau slightly greater than the control lungs. (C) However, when the asthmatic changes were placed in the peripheral airway, the resistance increased without reaching a plateau. These data suggest that asthmatic changes in the peripheral airways have a much greater eff ect on overall airway function than changes that occur in the central airways. Reproduced from Ref.

Reid [54] used the relative size of the mucus glands to the airway wall as a yardstick for measuring chronic bronchitis and downplayed the infl uence of i nfl ammation in driving mucus production. However, a reevaluation of this problem some years later showed that chronic bronchitis was associated with infl ammation of the airway mucosal surface, the submucosal glands, and gland ducts, particularly in the smaller bronchi between 2 and 4 mm in diameter [49] .

Comparison of the histological appearance of peripheral airways at diff erent degrees of severity of COPD shows a progressive increase in the magnitude of the infl ammatory process with thickening of the airway walls accompanied by occlusion of the airway lumen by infl ammatory mucous exudates [17] . However, multivariate analysis of 6.6 (A) Shows a small bronchiole from a patient with severe (GOLD-4) COPD the lumen is nearly fully occluded and the mucosa is folded because it was fi xed in a collapsed state. (B) Shows a redrawing of the same airway where the lumen occlusion is less severe because the airway has been fully infl ated by removing the folds from the mucosa using a computer (C) Compares the frequency distribution of the ratio of luminal content area to the total area of the lumen for \u03fe 562 airways from 42 patients with GOLD-4 COPD before and after the expansion of the lumen shown in A and B. As we do not breathe at either full expansion of the lung or at minimal volume many airways must have been partially or fully occluded in the normal breathing range. (D) Shows the relationship between the severity of the occlusion of the airway lumen with the level of FEV 1 . Adapted from Ref. [17] with permission. these data indicated that thickening of the airway walls and the occlusion of the lumen by infl ammatory exudates containing mucus explained more of the variance in the decline in FEV 1 than the infi ltration of the airway tissue by any of the infl ammatory cell types examined [17] . Interestingly the severity of the occlusion of the airways lumen by infl ammatory exudates containing mucus ( Fig. 6.6 ) has also associated with premature death in persons with severe (GOLD-3) and very severe (GOLD-4) disease [68] .",

Th is defi nition emphasizes the destruction of the alveolar surface with a minimal reparative response in the lung matrix and the ability of this destructive process to reduce the gas-exchanging surface of the lung. Th e centrilobular form of emphysema ( Fig. 6.7 ) resulting from dilatation and destruction of the respiratory bronchioles in the center of secondary lobule of Miller has been most closely associated with smoking [80, 82] . Th e panacinar form of emphysema, on the other hand, results from a uniform destruction of all of the acini in the entire secondary lobule and is characteristic of the lesions found in the lungs in \u03b1 1 -antitrypsin defi ciency [83] . Th e terms \" distal acinar, \" \" mantle, \" or \" periseptal \" emphysema are used to describe lesions that occur in the periphery of the lobule and along the lobular septae particularly in the subpleural region. Th ese lesions have been associated with spontaneous pneumothorax in young adults and bullous lung disease in older individuals [84] . In far-advanced parenchymal destruction such as that frequently observed in end-stage COPD, these descriptive terms are less helpful because centrilobular disease eventually destroys the entire lung lobule and destroyed lobules can coalesce to form much larger lesions.",

            "text": "In a hospital-based study of 1205 admissions to fi ve hospitals for acute exacerbations of COPD, infections accounted for 520 (43%), heart failure for 260 (22%), and 122 (10%) cases were attributed to a variety of etiologies that included arrhythmia, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, postoperative complications, and lung cancer [86] , with no cause being established in 303 (25%) of these 1205 admissions. Early studies by Stuart-Harris and associates [87, 88] showed that COPD patients with acute upper respiratory infections are more likely to have signs of infection in the lower airways than normal controls. Probably because acute viral upper respiratory tract infections increase the risk of aspiration of mucoid exudate containing large numbers of bacteria from the upper airways, but also because viral infection reduces both the mucociliary clearance and bacterial killing in the lower airways [89] [90] [91] . Streptococcus pneumonia , Staphylococcus aureus , and Hemophilus infl uenzae are the most common bacteria infecting the lower airways during an acute viral infection [90, 91] , and these infections account for the positive eff ect of antibiotics in some exacerbations of COPD [92] . Two important early studies established an association between acute illness and serologic laboratory evidence of viral infection in patients with COPD [93, 94] . Th e development of polymerized chain reaction (PCR)-based viral diagnostic techniques have improved the sensitivity of the diagnosis of viral infection and the use of real time PCR to measure viral copy numbers will likely improve its specifi city. Early reports of studies based on these techniques indicate the importance of rhinoviral infection in causing acute exacerbations in an outpatient setting with infl uenza A and the corona virus OC-43 being more prominent causes of exacerbations that require admission to hospital [95] [96] [97] . Th e pathological features of the lung during acute exacerbations of COPD are incompletely defi ned. Primarily because postmortem studies of patients that die during exacerbations are complicated by terminal events and biopsy studies of patients with severe (GOLD-3 and very severe GOLD-4 disease during an exacerbation cannot be carried out without excess risk to the patient. One exception is an important study by Saetta et al . [98] in less severely ill patients with GOLD class 2 disease and a mean FEV 1 of 62 \u03ee 7% predicted implicated the eosinophil as a cell of interest. Clearly more studies especially those that can make use of non-invasive or less invasive techniques than biopsy are needed to help clarify this important area of COPD.",

Th e airway obstruction in COPD is the result of a similar infl ammatory response in the smaller bronchi and bronchioles under 2 mm internal diameter, where the repair process associated with chronic infl ammation thickens the airway wall and narrows the lumen to cause fi xed airway obstruction. Emphysematous destruction of the lung surface contributes to the decline in FEV 1 by reducing the elastic recoil force available to drive air out of the lung and is responsible for reduced gas exchange. Th e acute exacerbations of COPD that occur with increasing frequency as the disease progresses have several known causes including infection, right heart failure, and pulmonary embolism but it is discouraging that in up to 25% of cases admitted to hospital the cause is unknown.",
