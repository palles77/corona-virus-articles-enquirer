            "text": "New approaches are urgently needed to evaluate potential hazards posed by exposure to nanomaterials. Gene expression profiling provides information on potential modes of action and human relevance, and tools have recently become available for pathway-based quantitative risk assessment. The objective of this study was to use toxicogenomics in the context of human health risk assessment. We explore the utility of toxicogenomics in risk assessment, using published gene expression data from C57BL/6 mice exposed to 18, 54 and 162 g Printex 90 carbon black nanoparticles (CBNP). Analysis of CBNP-perturbed pathways, networks and transcription factors revealed concomitant changes in predicted phenotypes (e.g., pulmonary inflammation and genotoxicity), that correlated with dose and time. Benchmark doses (BMDs) for apical endpoints were comparable to minimum BMDs for relevant pathway-specific expression changes. Comparison to inflammatory lung disease models (i.e., allergic airway inflammation, bacterial infection and tissue injury and fibrosis) and human disease profiles revealed that induced gene expression changes in Printex 90 exposed mice were similar to those typical for pulmonary injury and fibrosis. Very similar fibrotic pathways were perturbed in CBNP-exposed mice and human fibrosis disease models. Our synthesis demonstrates how toxicogenomic profiles may be used in human health risk assessment of nanoparticles and constitutes an important step forward in the ultimate recognition of toxicogenomic endpoints in human health risk. As our knowledge of molecular pathways, dose-response characteristics and relevance to human disease continues to grow, we anticipate that toxicogenomics will become increasingly useful in assessing chemical toxicities and in human health risk assessment.",

Human exposure to manufactured nanomaterials (NMs), which have at least one size dimension that is less than 100 nm, may constitute an increased risk of adverse effects especially following inhalation exposure, and their potential to induce toxic effects is poorly understood (Handy and Shaw, 2007) . Moreover, the human health risks associated with inhalation exposure have not been adequately investigated. Methods that can be effective in screening for NM toxicities are paramount, due to the countless variations in physical and chemical properties of NMs in terms of size, shape, agglomeration and surface coatings.",

            "text": "Traditional assays used in human health risk assessment (HHRA) generally involve chronic and subchronic rodent exposures with concomitant analyses of tumour induction (e.g., two-year rodent cancer bioassay), in addition to various non-cancer endpoints, the most sensitive of which is used for regulatory decision-making (Meek et al., 1994) . These approaches form the foundation of the chemical regulatory system and have been invaluable for HHRA. However, some of these assays, such as those based on chronic animal exposures at the maximum tolerated dose, are time and resource intensive, thus limiting broad application (Suter et al., 2004) . Recent discussions have identified gene expression profiling as a potentially rapid and cost-effective approach for identifying and assessing prospective hazard, characterizing chemical (or particle) mode of action, and assessing human relevance in support of HHRA (National Academy of Sciences, 2007) . In order for gene expression data to become accepted for routine use in HHRA, it is necessary to demonstrate that mRNA/protein expression profiles can effectively predict the modes of action and biological outcomes of exposure at relevant doses, and to confirm that these data can be used to strengthen the foundation for HHRA and regulatory decisions. In this regard, it has been hypothesized that gene expression profiling will be extremely useful in identifying effects at low doses, and moreover, useful for distinguishing between doses that elicit an adaptive response vs. those that yield adverse effects (Boverhof and Zacharewski, 2006) . To date, the application of gene expression profiling in regulatory toxicology has largely focused on qualitative identification of chemical modes of action and transcription biomarkers that can predict specific toxicities. However, the utility of gene expression profiling in quantitative determination of threshold values (e.g., benchmark doses) has not yet been rigorously explored .",

In addition, we quantitatively compare benchmark doses for pathways to those of apical endpoints derived from the same experimental animals. We employ Printex 90 as a model NM due to the rich database of traditional toxicity information on which our findings can be anchored. Briefly, Printex 90 consists almost entirely of carbon, with very low levels of impurities in terms of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and endotoxins (Bourdon et al., 2012b; Jacobsen et al., 2008; Saber et al., 2011) They generate reactive oxygen species (Jacobsen et al., 2008) , induce DNA strand breaks in vitro and in vivo (Jacobsen et al., 2009; Saber et al., 2005) and mutations in vitro (Jacobsen et al., 2007) that are associated with oxidative stress . The data in this study are from previously published experiments investigating Printex 90 CBNP exposure in C57BL/6 mice at various doses (i.e., vehicle, 18, 54 and 162 g) collected at several time-points (1, 3 and 28 days) following a single acute instillation (Bourdon et al., 2012a) . We previously characterized widespread changes in gene expression involving acute phase response and inflammation, supported by concomitant influxes of pulmonary bronchoalveolar lavage cells (BAL) and increases in tissue-specific DNA strand breaks (Bourdon et al., 2012a,b) . In addition to the examination of BMDs and BMDLs, we compare CBNP-modified gene expression profiles to various models of lung disease in mice and humans reported in the literature, in order to explore the utility of our data in predicting the potential risk of adverse health outcomes and the human relevance of expression changes. The work demonstrates one approach by which gene expression profiling may be integrated into HHRA to support or predict apical toxicological endpoints, dose-response, and relevance to human diseases.",

Briefly, female C57BL/6 mice were exposed to a single installation of vehicle or Printex 90 (18, 54 or 162 g) and euthanized 1, 3 and 28 days post-exposure (n = 6/group). The intratracheal instillation route of exposure allows for deposition of known doses directly in the lungs of the mice, and controls for potential dermal-and ingestion-related CBNP exposure that can occur during whole body inhalation exposures. The doses were selected to represent 1, 3 and 9 working days of exposure at the occupational inhalation exposure limit of 3.5 mg/m 3 of CB (as established by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH))) for a mouse (assuming 1.8 L/h inhalation rate and 33.8% particle deposition in mouse, for an 8 h working day) (Dybing et al., 1997; Jacobsen et al., 2009) . Very limited filtration of CBNPs from the nose is expected during human exposure. Printex 90 CBNPs were characterized and displayed the following properties: 14 nm primary particle size, 295-338 m 2 /g Brunauer Emmett and Teller (BET) surface area, 74.2 g/g PAHs, 142 EU/g endotoxin, polydispersity index of 1, \u221210.7 mV zeta potential, 2.6 m peak hydrodynamic number and 3.1 m peak volume-size-distribution (Bourdon et al., 2012b) .",

A Hill model was excluded if the \"k\" parameter of the model was less than 1/3 of the lowest positive dose (18 g) (Black et al., 2012) . Other settings included maximum iterations of 250, confidence level of 0.95, benchmark response (BMR) of 1.349 (number of standard deviation defining BMD) .

Data for this analysis encompassed 13 mouse lung disease models, and were obtained from the National Centre for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus (accession #GSE4231 and #GSE11037). The samples were labelled as belonging to one of three models of lung inflammation: bacterial infection, lung injury and fibrosis, or Th2 response (allergic airway inflammation). Probes with common GENBANK accessions were collapsed to a single measurement for each sample using the mean. Using the common accession numbers, a prediction model using shrunken centroids was estimated. Cross-validation of the nearest shrunken centroid classifier was conducted to identify an appropriate threshold. PAMR implements 10-fold cross-validation. This involves dividing the samples into ten approximately equal-size parts ensuring that the classes are distributed proportionally. Ten-fold cross-validation works by fitting a model on 90% of the samples and then predicting the class labels of the remaining 10%. This procedure is repeated ten times, with each part playing the role of the test samples and the errors on all ten parts added together to compute the overall error. A threshold of 2 was selected, yielding a classifier with 753 GENBANK accessions. The means of the nine CBNP treatment conditions were then classified using the estimated prediction model.",

Interestingly, fibrosis was identified as a predicted disease outcome of CBNP exposure that increased considerably with time (e.g., score of 14 on day 1, 35 on day 3 and 45 on day 28). In order to examine the molecular mechanisms that may be involved in fibrosis in more detail, a meta-analysis was completed using curated studies within NextBio that identified fibrosis as a phenotype. Meta-analysis in mouse employed 36 models that included fibrosis-induced by injury with naphthalene, bleomycin and ganciclovir, doxycyclineinduced over-expression, and TGF-\u2424 over-expression in a variety of mouse models (wild type, inflammation resistant/susceptible). Meta-analysis using CBNP gene expression profiles in mouse ranked 473 canonical pathways and 21,277 genes present in at least one of the studies on select models of pulmonary fibrosis and lung injury (identified in NextBio disease correlation profiles). In order to establish human-relevance, the analysis was repeated using human studies curated in NextBio. Meta-analysis encompassed 4 studies from lung biopsies of patients affected with fibrosis, with intermediate to severe pulmonary hypertension, pneumonia and exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Overall, 472 canonical pathways and 15,795 genes were ranked as present in at least one of the studies. The top ranked pathways and genes for the mouse and human meta-analyses are presented in Table 4 . Interestingly, comparison of fold-ranks between the mouse and human analysis revealed that the most affected pathways were the same in both species. However, the genes that were most perturbed during fibrotic responses were considerably different in CBNP-exposed mice compared to human diseases, with the exception of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GDP1), kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) and ceruloplasmin (CP).",

It is hypothesized that toxicogenomic profiling can be used as a screening tool to prioritize the specific assays that should be conducted from the standard battery of tests, thus minimizing animal use, cost and time (Dix et al., 2007) . Moreover, global analyses of transcriptional changes provide a wealth of information that can be used to identify putative modes of action and to query relevance to human adverse health outcomes (Currie, 2012) . This type of approach is the general premise of the widely supported paradigm outlined in 'Toxicity Testing in the 21st Century' (National Academy of Sciences, 2007) . However, substantive work demonstrating the ability of gene expression profiles to identify hazards, to assess risk of exposure via quantitative dose-response analysis, and to identify adverse outcomes associated with specific modes of action is required before these endpoints can be used in HHRA. The present study applies pathway-and network-based approaches, BMD modelling, and disease prediction tools to gene expression data to explore the relationship between apical endpoints and transcriptional profiles. The work investigates the potential utility of gene expression profiling in determining hazard and mode of action of NPs, in characterizing dose-response relationships and in predicting the relevance of these findings to potential disease-outcomes and human health effects for HHRA.",

Toxicogenomic profiles of alachlor exposure in rat olfactory mucosa (Genter et al., 2002) and dimethylarsenic (DMA) exposure in human cultured bladder cells and rat bladder epithelium (Sen et al., 2005 ; US EPA, 2005) have also Table 3 Comparison of CBNP profiles with lung disease models using functional analysis for genes in common (grey) and genes unique to CBNP (black). provided useful information for two final assessments of acetochlor and arsenicals (US EPA, 2004 . Our data demonstrate that gene expression profiles can also be viewed as effective predictors of the biological effects of CBNP exposure. For example, inflammatory responses manifested at the gene expression level and detected using DNA microarrays and classified in this work using KEGG pathway analyses and previously in the same mice using ingenuity pathway analysis (Bourdon et al., 2012a) are entirely consistent with the observed pulmonary influx of inflammatory markers (e.g., neutrophils, eosinophils and lymphocytes). The number of genes perturbed and the magnitude of expression changes in these pathways correlates with dose and time. In addition, observed transcriptomic changes associated with perturbations of cell cycle networks, alterations of non-homologous end-joining, and p53 signalling support the sustained genotoxicity observed in the mice, although dose and time correlations were not as apparent (e.g., levels of DNA strand breaks remained relatively constant at the two highest exposure doses (Bourdon et al., 2012b) whereas induction of DNA repair genes decreased with dose and time). The transcriptomic changes associated with alterations in glutathione metabolism and free radical scavenging correlate with induction of DNA formamidopyrimidine DNA glycoslase (FPG) sensitive sites (an indicator of oxidative DNA damage) early after the exposure. The persistence of this response is an indication of an adaptive response to oxidative stress in the lungs of the mice. Interestingly, CBNP-induced alterations in gene expression profiles also revealed a pulmonary acute phase response and unexpected changes in lipid homeostasis, which were subsequently supported by measured decreases in plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) (Bourdon et al., 2012a) . The strong association between CBNPinduced gene expression profiles and apical endpoints collectively support the use of toxicogenomics for hazard identification of Table 4 Meta-analyses in NextBio using mouse and human profiles in which fibrosis was a phenotype.

            "text": "In addition to identification of hazard, it has been suggested that gene expression profiles may be useful for quantitative assessment (e.g., establishment of reference doses) of responses related to both cancer and non-cancer endpoints . Benchmark doses are generally considered more informative than the no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) in deriving reference doses as they are based on the entire dose-response relationship (Crump et al., 1995) . Because alterations in gene expression can be initiated in the absence of biological effects (e.g., adaptive or stress response pathways effective in mitigating toxic effects), it is expected that reference doses for genomics endpoints may be too sensitive for use in HHRA. However, previous analyses of 5 chemicals (i.e., 1,4-dichlorobenzene, propylene glycol mono-t-butyl ether, 1,2,3-trichloropropane, methylene chloride and naphthalene) showed that median BMD and BMDLs for the most sensitive pathways and GO categories were highly correlated with BMD and BMDLs of cancer and non-cancer endpoints (Thomas et al., 2011 .",

The pathway-based BMDs and BMDLs calculated here for relevant pathways were actually less sensitive (i.e., higher BMDs) than those of the observed apical endpoints. However, the mean of the minimum BMDs and BMDLs across all the pathways that we assigned as relevant to the apical endpoints (i.e., corresponding to the most sensitive genes within the relevant pathways) were similar to those of relevant apical endpoints. Median BMDs and BMDLs for the most sensitive pathways also correlate more closely with apical endpoints even though the pathways were not necessarily relevant to these endpoints. This finding supports previous examples demonstrating a 1:1 correlation between BMDs for gene expression and apical endpoints (Thomas et al., 2011 . These data indicate the potential utility of using gene expression profiles in determining acceptable exposure limits for NPs. In order to determine the specific utility of pathway derived BMDs in HHRA, it will be necessary to establish a comprehensive catalogue of pathways that are actually perturbed in the event of specific adverse effects.",

            "text": "Perhaps the principal motivation for including gene expression profiling in HHRA is the wealth of information that can be used to identify key events that are correlated with adverse outcomes that are relevant to human disease, and moreover can be used to predict the likelihood of a human disease. Identification of key events at the transcriptional level can facilitate the identification of processes that are critical for disease initiation and progression, thus allowing information from animal experiments to be queried and used for extrapolation to human scenarios (Edwards and Preston, 2008) . Comparison of our data with specific models of lung disease, including bacterial infection, airway hypersensitivity and lung injury revealed that CBNPs induced responses that were more closely related to lung injury and fibrosis than to other models. This finding was further supported by comparison of the expression profiles of CBNP exposed mice to those of curated studies of animals and humans exhibiting a myriad of pulmonary disease phenotypes. This analysis demonstrates that CBNP exposure perturbs genes that are known to be involved in tissue injury and fibrosis in mice. Although it is unclear if CBNP exposure would result in the same gene expression profile in humans, similar pathways including many involved in fibrotic responses were found in both mice and humans (52% of the top 50 pathways found were common between mouse and human). Despite concordance of pathways, the top ranked genes differed considerably between both species. However, many of the genes found in mice and humans had similar functions, including inflammatory and acute phase responses (e.g., Saa3, Socs3 and Mt2 in mice and CP, VNN2 and CXCL10 in humans), cell cycle progression (Cdkn1a in mice and KLF4 in humans) and bone and tissue modelling (Mmp14, Timp1, Eln and Ogn in mice and SPP1 in humans). Thus, despite discordance in the gene expression profiles between species, the similar functions of top ranked genes and concordance between pathways supports the likelihood of similar responses in the event of CBNP exposure in humans. In addition, fibrosis has been identified as an outcome of exposure to various particles and NPs in animals (Bermudez et al., 2004; Shvedova et al., 2008) , including Printex 90 (e.g., 28-day nose only inhalation in Wistar WU rats) (Bellmann et al., 2009) , as well as in humans (Lkhasuren et al., 2007; Wang and Christiani, 2003) . The process of pulmonary fibrosis is closely related to progression of carcinogenic outcome (Hubbard et al., 2000) . These data demonstrating very similar fibrotic pathways in mice and humans and a significant overlap with CBNP-induced gene expression changes thus support the use of pathway-based approaches in identifying molecular mechanisms of disease onset and progression, and using gene expression profiles to support HHRA.",

First, transcriptional profiles can effectively predict the biological effects of chemical exposures. Specifically, in the absence of data for any apical endpoints, our data would have suggested that mice exposed to CBNPs exhibit an inflammatory response, oxidative stress, DNA damage and perturbations in cholesterol metabolism. Second, a comparison of BMDs and BMDLs of relevant pathways and apical endpoints confirms that minimum pathway BMDs and BMDLs are in the same range as those of apical endpoints. Third, that expression profiles can be fairly easily mined to identify potential adverse outcomes (i.e., diseases) that are relevant to humans, and might reasonably be expected to occur in humans exposed to substances that elicit specific gene expression patterns in experimental animals. We believe that our work constitutes a significant step towards the ultimate recognition of toxicogenomic endpoints for routine assessment of human health risk.",

Due to the unique properties of NPs, powerful technologies that can assess a multitude of adverse outcome possibilities will be required to elucidate their modes of action and potential impacts on human health within a time-frame that is suitable for prompt regulatory decision making. This same premise should hold true for any new chemical products, for which toxicity is largely or completely unknown. In order to establish a strong foundation for the integration of gene expression profiling into HHRA, it will be necessary for the approach employed here to be applied to a variety of additional chemicals/particles that span a wide range of toxicological potencies and modes of action, and using a variety of experimental designs (e.g., multiple doses and time-points). As our knowledge of molecular pathways, and of the diverse tools used to decipher their biological significance, dose-response characteristics and relevance to human disease continues to grow, we anticipate that toxicogenomics will become increasingly useful in assessing the toxicological hazards of a wide range of test articles, and by extension, for HHRA.",
