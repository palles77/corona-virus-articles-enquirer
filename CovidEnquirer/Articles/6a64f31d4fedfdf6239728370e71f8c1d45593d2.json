Major presenting signs include dullness, inappetence, self-isolation, and recumbency. Hyperlipemia is a frequent finding in donkeys with colic. Triglyceride concentrations should be measured regularly in inappetent animals and treatment instituted. The presence of hyperlipemia reduces the prognosis. It is possible to perform a rectal examination in most donkeys; it is preferable to use spasmolytics before rectal examination. Ultrasound evaluation is useful if rectal examination is not possible and can be an adjunct to those cases whereby rectal examination alone has not been diagnostic. The presence of dental disease and parasitism increases the risk of colic; donkeys and mules should be included in routine preventative dental care and anthelmintic use. Because of their unique physiology, donkeys differ in their response to dehydration and drug metabolism compared with horses. Hematological and biochemical reference ranges are available for donkeys and mules.",

Preventative care (anthelmintic use, dental care, regular vaccination) is often inadequate, in particular, in developing countries. Weight loss may be the only indicator of chronic gastrointestinal disease in donkeys and mules. Because of the large colon enhanced water absorption capacity, diarrhea is rarely seen with acute or chronic gastrointestinal disease, including colitis. Rectal examination should be performed in all, except in miniature animals. Intravenous spasmolytics (hyoscine/scopolamine) at standard equine doses facilitate rectal examination. In unhandled donkeys and mules where rectal examination may be dangerous, heavy sedation and the use of stocks are indicated. Mules may require between one-third to one-half extra dose of sedatives compared with a similarly sized pony or horse. If rectal examination is not possible, information about the nature of the feces and hydration status is useful. Hyperlipemia is frequent in colicky and dull donkeys and can worsen the prognosis, and triglyceride measurement is indicated in these animals. As donkeys evolved in dry and arid environments with limited water access, they can better tolerate dehydration and hemoconcentration than horses. Transabdominal ultrasonography may be challenging in obese animals. Clipping their thick coat is recommended to facilitate image acquisition. Abdominocentesis can be unrewarding in donkeys because of significant fat deposits on the linea alba; a teat cannula or catheter may be indicated, preferably after ultrasound evaluation. A foal-or pony-sized tube can be used for evaluation of gastric reflux and nasogastric therapy. In countries where rabies is endemic, the possibility of infection with this zoonosis must be considered, in particular when performing oral or rectal examination. Donkeys without tetanus prophylaxis are susceptible to this condition and develop signs similar to other equids.",

Epidural injections are best done in the second intercoccygeal space at an angle of 30 to the horizontal, 1 space further back and at a shallower angle than in the horse because of the lack of musculature over the rump and tail head. 4 Correct placement of the epidural injection is relevant to manage conditions such as rectal prolapse, reproductive manipulation, or orthopedic pain.",

In donkeys and mules in arid regions and marginal communities with poor access to preventative care, colic may occur because of inadequate water access, fibrous or indigestible feed provision, poor dentition, foreign object ingestion (eg, plastic bags), or heavy endoparasitism (Fig. 3 ). Parasites such as Strongylus vulgaris have higher prevalence in developing countries because of poor management and minimal access to anthelmintics. Ingestion of moldy feed or excess seasonal lush grass can result in tympanic colic, whereas grazing low in poor grasslands may contribute to sand colic. 7 Donkey studies in the United Kingdom have identified impaction colic as having high morbidity and mortality. 8 The pelvic flexure was the main site of impaction, but mortality was higher for cecal impactions. Colic impaction is also frequent with dental disease and aging. Multiple diastemata, painful periodontal disease, absent molars, and loss of masticatory function increase the incidence of colic. This can be reduced by dietary modifications, including a short chop, high-fiber feed, and provision of regular high-quality dental care. Note that diastemata and periodontal disease are not necessarily confined to geriatric patients, and younger animals should also have regular dental examinations.",

Donkeys with gastric ulcer syndrome (DGUS) do not usually exhibit the clinical signs displayed by horses with equine gastric ulcer syndrome, likely because of their stoic nature. For example, 1 study of 39 donkeys without symptomatic evidence of gastric disease found lesions in the squamous gastric mucosa in 49% of animals, whereas only 2.6% had glandular disease. 10 Postmortem data from The Donkey Sanctuary identified that most chronic gastric ulcers were located in the squamous area adjacent to the margo plicatus, whereas chronic active or acute ulcers affected both the glandular and the squamous part of the stomach in few animals (G. Paraschiou, personal communication, 2018) . These findings are similar to those reported in Italy. 10 Acute gastric ulcers are rarely documented in donkeys, but this may be a reflection of infrequent diagnostics rather than true pathologic condition. Concerns related to stress and risk of hyperlipemia from prolonged fasting for gastroscopic evaluation are valid. However, in 1 study where donkeys were fasted for 15 hours before the procedure, no adverse metabolic effects were noted. 10 It is the authors' opinion that donkeys undergoing gastroscopy should have triglyceride concentrations measured before fasting and after the procedure. If hyperlipidemia is identified, intravenous dextrose or oral administration of glucose or sugar-rich drenches is recommended to prevent clinical hyperlipemia.",

            "text": "Indications for surgery in donkeys are similar to those in horses, with the caveat that their demeanor and physiology may mask deteriorating parameters. Pain level and dehydration are harder to assess in donkeys. Before embarking on exploratory laparotomy, a thorough clinical examination is recommended to ascertain that factors that could compromise a successful outcome (eg, dental disease, malnutrition, laminitis, osteoarthritis) are taken into consideration. Again, routine rectal examination and nasogastric intubation should be performed when feasible. Blood and peritoneal fluid lactate values can be used in a similar way as for horses. Normal blood and peritoneal fluid lactate values for donkeys have not been established; however, rising lactate concentrations suggest the presence of a surgical lesion or the presence of bacteria in the peritoneal fluid.",

            "text": "It is important to mention that for several drugs, there are pharmacologic differences between donkeys and mules with horses, and clinicians should use caution when extrapolating doses (see Francisco J. Mendoza and colleagues' article, \"Clinical Pharmacology in Donkeys and Mules,\" in this issue). 19 It is essential to monitor the response to analgesia given for gastrointestinal pain and be prepared to dose at more frequent intervals. Phenylbutazone and flunixin meglumine can be given twice daily at standard equine doses. 19 Multimodal pain relief using opioids and other drugs should be considered, as for other equines. Further information on sedation and general anesthesia in donkeys is described elsewhere (see Nora Matthews and Johannes P.A.M. van Loon article's, \"Anesthesia, Sedation and Pain Management of Donkeys and Mules,\" in this issue). 20 Abdominal surgery increases the risk of hyperlipemia, and preemptive measures to prevent and manage this complication should be in place. Postoperative food withholding should be weighed against the risk of hyperlipemia and other complications. Triglycerides should be monitored regularly, and parenteral support may be required to maintain normal levels (see Francisco J. Mendoza and colleagues' article, \"Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders in Donkeys,\" in this issue). 21 Postsurgical monitoring is essential to reduce stress. In donkeys that require prolonged stall rest, enrichment methods may be necessary. The following link provides information on enrichment for donkeys (https://www.thedonkeysanctuary.org.uk/ what-we-do/knowledge-and-advice/for-owners/environment-enrichment).",
