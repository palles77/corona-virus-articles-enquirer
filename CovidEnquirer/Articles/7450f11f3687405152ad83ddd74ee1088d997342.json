However, it still remains to be elucidated that mechanisms of the innate immune response in situ after immunization (a.i.). The aim of this study was to investigate the kinetics of cell migration in the skin dogs with distinct antigenic compounds of the LBSap vaccine. Our major findings indicated that saponin adjuvant alone or combined with Leishmania braziliensis antigen induced strong local acute inflammatory reaction. However, these reactions not progressed to ulcerated lesions. Overall, the cell profile found in Sap and LBSap was composed of neutrophils, lymphocytes and eosinophils. There was also increased production of iNOS in Sap and LBSap groups. Thus, we can conclude that dogs immunized by LBSap and the saponin adjuvant elicited a potential innate-immune activations status compatible with effective control of the resistance to infection by Leishmania and contributing to a better understanding of the innate-immunity events induced by the LBSap vaccine.",

Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum), constitutes a serious health problem in various regions of the Mediterranean and the Americas [1] . Since dogs are the most important domestic reservoirs of L. (L.) chagasi [2] within Latin America and Europe, the natural history of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) has been studied extensively with respect to parasite load in different tissues and immunopathological changes relating to the progression of clinical forms [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Whilst such data have proven to be valuable in the development of tools employed in the evaluation of chemotherapies and vaccines against CVL, current treatment strategies have failed to achieve a consistent parasitological cure for the disease owing to the presence of latently infected cells [9, 10] . In this respect, a canine vaccine may represent the most practical and effective method by which to reduce the incidence of human VL, and it could also provide a basis for the development of a similar vaccine for humans [11] [12] [13] .",

            "text": "In the search for a potential vaccine against CVL, various approaches involving the dog model have been employed, and the use of purified fractions from parasite extracts (e.g. fucose mannose ligand [FML] antigen) [14, 15] and from parasite cultures (excreted/secreted antigens) [16, 17] have shown particular promise. Additionally, some remarkable results have been obtained following vaccination of dogs with killed parasite vaccines [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] , thus demonstrating that vaccines prepared from antigenic extracts still remain a reliable proposition in consideration of their cost, safety and broad spectrum of antigenicity. In this context, we have recently demonstrated that killed Leishmania braziliensis, together with saponin (LBSap vaccine; Instituto Nacional da Propriedade Intelectual-patent PI 0601225-6, 17 February 2006), or with saponin and saliva of Lutzomyia longipalpis (LBSapSal vaccine), generates very high levels of immunogenicity in dogs. Vaccinated animals exhibited increased numbers of circulating T-cells (CD5 + , CD4 + and CD8 + ), B-cells (CD21 + ) and L. chagasi-specific CD8 + Tcells [21, 22] , representing the key resistance profile against CVL [6] . Moreover, animals that had received saponin as adjuvant presented only minor local swelling as the major adverse reaction, indicating that in dogs, overall tolerance to the candidate vaccine appears to be adequate [21, 22] . However, further studies are still required to overcome potential problems in this area by searching for additional safety biomarkers associated with the use of saponin as vaccine adjuvant.",

This finding reinforces the assumption that saponin modulates the immune response by stimulating antibody production and non-specific reactions, such as inflammation, and cell traffic [41, 43] . The numbers of cells observed in the hypodermis of Sap and LBSap animals were larger than in the dermis, probably by virtue of the more extensive vascularisation in the former layer. As demonstrated in the present study, the inflammatory infiltrate increased within the Sap and LBSap groups at 12, 24 and 48 h compared with the S and LB groups, and also in the Sap group at 1 and 96 h compared with the S group. Since, throughout the whole experimental period, there was greater cell recruitment within the Sap group than in the LBSap group, the initial assumptions regarding the role of saponin in the transfer of inflammatory cells to the inoculation area are strengthened.",

In the late period following inoculation, there were increases in the numbers of eosinophils in the inner dermis and hypodermis of Sap animals, and in the inner and outer dermis of LBSap animals. Based on these results it is possible to hypothesise that neutrophils function at the front line of the immune system, responding immediately upon request, and direct the migration of other cells to the inoculation area some hours afterwards. It appears, therefore, that neutrophils participate effectively in the adaptive immune response from the very beginning of the process. This assumption is supported by several studies in which the role of neutrophils has been considered [44, 45] . According to Appelberg [44] , neutrophils not only act as phagocytes but also determine the inflammatory immune response and cooperate with other cells in the amplification of such response. Moreover, neutrophils play a role in acquired (or adaptive) immunity since they are antigenpresenting cells (APCs) that can activate na\u00efve T lymphocytes [45] . In this context, neutrophils have been shown to migrate to the infection site before macrophages and dendritic cells, and are the first cells to interact with CD8 + T lymphocytes [44] . Moreover, together with saponin [41] , the neutrophils stimulate the activation of T CD8 + lymphocytes, hence contributing to the entire immunogenic process. Some reports have suggested that neutrophils operate not only in an indirect manner as APCs, but are also instrumental in the recruitment of other cells (i.e. T lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages and immature dendritic cells) through the production of chemokines [46] .",

The co-participation of cells associated with the adaptive response in the activation of the innate response has recently been discussed by Berg and Forman [48] . According to those authors, the migration of CD8 + T lymphocytes represents an additional mechanism since the cells produce IFN-\u2425 via the interaction with IL-12 and IL-18 cytokines, independent of the T-cell receptor-major histocompatability complex (TCR-MHC) mechanism, and destroy infected cells hence controlling the multiplication of the infectious agent and mediating the initial stages of the acquired immune response [48] . The presence of CD4 + T lymphocytes is also important since these cells produce IFN-\u2425 and activate macrophages, thus increasing the microbicide capability and the production of cytokines that take part in the adaptive response and control of Leishmania infection [49] .",

Semi-quantitative analysis demonstrated that iNOS was expressed in the skin layers of all animal groups including those of the control group S.

In contrast, the Sap and LBSap groups showed larger areas of iNOS expression at 12 h onwards in comparison with the other groups. The increased iNOS expression in these groups may be explained by the great number of NO-producing cells recruited to the inoculation area, activation of which would contribute to the eradication of the parasite.
