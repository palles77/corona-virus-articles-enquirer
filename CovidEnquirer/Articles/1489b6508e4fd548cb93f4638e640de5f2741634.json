The isothermal RPA was applied to amplify specific target sequences from the pathogens Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Salmonella enterica and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) using genomic DNA. Additionally, a positive plasmid control was established as an internal control. The four targets were amplified simultaneously in a quadruplex reaction. The amplicon is labeled during on-chip RPA by reverse oligonucleotide primers coupled to a fluorophore. Both amplification and spatially resolved signal generation take place on immobilized forward primers bount to expoxysilanized glass surfaces in a pump-driven hybridization chamber. The combination of microarray technology and sensitive isothermal nucleic acid amplification at 38\u00b0C allows for a multiparameter analysis on a rather small area. The on-chip RPA was characterized in terms of reaction time, sensitivity and inhibitory conditions. A successful enzymatic reaction is completed in <20 min and results in detection limits of 10 colony-forming units for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella enterica and 100 colony-forming units for Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The results show this method to be useful with respect to point-of-care testing and to enable simplified and miniaturized nucleic acid-based diagnostics.",

In addition the reaction runs at a constant low temperature of about 37-39\u00b0C and the PCR-like system with only two primers offers the possibility for multiplex assays. In the literature some RPA amplifications of different DNA [11] [12] [13] and RNA [14] [15] [16] targets have been described. So far, few applications of this method have been integrated in more complex instrumentation as an approach for an improved nucleic acid diagnosis in point of care testing [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] .",

A multiplex RPA reaction was established amplifying different target sequences of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Salmonella enterica, methicilin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and of a plasmid reaction control. Although these three pathogens are not related, they do represent important targets for point-ofcare testing in the field of sexual-transmitted diseases (STD) (Neisseria gonorrhoeae), food borne pathogens (Salmonella enterica) and nosocomial infections (MRSA). The use of specific sequences of these three pathogens as targets for the amplification was not to address a clinical relevant question but rather to demonstrate the strength of this method in a highly parallel DNA analysis. Low-density microarrays have already proven their ability as diagnostic tools [22] [23] [24] and offer the possibility to test for multiple parameters on a small surface area. Additionally they can serve as detection area in microfluidic chips. The principle of oliognucleotide microarrays is the immobilization of short single stranded nucleic acid probes and the subsequent hybridization of target molecules to these probes. In previous work we demonstrated the combination of microarrays and enzymatic reactions directly on the solid surface, using the probes as template for the enzymes and thus reducing the steps for the diagnostic microarray. PCR [25], RT-PCR [26], the transcription of a whole gene [25] and the isothermal OnChip-HDA [27] on solid surfaces have been described. Solid phase amplification can successfully minimize the formation of primer dimers and thus reduce nonspecific products [28] especially during the amplification of multiple targets in parallel where a mixture of different oligonucleotide primers is used.",

Subsequently amplification takes place using a strand-displacement polymerase and single-strand binding proteins (SSB) (Fig. 2a) . The uniform isothermal reaction at a temperature of 37-39\u00b0C and the use of only two primers are advantageous, yet regular PCR primers are unlikely to work in the RPA [30] . For this reason several primer combinations were initially evaluated for each pathogenic target sequence in singleplex reactions and tested for sensitivity and specificity. Each RPA primer pair generated a product that was distinct in size in order to enable the interpretation of amplification results on an agarose gel. The amplification of multiple DNA targets in the same reaction has the advantage to gain more information from one sample and thus reduce time and costs for every diagnosis since no parallel experiments are necessary to be conducted. So far most isothermal nucleic acid amplification techniques are usually limited to amplify only one target sequence. In the RPA two primers are needed for a successful amplification whereas e.g. the LAMP-technique typically uses six primers. Hence a higher multiplexing ability can be assumed for the RPA. Various primer mixtures and concentrations as well as reaction conditions were evaluated and optimized for the multiplex experiments. In Fig. 3 all simplex and the multiplex detection are visualized on an ethidium-bromide stained agarose gel and the specific amplification with RPA can be determined by the size of the product. All RPA reactions were run at 38\u00b0C for 40 min with 250 pg of genomic DNA and subsequently purified with spin columns. In the quadruplex reaction clearly distinguishable bands of the expected product sizes are observable with no specific band in the no template control (NTC). Albeit the brightness of all bands shows almost the same intensity, minor differences are noticeable. Amplification efficiency in a multiplex amplification assay highly depends e.g. on the target sequence, amplicon size or primer characteristics and has to be optimized for every new multiplex approach.",

            "text": "For point-of-care testing devices the use of agarose gel electrophoresis is not feasible. In the particular case of the RPA, crowding agents and proteins in the reaction can interfere in the run of gels. Therefore amplification products have to be cleaned up before use. This additional step can be very time consuming and requires additional equipment. The on-chip RPA reaction has the benefit that no preliminary preparation steps are necessary before detection. In Fig. 2b the process of the on-chip amplification is described. Herein gene-specific forward primers are covalently immobilized on the solid glass-support using microarray spotting technology. The oligonucleotides are modified with an amino group and bind to the epoxy silanized glass slides. The asymmetric RPA reaction takes place in the solution above the surface inside of an automated hybridization chamber (Fig. 3c) . Additionally to the reaction components the solution consists of the Cy5modified reverse primer and, at a tenfold lower concentration, the forward primer. Our observation shows that an amplification under asymmetric primer conditions is conducive to the reaction and enhances the signal significantly. Especially when only low amounts of target DNA are present. For this reason we conclude that two mechanisms play a role in the signal generation in our on-chip RPA experiments. (i) The excess of reverse primer in the reaction and the subsequent polymerase elongation leads to a preferred amplification of a single strand antisense DNA strand which can hybridize to the target specific probe structure on the surface. During the amplification reaction labeled primers are integrated in the amplicon. The product can then be detected spatiallyresolved on the surface. (ii) The immobilized primer can serve as starting point for solid-phase isothermal amplification. A complex is formed between the recombinase and the primer which then can bind to the template DNA and lead to a strand exchange. In the following the polymerase elongates the strand and releases the target DNA which results in an exponential amplification of the DNA molecules. The reverse primer in solution with the fluorophor dye can hybridize to the immobilized strand and also functions as starting point for the polymerase. Both solid-phase and solution-based amplification lead to a signal generation which can be read out (Fig. 3b) . In other solid-phase amplification assays with an improved surface-to-volume ratio, for example in reduced volumes or with three dimensional surface structures, the rates of these two mechanisms might be altered and the solid-phase amplification might be preferred. In the Figures S2a-d where the specific target sequence is located a fluorescence signal can be observed in the laser scanning images. Other spots on the chip with either different target specific probes, non homologous negative controls or spotting controls show no increased signal. The specificity and the successful amplification were also verified using the quantitative data of the signal intensities to calculate an individual limit of detection (LOD) for every experiment. The resulting analysis displays a good correlation to the qualitative data, showing in all assays signal intensities above the LOD for the specific amplification site while the integrated control spots do not exhibit an enhanced signal. Variations in the LOD are due to differences in background intensity on parts of the slides which increase the standard deviation of the background signal. However all signals generated by the on-chip RPA are highly specific and distinguishable from unspecific background noise.",

Albeit the high background noise which increased the LOD in the quantitative analysis, all amplified targets have a signal above the calculated value while in the negative controls almost no signal can be detected. The signal of Salmonella enterica is only narrowly above the LOD which is due to a high signal variance distributed over the biochip. Control experiments with no template show no signal in both qualitative and quantitative analysis ( Figure S1e Electronic Supplementary Material). An improved blocking procedure might decrease the signal variation by preventing unspecific binding to the chip surface. The high total amount of fluorophor-labeled reverse primer in multiplex reaction does also increase the background signal.

The high sensitivity of nucleic acid amplification techniques like the PCR improve the time to result excessively since these methods usually do not require a precultivation of the pathogen. However the PCR still might take hours to be completed when manual prepreparation steps and the analysis procedure are taken into account. In recent years many efforts have been made to improve the speed of the PCR for example with optimized enzymes and highly sophisticated equipment. Yet these instruments are expensive and usually remain laboratory bound. We tested the speed of the on-chip RPA with 1 ng of genomic DNA of Salmonella enterica and stopped the reaction at 0, 5, 10, 20 and 30 min by starting the washing process. The results are pictured in Fig. 5 demonstrating the fast isothermal amplification reaction. Stable signals at Salmonella-specific immobilized primers were observed after 20 min reaction time with no unspecific or cross amplification. Even after 10 min positive signals were obtained but in this experiment the signal was not evenly distributed over the entire slide. Therefore a high difference in signal intensities is measured. The only partial mixing of the reaction components in the reaction chamber could be the reason for this occurrence. Although none of the other amplification reactions were tested in the on-chip RPA, the results from the The analytical sensitivity of a diagnostic device is an essential criterion. In biological or clinical samples only low amounts of target organisms might be present. Nucleic acid amplification techniques can theoretically detect one single target molecule, or if a target with higher copy number is addressed also one pathogenic organism. RPA has been described in literature to be able to amplify around 10 copies of genomic DNA [11] . We tested the sensitivity of the on-chip RPA with a serial dilution of genomic DNA from methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus ranging from 10 6 to 1 colony forming units (CFU). Each reaction was run for 40 min in the hybridization chamber. We observed an increase in signal intensities in the on-chip RPA with 10 copies of genomic DNA ( Figure S2 Electronic Supplementary Material) making it a highly sensitive method for nucleic acid detection. With 100 copies a stable signal well above the calculated LOD is detectable. The amplification of 10 3 copies shows a clearly positive amplification in the qualitative data of the laser scan. However the quantitative analysis of the data leads to signals just above the LOD resulting from a high, but constant, background signals throughout the slide and thus leading to a relatively low LOD but also equivalent small MRSAspecific contrast values in this assay. Again, an optimization of blocking conditions and washing procedure is necessary to avoid possible misinterpretations and to allow a more constant quantification of the results from on-chip RPA experiments. Similar sensitivities of 10 copies (S.enterica and plasmid control) or 100 copies (N. gonorrhoeae) can be achieved with other RPA amplification used in this approach.",

The targeted organisms in this assay are usually obtained from nasal (Staphylococcus aureus), vaginal or cervical (Neisseria gonorrhoeae) swabs, stool, urine, blood or environmental samples (Salmonella enterica). All these samples and necessary extraction methods result in specimens containing substances which may block nucleic acid amplification either by inhibiting enzyme Fig. 1 ).

The on-chip RPA could extend the possibility to detect and analyze nucleic acids in a POC testing device. Without the need for the thermocycling process these devices could be simplified and would not require expensive additional equipment and thus reduce the overall diagnostic costs. Our results show that the on-chip RPA is considerably faster than common PCR techniques. We demonstrated that a time to result in less than 20 min is feasible. At the same time no loss in sensitivity and specificity in comparison with other diagnostic systems can be observed.

The polymerase (blue) elongates the strand leading to duplication. RPA runs continuously at 38\u00b0C. A labeling of the amplification product is achieved by using a reverse primer coupled with a Cy5 reporter dye (red). b Two mechanisms for signal generation duringthe on-chip RPA.

M = Molecular weight marker HyperLadder V (Bioline) primer optimization and evaluation in solution with real-time quantitative detection indicate that the time ranges are similar for all used primer combinations. A stable amplification reaction can be achieved in less than 20 min. Combined with the subsequent washing step of 15 min and the manual set-up work, the on-chip RPA can be performed within 60 min. At present, external sample preparation steps are time consuming and add up to the total reaction time.
