            "text": "damage present during the early phase of infection corresponds to regions where subsequent demyelination occurs during the chronic phase. We hypothesized that axonal damage recruits inflammatory cells to sites of Wallerian degeneration , leading to demyelination. Three weeks after TMEV infection , axonal degeneration was induced in the posterior funiculus of mice by injecting the toxic lectin Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA) I into the sciatic nerve. Neuropathology was examined 1 week after lectin injection. Control mice , infected with TMEV but receiving no RCA I , had inflammatory demyelinating lesions in the anterior/lateral funiculi. Other control mice that received RCA I alone did not develop inflammatory lesions. In contrast, RCA I injection into TMEV-infected mice induced lesions in the posterior funiculus in addition to the anterior/lateral funiculi. We found no differences in lymphoproliferative responses or antibody titers against TMEV among the groups. This suggests that axonal degeneration contributes to the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the central nervous system by altering the local microenvironment. In this scenario , lesions develop from the axon (inside) to the myelin (outside) (Inside-Out model). ( Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). 1 Although its etiology is unknown, epidemiological data and clinical reports support the association of MS with environmental factors, particularly viral infection. In recent years, pathological and neuroimaging studies have re-emphasized the importance of axonal damage in MS. 2 Immunostaining studies have provided direct evidence for axonal damage using antibodies against two markers of injured axons: nonphosphorylated neurofilament protein (NFP) 3 and amyloid precursor protein. 4 Several groups have demonstrated that axonal damage occurred early during the course of MS and that damaged axons were found not only in active demyelinating lesions but also in periplaque white matter without demyelination, 5 remyelinating lesions and normal-appearing white matter. 6, 7 Magnetic resonance spectroscopy analyses have also demonstrated gray matter lesions 8 and axonal injury in normal-appearing white matter in MS patients. 7, 9, 10 Axonal damage in normal-appearing white matter has also been found in an animal model for MS, coronavirus-induced demyelination. 11 Although axonal damage in MS is believed to occur secondarily after the destruction of the myelin sheath or oligodendrocytes, the myelin-forming cells, these findings suggest that axonal damage could be independent of demyelinating activity. 12 Wallerian degeneration is the anterograde degeneration of axons caused by injury to the proximal part of the axon or by death of the neuronal cell body. 13 In most cases, the demonstration of Wallerian degeneration in humans has been limited to compact neuronal tracts, such as the corticospinal tract and optic radiation. In MS, Wallerian degeneration was believed to be rare; this was probably attributable to a difficulty in detection because MS lesions are usually not confined to a single pathway or tract. However, more recently, magnetic resonance imaging, 14 -17 magnetic resonance spectroscopy, 18 and autopsy 19 studies have documented the presence of Wallerian degeneration in some patients with MS.",

Intracerebral infection with TMEV in susceptible mice causes an inflammatory demyelinating disease with virus persistence in macrophages and glial cells \u03f31 month after infection. Demyelination is accompanied by T-cell and macrophage infiltration of the anterior and lateral funiculi of the spinal cord, but the posterior funiculus and the brain are generally spared. [22] [23] [24] In TMEV infection, ultrastructural studies demonstrated that degenerating axons are found in all states of myelinationcompletely demyelinated, remyelinated, or normally myelinated-thus suggesting Wallerian degeneration after axonal transection occurring in lesions located elsewhere in the CNS. 25 Previously, we demonstrated that axonal degeneration precedes inflammatory demyelination, and the distribution of damaged axons observed during the early phase corresponded to regions where subsequent demyelination occurs during the chronic phase. 24 This indicates that axonal degeneration is not a simple consequence of demyelination but rather a potential trigger for recruitment of T cells and macrophages into the CNS leading to subsequent loss of myelin.",

Histological scoring was performed as described previously. 27, 28 For scoring spinal cord sections, each spinal cord section was divided into quadrants: the anterior funiculus, the posterior funiculus, and each lateral funiculus. Any quadrant containing meningitis, perivascular cuffing, or demyelination was given a score of 1 in that pathological class. The total number of positive quadrants for each pathological class was determined, divided by the total number of quadrants present on the slide, and multiplied by 100 to give the percent involvement for each pathological class. An overall pathology score was also determined by assigning a positive score if any pathology was present in the quadrant. This was also presented as percent involvement. Brain sections were scored for meningitis (0, no meningitis; 1, mild cellular infiltrates; 2, moderate cellular infiltrates; and 3, severe cellular infiltrates), perivascular cuffing (0, no cuffing; 1, 1 to 10 lesions; 2, 11 to 20 lesions; 3, 21 to 30 lesions; 4, 31 to 40 lesions; and 5, more than 40 lesions), and demyelination (0, no demyelination; 1, mild demyelination; 2, moderate demyelination; and 3, severe demyelination). Each score from the brain was combined for a maximum score of 11 per mouse.",

By this route, exogenous substances can reach the CNS from the periphery circumventing the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Because RCA I can be transported via axonal flow, injection of RCA I into the sciatic nerve leads to the death of dorsal ganglion cells and subsequent degeneration of the ascending sensory tract that localizes in the posterior funiculus. 36, 37 We injected RCA I into the left sciatic nerve of na\u00efve mice to determine whether it could induce axonal degeneration in the left half of the posterior funiculus, corresponding with the side of the injected sciatic nerve (Figure 1c ). One week after injection, the spinal cord appeared normal and neither demyelination nor inflammation was detected by Luxol fast blue staining (Figure 2c ). Axonal swelling was noted in several nerve fibers by immunohistochemistry against nonphosphorylated NFP (Figure 2a ). No microglial activation or T-cell infiltration was seen by lectin histochemistry or immunohistochemistry against CD3 (Figure 2d ), respectively.

During this early chronic phase of TMEV infection, 4 weeks after infection, mice developed MNC infiltration in the meninges and perivascular spaces with demyelination in the white matter of the spinal cord, but not in the brain. 20 In all three groups of mice, the anterior funiculus and the ventral root exit zone (VREZ) were most severely involved (Figure 3, a and b) . As we reported previously, 23 we found few lesions in the posterior funiculus of control TMEV-infected mice receiving no treatment (Figure 3d ). In contrast, in TMEV-infected mice receiving RCA I, the posterior funiculi were demyelinated in several segments (Figure 3c ). The demyelinating lesions were usually seen only in the left side (ipsilateral to the injection side) of the posterior funiculus ( Figure 3c ). In the demyelinated area, we detected microglia/macrophage and T-cell infiltration (Figure 3 , e and g). Control TMEV-infected mice receiving no treatment had infiltrating cells comprised of macrophages and T cells in the anterior and lateral funiculi, but not in the posterior funiculus (Figure 3, f and h) . Interestingly, we found changes in the posterior funiculus in some segments in the TMEV-infected control group receiving PBS. We tested whether there was a significant increase in spinal cord pathology by comparing spinal cord pathology scores between the groups.",

This was unexpected because we hypothesized that axonal damage alone could contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells in the left posterior funiculus, ipsilateral to the RCA I injection site, without an increase in virus. Thus, we tested whether the number of virus antigen-positive cells in the left posterior funiculus of infected mice receiving RCA I correlated with perivascular cuffing or demyelination. We found that virus persistence did not correlate with perivascular cuffing (r \u03ed 0.59, P \u03ed 0.16) or demyelination (r \u03ed 0.35, P \u03ed 0.44) in the left posterior funiculus of the RCA I-injected group (Figure 6, a and b) . This suggests that there was no association between virus persistence and neuropathology in the left posterior funiculus, which is in accord with our prediction. Thus, virus persistence did not play a major role in induction of neuropathology at the posterior funiculus ipsilateral to the RCA I injection site. The presence of virus antigen-positive cells in this area could be attributable to recruitment of virus-infected macrophages. 39 We next determined whether virus persistence correlated with neuropathology in the other areas of the spinal cord of the RCA I-treated group and control groups. We found significant correlations between virus persistence and perivascular cuffing in some areas (for example, left VREZ in the PBS group; r \u03ed 0.83, P \u03fd 0.05; Figure 6c ), whereas other areas showed no significant correlation (data not shown). In most areas in all three groups, virus persistence strongly correlated with perivascular cuffing versus demyelination. Virus persistence did not correlate with demyelination (eg, left VREZ in the PBS group; r \u03ed 0.62, P \u03ed 0.1; Figure 6d ).",

Spleen MNCs were harvested and incubated without antigen or with UV-irradiated purified DA strain of TMEV (DA Ag), live DA virus, or DA-APCs. Because TMEV-infected mice have been shown to develop autoreactive immune responses in the spleen, 30, 31 MNCs were also stimulated with irradiated uninfected syngeneic spleen cells (n-APC). All MNCs from the three groups of treated mice showed similar lymphoproliferative responses against not only TMEV but also n-APC (autoproliferation) (Figure 7a ). No differences were found among the groups. Lymphoproliferative responses against PLP 139 -151 were low and showed no significant difference among the three groups (stimulation index: no Tx, 2.3 \u03ee 0.6; PBS, 2.2 \u03ee 0.4, RCA I, 2.9 \u03ee 0.8).

            "text": "The primary target in MS is believed to be either myelin itself or the myelin-forming cells, the oligodendrocytes. Although axonal degeneration has been demonstrated in MS and its respective autoimmune model, experimental autoimmune (allergic) encephalomyelitis (EAE), it is regarded as a secondary event to myelin damage. In this scenario, the lesion develops from the myelin (outside) to the axon (inside) (Outside-In model). 12, 26, 41 In this Outside-In model, axonal degeneration can be regarded as a simple end result. On the other hand, in TMEV infection, we previously found that axonal damage precedes the demyelinating disease and that the distribution of damaged axons observed during the early phase corresponded to regions where subsequent demyelination occurs during the chronic phase of disease (Table 1 , pathomechanism 1). 24 Here, lesions develop from the axon (inside) to the myelin (outside) (Inside-Out model). 12, 26 In the present study, we demonstrated that experimentally induced axonal damage contributes to the recruitment of T cells and macrophages to sites of Wallerian degeneration in mice infected intracerebrally with TMEV. Although we found increased numbers of viral antigenpositive cells at the sites, there was no significant correlation between virus persistence with inflammation or demyelination. Our results suggest that, in TMEV infection, axonal damage is not a simple consequence of demyelination but can target inflammatory demyelinating lesions to sites of Wallerian degeneration (Table 1 , pathomechanism 2). Our findings are similar to what has been reported in a rat adoptive-transfer experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, in which axonal damage was induced in rats before encephalitogenic cells were adoptively transferred. 42, 43 In this model, besides the typical EAE lesions randomly distributed in areas known to be common in rat EAE (mainly in the spinal cord), an unusual distribution of inflammatory lesions was seen in the region where Wallerian degeneration was experimentally induced, ie, in the ipsilateral thalamus, which has a dense reciprocal connection to the cryolesioned neocortex, and in the optic tract and the superior colliculus, after optic nerve severing without disruption of the BBB. In some patients with MS, lesion development has been observed along the corticospinal tract in a pattern consistent with Wallerian degeneration. 14 -17 The Inside-Out model and Outside-In model are not mutually exclusive and may act synergistically (Table 1,  pathomechanism 3) . 12, 26, 41 The lesion may develop first from the inside to the outside (eg, neurotropic virus infects and damages neuronal cell bodies and axons, leading to secondary demyelination in the optic tract). However, at the last step, damaged myelin would be phagocytosed by activated macrophages/microglia, followed by myelin antigen presentation in the CNS. This could induce myelin-specific autoimmune responses, which can attack myelin from the outside, and inflammatory demyelination would lead to axonal damage secondarily. In this instance, pathology develops from the outside to the inside. Here, severe axonal damage leads to Wallerian degeneration of the distal stump of axons and trigger the second cascade reaction. Therefore, Inside-Out and Outside-In models can form a vicious cycle, independent of whichever event starts first. This might be the reason why some patients with MS develop progressive disease, in which axonal degeneration is a prominent feature. 44 We propose that, regardless of the cause of demyelination (autoimmune or viral induced) or axonal damage (traumatic or toxin induced), Wallerian degeneration contributes to the dissemination of demyelinating lesions and/or initiates/triggers demyelination.",

            "text": "However, we do not believe that axonal degeneration alone results in recruitment of inflammatory cells to sites of Wallerian degeneration. As we will discuss in detail below, we did not see recruitment of T cells and macrophages to sites of axonal damage in uninfected mice injected with RCA I or RCA I-injected mice infected intravenously with TMEV. Similarly, in spinal cord injury in humans and in animal models, although axonal degeneration leads to secondary demyelination, no T cells are present in the lesions. 12 Thus, there are multiple mecha-nisms for the evolution of lesion development. In some instances, axonal damage can lead to initiation or spread of demyelinating lesions, whereas in others, primary demyelination results in axonal damage without further lesion development. In MS, Werring and colleagues 17 suggested that in some lesions there is a pathological process occurring before detectable BBB breakdown, whereas in other lesions, opening or alteration of the BBB is the earliest event. These authors demonstrated, in a serial diffusion magnetic resonance imaging study using MS patients, that there was an increase in the average apparent diffusion coefficient before the onset of gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) enhancement, indicating that structural changes in normal-appearing white matter occur before inflammation and BBB breakdown. 17 We found no inflammation or activation of microglia in the posterior funiculus in uninfected mice injected with RCA I. This is compatible with the findings in a spinal cord injury model in mice. 45 In this model, mice received systemic injection of lipopolysaccharide or PBS after spinal cord hemisection. The mice treated with lipopolysaccharide, but not with PBS, had large numbers of activated microglia/macrophages and degeneration of myelin in the ascending sensory tract of the mouse posterior funiculus after a dorsal hemisection. Thus, Wallerian degeneration alone is not sufficient to induce inflammatory demyelinating lesions. Activation of immune cells is a prerequisite for induction of demyelinating lesions in the CNS.",

RCA I injection in mice with intravenous infection of TMEV was not sufficient for induction of the lesions in the posterior funiculus of the spinal cord. Differences in the extent of anti-viral immune responses between intracerebral versus intravenous infection may not explain a lack of CNS lesions in mice infected intravenously with TMEV. Intravenous injection of TMEV has been shown to induce active humoral and cellular immune responses against virus, 30 but TMEV does not efficiently infect the CNS by this route and dose. Indeed, in our current experiments, we found similar levels of anti-TMEV antibody titers between intracerebral versus intravenous TMEV-infected groups (data not shown). *Although axonal degeneration is detrimental in pathomechanisms 1 to 3, axonal degeneration can inhibit spread of neurotropic virus or toxin that is transferred via axonal flow in the central nervous system. 12, 26, 41 Thus, axonal degeneration can be beneficial for hosts in some instances.",

            "text": "Thus, recruitment of inflammatory cells seems to require additional parameters, such as virus persistence in the CNS, up-regulation of adhesion molecules on lymphocytes and/or CNS endothelial cells, or CNS virus replication and axonal degeneration, both of which are seen during the acute phase of intracerebral infection of TMEV. 24 Interestingly, among mice infected with TMEV by the intracerebral route, we found some targeting of inflammatory demyelinating lesions in PBS-injected mice, although the extent of disease was milder than that in mice with RCA I injection. This suggests that changes in the CNS microenvironment may be induced by stimulation and/or minor injury to the PNS, and such stimuli can cause similar effects to the changes induced by axonal degeneration. Axonal degeneration in the CNS can activate microglia and astrocytes and can induce a variety of molecules including major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II and cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-\u2423. 42, 46 Peripheral nerve manipulation, such as peripheral nerve inflammation and transection, has also been shown to induce microglia and astrocyte activation with proinflammatory cytokine expression, including interleukin (IL)-1\u2424, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u2423 in the CNS. 47-50 IL-1\u2424, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u2423 can cause changes in BBB permeability. 51 Peripheral stimuli, such as inflammatory pain, has also been reported to increase BBB permeability. 51, 52 In these models, however, neither T-cell infiltration nor demyelination in the CNS was observed during peripheral nerve inflammation. 36 In the RCA I and PBS injections, we used Fast Green FCF to help visualize the injected fluid. Fast Green FCF has been used in physiological studies because of its inertness. Although Fast Green FCF has been documented to inhibit synaptic activity, 53 various applications of the dye include staining of proteins and identification of intracerebral injection sites. 54 Neither neurotoxicity nor alterations in axonal transport of Fast Green FCF have been reported. In addition, we found that TMEV-infected mice injected with RCA I or PBS in the absence of Fast Green FCF developed similar pathology to TMEV-infected mice injected with RCA I or PBS in the presence of Fast Green FCF (data not shown). Thus, it is unlikely that Fast Green FCF itself plays a major role in recruitment of cells or inflammation.",

In the posterior funiculus, however, substantial numbers of viral antigen-positive cells were seen only in infected mice injected with RCA I (Figure 5a), whereas a few viral antigen-positive cells were detected in infected mice receiving PBS or infected mice without treatment (Figure 5b). In infected mice receiving RCA I, viral antigen-positive cells were usually seen only in the left half of the posterior funiculus, ipsilateral to the injection side.We also quantified the numbers of viral antigen-positive cells in the CNS. During the chronic phase of TMEV infection, only a few viral antigen-positive cells were seen despite the presence of severe inflammatory demyelinating lesions. In all groups of mice, we found a small number of viral antigen-positive cells per spinal cord segment. There were no significant differences in the total numbers of viral antigen-positive cells among the groups (mean number of viral antigen-positive cells per spinal cord segment \u03ee SEM: no Tx, 3.7 \u03ee 1.2; PBS, 2.4 \u03ee 0.7; RCA I, 3.9 \u03ee 1.2; P \u03fe 0.05, analysis of variance). In all groups, we detected viral antigen-positive cells mostly in the anterior funiculus and VREZ(Figure 4b). In the posterior funiculus, few viral antigen-positive cells were detected in the no injection group or PBS-injected group (no statistical difference between the two groups, P \u03fe 0.05). In infected mice receiving RCA I, we found an increase in the number of viral antigen-positive cells in the injected side (left side) of the posterior funiculus; the number was statistically higher than that of the no injection group and the PBS-injected group (P \u03fd 0.01, analysis of variance). In the posterior funiculus of the RCA I-injected group, the number of viral antigen-positive cells in the injection side (left) were higher than that of the noninjection side (right), although the numbers did not show a statistical difference (right, 0.04 \u03ee 0.04; left, 0.22 \u03ee 0.06; P \u03ed 0.07).

The left side of the spinal cord was labeled by India ink (double arrows). Inflammatory demyelination was seen in the left half of the posterior funiculus, the ipsilateral side of the RCA I injection, but not in the right half (R). b and d: TMEV infection alone induced inflammatory demyelinating lesions in the anterior funiculus and the VREZ (arrow), but not in the posterior funiculus. In the posterior funiculus, macrophage (e and f) and T-cell (g and h) infiltration was seen in RCA I-treated mice (e and g), but not in control mice injected with TMEV alone (f and h). a-d: Luxol fast blue stain. e and f: Lectin histochemistry. g and h: Immunohistochemistry against CD3.
