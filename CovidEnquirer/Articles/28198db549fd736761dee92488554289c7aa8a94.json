There is now evidence that probably all organisms in the biological world may be infected by at least one virus. Indeed it has been estimated that viruses represent the most abundant biological entities on the planet, existing as pathogens or silent passengers in humans and other animals, plants, invertebrates, protozoa, fungi, and bacteria. To date more than 4000 different viruses and 30,000 different strains and subtypes have been recognized, with particular strains and subtypes often having significant public health importance. Several hundred different viruses are known to cause disease in humans, although this is a small fraction of those viruses encountered in the surrounding environment. Since all viruses, whatever the host, share the properties described in the preceding chapter, virologists have developed a single system of classification and nomenclature that covers all viruses-this is a system overseen by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). One challenge of virus classification is to define evolutionary relationships between viruses when minor changes in molecular structures may give rise to pathogens with radically different properties ( Fig. 2.1 ).",

The earliest efforts to classify viruses were based upon host organism species, common clinical and pathological properties, tropism for particular tissues and organs, and common ecological and transmission characteristics. For example, viruses that cause hepatitis (e.g., hepatitis A virus, family Picornaviridae; hepatitis B virus, family Hepadnaviridae; hepatitis C virus, family Flaviviridae; and Rift Valley fever virus, family Bunyaviridae) might have been brought together as \"the hepatitis viruses.\" Such systems have now been superseded.",

            "text": "One of the landmarks in the history of infectious diseases was the development of the Henle-Koch postulates that established the evidence required to prove a causal relationship between a particular infectious agent and a particular disease. These simple postulates were originally drawn up for bacteria, but were revised in 1937 by Thomas Rivers and again in 1982 by Alfred Evans in attempts to accommodate the special problem of proving disease causation by viruses. In many cases, virologists have had to rely on indirect causal evidence, with associations based on epidemiology and patterns of antibody prevalence among populations. The framework of virus taxonomy, again, plays a role, especially in trying to distinguish an etiological, rather than coincidental or opportunistic relationship between a virus and a given disease. Particular difficulty arises where a disease occurs in only a small fraction of infected individuals, where the same apparent disease can be caused by more than one different agent, and in various chronic diseases and certain cancers. These difficulties are confounded in many instances where diseases cannot be reproduced by inoculation of experimental animals, or where the discovered viruses cannot be grown in animals or cell culture: there may even be a \"hit and run\" relationship where the causative virus may no longer be present in the afflicted individual. Thus scientists have to evaluate the probability of \"guilt by association,\" a difficult procedure that relies heavily on epidemiological observations. The Henle-Koch postulates were reworked again in 1996 by David Relman and David Fredricks as more and more genomic sequencing criteria came to dominate the subject (Table 2. 2). As a test of the value of these criteria, one can consider the level of proof that the human immunodeficiency viruses, HIV-1 and HIV-2, are the etiological agents of human acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) ( Table  2 .3). Early in the investigation of AIDS, before its etiology was established, many kinds of viruses were isolated from patients and many candidate etiological agents and other theories were advanced. Prediction that the etiological agent would turn out to be a member of the family Retroviridae was based upon years of research on animal retroviral diseases and many points of similarity with some characteristics of AIDS. Later, after human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) was discovered, the morphological similarity of this virus to equine infectious anemia virus, a prototypic member of the genus Lentivirus, family Retroviridae, highlighted the usefulness of the universal viral taxonomic system and of animal lentiviruses as models for AIDS.",

            "text": "The breath-taking advances in genome sequencing now enable the complete genomes of many hundreds of virus isolates to be sequenced in a matter of days, if not hours. Multiple sequence alignment and the construction of phylogenetic trees are now commonplace when virologists are confronted with either a potentially new virus or an isolate with new or unexpected properties. These data are rapidly challenging previous ideas about the origin and evolution of many viruses of medical importance. Detailed phylogenetic analysis of RNA viruses in particular sometimes provides unexpected answers that in turn create more questions; for example, hepadnaviruses share a similar reverse transcriptase-based replication strategy that is common to the caulimoviruses of plants-does this reflect a common ancestor or convergent evolution?",

Sequence analyses also suggest that it is unlikely that many more associations of diverse taxa will be found that warrant construction of further Orders.",

Similarly, some member viruses of the family Bunyaviridae have been found to be natural reassortants with genes from known and unknown ancestors.",

Strength of the association. Infection with HIV is found in almost all cases that fit a clinical definition of AIDS. 2. Specificity of the association. Human immunodeficiency viruses are found preferentially in target organs (immune cells, lymphoid tissues). HIV infection is not found in healthy individuals, except for those who subsequently develop AIDS or those rare individuals considered longterm non-progressors. 3. Response to treatment. Combination therapy against HIV lowers or completely eradicates circulating virus, resulting in increased CD4 cells, improved immune function, and significant long-lasting clinical improvement. 4. Temporality. HIV infection precedes and predicts disease onset in children born to infected mothers, in medical personnel infected via needle-stick accidents, and in recipients of blood transfusions from infected persons. 5. Plausibility. HIV infects and kills CD4+ T cells and macrophages. SIV causes AIDS in experimentally inoculated macaques. 6. Biological gradient. HIV-1 RNA load is highest in lymphoid tissues and brain (diseased tissues). HIV-1 RNA load predicts the rate of disease progression. 7. Consistency. These findings are consistently reproducible, worldwide. children, and that a malignant lymphoma can be induced in certain primates with EB virus or EB virusinfected lymphocytes (see Chapter 9: Mechanisms of Viral Oncogenesis and Chapter 17: Herpesviruses). Using a similar approach, Palmer Beasley and coworkers in Taiwan demonstrated unequivocally that persistent hepatitis B infection increased the subsequent risk of primary liver cancer, but not other cancers, by approximately 100-fold.",
