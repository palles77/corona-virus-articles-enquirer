The abundance on the virion and the major stimulus for the virus-neutralizing antibodies makes gD a predominant candidate for cure of HSV infection. In this study, we generated a monoclonal antibody (mAb), termed m27f, targeting to glycoprotein D (gD) of HSV-2, which also has cross-reactivity against HSV-1 gD. It has a high level of neutralizing activity against both HSV-1 and HSV-2, and binds to a highly conserved region (residues 292-297) within the pro-fusion domain of gD. It can effectively block HSV cell-to-cell spread in vitro. The pre-or post-attachment neutralization assay and syncytium formation inhibition assay revealed that m27f neutralizes HSV at the post-binding stage. Moreover, therapeutic administration of m27f completely prevented infection-related mortality of mice challenged with a lethal dose of HSV-2. Our newly identified epitope for the neutralizing antibody would facilitate studies of gD-based HSV entry or vaccine design, and m27f itself demonstrated a high potential for adaptation as a protective or therapeutic drug against HSV.",

There are two serotypes of HSV, HSV-1 and HSV-2, also known as human herpesvirus 1 and 2 (HHV-1 and HHV-2). The most common clinical sign of HSV-1 is herpes labialis, as well as ocular diseases, including conjunctivitis and keratitis (Everett, 2014) . HSV-2 is the main cause of recurrent genital herpes, which is one of the most predominant sexually transmitted diseases, and HSV-2 infection of newborns during delivery is usually accompanied by a high mortality rate (Cleary et al., 2005; Domeika et al., 2010; Overall, 1994) . Moreover, epidemiological and biological studies have revealed that HSV-2 dramatically increases the risk of HIV infection (Barnabas and Celum, 2012; Freeman et al., 2006; Sartori et al., 2011) and may also act in conjunction with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection to increase the risk of invasive cervical carcinoma (Smith et al., 2002; Zhao et al., 2012) . According to World Health Organization (WHO) statistics, in 2012, there were 417 million people aged 15-49 years living with HSV-2 infection worldwide (Looker et al., 2015) , and the newly infected population is estimated to be 23 million per year (Looker et al., 2008) . Therefore, the development of vaccines and novel therapeutic strategies against HSV has become very urgent.",

Among these viral glycoproteins, gD acts as the receptor-binding glycoprotein, and gH, gL and gB are required for membrane fusion execution. The gD ectodomain is organized into two structurally and functionally differentiated regions. The N terminus (residues 1-260) carries the receptor binding sites, and the C terminus functions as the pro-fusion domain (residues 260-310), which is required for triggering virus-cell fusion. In nature, the C terminus of the gD ectodomain binds to its N-terminal region and masks the receptor-binding site, resulting in a closed conformation (Cocchi et al., 2004; Fusco et al., 2005) . After binding to a cell surface receptor, either HVEM or nectin-1, gD undergoes conformational changes to adopt an open conformation, which is a key step in activating the core fusion machinery of gH/gL and gB. gD is the most abundantly expressed glycoprotein on the virion, and it induces both humoral and cellular immunity and is the major stimulus of virus-neutralizing antibodies together with gB (Bender et al., 2007; Eisenberg et al., 2012; Fotouhi et al., 2008; Nicola et al., 1998; Whitbeck et al., 1999) . Therefore, gD has been the predominant candidate for HSV vaccine or novel therapeutic strategies (Awasthi and Friedman, 2014; Shin and Iwasaki, 2013) .",

Not all neutralizing mAbs can prevent cell-to-cell spread of herpesviruses (Co et al., 1991; Hooks et al., 1976) . Therefore, blocking of cell-to-cell spread is considered to be an important aspect in evaluating the in vivo protective efficiency of neutralizing antibodies. We herein analyzed the ability of m27f to inhibit cell-to-cell spread of HSV-1 and HSV-2 in vitro. Confluent BHK cell monolayers were initially incubated with either HSV-1 or HSV-2 at an MOI of 0.01 pfu per cell. To prevent viral spread through viral particles moving across the cell culture supernatant (cellfree spread), BHK cell monolayers were treated with an excess of m27f or 21C11, and treatment with mouse IgG or culture medium alone was performed as controls. After 48 h p.i., the transmission of virus was detected by immunostaining with mouse polyclonal antibody against gD. As shown in Fig. 4A , m27f completely inhibited cell-to-cell spread of both HSV-1 and HSV-2, as evidenced by observing the limited fluorescence caused by virus infection. In contrast, neither 21C11 nor mouse IgG could sufficiently inhibit transmission of HSV-1 or HSV-2, and extensive virus spread on BHK cell monolayer was observed by immunostaining. When the infected cells were quantified, the results clearly showed that m27f is able to inhibit cell-to-cell transmission in HSV-infected cells (Fig. 4B) .",

In PBS-treated group, intravaginal infection of HSV-2 (1 \u00d7 10 6 pfu/20 \u03bcl) of six-weeks-old female BALB/c mice resulted in rapid progressive disease (Fig. 7A ) and steady decrease of body weight from day 4 post infection (Fig. 7B) , with a median survival time of 10 days (Fig. 7C) .

For both vaccine design and novel therapeutic strategies, it is important to study epitopes on gD that stimulate virus-neutralizing antibodies. According to the properties of a panel of mAbs to gD and gD mutants, which were used to define the relationship between gD structure and function, anti-gD mAbs have been previously arranged into groups that recognize distinct discontinuous native and continuous denatured epitopes. Most mAbs that recognize discontinuous native epitopes have virus-neutralizing activity. For example, MC23 (which recognizes residues 213 and 216), DL11 (which recognizes residues 132 and 140), MC5 (which recognizes residues 75-79) and MC2 (which recognizes residue 246) have been reported previously to be neutralizing mAbs that recognize discontinuous conformational epitopes. Lazear et al., 2012; Muggeridge et al., 1990; Nicola et al., Fig. 6 . m27f inhibits syncytium formation of HSV-1 and HSV-2. (A) Vero cells were infected with HSV-1 or HSV-2 at an MOI of 5 pfu per cell and then incubated in DMEM containing 2% FBS in the presence of antibodies, m27f (500 \u03bcg/ml) and 21C11 (500 \u03bcg/ml). Mouse IgG (500 \u03bcg/ml), or medium alone were used as control. After 48 h, cells were fixed and then stained with HE staining. The inhibition of syncytium formation was observed by light microscopy. Bar represents 100 \u03bcm. The experiments were repeated at least twice. (B) Syncytium formation of Vero cells with different treatment as shown in panel A was quantified by counting the number of nuclei in syncytia of randomly chosen area. The percentage inhibition was determined relative to no antibody treatment group. Only syncytia containing 3 or more nuclei were analyzed.

There are also a number of reported mAbs that recognize continuous denatured epitopes of HSV gD. Among these mAbs, most have no or low virus-neutralizing ability, except for the mAb 1D3 (which recognizes residues 10 to 20), which can neutralize viral infectivity by blocking gD-receptor interaction (Cairns et al., 2014) . In this study, we found a novel mAb, m27f, to be another virusneutralizing mAb whose epitope is located within a continuous antigenic determinant.",

For example, antibodies targeting both stalk (S2) and globular (S1) subunits of the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus were able to abolish the binding between S protein and its cellular receptors. MAbs neutralize HIV by inhibiting the binding of gp120 to the CD4 receptor (Wibmer et al., 2015; Zeng et al., 2006) . The above-mentioned neutralizing mAbs MC23 and DL11 neutralize virus by blocking binding of gD to both receptors, HVEM and nectin-1. In addition, there are many reports of mAbs blocking virus entry at the post-receptor-binding step. For instance, neutralizing mAbs specific for the C-terminal domain of the murine leukemia virus (MuLV) surface (SU) envelope protein subunit interfere with a post-attachment event necessary for membrane fusion (Burkhart et al., 2003) . MAb 44D11 against the F 2 subunit of the Helicoverpa armigera nucleopolyhedrovirus F protein neutralizes virus entry by inhibiting membrane fusion (Zou et al., 2016) . Our data from pre-attachment and post-attachment neutralization assays indicated that m27f does not interfere with the virus binding process; instead, it might neutralize HSV entry at the post-binding stage (Fig. 5) . By observing HSV-induced membrane fusion following treatment with m27f, we determined that m27f could almost completely inhibit syncytium formation (Fig. 6) , which further confirms that m27f could inhibit the membrane fusion event rather than the virus binding process. Consistent with current findings, earlier studies (Cocchi et al., 2004; Fusco et al., 2005) established that the profusion domain (residues 260-310) is required for viral infectivity and fusion but not for receptor binding and the substitutions of some Pro residues in PFD (amino acids 288, 289, 291, and 292) affected steps in entry and fusion. However, the detailed mechanism of how m27f inhibits the HSV fusion process needs further study.",

Furthermore, intravaginally administered murine anti-gB mAb post HSV-1 infection conferred full protection in an immunodeficient non-obese diabetic (NOD)/severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse model (Krawczyk et al., 2011) . These results encourage further potency of neutralizing mAbs for clinical therapy against severe HSV diseases.",
