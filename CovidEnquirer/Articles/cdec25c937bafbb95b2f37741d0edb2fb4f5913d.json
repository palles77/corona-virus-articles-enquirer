A newly made grandmamma, we are told, was recently awakened by the bell at midnight, and told by her inexperienced daughter, \"Baby has the croup. What shall I do with it?\" Grandmamma replied she would call the family doctor, and would be there in a minute. Grandmamma woke the doctor, and told him the terrible news. He in turn asked to be put in telephone communication with the anxious mamma. \"Lift the child to the telephone, and let me hear it cough,\" he commands. The child is lifted, and it coughs. \"That's not the croup,\" he declares, and declines to leave his house on such small matters. He advises grandmamma also to stay in bed; and, all anxiety quieted, the trio settle down happy for the night.138",

The larynx is a complex structure composed of interacting elements of cartilage and muscle. Functions include phonation, air passage, and protection of the airway. The trachea is composed of a single complete cartilaginous ring (cricoid) and multiple incomplete rings along with loose connective tissue. The conducting portion of the airway undergoes multiple generations of arborization from trachea to terminal bronchioles, including primary (or main stem), lobar, segmental, and subsegmental bronchi and several generations of bronchioles. The remainder of the airway, or respiratory portion, includes additional divisions from respiratory bronchioles to alveoli. Variation in arborization secondary to asymmetric, dichotomous branching can result in a threefold difference in airway generations between basal and apical ~e g m e n t s . *~, '~~ The epithelium lining the airway changes from stratified squamous to ciliated epithelium around the base of the epiglottis. Stratified squamous epithelium covers most of the epiglottis and vocal cords. Ciliated epithelium continues from the base of the epiglottis to the respiratory bronchioles. Mucous production is achieved by goblet cells and submucosal glands that are interspersed among the columnar cells. The movement of the cilia propels mucus and particulate matter (including dust and bacteria) toward the opening of the oropharynx. On descent into the respiratory tract, the amount of cartilage decreases, whereas the proportion of smooth muscle increases. The absence of cartilage and submucosal glands differentiates bronchioles from bronchi.29",

Larger particles (> 10 pm) can be deposited by turbulence in the nasal passage, whereas smaller particles can be deposited further down on the mucous layer of the ciliated infraglottic airway.22 In addition to holding onto deposited particles, the mucous blanket provides a barrier for the epithelial lining of the airway against alterations in temperature and humidity. Cilia serve to propel mucus and trapped particles toward the oropharynx. Cough can result from the stimulation of irritant receptors located throughout the upper (URI) and lower respiratory tract. Cough is an important adjunct in clearing particles from the airway.z2 Finally, cellular and humoral immunity are involved in respiratory tract defense. Immune cells (e.g., macrophages) circulate along the mucociliary blanket. These cells can remove small particles by phagocytosis, whereas immunoglobulins (especially IgA) can provide additional protection from infectious agents.",

It must be understood, however, that these divisions often may appear arbitrary and indistinct when applied in the clinical setting. Anatomic classification may not take into account the spread of inflammation and infection among adjacent elements of the respiratory tract (i.e., does laryngitis exist separately from tracheitis, tracheitis from bronchitis, bronchitis from bronchiolitis, or bronchiolitis from pneumonitis or pneumonia?). It is often difficult clinically to predict the extent of involvement in the respiratory tract. Likewise, classification into a specific microbiologic category may be difficult to accomplish by history and clinical examination alone. Multiple infectious agents can result in similar signs and symptoms, whereas a single agent can cause a spectrum of illness.

The reasons behind this shift are unknown, although improved viral culture techniques and a reduction in the actual incidence of bacterial infraglottic infections (possibly caused by changes in organism virulence, host factors, antibiotic usage, and immunization) may be responsible.

Their records revealed 951 instances of croup out of 6165 cases of lower respiratory tract infection (15.4%) reported during that 11-year period. The incidence of croup varied with age, with no cases reported in the first month of life followed by an increasing incidence during the first 2 years of life. The peak incidence was 5.60 per 100 children per year in boys and 3.66 per 100 children per year in girls during the 1-year-old to 2-year-old age group. After 2 years of age, the rate decreased and cases were uncommon in school-aged children. More than 80% of cases occurred in the age group of children younger than 5 years. Gender differences were noted in all age groups, with an overall ratio of boys to girls of 1.43:l.

The acute LTB observed in the first half of this century was a bacterial infection (diphtheritic and nondiphtheritic) associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Once antibiotics were available (initially sulfa-based and subsequently penicillins), they soon became an essential part of the therapy for these life-threatening infection^.^^^,^^^ Various factors already discussed have resulted in the appreciation for the changing microbiology of croup. The croup commonly encountered by physicians today is predominantly a viral infection. The continued administration of antibiotics in children with croup is common, however, despite this realization and admonitions to limit their use.113 Physicians may feel obliged to consider antibiotics because of concerns over preventing or treating bacterial infection or superinfection.

There was no increase in morbidity reported from the children's hospital where antibiotic usage was lowest.

Comparison of current rates with figures from the beginning of this century are confounded by the different clinical entities described by the croup syndrome (epiglottitis, bacterial tracheitis, and viral laryngotracheobronchitis). In addition, many new therapies introduced during this century (e.g., immunizations, racemic epinephrine, corticosteroids, diphtheria antitoxin, antibiotics, and intubation techniques) also have influenced the outcomes of the croup syndrome. From relatively recent epidemiologic studies, only a small percent of patients with viral croup will require hospitalization, although reports range from 1 .26%38,39 and 19% in outpatient populations.\" Other reviews of croup have reported a hospitalization rate of less than 5%.33 Of the hospitalized patients, it has been estimated that less than 10% of hospitalized patients will require services in an ICU and less than 1% will require i n t u b a t i~n .~.~~ A recent report of croup cases at a single hospital during a 7-year period ending in December 1992 showed a decrease in patients admitted to the ICU and a decrease in intubations, despite an increase in emergency department visits and total hospital admissions for croup.12z Corticosteroid and nebulized epinephrine use had increased at the study center during this time period. An increase in intubation rates reported by some authors may reflect an increased incidence of \"bacterial croup\" seen at certain The mortality rate in patients hospitalized with croup previously has been reported at 1 Yo .I18 Summary Viral croup is a common clinical diagnosis characterized by hoarse cry, barky cough, and stridor. Additional laboratory tests usually are not required to assist in diagnosis or treatment of typical cases. Primary care physicians are faced with the challenge of selecting appropriate therapies for patients. These decisions are made more difficult by the increasing number of available therapies and the controversies surrounding most therapies for viral croup. Humidification has significant anecdotal support and probably little risk if tolerated well by the patient. Dexamethasone as a single dose of 0.6 mg/kg administered parenterally has been supported by clinical research. Likewise, racemic epinephrine can reduce symptoms acutely but with a risk of rebound 2 hours later. Combinations and modifications of these therapies, including dosage and route of corticosteroids, and use of L-epinephrine in the place of racemic epinephrine will probably continue to generate interest. The use of these therapies in the outpatient clinic requires physicians to focus on optimal patient selection, extended observation periods, and the need for close follow-up. It is left to the individual physician to select the appropriate therapy based on an understanding of the scientific literature as well as personal experience and expertise. In addition to disease severity, the importance of other patient factors such as the proximity to medical care, access to car and telephone, compliance, and the observation skills of the family cannot be underestimated. The potential risks and benefits of each intervention need to be considered on a case by case basis.

Before the availability of diphtheria antitoxin and antibiotics, laryngeal diphtheria was synonymous with croup. 159 Baum' O is credited with one of the earliest descriptions of acute (nondiphtheritic) LTB,159 which was published in J A M in 1928. The disease he described almost 70 years ago included cases that are similar to more modern descriptions of bacterial tracheitis. In his report of severe disease (24 cases requiring airway management; 10 deaths), \"gluelike\" secretions were noted in the tracheobronchial airway. Streptococcus was isolated in 10 of the cases. Authorities who were familiar with diphtheritic and nondiphtheritic LTB reported similarities in clinical manifestations between the two conditions?l The character of the tracheal exudate differed, however, with diphtheria producing a more fibrinous exudate compared with the more inflammatory product of LTB. Before the advent of antibiotics, the mortality rate of nondiphtheritic LTB was 50% to 70%,62,91 which was significantly higher than the 25% mortality associated with laryngeal diphtheria.6z Bacterial LTB seems to be a disease that appeared, disappeared, and reappeared during this century. The appearance of bacterial LTB early this century was accompanied by debate whether this condition was newly described or had existed previously along with diphtheritic infections. Despite its seriousness, there was little mention of bacterial LTB in textbooks of the time. 62 An increasing number of reports (mostly in the otolaryngologic literature) were published from the 1940s and 1950s. In the second half of this century, reports of bacterial LTB disappeared from the pediatric41 and otolaryngologic l i t e r a t~r e .~~,~~~ A link between its disappearance and the use of antibiotics in \"inflammatory pediatric airway diseases\" has been suggested.45 Fifty years later, this same debate was renewed as reports of bacterial infection of the upper airway of children reemerged. Currently, there is general agreement that bacterial tracheitis and membranous or pseudomembranous LTB all represent a single clinical entity that was redescribed in 1979.",

In comparing reports that used endoscopic/pathologic versus microbiologic nomenclature, the principal difference was the isolation rate of bacterial organisms.

All the studies emphasized the importance of airway management in bacterial tracheitis. Intubation and tracheostomy were necessary in the majority of patients.

Early symptoms mimic viral croup; however, its subsequent course is typically more severe and suggestive of epiglottitis. Respiratory symptoms generally are not amenable to the conventional therapies for viral croup (including humidification and racemic epinephrine). Close monitoring of the airway is the principal therapy, and intubation or tracheotomy usually has been required to prevent obstruction by purulent exudate in the trachea. Antibiotic therapy is directed toward the likely pathogens. Because of the overlap in symptoms with viral croup, physicians need to consider bacterial tracheitis in the differential diagnosis of children with stridor.

As a part of the contiguous structures making up the respiratory kact, there is no reason to believe that the bronchi should be immune to infection or inflammation. Unfortunately, the step from histopathologic definition to clinical definition is not an easy one. As with the term croup, bronchitis probably encompasses many separate clinical entities. Unlike croup, bronchitis lacks the characteristic clinical features to separate it from inflammatory conditions involving other parts of the respiratory tract. In addition, the clinical manifestations are usually not severe enough to warrant additional diagnostic studies or confirmatory testing (eg., bronchoscopy) in the majority of patients. All these factors have resulted in the inability to create simple, effective clinical definitions. These factors, along with a possible misuse or overuse of the term by physicians and families, have resulted in acute bronchitis becoming a poorly understood diagnosis.",

Because of this, early epidemiologic r e p~r t~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~ on bronchitis may have included episodes of acute asthma. Several epidemiologic surveys in the United States and United Kingdom have investigated the changing frequency of asthma and bronchitis diagnoses. Rates of both diagnoses increased during an 11-year period (1976-1987) reviewed by the Royal College of General Practitioners and the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre of the Public Health Laboratory Service.6 Based on the simultaneous increases, the authors suggest that the rise in asthma rates in recent years is real and not the result of changes in diagnostic labeling. In contrast, hospitalization discharge rates from 1979 to 1987 collected from the National Hospital Discharge Survey72 showed an increase in asthma admissions and a decrease in bronchitis admissions. There has been speculation that recent increases in asthma incidence are the result of more willingness on the part of health care workers to diagnose asthma in children. It has been suggested that primary care physicians may use the diagnosis of bronchitis as a way to avoid labeling a child with asthma. 154 Infection, especially viral, and airway hyperreactivity may play central roles in producing the similar clinical manifestations in all these condition^.^^,^^ Episodes of acute bronchitis in children are primarily viral infections (see following discussion). In addition, viral infections may be responsible for initiating episodes of chronic and recurrent bronchitis. Similarly, there has been increasing interest in documenting the role of viruses in exacerbations of asthma. A recent study94 in school-aged children used sophisticated viral detection techniques (e.g., polymerase chain reaction, immunofluorescence, and serology) to determine how often respiratory viral infections accompanied exacerbations of asthma. Of the 108 children who completed the longitudinal study, \"common cold viruses\" (e.g., rhinovirus and coronavirus) were detected in 80% to 85% of asthma exacerbations. It is possible that chronic and recurrent bronchitis are manifestations of the spectrum of childhood a~t h m a .

This same study also included four admissions for epiglottitis during the same period. During a 3-year period at Children's Hospital of Winnipeg, there were 332 admissions to the hospital for \"obstructive upper airway infection,\" including 28 cases of epiglottitis admitted to the ICU.

Another report126 using culture and serology techniques documented influenza B or parainfluenza 2 infection in each of eight children with bacterial tracheitis. Donnelly et al4I identified virus by culture in five of eight cases (parainfluenza l-[2], parainfluenza 2-[2], influenza B-[1]) of bacterial tracheitis. Clusters of cases of bacterial tracheitis have been reported in association with community outbreaks of parainfluenza and measles. Liston et a P 7 recovered parainfluenza type 1 in six of seven viral throat cultures from cases of bacterial tracheitis that occurred during a 2-month-long community epidemic of parainfluenza. Similarly, Conley et aP5 reported nine patients with concurrent measles and bacterial tracheitis (measles-associated bacterial tracheitis) that occurred during an epidemic of measles between August 1989 and April 1990.In contrast to these studies, Sofer et alls1 failed to identify any viral agents by culture or serologic assay in all five attempts.",
