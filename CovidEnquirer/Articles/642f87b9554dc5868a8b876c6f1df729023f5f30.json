In this study, a near full-length genome sequence of a virus named RS3X (formerly classified as bovine rhinovirus type 1), isolated from infected cattle from the UK in the 1960s, was obtained and analyzed. Compared to other closely related Aphthoviruses, major differences were detected in the leader protease (L pro ), P1, 2B, and 3A proteins. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that RS3X was a member of the species bovine rhinitis A virus (BRAV). Using different codon-based and branch-site selection models for Aphthoviruses, including BRAV RS3X and foot-and-mouth disease virus, we observed no clear evidence for genomic regions undergoing positive selection. However, within each of the BRV species, multiple sites under positive selection were detected. The results also suggest that the probability (determined by Recombination Detection Program) for recombination events between BRVs and other Aphthoviruses, including foot-and-mouth disease virus was not significant. In contrast, within BRVs, the probability of recombination increases. The data reported here provide genetic information to assist in the identification of diagnostic signatures and research tools for BRAV.",

Environmental stress, compromised host immunity, and virus infection predispose the animal to bacterial lung infection (broncho-pneumonia). 1 Primary virus infections damage the respiratory tract and subdue the host immune system. The respiratory tract commensal bacteria cause opportunistic secondary infections and lung pneumonia under immunecompromised conditions (caused by viral infection and other factors). In fact, previous studies have reported bovine viral diarrhea virus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine herpesvirus 1, parainfluenza 3 virus, adenovirus, and bovine coronavirus from cattle with BRD. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Although more than 40 years ago, studies concluded that bovine rhinitis viruses (BRVs) (then known as bovine rhinoviruses) cause mild respiratory disease in cattle, [7] [8] [9] [10] it is a surprise that BRVs are sparsely studied. This is partly due to the fact that the virus grows poorly in cell culture and is known to cause only selflimiting mild respiratory illness.",

Presently, the following sequences of BRV isolates are available in GenBank: BRAV (140032-1, KP236129; SD-1, KP236128; H-1, JN936206; and BSRI4, KP264974) and BRBV (EC 11, EU236594; 140032-2, KP236130; BSRI1, KP264980; BSRI2, KP264976-KP264979; and BSRI3, KP264975). 7, 8, 13 In the new era of deep sequencing, metagenomic profiling of biological samples has yielded a greater diversity of pathogens than was previously detectable. For example, recently, Ng et al. 7 , using metagenomic approach, detected bovine influenza virus, bovine adeno-associated virus, bovine parvovirus, picobirnavirus, and multiple strains of BRAV and BRBV along with earlier reported viruses from BRD cattle samples. In another independent study, Hause et al. 8 showed that BRAV and BRBV commonly circulate in BRD cattle. These findings raise a concern that similar to other BRDassociated viruses, primary infection with BRVs could facilitate bacterial infection. Alternatively, BRVs may themselves cause BRD in some cases.",

The reason for the strict laboratory guidelines for handling FMDV stems from the fact that it is the etiological agent of an economically devastating disease and is one of the most infectious animal viruses known. Like BRV and other Aphthoviruses, of which FMDV is the prototypic member, FMDV is a +ssRNA virus with a large open reading frame (ORF) flanked by two highly structured 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs). As with other Aphthoviruses, the FMDV ORF encodes a polyprotein that is subsequently proteolytically cleaved into a series of intermediate and mature proteins, and often this ORF is subdivided into three regions namely P1, P2, and P3. Just upstream of the P1 region exists the coding sequence for the L pro , which is preceded by two different AUG start codons that results in two different isoforms of the enzyme (Lab and Lb). The P1 region encodes four structural proteins: VP4 (1A), VP2 (1B), VP3 (1C), and VP1 (1D), while P2 and P3 encode nine nonstructural proteins: 2A pro , 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B 1 , 3B 2 , 3B 3 , 3C protease (3C pro ), and 3D RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (3D pol ).",

As such, L pro is considered as a significant virulence factor. In an effort to produce a useful vaccine platform, \"leader less\" FMDV constructs were characterized, showing considerable attenuation relative to parental virus. In a separate study, the L pro of FMDV was functionally exchanged with BRBV L pro to develop an FMDV-BRBV chimera vaccine. 16 This vaccine showed promise in controlling FMDV infection under controlled experimental conditions. However, we speculated that the observed similarity between FMDV and BRV has another face to reckon with. Organisms containing similar (homologous) sequences may undergo recombination. In fact, multiple in-depth examinations of publicly available Picornavirus sequences have revealed evidence of significant recombination events among the +ssRNA genomes of Picornaviridae members. [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] A large percentage of the published in silico experiments were conducted using viruses belonging to Enterovirus, Aphthovirus, and Teschovirus genera, which are the most highly represented in the public sequence databases. Recombination events and potential \"recombination breakpoint hotspots\" 17 in the FMDV genome are reportedly confined to regions encoding the non-structural proteins and sequences flanking the genes for the capsid proteins. 17, 18 The delineated patterns are reportedly mirrored among other Picornavirus genera. 18, 20, 21 Nucleotide segments encoding structural proteins appear to be largely free of recombination events, and such \"recombination immunity\" has been hypothesized to be the result of selection against potentially deleterious effects to genetic fitness. Indeed, the 1A-1D structural genes of Aphthoviruses are flanked by \"recombination breakpoint hotspots\" at the leader-1A and 1D-2A junctions.",

Therefore, we sought to address the probability of recombination between the FMDV and BRV genomes and, in particular, BRAV RS3X. To this end, we performed several in silico comparisons of the nucleotide sequences of each virus. First, we examined the full genomic sequences of BRAV RS3X (also known as BRV type 1), FMDV A 24 Cruzeiro, BRBV EC 11, and ERAV; and then different BRVs in each of the two species. Subsequently, we performed recombination analyses with software packages recombination detection program (RDP) version 4.65.

The structural protein VP4, the first encoded protein from the P1 region, shows the highest conservation among Aphthoviruses as well as BRVs. However, BRVs encode a longer VP4 protein than other Aphthoviruses. The N-terminus of VP2 is remarkably conserved among all Aphthoviruses. The rest of the VP2 protein and the entire VP3 and VP1 of BRVs and ERAV are distinctively different from that of FMDV. Additionally, the characteristic RGD tripeptide, which serves as the cell surface-binding site in the VP1 G-H loop of FMDV, [46] [47] [48] is lacking in all other Aphthoviruses, suggesting an alternative mechanism of their interaction/attachment to the cell surface (Figs. 1A and B). Considering the absence of the RGD tripeptide in BRAV RS3X VP1, structural models of FMDV A 24 Cruzeiro and BRAV RS3X were prepared and compared. Structural models of the two proteins when superimposed on each other show that the G-H loop region is completely disordered in the BRAV RS3X VP1 molecule, which reinforces the speculation that a different virusreceptor interaction occurs on the cell surface (Fig. 2Bi) .",

However, when we built a homology model of BRBV RS3X 2B using hepatitis C virus (HCV) p7 viroporin (PDB: 2MTS), the viroporin domain appeared to be conserved in BRAV RS3X and was very similar to HCV p7. In fact, the pore lining histidine residue is only present in BRAV RS3X, and FMDV 2B lacks the pore lining \u03b1-helix altogether, suggesting a different mechanism for FMDV 2B interaction with intracellular membranes (Fig. 2Bi) .",

Unlike FMDV, BRAV RS3X and all other Aphthoviruses encode only one copy of the nonstructural protein 3B that closely resembles the third non-identical copy of FMDV 3B (3B 3 ). Importantly, the tyrosine residue at position 3, a target for uridylation and a substrate for virus genome replication, is conserved in this single copy gene. 55 Finally, as expected, both the 3C pro and 3D pol (highlighted in yellow color) are most conserved and catalyti cally important residues of the two proteins (highlighted in yellow color) are absolutely conserved in all the viruses compared herein. 56, 57 Phylogeny. We constructed neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees of the structural protein region P1 as well as non-structural protein 3D pol , the former being most diverse and latter being most conserved. The BRAV RS3X sequence reported in this study and all of the classified Picornaviruses (54 species in 31 genera, as shown in Fig. 3 ) were utilized to illustrate the evolutionary space of BRAV RS3X in Picornaviridae. 11 The amino acid sequences of the P1 and 3D pol regions were first aligned with the Muscle algorithm implemented in MEGA 6, and later were manually curated to ensure the accuracy of the alignment. Finally, a phylogeny tree was constructed as specified in the Materials and methods section. The resulting P1 phylogenetic trees (Fig. 3A) show clear divergence between the BRAVs separated by distinct nodes. The RS3X strain and isolate BSRI4 cluster together, while isolate SD1 forms another distinct node, and isolate H1 and strain 140032-1 form a third distinct cluster. Other Aphthoviruses including FMDV strain A 24 Cruzeiro, BRBV, and ERAV each form separate nodes characteristic of their genera. However, as would be expected, all of the Aphthoviruses group together, thus proving their close evolutionary relationship within the genus Aphthovirus.",

Therefore, we first analyzed the selection pressure between Aphthoviruses that are the closest relatives to BRAV by including the BRAV RS3X strain, Bioinformatics and Biology insights 2015:9(s2) Table 1 show that the SLAC method did not detect any codon site subject to positive selection between these viruses.

The IFEL method that computes site-wise selection only on the internal branches of the phylogeny tree detected 14 sites subject to positive evolutionary selection, with ten sites in the 3D pol region and four in the structural protein P1 region. Together, these data suggest that the 3D pol region has the higher prevalence of evolutionary selection. SLAC and FEL methods detected 363 and 425 sites under negative evolutionary pressure, whereas IFEL unexpectedly found only 3 sites under negative selection. It appears that the selection pressure detected by IFEL, by virtue of working on the internal branches of the phylogeny tree, detects mostly the selection events within species and hence BRAV RS3X and BRBV, being more closely related, would yield such unexpected results.",

In its default mode, RDP calculates even the least possible event. However, a recombination event should only be considered significant if it is evidenced by multiple methods. In this study, we considered an event to be significant only when evidence was provided by four or more methods. In this way, we could take into account the results produced by four out of nine methods employed. Such a strategy has been applied to interpret the recombination events detected using RDP. 58 Table 3 shows the results from an analysis of BRAV RS3X and three other viruses: FMDV A 24 Cruzeiro, BRBV, and ERAV. Due to several breaks produced in the ORF due to inclusion of both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTR, these regions were excluded from the alignment and only single ORFs from the L pro to 3D pol regions of these viruses were aligned and included for recombination detection. RDP that recognizes even the remotest possible event, recognized six potential recombination hot spots in the ORF of these viruses, and BRAV RS3X was involved in five of them. However, none of these were confirmed by more than four methods set up as cut-off, and hence we concluded that the possibility of inter-species recombination between different Aphthoviruses analyzed herein is negligible. We then analyzed different BRVs for potential recombination events using RDP. As shown in within species, BRVs carry multiple recombination hot spots distributed throughout the ORF. No less than six of these were reproducible by multiple methods highlighting that these points are real recombination break points.",

As one would expect, the BRAV RS3X sequence exhibits conserved features of the BRAV species. Major differences between the prototypic Aphthovirus FMDV and BRAV RS3X were observed in the architecture of capsid and nonstructural proteins 2B and 3A. Only the capsid protein VP1 of FMDV displays a cellular integrin-binding arginine-glycineaspertate (RGD) tri-peptide motif in its G-H loop. [46] [47] [48] The remaining three Aphthoviruses (BRAV, BRBV, and ERAV) lack this essential cellular receptor-binding site as revealed by structural modeling and analysis of sequence alignment, suggesting a different mechanism of cell attachment for these viruses. In fact, the ERAV crystal structure revealed that it binds the cell surface via sialic acid. 59 The 2B viroporin of BRAV RS3X is significantly smaller than FMDV, and lack of a C-terminal trans-membrane helix of the former indicates a diversion in its topology or function from FMDV. Surprisingly, the mode led structure of the 2B protein from FMDV and BRBV suggest that the latter preserves the membrane pore-lining histidine residue, whereas FMDV 2B lacks this characteristic feature of a viroporin molecule. 60 Conservation of active sites and other functionally critical residues in L pro , 2A pro , 3C pro , 3D pol , and membrane anchorage residue in the 3A protein of BRAV RS3X when compared with Aphthoviruses (FMDV, BRBV, and ERAV) and within BRV species reinforces the functional retention of the molecular biology of Aphtho viruses in BRAV RS3X.",

Isolates H-1 and 140032-1 form a distinct cluster which has been serologically classified as a second serotype, BRAV-2 (formerly known as bovine rhinovirus type 3). Potential recombination breakpoints in the genomes were detected with sites identified flanking the P1 region containing the structural protein-coding sequences and others further downstream in a region containing the nonstructural protein-coding sequences. The evaluation of potential recombination breakpoints was performed using distinct sets of algorithms dependent upon which software package was employed. The similarity in results obtained using both algorithmic sets strengthens the final conclusion that recombination events are unlikely between the FMDV and BRV genomes within the regions encoding the structural proteins. Based on examination of the recombination analysis data of Aphthoviruses and BRVs, we conclude that the inter-species recombination events involving FMDV, BRAV, BRBV, and ERAV do not seem likely. However, within each of the two BRV species, the occurrence of multiple recombination breakpoints confirms an underlying phenomenon of homologous recombination-mediated generation of diversity in Picornaviridae. [61] [62] [63] Despite being the earliest discovered animal virus, there is no report of FMDV recombining with any other virus. On the other hand, there is a significant probability for intra-species recombination within each of the two BRV species. In fact, multiple studies have shown intra-species recombination in the prototypic Aphtho virus FMDV. 58, [64] [65] [66] [67] Selection pressure analysis is a significant methodology for depicting a common lineage for rapidly evolving organisms, and has been employed extensively in inferring the evolutionary information of viral populations. 32, 58, [68] [69] [70] [71] Given that multiple analytical methods were employed in this study, there is a high degree of confidence added to the interpretation that positive selection is not operating between BRV and other Aphthoviruses. The observed higher number of positive selection breakpoints among BRVs is not a surprise and reinforces their common ancestry. As expected, negligible evidence of single-point positive selection sites proves a parallel but distinct lineage of the different Aphthoviruses included in this study.",
