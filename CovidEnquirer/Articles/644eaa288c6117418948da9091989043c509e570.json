Immunoblot analysis of fetal extracts demonstrated that the CVB3 receptor proteins were first expressed at day 14 of the fetal stage, and that maximal expression of the cellular receptor occurred at near term or newborn stage. Results also suggested that newborn mouse brain tissue expressed much larger quantities of viral receptor proteins, compared to other tissues. In vitro studies showed that both mouse neurons and astrocytes could be infected by two CVB3 strains, pantropic CVB3 Nancy strain (CVB3N) and myocardiotropic CVB3 Woodruff strain (CVB3W). CVB3N, however, replicated and grew to high titer in primary astrocyte cultures and in primary neuron cultures, whereas, primary astrocyte cultures were relatively resistant to CVB3W. Virus binding assays revealed that CVB3N bound faster and in greater amounts to mouse brain cells than CVBW. These two virus strains, however, were found to share the same receptor specificity by virus competition assays. The number of virus binding sites for CVB3 on newborn mouse brain cells was approximately 1.8 x 104 per cell. The data suggested that preferential expression of the cellular receptors on newborn mouse brain cells may be related to their high susceptibilities to CVB3 infection.",

One likely mechanism is the diminution in the cellular receptors with age, since much evidence suggested that cellular receptors are major determinants of viral pathogenesis Crowell et al., 1986) . It was found, for example, that virus binding activity of brain cells is the greatest in newborn or suckling mice and this activity diminishes with time. This observation correlated with a dramatic reduction in susceptibility of the CNS to CVB3 infection over the first 8 weeks of age (Kunin, 1962; Grodums and Dempster, 1961) . In vitro studies also have shown that a rat skeletal L8 cell line was susceptible to CVB3 only when it was differentiated (fusion ready) (Schultz and Crowell, 1983) . These data have suggested that the molecular basis of the age and tissue specific susceptibility may be related to expression of the cellular receptor proteins for CVB3.",

Interestingly, antibodies made against purified individual receptor proteins (anti-p46, p36 and p33) specifically recognized the four receptor proteins and blocked the binding of CVB3 to the murine cells. These antisera, which were absorbed with mouse L cells, did not react with any human, rat and other mouse cellular proteins. It appeared that all four receptor proteins were structurally related since these individual antibodies recognized all four receptor proteins. P46 was shown to be a sialic acid linked glycoprotein, but there was no evidence that low molecular weight forms of the receptor proteins were proteolytic products or deglycosylated forms of P46 and p44. The exact relationships among these four receptor proteins are still unknown. Although the receptor for CVB3RD has been identified as decaying accelerating factor (DAF) on human cells (Bergelson et al., 1995) , the nature of the cellular receptor for other CVB3 strain (CVB3N and CVB3W) remains unclear. Whether the unique heart tropism of CVB3W reflects use of a receptor specificity different from that for CVB3N is unknown.",

Crowell / Virus Research 46 (1996) nize each of the mouse receptor proteins on Western blots. Anti-p46 antibody worked better on Western blots under reducing conditions than nonreducing conditions, whereas, anti-p36 antibody only strongly recognized the mouse receptor proteins under nonreducing conditions (Xu et al., 1995) . Therefore, anti-p46 and anti-p36 were used separately for detecting the mouse receptor proteins under reducing and nonreducing conditions, respectively. It was found that anti-p46 and anti-p36 detected these cellular proteins in fetal mice only after they had reached day 14 of gestation, under both reducing and nonreducing conditions, respectively (Fig. 1) . The molecular size of the receptor proteins during the cellular development seemed not to change, however, two receptor protein bands with low molecular weight (p36 and p33) did not appear until day 20 of the fetus (see result under nonreducing conditions). Expression of the cellular proteins increased as development of the fetus advanced. The maximal expression of the cellular protein seemed to be at near term or the newborn stage. The data suggest that maximal expression of the receptor proteins at the newborn stage might be a major factor which contributes to the high susceptibility of neonatal mice to infection by CVB3.",

To examine for the tissue distribution of cellular receptor proteins, different tissues were taken from the newborn mice and separately solubilized by a strong detergent, Triton X-100 (TX-100) (final concentration of TX- 100 1%) to maximize tissue solubilizing efficiency, especially for heart .and skeletal muscle. The same amounts of the solubilized proteins from the different tissues were analyzed under nonreducing conditions by virus-blot using 3SS-labeled CVB3N ( Fig. 2A) and by immunoblot using anti-p36 (Fig.   2B ). Fig. 2 shows the distribution of the cellular receptor proteins for CVB3 among the different tissues. The brain expressed the largest quantity of each of four bands of CVB3 receptor proteins, whereas, heart and kidney expressed only two of them, p36 and p33. A small amount of receptor proteins (p46 or p43) also was seen on lung and skeletal muscles. Liver appeared to have the same profile of expression of the receptor proteins as that of brain, although the quantity was much less.",

The next experiment was performed to determine whether the expression of the receptor proteins for CVB3 in the brain would decrease or increase with mouse age. Mice at different ages were sacrificed and their brains assayed for receptor content as above. The results shown in Fig. 3 revealed that the maximal expression of the receptor proteins was found in newborns, although there was little difference between the expression of receptor proteins between newborns and 7 day old animals. However, the cellular receptor proteins for CVB3 were dramatically decreased as mice became older than 7 days. When mice were over 30 days old, the receptor proteins were almost undetectable, which directly correlated with earlier findings that older mice were less AGE (DAYS) Fig. 3 . Comparison of the expression of the brain receptor proteins for CVB3 in Balb/c mice at different ages. The processing of the brain extracts and detection of receptor proteins by antibodies (anti-p46 and anti-p36) were the same as in Fig. 1. It is likely that different cell types in the mouse CNS contribute to the different susceptibility of brain to CVB3 infection. Among the heterogeneous brain cells, the majority of cell populations are neurons and astrocytes which also are the most important functional cell types (Dreyfus and Black, 1990; Kimelberg and Norenberg, 1989) . However, it is difficult technically to separate astrocytes and neurons directly from total brain cells. One alternative to solving this problem was to differentiate them by culturing brain cells in vitro (Dreyfus and Black, 1990) .",

Furthermore, CVB3W yields were significantly lower (1000-fold) in primary astrocytes than CVB3N, despite the higher initial input amount of CVB3W (Fig, 5A) . These tindings were not due to the insusceptibility of astrocytes to CVB3W because after prolonged incubation (72 h), astrocyte cultures were totally destroyed.

However, there was no information regarding the onset of virus susceptibility of the mouse, in utero. Therefore, the expression of CVB receptor proteins during fetal development 2, 5 was studied by immunoblots using anti-mouse receptor antibodies (Xu et al., 1995) , since the development of cellular receptors is prerequisite to the development of cell susceptibility to infection . The results showed that the earliest detectable expression of the CVB3 cellular proteins was at day 14 of gestation, with amounts increasing until birth of the mouse, at which time maximal expression was observed. These findings coincided with the high level of susceptibility of the newborn mouse to CVB infection. In addition, newborn babies also are considered to be in danger from CVB infection (Woodruff, 1980; Iwasaki et al., 1985; Pavesi et al., 1992) .",

            "text": "Infection of newborn mice with the CVB results in a wide range of tissue damage, especially in the CNS (Grodums and Dempster, 1961 shown that the CNS becomes infected prior to heart tissue of the newborn mouse, which could be a reflection of cellular receptor development (Grun et al., 1988) . Consequently, we examined multiple tissues for the expression of CVB receptors from newborn mice. Immunoblot analysis of receptor proteins in detergent extracts of different tissues revealed that these proteins were expressed in a wide array of tissues, which coincided with the known wide tissue tropism of the CVB. It was found that the newborn mouse brain and liver had significantly more receptor proteins, than the other tissues examined. In addition, it was found that heart tissue expressed only p33 and/or p36, whereas, lung and kidney expressed p46 and/or p43. Since these receptor proteins of different size are antigenically related (Xu et al., 1995) , the significance of finding different sized receptor proteins remains unknown (Koike et al., 1990) and must await the successful cloning of the receptor gene for resolution. The notable neurotropism of CVB3 in newborn mice, in contrast to the relatively resistant adult mice, correlated with the relatively high amounts of CVB receptor proteins in the newborn mouse brain. The results of' our studies extended those of Kunin and Halmagyi (1961) in two ways: (1) four separate receptor proteins were monitored by immunoblot assays with receptor specific antibodies, and (2) detergent extracts of tissues were more sensitive to receptor assay (Krah and Crowell, 1982) than minced brain tissues. The net result, however, was to confirm that the amount of receptor proteins correlated directly with the reduced susceptibility of mice to CVB infection as the mouse ages (Kunin and Halmagyi, 1961) .",

            "text": "The results of cur study also identified two major cell types from the newborn mouse brain (neurons and astrocytes), which were major targets for infection by both virus variants (CVB3N and CVB3W) of CVB3 that were tested. Cultures of neurons and astrocytes, prepared from newborn or near term mice, were demonstrated to be susceptible to infection. The cell types were identified by protein specific monoclonal antibodies and virus replication was determined by virus specific antibodies in IFT. Even though the astrocytes were more susceptible to CVB3N and this virus attached more rapidly, than CVB3W, it was shown by virus competition assays that both viruses had the same receptor specificity. Thus, differing rates of virus attachment should not be taken as evidence that there are more receptors for the more rapidly binding virus . Although CVB3W was less efficient to block binding of CVB3N and CVB3W to the receptors, blocking was accomplished by allowing more time for CVB3W to interact with receptors (data not shown). Low binding affinity of CVB3W compared with CVB3N may reflect differing mutations in VP1, VP2, VP3 regions of the CVB3W capsid. The data suggested that mutations in VP1, VP2 and VP3 regions of CVB3W only had minimal effect on the viral tropism. In a mouse model, CVB3W produces extensive myocarditis, whereas, CVB3N does not. However, whether the capsid proteins of the two CVB3 variants account for their different types of pathogene,fis in mice is unknown. Further studies to identify the differences between the pathogenesis of these virus variants are needed, although the differences in neurovirulence between vaccine strains and wild type polioviruses have been found to be encoded in a conserved domain in the central part of the 5'-nontranslated region of the viral genome (Almond, 1987) . A similar finding has recently been shown for the cardiovirulence of myocardiotropic CVB3 strains (Chapman et al., 1995) . Further studies of the role of the capsid structure of virus variants by construction of chimeric viruses (Colonno et al., 1988; Lindberg et al., 1992) are needed to relate structure-function relationships between specific receptors and viral pathogenesis.",
