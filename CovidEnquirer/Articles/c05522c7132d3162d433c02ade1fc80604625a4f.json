Here , we show that anti-JHM antibodies , in the absence of T or B cells , caused demyelination in JHM-infected mice. Anti-JHM antibody was detected adjacent to areas of demyelination, consistent with a direct interaction between antibody and infected cells. Demyelination was reduced by 85 to 90% in infected RAG1 \u060a/\u060a mice lacking normal expression of activating Fc receptors (FcR\u2425 \u060a/\u060a ) and by \u03f376% when complement was depleted by treatment with cobra venom factor. These data demonstrate that JHM-specific antibodies are sufficient to cause demyelination and that myelin destruction in the presence of anti-virus antibodies results from a combination of complement-and Fc receptor-dependent mechanisms.

            "text": "The human disease multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immunemediated, chronic inflammatory disease manifested clinically by neurological deficits and histologically by multiple foci of demyelination. T cells are detected in active demyelinating lesions and a critical role for these cells in demyelination has been clearly demonstrated in several animal models of demyelination, including rodents with experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) and mice infected with coronaviruses or Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus. [1] [2] [3] Mice infected with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHM) develop acute and chronic demyelinating diseases. We and others 4 -6 have shown that demyelination was not detected in JHM-infected mice lacking T and B cells [either mice with severe combined immunodeficiency or mice lacking functional recombination activating enzyme 1 (RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea )]. However, adoptive transfer of syngeneic splenocytes from JHM-immune mice resulted in rapid and reproducible demyelination. 6, 7 Depletion of T cells abrogated demyelination showing that T cells were necessary and B or other splenic cells were not sufficient for demyelination to occur. Either CD8 or CD4 T cells, in the absence of the other subset, were able to mediate demyelination in this model. 4 In these experiments, T cells were transferred into RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea mice 4 days after they were immunized with JHM. The innate immune system was activated by JHM infection before Tcell transfer, as shown by up-regulated expression of several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-\u2423, MIP-2, CCL7 (MCP-3), CCL4 (MIP-1\u2424), CCL2 (MCP-1), CXCR10 (IP-10), and CCL5 (RANTES) in the central nervous system (CNS). 8 This intense inflammatory milieu is likely critical for the rapid recruitment and activation of T cells to the CNS after adoptive transfer.",

            "text": "Less is known about the role of humoral immune factors in MS, but several features suggest that B cells or antibodies are involved in myelin destruction. 9 Oligoclonal expansion of B cells is observed in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with MS. Also, high levels of immunoglobulin are detected in the cerebrospinal fluid. 10 Some of these cerebrospinal fluid-derived antibodies are directed against myelin proteins and pathogens such as Epstein-Barr virus 11 and varicella-zoster virus. 12 In addi-tion, circulating antibodies against myelin proteins are detected in patients with MS 13, 14 and are a marker for the subsequent development of MS in patients with single episodes of a first neurological event. 15 Furthermore, depositions of IgG and complement have been detected at sites of active demyelination in these patients. 16 Multiple studies using rodent models of EAE also indicate that antibodies may have an important role in the demyelinating process. In mice, rats, and marmosets, treatment with antibody directed against an epitope of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein resulted in the rapid onset of demyelination. 17 Antibody was detected at sites of myelin destruction. 13, 18 The mechanism of antibody-mediated demyelination is not known with certainty. Several studies showed that complement depletion with cobra venom factor (CVF) resulted in delayed onset of EAE and a reduction in demyelination. 19 EAE has been reported to be ameliorated 20 or unaffected 21 in mice deficient in C3 expression. Other studies implicate a role for the terminal components of complement in demyelination, via formation of membrane attack complex (MAC). 22, 23 MAC has multiple functions, including direct cell lysis and enhancement of phagocytosis. Fc receptors (FcR) that are involved in the interaction of antibodies with effector cells, including macrophages, have also been implicated in antibody-induced demyelination. 24 Mice deficient in expression of activating FcR (Fc\u2425RI and Fc\u2425RIII) develop less disease and demyelination whereas disease is exacerbated in mice lacking expression of the inhibitory Fc\u2425RII molecule.",

For example, C3a and C5a both increase expression of adhesion molecules and can serve as chemoattractants for macrophages and T cells. 25 C5a is also required for optimal T-cell activation because treatment of mice with a C5a antagonist results in a diminished CD8 T-cell response. 26 Therefore, administration of anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody may initiate the demyelinating process, but demyelination may be primarily T cell-mediated, with complement activation serving to enhance the T-cell response.",

The S protein is the most abundant JHM protein present on the infected cell surface and would be predicted to be the target for anti-JHM demyelinating antibody. The N and M proteins are predicted to lack surface expression. However, previous reports suggested that Nand M-specific antibody epitopes are expressed on the cell surface. 32 Mice that received irrelevant antibody (anti-KLH) or PBS developed only insignificant amounts of demyelination (Table 1) . By comparison, JHM-infected RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea recipients of JHM-immune splenocytes exhibited similar amounts of demyelination, although the kinetics of myelin destruction was more rapid, with demyelination detected by 7 to 8 days after infection ( Figure 2 ). 4,7 Demyelination in mAb 5B19.2-treated mice did not reflect differences in virus clearance because similar amounts of virus were detected in recipients of anti-JHM mAb, PBS, or irrelevant antibody (Table 1 ).

None of these antibodies, regardless of their specificity, exhibited a protective effect because all mice were moribund by 14 to 16 days after infection, when 5 g were administered. This result was not expected, because mAb 5A13.5 has a high neutralizing antibody titer (1:6230 PRD/mg) and has been reported to protect B6 mice from encephalitis. 29 We found, however, that mAb 5A13.5 was inefficient compared to mAb 5B19.2 at protecting B6 mice from acute encephalitis after inoculation with neurovirulent JHM (data not shown). Mice that received 5 g of mAb 5A13.5 showed clinical signs of demyelination, including difficulty righting and hindlimb paresis, with demyelination detected on histological examination (6.0 \u03ee 2.4%).

            "text": "To begin to delineate the mechanism(s) of antibodymediated demyelination, we first determined the role of activating FcRs (Fc\u2425RI and Fc\u2425RIII) in this process. For this purpose, we generated FcR\u2425 \u03ea/\u03ea RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea mice. These mice are deficient in Fc\u2425RI and Fc\u2425RIII expression, in addition to lacking T and B cells, and are therefore useful for investigating the role of FcR-dependent pathways in antibody-induced demyelination. FcR\u2425 \u03ea/\u03ea mice express \u03f320% as much Fc\u2425RI as wild-type mice, but no Fc\u2425RIII and exhibit impaired phagocytic function. 34 In preliminary experiments, we observed that FcR\u2425 \u03e9/\u03ea RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea mice were slightly more resistant to JHM infection than RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea mice, surviving 1 to 2 days longer, although no demyelination developed in any of these mice. This difference may reflect a difference in genetic lineage because FcR\u2425 \u03ea/\u03ea mice were obtained on a B6x129 background. Consequently, heterozygous littermates were infected to control for potential genetic differences. FcR\u2425 \u03ea/\u03ea RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea mice were more susceptible to JHM than were their FcR\u2425 \u03e9/\u03ea RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea littermates, with death occurring by 14.7 \u03ee 1.5 days versus 17.0 \u03ee 2.7 days after infection. The basis for this difference is not understood because no antibody is present in these an-imals. This enhanced susceptibility to JHM was even more evident after treatment with mAb 5B19.2, with FcR\u2425 \u03ea/\u03ea RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea mice moribund by 17 days after infection whereas JHM-infected FcR\u2425 \u03e9/\u03ea RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea mice survived for greater than 20 days after infection. All mice, therefore, were examined for viral load and demyelination in the CNS at 17 days after infection ( Table 2) . mAb 5B19.2-treated FcR\u2425 \u03ea/\u03ea RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea mice developed clinical signs of acute encephalitis such as hunching, lethargy, and ruffled fur by this time. In contrast, mAb 5B19.2treated FcR\u2425 \u03e9/\u03ea RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea mice from the same litters exhibited primarily hindlimb weakness. Consistent with these clinical observations, demyelination in FcR\u2425 \u03ea/\u03ea RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea mice was significantly reduced compared to controls (9.1 \u03ee 1.4% versus 1.2 \u03ee 0.4%, P \u03fd 0.0001) ( Table 2 ). These results were not explained by differences in virus titer because similar amounts of infectious virus were present in both FcR\u2425 \u03e9/\u03ea RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea and FcR\u2425 \u03ea/\u03ea RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea mice ( Table 2) .",

Additionally, recent studies showed that antibody-mediated autoimmune disease was dependent on both intact complement and FcR pathways for maximal disease expression. 35, 36 Consequently, we next evaluated the role of complement in anti-JHM antibody-induced demyelination, using CVF, a homolog of C3b, to deplete complement. Mice were treated with CVF at dosages and frequency shown previously to result in complement depletion (0.5 g/kg beginning 1 day before antibody injection and every 3 days thereafter). 19, 37 CVF treatment in the presence of mAb 5B19.2 did not alter survival, with mice becoming moribund at 18 to 20 days after infection, similar to mice that received only antibody. However, mice treated with CVF showed clinical signs of encephalitis including hunching, lethargy, and ruffled fur, but few signs of demyelination (difficulty righting, hindlimb paresis) when compared to control mice. CVF treatment resulted in a slight increase in virus titer in the CNS (5.5 \u03ee 0.2 log 10 PFU/g brain versus 6.0 \u03ee 0.1 log 10 PFU/g brain, P \u03fd 0.02).

Infusion of anti-KLH antibody or normal rabbit sera did not cause demyelination, showing that nonspecific binding to infected cells or to FcR on macrophages was inadequate to initiate this process. Furthermore, only some anti-virus antibodies were able to mediate demyelination. We cannot draw firm conclusions about the characteristics of anti-virus antibodies that allow them to mediate demyelination because only a limited number were examined in our study. It is likely that the viral epitopes recognized by demyelinating antibodies must be expressed on the cell surface although this has not been formally proven for mAb 5B11.5, the anti-M mAb that was able to induce demyelination. One anti-S antibody, mAb 5B93.9, did not mediate demyelination. This mAb may not be demyelinating because it is an IgA antibody, or because the epitope that it recognizes is not fully accessible on the native S glycoprotein. Antibody-induced demyelination did not occur only after infection with the neuroattenuated J2.2 variant of JHM used in this study. Robust demyelination occurred in anti-JHM antibody-treated RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea mice intranasally infected with 5 \u03eb 10 4 PFU of the parental neurovirulent JHM strain. In this instance, a larger amount of antibody (10 g of mAb 5B19.2) was required to enhance survival, but demyelination (32.3 \u03ee 5.2%, n \u03ed 7) was observed at 13 to 20 days after infection. In addition, Matthews and colleagues 39 showed that the A59 strain of mouse hepatitis virus also induced substantial amounts of demyelination when RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea mice were infected in the presence of virus-specific hyperimmune serum.",

            "text": "Antibodies capable of initiating myelin destruction may function by one or more mechanisms. Virus-specific antibody may directly interact with infected cells in the CNS, thereby resulting in the expression of chemoattractants for macrophages/microglia. Consistent with this possibility, anti-JHM antibody was detected at sites of demyelination ( Figure 1H ). CCL2/monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and CCL3/macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u2423 have been identified as crucial for macrophage/microglia infiltration in EAE 40 -42 and CCL2 and CCL5/RANTES were implicated in macrophage infiltration into the JHMinfected CNS. 43, 44 However, these chemokines are expressed at high levels in the JHM-infected RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea CNS 8 and we have been unable to detect differences in expression of these chemokines after T-cell transfer that correlate with extent of demyelination. 45, 46 Thus, if these chemokines are important in antibody-mediated demyelination, it is likely that there will be localized differences in expression, rather than substantial changes in total pro-duction in the CNS. Alternatively, antibody may bind to circulating virus antigen and the resulting immune complexes may activate macrophages in the periphery. Because the milieu of the JHM-infected RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea CNS is proinflammatory, 8 this peripheral activation may be all that is required for demyelination to occur. Precedent for this comes from EAE studies, because peripheral activation of macrophages is critical in the development of disease. 47 Both complement and Fc\u2425R-dependent pathways were implicated in antibody-mediated demyelination in JHM-infected RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea mice, at least when mAb 5B19.2 was infused. mAb 5B19.2 is an IgG1 antibody, a subclass that activates complement poorly through the classical pathway. It is conceivable that the relative contribution of each pathway to demyelination would change if an antibody that was more effective in fixing complement were used. The role of complement in autoimmune disease, including EAE, remains controversial, partly because the effects of complement are pleiotropic. Some studies suggested that early components of the complement pathway were most critical. C3b and C4b may function as an opsonin for myelin, thereby enhancing phagocytosis by macrophages. 48, 49 C3a and C5a are chemoattractants for monocytes/macrophages 25 and thereby may directly contribute to the influx of these cells into the white matter. Both of these complement products are anaphylatoxins and have multiple proinflammatory effects on macrophages, including enhancing differentiation and cytokine release. 50 Additionally, C5a, via binding to C5aR, enhances the expression of activating Fc\u2425Rs and diminishes that of Fc\u2425RIIb, an inhibitory Fc\u2425R. 50 This property of C5a may contribute to the requirement for both complement-and FcR-dependent pathways for maximal demyelination in JHM-infected mice. Other studies, using rodents deficient in C6 expression, suggest that formation of the MAC is critical for demyelination in antibody-induced EAE. Demyelination and inflammatory cell infiltration were greatly reduced in C6 \u03ea/\u03ea rats with EAE. 22, 23 MAC, by directly damaging infected oligodendrocytes, may contribute to an inflammatory cascade, resulting in macrophage infiltration and demyelination in JHM-infected mice. MAC, in sublytic amounts, may also contribute to inflammation by activating target cells. 51 Fc\u2425Rs were also critical for antibody-induced demyelination in JHM-infected RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea mice. Although Fc\u2425Rs may be involved in antigen presentation, 52 this function is unlikely to be important in RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea mice. More likely, macrophages/microglia are activated via the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif present on the \u2425 chain of activating Fc\u2425Rs. Activation via the Fc\u2425R may not only enhance recruitment of macrophages/microglia to the infected white matter, but also may be involved in release of cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-\u2423 and interleukin-1 and the release of substances such as oxygen radicals that may directly damage myelin. 53 Requirements for both complement-and Fc\u2425R-dependent pathways have been demonstrated in other antibody-mediated pathological conditions, including immune complex-mediated skin and lung disease 36,50 and inflammatory arthritis. 35 Collectively, these studies suggest that antibody binding to infected oligodendrocytes leads to generation of C3a and C5a and the formation of MAC as well as the activation of macrophages/microglia via FcR-dependent pathways. This results in increased migration of these cells into the white matter of the spinal cord with subsequent destruction of infected oligodendrocytes and myelin. Our results emphasize the multifactorial and complex nature of the demyelinating process. Although \u2423\u2424 T cells are generally responsible for the bulk of immune-mediated myelin damage in most experimental models, either \u2425\u2426 T cells 31 or antibody directed against an antigen present in the CNS (JHM in our experiments) can also mediate demyelination. In patients with MS, T cells are also believed to be critical for the development of inflammation. However, IgG and complement deposition are detected in demyelinating lesions in MS lesions, consistent with a role in myelin destruction, and have also been implicated in the initial stages of the demyelinating process. 16, 54 Our results show, that under the appropriate circumstances, antibodies in the absence of T cells can cause demyelination.",

Demyelination (A) and extensive macrophage/microglia infiltration into the white matter (B) were evident only in mice that received JHM-immune sera, but not in control mice (D and E). However, viral antigen was uniformly distributed throughout spinal cords in both JHM-immune sera-treated (C) and control (F) mice, except in areas of demyelination (C). Antibodies deposited in the CNS (H) were detected exclusively adjacent to areas of frank demyelination. G: An area with a moderate amount of demyelination is depicted in this figure.

We determined whether the amount of mAb 19.2 present in the serum of RAG1 \u03ea/\u03ea mice was similar to levels of anti-JHM antibody detected in JHM-infected B6 mice undergoing demyelination. Serum NTs, which primarily measure the anti-S antibody response, were similar between the two groups: 1:32 (range, 1:19 to 1:45; n \u03ed 2) at 2 days after mAb 19.2 transfer versus 1:86.2 \u03ee 42.7 (n \u03ed 4) at 21 days after infection in JHM-infected B6 mice.",
