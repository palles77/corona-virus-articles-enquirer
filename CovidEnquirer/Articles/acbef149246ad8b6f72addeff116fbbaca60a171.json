Clinical signs do not necessarily correlate with the location of the tumor in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract with the exception of tenesmus and hematochezia, which occur with colonic or rectal disease. Palpating an abdominal mass is a consistent finding but depends on the practitioner's level of palpation skill. The rest of the clinical findings are less common. Duration of clinical signs before diagnosis can range from days to months. Many cases are treated for clinical signs conservatively before relapse and definitive diagnosis. CNS signs, icterus, and other polysystemic signs may occur in cats with feline infectious peritonitis (see Chapter 38).",
