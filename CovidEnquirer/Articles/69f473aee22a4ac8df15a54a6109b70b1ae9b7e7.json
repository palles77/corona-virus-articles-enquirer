            "text": "Protein therapeutics represent a significant and growing component of the modern pharmacopeia, but their potential to treat human disease is limited because most proteins fail to traffic across biological membranes. Recently, we discovered that cell-permeant miniature proteins (CPMPs) containing a precisely defined, penta-arginine motif traffic readily to the cytosol and nucleus with efficiencies that rival those of hydrocarbon-stapled peptides active in animals and man. Like many cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), CPMPs enter the endocytic pathway; the difference is that CPMPs are released efficiently from endosomes while other CPPs are not. Here, we seek to understand how CPMPs traffic from endosomes into the cytosol and what factors contribute to the efficiency of endosomal release. First, using two complementary cell-based assays, we exclude endosomal rupture as the primary means of endosomal escape. Next, using a broad spectrum of techniques, including an RNA interference (RNAi) screen, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), and confocal imaging, we identify VPS39-a gene encoding a subunit of the homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) complex-as a critical determinant in the trafficking of CPMPs and hydrocarbon-stapled peptides to the cytosol. Although CPMPs neither inhibit nor activate HOPS function, HOPS activity is essential to efficiently deliver CPMPs to the cytosol. Subsequent multi-color confocal imaging studies identify CPMPs within the endosomal lumen, particularly within the intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) of Rab7 + and Lamp1 + endosomes that are the products of HOPS-mediated fusion. These results suggest that CPMPs require HOPS to reach ILVs-an environment that serves as a prerequisite for efficient endosomal escape. 4 conclude that HOPS allows CPMPs to traffic into intraluminal vesicles (ILVs), a favorable environment for endosomal escape. The identification of ILVs as a portal for passing proteins into the cytosol will aid the development of next-generation biologics that overcome the limitations imposed by cellular membranes.",

Although there has been limited work on the effects of certain CPPs on the integrity of large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) in vitro (26), the concentration-dependent effects of CPMPs or more traditional cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) on endosomal integrity in cultured cells have not been thoroughly evaluated. Thus, we began our analysis with two complementary assays that together detect both subtle and severe endosomal damage in cells treated with a CPMP or CPP. One assay exploits a set of eGFP-labeled galectins to fluorescently tag damaged endosomes to enable their visualization using confocal microscopy, while the other employs a fluorescently tagged version of the nonalysine (Lys9) peptide to quantify the extent of endosome rupture in cells treated with a CPMP or CPP. In both cases, the effects of the two most efficient CPMPs-aPP5.3 (1) and ZF5.3 (2)-were compared with those of prototypic members of three CPP families: the hydrocarbon-stapled peptide SAH-p53-8 (3) (22); Doctaarginine (D-Arg8, 4) (27), and a cyclic peptide containing both natural and unnatural amino acids, CPP12 (5) (26) (Figure 1 and Figure S1 ). SAH-p53-8 (3) is a hydrocarbon-stapled peptide that reaches the cell interior despite the absence of excess positive charge, D-octaarginine is the proteolytically stable enantiomer of the widely studied octapeptide L-Arg8 (27, 28), and CPP12 (5) is a cyclic peptide that reportedly reaches the cytosol with an efficiency that rivals aPP5.3 (26).",

Once displayed to the cytosol, \u03b2-galactosides recruit cytosolic galectin (Gal) proteins (37, 38), such as Gal1, 3, 4, 8, and 9, that share a conserved \u03b2galactoside binding site ( Figure S2A ) (39, 40). In particular, Gal3 and Gal8 are recruited to damaged Rab7 + and Lamp1 + endosomes that form along the degradative branch of the endocytic pathway (33, 40). Previous work has shown that endosomal damage can be detected by monitoring the translocation of eGFP fusions of Gal3 or Gal8 from the cytosol to endosome surfaces (29-34). Fusions of Gal3 or Gal8 and eGFP have also been used to visualize late endosome damage upon siRNA release from endosomes (40), screen for small molecules that induce lysosomal rupture (41), visualize endosomal leakage induced by osmocytosis and .

Human osteosarcoma (Saos-2) cells transiently expressing eGFP-hGal3 or eGFP-hGal8 were first treated for 1 hour with two known endosomolytic agents at concentrations reported to induce endosomal rupture and imaged using confocal microscopy to assess galectin recruitment from the cytosol to damaged endosomes ( Figure S2B ). These positive control reagents included Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (referred to as RNAiMAX henceforth) (16 \u03bcL/mL) and L-leucyl-L-leucine methyl ester (LLOMe) (1 mM). RNAiMAX is a cationic lipid formulation known to induce endosomal rupture to deliver siRNAs for targeted gene knockdown (40, 43). To induce visually detectable levels of endosomal rupture, we chose a concentration that is 3-fold higher than the average recommended concentration for siRNA transfection. For LLOMe, we chose a concentration, which had previously been reported to induce the desired galectin recruitment phenotype (31). Even though we routinely evaluate CPMP delivery after a 30-minute incubation period, we chose to evaluate endosomal rupture after a 60-minute incubation period to ensure detection of even low levels of rupture and galectin recruitment. The amount of endosomal recruitment was quantified using ImageJ (44) by calculating an endosomal recruitment coefficient (ERC), which was defined as the %-area of punctate fluorescence observed in a single cell divided by the total cell area, multiplied by 100 ( Figure S2C ). As expected (36, 40, 45), expression of eGFP-hGal3 or eGFP-hGal8 in untreated Saos-2 cells led to uniform eGFP fluorescence throughout the cytosol and nucleus with negligible punctate staining ( Figure S2B ). The average ERC values calculated in untreated Saos-2 cells expressing eGFP-hGal3 or eGFP-hGal8 were 2.0 \u00b1 0.6 and 3.4 \u00b1 0.7, respectively ( Figure S2D ). By contrast, treatment of Saos-2 cells with either RNAiMAX or LLOMe, both of which stimulate Gal3 and Gal8 recruitment to endolysosomal membranes in multiple cell lines (31, 33, 39, 40), led to significant punctate staining ( Figure S2B ). As previously reported, galectin recruitment occured within minutes and persisted for several hours (39). The average ERC values calculated when Saos-2 cells were treated with RNAiMAX were 62 \u00b1 8 (Gal-3) and 42 \u00b1 5 (Gal- 8) , values that represent increases of 30-and 14-fold over untreated cells ( Figure S2B and S2D). The effects of LLOMe were even more dramatic: the average ERC values in Saos-2 cells expressing eGFP-hGal3 or eGFP-hGal8 treated with LLOMe increased 147-and 68-fold compared to untreated cells, respectively. These data confirm the utility of eGFP-hGal3 and eGFP-hGal8 for monitoring CPP or CPMP-induced endolysosomal damage in Saos-2 cells.",

Each CPMP or CPP was tagged with a lissamine rhodamine B fluorophore (R) to enable its selective visualization alongside the eGFP-fused galectins. Galectin-expressing Saos-2 cells were treated with 600 nM 1 R -5 R (60 min), washed, and incubated for 30 min in CPMP/CPP-free media prior to imaging with confocal microscopy. This analysis revealed punctate red fluorescence throughout the cytosol, indicating endocytic uptake of CPPs 1 R -5 R , and a uniform distribution of eGFP-hGal3 and -8 throughout the cytosol and nucleus ( Figure S2B ). The average ERC values calculated when Saos-2 cells expressing eGFP-hGal3 or eGFP-hGal8 were treated with 600 nM CPPs 1 R -5 R were all less than 15 ( Figure S2D ), which is not significantly above the ERC of untreated Saos-2 cells. These data suggest that 1 R -5 R cause little or no galectin-positive endosomal damage at a treatment concentration of 600 nM.",

To explore whether treatment of cells with CPMPs or CPPs causes endosomal leakage, we developed an assay to detect the release of lissamine rhodamine B-tagged Lys9 (Lys9 R ) from endosomes into the cytosol in the presence of CPPs or CPMPs. The nonapeptide Lys9 is internalized via endocytosis but not released into the cytosol under normal physiological conditions (46, 47). We verified this finding, and then used fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) (19) to quantify the concentration of Lys9 R that reached the cytosol in the presence of CPMPs or CPPs ( Figure S3A ). Control experiments confirmed that Saos-2 cells treated with increasing concentrations of RNAiMAX (0 to 16 \u03bcL/mL) exhibited a dose-dependent increase in Lys9 R , which was detected in the cytosol and nucleus using FCS. The highest concentration of RNAiMAX (16 \u03bcL/mL) yielded a 39-fold increase in the cytosolic (806 \u00b1 87 nM) and a 46-fold increase in the nuclear (1212 \u00b1 129 nM) concentrations of Lys9 R ( Figure S3B ). Similar titration experiments with LLOMe yielded no detectable endosomal leakage of Lys9 R , even at the highest tested LLOMe concentration (1 mM) ( Figure S3C ). LLOMe selectively induces lysosomal permeabilization (48, 49); it is possible that Lys9 R leakage can only occur efficiently from endosomes that precede the lysosome-an observation that has also been made for the endosomal escape of siRNA lipoplexes (40) and a disulfide-bonded dimer of Tat (dfTat) (50).",

Miniature proteins 1 R and 2 R , and the hydrocarbon-stapled peptide 3 R were present in the cytosol at 3-to 9-fold higher concentrations than D-Arg8 4 R . We were unable to perform conclusive FCS experiments with CPPs 4 R and 5 R . Specifically, in cells treated with 4 R and 5 R , we observed diffusion times that were between 50-to 150-fold longer compared to their respective in vitro diffusion times ( Figure S4B and Table S2 ). Diffusion times in cultured cells reportedly increase between 2-and 10-fold compared to their corresponding in vitro diffusion times (51). Increases greater than 10-fold may indicate intracellular aggregation or binding to a cellular component, preventing us from extracting meaningful parameters from the FCS data. To circumvent this problem, we performed biochemical fractionation experiments (19) to estimate the cytosolic concentrations attained by 4 R and 5 R .",

No significant leakage of Lys9 R into the cytosol or nucleus was observed at CPMP or CPP concentrations below 2 \u03bcM ( Figure S3D -H). At 2.4 \u03bcM, CPMPs 1 UL and 2 UL induced low levels of Lys9 R endosomal leakage ( Figure S3D and S3E ), corresponding to a 6-and 10-fold increase above background for 1 UL and 2 UL , respectively. A similar increase in intracellular Lys9 R concentration was observed at 8 \u03bcL/mL treatment with RNAiMAX ( Figure S3B ), a concentration that is commonly used for efficient siRNA transfection (43). The remaining polypeptides 3 UL -5 UL did not induce significant Lys9 R leakage at any concentration tested in this assay ( Figure S3F-H) . Taken together, the galectin recruitment and Lys9 leakage assays demonstrate that CPMPs and CPPs 1 R -5 R /1 UL -5 UL do not induce endosomal rupture at concentrations below 2 \u03bcM. Above 2 \u03bcM, 1 UL and 2 UL induce low levels of galectin recruitment and Lys9 R leakage, indicating that they are causing endosomal damage. Toxicity studies that monitored metabolic activity over an extended 4 h timeframe by detecting cellular ATP (CellTiter-Glo) revealed EC 50 values for 1 UL , 2 UL , 4 UL , 5 UL that were >20 \u00b5M; the value for SAH-p53-8, 3 UL , was 4.0 \u00b5M ( Figure S4C ).",

To characterize this mechanism, we designed a genome-wide RNAi screen to identify candidate genes whose knockdown increase or decrease the ability of CPMP 1 to reach cytosol ( Figure  2A ). To quantify cytosolic delivery of 1, we made use of a previously reported glucocorticoidinduced eGFP translocation (GIGT) assay (18, 20, 52 ) that couples the cytosolic delivery of a molecule tagged with dexamethasone (Dex) to the nuclear translocation of a reporter protein consisting of a glucocorticoid receptor variant with exceptional affinity for dexamethasone (GR*) (53, 54) fused to eGFP (GR*-eGFP) ( Figure S5A ). The effect of the Dex-tagged molecule on the ratio of GFP fluorescence in the nucleus and cytosol, termed the translocation ratio (TR), can be measured with precision using an Opera High-Content Screening System and thereby provides a quantifiable readout of cytosolic access (18, 20) . Previously, we demonstrated that the GIGT/Opera combination assay is associated with robust Z-factors of \u22650.5 and is therefore suitable for quantifying the cytosolic delivery of Dex-labeled CPMPs aPP5.3 Dex (1 Dex ) and ZF5.3 Dex (2 Dex ) in a high-throughput setting (20). Saos-2 cells stably expressing GR*-GFP (Saos-2(GIGT) cells) were prepared as described previously (20).",

We then performed a duplicate pilot screen with 320 randomly chosen siRNAs from the Dharmacon human genome library. With this subset of siRNAs, we assessed assay performance in Saos-2(GIGT) cells treated with the CPMP 1 Dex at 1 \u00b5M concentration, which yielded the highest S/B ( Figure S5C ). This concentration is also well below 2.4 \u00b5M, the lowest concentration at which some endosomal leakage was detected. Performance was robust across this siRNA test panel, with a mean signal-to-background (S/B) ratio of 2.3 when comparing the translocation ratios (TR) of Saos-2(GIGT) cells treated with 1 Dex to untreated cells; the S/B ratio of an average siRNA screen is 2.9 (55). The observed coefficient of variation (CV), a measure of data variability, was also excellent; the 11.2% value observed was below the average observed in both small-molecule and siRNA screens (55). The calculated Z-factor (Z') was 0.3, within the acceptable range for siRNA screens (55), and the reproducibility between replicate wells was high (Pearson correlation coefficient: r = 0.8) ( Figure  S5C ). Collectively, these statistics are modestly better than the average of representative RNAi screens (55) and highlight the suitability of the GIGT/Opera combination assay for high-content RNAi screening.",

To confirm that we had successfully prioritized genes of unknown function and those implicated previously in endocytic trafficking, we cross-referenced the set of 131 prioritized genes with the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) (62, 63). We specified the gene ontology classification \"cellular compartment\" to evaluate the \"enrichment\" of this set of 131 genes with respect to categories of subcellular organelles. The most enriched organelle categories, according to the database analysis, were the Golgi stack, the lysosomal membrane, and the late endosome.

To evaluate the effects of each siRNA knockdown on the trafficking of CPMPs using FC and FCS, we chose to focus on CPMP 2 R -while CPMPs 1 R and 2 R follow a similar endocytic trafficking pattern into the cell interior (18), 2 R is more stable and reaches the cytosol more efficiently (19) .",

Knockdown of only four of the 28 candidate genes (VPS39, SCAMP5, PIGW, and DOCK4) significantly decreased the overall uptake of 2 R , as determined using FC (left axis in Figure 3B -D); none of the siRNAs significantly increased overall uptake when measured in this way ( Figure 3B-D) . Different trends emerged when siRNA knockdown effects were evaluated using FCS (right axis in Figure 3B -D); in this case 19 of 28 knockdowns led to a significant decrease in the concentration of 2 R in the cytosol or nucleus. Knockdown of six of the 28 candidate genes strongly reduced (>70%) the delivery of 2 R to the nucleus and cytosol: these genes include VPS39, SCAMP5, PXN, PIGW, MS4A4A, and LYPLA1 ( Figure  3B ). Knockdown of an additional 13 candidate genes moderately reduced (40-70%) the delivery of 2 R to the nucleus and cytosol: these genes include TAS2R45, CASC1, KLHDC10,  CSGALNACT2, INA, IL17REL, RAB2A, ZYX, INADL, ABPA3, GNG13, AVL9 , and TVP23A ( Figure 3C) . Notably, knockdown of one candidate gene, ARHGAP9, led to a significant (+49%) increase in the delivery of 2 R to the nucleus and cytosol ( Figure 3D ); this finding suggests that inhibitors of ARHGAP9 could improve endosomal release. It is also notable that genes whose knockdown strongly reduced the delivery of 2 R encompass multiple cellular activities related to membrane homeostasis, including membrane tethering (VPS39, RAB2A), glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor biosynthesis (PIGW), thioesterases (LYPLA1), and cytoskeletal genes (PXN, ZYX). The remaining eight genes consisted of DOCK4 and seven olfactory receptors (ORs: OR4C6, OR4F15, OR51E1, OR51Q1, OR52N1, OR5M8, OR8D1) , which were eventually classified as false positives ( Figure 3C ). In summary, of the 28 genes identified in the GIGT high-throughput screen, knockdown of six strongly inhibited cytosolic access, knockdown of 13 moderately inhibited cytosolic access, and knockdown of one gene promoted cytosolic access ( Figure 3E ). These data provide evidence that we successfully screened and prioritized genes that primarily regulate intracellular trafficking-with 20 out 28 genes affected by FCS-and not overall uptake-with only four genes affected by FC.",

In particular, the hydrocarbon-stapled peptide SAH-p53-8 R (3 R ) achieves average intracellular concentrations (as determined by FCS in HeLa or Saos-2 cells) that are only 10-50% lower than those attained by ZF5.3 R (2 R ), depending on the cell line used (19) .

Knockdown of five genes-VPS39, INA, LYPLA1, KLHDC10, and CASC1 strongly (>50%) inhibited the appearance of both 2 R and 3 R in the cytosol (blue open circles). Knockdown of another four genes-MS4A4A, TAS2R45, RAB2A, and APBA3-resulted in a moderate (30-50%) decrease in the appearance of both 2 R and 3 R in the cytosol (green dots). Knockdown of AVL9, although statistically significant, did not have a strong %-effect on the ability of either 2 R or 3 R to reach the cytosol ( Figure S7A ). When the effects of these gene knockdowns on overall uptake of 2 R and 3 R are plotted, the effects are small, as expected ( Figure S7B ). Overall, the observed correlation between the effects of gene knockdowns on the cytosolic localization of CPMP 2 R and hydrocarbon-stapled peptide 3 R suggests that these genes play common roles in the intracellular trafficking of these two molecular families. The five genes that most strongly regulate cytosolic delivery of both 2 R or 3 R can be divided into four categories: (1) genes with known roles in endocytic trafficking (VPS39); (2) genes involved in the processing of post hoc translational protein modifications (LYPLA1), (3) genes involved in RNA processing (CASC1), and (4) genes with poorly characterized or unknown functions (INA and KLHDC10).",

One gene transcript, when depleted, strongly inhibited the cellular uptake and cytosolic delivery of both CPMP 2 R and stapled peptide 3 R : the VPS39 gene, also known as hVamp6. VPS39 encodes an 875-residue protein that is conserved in eukaryotes (68) and is one of six protein subunits comprising the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) membrane tethering complex ( Figure 4A ). Working with VPS41 and various effector proteins (69, 70), VPS39 recruits the HOPS complex to endosomes positive for the small GTPase Rab7, such as maturing (Rab5 + /Rab7 + ) and late (Rab7 + ) endosomes. The remaining four core HOPS subunits, VPS11, VPS16, VPS18, and VPS33A, serve primarily a structural role (70). A fully assembled HOPS complex is required to initiate fusion of Rab7 + maturing and late endosomes as they are converted into lysosomes ( Figure  6B ). Depletion of any subunit delays lysosome maturation and inhibits cargo degradation ( Figure 4B ) (70-72). HOPS is closely related to a structurally similar complex, the CORVET complex ( Figure 4A ), that precedes HOPS along the endocytic pathway by promoting the fusion of Rab5 + early and maturing endosomes (73). CORVET shares four core subunits with HOPS but contains TGFBRAP1 and VPS8 (73) in place of VPS39 and VPS41.",

Saos-2 cells transfected with a non-targeting (RISC-Free) or a pool of four VPS41-targeting siRNAs were treated with 2 R or 3 R (600 nM) for 30 minutes and analyzed using both FC and FCS as described above ( Figure 4C and 4D). In our primary screen, we found that siRNAs against VPS41 displayed a mild inhibitory effect on GR*-eGFP translocation in the presence of 1 Dex (27% mean percent effect, 1.58 Z-score, 1.65 SSMD), which was below our hit threshold. Here, upon VPS41 depletion, we observed a moderate decrease (-27%) in overall uptake and a strong (-71%) decrease in the average intracellular concentration for 2 R ( Figure 4C ); these changes are comparable to those observed after VPS39 knockdown. In VPS41-depleted cells treated with hydrocarbon-stapled peptide 3 R , we also observed a significant decrease in overall uptake (-27%) and in the average intracellular delivery (-55%) by FCS ( Figure 4D ); these changes are also similar to those observed after VPS39 knockdown. By contrast, no significant decreases in overall uptake or cytosolic localization of 2 R or 3 R were observed upon depletion of the CORVET-specific subunits TGFBRAP1 and VPS8 ( Figure 4C and 4D); in fact, depletion of the TGFBRAP subunit led to significant increases in both overall uptake and cytosolic concentration of 2 R and 3 R ( Figure 4C and 4D). Taken together, these data support a hypothesis in which both unique components of the HOPS complex, VPS39 and VPS41, are required to allow cytosolic access of both CPMP 2 R and hydrocarbon-stapled peptide 3 R . Similar trends were observed in comparable experiments performed using CPMP 1 R ( Figure S8A ) implying that HOPS-dependent membrane tethering is also necessary for the efficient delivery of CPMP 1 R to the cytosol.",

As expected, depletion of HOPS-specific subunits VPS39 and VPS41 significantly reduced the colocalization of Alexa Fluor 488-dextran and Magic Red, leading to significantly lower Manders coefficients of 0.11 \u00b1 0.024 and 0.12 \u00b1 0.016, respectively ( Figure S9B and S9C).",

In cells treated with CPMPs/CPPs 1 UL -5 UL , the colocalization of Alexa Fluor 488-dextran and Magic Red was characterized by Manders coefficients that ranged from 0.27 \u00b1 0.03 (when treated with 5 UL ) to 0.33 \u00b1 0.03 (when treated with 1 UL ), well within the range of values measured in cells that had not been treated with CPMPs or CPPs ( Figure S9E and S9F). We conclude that the treatment of Saos-2 cells with CPMPs 1-5 neither inhibits nor enhances the intrinsic function of HOPS-mediated endosomal fusion. As a whole, our studies suggest that the endosomal escape of all CPMPs and CPPs tested is dependent on the presence of a functional, active HOPS complex.",

Depletion of HOPS-specific subunits significantly decreases the cytosolic and nuclear concentrations of all CPMP/CPPs tested. Three limiting models are consistent with these experimental findings. The first invokes a direct interaction between a CPMP/CPP located within or on the surface of a Rab7 + late endosome and a component of the HOPS complex, perhaps VPS39 or VPS41, that effectively shuttles the CPMP or CPP from an endosome into the cytosol (model 1). The second model also positions the CPMP/CPP within or on the surface of a Rab7 + late endosome but lacks a direct HOPS-CPMP/CPP interaction; in this case HOPS facilitates escape of the CPMP/CPP during the fusion process (76, 77) (model 2). In the third model, the CPMP or CPP escapes after HOPS-dependent fusion is complete, when maturing and late endosomes have fused into compartments containing intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) (model 3). In this case, interactions between CPMPs and ILVs in the late endosome may facilitate endosomal escape; indeed, some evidence for CPP-ILV interactions have been reported (50). Implicit in models 1 and 2 is the colocalization of a CPMP/CPP with or upon the membrane of a Rab7 + late endosome. Confocal microscopy of Saos-2 cells expressing either the early endosomal (EE) marker Rab5-GFP, the late endosomal marker (LE) Rab7-GFP, or the lysosomal (LY) marker Lamp1-GFP and treated with 2 R (300 nM, 30 min) revealed low colocalization between 2 R and EEs (Pearson r = 0.20 \u00b1 0.019) but high colocalization of 2 R with LEs (r = 0.55 \u00b1 0.034) and LYs (r = 0.58 \u00b1 0.027) ( Figure 5A , 5B, 5D). However, these experiments could not resolve whether the fluorescence of 2 R was localized to the endosomal lumen or the membrane. To better resolve the location of 2 R , we treated Saos-2 cells with the small molecule YM201636, an inhibitor of the phosphoinositide kinase PIK-fyve that enlarges Rab7 + endolysosomes (78, 79). Again, in cells expressing GFP-labeled endosomal markers, we observed virtually no colocalization between 2 R and EEs (r = 0.034 \u00b1 0.025), good colocalization with LEs (r = 0.57 \u00b1 0.043), and excellent colocalization with LYs (r = 0.73 \u00b1 0.023) ( Figure 5C and 5D). Line profiles across these enlarged vesicles provide no evidence for accumulation of 2 R on the LE or LY membrane; instead, plots of fluorescence intensity as a function of position show clearly separable distributions of fluorescence due to GFP (green) and lissamine rhodamine B (red) ( Figure 5E and 5F). These distributions suggest that 2 R resides primarily within Rab7 + and Lamp1 + vesicles and not on their surface and is inconsistent with models 1 or 2 as the primary means of endosomal escape.",

Late endosomes are characterized, among other properties, by the presence of ILVs. To determine whether the smaller 2 Rcontaining vesicles observed in late endosomes represent ILVs, we used a known ILV marker, the lipid N-Rh-PE, a lissamine rhodamine B-tagged version of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3phosphoethanolamine (80) ( Figure S10A ). N-Rh-PE is internalized via the endocytic pathway into ILVs (81-83) before it is eventually secreted in exosomes (80, 82, 84). As expected (80), N-Rh-PE localizes to the luminal side of Rab7-GFP + late endosomes (r = 0.39 \u00b1 0.050) and Lamp1-GFP + lysosomes (r = 0.45 \u00b1 0.031), but not to Rab5-GFP + early endosomes (r = 0.104 \u00b1 0.004) ( Figure S10B and S10D).

Saos-2 cells treated with both N-Rh-PE and 2 SiR showed significant colocalization (r = 0.53 \u00b1 0.028) ( Figure S10F and S10G) providing evidence that CPMP 2 SiR indeed localizes to ILVs or to LEs and LYs that contain ILVs, providing support for model 3.",

If so, then knockdown of HOPS components (but not CORVET components) should reduce trafficking of 2 SiR to LEs and LYs. To test this hypothesis, we transfected Saos-2 cells with siRNAs against HOPS subunit VPS39 and CORVET subunit TGFBRAP1. In control cells transfected with a non-targeting (RISC-Free) siRNA, we measured virtually no colocalization between 2 SiR and EE marker Rab5-GFP (r = 0.05 \u00b1 0.01), moderate colocalization with LE marker Rab7-GFP (r = 0.25 \u00b1 0.016), and good colocalization with LY marker Lamp1-GFP (r = 0.57 \u00b1 0.027) ( Figure 6A and 6D).

There is compelling evidence that this journey often involves endocytosis (86, 87), the natural cellular process by which extracellular material is taken up into vesicles formed from the plasma membrane. However, the pathway into the cytosol requires not just uptake into endocytic vesicles, but also endosomal release, and this second step is widely recognized as the bottleneck hindering the efficient delivery of peptidic materials into the cytosol and nucleus (18, (88) (89) (90) (91) (92) (93) (94) (95) (96) . We discovered several years ago that CPMPs such as ZF5.3 (18, 97, 98) overcome this bottleneck to reach the cytosol with exceptional efficiency, both with (23) and without (19) an appended protein cargo. Here, we sought to understand the cellular processes that support the trafficking of CPMPs into the cytosol. First, using two complementary cell-based assays, we ruled out the most obvious mechanism of endosomal release-a partial or complete disruption of endosomal integrity. Next, using a spectrum of tools, including a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen, quantitative fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), and live-cell, multicolor confocal imaging, we identified VPS39-a gene encoding a subunit of the homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) complex-as a critical determinant in the trafficking of CPMPs to the cytosol. CPMPs neither inhibit nor activate HOPS activity; indeed, HOPS activity is essential for the cytosolic access of CPMPs as well as other CPPs and hydrocarbon-stapled peptides. Subsequent multi-color confocal imaging studies identify CPMPs within the endosomal lumen, particularly within the intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) of Rab7 + and Lamp1 + endosomes that are the products of HOPS-mediated fusion. These results suggest that CPMPs require HOPS to reach ILVs-an environment that serves as a prerequisite for efficient endosomal escape.",

In particular, although their genomes lack sequences encoding a canonical penta-arg motif, both CoV and Ebola require HOPS during the later steps of their postulated mechanism of cell entry: after the viral particle has been endocytosed but before it reaches the cytosol. Passage of CoV into the cytosol requires processing of viral proteins by lysosomal proteases to enable fusion with lysosomal membranes and release into the cytosol; HOPS depletion prevents CoV from reaching the lysosome and thus fusion and release cannot occur (100). Passage of Ebola virus is regulated by HOPS in a similar manner: Ebola viral particles are unable to fuse with the lysosomal membranes in HOPSdeficient cells (101). It is important to note that, in all cases where HOPS is a required cytosolic entry factor, no direct interactions between HOPS and the pathogen have been identified. HOPS operates in a supporting role by allowing the pathogen to escape during HOPS-mediated endosomal fusion, or by providing the pathogen with access to a favorable environment for .

            "text": "Significant experiments performed in vitro and in cultured cells provide additional support for an endosomal escape pathway that relies on the fusogenic activity of ILVs (26, 50, 78, 107). Experiments performed in vitro indicate that Tat 48-60 translocates efficiently across liposomal membranes whose lipid components resemble those of late endosomal ILVs (lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA)/1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PC)/1,2-dioleoylsn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (PE), 77:19:4), but not across those that resemble the late endosomal membrane (PC/PE/phosphatidylinositol (PI)/LBPA, 5:2:1:2), and not at all across those whose lipids resemble the plasma membrane (PC/PE/sphingomyelin (SM)/cholesterol, 1:1:1:1.5) (107). Similarly, a disulfide-bonded dimer of Tat (dfTat) induces leakage of the green fluorophore calcein from liposomes composed of ILV-like lipids (LBPA/PC/PE, 77:19:4), but not from liposomes that mimic EEs or the plasma membrane (PC:PE:cholesterol, 65:15:20) (50). The nuclear delivery of dfTat (as estimated by counting cells with nucleolar fluorescence staining from dfTat) is also significantly reduced in cells pre-incubated with an antibody against LBPA. LBPA is highly abundant in ILVs (108, 109) and its fusogenic activity is thought to be responsible for ILV back-fusion with endosomal membranes (110). Finally, certain cyclic CPPs, such as CPP12 (5), induce inward and outward membrane budding when added to giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) composed of LE lipids (PC/PE/PI/LBPA, 5:2:1:2) (26). The observed budding behavior is reminiscent of the dynamic nature of multivesicular LEs in live cells, for which ESCRT-dependent ILV inward budding and exosome outward budding are tightly connected to the unique LBPA-enriched lipid mixture observed in LEs (111). Finally, cellpermeant phosphorothioate-modified antisense oligonucleotides (PS-ASO) also colocalize with LBPA-containing ILVs inside LEs, and knockdown of ALIX protein-known to cause a reduction in cellular LBPA levels (110, 112, 113)-reduces cytosolic delivery of PS-ASO (78). Together, these data provide additional support for a model for cytosolic trafficking that requires HOPS to reach a favorable environment for endosomal escape: LEs and LYs containing ILVs enriched in the fusogenic lipid LBPA. The identification of ILVs as a portal for passing proteins into the cytosol will aid the development of next-generation biologics that overcome the limitations imposed by cellular membranes.",

For SDex-labeled peptides, concentrations were measured using an SDex extinction coefficient of 12,000 cm -1 M -1 at 242 nm in water, as described previously (4, 8) .

For unlabeled cyclic peptide CPP12, the extinction coefficient of naphthylalanine (3,936 cm -1 M -1 at \u03bb max (280 nm)) was used (9) . For SiRlabeled peptides, the reported extinction coefficient was used (1). Purified zinc finger CPMPs (2 UL , 2 Dex , and 2 R ) were dissolved in argon-purged 10 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4. To reduce cysteines, DTT (2 equiv.) was added and the solution was left to react for 15 min. Then, ZnCl 2 (2 equiv.) was added to the solution to induce the typical zinc finger fold. Zinc finger peptides were stored in solution at 4 \u00b0C. Repeated freeze-thawing cycles of zinc finger and aPP-based miniature proteins were avoided due to peptide aggregation and precipitation. All other peptides (3) (4) (5) were stored as a lyophilized powder or in solution at -20 \u00b0C and tolerated repeated freeze-thaw cycles.

HEK 293T cells (ATCC, CRL-3216) were cultured in complete growth medium (DMEM containing 4.5 g/L glucose, phenol red, 10% FBS, 5 mM sodium pyruvate, without antibiotics). Lentiviral particles were prepared in HEK 293T cells using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen, #L3000) transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 293T cells were seeded (1.2 Mio/well) into tissue-culture treated 6-well dishes in 2 mL packaging medium (Opti-MEM I containing 5% FBS and 1 mM sodium pyruvate) and left to adhere overnight. For transfection, a 1:1 mixture of solution A containing Lipofectamine 3000 in Opti-MEM I (250 \u03bcL) and solution B containing P3000 reagent, psPAX2 (3 equiv. 1688 ng/well), pDM2.G packaging plasmids (536 ng/well), and either eGFP-hGal3 or eGFP-hGal8 in pLenti CMV GFP puro plasmids (750 ng/well) in Opti-MEM I (250 \u03bcL), was prepared and incubated for 10 min at RT. The 1:1 mixture was added dropwise to the plated HEK 293T cells (total 500 \u03bcL/well) in 6-well plates. The medium was replaced with packaging medium 6 h after transfection. Lentiviral particles were harvested 24 h after transfection by carefully collecting the 2 mL cell supernatant from each well. Wells were replenished with fresh packaging medium, which was collected a second time 52 h post transfection. All lentivirus-containing fractions were stored at 4 \u00b0C for two days, combined, filtered through a 0.45 \u03bcm pore syringe filter, and concentrated using spin-filter concentrators (Amicon Ultra-15, 100 kD MWCO, EMD Millipore, #UFC910024). The concentrated lentiviral stock solutions were split into aliquots and frozen at -80 \u00b0C until used. To determine the viral titer, cells were transduced with increasing amounts of the lentiviral solution and the fluorescence intensity at 509 nm was measured and compared to untreated cells using an Attune NxT flow cytometer (Life Technologies).

For galectin recruitment assays, careful attention was paid not to overexpose cells to allow detection of even small amounts of galectin recruitment to endosomal membranes. The endosomal recruitment coefficient (ERC) was determined by measuring the area of punctate fluorescence in each cell, dividing it by the overall area of the same cell, and then multiplying it by 10,000 ( Figure S2C ) using ImageJ (14) . The ERC represents the %-area of punctate fluorescence in each cell multiplied by 100.",

After in vitro calibration with Alexa 594, confocal images of Saos-2 cells were obtained. FCS measurements were obtained by positioning the 561-nm laser's crosshair in the nucleus or the cytosol of Saos-2 cells. A minimum of 20 cells was measured for each experimental condition. To minimize background fluorescence and artifacts from diffusion, the laser's confocal volume was placed in a cytosolic area devoid of bright endosomes. Measurements in the nucleus were less prone to diffusional artifacts. For each FCS measurement, ten consecutive five-second time intervals were recorded. These ten traces were converted to their corresponding autocorrelation curves using a custom Matlab script (5) . Low quality traces were discarded as described above, the remaining traces were averaged, and the averaged trace was fit to an anomalous diffusion model (Equation 6 ). From the fit of the averaged autocorrelation curve, we obtained the number of Lys9 R molecules in the focal volume of the laser. This number of Lys9 R molecules was converted to the effective cytosolic or nuclear Lys9 R concentration using the laser's measured focal volume, as described in equations 2-5 above. Evaluation of the correlation curves revealed that cells generally displayed wide variation in the maximal autocorrelation signal, indicating an equally wide variation in the concentration of each molecule in the cytosol.",

When we incubated Saos-2 cells with D-Arg8 R (4 R ) and CPP12 R (5 R ), and performed FCS experiments similar to the ones described above, we observed in cellulo diffusion times that were more than 25 times longer compared to diffusion times commonly observed for aPP5.3 R (1 R ), ZF5.3 R (2 R ), or SAH-p53-8 R (3 R ) (Table S2 and Figure S4B ). An increase in diffusion time may be a sign of supramolecular aggregation or binding to intracellular factors, which renders FCS data analysis impossible. Therefore, we turned to our previously described cytosolic fractionation assay to calculate the cytosolic concentration of 4 R and 5 R relative to 2 R . We performed the same incubation protocol as described for the Lys9 FCS-based assays above, but with a larger population of Saos-2 cells.

The outer four columns of each 384-well plate contained experimental controls, while the inner 20 columns contained variable siRNAs, with 4 duplexes targeting a single gene within each well (SMARTpool siRNA). Background GR*eGFP translocation ratios (TRs) were determined from column 24, which contained untreated GR*eGFP cells transfected with RISC-Free non-targeting siRNA, while 1 Dex TRs were represented in columns 2 and 23. Plate-wide transfection efficiency was determined from column 1, which contained alternating buffer-only and Kif11 siRNA control wells. Knockdown of Kif11 results in mitotic arrest, phenotypically observable enlarged nuclei, and dead cells (15) . The significant loss in S14 cell number upon Kif11 transfection, relative to RISC-Free transfection, is commonly used as a measure of siRNA transfection efficiency during high-throughput screens. In a pilot screen, we identified that siRNAs targeting the SYNJ2BP gene enhanced GR*eGFP translocation in the presence of 1 Dex and yields a hit-like phenotype. We therefore included SYNJ2BP siRNA in columns 2 and 23 of every plate, to provide a representation of a hit candidate.

(C) Procedure for calculating an endosomal recruitment coefficient (ERC). In the example shown, Saos-2 cells expressing eGFP-hGal3 were treated with LLOMe (1 mM) for 1 hour to induce endolysosomal damage. Before LLOMe treatment, cells displayed diffuse cytosolic eGFP-hGal3 fluorescence. After LLOMe treatment, the eGFP-hGal3 fluorescence became predominantly punctate. To calculate the ERC, we measured the area (A) of each cell in the bright field channel using ImageJ. Second, we manually set a threshold to mark vesicular structures and generated a binary image thereof. Third, we measured the area of the punctate vesicles (V). Lastly, the ERC was calculated as the ratio of V over A multiplied by a factor of 10 4 . We routinely obtained ERC values around 0.0 in untreated cells and 400.0 in LLOMe-treated cells, which corresponds to 0% and 4% vesicular staining compared to the total cell area.

FCS data was obtained using a commercial Zeiss LSM 880 microscope. Images of cells were acquired in the x-y plane, and the laser's crosshair (= confocal volume) was placed in the nucleus or cytosol of cells, avoiding areas with high, punctate endosomal signal. Fluorescent fluctuations over time were recorded on a GaAsP detector and traces were converted to autocorrelation curves using a custom MATLAB script. Individual autocorrelation traces were averaged prior to fitting to a 3D diffusion model containing parameters for anomalous diffusion and background autocorrelation as described in LaRochelle et al., 2015. The fitted data points were assessed individually and filtered for data quality by evaluating diffusion time (\u03c4), signal intensity, and the anomalous diffusion coefficient (\u03b1).

We were unable to perform FCS experiments at CPMP/CPP concentrations above 1200 nM because the concentration of fluorescent molecules in the confocal volume was too high-especially for CPMP 2 R and hydrocarbon-stapled peptide 3 R -to obtain satisfactory fits to their corresponding autocorrelation curves. For FCS, concentrations were calculated for n cells in the cytosol (Cyt) and nucleus (Nuc) and error bars represent the standard error of the mean. For fractionation, concentrations were calculated for n biological replicates of 1.5 x 10 6 homogenized cells and normalized to an equal population of cells treated with 2 R at the same concentration. The cytosolic concentration of 2 R is known because it was measured using FCS. For fractionation, nuclear concentrations are not available (N/A).

(A) Overview of the glucocorticoid-induced eGFP translocation (GIGT) assay. Saos-2 cells stably expressing GR(C638G)-eGFP (= GR*-eGFP) were treated with dexamethasone (Dex) or a Dex-labeled peptide to induce the nuclear translocation of GR*-eGFP. The extent of nuclear translocation was quantified by a translocation ratio (TR), defined as the ratio of the nuclear to cytoplasmic (N/C) signal due to GR*-eGFP as determined using fluorescence microscopy and high content image analysis software (CellProfiler35 and Acapella).

Across this siRNA test panel, the GIGT system yielded a mean signal-to-background ratio of 2.3, coefficient of variation (CV) of 11.2%, Z-factor (Z') of 0.3, and Pearson's correlation coefficient (R) of 0.8.

Total RNA was extracted 72 h (unless noted otherwise) after transfection. RNA was reversetranscribed with gene-specific primers according to the manufacturer's protocol. For RT-qPCR, cDNA was amplified using SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix assay. Each biological replicate was run in triplicate, and assayed for both the siRNA-targeted gene and GAPDH (endogenous reference gene). (B) Negative transfection controls for FC and FCS. Saos-2 cells were transfected with siGENOME SMARTpool siRNAs (Dharmacon) for 72 hours according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were treated with CPMP 2 R (600 nM) for 30 minutes and exogenously bound peptide was removed with TrypLE Express.

Negative control: cells transected with nontargeting siRNA (RISC-Free siRNA). Left axis: FC = total cell uptake, fluorescence intensity per cell at 590 nm. Each data point (n) represents one biological replicate. For each FC replicate, the median fluorescence intensity at 590 nm was measured for at least 10,000 Saos-2 cells (gated for live cells). Right axis: FCS: cytosolic and nuclear concentration (nM). Each data point (n) denotes a 50-second FCS measurement recorded in a single cell. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean.

Each biological replicate was run in triplicate, assayed for the siRNA-targeted gene, and GAPDH as an endogenous reference gene. (E) The FCS intensity (in kHz) is proportional to the number (N) of molecules detected in the confocal volume for a laser. Each data point represents one 50-second FCS measurement recorded in the nucleus or cytosol of a single Saos-2 cell treated with 2 R (600 nM) for 30 min.

By setting an SSMD (see equation 12) threshold of \u00b12.0, we identified 263 genes whose knockdown enhance and 165 genes whose knockdown inhibit cytosolic access of CPMP 1 Dex . Table S5 . Prioritized hits (131) of the GIGT siRNA screen. Of the 428 primary hits, we prioritized genes according to function. We retained genes with known roles in endocytic trafficking and genes with unknown or poorly characterized functions. Table S6 . Raw data of the GR*-eGFP translocation screen. During this filtering step, we retained a gene if its knockdown did not induce a significant change in the translocation ratio (TR) for at least two of the four gene-specific siRNAs (A-D) compared to cells transfected with a non-targeting (RISC-Free) siRNA. This process eliminated 61 of 131 genes with 70 genes remaining for follow-up analysis. ****p < 0.0001, ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05, and not significant (ns) for p > 0.05 from oneway ANOVA with Dunnett post-test. Table S7 . Raw data of the siRNA deconvolution screen with CPMPs 1 Dex and 2 Dex . In this final filtering step, we prioritized siRNAs that induced significant TR changes for at least two out of the four gene-specific siRNAs (A-D) in cells treated with either CPMP 1 Dex or 2 Dex (or both), when compared to cells transfected with a non-targeting (RISC-Free) siRNA. siRNAs inducing significant TR changes are highlighted in blue (decrease) and red (increase). Union (final hits): 28 genes passed this filter for either CPMP 1 Dex or 2 Dex . Intersection: 9 genes passed this filter for both CPMPs 1 Dex or 2 Dex . ****p < 0.0001, ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05, and not significant (ns) for p > 0.05 from one-way ANOVA with Dunnett post-test.",
