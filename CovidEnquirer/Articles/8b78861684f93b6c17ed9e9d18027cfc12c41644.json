            "text": "Interpretation -Cirrhosis is a strong risk factor for avascular necrosis of the hip, but it is rare even in cirrhosis patients. \u25a0 Cirrhosis is the end-stage of all chronic liver diseases. It leads to a profound disturbance of the systemic circulation (Vallance and Moncada 1991) , of the immune response (Lin et al. 2007) , and of the coagulation system (Northup and Caldwell 2013) , but whether cirrhosis is a risk factor for joint disease has not been determined. Avascular necrosis (AVN) is bone necrosis caused by insuffi cient circulation, predominantly affecting bone parts with poor circulation: the femoral head and to a lesser extent the femoral condyles and carpal bones (Chang et al. 1993) . The pathogenesis of AVN remains poorly understood, but risk factors include tobacco smoking (Hirota et al. 1993 , Matsuo et al. 1988 ), corticosteroid treatment (Guo et al. 2014 ), alcoholism (Hirota et al. 1993 , Matsuo et al. 1988 ), fractures (Loizou and Parker 2009) , and certain other conditions (Mankin 1992) . Hung et al. (2011) reported that cirrhosis may also be a risk factor. Their study compared the risk of AVN in cirrhosis patients and that in an age-matched cohort of hospitalized patients with a high prevalence of conditions that predispose to AVN. They may therefore have underestimated the strength of the association. AVN is clinically signifi cant because many AVN patients require total hip arthroplasty (THA), and both AVN and cirrhosis are associated with an increased risk of complications after total hip arthroplasty (Bergh et al. 2014 , Jiang et al. 2014 , Deleuran et al. 2015 .",

The Danish National Patient Registry (NPR) is a nationwide registry that has covered admissions to non-psychiatric hospitals since 1977 and outpatient and emergency room visits since 1995. The data include relevant dates and discharge diagnoses, coded in accordance with the International Classifi cation of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD-10) from 1994 and the ICD-8 before that (Lynge et al. 2011) . The Danish Hip Arthroplasty Registry (DHR) is a clinical database of all primary or revision total hip arthroplasties performed in Denmark since January 1, 1995. The data are entered by the operating surgeon immediately after the procedure and include the indication for arthroplasty (primary osteoarthritis, fracture, avascular necrosis, or other indication) (Pedersen et al. 2004 ). The indication for arthroplasty has been confi rmed by medical chart review and radiographs in 79 of 80 randomly selected AVN patients (Pedersen et al. 2004 ). The Danish Central Offi ce of Civil Registration continuously monitors the vital status of Danish residents, including dates of emigration or death, and it issues a unique personal identifi cation number to everyone at birth or immigration. This number enables linkage of individual-level data between the NPR, the DHR, and the civil registration system (Pedersen et al. 2006) .",

We used stratifi ed Cox regression to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of total hip arthroplasty for AVN in cirrhosis patients as opposed to reference individuals and adjusted these HRs for potential confounders. We found no violations of the proportional hazards assumption when we tested it using Schoenfeld residuals and checked it by inspecting the log-log plot. We used the cumulative incidence function with death as a competing risk to compute the 5-year risk of total hip arthroplasty for AVN. This analysis relies on non-informative censoring. There were 2 censoring events in our study cohort: end of study (on December 31, 2011) and migration. Both of these events are unlikely predictors of the risk of a total hip arthroplasty for AVN, so the censoring in our study cohort was non-informative. Alcohol intake is a well-known risk factor for AVN, and cirrhosis patients have a high prevalence of alcohol intake. We were concerned that the regression analysis would leave residual confounding, so we performed a supplementary analysis in which we used restriction to minimize confounding by alcohol intake. We repeated the regression analysis and restricted it to cirrhosis patients with unspecifi ed cirrhosis (ICD-10: K74.6) who had not been hospitalized for an alcohol-related disorder (see Supplementary data, Table 3 ), and the corresponding reference individuals. Reference individuals who had previously been hospitalized for an alcohol-related disorder were also left out of this analysis. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 12.1 and the R software package version 2.14 (R 2013).",

NPR diagnoses for cirrhosis have previously been validated with biopsy or clinical evaluation as the gold standard. Cirrhosis was confi rmed in 85% of patients with this diagnosis in the NPR (Vestberg et al. 1997) , and the bias introduced by misclassifying individuals without cirrhosis as cirrhosis patients, or vice versa, would cause us to underestimate the true strength of the association between cirrhosis and AVN. The indication for hip arthroplasty in the DHR has been validated, showing that the positive predictive value for AVN was 99% (Pedersen et al. 2004 ). Still, it is possible that orthopedic surgeons are reluctant to perform arthroplasties in patients with cirrhosis, who have a high risk of postoperative complications (Deleuran et al. 2014 ). However, such a bias would cause us to underestimate the risk of Hung et al. (2011) found an HR for AVN of 2.5 in a cohort of patients with cirrhosis (primarily due to viral hepatitis) relative to an age-matched cohort of hospitalized patients without cirrhosis. These hospitalized patients without cirrhosis had a high prevalence of conditions that predispose to AVN, but the reported associations were only adjusted for conditions recorded at the index hospitalization. Such incomplete recording of confounders may have resulted in residual confounding, which would have caused Hung et al. to underestimate the true strength of the association.",

            "text": "The mechanisms behind the association between cirrhosis and AVN are unclear. Cirrhosis patients suffer from coagulopathy, endothelial dysfunction, and chronic infl ammation (Albillos et al. 2014 , Iwakiri and Groszmann 2007 , S\u00f8gaard et al. 2009 ). Endothelial dysfunction has been linked to glucocorticoid-induced AVN (Chen et al. 2013), but chronic infl ammation may be more important for development of AVN (Morse et al. 2013 ). Interleukin-33, a T-lymphocyte activator, has been linked to both cirrhosis and AVN (Marvie et al. 2010 , Zheng et al. 2014 , and cirrhosis patients' hyperdynamic circulation facilitates diffusion of proinfl ammatory cytokines and endotoxins throughout the body (Lee et al. 1996) . Hence, even though the exact mechanisms remain unclear, the pathophysi- total hip arthroplasty for AVN and also the strength of the association between cirrhosis and total hip arthroplasty for AVN. Thus, bias is unlikely to explain the strong association between cirrhosis and AVN. Incomplete confounder control could possibly have led us to overestimate the effect of cirrhosis on the rate of total arthroplasty for AVN. We were able to adjust for conditions that predispose to AVN and for indicators of smoking and treatment with corticosteroids, but our use of hospital diagnoses to identify confounders would probably underestimate their prevalence. Our results were unaltered when we performed a supplementary analysis aimed at minimizing the effect of alcohol intake. Still, we cannot rule out the possibility that some of the association was caused by alcohol intake and other confounders, but we believe that it is unlikely that the strong association was entirely the result of confounding.",
