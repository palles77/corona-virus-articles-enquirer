We report the clinical, virological and serological findings in dogs experimentally infected with strain CB/05. The dogs, three 2.5-month-old and two 6-month-old pups, were successfully infected, shedding viral RNA with their faeces for the entire observation period (21 days) and displaying systemic clinical signs resembling those observed during the course of natural infection. Leucopenia (acute lymphopenia) occurred in all infected dogs, with values dropping below 60% of the initial counts. Considering the severity of the CB/05-induced disease, two of the youngest pups were euthanized for ethical reasons at days 8-9 postinfection, whereas the other pups underwent a slow but progressive improvement of their clinical status with complete recovery. At postmortem examination, remarkable lesions were observed in the internal organs of the euthanized pups, that tested positive for CCoV by real-time RT-PCR and virus isolation on cell cultures. All pups seroconverted for CCoV, as shown by the high optical density values and antibody titres detected by ELISA and virusneutralisation tests, respectively. The present study confirms that strain CB/05 is highly pathogenic for dogs, being able to induce a severe disease (and in some cases the death) even in experimental conditions. #",

Two CCoV genotypes have been identified so far, namely CCoV type I and CCoV type II, which are responsible for the occurrence enteritis in dogs and are frequently associated in mixed infections Decaro et al., 2005c) . Although its tropism is restricted to the gastroenteric tract, CCoV has been recently associated to systemic disease followed by fatal outcome in pups . Severe clinical signs were observed in the affected pups, whereas necropsy examination revealed remarkable gross lesions in lungs, liver, spleen and kidneys. Virological and bacteriological investigations failed to detect common canine pathogens. Unexpectedly, CCoV type II RNA was detected at very high titres in the internal organs of the dead pups and the virus (strain CB/05) was isolated on canine cell cultures. The association of strain CB/05 to a severe, sometimes fatal disease of dogs, together with the isolation of the virus from organs with severe lesions, strongly suggests that CCoV has changed its tropism, acquiring the ability to spread from the enteric tract to the internal organs (Decaro et al., 2007b) .",

Considering that dogs infected naturally were all between 45 and 56 days of age, it could be hypothesised that the age of the infected animals plays a role in determining the fate of CB/05 infection, with a very severe clinical course in the youngest pups.",

Despite the drop of the WBC counts registered in all infected dogs and the detection of the viral RNA in the internal organs of the sacrificed dogs, free or cell-associated CCoV RNAemia was not found at any time either in euthanized or survived dogs, with the exception of the recovered 2.5-month-old pup which showed very low RNA viral titres in the plasma between days 7 and 10 p.i. Thus, at this moment, the mechanisms of lymphopenia and viral spread to internal organs remained unknown. Albeit strange, our findings are compatible with those obtained from cats experimentally infected with feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). Cats succumbed to FIPV display very high-viral titres in the haemolymphatic tissues (Kipar et al., 2006) , in contrast with the low loads detected in the blood (de Groot-Mijnes et al., 2005) . In our study, CB/05-infected dogs were found to contain lower viral loads in the lymphoid tissues in comparison to FIPV-infected cats, thus likely accounting for the undetected viral RNAemia in euthanized dogs.",
