Eighty healthy male SPF mice aged 6 weeks were selected and 20 mice were randomly selected as the blank group. The blank group did not receive any intervention. Mortality rates of each group were recorded and compared on day 8 of modeling, and heart specimens from the remaining mice were histopathologically examined and the expression of mRNA and protein of TNF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b21 in myocardial tissues were detected by western blot analysis. Correlation between mouse myocardial histopathologic scores and expression of protein of TNF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b21 in myocardial tissues, as well as the expression of TNF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b21 in myocardial tissue in VMC mice was analyzed. The expression levels of myocardial histopathological scores, mRNA and protein of TNF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b21 in the blank and control group were significantly lower than those in the VMC and the MG-132 group. The myocardial histopathological scores, mRNA and TNF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b21 protein in the MG-132 group were significantly lower than those in the VMC group (P<0.05). The expression of TNF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b21 protein in myocardial tissues was positively correlated with the pathological score in myocardial tissue of mice (r=0.843, P<0.05; r=0.763, P<0.05), and there was a positive correlation between the expression of TNF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b21 protein in myocardial tissues of VMC mice (r= 0.672, P<0.05). UPS inhibitor MG-132, which can significantly alleviate the myocardial injury of VMC mice, reduced the expression of inflammatory factors in myocardial tissues, and improved the survival rate of mice, thus it is a potential new treatment for VMC.",

            "text": "Viral myocarditis (VMC), as one of the most common cardiac infectious diseases, is mainly caused by myocardial cells infected with the virus, causing localized or diffuse inflammation of the myocardium. The virus causes direct damage to the myocardial cells and stimulates the immune response, thus causing sustained damage to the myocardial tissues (1, 2) . Coxsackie B3 virus (CVB3) is the most important virus that causes myocarditis. CVB3 can induce oxidative stress response and apoptosis in a few weeks in the pathogenesis of VMC, resulting in arrhythmia, myocardial failure and may eventually lead to sudden death, but special treatment of VMC has not been found as yet (3, 4) . Ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), as an important ATP-dependent protein control system in eukaryotic cells, not only participates in physiological processes such as apoptosis, inflammatory response and intracellular signaling, but also plays an important role in maintaining cell homeostasis (5) (6) (7) . In recent years, studies have found that UPS not only plays an important role in the inflammatory response of various diseases, but also plays a key role in the occurrence and development of various viral infectious diseases (8, 9) . As an aldehyde peptide proteasome inhibitor that can inhibit the activity of chyme protein, MG-132 also has a protective effect on the occurrence of inflammatory reactions in many diseases (10) . As a cytokine with a variety of biological effects produced by macrophages, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) has been shown to play an important role in the inflammatory response of VMC (11) . However, transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) is an initiating factor synthesized from the extracellular matrix of collagen fibers, and it is also one of the many factors leading to the occurrence of viral myocarditis (11) .",

Specifically, through UPS, viruses can replicate and lead to oxidative stress in host cells and eventually cause cell damage (15) (16) (17) . For example, studies (18) have found that the normal UPS pathway is involved in the replication of vaccinia virus. However, there are few studies on UPS in VMC, and no detailed description of its mechanism has been made. In our study, the effects of UPS inhibitor MG-132 intervention on myocardial cells, TNF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b21 in VMC mice were investigated. The results showed that the mortality of the VMC group was significantly higher than that of the blank group, control group and MG-132 group (P<0.05), suggesting VMC mice had higher mortality rates, but the mortality of VMC mice can be significantly reduced after the intervention of UPS inhibitor MG-132. In addition, the expression levels of myocardial histopathological scores, mRNA and protein of TNF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b21 in the blank group and the control group were significantly lower than those in the VMC group and the MG-132 group, and the myocardial histopathological scores, mRNA and protein of TNF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b21 in the MG-132 group were significantly lower than those in the VMC group (P<0.05). This suggests that the intervention of UPS inhibitor MG-132 can effectively improve the inflammatory infiltration in myocardial tissues of VMC mice and reduce the expression levels of inflammatory factors in myocardial tissues. UPS plays an important role in inflammatory response. For example, a previous study (19) found that UPS was involved in the response injury of hepatitis B coronavirus to a certain extent and could effectively alleviate the occurrence of inflammatory response.",

Although these studies did not directly confirm our conclusions, they can also show that the intervention of UPS inhibitor MG-132 does have a certain alleviating effect on the inflammatory response. Therefore, previous studies (21) suggested that inhibition of the process of heart failure by UPS inhibitors may be achieved by reducing oxidative stress. However, some studies (22) have obtained different results when different UPS inhibitors were applied in the intervention of ischemic cardiomyopathy, and the reason is not clear at present. We speculate that it may be because UPS inhibitors are involved in different molecular reactions, so they have different effects on inflammatory reactions or oxidative stress reactions. Finally, we analyzed the correlation between the pathological score in myocardial tissues of mice and the protein expression levels of TNF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b21 in myocardial tissues, as well as the protein expression levels between TNF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b21 in myocardial tissues of VMC mice. The results showed that the expression levels of TNF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b21 proteins in myocardial tissues were positively correlated with the pathological score in myocardial tissues of mice, and the expression levels of TNF-\u03b1 protein and TGF-\u03b21 protein in myocardial tissues of VMC mice were also positively correlated. Previous studies (23) have shown that the regulation of TGF-\u03b2 can effectively stimulate the release of TNF-\u03b1 in human monocytes. Although it is not a study of the myocardial tissues, it also confirms our conclusion.",
