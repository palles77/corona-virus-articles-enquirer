The presence of noroviruses in diarrheic stool samples from calves on Michigan and Wisconsin dairy farms was investigated by RT-PCR. Norovirus-positive samples were found on all eight farms studied in Michigan and on 2 out of 14 farms in Wisconsin. Phylogenetic analyses of partial polymerase and capsid sequences, derived for a subset of these bovine noroviruses, showed that these strains formed a group which is genetically distinct from the human noroviruses, but more closely related to genogroup I than to genogroup II human noroviruses. Examination of 2 full and 10 additional partial capsid (ORF2) sequences of these bovine strains revealed the presence of two genetic subgroups or clusters of bovine noroviruses circulating on Michigan and Wisconsin farms. One subgroup is \"Jena-like\", the other \"Newbury agent-2-like\".",

These agents belong to the Norovirus genus, one of the four genera in the Caliciviridae family, the other three being Sapovirus (formerly, Sapporo-like viruses), Vesivirus and Lagovirus (Green et al., 2000a) . Human noroviruses are a genetically heterogeneous group of viruses currently classified into two genogroups: genogroup I (GGI) and genogroup II (GGII) Green et al., 1994; Wang et al., 1994) . In the late 1970s, and throughout the 1980s, calici-like viruses with norovirus morphology were observed in diarrheic feces of newborn calves in Germany and the United Kingdom (Bridger et al., 1984; Wood and Bridger, 1978; G\u00fcnther and Otto, 1987) . Sequencing showed that the bovine noroviruses Jena and Newbury agent-2 are closely related to GGI human noroviruses (Liu et al., 1999; Dastjerdi et al., 1999) and that porcine noroviruses are closely related to GGII human noroviruses (Sugieda et al., 1998; Sugieda and Nakajima, 2002) . Studies in the Netherlands further confirmed this genetic relationship between animal and human noroviruses (van der Poel et al., 2000) . These findings raised the possibility that animals may be a reservoir for human noroviruses.",

(2000) , based on comparison of the Jena and Newbury agent-2 sequences to corresponding sequences of human norovirus strains. Oliver et al. (2003) recently reported on the characterization of a number of bovine enteric caliciviruses from the UK and found that these strains definitely comprise a third genogroup of noroviruses distinct from the two human genogroups. Using three sets of primer pairs routinely used for the detection of noroviruses in human diarrheic feces, the authors did not identify any human strains from cattle specimens. This finding made them suggest that the bovine noroviruses circulating in the UK are unlikely to be pathogenic to humans. Most recently, Smiley et al. (2003) reported the identification of bovine noroviruses in Ohio veal calf herds. The Ohio strains were found to be genetically more related to Jena and Newbury agent-2 than to human noroviruses, supporting previous findings that bovine noroviruses fall into a third genogroup within the norovirus genus. In addition to the bovine norovirus strains, these authors also found NB-like bovine enteric caliciviruses in some of the calf specimens examined. The NB strain, originally identified in diarrheic feces from a dairy calf in Nebraska, was recently characterized and shown to be a novel enteropathogenic bovine calicivirus, genetically most similar to lagoviruses and sapoviruses (Smiley et al., 2002) .",

A modified RT-PCR protocol for detecting human noroviruses, obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Dr. Stephan Monroe, CDC, Atlanta, GA, personal communication), was used for the initial detection of norovirus RNA. The assay makes use of a degenerate primer pair (MON 432: 5 -TGGACICGYGGICCYAAYCA-3 ; MON 477: 5 -AAAICGCATCCAIGCAAACAT-3 ) targeting a 213-nucleotide region at the 3 end of the norovirus RNA polymerase gene (Region B) (Anderson et al., 2003) . This region corresponds to nucleotides 5093-5305 in the Norwalk virus genome (GenBank accession number M87661), and nucleotides 4786-4998 in the Jena virus genome (Gen-Bank accession number AJ011099). The RT-PCR assay was performed in a 50 l reaction volume, using 25 l Mas-terAmp 2X PCR Premix G (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI), 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2% Triton X-100, 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.6 M MON 432, 0.6 M MON 477, 20 U of RNase Inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN), 2.7 U of avian myeloblastosis virus super reverse transcriptase (Molecular Genetic Resources, Tampa, FL), and 1.25 U of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin Elmer Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA).

The determination of extended sequence data was done to determine the genome organization of the strains. Strain B-1SVD was the first bovine norovirus identified in this study. A second strain, 11MSU-MW, was chosen for further sequencing, based on its maximum divergence from B-1SVD within the previously analyzed partial polymerase region. Complementary DNA was synthesized from 3 l of fecal RNA template with the oligo(dT)-containing adapter primer provided in the kit, according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. The gene-specific primer (GSP) used for PCR amplification of the target cDNA was the diagnostic forward primer, 5 -GGGCCTAATCACGATGACC-3 , mentioned above. The abridged universal amplification primer (AUAP) provided in the kit was used as reverse primer. PCR was carried out with the QIAGEN HotStar Taq DNA Polymerase Kit, using 2 l of cDNA template, 0.5 M of the GSP, 2 l of AUAP and the following cycling conditions: pre-denaturation at 95 \u2022 C for 15 min, followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 94 \u2022 C for 1 min, annealing at 55 \u2022 C for 1 min, and extension at 72 \u2022 C for 4 min, with a final extension of 72 \u2022 C for 10 min.

BLAST analyses showed that the entire ORF2 and ORF3 sequences obtained from these two strains corresponded to calicivirus capsid and small protein sequences. For both strains, the start codon of ORF2 overlaps the 3 end of ORF1 by 14 nucleotides, the sequence of which is 100% conserved between the two strains (5 -AUGAAGAUGACUGA-3 ). This sequence overlap between ORF1 and ORF2 is also conserved in Jena and in the UK bovine norovirus strains reported in the GenBank database. Genome organizations observed for B-1SVD and 11MSU-MW were consistent with those of strains classified under the genus norovirus. ORF2 is 1560 and 1569 nucleotides long for B-1SVD and 11MSU-MW, respectively. The sequences translate into 519 amino acids for the former, and 522 amino acids for the latter. Results of pairwise sequence analyses showed these two Michigan bovine noroviruses sharing only 61.2% nucleotide and 67.4% amino acid sequence identities. Based upon a protein BLAST search, strain B-1SVD was found to be most closely related to the Jena strain, sharing with it an amino acid sequence identity of 94.2%.

Strains 2086MR and 3505DD, originating from different farms, were identical at the nucleotide level. This group of five Michigan strains shared an amino acid sequence identity of 91.9% with the German strain, Jena. The second group includes six Michigan strains (11MSU-MW, 1GM, 21MSU-MW, 17-19MSU-MW, 32MSU-MW and 2387108MI) and one Wisconsin strain (803484WI). Strains with initials, \"MSU-MW\", were from the same dairy farm. This group of seven strains shared amino acid identities with one another of 92.7-99.2% and average identities of 94.5% with the Dutch strains and 95.5% with the UK strains. Amino acid identities between the two groups range from only 56.3 to 57.1%. An alignment of the partial capsid sequences (deduced amino acid sequences) of the Michigan/Wisconsin strains and their counterparts from Germany, the UK and the Netherlands, is shown in Fig. 3 . Each of the sequences derived for the first group (five Michigan strains), had a serine residue missing at position number 150, as is the case for Jena. The sequence alignment in Fig. 3 clearly distinguishes \"Jena-like\" sequences from \"Newbury agent-2-like\" sequences, as exemplified in the alignment of sequences of the entire capsid of Michigan strains B-1SVD and 11MSU-MW with Jena and Newbury agent-2 in Fig. 2 .",

The samples were initially screened with a modified RT-PCR protocol from CDC, which makes use of a degenerate primer pair for detecting human norovirus RNA polymerase gene sequences. Once bovine norovirus polymerase sequences were derived for eight positive samples, a specific set of primers was designed to screen all available samples. The prevalence of bovine noroviruses in Michigan was high, with all eight farms and 80% of fecal samples examined testing positive. A high prevalence of bovine noroviruses in the field was similarly observed by researchers in the neighboring state of Ohio (Smiley et al., 2003) . In contrast, only 4 positive samples (from 4 farms) were found among the 14 Wisconsin samples (from 14 farms) assayed with either of the RT-PCR protocols. Based on this very limited data, it is not possible to reach a conclusion about the true prevalence rate of noroviruses in Wisconsin. It is very apparent though that more positive samples were detected using our diagnostic set of bovine norovirus-specific primers. However, the lack of an internal control to monitor potential inhibition of the PCR reaction does not rule out the possibility that the number of positives may have been underestimated.",

Within the two established human genogroups, GGI and GGII, strains can further be assigned to subgroups or clusters, depending upon the classification scheme used. The CDC has outlined a classification based on ORF2 sequences, in which GGI and GGII consisted of 5 and 10 genetic clusters, respectively . Seven phylogenetic groups in GGI and at least five phylogenetic groups in GGII were identified by Vinje et al. (2000) , based on greater than 80% nucleotide identity in the N-terminus of the capsid protein. Green et al. (2000b) suggested seven genomic subgroups within GGI and eight in GGII when sequences of either the N-terminus or the central variable region of the capsid were analyzed. To date, little is known about the sequence diversity of bovine noroviruses. Ando et al. (2000) predicted two putative clusters within GGIII, represented by Jena and Newbury agent-2, respectively, based on the analysis of a 349 nucleotide region at the 5 end of ORF2. Since then, more bovine norovirus capsid gene sequences have been submitted to the database. This allowed us to broaden the analysis of sequence diversity within the capsid region. Our findings demonstrate the existence of two genetic clusters/subgroups within the group we examined. One is more \"Jena-like\", the other, more \"Newbury agent-2-like\", as predicted by Ando et al. (2000) . The Michigan strains are represented in either cluster, while the Wisconsin strain, along with the Dutch and other UK strains, all fall within the \"Newbury agent-2-like\" cluster.",

This region is useful for genetic diversity studies, as pointed out by Green et al. (2000b) and Vinje et al. (2000) . Moreover, it has been shown that clustering of norovirus strains based on capsid sequences correlates well with their antigenic grouping based on antigen and antibody ELISAs using expressed norovirus capsid proteins (Jiang et al., 1992; Kobayashi et al., 2000a,b; Katayama et al., 2002) . Smiley et al. (2003) observed the formation of two distinct clusters of Ohio bovine norovirus strains based on the analysis of the 3 terminal RNA polymerase gene segment (\u223c155 aa). One cluster was comprised of Jena and one Ohio strain. Another cluster was formed by four Newbury agent-2-like Ohio strains, two of which were previously characterized as being Newbury agent-2-like, based also on a partial segment of the RNA polymerase gene. In our study, the clustering of the Michigan/Wisconsin bovine norovirus strains into two distinct subgroups was not apparent when partial RNA polymerase-specific sequences were analyzed. Michigan strains B-1SVD, A-1SVD and 2086MR, which were determined \"Jena-like\" based on the analysis of capsid sequences, shared 84.2 and 94.7% amino acid similarities with Jena and Newbury agent-2, respectively, in the analyzed region of the RNA polymerase gene. The phylogenetic tree based on partial RNA polymerase sequences in Fig. 1 shows the Jena strain in a branch by itself, separated from the rest of the bovine strains in the GGIII cluster. In a phylogenetic study of 18 Norwalk-like viruses, Katayama et al. (2002) similarly observed that an RNA polymerase gene-based classification did not separate the strains into internal clusters within the genogroup. Although the RNA polymerase regions of noroviruses have been widely used for diagnostic purposes, results of genotyping within a genogroup based on sequences from these regions often do not correlate with those based upon capsid sequence data (Katayama et al., 2002) . It has also been suggested that strains with genotypes that differ between the polymerase and capsid regions may be naturally occurring genetic recombinants Katayama et al., 2002; Jiang et al., 1999) . A potential recombination site at the polymerase/capsid junction had already been identified in human norovirus strains (Jiang et al., 1999) . Sequencing the entire polymerase gene of the Jena-like Michigan strains observed in this study will determine whether any of the strains are actually genetic recombinants between Jena-like and Newbury agent-2-like caliciviruses.",

It is anticipated that more genetic clusters will be identified in the future, as the bank of molecularly characterized bovine norovirus strains further expands. New genogroups of both human and animal noroviruses may emerge and the natural occurrence of genetic recombination between genomes of two very different norovirus strains (Jiang et al., 1999) may even result in host-range shifts, possibly turning animals into reservoirs for human infection and vice versa.",
