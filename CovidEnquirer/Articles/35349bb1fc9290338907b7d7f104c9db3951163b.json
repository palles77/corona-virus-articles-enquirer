            "text": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) are standard of care for treatment of congestive heart failure, but aldosterone breakthrough occurs when ACEi are used in both dogs and humans. Entresto\u00ae, a combinational angiotensin-receptor blocker/neprilysin inhibitor, showed superiority in reducing mortality in human patients with heart failure compared to enalapril. Pharmacodynamics of Entresto\u00ae have been evaluated in healthy dogs, showing efficacy in altering the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) without causing adverse effects. The aim of this prospective, blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study was to compare the pharmacodynamic effects of Entresto\u00ae to placebo in dogs with preclinical myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) and to evaluate the safety profile of Entresto\u00ae in dogs with cardiac disease. Client-owned dogs weighing 4-15 kg with ACVIM Stage B2 MMVD were enrolled. Dogs with clinically significant pulmonary hypertension or systemic disease were excluded, as were dogs on any medication(s) known to alter the RAAS. All dogs received pimobendan throughout the study period. Each patient was evaluated at three time points (Day 0, Day 7, and Day 30). Echocardiography, thoracic radiographs (CXR), Doppler systemic arterial pressure (SAP), complete blood count, serum biochemical profile, plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) concentration, and urinary aldosterone to creatinine ratio (UAldo:C) were evaluated on Day 0. On Day 0, each dog was randomly allocated to a treatment group (Entresto\u00ae; 20 mg/kg BID) or a placebo group by the attending pharmacist. Investigators, veterinary technicians, and owners were blinded to treatment. Serum renal enzyme and electrolyte concentrations and SAP were rechecked on Day 7. Echocardiography, CXR, SAP, renal panel, plasma NT-proBNP concentration, and UAldo:C were rechecked on Day 30. Thirteen dogs were recruited: Entresto\u00ae (n = 7) and placebo (n = 6). The median percent increase in UAldo:C between Day 0 and Day 30 was significantly lower in the Entresto\u00ae group (12%; P = 0.032) as compared to the placebo group (195%). The median percent decrease of NT-proBNP concentration from Day 0 to Day 30 was not statistically different between groups (P = 0.68). No statistical differences were seen in echocardiographic, CXR, SAP, or biochemical profiles measured at any time point between groups. No adverse events were noted by the owners for dogs in either group. This study suggests that Entresto\u00ae efficiently inhibits RAAS in dogs with cardiomegaly secondary to MMVD in comparison to placebo. Entresto\u00ae is safe in regards to SAP and renal enzyme and electrolyte concentrations. No adverse effects were noted in any dog taking Entresto\u00ae. Future studies comparing Entresto\u00ae to ACEi, evaluating the concomitant use of diuretics and Entresto\u00ae, and evaluating longterm (> 30 days) effects of Entresto\u00ae are warranted. Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), the oxidized product of trimethylamine, is produced by gastrointestinal microbiota from certain dietary nutrients including choline and L-carnitine. Elevated plasma concentrations of TMAO, choline, and L-carnitine have been shown to be associated with the presence and severity of cardiovascular disease in people and are independent predictors of adverse cardiac events and mortality. This prospective study investigated whether there are differences in concentrations of circulating TMAO, choline, or L-carnitine in dogs with degenerative mitral valve disease (DMVD) compared to healthy controls (Controls).",

Obesity is the most common nutritional disease in cats and is increasing in prevalence. Excess body fat predisposes the animal to deleterious effects on heart function and systolic blood pressure (SBP) alterations, arrhythmias and radiographic and echocardiographic changes have been described. However, there is not much information regarding the effects of obesity on the cardiovascular system of cats. This study aims to evaluate these effects on cardiovascular system of domestic cats and compare them with cats with normal body conditions. Thirty-six cats were allocated in two groups (20 obese cats and 20 cats with normal body condition) and submitted to SBP measurement; electrocardiogram (ECG); and chest radiograph to evaluate the cardiac silhouette by vertebral heart size (VHS). The echocardiographic measurements were evaluated, establishing a relationship between the data obtained and Body Weight, Body Condition Score (BCS) and Body Mass Index (BMI). SBP and VHS were statistically higher in obese animals in contrast to normal cats. In obese cats, the mean SBP was 148.5 \u00b1 29. 6 Weight. A quadratic relationship was also observed between left atrial-to-aortic root diameter ratio (LA:Ao) and Body Weight. In addition, the relationship between LVFWd and BMI, although not considered significant, presented P values slightly above 0.05. Obese cats showed higher BPS and VHS than normal cats, which led to an increase in echocardiographic measurements. This study has shown that obesity promoted cardiac function impairment in the studied cats and, therefore, that it is important to monitor these animals since even asymptomatic ones may present changes in cardiac parameters. The study aims at measuring heart rate variability in Holstein cows, fetuses and neonates through a descriptive evaluation of continuous fetomaternal and neonatal electrocardiogram recordings during the perinatal period. Heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) were assessed by fetomaternal electrocardiography (ECG). Fetomaternal measurements were taken six times pre-partum and in neonates six times after calving. Heart rate, time-domain variables and frequencydomain variables were analyzed in 23 Holstein cows and 18 neonates.",

The equine maternal pheromone (EMP) has been used as a tool to calm equines facing new or stressful situations, which forces physiological adaptations and alterations related mainly to increases in heartrate (HR) and behavioral alterations. This study aims at assessing the effects of EMP treatment in colts undergoing hoof trimming for the first time, employing the behavior of heartrate variability (HRV) as the main parameter. We assessed 20 colts with average age of 9 months that underwent hoof trimming for the first time.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common endocrinopathy in dogs and its impact on the cardiovascular system is still unclear in this species. In human medicine, serum fructosamine concentration (SFC) use as a cardiovascular prognostic is growing. The aim of this study was to evaluate correlations among systolic blood pressure (SBP), SFC, and insulin dose in use by diabetic dogs. A cross-sectional study was designed including diabetic dogs under treatment with NPH insulin (mean dose 0.62 U \u00b1 0.24 U/kg, range 0.25 to 1.2 U/kg) for a period of 2 to 60 months (25.6 \u00b1 17.8 months). The patients were assessed by Doppler vascular method to verify SBP in agreement with ACVIM guidelines. SFC were measurement by a colorimetric assay. Eighteen diabetic dogs (10.6 \u00b1 2.9; 10.8 \u00b1 8.1 kg) and twelve healthy control dogs (10.4 \u00b1 3.1 years; 13.0 \u00b1 9.4 kg) paired by breed, sex and age were included. There was a significantly positive correlation between SBP and SFC in diabetic dogs (r = 0.54; P < 0.05) as well as in control dogs (r = 0.57; P < 0.01). Insulin dose and SBP correlation only approach significance (r = 0.41; P = 0.08). Also, there was no correlation between time of diagnosis and SBP (r = 0.17; P = 0.47). Our findings suggests that there is association between SFC and hypertension in dogs. This results emphasize the importance of the SBP monitoring in diabetic dogs, and suggests that insulin dose may be a more important factor than the time of diagnosis as a risk factor for hypertension in canine diabetic patients. Amiodarone is predominantly a class III anti-arrhythmic drug that also blocks sodium channels, and calcium channels, and beta2-adrenergic receptors. It is commonly used for the treatment of tachyarrhythmias, most notably ventricular tachyarrhythmias. As a lipophilic, iodinated benzofuran-derivative medication, amiodarone has unique pharmacological and structural properties that not only distinguish it from other anti-arrhythmics, but warrants careful surveillance of certain metabolic processes. Its composition can lead to the inhibition of 5 0deiodinase activity, resulting in a decrease in Triiodothyronine (T3) production. Amiodarone and its main metabolite, desethylamiodarone may also block T3 binding to its respective receptor. Amiodarone induced thyroid dysfunction has been documented in people. We aimed to determine if amiodarone alters thyroid function in dogs treated for significant tachyarrhythmia.",

Sildenafil was administered to dogs with residual PH if severe right-side heart overload (flattening of ventricular septum) and/or clinical signs (exercise intolerance, cyanosis) were observed. Median TR was 3.4 m/s (range 3.1-4.4 m/s) at preoperative examination. There were no deaths due to residual PH until 3 months after surgery. PH was improved in 9 (45%) patients at 3 months. TR disappeared in 4 patients and TR velocity was decreased in 5 (median 2.5 m/s; range 2.1-2.9 m/s). Eleven (55%) patients exhibited residual PH. Median TR was 3.3 m/s (range 3.0-3.7 m/s).

Our results suggest that MVP is an effective treatment for dogs with PH secondary to mitral valve disease. Further study is needed to clarify long-term prognosis and treatment of patients that exhibit residual PH after surgery. Detection of equine kidney injury in initial stages, when intervention is likely to be most successful, is hindered by limited markers of early renal damage in horses. N-acetyl-\u03b2-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), a lysosomal enzyme in renal tubular cells that is released into urine during tubular insult, has shown promise for early identification of acute kidney injury in humans and other species. The aims of this study were to validate an assay for urinary NAG (uNAG) in horses and to correlate uNAG index with other markers of renal tubular dysfunction. An enzymatic assay was validated using coefficients of variation (CV), spike and recovery, and linearity of dilution. Urine and plasma were collected from 7 nonazotemic and 7 azotemic horses. Spearman rank correlation and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to compare uNAG index with plasma creatinine, urinary fractional excretion of sodium (FE Na ), and urinary gamma-glutamyltransferase (uGGT) index.",

Median uNAG indices were significantly higher (p-value < 0.05) in azotemic horses, in horses with increased FE Na , and in horses with increased uGGT index. Urinary NAG can be measured in horses and shows correlation with current biomarkers of renal dysfunction. Additional work is needed to determine the timing of increase in uNAG index relative to onset of kidney injury in horses and to evaluate clinical utility in equine patients. Twenty-eight cases were identified. Prevalence of UTI in our equine cases was 0.13% between 2009 and 2016. Trakehner and Holsteiner horses were significantly overrepresented compared to the hospital population (p < 0.05) and UTI were more frequent in females (p < 0.05).

Following 1 hour of fasting, a bolus of dextrose (300 or 500 mg/kg) was administered orally or intravenously. Blood incretin and insulin concentrations were measured at 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 In foals allowed to nurse, incretin concentrations increased above baseline within 15 minutes of nursing. Minimal incretin response with oral dextrose but rapid incretin release after nursing indicates that 500 mg/kg was insufficient for a strong EIA stimulation, that higher dextrose dosing is required, or that factors in milk may be important to activate the EIA in newborn foals. The aim of this study was to determine if hyperinsulinaemia could be reduced and laminitis prevented in insulin-dysregulated ponies, by using the sodium-glucose co-transport 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor velagliflozin. Forty-nine ponies with varying degrees of insulin dysregulation, based on an oral glucose test (1 g dextrose/kg BW), received either velagliflozin (0.3 mg/kg, p.o., s.i.d., n = 12), or a placebo (n = 37), throughout the study. A maintenance diet of lucerne hay was fed for 3 weeks, followed by a high-NSC challenge diet (12 g NSC/kg BW/day) for up to 18 days. On the second day of the diet challenge blood glucose and serum insulin were measured over 4 h after feeding. Results are expressed as geometric mean (95% CI). The maximum concentration of glucose was lower (P = 0.022) for the velagliflozin group at 9.4 mM (8.0 -11.0) versus 11.9 mM (10. 5 -13.4) Oral glucose tests (OGT) are currently recommended for diagnosis of insulin dysregulation (ID). As horses suffering from ID are prone to laminitis especially when exposed to high amounts of sugar it would be desirable to reduce the amount of diagnostic glucose. Furthermore, a reduced glucose amount enables various routes of application.",

Repeatability was assessed using Bland-Altman Plots. Significant differences were not noted between KLCS and FCS for either AUC or peak concentrations. However, when insulin results were compared to the ID positive insulin cut off, tests with fructose correctly identified horses with ID only 8 of 14 times; OSTs without fructose identified ID in 12 of the 14 tests. Based on this, fructose does not have a substantial impact on glucose metabolism in horses, but may interfere with insulin responses during an OST. Vitamin E is essential for neuromuscular function. Oral supplementation with natural (\"RRR\") \u03b1-tocopherol has been the mainstay of therapy in horses with hypovitaminosis E. However, there is a subset of non-responsive horses. The objectives of this pilot trial were to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an injectable RRR-\u03b1-tocopherol preparation delivered subcutaneously. We hypothesized that RRR\u03b1-tocopherol injection would increase serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) \u03b1-tocopherol concentrations in healthy adult horses. Six mixed breed horses (3 mares and 3 geldings) and two untreated horses (1 mare and 1 gelding) were enrolled. In Phase I, horses were randomly assigned to receive RRR-\u03b1-tocopherol (5000 IU/450kg of 600 IU/mL) by subcutaneous (n=3) or oral (n=3) administration. Moderate tissue reaction following injection necessitated adjustment of the preparation through reduction of the RRR-\u03b1-tocopherol concentration to 500 IU/mL. Following an 8-week washout period, horses received the reciprocal treatment in Phase II with the new preparation at an equivalent dose. Alpha-tocopherol concentrations of serum and CSF collected over a 7d period were determined by HPLC. There was no difference in baseline serum (P=0.07) or CSF (P=0.20) concentrations and no residual effect noted, indicating appropriate washout. Serum (P < 0.0001) and CSF (P=0.0.007) \u03b1-tocopherol concentrations increased significantly post-injection only when the 500 IU/mL product was administered, with serum concentrations peaking at 24h post-injection. This injectable formulation may therefore be useful in cases refractory to oral supplementation. However, caution is warranted due to the marked local tissue reaction observed in all horses. Hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia are associated with various diseases in equids. Despite the interactions between these analytes and energy metabolism, evaluation of their concentrations in critically ill equids with lipid disorders is not frequently performed; therefore, the incidence of these abnormalities in these patients remains unclear. Medical records from 54 hospitalized small equids [ponies (multiple breeds), American Miniature Horses, and donkeys] greater than 2 years of age with serum triglyceride concentrations greater than 200 mg/dL admitted between 2002-2017 were reviewed, and relationships between biochemical analytes were assessed (Chi-square analysis).",

Key genes involved in the transport of calcium (Ca 2+ ) across the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) encode proteins such as the ryanodine receptor (RYR), which releases Ca 2+ from the SR, and SR calcium ATPase (SERCA), which pumps Ca 2+ back into the SR. Newly discovered regulatory micropeptides such as MRLN, PLN and SLN inhibit SERCA, thereby controlling intracellular Ca 2+ and contractility. The transcript expression or protein abundance of these micropeptides in horses is unknown. The purpose of this study is to determine the relative expression of equine Ca 2+ regulatory genes in left ventricle, right atrium, and gluteal muscle. RNA was extracted from tissues collected from 7 horses and reverse transcribed into cDNA. Transcript abundance was quantified using qRT-PCR and data normalized to GAPDH (within sample).

Progesterone is mainly known for its role in pregnancy; however, it is also a precursor to adrenocortical and neuroactive steroids and likely plays important functions in equine neonates. Human studies have demonstrated that progesterone modulates immunity and predisposes to inflammatory conditions. However, the mechanisms by which progesterone influences outcomes in sick foals remain unclear. The goal of our study was to measure blood concentrations of inflammatory cytokines and serum amyloid A (SAA) in healthy and hospitalized foals, and to determine their association with progesterone, severity of disease, and mortality. We hypothesized that hospitalized foals will have higher progesterone, 17 \u03b1 -hydroxyprogesterone and cortisol concentrations that will be associated with the inflammatory response, disease severity and mortality. Foals (n = 62) were divided into three groups based on severity of disease (septic [n = 31], sick non-septic [SNS; n = 21], and healthy [n = 10]), and hospitalized foals (SNS and septic) were divided into two groups based on survival (survivors and non-survivors).

The prognosis for dogs with any of these tumor types is generally guarded to poor. The median survival time regardless of treatment type is approximately 230 days. Due to numerous challenges associated with diagnosing, grading, treating, and reporting survival outcomes, there is currently no gold standard therapy for these tumors in dogs. Additionally, the similarities between canine and human primary intraparenchymal brain tumors lend translational opportunity to the development of novel treatment delivery systems for canine brain tumors. Glial tumors invade and migrate along white matter tracts and blood vessels, which is a characteristic that can be exploited.

This is the first stage in a large clinical trial that ultimately aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of nanofiber catheters in the treatment of canine brain tumors. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive, safe and painless procedure that is applied in humans to modify the activity of specific neural circuits of the brain. Via electromagnetic induction, a magnetic field generator produces small electric currents on cortical neurons in order to affect neuronal function.

Intraobserver agreement has been previously shown to be good to excellent; however, interobserver agreement has not been previously reported and is vital to the use of this technique in multicenter veterinary clinical trials in neuropathic pain. The goal of this study was to evaluate the interobserver agreement of sensory thresholds obtained using electronic VFA in a group of normal small breed dogs. No statistical difference between MTR and FA was noted between groups. AD and MD were significantly lower in dogs that did not recover. Findings support that quantitative imaging surrogates of axonal integrity may be important prognostic indicators in dogs with SCI. Despite studies demonstrating that lower doses of toceranib (2.4 -2.9 mg/kg every other day) provides drug exposure sufficient for target inhibition while reducing the frequency of drug-related adverse events, gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity continues to be the most commonly encountered side effect in dogs receiving toceranib at this dose. The degree of toxicity is variable among individual dogs and currently there are no clinical or molecular markers to identify those dogs that would benefit from the use of concomitant medications to prevent GI toxicities. This is critical as the development of GI toxicity significantly impacts patient morbidity and quality of life, decreases treatment intensity, increases the cost of treatment, and leads to discontinuation of therapy.

In conclusion, diabetic cats have erythrocytes with increased protein oxidation byproducts and reduced antioxidant capacity, suggesting increased oxidative stress. Because oxidative status was not ameliorated by treatment, it is possible that oxidative stress is persistent or needs longer treatment duration to decrease. The reason behind reduced TBAR in diabetic cats remains elusive. Lastly, oxidative status is not different between cats with and without remission.

Metabolomic alterations may give insight into the pathogenesis of canine diabetes. Future studies to confirm these findings and develop targeted assays to detect metabolites that may be used as biomarkers of canine diabetes are warranted. Some studies had shown serum cortisol concentration increases, and corticotropic hyperplasia due to environmental stressful agents. This observation explains physiological effects caused by stress. Nevertheless, few studies have tried to correlate chronic exposure to stress with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity in dogs, and hyperadrenocorticism (HAC) development. The present work aimed to clarify whether dogs with pituitary-dependent HAC (PDH) were more exposed to stressful situations throughout their lives when compared to healthy animals. A 25-item questionnaire regarding temperament, socialization, social interaction, level of environmental enrichment and daily habits was developed. Owners of both recently diagnosed PDH and healthy dogs were invited to answer the questionnaire. Twenty newly diagnosed PDH dogs were included in the study. Subjects were matched with forty healthy dogs (control group) by sex, age, and breed (1:2 ratio). Exclusion criteria for the control group were: HAC suspicion, chronic glucocorticoid therapy, and glucocorticoid's exposure over the last month. Odds ratio estimates (OR) and 95% confident intervals (95% CI) were reported, and P-values less than, or equal to 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Dogs with HAC were more than ten times more exposed to neutering (OR = 11.4, 95%CI: 1,38 -94,06, P < 0,05). However, no other significantly correlation was found between social isolation, confinement, exposure to canned foods or plastic toys, phobias or separation anxiety, and HAC. Even variables under study considered potential stress relievers did not suggested any protective effect. These results emphasize neutering as a potential risk-factor to HAC development and instigate further studies on possible mechanism behind. is used to evaluate pancreatic endocrine function and predict which patients will become diabetic after pancreatectomy.

No dog had received antibiotic or corticosteroid treatment in the last two weeks prior to the collection of gastric biopsies. IHC was performed using antibodies directed against canine S100A12 (cS100A12) and Helicobacter spp., respectively. cS100A12 staining in the lamina propria was quantified and classified into absent, mild, moderate, or severe and Helicobacter density was graded using similar criteria. Histopathological evaluation was conducted following the World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) grading scheme. Spearman';s rank correlation was used to evaluate any possible associations between cS100A12 with Helicobacter density and histopathology findings. A Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare ordinal variables between healthy and sick dogs. Immunoglobulin (Ig)-binding to gut bacteria likely activates immune responses locally and systemically however it has never been investigated in dog IBD yet. Therefore, our study investigated whether the humoral immune response against commensal gut bacteria in IBD is greater than that of healthy dogs. Additionally, whether the Ig-binding bacteria potentially triggers an exacerbated immune response that aggravates gut homeostasis.",

The exact etiology behind this bleeding is unknown however several studies have postulated this may occur due to hyperfibrinolysis.

TEG has been performed previously in Greyhounds but no study has investigated fibrinolysis variables via TEG in the presence of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in healthy Greyhounds.

Results of these studies identify that a majority of normal and diseased dogs harbor a rich and diverse bile microbiome.

Tailoring bile culture media to routinely identify these bacteria is likely to improve our understanding and diagnosis of canine hepatobiliary disease.

Although tick preventives are available, vaccination is an increasingly common though controversial method used in the prevention of canine Lyme infection; reported efficacies of canine Lyme vaccines are highly variable, ranging from 50% to 100%.

Antimicrobial resistance genes and phenotypic resistance to cephalosporins were detected in several samples and are concerning for therapeutic choice and animal handling considerations. Further work to explore associations among virulence, antimicrobial resistance, and biofilm potential is underway to better understand UPEC presentation and pathogenesis in dogs. In dogs that were anesthetized with Propofol, serum levels of SDMA measured after anesthesia (15.95 \u00b1 4.03 \u03bcg/dL) were significantly higher than those measured before anesthesia (11.85 \u00b1 3.06 \u03bcg/dL, P < 0.01). Levels of sCr and BUN, traditional markers of renal function, also increased. Additionally, BUN and sCr levels were significantly and positively associated with SDMA levels (r = 0.23 and r = 0.42, respectively). In the Alphaxalone-treated dogs, the average serum level of SDMA before anesthesia was 12.15 \u00b1 1.79 \u03bcg/dL, which increased to 17.70 \u00b1 4.64 \u03bcg/dL after anesthesia, whereas smaller increases were detected in sCr and BUN.",

Taken together, these data suggest that serum SDMA concentration is likely to be a sensitive biomarker for kidney dysfunction. The present data shows that serum SDMA has a strong relationship with several parameters used in the evaluation of renal function, such as serum creatinine, serum phosphorus, serum BUN, hematocrit, UP/C, urinary density and reticulocytes. Serum SDMA had a weak relationship with BP. Serum SDMA increased prior to image alteration on kidney ultrasonography in 13.3% (3/30) of the dogs. Serum SDMA also increased in 15% (9/60) of dogs before values of serum creatinine were above 1.4mg / dl. The differences found in IRIS staging considering serum SDMA were: of the dogs in IRIS stage 2, 33.3% (2/6) had serum SDMA above 25\u03bcg / dl, so these dogs were reclassified from IRIS stage 2 to IRIS stage 3. Dogs in IRIS stage 3, 16.6% (1/6) had serum SDMA above 45\u03bcg / dl so this dog was reclassified from IRIS stage 3 to IRIS stage 4. So we conclude that serum SDMA is an important tool for the evaluation of renal function and should be used routinely in the evaluation of dogs infected with L. infantum.

Toxic products generated by dysbiosis may contribute to morbidity and progression of CKD.Indoxyl sulfate (IS) and p-cresol sulfate (pCS) are uremic toxins produced by colonic bacteria. The first study objective was to compare the fecal microbiome of healthy, older (> 8 years) cats (n = 11) and cats with stable CKD (IRIS stage 2-4) (n = 30). The second objective was to measure serum IS and pCS in healthy, older cats (n = 10) and compare to CKD cats (n = 28).",

However, when individual bacterial groups were analyzed based on LDA effect size (LEfSe) several bacterial taxa were identified as being significantly different among the groups. When comparing healthy cats to CKD cats, CKD cats had significantly decreased bacterial populations belonging to the genera Holdemania, Adlercreutzia, Eubacterium, Slackia, and Mogibacterium. No significant differences in the functional potential of the microbiota were found between CKD cats and healthy cats after correcting for multiple comparisons.

Surprisingly, the length of the bigger kidney cannot determine the prognosis. NGAL, a 25-kDa glycoprotein belonging to lipocalin superfamily, acts as promising renal biomarker for humans, dogs and cats. Urinary NGAL had been reported with 3 configurations, including monomer, dimer and the complex with matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in human and laboratory animals. It is recently characterized in canine and feline urinary disease in our research group. MMP-9 plays an important role in regulating the degradation of extracellular matrix in process such as angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastasis. Additionally it has been reported that MMP-9 involves in renal fibrosis in chronic kidney disease (CKD). In addition, HJV, the upstream modulator of hepcidin-ferroportin axis, has been identified as a novel renal biomarker of acute kidney injury (AKI) and CKD in human renal diseases. Interestingly, both HJV and NGAL serve as modulators of inflammation, MMP-9 is involved in the expression of NGAL, and association of NGAL prevents MMP-9 auto-degradation; hence it is possible that these proteins work cooperatively in the course of feline renal diseases. To resolve this unknown issue, we aimed to characterize the overall expression profile of three factors in cats with urinary diseases. In feline CKD, both NGAL and MMP-9 can represent the severity. Urinary NGAL and MMP-9 were significantly higher in CKD stage 3 and CKD stage 4 than that in the control group and CKD stage 2. However, urine MMP-9 may not be appropriate to indicate CKD progression. In CKD group and pyuria groups, both urinary NGAL and MMP-9 concentrations and their ratio to urinary creatinine had significant correlations (The Spearman correlation values were 0.64, 0.59, 0.57, and 0.61 in order). However, these correlations could not be identified in AKI group. Moreover, for detection of feline HJV, recombinant feline HJV was prepared for generation of antibody against feline HJV. At present, the expression of HJV was detected in feline urine with Western blot analysis. To quantify the concentration of HJV, development of an ELISA platform is in process.",

Since few ELISAs have been validated for feline urine, our objective was to evaluate feline-specific ELISA kits for quantification of IL-2, IL-6, and IL-12 in feline urine. Urine was collected from healthy cats evaluated at the Michigan State University Veterinary Medical Center. Normal urine samples were pooled, modified to mimic disease conditions by adding water or hemolyzed blood, and then spiked with high, medium, and low concentrations of recombinant cytokines. Concentrations of IL-2, IL-6, and IL-12 were determined using commercially available feline-specific ELISA kits. The influence of urine matrix variables on test performance was evaluated by spike/recovery tests, linearity testing, and assessment of inter-and intra-assay variation. All assays underestimated high and medium spiked cytokine concentrations in urine as compared to standard assay diluents. Low spiked cytokine concentrations in urine were inconsistently detected. Urine spiked with IL-2, IL-6 and IL-12 achieved maximal quantitative recoveries of 82%, 90%, and 58% respectively. High urine specific gravity contributed significantly to poor IL-2 and IL-12 recovery Feline idiopathic cystitis (FIC) is a common lower urinary tract disease in cats that resembles interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome in people. In both conditions the pathogenesis of the disease is unknown and there is no specific treatment. To investigate the molecular pathways and disease functions potentially involved in the pathogenesis of FIC, we evaluated the bladder mucosa transcriptome of affected and healthy cats. Urinary bladder tissues were collected from 3 healthy cats and from 3 FIC cats representing 3 different histological phenotypes (ulcerative, nonulcerative, and hyperplastic). RNA from bladder tissues was isolated and sequenced using high throughput next generation sequencing. Differential gene expression and molecular pathway and disease factor analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. A significant level of gene set enrichment (-log [p] > 1.3) was identified in several annotated disease and function categories. The inflammatory response function was up regulated in the non-ulcerative and ulcerative phenotypes (zscores 1.9 and 2.6 respectively), and down regulated in the hyperplastic phenotype (z-score -3.6). The cellular growth and proliferation category was down regulated in the non-ulcerative and hyperplastic phenotypes (z-scores -2.4 and -3.7) and up regulated in the ulcerative phenotype (z-score 6.5). The cell death and survival pathway was down regulated in the non-ulcerative and hyperplastic phenotype (-2.3 and -2.2) and up regulated in the ulcerative phenotype (6.5) . Further investigation of these pathways and other target genes may provide insight into the pathogenesis of FIC and identify new therapeutic targets as well as biomarkers of the disorder for future clinical applications. The aim of this study was to follow-up CKD dogs with IRIS stages 2 or 3 based on serum creatinine concentration, and also to investigate whether and when SDMA is in disagreement with creatinine concentrations for the classification of CKD stage. The study group was composed of twenty-one CKD dogs. CKD dogs with stage 2 (n= 9) and stage 3 (n= 12) were followed-up for 12 to 15 months or until death. The evaluation by means of serum creatinine concentrations, only two CKD dogs with stage 2 changed the classification to stage 3 during the follow-up, and also in those dogs serum SDMA was increased concomitantly; however other three CKD dogs with stage 2 had the increase only in SDMA (changing the classification to stage 3) and not in serum creatinine, showing the underestimation of the stage based on serum creatinine. In CKD dogs with stage 3, during the follow-up, only two dogs changed the classification to stage 4 based on serum creatinine concentrations, however when taking SDMA concentrations (> 45 \u03bcg/dL), 9 out of 12 changed the classification to stage 4 and among them, 6 out 9 dogs that had serum creatinine < 5.0 mg/dL were already in stage 4 since the beginning of the follow-up. Urinary protein to creatinine ratio (UP/C) measures the total amount of proteins in urine compared to urinary creatinine concentration, but it does not identify the origin of individual proteins. Qualitative evaluation of urinary proteins by immunodetection could add important information as to the nature of a renal disease as albuminuria is associated with glomerular disease, and retinol-binding protein (RBP) and vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP) with tubular damage due to the impairment of tubular reabsorption of low molecular weight proteins that are normally found in glomerular filtrate. The hypothesis of this study was that qualitative methods (e.g. western blotting) in association with quantitative methods (UP/C) may provide better assessment and evaluation of the origin of proteinuria. The aim was to study dogs with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and to determine the UP/C as well as to use immunoassay (western blotting) to detect urinary albumin, RBP and VDBP. The study group was composed of CKD dogs with stage 2 (n=9) and stage 3 (n=13) and they were followed up for 12 to 15 months or until death. Fifteen clinically healthy dogs of different breeds and age comprised the control group. Coomassie brilliant blue (Bradford method) was used for UP/C determination, and antialbumin (ab112986,1:500; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), anti-VDBP (ab95469,1:500; Abcam) and anti-RBP (ab48624, 1:250; Abcam) for the western blotting. Urinary albumin, RBP and VDBP were not detected in control dogs and UP/C was 0.15\u00b10.02 (mean\u00b1SEM) with a min of 0.03 and a max of 0.4. Only one CKD dog with stage 2 had proteinuria based on UP/C (mean of the follow-up, min-max; 1.49, 0.76-3.45 ) also with loss of VDBP (tubular pattern of renal disease). In the remaining 8 out of 9 CKD dogs with stage 2, the mean of UP/C was normal (UP/C < 0.4) during the follow-up period, however the qualitative evaluation detected loss of tubular proteins (RBP and /or VDBP) in 2/8, loss of glomerular protein (albumin) in 1/8, loss of tubular and glomerular proteins in 2/8, and in 3/8 no level of proteins were found. Proteinuria (UP/C > 0.5) was observed in 7 out of 13 CKD dogs with stage 3, and a tubular pattern characterized by the predominance of low molecular weight proteins loss (RBP and or VDBP) was noticed in 5/7, and the loss of albumin and RBP, both in similar magnitude, in 2/7 (tubular and glomerular pattern). In non-proteinuric (mean during follow-up, UP/C < 0.5) CKD dogs with stage 3 (n=6), the immunodetection of albumin and RBP or VDBP were observed in 3/6, and in 1/6 only a slight amount of albumin loss was detected. These findings suggest that sequential qualitative evaluation of urinary proteins can add more information to interpretation of UP/C results. Identification of the damaged nephron segment that caused a specific pattern of protein loss could help refine the diagnosis of a specific renal disease as well as to optimize therapy. Importantly, the detection of albumin, RBP and VDBP in urine samples with normal UP/C might serve as an early marker of glomerular and tubular injury. respectively. This study aims at describing P and QT dispersions, as well electrocardiographic changes observed in dogs with CKD stage IV undergoing IHD. The animals were classified considering serum creatinine (> 5mg/dL), urinary protein/creatinine ratio (> 0.5) and systolic blood pressure (> 160mmHg). Ten dogs weighing 15-30 kg were included in the study and electrocardiographic examinations were performed before and after the first three sessions of IHD. The results were analyzed using ANOVA with Friedman's test, considering a significance level of 5%. There were significant increases in values for P maximum (p = 0.011), QT maximum (p = 0.002), QT minimum (p = 0.023), however, the changes in P and QT dispersions were not significant (p> 0.05). There were increases in PR intervals (p = 0.019), QT intervals (p = 0.034) and a decrease in the amplitude of the R wave (p = 0.002). After the second session, three dogs (30%) developed sinus arrest and another three (30%) developed supraventricular arrhythmias. The results obtained suggest that employing IHD in dogs may cause electrocardiographic changes such as arrhythmias, interferences in atrioventricular conduction, as well as in the ventricular depolarization and repolarization process. These findings highlight the importance of electrophysiological monitoring in animals submitted to this therapeutic modality. sodium/1000 kcal) has been reported to increase urinary calcium while concomitantly increasing water intake and consequently urine volume when compared to a food containing approximately 0.4% (1g sodium/1000 kcal). When foods with similar Ca, P and Mg restriction but relatively high (3.5g/1000 kcal) and low (1g/1000 kcal) sodium content were compared, it was observed that relative supersaturation (RSS) for calcium oxalate was similar and calcium excretion was significantly greater for the high sodium food. 3 This suggests that a benefit ascribed to lower urinary saturation due to increased urinary water is offset by increased urine calcium content. Long term studies have not been performed in cats comparing RSS for calcium oxalate and recurrence rates for uroliths; however a correlation does exist in humans. Another surrogate for calcium oxalate risk, the Bonn Risk Index as described by Laube et al, has been proposed as a better predictor of future calcium oxalate risk than relative super saturation. 4, 5 This study examines low and high sodium feline dry foods by using the calcium oxalate titration (COT) test first described by Davidson 6 , which is similar to the human Bonn Risk Index test. In the COT test, centrifuged, unaltered, body temperature urine is titrated with a sodium oxalate solution and monitored at 585nm until precipitation occurs. The COT value is determined by dividing the urine [Ca 2+ ] by the resultant amount of oxalate added at the point of precipitation.",

The increase in plasma BHOB with IF on a high fat diet highlights its potential as a beneficial feeding regime for dogs with spinal disease. Obesity has become the most common health problem and can reduce longevity, increase risk of many chronic diseases, and adversely affect quality of life in dogs. Continuous caloric restriction (CCR) regimens have been applied for obesity treatment by creating a daily negative energy balance. However, CCR leads to decreased energy expenditure, which makes it difficult to continue to lose excess body fat and to maintain body weight after weight loss. The objective of this study was to compare the effect of CCR to an intermittent calorie restriction (ICR) regimen on body fat loss, and post-weight loss maintenance energy requirement (MERs) in obese dogs.",

Both studies involved pet owner surveys: Laflamme and colleagues'; 2008 questionnaire was administered by students over the phone to randomly selected telephone directories, while this present questionnaire was administered online and was distributed to pet owners on social media. The survey was promoted to general pet owning and pet appreciation groups and not to veterinary, nutrition or other special interest groups, and was open for sharing to reach a wide audience and acquire a sample representative of the general population of pets and pet owners. The study was approved by the research ethics boards of participating institutions (REB #17-08-029). Descriptive data were reported as percentages, while significant differences between the two studies were determined using Chi Square analysis, with significance set at P < 0.05. Information from Australia and the United States only were included for analysis. The results of both surveys are summarised in Table 1 below. Where data were comparable, significant differences in feeding practices over time included: increase in feeding homemade and raw diets, decrease in daily feeding of treats, and decrease in feeding a commercial diet as the main food source in both dogs and cats; while an increase in exclusive feeding of homemade diets was also detected in cats only. In essence, the trend appears to be a shift in pet nutrition away from the complete and balanced diets currently recommended by most veterinarians, in favour of home-prepared 'human'; foods and raw meat diets.",

There also needs to be a way or forum that allows veterinarians to openly discuss client complaints and how to deal with them in a supportive environment. As veterinary medicine becomes more advanced and we offer more expensive treatments and procedures, the issue of client complaints and communication will likely continue to grow.",

            "text": "Strategies to Improve Case Outcome When Referral is Not Affordable Referral to an internist is often in the best interest of a patient, particularly if the case involves a chronic, refractory, or undiagnosed condition. Unfortunately, many pet owners cannot afford the cost of referral. In these instances, the general practitioner is challenged with treating these complicated cases on a limited budget. Owners may even elect euthanasia due to cost of care. General practitioners may seek guidance from an internist in order to discuss diagnostic and treatment options for patients that need referral care but whose owners cannot afford it. Such consultations are frequently limited to a single phone conversation or email, and outcome is therefore unknown by the consulting internist. Additional strategies to improve options and outcome in these financially challenging cases may be beneficial to both general practitioners and patients. Furthermore, increasing the awareness of and preparedness of veterinary students for these challenges may improve their abilities to approach cases more efficiently when owners are on a limited budget.",

The most common diseases being treated were encephalitis (n = 84), immune-mediated hemolytic anemia or thrombocytopenia (n = 73), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD, n = 59), and other (n = 16, e.g. atopic dermatitis, anal furunculosis, uveitis). CsA peak levels for controlled (1119 \u00b1 704 ng/ml) versus uncontrolled patients (994.84 \u00b1 606 ng/ml) failed to demonstrate a statistical difference (P = 0.15). The t 1/2 of controlled patients (20 \u00b1 40 hrs) was significantly longer than uncontrolled patients (11 \u00b1 20 hrs) (P = 0.02). Significant variability was found in both peak CsA levels and t 1/2 . Co-treatment with prednisolone, leflunomide, and ketoconazole, and diseases also increased variability. Variability in CsA disposition supports the need for TDM to establish patient therapeutic range.

Gordon Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA German shepherd dogs (GSD) are predisposed to developing patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and are reportedly prone to type III PDA anatomy. Dogs with type III anatomy are not considered favorable candidates for device-based intervention. The objective of this study was to describe the PDA anatomy, baseline characteristics and procedural outcome of GSD with PDA. Medical records of 28 GSD that were diagnosed with PDA and underwent surgical ligation or transcatheter device closure between 2007 and 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. German shepherd dogs with PDA often presented with clinical signs (50%), concurrent congenital heart disease (35.7%) and arrhythmias (29%). Dogs were typically mature at presentation (median: 12.1 months) and had a relatively balanced sex distribution (57% female). Patent ductus arteriosus anatomy was classified in 24 of 28 GSD, with type II anatomy being most common (21/24). Three dogs had unusual anatomy (type IV in 1, type V in 2). Median minimal ductal diameter (MDD) in this population was larger than previously reported MDD in a mixed population and ranged between 4.4-4.9 mm depending upon imaging modality. Successful closure was achieved with an Amplatz Canine Duct Occluder (ACDO) in 22 dogs or via surgical ligation in 6 dogs. No cases of type III anatomy were confirmed.",

Chemotherapeutic drug dose escalation is a strategy of gradual dose increases with careful monitoring for toxicity, utilized to determine the highest tolerated dose and thereby achieve higher dose intensity and maximum efficacy. The purpose of this report was to describe cyclophosphamide dose escalation during equine chemotherapy. Nine horses were included following medical record search and case recruitment via the ACVIM LAIM and Oncology Diplomate listserves. Seven horses had multicentric lymphoma and two horses had cutaneous lymphoma. T-cell rich large B-cell lymphoma was the most common immunohistochemical classification (n = 6). Initial dose of cyclophosphamide ranged from 150 mg/m 2 to 300 mg/m 2 IV and furosemide was administered concomitantly. Other drugs administered included doxorubicin, L-asparaginase, vincristine, lomustine, cytosine arabinoside, chlorambucil, valacyclovir, and corticosteroids.Cyclophosphamide dose was escalated in 3 horses to maximum doses of 310mg/m 2 IV, 450 mg/m 2 IV, and 800 mg/m 2 IV. Adverse effects attributed to cyclophosphamide administration were noted in one horse.This horse developed VCOG-CTCAE grade 1 lethargy and pelvic limb edema following a cyclophosphamide dose of 800 mg/m 2 ; these signs resolved without treatment. This horse experienced no adverse effects at previous and subsequent cyclophosphamide doses \u2264 750 mg/m 2 IV. Two pregnant mares received cyclophosphamide at doses of 150 mg/m 2 and 300 mg/m 2 without adverse reactions or apparent detrimental effects on fetal health. These findings suggest that cyclophosphamide dose escalation may be used in treatment of equine lymphoma to achieve higher chemotherapeutic dose intensity while minimizing adverse effects. The therapeutic dose of cyclophosphamide may be higher in horses than previously used and further studies are warranted to determine the optimal dose of cyclophosphamide for horses.",

There are generally-accepted interpretations of SeM titers; however, specific references for data interpretation are lacking. The purpose of this study was to compare SeM titers with clinical disease displayed by horses post-outbreak to determine if the generallyaccepted titer interpretation was consistent with clinical signs in these horses. Following an outbreak of S. equi, serum was collected to measure SeM titers on all horses at 8 weeks post-outbreak and on select horses at 12 weeks and 28 weeks post-outbreak. Horses were categorized as having no disease, uncomplicated strangles, persistent guttural pouch infection (>40 days post-infection), and/or complicated cases (metastatic abscess formation or purpura hemorrhagica, for example) based on clinical findings. Twenty-eight out of forty-eight (58.3%) developed clinical signs of S. equi infection. Of the 28 affected horses, 11 (39.3%) had uncomplicated strangles, 12 (42.8%) had persistent guttural pouch infection, and 8 (28.6%) were complicated cases, 3 of which were dually-categorized as persistent guttural pouch infection and complicated cases. Sixteen out of 28 (57.1%) horses had titers \u22651:12,800 at 8 weeks post-outbreak. Only 6/16 horses with SeM titers \u22651:12,800 had evidence of strangles complications at that or later time points. SeM titers declined in all horses tested at 28 weeks (n=36) to levels \u22641:6,400. This outbreak demonstrates that SeM titers can be significantly elevated post-outbreak (\u22651:12,800) and the horse may not have strangles infection complications.

There is a non-linear inverse relationship between \u03b2-cell response and insulin sensitivity (IS) in the horse. The euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp (EHC) is a gold-standard method for measuring IS but the complexity of the technique limits its use to research. Insulin sensitivity was quantified using the EHC in 56 horses of different breeds with a wide range of IS including clinical patients diagnosed with insulin dysregulation. Quantitative measures of IS were expressed as M (mean glucose disposal rate) and M/I values. Basal plasma glucose and insulin concentrations to calculate proxies were determined from blood samples collected prior to the EHC. Proxies to estimate IS (quantitative insulin sensitivity check [QUICKI] and reciprocal of the square root of insulin [RISQI]) as well as proxies for \u03b2-cell response (basal insulin concentration [BIC], modified insulin-toglucose ratio [MIRG], homeostasis model assessment for \u03b2-cell function [HOMA-\u03b2%]) were calculated.

Consequently, the recommendations have been to refrigerate whole blood samples prior to centrifugation and separate plasma within 8 hours of collection.

It is imperative for the veterinarians to understand if freezing plasma has any negative effects on the stability of resting ACTH concentration.

Economic losses and the potential role of MAP in Crohn';s disease in humans, justify the study of paratuberculosis. Management practices that limit exposure of susceptible animals to MAP are more effective at reducing disease prevalence than testing and culling infected cows. The objective of this retrospective casecontrol study was to study the association between management practices and MAP status in dairy herds in Qu\u00e9bec. Twenty-six case herds (MAP isolated from at least 1 environmental sample) and 91 control herds (no clinical cases of paratuberculosis and negative on 2 consecutive yearly environmental samplings) were selected among herds enrolled in the Qu\u00e9bec Voluntary Paratuberculosis Control Program. Exposure was measured using a risk assessment questionnaire, completed at enrolment. Culture of MAP was achieved using the BACTEC 960 detection system. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between risk factors and MAP herd status. Herd size was significantly associated with a positive MAP herd status (OR = 1.17; 95 % CI: 1.02 -1.33). Farms buying more than 4 % of the cows in their herds per year in the last 5 years have significantly greater odds of being MAP positive compared to closed herds (OR = 5.44; 95 % CI: 1.23 -23.98).

Co-infection with multiple species of parasites are common and different parasites have different pathogenesis so investigation of the different populations of GIN is important to plan control strategies, understand interactions between parasites and the host as well as surveillance of regional diversity and determination of the specific populations involved in anthelmintic resistance. Several methods of identification are available, such as fecal culture and morphologic examination of the larval stage of the parasite or PCR, however these methods are time consuming, have a low throughput and/or require specific expertise. We originally developed deep amplicon sequencing of the nematode rDNA ITS-2 (the Nemabiome) to quantify the species composition of cattle GIN and we have recently adapted and validated its use in small ruminants. Field applications of the Nemabiome have included epidemiological studies of the nematode species affecting sheep flocks in Western Canada (fig.1) the identification of the parasite populations resistant to anthelmintics as a complement to the Fecal Egg Count Reduction Test (fig.2). The information gathered using deep amplicon sequencing provides important qualitative and quantitative information about the epidemiology and resistance status of the different species of gastrointestinal parasites, which is essential to make informed decisions about treatment and control.

Thoracic ultrasonography (TUS) seems promising but data are scant regarding its accuracy for diagnosis of ActP. The objective of this study was to estimate the accuracy of TUS (positive if maximal depth of consolidation (DEPTH) \u22653cm) compared to reference tests (Wisconsin Clinical Respiratory Scoring Chart (CRSC, positive if \u22655) and serum haptoglobin concentration (Hap, positive if \u226515mg/dL)), for the diagnosis of ActP in pre-weaned calves, using a latent-class model methodology (LCM). One population of veal calves (n=209) and one of dairy calves (n=301) were enrolled. TUS, CRSC and Hap (imperfect tests) were performed at the same day, in each calf. Bilateral TUS was performed by screening the mid to ventral portion of the lung caudal of the heart (caudal sites) as well as the right parenchyma cranial to the heart (cranial site). The DEPTH on TUS was recorded and noted separately for caudal and cranial sites. The accuracy of TUS was estimated by LCM for three tests conducted in two populations. The ActP prevalence in both populations was low (0.05). Adding the cranial site had little effect on TUS accuracy. Using DEPTH \u22653cm for caudal sites only, posterior sensitivity and specificity median estimates of 0.88(95%BCI: 0.52-1.0) and 0.95(95%BCI:0.92-0.98), respectively, were observed.

There is currently no surgical treatment for PPID and the treatment method of choice is with pergolide or cyproheptadine. The treatment of choice in humans and dogs for Cushing';s disease is to surgically remove the pituitary gland. We hypothesized that intracranial neurosurgery with the assistance of the neuronavigation would allow accurate extraction of the pituitary gland tissue from horses. This study consisted of 13 total cadaver horse heads chosen at random varying between the ages of 2-30 years old. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (N = 6) or computed tomography (CT) (N=7) was performed on each head followed by image registration with the neuronavigation and biopsy. Histopathological analysis was performed on all samples. Pituitary gland tissue was found in 6 of the 13 samples (46%) submitted. The higher contrast resolution of MRI compared to CT provided improved accuracy for pinpointing and acquiring pituitary tissue. An automated tissue resection device system showed increased success for pituitary tissue harvest of 80% compared to a traditional blunt brain biopsy needle, which had a 46% success. The pituitary gland has a thick, fibrous capsule making the use of the blunt biopsy needle an inappropriate instrument for performing pituitary tissue removal.

Affected dogs show signs of pain and frequently show lumbosacral pain. Tethered cauda equina has been reported in people with CM but currently there is no morphometric data on the caudal aspect of the vertebral column and spinal cord in CKCS. The purpose of this study was to compare the location of the conus medullaris in CKCS with other size-matched breeds. We hypothesized that the spinal cord terminates more caudally in CKCS.A retrospective study was conducted on 90 dogs with thoracolumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Dog breeds were grouped as CKCS (n=48), and brachycephalic (n=21) and non-brachycephalic (n=20) size-matched controls. MRI identifiers were removed to blind the observer. Termination of the spinal cord was determined from T2-weighted sagittal and axial images as the 6 th (L6), or 7 th lumbar vertebra (L7), or sacrum. Breed was revealed after Chi-squared analyses were performed.Among 48 CKCS, the spinal cord terminated at L6 in 3, L7 in 23, and sacrum in 22 dogs compared with 8 at L6, 27 at L7 and 5 at sacrum in 41 controls. Spinal cord termination was significantly more caudal in CKCS as compared to brachycephalic (P = 0.015) and nonbrachycephalic breeds (P = 0.005).

Mast cell granules contain pro-inflammatory mediators and vasoactive amines, and potential sequela of mast cell degranulation include life-threatening anaphylaxis and gastrointestinal (GI) ulceration. Patients with MCTs are treated with acid suppressants, including histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), to prevent GI ulceration. Acid suppressants have pH independent effects, including alteration of leukocyte cytokine production, modulation of cell number and function, and changes in mast cell degranulation ability. Mast cell granules require an acidic pH and contain a vacuolar-type ATPase to achieve acidity. This vacuolar ATPase is related to the H + / K + ATPase in gastric parietal cells, thus, PPIs may impact MCT function and survival. The effect of acid suppressants, most notably PPIs, on mast cells has not been fully explored. Using a previously validated in vitro rat mast cell line, RBL-2H3, and mouse bone marrow derived mast cells (BMMCs), our central objectives were to evaluate the effect of H 2 RA (famotidine) and PPI (esomeprazole) treatment on mast cell degranulation, granule morphology, and cell death.

Structural changes were observed with both acid suppressants but were more pronounced with esomeprazole.Acid suppressant treatment altered mast cell degranulation, viability, and structural morphology in vitro, with PPIs having more pronounced effects.

Nolte 2 1 Purdue College of Veterinary Medicine, West Lafayette, IN, USA, 2 N/A, West Lafayette, IN, USA, 3 Veterinary Clinical Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA Combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) is the standard treatment for dogs with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). While CHOP affordsdurable cancer remission to most dogs with DLBCL, some dogs benefit minimally from this therapy. Current methods of prognostic assessment do not adequately discriminate those dogs that will and will not derive significant benefit from CHOP. However, biodynamic imaging (BDI) a novel imaging technology that measures changes in intracellular motion induced within living tissues by drug treatment, has shown promise as a means to predict a tumor's sensitivity to chemotherapy.We previously showed that BDI, performed ex vivo on tumor biopsy tissues from dogs with lymphoma, accurately predicted in vivo response to doxorubicin. The purpose of this study was to expand the use of BDI to predicting clinical outcome of CHOP chemotherapy in dogs with DLBCL.Twenty-two dogs with WHO substage a DBLCL were enrolled in a prospective clinical trial. At the time of study enrollment, all dogs underwent standardized staging tests and surgical lymph node biopsy to provide tissue for histopathologic and immunohistochemical confirmation of DLBCL. All dogs subsequently received treatment with a previously described 25-week CHOP chemotherapy protocol. The primary clinical outcome of interest was progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time in days between initiation of CHOP chemotherapy and detection of measurable disease progression, or death due to any cause, whichever came first. At the time of enrollment, a portion of each dog's lymph node biopsy (approximately 100 mm 3 ) was reserved for ex vivo BDI. Within 1 hour of biopsy collection, the tissue was processed into several small fragments of approximately 1 mm 3 size. All fragments were immobilized in 96 well plates and treated ex vivo with 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide (5 \u03bcM), doxorubicin (10 \u03bcM), vincristine (0.06 \u03bcM), and prednisolone (0.6 \u03bcM), as well as the drugs in combination. Tissue samples treated with 0.1% DMSO served as negative controls. Changes in intracellular motion following ex vivo drug treatment were recorded from all tissue samples from each dog for approximately 24 hours following biopsy collection. A machine learning classifier was developed to analyze the intracellular motion-based tumor responses measured by BDI and to associate these responses with poor or favorable clinical responses based upon PFS.The classifier was trained in a \"one-left-out\" approach, first on data sets from 18/19 dogs, then adding in data from the remaining dog for crossvalidation. This process was repeated for each enrolled dog.Clinical outcome following CHOP chemotherapy was evaluable in 19/22 dogs. The best objective response to chemotherapy was complete remission in 17 dogs and partial remission in 2 dogs.Progression-free survival times ranged from 43 to > 769 days. When PFS times for the study population were segregated into low-PFS (\u2264 98 days, n=6) or high-PFS (\u2265 232 days, n = 13) groups, the machine learning classifier correctly predicted assignment of dogs to the appropriate group in 18/19 cases. The classifier consistently assigned one dog with low PFS (97 days) incorrectly into the high-PFS group. These results suggest a possible important application of BDI as a method for predicting the responsiveness of cancers to chemotherapy drugs.",

YM155, an imidazolium-based small molecule, has potent inhibitory activity to survivin; therefore, it is considered a potential new class of anti-tumor agents. In the current study, we screened for various canine tumor cell lines that have susceptibility to YM155. On the basis of the screening, we focused on squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and growth inhibitory mechanisms of YM155 in SCC cells were investigated. Among ten cell lines (eight tumor types) screened, only SCC cell line showed substantial susceptibility to YM155. Based on this finding, seven canine SCC cell lines were examined for susceptibility to the cytotoxic effects of YM155. YM155 clearly inhibited the growth of two cell lines HAPPY and SQ4. These cell lines, but not other cell lines, highly expressed survivin. In HAPPY cells, YM155 inhibited expression of survivin at the both mRNA and protein level. In contrast, YM155 down-regulated survivin expression only at the protein level in SQ4 cells. Moreover, YM155 suppressed cell growth mostly by induction of apoptosis in HAPPY cells but not in SQ4 cells. Our results suggested that canine SCCs with high cellular expression of survivin are susceptible to survivin inhibitor YM155. There are different mechanisms in YM155-induced suppression of survivin expression, namely at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.Moreover, YM155 was found to induce growth inhibition of SCC cells by induction of not only apoptotic cell death, but also non-apoptotic cell death.",

Mutsaers Ontario Veterinary College, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada Canine osteosarcoma (OSA) is the most common primary bone tumour in dogs. Chemotherapy delays metastasis, yet most dogs succumb within one year of diagnosis. Recent studies show that certain chemotherapeutics are sequestered within acidic endosomes, leading to chemoresistance. Furthermore, the high metabolic demand of cancer cells results in a preferential glycolytic shift that leads to tumor acidosis.Amiloride, a potassium-sparing diuretic, is among a class of proton pump inhibitors prescribed by veterinary cardiologists for refractory heart failure. In this study, we hypothesized that amiloride sensitizes canine OSA cells to carboplatin and doxorubicin by reducing their sequestration within acidic endosomes.Assessments of cell viability and apoptosis were performed in three OSA cell lines after single agent or combination treatment, and the synergism of each combination was evaluated with combination index (CI) calculations. Metabolic profiling of extracellular acidification rates (ECAR) and oxygen consumption rates (OCR) was performed, and immunoblotting was used to evaluate apoptotic protein expression.Amiloride sensitized canine OSA cells to doxorubicin (CI < 1.0), but not carboplatin (CI \u2265 1.0) in combination therapy. Consistent with these findings, combination treatment with doxorubicin significantly increased late apoptosis (P < 0.0001), but decreased necrosis (P < 0.001) in OSA cells compared to treatment with doxorubicin alone.

Immunohistochemistry of HER2 showed that HER2 protein overexpression was observed in 14/23 (61%) dogs with TCC but not in the healthy dogs.This study demonstrated that the antitumor effects of lapatinib on the canine TCC cell lines by inhibiting HER2 signaling and inducing cell cycle arrest. Importantly, lapatinib also exerted the antitumor effects on the canine TCC-engrafted mice. In addition, HER2 protein was overexpressed in more than half of the dogs with TCC. These results suggest that lapatinib has therapeutic potential for dogs with TCC.",

CCNU is a potent myelosuppressive agent and can cause cumulative dose-related irreversible hepatotoxicity, indicating a need of accurate dose adjustment. However, CCNU is an oral capsule drug, and thus, a fine dose adjustment is difficult. Nimustine (ACNU), the same nitrosourea agent, is an intravenous injection drug and its safety in dogs has been demonstrated in a phase I study. ACNU is therefore an attractive agent for the treatment of CHS. In this study, we thus examined the therapeutic potential of ACNU in the cases of CHS.Nine CHS cases (with gross disease, n = 4; in the adjuvant setting, n = 5) were treated with ACNU (20-30 mg/m 2 ) for 1-527 days.

MDSCs are discriminated from other monocytes in that they possess strong immunosuppressive activities rather than immunostimulatory properties. Exosomes are small membrane-bound vesicles that provide a method of communication between cells through their ability to transfer proteins and miRNA. We hypothesize that tumor cells secrete exosomes that are taken up by monocytes and promote MDSC differentiation through defective myeloid cell maturation. Methods Exosomes were isolated from tumor cell lines (osteosarcoma, glioma, colon carcinoma, melanoma, fibrosarcoma) and from primary cultures of each parental cell of origin. Following addition of exosomes to monocytes over 3 consecutive days, cells were collected for flow cytometry, transcriptional analysis, and T cell proliferation assays. Results Increased expression of anti-inflammatory mediators (IL-10, iNOS, Arg1) and decreased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-12, TNFa) was observed in the monocytes after the addition of exosomes from all the tumor lines supporting the conversion to a suppressor phenotype. Flow cytometry and T cell proliferation assays confirmed a MDSC phenotype. Exosomes isolated from the primary control cultures did not promote suppressive functions by the monocytes.Conclusion Our data supports the hypothesis that tumor-derived exosomes promote MDSC differentiation. A better mechanistic understanding of this interaction is critical for the discovery of novel therapeutic targets in cancer treatment, with the ultimate goal of preventing the conversion of monocytes to a suppressor phenotype.",

The purpose of this study was to quantify errors inherent to orthogonal megavoltage (MV) portal and kilovoltage (kV/kV) imaging versus CBCT when used to verify setup of bony targets. Our hypothesis was that use of planar imaging would necessitate inclusion of a setup margin in the planning target volume (PTV) expansion. MATERIALS AND METHODS All patients receiving head and neck SRT were considered for inclusion in this prospective clinical study. Planar (MV ports and kV/kV images) and rotational (CBCT) images were acquired before treatment, and manually co-registered with the reference image set. Differences in patient position (vertical, lateral, longitudinal, pitch, yaw, and roll) when matched based on MV ports, kV/kV images, and CBCT were compared. RESULTS Eighty-two independent data sets were evaluated. Mean differences in lateral, longitudinal and vertical directions from MV ports to kV/kV images were 1.0, 0.4 and 0.8 mm, respectively, with a mean 3D vector of 1.7 mm 3 . Mean angular difference in pitch and yaw were 0.3 and 0.4 . Mean differences from MV ports to CBCT images were 1.2, 0.7, and 1.3 mm, respectively, with a mean vector of 2.2 mm 3 . Mean angular differences were 0.7 and 0.5 . The mean roll detected on CBCT was 0.6 ; this could not be quantified with planar imaging. CONCLUSIONS The mean shift discrepancies described herein should be accounted for in the setup margin for linac-based SRT; failure to do so could result in early treatment failure due to geographic miss. Size of the PTV expansion can be minimized through use of CBCT and correction of visible positioning errors using a robotic couchtop, or meticulous manual positioning.",

IL-15 is also a promising cytokine for treating cancer. Despite a growing interest in the use of IL-15 as an immunotherapeutic agent, it has not been reported the immunological and clinical effects of IL-15 on cancers in dogs. In this study, we generated a recombinant canine IL-15 (rcIL-15), and determined its biological effects on immune effector cells, and confirmed its safety in vivo. After then, clinical and immunomodulatory effects of rcIL-15 in combination with metronomic cyclophosphamide were evaluated in canine patients with various tumor types. To determine the safety and immunologic effects, rcIL-15 was injected intravenously in doses of 20 \u03bcg/kg daily for 8 days and monitored for 32 days. Treatment outcomes in dogs with cancers were evaluated in a prospective clinical trial. Low dose of cyclophosphamide (15 mg/m 2 , PO, SID) was continuously administrated for 7 weeks. From day 14 after administration of cyclophosphamide, rcIL-15 (20 \u03bcg/kg daily) was injected intravenously for 8 days. Although several dogs experienced temporal and mild pyrexia, any other significant adverse events were not detected during and after injection of rcIL-15. Administration of rcIL-15 in combination with metronomic cyclophosphamide remarkably increased the number of NK cells and its anti-cancer activities, and significantly decreased the number of regulatory T cells in the peripheral blood of all patients, which were associated with improved clinical outcomes. Our results suggest rcIL-15 is safe and has tremendous potential for antitumor therapy for dogs.",

This limitation may be overcome by evaluating the association in dogs and cats. We hypothesized that the rate of primary pulmonary neoplasia would be increased in dogs and cats residing in counties with higher environmental radon levels.Systematic retrospective review of medical records at ten veterinary schools identified client-owned dogs and cats diagnosed with primary lung tumors between 2010 and 2015. Patient radon exposure was determined by correlating the patient's zip code with published county EPA radon levels. County pulmonary neoplasia rates were determined using average annual county cat/dog populations; rates were compared between radon zones using ANOVA with subsequent pairwise comparisons.Record review identified 690 dogs and 205 cats with primary pulmonary neoplasia from veterinary schools with high (n = 4), mid-level (n = 2) or low (n = 4) radon levels. Average county level rates of canine pulmonary neoplasms were higher in high environmental radon areas (> 4 pCi/L) compared to counties with mid-(2-4 pCi/L) (p < 0.0006) or low (< 2 pCi/L) radon (p < 0.0037). There was no significant difference in the pulmonary neoplasia rate by radon level in cats (p = 0.1011).Higher environmental radon levels may play a role in development of primary pulmonary neoplasia in dogs.

Cell mechanisms of MDR may includeproteins involved in nucleo-cytoplasmic transport, such as lung resistance-related protein (LRP), the major vault protein, that was found to be overexpressed in many chemoresistant primary tumors, including lymphomas, and it was associated to poor response to the treatment.The aim of this study was to investigate LRP expression in dogs with cutaneous lymphoma.

Expression was assessed using in situ RNA-Scope\u00ae RNA hybridization; evaluation of ucb was used to screen for adequate residual RNA. Presence and magnitude of expression were correlated with the tumor grade, vascular invasion, necrosis, matrix, cellular density, and pleomorphism.

This study aimed to characterize the overall incidence and risk factors of doxorubicininduced clinical cardiotoxicity. Methods: Medical records for dogs that received three or more doses of doxorubicin 2006-2015 were reviewed. Dogs were considered to have clinical cardiotoxicity if they lacked pre-existing heart disease and developed syncope, collapse, exercise intolerance, congestive heart failure, or sudden death during or after doxorubicin treatment. Results: Of 444 cases in the study population, 20 (4.5%) developed clinical cardiotoxicity. The median time from treatment initiation to clinical sign development was 194 days. Dogs that developed clinical cardiotoxicity had a higher cumulative dose of doxorubicin and a higher body weight. Dogs that received a 1-hour infusion rather than a 10-15 minute infusion were also more likely to develop clinical cardiotoxicity. Boxer dogs had a higher incidence of cardiotoxicity. No association was found with dexrazoxane administration, dosing interval, or other chemotherapy drugs. A total of 225 dogs had an echocardiogram and ECG prior to the first doxorubicin treatment and at least one subsequent evaluation. Dogs with clinical cardiotoxicity had a significant decrease in fractional shortening from their baseline (-31.4%) compared to the fractional shortening change in unaffected dogs (+2.1%). Development of arrhythmias was associated with cardiotoxicity. Conclusion: Overall incidence of the development of clinical cardiotoxicity was 4.4%.

Similarly, erythrocytes from diabetic cats have increased Heinz bodies formation which may suggest increased oxidative stress, but this topic has not yet been thoroughly investigated.Furthermore, because remission of diabetes in cats has been shown to be associated with less marked hyperglycemia and normal serum cholesterol, it is possible that antioxidant capacity of cats achieving remission is higher than in those without remission.

Compared to controls, diabetic cats at diagnosis had higher median membrane carbonyls [4.6 nmol/mg (range: 0.1-37.7) vs. 0.7 nmol/mg (range: 0.1-4.7), p<0.001] and lower cytoplasmic thiols [0.4 \u03bcmol/mg (range: 0.2-0.6) vs. 0.6 \u03bcmol/mg (range: 0.4-0.8), p<0.01]. Cytoplasmic TBAR was lower in diabetic cats [1.9 nmol/mg (range: 0.5-2.4) vs. 2.4 nmol/mg (range: 1.4-3.5), p<0.01]. At 3-4 months, membrane carbonyls remained higher (p<0.01), cytoplasmic thiols and TBAR lower (p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively). Differences between cats with and without remission were not documented, except for cytplasmic AOPP being lower in those with remission at 1-2 months (p<0.05).",

No previous studies have linked molecular markers to survival times in dogs after adrenalectomy, making it difficult to give a reliable prognosis. The aim of this study was to identify molecular prognostic markers in a large cohort of canine ATs. This could not only enhance insight in individual prognosis, but could also provide potential future treatment targets. Fifty-nine dogs with hypercortisolism due an AT that underwent adrenalectomy between 2002 and 2015 at the authors'; institution and of which follow-up information was available, were included in this study. Three classes of potential prognostic factors were reviewed: firstly clinical data, including body weight, age at time of surgery, gender, neuter status and tumor size; secondly immunohistochemical Ki67 labeling index, and thirdly mRNA expression of factors associated with proliferation of ATs, including SF-1, PTTG1, PBX1, VAV2, RRM2, TOP2A, Ki67, CCND1, MC2R and BCL2. Univariate analysis was performed with the Cox proportional hazards model for continuous variables and the Log Rank test for bivariate variables. Multivariate analysis was performed using multiple linear regression with forward selection. Median survival time was 63.6 \u00b1 9.4 months. In the univariate analysis, significant prognostic factors were tumor volume in cm 3 (P=0.015, hazard ratio (HR)=1.004), maximal diameter of tumor in cm (P=0.047, HR=1.284), Ki67 labeling index (P6) as independent predictors of poor survival. In conclusion, most important predictors of poor survival are Ki67 labeling index and SF-1 expression. These results show the importance of including Ki67 staining in histopathological assessment of canine ATs.Moreover, since pharmacological manipulation of SF-1 is possible, the considerable impact of SF-1 expression on prognosis indicates great potential of SF-1 as a treatment target in canine ATs in the near future.",

In humans with thyroid neoplasia or toxic nodular goiter, administration of recombinant human thyroid stimulating hormone (rh-TSH) can increase thyroidal iodine uptake, thereby allowing lower doses of radioactive iodine to be used for treatment. Similar strategies could be valuable for treating feline hyperthyroidism. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the effects of rh-TSH administration on iodine uptake in hyperthyroid cats. In randomized crossover design, 10 client-owned cats with hyperthyroidism were treated with placebo, 50 \u03bcg rh-TSH (low-dose), and 100 \u03bcg rh-TSH (high-dose) with treatments separated by 8-10 days. Following each treatment, thyroid scintigraphy was performed by administering 300 \u03bcCi 123 I and assessing radionuclide uptake at 8 and 24 hour time points. Serum thyroid hormone profiles also were measured at each visit. Thyroidal iodine uptakes (mean + SD at 8 and 24 hours) were not different among placebo (25.2 \u00b1 13.4, 30.0 \u00b1 12.8), low-dose (24.1 \u00b1 12.5, 29.4 \u00b1 13.7), and high-dose (24.2 \u00b1 16.3, 30.8 \u00b1 15.3) treatments (P = 0.81). Independent of rh-TSH administration, cats with severe increases in serum thyroid hormone concentrations had greater radioactive iodine uptake at 8 hours (P = 0.002), but not at 24 hours(P = 0.08), as compared to cats with mild increases. Administration of rh-TSH as performed in this study would not be expected to lower the radioactive iodine dose needed for treatment. Investigations of alternate strategies to increase thyroidal uptake of radioactive iodine are warranted.",

The insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) were examined as markers of insulin resistance. Anti-FGF1 neutralizing antibody was added to CM-treated insulin-resistance models for blocking the biological activities of FGF1 contained in cAT-MSCs CM. Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR and western blot analysis were used to assess mRNA and protein levels of these markers. Data were compared by one-way ANOVA using the GraphPad Prism v.6.01 software. Relative protein expression levels of IRS-1 and GLUT4 were augmented in the cAT-MSC CM treatment group compared to insulinresistance model controls, indicating beneficial effects of cAT-MSC to DM, probably by actions of secreting factors. With reference to previous studies on fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF1), we proposed FGF1as a contributing factor to the mechanism of action. We added anti-FGF1 neutralizing antibody to the CM-treated insulin resistance models. As a result, significantly diminished protein levels of IRS-1 and GLUT4 were observed, supporting our assumption.Accordingly, this study advocated the potential of MSC CM as an alternative insulin sensitizer and discovered a signalling factor associated with the paracrine effects of cAT-MSC.",

Limited treatment options and increasing resistance support investigation of alternative treatments. Probiotics have emerged as adjunct therapies for many intestinal pathogens; however, little work has been done to investigate their efficacy against Tf infection.Commercial Enterococcus faecium (Efm) and a novel probiotic, Enterococcus hirae (Eh), were used to evaluate efficacy in the inhibition of Tf growth and adhesion in vitro. The effect of Enterococcus on Tf proliferation was evaluated throughout log phase growth in co-culture media. The potential of probiotics to reduce Tf adhesion to intestinal epithelium was analyzed with a previously validated co-culture model using porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2). Tf adhesion and cytotoxicity were evaluated using fluorescent microscopy and crystal violet spectrophotometric analysis. SEM and IFA were used to visualize the interactions of Tf, Enterococcus, and IPEC-J2 monolayers. Data were analyzed using SigmaStat.Enterococcus-induced inhibition of Tf growth was observed at concentrations as low as 10:1 Tf:Efm (p < 0.001) and was determined to be largely pH dependent (p < 0.01). Inhibition of Tf replication was not observed when co-cultured with heat-killed Enterococcus, indicating viable Enterococcus organisms were required for inhibition. Pretreatment of IPEC-J2 monolayers with Enterococcus significantly reduced Tf-induced cytopathogenicity (p =0.002). This benefit was notobserved when Enterococcus was introduced simultaneously or following Tf infection. These findings suggest that pre-treatment of atrisk cats with probiotics containing Enterococci may alleviate clinical illness resulting from subsequent Tf infection. Eh more effectively decreased Tf adhesion to the intestinal epithelium as compared to Efm (p < 0.001), suggesting its superiority as a novel probiotic in Tf infection. Preliminary results also showed Eh was effective at reducing growth and adhesion of a ronidazole-resistant strain of Tf.

Our previous data suggest that IH is associated with subclinical inflammation in this breed. IH is considered a risk factor for several pathologic conditions including pancreatitis, reduced gallbladder motility, proteinuria, and might also lead to insulin resistance (IR), which can be evaluated by the homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) score. Increased serum concentrations of calprotectin were associated with IR in people, but such an association has not been reported for dogs. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate indicators of IR in a population of Miniature Schnauzers. Serum samples from 150 clinically healthy Miniature Schnauzers were used for this study. A study questionnaire was completed for each dog to confirm the health status and medication history. Serum triglyceride, cholesterol, glucose, and calprotectin concentrations were measured in all samples. Paired serum samples were available from 16 of the dogs with IH 14-26 weeks after starting an ultra-low fat diet. In addition to serum triglyceride, cholesterol, glucose, and calprotectin, the concentration of serum insulin was measured in all samples, and the pre-treatment HOMA-IR was calculated as [(insulin [mU/L] x glucose [mmol/L])/22.5]. Statistical analyses were performed using non-parametric (paired or unpaired) group comparisons and likelihood ratio tests. A total of 71 dogs (47%) were diagnosed with IH, of which 51 had HTGL, 7 HCHOL, and 13 had combined IH. Serum glucose concentrations did not differ between dogs with normal vs. increased serum calprotectin concentrations in either the hyperlipidemic or the normolipidemic group (all P > 0.05). In the 16 dogs with IH included in the ultra-low fat dietary trial (n = 6 with isolated HTGL, n = 9 with combined IH), the HOMA-IR was significantly higher in dogs with increased vs. normal serum calprotectin concentrations (P = 0.0430), but no significant difference was seen in serum insulin or glucose concentrations. Dogs with combined IH had significantly higher HOMA-IR (P = 0.0216), serum insulin concentrations (P = 0.0443), and a higher proportion of dogs with increased serum calprotectin concentrations (P = 0.0249) than dogs with isolated HTGL, but no difference in serum glucose concentration was detected.

Fecal occult blood testing identifies microscopic blood in the stool. Trace bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract can occur from pathologies such as gastrointestinal lymphoma, chronic enteropathies, and gastric ulcers/erosions. Guaiac-based fecal occult blood testing (gFOBT) relies on heme peroxidase activity. It is widely used in human medicine as a non-invasive and inexpensive diagnostic tool. For veterinary patients, gFOBT has been presumed to crossreact with dietary peroxidases but has been incompletely researched, especially in cats. Eleven clinically healthy, indoor-only cats aged 1-8 years old were initially fed their normal diets, then transitionally fed 2 gastrointestinal diets over a 7-week period: hydrolyzed protein Purina HA diet\u00ae and gastroenteric Purina EN diet\u00ae. Two fecal samples were tested per cat each week using human point-of-care Hemoccult\u00ae tests. Two cats produced positive stool samples during the first 2 weeks of the study when fed their normal, liver-based diet and when mixed with the HA diet. Stool from a single cat fed the canned EN diet, containing liver (unlike the dry form), produced positive results during weeks 4, 5, and 6 of the study. Additionally, 2 other cats produced positive stool results during week 4 when fed mixed HA/EN diets. This study suggests that dietary protein sources can interfere with feline gFOBT, especially when there is liver in the diet. Additionally, it suggests that gFOBT should occur 1 week following a diet change to a gastrointestinal formulated diet to avoid potential transitional diet inference.

Macrophages in polypoid lesions have been described to play an important role in neutrophil infiltration in the lesion by producing interleukin (IL)-8. On the contrary, IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, has also been reported to be upregulated in polypoid lesions, but its significance in the pathogenesis of ICRP has not been clarified.Mucosal regulatory T cell (Treg) is one of the cellular sources of IL-10 and has been described to maintain gut health by regulating mucosal inflammation in humans and dogs.

The metabolome is the complete set of small-molecule compounds found in a biological sample. Changes in the metabolome have been documented in different species and for various conditions. The metabolome holds potential for the discovery of disease biomarkers as well as therapeutic targets. The aim of this study was to perform an untargeted analysis of the fecal metabolome of cats with different forms of chronic enteropathy.

Prior to analysis, all cats underwent a comprehensive work up including histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and clonality testing (PCR for antigen receptor rearrangements) of endoscopically-derived biopsies to determine their phenotype. Fifteen healthy cats of similar age served as a control group. Differences between healthy cats and cats with CE were evaluated using Welch';s two-sample t-test adjusted using the False Discovery Rate and expressed as q-values. Statistical significance was set at q < 0.05. Differences between cats with idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and small cell lymphoma (SCL) were evaluated using the Mann-Whitney U test. Based on histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and clonality testing a diagnosis of IBD was reached in 7 cats and intestinal small cell lymphoma (SCL) in 11 cats. In 12 cats, histopathology was consistent with inflammatory lesions, while clonality testing of intestinal biopsies revealed clonal rearrangements. UPLC-MS/MS identified 865 named biochemicals of which 85 showed a decreased concentration, while 235 were found to be increased in fecal samples from cats with CE compared to healthy controls. Metabolic pathways found to be significantly altered in cats with CE included: tryptophan metabolism, glycolysis, polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism, and secondary bile acid metabolism. Random Forest analysis revealed a predictive accuracy of 80% for differentiating controls from cats with CE. Arachidonic acid showed a trend towards differentiation of cats with IBD from those with SCL (p = 0.0853). Principal Component Analysis showed separate clustering of healthy cats and cats with CE.

A prospective study was conducted to examine the duodenal perfusion of dogs with chronic enteropathy (CE, n = 26) and intestinal lymphoma (n = 7) in comparison to control involving dogs with histopathologically normal duodenum (n = 14). Dogs in CE group were further classified based on canine chronic enteropathy clinical activity index (CCECAI) at CEUS into remission (CCECAI 0-3, n = 16) and symptomatic (CCECAI > 3, n = 10). The duodenum was imaged after an intravenous bolus injection of the contrast agent (Sonazoid \u00ae , 0.01 ml/kg). Perfusion parameters derived from quantitative analysis of CEUS images including the time-to-peak (TTP), peak intensity (PI), area under the curve (AUC), wash-in and wash-out rates (WiR and WoR, respectively) were evaluated. PI was significantly higher in symptomatic CE (median(range): 105.4 (89.3-128.8)) mean pixel value (MPV) compared to control (89.9 (68.5-112.2) MPV). AUC was significantly higher in symptomatic CE (4847.9 (3824.3-8462.8) MPV.sec) when compared to control (3448.9 (1559.5-4736.9) MPV.sec) and remission CE (3862.3 (2094.5-6899.0)MPV.sec). Positive correlation was detected between PI and CCECAI in CE dogs. No significant difference in any perfusion parameter was detected between intestinal lymphoma and CE as well as control groups. In conclusion, PI and AUC could detect a change of duodenal perfusion in associated with CE that make these parameters provide useful information for diagnosis and monitoring CE dogs.",

These cells are involved in the production of growth factors necessary for ISC function, and produce antimicrobial peptides.Defects of Paneth cell function are involved in the pathogenesis of different intestinal diseases in humans, such as inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer. In dogs and cats, the small intestine consistently stains negative for lysozyme, and cells that morphologically resemble Paneth cells have not been identified by light microscopy. We therefore sought to characterize cells that functionally represent Paneth cells in the dog small intestine, using full thickness biopsies as well as primary 3D cultures of epithelial cells (so-called enteroids).Ten-centimeter tissue pieces were acquired from the jejunum of healthy dogs which had been euthanized for an unrelated project. Full thickness tissues were fixed in 10% formalin saline, routinely processed and embedded in paraffin. For enteroid culture, minced samples were washed and crypts were enriched, using EDTA chelation,embedded in matrigel, and grown in intestinal stem cell media. RNA in situ hybridization (RNA ISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to identify cells staining positive for 7 previously reported markers of Paneth cells for mouse and human: lysozyme (LYS), canine interleukin 17 (IL-17), canine beta defensin 103 (CBD 103), canine cathelicidin (CATH), frizzled class receptor 5 (FZD5), neurogenin 3 (NEUROG3) and ephrin receptor tyrosine kinase B2 (EPHB2). In addition, ISC markers were used to characterize the stem cell niche: for LYS, IL-17, CBD103 and CATH, and positive for FZD5, EPHB2 and NEUROG3. Cells expressing Paneth cell markers were highly positive in the crypts of both full thickness sections and enteroids, however, positive staining was also found throughout the differentiated cells of the villus tip, although with less intense staining. Markers for ISC (LGR5 and SOX9) were positive and clearly defined to 3-4 cells at the bottom of crypt areas in both full thickness sections and enteroids. These staining patterns differ from those of humans and mice, in that Paneth-like cells seem to be more dispersed throughout the epithelium in the canine small intestine as compared to localizing within the defined crypt in other mammals. We have, for the first time, identified cells that functionally represent Paneth-like cells in the jejunum of dogs.

Similar types of transfusion reactions are seen in veterinary patients as those seen in humans. The incidence of reactions in dogs and cats is considered higher than in people and the severity of reactions is similar with the potential for some reactions to be fatal. In human medicine, lack of education in transfusion medicine has been shown to lead to inappropriate blood product use, which in turn can lead to an increased incidence of transfusion reactions. Most veterinary college core curricula provide limited education in the area of small animal transfusion reactions. Improving veterinary student education could lead to earlier recognition of reactions as well as improved knowledge in the areas of prevention and treatment. This may ultimately lead to a reduction in patient morbidity and mortality. The objectives of this randomized controlled study were to develop and test the instructional efficacy of an online learning module on transfusion reactions in small animals and to evaluate participants'; satisfaction of the module. Our hypothesis was that students who completed the module would perform better on two post module assessments compared to students who received information about transfusion reactions through traditional methods (i.e. verbal instruction, clinical case rounds).

Positive bacterial growth of bile samples from these patients is less common than is our suspicion for an infectious culprit. Studies to determine if bacteria reside in the gallbladder of healthy dogs or dogs with culture-negative gallbladder disease has not been reported. The present study performed next-generation sequencing of gallbladder bile and mucus from dogs with and without gallbladder disease to characterize the bacterial community composition for presence of a commensal microbiome or unrecognized pathogenic bacteria. Bile samples were obtained by cholecystocentesis from 22 healthy dogs (CTRL) and 36 dogs with suspected bacterial cholecystitis (SBC). Gallbladder mucus was obtained after cholecystectomy in 22 dogs with mucocele formation (GBM). Presence of Eubacteria was examined by aerobic and anaerobic culture, cytology, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). All samples underwent DNA extraction, PCR amplification of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene, and Illuminabased sequencing. Dogs in the CTRL group were significantly younger (median 3, range, 1-4 yrs) than dogs in SBC (9.6, 1.2-15 yrs) or GBM (10.9, 4.8-16 yrs) groups (p < 0.001). GBM dogs had higher neutrophil counts (p = 0.006) and higher total serum bilirubin (p = 0.043) compared to SBC dogs. No CTRL dogs were positive for the presence of bacteria by means of culture, cytology, or FISH. Similar numbers of SBC and GBM dogs had positive results of bacterial culture, cytology, or FISH.

Reduced mucosal blood flow due to portal hypertension and increased gastric acid secretion secondary to hypergastrinemia have been suspected as potential pathogenetic mechanisms causing gastroduodenal ulceration. We hypothesized that dogs with hepatobiliary disease would have hypergastrinemia. Our study aimed to compare serum gastrin concentrations among dogs with chronic hepatitis, dogs with a congenital portosystemic shunt, and healthy control dogs. After withholding food for 12 hours, blood samples were collected from 20 dogs with chronic hepatitis, 8 dogs with a congenital portosystemic shunt, and 39 healthy client owned control dogs. Serum was separated, frozen immediately, and stored at \u221280 C until analysis. Gastrin was measured using a chemiluminescent, enzyme-labeled immunometric assay (IMMULITE \u00ae 2000 Serum Gastrin Assay, Siemens). The assay working range is 10 -1,000 ng/L and our previously developed reference range is The median (min -max) serum gastrin concentrations was \u226410 (\u226410 -39) for dogs with chronic hepatitis, \u226410 (\u226410 -17) for dogs with a portosystemic shunt, and \u226410 (\u226410 -30) ng/L for healthy control dogs.

Babesia microti-like infection has been reported in domesticated European dogs and wild North American foxes; however, infection in domestic dogs from North America has only been rarely reported. Due to the genetic differences from other Babesia organisms that cause canine babesiosis, detection of B. microti-like DNA requires use of species-specific PCRs or broader Piroplasma PCR primers. The North Carolina State University-College of Veterinary Medicine-Vector-borne Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (NCSU-CVM-VBDDL) recently validated and implemented a novel PCR assay designed to amplify a wide range of Babesia spp. Using the new PCR assay, dog blood samples (n = 5214) submitted to the NCSU-CVM-VBDDL for PCR testing between June 2015 and December 2017 were analyzed for Babesia DNA prevalence. Babesia spp. were detected in 195/5214 (3.74%) dogs, including B. gibsoni (2.26%), B. vogeli (0.44%), B. microti-like (0.42%), B. canis (0.33%) and B. coco (0.29%). B. microti-like specimens were further evaluated by amplification and sequencing of multiple mitochondrial and nuclear genes. Geographical location and available clinical data were collated. All B. microti-like infected dogs (n = 22) resided in North America, primarily in the eastern and southern US (predominant source of NCSU-CVM-VBDDL accessions), with no known travel to Europe. Clinicopathologic abnormalities in 7 B. microti-like infected dogs included regenerative anemia (n = 6), thrombocytopenia (n = 3), proteinuria (n = 2), splenomegaly (n = 2), and hyperglobulinemia (n = 2). 81.8% (18/22) of B. microti-like infected dogs were American Pitt Bull Terrier-type breeds. Of 9 B. microti-like PCR positive dogs tested by B. vogeli and B. gibsoni IFA, only 6 (66.7%) were seroreactive, further suggesting that antibody detection is inadequate to fully screen for babesiosis in dogs. B. microti-like coinfections included B. gibsoni (n = 12) and Mycoplasma spp. (n = 2); one dog was E. canis IFA seroreactive. We conclude that: 1) B. microti-like infection occurs in dogs in North America. 2) Infection with these organisms induce clinicopathological abnormalities consistent with babesiosis. 3) Clearance of the infection (based upon seroreversion and negative PCRs) correlates with clinical improvement. 4) Dogs suspected of vector-borne infections in North America should be screened using PCR assays that detect B. microti-like parasites.",

When comparing acute with convalescent samples (n = 40), 1 B. clarridgeae/ B. henselae co-infection and 2 B. henselae infections were newly diagnosed by PCR. Most convalescent samples were Bartonella seroreactive (27/40; 67.5%) with 17 (42.5%) having been seroreactive with the corresponding acute sample; 7 (17.5%) cats had a \u2265 4 fold increase in Bartonella titers between acute and convalescent samples. One acute A. phagocytophilum PCR+ cat seroconverted to Anaplasma by SNAP \u00ae 4DX \u00ae Plus Test. Clinicopathologic data was collected only at the time of acute sample collection. The average grouped by FVBP PCR+ (n = 38), B. henselae PCR+ (n = 25)and PCR-(n = 48) results. In cats with AOF, neutrophilia was significantly associated with a FVBP (p = 0.037; Odds Ratio (OR) 2.6; 95% CI: 1.050 -6.205) or B. henselae (p = 0.003; OR 4.7; 95% CI: 1.633 -13.461) PCR+ result compared to PCR-cats. Based on our study, FVBPs are common in cats with AOF. Bartonella spp. were the most prevalent FVBP; however, prevalence rates were comparable to rates reported in cats without AOF. Hepatozoon spp. may be a more frequent cause of AOF in cats in the United States than previously determined. Clinicians should routinely promote the use of flea and tickborne preventive strategies in cats and consider FVBP in the etiology of AOF, particularly if associated with neutrophilia.",

This study followed the serological and clinical status of dogs in mid-Missouri over the course of 3 years in regard to Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, and Borrelia spp. A convenience population of dogs belonging to staff and students at the University of Missouri College of Veterinary Medicine was used. Dogs aged in range from 1 to 10 years at the start of the study. Preliminary findings regarding change in serologic status over the first two years have previously been presented in abstract form; this is an update with more complete data.Dogs not suspected of having vector borne disease were enrolled in a three-year prospective study. Dogs underwent physical exam and owners completed a history questionnaire periodically, and at the same visit blood samples were submitted to IDEXX Laboratories for testing. Plasma was separated and analyzed using a multi-analyte SNAP\u00ae research ELISA for antibodies to Bb (Lyme), E-genus (E. canis/E. chaffeensis), Ech (E. chaffeensis), Ew (E. ewingii), Ec (E. canis), A-genus (Anaplasma genus), Apl (A. platys), and Aph (A. phagocytophilum). If dogs were found to be seronegative for all tested pathogens, testing was repeated q 6 months. If dogs were positive at any time point for any tested pathogen, testing was repeated q 4 months. Seropositive dogs were not treated with antibiotics unless a clinical illness developed during the three years that the treating veterinarian (unrelated to our study) believed warranted antibiotics. Tick prevention was used only at the owner's discretion.A total of 858 samples were collected from 118 dogs; 101 participated in every planned sampling point while 10 dogs were euthanized, one died, and five moved out of state. Antibodies to Ehrlichia spp. this mid-Missouri population were frequently seropositive for E. ewingii and E. chaffeensis, however very few dogs had clinical evidence consistent with ehrlichiosis that prompted treatment. Evidence of seroconversion and intermittent seropositive results were common without clinical disease. Dogs may remain constantly or intermittently seropositive for Ehrlichia spp. at least 3 years without clinically obvious disease.ID11 Clinical and Laboratory Findings in Cats Fed Toxoplasma gondii Sporulated Oocysts Janelle Scott, Michael Lappin Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA It is now known that people commonly acquire Toxoplasma gondii infection by ingestion of sporulated oocysts passed in cat feces. Since cats are obligate carnivores, it has been assumed that most are infected with T. gondii by ingesting tissue cysts in prey species. However, the incidence, clinical sequelae, and laboratory findings associated with sporozoite-induced T. gondii infection in cats are poorly understood. The primary purpose of this study was to optimize the human T. gondii sporozoite antibody assay for use with cat sera for evaluation in subsequent epidemiological studies. To generate positive control sera against sporozoites for use in the assay titrations, 3 young adult cats were each fed 100,000 sporulated oocysts of the ME49 strain of T. gondii and monitored for systemic and ocular signs of toxoplasmosis. The cats were group housed during the day and enclosed in separate cages at night to enable collection of feces for sugar centrifugation and microscopic examination for oocysts. Toxoplasma gondii IgM and IgG antibodies against T. gondii tachyzoites were measured on",

Although A. abstrusus is considered endemic in parts of Europe, its distribution in the United States is largely unknown due to the utilization of insensitive diagnostic test methods and a lack of widespread prevalence studies. More epidemiological data about this parasite's presence within the United States is needed to raise awareness among veterinary professionals and identify at-risk regions. The objective of the present study was to compile commercial reference laboratory data over a seven-year period to determine the distribution of A. abstrusus within the United States based on widespread fecal testing in cats. The results of 3,136,542 feline ova and parasite (O&P) zinc sulfate centrifugation fecal flotation tests performed at IDEXX Reference Laboratories in the United States from January 2010 through September 2017 were compiled and sorted for tests positive for A. abstrusus larvae.

Recent epidemiological surveillance of a canine lungworm, Angiostrongylus vasorum, and its emergence into new areas of Europe has been greatly enhanced by the introduction of new high-throughput serological tests [Liu et al., Veterinary Parasitology: Regional Studies and Reports 2017, 7:45-47]. Similarly, the introduction of higher throughput and less labor-intensive diagnostic methods could help increase awareness of this parasite among veterinary professionals, achieve a greater understanding of epidemiological factors, and improve the care and treatment for clinically ill feline patients.

Infection with at least 10 Bartonella species have been documented in pet dogs worldwide. In particular, infection with B. henselae, B. koehlerae and Bartonella vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii have been reported in dogs with endocarditis, vasoproliferative pathology, vasculitis, myocarditis, polyarthritis, granulomatous lymphadenitis and hepatitis, epistaxis, and neurologic symptoms.

In the United States, the overall prevalence of canine heartworm disease has declined significantly since the late 20 th Century due to widespread usage of commercially-available chemoprophylactic drugs. Despite this progress, autochthonous transmission persists nationwide and the risk of heartworm infection for unprotected dogs remains. Therefore, dogs are screened annually using rapid tests that detect the presence of heartworm antigen in blood as recommended by the American Heartworm Society. At low prevalence, the positive predictive value of a diagnostic screening test is directly proportional with disease prevalence within the region of use. Consequently, in areas where the prevalence of heartworm infection has dropped below the claimed false positive rate (1 -specificity) for a screening test, rare positive test results may be suspected as false positives. The aim of this study was to reevaluate the field-observed specificity of the SNAP\u00ae 4Dx\u00ae Plus Test for heartworm (HW) antigen and estimate the local positive predictive value (PPV) for specific California counties.",

Ultrasound revealed a large hydronephrotic right kidney with perirenal fluid and right hydroureter. TUC revealed complete occlusion of the right neostoma. Right nephrectomy and ureterectomy were performed at the owners insistence. Communication was received from a remote client that their 2 year old female Australian Shepherd was diagnosed with right side hydronephrosis and hydroureter 18 months after bilateral TUCLCUE. Communication was received from a remote client 2 years after TUCLCUE was performed on a 4 month old female Newfoundland with ultrasound showing early hydronephrosis and hydroureter that was monitored with ultrasound. Transurethral cystoscopy revision of the neostoma has been recommended in all cases. The last case was reexamined with TUC after an inadequate response to TUCLCUE and a portion of the left vaginal ectopic ureter had not been completely corrected. Revision of the neostoma and residual vaginal ectopic ureter was performed.Spontaneous closure of the neostoma after TUCLCUE surgery is a significant complication of the procedure. Postoperative monitoring TUCLCUE cases with ultrasound is recommended to diagnose hydronephrosis and hydroureter early and allow early stoma revision to preserve the involved kidneys.",

            "text": "College, London, England, United Kingdom, 2 Royal Veterinary College, Hertfordshire, England, United Kingdom Vascular calcification is an important risk factor in human chronic kidney disease (CKD) and associated with dysregulated mineral metabolism. Precipitation of calcium and phosphate starts by formation of soluble colloidal primary calciprotein particles (CPPs) which transform to crystalline secondary CPPs. Shorter duration of this transformation step (i.e. increased serum calcification propensity) is associated with increased mortality in human CKD patients. Although vascular calcification is under recognized in cats with CKD, mineral disturbances similar to those observed in human CKD are common. Plasma fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) concentration is a marker of mineral disturbances in feline CKD. Here, we examined serum calcification propensity in a cross-section of cats with varying degrees of renal dysfunction, and its relationship with plasma FGF23, phosphateto elongated secondary CPPs by a diagnostic company blinded to the clinical data (Calciscon, Nidau-Biel, Switzerland). Intact FGF23 was measured in EDTA plasma using a validated ELISA assay (Kainos Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan). Serum T 50 values among the three groups were compared using one-way ANOVA with post-test for linear trend. Correlations between serum T 50 and plasma FGF23, phosphate, total calcium, magnesium, and total protein concentrations, and calcium phosphate product were assessed with Spearman's rank correlation (r s ). The mean T 50 value was 250 (standard deviation [SD], 58.4) minutes in non-azotemic cats, 204 (SD, 66.5) minutes in cats with IRIS stage 2 CKD, and 119 (SD, 51.5) minutes in cats with IRIS stage 3 CKD. Mean T 50 was different among groups (P = 0.037) with a significant linear trend (P = 0.011), indicating that serum calcification propensity increased in groups with worsening kidney function. Serum T 50 was inversely correlated with plasma FGF23 (r s = -0.63; P = 0.003) and total protein (r s = -0.53; P = 0.017), but did not correlate significantly with plasma creatinine (r s = -0.42; P = 0.069), phosphate (r s = -0.34; P = 0.146), total calcium (r s = -0.23; P = 0.341), calcium phosphate product (r s = -0.27; P = 0.250), or magnesium (r s = 0.27; P = 0.258).These preliminary data suggest serum of cats loses its intrinsic properties to inhibit calcification with declining renal function. The velocity with which serum calcified was inversely associated with plasma FGF23 and total protein concentrations, which may suggest that dysregulation of mineral metabolism and chronic inflammation are underlying mechanisms of soft tissue calcification in cats. Further research in a larger population of cats is needed to confirm our findings and assess the prognostic value of serum calcification propensity in cats with CKD.",

Hokamp The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), a disease caused by irreversible podocyte injury, is an important cause of proteinuria in dogs and humans. It is the most common non-immune complex glomerulopathy in dogs and has a previously reported prevalence of approximately 20 % in dogs biopsied for suspected glomerular disease, with females being over-represented. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively characterize the clinical presentation and prognosis of FSGS in dogs. Clinical and histopathological data and cause of death were obtained by reviewing the records of dogs diagnosed with FSGS on renal biopsies submitted to the International Veterinary Renal Pathology Service (IVRPS) between January 2015 and May 2017. FSGS is a disease characterized by an absence of immune -complex deposits and the presence of a segmental consolidation of the glomerulus by extracellular matrix; it is often associated with adhesions to Bowman';s capsule and hyalinosis. Kaplan Meier survival analysis with log -rank test was used to determine whether International Renal Interest Society (IRIS) stage, urine protein : creatinine ratio (UPC), presence of severe hypoalbuminemia (< 2 g / dL), ascites or edema at biopsy, history of hypertension (HT), or percentage of global glomerulosclerosis (GS) on biopsy were associated with death from renal disease or any cause. A two -sample test of proportion was used to assess the significance of the male : female distribution.Of 299 dogs with renal biopsies submitted to IVRPS with proteinuria during the study period, 77 (26 %) were diagnosed with FSGS. Median age was 9.5 years at biopsy (range 2.3 -14.8 years), and 48 (62 %) of dogs were female (p = 0.04). Median serum creatinine concentration was 1.2 mg / dL (range 0.3 -8.7 mg / dL).

We are investigating the impact of postprandial time on the specificity of urine calcium:creatine (UCa:Cr) in identifying affected dogs. The hypotheses are: 1) Significant differences exist in fasted and postprandial UCa:Cr between urolith-forming and control schnauzers. 2) UCa:Cr increases significantly from fasted baseline at one or more postprandial time point(s). Urine samples are being collected from Miniature Schnauzers with (urolith-formers) and without (controls) CaOx uroliths in a fasted state and 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours after feeding a standardized diet. The change in UCa:Cr from baseline was calculated for each postprandial time. Urolithiasis status and the time point were assessed for impact on the UCa:Cr and change in UCa:Cr using a mixed model ANOVA. Based on 7 urolith-forming and 12 control dogs enrolled thus far, urolith-forming Miniature Schnauzers have significantly higher mean UCa:Cr at 1 hour, 4 hours and 8 hours postprandial timepoints indicating altered calciuresis. The change in UCa:Cr was not significant at any post-prandial time point between or within groups. Urolith forming Miniature Schnauzers have excessive calciuresis, providing insight into the mechanism behind their formation of CaOx uroliths. If using the Ca:Cr ratio, the postprandial sampling time is not critical. This simple urine measurement has potential as a marker of urolith presence and possibly risk of urolith formation.",

Increased genetic expression of hypoxia-induced mediators of fibrosis has been demonstrated in CKD of non-feline species. The objective of this study was to characterize the expression of hypoxia-induced mediators of fibrosis in banked renal tissues from cats with experimental CKD. We hypothesized that cats with experimental CKD would have increased intrarenal expression of these mediators when compared to control cats. This pilot study included bilateral renal tissue samples from 6 cats having previously undergone temporary unilateral renal ischemia as a model of CKD and from 8 healthy cats (control group). For the CKD model group, tissues from both the ischemic kidney (IK group) and the contralateral, non-ischemic kidney (NIK group) were evaluated. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to characterize the tissue expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1, vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 7 (MMP-2 and MMP-7), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1), and transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21). Statistically significant differences in gene expression among groups were observed (all P-values < 0.045). VEGF-A was downregulated in both the IK and NIK groups, compared to the control group. Conversely, the MMPs, TIMP and TGF-\u03b21 were upregulated in CKD tissues: MMP-2, MMP-7 and TGF-\u03b21 were upregulated in the IK group only, and TIMP-1 was upregulated in both the IK and NIK groups. Dysregulation of major pathways of renal fibrosis was identified in experimental feline CKD. Future studies investigating these pathways in naturally occurring CKD may identify new therapeutic targets for this highly prevalent disease.

Dogs underwent extensive medical evaluation and LTUT was performed. In short, the thermoplasty probe was positioned in the proximal urethra via fluoroscopic guidance. Heating of the periurethral tissue was performed in 4 different planes for a total of 64 treatment sites per dog. The treating clinician and owner completed serial questionnaires and incontinence diaries.Three large breed (23-29 kg) female dogs with naturally occurring UI have been treated. LTUT was performed successfully in each case without significant complication (no leakage or stricture). Follow-up time for the 3 dogs ranges between 3-12 months. Owners reported pre-procedure incontinence scores of 3.5-5 (0 = severely incontinent; 10 = no incontinence), with improvements in score post-LTUT to 9-10 in all dogs. The impact of UI on owner quality of life decreased from between 7-9 (0 = no impact; 10 = constant source of concern) to 0-3 post-LTUT.LTUT was well tolerated in treated dogs, with improvement in both incontinence and owner quality of life scores.

As overweight dogs exhibit postprandial hyperlipidemia it is of interest to identify specific metabolite changes. This study aimed to investigate postprandial metabolites related to lipid metabolism in a feed-challenge test and to identify alterations related to overweight in dogs. Twenty-eight healthy male Labrador Retriever dogs were included, 12 of which were classified as lean (body condition score (BCS) 4-5 on a 9-point scale) and 16 as overweight (BCS 6-8). After overnight fasting, plasma samples were collected and dogs were fed a high-fat meal followed by postprandial plasma sample collection hourly for 4 hours. High-resolution liquid chromatographymass spectrometry (LC-ToF-MS) was used, and selected metabolites were evaluated based on relative signal areas in mixed model repeated measures analysis. In all dogs, propionylcarnitine and stearoylcarnitine increased in response to food intake (P \u2264 0.005) while the metabolite C18:1 decreased (P = 0.0003), resembling findings in humans. The overall taurine, carnitine and acetylcarnitine responses were lower in overweight compared to lean dogs (P \u2264 0.017). Notably, in lean dogs the acetylcarnitine signal area was higher than in overweight dogs at fasting (P = 0.001) and was decreased one hour postprandially (P < 0.0001), while in overweight dogs there was no response to feeding. In conclusion, the lower signal areas of taurine and carnitine in overweight dogs suggest the possibility of deficiencies in this group. Moreover, the acetylcarnitine pattern in overweight dogs could indicate decreased fatty acid oxidation at fasting and metabolic inflexibility to food intake.",

This quantitative study examined the mediating role of communication on the relationship between satisfaction and loyalty (attitudinal and behavioral) in veterinary clinics, along with the moderating roles of trust, commitment, perceived value, and relational characteristics. Responses collected from 351 pet-owners through social media were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The results show that attitudinal loyalty (AL) has a strong positive relationship with communication at multiple points in a veterinary clinic whereas the relationship with behavioral loyalty was not as clear. Additional findings suggest that AL, which is influenced by trust in the veterinarian, communication from staff members and commitment, has a strong positive relationship with behavioral intentions, increases the number of products and services that a pet-owner consumes at his or her primary veterinary clinic, and attenuates the role of cost in receiving veterinary care. The youngest and oldest cohorts in the study exhibited the lowest levels of AL, while pet-owners who see the same veterinarian at each visit have higher AL than those who do not. A set of recommendations is made for each communication point within a veterinary clinic to improve AL. These findings can help veterinary clinic owners and managers in developing and implementing relationship strategies that improve pet-owner loyalty.",

Anecdotally, glutathione precursors (e.g. S-adenosylmethionine) may ameliorate hepatotoxicity induced by itraconazole in dogs. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of glutathione on itraconazole-induced cytotoxicity in an in vitro cell model. Canine hepatocytes in suspension (1.0 x 10 5 cells/ml) were treated with combinations of itraconazole (0, 2, 10, 50 \u03bcM) and reduced glutathione (0, 10, 100, 1000 \u03bcM). Cytotoxicity was determined at 0.5, 3, and 6 hours of incubation using a commercial lactate dehydrogenase assay, which measures leakage of intracellular enzyme from dead cells. Differences in % cytotoxicity were assessed by ANOVA. Without glutathione, % cytotoxicity increased over time at all concentrations of itraconazole (p = 0.0001 -0.0060). Similarly, % cytotoxicity was increased at higher concentrations of itraconazole compared to lower concentrations at all time points (p = 0.0001 -0.0078). At 6 hours, glutathione demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in % cytotoxicity in cells treated with 2 \u03bcM itraconazole (p = 0.0333), but this effect was not seen at earlier time points (0.5 and 3 hours) or higher concentrations of the drug (10 and 50 \u03bcM). These findings suggest that glutathione may decrease lowdose, itraconazole-induced cytotoxicity in canine hepatocytes. Prospective clinical studies are needed to determine whether glutathione precursors are useful in the treatment or prevention of itraconazoleinduced hepatotoxicity in dogs. Additionally, these results establish dose-and time-dependent cytotoxicity of itraconazole in canine hepatocytes in vitro, which may be a useful model for studying the pathogenesis of this adverse drug reaction.",

Paes 1 S\u00e3o Paulo State University (Unesp), School of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, Botucatu, Botucatu, Sao Paulo, Brazil, 2 S\u00e3o Paulo State University, Botucatu, Sao Paulo, BrazilDistemper is an important infectious disease and in endemic regions, such as Brazil, the number of dog deaths caused by the canine distemper virus (CDV) have been increasing. As a multi-host pathogen, its death toll has also reached a wide range of carnivore species, causing mass mortalities of wildlife worldwide. It has also been considered reemergent in countries where it has already been controlled. In Finland, where distemper had been previously controlled, a case report of a 3-month-old pup naturally infected with distemper virus was published in 2016. Recently, a letter was published warning colleagues about the risk of re-emergence of canine distemper in the UK.It has been proven that the virus has important histopathologic effects over the cardiovascular system although that has been scarcely researched. The present study evaluated the virus';s activity on the heart of 9 naturally infected dogs with the help of echocardiography, electrocardiography and Holter examinations. Distemper diagnosis was confirmed with a positive PCR test and data collected was compared to nine healthy dogs. In agreement with the hypothesis that there is influence of the distemper virus over the cardiovascular system, this study found that the CDV affects directly or indirectly the excitatory and specialized conduction system of the heart. As described inTable 1, Holter evaluation of distemper infected dogs revealed a decrease in heart rate variability and absence of arrhythmias.

Effects on the modulation of heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP), antiarrhythmic and hypolipidemic activity are also reported. However, clinical studies have not yet been performed evaluating its effects in dogs with MVD.It was proposed in this prospective study to evaluate the possible Systemic hypertension is a persistent increase in blood pressure which is a health problem associated with target organ damage (TOD). Systolic blood pressure (SBP) is classified based on the risk for future TOD as defined by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) hypertension consensus statement and the International of those on ARBs and 43% (6 of 14) of those on CCBs with ACEIs.In conclusion, antihypertensive drug classes have differentiated effects on short-term blood pressure variability, with a greater reduction in dogs treated with CCBs and ARBs. The combinations of CCBs and ARBs may be the most efficient treatment for lowering SBP in high risk hypertensive patients.The aim of this study is to report the evidence of both macroscopic and histopathological findings compatible with myocarditis in six naturally infected dogs with Dirofilaria immitis. The cases were collected retrospectively from a private veterinary clinic located in Barranquilla.Macro and microscopic changes were visible in all of the evaluated hearts. The most significant macroscopic finding was diffuse whiteyellow areas in all the epicardium, these changes were more severe in the right side of the heart (n=4). Also in 4 of the cases the epicardium had a large area of red color surrounding the left circumflex coronary artery. When the dissection was performed in 4 cases yellow and white spots appeared in the right atrium and the endocardium presented hemorrhagic zones in the tricuspid valve. In 2 cases endocardial hemorrhagic zones were observed in the left atrium near the mitral valve, additionally in one case at the level of the mitral valve a black spot was observed near the septal leaflet. The histopathological findings included an acute diffuse myocarditis (n=3), acute myocarditis with infarction and parasitic thrombi (n=1), active chronic myocarditis (n=1), necrotizing myocarditis (n=1). This study reports 6 cases of myocarditis in dogs with Dirofilaria immitis were not only the right side of the heart was shown to be affected but also the left side in dogs without pulmonary hypertension or right congestive heart failure.Luis F. Dos Santos, Katherine F. Scollan, Nicole L. LeBlanc, Milan Milovancev, Katy L. Townsend, Michael J. Huber Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA Ventricular septal defects (VSD) are common congenital defects in cats and horses. Large defects may cause left-sided volume overload, left-sided congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and an anticipated poor long-term prognosis. Pulmonary artery banding (PAB) has been reported as a palliative surgical option for hemodynamically consequential VSDs in cats and dogs. PAB surgery results in increased right ventricular systolic pressures, thus decreasing the pressure gradient across the VSD and subsequent shunting volume. There is minimal data in the veterinary literature assessing long-term outcomes following PAB surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term outcomes and peri-operative mortality rate of animals who underwent PAB surgery at the Oregon State University Veterinary Teaching For the surgical procedure, all patients had a left lateral thoracotomy. Umbilical tape was used in the 4 cats for the PAB, while #2 nylon suture was used in the pony. Median surgical time was 2 hours (range oxidative phosphorylation is the preferred method of energy generation because of the higher levels of ATP it yields. gous (PDK4 wt/del ) or homozygous (PDK4 del/del ) for the PDK4 mutation displayed significantly reduced oxygen consumption rate, decreased cell viability, mitochondrial stress, and activation of the intrinsic (mitochondrial mediated) apoptotic pathway under conditions of high (unstarved) and low (starved) nutrient availability in vitro. Following treatment with with an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-PDK4, cells were again starved, and re-evalatued. PDK4 wt/del and PDK4 del/del treated cells showed a significant improvement in their mitochondrial function and increased viability in the starved condition compared to the cells that were not treated with the AAV-PDK4. The restoration of function of cells observed following administration of AAV-PDK4 provides strong support for the translation of this gene therapy approach into the clinical realm for PDK4-affected Dobermans.correlation existed between AoSA and murmur grade.

Furthermore, regardless of the state of the preoperative patient, PaO2 was finally improved in all cases and it was considered possible to maintain oxygenation appropriately.Compared with the preoperative day, BUN and Cre were significantly lower in both groups after surgery, on the first day after surgery and at discharge. BUN in the HD group was significantly lower at the first day, the third day, and the one month postoperatively compared to the non-HD group.

We examined ambulatory electrocardiographic (Holter) recordings from 98 Rhodesian Ridgebacks that were reported to be asymptomatic by their owners. Recordings with at least 20 hours of data were evaluated for the presence of ventricular and supraventricular ectopy. The number of ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) / 24 hours and complexity of ectopy were quantified; dogs that experienced more than 2 VPCs / 24 hours were considered to be abnormal. Complexity of ventricular ectopy was graded as follows: grade 1, isolated, uniform VPCs; grade 2, bigeminy or trigeminy; grade 3, couplets or triplets; grade 4, R on T or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia; there were no dogs with sustained ventricular tachycardia. Fifty-four of 95 dogs examined (24 male, 30 female) had 2 or fewer VPCs/24 hours, and no supraventricular ectopy; they ranged in age from 3 -39 months (median 8 months). Forty-one dogs (16 male, 1 male castrated, 24 female) had 3 or more VPCs/24 hours. They were not statistically different in age (median 12 months, range 3 -32 months) and experienced a median number of 53 VPCs / 24 hours (range 3 -29,673). Complexity grades ranged from 1 -4. Two dogs also had frequent supraventricular premature complexes.

However, there is currently no point-of-care test that can identify cats at risk for ATE. NT-proBNP concentrations may be helpful in identification of cats that might develop ATE. The goal of this retrospective study was to compare NT-proBNP concentrations in cats with cardiomyopathy that had or developed ATE within 1 year of NT-proBNP testing to cats that did not develop ATE within 1 year. Medical records were searched for cats with any form of cardiomyopathy that had NT-proBNP testing. Cats were classified into 3 groups: cats with occult cardiomyopathy (OCM group), cats with cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure without ATE (CHF group), and cats with cardiomyopathy that had or developed an ATE (ATE group).Eighty-six cats were enrolled. Cats in both the CHF and ATE groups (P < 0.001) had significantly higher NT-proBNP concentrations than those in the OCM group; however, concentrations were not different between the CHF and ATE groups. An ROC curve was generated using the NT-proBNP concentrations of the ATE and OCM groups (AUC 0.96, 95% confidence interval: 0.914 -1.000, P < 0.001). Youden';s index (J) estimated the optimal NT-proBNP cutoff point at490.5 pmol/L (Sensitivity = 96.2%, Specificity = 90.6%). Dividing all cats using this cutoff point, cats with NT-proBNP concentrations > 491 pmol/L had a larger left atrium, thicker left ventricle, and lower fractional shortening.

Molecular and serological indications of EqHV infection have never been reported in equids on the African continent. Therefore, investigation of EqHV prevalence in South African horses and subsequent viral genetic characterisation would contribute to understanding global epidemiology of this emerging virus.",

Beard, Ram K. Raghavan, Ashley R. Deforno, Elizabeth G. Davis Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, USA Leptospirosis is a worldwide veterinary and public health concern, and emerging infectious disease of horses. The spirochete can be directly transmitted by contaminated urine, placental fluids, semen, infected tissues, reservoir hosts, or flood waters. Seroprevalence and infecting serovar vary with geography, yet diagnosis using the gold standard microscopic agglutination test (MAT) merely confirms high exposure rate. Subclinical infection can complicate diagnosis. The aims of this study were to use quantitative PCR on urine from apparently healthy horses to determine period prevalence of Leptospiral shedding and to correlate these findings with MAT results to establish associations with client based survey data regarding horse management and environment. Serum and free-catch urine were collected from 204 healthy horses between May 2016 -December 2017. Serum was used to determine GGT, creatinine concentrations, and six serovar MAT (Canicola, Hardjobovis, Icterhemorrhaegiae, Pomona, Grippotyphysa, Bratislava). Urine samples were submitted for PCR testing of Leptospiral DNA. Client consent and survey data were collected for all subjects. Potential risk factors included drinking water source, exposure to livestock and dogs, geographical location, season, and precipitation. Two horses were positive on urine PCR for leptospirosis (shedding prevalence 1%), yet only 1 had a high MAT titer (> 1:800). Both horses were negative on urine PCR one month later without treatment. Apparently healthy horses infrequently shed Leptospira spp. in urine, yet seroreactivity in clinically normal horses is high (77%), confirming high exposure rates to Leptospira spp. in the Central Midwest. Further studies should target serovar specific PCR tests and incorporate PCR testing in horses clinically affected with leptospirosis. Diego Gomez-Nieto 1 , Luis Arroyo 2 , Brandon Lillie 3 , J.

The FSEC colony consists of large multigenerational pedigrees with multiple cases. The mode of inheritance is undetermined since the cats have different clinical pre-sentations. The aim of this study was to identify loci that influence susceptibility to epilepsy using genetic association analyses.Eighty-one cats, including affected and unaffected, from the FSEC colony and the kindred colony were genotyped using the illumina Infinium iSelect Feline 63K DNA array. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were remapped to feline genome assembly v9.0.Considering 78 cats, 14 trios, including nine with unaffected parents and one affected offspring and five trios with affected individuals were available for transmission disequilibrium tests (TDT). TDT indicated the strongest association of disease with SNPs on cat chromosome B3. SNPs were located between cat chromosome positions 120.2 to 121.6 Mb, however, genome-wide significance was not obtained. SNPs on cat chromosomes A3, B2, and D4 also indicated association. Among the SNPs with the strongest association, a gene encoding a zinc finger protein was present. Furthermore, several other potential candidate genes harboring the suggested region were detected. The analysis of the pedigree and the disease presentation in the FSECs, which includes spontaneous seizures, induced seizures or, abnormal electroencephalogram, suggest this form of epilepsy may have a co-dominant mode of inheritance. Although TDT did not reach significance, other methods such as linkage analysis and whole genome sequencing may provide additional support.

Each dog was evaluated by all three investigators on the same day with both evaluator and limb test order randomized and testing sessions separated by 5 minutes.Mean ST values were averaged for all four limbs to produce a single value per dog for comparison between evaluators. Agreement between evaluators was determined using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC; two-way model for consistency, single measures).ICC across all three evaluators was 0.48, indicating moderate agreement. Moderate interobserver agreement is likely not sufficient to support the use of this technique in multi-center clinical trials, and our results underscore the importance of using a single evaluator for this QST technique in canine neuropathic pain studies.Trace Elemental Profiles of Serum and Cerebrospinal Fluid in Dogs with Idiopathic EpilepsyKazuyoshi Sasaoka 1 , Hiroshi Ohta 1 , Hazuki Mizukawa 2 , Shouta Nakayama 2 , Noboru Sasaki 1 , Keitaro Morishita 1 , Yoshinori Ikenaka 2 , Mayumi Ishizuka 2 , Mitsuyoshi Takiguchi 1 Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan, 2 Department of Environmental Veterinary Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan Idiopathic epilepsy (IE) is a chronic brain disease which causes epileptic seizure. In human, serum and CSF trace elemental profiles were changed in IE patients. Previous studies suggested that supplementation of trace elements can improve refractory IE in human. Currently, there has been no reports about trace elemental profiles in dogs with IE. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine trace elemental profiles in IE dogs. Dogs with IE were recruited between June 2016 and May 2017 at the Hokkaido University Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Thirty-nine healthy client-owned dogs and 5 laboratory beagles were used as serum controls and CSF controls, respectively. Serum and CSF trace element concentrations (copper, selenium, rubidium, molybdenum, tin, median [range]) were measured by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Trace element concentrations of IE dogs were compared with those of controls. IE dogs were classified as responders or non-responders by the response to anti-epileptic drugs 6 months later the starting treatment. Trace element concentrations of responders were compared with those of non-responders. Ten dogs with IE were enrolled in this study. Dogs with IE had significantly lower serum tin concentration (IE, 0.48 [0.38-0.77] \u03bcg/dL; control, 0.59 [0.42-1.04] \u03bcg/dL), higher CSF copper concentration (IE, 3.61 [2.88-4.68] \u03bcg/dL; control, 2.28 [2.07-2.76] \u03bcg/dL) and higher CSF selenium concentration (IE, 13.6 [4.33-21.9] \u03bcg/dL; control, 0.98 [0.38-0.77] \u03bcg/dL). There were no significant differences in trace element concentrations between responders and non-responders. However, a dog with severe refractory seizure showed lowest serum tin concentration (0.38 \u03bcg/dL) and high CSF copper concentration (4.36 \u03bcg/dL).These results indicated that serum and CSF trace elemental profiles in IE dogs were different from those in healthy dogs. Further studies should be conducted to clarify the correlation between responsiveness to anti-epileptic drugs and trace elemental profiles.",

            "text": "Cytokeratin 18 (CK18) is a member of the intermediate filament family of cytoskeletal proteins and is highly expressed in epithelial cells, notably gastrointestinal mucosal epithelium. Epithelial cells undergoing necrosis and/or apoptosis release full-length or caspase-cleaved CK18 fragments that are detectable in bodily fluids such as serum and plasma. In humans, circulating levels of CK18 have been shown to have potential clinical utility as non-invasive prognostic or predictive biomarkers in a number of solid and hematopoietic tumor types. Data from human lymphoma studies indicate that serum CK18 levels increase following cytotoxic chemotherapy and that high CK18 expression correlates with patients experiencing epithelial toxicity, suggesting that circulating CK18 may have potential utility as predictive biomarker for early gastrointestinal toxicity. Given the lack of clinically relevant biomarkers for the early detection of GI toxicity in veterinary patients receiving anti-cancer drugs, the objective of our study was to determine plasma CK18 levels in dogs with cutaneous and subcutaneous mast cell tumors (MCTs) receiving single-agent toceranib therapy as a reference for understanding the relevance of any changes for the detection of early GI toxicity. Blood was collected from 20 healthy dogs > 1 year of age with no medical history of gastrointestinal disease or recent gastrointestinal signs including vomiting and diarrhea, to establish a reference range for plasma CK18 levels in healthy control animals. Twenty five clientowned dogs with a histopathological diagnosis of cutaneous or subcutaneous MCTs and no evidence of gross and/or metastatic disease at the time of evaluation were enrolled. Patients were treated with toceranib (2.75 mg/kg EOD) and received Omeprazole (1 mg/kg SID). No dogs received concurrent prednisone and/or other concomitant medications. Plasma was collected from treatment dogs at day 0, day 7, day 14, day 21, and day 28.Clients were instructed to record any gastrointestinal or other clinical signs over the 28 day period. Drugrelated adverse events (AEs) were defined and graded according to the published VCOG-CTCAE criteria. Plasma CK18 measurements were obtained for control dogs and treated dogs at all study timepoints using a commercially available canine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit to detect CK18 (NeoBiolab). Determination of plasma VEGF concentrations in treated dogs was performed at all timepoints using a canine VEGF Quantikine ELISA kit (R & D Systems)as a surrogate biomarker of pathway inhibition by toceranib. Preliminary data indicate that baseline plasma CK18 levels are increased in dogs with a diagnosis of cutaneous or subcutaneous MCT compared to healthy control animals. Interestingly, while baseline CK18 levels were elevated in treated dogs, we observed a decline in CK18 levels over the period of the study with plasma CK18 concentrations appearing to plateau over days 14 to 21. No changes in plasma CK18were correlated with toceranib-related adverse effects and/or grade.However, of the dogs experiencing gastrointestinal toxicity, most were mild. 14 dogs experienced a grade I gastrointestinal toxicity. 7 experienced a grade II toxicity, while only 1 experienced a grade III toxicity. No patients experienced a grade IV or greater gastrointestinal toxicity during the study. Despite the small number of subjects assessed in the current study, these data suggest that plasma CK18 is not a suitable biomarker for the early detection of toceranib-related gastrointestinal toxicity in dogs. However, further investigations to fully assess the predictive value of circulating CK18 detecting early GI toxicity in a larger cohort of patients is required.Comprehensive Analysis of Gene Mutations in Canine Histiocytic Sarcoma by Whole Exome SequencingHajime Asada 1 , Takao Uchikai 2 , Hirotaka Tomiyasu 1 , Genki Ishihara 2 , Yuko Goto-Koshino 1 , Koichi Ohno 3 , Hajime Tsujimoto3 1",

            "text": "To better understand the diagnostic value of positive HW screening results in low-prevalence areas such as California, in-clinic SNAP\u00ae4Dx\u00ae Plus Test HW antigen test results collected from 2013 to 2016 were compared for both Scandinavia, where virtually no autochthonous transmission of HW is believed to occur, and California. Although positive test results in Scandinavian clinics may be due to infections acquired elsewhere, to be conservative we considered all positive HW test results from Scandinavian clinics to be false positives. The observed specificity was therefore defined as the proportion of Scandinavia SNAP\u00ae 4Dx\u00ae Plus HW tests that returned a negative result. Duplicate tests for a single patient within a given year were removed from the dataset prior to analysis. Using the observed Scandinavian specificity, prevalence data from the Companion Animal Parasite Council (www.capcvet.org), and the stated test sensitivity, we calculated the positive predictive values in California counties using standard methodology based on Bayes theorem. Confidence intervals for all proportions were calculated using the USDA-recommended Clopper-Pearson exact method. SNAP\u00ae 4Dx\u00ae Plus HW antigen test results from 190 veterinary clinics in Finland, Norway, and Sweden were analyzed to determine the observed test specificity. Of the 14,778 Scandinavian tests results analyzed, 18 were positive for HW antigen giving a positive rate of 0.12% (95% CI: 0.07% to 0.19%) and an observed specificity of 99.88% (95% CI: 99.81% to 99.93%). For the same period, 301,997 SNAP\u00ae 4Dx\u00ae Plus HW antigen test results were identified from 476 California veterinary clinics representing 46 counties. Of these, 1,742 were positive for HW antigen for a positive rate of 0.58% (95% CI: 0.55%-0.60%). The positive rate for the SNAP\u00ae 4Dx\u00ae Plus HW test in California was found to be significantly higher than the rate observed in Scandinavia by chi-square test (P < 0.001). Therefore, the higher than expected rate of SNAP\u00ae 4Dx\u00ae Plus HW test positives cannot be solely attributed to a lack of specificity (false positives) but strongly suggests the actual presence of Dirofilaria immitis in California. This aligns with recent studies which reported HW infection among coyote and mosquito populations within California [Huang et al., J Med Entomol. 2013 Nov;50(6):1315-23]. Additionally, significant variation in HW positive rates were observed between counties within California. Of 53 California counties with at least 30 results reported to CAPC during the study period, all had at least one dog test positive to HW. From 2013-2016, Madera County had the highest SNAP\u00ae 4Dx\u00ae Plus Test HW positive rate (9.06%, 63%, n=588). The overall PPV of the SNAP\u00ae 4Dx\u00ae Plus Test for HW in California was estimated at 82.02% and was well above 50% for all counties with a between-county range of 67.32-98.04%. The results from this study support that any HW-positive test results on the SNAP\u00ae 4Dx\u00ae Plus Test, due to its high specificity, are highly probable to be true positives. Therefore, it is important for veterinarians in low prevalence regions of California and other areas of the United States to adhere to American Heartworm Society guidelines and confirm unexpected test results by retesting with an ancillary rapid test (such as the SNAP\u00ae Heartworm RT Test) or reference laboratory test (such as the PetChek\u00ae Heartworm PF Antigen Test).",

Since comparative studies in cats have not been reported, the purpose of this study was to determine the proportional morbidity of causes and assess outcomes of cats with urinary incontinence presented to the Michigan State University Veterinary Medical Center (MSUVMC). Medical records of cats presented to the MSUVMC from 2006 to 2017 were searched electronically using 47 keywords related to urinary incontinence. Cats were included if they had a diagnosis of urinary incontinence based on owner history or physical examination. Cats with insufficient information to confirm a diagnosis were excluded. Thirty-nine of 22,646 (0.17%) cats met inclusion criteria. Affected cats included 20 castrated males, 1 intact male, and 18 spayed females. Median age at onset of clinical signs was 4.0 years (range 1 month to 17 years). Most affected cats were mixed breed (35/39).

Hyperparathyroidism was ruled out in two hypercalcemic cats. It is possible that the cause of hypercalcemia may be associated with decreased degradation of 25(OH)D 3 as supported by the lower 24,25(OH) 2 D 3 concentrations. Alternatively, low 24,25(OH) 2 D 3 could result from less substrate provided for catabolism since hypercalcemic cats had lower concentrations of 25(OH) 2 D 3 than normocalcemic cats. Based on traditional understanding of normal calcium regulation, it seems paradoxical that hypercalcemia would be associated with lower 25(OH)D 3 and 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 concentrations than that in cats with normocalcemia.Further studies with larger numbers of cats are needed to support these findings as well as to investigate whether proteinuria may lead to a greater loss of vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP) in urine that could contribute to 25(OH)D 3 deficiency.Evaluation of an Herbal Compound Used to Manage Lower Urinary Tract Disease in Healthy CatsCook F.

In conclusion, the evaluation of serum SDMA concomitantly with serum creatinine could add important information in order to verify the real renal dysfunction, mainly in those CKD dogs classified as stage 3 by means of serum creatinine concentrations, and that information may help and alert to determine treatment and prognosis.

The objectives of the current study were to determine the prevalence, clinical signs, causes and risk factors for FLUTD. The medical records of 3486 cats visiting Chiang Mai University Small Animal Veterinary Teaching Hospital between November 2016 to October 2017 were reviewed. Ninety-three cats with FLUTD were identified. A case-control study was performed to determine risk factors for FLUTD in 74 FLUTD cats and randomly selected 74 clinically normal cats. For each animal, potential risk data obtained from medical records and cat owners'; interviews were analyzed for associations with FLUTD. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate odds ratios and to adjust for expected confounding factors. The prevalence of FLUTD in cats in Chiang Mai was 2.7% (95%CI: 2.1 -3.2). The most common clinical signs identified were urethral obstruction (56.9%), hematuria (23.6%), stranguria (16.7%), and pollakiruria (15.3%), respectively. The most common diagnoses were feline idiopathic cystitis (FIC) (57%), followed by urolithiasis (struvite) (19%), and urinary tract infection (UTI) (12%), respectively. The multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that FLUTD was more likely to be diagnosed in castrated male cats. In conclusion, FIC and urolithiasis are the most common diagnoses in cat with FLUTD and castration of male cats may be the important risk factor for FLUTD.

Platelet Aggregometry and Measurement of Clopidogrel Metabolite Concentrations in Dogs with Protein-Losing Nephropathy Sarah Shropshire, Tyler Johnson, Christine Olver Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA Dogs with protein-losing nephropathy (PLN) are commonly prescribed drugs for thromboprophylaxis but there is no standardized method to measure response to these medications. Additionally, it is unknown if clopidogrel metabolite concentrations differ between PLN dogs and dogs without renal disease. The purpose of this study was to assess response to aspirin or clopidogrel in dogs with PLN using whole blood impedance platelet aggregometry (PA) and to compare clopidogrel metabolite concentrations between healthy and PLN dogs.",

Czarnecki 1 , Janet R. Jackson 2 1 Nestle Purina Research, St. Louis, MO, USA, 2 Nestle Purina, St. Louis, MO, USA Urine has traditionally been regarded as a sterile fluid. Culture independent techniques have allowed for further exploration of various body sites, including the bladder. Researchers have shown that a urinary microbiome exists in other species, including healthy dogs. This study aimed to characterize the urinary microbiome of healthy adult cats. Urine was collected via cystocentesis from 15 healthy adult domestic shorthair cats showing no signs of urinary tract infection. Cats used in this study included 9 neutered males and 6 spayed females with an average age of 8.3 years, and an average body weight of 4.8 kg. Bacterial genomic DNA was extracted using methods specifically for low-biomass samples. The V4 region was amplified by PCR and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform and compared to the SILVA Database. A rarefaction cutoff of 460 reads per sample was used and 202 OTUs were detected. The major phyla (relative abundance) in the urine samples included Proteobacteria (49.7 %), Firmicutes (32.8 %), Actinobacteria (8.9 %), Bacteroidetes (4.1 %), and Cyanobacteria (1.3 %). Identified genera were highly variable among cats. Staphylococcus spp. was the only genus present in all 18 samples. Other genera present in over half of cats included Enterobacter spp. (n = 13), Acinetobacter spp. (n = 13), Streptococcus spp. (n = 12), Shigella spp. (n = 12), and Acinetobacter spp. (n = 10). Relative abundance of these genera varied widely among cats. Similar to reports in other species, cats do have a urinary microbiome even with no signs of a clinical infection; however, what constitutes a healthy urinary microbiome is currently unknown. Daily Oral Chondroitin Sulfate Administration Increases Urinary Chondroitin Sulfate Concentrations in Dogs MICHAEL Wood University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA In healthy individuals urinary chondroitin sulfate helps prevent uropathogenic bacterial adherence to the bladder wall. In people exogenous chondroitin sulfate/hyaluronic acid administered intravesicularly reduced yearly urinary tract infection recurrence 10 fold. In dogs similar bladder instillation therapy is impractical requiring regular catheterization and extended bladder dwell times. Alternatively chondroitin sulfate is a common veterinary dietary supplement. The described study aimed to determine whether daily oral chondroitin sulfate administration increased canine urinary chondroitin sulfate concentrations (uCS). This study enrolled 8 client owned dogs. Urine samples collected for 5 consecutive days (days 1-5) established baseline uCS. Dogs then received 20-30mg/kg twice daily of chondroitin sulfate for 8 days (days 8-15) with urine samples collected on days 8-12 and 15. uCS was quantified in \u03bcg/ml using high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Variable urine output, and hence uCS dilution, was accounted for by dividing measured uCS by urine creatinine (uCS:uCrea). Treatment and baseline uCS:uCrea were compared to calculate the fold change in urinary chondroitin sulfate excretion after supplementation.Oral chondroitin sulfate supplementation increased mean uCS:uCrea 1.81x (p = 0.02). No difference in uCS was observed when comparing the first (day 8) and last (day 15) supplementation days (p = 0.08).These data indicate that oral chondroitin sulfate supplementation increases uCS. The increase occurs within 24h and is not additive such that intravesicular instillation concentrations are not achieved. A therapeutic benefit of persistent low concentration chondroitin sulfate supplementation in preventing canine recurrent urinary tract infections is unknown and an on-going research focus.",

Auditory thresholds were determined by applying stimuli between 54-120 dB SPL. Moreover, stimuli of \u226555 dB SPL was considered as deaf while stimuli of \u226454 was considered as hearing. A total of 9 Angora cats (6 males and 3 females) were included in the study. Mean age was 22.8\u00b152.4 months-old (range:1.5-156). Of 9 Angora cats, 7 (77.7%) were unilateral deaf, and 2 (22.3%) were hearing. Of 7 unilateral deaf cats, 4 were males (3 right and 1 \"left\"-sided deaf ) and 3 were females (1 right and 2 \"left\"-sided deaf ). Of 4 unilateral deaf male cats, 2 were blue, 1 was blue-amber, and 1 was amber eye colors. Of 3 unilateral deaf female cats, 1 was blue, 1 was blue-amber, and 1 was amber eye colors.Remaining 2 cats with hearing were males with blue eye colors.Results of present study revealed that Angora cats have partial but not bilateral hereditary deafness. There is only one report available indicating 1 of 11 Angora cats had unilateral deafness while no bilateral deafness with BAER testing. 3 On the other hand, another study performed by behavioral testing in Angora cats reported 11% bilateral deafness. 4 As a conclusion, further epidemiologic studies should be performed in larger populations to determine the prevalence of uni-and/or bilateral hereditary deafness along with gender or eye color association.The adequate fluid resuscitation in hemorrhagic shock is essential to expand volume and improve global and regional oxygen delivery thus the proper fluid selection is important. Hypertonic saline with colloids was newly proposed for clinical use but its effect and optimal ratio were still in question. This study introduces 3% hydroxyethyl starchhypertonic saline (3% HHES) and compares to four conventional fluids (lactated Ringer';s solution (LRS), 6% hydroxyethyl starch (6% HES), 7% hypertonic saline (7% HS), and 7% hydroxyethyl starch-hypertonic saline (7% HHES) in dogs with experimental hemorrhage.Twelve healthy dogs were repeatedly used after full recovery at least twice. Dogs were bled to remain mean arterial blood pressure at 40 to 50 mmHg over 60 minutes and were resuscitated as in 5 groups: LRS (n=5); 6% HES (130:40) (n=5); 7% HS (n=5); 3% HHES (n=5) and 7% HHES (n=5). Intravascular volume expansion using Evans blue dye, cardiac output, stroke volume, preload (stroke volume variation, pulse pressure variation, central venous pressure) for hemodynamic indices and systemic oxygenation (oxygen extraction ratio, central venous oxygen saturation), lactate, base excess, electrolytes, and pH were monitored at baseline, after 60 minutes of hemorrhage, and 15, 30, 60, and 120 minutes after fluid resuscitation.
