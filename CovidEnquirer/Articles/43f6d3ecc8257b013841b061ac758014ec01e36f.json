The villi, projections of lamina propria covered by a layer of epithelium one cell thick, expand the absorptive surface of the small bowel 7-14-fold. In most species, villi are tallest in the duodenum, and decline somewhat in height toward the ileum.The length and shape of villi in \"normal\" animals vary with the species, age, intestinal microflora, and immune status. In general, villi in dogs, cats, neonatal piglets, and ruminants tend to be tall and cylindrical; those in horses and in young ruminants tend to be moderately tall and cylindrical; villi in weaned ruminants and swine may be cylindrical, leaf or tongue-shaped, or rarely ridgelike, with their broad surface at right angles to the long axis\" of the gut. Length of villi typically declines somewhat after weaning.",

These are straight or somewhat coiled (depending on the species and the proliferative status) tubular gland-like structures, lined by a single layer of epithelium. The progenitor compartment of the enteric epithelium resides here, producing cells that differentiate and move up on to the surface of villi, mainly as absorptive enterocytes, ultimately to be extruded as effete cells from the tips of villi. Sloughed cells contribute to the enzyme content and complexity of the intestinal luminal content. Stem cells are present in the crypts; depending on species and the position in the gastrointestinal tract, they are near or at the base of the crypt. They divide to produce four main lineages of cells. Poorly differentiated enterocytes, which are cuboidal or low columnar, with relatively few, short microvilli, are the predominant type of cell lining crypts. Especially in the lower half of crypts, these cells form a population that cycles rapidly, undergoing amplification division. One of the ensuing daughter cells usually differentiates and moves into the functional compartment of absorptive enterocytes on the villus. Undifferentiated crypt epithelial cells also secrete electrolytes and water.",

Intestinal mucus is a gel that lubricates and probably serves to \"insulate\" the surface from organisms, which it may entrap or immobilize. It contains trefoil factor, also produced by the goblet cell, which promotes epithelial restitution or gliding after erosion; lysozyme and defensins produced by Paneth cells; and immunoglobulin A secreted into it by epithelial cells. Goblet-cell hyperplasia and mucus secretion are promoted by a variety of noxious stimuli, by inflammatory mediators, and by cell-mediated immune events in the gut.

Chylomicrons enter the extracellular space, and leave the villus via the lacteal. The lamina propria, a highly plastic mesenchymal stroma, supports the epithelium of the small intestinal mucosa. It is composed of loose fibrous tissue, through which course blood vessels, and in which smooth-muscle, inflammatory, and immune-active cells are interspersed. In addition to functioning in defense against microorganisms, macrophages phagocytose inert particulate matter reaching the lamina propria from the lumen. Bile pigment, perhaps derived from meconium, is sometimes seen in macrophages in the tips of villi in neonates. Macrophages may become iron-laden and, by loss from the mucosa, may play a role in iron homeostasis.Apoptotic bodies, ceroid, hemosiderin, and bile pigment may also be present in histiocytes in the lamina propria at tips of villi, which are particularly prominent in horses, and should not be mistaken for foci of necrosis. These may represent detritus resulting in part from apoptosis of upwardly migrating subepithelial myofibroblasts at the villus tip.

The major cell populations in Peyer's patches appear to be B lymphocytes committed mainly to IgA production, while among the T cells is a large proportion ofT helper cell precursors. Antigen is processed and presented to lymphocytes in Peyer's patches largely by dendritic cells. The cytokine context within which dendritic cells function may determine whether, in response to presentation of a soluble antigen, they induce a persistent clone of activated lymphocytes, or it is deleted, causing tolerance. Alternatively, under some conditions dendritic cells may induce clones of regulatory suppressor T cells, mediating tolerance. Mesenteric lymph nodes play a crucial role in the induction of mucosal immunity and tolerance. Antigen presentation by dendritic cells trafficking to the nodes from the gut, or trapping antigen, perhaps associated with apoptotic enterocytes, draining via lymphatics, is more important than in Peyer's patches. Dendritic cells in the liver may also play a role in inducing tolerance. Macrophages are less common in Peyer's patches than in lamina propria, and their role in the interaction among M cells and T and B lymphocytes is unclear. They probably play an effector role in cell-mediated reactions to bacteria entering via Peyer's patches, and certainly in response to agents such as Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis and Histoplasma capsulatum, found in the lamina propria.",

They may also sample the environment by taking up antigen presented by enterocytes, or by phagocytosing apoptotic enterocytes. Macrophages and dendritic cells may present antigen to sensitize proprial lymphocytes, and promote cytokine production. Macrophages also sequester iron, inhibiting bacterial metabolism. Macrophages in colonic lamina propria are highly phagocytic, but have a low ability to activate T cells and promote T-cell-mediated immune responses. Proprial T cells are mixed CD4 + and CD8 +, most numerous between upper crypts and in the propria of villi, and are likely antigen-activated cells. Cytokine production by these cells is probably determined by the cytokine milieu, but evolution of interferon-y, tumor necrosis factor-or, and interleukins-1, -4, -5, -8 and -13, activating macrophages and promoting inflammation, are likely. IgA lymphoblasts leave the Peyer's patch for the mesenteric lymph node and, via the thoracic duct, the general circulation, whence they home on the intestinal mucosa and other mucosal surfaces, including the respiratory tract, mammary gland, and salivary glands. In the lamina propria of the intestine they differentiate into IgA-secretory plasma cells, found mainly in close apposition to columnar epithelium of the upper crypt. Dimeric IgA binds via the J chain to glycoprotein \"secretory component\" present on the basolateral border of columnar crypt epithelial cells.With secretory component, it is transported in vesicles through the cytoplasm to be released from the apical border of the cell into the lumen of the crypt. It then spreads over the intestinal surface, partly bound to mucus.",

The function of IgA in the gut lumen probably lies mainly in blocking attachment by bacteria and viruses to epithelial cells, neutralizing intraluminal toxins, and in limiting absorption of antigens originating in food and produced by microorganisms in the gut. It thereby reduces the likelihood of reaginic and other forms of immune response in the propria. Secretion into the bile, by hepatocytes, of lgA complexed with antigen may, in the species in which it occurs, be a significant means of clearing the circulation of antigen absorbed from the gut.

Epithelial kinetics have not been investigated in most of these situations in domestic animals. However, they all have in common chronic antigenic exposure, parasitism, or a persistent infectious process in the lumen, epithelium, or lamina propria, usually associated with a significant lymphocytic and plasmacytic infiltrate in the mucosa. Where the etiology can be eliminated, the lesion usually remits, implying that it requires active interaction between host and parasite for its induction and maintenance. The situation is entirely analogous to that of celiac disease in humans, which clearly is an immune-mediated response to specific dietary antigens, through activation of mucosal T cells secreting y-interferon, among other cytokines. Strong evidence implicates Th2 lymphocyte-driven nitric oxide production in the pathogenesis of villus atrophy in experimental helminth infections in mice.The source and effect of the nitric oxide are uncertain, as is its possible interaction with cytokines such as interleukin-12, interferon-y, and tumor necrosis factor-[3, also implicated in villus atrophy of this type in experimental models.T-cell activity seems to be associated with villus atrophy of this type in parasitisms such as giardiasis as well.",

During the second phase, the size of the circulating pool stabilizes as the rate of albumin synthesis by the liver increases to match in absolute terms the rate of loss. The plasma albumin pool is then in a state of hyperkinetic equilibrium; the pool is smaller, with a higher than normal fractional catabolic rate compensated by an increased rate of hepatic synthesis.

In the third phase, hypoalbuminemia develops as the fractional catabolic rate exceeds in absolute terms the synthetic capacity of the liver.Alternatively, hypoalbuminemia occurs in the third phase if the rate of synthesis declines, due to deficiency in amino acids derived from the diet and by catabolism of other body protein.",

In dogs, obstipation of the colon may be the result of voluntarily suppressed painful defecation, as in prostatic enlargement and inflammation of the anal sacs. Occasionally, it is due to impaction with foreign bodies, especially hair or fine bones in the colon or rectum, or due to stenosis caused by tumors or strictures. It may also complicate trauma to the pelvic area, and paralyzing lesions of the spinal cord; it may occur in Manx cats due to sacral spinal cord anomalies. Megacolon may ensue, if the obstruction persists. In small animals, megacolon is frequently idiopathic. Examination of the syndrome in cats reveals no histologic abnormalities and it is suggested that the underlying problem is disturbance in the activation of smooth-muscle myofilaments. Impaction of the cecum or colon in horses may be precipitated by water deprivation, a change of diet from something soft and lush to hay or chaff, or poor dentition. In animals with dental problems, impaction of the cecum may be recurrent, and cecal smooth muscle may become hypertrophic.Abnormal motility due to altered colonic or cecal pacemaker activity may explain impaction in the absence of other predisposing causes. Deficiency of neurons in the myenteric plexus at the base of the cecum may cause chronic uncoordinated hypercontractility and result in hypertrophy of the circular muscle layer of the cecum. In the colon, fibrous digesta usually impacts at the pelvic flexure, transverse or small colon. Ingestion of indigestible synthetic fibers has been associated with colonic impaction. Sand may sediment in the colon of horses that have grazed on poorly covered sandy soils. Sand may cause chronic colitis with diarrhea and weight loss, or it may accumulate at any level of the large or small colon, causing one or more points of impaction obstruction, often associated with concurrent displacement or torsion. Ingestion of large numbers of acorns and leaves may also cause impaction of the intestinal tract in ruminants. Rupture of the viscus may occur if impactions are not treated, and the bowel wall becomes ischemic and devitalized.",

Keadily fermentable carbohydrate, following a sudden change in feed, results in an increase in volatile fatty acid production, which exceeds the buffering and absorptive capacity of the organ. As the pH drops, and fermentation shifts to production of the less well-absorbed butyric and lactic acids, water is drawn into the lumen by the osmotic effect.The large bowel dilates with fluid digesta and gas, and motility is reduced by the effects of the volatile fatty acids. Severe abdominal distension, compression of intra-abdominal organs, reduced cardiac return due to postcaval compression, and reduced respiratory capacity due to compression of the diaphragm may follow, with attendant severe pain. Death due to hypovolemia and acidosis may occur before the large bowel ruptures. In recovered horses, laminitis may occur, due to absorption of endotoxin through the cecal mucosa, which becomes eroded and permeable as a result of local acidosis.",

Loss of mucosal integrity results in cessation of electrolyte and water absorption, and ultimately in effusion of tissue fluid and blood into the lumen. Proliferation of anaerobes occurs in the lumen of the stagnant ischemic area, with accumulation of gas, and extreme distension of the closed loop in strangulation obstruction. Toxin production by anaerobes, particularly clostridia, plays a large part in gangrene and ultimate rupture of ischemic gut, as well as having systemic effects.Absorption of endotoxin from the lumen may occur through devitalized mucosa via the portal flow, lymphatic return, or peritoneum. Toxins have a severe detrimental effect on cardiovascular function, contributing to circulatory failure.

The pathogenesis of the lesion is related to reflex vasoconstriction in the mucosa and submucosa, shunting of blood away from the mucosa, dilation of mucosal capillaries, and reduction in rate of flow of blood through the villus. Countercurrent transfer of oxygen from the afferent to efferent vessels in the villus aggravates hypoxemia in the villus by increased shunting of oxygen to the efferent venule. Splanchnic pooling of blood, systemic arterial hypotension, and intestinal vasoconstriction occur in endotoxic shock in dogs, causing similar mucosal lesions. Microthrombosis associated with sluggish flow, DIC, and endotoxemia may contribute to mucosal ischemia by obstructing capillaries in the villi, and mucosal and submucosal venules. Microthrombi in these vessels in association with hemorrhagic mucosal necrosis suggest the possibility of ischemia due to \"slow flow.\" Transient or incomplete reduction in perfusion due to obstruction of the arterial blood supply has a similar effect on the mucosa. The obstruction may be due to arteriospasm, perhaps induced by vasoactive mediators such as thromboxane. Mucosa devitalized by hypoxia will become hemorrhagic with continued blood flow. Since the primary problem may not involve a systemic state as complicated as severe shock, the animal may survive long enough to develop an effusive ulcerated or pseudomembranous mucosa, with some prospect of stabilization or repair, if the lesion is not widespread. \"Slow flow\" due to reduced arterial perfusion with inadequate collateral flow may be expected to affect the \"watershed\" of a circulatory field preferentially. In the horse this may be the explanation for mucosal lesions at the pelvic flexure and apex of the cecum in which thromboembolism cannot be implicated, but in which mural thrombi in the cranial mesenteric root could have caused significantly reduced perfusion or flushed vasoconstrictive thromboxane into circulation. Transient or noninfarctive \"slow flow\" has been proposed as a cause of intermittent colic due to verminous arteritis.

In both dogs and cats, idiopathic mucosal colitis and gastritis may be present as components of chronic inflammatory bowel disease, perhaps with predominant signs reflecting gastric or colonic dysfunction; both are considered here. In contrast to the mucosal pattern of inflammation evident in these entities, inflammatory lesions of the large and small intestine of any species that include a significant population of macrophages usually adopt a transmural pattern, and may be associated with a specific etiology (e.g., Mycobacterium, Histoplasma) or represent a distinct syndrome (histiocytic ulcerative colitis of Boxers). They are described below with transmural granulomatous enteritis and with typhlocolitis. Inflammatory bowel disease is a clinical syndrome for which it is difficult to develop a valid, objective histologic counterpart, and it should be a diagnosis of last resort made by the clinician after alternatives such as food intolerance, motility disorders, and infectious disease have been ruled out. However, the thoroughness of the clinical and laboratory investigation prior to the use of endoscopic biopsy is influenced by the amount of time and money available to evaluate what are often elusive functional entities. Endoscopic biopsies are often done early, after symptomatic medical therapy has failed to control clinical signs. It is probably not appropriate for a pathologist to issue a diagnosis of \"inflammatory bowel disease;\" it is more appropriate simply to list the histologic findings and to indicate that the changes could be \"compatible with\" a clinical diagnosis of that syndrome.",

Generally, milder lesions of superficial epithelium are associated with mild or moderate mucosal inflammation, which may be acute or chronic. In many cases of mild chronic mucosal colitis, the glands do not appear particularly hyperplastic. However, defective repair in the face of severe or ongoing injury may result in crypts that are tortuous or even nearly horizontal, and papillary hyperplasia of the epithelial surface. Severe erosion and ulceration are usually related to a more intense or heavy chronic inflammatory process, which may be limited to the mucosa, but which can extend into the submucosa. Truly granulomatous colitis is rare; when fully developed, perhaps as a component of regional enteritis involving the ileocecocolic area, or in histiocytic colitis of Boxer dogs, considered later, it is ulcerative and transmural. Occasionally, a granulomatous response to barium, or to other foreign material breaching the epithelium, may be observed in the mucosa and submucosa.

It is rare to encounter erosion or ulceration as part of gastritis, and acute ulceration associated with chemical or mechanical injury to the stomach has little mucosal cellular infiltrate. It is therefore prudent to distinguish gastric ulceration from gastritis. Lesions compatible with a diagnosis of gastritis include leukocytic infiltrates in the superficial third of the mucosa, mucous metaplasia and hyperplasia in fundic glands, extensive lymphoplasmacytic and/or eosinophilic infiltrates deep in the mucosa, interstitial fibrosis, and associated atrophy of glands. The diagnosis of gastric mucosal atrophy must be made with great care because there is substantial difference in mucosal thickness between various portions of the stomach, and even within the same anatomic region. Most discussions of inflammatory bowel disease assume that the change in mucosal cellularity is primary and that characterization of that cellularity should provide the greatest insight into pathogenesis and therapy. However, assessment of mucosal cellularity is almost entirely subjective and has exceedingly poor interobserver agreement. There are no useful objective reference intervals for small intestinal mucosal cellularity because the range is so broad, and accurate identification of the different cell types is problematic. Characterization of the immunophenotype of lymphocytes in the small intestine has produced variable results that have yet to be usefully associated with the presence or absence of clinical signs.",

In comparison with small intestine, the normal range in leukocyte numbers is narrower and the overall population much smaller in both colon and stomach. This is particularly true of the granulocytes. The presence of neutrophils within the lamina propria of any part of the intestine is probably abnormal, and is probably a reliable marker for recent epithelial damage or permeability.

However, they are relatively prevalent among surgical biopsy submissions from dogs and cats, in sharp contrast to their rarity in horses and food-producing animals. Malignant neoplasms are more common than benign tumors, and, excepting lymphosarcoma, most are carcinomas. Polyps are generally hyperplastic rather than neoplastic. The exceptions are rectal polyps in dogs, which are adenomas or carcinomas. Highly malignant scirrhous adenocarcinomas of the stomach and intestine occur in all species. Lymphosarcoma is the most common malignant tumor of mesenchymal origin in most species. It may arise in the gut, although involvement of this area is often part of multicentric disease (see Vol. 3, Hematopoietic system). The third major category of gastrointestinal tumors is stromal, mainly phenotypically smooth muscle or undifferentiated. Elaborate classification schemes have been proposed based on histologic or immunophenotypic characterization with, in many cases, little evidence that they are relevant to the biological behavior of the tumor or its response to therapy. Furthermore, there is often so much variation within these lesions that it is difficult to make them conform to arbitrary categories.

These cells infiltrate the lamina propria, and then invade sequentially through the submucosa and tunica muscularis, infiltrating into lymphatics, and sometimes veins. They penetrate the serosa and exfoliate into the peritoneal cavity to establish neoplastic implants on omentum and mesentery. The tumor also spreads early via lymphatic and venous routes, so that even surgical excision on discovery is rarely curative, because it is too late to prevent metastasis. The microscopic appearance of the invading tumor can be quite variable, and usually more than one histologic subtype occurs within the same neoplasm. There is no proven prognostic or therapeutic significance to the different histologic patterns. Most are scirrhous, mucus-producing carcinomas that can create mucus-filled epithelial lakes throughout the intestinal wall, accompanied by what is often a great deal of fibrous stromal proliferation.The degree of cytologic maturation may be high, yet the diagnosis of carcinoma is obvious, given the transmural invasive behavior. Less commonly, the tumor cells invade in a tubular or acinar pattern, which tends to be less scirrhous, or as scattered individual anaplastic epithelial cells, accompanied by a great deal of desmoplastic fibrous tissue, so that recognizing carcinoma (in contrast to stromal malignancy or postinflammatory reactive fibrosis) may be challenging.

In well-oriented specimens, the tubular pattern is characterized by branching crypts that are lined by generally well-differentiated columnar-to-cuboidal pseudostratified epithelial cells. The papillary type consists of villus-like projections of proprial connective tissue that are covered by a layer of pseudostratifled columnar epithelial cells. There may be cytoplasmic basophilia, loss of nuclear polarity, and prominent nucleoli in epithelium in both types of polyps.The number of mitotic figures varies, often within the same polyp. These tumors often appear to originate in the superficial portion of the crypts, deeper portions of which may remain normal, with tubules or slender papillae of hyperchromatic tumor cells above them.The stalk of the tumor is highly vascular and is continuous with the lamina propria or submucosa of the rectum.The tumors are generally well demarcated from the adjacent normal mucosa.The amount of mucin in the epithelium varies considerably, and it is often absent, especially in more dysplastic cells. Some polyps have a malignant appearance histologically. These are characterized by the presence of anaplastic epithelial cells in situ in the mucosa, and, in some cases, invading the propria and adjacent submucosa (Fig. 1.80) . There is limited information on the biological behavior of these tumors. In dogs, adequate surgical removal usually results in complete recovery. Some are interpreted at presentation as carcinoma in situ, based on cytologic characteristics, and deep biopsies and/or complete excision of these polyps are essential to rule out local invasion or infiltration of lymphatics, which should be sought in specimens with epithelial morphology suggesting malignancy. Polyps that are more than 1 cm in diameter tend to have cells with a more anaplastic appearance, and recurrence is most probable in cases interpreted as carcinoma in situ, those with multiple masses, or those with more diffuse colonic involvement.",

The appearance of the tumor on serosal surfaces resembles mesothelioma, with smooth creamy plaques or nodules up to 2-4 cm in diameter. The origin of these lesions is usually a fungating cauliflower-like mass 10-40 cm in diameter, with superficial fissures, projecting above the surface of the pars esophagea ( Fig. 1.81 ). Sometimes these lesions are superficially more ulcerative than proliferative. Necrosis and hemorrhage are evident in the tumor mass, which is usually well demarcated from adjacent normal squamous mucosa. Occasionally the tumor extends into the distal esophagus, and may obstruct it.

Strategically placed pyloric tumor may cause obstruction. Diffuse lesions, thickening the gastric wall, frequently ulcerate, and hemorrhage from such ulcers, as melena, is a common sign. The lymphoid infiltrates are recognizable as firm gray-white tissue in the submucosa and mucosa. Involvement of abomasal lymph nodes is disproportionately slight.",

Some tumors are populated by fairly mature mast cells with abundant cytoplasmic granularity easily demonstrated with toluidine blue. Others are populated by anaplastic and pleomorphic round cells or spindle-shaped cells, sometimes with giant nuclei or forming syncytia, in which cytoplasmic granules with metachromatic staining, while present, may be difficult to observe. Those with abundant metachromatic granules must be differentiated from connective tissue mast cell tumors metastatic to the gastrointestinal tract, in which case lesions should be sought in skin and elsewhere.

In the next section, etiologic entities associated with various syndromes in the domestic species are briefly summarized. The salient diagnostic features of some conditions, or the steps required at necropsy to confirm a diagnosis, are mentioned. The diseases causing gastritis, and those causing typhlocolitis in all species, have been discussed in previous sections. They are only briefly reiterated here in a general context. Further information on the pathogenesis and diagnosis of most infectious and parasitic conditions is found in the next section.",
