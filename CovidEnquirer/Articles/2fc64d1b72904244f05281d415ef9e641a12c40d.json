It was surprising that the ETEC serotype used in these experiments, although possessing K99, failed to adhere to the mucosal lining of the small intestine of newborn calves. This observation was confirmed by IF studies and examination of histological sections of the bowel and is in contrast to other reports of field and experimental colibacillosis in calves (Pearson et al., 1978 (Pearson et al., , 1979 Bellamy and Acres, 1979; Moon et al., 1978) . The ETEC serotype used in these experiments did, however, induce diarrhoea in newborn calves, probably by proliferating in the lumen of the intestine. It indicates that colonization of the brush borders of enterocytes, although an important virulence attribute (Orscov et al., 1975) , was not a prerequisite for induction of diarrhoea in newborn calves.",

(1979) in the colon of calves with naturally occurring diarrhoea. In our experiment the ETEC induced neither mucosal damage nor influenced the level of lactase activity. The effect of ETEC on mucosal integrity has been described as variable (Barnum et al., 1967; Moon, 1974) . Much more severe clinical illness and mucosal changes were reported for 0101 (Pearson et al., 1979) and 09 (Bellamy and Acres, 1979) serotypes. These differences may be due to either the low dose used in our experiments or directly related to the failure of 020 to colonize the mucosa. Smith and Huggins (1978) have shown that in vivo the K antigen in a strain with a 99 plasmid and, to a lesser extent, the 0 antigen, were important in determining whether or not a strain would colonize the small intestine. The expression of K99 in vitro has been reported to depend on the 0 antigen (De Graaf et al., 1980) . They showed that 020 produced less K99 than did, for instance, 0101. It is feasible then that in calves, different serotypes may induce colibacillosis of varying severity depending on the K and/or 0 antigens. Differences in clinical response between serological 0 types have been observed in piglets, where 064 induced a more severe disease than did 020, although both types possessed the K88 antigen and produced stable toxin demonstrable by the infant mouse test (Tzipori et al., 1982) .",

Mucosal changes were also more marked in animals infected with both agents than those infected with rotavirus alone. We consider that the damage in the mucosa of these calves resulted from infection with rotavirus and was exacerbated by the presence of ETEC. Villous atrophy and destruction of mature enterocytes, resulting in maldigestion and malabsorption have been suggested as the mechanism of action of rotavirus, while hypersecretion is said to result from the action of enterotoxin liberated by ETEC (Moon, 1978) . Therefore, simultaneous infection of the gut with these two agents would suggest an additive effect. However, because ETEC failed to adhere to the mucosa it was difficult to assess their role in terms of the degree of colonization in the dually infected calves. Presence of undigested lactose in the lumen of the small and large bowel may have provided a more favourable environment for selective bacterial proliferation in the lumen.",
