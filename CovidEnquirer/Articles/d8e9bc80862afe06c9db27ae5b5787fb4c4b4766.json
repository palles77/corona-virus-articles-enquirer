Lipid-containing, or enveloped, viruses include: Baculo-, Bunya-, Corona-, Filo-, Herpes-, Lenti-, Orthomyxo-, Paramyxo-, Pox-, Retro-, Rhabdo-, and Togaviridae. Despite the great diversity of these viruses in regard to structure, replicative strategy, host range and pathogenicity, the function of the lipids in each case is the same -to form a membrane surrounding the encapsidated viral RNA or DNA genome. The lipids of the viral envelope form a continuous bilayer that functions as a permeability barrier protecting the viral nucleocapsid from the external milieu. Embedded in this bilayer are numerous copies of a limited number of virally encoded transmembrane proteins (often just one or two) that are required for virus entry into a potential host cell. These proteins mediate two essential functions: attachment of the virion to the cell surface; and fusion of the viral envelope with a cell membrane, resulting in accession of the viral nucleocapsid containing the genome to the cellular cytoplasm.",

Many viruses bud through the plasma membrane, but bunyaviruses bud through the Golgi apparatus, coronaviruses chiefly through the endoplasmic reticulum, and herpesviruses through the nuclear membrane.

Rafts are regions of the plasma membrane characterized by high concentrations of sphingolipids (sphingomyelin and sphingoglycolipids) and cholesterol. These components participate in the formation of separate, partially miscible phases, distinguishable from the more fluid phase(s) which are relatively enriched in unsaturated phospholipids. Raft and non-raft phases co-exist as contiguous bilayers, but diffusion is relatively restricted within raft phases, and exchange of molecules between phases occurs more slowly than diffusion within a single phase. Although the existence of local heterogeneity in lipid and protein structure has been demonstrated in cell membranes using a variety of physical and detergent extraction techniques, a precise definition of rafts has not been achieved. There is little agreement regarding their size, or whether they are nucleated by lipids or by proteins. Despite these uncertainties, certain membrane constituents are clearly concentrated in specialized regions rich in sphingolipids and cholesterol, and these have been identified as the sites of important cellular signaling and transport functions, and of assembly and budding for many enveloped viruses. Detailed lipid analyses of purified budded virions have confirmed their origin in rafts, and have in turn helped to define the lipid composition of virus-associated rafts.",

Further activation of the virus' fusion protein gp40 occurs by interaction with a coreceptor, either the chemokine receptor CCR5 or CXCR4. In contrast, orthomyxo-and many paramyxoviruses have much broader specificity. Their recognition proteins (HA or HN, respectively) bind to sialic acid residues attached to various cell surface proteins or lipids. Different strains show preference for sialic acid in different covalent linkages. Rhabdoviruses such as vesicular stomatitis or rabies virus are still less specific, binding indiscriminately to negative charge clusters, whether created by lipids, proteins, oligosaccharides, or surface-bound polyanions.

The two closely apposed bilayers (Figure 1(a) ) dimple towards each other to form the 'stalk' (Figure 1(b) ). This thins to form a 'hemifusion diaphragm' (Figure 1(c) ), which now separates the two aqueous compartments by a single membrane bilayer in place of the two that separated them in the pre-fusion state. The hemifusion bilayer consists of the inner leaflets of the two original bilayers, the outer leaflets having already fused with consequent mixing of their lipid components.

Several properties of viral fusion proteins are known to be essential for activity, however. All viral and cellular fusion proteins are oligomeric, usually trimeric for virus fusion proteins. In most cases, several (probably 5-7) trimers must act cooperatively in order to complete the fusion reaction. One attractive idea is that the several fusion protein trimers encircle a limited area of bilayer, into which the fusion proteins can then transfer the energy released by their ensuing conformational transitions ( Figure 2 ) in order to effect the lipid rearrangements required for fusion. Viral fusion proteins might potentiate any or all of the fusion steps: initial stalk formation, hemifusion diaphragm formation from the stalk, fusion pore formation from the hemifusion diaphragm, expansion of the initial fusion pore to complete fusion. Within these general principles two distinct classes of viral fusion proteins have been recognized, possessing radically different architecture. Type I viruses include orthomyxo-, paramyxo-, retro-, and coronaviruses. Type II viruses include toga-and flaviviruses.

Exposure of the fusion peptide, enabling it to penetrate the target cell membrane, is an essential aspect of fusion protein activation, and requires a conformational change from a precursor form (Figure 2(b) ). In type I proteins, this results from proteolytic activation; the influenza fusion peptides, for example, comprise the newly created N termini. Type II fusion peptides are located in a protruding loop of the protein structure, which is exposed by a poorly understood interaction with lipids, notably cholesterol. As with the transmembrane domain, a certain amount of conformational flexibility is required in the fusion peptide.",

This consists of a helical coiled-coil in type I proteins (Figure 2(b) ), and an arrangement of b-sheet domains in type II proteins. Once the fusion peptide has inserted into the target membrane, fusion is completed by the rearrangement of this metastable structure to its lowest free energy form (Figures 2(d)-2(e) ). In order to assume this form, the rigid oligomer folds back upon itself, forming a 'hairpin' (Figures 2(d) -2(e)), thus dragging the cell membrane, tethered by the fusion peptide, toward the viral membrane, tethered by the transmembrane domain. The free energy released by this rearrangement is transferred to the lipid bilayers, providing the energy necessary to complete the fusion reaction. In the final fused product, the fusion peptide and the transmembrane domain are adjacent to each other in the same membrane, held in proximity by the fully stable, rigid hairpin (Figure 2(f ) ).",

Hence, viral membrane protein synthesis is carried out on host cell membrane-bound ribosomes, which inserts them into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane in the correct orientation ( Figure 3 ). There they are glycosylated by the host cell machinery and assembled into appropriate oligomers, as directed by their own primary amino acid sequence. Most viral glycoproteins are then passed on to the Golgi by cellular mechanisms, where they are further glycosylated by host cell enzymes. For this reason, the envelope proteins of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), influenza, and a few other enveloped viruses have provided valuable tools to study the glycosylation and transport of membrane proteins through the cellular endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi-plasma membrane system. Because host cell protein synthesis is often inhibited by infection with these viruses (by a variety of cytopathic mechanisms), large amounts of a single viral membrane protein are produced and correctly processed in infected cells, without competition by cellular proteins.",

For example, the single VSV glycoprotein, named G, is glycosylated in the endoplasmic reticulum, the oligosaccharide is modified in the Golgi, and the mature protein is targeted to the basolateral plasma membrane of polarized cells after entry into the late Golgi. The influenza HA protein, on the other hand, is glycosylated and delivered to the apical plasma membrane of the same polarized cells after passage through the intracellular membrane system. The retention of coronavirus glycoproteins by the endoplasmic reticulum, and of bunyavirus glycoproteins by the Golgi, reflects the operation of the same cellular mechanisms that retain resident cellular proteins in these organelles. The localization of viral membrane proteins in turn, determines the location of viral assembly and budding.",

            "text": "The budding process consists of the wrapping of a viral glycoprotein-enriched piece of membrane around the previously assembled nucleocapsid, which contains the viral genome ( Figure 4) . Remarkably, the completed viral envelope contains viral proteins and host cell lipids, with host cell membrane proteins being almost completely excluded. There is much less discrimination, however, between different viral proteins than between viral and cellular proteins, since viral envelope proteins of one kind can assemble with nucleocapsids of another, resulting in the formation of pseudotype virions. Pseudotypes have proven useful in redirecting specific viral genomes to alternate host cells since membrane attachment proteins are major determinants of host cell specificity (see above). It has been suggested that the discrimination between viral and cellular membrane proteins may arise from the exclusion of cellular proteins from virus-associated raft-like lipid phases. Different viruses have been described, that bud at every stage in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi-plasma membrane pathway (Figure 3) . While paramyxo-, orthomyxo-, rhabdo-, and togaviruses (and many others) generally bud from the plasma membrane, they have also been shown to bud intracellularly under certain conditions. Some retroviruses assemble at the plasma membrane, while others do not; this has provided a classical basis for distinguishing between different types of retroviruses. Other viruses normally bud intracellularly, from the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus, for example, coronaviruses and bunyaviruses respectively, but these have also been observed to bud further down the pathway. In these cases, the nucleocapsid assembles on the cytoplasmic face of the membrane, and then buds into the intracellular organelle. The newly formed virion may then be secreted out of the cell through the normal secretory pathway, although this does not always occur efficiently. In all enveloped viruses except togaviruses, budding is mediated by a peripheral membrane protein, usually called M or MA, which links the glycoprotein-containing patch of lipids with the viral nucleocapsid, containing the viral genome. The M proteins interact specifically with nucleocapsids of their own viral species, but they do not always interact specifically with the corresponding viral glycoproteins. Instead, they may concentrate on the cytoplasmic side of the raft-like lipid phases that accumulate various viral glycoproteins. This could provide the structural basis for the formation of pseudotype virions, and might explain why many viruses contain widely varying ratios of glycoproteins to M or nucleocapsid proteins.",

The cytoplasm is indicated by blue dots. The viral membrane is colorless. (b) The stalk structure. In this state, continuity is established between the outer leaflets of the two membrane bilayers, allowing lipid mixing. (c) The fusion diaphragm constitutes a single bilayer separating the two aqueous compartments, comprising the inner leaflets of the cellular and viral membrane bilayers. The outer leaflets have already fused, and their lipids have mixed. (d) The fusion pore arises from rearrangement of the limited-area fusion diaphragm, perhaps facilitated by fusion proteins. Expansion of the fusion pore allows complete mixing of aqueous compartments and completes fusion. Fusion can occur even between protein-free lipid bilayers under certain conditions, but fusion proteins increase efficiency, probably by acting at each step in this pathway.

(a) The influenza virus has been internalized into the host cell endosome by receptor-mediated endocytosis (not shown). (b) Acidification of the endosome causes a conformational change in HA, which causes the fusion peptide (red) to become exposed; it subsequently inserts into the endosomal membrane. (c) Further refolding and clustering of HA trimers leads to bending of the two membranes toward each other. The resulting stalk (d) rearranges into the hemifusion diaphragm (e), where the virus interior is separated from the cytoplasm by a single bilayer, composed of the internal leaflets of the original membranes. This eventually rearranges, resulting in the formation of the fusion pore (f), which initially flickers and then dilates to complete the fusion reaction (not shown).

Viral glycoproteins, inserted into the cellular membrane at the endoplasmic reticulum and processed through the Golgi to the plasma membrane (seeFigure 3), associate with the assembled viral nucleocapsid. The direct association pictured here is characteristic of togaviruses. For other viruses, possessing helical nucleocapsids, the association is mediated by a peripheral membrane protein. Cellular membrane proteins are excluded from the envelope of the mature virion. This may occur during assembly, as pictures, or by prior formation of a viral membrane patch (or raft), before the nucleocapsid arrives at the membrane. The endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi-plasma membrane system of a cell. All viral and cellular integral membrane proteins are synthesized by ribosomes bound to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Proteins destined for the plasma membrane are transported first to the proximal region of the Golgi (the cis face), then sequentially through the Golgi cisternae, to the trans face and out to the plasma membrane. In polarized cells, targeting to the apical or basolateral surface of the cell occurs from the trans face of the Golgi. Assembly and budding of different enveloped viruses occurs at characteristic points within this membrane system.",
