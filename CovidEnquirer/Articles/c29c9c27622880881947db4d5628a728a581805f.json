            "text": "Cysteine has been considered as a ''hydrophilic'' amino acid because of its pK a and its ability to form (weak) hydrogen bonds. However, cysteines are found mostly in hydrophobic environments, either in S-S (disulphide) form or in free cysteine form. When free cysteines are found on the surface of proteins, they are often involved in catalytic residues, as in cysteine proteases, P-loop phosphatases, etc. Additionally, a unique property of cysteines is that their side-chain volume is different from all other amino acids. This study is focused on the discrimination between structural versus active free cysteines based on a local environment analysis which does not appear to have been attempted previously. We have demonstrated the corresponding structural positions associated with free cysteines in their three-dimensional localization environment. We examined protein samples including nine, sequenced, coronavirus proteases and cysteine-rich non-membrane proteins. Our present study shows that the sequential environments of free cysteines of coronavirus proteases are rather hydrophobic and that the free cysteines of non-membrane proteases have a higher amount of contacts to hydrophobic residues and lower amount of contacts to polar or charged residues.",

The identification of the free cysteines, combined with classification based on functional features and spatial schematics, provides a basis for experimental validation and association of new molecules involved in cysteine activities. Since neighboring residues share physical characteristics (Zvelebil et al., 1987) , we have undertaken a more detailed study of the surroundings of cysteine residues in protein structures. The patterns discerned in the distribution of various residues and their constituent around cysteine should be useful in improving our understanding of protein stability, molecular recognition and binding.",

All of the selected proteins employed in this study were characterized by X-ray crystallography with 3.5 \u00c5 or better resolution. Membrane proteins are known to be complicated targets for structure determination and were excluded. Therefore, according to their environmental differences, a total of 21 cysteine-rich proteins were randomly collected. This further resulted in a sample of 15 distinct types of non-membrane proteins. The PDB codes and the corresponding protein names for each are listed in Table 1 . Moreover, based on the literature data available for each, the 15 non-membrane proteins were classified according to common functions into nine different categories. These included cysteine proteases, phosphatases, metabolic enzymes, kinases, interleukins, transcription factors, motility, virus capsid proteins, and ribosomes.",

Table 1 shows a total of 87 cysteine residues collected from the nonmembrane protein data sets, and those were further divided into two forms: 2 disulfide-bonding cysteines (Cys_SS), and 85 free cysteines (Cys_SH). Our data show that free cysteines of non-membrane proteins prefer a b strand environment. For non-membrane proteins: the hydrophobic residues such as leucine, valine, isoleucine and alanine were more frequently seen in the spatial neighborhood around free cysteines; the same was observed for the aromatic phenylalanine residue. Thus, the sequential differences in the positions between Cys_SH and its local neighborhood among the non-membrane protein data sets suggest that the surrounding residues are mostly hydrophobic (Table 1) .

Thus, we applied a structure-base sequence alignment of these nine coronavirus main proteinases to identify any spatial correspondences involving cysteine among them. Residues comprising the nine coronavirus main proteases are illustrated in Fig. 1 . It can be observed that this multiple sequences alignment figure shows a strong conservation of hydrophobic residues (valine, leucine, isoleucine, alanine phenylalanine and proline) and small residues (serine and glycine) in proximity to cysteine residues. The presences of 28 cysteine residues (around 9%) in well-conserved positions were also noticed. This indicates that these homologous proteins had a higher proportion of cysteine residues than others. Moreover, our findings show that the environment of free cysteines is rather hydrophobic and are in fair agreement with the results reported by 229E, gij30024078; TGEV, gij30146762; OC43, gij50844478; BCoV, gij26008084; MHV, gij25121563; PEDV, gij30138155; IBV, gij25121547; FIPV, gij37999875).

Thus, our data show that, based on the 3D spatial orientation, the aromatic rings of a selected residue, i.e. phenylalanine are most likely to be in contact with the sulfur atom of cysteines. We carefully examined some other non-membrane proteins. Approximately 62% and 60% of the aromatic ring faces of phenylalanine and tyrosine, respectively were clustered contiguously to the sulfur atom of cysteins, contrary to the way tryptophan (W) behaved. See Fig. 6 . This might be because tryptophan not only has the largest nonpolar accessible surface area, but also observed less frequently in our Fig. 5 . Plots of occurrences of residues. (a) 28 cysteines conserved locations were observed of the sequence alignment of 9 coronaviruses (3CLpro) main proteinases.

Conserved residues mapping on certain characteristics may likewise identify a key site or perhaps a sensible function. Accordingly, the approaches we have presented were based on the structures. Although spatial contacts have been studied to derive contact potentials for the different amino acid interactions (Brocchieri and Karlin, 1995; Jernigan, 1996, 1999) , the common strategy is to study the number of contacts within a given distance cut-off. To our knowledge structural bioinformatics detection of the cysteines has not been attempted previously. This study has revealed, for the first time, the discrimination of structural versus active free cysteines based on local environment analysis. The computational prediction and annotation of free cysteines in the protein environments has been described through analysis of 3D spatial correspondences.",
