By 12 August, 2003, more than 8000 individuals have been infected with SARS, of which 812 were fatal. 1, 2 It has been shown that a previously unknown coronavirus is the primary cause of SARS. 3 -6 Avascular osteonecrosis (AVN) is a well-recognized condition of unknown aetiology whereby the circulation of the blood to an area of bone is impaired. 7 Eventually the involved area of bone dies and necrosis develops. It may be idiopathic or associated with a number of diseases, such as trauma, use of steroids, sickle cell disease, and vasculitis. Risk factors include the use of steroids and alcohol abuse. Intravascular fat embolism or thrombosis, coagulopathy, venous congestion and development of intra-osseous hypertension have been postulated as aetiological factors. 8, 9 The early diagnosis of AVN is important as surgical core decompression may arrest the progress of the condition and prevent subsequent femoral head collapse. 10 About 23 -32% of SARS patients become critically ill, 11 so corticosteroids are frequently prescribed. Corticosteroids have long been regarded as a predisposing factor for the development of AVN. AVN has not been previously reported in patients with SARS so the present study was undertaken to investigate the incidence of AVN in SARS patients.",

Coronavirus was found to be the primary cause of SARS. 3 -6 AVN represents compromised circulation of the blood to an area of bone. 7 As a result haematopoietic cells, which are sensitive to anoxia, usually die within 6 -12 h after reduction or removal of the blood supply, bone cells usually die within 12 -48 h, and marrow fat cells usually die within 5 days. 13 Many mechanisms have been postulated as causes of AVN, including the following: trauma; idiopathic causes, such as Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes disease; renal transplantation; increase in endogenous steroid levels; use of immunosuppressants and other drugs, such as exogenous steroids; collagen vascular disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus; haemoglobinopathies, such as sickle cell disease, haemophilia; alcohol use; and others. Existing hypotheses for its pathogenesis include vascular thrombosis, fat embolism, or vasculitis. 14 Early diagnosis of AVN is important, as suitable treatment may prevent its progress and subsequent bone collapse. However, the early diagnosis of AVN is difficult using plain radiographs, as radiographs usually appear normal at stage 1, but radiography can identify the latter stages of AVN. Bone scintigraphy and MRI improve the diagnostic accuracy. 15 MRI is the most sensitive diagnostic technique for the diagnosis of AVN at any stage, 7,16 -18 particular in the early stage, with a sensitivity of 93 -100%. 15, 19 It aids staging, estimating prognosis and surgical planning. 20, 21 In our study, no abnormalities were seen on the plain radiographs or computed tomography (CT), but AVN was diagnosed using MRI, so MRI is the imaging technique of choice for the early diagnosis of AVN.",

In our study, all the SARS patients received steroids. Some studies show that there is no relation between AVN and the cumulative dosages of therapeutic doses, 24, 25 but other studies show a strong correlation between the mean daily total steroid dose and AVN. 26, 27 A study by Rademaker et al. 28 shows that 700 mg prednisolone is the threshold for developing AVN.

As MRI is more sensitive than plain radiography, this could be one reason to explain the anomalies in the present study; but as we know little about this new coronavirus, whether the virus itself or in combination with steroid use could lead to these phenomenon, still needs to be studied. Further study is needed to follow up those SARS patients without joint pain to investigate whether they develop AVN in the future.",
