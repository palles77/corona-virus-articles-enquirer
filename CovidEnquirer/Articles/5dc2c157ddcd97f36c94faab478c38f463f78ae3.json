The viral cDNA was used as input for multiple overlapping PCR reactions (~2.5kb each) spanning the viral genome using Platinum SuperFi master mix (primers provided in Supplementary Table S1 ). Amplicons were pooled equally, purified and quantified. Nextera XT libraries were prepared and sequencing was performed with multiplexing on an Illumina iSeq (300 cycle flow cell).

Previously, disease investigations often relied on the targeted sequencing of a small locus to identify genotypes and infer patterns of spread along with epidemiological data.

This advance improves our understanding of pathogen origins and spread that ultimately lead to stronger and more timely intervention and control measures [17] . Following the first release of the SARS-CoV-2 genome [18] , public health and research laboratories worldwide have rapidly shared sequences on public data repositories such as GISAID [19] (n = 236 genomes as of 9 March 2020) that have been used to provide near real-time snapshots of global diversity through public analytic and visualization tools [20] .",

It is expected that further Chinese strains would be identified within this clade, and across the entire diversity of SARS-CoV-2 as this is where the outbreak started, including for the outbreak in Iran itself. However, while we cannot completely discount that the cases in Australia and New Zealand came from other sources including China, our phylogenetic analyses, as well as epidemiological (recent travel to Iran) and clinical data (date of symptom onset), provide evidence that this clade of SARS-CoV-2 is linked to the Iranian epidemic, from where genomic data is currently lacking. Importantly, the seemingly multiple importations of very closely related viruses from Iran into Australia suggests that this diversity reflects the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 transmission within Iran.

            "text": "circulating in Wuhan. As the four patients identified in this period had recently returned from China, this region was the likely source of infection. From 1 February 2020, travel to Australia from mainland China was restricted to returning Australian residents and their children, who were placed in home quarantine for 14 days. Despite the intensive testing of such returning travellers, no further cases of COVID-19 were detected in NSW until 28 February 2020, when SARS-COV-2 was detected in an individual returning from Iran (NSW05). A close contact of this individual also tested positive (NSW14) providing the first evidence of local transmission within NSW. This was followed by further Iran travel-linked cases in NSW (NSW06, NSW11, NSW12, NSW13) and New Zealand (NZ01). Of note, the genomes of all patients with a history of travel to Iran were part of a monophyletic group defined by three nucleotide substitutions (G1397A, T28688C & G29742T) in the SARS-CoV-2 genome relative to the Wuhan prototype strain (Figure 1B). G1397A and T28688C both occur in coding regions with G1397A producing a nonsynonymous change (V378I) in the ORF1ab encoded non-structural protein 2 region. G29742T occurs in the 3' UTR. In addition to the Australian and New Zealand strains, this clade also included a traveller who had returned to Canada from Iran (BC_37_0-2), providing further evidence of its likely link to the Iranian epidemic. Indeed, a search of all currently available GISAID sequences and metadata revealed no other complete genome sequences from patients with documented history of travel to or residence in Iran (as of 9 March 2020).",
