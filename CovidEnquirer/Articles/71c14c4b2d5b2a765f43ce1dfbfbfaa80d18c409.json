Objective: We present some remarkable imaging findings of the first two patients identified in Italy with COVID-19 infection travelling from Wuhan, China. The follow-up with chest X-Rays and CT scans was also included, showing a progressive adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Results: Moderate to severe progression of the lung infiltrates, with increasing percentage of high-density infiltrates sustained by a bilateral and multi-segmental extension of lung opacities, were seen. During the follow-up, apart from pleural effusions, a tubular and enlarged appearance of pulmonary vessels with a sudden caliber reduction was seen, mainly found in the dichotomic tracts, where the center of a new insurgent pulmonary lesion was seen. It could be an early alert radiological sign to predict initial lung deterioration. Another uncommon element was the presence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy with short-axis oval nodes. Conclusions: Although only two patients have been studied, these findings are consistent with the radiological pattern described in literature. Finally, the pulmonary vessels enlargement in areas where new lung infiltrates develop in the follow-up CT scan, could describe an early predictor radiological sign of lung impairment.",

The imaging findings recently reported in patients with COVID-19 appear similar to those reported with SARS-CoV (Ooi et al., 2004; Nestor et al., 2004; Nicolaou et al., 2003) and MERS-CoV (Das et al., 2015a; Das et al., 2015b) infection. Our patients showed some new and remarkable imaging findings seen in follow-up chest X-Rays and CT scans of these 2 cases who progressed to develop adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Lung patterns in both patients were characterized by hypertrophy of the pulmonary vessels, which are increased in size, particularly in areas with more pronounced interstitial impairment. This new radiological evidence suggests a different pattern of lung involvement compared to those observed in the other known severe coronavirus infections (SARS and MERS) (Ooi et al., 2004; Nicolaou et al., 2003) where pulmonary vessel vasoconstriction was possibly related to the presence of vasoactive substance within the lesions (Wenhui Li et al., 2003) .",

During the follow-up examinations, a tubular and enlarged appearance of pulmonary vessels with a sudden caliber reduction was reported. They were mainly found in the dichotomic tracts, where the center of a new insurgent pulmonary lesion was seen (Figure 6a, b) . This sign is likely to be related to the hyperemia induced by the viral infection, and if consistent and validated by further observations, could be described as an early alert radiological sign to predict initial lung deterioration. Other findings of interest reported previously (Chung et al., 2020) were the presence in all scan examinations of mediastinal lymphadenopathy with shortaxis oval nodes up to 1 cm and the presence of pleural effusion, first as unilateral and then subsequently bilateral; as it increased with the worsening of the symptoms.",
