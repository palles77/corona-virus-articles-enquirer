Periodic measurement and monitoring of antibiotic use and comparison within the institution as well as with other organizations are important indicators. We analyzed antibiotic usage in a general hospital in Saudi Arabia. Antibiotic data were collected retrospectively for 2011 and from 2013 to 2015, and only adult patients (>15 year of age) were included in the study. Data were presented as days of therapy (DOT) and defined daily dose (DDD). DDD was adjusted per 100 bed-days and according to the case mix index (CMI). The total DDD was 37,557 in 2013, 36,550 in 2014 and 38,738 in 2015. The DDD per 100 patient-days was 90.7-94.5. There was a discordant findings of antibiotic measurements based on the DDD compared to DOT, and DDD/100 beddays compared to DOT/100 bed-days. There was a negative correlation between CMI and DDD per 100 bed days (r \u22120.696), but a positive correlation of CMI with DOT (r +0.93). Adjusted DDD/100 bed-days showed decrease in the usage of antibiotics, reflecting activities of the antibiotic stewardship program. The increase in DOT/100 bed-days may indicate the favorable utilization of combination therapy. Antibiotic usage needs to be adjusted per 100 bed-days and correlated with CMI for better reflection of optimal antibiotic utilization, activities of the antibiotic stewardship program, and to allow benchmarking.",

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), each drug has an anatomical therapeutics chemical (ATC) code and a DDD value in grams [10] . To define the exact consumption rate, it was recommended to express DDD per 100 bed-days in hospitals and DDDs per 1000 inhabitantdays for out-patients [11] [12] [13] . DOT is the number of days that a patient receives an antibiotic regardless of the dose [1] . DDD has better estimation than DOT, especially in patients receiving a combination of antibiotics or one dose only (e.g., surgical prophylaxis), and it can be calculated even in the absence of a computerized pharmacy system [1] . A better measure for comparing DDD with an external hospital, is the quantitative assessment of antibiotics use, with adjustment for severity of illness among hospitalized patients, using the case mix index (CMI) [11, 14] . There are limited studies of antibiotic utilization in Saudi Arabia [15] . In this study, we compare the DDD, DOT, DDD per 100 bed-days, and the adjusted DDD according to CMI.",

The World Health Organization 2013 Guidelines for Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical/Defined Daily Dose (ATC/DDD) were utilized for the calculation of DDD. DDD for each antibiotic was calculated separately, the total number of grams administered for each antibiotic per year was divided by the WHO DDD in grams [10] . Thus, the DDD is an estimate of the number of days of antibiotic therapy. Data of day surgery was not included in calculating the bed days. Antibiotic usage was adjusted per 100 bed-days by dividing DDD by daily occupied beds and multiplied by 100. A direct measure of the number of days of therapy (DOTs) is a common method of antibiotic usage evaluation. DOT is simply the sum of the total number of days of all used antibiotics.

Data for DDD/100 bed-days showed a slight negative correlation with an R 2 of \u22120.775 whereas there was a clear positive correlation in the case of DOT/100 bed-days with an R 2 of 0.918. Adjusted for the bed-days and the CMI, the DDD/100 beddays is shown in Fig. 2 . The correlation between DDD/100 bed-days and CMI was \u22120.696. A blot of the DDD/100 bed-days against the CMI showed that DDD/100 bed-days falls within the benchmark in relation to the CMI, based on data by Kuster et al. [17] . A total reduction in antibiotic usage after adjustment using 100 bed-days and CMI was 5.13% (from 95.6 to 90.7 between the baseline in 2011 and year 2015) (Fig. 2 ).",

Direct comparison of the quantity of antibiotic consumed between hospitals is flawed, due to multiple factors, such as severity of illness, structures, and missions [17] . We reported antibiotic consumption per 100 bed-days for inpatients, to overcome the variation in hospital size and occupancy rate. We also adjusted antibiotic usage using the case mix index (CMI), to reduce the variation of patient morbidity among hospitals. CMI is a tool for comparison and had been shown to have a moderate correlation with antibiotic use [17, 21] .",

This findings is obvious in this report where DDD increased and the DDD per 100 bed days decreased in 2015 compared to the baseline. The adjusted DDD/100 bed-days showed a decrease in the usage of antibiotics, reflecting activities of the antibiotic stewardship program. Measur-ing DDDs per 1000 patient-days and DOTs per 1000 patient-days (or 100 patient-days) may be required especially in relation to antimicrobial resistance [27] . Further adjustment of DDD/100 bed-days based on CMI in our study showed a negative correlation with increasing CMI, reflecting the efficacy of ASP activities in our institute. The reduction of 5.13% of DDD adjusted to 100 bed-days, and correlation with CMI, gave us an indicator of the ASP's success. Similarly, previous studies showed a strong correlation between CMI and antibacterial usage expressed as DDD/100 patient days [17] . However, increasing CMI may lead to increased combination therapy as shown by an increase in the DOT and DOT/100 bed-days. This increase in combination therapy could be also the target of future antimicrobial stewardship program, particularly targeting deescalation from combination therapy to monotherapy.",
