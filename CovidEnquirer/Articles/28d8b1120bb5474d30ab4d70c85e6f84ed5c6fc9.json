            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is the causative agent for a swine disease affecting the pig industry worldwide. Infection with PRRSV leads to reproductive complications, respiratory illness, and weak immunity to secondary infections. To better control PRRSV infection, novel approaches for generating control measures are critically needed. Here, in vitro Gibson assembly (GA) of viral genomic cDNA fragments was tested for its use as a quick and simple method to recover infectious PRRSV in cell culture. GA involves the activities of T5-exonuclease, Phusion polymerase, and Taq ligase to join overlapping cDNA fragments in an isothermal condition. Four overlapping cDNA fragments covering the entire PRRSV genome and one vector fragment were used to create a plasmid capable of expressing the PRRSV genome. The assembled product was used to transfect a co-culture of 293T and MARC-145 cells. Supernatants from the transfected cells were then passaged onto MARC-145 cells to rescue infectious virus particles. Verification and characterization of the recovered virus confirmed that the GA protocol generated infectious PRRSV that had similar characteristics to the parental virus. This approach was then tested for the generation of a chimeric virus. By replacing one of the four genomic fragments with that of another virus strain, a chimeric virus was successfully recovered via GA. In conclusion, this study describes for the first time the use of GA as a simple, yet powerful tool for generating infectious PRRSV needed for studying PRRSV biology and developing novel vaccines.",

PRRSV belongs to the Arteriviridae family within the Nidovirales order. Its genome is composed of a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA with an approximate size of 15 kb. Pigs infected with PRRSV display symptoms related to the reproductive and respiratory systems. Abortion and premature farrowing are often observed in infected sows, while pneumonia and increased susceptibility to secondary infections can be observed in infected pigs of all ages (Rossow, 1998) . Current strategies for controlling PRRSV outbreaks include the use of modified live-attenuated vaccines (MLVs) and inactivated vaccines (Kimman et al., 2009) . However, these immunization strategies are not fully protective against PRRSV infection. Current MLVs have been associated with numerous problems such as shedding of vaccine virus, persistent infection, incomplete protection and reversion to virulence, while the reported outcomes for inactivated vaccine use have not been promising (Huang and Meng, 2010) .",

            "text": "Understanding the molecular basis of PRRSV virulence is critical for developing better PRRSV vaccines. A reverse genetics system could provide a powerful tool for dissecting the role of viral proteins in the viral life cycle and pathogenicity. One of the most definitive ways to study the roles of specific sequences in a viral genome is to modify them and use them to generate infectious virus-that is, to 'rescue' virus with these modified sequences (Bridgen, 2012) . Various approaches have been employed to generate PRRSV infectious clone, including the use of a bacterial artificial chromosome (Wang et al., 2013) , a T7 promoter in the low copy-number plasmid pOK12 (Meulenberg et al., 1998; Nielsen et al., 2003) , a CMV promoterdriven plasmid (Lee et al., 2005) , and an RNA-launched system http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2014.09.008 0168-1702/\u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. (Fang et al., 2006) . All of these bacterial-clone approaches require substantial effort, are time consuming, and are prone to introducing undesired mutations during amplification of plasmid DNA in bacteria. One alternative approach for generating an infectious PRRSV clone is to use an in vitro assembly method, such as the Gibson assembly (GA) method, originally described by Gibson et al. in 2009 (Gibson et al., 2009 ). This method involves three kinds of enzymes: T5 exonuclease, a DNA polymerase and a DNA ligase, which act in a single-tube reaction to assemble multiple overlapping DNA molecules (Gibson et al., 2009) . The T5 exonuclease functions in the assembly process by chewing 5 ends of the overlapping DNA fragments. The digested DNA fragments can then be seamlessly joined together by the DNA polymerase, which adds the complementary nucleotides, and the DNA ligase, which fills in the gaps between the DNA fragments. In vitro DNA assembly methods, such as GA, have been used successfully to assemble a complete synthetic Mycoplasma genitalium genome (Gibson et al., 2009) , mouse mitochondrial genome (Gibson et al., 2010) , and dengue virus genome (Siridechadilok et al., 2013) . To our best knowledge, there has been no previous report on the use of GA to generate PRRSV. This study describes a protocol for generating PRRSV directly from an in vitro GA reaction. Genome sequencing analysis and characterization of the recovered virus suggest that GA could serve as an efficient platform to generate infectious PRRSV. It also shows that GA can be used as a simple tool to generate chimeric viruses. By swapping one of the genomic fragments of one virus with that of another virus, a chimeric virus was successfully generated. GA is thus a simple yet powerful tool for generating genetically modified PRRSV.",

As shown in Fig. 3B , a strong band at the expected size of 370 bp was observed, suggesting the presence of vRNA in the culture supernatant.

Out of 15,412 bases of the viral genome, nine nucleotides of the GA-derived virus were found to be different from the RespPRRSV. While the majority of these nucleotide changes were synonymous mutations, three of them were non-synonymous. A close examination of the sequence chromatograms of the original RespPRRSV virus revealed that the nucleotides leading to non-synonymous amino acid changes, including C3177T, G3435T, and G5322A, all displayed overlapping peaks, suggesting the co-existence of two nucleotide species (Fig. 4A) . Although the major peaks were considered to be canonical , or purified RespPRRSV vRNAs. Supernatants of the transfected co-cultures were used to infect MARC-145 and CPE was documented on day 3. (B) RNA was isolated from the supernatants of MARC-145 cells exposed to co-culture supernatants. Two-step RT-PCR using primers specific for PRRSV ORF7 was performed with or without reverse transcriptase (RT). Pre-made cDNA of RespPRRSV was used as a positive control for the PCR reaction. sequences, the minor peaks found in the RespPRRSV genome became the major population of the GA-derived virus, suggesting that the parental RespPRRSV stock may already contain a minor population with these three non-synonymous mutations. Further sequence analysis revealed that the C3177T mutation was also present in the virus recovered from the transfection of the vRNA, but the nucleotides at positions 3435 and 5322 were guanine residues similar to the parental virus. This suggests that the C3177T mutation may be induced by an adaptation to the 293T-MARC-145 coculture or serial passages in MARC-145 cells, while the G3435T and G5322A were specific mutations amplified during the GA process. To examine whether growth characteristics of the GA-derived virus resembled that of the parental virus, growth curve experiments were performed. As shown in Fig. 4B , the rescued GA-derived virus exhibited a growth rate similar to that of the RespPRRSV. Moreover, CPE patterns and plaque sizes were similar in cells infected with either virus (Fig. 4C and D) . Together, these results suggest that GA could be used to generate PRRSV in vitro to yield virus with parental growth characteristics. ",

To create a chimeric virus, three cDNA fragments, F1, F2, and F3, derived from RespPRRSV vRNA and the F4 fragment amplified from the vRNA of the Hun4 F112 strain were used (Fig. 5 ). Using the same GA protocol described above, an infectious chimeric virus was generated and verified by restriction fragment length polymorphism on two regions of the genome: the 5 region corresponding to the F1 fragment, and the 3 region corresponding to the F4 fragment. As shown in Fig. 6A , the digested 5 product of the chimeric virus showed a pattern similar to that of RespPRRSV, and was distinguishable from that of the Hun4 F112 strain. On the other hand, the digested 3 product of the chimeric virus displayed a pattern resembling the digested Hun4 F112 3 product, both of which differed from the RespPRRSV pattern, suggesting successful generation of a chimeric virus containing the 5 sequence of the RespPRRSV strain, and the 3 sequence of the Hun4 F112 strain. Primers specific for a small region of F1 were used to obtained DNA products representing the 5 end of the genome, and primers specific for a small region of F4 were used to generate DNA products representing the 3 end of the genome. 5 end products were digested with AatII and NaeI, while 3 end products were digested with EcoRV and NruI. Undigested and digested products were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel. Generation of chimeric viruses is useful in studying PRRSV biology and viral determinants of virulence. The chimeric virus generated here contains RespPRRSV F1-F3 fragments, which encode for non-structural ORF1ab gene, and Hun4 F112 F4 fragment, which encodes for structural ORFs 2-7 (Fig. 5) . Therefore, the chimeric virus can be used to study the role of structural genes on viral growth characteristics. Examination of plaque sizes in MARC-145 cells showed that this chimeric virus displayed a small plaque size similar to the RespPRRSV strain, unlike the Hun4 F112 strain which exhibited a much larger plaque size (Fig. 6B ). This suggests that ORF1ab, rather than ORFs 2-7, may play a more important role in determining the plaque size of the virus. Growth kinetics of the chimeric virus was also examined. As shown in Fig. 6C , the chimeric virus showed slower growth kinetics compared to the parental RespPRRSV or Hun4 F112, suggesting that non-structural genes originating from the RespPRRSV may not be compatible to the structural genes from the Hun4 F112. Altogether, these results highlight the efficacy of GA in studying PRRSV biology. Chimeric viruses containing genes of different viral strains can be conveniently generated and used to examine roles of viral genes in growth characteristics and virulence.",

Besides the length of time required and the possibility of introducing undesired mutations during the amplification of plasmid DNA in bacteria, the conventional bacterial cloning method may also encounter a problem with toxicity of certain viral sequences in the bacterial host. Many genomic cDNAs can be cloned successfully, but there are others such as the genomic cDNA of coronaviruses, nairoviruses and togaviruses that seem to be toxic when expressed in Escherichia coli (Bridgen, 2012; Ulper et al., 2008) . With GA, potential cytotoxicity to the bacterial host is eliminated. Furthermore, the GA method utilizes overlapping sequences in the DNA fragments to link the DNA fragments to each other, eliminating the need to add or alter sequences for restriction enzyme sites to accommodate ligation. Introduction of any foreign sequences that may alter function of the viral genes can be minimized (Siridechadilok et al., 2013) . GA thus provides an easy method to assemble the entire genome of a virus.",

This range of cDNA fragment sizes was selected for ease in amplifying sequences and to minimize the number of fragments added to the GA reaction. As it was previously reported that increasing the number of DNA fragments in the GA reaction negatively affected assembly efficiency (Gibson et al., 2009 (Gibson et al., , 2010 , amplification of two 8 kb cDNA fragments from vRNA was attempted. However, the small amount of cDNA obtained was insufficient for GA reactions. Therefore, amplification of smaller pieces of cDNA was chosen and proven to be more suitable for achieving sufficient amounts of DNA for assembly. This study's design for reconstructing the PRRSV genome using GA had an F4 fragment spanning all the structural genes, making it convenient to generate chimeric viruses that contain foreign structural genes. However, the generation of chimeric viruses via this method is not restricted to this design. As the size of DNA fragments used in GA reactions can be varied, a variety of chimeric viruses derived from different lengths of cDNA fragments can be obtained. Thus one can conveniently utilize the GA method to customize the generation of chimeric viruses.",

The transfected culture supernatant collected on day 3 post-transfection was infectious and caused CPE in the subsequent infection of MARC-145 cells. The observed incubation time for the virus recovery appeared similar to that of another reported system similarly utilizing a CMV promoter to generate vRNA in transfected cells (Wang et al., 2013) . It is, however, slightly slower than a virus recovery system utilizing a direct transfection of T7 promoter-driven, in vitro transcribed vRNA into MARC-145 cells. The culture supernatant of the later system was reported to be infectious by 24 h post-transfection (Zhang et al., 2011) . Thus, the CMV-driven system may require a longer incubation time than a direct transfection of vRNA. In agreement with these previous reports, we also observed more extensive CPE in vRNA transfected than the GA mixture transfected 293T-MARC-145 cocultures (data not shown) and in the subsequent infection of MARC-145 cells (Fig. 3A) . While the CMV-driven system may require longer time to recover infectious PRRSV, the elimination of the in vitro transcription step provides a clear advantage of using GA in generating PRRSV particles.",

One can amplify the corresponding F4 fragment from a field isolate and combine it with cDNA fragments derived from a vaccine strain. The resulting virus may be used as a vaccine candidate containing structural genes that match virus found in the field. Such a strategy was examined in our laboratory and an infectious chimeric virus was generated in the 293T-MARC-145 co-culture transfected with a GA reaction mixture. Unfortunately, the chimeric virus was not readily grown to a high titer in subsequent passages in MARC-145 cells. The virus needed several passages in MARC-145 cells before reaching a high titer (data not shown). This finding highlights the need to further improve the rescue protocol for viruses obtained from the field. It remains to be tested whether modified cell lines, such as PK15 or BHK-21 constitutively expressing CD163 shown to enhance the growth of PRRSV (Calvert et al., 2007; Delrue et al., 2010) , can be used to improve the virus recovery via the GA method.",

Because the GA reaction utilizes overlapping DNA sequences in the assembly process, it eliminates the need to alter viral sequences to accommodate restriction enzyme sites needed for conventional cloning of viral molecular clones.
