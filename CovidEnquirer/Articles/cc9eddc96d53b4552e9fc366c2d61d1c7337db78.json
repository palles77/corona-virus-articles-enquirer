Caring for the anxiety and frustration of these families is an integral part of critical care nursing. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a needs-based education programme provided within the first 3 days of patients' hospitalisation, on the anxiety levels and satisfaction of psychosocial needs of their families. This was a quasi-experimental study with pre-and post-test design. A convenience sample was recruited over a period of three months, consisting of one primary family carer of each critically ill patient who had been admitted to an ICU in Hong Kong. Conducted by an ICU nurse specially assigned for the purpose, family carers in the experimental group (n \u00bc 34) received an individual education programme based on the results of a literature review and an individual family needs assessment carried out at the time of patient admission, using the Critical Care Family Needs Inventory. The subjects in the control group (n \u00bc 32) received the usual orientation and explanation given by the ICU nurses. Anxiety and need satisfaction were measured in the two groups at pre-and post-test and their mean scores were compared. Of the ten most important statements identified by the family carers in the two groups, the statements regarding the needs for information and assurance were found to predominate. After the needs-based intervention, the experimental group reported significantly lower levels of anxiety and higher levels of satisfaction of family needs than the control group at the post-test. The findings support the effectiveness of providing families of newly admitted critically ill patients, with a needs-based educational intervention to allay anxiety and satisfy immediate psychosocial needs. The formulation of a family education programme should be based on the results of a needs assessment, in order to meet family carers' individual needs. r",

On the other hand, there is comparatively less time to care for patients' families or significant others (Gelling, 1999) . Millar (1991) indicated that nurses often unintentionally neglect the feelings and needs of families accompanying critically ill relatives.",

Sudden hospitalisation of a relative to an ICU or other critical care setting, as a consequence of acute or chronic illness, may result in emotional and psychosocial problems for their families. It is a catastrophic event for families and creates emotional upset, anxiety, uncertainty and fear of losing a loved one (Curry, 1995; Horn and Tesh, 2000) . These families often undergo psychological crises, especially within the first few days of the patient's hospitalisation (Hudak and Gallo, 1994; Lee, 1998) . Caring for the anxiety and concerns that families of critically ill patients face, is an integral part of psychosocial nursing. In order to allay the anxiety of families when patients are admitted to an ICU and prepare them for caring for their critically ill relatives, adequate and specific information that addresses families' immediate needs and concerns, should be given to them by critical care nurses, particularly during the first few days of patient hospitalisation (Read, 1998) . Although the importance of family needs is fully recognised in critical care nursing practice, family education based on the results of a needs assessment has not, hitherto, been examined in research and clinical practice (Potinkara and Paunonen, 1996) . Wong (1995) indicated that the high levels of stress and anxiety experienced by families with a critically ill relative, often relate to the uncertain prognosis of the patient and lack of familiarity with and feelings of threat about the ICU environment, with its high technology, complicated equipment, and other seriously ill patients. However, many researchers have shown that the specific needs and concerns of these families are not always met by health professionals (Kleinpell and Powers, 1992; Leung et al., 2000) . The most cited reasons for needs not being met, relate to nurses' lack of understanding and consideration of the importance of these needs to the families (Millar, 1991) .",

Any changes within the family can easily disturb roles and relationships and create anxiety and stress for every family member. If one family member encounters a stressful event, other family members will share the burden and show a collective obligation toward coping with the event (Tseng et al., 1995) .

Many researchers have found that families' rating of their health needs are often different from that rated by nurses (Daley, 1984; Potinkara and Paunonen, 1996) . Halm (1993) also indicated that nurses' intervention and education with regard to meeting family needs, is primarily formulated on untested assumptions regarding families' affective and behavioural responses and, thus, may result in ineffective or harmful outcomes. Therefore, the design of an education intervention for families in critical care should be based on the family's own perceptions of their educational needs and concerns, as suggested by critical care researchers in their recent studies (Horn and Tesh, 2000; Leung et al., 2000; Mendonca and Warren, 1998) .",

For this reason, the design, implementation and evaluation of a needs-based family education programme, provided by critical care nurses, would be important to family members during patients' hospitalisation in an ICU, for meeting their immediate psychosocial needs in such a stressful situation.

Similar to the current practice of other ICUs in Hong Kong after the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the ICU only allowed two family members to visit the patient each day. The visiting hours were from 12:00 to 13:30 and from 18:00 to 20:00.

For the A-State scale, subjects indicate how they feel at that moment on a 4-point Likert scale of increasing intensity from 1 \u00bc not at all to 4 \u00bc very much so. The A-Trait scale asks subjects to indicate how they generally feel, also on a 4-point Likert scale from 1 \u00bc almost never to 4 \u00bc almost always. Possible range of scores for each scale is from 20 (i.e., not anxious) to 80 (i.e., extremely high anxiety). Internal consistencies for the C-STAI are 0.90 and 0.81 for the A-State and A-Trait scales, respectively (Shek, 1988) .

The need statements are rated on two 4-point Likert scales. Subjects indicate their perceived importance of each need statement from 1 \u00bc not important to 4 \u00bc very important. Subjects also indicate their level of need satisfaction from 1 \u00bc never satisfied to 4 \u00bc almost always satisfied. Exploratory factor analysis by Leske (1991) indicated that it consists of five distinct domains ARTICLE IN PRESS of needs: information (8 items), assurance (7 items), support (15 items), comfort (6 items), and proximity (9 items). Satisfactory content validity and internal consistency reliability were reported (Leung et al., 2000) . Cronbach's alpha coefficients were: 0.84 for overall scale and 0.65-0.82 for five domains. In this study, the alpha coefficients were 0.83 for overall scale and ranged 0.76-0.85 for five domains.",

The content of the education programme was formulated based on the results of an individual family needs assessment undertaken at the pre-test, using the C-CCFNI, and the findings of several family needs studies of critically ill patients in Hong Kong Chinese population (Lee, 1998; Leung et al., 2000; Wong, 1995) . Each family carer's rating of the 45 need statements during the pre-test determined his/her priority of needs for education. The need statements perceived as important (i.e. with importance rated 3 or 4) and not satisfied (i.e. satisfaction rated 1 or 2) for each family carer in the experimental group, were listed in descending importance, grouped into themes and categories, and addressed in the two education sessions by the assigned ICU nurse. Those important needs identified at the pre-test by the family carers in the experimental group mainly included: the need for information such as what and why specific treatment and care is/was done and what they can do at the bedside for the patient; the need for assurance such as understanding the specific facts about the illness and the patient's expected outcome; and the need for support such as talking about the patient's death and negative feelings (e.g. guilt and anger).",

To increase consistency and continuity of nurse-family interactions, one ICU nurse who was specially assigned to care for the patient and his/her family conducted the orientation of the ICU and the two education sessions. To ensure family centred care, each family carer was approached by the assigned nurse during visiting time and was encouraged to talk about his/her concerns and express his/her emotions towards the patient's hospitalisation. Between Day 1 and Day 3, the assigned nurse undertook a daily follow-up telephone contact with the family carers to settle their concerns about any changes in the patient's condition and to answer any questions raised from the education sessions. Brykczynska (1995) suggested that these initiatives in interactions with patients and their family carers represent a collection of positive person-centred values. The assigned ICU nurse accommodated these values during and after the education programme. The consistent and continuous interactions would also be useful to establish a positive trust relationship between nurse and family carer of the patient under his/her care (Morse, 1991) .",

Of the 10 most important needs identified by the families in the experimental and control groups, the statements relating to the needs for information and assurance about the patients' conditions, were found to be predominant. They have also been highlighted as the most important needs in previous studies of family needs in different critical care settings, and in culturally diverse groups (Kleinpell and Powers, 1992; Lee, 1998; Quinn et al., 1996; Rukholm et al., 1991) . However, the ratings on the needs for information and assurance (Mean scores \u00bc 2.96-3.46) by the Chinese family carers in this study were relatively higher than those of previous Western studies, whose mean scores were between 2.8 and 3.3 (Quinn et al., 1996; Rukholm et al., 1991) . This finding may reflect the fact that Chinese families are more eager to have specific information concerning the patient's progress and treatment and to have specific directions or instructions when it comes to caring for the patient at his/her bedside. These most important needs expressed by the family carers, match the assumption of a high level of inter-dependence, filial responsibility and obligation for caring for each family member within Chinese culture. Negative feelings such as guilt and anger also prevailed among the Chinese family carers, reflecting their strong sense of responsibility concerning the health condition of their critically ill relative. Therefore, it is important for nurses to provide psychological and informational support to Chinese families at the earliest opportunity after the patient's admission to an ICU, in order to reduce their high level of anxiety and strong feelings of responsibility for the patient's critical illness and hospitalisation.",

Family education about the patient's condition, combined with receiving care and reassurance about how the best treatment and care is being given to the patient by health professionals, should be emphasised in critical care nursing.

When the critically ill relative was admitted to the ICU, most of the family members visited the patient at the earliest moment, and one of them would stay with the patient overnight. When approached by the assigned ICU nurses, most of them were very eager to understand more about the patient's condition and to participate in this study. The mean ratings of most of the 45 need statements in the C-CCFNI and the mean state anxiety score were higher than those reported in previous Western studies (Jamerson et al., 1996; Kosco and Warren, 2000; Mendonca and Warren, 1998; Rukholm et al., 1991) . These findings support the idea that Chinese families value harmony, mutual obligation, and family solidarity and place more emphasis on interdependence than on independence (Leung et al., 2000) , than in Western culture. Family members often seek to maintain the equilibrium and function of the family structure by supporting each other throughout any critical period. Mutual helping behaviour and participation in caring for the family member who has been sick, are frequently reported among the Chinese as indications of family solidarity (Yeh et al., 1994) .",

The level of statistical significance achieved in the testing suggests that there was less than a 5% chance of committing a Type II error and, thus, little chance of falsely accepting the null hypotheses. The two research hypotheses of this study were therefore supported. The findings support the importance of providing family members of a relative admitted to an ICU with wellstructured and appropriate education, based on the results of a needs assessment, so as to reduce their high anxiety and help satisfy their immediate psychosocial needs. The necessity for an individual needs assessment of family carers of patients with critical illness upon admission and the systematic planning of an education programme during the first few days of hospitalisation, based on the assessment results, should be undertaken in order to achieve a high quality of family oriented care.",

Indeed, Jamerson et al. (1996) and Leung et al.

The findings of this study warrant further empirical investigation of this needsbased family education programme in critical care settings, particularly with families from different socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds in Chinese and Western populations. Through such intervention, critical care nurses can provide a high quality family centred practice. However, other important elements within the education programme in terms of its structure and content may also have resulted in reported improvements in the family carers' psychosocial conditions in this study.
