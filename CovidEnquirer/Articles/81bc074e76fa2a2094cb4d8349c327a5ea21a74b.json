With the exception of adenoviruses, all possess an RNA genome. They are usually transmitted by direct hand to surface to hand contact and/or aerosol inhalation, and replicate in both upper and lower airways. Cellular and humoral immunity are both activated in response to respiratory viral infections as well as neural pathways, which contribute to distant inflammatory effects. Respiratory viruses are responsible for a wide variety of clinical syndromes including the common cold, acute otitis media, laryngitis, sinusitis, pneumonia, bronchiolitis, influenza, and exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Diagnosis of respiratory viral infections is primarily clinical and is further supported by laboratory techniques such as antigen detection, culture, serology and more recently nucleic acid detection. Preventive strategies are based on avoidance of risk factors and vaccination when indicated. Treatment modalities include over-the-counter and non-specific remedies along with a small number of specific antiviral medications such as the influenza neuraminidase inhibitors.",

            "text": "Human rhinoviruses (RVs), which probably represent the most abundant pathogenic microorganisms universally, are RNA viruses and belong to the family of Picornaviridae. The Picornaviridae also include the enteroviruses (polio, coxsackie, and echo viruses), which are more closely related to RVs, and the cardio-and aphtho-viruses, which do not infect the respiratory tract. Coxsackie virus A2, 10, 21, 24 and B2, 5 and echovirus type 1, 11, 19, 20, and 22 are the most frequently isolated enteroviral agents in upper respiratory tract infections. More than 100 serotypes of RVs are identified and numbered. They are divided into major (90%) and minor (10%) groups depending on their receptor; major RVs attach to the intercellular adhesion molecule-1, while low-density lipoprotein receptor is the cellular receptor of minor RVs. RVs consist of a 2 MDa single-stranded positive-sense genomic RNA surrounded by a nonenveloped capsid arranged in an icosahedron, 20-30 nm in diameter ( Figure 1 ). VP1, 2, and 3 structural proteins of the virus are highly variable surface proteins, which interact with antiviral antibodies. VP4 is confined to the interior of the capsid and is closely associated with the viral RNA. Orthomyxoviridae's major representatives are the influenza viruses (IFVs), which are grouped into three types: A, B, and C. IFVs are negative-stranded segmented RNA viruses. The A and B types are enveloped pleomorphic agents, with spherical and filamentous forms; IFV-C is structurally distinct. IFVs attach to sialic acid receptors on ciliated columnar epithelial cells in the tracheobronchial tree via their hemagglutinin (HA) protein ( Figure 2 ). Following replication, the virion is released by enzymatic action of the neuraminidase (NA) surface protein. The latter, along with the HA protein of the virus, is regularly subjected to small changes, which are capable of producing viral strains causing annual epidemics. This phenomenon is called 'antigenic drift', while 'antigenic shift' is the process by which a sudden major change in the HA or NA proteins of IFV-A occurs due to genetic reassortment. The latter is responsible for influenza pandemics, which have occurred every 10-40 years.",

Direct detection is based on the identification of whole virus or inclusion bodies with electron or light microscopy, respectively.

Viral cultures usually demonstrate the biological effects of an agent, such as the cytopathic effect or hemagglutination, in cultured cells. Culture Figure 4 Pathogenesis of respiratory viral infections. Respiratory viruses enter the human body mainly through the nose. Thereafter, they replicate in nasopharyngeal epithelial cells, but also in the lower respiratory tract. Immune mediators such as cytokines, chemokines, and bradykinins will both elicit an 'immune' response leading to effective virus eradication and contribute to the development of associated symptomatology, through vascular leakage and increased glandular secretions. Neurogenic pathways are also involved in the development of clinical manifestations. Reproduced with permission from Dr N G Papadopoulos. methods, however, have drawbacks due to their low sensitivity and extensive time length (days to weeks). Determination of specific viral antibodies in a host's blood sample and comparison between acute and convalescent phases of respiratory illness is another diagnostic modality, which is mainly used for epidemiological purposes. Serological tests include immunoassays, complement fixation, and passive agglutination assays as well as hemagglutination inhibition. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques are being developed, replacing in several instances other techniques as they are rapid and sensitive, and may also provide an estimation of the number of viral copies present in a given biological sample (real-time PCR). Control of the transmission of respiratory infections may be partly achieved through adequate hygiene practices and avoidance of congregation and stress. The development of effective vaccines is hampered by the large number of viral serotypes; however, vaccines are available against IFVs, several RSV and PIV vaccine candidates are currently under clinical investigation, and oral live attenuated adenovirus vaccines have been successfully used in military recruitment centers in the past. Over-thecounter remedies for the alleviation and reduction of duration of common cold symptoms include vitamin C, zinc, and echinacea, although these agents are only moderately effective. Nasal decongestants, first generation antihistamines, anticholinergic nasal sprays, oral and intranasal a-adrenergic agonists, inhalation of humidified hot air at 42-441C, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and cromones have been proposed for symptomatic relief with moderate results. A combination of specific antivirals with one or more anti-inflammatory drugs may offer the ideal therapeutic approach since it would both inhibit viral replication and block inflammatory events, although cost and compliance are considerable obstacles.",
