It has only been within the past 15 years that viruses have been identified as the cause of foal diarrhea outbreaks.\" Since then, intensive investigations have been undertaken to further define the possible causes of diarrhea, and rotavirus has been identified as the most common cause of foal enteritis in Central Kentucky, Ireland, and Great Britain.lO, 19 Rotavirus outbreaks most commonly occur in intensive horse breeding areas throughout the world, Although the disease is highly contagious, few mortalities occur, which sometimes leads to the conclusion that the disease is not particularly significant. No study has outlined the actual cost of this disease to the horse industry; however, on one Standardbred farm, 54 foals valued at between 2 and 3 million dollars were sick at the same time: In addition to the value of the animals at risk, the economic impact of this disease is significant in the cost of fluid and drug therapy, increased labor to manage sick foals, and precautionary measures of using protective clothing and disinfection to contain the outbreak. An effective equine rotavirus vaccine is not currently available, although other prophylactic measures have proven effective, This article discusses information on equine rotavirus and provides practitioners with practical techniques of prevention and control on breeding farms.",

It is theorized that adult animals may periodically shed rotavirus into the environment. Because the virus may persist in the environment for as long as 9 months,37 a buildup of contamination occurs, especially when poor disinfection practices exist during the foaling season. Eventually, foals are exposed to a dose of virus that exceeds the level of protective local and systemic immunity, causing varying degrees of diarrhea. Also, many outbreaks have occurred after a mare and foal have shipped onto the farm and been immediately introduced into the resident herd without a period of quarantine. The foal, incubating the disease, breaks with diarrhea and begins an outbreak on the farm of immunologically naive foals . Rotaviruses are transmitted by the fecal-oral route, with foals ingesting feed or licking surfaces contaminated with the virus. During an incubation time of 18 to 24 hours, the virus infiltrates the epithelium of the villus tips of the duodenum and jejunum. 14 The loss of these functional absorptive cells results in maldigestion and malabsorption, causing diarrhea of varying severity. Because the intestinal crypt cells are not affected and continue to replicate to replace these absorptive cells, most cases are self-limiting. Although the very contagious nature of the disease may cause high morbidity, with proper treatment, the disease has low mortality. Foals may become infected with the virus but be subclinical shedders during farm outbreaks, thereby further contaminating the environment with virus.'9",

In geographic regions where gastric ulceration has been a problem in foals, antiulcer medication should be started as a prophylactic treatment. 2 The histamine-2 antagonists cimetidine and ranitidine have been used successfully to treat gastric ulcers in foals. One of these drugs is usually given along with sucralfate, which forms an ulcer-adherent \"bandage\" to protect the ulcerated area from further damage from hydrochloric acid, pepsin, and bile. To help reintroduce beneficial bacteria such as Lactobacillus into the gut, products such as Probiocin Brand Equine Oral Gel (Microbial Genetics, West Des Moines, IA) are often used and seem to help in some foals with enteritis. Plain, nonflavored yogurt with active cultures (30 to 60 mL orally, BID) also works well and is palatable, inexpensive, and readily available. Foals that develop high fevers should be judiciously treated with dipyrone or flunixin meglumine. Phenylbutazone and aspirin should be avoided, as they can cause gastric ulcers.! Systemic and oral antibiotics should be avoided in routine cases of rota virus enteritis; their use should be reserved for foals that have concurrent bacterial infections such as salmonellosis or other serious conditions that may predispose foals to secondary bacterial infections.",

Equipment such as pitchforks and rakes should not be used in sick foals' stalls and then used throughout the barn: remember that only 1 mL of diarrheic feces is extremely infectious.

This isolation period should also be used for animals that return from a veterinary hospital stay, because they are stressed and may have been exposed to infectious agents.

Dosing foals orally with hyperimmune equine serum or bovine colostrum are also avenues that need to be researched for their potential effectiveness. Vaccination of foals younger than 3 months of age would likely be blocked by any maternal antibody present. Studies are in progress to document the colostral transfer of rota virus antibodies from mare to foal (Dwyer RM, Saif LJ, 1992) . Initial prepartum vaccination trials of pony mares suggest that passive protection of foals against rota virus is possible. 9",
