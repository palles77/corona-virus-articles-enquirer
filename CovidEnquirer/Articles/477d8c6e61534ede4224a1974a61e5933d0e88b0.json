The result indicated that KPEDV-9 at the 93rd passage revealed reduced pathogenicity in the neonatal pigs. Pregnant sows inoculated with the attenuated virus showed increased immune responses by ELISA. In addition, delivered piglets were protected from challenge of wild type PEDV. The safety test in pregnant sows indicated that all inoculated animals farrowed the average numbers of litters of piglets. The results of this study supported that the attenuated virus derived from serial passage could be applied as vaccine for protecting suckling piglets against PEDV infection. #",

Propagation of PEDV in vitro was rather limited until Vero cells were found to support the growth of virus in the presence of trypsin [5] .

The isolate of PEDV was originated from a neonatal pig and plaque puri\u00aeed in Vero cells. The isolate, designated KPEDV-9, was passaged in 80\u00b190% monolayers of Vero cells in alpha-MEM with 0.02% yeast extract, 0.3% tryptose phosphate broth (TPB) and 1\u00b12 mg of trypsin as described [5, 6] . Sequential passages of the virus were normally conducted in roller culture. Each passage level of virus was stored at \u00c0708C or freeze-dried with equal volume of stabilizer (0.217 M Vaccine 17 (1999) 2546\u00b12553 0264-410X/99/$ -see front matter # 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The \u00aenal stock of the PEDV was characterized in two ways. Firstly, the culture supernatant was subjected to direct centrifugation at 60,000 \u00c2 g for 2 h and the pellet was resuspended to 1/200 of initial volume for morphological identi\u00aecation by transmission electron microscopy. Secondly, the virus infected cells were subjected to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect speci\u00aec PEDV sequences. Three primers for RT-PCR were selected from the sequences information of membrane protein (M) gene of Duarte et al. [7] .

After ampli\u00aecation, the PCR products were cloned into pUC19 vector for sequencing using Sequenase version 2.0 (USB, USA). In addition, the presence of adventitious virus such as porcine parvovirus (PPV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Hog cholera virus (HCV) and other cythopathogenic viruses were examined as described previously [9\u00b111].",

Previously, we found that PEDV infections were related to more than 20% of diarrheal cases in the neonatal pigs, thus causing a considerable losses in pig industry [13] . In fact, \u00aeeld application of attenuated virus as vaccine resulted in the overall reduction of mortality of neonatal pigs (2\u00b1 Fig. 3 . Immune responses of pregnant sows inoculated with cell attenuated KPEDV-9 strain. Animals were inoculated twice at 2-week intervals and serum samples were tested by ELISA. Table 2 Survival of piglets from attenuated KPEDV-9 vaccinated sows (V) and unvaccinated control (C) after challenge exposure 52% compared with before vaccination) in the farms having PEDV outbreak [16] . Nevertheless, it is worthy to note that the ecacy of protection was rather complicated and con\u00aficting according to the challenge dose like other enteric diseases. Although the pregnant pigs inoculated with attenuated virus showed the increased immune status by ELISA as compared to uninoculated control, it is dicult to explain the exact relation to mucosal immunity for protection. Since it was well con\u00aermed that the mechanisms of the passive immunity are extensively related to the presence of IgA and IgM antibodies [17] , further experiments, including detection of antibody secreting cells of IgA and IgM, may give the practical information for immunoprophylaxis against PEDV.",
