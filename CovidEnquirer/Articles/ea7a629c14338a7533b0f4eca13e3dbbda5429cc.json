Papich w KEY POINTS \u2022 Most antiviral drugs available for treatment of canine and feline viral infections are nucleoside analogues with greatest activity against herpesvirus and retrovirus infections. \u2022 Because antiviral drugs also affect the function of host cell machinery, they have considerable potential for toxicity. \u2022 Antiviral drugs are widely used in human medicine for treatment of herpesvirus, HIV and other viral infections. Much less is known about these medications in dogs and cats and there are few diseases of dogs and cats for which efficacy has been demonstrated. \u2022 Because of important differences between human and animal virus infections, one should never assume that an antiviral agent used in people should be used in animals unless there is proof of safety and efficacy. \u2022 Antiviral drugs used to treat feline herpesviral infections include famciclovir, idoxuridine, and cidofovir. Zidovudine is the only antiretroviral drug that has demonstrated efficacy for treatment of cats, primarily for FIV infections. \u2022 Antiviral drugs can act synergistically with immunomodulators. \u2022 Immunomodulators include microbial products, plant-derived immunomodulators, naturally occurring mammalian proteins, glucocorticoids, and synthetic compounds such as pentoxifylline and opioids. The effect of many of these drugs on outcome in dogs and cats with infectious diseases has not been fully evaluated using large, prospective, randomized, masked, controlled clinical trials. \u2022 The parenteral use of natural or recombinant human protein immunomodulators in dogs and cats may result in the formation of neutralizing antibodies after 1 to 2 weeks of treatment, which can cross-react with endogenous proteins.",

As a result, antiviral agents typically have a restricted spectrum of activity. In contrast to most antibacterial drugs, antiviral drugs can also affect the function of host cell machinery and thus antiviral drugs have a greater risk of toxicity. In addition to acute toxicities such as marrow suppression, many antiviral agents are immunosuppressive, carcinogenic, and teratogenic. Many are given topically in order to minimize systemic toxicity. Antiviral agents are more likely to be effective when an intact host immune response is present. Combinations of antiviral drugs with different mechanisms of action and combinations of antiviral and immunomodulatory drugs are increasingly being used to treat human viral infections, especially HIV infection, with an associated decrease in toxicity and reduction in selection for drug-resistant mutants.",

            "text": "Although all antiviral drugs used to treat small animals were originally developed for treatment of human viral infections, the application of these drugs to treat viral infections of small animals has not proven straightforward. This relates to differences in the composition of human and companion animal viruses (which affect their susceptibility to inactivation by antiviral drugs), or problems relating to toxicity of human antiviral drugs in dogs and cats. Antiviral drugs can be classified based on their spectrum of activity (i.e., family of viruses that are inhibited) and their mode of action. Antiviral drugs used in small animal medicine are primarily effective against herpesviruses or retroviruses, and most are nucleoside analogues. Nucleoside analogues resemble host nucleosides, which are nitrogenous bases with an attached sugar molecule used as a building block for the formation of DNA or RNA (Figure 7-1) . Use of nucleoside analogues by viruses during replication leads to the formation of abnormal nucleic acids or termination of nucleic acid synthesis. Latent viral infections are not affected because the replication of latent virus is suspended. However, reactivation of these infections can be reduced in frequency or prevented. Examples of nucleoside analogues and their spectrum of activity are shown in Figure 7 -1 and Table 7 -1. Other antiviral drugs that have been used in clinical veterinary medicine include amino acids (l-lysine) and neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir). The value of other treatments such as small inhibitory RNA molecules for viral infections of small animals is also under investigation. 1",

These drugs are activated by the herpesviral enzyme thymidine kinase (TK), which phosphorylates them to a monophosphate form. Host cell enzymes then phosphorylate the drugs further to triphosphate forms, which concentrate in virus-infected cells and interfere with viral DNA replication via inhibition of the viral DNA polymerase enzyme. Because the DNA polymerases of different herpesviruses are inhibited to varying degrees by acyclovir triphosphate, not all herpesviral infections are equally susceptible. Drug resistance results from reduced viral TK activity, altered viral TK, or altered viral DNA polymerase. The antiherpesviral drugs cidofovir, idoxuridine, trifluridine, and vidarabine are not dependent on viral TK for phosphorylation and so have greater host cell toxicity. In small animal medicine, these four drugs have been used topically to treat ocular feline herpesviral infections.",

In human patients, acyclovir is widely used to treat herpes simplex and varicella-zoster virus infections, both of which are \u03b1-herpesviruses. In small animal medicine, acyclovir has primarily been used to treat feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1) infections, although FHV-1 has a much lower susceptibility to the drug compared with the human herpesviruses. 2 Acyclovir has also been used to treat canine herpesvirus-1 (CHV-1) infections in puppies (see Chapter 16) . Other nucleoside analogues (trifluridine, idoxuridine, cidofovir, ganciclovir, and penciclovir) show much greater activity than acyclovir against FHV-1 in vitro. [2] [3] [4] Topical acyclovir has been used with limited success to treat feline herpetic dermatitis 5 and keratitis. 6 Topical treatment requires frequent (>4 times a day) application for beneficial effect. 6 The oral bioavailability of acyclovir is low in cats, and high doses are required to achieve adequate serum drug concentrations. 7 Valacyclovir, the prodrug for acyclovir, is rapidly converted to acyclovir by a first-pass effect after oral administration, and administration of the prodrug results in improved oral bioavailability of acyclovir. Unfortunately, administration of high doses of acyclovir or valacyclovir to cats has resulted in significant toxicity, including myelosuppression, renal tubular necrosis, and hepatic necrosis, without effective suppression of viral replication. 8 Thus the use of systemic acyclovir and valacyclovir to treat cats with herpesvirus infections is not recommended.",

            "text": "Of all antiviral drugs used to treat small animal patients, penciclovir and famciclovir have shown the greatest promise. Penciclovir is another guanosine analogue (see Figure 7 -1). It is present at much higher concentrations and for longer duration in cells than is acyclovir, which permits less frequent dosing. In humans, the prodrug famciclovir is well absorbed orally and rapidly converted to penciclovir, leading to increased oral bioavailability of penciclovir. Most of the drug is eliminated unchanged in the urine, and so dose reduction may be required for animals with decreased kidney function. In human patients, the concurrent administration of food decreases peak plasma concentrations without affecting overall bioavailability. In humans with herpes simplex virus and herpes zoster infections, famciclovir is as effective as acyclovir. In contrast, penciclovir (and thus famciclovir) have been shown to be potent inhibitors of FHV-1 replication (which is not the case for acyclovir). Penciclovir-resistant mutants of FHV-1 with altered TK enzymes have been described. 9 Administration of famciclovir to cats at dosages comparable to those used in other species results in much lower plasma concentrations and a longer time to development of peak plasma concentrations of penciclovir when compared with other animal species, which suggests altered absorption or metabolism of famciclovir in cats. 10 High doses of famciclovir have been required to achieve adequate plasma drug concentrations. Nevertheless, famciclovir is well tolerated when administered orally to cats at doses that produce clinical responses. 5, 10, 11 Treatment of cats with experimentally induced FHV-1 conjunctivitis with famciclovir at 90 mg/kg PO q8h for 21 days resulted in lower clinical and pathologic disease scores and decreased viral shedding when compared with placebo-treated cats. 11 Clinical responses also occur in naturally infected cats with both acute and chronic manifestations of disease with negligible adverse effects. 5 Because of saturation of the metabolism of famciclovir to penciclovir, equivalent serum and tear penciclovir concentrations can be achieved in cats with 40 or 90 mg/kg PO q8h of famciclovir, so 40 mg/kg PO q8h is considered equally efficacious. 12, 13 Clinical improvement often occurs within a week of treatment.",

Only oseltamivir has been used to any great extent in small animals. Amantadine, which also has antagonistic effects at the NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) receptor, has been used to treat osteoarthritis in animals in combination with other drugs. 34 Oseltamivir Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is the prodrug of oseltamivir carboxylate (GS4071), a potent inhibitor of influenza virus neuraminidase. Oseltamivir was developed because of the poor oral bioavailability of zanamivir, a neuraminidase inhibitor that is structurally similar to GS4071. Neuraminidase is a surface glycoprotein of both influenza A and influenza B viruses (see Figure 7 -2). The viral neuraminidase cleaves sialic acid residues on the surface of infected cells, which allows new virus particles to be released from host cells. It also prevents aggregation of virus particles after they are released and facilitates spread of the virus through the mucus of the respiratory tract by cleaving sialic acid residues in mucin.",

A single prospective, randomized, masked, placebo-controlled trial of 35 dogs with CPV enteritis showed that dogs treated with oseltamivir (2 mg/kg PO q12h) had no significant drop in their white blood cell count, whereas untreated dogs had a significant drop in their white blood cell count in the first 5 days of hospitalization. 37 Treated dogs also gained weight during hospitalization, whereas untreated dogs lost weight. However, there was no difference in hospitalization time, treatments needed, clinical scores, morbidity, or mortality between the two groups, and the number of dogs in each group was small. No significant adverse drug effects were observed, but oseltamivir was administered as a 1:1 dilution with water, in order to reduce reactions to the taste of the drug and vomiting shortly after drug administration. The authors acknowledged that there were potential concerns that related to administration of an oral medication to dogs with enteritis, with variability in drug absorption.",

Bacterial neuraminidase enzymes may play a role in biofilm formation and help bacteria to invade mucin layers of the respiratory tract. 38 It has been suggested that gut bacteria may use neuraminidase enzymes to cleave sialic acid residues on gastrointestinal epithelial cells, which exposes receptor sites for bacterial adherence.",

Unfortunately, mixed results have been obtained after parenteral and oral administration to cats with retrovirus infections, and parenteral IFN-\u03b1 was not effective for treatment of FIP. 61 Parenteral administration can lead to the development of neutralizing antibodies and apparent loss of activity after 3 or 7 weeks. 62 Oral administration of a low dose of rhIFN-\u03b1 to treat viral infections of animals has been controversial because of proteolytic degradation of rhIFN-\u03b1 by gastric acid. Nevertheless, beneficial outcomes have been reported in some cats with FHV-1, FeLV, and FIV infections, presumably because immunomodulation follows mucosal absorption of the drug. Topical application of rhIFN-\u03b1 to the eye has been used to treat FHV-1 keratitis, but controlled studies using this treatment are lacking.

            "text": "Pentoxifylline is a synthetic methylxanthine derived from theobromine. It is a broad-spectrum phosphodiesterase inhibitor with a variety of immunomodulatory properties. In rodents and humans it inhibits TNF-\u03b1, Il-1, Il-6, and Il-12 production, as well as the activation of T and B cells, and increases neutrophil mobility and chemotaxis. It increases erythrocyte cAMP levels, which results in increased erythrocyte deformability, lowered blood viscosity, and improved microcirculation and tissue perfusion. Pentoxifylline also decreases platelet aggregation, and increases tissue plasminogen activator in patients with hyperaggregable platelets, so may be useful for treatment of disorders that result in hypercoagulable states. The value of pentoxifylline for treatment of endotoxemia has been primarily studied in horses. Despite significant decreases in TNF and IL-6 activity after incubation of equine monocytes with pentoxifylline in vitro, these effects did not occur in horses in vivo. 87 Beneficial effects of pentoxifylline are limited in horses when administered IV after challenge with endotoxin. 88 In dogs, pentoxifylline has been used to treat a variety of skin diseases, including canine atopic dermatitis, dermatomyositis, and cutaneous vasculopathies. 89, 90 In cats it has been used to treat FIP, but a masked, placebo-controlled study of the related drug propentofylline showed no benefit of treatment. 91 In dogs, pentoxifylline has a low and unpredictable oral bioavailability and a short half-life, and so three-times-daily administration has been recommended. Adverse effects include vomiting and decreased appetite, which are more likely to occur when the tablets are crushed. Crushed tablets are also unpalatable to cats.",
