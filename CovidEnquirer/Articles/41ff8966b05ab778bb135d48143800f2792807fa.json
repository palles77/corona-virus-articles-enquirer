Predicted features in the Vaxign pipeline include protein subcellular location, transmembrane helices, adhesin probability, conservation to human and/or mouse proteins, sequence exclusion from genome(s) of nonpathogenic strain(s), and epitope binding to MHC class I and class II. The precomputed Vaxign database contains prediction of vaccine targets for > 70 genomes. Vaxign also performs dynamic vaccine target prediction based on input sequences. To demonstrate the utility of this program, the vaccine candidates against uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) were predicted using Vaxign and compared with various experimental studies. Our results indicate that Vaxign is an accurate and efficient vaccine design program.",

            "text": "Reverse vaccinology is an emerging vaccine development approach that starts with the prediction of vaccine targets by bioinformatics analysis of microbial genome sequences [1] . Predicted proteins are selected based on desirable attributes. Normal wet laboratory experiments are conducted in a later stage to test all or selected vaccine targets. Rino Rappuoli, the pioneer of reverse vaccinology [1, 2] , first applied this approach to the development of a vaccine against serogroup B Neisseria meningitidis (MenB), the major cause of sepsis and meningitis in children and young adults [2] . In this study, bioinformatic methods were first used to screen the complete genome of a MenB strain MC58 for genes encoding putative surface-exposed or secreted proteins. These proteins were predicted to be antigenic and therefore may represent the most suitable vaccine candidates. In total, 350 novel vaccine candidates were predicted and expressed in Escherichia coli; 28 were found to elicit protective immunity. It took less than 18 months to identify more vaccine candidates in MenB than had been discovered during the past 40 years by conventional methods [2] . Since then, the concept of reverse vaccinology has also successfully been applied to other pathogens, including Bacillus anthracis [3] , Porphyromonas gingivalis [4] , Chlamydia pneumoniae [5] , Streptococcus pneumoniae [6] , Helicobacter pylori [7] , and Mycobacterium tuberculosis [8] . Compared to a conventional vaccine development approach that starts from the wet laboratory, reverse vaccinology begins with bioinformatics analysis, which dramatically quickens the process of vaccine development.",

Subcellular location is still considered as one main criterion for vaccine target prediction. However, more criteria have been added. For example, since it was found that outer membrane proteins containing more than one transmembrane helix were, in general, difficult to clone and purify [2] , the number of transmembrane domains for a vaccine target is often considered in bioinformatics filtering. More and more genomes are now available for each pathogenic species. It is now required to examine all completed genomes and predict vaccine targets that are conserved in all genomes. If genomes from non-pathogenic strains of the species are also available, ideal vaccine targets are those that exist in genomes of virulent pathogen strains but are absent from the avirulent strains. To induce strong immunity and avoid autoimmunity, predicted vaccine targets are required not to have sequence similarity to proteins of hosts (e.g., human). Epitope-based vaccines have been demonstrated to induce protection against many infectious diseases [9] . To optimize epitope vaccines, it has become an essential task to predict immune epitopes from protective antigens.",

Although many individual software programs are available to aid in vaccine target prediction [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] , they are individually developed for different purposes and contain disparate data formats and programming settings. This makes tool and data integration difficult. Successful use of these tools often requires local installation, command line execution, and substantial computational power. Many tools are not optimized for high throughput data processing. NERVE, for example, is a new enhanced reverse vaccinology environment that includes several steps of programs for reverse vaccinology [18] . NERVE aims to help save time and money in vaccine design. However, it also requires software download and database setup. In addition, NERVE does not include precomputed data of vaccine target prediction, which makes the prediction time extensive. In addition, NERVE does not perform MHC class I and II epitope predictions.",

Over half (53%) of all women (and 14% of men) experience at least one urinary tract infection (UTI), leading to an estimated 6.8 million annual physician visits in the United States alone, 1.3 million emergency room visits, and 246,000 hospitalizations of women with an annual cost of more than $2.4 billion [28] . Although many groups have attempted to develop vaccines against UPEC [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] , no preparations are yet in general use in the United States. Complete and annotated genomic sequences have now been determined for four strains of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli including CFT073, UTI89, 536, and F11; these UPEC strains were isolated from human cases of cystitis, pyelonephritis, and/or bacteremia. These provide a basis for predicting UPEC vaccine targets using these genome sequences based on reverse vaccinology. Recently, we have also performed several high throughput proteomic and genomic studies including in vivo microarray [34] , proteomics of urine-grown bacteria [35] , and in vivo induced antigen technology (IVIAT) [36] . We hypothesized that vaccine targets predicted based on genome analysis largely correlate with the results obtained from these high throughput data analyses.",

The predicted features in Vaxign include protein subcellular location, transmembrane helices, adhesin probability, sequence conservation among pathogen genomes, and sequence similarity to host (human and mouse) proteomes. For those pathogens against which a strong B cell response (for antibody production) is critical, surface-exposed proteins such as secreted proteins and outer membrane proteins (especially adhesins) are ideal targets for vaccine development. For these pathogens, nonsurface proteins such as cytoplasmic or inner membrane proteins, however, may not represent good targets for vaccine development due to lack of close contact with the host cells [1, 2] . However, for the vaccine development against those pathogens where T cell response is critical, subcellular localization is not an issue since a T cell response could be directed to any protein target. It has been reported that 250 out of 600 vaccine candidates from N. meningitidis B failed to be cloned and expressed due to the presence of more than one transmembrane spanning region [2] . Therefore, it might also be prudent to ignore those proteins with multiple transmembrane spanning regions in the first place. The adherence of microbial pathogens to host cells is mediated by adhesins. Adhesins are essential for bacterial colonization and survival and represent possible targets for vaccine development. The conserved vaccine targets among different strains in one pathogen offer protection against these different strains. A vaccine candidate with similar sequence to the host (e.g., human or mouse) is likely to be a poor immunogen due to epitope mimicry, or if an immune response is triggered, cause autoimmunity in the host [44] [45] [46] . These aspects are considered in the Vaxign prediction pipeline ( Figure 1 ).",

All open source programs (e.g., BLAST) have been customized. The Vaxitope (vaccine epitope prediction) is a new program that is internally developed and will be described later in this paper in more detail. One focus of the Vaxign development was to seamlessly incorporate different programs with different development styles and even program languages into a comprehensive analysis system. To achieve this goal, MySQL relational database was used to replace plain text input files typically used in original programs. In a typical scenario, output data of one program is stored in MySQL, and SQL query scripts are used to retrieve and process the data as input for another program. Each component program except Vaxitope in the Vaxign pipeline has individually been tested and validated in the literature [10] [11] [12] [13] . The testing of Vaxitope is described below.",

In PSSM, a Tyr-Trp substitution at position A of an alignment may receive a very different score than the same substitution at position B. In contrast, in position-independent matrices such as the PAM and BLOSUM matrices, the Tyr-Trp substitution receives the same score no matter at what position it occurs.

            "text": "To evaluate the performance of Vaxitope, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was generated for prediction of epitopes against 40 MHC class I or II alleles ( Table 2 ). The ROC analysis detects the ability of predictions to classify each predicted epitope peptide into MHC class I or II binding based on its comparison with existing epitope database [40] . Plotting the rates of truepositive predictions (sensitivity) as a function of the rate of false-positive predictions (1-specificity) gives an ROC curve. For example, a ROC curve based on Vaxign analysis was generated using HLA A * 0201 specific PSSM ( Figure 2 ). HLA A * 0201 is one of the most studied HLA MHC Class I allele. According to the IEDB immune epitope database [27] , 3216 epitopes are known to positively bind to this allele (as positive testing dataset), and 4826 epitopes cannot bind to this allele (as negative testing dataset). The positive HLA A * 0201 alleles were used to calculate the True Positive Rate (Sensitivity). The negative alleles were used to calculate the False Positive Rate (1-Specificity) ( Figure 2 ). The areas under the ROC curve (AUC) provide a way to measure prediction quality. An AUC of 0.5 represents random predictions, and an AUC of 1.0 indicates perfect predictions [16] . The value of the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) for the HLA A * 0201 analysis using Vaxitope is 0.929. Our analysis of 30 alleles indicates that Vaxitope is a very specific and sensitive method for MHC Class I and II binding epitope prediction ( Table 2) . It is interesting to compare Vaxign and RANKPEP since both methods are based on PSSM. If only AUC values are taken into account, our prediction results are in general better than the results predicted by RANKPEP [15] . However, the results may not be comparable, since the data required to generate PSSMs might be different. Different from RANKPEP, which uses a percentage or top number as the cut off as shown in RANKPEP [15] , Vaxitope defines statistical P-values based on a random sequence model that assumes each position in a random sequence is generated according to the average letter frequencies of all sequences in the NCBI peptide non-redundant database [39] . Our studies indicate that the P value of .05 provides a cutoff with high and balanced sensitivity and specificity ( Table 2) . Another unique feature in Vaxitope is that it integrates with other vaccine design components in Vaxign. For example, the input sequence of Vaxitope may come from those peptides that are part of an outer membrane protein and exposed outside the bacterial membrane ( Figure 3 ). These protein peptides are predicted by Vaxign and easily available as input data for Vaxitope. Vaxitope also allows genome-wide query on different MHC host species.",

These four genomes contain 4704-5379 genes. Only outer membrane proteins (OMP) are predicted and analyzed. From the total 5379 proteins in UPEC strain CFT073, Vaxign detects 107 outer membrane proteins. Among the 107 proteins, three proteins contain more than one transmembrane helix. Vaxign further predicts 70 proteins from the 107 OMPs in strain CFT073 as possible adhesins or adhesinlike proteins [34] . These predicted adhesins are likely critical for colonization, a major challenge facing UPEC in the urinary tract. While some of these proteins, such as PapC [47] , are adhesins, many of these 70 proteins (e.g., Hma, FepA) predicted to be adhesins are not typically considered as adhesins. The roles of these adhesin-like proteins in adhering to host cells require further investigation. None of these 70 proteins shows sequence similarity to any human or mouse proteins. Similar strategy was applied to obtain vaccine targets for the other three UPEC strains (Figure 4) .",

In total, 85 OMPs were found to be conserved across all four pathogenic UPEC strains ( Figure 4 ). Among these 85 OMPs, two proteins (NP 755264.1, NP 756232.1) are predicted to contain three transmembrane helixes. Multiple transmembrane helixes make it difficult to purify recombinant proteins [48] . Therefore, these two proteins may not be good vaccine targets as whole protein antigens. When adhesin probability is taken into account, 58 out of the 83 proteins have an adhesin probability of \u2265 .051. Functional gene enrichment analysis was performed to classify the roles of these 58 OMPs using the software DAVID (Table 3) . Only 48 genes have annotation in DAVID and thus included in the DAVID analysis. Among these 48 8 genes, significantly enriched function annotations are in the areas of transport activities, TonB-dependent receptor (beta-barrel), Gram-negative porin, iron ion transmembrane transporter activity, and fimbrial biogenesis in outer membrane (Table 3) . Of these 58 outer membrane proteins identified by Vaxign, 36 were further found to be present in the nonpathogenic E. coli K-12 strain MG1655 [43] . K-12 is used to remove those proteins that have been exposed to the host environment (e.g., gut) and may be tolerant by the host [49] . Only 22 proteins have been identified to be unique to the pathogenic UPEC strains (Figure 4) .",

Our analysis indicates that Vaxign specifically and sensitively predicts known vaccine targets and also provides new vaccine target candidates deserving further wet lab confirmation.

While UPEC FimH was reported to be a protective antigen [52] , it was not included in our list of predicted genes (Table 4 ). FimH is predicted by Vaxign as an adhesin with an adhesin probability of .96. This prediction is consistent with current knowledge about this protein [52] . Based on an X-ray structure analysis, FimH is folded into two domains of the allbeta class connected by a short extended linker [53] . FimH was not shown in our final predicted list since its subcellular localization was predicted unknown (Probability = .2). If only a high adhesin probability is considered, FimH would be included in our prediction list. This also indicates different Vaxign options selected by a user would change the results. However, we identified another protein in that complex (FimD) ( Table 4) . Vaxign identified IroN, Hma, and ChuA (Table 4) which were selected as possible protective antigens after lengthy experimental assessment [33] . Our study found that Hma induced protection in mice from transurethral challenge with UPEC. Another independent study indicated that subcutaneous immunization with denatured IroN conferred significant protection against renal, but not bladder, urinary tract infection in a mouse model [54] .",

In many cases, subdominant epitopes that induce subdominant responses may be important components of an effective immune defence [19] . Immunization with subdominant but optimal epitopes can often induce T cell responses that are more effective than immunodominant epitopes.

The epitope ranking can also be used to rank proteins. Many programs, such as EpiAssembler by EpiVax [55] , allow epitope content ranking. It is known that the best T cell epitopes tend to contain \"clusters\" of MHC binding motifs, and the clustering is highly correlated with the immunogenicity [46] . Therefore, it is more effective to design a peptide(s) containing clustered epitopes for induction of better immunogenicity in rational vaccine development. Promiscuous epitopes are those MHC ligands or T-cell epitopes that are recognized in the context of more than one MHC molecule and recognized by more than one T-cell clone. Many software programs, such as TEPITOPE [56] , enable the computational identification of promiscuous MHC ligands.

Many pathogens, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, human coronavirus, and Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi carry antigens which cross-react with human antigens [44, 46] . For example, the oligopeptide QTDRED is common to both K. pneumoniae and HLA-B27 nitrogenase reductase enzyme. This sequence similarity appears to cause ankylosing spondyltis. Proteus mirabilis hemolysin contains a molecular mimicry sequence ESRRAL that has the same shape and charge distribution as the rheumatoid arthritis susceptibility sequence EQRRAA. Antibody levels against P. mirabilis hemolysin and a synthetic peptide ESRRAL were significantly higher in rheumatoid arthritis patients [44] . To avoid the autoimmunity, it is important to eliminate the epitopes that are conserved. Currently Vaxign provides a genome-wide sequence similarity analysis at protein levels. Many programs, such as Conservatrix [19] and IEDB Sequence Mapping tool (http://tools.immuneepitope.org/esm/esmhelp.jsp?tab= help), have been developed to map epitope sequences.
