            "text": "Canine coronavirus (CCoV) is an enveloped RNA virus, responsible for gastrointestinal infection in dogs. To date, two different CCoV genotypes have been recognized, CCoV type I and CCoV type II. Recently, CCoV type II strains of potential recombinant origin with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) were detected and characterized as a new subtype (CCoV-IIb) of canine coronavirus, in order to be differentiated from the ''classical'' CCoV type II strains (CCoV-IIa). In the present study, two CCoV-IIb strains were detected in the faeces and internal organs of two puppies, which died after presenting gastrointestinal symptoms. Mixed infection of both subtypes (CCoV-IIa/IIb) was detected in the faeces, while only CCoV-IIb was detected in the organs. Puppies were also infected by canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2). Both CCoV-IIb strains were isolated on cell cultures and subjected to sequence analysis and phylogeny. By means of RT-PCR and real time RT-PCR assays, tissue distribution and quantitation of viral loads took place. These cases represent the first description of tissue distribution and quantitation of CCoV-IIb strains, detected in the organs. The detection of CCoV-IIa strains, which is restricted to the faeces, suggests that CCoV-IIb strains may have an advantage in disseminating throughout a dog with CPV-2 coinfection, in contrast to common enteric CCoV-IIa strains.",

CCoV is the causative agent of gastroenteritis in dogs, characterized by high morbidity and low mortality. Clinical signs include anorexia, lethargy, vomiting, mild to severe diarrhoea (usually lasting 1-2 weeks) and occasionally death, mainly in puppies. The disease is more severe in young animals (Carmichael and Binn, 1981) . Systemic infections are not usual; however, during the past few years, there have been reports of fatal disease, with CCoV strains detected in the enteric tract, as well as in the organs (Buonavoglia et al., 2006; Decaro et al., 2009) .",

Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using MEGA4 program (Tamura et al., 2007) . Phylogenetic trees, based on the amino acid sequences of S, E, M and N proteins, were elaborated using neighbor-joining method, supplying a statistical support with bootstrapping over 1000 replicates. SimPlot was used for nucleotide sequence comparison of the two strains to Alphacoronavirus-1 reference strains (Lole et al., 1999) . The sequences of strains 66/09 and 68/09 were registered in GenBank under the accession numbers HQ450376 and HQ450377, respectively.",

            "text": "Moreover, our findings suggest that TGEV-like CCoV strains spreading to the internal organs are circulating in dogs, since so far, there has been only one report in Italy (Decaro et al., 2009) . By means of real time RT-PCR, tissue distribution and quantitation of both strains were assessed for the first time, revealing the spreading of the virus to the internal organs. The CPV-2 coinfection may contribute to the spreading of TGEV-like CCoV strains, since so far, they have been only detected in organs of dogs infected also with CPV-2 (Decaro et al., 2009 ). However, the detection of CCoV-IIa strains strictly in the faeces, in both cases, suggests that CCoV-IIb may have an advantage in disseminating through the dog. In the first report of TGEV-like strains detected in the organs, CCoV-I was also detected strictly in the intestinal content in two cases (Decaro et al., 2009 ). These cases strongly suggest a difference in pathobiology of CCoV-IIb with respect to CCoV-I/IIa. By sequence and phylogenetic analysis, it was shown that both strains segregate constantly with the CCoV-IIb reference strains detected in the organs of dogs. Accordingly, the strains were highly similar to TGEV in the 5 0 end of the S gene, whereas they clustered with the pantropic CCoV variant CB/05 (subtype CCoV-IIa) in the E, M and N proteins. In a previous study, CCoV-IIb strains detected in the organs were found to share higher amino acid identity with CB/05 than with CCoV common enteric strains, at the level of the same proteins (Decaro et al., 2009) . Whether the ability of CCoV-IIb strains to spread to the organs is related to the recently recognized recombinant protein S or to the CB/05-like proteins (E, M and N) needs further research. However, the S-protein ''scenario'' seems to be more possible, since in coronaviruses S protein mediates receptor attachment, and tissue tropism shift has been associated with mutations in the S gene (Masters, 2006) .",

Up to now, there has been only one report of TGEV-like strains detected in internal organs of puppies in Italy. Based on sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the structural proteins, the two Greek isolates were found to be related to the Italian prototype CCoV-IIb strains. In addition, in all cases a mixed infection with CPV-2 was reported. However, the detection of CCoV-IIa strains, strictly at the faeces, suggests that CCoV-IIb strains may have an advantage in disseminating throughout a dog with CPV-2 coinfection, in contrast to common enteric CCoV-IIa strains.",
