Some of several such occurrences in the past few decades include-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) from China to the rest of the world, Cholera and Ebola in Africa, Influenza A in Saudi Arabia, and most recently, Zika from Brazil. And now, Plague epidemic is going on in Madagascar. Many countries are in constant worries that such deadly infectious diseases might be carried from one part of the world to them (3). Although member countries signed an international agreement to report outbreaks promptly to the World Health Organization and take steps to control them, the vast majority have not fully complied with the pledge. Despite the ups and downs, the international effort to combat infectious diseases is becoming better.",
