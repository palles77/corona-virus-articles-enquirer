Over time, reproduction can enhance the information of the machine. We show that accumulation of valuable information results from degradative processes required to make room for novel entities. Degradation systems act as Maxwell's demons, using energy not to make room per se, but to prevent degradation of what has some functional features. This myopic process will accumulate information, whatever its source, in a ratchet-like manner. The consequence is that genes acquired by horizontal transfer as well as viruses will tend to perpetuate in niches where they are functional, creating recurrent conditions for emergence of diseases.",

We argue that, although human behaviour has also its share in their development [4] , this is mainly the consequence of a still poorly explored property of living organisms, their capacity to trap information. Innovation in consubstantial with life. The first step of colonisation of a niche requires access to novel information. Genome analyses show that it is inevitable that pathogens will keep emerging because living organisms are poised to recruit and even create information. Comparative genomics identified some of the genes and processes involved in this ubiquitous faculty. Bacterial genomes are organised in such a way that they are prone to acquire, invent or express genes permitting occupation of any novel niche. Our present view of information trapping is based on the generally intuitive idea that the cell (or the organism) is a material system able to handle information. Briefly, the cell behaves as a computer making computers (for a summary of the history of the conjecture and modern data stemming from the birth of synthetic biology, see [5] ). The central tenet of the cell-as-a-computer model is that the genetic program coded in the genome couples information (an authentic category of reality) with the standard categories, matter, energy, space and time [6] .",

In this context, the crucial prediction of the model is that one should be able to isolate the entity carrying the program, put it back into a recipient host, and observe that the program in its new location begins to be displaying phenomena specific of the information it carries. In addition to the many experiments showing that pieces of program can be handled by cells (namely, viruses and genes moved by horizontal transfer, via conjugation, transformation and viral infection, or genetic engineering), two families of experiments support the model. 1/Animal cloning, first perfomed with the famous ewe Dolly [15] is now commonplace; 2/Lartigue and co-workers claimed success in transplanting the genome of a Mycoplasma species M. mycoides, into another Mycoplasma species, M. capricolum, and after several rounds of reproduction (reproduction of the machine and replication of the program) the host species was replaced by a colony of the donor genome [16] . Finally, the cell-as-a-computer model is also remarkable in that it is so consistent with the way viruses behave (pieces of program meant to self-replicate) that the metaphor went from biology to computer sciences, i.e. in the way opposite to that which made the concept of program come from computer sciences to biology.",

And, as we all know, many computer programs are impossible to run when going from a platform driven by a particular OS to another one. The same should be expected in genome transplantation experiments (and indeed transplantation of cyanobacteria genomes in Firmicutes did not yield any functional result [17] ). However, the Eukarya OS is particular in that these organisms have embedded, first as symbionts and then as organelles, organisms coming from the Bacteria domain. Archaeal symbionts are extremely rare [18] . This supposes some type of interoperability between Eukarya and Bacteria, and might account for the remarkable observation that Bacteria, but not Archaea, can become pathogens of plants and animals.",

The computer model identifies two parts where this process can be traced back, the chassis/machine, and the genetic program. Describing the former in detail is difficult, as we lack much understanding about the bacterial cell's organisation (despite recent progresses which shows that contrary to expectation the bacterial cytoplasm is certainly not a tiny test tube, but is extremely well organised [19] [20] [21] ). An essential property of the chassis stems from its capacity of reproduction. Indeed, as shown of non-covalent compositional assemblies made of monomeric mutually catalytic molecules, reproduction may improve over time (this is not the case of replication) [22, 23] . Yet, despite its importance, knowledge in the domain is still fairly limited, and will not be further discussed here.

Since then, genome programs kept uncovering an evergrowing number of novel genes with unknown functions. However many of these genes were found to correlate with pathogenicity, and they were named \"pathogenicity islands\" accordingly. In contrast, a limited number of genes, orthologs of which tend to persist in many genomes, form a core set of persistent genes which are often conserved in bacterial genomes [9] . This led some to think that one could define one common universal minimal genome, made of genes deemed essential. However, analysis of gene persistence in a great many genomes showed that the class of persistent genes is much larger than the approximately 250 genes required to permit a cell to make a colony on plates supplemented with rich media [10, 11] . The persistent gene class, comprising some 500 genes, was named the paleome because it recapitulates the three phases of the origin of life: metabolism of small molecules on mineral surfaces, substitution of surfaces by an RNA-world where transfer RNA played a central role, and invention of template-mediated information transfer [8] .",

Indeed, contrary to intuition, creation of information is reversible, and this implies that creation of information does not require energy [25] . Yet, information needs to be coupled to energy consumption as soon as its accumulation is considered. Accumulation of information requires any physical system to \"make room\" by erasing the memory used during the process of creation of information, and this requires energy [25] [26] [27] . However, making room by random erasure of the intermediary steps required for the creation of information would fail to accumulate valuable information [6, 28] . It is therefore necessary that appropriate degradative systems use energy to tell from the bulk what is informative and what is not. These degradation systems would play the role of Maxwell's demons, sorting functional entities from the bulk which is prone to be degraded, by preventing degradation of all that has any functional value. We proposed as a basis for experimental validation, the conjecture that this is exactly the function of those genes of the paleome which are often found among persistent non-essential genes. An experimental setup which can select for adaptive mutations has been constructed, with the aim to identify genes responsible for accumulation of adaptive mutations [28] and preliminary results support the conjecture (Sekowska, Martens and Danchin, unpublished observations). The consequence of the existence of these genes is that living organisms are prone to trap information, whatever its source, and use it to build up an adaptive map of their environment.",

But what could be the sources of novel information? Part must come from mutations of the pre-existing genetic program, but the likeliness that it will often produce valuable information cannot be high [29, 30] . Interestingly, exactly as Maxwell's demons would behave, the active component of the accumulation process put in action \"myopic\" functions. Indeed, they can only measure whether a component susceptible to be degraded or not is somehow functional. Many features can be used to this aim, including physico-chemical properties of the amino-acids of the protein build up (such as isomerisation of aspartate and asparagine, a ubiquitous and fast ageing process in proteins), association with specific substrates or changes in the rigidity of active enzyme complexes or simply recent expression [28] . Furthermore, nothing precludes that information coming from outside, such as that resulting from horizontal gene transfer, can be retained in the accumulation process. And as a matter of fact, beside the paleome the genetic program contains another set of genes, often highly specific to a given organism and resulting from horizontal gene transfer [31] , the cenome (named after the concept of biocenose, community of organisms sharing a particular niche, proposed in 1877 by Karl M\u00f6bius).",

The analysis of the cenome of a variety of bacterial species showed us that there are unlimited number of genes in the environment, which can be sampled as a strain-specific setup in a particular strain of a given species. This fact, observed in metagenomic studies, has been recently firmly established in the case of Escherichia coli, where individual strains add to a core of 2000 genes, some 2500 genes extracted from a reservoir of much more than the 20,000 E. coli cenome genes already identified by genome sequencing [32] . Cells have a genome of a limited size and horizontal gene transfer results in a constant flux of genes, with some entering the genome while others are deleted. In the absence of a selective process it is unlikely that genes would stay for a significant period of time in a particular strain. Hence, when we look for causes of emerging diseases we need not only to identify those genes that have a role in sustaining and propagating the disease, but also for constraints which somehow identify relevant genes and trap them in the genome in a more or less stable way.",

Analysis of the single nucleotide polymorphism in the genome of the latter showed that, in addition to genes of the cenome, adaptation involves genes of the paleome, in particular genes involved in stress adaptation, maintenance and repair, i.e. genes belonging to the persistent non-essential class [37] . The conclusion of this observation is that, when analysing emerging diseases, we should not only look for the process making the organism pathogenic or virulent, but we should look for the genes making these processes perennial.

The case of viruses is somewhat different, and unfortunately more likely than bacteria to be successful in making diseases emerge. The model of the cell-as-a-computer is particularly well suited to viral infection and propagation. Indeed, exactly as with computers, viruses are pieces of genetic program that can readily be expressed in many cell types, and they often need simply to find an entry door to a new cell type to be successful. Because the cell is measuring functional entities, preventing their degradation, many emerging viruses must be variants of existing viruses, preserving essential functions. In particular, shifting from a host to a new one can happen when mutations modify the virus envelope so that it can bind to a new receptor and then is internalized in a host's cell type where it is recognised as functioning. The stepwise capture of information is well illustrated by the influenza virus as it is usually a mild parasite of Anatidae (ducks, geese and the like) which can infect humans, often after having infected pigs as an intermediate host [38] . The structure of the small farm in China, with its pond and its pig under a roof (as in the Chinese character for 'family', ) is remarkably adapted to this type of transition. It is obvious that large breeding farms, despite considerable control of hygiene, create the conditions appropriate for considerable virus infections. In the same way, we can see pox viruses (infecting buffaloes, sheep and monkeys) as possible sources of emerging pox infections in the future [39] .",
