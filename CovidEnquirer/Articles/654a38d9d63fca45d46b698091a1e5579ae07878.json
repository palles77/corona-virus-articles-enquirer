Despite of the importance of EV71, the nonstructural protein 3AB from this virus is little understood for its function during EV71 replication. Here we expressed EV71 3AB protein as recombinant protein in a eukaryotic expression system and uncovered that this protein possesses a nucleic acid helix-destabilizing and strand annealing acceleration activity in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that EV71 3AB is a nucleic acid chaperone protein. Moreover, we characterized the RNA chaperone activity of EV71 3AB, and revealed that divalent metal ions, such as Mg 2 \u00fe and Zn 2 \u00fe , were able to inhibit the RNA helixdestabilizing activity of 3AB to different extents. Moreover, we determined that 3B plus the last 7 amino acids at the C-terminal of 3A (termed 3B \u00fe 7) possess the RNA chaperone activity, and five amino acids, i.e. , are critical and probably the active sites of 3AB for its RNA chaperone activity. This report reveals that EV71 3AB displays an RNA chaperone activity, adds a new member to the growing list of virus-encoded RNA chaperones, and provides novel knowledge about the virology of EV71.",

EV71 has been recognized as one of the most important pathogens that cause emerging infectious disease; moreover, increased occurrence of EV71 epidemic activities has been reported throughout the Asia-Pacific region in recent years (Huang et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2010) . Like other enteroviruses, EV71 contains a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome, which is approximately 7.4 kb in length and consisting of a single open reading frame (ORF) flanked by 5 0 and 3 0 untranslated regions (UTRs). Enteroviral ORF encodes a long polyprotein that is subsequently cleaved at specific sites to produce separate structural and nonstructural proteins (Brown and Pallansch, 1995) . Previous studies from enteroviruses, mainly poliovirus, have shown that some of enteroviral nonstructural proteins, including 3D Pol , the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), 3CD, 3AB and 3B, as well as certain host factors are involved in viral RNA replication (Hey et al., 1987) .",

            "text": "For RNA viruses including enteroviruses, their viral RNAs (vRNAs) require proper secondary and tertiary structures to form diverse cis-acting elements within their 5 0 -UTR, 3 0 -UTR or ORF region, which play essential or critical roles in vRNA replication, translation, and encapsidation (Musier-Forsyth, 2010; Zuniga et al., 2009) . Moreover, the formation and deformation of RNA tertiary structures should be a dynamically regulated process for vRNAs to function properly in various events. However, correct folding of RNA molecules is quite challenging, because RNAs would be easily trapped in intermediate structures that are thermodynamically stable (i.e. kinetic trap) (Musier-Forsyth, 2010; Woodson, 2010) . In response to this challenge, hosts or viruses encode a variety of RNA \"helper\" or remodeling proteins, generally including ATP-dependent RNA helicases and ATP-independent RNA chaperones, which help kinetically trapped RNAs overcome thermodynamic barriers and refold to form proper RNA structures (Singleton et al., 2007) . RNA helicases contain ATPase activity, and utilize the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to unwind RNA duplexes. These proteins are thought to participate in most ATP-dependent remodeling of structured RNAs (Singleton et al., 2007) . On the other hand, RNA chaperones are a heterogeneous group of proteins that can destabilize RNA duplexes and accelerate correct RNA folding by helping misfolded RNAs escape kinetic traps (Herschlag, 1995) . For enteroviruses, although nonstructural protein 2C ATPase has long been predicted as a putative helicase based on its AAA\u00fe ATPase activity and conserved helicase motifs, the putative helicase activity associated with 2C ATPase has not been formally determined (Sweeney et al., 2010) . In contrast, previous studies of poliovirus have shown that poliovirus nonstructural protein 3AB possesses an RNA chaperone activity in vitro, which probably involves in polioviral RNA synthesis by 3D Pol (DeStefano and Titilope, 2006) . Enteroviral 3AB is a $ 12 kDa and 108 amino acids (a.a.) protein, containing N-terminal 3A ( $ 10 kDa) and C-terminal 3B/ VPg ( $ 2 kDa) domains. Protein 3AB is derived from the $84 kDa P3 precursor of enteroviral polyprotein, which also contains 3D Pol and 3C protease (3C Pro ). Finally, 3AB will be proteolytically cleaved into proteins 3A and 3B/VPg (Pallai et al., 1989) . During enteroviral RNA replication, proteins 3A, 3B/VPg as well as 3AB play critical roles in vRNA synthesis (Plotch and Palant, 1995) . Among them, protein 3A is 87 a.a. in length and has an effect on protein trafficking (Belov et al., 2005) . For all picornaviruses, the 3B/VPg is a small peptide (21-24 a.a.) that functions as a primer to initiate vRNA synthesis by 3D Pol , which is covalently linked to the 5 0 -end of all newly synthesized vRNAs (Pathak et al., 2007) . Moreover, proteins 3A and 3AB have been reported to play key roles in the formation of enteroviral replication complex.",

Following the mostly complete eradication of poliovirus and poliomyelitis in most regions around the world (Friedrich, 2000) , EV71 has emerged as the most important human neuron-tropic enterovirus (Ishimaru et al., 1980) . So far, no effective vaccine or antiviral therapy is available for EV71 (Chong et al., 2012) . Previous study has shown that mutants resistant to Enviroxime, an antiviral drug blocking polioviral RNA replication, map to the coding sequence of 3A, indicating that 3A (or 3AB) plays a critical role in vRNA replication and is an ideal target for antiviral therapy against other enteroviruses (Sadeghipour et al., 2012) . Thus, a potential anti-EV71 strategy is to develop novel antivirals targeting 3A or 3AB (Kuo and Shih, 2013; Tan et al., 2014) . However, although poliovirus 3AB has been reported to display an in vitro RNA chaperone activity, the function of EV71 3AB has been poorly studied. Due to the importance of 3AB for enteroviruses, a thorough understanding to its roles in EV71 virology would be desired for combating this emerging virus, and may serve as a basis for future studies.",

To further examine whether the helix-destabilizing activity of EV71 3AB is specific for RNA helix, we constructed two different nucleic acid helix substrates, Rn/D (Fig. 2B , left panel) via annealing a short HEX-labeled RNA (RNA1) and a long non-labeled DNA (DNA2) and Dn/D (Fig. 2C , left panel) via annealing a short HEX-labeled DNA (DNA1) and a long non-labeled DNA (DNA3) ( Table 2 ). Each helix substrate was reacted with MBP-3AB under the same conditions as in Fig. 2A . Our results revealed that EV71 3AB was able to destabilize both RNA-DNA and DNA-DNA helix substrates ( Fig. 2B and C). Moreover, we reacted DNA-DNA helix substrate with different concentrations of MBP-3AB, and the data show that 3AB can destabilize DNA-DNA helix in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2D) . The destabilizing activities of EV71 3AB to different helix The 5 0 and 3 0 UTR contain RNA sequences forming RNA structural elements.

After determining that EV71 3AB has nucleic acid helix-destabilizing activity, we sought to examine if the helix destabilization by 3AB has any directionality. Notably, although EV71 3AB can destabilize both DNA and RNA helices, we only used RNA helices in the subsequent experiments of the current work, since EV71 is an RNA virus and no DNA is involved in its life cycle. To this end, three different RNA helix substrates, containing a 3 0 23-nt single-stranded overhang, a 5 0 22-nt overhang, and blunt ends (as illustrated in Fig. 3A -C, left panels) were generated. These substrates were then reacted with MBP-3AB under our standard destabilizing condition. Our results showed that MBP-3AB was able to destabilize both 3 0 -tailed and 5 0 -tailed RNA helices, but not blunt-ended one ( Fig. 3A -C). These experiments have been independently repeated several times. Altogether, our data demonstrate that the helix-destabilizing activity of EV71 3AB has no directionality or polarity.",

We found that the RNA helixdestabilizing activity of MBP-3AB was dose dependent, as increasing the dose of 3AB gradually enhanced helix destabilization (Fig. 4A ). In addition, the RNA helix-destabilizing activity increases with the increase of reaction time (Fig. 4B ). The quantitated data obtained using different 3AB doses and reaction times can be used to calculate the rate constant. The helix-destabilizing reaction of EV71 3AB belongs to class of zero-order reactions for the RNA helix substrates, and belongs to one half-order reactions for protein 3AB.

Furthermore, we examined the requirement for Mg 2 \u00fe as well as three other divalent metal ions (Mn 2 \u00fe , Ca 2 \u00fe , and Zn 2 \u00fe ) for the helix-destabilizing activity of EV71 3AB. For helicases, Mg 2 \u00fe is usually required for their helix unwinding activities (Warrener and Collett, 1995; Yang et al., 2006) . Here we found that MBP-3AB did not require the presence of 2 mM Mg 2 \u00fe or other divalent metal ions for its helix-destabilizing activity (Fig. 5B, lanes 3-7) , and the presence of 2 mM Zn 2 \u00fe even blocked RNA helix destabilization (Fig. 5B, lane 7) . We further assessed the impacts of Mg 2 \u00fe and Zn 2 \u00fe at various concentrations on the helix-destabilizing activity of MBP-3AB. As shown in Fig. 5C , the helix-destabilizing activity of EV71 3AB was insensitive to Mg 2 \u00fe when its concentration is lower than 5 mM, while high Mg 2 \u00fe concentration (10 mM) is even moderate inhibitory. These results indicate that Mg 2 \u00fe is not required for the helix-destabilizing activity of EV71 3AB. Our results also showed that when the concentration of Zn 2 \u00fe reached 1 mM, the helix-destabilizing activity of MBP-3AB was dramatically inhibited (Fig. 5D, lanes 5-7) , while at lower (0.5 Mm) Zn 2 \u00fe concentrations, the helix-destabilizing activity of MBP-3AB was moderately inhibited (Fig. 5D, lane 4) .",

As illustrated in Fig. 6A , two 42-nt complementary RNA strands that form defined stem-loop structures were used, one of which was HEX-labeled at its 5 0 end (Fig. 6A, right) . 0.1 pmol of HEX-labeled strands and non-labeled strands were mixed in the presence and absence of 10 pmol MBP-3AB, followed by gel shift assay to measure the hybridization of the two complementary RNA strands. Our results show that in the absence of 3AB, hybridization was not observed as incubation time increased (Fig. 6B, lanes 3-6) , while the presence of 3AB dramatically enhanced the hybridization (Fig. 6B, lanes 7-10) . In addition, we observed that the annealing stimulation by EV71 3AB was in a dose-dependent manner, as increasing the dose of 3AB resulted in an increase in hybridization (Fig. 6C) , indicating that EV71 3AB is able to destabilize RNA secondary structures and enhance the formation of more stable RNA hybrids.",

To determine whether EV71 3AB has this activity, a short HEX-labeled RNA strand (49 nt) was incubated with a long non-labeled RNA strand (285 nt) (Fig. 7A) in the absence or presence of MBP-3AB. Moreover, RNA chaperone normally functions well when its amount is largely excessive over that of its substrate (Levin et al., 2005) . To examine whether this notion also applies to EV71 3AB, the two RNA strands (0.1 pmol each strand) were mixed, and then reacted with increasing amounts of MBP-3AB (0-10 pmol) for 10 min. After that, gel shift assay was performed to measure the annealing of the two partially complementary strands. Our data show that increasing the amount of MBP-3AB resulted in stronger stimulating effects on strand annealing in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7B, lanes 4-6) . Taken together, we conclude that EV71 3AB possesses an RNA chaperone activity that is able to destabilize RNA helix and stimulate RNA strand annealing.",

After that, 10 pmol of each protein was incubated with RNA helix substrates. Our results showed that neither MBP-3A nor MBP-3B was able to destabilize RNA helix (Fig. 8D, lanes 4-5) , while MBP-3B \u00fe7 effectively destabilized RNA helix. Moreover, the efficiency of MBP-3B \u00fe7 to destabilize helix is only slightly less than that of MBP-3AB (Fig. 8D , lane 3 and lane 6).",

Based on the amino acid sequence alignment analysis of 3AB proteins between EV71 and poliovirus, five residues K80, F82, F85, Y89 and R103, whose corresponding residues have been reported to be critical for the RNA chaperone activity of poliovirus 3AB (Gangaramani et al., 2010) , were selected; and then, each residue was point mutated to Alanine (A) in 3B\u00fe 7 (as indicated in Fig. 8A ). The 3B \u00fe7 mutants were eukaryotically expressed as MBP-fusion proteins and then purified (Fig.8C) . After that, helix-destabilizing assays were conducted. As shown in Fig. 8E , the K80A or Y89A mutation abolished the helix-destabilizing activity of 3B \u00fe7 (lanes 3 and 6), while R103A, F82A and F85A mutations resulted in different extents of inhibition on the helix-destabilizing activity of 3B\u00fe 7 (lanes 4, 5 and 7), indicating that these five residues are the critical sites for the RNA chaperone activity of EV71 3AB.",

For RNA viruses, their vRNA molecules may adopt diverse structures, some of which are misfolded inactive intermediates. The role of RNA chaperones is usually to facilitate the refolding of misfolded RNA intermediates, and assists in the formation of more globally stable and active RNAs. Thus, RNA chaperone activity is generally believed to be required for efficient replication and translation of vRNAs (Ivanyi-Nagy et al., 2005; Mir and Panganiban, 2006a; Z\u00fa\u00f1iga et al., 2009) . So far, the list of virus-encoded RNA chaperones keeps growing and includes retroviruses nucleocapsid (NC) protein, HIV-1 Vif and Tat, coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) protein, hantavirus nucleocapsid (N) protein, flavivirus core protein, hepatitis D virus small delta antigen (SdAg), cypovirus capsid protein VP5, EoV nonstructural protein 2C, and poliovirus 3AB (Baric et al., 1988; Batisse et al., 2012; Cheng et al., 2013; DeStefano and Titilope, 2006; Huang et al., 2003; Ivanyi-Nagy et al., 2008; Kuciak et al., 2008; Mir and Panganiban, 2006b; Rein et al., 1998; Yang et al., 2014) .

            "text": "Previous study has reported that poliovirus 3AB possesses an RNA chaperone activity; moreover, our current study determined the RNA chaperone activity of EV71 3AB. Despite of the numerous commonalities between poliovirus and EV71, the 3AB proteins from these two enteroviruses still exhibited some difference. For example, poliovirus 3AB has been reported to be much more potent than 3B \u00fe7 for RNA chaperone activities (Gangaramani et al., 2010) ; however, we observed that for EV71, the RNA chaperone activity of wild-type 3AB is only moderately stronger than that of 3B\u00fe 7 (Fig. 8D) . Moreover, poliovirus 3AB has been observed to shift single-stranded (ss) RNA in a gel mobility shift assay (DeStefano and Titilope, 2006) ; however, EV71 3AB failed to cause gel shift on ssRNA (data not shown). Interestingly, EoV 2C, a well-defined RNA chaperone, also failed to shift ssRNA (Cheng et al., 2013) . Since either EV71 3AB or EoV 2C displays RNA chaperone activity to RNA duplex or structured RNAs, it is clear that they must have direct interaction with RNA molecules. A reasonable explanation for the difficulty to observe ssRNA shift is that the binding of chaperones to RNA is too weak or transient, thus preventing the interaction to be detected by a gel shift assay.",

            "text": "RNA chaperones are a heterogeneous group of proteins that share no common consensus sequences or motifs, and the mechanism(s) by which RNA chaperones destabilize RNA helix and stimulate strand annealing is still poorly understood. Currently, two models have been proposed to explain the activities of RNA chaperones. One is the \"entropy transfer\" model in which intrinsic disordered regions of RNA chaperones can transfer their entropy or disorder to misfolded RNAs, thereby facilitating these RNAs to escape thermodynamic barriers Zuniga et al., 2009 ). The other model is that some RNA chaperones remodel RNA molecules through transient ionic interaction with negatively charged phosphodiester backbone of RNAs, thereby disrupting the stability of RNAs (Woodson, 2010) . For 3AB proteins from both poliovirus and EV71, our disorder prediction using DisProt Predictor VL3, the algorithm used to predict intrinsic disorders for certain viral RNA chaperones (Bracken et al., 2004) , indicates that these two enteroviral 3AB proteins do not contain intrinsic disorder (data not shown), similarly with EoV 2C (Cheng et al., 2013) , implying that enteroviral 3AB does not use the entropy transfer mechanism to remodel RNAs. On the other hand, the RNA helix-destabilizing activity of EV71 3AB was tested under various conditions, and our results showed that Mg 2 \u00fe resulted in moderate inhibition of the RNA helix-destabilizing activity of EV71 3AB at high concentrations (Z10 mM) (Fig. 5C ). This observation suggests that EV71 3AB is likely to remodel RNA molecules through transient ionic interaction with negatively charged RNA backbones, since divalent metallic ions like Mg 2 \u00fe may compete with RNA chaperone to stabilize RNAs.",

This blocking effect of Zn 2 \u00fe suggests that Zn 2 \u00fe inhibits the RNA destabilizing activity of EV71 3AB through a different mechanism to Mg 2 \u00fe . It is plausible that Zn 2 \u00fe directly binds EV71 3AB and regulates its RNA destabilizing activity by inducing conformational change of the protein (Pfister et al., 2000) . Moreover, EV71 3AB exhibited the highest activity at pH 6. EV71 3AB is a basic protein (pI\u00bc9.13, tested by Compute pI/Mw tool), and it is proposed that this protein needs a mildly acidic environment as its optimal reaction condition.",

Five point mutations of the 3B \u00fe7 demonstrated weakened or abolished chaperone activity. Particularly, the K80A or Y89A mutation abolished the helix-destabilizing activity of 3B \u00fe7, while R103A, F82A and F85A mutations inhibited the helix-destabilizing activity of 3B \u00fe7 by different extents (Fig. 8) . Furthermore, we also examined the annealing stimulation activity by the five point mutations (data not shown), and got similar results to the RNA helix-destabilizing activity. The results indicated that the five amino acids (Lys-80, Phe-82, Phe-85, Tyr-89, and Arg-103) are critical and probably active sites of 3AB for its RNA chaperone activity.
