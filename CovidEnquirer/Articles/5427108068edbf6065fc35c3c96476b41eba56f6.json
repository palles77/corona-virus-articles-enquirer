First, for a virus like MERS-CoV that can cause super-spreading events, it may be challenging to test the hypothesis that human-to-human Page 3 of 6 transmissibility changed over time because superspreading events can cause high variability in cluster sizes, even in the absence of change. We may therefore have limited power to demonstrate here a significant reduction in human-to-human transmission; analysis of more detailed data capturing the complex transmission dynamics observed in human clusters could prove useful (9) . Second, classification of cases as human-to-human transmitted or not Although the trend needs to be confirmed by more detailed analyses, the apparent reduction in human-to-human transmission in healthcare facilities, particularly in the KSA since 2016, and the lack of onward human-to-human transmission in recently exported cases to the United Kingdom (10) and the ROK in 2018 (11) , is likely to be at least partly explained by early suspicion and isolation of cases, immediate case management, improvements in standard infection prevention and initiating control measures and comprehensive identification, follow-up and laboratory testing of all high-risk contacts.",

Case classification by countries and investigations into the source of infection substantially improved through more systematic data collection since 2015 (1), and it is believed that human-to-human cases were more accurately Page 2 of 6 classified in recent years following the large hospital outbreaks of MERS in Jeddah and Riyadh in 2014. The large multi-hospital outbreak in Jeddah in 2014 resulted in a total of 255 cases, however, a genomic analysis suggested that this outbreak included multiple introductions from contacts with dromedary camels (7). The largest outbreak resulting from one spillover event occurred in ROK in 2015 resulting in 186 cases and 38 deaths, following the return of one individual from the Middle East (8). These analyses were conducted with anonymized case-based data reported to WHO under International Health Regulations and therefore neither informed consent nor approval from an institutional review board was required from WHO. Simulations The distribution of human-to-human-transmission cluster sizes observed in 2014-2015 was used to simulate the expected total number of cases in 2016, 2017 and 2018 (through September only), conditional on the incidence of community-acquired cases. The observed numbers were then compared with the distribution of the simulated values to obtain two-sided pvalues. Results While 739 and 768 cases were reported in 2014 and 2015, respectively, only 244, 244 and 113 cases were reported in 2016, 2017 and 2018* (Appendix Figure 2). The incidence of community-acquired cases in 2016, 2017 and through September 2018 was 177, 151 and 86, respectively (Appendix",

While WHO has regular dialogue with Ministries of Health regarding each case and cluster identified, the follow-up of investigations does not always result in identifying the source of each patient's infection. It is believed that the source of infection was more systematically investigated and reported to WHO since 2015 and that secondary cases resulting from human-to-human transmission were more accurately classified meaning that the distribution of observed cluster sizes in 2014-2015 will be biased toward smaller cluster sizes. This would have the effect of underestimating the number of cases (and deaths) averted due to reduced human-to-human transmission. Third, due to limitations on detailed information about the timing of specific interventions initiated by affected countries and hospitals, we are unable to determine which control measures have made this impact.",
