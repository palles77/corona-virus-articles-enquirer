As a result, we investigated the pattern dynamics of a spatial epidemic model with logistic growth. By using amplitude equation, we found that there were different types of stationary patterns including spotted, mixed, and stripe patterns, which mean that spatial motion of individuals can form high density of diseases. The obtained results can be extended in other related fields, such as vegetation patterns in ecosystems.",

SARS cases were found in more than 30 countries and regions around the world which threaten globally human health [1] . In February 2013, a new type of avian influenza, H7N9, appeared in Mainland China which caused more than 100 people to be infected [2] .

In these studies, the reaction-diffusion equations have been used which belong to temporal and spatial forms. The reaction term is the process of individuals changes or the interaction among species in the absence of diffusion, and the diffusion term describes the spatial movement of individuals [5, 6] .",

When parameter v is close to the critical value v T , eigenvalues of the critical mode are close to zero. When the mode deviated from the critical state changes dramatically, the change of critical state mode is very small. As a result, we only need to consider the disturbance term k located near k T . The whole dynamics of system (5) can be reduced to slow mode. The stability of system (5) depends on the amplitude equation of the active mode. Turing Pattern can be represented by three pairs of active resonant modes (k j , \u2212k j )(j = 1, 2, 3) and the angle between each of the active mode is 2\u03c0 3 with |k j | = k T .",

We set R d = 1.8, R 0 = 1.5, d 1 = 0.01, d 2 = 0.25, and v is a varied parameter. The spatial step is dx = 1 and the temporal step is dt = 0.01. The numerical simulations will stop if the solutions reach a fixed situation or their dynamical behaviors do not undergo any further changes. In the present paper, we want to know the distribution of the infectious (I), so we only need to analyze the pattern formation of I. Fig. 2 shows the evolution of the spatial pattern of infected at 0, 500, 2000, 10 000, 20 000 and 100 000 iterations with v = 0.17.
