            "text": "The evolution of new and reemerging historic virulent strains of respiratory viruses from animal reservoirs is a significant threat to human health. Inefficient human-to-human transmission of zoonotic strains may initially limit the spread of transmission, but an infection may be contracted by touching contaminated surfaces. Enveloped viruses are often susceptible to environmental stresses, but the human coronaviruses responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have recently caused increasing concern of contact transmission during outbreaks. We report here that pathogenic human coronavirus 229E remained infectious in a human lung cell culture model following at least 5 days of persistence on a range of common nonbiocidal surface materials, including polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon; PTFE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), ceramic tiles, glass, silicone rubber, and stainless steel. We have shown previously that noroviruses are destroyed on copper alloy surfaces. In this new study, human coronavirus 229E was rapidly inactivated on a range of copper alloys (within a few minutes for simulated fingertip contamination) and Cu/Zn brasses were very effective at lower copper concentration. Exposure to copper destroyed the viral genomes and irreversibly affected virus morphology, including disintegration of envelope and dispersal of surface spikes. Cu(I) and Cu(II) moieties were responsible for the inactivation, which was enhanced by reactive oxygen species generation on alloy surfaces, resulting in even faster inactivation than was seen with nonenveloped viruses on copper. Consequently, copper alloy surfaces could be employed in communal areas and at any mass gatherings to help reduce transmission of respiratory viruses from contaminated surfaces and protect the public health.",

            "text": "In 2003, a highly pathogenic coronavirus believed to have originated in bats and palm civet cats transferred to humans in Guangdong Province, China, resulting in cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Over 8,000 people were infected in 37 different countries, but mostly in Southeast Asia, with 10% mortality. Inefficient human-to-human transmission, severe restrictions on air travel, closure of many wild-animal markets, and quarantine procedures have successfully contained the outbreak so far. However, zoonotic transmission of a coronavirus from reservoirs in bats and possibly camels gave rise to severe respiratory infection in individuals in the Arabian Peninsula in 2012. The resulting Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which affects the lower respiratory tract, is clinically similar to SARS but pathologically different. A ubiquitous host cell receptor often leads to extrapulmonary disease, often in the kidneys, and viral progeny are released through apical and basolateral respiratory cell surfaces, contributing to the high (up to 40%) mortality rate (reviewed in references 6 and 7). Late uncontrolled inflammation leads to severe pathologies which are not dependent on viral load, and human-to-human spread does occur (reviewed in references 3 and 4). This, combined with a low infectious dose, suggests that transmission of very few virus particles via person-to-person or contact with contaminated surfaces may be an infection risk. Although camels and associated food products have been found to contain the virus, a recent study of individuals constantly in contact with infected herds suggested that zoonotic transmission is rare (8) but that the risk may be highest from juvenile animals. The risk of transmission is increased, however, in clinical facilities (9) and possibly in other crowded public areas, including care homes and areas of mass gatherings, such as the Hajj Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca. In a recent outbreak in South Korea, MERS has so far (July 2015) killed 36 people and infected 186 patients in hospital-associated cases associated with the first imported case arising from travel to the Middle East (10, 11) .",

The use of biocidal surfaces may help to reduce the incidence of infections spread by touching contaminated surfaces. Copper alloys have demonstrated excellent antibacterial and antifungal activity against a range of pathogens in laboratory studies (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) . Copper ion release has been found to be essential to maintaining efficacy, but the mechanism of action is variable (20, 21) .

Infection with this virus occurs in a high proportion of the population in approximately 3-year cycles, incurring considerable hidden costs in lost work hours, and in this study was also used as a surrogate for the more virulent coronaviruses responsible for SARS and MERS (rather than using animal viruses or coronaviruses that primarily infect the gastrointestinal tract). In addition, a recent study also observed that HuCoV-229E shares important characteristics with MERS-coronavirus and also has an ancestral link with bats (31) . In this study, the ability of HuCoV-229E to retain infectivity on a range of common surface materials was investigated to understand the risk of disease dissemination. The potential use of biocidal surfaces to provide constant antiviral activity against continual surface recontamination could help to limit the spread of respiratory viruses; accordingly, the efficacy of a range of copper alloys to inactivate HuCoV-229E was also determined.",

However, D-mannitol was minimally protective on copper but protected the virus for the duration of the test on brass. Increasing the concentration of D-mannitol did not prolong survival of infectivity on copper (not shown).

Enveloped respiratory viruses, although more susceptible to environmental stress than nonenveloped viruses, have been shown to persist on surfaces and contaminate more than 50% of surfaces in household and day care centers (35) . Animal coronaviruses, including transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), have been shown to retain infectivity for long periods on hard surfaces (36) and for several hours on health care gowns, gloves, and masks (37), but human coronavirus 229E (HuCoV-229E) did not persist for above a few hours on surfaces (38) . In contrast, we have observed that a relatively low titer of infectious human coronavirus 229E persisted on 5 surface materials, common to communal and domestic environments, for at least 5 days. Our virus preparation contained a high proportion of lung cell debris to mimic natural contamination in respiratory secretions, which may have protected the virus from desiccation, and a human lung cell line was used for the assay, which may have been more sensitive. The relatively low virus concentration used suggests that higher viral concentrations which can occur in sputum may persist for longer periods. During coronavirus infection, the FIG 3 Comparison between brasses and copper nickels (containing the same percentage of copper) used to inactivate human coronavirus to determine if zinc content enhances the antiviral effect. Approximately 10 3 PFU was inoculated onto alloys containing 90% copper for 0, 5, and 20 min (A) or 70% copper for 0, 30, and 60 min (B) and was then removed and assessed for infectivity as described in the text. Alloys containing 90% copper were very effective at inactivating human coronavirus (A), but variations in efficacy did not appear to be related only to the presence of zinc. The presence of copper nickel C70600 resulted in increased efficacy compared to that of copper nickel C72500; that result may be linked to surface oxide layer or copper ion release from this alloy. However, at a lower percentage of copper (B), synergy with zinc or Cu(I) release may be important because contact with cartridge brass resulted in virus inactivation that was at least 3 times faster than that seen with copper nickel C71500. viral load is highest later in the infection and large numbers of infectious virus which may also contaminate the surrounding environment can be shed as symptoms subside over long periods (4) . There is scant information on minimum infectious doses, but for many respiratory viruses, the minimum infectious dose is believed to be low, i.e., just a few virus particles. Coronavirus persistence on surfaces represents a considerable infection risk if contaminated surfaces are touched and infectious virus transferred to the mouth, nasal mucosa, or conjunctiva. Nicas and Best (39) observed that individuals in office environments touched their face an average of 15 times an hour, giving ample opportunities for infection spread. The use of antiviral surfaces in health care and community facilities could help to reduce infection spread in this way. HuCoV-229E was rapidly inactivated on copper surfaces, with the inactivation rate being roughly proportional to the percentage of copper in the alloy. Alloys containing \u03fe90% copper inactivated 10 3 PFU coronavirus in \u03fd30 min, and a surface oxidation layer or increased copper ion release on C70600 increased efficacy, which has been observed for this alloy before (27) . Brasses were more efficacious than copper nickels at a lower percentage of copper.",

This was not observed for norovirus destruction on copper, presumably because of the lack of respiratory machinery (26) . However, it appears that superoxide and hydroxyl radical generation may be important in the inactivation of coronaviruses on copper alloys but that inactivation on 100% copper surfaces is primarily due to the direct effect of copper ions. Following application of a wet droplet to a copper surface, the predominant ionic species to dissolute from the metal surface is Cu(II), but reduction to Cu(I) and the Fenton reaction with oxidative intermediates from cell debris, molecular oxygen, or viral envelope could produce the highly toxic hydroxyl radical. ROS are generated in the natural course of coronavirus infection (42) and contribute to pathogenesis and apoptosis. Fujimori et al. (43) observed inactivation of influenza A H1N1 pandemic 2009 strain by Cu(I) iodide nanoparticles which involved hydroxyl radicals and resulted in degradation of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase viral proteins. They surmised that, although there was no exogenous hydrogen peroxide to fuel the Fenton reaction (equation 3), Cu(I) reacted with molecular oxygen to generate superoxide (equation 1) and, subsequently, hydrogen peroxide (equation 2) (which could also produce hydroxyl radicals via the Haber Weiss reaction) as follows:",

Presumably, as in bacteria, a multitarget attack on enveloped viruses by copper ions and ROS may result in nonenzymatic peroxidation of the envelope (44) and damage to membrane proteins and the nucleoproteins. We have observed previously (27) that exposure to copper surfaces resulted in significant morphological changes to nonenveloped norovirus, where possible disassociation of the capsid subunits exposed the viral genome to copper inactivation. In this study, we observed rapid damage, including clumping, breakage, membrane damage, and loss of surface spikes, to the coronavirus particles following exposure to copper, and some particles appeared smaller and seemed to have lost rigidity, folding up on themselves.

We have observed that the reduction in the capsid integrity of norovirus allows access of copper ions to the genome inactivating the virus. For coronavirus, the envelope and nucleoprotein are likewise compromised, and the process occurs more rapidly than with nonenveloped norovirus, which has a resistant capsid, to allow copper ion and/or ROS to destroy the genome. Interestingly, there was a 10-min delay in inactivation of simulated wet-droplet contamination which may reflect the time taken to breach the envelope and disrupt the nucleoprotein which allows access of copper ions to the coronavirus genome. Further studies may determine if the use of synergistic cleaning agents to weaken the envelope could reduce this delay. Sagripanti et al.

However, D-mannitol gave minimum protection on copper but prolonged protection on brass surfaces. Increasing the concentration of D-mannitol did not affect the results (not shown).

            "text": "The results from this study have shown that a relatively low concentration of enveloped respiratory viruses may retain infectivity on common hard surfaces for longer than previously thought and may present a real risk of infection to anyone who contacts a contaminated surface. However, human coronavirus 229E, an important pathogenic virus but also a surrogate for MERS coronavirus, which is structurally very similar, was rapidly inactivated on copper alloys. Inactivation results from a combination of direct copper ion attack and reactive oxygen species generation. The latter is particularly important as the copper content decreases, ensuring that rapid inactivation still occurs in alloys with lower percentages of copper. Therefore, incorporation of copper alloys in communal areas could help to reduce infection spread from touching surfaces contaminated with coronaviruses. This is especially important in infectious disease where the infectious dose is low, surface contamination is high, and effective therapies are limited. The mechanism of action of copper is complex and may be enhanced by radical formation but is ultimately nonspecific, ensuring continuous kill and inactivation of a wide range of pathogenic microorganisms with completely different morphologies. Concerns about the biocide resistance, possible concomitant drug resistance, and horizontal gene transfer that have been observed with other biocides (51) can be allayed because of the destruction of viral nucleic acid observed following exposure to copper surfaces. It is not feasible to cover every surface in copper, and many materials in the built environment, including stain- of the coronavirus genome revealed a reduction in copy number from virus exposed to copper and cartridge brass surfaces in reverse transcriptase real-time PCR. There was some reduction on stainless steel but none in viral suspension (lightest gray bars), suggesting that this was due to sample drying. (B) Analysis of the entire viral genome is represented in electrophoretic separation of viral RNA extracted from virus exposed to copper (lanes 1, 4, and 7), cartridge brass (lanes 2, 5, and 8), and stainless steel (lanes 3, 6, and 9) for 0 min (lanes 1 to 3), 120 min (lanes 4 to 6), and 240 min (lanes 7 to 9). The genomic RNA from virus exposed to copper and brass degraded with increased contact time. This did not occur on stainless steel; the genomic RNA remained as fragments too large to pass through the gel. However, the total amount of intact RNA was reduced at 4 h, possibly due to drying damage as seen in panel A. Lane 10 represents untreated virus, and the unmarked lane is a Bioline marker (Hyperladder I). The same procedure was used with mock-infected cells, revealing the same pattern of RNA breakdown following application to copper surfaces (not shown).",

Given the huge costs, human and monetary, associated with the treatment and care of patients with hospital-acquired infections, preliminary studies have suggested that the initial costs could be recouped within a few months (52) . New technologies in copper coatings are being developed which may allow large-scale community areas, such as transport facilities, to be rendered antimicrobial at reduced costs.

Polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation (Bio-Vision PEG virus precipitation kit) was followed by sucrose density (25% to 55%) centrifugation at 96,000 \u03eb g for 16 h at 4\u00b0C. The virus band was resuspended in water and the virus pelleted at 77,000 \u03eb g for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was discarded, the tubes were allowed to drain, and the final pellet was resuspended in ice-cold nuclease-free deionized distilled water after incubation on ice for 30 min. The preparation was applied to copper and stainless steel as described in the Figure 6 legend and was removed by gentle pipetting. Samples were fixed, applied to TEM grids, washed with water, and stained with 5% ammonium molybdate for 10 s.",
