            "text": "Background and objective: The management of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) depends, in part, on the identification of the causative agents. The objective of this study was to determine the potential of thin-section computed tomography (CT) in differentiating bacterial and non-bacterial pneumonia. Patients and methods: Thin-section CT studies were prospectively examined in hospitalized CAP patients within 2 days of admission, followed by retrospective assessment by two pulmonary radiologists. Thinsection CT findings on the pneumonias caused by each pathogen were examined, and two types of pneumonias were compared. Using multivariate logistic regression analyses, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were produced. Results: Among 183 CAP episodes (181 patients, 125 men and 56 women, mean age \u00b1 S.D.: 61.1 \u00b1 19.7) examined by thin-section CT, the etiologies of 125 were confirmed (94 bacterial pneumonia and 31 non-bacterial pneumonia). Centrilobular nodules were specific for non-bacterial pneumonia and airspace nodules were specific for bacterial pneumonia (specificities of 89% and 94%, respectively) when located in the outer lung areas. When centrilobular nodules were the principal finding, they were specific but lacked sensitivity for non-bacterial pneumonia (specificity 98% and sensitivity 23%). To distinguish the two types of pneumonias, centrilobular nodules, airspace nodules and lobular shadows were found to be important by multivariate analyses. ROC curve analysis discriminated bacterial pneumonia from non-bacterial pneumonia among patients without underlying lung diseases, yielding an optimal point with sensitivity and specificity of 86% and 79%, respectively, but was less effective when all patients were analyzed together (70% and 84%, respectively). Conclusion: Thin-section CT examination was applied for the differentiation of bacterial and non-bacterial pneumonias. Though showing some potential, this examination at the present time would not be applicable for patients with underlying lung diseases, severe conditions of pneumonia, or immunocompromised conditions.",

            "text": "Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is one of the most common acute lung diseases detected by radiographic abnormalities. In the management of CAP, pneumonias have been categorized into two groups based on sensitivity to antibiotics: bacterial pneumonia, which responds to the beta-lactam antibiotics, and non-bacterial pneumonia, which is non-responsive. Although new macrolides and new quinolones are considered to be effective therapeutic agents for non-bacterial pneumonias as well as for most of bacterial pneumonias, the recent emergence and spread of bacteria resistant to these drugs, especially in Asia including Japan, have raised significant worldwide concern [1, 2] . Therefore, the differentiation of these two types of pneumonias is recommended in the guidelines for the management of CAP from the Japanese Respiratory Society [3] . However, even the combined study of clinical manifestations and laboratory screenings such as blood cell counts and serum chemistries have yielded no information specific to either type of pneumonia. Moreover, studies on chest radiography have also failed to elucidate any precise differences [4] .",

In recent years, investigators have focused on radiologic findings of pneumonia caused by specific pathogens such as mycoplasma and chlamydia and the characteristics of these pneumonias have been described [5, [7] [8] [9] . During the recent epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the use of chest CT in combination with clinical findings was reported to be useful in ruling out a number of differential diagnoses [10] . Thin-section CT may have advantages over conventional chest radiography in the etiologic diagnosis of CAP. However, we are not aware of any prospective study investigating the usefulness of thin-section CT as a possible modality for distinguishing the different pathogens of pneumonia. The aim of this study was to elucidate the differences in thin-section CT findings between bacterial and non-bacterial pneumonia. As a part of this study, differences between two representative forms of CAP, i.e., pneumococcal pneumonia and mycoplasmal pneumonia, were also examined [11] .",

Candidate predictors with p < 0.10 were selected and used in multivariate logistic regression analysis to construct the prediction equations for bacterial pneumonia versus non-bacterial Table 3 shows the frequency of thin-section CT findings in each etiological group. No specific findings predictive of certain organisms were found. The only difference between thin-section CT manifestations of H. influenzae pneumonia and pneumococcal pneumonia was in the detection of lobar pneumonia: zero out of 12 (0%) in the former versus 20 out of 59 (34%) in the latter. Thin-section CT findings on chlamydial pneumonia were non-specific, with relatively less frequent airspace nodules, lobular opacity, and centrilobular nodules compared to mycoplasmal pneumonia. However, in comparing bacterial and non-bacterial pneumonia, several of the findings were found to occur at significantly different frequencies. Lobular opacity, centrilobular nodules, and thickening of bronchovascular bundles were more frequent in non-bacterial pneumonia (p = 0.002, p = 0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively) (Figs. 1-3) . Prominent centrilobular nodules appeared as the main shadow more frequently in non-bacterial pneumonia cases in 7 out of 31 (23%) (p = 0.001), with a specificity of 98% (92 out of 94) (Fig. 2) . Areas of AS and areas of 'GG located around AS' were more frequently observed in bacterial pneumonia (p = 0.017 and p = 0.039, respectively) (Fig. 4 ), but these findings were non-specific. Airspace nodules in bacterial pneumonia (Fig. 5 ) and centrilobular nodules in non-bacterial pneumonia (Fig. 3 ) tended to be located in the outer areas of the lung parenchyma (p = 0.023 and p = 0.001), with high specificities of 94% (29 out of 31) and 89% (84 out of 94) despite low sensitivities of 26% (24 out of 94) and 39% (12 out of 31), respectively. Bilateral centrilobular nodules were seen more frequently in non-bacterial pneumonia (p = 0.007), with a sensitivity of 32% (10 out of 31) and specificity of 90% (85 out of 94). Interlobular septal thickening tended to be seen more often in bacterial pneumonias (p = 0.087) (Fig. 6 ). The interobserver agreements (\u00c4 statistics) for the thin-section CT findings were 0.68 for centrilobular nodules, 0.50 for airspace nodules, 0.53 for lobular opacity, 0.71 for areas of AS, and 0.64 for areas of GG. Table 4 shows three logistic regression models of the dependent variables using independent thin-section CT predictor findings: \"bacterial pneumonia\" in models 1 and 2, and \"pneumococcal pneumonia\" in model 3. Six independent variables were used to compose the models of probabilities for the presence of the dependent variables. The R 2 of the models 1-3 were 0.299, 0.395 and 0.609, respectively. Fig. 7 shows the ROC curves of the models described in Table 4 . The areas under the ROC curves for the three models in Table 4 were 0.837, 0.885 and 0.953. The optimal points on the ROC curves to discriminate between bacterial and nonbacterial pneumonias in models 1 and 2 were obtained at P of 0.15 and 0.35, with sensitivities of 70% and 86%, and false positive ratios of 16% and 21%, respectively. The optimal point to discriminate between pneumococcal pneumonia and mycoplasmal pneumonia in model 3 was obtained at a P of 0.65, with a sensitivity of 94% and a false positive ratio of 15%.",

            "text": "To our knowledge, only a few studies have evaluated the ability of thin-section CT to confirm the differentiation of pneumonia cases with established etiologies [5, 6, 8, 9] . Tanaka et al. showed that the frequencies of several thin-section CT findings differed significantly between two types of pneumonia. Moreover, the thin-section CT findings generally correlated well with pathogenesis and pathological findings [6] . In a study that covered both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients, Reittner et al. concluded that thin-section CT is of limited value in the differential diagnosis Fig. 6 . Pneumococcal pneumonia in a 29-year-old woman. A transverse thin-section CT scan (1-mm collimation) of the right lung at the level of the ventriculi of the heart shows airspace consolidations and interlobular septal thickenings (arrows) within ground-glass attenuation. Thickening of bronchial walls is also noted (arrowheads). of infective pneumonias, even though the pneumonias caused by M. pneumoniae and Pneumocystis carinii exhibited characteristic appearances in thin-section CT [5] . In previous studies, because the decisions to perform CT scans were made mostly by clinical judgment and thin-section CT studies in CAP were not performed prospectively [5, 6, 8, 9] , the problem of selection bias needs to be considered. Two types of selection bias are involved: bias in selecting the examination with which to detect the causative organisms, and bias in selecting the cases to undergo thin-section CT on the basis of already known clinical information and roentgenological findings. The present study was conducted in a prospective manner in order to minimize these biases. Moreover, this study has fulfilled a need in providing a description of thin-section CT findings on pneumonias caused by the common pathogens S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae which had not been adequately described in previous thin-section CT reports. Classical studies using experimental models [15] and pathological findings [16] can be helpful in explaining the thin-section CT findings of pneumococcal pneumonia in our study, which detected an inflammatory response with an outpouring of edematous fluid that rapidly spread into the adjacent parenchyma. 'Areas of GG around AS', a finding described in pneumococcal pneumonia by Reittner et al. [5] , was more commonly found in bacterial pneumonia than in non-bacterial pneumonia in our study. This may be due to the progression of the inflammation in bacterial pneumonias. On the other hand, the primary pathologic lesions of mycoplasma infection are known to be limited to the ciliated respiratory epithelium from the trachea to the bronchioles [15] . This propensity of mycoplasma infection to affect the airways has been shown in histopathological [17] and radiological [5, 7, 18, 19] studies. Our data on centrilobular nodules corroborated a study by Reittner et al., who observed the nodules in 96% of M. pneumoniae pneumonias and in 100% of viral pneumonias, versus only 17% of bacterial pneumonias [5] . Conceivably, centrilobular nodules are specific to non-bacterial pneumonias when seen as the prominent finding (specificity of 98%), bilaterally (90%), or predominantly in the outer lung zone (89%), inasmuch as none of these localizations showed high sensitivity (23%, 39% and 32%, respectively). Patients with H. influenzae pneumonia often have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and the saprophytic bacteria within the bronchial epithelium of these cases may trigger episodes of bronchopneumonia [16] . A pathologic pattern of airspace pneumonia similar to that in pneumococcal pneumonia can also occur [16] . The only detectable difference between pneumococcal pneumonia and H. influenzae pneumonia in our study was the appearance of lobar pneumonia (0% versus 34% frequency, respectively). Chlamydial pneumonia showed similarities and differences with mycoplasmal pneumonia in thin-section CT findings [8, 9] . The disease showed a wide range of non-specific thin-section CT findings including both airspace pneumonia and bronchopneumonia. A histological investigation in an experimental model of Chlamydial pneumonia revealed inflammatory cell infiltration within the interstitium and alveolar space, accompanied by perivascular and peribronchiolar lymphoid cell accumulations [20] .",

Further, thinsection CT examination was inapplicable to various subgroups of patients, including those with severe conditions that prevented them from holding their breath, those suffering from underlying diseases with marked distortion of the lung architecture, and those with immunocompromised conditions. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was one of the most frequent co-morbidities in hospitalized patients with CAP (16%) [11] . Many of these were not included in this study in order to avoid misinterpretation of thin-section CT findings. In patients with immunodeficiency, a wider range of microorganisms including Pneumocystis jirovecii, Aspergillus and Mycobacteria can cause pneumonia [5] . Consequently, six immunocompromised patients were excluded from the CT study. Investigation of immunocompromised patients is obviously needed to determine whether thin-section CT would be useful in differentiating causative organisms and should be analyzed separately from immunocompetent patients. Moreover, we were not able to evaluate CT findings of Legionella pneumonia because we had estimated at the outset of this study that we would have only a small number of Legionella cases that are more frequently encountered in Western countries based on previously reported studies [11, 21] . Regarding methodology, using modern picture achieving and communication systems with narrower image intervals could have enabled more accurate evaluations of the images compared to using hard-copy films. Finally, the multivariate logistic regression model employed in this study was laborious and not entirely appropriate in the daily clinical setting. Further studies in which thin-section CT findings of pneumonia are evaluated by a simpler method are clearly needed.",
