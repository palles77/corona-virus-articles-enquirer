            "text": "a b s t r a c t PRRSV is the causative agent of the most important infectious disease affecting swine herds worldwide, producing great economic losses. Commercially available vaccines are only partially effective in protection against PRRSV. Moreover, modified live vaccines may allow virus shedding, and could revert generating virulent phenotypes. Therefore, new efficient vaccines are required. Vaccines based on recombinant virus genomes (virus vectored vaccines) against PRRSV could represent a safe alternative for the generation of modified live vaccines. In this paper, current vectored vaccines to protect against PRRSV are revised, including those based on pseudorabies virus, poxvirus, adenovirus, and virus replicons. Special attention has been provided to the use of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) as vector for the expression of PRRSV antigens. This vector has the capability of expressing high levels of heterologous genes, is a potent interferon-\u2423 inducer, and presents antigens in mucosal surfaces, eliciting both secretory and systemic immunity. A TGEV derived vector (rTGEV) was generated, expressing PRRSV wild type or modified GP5 and M proteins, described as the main inducers of neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune response, respectively. Protection experiments showed that vaccinated animals developed a faster and stronger humoral immune response than the non-vaccinated ones. Partial protection in challenged animals was observed, as vaccinated pigs showed decreased lung damage when compared with the non-vaccinated ones. Nevertheless, the level of neutralizing antibodies was low, what may explain the limited protection observed. Several strategies are proposed to improve current rTGEV vectors expressing PRRSV antigens.",

            "text": "PRRSV is the causative agent of the most important infectious disease affecting the porcine herds worldwide. The immune response to PRRSV is poorly understood but, in spite of this, some vaccines are being commercialized. Commercial vaccines are mostly modified live vaccines based on attenuated European or North American PRRSV strains (i.e., Ingelvac \u00ae -PRRS from Boehringer Ingelheim, Amervac \u00ae -PRRS from Hipra, or Pyrsvac-183 from Syva labs). Nevertheless, some inactivated vaccines are also available (i.e., Progressis \u00ae from Merial, Ingelvac \u00ae -PRRS KV from Boehringer Ingelheim, or Suipravac \u00ae -PRRS from Hipra). Modified live vaccines have been preferentially used, as they can establish protective immunity, measured by viral load in blood and tissues. Nevertheless, current vaccines against PRRSV have several limitations. In general, modified live vaccines protect against challenge with homologous isolates. They could also protect against heterologous viruses (Diaz et al., 2006; Zuckermann et al., 2007) . Furthermore, live vaccines provide partial protection against clinical disease but did not prevent infection (Osorio et al., 1998) and, more importantly, they can revert to virulence (Botner et al., 1997; Nielsen et al., 2001) . As the attenuated vaccines induce an immune response resembling that induced by PRRSV natural infection, they do not induce high levels of neutralizing antibodies. Killed PRRSV vaccines, on the other hand, in general, have been less effective in prevention of both infection and disease (Ostrowski et al., 2002) .",

            "text": "The innate immune response against PRRSV is very weak, probably contributing to the delay in subsequent humoral and cellular immune responses, and also to virus persistence (Kimman et al., 2009 ). PRRSV does not induce interferon (IFN)-\u2423 production (Albina et al., 1998; Calzada-Nova et al., 2010) , a key element in host antiviral response, leading to a minimal production of inflammatory cytokines and activation and recruitment of natural killer (NK) cells (Murtaugh et al., 2002) . PRRSV-induced suppression of type I IFN production is due to the interference in the activation of IFN-\u2424 promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1), located downstream of sensor molecule RNA helicase RIG-I. The inactivation of IPS-1 avoids IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 3 activation and, consequently, type I IFN production (Luo et al., 2008) . Therefore, to design an effective vaccine against PRRSV, it would be advisable to increase the production of type I IFN. To date, different adjuvants promoting the production of IFN have been tested, in addition to the current vaccines formulations, with limited success (Charerntantanakul, 2009) .",

One possible explanation for the late detection of NAbs is the difference on technique sensitivity, as ELISA has higher sensitivity than neutralization assays. Therefore, the presence of very low titers of NAbs early in the infection cannot be completely discarded. Early non-neutralizing antibodies are mainly induced by nucleocapsid (N), M and GP5 proteins, and have been involved in antibody-dependent enhancement of PRRSV infection (Mateu and Diaz, 2008; Murtaugh et al., 2002) . NAbs are induced by GP3, GP4, GP5 and M proteins, although the ones recognizing GP5 are the most relevant for protection (Kim and Yoon, 2008; Ostrowski et al., 2002) . Two B cell epitopes were identified in GP5 protein ectodomain: an immunodominant epitope (IDE), that has been proposed to act as a decoy epitope, and an epitope critical for neutralization (ECN), that is recognized by NAbs (Ostrowski et al., 2002) . Several hypothesis have been proposed to explain the delay in NAbs induction by GP5 protein, such as the presence of the IDE, and glican-shielding of the ECN (Lopez and Osorio, 2004) . The role of NAbs in protection was demonstrated by passive transfer of these antibodies . Protection of swine against PRRSV infection correlated with the level of NAbs and it was proposed that an efficient vaccine must induce NAb titers of 1:32 to prevent PRRSV infection (Lopez et al., 2007) .",

It has been shown that the induction of IFN-\u2425 secreting cells, complementing neutralizing antibodies, provides partial protection against PRRSV (Zuckermann et al., 2007) . As interleukin (IL)-10 levels inversely correlate with IFN-\u2425 response, it has been proposed that the expression of IL-10 may be responsible for the suppression of T cell responses (Charerntantanakul et al., 2006; Kimman et al., 2009 ). M protein is the most potent inducer of T cell proliferation, followed by GP5, GP3 and GP2 (Bautista et al., 1999) , and may play a role in protection. Different vaccine adjuvants have been tested to improve T cell responses to PRRSV. Nevertheless, in addition to the adjuvants included in vaccine formulation, only IL-2 and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides enhanced protection conferred by current vaccines (Charerntantanakul, 2009 ).",

The latter ones can be subdivided in three subtypes: Treg1 (TR1) secreting IL-10, T helper 3 (Th3) secreting transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u2424, and converted Tregs (Belkaid, 2007) . It has been recently described that American type PRRSV-infected dendritic cells induced Tregs, an effect that was reverted by the addition of IFN-\u2423. The induced Treg population is a Th3 type, as it promotes TGF-\u2424 but not IL-10 expression (Silva-Campa et al., 2009) . In contrast, dendritic cells infected with EU type PRRSV viruses did not induce Treg cells, although they exhibited an unbalanced ability to stimulate T cell immune responses (Silva-Campa et al., 2010) . The impact of Treg induction on delayed immune responses after PRRSV infection remains to be established, as well as the viral proteins involved in this process.",

To solve this problem, common critical B and T cell epitopes must be identified (Mateu and Diaz, 2008) . Nevertheless, it has been reported that the ability of a vaccine to induce a strong cellular immune response may be more important for protection than the genetic similarity with the challenge strain (Diaz et al., 2006) . An additional problem is the difference in the immune responses elicited by PRRSV in animals with different host genetic background (Lewis et al., 2007) .

This problem was increased by the use of potentially hazardous methods to control the disease, such as the use of live field virus to vaccinate pigs. Vector-based vaccines could represent an advantage to stimulate both humoral and cell immune responses against PRRSV, and for the design of a marker vaccine.

Foreign gene expression levels were optimized by the study of the transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs), involved in coronavirus gene expression. Our group has generated a set of TRSs ranging from intermediate to high foreign gene expression levels (Alonso et al., 2002) , a combination of these TRSs could be used to drive the expression of two or three heterologous genes from just one infectious cDNA (i.e., dicistronic or tricistronic vectors). TGEV derived vector biosafety was improved by the generation of replicationcompetent, propagation-deficient viruses (Ortego et al., 2002) .",

PRCV is spread worldwide and induces antibodies that can also neutralize TGEV (Saif et al., 1994) . Therefore, preexisting immunity against the TGEV vector could have been a problem. Nevertheless, in vivo experiments showed that antibody titers against TGEV increased even after two re-infections of pigs with rTGEV vector (Alonso S., Sola I. and Enjuanes L., unpublished results). One of the main advantages of recombinant TGEV (rTGEV) as a vector for PRRSV is that TGEV is a potent inducer of IFN-\u2423 in a process that is mediated by the virus transmembrane (M) protein (Calzada-Nova et al., 2010; Charley and Laude, 1988 ). In addition, as mentioned above, TGEV vectors may present antigens at mucosal sites, eliciting mucosal and systemic immune responses. Therefore, rTGEV vectors will represent a novel strategy to study the induction of protection against PRRSV.",

According to the accepted topology of the GP5-M heterodimer (Fig. 1) , both GP5 and M proteins expose a short ectodomain on the virion surface, being involved in receptor recognition. GP5 ectodomain contains several glycosylation sites, depending on the viral strain. It has been described that GP5-M protein heterodimer formation is previous to GP5 glycosylation (Mardassi et al., 1996) . GP5 glycosylation sites are close to the ECN epitope, and it has been proposed that the steric hindrance caused by the glycosylation is one of the causes for the potential delay in the production of NAbs after PRRSV infection (see below).

Co-expression of M protein with GP5 reduced GP5 toxicity and probably will elicit a better T cell immune response. The protection conferred by this vector was tested in vivo. One-week-old piglets were inoculated with 1 \u00d7 10 8 pfu of the rTGEV by three routes: oral, nasal and intragastric. Nine weeks later, a challenge was perfomed with 1 \u00d7 10 7 TCID 50 of a virulent European PRRSV strain. Blood samples were collected at different times post-inoculation, and humoral immune responses were evaluated by ELISA. All animals presented a high antibody response against TGEV, therefore, the vector infected target tissues as expected. Vaccinated animals also showed a clear humoral response against PRRSV GP5 and M proteins. A fast recall of the immune response was observed after the challenge, as vaccinated animals induced higher antibody titers against PRRSV antigens and earlier than control ones. Nevertheless, the immune response elicited by this rTGEV provided very limited protection, and antibody titers decreased before challenge. The lack of protection against challenge was likely due to the relatively low levels of neutralizing antibodies produced before challenge. Nevertheless, results using rTGEV as a platform were promising, as a humoral immune response against PRRSV antigens was elicited.",

There are three or four predicted glycosylation sites in the GP5 from the North American strains of PRRSV, whereas there are only two sites in the GP5 protein from European strains (wt, Fig. 3(A) ). The relevance of the N-glycans in GP5 antigenicity is not clear. It has been proposed that the removal of the glycosylation sites could lead to the improvement of the immune response against PRRSV, due to the elimination of the steric hindrance raised by the carbohydrate on the epitope inducing NAbs (Ansari et al., 2006) . Elimination of the glycosylation sites present only in the North American strains, both in engineered and natural PRRSV mutants, led to an increase in the levels of NAbs induced by the mutant viruses (Ansari et al., 2006; Faaberg et al., 2006) . Nevertheless, it is worth noting that these sites are not present in European PRRSV strains. Although the elimination of the glycosylation site overlapping the epitope critical for neutralization (G1) (Fig. 3(A) ) often leads to non-infectious viruses (Ansari et al., 2006; Wissink et al., 2005) , natural North American strain mutants lacking this glycosylation site were found (2.1% of the sequenced GP5 proteins). Surprisingly, one of this natural mutants elicited lower neutralizing antibody response than the wild-type PRRSV strain (Faaberg et al., 2006) . This is in contrast with the data obtained with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), where deletion of the N-glycan enhanced the NAbs response (Plagemann and Moenngin, 1997) . Elimination of the most conserved N-glycosylation site (G2, Fig. 3(A) ) (only 0.2% of the sequenced North American GP5 proteins lack this motif) led to higher levels of neutralizing antibodies compared with the response elicited by the wild-type virus (Ansari , 2006) . As glycosylation of GP5 is probably also involved in virus infectivity, it is difficult to analyze the influence of N-glycans on the immunogenicity of the protein. In the rTGEV system, PRRSV GP5 and M are not involved in infectivity and, therefore, the relevance of these proteins antigenicity in protection could be analyzed in our laboratory using the rTGEV vector.",

            "text": "Several B cell epitopes have been found in GP5 protein. An immunodominant epitope is located in the endodomain and, therefore, has probably limited effect on the antigenicity of the ECN epitope, as it is not exposed in the viral surface (Dea et al., 2000; Oleksiewicz et al., 2002; Rodriguez et al., 2001) . A second immunodominant epitope (IDE) was described in the ectodomain of GP5, close to the ECN (Fig. 3(A) ) (Ostrowski et al., 2002) . It has been suggested that this immunodominant site could be responsible for the delay in the production of NAbs against PRRSV acting as a decoy epitope. Antibodies against IDE and ECN epitopes were found in the sera of PRRSV infected pigs, appearing at different times post-infection. Furthermore, an increase in the titers against ECN correlates with a decrease in the level of antibodies specific for IDE (Lopez and Osorio, 2004; Ostrowski et al., 2002) . An enhanced immunogenicity of a recombinant GP5 protein in which a synthetic sequence spacer has been introduced between IDE and ECN epitopes, to better display the neutralizing epitope has been reported. The data suggests that IDE is in fact acting as a decoy epitope (Fang et al., 2006) . rTGEV vectors were engineered expressing GP5 mutants lacking IDE, in order to clarify whether this epitope is acting as a decoy epitope, enhancing the production of PRRSV specific NAbs. This approach represents an advance over similar constructions made in a PRRSV infectious cDNA clone, as in this case the deletion of the decoy epitope prevents the recovery of the recombinant virus (Ansari et al., 2006) . Two GP5 modifications were combined within the same construct, expressing GP5 protein lacking the decoy epitope and the glycosylation site overlapping the epitope recognized by neutralizing antibodies (N46S-IDE, Fig. 3(A) ). The rTGEV virus was recovered with high titer (Fig. 3(A) ), and expressed modified GP5 and M proteins in 65% and 93% of the infected cells, respectively ( Fig. 3(B) ).",

Again, M protein expression remained constant, independently of GP5 mutant co-expressed (lower panels, Fig. 3(B) ).

We postulated that co-expression of M protein with GP5 reduces GP5 toxicity by the formation of GP5-M heterodimer. To clarify this issue, confocal microscopy analysis was performed (Fig. 4) . MA-104 or ST cells were infected with PRRSV and the rTGEVs, respectively, and double immunofluorescence staining was performed. As shown in the merge (Fig. 4, lower panels) , colocalization of GP5 and M proteins was observed both in the PRRSV and rTGEV infected cells. This result suggests that the GP5-M heterodimer is formed in both cases. The decrease in GP5 expression levels by the introduction of GP5 mutations suggested that the modifications could affect heterodimer formation. Colocalization of GP5 and M proteins was also observed when a mutant GP5 protein (i.e., GP5-N46S, or GP5-IDE-N46S) was expressed by the rTGEV vector (Fig. 4) , suggesting that a heterodimer was also formed by mutant GP5 proteins.

Formulation of a killed vaccine expressing GP5 mutants with alterations in the glycosylation pattern As a complementary approach, a killed vaccine was developed based on the rTGEV-GP5-N46S-M virus, co-expressing GP5 lacking the first glycosylation site and M proteins. ST cells were infected with this rTGEV, and the culture medium was harvested at 48 hpi. Soluble antigens were inactivated by incubation with binary ethylenimine (BEI), and a vaccine was formulated. Groups of six 1-week-old piglets were intramuscularly inoculated with the formulation to evaluate the protection conferred by this vaccine. A boost was performed 3 weeks after inoculation. Six weeks after the first inoculation, animals were challenged by intranasal inoculation with 10 7 TCID 50 of PRRSV/Olot91 strain. Blood samples were collected at different times post-inoculation to determine the levels of specific antibodies by ELISA. Vaccinated animals induced higher and faster antibody titers against PRRSV antigens than control animals (Fig. 5(A) , left panel). Neutralizing antibody titers were also higher in the vaccinated animals when compared with non-vaccinated animals (Fig. 5(A) , right panel). Viremia, gross lesions, and histopathology in the lungs of vaccinated and nonvaccinated animals were analyzed. A clear degree of protection Samples were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) specific to detect antibodies against TGEV, GP5 and M. To evaluate response against GP5, GP5 protein from PRRSV Olot91 strain was expressed and purified from insect cells and used as antigen for the ELISA. (B) Lung damage caused by PRRSV infection. The lungs from animals inoculated with empty rTGEV vector, or rTGEV expressing GP5-N46S and M proteins, were analyzed. Lung lesions observed in all the pigs, with different degree of severity, included a craneo-ventral consolidation of apical and medial lung lobes. was observed, as the lungs from vaccinated animals showed a significantly lower degree of lung damage than those from nonvaccinated ones (Fig. 5(B) , left panel). Furthermore, a reduction in viremia was also observed in vaccinated animals (Fig. 5(B) , right panel).

In contrast, M protein expression was fully stable, with at least 95% of infected cells expressing M protein for more than 10 passages in tissue culture.",

As the vector used in the immunization (rTGEV) efficiently induced the production of IFN, it is likely that either PRRSV GP5 or M proteins could contain negative signals inducing Treg. This negative regulation of the immune response elicited could also be a major cause for the delay in the development of a protective immune response against PRRSV.",

Alternatively, the generation of a library of point mutants in GP5 fragments in which the epitopes eliciting negative Treg have been eliminated may overcome what we consider the second most relevant limitation in the protection against PRRSV. These approaches are currently in progress in our laboratory.",

Best results have been obtained using modified live vaccines and virus vectored vaccines could represent an advantage to stimulate immune responses against PRRSV. The results reported to date using viral vectors are not fully satisfactory and new vectors must be explored. TGEV based vector vaccines expressing different PRRSV antigenic combinations represent a promising candidate to provide protection against two porcine viruses: PRRSV and TGEV. The use of rTGEV vectors led to promising results, similar to those obtained with other vectored vaccines. Nevertheless, as reported for other RNA viruses, data obtained indicate that heterologous protein expression stability was limited. Therefore, increase of PRRSV antigens expression stability, and removal of domains eliciting Treg, represent new avenues to improve the development of an efficient PRRSV vaccine.",

A detail of the domain containing the epitopes inducing non-neutralizing (IDE) and neutralizing (ECN) antibodies is shown. Two N-glycosylation sites, N46 (G1) and N53 (G2), are located within this domain. Three different mutants were generated, substituting Asn 46 and 53 by Ser, avoiding the glycosylation at these positions (N46S, N53S, and N46,53S",

Samples were analyzed by immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) specific to detect antibodies against GP5 (left panel). Cells expressing recombinant GP5 were used as antigens for the IPMA assay. Neutralizing antibodies titers were calculated from neutralization assays of PRRSV Olot91 strain infecting MA-104 cells (right panel). (B) Lung damage caused by PRRSV infection (left panel). The lungs from vaccinated and non-vaccinated animals were analyzed. Lung lesions observed in all the pigs, with different degree of severity, included a craneo-ventral consolidation of apical and medial lung lobes. Viremia was also analyzed (right panel) by PRRSV quantification in samples, using Q-RT-PCR. Results were expressed as PRRSV TCID50 per million of pulmonary lavages (PAM). et al.",
