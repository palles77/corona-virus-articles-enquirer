Bacterial infection accounts for a minority of the gastroenteritis cases in temperate climates, especially during the cooler months (11) . Rotaviruses and the Norwalk group of viruses are probably the most common of the gastroenteritis viruses. During their winter epidemics, rotaviruses are responsible for approximately one-half of all viral gastroenteritis occurring in hospitalized children under two years of age (8) . The Norwalk and Norwalk-like viruses are also prevalent, but they primarily infect older children, adolescents, and adults (2) . Norwalk viruses cause a debilitating but rapidly resolving gastroenteritis that rarely requires hospitalization. The diversity of other viruses implicated in gastroenteritis, primarily affecting the pediatric population, include the minirotaviruses, enteric adenoviruses, small round viruses structurally similar to parvo-or picomaviruses, astroviruses, caliciviruses, and coronoviruses (lo- 12, 14, 17) .",

They were discovered during the past decade by the electron microscopic (EM) examination of negatively stained stool samples obtained from patients with gastroenteritis (1). Since many of these viruses are still noncultivable, their nucleic acid type and their polypeptide number, size, and composition are often unknown and they are therefore unclassified (1). Because they are noncultivable, EM is the preferred method for their detection and identification in most laboratories (15) . Although EM is routinely used in Canada, England, and Australia, its potential has not been fully developed in the United States. It entails relatively rapid and simple techniques that are described below (7, 13, 15) . While the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA or EIA) and other antigen detection systems have been developed in research laboratories for some of these viruses, ELISA reagents are commercially available only for rotavirus detection (16, 20 (17) . However, with a 30-32-nm diameter, the minirotaviruses are about half the diameter of the rotaviruses. The minirotaviruses are sometimes called minireoviruses.",

There are a number of small round viruses that have a rather nondescript morphology. One of the first to be described was the Norwalk agent, isolated from an outbreak of gastroenteritis in Norwalk, Ohio (2). This agent is a small round 27-rim virus with no distinctive morphology. Similar viruses have been isolated from epidemics in the United States, England, and Australia and are called Norwalk-like. Some of these were found to be antigenically related to the Norwalk agent and others are not (1, 6) . Other small round viruses in the 22-30-nm range have been described as parvovirus-like or picornavirus-like, since their capsid symmetry and size resemble the small DNA-containing parvoviruses or the small RNA-containing picornaviruses (10, 17) .

This is usually not done if a specific pathogen is not detected and reported. Second, much less is known about the relative importance and incidence, both epidemic and endemic, of many of the gastroenteritis viruses when compared to the rotaviruses. More long-term, prospective, epidemiologic studies, carded out in various locales, need to be done to determine the relative importance of these other viruses in the epidemiology of gastroenteritis. These studies will be necessary before vaccines or other preventative measures can be developed to control these viruses. Human rotaviruses and enteric adenoviruses can now be propagated in cell cultures. This advancement has paved the way for the production of future rotavirus, and possibly adenovirus vaccines, which will prevent a substantial percentage of viral gastroenteritis in the future. (4) . This can be calculated from the outcome of clinical trials of the test and the information is usually provided in package inserts or other literature available from manufacturers. The determination of this value can be difficult; it is not always easy to determine with confidence the total number of patients with the disease, because not all cases may be detectable by the conventional techniques used for reference purposes. It is difficult to obtain a significantly large number of clinical samples to reliably calculate sensitivity. Clinical samples may be obtained in larger numbers in some geographical areas (for example, the \"meningitis belt\" of Africa) but data generated in this way should be interpreted with caution since the absence of or delay in the institution of chemotherapy in these areas may result in larger quantities of bacterial polysaccharides in the body fluids. Different manufacturers of similar kits may have used different reference methods to calculate sensitivity. In any given case different samples were used and unless very large numbers were tested, comparisons could be inaccurate.",

More sense could be made of the data if the antigenicity of a polysaccharide correlated directly with its concentration, but this is not the case (2) .
