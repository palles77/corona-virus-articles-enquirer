The objectives of the study were to describe the epidemiology of morbidty and mortality in dairy calves from birth to 16 weeks of age (with an emphasis on respiratory disease), to examine individual calf and herd management practices as risk factors for calf morbidity and mortality, and to validate producer diagnosis of mortality. Incidence rates for all morbidity, enteritis, and pneumonia were 0.20, 0.15, and 0.10 cases per 100 calf-days at risk for the period of the study. Risk of enteritis was highest in the first 3 weeks of life, with pneumonia risk highest at 10 weeks of age. Case fatality rates averaged 11.8%, 17.9%, and 9.4% for all diagnoses, enteritis, and pneumonia, respectively. Average daily rates of gain from birth to 16 weeks Iof age differed between farms that had inadequate calf housing (0.8 kg day-') versus those with adequate calf housing (1.0 kg day-i). Approximately half of the calves in the cohort (418) had blood samples taken monthly from birth until 16 weeks of age. Of the calves sampled, only 19 c,alves showed a four-fold rise in serum titers to respiratory viruses. Sixteen calves seroconverted to BVDV, two calves to IBRV, and one calf to PI3 virus. Of 98 calves less than 10 days of age tested for adequacy of passive transfer, 35 (35.7%) had serum immunoglobulin levels of less than 800 mg dl-'. There were no significant differences in mortality or morbidity between calves that had adequate passive transfer and those that did not. The incidence of mortality was 0.08 deaths per 100 calf-days at risk; 64 calves died during the 16 months of the study. The risk of death was highest at 2 weeks of age. Enteritis was the most common cause of death (28 deaths, 44% of all deaths) followed by pneumonia (19 deaths, 30% of all deaths). Comparing producer diagnosis of mortality with necropsy results yielded sensitivities of 58.3% and 56% and specifici-* Corresponding author at: Minnesota Veterinary Hospital, 4545 Hodgson Road, Saint Paul, MN 55126, USA.

The pathogenesis of pneumonia involves the infection of calves shortly after birth by pathogens which are endemic residents in the calf population. The main route of infection is direct transmission via nasal secretions or droplets. This makes adequate ventilation of the calf s environment an important consideration (Roe, 1982) . The pneumonic process may range from subclinical or chronic to fulminating acute (Kiorpes et al., 1988) .

Finding consistency between herd level and individual animal risk factors strengthens hypotheses of causality. To date, only two prospective studies examining risk factors for morbidity and mortality in dairy calves from birth to weaning at the individual calf and herd levels have been published. The studies conducted in Ontario (Waltner-Toews et al., 1986a ,Waltner-Toews et al., 1986b ,Waltner-Toews et al., 1986c ,Waltner-Toews et al., 1986d and New York (Curtis et al., 1988a relied on questionnaires and data collection by the farmers. In both studies, producer diagnosis and treatment were used to estimate morbidity. These studies were biased towards identifying risk factors contributing to scours rather than pneumonia. For example. calf housing groups were divided into the categories of individual pen, group pen, and hutch in one study and loose pen, tie stall, group pen, and hutch in the other. These divisions are unsuitable for determining housing as a risk factor for calf pneumonia, because they ignore ventilation and stocking density considerations. Neither study employed laboratory sampling (e.g. serology, microbiology, or postmortem) to help address issues of causality.",

Rice county DHIA herds had an average size of 52 cows, and a rolling herd average of 7507 kg, while Dakota county DHIA herds had an average of 61 cows and a rolling herd average of 7698 kg. Use of a random sample ensured that producers with a variety of management abilities were included. The randomization mechanism involved numbering the herds on the list of DHIA members in Rice and Dakota counties that had more that 40 cows. A random number list was generated using a computer program and herds were contacted in order, using the random number list. Additional producer selection criteria included regular use of veterinary services, herd size of greater than 40 cows, milk sales revenue comprising a major component of total farm income, and the producers must raise their own replacement heifer calves.",

Predetermined standards were used to assess the adequacy of calf housing, based on the type of housing, location, division of age groups, ventilation adequacy, manure handling effectiveness, and stocking density. Two different prepared check-off forms were distributed to producers for recording individual calf data from birth to 16 weeks of age for all heifer calves born on the farm for the duration of the study (copies of these forms are available on request). The 'birth sheet' was completed by producers at the time of birth of a heifer calf. It contained information about the sire and dam, as well as events surrounding the calf s birth (e.g. time of delivery, ease of delivery, treatments given at birth). The 'treatment sheet' was used to record all diagnoses and treatments given by producers. Any occurrence of illness was recorded for each calf. All calves in the study were individually identified using ear tags. Individual calf sheets were collected monthly and data stored on a computer herd management program (DairyCHAMP@ ; DairyCHAMP@, University of Minnesota College of Veterinary Medicine, 385 AnSci/Vet Med, 1988 Fitch Avenue, St. Paul, MN 55108, USA). Monthly herd visits were conducted to collect calf sheets and serologic samples for respiratory pathogens, using the standard serologic tests of the Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory for infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, bovine virus diarrhea virus, parainfluenza virus 3, and bovine respiratory syncytial virus. Every other heifer calf that was born on each farm during the study was sampled monthly from birth until 16 weeks of age. These calves also received a brief physical examination and were weight taped at each monthly visit. In addition, physical examinations were performed on any calf that the producer identified as 'sick', in order to facilitate assessment of morbidity. Also, any calves that were less than 1 week of age at the time of the visit were sampled for serum immunoglobulin levels in order to assess the effectiveness of colostrum feeding on each farm, using the sodium sulfite turbidity test (Bova-STM, Veterinary Medical Research and Development, Inc., PO Box 502, Pullman, WA 99163, USA).",

Effects of seasonality were assessed by dividing calves into winter (1 November-30 April) and summer groups, based on date of birth. All statistical tests were two-tailed and used an alpha of 0.05. A chi-square test examined the differences between morbidity and mortality between the two seasonal groups. A weighted least squares regression was used to examine the relationship between farm level rate of gain and morbidity and mortality. Chi-square tests were used to compare the farm level rates of gain between those farms with adequate calf housing and those that had inadequate housing. Age of occurrence for morbidity and mortality were also calculated. A simple-linear regression model was used to examine the relationship between immunoglobulin status and rate of gain. The relationship between producer diagnosis of mortality and necropsy diagnosis was explaineNd in terms of sensitivity and specificity, using necropsy as the gold standard.

One farm was lost during the study. We believe that quality of data was excellent on all farms. Bull calves were I sold before 2 weeks of age on all farms. The primary calf caretaker was the farmer or a member of the farmer's family on 29 of the farms. Vaccinating pregnant cows against Escherichia coli and rotavirus/coronavirus was used by only 17% of the farms in the study. Maternity pens were used on 16 farms (53% of all farms), although only four of those farms located the maternity pens separate from the milking herd. Straw was the most common bedding used in the maternity area (73%), and the area was cleaned after every calf on only 27% of the farms. Colostrum was hand-fed on all farms, while 16 of the farms would allow calves to suckle colostrum from the cow. These findings are similar to previous published research (Wahner-Toews et al., 1986a) . The ,adequacy of calf housing was also visually assessed using the previously described standards (Table 5) . A farm was considered 'adequate' if it passed all listed criteria.

Individual stalls were used by 60% of the producers in this study in the winter and 43% in the summer, compared with 12% (Curtis et al., 1988,) and 50% (Waltner-Toews et al., 1986a) of producers in other studies.

Because the focus of this study was on enzootic calf pneumonia, assessment of calf housing with emphasis on ventilation was critical in determining adequacy of calf housing. Many housing schemes are adequate from the standpoint of enteritis prevention, but fail with regards to prevention of respiratory disease. The most common reasons that preweaning calf housing was considered inadequate in this study were that calves were housed in close proximity to adult animals, intake and exhaust areas in mechanically ventilated housing were often sealed in the winter, and hutch location was improper. Weaned calf housing was most often inadequate because of inappropriate stocking density and proximity to older cattle.",

The treatments used by producers in this study were similar to those reported in other studies (Waltner-Toews et al., 1986a; Curtis et al., 1988a ). The differences in farm level rates of gain from birth to weaning were interesting. Nutrition was fairly constant between farms, and there was no correlation between lower rates of gain and higher morbidity rates. One possible reason for the decreased rates of gain on farms with inadequate housing was subclinical enzootic pneumonia. Subclinical pneumonia is not recognized by most producers because clinical signs are transient or unapparent. Fever and increased resting respiratory rate are the most sensitive indicators of subclinical pneumonia. Producers rarely take a calf s rectal temperature unless it is anorectic or depressed. In this study however, the association between housing and poor weight gains is confounded by rolling herd milk production average, which may be a surrogate for managerial ability. Perhaps a larger cohort or more intense observation of calves in various housing schemes (e.g. daily rectal temperatures) would increase detection of enzootic pneumonia.",

Detection of seroconversion may have been blocked by passive immunity, but this immunity should have been absent by 2-3 months of age; calves in this study were sampled until 4 months of age. Also, approximately one third of the calves in this study had failure of passive transfer, and therefore should have seroconvetted if exposed to a viral challenge during the sampling period. If this is true, then other initiators (e.g. stress, poor air quality) are decreasing the effectiveness of the calf's respiratory defense mechanisms and predisposing calves to invasion by bacterial agents. This indicates that quality of housing and specifically ventilation are important with regards to prevention of respiratory disease in the dairy calf.",

In the recent National Dairy Heifer Evaluation Project, 41% of the 2177 calves tested had serum immunoglobulin levels of less than 1000 mg dl-i. Failure of passive transfer in our study was not a risk factor for mortality, but a larger or more representative sample of calves should be sampled before definitive conclusions can be drawn. :ln our study, a convenience sample was used for the passive transfer portion of the study.
