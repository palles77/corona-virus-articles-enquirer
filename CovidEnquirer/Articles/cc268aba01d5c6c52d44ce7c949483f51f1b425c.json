These sera were scored as negative (titer < 5). This was based on a preliminary criterion, considering a given test serum as negative if it produced an absorbence of > 50% of the maximum absorbence. For all further tests, the reading criterion was derived from the above results with PRCV antisera taken as negative control sera. Their mean absorbence minus three standard deviations, i.e. 0.14 or 45% of the maximum absorbence, was considered the minimal absorbence which would be obtained with TGEV-antibody negative sera. Test sera producing an absorbence below that value were scored positive for TGEV antibodies, as mentioned in Materials and methods.",

It also implies that in all field strains of PRCV involved in these cases, the E2 protein epitope of TGEV defined by MAb 1 DB12, is absent or modified. On the contrary, the results obtained with antisera to the Miller strain and to field strains of TGEV on 14 farms demonstrate that MAb 1 DB12 defines an epitope, which is conserved by these TGEV strains. The absence or presence of blocking antibodies therefore appears to be a reliable criterion to identify antisera to PRCV or to TGEV, respectively.",

Such strains would give rise to false-negative results in the present competitive inhibition ELISA using the single MAb 1DB12 as the indicator antibody. Therefore, we are currently identifying other MAbs which recognize epitopes which are absent in PRCV strains and present in TGEV strains. The use of a pool of these MAbs in the ELISA will reduce the possibility of scoring false-negative results, as the chance that a particular TGEV field strain would have lost more than one epitope is likely to be very small.",

These results correlate with the results of the VN test only in the group of TGEV-infected pigs without antibodies to PRCV. There is no correlation in the other groups. At the time of inoculation with TGEV, pigs with antibodies to PRCV were positive by VN and negative by ELISA. Following inoculation with TGEV, pigs with actively formed PRCV antibodies showed a secondary VN antibody response as indicated by the rapid formation of high VN antibody titers. Pigs with passively obtained PRCV antibodies and infected with TGEV generally showed a VN antibody titer drop in paired sera. The results obtained with pigs from farms with a natural TGE outbreak are similar. The convalescent sera from 42 of 49 fattening pigs and sows with a diagnosed natural TGEV infection and collected in 1977 contained blocking antibodies. The titers of these antibodies were similar to the VN antibody titers, confirming that these pigs had been infected with TGEV only. Furthermore, the acute sera from 18 sows and 14 piglets on farms with a natural TGE outbreak were positive by VN, but negative by ELISA. This confirms that they had antibodies against PRCV at the onset of the TGE outbreak. The convalescent sera of 15 sows had an increased VN titer indicating that their PRCV antibodies had been actively formed; titer rises varied largely between individual animals, the reason for which is unknown at present. In 13 of the latter 15 sows seroconversion was demonstrated by ELISA. The VN titers of the convalescent sera from the 14 piglets were decreased, indicating that the PRCV antibodies in the acute sera from these animals had been passively obtained. By ELISA, 13 piglets showed seroconversion to TGEV. These results show that following a PRCV infection pigs develop antibodies which cross-neutralize TGEV, as previously reported (Hooyberghs et al., 1988; Callebaut et al., 1988) . Current work is in progress to determine the significance of these antibodies for protection against diarrhea upon challenge with TGEV.",

A further indication is that antibody titers in 42 of 49 TGEV antisera were of the same order of magnitude in VN and in ELISA. The ratio between VN and blocking titers, however, varied largely between individual sera. This may explain the false-negative results in ELISA with seven of the 49 TGEV sera which reacted weakly positive in VN. In five sows and one piglet with PRCV antibodies on farms where a natural TGE outbreak occurred, no blocking antibody response could be detected, yet two sows showed a VN titer rise in their paired sera, whereas the convalescent serum of the piglet had a low VN titer. Further work will be needed to find out if this is due to a lack of sensitivity of the blocking ELISA.",

It will also enable estimation of the efficacy of vaccination experiments for eliciting a TGEV-specific antibody response in PRCV antibody-positive pigs. False-positive results were not obtained in the present study and false-negative results were rare. Positive results can be accepted with confidence; a negative result, however, must be confirmed using several serum samples from the same farm.",
