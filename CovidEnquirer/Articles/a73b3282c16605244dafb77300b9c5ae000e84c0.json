The trimeric spike transmembrane glycoprotein S mediates entry into host cells and is the major target of neutralizing antibodies. To understand the humoral immune response elicited upon natural infections with coronaviruses, we structurally characterized the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S glycoproteins in complex with neutralizing antibodies isolated from human survivors. Although the two antibodies studied blocked attachment to the host cell receptor, only the anti-SARS-CoV S antibody triggered fusogenic conformational changes via receptor functional mimicry. These results provide a structural framework for understanding coronavirus neutralization by human antibodies and shed light on activation of coronavirus membrane fusion, which takes place through a receptor-driven ratcheting mechanism.",

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in 2002 in the Guangdong province of China and spread across the globe, resulting in 8,000 infections and nearly 800 deaths in 37 countries. The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in the Arabian peninsula in 2012 and has caused numerous outbreaks in humans, with a fatality rate of 35%. SARS-CoV is of bat origin and crossed the species barrier using palm civets as putative intermediate hosts (Ge et al., 2013; Li et al., 2005b; Wang et al., 2005) , whereas MERS-CoV is found in dromedary camels as a natural reservoir (Haagmans et al., 2014; Memish et al., 2013) . Surveillance studies in bats detected numerous coronaviruses sharing high nucleotide sequence similarity with pathogenic human coronaviruses (Hu et al., 2017; Menachery et al., 2015 Menachery et al., , 2016 , suggesting that additional zoonotic transmission events are likely to occur in the future. Currently, no specific treatments or vaccines are available against any of the six human-infecting coronaviruses.",

Priming involves S cleavage by host proteases at the boundary between the S 1 and S 2 subunits (S 1 /S 2 ), in a subset of coronaviruses, and at a conserved site upstream of the fusion peptide (S 2 ') in all known coronaviruses (Belouzard et al., 2009; Burkard et al., 2014; Millet and Whittaker, 2014; Park et al., 2016) . The latter site is believed to be the most important for membrane fusion activation. The SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S receptor-binding domain, designated domain B, exhibits multiple conformational states that modulate the accessibility of the receptor-binding motifs (RBMs) and in turn the ability to interact with host cells. Based on these findings, it was hypothesized that receptor binding may initiate membrane fusion (Gui et al., 2017; Pallesen et al., 2017; Yuan et al., 2017) . However, the S glycoprotein of other coronaviruses adopt a closed domain B conformation, incompatible with receptor engagement, indicating that structural rearrangements prior to receptor binding are required for entry (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016; Shang et al., 2017 Shang et al., , 2018 Walls et al., 2016a Walls et al., , 2016b Xiong et al., 2017) . Due to this unusual mechanism of proteolytic activation and RBM conformational masking, our understanding of coronavirus membrane fusion activation remains limited.",

We previously showed that coronavirus S glycoproteins are decorated with an extensive glycan shield comprising up to 100 N-linked oligosaccharides (Walls et al., 2016b; Xiong et al., 2017) . Molecular-level information of the carbohydrates attached to the surface of highly pathogenic coronaviruses, however, is lacking. These glycans contribute to S stability during biogenesis, since inhibition of glycosylation by tunicamycin was reported to yield virions lacking S glycoproteins (Rossen et al., 1998) and likely participate in immune evasion via epitope masking (Du et al., 2016; Walls et al., 2016b; Xiong et al., 2017) . Studies of the S glycoproteins of MERS-CoV and the bat-specific HKU4 coronavirus suggested that glycans also impact zoonosis by modulating cleavage-site accessibility to proteases for membrane-fusion activation (Yang et al., 2015) . The outcome of the arms race between viral evolution mechanisms and the immune system of infected individuals can also lead to the elicitation of antibodies binding glycan-containing epitopes, such as in the case of HIV-1 (Scharf et al., 2015; Stewart-Jones et al., 2016) or Epstein-Barr virus (Snijder et al., 2018) . These findings emphasize the necessity to obtain a detailed understanding of the carbohydrates covering coronavirus S glycoproteins to accelerate the development of subunit vaccines and therapeutics.",

Although both antibodies block receptor interaction, the anti-SARS-CoV antibody acts by functionally mimicking receptor attachment and promoting S fusogenic conformational rearrangements through a ratcheting mechanism.

We used the stabilized MERS-CoV S 2P and SARS-CoV S 2P ectodomains, which harbor a double proline substitution between the central helix and the heptad-repeat 1 motif to enhance the stability of the prefusion conformation (Pallesen et al., 2017) . We determined that oligosaccharides account for a molecular weight of 121 kDa and 98 kDa for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV S, respectively (Figures S1A and S1B), using multi-angle light scattering, refractometry, and UV spectrophotometry (Veesler et al., 2009) . These results suggest that $25% of the molecular weight of a S ectodomain corresponds to oligosaccharides, whereas 50% of the HIV-1 mosaic M Env molecular weight is accounted for by glycans (Nkolola et al., 2014) . We detected N-linked glycosylations at 22 and 16 unique sites for the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV S protomers, respectively, using liquid chromatography coupled with electron transfer/high-energy collision dissociation tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (Frese et al., 2013) . The data revealed an extraordinary heterogeneity of carbohydrates decorating the two S trimers (Figures 1A and 1B and Tables S1  and S2 ). Individual sequons were linked to 21 unique glycans on average and up to 64 distinct oligosaccharides for the most heterogeneous sites. The intact glycopeptides were a variety of oligomannose, hybrid, and complex glycans, with or without sialylation and (core) fucosylation. Most of the observed diversity corresponded to hybrid/complex carbohydrates ( Figures 1A, 1B , S1C, and S1D and Tables S1 and S2). The detection of glycans with different extent of processing on coronavirus S glycoproteins is reminiscent of the composite nature of the HIV Env (Struwe et al., 2018) or Lassa virus GP glycan shields. The large number and combinatorial diversity of N-linked glycans covering the surface of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV S could represent a challenge to overcome for antigen recognition.",

To address this question, we used LC-MS/MS to characterize in parallel S oligosaccharides on the MERS-CoV England1 and Erasmus Medical Center (EMC)/2012 isolates produced using African green monkey VeroE6 cells, as well as on the purified MERS-CoV S 2P ectodomain trimer recombinantly produced using HEK293F cells. We observed extensive overlap of the types of glycans detected across virion-derived and ectodomain-derived MERS-CoV samples, including the presence of hybrid and complex glycans (Figures S2A and S2B and Tables  S1, S2 , and S3). Our data agree with previous work detecting hybrid/complex glycans N-linked to S present in the membrane of authentic SARS-CoV virions (Krokhin et al., 2003; Ritchie et al., 2010) , which is consistent with our analysis of the SARS-CoV S 2P ectodomain trimer. Our data indicate that at least a fraction of the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV virions produced in a cell are exposed to the glycan-processing enzymes residing in the Golgi apparatus during assembly and budding.",

            "text": "The asymmetric cryoEM reconstructions of MERS-CoV S and SARS-CoV S in complex with human antibodies presented in the following sections respectively resolve glycan densities at 17 and 19 sites, virtually all of them overlapping with the MS/MS data ( Figures 1C and 1D ). At least the two core N-acetyl glucosamine moieties are resolved for the majority of glycosylation sites, which extend from the surface of both the S 1 and S 2 subunits. Although both glycoproteins are densely decorated with N-linked glycans, by comparison, the surface of the HIV Env trimer is obstructed by twice as many glycans per accessible surface area. MERS-CoV S and SARS-CoV S trimers share that the regions surrounding the S 1 /S 2 cleavage site and the fusion peptide (near the S 2 cleavage site) are more sparsely glycosylated than the rest of each trimer ( Figures 1C and 1D ). These glycan holes could be important for providing access to activating host proteases and for allowing membrane fusion to take place unimpeded at the onset of infection Yang et al., 2015) . We suggest that the identified glycan holes could be exploited for epitope-focused immunogen design or therapeutic intervention against coronaviruses. This is supported by the presence of neutralizing antibodies targeting the fusion peptide region in SARS-CoV survivor sera (Zhang et al., 2004) , the high sequence conservation of this region among coronavirus S glycoproteins (Walls et al., 2016a) , and the identification of a neutralization epitope within a comparable breach of the HIV-1 Env glycan shield (McCoy et al., 2016) . Figures 3A and 3B ), which also mediates binding to human dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4), the MERS-CoV receptor (Raj et al., 2013) . The binding interface of LCA60 and MERS-CoV S involves protein/protein and protein/glycan contacts. The 17-residue long CDRH3 contacts the b8 strand and the preceding loop within the RBM. Specifically, residue W108 LCA60 inserts between the B domain residues P531 MERS-CoV and Y541 MERS-CoV on one side and the glycan N-linked to the A domain residue N166 MERS-CoV from a neighboring protomer on the other side ( Figures 3C and S4 ). CDRH2 also contacts the loop preceding strand b8 via electrostatic interactions. CDRL3 contacts the MERS-CoV strands b6 and b9 and the loop preceding strand b8, whereas CDRL1 interacts with the loops preceding strands b6 and b8 ( Figures 3A-3C ). Domain A glycans at positions N166 MERS-CoV and N236 MERS-CoV appear to contact the Fab bound to the B domain of a neighboring protomer ( Figures 3A-3D and S4). The glycan N-linked to N487 MERS-CoV of one protomer extends toward the Fab CDRH2 bound to the closed B domain of the neighboring protomer ( Figure 3D ) but is much less well resolved or unresolved in the other two protomers due to the absence of contact with neighboring LCA60 Fabs. The multiple contacts observed between LCA60 and oligosaccharides on the surface of the protein illustrates that the antibody accommodates MERS-CoV S glycan for binding and neutralization. Since the residues participating to the epitope and the glycosylation sequons at positions N166, N236, and N487 are conserved in >99.5% of MERS-CoV isolates, LCA60 is predicted to broadly neutralize most MERS-CoV viruses sequenced to date, although the chemical composition and occupancy of each glycan could modulate binding. LCA60 therefore shares similarities with several HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies, which interact to varying degree with carbohydrates N-linked to the Env glycoprotein (Scharf et al., 2015; Stewart-Jones et al., 2016) .",

It also suggests that the K493E MERS-CoV substitution could alter the positioning of the b5-b6 loop, which might in turn prevent CDRL1 from approaching the B domain, thereby providing a potential explanation for the observed loss of binding (Corti et al., 2015) . The T489A MERS-CoV substitution would remove the glycan that extends toward the Fab CDRH2 bound to the closed B domain of the neighboring protomer ( Figure 3D ). The observed abrogation of LCA60 binding for the T489A MERS-CoV mutant (Corti et al., 2015) might be explained by a loss of these protein/glycan contacts, although only one out of the three bound Fabs interact with the glycan at position N487 MERS-CoV .",

This observation supports the finding that LCA60 and DPP4 compete for binding to MERS-CoV S (Corti et al., 2015) .

Cryo-EM characterization of the stabilized SARS-CoV S 2P glycoprotein in complex with the S230 Fab revealed that the particle images could be divided into SARS-CoV S/S230 complex with (state 1) or without (state 2) one closed B domain (Figures 4A-4D and S3F-S3J and Table  S4 ). 3D classification of the cryo-EM data revealed that the state 1 complex features multiple orientations of each of the two S230 Fabs associated with intermediate and open conformations of the B domains. In the SARS-CoV S/S230 state 2 complex structure, the three B domains are open, albeit with conformations deviating from 3-fold symmetry, with the three bound Fabs protruding away from the S trimer apex ( Figures 4C and 4D ). We obtained asymmetric reconstructions at 4.2 \u00c5 and 4.5 \u00c5 resolution of the SARS-CoV S/S230 complex in states 1 and 2, respectively (Figures 4A-4D and S3H-S3J and Table S4 ). The large conformational heterogeneity of the SARS-CoV S/S230 complex contrasts with the limited number of structural states detected for the MERS-CoV S/LCA60 complex. The marked mobility of the B domain/S230 regions, which adopt a continuum of conformations in both structures, limited the resolution of this part of the map. We therefore determined a crystal structure of the isolated S230 Fab at 1.5 \u00c5 resolution to assist interpretation of the data (Table S5) .",

The S230 epitope is centered around L443 SARS-CoV and places the CDRH2 residue F59 S230 and the CDRH3 residues Y106 S230 , F107 S230 , and Y110 S230 near Y408 SARS-CoV , Y442 SARS-CoV , F460 SARS-CoV , and Y475 SARS-CoV . The fitting is therefore consistent with the identification of the L443R SARS-CoV substitution as the only escape mutant isolated thus far using the SARS-CoV Urbani strain (Rockx et al., 2008) , since introduction of a charged residue would affect binding to this epitope. Comparison of the SARS-CoV S/S230 structure with the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV B domain in complex with ACE2 (Li et al., 2005a) shows that the two proteins would clash upon binding to SARS-CoV S and that the Fab and receptor epitopes partially overlap ( Figures 5C and 5D ). This observation supports our previous results, suggesting that S230 and ACE2 compete to bind to SARS-CoV S (Rockx et al., 2008) . In contrast to LCA60, which could recognize all possible arrangements of the B domain, S230 only interacts with intermediate and open states, ",

Incubation of the wild-type SARS-CoV S ectodomain trimer (i.e., without stabilizing mutations) with 1.6 mg/mL trypsin (w/v) to recapitulate proteolytic priming led to cleavage at the S 1 /S 2 boundary (Belouzard et al., 2009) , as observed by SDS-PAGE ( Figure S5A ). Analysis of the negatively stained sample showed that the SARS-CoV S trimers largely remained in the prefusion conformation and were stable for several days on ice or at room temperature ( Figures 6A and 6B ). Complex formation between Fab S230 and wild-type SARS-CoV S led to formation of postfusion rosettes, and the frequency of this transition was enhanced with longer incubation times and/or by trypsin cleavage ( Figures  6C-6F , S5B, and S5C). The S 1 subunit acts as a ''chaperone,'' contributing to stabilize S 2 in the prefusion state by reducing its propensity to transition to the postfusion conformation. Proteolytic cleavage at the S 1 /S 2 , S 2 ' sites or shedding of the S 1 subunit, however, were not strictly required for refolding of the S ectodomain trimer to occur (Figures 6C 6E, 6G, and 6I).",

Refolding of coronavirus S glycoproteins to the postfusion conformation can be detected by the appearance of a proteinase-K-resistant band migrating at approximately 55 kDa when analyzed by SDS-PAGE. This molecular species comprises the postfusion 6-helix bundle, assembled from the heptad repeats 1 and 2, since its formation could be inhibited in the presence of a heptad-repeat-derived peptide that prevents completion of the conformational transition (Matsuyama and Taguchi, 2009). Addition of the S230 Fab ( Figure 7A ) or the ACE2 ectodomain ( Figure 7B ) to SARS-CoV S-pseudotyped MLV in the presence of trypsin led to the formation of a proteinase-K-resistant band migrating at approximately 55 kDa, thereby demonstrating that both the antibody and the natural receptor promoted S fusogenic conformational changes in the context of a membrane-embedded full-length S.",

            "text": "Our negative-staining EM findings suggest that ACE2 bound to the SARS-CoV S trimer with a lower affinity than S230 ( Figures  6A-6I ). Since binding of ACE2 to the isolated B domain was reported to have an equilibrium dissociation constant (K D ) in the nanomolar range (Li et al., 2005c) , one would expect that full saturation should occur rapidly in the conditions of our experiments (100-fold concentration excess over the K D ). Previous reports, however, suggested a lower affinity of the fulllength S trimer, relative to the isolated B domain, for ACE2 (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018; Matsuyama and Taguchi, 2009; Song et al., 2018) . We propose that the conformational landscape of the B domains in the context of the SARS-CoV S trimer, sampling open and closed conformations, decreases the apparent binding affinity for ACE2 and S230 due to masking of their binding sites in the closed state. A similar effect has previously been described for ubiquitin (Michielssens et al., 2014) . The higher binding affinity of S230 for SARS-CoV S, compared to ACE2 ( Figure S7 ), resulted in increased complex formation, which explains the more efficient Fab-mediated membrane fusion activation compared to the receptor ( Figures  6C-6J and S6 ). LCA60 could interact with all possible B domain states. In contrast, S230 binding was restricted to partially or fully open B domains and promoted S fusogenic conformational changes in a way reminiscent of the natural receptor, ACE2. These outcomes indicate that S triggering could work through a ratcheting mechanism involving sequential binding of a receptor molecule to each of the RBM, which in turn traps the B domains in the open conformation. Opening of the B domains releases the constraints imposed on the fusion machinery, thereby allowing the S trimer to refold and fuse the viral and host membranes.",

Opening of each of the three B domains reduces the number of interactions between the S 1 and S 2 subunits and specifically releases the constraints imposed on the heptad-repeat 1-central helix hairpin, which is known to completely refold during the membrane fusion process . The 660-\u00c5 2 decrease in buried surface area at the interface between the S 1 and S 2 subunits upon opening of the three B domains destabilizes the pre-fusion state and increases its probability of refolding, as observed upon complex formation with ACE2 or S230. Proteolytic activation is likely required to ensure that S glycoproteins will work in synergy, with proper spatial and temporal coordination, to drive fusion of the viral and host membranes. The large number of S glycoproteins decorating the surface of coronaviruses suggests that multiple trimers work in concert for formation of a fusion pore. We expect this activation mechanism to hold true for all coronaviruses using domain B for interacting with their proteinaceous receptor. We view the S 1 subunit as a molecular chaperone, stabilizing the prefusion state of the fusion machinery, and coordinating receptor binding with membrane fusion. In summary, coronaviruses appear to have evolved a fine-tuned balance between masking of the RBM, to limit neutralization by the humoral host immune response, and their necessary exposure, to enable receptor recognition and infection of host cells.",

            "text": "CryoEM Model building and analysis UCSF Chimera (Goddard et al., 2007) and Coot were used to fit atomic models (PDB: 5W9J for MERS and PDB: 5X58 for SARS) into the cryoEM maps. The crystal structure of LCA60 or S230 were also fit into density using UCSF Chimera. The models were subsequently manually rebuilt using Coot (Brown et al., 2015; Emsley et al., 2010) . N-linked glycans were hand-built into the density where visible and the models were refined and relaxed using Rosetta (Wang et al., 2016) . Glycan refinement relied on a dedicated Rosetta protocol, which uses physically realistic geometries based on prior knowledge of saccharide chemical properties (Frenz et al., 2019) , and was aided by using both sharpened and unsharpened maps. Models were analyzed using MolProbity (Chen et al., 2010) and privateer (Agirre et al., 2015) . Figures were generated using UCSF ChimeraX (Goddard et al., 2018) . Negative stain electron microscopy Protein was adsorbed to glow-discharged carbon-coated copper grids for 1 min prior to a 3X wash with water and 2% uranyl formate staining. Micrographs were recorded using the Leginon software (Suloway et al., 2005) on a 100kV FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit with a Gatan Ultrascan 4000 4k x 4k CCD camera at 67,000 nominal magnification. The defocus ranged from 1.0 to 2.0 mm and the pixel size was 1.6 \u00c5 . Particles were picked automatically in a reference free manner using DogPicker. Contrast transfer function (CTF) estimation was performed using GCTF (Zhang, 2016) . Class averages were generated using Relion2.1 (Kimanius et al., 2016) . Crystallization, data collection and data processing of LCA60 and S230 Fab LCA60 crystals were grown in hanging drop set up with a mosquito at 20 C using 150 nL protein solution and 150 nL mother liquor solution containing 30% (v/v) Jeffamine ED-2001 pH 7.0 and 0.1 M HEPES pH 7.0. The LCA60 dataset was collected at the ALS beamline 5.0.1 and processed to 3.0 \u00c5 resolution in space group P2 1 , with cell dimensions a = 70. 72 \u00c5 b = 69.57 \u00c5 and c = 93.84 \u00c5 , using XDS (Kabsch, 2010) and Aimless (Evans and Murshudov, 2013) . Fab S230 crystals were grown in hanging drop set up with a mosquito at 20 C using 150 nL protein solution and 150 nL mother liquor solution containing 3.5 M sodium formate pH 7.0. Crystals were cryo-protected using the mother liquor solution supplemented with 30% glycerol. The S230 dataset was collected at the ALS beamline 5.0.1 and processed to 1.5 \u00c5 resolution in space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 using XDS and Aimless. The structures of Fab LCA60 and Fab S230 were solved by molecular replacement using Phaser (McCoy et al., 2018) and homology models as search models. The coordinates were subsequently improved and completed using Buccaneer (Cowtan, 2006) and COOT (Brown et al., 2015; Emsley et al., 2010) and refined with BUSTER-TNT (Blanc et al., 2004) and REFMAC5 (Vagin et al., 2004) . Simulated annealing and omit map calculations were performed in Phenix (Adams et al., 2010) . The quality of the crystal structures were analyzed using MolProbity (Chen et al., 2010) . Crystallographic data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Table S4 . Ligand-induced conformational change analysis using negative staining EM The wild-type SARS-CoV S ectodomain trimer at 1 mg/mL (7.5 mM spike monomer) was incubated with equimolar amount of Fab S230 or 4-fold molar excess of ACE2 for 30 min or overnight (20-30 hours) on ice. Samples were taken at the end of the incubation and imaged by negative staining EM. The incubation mixtures were also subjected to digestion with trypsin at 1.6 mg/mL at room temperature and reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE at different time points. The digestion reaction was stopped by addition of 1.5 mM PMSF after 15 min for imaging by negative staining EM. To visualize the effect of ligand binding on pre-digested wildtype SARS-CoV S ectodomain trimer, the protein at 1 mg/mL was digested with 1.6 mg/mL trypsin for 15 min at room temperature before stopping the reaction using 1.5 mM PMSF. The pre-digested wild-type SARS-CoV S ectodomain trimer was incubated with S230 or ACE2 on ice for 30 min or overnight before negative staining EM imaging. Ligand-induced conformational change analysis using Western-blotting SARS-CoV S pseudovirions were thawed and incubated either with an equal volume of buffer, 10 mM of the ACE2 ectodomain or 500 nM S230 Fab for 30 min or 2 hours on ice. Trypsin (5 mg/mL) was then added to these samples for 30 min at 37 C. Subsequently, the samples were supplemented with 10 mg/mL proteinase K for 30 min at 4 C. 6X SDS-PAGE loading buffer was then added to all samples prior to boiling at 95 C for 5 min. Samples were run on a 4%-15% gradient Tris-Glycine Gel (BioRad) and transferred to PVDF membranes. An anti-S 2 SARS-CoV S polyclonal primary antibody (1:1,500 dilution, ThermoFisher) and an Alexa Fluor 680-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:20,000 dilution, Jackson Laboratory) were used for Western-blotting. A LI-COR processor was used to develop images.",

Nanospray LC-MS/MS was used to separate peptides over a 110-min gradient from 5% to 30% acetonitrile. A positive spray voltage of 2100 was used with an ion transfer tube temperature of 350 C. An electron-transfer/higher energy collision dissociation ion fragmentation scheme was used (Frese et al., 2013) . The supplemental higher energy collision dissociation energy was 0.15 for the runs. A resolution setting of 120,000 with an AGC target of 2*10 5 was used for MS1, and a resolution setting of 30,000 with an AGC target of 1*10 5 was used for MS2. The data was then analyzed using Byonic (Bern et al., 2012) against a custom database of recombinant coronavirus spike proteins, searching for glycan modifications with 12/24 ppm search windows for MS1/MS2, respectively. The in-solution digestions of the recombinant ectodomain were searched against a custom database of recombinant coronavirus spike proteins, proteases, and common contaminants. The in-gel digestion experiments were first searched against a database comprised of the full MERS-CoV proteome and the full Chlorocebus sabaeus (virus produced in VeroE6 cells) or human proteome (ectodomain produced in HEK293F cells) retrieved from UniProt, with variable N-linked glycosylations omitted from the search to identify background contaminants. The top 16 contaminants were then assembled together with the S sequence into a focused database for the glycopeptide identifications. In all experiments, up to three missed cleavages were permitted using C-terminal cleavage at R/K for trypsin, F/Y/W/M/L for chymotrypsin, R/K/F/Y/W/M/L for trypsin-chymotrypsin, T/A/S/V for alpha lytic protease, and N-terminal cleavage at D for AspN. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as fixed modification, methionine oxidation and carbamidomethylation of lysine as variable common 1, glycan modifications as variable common 2, with a variable common max. parameter of 3. The N-linked glycan databases of Byonic were merged into a single non-redundant set of glycan compositions for the searches. All reported glycopeptides in the Byonic results files were manually inspected for quality of fragment assignments. All glycopeptide identifications were merged into a single non-redundant list per sequon. Glycans were classified based on HexNAc content as highmannose (2 HexNAc), hybrid (3 HexNAc) or complex (> 3 HexNAc). Byonic search results were exported to mzIdentML format to build a spectral library in Skyline (MacLean et al., 2010) and extract peak areas for individual glycoforms from MS1 scans. The full database of variable N-linked glycan modifications from Byonic was manually added to the Skyline project file in XML format. Byonic search results from in-gel digestions of both virion samples and ectodomain were merged into a single spectral library and manually inspected for quantitation. Reported peak areas were pooled based on the number of HexNAc, Fuc or NeuAc residues to distinguish high-mannose/hybrid/complex glycosylation, fucosylation and sialylation, respectively.",

A baseline in 25mM Phosphate pH8.0, 150mM NaCl, 1% BSA was collected for 120 s prior to immersing the sensors in a serial dilution of either ACE2 or S230 for 600 s prior to dissociation in buffer for 600 s. ACE2 concentrations used were 1,000 nm, 333 nM, 111 nM, 37 nM, 12.3 nM, and 4.12 nM. S230 concentrations used were 100 nM, 33.3 nM, 11.1 nM, 3.7 nM, 1.23 nM, and 0.412 nM. Curve fitting was performed using a 1:1 binding model and the ForteBio data analysis software. Mean k on , k off values were determined with a global fit applied to all data.",

Supplemental Figures The effect of Fab S230 (A-B) or of the ACE2 ectodomain (C-D) on the conformational state of the wild-type SARS-CoV S ectodomain trimer was analyzed using single-particle electron microscopy of negatively stained samples. (A-D) Estimates of the fraction of particles corresponding to each state are represented as pie charts based on the number of particle images clustered in each group after reference-free 2D classification. Only prefusion and postfusion conformations were included in the calculations and the results are rendered using bins with a minimal width of 5%. Figure S7 . Biolayer Interferometry Analysis of S230 and ACE2 Binding to the SARS-CoV S 1 Subunit, Related to Figure 6 The SARS-CoV S 1 subunit was immobilized using amine coupling on ARG2 biosensors and binding of the S230 Fab (A) or the ACE2 ectodomain (B) at multiple concentrations were monitored. Equilibrium constants of dissociation and estimated errors using a global fit are indicated. The concentrations of S230 Fab or ACE2 ectodomain injected are indicated on each panel. Global fit curves are shown as black dotted lines. The vertical dashed lines indicate the transition between association and dissociation phases.",
