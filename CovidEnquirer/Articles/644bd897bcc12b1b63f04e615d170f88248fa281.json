Pseudotyping lentiviral vectors with the envelope glycoprotein from the Ebola Zaire virus, the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), the Mokola virus, and the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G) resulted in transduction of mouse alveolar epithelium, but gene expression in the lung of C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice waned within 90 days of vector injection. Intratracheal delivery of the four pseudotyped lentiviral vectors resulted in transgene-specific T-cell activation in both mouse strains, albeit lower than that achieved by intramuscular injection of the vectors. We performed an adoptive transfer of luciferase-specific T cells, isolated from spleen or lung of donor mice injected with VSV-Gpseudotyped lentivirus vector expressing luciferase into the muscle or lung, respectively, into recipient recombination-activating gene (RAG)-deficient mice transduced in lung with adenovirus expressing firefly luciferase (ffluc2). Gene expression declined within 7 days of adoptive transfer approaching background levels by day 36. Taken together, our results suggest that the loss of transduced cells in lung is due to VSV-G.HIV vector-mediated activation of transgene-specific T cells rather than as result of normal turnover of airway cells.",

To improve the transduction of airway epithelium in vivo, envelope glycoproteins derived from viruses tropic for airway epithelium, such as Ebola, 2,3 GP64, 8, 9 and severe acute respiratory syndrome, 7 have been generated. Although their transduction efficiency in in vitro model systems of airways 2,7 and the mouse nasal airway epithelium has been encouraging, efficient transduction of lung epithelium by pseudotyped lentiviral vectors remains challenging. Most lungdirected gene transfer studies utilized VSV-G-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors to transduce adult mouse lung or fetal mouse, 10 fetal lamb, 11 and fetal macaque lung. 12 Transduction of mouse nasal airway by VSV-G-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors requires preconditioning or damage of the airway for effective transduction. 13, 14 In lung VSV-G-pseudotyped HIV vector can transduce the alveolar epithelium and conducting airway epithelium in the absence of tight-junction disruption agents. [10] [11] [12] 15 In this study, we evaluated the transduction efficiency of lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with the surface glycoproteins of the Ebola Zaire virus variant NTDL6, LCMV, Mokola, and VSV-G in the lung of C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. As lentiviral vectors have been shown to activate CD8 + and CD4 + T-cell responses and are being developed as vaccines, [16] [17] [18] we also characterized the potential of these vectors to activate transgene and/or vector-specific T cells following lung delivery, which we hypothesized could compromise the potential of this approach in vivo.",

For C57BL/6 mice, GFP expression was evidenced only in the alveolar epithelium for all vectors at varying degrees of efficiency (Figure 1a,b) . VSV-G-and NTDL6-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors were the most efficient vectors followed by the Mokola and LCMV-pseudotypes (Figure 1a,b) . Analysis of the splenocytes for GFP-and gag-specific T cells demonstrated significant GFP-and gag-specific T-cell activation only in mice treated with the VSV-G-pseudotyped lentivirus vector (Figure 1c ; P < 0.05, analysis of variance, Student-Newman-Keuls test, n = 4). The transduction efficiency of the lentiviral vectors in BALB/c mouse lung was quite different when compared to C57BL/6 mouse lung. In this instance, the NTDL6-pseudotyped lentivirus vector was the most efficient at transducing the alveolar epithelium followed by the LCMV-and Mokola-pseudotyped vectors (Figure 1e,f) . The least efficient vector in BALB/c mouse lung was the VSV-G-pseudotyped vector (Figure 1e,f) . Most interesting, however, was the pattern of GFPspecific T-cell activation. In BALB/c mouse lung, all four pseudotyped lentiviral vectors activated high frequencies of GFP-specific T cells (Figure 1g) . No significant activation of gag-specific T cells was observed for any of the pseudotyped lentiviral vectors.",

It is well documented that direct muscle injection of vectors elicits high frequencies of transgene-and in some instances vectorspecific T cells. Lentiviral vectors were pseudotyped with NTDL6, LCMV, Mokola, or VSV-G and injected into the right hindlimb of C57BL/6 or BALB/c mice. units (TU) (data not shown). C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice (n = 4) were necropsied at day 17 after lentivirus vector injection. The spleens were harvested for lymphocyte isolation and subsequent analysis by IFN\u03b3 ELISpot for GFP-and gag (p17/p24)-specific T cells. For both C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice, all four pseudotyped lentiviral vectors activated high frequencies of GFP-specific T cells (Figure 1d ,h, respectively). There was also a nonstatistical significant trend of a higher GFP-specific T-cell activation in BALB/c mice. Intriguingly, we observed significant activation of gag-specific T cells only in C57BL/6 mice injected with the VSV-G-pseudotyped lentivirus vector (Figure 1d ).",

We next evaluated the impact of these transgene-specific T cells on the long-term gene expression mediated by the delivery of the VSV-G-pseudotyped lentivirus vector to mouse lung. Vector was injected i.t. into C57BL/6 and BALB/c mouse lung and gene transfer efficiency as well as transgene-specific T-cell activation were monitored longitudinally up to day 90 after the single vector dose instillation. Specifically, vector-treated mice were killed at days 7, 21 (peak of transgene expression), 42, and 90 (proposed turnover time of airway epithelium). In terms of GFP expression, VSV-G-pseudotyped lenti virus vector-mediated gene expression in alveolar epithelium was higher in C57BL/6 than BALB/c mouse lung at days 7, 42, and 90 (P < 0.05, Student's t-test) (Figure 2a,d, respectively) . Although gene expression was stable in C57BL/6 mouse lung through to day 42, there was a significant decrease (P < 0.05, analysis of variance, Student-Newman-Keuls test) in the number of GFP-expressing cells by day 90. Interestingly, GFP-specific T cells were present as early as day 7, increased by day 42, and were still present at day 90 after vector injection (Figure 2b) . For BALB/c mice, the number of GFP-positive alveolar epithelial cells was low but remained stable to day 21 (Figure 2d) . By day 42, however, there was a significant decrease in the number of GFP-expressing cells and by the end of the experiment (day 90) only rare GFP-expressing cells were observed (Figure 2d) . When compared to C57BL/6 mice, we observed similar GFP-specific T-cell activation at day 7. However, unlike in C57BL/6 mice, in BALB/c mice GFP-specific T-cell responses peaked at day 21 and remained at high levels through day 90 (the end of the experiment) (Figure 2e) . Taken together, the GFP expression and transgene-specific T-cell activation data suggest that GFP-specific T cells destroyed GFP-expressing cells in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mouse lung around 6 weeks after vector injection, evidenced as a significant elevation of GFP-specific T cells and a significant decrease of GFP-expressing cells. Indeed, in BALB/c mice, we found a clear correlation between the high frequencies of GFP-specific T cells (Figure 2e ) and the diminution of GFP expression in lung (Figure 2d) .",

Few studies have delivered lentiviral vectors directly to the lung airways in vivo. [10] [11] [12] Sinn et al. demonstrated that GP64-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors (based on the feline immunodeficiency virus) expressing firefly luciferase can effectively transduce the BALB/c mouse nasal airway epithelium resulting in yearlong transgene expression. 8, 9 However, in another study Kremer et al. showed that GP64-pseudotyped lentivirus vector-mediated gene transfer to C57BL/6 mouse nose was low and waned within 6 months of vector inoculation. 22 As it has been proposed that the turnover of the mouse airway epithelium is in the order of 3 months (ref. 23 ) the diminution of LacZexpressing cells in the Kremer study could be explained as normal turnover of positively transduced terminally differentiated airway cells. In light, however, of the recent report that the mouse airway epithelium turnover is in the order of >12 months (ref. 24) a plausible explanation for the loss of gene expression with time in the Kremer study 22 is the activation of cytolytic T cells.",

            "text": "We hypothesized that lentivirus vector-mediated transduction of resident lung antigen-presenting cells could activate transgene-and/or vector-specific T cells that could negatively impact on effective gene transfer to mouse lung epithelium. When four different pseudotyped lentiviral vectors were injected i.t. into BALB/c mice, we observed high levels of transgene-specific T cells, the frequencies of which were similar to those observed following i.m. injection of these vectors. In C57BL/6 mice, only one of the four vectors, the VSV-G-pseudotyped lentivirus vector, activated both transgene-and vector-specific T cells following i.t. delivery. This difference in T-cell activation between BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice did not appear to depend on the vector performance in lung as the NTDL6-, LCMV-, and Mokola-pseudotyped vectors transduced the alveolar epithelium of both mouse models equally well. Interestingly, in the longitudinal gene expression studies, the kinetics of GFP-specific T-cell activation between the two mouse models was different. The peak of GFP-specific T-cell activation for C57BL/6 mice was found to be around day 42 whereas for BALB/c mice it appeared to be around day 21. When we correlated the frequency of GFP-specific T-cell activation with the corresponding number of GFP-expressing cells in the airway of each vector-treated animal, we observed a pattern of diminution of GFP expression soon after the peak of GFP-specific T-cell activation. As the VSV-G-pseudotyped lentivirus vector was equally efficient at activating GFP-specific T cells in both mouse strains and given the availability of RAG-deficient/C57BL/6 mice, we studied the cytolytic properties of C57BL/6 lung-lymphocytes and also splenocytes activated in response to lung or muscle delivery of either VSV-G-pseudotyped lentivirus vector or adenovirus vector. We confirmed the previous findings that adoptive transfer of adenovirus-activated splenocytes in RAG-deficient/C57BL/6 mice can destroy transgene-expressing cells. [25] [26] [27] We also found that lymphocytes isolated from lung of C57BL/6 mice injected i.t. with adenovirus can destroy transgene-expressing cells. Most importantly, we demonstrate that VSV-G-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors also have the potential to elicit cytolytic transgene-specific T cells when delivered to the lung of C57BL/6 mice.",

            "text": "It has become increasingly apparent that the therapeutic benefit of viral-mediated gene therapy may be hindered by the activation of destructive T cells activated in response to the therapeutic gene product and/or the gene transfer vector. 28 Indeed, it is long known that adenovirus vector delivery to lung activates cytolytic transgene-specific T cells 29 that have hampered the development of adenovirus as a gene therapy vector. Our findings suggest that similar issues are associated with the application of pseudotyped lentiviral vectors in lung, which may hinder the development of these vectors for gene therapy of pulmonary genetic diseases, such as cystic fibrosis. In this study, we used the GFP and luciferase reporter genes to study transgene-specific T-cell activation following lentivirus-mediated gene transfer to mouse lung. Both these transgenes have been demonstrated to elicit transgene-specific T cells in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. 30 Nonimmunogenic transgenes, including rhesus \u03b1-fetoprotein 31 and the rhesus \u03b2-chain of chorionic gonadotropin, 32 which express \"self \"-antigen have demonstrated lack of transgene-specific immune response activation in large-animal gene transfer studies. 31 However, for gene therapy of genetic diseases caused by specific gene mutation(s), it is highly probable that expression of the \"normal\" therapeutic gene product will be recognized by the host as a \"non-self \"-antigen thus activating transgene-specific T cells with potentially adverse effects. Indeed, using computational analysis, we predicted the likelihood of a CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator)specific T-cell activation following expression of the therapeutic CFTR gene in cystic fibrosis subjects with the most common mutation, a deletion of phenylalanine at residue 508 (\u0394F508) (ref. 33) . We proposed that expression of the therapeutic CFTR in cystic fibrosis subjects with the \u0394F508 CFTR mutation could be subject to antigen crosspresentation or activation of quiescent CFTR-specific T cells. For the development of lentiviral vectors for gene therapy of pulmonary diseases, we propose the evaluation of the impact of transgene-specific T cells in lentiviral-based preclinical animal studies. VSV-G encoding, respectively, for the NTDL6, LCMV, Mokola, VSV-G viral envelope were used to generate pseudotyped lentivirus vector as previously described. 3, 34 Pseudotyped lentivirus vector was produced by triple transfection of 293T cells using the CaPO 4 precipitation method. 2 Vector was resuspended in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. TU/ml was determined for each vector stock by counting GFPpositive cells by limiting dilution on 293T cells. All preparations of lentivirus vector underwent quality control for presence of replication-competent lentivirus by monitoring p24 antigen expression using the p24 ELISA (Alliance HIV-1 p24 ELISA; PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) as previously shown. 2 Lentivirus vector stocks with titers ranging from 0.1 to 6 \u00d7 10 9 TU/ml were used. E1/E3-deleted replication-deficient Ad.Hu5 vectors expressing either \u03b2-galactosidase (LacZ) or ffluc2 (average titer of 5 \u00d7 10 12 particles/ml) were created as previously described. 30, 35 All experiments involving the production and in vivo evaluation of the pseudotyped lentiviral or adeno viral vectors were performed under biosafety level 2 containment, as approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee of the University of Pennsylvania.",
