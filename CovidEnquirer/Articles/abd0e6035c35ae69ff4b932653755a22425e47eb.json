            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a novel coronavirus that causes a severe lower respiratory tract infection in humans, emerged in the Middle East in 2012. Since then, MERS-CoV has caused an ongoing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic cases imported in Europe, North Africa, Southeast Asia, and the United States of America. As of 28th May 2014, 636 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV have been reported to World Health Organization including 14 cases imported by travelers. The epicenter of the current MERS-CoV epidemic is located in Saudi Arabia, where millions of pilgrims travel for two mass gatherings annually. In this review we summarize MERS-CoV cases in relation to travel with focus on the epidemiology and prevention in travelers. It is important to increase awareness of travelers about the risks and appropriate preventive measures and for health professionals to be on alert if a patient with severe respiratory symptoms reports a recent history of travel to the region affected with MERS-CoV. Measures should be taken by local health authorities of the affected countries in order to improve hospital hygiene. Finally, it is crucial to investigate the reasons for travelers' poor compliance with rules and recommendations issued by Saudi officials and to take appropriate measures in order to improve them. \u00aa",

In 2012, international tourist arrivals in the Middle East were estimated at 52 million [1] . Travelers can be exposed to various infectious agents and may facilitate their spread across borders. The importance of travel in the dissemination of respiratory diseases [2] has been demonstrated by the rapid worldwide spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 and the recent pandemic of influenza A (H1N1) in 2009 [3, 4] .",

Hypotheses include frequent zoonotic infections with limited subsequent human-to-human transmission chains with selfsustained epidemic in humans [16, 11] . There is growing evidence that the dromedary camel is a reservoir for the MERS-CoV and is playing an important role in the transmission to humans [15, 18, 19] . Although bats have been the ultimate progenitor virus, epidemiologically appears more likely that camels would be the source of infection in humans [6] . The ways of human-to-human transmission include direct transmission through droplets produced during coughing or sneezing, indirect transmission through contact with contaminated surfaces and devices [6] . A recent study showed that when MERS-CoV is added to unpasteurized camel milk stored at 4 C, the virus remains infectious beyond 72 h but that infectious viruses could not be found after pasteurization [7] .",

The travel-associated MERS-CoV cases reported by countries outside the Arabian Peninsula in 2014 occurred in persons with residence in or travel to countries of the Middle East. The first imported case in Greece [11] increased to six the number European countries with confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection amongst travelers, namely Germany, Greece, France, Italy, Netherlands and the United Kingdom (UK) [6] . Furthermore, imported primary cases have been reported by other countries outside Europe such as Egypt, Tunisia, Malaysia and the Philippines (Fig. 1) [6]. Characteristics of MERS-CoV infection cases in travelers are presented in Table 1 . The majority of them were male (92.8%), and between 27 and 73 years of age, with a case fatality rate of 28.5%. Most common destination was Saudi Arabia (64.2%).

Many Middle Eastern countries are home to large foreign-born populations including migrant workers. Five of all MERS CoV cases amongst travelers concerned expatriates who resided in Saudi Arabia [11, 16, 17] ; three of them were health-care workers [16, 17] ; this highlights the importance of adherence to recommended infection-control measures, such as standard, contact, and airborne precautions (including eye protection), for health-care workers working in health care settings in the affected countries, while managing patients under investigation or who have probable or confirmed MERS-CoV infections [16] . Contact with animals, in particular visiting, or working in a camel farm is considered a risk factor for acquiring the disease; the Malaysian pilgrim, the first UK and the two German imported cases reported contact with camels during their stay in the Arabian Peninsula (35.7% of all cases) [10, 14, 22] .

Communicable disease outbreaks of various infectious diseases have been reported repeatedly, during and following the Hajj [23] . Several studies have been carried out for the surveillance of MERS-CoV in pilgrims [24e27]. A rapid acquisition of respiratory viruses, mainly rhinovirus was found in 39% of French pilgrims who suffered from respiratory symptoms soon after commencing the 2012 Hajj, with 11% returning infected to France with potential spreading of these respiratory viruses [25] . No case of MERS-CoV nasal carriage was evidenced in this cohort, despite high rates of respiratory symptoms [26] . Similarly, there was no evidence of MERS-CoV nasal carriage among Hajj pilgrims in another study which was performed on pilgrims from 22 countries attending the 2013 Hajj [27] . This study revealed that rates of compulsory vaccinations uptake were high, whereas uptake of pneumococcal and flu seasonal vaccinations were low, including among the highrisk population showing pilgrims' poor compliance with vaccine recommendations [27] ; this may explain the increased prevalence of influenza in pilgrims [28] . Although there was no evidence of MERS-CoV nasal carriage during screening of Hajj pilgrims, three of the cases amongst travelers concerned pilgrims returning from Mecca to the country where they reside (Malaysia, Netherlands and United Kingdom, respectively) [9, 16] . The patient from Malaysia, a 54 year-old man with underlying health conditions traveled to Saudi Arabia with a pilgrimage group of 18 and visited a camel farm, during which he consumed camel milk. There was no human-to-human transmission observed amongst close contacts and in health-care facilities in Malaysia [16] . The case from the Netherlands which concerned a 70 year old man reported no contact with animals or consumption of raw animal products. Identification of close contacts, including flight contacts was also initiated [16] . Cluster cases were reported during contact tracing of the third case which concerned an adult middle-aged male in the United Kingdom who visited Mecca and Medina on pilgrimage. No direct contact with animals or with people with severe respiratory illness was reported in the 10 days before the onset of his illness. Contact tracing, including aircraft passengers identified two secondary cases among family members without a history recent travel: one developed a severe respiratory illness and died and the other influenza-like illness; no other severe cases were identified or CoV detected in respiratory samples among 135 contacts for the following 10 days [9] .",

The majority of MERS-CoV cases are reported in Saudi Arabia with a significant rate of hospital transmission. The possibility of airborne transmission is very low and secondary cases are only likely after close contact and due to severe symptoms there is only little likelihood of unregistered clinical cases. Countries should focus on increasing awareness of travelers visiting friends and relatives and of health professionals about patients with severe respiratory symptoms who report a recent history of travel to the region affected with MERS-CoV. Travel medicine practitioners should not discourage travelers to visit these countries as long as they follow the basic hygienic measures. Travelers should be advised to avoid local hospitals if medical help is needed and to be visited by a doctor instead. Measures should be taken by local health authorities of the affected countries in order to improve hospital hygiene. In addition, it is crucial to investigate the reasons for travelers' poor compliance with rules and recommendations issued by Saudi officials and to take appropriate measures in order to improve them. An internationally coordinated effort to better understand global population movements in this area and the most probable pathways for international spread of MERS-CoV could help direct anticipatory MERS-CoV surveillance and public health preparedness to mitigate its potential global health and economic impacts.",
