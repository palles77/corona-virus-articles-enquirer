We have examined the impact on suicides following the death of a famous Hong Kong pop singer whose death from suicide by jumping from a height, occurred on 1st April 2003, and resulted in extensive and often dramatic media coverage. Methods: Data on suicides were obtained from the Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department and the Coroner's Court. The numbers of suicides in 2003 before and after the death of celebrity were compared to the same period in 1998-2002. The case files and suicide notes of people who died by suicide in 2003 were also studied qualitatively. Results: There was a significant increase in suicides following the celebrity death, compared with the average over the preceding three months as well as the corresponding monthly average during 1998-2002. It was particularly marked in a subgroup comprising males, aged 25-39 years, many of whom died by jumping. The name of the celebrity was often mentioned in case files and suicide notes. Limitations: The statistical results in showing the excess of suicides were based on aggregated data only. Conclusions: This study provides further confirmation of the potential harmful consequences of sensational and excessive reporting of celebrity deaths.",

            "text": "Mortality data (including suicides) in Hong Kong, SAR during the period 1998 to 2003 were made available by the Census and Statistics Department and the Coroner's Court. All suicide deaths, coded in the range of E950-E959 were classified and recorded according to the ICD-9 standard (World Health Organization, 1978) . With the consent of the Coroner's Court we examined the case files of people who died by suicide in 2003. The files included information on socio-demographic variables, psychiatric illness, police investigation files and suicide notes (where available). For comparison, we selected the case files of people who died by suicide during the first six months of each year between 1998 and 2002. The suicide rate in Hong Kong has increased markedly in recent years, rising from 13.2 per 100,000 in 1998 to 18.6 per 100,000 in 2003 (Center for Suicide Research and Prevention, 2005) . Therefore to allow a robust comparison of the monthly distribution of suicides against the background of this increasing trend, we detrended the monthly suicide numbers by subtracting the mean of the first six months in the corresponding year from the monthly figures. (Kaiser and Maravall, 2001; Harvey and Proietti, 2005) . The number of suicides in April 2003 was compared with the average for the first six months of the year, the average for the immediately preceding three months (January-March 2003) , and with the average for April in the preceding 5 years (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) . A chi-square test was used to examine the significance of differences in distribution. In addition, we also examined the Coroner's death reports as well suicide notes for suicide deaths in 2003, and identified those which mentioned Cheung's death. Tables 1a and 1b suggest that the increase in suicides in April 2003 was most marked for suicide by jumping from a height and among males aged 25-39 years. In that month, 42 male suicide deaths involved jumping from a height, which was 11 more than monthly average for the first six months of 2003. It was also 72% greater than the monthly average for the previous three months of 2003 (24.3 cases) (p b 0.01). A significant but smaller increment significance was also found in May 2003. On average about 6 males in this age group committed suicide by this method each month during the months of January to March 2003 and there was about 10 cases in this subgroup in April each year during the period 1998-2002, whereas 15 males used this method in April 2003. Moreover, the corresponding detrended figure was about 3.5 times higher than that of the average detrended figure for April in the preceding 5 years.",

The police reports and suicide notes provide another source of information about factors contributing to suicide. There were 13 cases in 2003 in which the death of Cheung was mentioned in either a suicide note (5 cases) or records of the police investigation (8 cases). In one case there was mention in both sources. The cases occurred between April and October 2003. The contents of the deaths notes are summarized in Appendix A. Among these 13 cases, nine were male and six of these were aged 25-39 years. Four individuals expressed their suicidal intentions implicitly or explicitly by mentioning their desire either \"to accompany Cheung\" or \"to follow his way to exit\" (Cases 6, 10, 11 and 12). The remaining three individuals included people with life problems (Cases 8 and 9) and general distress (Case 13). It is unusual for a celebrity to be mentioned in a suicide note and only about 20% of suicides in Hong Kong are accompanied by suicide notes. The content of these notes commonly states the victim's specific instructions, including funeral arrangement, expresses affection for family members and loved ones, and gives details of the individual's own personal difficulties, health and/or financial problems (Ho et al., 1998) .",

However, the overall effect on suicides appears to have been relatively short lived. Other research on celebrity suicides or deaths has also shown relatively short-term effects on suicides, usually of between two and four weeks (Hawton et al., 2000; Phillips, 1974; Stack, 1987) . It is important to note that there was no significant decrease in suicides in May or June 2003. This is consistent with previous studies which have rejected the hypothesis that the imitative effect caused suicides to occur earlier than would otherwise have been the case (Hawton et al., 2000; Phillips, 1974) . However, the death investigation files from the Coroner's Court showed that some further individuals who died by suicide between May and October 2003 had also mentioned the name of Cheung in suicide notes. This suggests the possibility that celebrity suicide could have a longer-term effect, even though it might be insufficient to have a significant effect on the aggregated monthly suicide rate.",

The major increase in suicide deaths in Hong Kong was among males aged 25-39 years. This suggests that the characteristics of the model were crucial factors in the overall imitative effect.

            "text": "Three other factors may have contributed to a rise in suicides in April 2003, namely high unemployment, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic, and a seasonal effect. If the high unemployment rate contributed to the rise in suicides the effect should have been seen not only in April but for an extended period. Also, the months of May-July period and not April had the highest unemployment rate (8.5%) in Hong Kong. Furthermore, it should have affected the community as a whole rather than a particular subgroup, and a particular method of suicide. Though the outbreak of SARS hits Hong Kong badly, there was no marked increase in suicides during May and June even though the community was still very much in the midst of SARS throughout the territory. In addition there was no increase in suicides during the SARS crisis in Singapore, which was also severely affected in 2003 (Chia, in preparation) . Finally, research in Hong Kong has shown no evidence of significant seasonal variation in suicides in either gender and certainly no indication of an April peak (Yip and Yang, 2004) . While it is still not possible to be absolutely certain that the rise in suicide deaths in April 2003 was mainly due to media reporting of Cheung's death, the evidence strongly suggests that it was, especially because of the very marked increase in suicides in young adult males, the excess of deaths by jumping, and the evidence from suicide notes and police files. This conclusion is consistent with research from other countries which has shown that the death of a celebrity can ignite a contagious effect within a community (Hawton et al., 2000; Takahashi, 1998; Tousignant et al., 2005) . For this reason, the World Health Organization has listed \"toning down reports in the media\" as one of its six key strategies on suicide prevention (World Health Organization, 1998) . Improving media reporting and portrayal of suicidal behaviour is also one of the major initiatives included in the national suicide prevention strategies of several countries (Commonwealth of Australia, 2000; Department of Health and Human Services, 2001; Department of Health, 2002) . Media professionals should be well informed about the potential risks associated with reporting celebrity suicides. Several media guidelines are available to assist media professionals on how to report suicide news in a responsible manner (American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, 2002; Center for Suicide Research and Prevention, 2004; Samaritans, 2002; World Health Organization, 2000) . However, a systematic review of suicide prevention strategies has highlighted the need for evaluation of the effectiveness of such guidelines (Mann et al., 2005) .",

We cannot be certain of the mechanisms involved in the increase in suicides following Cheung's death. It might have been due to bereavement effects of his death rather than a modeling effect of celebrity suicide. However, our analysis of suicide notes and police reports suggests that copycat suicidal behaviour is likely to have been the main mechanism.",
