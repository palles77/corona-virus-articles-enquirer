Recently, sensitive PCR assays have been introduced and are now considered to be the gold standard for the detection and differentiation of all feline haemoplasma species [33, 36, 37] . Using PCR, the worldwide distribution of feline haemotropic mycoplasma infections has been documented [7, 20, 29, 32, 34, 41] . To date, no commercial routine serologic assay is available, and serodiagnostics have depended on crude Mhf antigens [1, 5] . Recently, an immunodominant protein of Mycoplasma suis, a porcine haemoplasma species, was identified as HspA1, a surfacelocalised dnaK analogue [15] [16] [17] .",

            "text": "The natural mode of feline haemoplasma transmission remains controversial. Experimental transmission by the intraperitoneal, intravenous, and oral inoculation of infected blood has been successful [4] . However, these early studies were performed prior to the introduction of specific molecular assays, so it is not known which feline haemoplasma species were studied. More recently, blood transfusions have been reported to be a source of Mhf and CMhm infections [8, 37] . Furthermore, blood-sucking arthropods may be involved in the transmission of feline haemoplasmas. While almost 2 000 unfed Ixodes spp. ticks collected from vegetation in Switzerland tested PCR-negative for feline haemoplasmas, and positive results for CMhm and CMt were only obtained from some Ixodes spp. and Rhipicephalus spp. ticks collected directly from animals [39] , CMhm DNA has been detected in unfed Ixodes ovatus ticks in Japan [31] . This suggests a transstadial transmission of CMhm at least in the latter tick species. Moreover, Mhf and CMhm DNA was detected in cat fleas (Ctenocephalides felis) collected from experimentally and naturally infected cats and in flea faeces [18, 28, 39, 42, 43] , but the transmission of Mhf and CMhm via C. felis has not been proven [42, 43] .",

In the same study, however, Mhf and CMhm DNA were not detected in the saliva and faeces of some naturally infected cats, despite high blood haemotropic mycoplasma loads [39] and most recently CMhm but not Mhf was detected in the saliva and salivary glands of experimentally infected cats [2] . We thus hypothesised that feline haemoplasmas, and particularly CMt or CMhm, could be transmitted by direct contact (social or aggressive) via saliva [39, 40] . Our hypothesis is supported by the general increase of feline haemoplasma infections, and particularly Mhf, CMhm and CMt infections, in male cats [21, 32, 37, 38] . Moreover, an early study reported that a history of cat bite-associated abscesses increased the relative risk of infection with haemotropic mycoplasmas [11] ; however, the particular haemoplasma species could not be molecularly differentiated at the time of that study.",

When the cats remained PCR-negative at week 10, they were inoculated with a larger blood volume containing 4 \u00b7 10 5 CMt copies (Tab. I, A IV). When the cats again remained PCR-negative at week 9 following the larger dose, they were challenged subcutaneously with 6 \u00b7 10 3 CMt copies in 50 lL of CMt-positive blood (Tab. I, A V) in order to confirm that the cats could be infected with CMt. Group B cats received 1 \u00b7 10 3 CMt copies in 10 lL of blood subcutaneously (Tab. I, B III). In cat 7, which remained PCR-negative, the inoculation was repeated 14 weeks after the first subcutaneous inoculation (Tab. I, B IV).",

According to our findings, however, CMt-positive saliva did not pose a major risk of infection to na\u00efve cats. Nonetheless, one cat (Cat 2) seroconverted following the oral inoculation of CMt-positive saliva. Thus, in this cat, it appeared that at least CMt antigens must have been transmitted via saliva. Any resulting CMt replication must have been below the detection limit of the PCR assay or occurred in tissues other than the peripheral blood. It is unlikely that the CMt load in the saliva samples was too low to result in a positive PCR result given that the same copy number administered in blood was sufficient to infect cats following subcutaneous inoculation, even without pre-existing prednisolone treatment.",

One cat, Cat 2, was already seropositive at the time of subcutaneous exposure because it had seroconverted after oronasal exposure to CMt-positive saliva (see above). Cat 2 only became PCR-positive later in the course of infection, following subcutaneous exposure (day 45 p.i.), and developed a lower peak CMt blood load (1.4 \u00b7 10 3 copies/mL) compared to the other eight cats (median peak load: 5.7 \u00b7 10 4 copies/mL). The second blood type B cat, Cat 7, remained blood PCRnegative, even after repeated CMt exposures. This cat subsequently seroconverted after the second CMt inoculation but was never blood PCR-positive. While the oronasal exposure to CMt antigens and the resulting immune response in Cat 2 might have led to partial protection and a reduced CMt load, the antibiotic treatment of Cat 7 three weeks before the first CMt blood inoculation may have influenced the course of infection. Alternatively, the blood type of the two cats, both blood type B, or other genetic factors may have played a role in their susceptibility to CMt. However, due to the small number of subjects in the present study, this cannot be determined. This course of CMt infection described herein, i.e., seroconversion in the absence of CMt in the peripheral blood, as detected by real-time PCR, has not been described previously. The microscopy of blood smears to diagnose CMt infection is not recommended, which is consistent with earlier findings [32, 37] . We assume that the inability to detect CMt via this method may be due to the low CMt blood load [37] , which was found to be significantly lower than the Mhf blood load [37] . Even the peak CMt blood load (10 6 copies/mL) corresponded to only one CMt copy per 10 3 to 10 4 erythrocytes, a number that is undetectable by routine light microscopy.",

The antibiotic treatment may have cleared CMt from the blood and tissues, whereas a sequestered CMt infection may have led to the continuous low-level stimulation of the humoural immune response in untreated cats.
