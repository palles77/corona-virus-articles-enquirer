For each outbreak, we defi ned the initial source or sources of the fi rst public communication as the individual, organization, or website that fi rst publicly communicated information regarding the disease threat (locally or internationally, orally or in writing). The corresponding date of communication was identifi ed by using outbreak reports disseminated by ProMED-mail (10) . All outbreaks were categorized as having been fi rst communicated by >1 nongovernmental or governmental source, or simultaneously by both types of sources. When an outbreak was simultaneously fi rst communicated by nongovernmental and governmental sources (n = 5), the outbreak was repeated in the dataset and each source was given credit. This adjustment increased the number of outbreak events to 403.",

The effect of the initial reporting source on the timeliness of outbreak communication was quantifi ed by using negative binomial regression after adjusting for geographic region and whether the outbreak occurred before or after SARS. These variables were included in the model on the basis of a priori assumptions that public health infrastructure can vary by geographic and political region and that new pandemic preparedness strategies, including use of informal information to initiate public health responses, were developed in response to the SARS epidemic (11) . Interaction terms between each variable were examined but were not included in the fi nal model because none reached statistical signifi cance (p>0.05). Temporal trends were assessed by using univariate negative binomial regression models, stratifi ed by source category. These models included 1 covariate for the year of outbreak start.",

We encountered diffi culty in selecting and consistently applying criteria to determine the initial source of public communication from ProMED-mail reports, which could have resulted in misclassifi cation bias. Although other reporting systems that use informal information exist, they either lack a publicly available archive (for example, Global Public Health Intelligence Network) (14) or their database did not cover the entire study period (for example, HealthMap) (15) . According to Heymann, et al., 65% of outbreaks recognized by WHO are fi rst identifi ed by informal sources (4), a proportion we did not fi nd. Some outbreak reports were excluded because of missing data. We were able to internally validate the data that remained, but these exclusions limited the study's statistical power. Finally, use of outbreak reports collected from the WHO Disease Outbreak News might limit the generalizability of our fi ndings to all infectious disease outbreaks. Despite these limitations, our data highlight the value of nongovernmental sources as an integral resource for providing timely information about global infectious disease threats, and demonstrate the signifi cant improvements in the timeliness of outbreak reporting made by governmental sources.
