Sensing the level and distributions of impurities help in the control of building systems and mitigate long term health risks. Rapid detection of infectious diseases in large public areas like airports and train stations may help limit exposure and aid in reducing the spread of the disease. Complete coverage by sensors to account for any release scenario of chemical or biological warfare agents may provide the opportunity to develop isolation and evacuation plans that mitigate the impact of the attack.

The PF operator (or the Markov matrix) is used to construct an observability gramian that naturally incorporates sensor accuracy, location constraints, and sensing constraints. The algorithm determines the response times, sensor coverage maps, and the number of sensors needed. The utility of the procedure is illustrated using four examples: a literature example of the flow field inside an aircraft cabin and three air flow fields in different geometries. The effect of the constraints on the response times for different sensor placement scenarios is investigated. Knowledge of the response time and coverage of the multiple sensors aides in the design of mechanical systems and response mechanisms. The methodology provides a simple process for place sensors in a building, analyze the sensor coverage maps and response time necessary during extreme events, as well as evaluate indoor air quality. The theory established in this paper also allows for future work in topics related to construction of classical estimator problems for the sensors, real-time contaminant transport, and development of agent dispersion, contaminant isolation/removal, and evacuation strategies.",

People in the western world can spend up to 90% of their lives indoors [1, 2] . Leaky roofs, problems with the HVAC systems, construction of overly tight buildings, the use of synthetic building materials, and chemical based personal care products are primary causes for a variety of health related problems. The exposure to air pollutants (CO2, VOCs, CO, radon, mold, atmospheric particulate matter, and microbial contaminants) may lead to immediate or long-term effects health issues. Immediate symptoms may be as mild as headaches, dizziness, fatigue, and irritation of the sinuses [3] . People most susceptible to these air pollutants include the young, the elderly, and the chronically ill [3] . These effects may also be amplified for people suffering from asthma, which affects approximately 26 million people in the US [4] , resulting in 2 million hospital visits in 2010 [3] , and costing Americans approximately $56 billion from 2002 to 2007 [4] . Longterm exposure may lead to respiratory disease, heart disease, cancer, and can even be fatal [3] . Due to these factors, improving or maintaining indoor air quality (IAQ) is essential during the design process, construction, and the operating lifetime of buildings.",

The agents used during these attaches were highly lethal, and a rapid detection may have mitigated their impact. The TID are of concern in highly populated and confined areas such as close office quarters, train/subway stations, train/ subway cars, airports, aircraft, hospitals, and schools. Documented cases of the spread of influenza [7] and the SARS virus [8] have been reported in aircraft travel, outbreak of measles in office spaces [9] , and tuberculosis infection of health care workers [10] . A recent outbreak is the MERS-CoV outbreak in health care facilities in South Korea and China [11] .

The common link between these steps are the design, deployment, data collection, and data analysis of sensors in the building. The risk assessment stage relies on predictive modeling (zonal airflow network modeling, CFD and contaminant transport simulations, design of sensor locations, and construction of sensor estimators) to provide a priori design information for effective systems. The identification stage depends on sensors to provide critical information about contaminant levels and sources locations (using the sensor estimations for real-time estimation and control). The response strategies help control, isolate, or remove the detected contaminants (using sensor estimators for source identification, determine where to disperse neutralizing agents, and using real-time data to develop an evacuation strategy). In the application of IAQ the response strategies are HVAC controls for demand response of HVAC systems, which have been shown to be a viable energy saving control strategy and to increase IAQ [12e18] . For CBW/TID applications, the response strategies can include evacuation plans, a plan for dispersion of a neutralizing agent, or an isolation plan to prevent further spread of the CBW agent/TID pathogen.",

Optimization methods typically result in understanding some notion of the sensor locations, coverage volume, and response time for a given set of release scenarios. There has been some investigation as to which air flow model is most appropriate (CFD, zonal, or multizone) for optimization problems [31, 32] .

Genetic algorithm, simulated annealing, and perturbation stochastic approximation methods have been used to place CBW sensors with a CFD enhanced multizone airflow model [25,30e32] . Other examples include optimal sensor location for aircraft cabins starting from a set of initial sensor locations and a set of release scenarios [26] . General recommendations for sensor locations for an aircraft cabin have been given in Ref. [27] . The applicability of inverse methods for advection-diffusion problems have been recently reviewed [28] . The adjoint probability inverse modeling method has been shown to work well in a multizone airflow model where the number of potential sensor locations is relatively small [29] . However, when the number of potential locations for a sensor is fairly large, the method (especially when involving CFD for the forward problem) may become computationally prohibitive. The use of some heuristics is usually needed to alleviate some of the computational complexity. Inverse methods [23] along with artificial neural networks [33] have been used to quickly find the source location in a building through both CFD and multizone methods. Although optimization methods can be a powerful tool, designing a proper cost function that enables quick and smooth minimization is not always easy. Furthermore, these methods usually involve solving the contaminant advection-diffusion PDE. Finally, optimization methods are inherently iterative, and may require solving a large number of simulations to find the optimal locations. This iterative process can be computationally intensive. Optimization methods are also dependent on a set of release scenarios that are designed based on the space geometry and sensor application. The bottleneck for both optimization and inverse methods is the necessity of solving a partial differential equation for contaminant transport for numerous scenarios and multiple iterations.",

Such a formulation also allows novel developments in control theory to be applied for identifying sensor locations for multizone and CFD airflow simulations. Furthermore, such a formulation can leverage the impressive body of work on sensor placement, which is a classical problem in dynamical systems and state space systems. For instance, the continuous form of the Perron-Frobenius (PF) operator has been effectively used to determine where density (of, say, contaminants) gathers under the effect of non-linear vector fields [34] . More recently, the discrete finite dimensional form of the PF operator, which takes the form of a Markov Matrix, has been used to identify optimal sensing locations [35, 36] . Utilizing the finite dimensional PF operator has been shown to be a simple way to calculating real-time contaminant transport in buildings [37] . Additionally, such analysis also provides insight into the age of the air and where contaminants spend the most time [38] . The critical advantage of this method is that the finite dimensional PF operator method is relatively computationally inexpensive, as they do not require solving the (direct or adjoint) advection-diffusion PDE or minimization of a complicated cost function.",

The main idea is determining sensor locations from velocity vector fields (acquired from analytical methods, CFD, particle imaging velocimetry, etc.). We leverage the finite dimensional PF operator framework and showcase a sensor placement algorithm that is very easy to solve. This algorithm naturally accounts for complex geometries, constraints in sensor placement, as well as sensing constraints. We illustrate the capabilities of this framework by comparing results with established recommendations from published literature. The sensor placement strategy for a given building zone is investigated for both IAQ and CBW applications. This approach is a data driven method that maximizes the sensing volume by taking into account the number of sensors and the response time for a given accuracy of the sensors. The method described in this paper has the potential to provide designers, engineers, and architects with not only the sensor locations and sensor coverage for deployed wireless sensors, but also the framework for classical estimator problems and real time contaminant transport.",

The observability gramian is a control theoretic tool and is used to characterize the relative degree of observability of various states in the system (more specifically, the state space) [41] . The current work build upon our earlier work in Refs. [37] and [42] , where we extended the definition of the observability gramian to nonlinear flow field and advection diffusion PDEs. Roughly speaking, the observability gramian for advection diffusion PDE can be defined as a function from the physical space X to real valued nonnegative number. If the observability gramian on a particular region, say B3 X, is positive then the density function (contaminant distribution) on the set B, can be estimated by building an estimator. On the other hand, if the gramian on a particular set is zero then one cannot design an estimator to estimate the density supported on the set. Furthermore, if the value of the gramian on set B 1 3X is large compared to B 2 3X, then it is relatively easier to observer the density function on set B 1 compared to set B 2 . In other words, the gain of the estimator to estimate the density function on B 1 is smaller compared to one required to estimate density function on set B 1 . We refer the reader to [35] for more details on this discussion. Given the fundamental role that the observability gramian plays in the design of estimators, it is widely used in system and control theory as a natural cost function for the purpose of sensor placement. We extend this to the current application. Specifically, the observability gramian is constructed using the Markov matrix. We then use the observability gramian to identify locations/cells that increase the relative degree of observability of various cells. These cells will serve as the locations of the sensors.",

The outputs (in the context of this work) are the observations of sensors placed in discrete states of the domain. The discrete time observability gramian determines whether an arbitrary state is observable within a given time horizon, t. Consider a case where a sensor is placed at location i with reference to the contaminant tracking matrix Q \u00f0t\u00de . The indicator matrix C corresponding to a sensor placed in state i is given by C i . The relative degree of observability for different cells is given by (16) Note that Q \u00f0t\u00de C i for a single sensor placed in state i is a column vector with nonnegative entries. In particular, will be a column vector where the positive entries are states that are observable from state i and the zero entries are states that are not observable from state i.

Although a theoretically perfect sensor may be able to accurately sense the contaminant in states with low values, realistically sensors have accuracy thresholds. This problem is remedied by thresholding the values in the contaminant tracking matrix. The threshold value is a nondimensional value that describes the ratio of source release rate, the release time, and the value detected at the sensor, Eq. (18) . For a given source, the source releases contaminants at a given rate, S source ; over the given sensing period, t.

Location constraints exist because some practical limitations exist that preclude placing a sensor in a given state. Some practical limitations include the following: the sensor location is not serviceable; occupants have the ability to move or bump into the sensor, damage the sensor, or be annoyed by the location of the sensor; and sensor design limits the placement to a wall or ceiling. Location constraints exist for IAQ, CBW, and TID applications. Often expensive CBW and TID sensors would have to be placed outside the occupied zone, such that the sensors are not tampered with or easily damaged. Occupants may not want CO2 and VOC sensors in the occupied space such that they have to walk around them, avoid stepping on them, or for ascetic reasons. The placement of sensors at the top of a tall atrium may not be a good location, because if a sensor malfunctions the sensor may not be easily replaced or serviced.

That is, the algorithm includes release scenarios for every discrete volume (cells) in the CFD simulation. Furthermore, the total amount of contaminant released (independent of release time) within the sensing time determines the sensor placement. The variables in the placement algorithm are the number of sensors, the response time, and the total coverage of all the sensors.

For this reason, a location constraint is also added in this situation to constrain the sensors to locations outside the occupied space. Because the sensing volume is smaller, the response times are faster than the other two applications, Fig. 12 . For this application sensors tend to be placed near the occupied zone or at the outlet.

In reality, flow fields experience perturbations by occupants moving around the space, changes in air flow conditions (boundary conditions), and are usually transient. The flow fields produced by these perturbations and the changes in supply air temperature, supply air flow rate, and changes in the building envelope surface temperatures or thermal loads are transient in nature. The elegance of considering the flow field (and the associated contaminant transport dynamics) from a dynamical systems perspective allows leveraging rigorous mathematical tools for sensor placement. More importantly, this methodology can be naturally extended to transient flow fields (as formulated in Eq. (17) and also to uncertain (stochastic) flow fields [48] . This is the basis of two forthcoming papers that 1) investigate sensor locations for transient flow fields or multiple operating conditions, and 2) incorporate uncertainty in boundary conditions and the flow field to determine robust sensor locations.",

The algorithm uses the discrete form of the Perron-Frobenius operator (a Markov matrix) to construct a contaminant tracking matrix in which sensors are placed based on the largest column support in the contaminant tracking matrix. The addition of sensor accuracy along with placement constraints and sensing constraints are included in the algorithm. The algorithm considers all release scenarios of the contaminant (i.e. release in all states of the Markov matrix). We envision this algorithm to be an efficient alternative to current optimization/inverse based approaches to sensor placement in buildings.",

The effect of different placement and sensing constraints on the sensor network response time is also investigated. The algorithm provides a simple and rigorous framework to place sensors for various scenarios. In particular, this framework has direct utility for placing sensor nets for applications involving sensing of chemical and biological weapons, transmission of infectious diseases, and indoor air quality. The contributions of this paper has the ability to help designers, engineers, and researches better understand the coverage maps, response times, and number of sensors needed to effectively control the mechanical systems in buildings and design response and evacuation strategies during extreme events. The proposed framework for sensor placement can be easily extended to account for various sources of uncertainty in the building environment.",

For 2 sensors to sense all the Markov states in the aircraft, the sensors are also placed in the aisle of rows 1 and 2, Fig. 14b . The response time of the sensors is 8 s, which is less than the response time of a single sensor. The thresholded and constrained contaminant tracking matrix was computed for a sensing time of t \u00bc f4; 8; 12; 16g seconds. The column support in terms of the sensing volume for each Markov state and each time is shown in Fig. 15 .
