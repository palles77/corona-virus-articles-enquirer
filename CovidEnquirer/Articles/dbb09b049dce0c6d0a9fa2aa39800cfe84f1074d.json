The drastic enhancement of fluorescence intensity of berberine was attributed to the formation of an inclusion complex between HDB-\u2424-CD and berberine, which has been utilized as the basis of the fabrication of a berberine-sensitive fluorescence sensor. The proposed sensor was quite distinct from those fluorescent sensors for berberine reported so far which relied upon quenching the fluorescence of the sensing reagent immobilized on membrane by berberine. The response mechanism of optode membrane was discussed in detail from the view of molecular dynamics and the optimum steric configuration of the inclusion complex was presented by molecular dynamics simulation. The analytical performance characteristics of the proposed berberine-sensitive sensor were investigated. The sensor can be applied to the quantification of berberine with a linear range covering from 4.0 \u00d7 10 \u22127 to 2.0 \u00d7 10 \u22125 mol l \u22121 with a detection limit of 8.0 \u00d7 10 \u22128 mol l \u22121 . The sensor exhibits excellent reproducibility, reversibility and selectivity. The recommended method was successfully used for the determination of berberine in pharmaceutical preparations.",

Meanwhile, supramolecular transducing systems have attracted enormous research interest in the development of chemical sensors in recent years [5] . A variety of receptor molecules, such as cyclodextrin (CD) [6, 7] , crown ethers [8] , calixarenes [9] , and porphyrin [10] , as typical host compounds, can selectively recognize organic species. Among them, the naturally occurring chiral \u2423-, \u2424and \u2425-cyclodextrin are well known as simple model receptors which have the remarkable property of selectively including organic, in-organic and biological molecules in their toroidal cavity to form stable host-guest inclusion complexes [11] . The formation of an inclusion complex is often able to effect enhancements or perturbations of the photophysical and photochemical properties of included guest molecules [12] . Several weak intermolecular force between host and guest, such as dipole-dipole, hydrophobic, electrostatic, van der Waals, and hydrogen-bonding interaction, cooperatively contribute to the molecular recognition process [13] .",

            "text": "Berberine, a quaternary ammonium salt, is the basic active ingredient of a widely used traditional Chinese medicine Coptis Chinensis with antibacterial and anticonvulsant activities commonly used for the treatment of diseases such as bacillary dysentery, lobar pneumonia and pertussis. Particularly, berberine has been used in Chinese hospitals for the auxiliary treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) to reduce its mortality rate. Some analytical methods have been developed for the quantification of berber-ine. These methods include the use of liquid chromatography [14, 15] , capillary electrophoresis [16] , electrochemical analysis [17] [18] [19] , fluorophotometry [20] [21] [22] , chemiluminescence [23] . Among the fluorescence methods reported so far for berberine assay, the sensors or analytical methods designed were all based on quenching the fluorescence of the sensing reagent immobilized on membrane by berberine. Actually, berberine possesses its unique intrinsic fluorescence property as manifested in the use of berberine as a probe for fluorescence assay of DNA and RNA [24, 25] . It is very interesting to explore the potential of utilizing the intrinsic fluorescence property of berberine for its assay. Berberine only manifests very weak fluorescence property in aqueous solutions without addition of sensitizing agents such as DNA or RNA. Though the role of DNA or RNA in sensitizing the fluorescence of berberine has not been discussed in the literatures [24, 25] , it seems that DNA or RNA provides a protective microenvironment which would decrease the opportunity of berberine colliding with molecules existed in the bulk solution. In the search of an appropriate environment suitable for the intense enhancement of fluorescence intensity of berberine, we observed that the addition of \u2424-CD could enhance the fluorescence intensity of berberine in aqueous solutions more remarkably comparing with DNA or RNA. The possible reason is that \u2424-CD can provide a more protective hydrophobic microenvironment to accommodate berberine than DNA or RNA. The enhanced fluorescence sensitivity obtainable by the use of \u2424-CD is, unfortunately, still insufficient for designing a practically usable berberine assay methodology. To our knowledge, no fluorescent sensor for berberine based on its characteristic fluorescence enhancement was reported in the literature.",

It turned out that the fluorescence intensity of berberine in the membrane drastically enhanced which was obviously associated with the formation of an inclusion complex between HDB-\u2424-CD and berberine. This has been utilized as the basis of the preparation of berberine-sensitive fluorescent sensor. This paper reports the preparation and analytical performance characteristics of the proposed berberine-sensitive sensor. The sensor can be used for the determination of berberine with a linear range covering from 4.0 \u00d7 10 \u22127 to 2.0 \u00d7 10 \u22125 mol l \u22121 with a detection limit of 8.0 \u00d7 10 \u22128 mol l \u22121 . Also, the response mechanism of the optode membrane was investigated. Furthermore, molecular dynamics computation and computer simulation technique were combined to predict the steric configuration of the inclusion complex. An optimum conformation of inclusion complex was presented, which would serve as an aid for better understanding the recognition mechanism controlled by the simultaneous operation of several weak interactions and the factors governing inclusion phenomena of guest molecules by host CDs.

This is really the case when berberine reacts with \u2424-CD in aqueous phase (as shown in Fig. 5 ). On the organic membrane phase, the situation seems to be much more complicated. Apparently, from the fluorescence intensity curve recorded with HDB-\u2424-CD containing membrane phase after contacting with berberine solution of different pH for 30 min, with the increase of pH values, the fluorescence intensity of optode membrane increases and inclines to level off after pH 12.0.

The inclusion equilibrium of berberine and \u2424-CD in aqueous solution was a fast homogeneous reaction for a few minutes. While, The inclusion equilibrium of berberine in aqueous solution and HDB-\u2424-CD in membrane phase was a very slow heterogeneous reaction, since berberine in aqueous solution need to diffuse to permeate into organic membrane phase to contact with HDB-\u2424-CD.

The fluorescence enhancement can be interpreted as due to the formation of an inclusion complex between HDB-\u2424-CD and berberine. HDB-\u2424-CD possesses the hydrophobic cavity identical with that of \u2424-CD. Besides, as HDB-\u2424-CD was obtained by replacing the hydrogen atoms of the C-6-primary and C-2-secondary hydroxyl groups on parent \u2424-CD with butyl groups, this substantially increased the nonpolarity and hydrophobicity of the exterior shell surrounding the interior cavity of HDB-\u2424-CD. A much more hydrophobic and protective microenvironment for berberine was formulated shielding the excited state of berberine from water molecules and other species presented in bulk aqueous solution. An additional factor favorable for fluorescence enhancement is that the substitution of hydrogen atoms by butyl groups would cause the deformation of the cavity and decrease the degree of freedom in the motion of the berberine species entrapped in it. Moreover, the unsubstituted hydroxyl groups on HDB-\u2424-CD would deprotonate under strong alkaline conditions and an extra electrostatic force produced between HDB-\u2424-CD and berberine, which made berberine more accessible to HDB-\u2424-CD molecule and ready to enter into its cavity. Therefore, a better protection was obtained leading to a greater enhancement of the fluorescence intensity of berberine.",

The simulation was initiated at a starting geometry which was chosen as the location of berberine molecule outside the HDB-\u2424-CD cavity. The single point energy calculation was performed from the starting geometry. Then the coordinates for the atoms involved were changed with a step size of 2 \u00c5, and another single point energy calculation was performed to determine the energy of that new conformation. Following the next incremental change, the energy was again determined and the procedure continued covering the whole process when the berberine molecule move from the wide side of HDB-\u2424-CD to enter into the cavity till it went out from the narrow side. For \u2424-CD, the narrow side refers to the side of torus formed by the oligosaccharide ring where the primary hydroxyl groups of the glucose resides are located, while the wide side refers to the side where the secondary hydroxyl groups are located.

As can be seen from Fig. 7 , when the guest molecule berberine entered into the cavity from the wide side of HDB-\u2424-CD, the total energy of system dropped dramatically. One could imagine if the berberine molecule attempted to enter the cavity from the narrow side, it needed to overcome a huge energy barrier which practically forbade such a move. From the view of system stability, it was obviously favorable for berberine to enter into the cavity from the wide side of HDB-\u2424-CD. The stereoconformation of inclusion complex corresponding to the lowest energy of system is shown in Fig. 8 .",
