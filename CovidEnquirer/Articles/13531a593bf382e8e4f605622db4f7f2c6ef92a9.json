The PDE12 KO, AKAP7 KO, PDE12-AKAP7 DKO A549 cells were generated by using the CRISPR Cas9 system. The sgRNA sequences were chosen from a published database (2) . The guide RNA sequences were synthesized as DNA oligonucleotides by Integrated DNA Technologies. Primers were annealed, phosphorylated and ligated into the vector LentiCRISPR v2 (Addgene 52961, a gift from Feng Zhang) (3) that was prepared by digestion with BsmBI. The resulting plasmids were transformed into Stbl3 chemically competent E. coli (Invitrogen) and grown on a bacterial culture plate at 37 o C. Colonies were screened by PCR using the U6 primer and gene specific reverse primer to generate an approximately 300 bp product. Positive clones were cultured and plasmid DNA was prepared and sequence verified using the U6 primer. The AKAP7 sgRNA sequences are: sgAKAP7_2 FW CACCG TGAGC GACTG GCCAA AGCAA and sgAKAP7_2 REV AAACT TGCTT TGGCC AGTCG CTCA C. The PDE12 sgRNA sequences are: sgPDE12_10 FW CACCG GGATG CCTGG CAAGA CGGCG and sgPDE12_10 REV AAACC GCCGT CTTGC CAGGC ATCCC. Cell cloning was done by limited dilution. To obtain PDE12 and AKAP7 DKO cells, a PDE12 knockout A549 cell line was infected with pseudo lentivirus expressing sgRNA for AKAP7, followed by single cell cloning. Resulting clones were screened for knockout of expression by the Western method. Single OAS1,2,3 KO HME cell lines were reported by us previously (1) , and RNase L KO HME cells and HME DKO and TKO cell lines were made by CRISPR Cas9 gene editing as described (1) .",
