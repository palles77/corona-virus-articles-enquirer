We have identified a similar sequence in the N-terminal region of NS5A of hepaciviruses that was recently shown to form an amphipathic a-helix. The conservation of the N-terminal region in two apparently unrelated proteins of two different RNA virus families suggested that this helix might represent an independent module. To test this hypothesis, we constructed chimeric poliovirus (PV) genomes in which the sequence encoding the N-terminal 2C amphipathic helix was replaced by orthologous sequences from other picornaviral genomes or a similar sequence from NS5A of HCV. Effects of the mutations were assessed by measuring the accumulation of viable virus and viral RNA in HeLa cells after transfection, examining membrane morphology in cells expressing chimeric proteins and by in vitro analysis of RNA translation, protein processing and negative strand RNA synthesis in HeLa cell extracts. The chimeras manifested a wide range of growth and RNA synthesis phenotypes. The results are compatible with our hypothesis, although they demonstrate that helix exchangeability may be restricted due to requirements for interactions with other viral components involved in virus replication.

Indeed, different viruses utilize different organelle membranes (e.g., endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, endosomes, mitochondria) and generate different morphological structures on which the replication complexes assemble.",

In contrast, for hepatitis C virus (HCV), comprising a separate genus in the Flaviviridae family, the NS4B protein Konan et al., 2003) is able to trigger the induction of a structure termed ''membranous web'' which is the site of viral RNA replication and harbors all structural and non-structural proteins El-Hage and Luo, 2003; Mottola et al., 2002) . Determinants for the membrane association of HCV proteins (reviewed in Moradpour et al., 2003) include transmembrane hydrophobic segments (NS4B and NS5B) and an amphipathic helix (NS5A).",

Vesicles with an appearance indistinguishable from those associated with viral RNA replication complexes are generated in cells expressing all of the viral non-structural proteins (Teterina et al., 2001) ; and 2BC + 3A or 2BC alone can induce the formation of morphologically similar vesicles (Aldabe and Carrasco, 1995; Cho et al., 1994; Suhy et al., 2000) .

Based on results of bioinformatics analysis, it was suggested that 2C is composed of three structural domains that may accommodate multiple activities (Teterina et al., 1997b) . The central domain is highly conserved among picornaviruses and other small RNA and DNA viruses. It contains nucleoside triphosphate-binding and helicase motifs (Gorbalenya et al., 1990) , and ATPase activity was demonstrated for purified recombinant 2C protein (Pfister and Wimmer, 1999) . RNA binding activity has been mapped to both the amino-and carboxy-terminal regions of the protein (Rodriguez and Carrasco, 1995) . Although the separately expressed C-terminal portion of 2C was able to interact with membranes (Teterina et al., 1997a) , the major membranetargeting determinant of 2C has been attributed to the aminoterminal region (Echeverri and Dasgupta, 1995; Echeverri et al., 1998; Teterina et al., 1997b) . This region was predicted to form an amphipathic helix (Paul et al., 1994) which was proposed to be responsible for its membrane binding property.",

Exchange of both non-coding and coding regions among picornaviral genomes has been performed, generating both viable and non-viable chimeras. For example, internal ribosome entry sites (IRESes) can be readily transferred, en bloc, from one picornavirus to another and even among viruses that belong to different virus families (Alexander et al., 1994; Gromeier et al., 1996; Jia et al., 1996; Johnson and Semler, 1988; Lu and Wimmer, 1996; Zhao et al., 1999 Zhao et al., , 2000 . Exchanges of the 5Vend cloverleaf structure or the 3V non-coding regions also have produced viable viruses (Rohll et al., 1995; Xiang et al., 1995) . A hydrophobic domain within polypeptide 3AB of PV was interchangeable with the orthologous sequences from human rhinovirus 14 (HRV14) (Towner et al., 2003) , although some domain substitutions caused RNA replication defects. Replacement of PV 3CD sequences with those from another enterovirus, coxsackie virus B3 (CVB3), produced a replication competent, albeit temperature-sensitive virus; however, replacement of only 3D coding sequences (Bell et al., 1999) or subdomains of 3D (Cornell et al., 2004) was lethal. Studies of chimeric CVB3 viruses containing PV 2B or segments of 2B suggested that the hydrophobic domains present in the C-terminal two-thirds of the protein contain residues involved in virus-specific protein contacts required for viral RNA replication (van Kuppeveld et al., 1997b) .",

Although its three-dimensional structure has not been resolved, it was predicted to be a three-domain protein (Kusov et al., 1998; Teterina et al., 1997b) with amphipathic a-helices at both the N-and C-termini that mediate a peripheral association with membranes (Kusov et al., 1998; Paul et al., 1994; Teterina et al., 1997b) . We performed a BLAST engine search for other proteins with similarities to the N-terminal portion of PV 2C, and identified the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A protein, with scores comparable to those of the cardio-or aphthovirus 2C homologs (Fig. 1A , data not shown.). Recently, this HCV sequence was proven to be an amphipathic helix that mediates membrane association of NS5A (Brass et al., 2002; Penin et al., 2004) . The similarities between NS5A and 2C extend slightly downstream of the a-helix to include three amino acids that may be part of a junction region (not shown). The N-terminal border of the conservation between NS5A and 2C is less well defined but it coincides with the predicted N-terminus of the 2C helix and is five residues downstream from the established N-terminus of the NS5A a-helix (Fig. 1A) . Although comparably positioned in all proteins, the most conserved 18 amino acid region of the a-helix is separated from the protein's N-terminus by 16 to 18 residues in picornaviruses and eight residues in HCV (Fig. 1A ). Fig. 1B shows the amphipathic helix represented as a ''helical wheel''. As was initially observed by Paul et al. (1994) , the pattern of distribution of hydrophobic and charged amino acids in the helix is well conserved. Among the residues of the predicted hydrophobic face are two absolutely conserved Trp residues that are separated by 11 amino acids in the primary structure. The sequence from HCV protein NS5A has the hydrophobic pattern characteristic of the 2C a-helix, including the two invariant Trp residues. The similarities between the NS5A and 2C wheels lend strong support to the prediction that the N-terminus of picornaviral 2C proteins does form an amphipathic helix.",

These silent mutations had no effect on PV growth and replication in HeLa cells (see below). Fig. 2A shows a schematic map of the constructs used in these experiments and the aligned sequences of the homologous predicted amphipathic helices from the various viruses used to generate chimeric 2C sequences in the Mahoney strain of poliovirus type 1 cDNA. The sequence from human enterovirus 71 (hEV71) is only slightly diverged from that of PV1 (2 amino acids, N23T and I29M), whereas coxsackie A virus 18 (CAV 18) has 5 differences among the 18 that comprise the core of the predicted helix. Both of those viruses are classified as enteroviruses, in the same genus as poliovirus.

Total RNA from transfected cells was isolated at different times post-transfection and the accumulation of positive-strand PV RNA was measured by a one-cycle RNase protection assay (Figs. 3A -B). Accumulation of increasing amounts of positive strand RNA for PVxx was readily detectable by 7.5 h posttransfection and continued with kinetics indistinguishable from that observed with wild-type PV1 RNA transcript (not shown). In good correlation with the observed plaque phenotype, replication of PV-2Cah-hEV71 and PV-2Cah-CAV18 RNA was very similar to that of PVxx RNA. A slight delay in replication of the chimera encoding the CAV18 amphipathic helix in 2C was reproduced in two independent experiments. During the first 12.5 h after transfection, chimeric genome PV-2Cah-HRV14 accumulated with significantly slower kinetics than did that of PVxx, confirming that the small plaque phenotype of virus produced by this genome results from inefficient RNA synthesis. However, when accumulation of this chimeric virus-specific RNA was followed longer (Figs. 3C -D), we observed a significant increase in positive strand RNA between 12 and 23 h post-transfection. The slight decrease in the amount of control PVxx RNA at 23 h compared with what was detected at 12.5 h was likely due to a loss of cells following cytopathic effects observed for PVxx around 20 h post-transfection. No RNA replication was detected in cells transfected with PV-2Cah-FMDV (Figs. 3A -B) or with PV-2Cah-EMCV or PV-2Cah-HCV (data not shown).",

In addition, measurement of negative-strand RNAs synthesized following the amplification of plus strand RNA would show a reduced yield of negative strands even if the only defect was in plus strand synthesis, thus complicating interpretation of the results. Because of these considerations, we examined negative strand synthesis in vitro, using T7 RNA transcripts to program the translation/replication reaction in extracts prepared from HeLa cells (Barton and Flanegan, 1993; Molla et al., 1991) . These RNA transcripts contained two non-PV guanylate residues at the 5V terminus, which have been shown previously to inhibit synthesis of positive, but not negative strand RNA (Barton et al., 1999; Herold and Andino, 2000; Teterina et al., 2003) . Fig. 4 shows similar albeit slightly decreased levels of RNA synthesized in reactions programmed with chimeric genomes encoding 2Cah-hEV71, 2Cah-CAV18 and 2Cah-HRV14. However, no negative strand RNA was produced in reactions programmed with RNAs encoding 2Cah-FMDV, 2Cah-EMCV or 2Cah-HCV. Thus, it appears that all substitutions of the amphipathic helix in protein 2C that support negative strand RNA synthesis in vitro, also support positive strand RNA synthesis in vivo. It remains unknown whether substitution of the amphipathic helix in protein 2C causes a differential effect on positive vs. negative strand synthesis.",

A subtle effect of the 2C substitution on P3 processing, indicated by increased production of 3BCD protein, was detected in the viable chimeras: for wild-type PV, 3BCD is a minor band; a slightly increased accumulation of this protein was seen in the products of translation of PV-2Cah-hEV71 and PV-2Cah-HRV14 chimeras, whereas in the PV-2Cah-CAV18 chimera, this band was absent.

These mutants produced increased amounts of P2 and 2BC, but little 2C. From the P3 region, there was an increase in 3BCD; the 3C band was significantly reduced and 3AB was virtually undetectable. An unidentified band migrating slightly more slowly than 2A was also detected. A longer exposure of the gel revealed low amounts of a doublet band migrating near the position of 3AB, perhaps indicating an alternative cleavage product (Fig. 5, bottom) .

The predicted N-terminal amphipathic helix in 2C is a major determinant of membrane binding, which is likely essential for induction of membrane reorganization. Membrane rearrangements appear to be essential for formation of the RNA replication complexes that carry out viral RNA synthesis. To gain some insight regarding the specificity of the amphipathic helix sequences in the 2C protein, we attempted to analyze the intracellular membrane morphology in HeLa cells expressing PV proteins from the chimeric 2C constructs. To ensure comparable levels of protein expression from replicating and non-replicating genomes, we transiently expressed all PV nonstructural proteins using recombinant vaccinia virus vTF7-3. This expression system generates viral proteins from mRNA transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase, independently of viral RNA replication, in the infected/transfected cells. We have shown previously that the overall cell morphology as well as the appearance of induced membrane vesicles is indistinguishable from that seen in PV-infected cells (Teterina et al., 2001) . To this end, we placed sequences encoding chimeric 2C proteins in the background of plasmid pE5PVDP1 (Teterina et al., 2001) , which contains cDNA encoding all PV nonstructural proteins (P2 and P3 regions) downstream of the EMCV IRES. RNA transcripts from each chimeric plasmid were first translated in HeLa cell extracts to analyze protein production and processing. As was the case for chimeras in full-length PV genomes, all mutant RNAs directed synthesis of products expected from the intact open reading frame of the polyprotein. The same defects of protein processing were observed for E5PVDP1 RNAs encoding chimeric 2C amphipathic helices as were observed with full-length genomes (data not shown; refer to Fig. 5) .",

Examination of the intracellular membrane morphologies after 7.5 h of transfection was performed by electron microscopy (Fig. 6) . As reported previously (Teterina et al., 2001) , numerous clusters of vesicles characteristic of those induced by PV infection were observed in cells transfected with pE5PVDP1 (expressing a complete set of P2 and P3 proteins), and in cells transfected with pE5PVxxDP1 (Fig. 6, panel A) . The appearance of vesicles in cells transfected with the pE5PVxxDP1 parental plasmid encoding chimeric 2C proteins containing the amphipathic helix from hEV71 or CAV18 was also indistinguishable from pE5PVxxDP1 containing wildtype PV sequences (Figs. 6B and C) . In cells transfected with the same parental plasmid expressing the HRV14 chimeric 2C protein, however, vesicles were more dispersed, present only in very small clusters and were often smaller (Fig. 6D ). Many vesicles displayed double membranes. There was a large variation in the appearance of vesicles in sections from different individual cells. Expression from the plasmids containing the FMDV, EMCV and HCV chimeric 2C proteins resulted in some membrane alterations including formation of loosely associated vesicles ( Fig. 6E and not shown) . The vesicles, however, were not typical for PV in array, size, structure or overall aspect and thus did not display the characteristic appearance of polio-induced vesicles. Thus, morphological aspects of the membrane alterations induced by PV proteins containing amphipathic helical sequences from FMDV or EMCV 2C proteins or from HCV NS5A protein were strikingly different from those formed by proteins from the chimeric viruses that were viable, suggesting that the former chimeric proteins displayed aberrant membrane interactions.",

To distinguish whether individual chimeric proteins were unable to associate with membranes or to function in a critical reaction, cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the individual 2C or 2BC wild-type or FMDV-chimeric proteins, and their membrane associations and induced rearrangements were observed by electron microscopy. Consistent with our previous reports, expression of PV 2C protein alone induced formation of swirled membranes (data not shown), while 2BC induced vesicles (Fig. 7A ). Cells transfected with plasmids encoding chimeric 2C or 2BC containing the amphipathic helix from the N-terminal portion of FMDV 2C, showed the same morphological changes as those transfected with the corresponding wt protein (Fig. 7B and data not shown) suggesting that the chimeric 2C and 2BC proteins have similar membrane reorganization properties as wild-type.

            "text": "Polioviruses in which the N-terminal amphipathic helix of protein 2C had been replaced with the corresponding region from HRV14 were able to replicate, albeit very poorly. However, transfection of HeLa cells with PV-2Cah-HRV14 gave rise to plaques of heterogeneous size; and accumulation of viral RNA in transfected cells was extremely slow during early rounds of replication, but showed marked increases at later times (Fig. 3) . Such phenotype usually indicates that the original viral genome supports a low level of replication, and that some spontaneous mutation(s) that improved virus growth were selected during virus amplification. To identify these mutations, HeLa cells were transfected with PV-2Cah-HRV14 RNA transcripts and overlaid with semisolid medium. At 72 h after transfection, 10 individual plaques of relatively large size were selected for further analysis. Viruses recovered from each plaque were used to generate passage 1 (P1) virus stocks. Although only well isolated plaques were picked to produce virus stocks, many of these stocks still displayed mixed plaque size phenotypes (data not shown). HeLa cell monolayers were infected with P1 virus stock and total RNA was isolated 4.5 -5 h post-infection, when the onset of CPE was visible for all virus isolates. Viral RNA recovered from the infected cells was sequenced within the 2C coding region using RT-PCR followed by direct sequencing of the cDNA fragments. Among 10 P1 stock virus isolates, only one showed mutation in the region encoding the 2C protein (Table 1 ; PV-2Cah-HRV14-R1). This virus had undergone a single nucleotide transversion (A4207-C) resulting in the reversion of HRV14-specific leucine at position 28 of 2C to the PV-specific phenylalanine. EM analysis of cells infected with PV-2Cah-HRV14-R1 revealed that this virus induced in cells morphological changes indistinguishable from those observed with wt PV (data not shown). The other nine P1 stocks generated virus with the same nucleotide sequence within the entire 2C coding region that was present in the HRV14 2C amphipathic helix chimera initially used for transfection. Each of these P1 virus stocks was passaged twice more in HeLa cells and subjected to additional rounds of plaque purification from which 2 -4 plaques were selected for generation of passage 3 (P3) virus stocks. The nucleotide sequence of the region encoding protein 2C was determined for 30 individual P3 virus stocks. Four viruses generated from two different P1 stocks contained single nucleotide mutations either A4207C or A4207T that generated the same 2C-L28F substitution (designated R1 in Table 1 ) as described above. Additionally, one virus (PV-2Cah-HRV14-R2) acquired mutation T4206C that produced an alternative substitution of Leu 28 by Ser. One pair of P3 virus isolates (progeny of the same P1 virus) possessed a single point mutation G4187T that encodes reversion of HRV14-specific 2C-Ala-22 to Ser, present in PV 2C (R3). Thus, despite a difference of seven out of 18 amino acids in the core sequence of the amphipathic helix between HRV14 and PV 2C proteins, reversion of only a single amino acid residue at either of two different positions in the helix (L28F and A22S) was sufficient to improve the ''fit'' of the rhinovirus chimeric 2C protein in the PV genome.",

This deleterious Leu substitution for Phe is generally considered a rather conservative change that may not affect the overall presentation of the hydrophobic surface of the proposed amphipathic helix. This suggests that the aromatic ring of the Phe residue in this position might be important for some specific interactions of protein 2C (or 2BC). Indeed, when we constructed the single 2C-F28L mutation in the PVxx genome, transfection of HeLa cells with PVxx-2C-F28L RNA yielded plaques of minute size (Fig. 8) , indicating that Phe28 of 2C plays an important role in some aspect of virus growth. In view of this important role of residue Phe28 in the amphipathic helix of 2C, we attempted to see whether substitution of the PV-specific Phe28 residue for the Ile at the corresponding position in the FMDV amphipathic helix would be sufficient to rescue the replication of PV-2Cah-FMDV.

To confirm that each of these mutations is sufficient to compensate for the poor growth of PV-2Cah-HRV14, we introduced these mutations by sitedirected mutagenesis into the PV-2Cah-HRV14 chimeric genome and in the parental PVxx genome. Neither of these mutations had any effect on the growth of PVxx virus after transfection of HeLa cells with RNA transcripts. However, each of these mutations resulted in significant increases in plaque size compared with those produced by PV-2Cah-HRV14 RNA after transfection ( Table 2) . The K49R mutation, just downstream of the amphipathic helix region, restored plaques to almost the same size as PVxx RNA, as did the S318T mutant near the C-terminus of 2C.

The fact that not every chimera proved to be viable might be (partially) attributed to the somewhat arbitrary selection of the borders of sequences selected for substitution.

            "text": "Interestingly, although the amino acid sequence in the amphipathic helix of HRV 14 differs from that in PV at seven positions, only two of those residues, amino acids 22 and 28, differ from those present in the CAV18 sequence, which generated a chimera that replicated almost as well as wild-type PV. The importance of amino acids 22 and 28 of protein 2C is further supported by the analysis of faster growing viruses isolated after passage of PV2Cah-HRV14: the most frequently acquired mutations changed amino acid 28 of 2C, and another rapidly growing revertant virus substituted amino acid 22 with the one normally present in PV. Although we have not sequenced the entire genomes of these virus isolates, reconstruction of these single point mutations encoding changes of amino acid 22 or 28 in the PV-2Cah-HRV14 genome was sufficient to produce virus with significantly improved growth. In addition, when a single point mutation that substituted Phe28 in PV 2C with the HRV-14-specific Leu was introduced in the wild-type PV genome, a marked RNA replication defect resulted. These data imply that amino acid residues 22 and 28 play a critical role in functionally important interactions of the amphipathic helix with other (protein and/or RNA) partners. Both these residues are predicted to be located close to the membrane surface (Fig. 1B) that may be essential for these interactions. Amino acids at other positions of the helix may also exert control over PV replication, as the PV-2Cah-HCV chimera that contains Phe at the 28 position and Cys (physicochemically most similar to Ser) at the 22 position failed to replicate. In addition, introduction of Phe28 in the amphipathic helix from FMDV in PV-2Cah-FMDV did not rescue this chimera.",

Neither negative-nor positive-strand RNA synthesis could be detected in cells transfected with these chimeric RNAs or in extracts translating and replicating viral RNAs. Analysis of the translation products revealed polyprotein processing defects in the P2 and P3 regions: the most prominent was abnormal accumulation of P2, 2BC and 3BCD precursors, with nearly complete absence of 2C and 3AB. It is possible that abnormal polyprotein proteolytic processing is the primary defect responsible for the dead phenotype of these chimeras. We are currently unable to uncouple polyprotein processing from the formation of active replication complexes to verify this interpretation.",

            "text": "It is surprising that rather conservative substitutions in the 2C protein located quite far from the cleavage site between 2B and 2C affect the processing at this site and even more significantly at distant sites in the P3 region. Similar defects in polyprotein processing were reported by Paul et al. (1994) for mutations in the 2C helix that changed the predicted amphipathic character of the helix. Interestingly, some previously reported mutations in PV protein 3AB (Giachetti et al., 1992) and substitutions in the hydrophobic domain of 3AB protein by corresponding sequences from HRV14 (Towner et al., 2003) also caused defective polyprotein processing with increased production of unprocessed P2 and 3BCD proteins. It was suggested previously (Lawson and Semler, 1992) that PV utilizes two processing cascades in the production of viral proteins. One is rapid, occurs in the membrane-bound fraction and is thought to operate in cis; the second is a slower, transcleavage pathway observed in the soluble fraction. It is not known how these pathways are regulated during the course of infection. Our results indicate that the N-terminal helix of 2C is an essential part of the network of interactions that determine polyprotein processing.",

The amphipathic helical element presumably serves as a determinant of membrane binding for 2Ccontaining proteins that are part of the replication machinery in PV. We examined the effects of the N-terminal amphipathic helical substitutions on the morphology of the induced membrane structures that form in the cytoplasm of the infected host cell. The appearance of the replication complex-associated vesicles formed by proteins including hEV71 or CAV18 chimeric 2C proteins was indistinguishable from those formed by wt PV proteins, as visualized by electron microscopy. Viruses containing HRV14 chimeric 2C proteins, which grew poorly, induced vesicles that appeared different in several aspects. The chimeras with FMDV, EMCV or HCV NS5A amphipathic helix substitutions failed to show any RNA replication at all, and, accordingly, produced no typical vesicle clusters. Expression of individual chimeric 2C or 2BC proteins containing the FMDV helix, however, induced membrane alterations that appeared indistinguishable from the corresponding wild-type PV proteins. Thus, the observed defects in membrane biogenesis by chimeras may be linked to the altered relative amounts of protein precursors and products resulting from polyprotein processing changes rather than to the effects of the alien helix on the 2C or 2BC proteins per se.",

Apparently, they did not interfere with subcellular localization and membrane association of this protein, suggesting that the N-terminal helix performs some additional functions or participates in molecular interactions other than membrane anchoring. The results of our experiments imply that the PV 2C N-terminal amphipathic helix may also contribute to functions other than membrane anchoring. On the other hand, the N-terminal region of nodavirus Flock House Virus (FHV) protein A, which normally targets the protein to mitochondrial membranes (Miller et al., 2001) , can be readily substituted by viral or cellular ER-targeting sequences without affecting the ability of the virus to replicate. Thus, details of the assembly, higher-order interactions and architectural determinants of the replication complexes may differ dramatically in different RNA viruses.",
