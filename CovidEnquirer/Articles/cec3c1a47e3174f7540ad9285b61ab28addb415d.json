            "text": "Background: Internet access and usage has changed how people seek and report health information. Meanwhile,infectious diseases continue to threaten humanity. The analysis of Big Data, or vast digital data, presents an opportunity to improve disease surveillance and epidemic intelligence. Epidemic intelligence contains two components: indicator based and event-based. A relatively new surveillance type has emerged called event-based Internet biosurveillance systems. These systems use information on events impacting health from Internet sources, such as social media or news aggregates. These systems circumvent the limitations of traditional reporting systems by being inexpensive, transparent, and flexible. Yet, innovations and the functionality of these systems can change rapidly. Aim: To update the current state of knowledge on event-based Internet biosurveillance systems by identifying all systems, including current functionality, with hopes to aid decision makers with whether to incorporate new methods into comprehensive programmes of surveillance. Methods: A systematic review was performed through PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases, while also including grey literature and other publication types. Results: 50 event-based Internet systems were identified, including an extraction of 15 attributes for each system, described in 99 articles. Each system uses different innovative technology and data sources to gather data, process, and disseminate data to detect infectious disease outbreaks. Conclusions: The review emphasises the importance of using both formal and informal sources for timely and accurate infectious disease outbreak surveillance, cataloguing all event-based Internet biosurveillance systems. By doing so, future researchers will be able to use this review as a library for referencing systems, with hopes of learning, building, and expanding Internet-based surveillance systems. Eventbased Internet biosurveillance should act as an extension of traditional systems, to be utilised as an additional, supplemental data source to have a more comprehensive estimate of disease burden.",

Epidemic intelligence incorporates two components: an indicator-based component and an event-based component [7] . The indicator-based component refers to structured (or formal) data collected through routine surveillance systems, such as the number or rates of cases based on standard case definitions, and the computation of indicators upon which abnormal disease patterns to investigate are detected [7, 8] . The goal of indicator-based surveillance is to find increased numbers or clusters at a specific time, period, and/or location that may indicate a threat [9] . Statistical methods set against thresholds of increased cases or clusters are essential to determining potential health effects [9] . In some cases, non-specific syndromes are monitored as markers for specific diseases, termed 'syndromic surveillance'.",

Automatic systems further advance systems like news aggregators by adding a series of steps of analysis [9] . Non-moderated systems can search the web and display new articles without time delay in an unbiased manner than moderated systems [16] . Often, the data is not structured or collated, and therefore epidemiologists must spend more time and energy determining their relevance to a specific situation of interest [9] . Moderated systems rely on some component of human input or analysis, either solely, or after data is first processed automatically [9] . Moderated systems offer a chance of screening for relevance by public health practitioners before it is disseminated [9] . Thereby, moderated systems might show less irrelevant news items, fewer false positives than the non-moderated systems, but are subject to moderator bias [16] . Systems without human moderation often focus on data sources that already have been validated and, therefore, do not help aid those interested in the early warning and alert potential for unknown or new outbreaks or diseases [9] .",

Governments are no longer in sole control of their public health information, making it substantially harder to hide or delay outbreak or event reports [14, 20] . However, the same aspects of event-based Internet biosurveillance systems that make them an important new surveillance tool also may makes them a less reliable tool [14] . Since public health professionals do not verify some sources of data, these systems are prone to noise and false alarms [14, 21] . Further, there is difficulty differentiating signal from noise. Sometimes, they lack specificity and results from these systems differ from official sources [14, 21] .",

The scope of the study excluded bioterrorism and animal related systems, so potential relevant systems may have been neglected or not included.

Further, there is a possibility of systems existing outside of academic literature or search engine realms, such as those developed by military or closed environments. Additionally, there is inconsistent application of the term 'surveillance' here and throughout the literature. Some system information provided suggests that the system is a monitoring system rather than a surveillance system, and many articles did not contain enough information to correctly distinguish between the two, reflecting a lack of overall surveillance theory in public health. Further, as this review was limited to articles in English, the results may be biased towards including systems from English-speaking areas.",
