ImmunopathoL, A study is described of the clinical and pathological findings in 20 specific pathogen free cats infected when 1 year old with feline immunodeficiency virus and monitored over 12 months. Cats were divided into two groups (A and B). The clinical and clinicopathological features were studied in Group A. In Group B, at 1, 2, 4, 9 and 12 months post infection two cats were necropsied. Clinically all cats developed generalised lymphadenopathy, six cats were neutropenic and five cats lymphopenic. Three cats became febrile with conjunctivitis and anterior uveitis and one of these cats ultimately developed jaundice. Postmortem examinations confirmed a generalised lymphadenopathy involving peripheral and visceral lymph nodes with concurrent stimulation of splenic white matter and mucosal lymphoid tissue of the digestive tract and conjuncfiva. Within the lymph nodes there was a reactive follicular hyperplasia accompanied by a paracortical hyperplasia with an increased paracortical vascularity. Unusual features were the presence of lymphoid follicles in the bone marrow, thymus and parathyroid tissue. In addition, aggregates of lymphoid cells were found within salivary glands, kidneys, sclera and choroid of the eye. One cat developed a lymphosarcoma affecting the liver and kidneys at 36 weeks post infection. The cat with jaundice had a cholangitis with marked biliary epithelial hyperplasia.",

Cats that were noted to be abnormal (febrile or dull) were examined daily, and ampicillin (Ampifen; Mycofarm, Cambridge, UK) was administered to cats with temperatures greater than 40 \u00b0 C. Blood samples were obtained to determine haematological and blood biochemical profiles initially biweekly to 4 months and then monthly for 8 months. Blood was obtained by jugular venepuncture into potassium EDTA and lithium heparin. Total circulating leucocyte values were determined using a Roche ABX automatic haematology analyser (Roche, Welwyn Garden City, UK) Coulter counter and the differential count for each sample was calculated from a standard 200 cell count performed on a smear stained by the May-Grunwald-Giemsa method. The absolute numbers of neutrophils and lymphocytes were calculated from the total leucocyte counts and differential counts. Total circulating leucocyte values, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts from control animals at each sampling were used as normal ranges. Using a dry chemistry analyser (Vetest 8008) values were obtained for urea, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, albumin, globulin, cholesterol and triglycerides. Direct bilirubin levels were determined by Jendrassilk/Grof reaction (Bilirubin test, Roche, Welwyn Garden City, UK). Cats were weighed at various intervals.",

In both experiments mortalities were recorded but with such diverse pathological findings that a common link to FIV was not clear. Yamamoto et al.
