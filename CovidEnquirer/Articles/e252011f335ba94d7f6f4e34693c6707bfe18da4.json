            "text": "Background: The main symptoms of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) are nasal rhinorrhea or blockage and moist-sounding cough. Diagnosis can be difficult and is based on an abnormal ciliary beat frequency, accompanied by specific abnormalities of the ciliary axoneme. It is unknown whether determining ciliary beat pattern related to specific ultrastructural ciliary defects might help in the diagnosis of PCD. Objective: We sought to determine ciliary beat pattern and beat frequency (CBF) associated with the 5 common ultrastructural defects responsible for PCD. Methods: Nasal brushings were performed on 56 children with PCD. Ciliary movement was recorded using digital high-speed video imaging to assess beat frequency and pattern. Electron microscopy was performed. Results: In patients with an isolated outer dynein arm or with an outer and inner dynein arm defect, 55% and 80% of cilia were immotile, respectively. Cilia that moved were only flickering. Mean CBF (\u00b1 95% CI) was 2.3 Hz (\u00b1 1.2) and 0.8 Hz (\u00b1 0.8), respectively. Cilia with an isolated inner dynein arm or a radial spoke defect had similar beat patterns. Cilia appeared stiff, had a reduced amplitude, and failed to bend along their length. Immotile cilia were present in 10% of cilia with an inner dynein arm defect and in 30% of radial spoke defects. Mean CBF was 9.3 Hz (\u00b1 2.6) and 6.0 Hz (\u00b1 3.1), respectively. The ciliary transposition defect produced a large circular beat pattern (mean CBF, 10.7 Hz [\u00b1 1.1]). No cilia were immotile. Conclusions: Different ultrastructural defects responsible for PCD result in predictable beat patterns. Recognition of these might help in the diagnostic evaluation of patients suspected of having PCD. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2003;112:518-24.)",

Despite persistent symptoms, and often attendance at ear, nose, and throat and respiratory clinics, many patients with PCD are not diagnosed until later in life, 1 by which time permanent lung damage has occurred. 2 Approximately 50% of patients with PCD have situs inversus. [3] [4] [5] Early and accurate diagnosis is important, because once made, lung function can be maintained with specialist respiratory care. 2, 6 Failure to recognize the condition might also lead to inappropriate ear, nose, and throat surgery, leaving persistent aural discharge with little improvement in hearing loss. 3, 7, 8 The diagnosis of PCD is traditionally made on the basis of a supportive clinical history and an abnormal ciliary beat frequency (CBF), accompanied in most cases by specific abnormalities of the ciliary axoneme on transmission electron microscopy (TEM). [3] [4] [5] The most commonly used techniques (the modified photodiode 9 or photomultiplier method 10 ) to measure CBF use an indirect method and do not provide information on ciliary beat pattern.",

Cilia simply beat in a forward and backward planar motion without a sideways recovery sweep. 11 DHSV analysis has also proved useful in determining the effect of viral infection on the movement of respiratory cilia. After a coronavirus infection, CBF of nasal respiratory cilia was found to remain within the normal range. However, slow-motion analysis revealed a large number of dyskinetic cilia. 13 This would have been missed by the conventional methods that rely solely on CBF measurement.",

Radial spokes are thought to resist the sliding of the microtubules and cause the cilium to bend. 19, 28 Although the cilium failed to bend in the combined radial spoke and inner dynein arm defect, it was also observed in the inner dynein arm defect alone. Little information is available on the action of the central microtubular pair. It has been postulated that the central pair might rotate during active ciliary bending. 28 It would seem that the central pair allows the cilium to beat in a forward and backward planar motion. Absence of the central pair for the short distance seen in patients with ciliary transposition seems to allow the cilia to rotate around this section.",
