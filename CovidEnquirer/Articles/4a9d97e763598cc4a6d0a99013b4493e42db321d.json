            "text": "The first issue of the International Journal of Nursing Studies (IJNS) was published in December 1963. The world was very different. The 'cold war' was at its height and Europe was divided between East and West, symbolised by the division of Berlin by the ''wall '' which had been erected in 1961. In that year President Kennedy was assassinated and two days later his alleged killer, Lee Harvey Oswald, was murdered by nightclub owner Jack Ruby. Lyndon Johnson became US President and the number of US military 'advisors' in Vietnam reached 15,000. British politics was rocked by the Profumo scandal, in which the Secretary of War was found to be having an affair with Christine Keeler who was, in turn involved with the Soviet Naval Attach\u00e9 . On the other side of the world there was the first federal election for Indigenous people in Western Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory; indigenous voting rights in other states had been in place since 1949. In China Mao Zedong launched the Socialist Education Movement following the failure of the Great Leap Forward, setting the stage for the Cultural Revolution that was to follow. In South America, Ernesto 'Che' Guevara continued to preach the role of armed revolution after being active in several armed revolutions, including the one which established Cuba's communist government.",

Big steps have also been made to eradicate poliomyelitis which remains endemic in only four countries (India, Nigeria, Afghanistan and Pakistan) and dracunculiasis (guinea worm disease) which is now restricted to only five countries (Chad, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali and Sudan) (De Cock, 2011) . Since 1963 a host of new transmissible diseases have been described including HIV, haemorrhagic fevers such as the Hanta Virus, and airborne-transmitted infections like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Well known diseases like TB, that seemed to have been consigned to history in the developed world have remerged as global public health problems as drugresistance has developed. Many health initiatives have been launched, influential reports published and philanthropic organisations founded which have realigned the focus of health initiatives.",

Indeed the first ever paper published in the IJNS was by Patricia O'Connell (1963) a Health Visitor Tutor based at the University of Southampton, UK who made the case for the educated nurse and the merits of university based nurse education. It was not until almost 30 years later, following the Project 2000 (1986) initiative, that university based education became the norm for British nurses with the minimum qualification set at Diploma (associate degree) level. A university degree as the minimum qualification for British nurses will be introduced in 2013 -a fact which colleagues based outside the UK often find astounding, a whole 50 years following publication of O'Connell's paper. The progress towards graduate entry nurses in the UK contrasts sharply with bold steps by some other European countries, Australia, China and elsewhere to drive forward the development of professional nursing and midwifery through education.",

Two highly cited studies, one in the UK (Bryar et al., 2003) and one in Australia (Retsas and Nolan, 1999) , investigated the barriers faced by nurses applying research in their practice. Both studies called for fundamental changes within the education system to improve the teaching of critical appraisal and research skills and changes to the organisation of nursing work to provide nurses with the time and support needed to apply research findings to practice. It is disappointing to note that a recent Swedish study shows that nursing students still have only a 'modest' intention to use research evidence in practice (Forsman et al., 2012) . What good is published research if the findings are not implemented for the benefit of patients? As part of our 50th Anniversary celebrations we will publish a Special Issue on Implementation Science guest edited by Theo van Achterberg (Radboud University Nijmegen) and Anne Sales (VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, USA), which will inform the systematic uptake of clinical research findings and other evidence-based practices into routine practice.",

A second IJNS Special Issue, released as part of our 50th Anniversary celebrations, guest edited by Linda Aiken (University of Pennsylvania, USA) and Koen Van den Heede (Belgian Healthcare Knowledge Centre), brings together findings from a major EU funded nursing workforce study (RN4Cast), which seeks to establish how hospital nurse staffing, skill mix, educational composition, and quality of the nurse work environment impact hospital mortality, failure to rescue, quality of care, and patient satisfaction.",

Child death rates tumbled by around 45% between 1970 and 2002 and a further 52% between 1970 and 2010 but this trend is patchy; today 33% of deaths of children <5 years of age now occur in southwest Asia and 50% in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in west Africa (De Cock, 2011) . At the start of the 21st Century three health related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs 4, 5 and 6) were identified relating to child health, maternal health and HIV, TB and malaria. MDG 5 calls for a 75% reduction in global maternity mortality ratio from 1990 to 2015, and universal access to services such as family planning. On current estimates neither of these objectives are likely to be achieved within the timescale. As part of the IJNS 50th Anniversary celebrations we recognise the crucial importance of child health through publication of an IJNS Child Health Special Issue guest edited by Linda Franck (University of California, San Francisco, USA) and Sanna Salanter\u00e4 (University of Turku, Finland).",

Almost 40 years ago Gerson's (1975) study established the incidence of pressure ulcers in a sample of 5648 patients in three Canadian hospitals and found that older patients, long stay patients and those with neoplastic disease, diseases of the circulatory system and those who had accidents were over-represented in the pressure ulcer group. More recent studies have investigated the causes of pressure ulcers; for example the relationship between friction and pressure and pressure ulcers , the relationship between weight and pressure ulcers and factors related to the development of pressure ulcers in recipients of home care services (Tsai et al., 2011) . Other studies have investigated how pressure sores can be prevented; for example, Defloor et al.'s (2005) study of the impact of turning and pressure relieving devices in reducing the incidence of pressure ulcers (see also Beeckman et al., 2011 evaluation of the impact of an electronic clinical decision support system on pressure ulcer prevention and several studies of the contribution of pressure relieving support services (McInnes et al., 2012a,b; Demarr\u00e9 et al., 2012) . And we have also published studies which have investigated how pressure ulcers can be measured and assessed; for example, Kottner et al.'s (2012) systematic review of paediatric pressure ulcer risk assessment scales. But such examples are, in truth, few and far between. We hope to see more of their like in the future.",
