Using immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy, the COOHterminal cytoplasmic domain of TGN38 was found to be sufficient for localization of the chimeric proteins to the TGN. Deletion analysis identified an l 1-amino acid segment containing the critical sequence, YQRL, as being sufficient for TGN localization. TGN localization was abrogated by mutation of the tyrosine or leu-cine residues in this sequence to alanine, or of the arginine residue to aspartate. In addition to specifying TGN localization, the ll-amino acid segment was active as an internalization signal, although the property of internalization alone was insufficient to confer TGN localization. Overexpression of chimeric proteins containing TGN localization determinants resulted in their detection at the plasma membrane and in intracellular vesicles, and abolished detection of endogenous TGN38. These results suggest that discrete cytoplasmic determinants can mediate protein localization to the TGN, and reveal a novel role for tyrosine-based motifs in this process.",

            "text": "T HE Golgi complex plays a central role in the intracellular transport, processing and sorting of proteins in the secretory pathway. Morphological and functional studies have established that the Golgi complex of higher eukaryotes is organized into at least three contiguous but distinct regions: the cis-Golgi network (CGN) t, the Golgi stack and the TGN (reviewed by Mellman and Simons, 1992; Rothman and Orci, 1992) . The CGN is a collection of tubules connected to the cis-Golgi cisternae which serves as the entry site for proteins transiting from the ER into the Golgi complex. Itinerant proteins entering the CGN are either recycled back to the ER or routed forward into the Golgi stack (Huttner and Tooze, 1989; Hsu et al., 1991; Pelham, 1991) . The Golgi stack is composed of a variable number of flattened cisternae, in which an array of resident carbohydrate-modifying enzymes sequentially process the oligosaccharide chains of glycoproteins (Farquhar and Palade, 1981; Paulson and CoUey, 1989) . Immediately apposed to the transmost aspect of the Golgi stack is the TGN (Roth et al., 1985; Geuze et al., 1985) , a tubulo-reticular structure where proteins undergo further carbohydrate modifications and, in some cases, proteolytic processing (Duncan and Kornfeld, 1988) . In addition to having a role in biosynthetic protein Dr. Peters is on sabbatical leave from the Department of Cell Biology, Medical School, University of Utrecht, The Netherlands. processing, the TGN is a major sorting compaaia~ient for proteins destined to more distal organelles of the secretory pathway, such as lysosomes, endosomes, secretory granules, and different domains of the plasma membrane (Griffiths and Simons, 1986) .",

            "text": "The differentiated structure and function of the various Golgi regions is likely the result of the ordered localization of specific proteins to successive compartments of the system. Maintenance of such an organized arrangement of resident proteins requires mechanisms that retain certain proteins at defined locations while allowing other proteins to flow through the Golgi complex. Additional mechanisms must also exist to sort itinerant proteins along the different routes emanating from the Golgi complex. Both protein residence and sorting in the Golgi complex are thought to be mediated by specific structural signals. Recent studies have investigated the nature of retention signals of proteins that are specifically localized to the Golgi stack, including the avian coronavirus E1 glycoprotein and several glycosyltransferases (reviewed by Machamer, 1991) . For all of these proteins, information necessary for Golgi localization was contained within the membrane-spanning domains. No obvious homology was noticed among the different transmembrane sequences involved in Golgi localization, suggesting a retention process that relies on a physical property of the membrane-spanning domains rather than on receptor-mediated recognition of a specific sequence motif. This lack of homology and the inability to saturate the retention mechanism by overexpression of these proteins have suggested that localization to the Golgi stacks may be caused by formation of transport-incompetent assemblies involving transmembrane domain interactions (Machamer, 1991; Swift and Machamer, 1991; Munro, 1991; Nilsson et al., 1991) .",

            "text": "In contrast to the growing amount of information available on structural determinants for retention in the Golgi stacks, very little is known about signals for localization to the TGN. Two isoforms of a rat type I integral membrane protein, known as TGN38 and TGN41, have recently been shown to be specifically localized to a membrane-bound compartment with the characteristics of the TGN (Luzio et al., 1990; Reaves et al., 1992) . Mature TGN38 has an apparent molecular weight of 85,000-95,000, of which 38,000 are contributed by the core polypeptide and the rest by N-and O-linked oligosaccharide chains. TGN38 is organized into a 286amino acid NH2-terminal lumenal domain, a 21-amino acid membrane-spanning sequence and a 33-amino acid COOHterminal cytoplasmic tail (Luzio et al., 1990) . TGN41 is identical to TGN38, except that the last three amino acids of the TGN38 cytoplasmic tail are replaced by an additional 23-amino acid sequence (Reaves et al., 1992) . Since both TGN38 and TGN41 have been localized to the TGN by morphological studies (Luzio et al., 1990; Reaves et al., 1992) , the COOH-terminal polypeptide extension in TGN41 is not likely to play any role in TGN localization. Deletion of the cytoplasmic tail of TGN38 results in increased expression of the truncated protein at the cell surface, suggesting that this topologic domain contains information necessary for intracellular localization of the protein (Luzio et al., 1990) . The exact nature of the structural information contained within the TGN38 cytoplasmic tail and the possible contribution of other topologic domains of the protein to TGN localization remain to be established.",

The results of our experiments demonstrate that the cytoplasmic tail of TGN38 can confer TGN localization on another protein which normally resides at the plasma membrane. Thus, this cytoplasmic tail contains information that is not only necessary but also sufficient for TGN localization. The sequence YQRL, near the COOH-terminal end of the cytoplasmic tail, is essential for TGN localization. Overexpression of chimeric proteins containing the TGN38 tail results not only in detection of the chimeras at the cell surface, but also in disappearance of endogenous TGN38 from its normal intracellular location.

The rabbit anti-TGN38 antibody recognizes epitopes of the lumenal domain of TGN38 and does not react with the Tac-TGN38 chimeras or mutants used in our studies (Reaves et al., 1992 ; and data not shown). Fluorescently labeled donkey anti-mouse IgG and donkey anti-rabbit IgG suitable for multiple labeling experiments were purchased from Jackson Im-munoResearch (West Grove, PA).",

Plasmids encoding Tac and T-G-G were transfected separately into the rat fibroblast line, NRK, and the subeellular distribution of both proteins was examined by immunofluorescence microscopy of fixed, permeabilized cells using an antibody to a Tac lumenal epitope (7G7) (Rubin et al., 1985a) . We observed that whereas normal Tac was expressed on the plasma membrane ( Fig. 1 a) , the T-G-G chimera was localized to a juxtanuclear, tubulo-vesicular structure in the majority of positively stained cells (Fig. 1 c) . This distribution was consistent with localization to the TGN, as demonstrated by the similar pattern of immunofluorescent staining observed for endogenous TGN38 in the same cells ( Fig. 1 d) . Approximately 90% of the positively stained NRK cells showed localization of the chimeric protein to the TGN, whereas the remaining 10% also showed localization to the plasma membrane. In addition, ,,o15 % of the cells displayed staining of cytoplasmic vesicles. No changes in the localization of the T-G-G chimera were noticed upon a 3-h incubation of the cells in 10/~g/ml cycloheximide, suggesting that the localization of the protein to the TGN was not a transient phenomenon. In addition to NRK cells, the localization of T-G-G was examined after transient expression in various other cell lines, including cells of monkey (CV-1, COS-l), bovine (MBDK), and human origins (RD4 and HeLa). In all cases, we observed prominent staining of a tubulo-vesicular, and sometimes distinctly reticular, structure characteristic of the TGN (data not shown). These observations suggested that the TGN localization of proteins containing sequences from TGN38 was conserved among several mammalian species. A variable proportion of the cells also showed staining of cytoplasmic vesicles and the plasma membrane, the appearance of which seemed to correlate with higher levels of expression in those cells.",

This prompted us to compare the distribution of T-G-G with that of the transferrin receptor, which also carries a cytoplasmic tyrosine-containing internalization motif (YTRF). The recycling pool of transferrin receptors in CV-I cells was marked by incubation of intact cells for 2 h at 37~ with rhodamineconjugated transferrin. Under these conditions, intracellular transferrin would be expected to be bound to recycling receptors (Klausner et al., 1983; Dautry-Varsat et al., 1983) , and to be localized mainly to early endosomes (Hopkins, 1983) , with smaller amounts present in coated vesicles and tubules in the area of TGN (Willingham and Pastan, 1985; Fishman and Fine, 1987; Stoorvogel et al., 1988) . Cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and stained for T-G-G using an antibody to Tac and a fluorescein-conjugated second antibody (Fig. 8) . No internalized transferrin could be detected in the central TGN structure containing T-G-G using this methodology; instead, transferrin was found within vesicles distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 8, a and b) . As mentioned earlier, in some cells T-G-G was also found in cytoplasmic vesicles; the presence of internalized transferrin in the same vesicles identified them as early endosomal structures (Fig. 8, a and b) . Similarly, the distribution of endogenous transferrin receptors detected with specific antibodies differed from that of T-G-G in the TGN of human RD4 cells (data not shown).",

MOP-8 cells are transformed with an originless polyoma virus and thus replicate to high copy number the expression vector used in these studies, pCDM8, which has the polyoma virus origin of replication (Muller et al., 1984) . Consistent with the expected high levels of protein expression, immunofluorescent labeling of T-G-G in transfected MOP-8 cells showed surface staining in 63% of expressing cells (versus only '~10% in NRK cell transfections). Of MOP-8 cells expressing T-G-G at the plasma membrane, nearly all showed dimming or complete disappearance of endogenous TGN38 staining of the TGN as compared to untransfected cells in the same microscope field (Fig. 9, a and b) . Weak staining of TGN38 at the plasma membrane was observed in some of these cells (Fig. 9 b) . Disappearance of endogenous TGN38 staining was also observed in cells overexpressing other TGNlocalized chimeras, such as T-T-G and ID5 (data not shown). However, neither disappearance nor dimming of endogenous TGN38 staining was seen in MOP-8 cells overexpressing Tac (Fig. 9, c and d) , demonstrating the specificity of this phenomenon for overexpression of TGN-localized chimeras. Moreover, overexpression of T-G-G had no effect on the intensity and pattern of staining of a cis-medial Golgi marker, mannosidase II (Fig. 9 , e and f). One possible explanation for these observations is that TGN-localized chimeric proteins compete with endogenous TGN38 for interaction with a specific, saturable localization mechanism. However, alternative explanations, such as complete disruption of the TGN or masking of the TGN38 epitope by overexpression of the chimeric proteins, have not been ruled out at this time. More definitive evidence for saturability of a TGN localization mechanism will first require a demonstration of the structural integrity of the TGN in overexpressing cells and a quantitative demonstration that endogenous TGN38 is displaced from the TGN to the cell surface or other intracellular compartments. In any case, this phenomenon demonstrates an additional specificity of the cytoplasmic determinant, which not only can confer TGN localization but also can affect the distribution of an endogenous TGN resident protein.",

Our observations that the cytoplasmic domain of TGN38 contains sufficient information for localization to the TGN demonstrates the existence of a second mechanism operating to localize proteins within the Golgi complex that depends on cytoplasmic rather than transmembrane determinants. The two mechanisms differ not only in the topological domain harboring the localization signal, but also in the characteristics of the localization process. The available evidence indicates that overexpression of proteins normally localized in the Golgi stacks results in their increased detection in the ER but not at the plasma membrane (Munro, 1991; Nilsson et al., 1991; Moremen and Robbins, 1991; Colley et al., 1992) . This is in contrast to TGN-localized proteins which when overexpressed appear at the cell surface and in cytoplasmic vesicles (Luzio et al., 1990; this study) . Although the generality of these observations will have to be assessed for other TGN proteins, the present data reinforce the idea that the Golgi stacks and the TGN are intrinsically different in structure, dynamics and function (Klansner et al., 1992; Mellman and Simons, 1992; Rothman and Orci, 1992) .",

Immunoelectron microscopy studies have localized GLUT-4 and chimeric proteins having the GLUT-4 NH2-terminal cytoplasmic segment to tubulovesicular structures associated with the TGN (Slot et al., 1991; Piper et al., 1992) . The intracellular distribution of these proteins, however, seemed to be less restricted to the TGN than in our studies. Although the identity of residues critical for this localization of GLUT-4 has not been reported, it is noteworthy that the NH2-terminal sequence contains a potential aromatic amino acid-based tetrapeptide motif (FQQI; Piper et al., 1992) .",

The cytoplasmic domain of dipeptidyl aminopeptidase A (DPAP A), a yeast Golgi peptidase, has been shown to be sufficient for retention of the protein in Golgi structures (Roberts et al., 1992) . Similarly, deletion of the cytoplasmic tail of kex2p, a yeast Golgi pro-hormone processing peptidase, has been shown to result in mislocalization of the protein from a late Golgi compartment (Fuller et al., 1989) , Preliminary observations from our laboratory have indicated that the cytoplasmic domain of a rat kex2p homologue, furin (Misumi et al., 1990) , also has information sufficient for localization to the mammalian Golgi complex (J. S. Humphrey, J. Davidson, and J. S. Bonifacino, unpublished observations). Interestingly, several proteins localized to late compartments of the Golgi complex have potential aromatic amino acid-based motifs (Trowbridge, 1991) that may be involved in late Golgi or TGN localization. These proteins include DPAP A from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Roberts et al., 1992) ; the kex2p homologues from S. cerevisiae (Fuller et al., 1989) , Kluyveromyces lactis (Tanguy-Rougeau, 1988) , Drosophila melanogaster (Hayflick et al., 1991) , mouse (Hatsuzawa et al., 1990) , rat (Misumi et al., 1990) , and human (van den Ouweland et al., 1990) ; and kexlp from S. cerevisiae (Dmochowska et al., 1987) . Additional mutagenesis studies will be needed to establish whether these cytoplasmic motifs are involved in late Golgi or TGN localization, as is the case for TGN38. If true, it will mean that cytoplasmic motifs are widely used as signals for localization to late Golgi compartments and will raise the possibility that an evolutionarily conserved mechanism exists to recognize such signals.",

Some of our results, however, argue that the function of YQRL in TGN localization is not limited to its ability to cause endocytosis from the cell surface. For instance, the sequence YQDL was considerably less efficient for TGN localization, even though it was almost as effective as YQRL for internalization. This agrees with previous observations that YQDL is the internalization signal of the asiaioglycoprotein receptor H1 subunit (Spiess, 1990) , and that replacement of the transferrin receptor internalization signal by YQDL results in a mutant transferrin receptor with an internalization rate virtually identical to that of the wild-type receptor (Collawn et al., 1991) .",

For instance, most lysosomal integral membrane proteins have a cytoplasmic tyrosine residue that is critical for both lysosomal targeting and internalization (reviewed by Fukuda, 1991) . For the lysosomal protein lgp120, a glycine immediately before the tyrosine residue is essential for targeting to lysosomes at low expression levels, but is dispensable for internalization (Harter and Mellman, 1992) . Similarly, for lysosomal acid phosphatase, mutation of the critical cytoplasmic tyrosine residue to a phenylalanine abrogates basolateral targeting of the enzyme in polarized cells without affecting internalization (yon Figura; cited in Mostov et al., 1992) . Taken together, these observations suggest that cytoplasmic aromatic amino acid-containing motifs can be recognized at more than one point in the secretory and endocytic pathways, with overlapping but distinct specificities. The sequence YQRL probably belongs to a subset of internalization signals that have a specific capability to confer TGN localization.",

By analogy with tyrosine-based internalization signals (Pearse, 1985 (Pearse, , 1988 Glickman et al., 1989; Beltzer and Spiess, 1991) , the TGN localization determinant characterized here may bind to TGN-specific clathrin-associated adaptor molecules, such as 3,-adaptin (Robinson, 1990) . Interestingly, a large fraction of the yeast Golgi peptidase kex2p, whose cytoplasmic tail is necessary for Golgi localization, is missorted to the plasma membrane in yeast mutants deficient in clathrin heavy chains (Payne and Schekman, 1989; Seeger and Payne, 1992) . Interaction with components of non-clathrin coats of the TGN is also possible. For any of these potential interactions to result in TGN retention, however, association of cytoplasmic sequences with coated structures would have to be a relatively stable event. The specificity and kinetics of the interaction would be dictated by amino acid residues in or around the tyrosine-based motif, such that single amino acid substitutions could perturb the interaction.",

According to this model, TGN38 can traffic normally from the TGN to the plasma membrane where the YQRL motif then functions as an internalization signal. From the endosomal compartment, the protein would be transported back into the TGN by default or by additional sorting information in the localization determinant. This explanation would be analogous to the view of the ER localization motif, KDEL, as a retrieval rather than retention signal (Pelham, 1991) . Consistent with this retrieval model is our observation of a small amount of T-G-G at the cell surface of CV-1 stable transfectants, the ability of the chimeras to internalize bound antibody and the detection of chimeras in early endosomes. In addition, recent observations have suggested the existence of a pool of TGN38 cycling between the TGN and the call surface (Ladinsky, M. S., and K. E. Howell. 1992. Mol. Biol. Cell. 3:309) . To what extent a retrieval mechanism contributes to the localization of TGN38 chimeras to the TGN, however, remains to be established. The failure of the endocytosed R335D mutant to localize to the TGN and the different distributions of transferrin receptor and TGN-localized Tac-TGN38 chimeras suggest that the property of internalization per se is insufficient to specify TGN localization.",

            "text": "In conclusion, the observations reported here demonstrate that a short, tyrosine-containing sequence within the cytoplasmic tail of TGN38 is sufficient to confer TGN-localization to a reporter protein, Tac, and reveal a novel function for a cytoplasmic tyrosine-based motif-the ability to mediate protein localization to the TGN. Study of other proteins, such as furin, will ascertain whether similar cytoplasmic signals mediate localization of additional type I integral membrane proteins to the Golgi complex. The conservation of TGN localization across species boundaries and the demonstrated importance of the cytoplasmic domain for localization of yeast proteins to the late Golgi suggest the existence of an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that relies on the specific recognition of cytoplasmic determinants. The identification of sequences that are sufficient for TGN localization should allow the development of biochemical and genetic approaches to define the mechanisms by which membrane proteins become localized to the TGN.",
