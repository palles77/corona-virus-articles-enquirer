We categorized cases as potentially KFGH-acquired if affected persons had known KFGH contact before MERS onset and not KFGH-acquired if their first contact with KFGH followed MERS onset. We used KFGH electronic records to determine admission and discharge dates, inpatient rooms and beds occupied, and demographics for emergency department (ED) patients and inpatients. We assumed an incubation period of 2-14 days (5) and that patients were potentially infectious for 14 days after the onset date. To track the source of infection in individual patients, we looked for instances where an infectious inpatient was in the same room on the same date as a susceptible patient during the 2-14 days before MERS onset in the susceptible patient. We interviewed administrative, infection control, and clinical personnel at KFGH to review infection control recommendations and conducted a facility walk-through to evaluate infection control measures.",

The cohort comprised all patients who did not have symptomatic MERS when first treated in 1 of these 3 settings. For ED and inpatient areas, we counted patientdays from the first date of treatment until MERS symptom onset, discharge, or study period end; for the dialysis unit, we estimated patient-days as explained in the Hemodialysis Unit subsection. A cohort study case was defined as onset of RT-PCR-confirmed MERS-CoV infection within 2-14 days of treatment in >1 of these 3 settings. We excluded 1 patient who had symptom onset the day after admission because the incubation period would have been <2 days after first exposure to KFGH. For patients treated in >1 of the 3 settings, we determined the most probable setting and week of acquisition based on the assumption that the incubation period followed a log-normal distribution with mean 5.2 days and SD \u00b11.7 days as described by Assiri et.al. (5) (Tables 1, 2 ). Other published incubation period estimates (mean 5.5 days, SD \u00b12.5 days [13] ; and mean 6.8 days, no SD provided [14] ) were used in sensitivity analyses. We calculated incidence rates as cases per 10,000 patient-days, rate ratios, and mid-p values. To support these calculations, we used maximum-likelihood modeling to provide additional estimates of infection rates Figure 1 ). The total probability is 0.50 for inpatient, 0.21 for the dialysis unit, and 0.10 for ED, so acquisition most probably occurred in the inpatient areas.

            "text": "In previous MERS outbreaks, dialysis units have been implicated as a focus of disease transmission. At KFGH the patient-day risk for transmission in the dialysis unit was no greater than in the KFGH ED and inpatient areas; only 11 of the 22 cohort patients receiving dialysis were believed to have acquired MERS in the dialysis unit. \u2020For these analyses, cases were attributed to the setting or week that was most probable on the basis of incubation period ( Tables 1, 2) ; p values do not reflect uncertainty caused by these attributions. \u2021Denominator data for dialysis patients was not available; dialysis patients are not included in these analyses. Although MERS incidence rates were similar in the ED, inpatient areas, and dialysis unit, the ED was the most frequently implicated in disease acquisition among patients. Contributing factors probably included lack of triage, lack of isolation for patients with respiratory symptoms, extended stays for certain patients, and close proximity among patients. The KFGH outbreak peaked during week 6 and decreased sharply after week 7 ( Figures  2, 3) after infection control improvements in the ED during week 6. During week 8, infection control was improved in the dialysis unit, and a MERS unit was established in a separate building. These improvements, in combination with decreased patient volume by week 6, probably led to decreased transmission.",

Thus, as indicated in a recent laboratory-based study (15) , KFGH appears to have been an early focus of transmission in the Jeddah outbreak. Our cohort study reported higher incidence among older patients at KFGH, suggesting that clinically recognized disease did not develop in certain younger patients who were exposed to MERS-CoV infection at KFGH. Although we did not study HCW-to-patient transmission, asymptomatic HCWs were documented and might have contributed to disease transmission. The potential for transmission by asymptomatic persons needs further investigation.",

No records were kept on ED rooms in which patients were treated. Although we attempted to identify all non-KFGH healthcare exposures, certain exposures might not have been identified. We assumed that patients treated at KFGH at any time during the 2-14 days before illness onset had potentially KFGH-acquired disease. Records were not uniformly available when patients from other dialysis units or from the ED were dialyzed temporarily at KFGH; our results might not reflect disease transmitted from, or acquired by, these patients. The number of dialysis patientdays of treatment could only be estimated. Finally, data on genetic typing of MERS-CoV viruses from KFGH cases that could have helped define chains of transmission was not available to us.",

Illness most likely was transmitted in multiple settings, making it difficult to track disease from patient-to-patient. The contribution to MERS-CoV transmission at KFGH by asymptomatic persons is uncertain; transmission by asymptomatic persons is an area that needs further study. Heightened awareness of MERS, aggressive triaging of patients, prompt isolation, and strict infection control measures were associated with a rapid decrease in transmission. Continued vigilance and consistent adherence to infection control precautions is necessary to prevent future healthcare-acquired MERS outbreaks.",
