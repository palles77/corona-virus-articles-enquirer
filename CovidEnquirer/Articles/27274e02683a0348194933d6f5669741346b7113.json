Moreover, it is important to monitor changes in antigenicity, severity, transmissibility, and antiviral resistance in the southern hemisphere to compare with those of the spring and winter outbreaks in the northern hemisphere. We construct simple mathematical models using the epidemiologic data for these southern hemisphere countries to draw timely and useful conclusions regarding the role played by the new pH1N1 strain under the setting of a typical winter influenza season.",

When there are indeed two or more waves of infections, a variation of the S-shaped Richards model has been proposed, 14 which distinguishes between two types of turning points: one in the initial S curve that signifies the first turning point that ends initial exponential growth (or a downturn in case number) and a second type of turning point in the epidemic curve where the growth rate of the number of cumulative cases begin to increase again (or a upturn in case number), signifying the beginning of the next wave of infections. This variation of the Richards model provides a systematic method of determining whether an outbreak is 1-wave or multi-wave in nature, and is designed to isolate the main turning points from those peaks and valleys resulting from the data stochasticity. More details on the multi-wave Richards model can be found in, [14] [15] [16] where 2003 SARS incidence curves for the Great Toronto Area and Singapore are shown to contain two peaks (local maximum or turning point of the first type) and one valley (local minimum or turning point of second type). The readers are also referred to 14 for its application to 2-wave dengue outbreak in Taiwan in 2007.",

The estimates for R in Argentina and New Zealand obtained by using different estimates of generation interval (T) for 2009 pH1N1 in the literature are also in close agreement (Tables 8 and 9 ). The results indicate that higher values of T will raise all the estimates for R, as can be expected from the formula for R given earlier. For the Argentina hospitalization data with T = 1AE91 18 , R = 1AE27 is obtained; whereas using a T value of around 2AE7 21 we have R = 1AE40 (see Table 8B ). Both estimates are within reasonable range. However, the discrepancy becomes larger for larger values of R (see next to last row, Table 8A ), thus indicating the dependence of R on accurate estimate of T. The corresponding estimates for other countries are similar and hence are omitted for brevity. The estimates for New Zealand are substantially lower than the range of 1AE49-2AE55 for reproduction number obtained in, 24 using the case data of 585 confirmed cases and 38 probable cases from 28 May to 28 June. We note, however, that 63 imported cases were first removed for the data in. 24 This omission most likely resulted in an overestimation of the initial growth rate, by ignoring these imported cases that must have collectively played a significant role in the early local transmissions in the island nation. We note that the role of imported cases is problematic to quantitate when estimating transmissibility, as there are no 'local' source of infection for these imported cases. However, by discounting the imported cases, which in the case of New Zealand data accounts for more than 10% of total cases, one ignores the infections caused by the imported infective and hence inevitably overestimates the transmissibility of the remaining local cases.",

For example, a few imported cases at the early stages that set off a fast-spreading disease locally (e.g., pandemic influenza) would have a decidedly different effect when compared to the situation with imported cases scattered over a long period of time for a less transmissible disease with no apparent asymptomatic infections such as SARS, unless there are very fastdeveloping local clusters of infections or nosocomial spread, as in the 2003 SARS outbreak. A study on pH1N1 epidemic in Victoria, Australia, indicates that, by using methods designed to account for the undetected transmission caused by unidentified imported cases, the mean estimate for R reduces dramatically from 2AE4 to 1AE6. 26 The reproduction number obtained for Brazil is only slightly higher than other southern hemisphere countries studied (see Figure 3 ), but with a much larger confidence interval. In the cases of Argentina and Brazil where both 1-wave and 2-wave Richards models fit the cumulative case data, R is always larger in the first phase in May to June, perhaps indicative of the initial severity or lack of immunity \u2044 intervention during early stages of a novel virus outbreak. We note that higher R for earlier data was also observed in, 22 after correction for ascertainment bias.",

This gives further credence to the detection of turning points of an outbreak, not only for disease incidence but also for the temporal changes in disease progression and treatment of the infected individuals. We note that in general the turning points of an outbreak correspond to peaks and valleys in the epidemic curve. However, as a result of stochastic variations, multiple spikes often appear around the peaks. Moreover, some temporary deceleration or acceleration in the cumulative rate might not be related to a declining epidemic. The Richards model has the advantage of isolating a small range of time period during which the turning points (up turns and down turns) may have occurred.

Nevertheless, the Richards model provides a swift and viable method to quick estimate of R as well as identifying the important turning points of the outbreak, with a minimal requirement of epidemic data that are typically available to the public. It is interesting to note that, for Argentina, the hospitalization data for confirmed pH1N1 cases are not available on the web; therefore, we used the hospitalization data for severe respiratory infections, which include but are not limited to the confirmed pH1N1 cases. However, the resulting estimate for reproduction number is surprisingly similar to the estimates using the case data or the death data. Moreover, the estimated turning point for hospitalizations is also consistent with those of cases and deaths.",

For example, in Australia, the epidemic in Victoria was a full month ahead of some other states might well have impacted the epidemic in other states. In such cases, instead of using national totals, the detailed data for each region are needed to account for the regional heterogeneity. However, other factors such as the level of mobility between regions must then be considered, which would call for a complicated model with spatial elements, which is again beyond the scope of this study.",

Therefore, the current strain, while circulating around the globe, has not become more severe or transmissible either in the southern or in the northern hemisphere, as some experts had cautioned. The results, which corroborate earlier findings that the 2009 pandemic had not been severe in the southern hemisphere, 31 will be useful for global preparedness planning of possible tertiary waves of pH1N1 infections in the fall \u2044 winter of both southern and northern hemispheres in 2010.

However, the third turning point of the respective 2-wave models is in agreement with the single turning point of the respective 1-wave models, both detect e-week 31 in the case of Brazil and are separated by merely 2 days (June 24 and June 26) for Argentina, thus indicating that the detection of the most important turning point of the outbreak is robust.",
