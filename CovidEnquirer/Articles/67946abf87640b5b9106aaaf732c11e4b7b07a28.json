Positive PCR results were confirmed by sequencing. None of 94 anal swabs from live birds tested positive for HPAI H5N1. However, 1 of 79 animal cage swabs tested positive for HPAI H5N1 (Figure 1 ). The positive swab was from a goose cage at market I ( Table) , the market that the patient visited from February 10 to February 20. The nucleotide sequences of H and M genes from specimens from this patient were compared with those from the animal cage swab and submitted to GenBank (accession nos. DQ842487-90). Forty-eight variations were found in the NA gene and 15 were found in the HA gene, which resulted in 17 HA amino acid and 3 NA amino acid changes, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis with the neighbor-joining method using the ClustalX program (4) suggested that the 2 strains are related to each other and to duck isolates ( Figure 2 ).",

She visited a market that had live birds 2 weeks before her illness. Another patient lived in a periurban area of Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province; her diagnosis was made in January 2006. She was self-employed in a shop selling dry goods at a market that had live birds in Jinhua Town in Chengdu (7) . Two other patients in urban areas were reported, 1 in Shanghai and 1 in Shenzhen. Influenza was diagnosed in the patient in Shanghai in March 2006, but this patient had no history of visiting a food market that had live birds or contact with diseased birds (8) .

            "text": "Our findings suggest that food markets or farmers' markets that have live poultry may be a source for avian influenza infection in which healthy live birds may carry the virus. This was previously shown in Hanoi, Vietnam, in 2001, where H5N1 virus was detected in domestic birds in a live bird market (9) . Serologic investigation also demonstrated low seroprevalence of antibody against HPAI H5N1 in poultry workers from this market. However, no outbreaks of HPAI among birds were reported until early 2004 (10) . H5N1 virus may be sustained in poultry largely through the movement of poultry and poultry products, especially through domestic ducks (11, 12) . The introduction of H5N1 virus from healthy poultry (such as ducks) may be occurring where no outbreaks in healthy flocks have been observed. Therefore, the virus is likely reintroduced at low levels and can infect persons visiting live poultry markets. The cultural preference of eating freshly slaughtered birds is not unique to the People's Republic of China; it is also common in other Asian countries. Our results suggest that the practice of selling live birds directly to consumers in food markets should be discouraged in areas currently experiencing influenza outbreaks among birds, especially in large modern cities where there may be a threat to the casual market visitor (2, 13, 14) .

Viral RNA was extracted from the sample and amplified by using 3 pairs of primers specific for membrane (M), hemagglutinin (H5), and neuraminidase (N1) virus genes. Sample buffer was used as a negative control, and viral RNA from a human H5N1 virus strain (A/Hong Kong/486/97) was included as a positive control. First lane, molecular mass ladder.",
