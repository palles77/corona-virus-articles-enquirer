            "text": "APP are classified as either negative or positive, depending on whether their serum/ plasma levels decrease or increase during an APR, respectively. A notable negative APP is albumin, with positive APP including fibrinogen, haptoglobin, and serum amyloid A (SAA). Serum/plasma levels of positive APP increase in response to a triggering event (eg, infection, trauma) and decrease coinciding with recovery; the magnitude of increase and rate of decline varies between species and the specific APP. 3 Equine SAA is an apolipoprotein consisting of three isoforms and is complexed primarily to high-density lipoproteins. [4] [5] [6] Mainly produced by the liver, extrahepatic secretion of SAA also occurs into colostrum and synovial fluid. SAA is the only major positive APP in the horse. A major APP is defined as one whose concentrations are low or clinically undetectable in normal animals but rapidly increase greater than 10-fold during the APR and rapidly decrease with disease resolution. Relapse or a new/secondary insult result in a return to increased concentrations. 4 This contrasts with moderate APPs, such as fibrinogen and haptoglobin in the horse, which are detectable in serum/plasma of healthy animals, have a slower response to stimuli, and increase 1to 10-fold during the APR. Fibrinogen has remained the mainstay of blood analysis for inflammation in horses and other large animal species, largely because of the ease and minimal expense of testing. However, fibrinogen concentrations do not increase for 24 hours after the inciting inflammatory event and only peak at 48 to 72 hours. 7 Additionally, the increase in fibrinogen concentrations is small (usually 1-to 2-fold) making it difficult to reliably detect mild inflammation. In contrast, serum/plasma SAA concentrations increase up to 1000 times as soon as 6 hours after stimulation and, once the stimulus is removed, concentrations decrease within 12 hours because of its short half-life (30-120 minutes). 5, 8, 9 The widespread use of fibrinogen versus SAA measurement in large animals most likely started as a function of assay availability. Methods of diagnostic evaluation of SAA have greatly improved since its discovery as a major APP, allowing for inexpensive testing in serum or plasma stallside or in laboratories. [10] [11] [12] [13] SAA is stable at room temperature and refrigerated, allowing for transport before testing 10 and can be measured in noninvasive samples, such as saliva. 14 Although there are differences in precision and accuracy between assays, most available tests seem accurate enough within clinically relevant ranges. 8, 10, 11, 13 Various publications refer to SAA in mg/L, mg/mL, and ng/mL; the first two of these units are equivalent and the third represents one thousandth the concentration of the first.",

Animals with systemic inflammation had significantly higher SAA concentrations (mean, 1583 mg/L; range, 688-4000 mg/L) than horses with local or no inflammation (mean of 343 mg/L and range of 37-1609, and mean of 5.6 mg/L and range of 1.8-14.5 mg/L, respectively). This discrimination was more distinct than that of fibrinogen, where the mean concentrations of the three groups were 224, 181, and 128 mg/dL, respectively. 31 For differentiating clinically normal horses from those with infectious or inflammatory disease, SAA measurement had a sensitivity of 53%, specificity of 94%, and diagnostic accuracy of 75%, whereas white blood cell count, plasma fibrinogen concentrations, and albumin/globulin ratios had lower diagnostic accuracy (59%-62%). 32 In cases where Long & Nolen-Walston serial SAA measurements were obtained, horses with increasing SAA concentrations between 24 and 72 hours of admission were significantly more likely to develop complications or be euthanized, whereas there was no significant difference in outcome in horses with increased SAA concentrations at admission. 25 ",

[33] [34] [35] [36] Foals with sepsis and other bacterial infections have significantly higher SAA concentrations than healthy foals or sick foals without inflammation, although there is enough overlap in the concentrations among these groups that SAA should not be used as a sole means of identifying infection or sepsis. [35] [36] [37] [38] In the largest study evaluating SAA in foals, a healthy control group of 226 Thoroughbred neonates had median SAA concentrations of 0.9, 4.5, and 2.5 mg/L on 1, 2, and 3 days old, with the values on Day 2 being significantly higher than on Day 1. 33 In 136 foals with clinical disease, median SAA concentrations of cases with focal infections (eg, omphalitis) were 195 mg/L and those with septicemia higher still at 280 mg/L. Foals with noninflammatory abnormalities, such as failure of passive transfer and noninfectious disease, had low SAA concentrations at 5.1 and 3.1 mg/L, respectively. A separate small study found that foals with positive blood cultures had markedly increased SAA concentrations compared with foals with ambiguous or negative blood cultures, which had moderate or no increases in SAA concentrations, respectively. 35 Because of the presence of SAA within colostrum, it has been suggested that the increased SAA concentrations in normal foals shortly after birth may be associated with colostral absorption. 39 High fibrinogen levels in neonatal foals can often indicate intrauterine inflammation. Although less is known about SAA levels with intrauterine inflammation, one report assessing the relationship between intrauterine or umbilical cord bacteria with foal health following parturition found no significant difference between postpartum SAA levels and the presence of bacteria in amniotic fluid or venous umbilical blood. 40 ",

Most 4,41,42 but not all 43, 44 studies have found that SAA concentrations are significantly higher (median, 65 41 to 935 mg/L 42 ) in horses with colic-attributable inflammatory causes (eg, enteritis, colitis, peritonitis, or abdominal abscesses) versus surgical and noninflammatory colic (median, 4.8 41 to 228 mg/L 42 ). Furthermore, SAA concentrations were increased in horses with equine grass sickness (median, 50 mg/L) compared with those with surgical and noninflammatory colic (median, w0 mg/L). 45 In contrast to these reports, one prospective study found that 62% of horses with colic requiring surgical intervention had SAA concentrations greater than or equal to 5 mg/L, compared with 19% of medically managed horses, although cases of peritonitis or colitis were excluded. 43 A smaller retrospective study also found that SAA concentrations did not distinguish between surgical and nonsurgical or strangulating and nonstrangulating lesions. 44 Several studies have shown that peritoneal fluid SAA concentrations are increased in horses with colic compared with control horses, although peritoneal fluid concentrations are not higher than that in serum/plasma. 42, 46, 47 However, peritoneal fluid SAA concentrations increase more rapidly in horses with strangulating lesions than other Equine Inflammatory Markers in the 21st Century diseases, although it only discriminated between simple obstruction and strangulating or inflammatory colics of greater than 24 hours duration. 47 It is known that surgery itself, such as exploratory celiotomy for colic, causes an increase in APPs, including SAA. 43, [48] [49] [50] Compared with more minor surgical procedures, exploratory celiotomy causes a prolonged APR, with serum SAA concentrations increased from 48 to 96 hours after surgery (compared with 12-24 hours with minor procedures). 48, 50, 51 Horses with postoperative complications had a more pronounced increase in SAA (61.4-fold over baseline) and took longer to achieve peak values (96 hours) compared with horses without complications (29fold increase; peak at 48 hours). 50 Another prospective study assessing SAA and complications in postoperative colic patients found that the magnitude of SAA increase was greater at 48 hours and 4 to 6 days postsurgery in horses with versus those without complications. 49 The data are conflicting regarding the accuracy and utility of SAA for determining outcome and prognosis in horses with colic. One study 44 found no significant differences in SAA concentration between survivors and nonsurvivors, whereas another larger study 50 of horses undergoing exploratory celiotomy found that patients with increased SAA concentrations 5 days postoperatively were slightly less likely to survive to discharge (odds ratio, 0.97). Taken together, the current literature with equine colic suggests that SAA alone does not offer clear guidance on differentiating surgical from nonsurgical colics nor should it be relied on for prognosticating survivability when euthanasia is being considered. However, colic cases that are admitted with higher SAA concentrations (20, and typically 60-1000 mg/L) should have inflammatory lesions, such as enteritis and colitis, higher on the differential diagnostic list.",

Several studies have demonstrated that transport alone, the major risk factor for pneumonia in horses, can cause increased SAA concentrations, ranging from around 30 to 500 mg/mL for 24 to 48 hours after longdistance (1200 km) shipping. 52 This increase was significantly diminished by administration of antimicrobials 52,53 but shorter transport times (4 hours) had no effect. 54 Horses naturally infected with equine influenza virus A2 (H3N8) had increased SAA concentrations during the first 48 hours of clinical signs. Concentrations then returned to baseline within 11 to 22 days. 55 A useful characteristic of SAA is that it does not increase higher than baseline in horses naturally exposed to but not infected with equine herpes virus type 1 or Streptococcus equi subsp equi. 29 In bacterial pneumonia, marked increases in SAA concentrations is seen (in the thousands) 32 and one prospective study found that the SAA concentration correlated better with rectal temperature and clinical resolution of disease than fibrinogen concentrations in Thoroughbreds experimentally infected with S equi subsp zooepidemicus. 16 Concentrations of SAA peaked at Day 3 postinoculation and returned to baseline at Day 15 as compared with fibrinogen, which peaked at Days 4 to 5 and returned to baseline by Long & Nolen-Walston Day 22. Concentrations of SAA in horses were significantly lower in horses with equine influenza virus and equine herpes virus type 1 infection (median, 731 mg/L and 1173 mg/L, respectively; range, 0 to 3000 mg/L) than those positive for S equi subsp equi (median, 1953 mg/L; range, 0 to 3000 mg/L). Because of the significant overlap between horses with viral and bacterial respiratory disease, SAA concentrations alone cannot be used to distinguish between these two groups. 30 When examining horses with equine asthma (separated into inflammatory airway disease or recurrent airway obstruction in the highlighted studies), multiple investigations have found increases in SAA concentration in affected horses compared with control subjects. 19, 26 In contrast, other studies found no significant differences in SAA concentrations in horses with inflammatory airway disease or recurrent airway obstruction and control horses. 56, 57 Therefore, the main utility of SAA measurement in equine asthma seems to be differentiating these cases from horses with infectious respiratory disease.",

The authors concluded that \"monitoring concentrations of SAA is not useful as a screening test for early detection of R equi.\" 58 A subsequent smaller study that assessed weekly screening with SAA to identify preclinical R equi infections in an endemic farm diagnosed with R equi pneumonia found similar results. 59 In the latter study, SAA concentrations were not associated with the development of sonographic evidence of lung abscessation and only two of six foals with pneumonia had high SAA concentrations.",

Repeated arthrocentesis (which increases the nucleated cell count and total protein) and intra-articular amikacin injection do not affect SAA concentrations and SAA measurement in these cases may be important because the effects of repeated sampling can confound assessment of treatment efficacy and resolution. 68, 69 Additionally, more recent studies have found that repeated arthroscopy and repeated through-and-through joint lavage also do not affect synovial or serum SAA concentrations, whereas the nucleated cell count and total protein are increased following these procedures alone. 70, 71 Although most of the SAA found within synovial fluid may be an ultrafiltrate from plasma, a jointspecific isoform of SAA is produced by synoviocytes. 72 As in other diseases, bacterial infection of joints and other synovial structures seems to be the most potent stimulant of SAA production. Concentrations of SAA in plasma and synovial fluid are increased in horses with septic synovial disease (synovial fluid, mean of 39.2 mg/L and range of 0-368.9 mg/L; plasma, mean of 275.5 mg/L and range of 0-1421.8 mg/L) but not nonseptic (synovial fluid, mean of 0 mg/L and range of 0-29.7 mg/L; plasma, mean of 0.5 mg/L and range of 0-17 mg/L) or control groups. 73 A study examining SAA in experimentally induced inflammatory synovitis and septic arthritis found similar differences between groups in serum and synovial fluid SAA concentrations. 74 For the septic and aseptic groups, the mean peak synovial SAA concentrations were 135 mg/L (range, 60-555 mg/L) and 0 mg/L (range, 0-0), respectively, whereas the mean peak serum SAA concentrations were 663 mg/L (range, 217-1434 mg/L) and 0 mg/L (0-0), respectively. This study did find a delayed increase in synovial (no appreciable increase until 36 hours, at which time it peaked) compared with serum (began to increase at 24 hours, peaked at 36 hours) SAA concentrations after induction of septic synovitis. 74 Horses with penetrating wounds to a synovial structure that presented within 24 hours after the initial injury had lower plasma SAA concentrations at admission (median, 23 mg/L) and a faster decrease following surgery, compared with horses requiring multiple surgeries, which had a median SAA concentration of 3378 mg/L at admission, with persistent increases 48 hours postoperatively (median, 2525 mg/L). 75 ",

Additionally, conflicting data exist regarding the role of obesity and inflammation within horses. Concentrations of SAA were not increased in previously laminitic ponies that were in remission, but exercise caused slight increases in some ponies. 76, 77 In obese equids, increases in SAA concentrations were correlated with higher body condition score and higher plasma insulin concentrations. 78 However, the SAA concentrations in all of the horses were within the reference interval (3.8 mg/L was the highest result), so the diagnostic utility of using SAA to assess for inflammation in obese horses is uncertain. 78 ",

It seems to have limited validity in screening foals for R equi pneumonia, although it often increases to extremely high concentrations in pleuropneumonia in adult horses and is valuable in assessing response to treatment in such cases. SAA also does not reliably distinguish surgical from nonsurgical colic cases and, although it may possibly be oversensitive, serial testing of SAA is likely superior to that of fibrinogen in identifying postoperative infections. Any deviations from a steady fall after the first 2 to 3 days after surgery might prompt a search for infectious complications. Overall, practitioners should feel comfortable using SAA in lieu of fibrinogen (and certainly in preference to complete blood count (CBC), in the authors' opinion) for most cases where infectious or inflammatory disease is suspected, although measuring both initially may be useful for the practitioner with limited experience in interpreting the wide range of results with this marker.",
