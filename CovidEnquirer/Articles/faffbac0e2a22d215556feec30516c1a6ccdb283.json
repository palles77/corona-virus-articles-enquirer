            "text": "The computational search of chemical libraries has been used as a powerful tool for the rapid discovery of candidate compounds. To find small molecules with anti-feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) properties, we utilized a virtual screening technique to identify the active site on the viral protease for the binding of the available natural compounds. The protease 3CL (3CL pro ) plays an important role in the replication cycle of FIPV and other viruses within the family Coronaviridae. The 15 best-ranked candidate consensus compounds, based on three docking tools, were evaluated for further assays. The protease inhibitor assay on recombinant FIPV 3CL pro was performed to screen the inhibitory effect of the candidate compounds with IC 50 ranging from 6.36 \u00b1 2.15 to 78.40 \u00b1 2.60 \u03bcM. As determined by the cell-based assay, the compounds NSC345647, NSC87511, and NSC343256 showed better EC 50 values than the broad-spectrum antiviral drug ribavirin and the protease inhibitor lopinavir, under all the test conditions including pre-viral entry, post-viral entry, and prophylactic activity. The NSC87511 particularly yielded the best selective index (> 4; range of SI = 13.80-22.90). These results indicated that the natural small-molecular compounds specifically targeted the 3CL pro of FIPV and inhibited its replication. Structural modification of these compounds may generate a higher anti-viral potency for the further development of a novel therapy against FIP.",

Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) is a mutated form of the parental enteric form of FCoV, called feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). FIPV infects domestic cats in multiple cat households worldwide (Manasateinkij et al., 2009; Pedersen, 2009 Pedersen, , 2014a . FIP is a serious systemic (pyo-) granulomatous disease that causes protein-rich effusions in the body cavities. This disease progresses severely within a week to few months, before a cat dies (Pedersen, 2009) . Several strategies have been used for supportive treatment against this disease. Anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs have been used to inhibit the inflammatory process and reduce the clinical signs with an aim to expand the life of a cat. The combination of antivirals and immuno-stimulating drugs has been applied for the treatment of coronaviruses in humans (Pedersen, 2014b) . However, there is no report on the successful use of preventive vaccines and antiviral therapies to treat FIP.",

Two-thirds of the FCoV genome at the 5' end comprise two overlapping ORFs, ORF1a and 1b, which encode two polyproteins. The translation of ORF1a yields the polyprotein pp1a. At lower frequencies, ribosomes initiate translation at the beginning of ORF1a and undergo a frameshift at the junction between ORF1a and 1b, resulting in a long polyprotein, pp1ab https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2019.104697 Received 28 September 2019; Received in revised form 15 December 2019; Accepted 16 December 2019 (Pedersen, 2014a; St. John et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015) . Similar to other coronaviruses (CoV), FCoV pp1ab contains two cysteine proteases, the papain-like protease (PL pro ) and the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL pro ). The 3CL pro is also known as the main protease (M pro ) (Pedersen, 2014a; St. John et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015; Berry et al., 2015) that plays a pivotal role in the viral life cycle, including the processing of polyprotein and viral replication. The polyprotein pp1a and pp1ab are subsequently enzymatically cleaved into 16 nonstructural functional proteins (nsp1 to nsp16) that are mainly involved in proteolytic processing and viral RNA synthesis, including the replication of the genome and synthesis of the sub-genomic mRNA. The remaining genome contains nine ORFs that encode four structural proteins--spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and envelope (E) proteins, and five accessory proteins (3a-c, 7a, and 7b).",

In human CoV, the 3CL pro has been termed \"the Achilles' heel of coronaviruses\". It is an attractive target for drug discovery. The 3CL pro of FIPV could act as a model to study the potential antiviral drugs against further emerging CoV-associated diseases. The in vitro assay is particularly available in the FIPV system. The inhibitors that target 3CL pro , including pyridine N-oxide derivatives, peptidomimetic analogs, covalent inhibitors, and peptidyl compounds, have been evaluated previously (Balzarini et al., 2006; Berry et al., 2015) . Natural products from herbal extracts could represent a major resource for the development of antiviral drugs.

The input files were converted to the pdbqt file format. The grid parameters were grid center (x = \u221240, y = \u221210, z = \u22125) and size (x = 30, y = 30, z = 30), wherein the space was at the center of the catalytic pocket of FIPV 3CL pro . Lamarckian genetic algorithm (GA) was set by default, where the parameters included 20 GA runs, 150 individuals in the population, and 270,000 generations. The top 10 outputs of the best binding affinities for each docking run were stored. In this study, the 64 selected compounds were re-scored using different docking algorithms on the program GOLD version 5.5 (license kindly provided by Assoc. Prof. Dr Kiattawee Choowongkomon, Kasetsart University), based on GA. The grid parameters of the interface region were similar to those set for PyRx with 20 GA runs. The score function was based on the Gold-Score fitness function for ranking of the binding affinity. The second program for re-scoring, ICM-pro suite version 3.8.6, was used to calculate energy according to the Monte Carlo biased-probability algorithm. The grid space was adjusted similarly for both the mentioned software. The parameters of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and Areas Under the ROC Curve (AUCs) were applied to determine the performance of each scoring function and docking performances. The interactions of protein-ligand complexes were characterized using the program LigPlot version 1.4.5.

The PCR product was digested using NcoI and XhoI, and then ligated into a pET32a vector. The recombinant protease plasmid was then used to transform E. coli DH5\u03b1-competent cells that were then streaked on a Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plate containing 100 \u03bcg/mL ampicillin.

The 5-mL overnight culture of a single transformant was used to inoculate 500 mL of fresh LB medium containing 100 \u03bcg/mL ampicillin. The cells were grown to the appropriate optical density (OD 600 = 0.6) and induced with 1 mM Isopropyl-\u03b2-D-1 thiogalactopyranoside. After 4-5 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7,000\u00d7g for 15 min. The protein purification was carried out as described previously . Briefly, the gene encoding FIPV 3CL pro was amplified using PCR and inserted into the commercial vector pET32a for the expression of the enzyme with thioredoxin, hexa-His tag, and a cleavage site for FXa protease on the N-terminus. After cleavage of the tag by FXa protease, the mixture was loaded onto another Ni-NTA column to remove the thioredoxin and hexa-His tag. The purity of the tag-free FIPV 3CL pro was evaluated using SDS-PAGE. The protein having a purity of more than 90% was first dialyzed in a buffer containing 12 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 120 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 7.5 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and then subjected to the next experiment.",

Therefore, we further analyzed the interactions between the compounds and the active site of 3CL pro , especially those between the key amino acid residues. All the compounds were firmly placed within the binding pocket of FIPV 3CL pro , where the catalytic residues His41 and Cys144 were present. The binding pockets of FIPV 3CL pro exhibited non-covalent interactions with the small molecules (Fig. 5) , which is favorable in drug design. The non-covalent interactions between amino acid residues in the binding pocket of FIPV 3CL pro and each compound are detailed as follows: 1) compound NSC345647 (upper panel A, alkyl/\u03c0-alkyl: His41, Cys144, Pro188; \u03c0donor: Glu165; lower panel A, hydrophobic interaction: Thr47, Phe139, Ala141, His163; hydrogen bond: Ile140, Gly142, Cys144, Glu165); 2) compound NSC87511 (B upper panel, alkyl/\u03c0-alkyl: His163, Leu164, Pro188; \u03c0-sigma: His41; lower panel B, hydrophobic interactions: Cys144, Asp186, Gln187; hydrogen bond: Thr47, Glu165); compound NSC343256 (upper panel C, Alkyl/\u03c0-alkyl:Cys144, Pro188; \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking: His41; hydrogen bond:THR47; lower panel C, hydrophobic interactions: Asn25, Fig. 2 . Protein purification and kinetic parameters of FIPV 3CL pro . (A) SDS-PAGE analysis of the FIPV 3CL protease at different stages of the purification procedure. Lane 1 represents the molecular mass markers. Lanes 2 and 3 show the cell lysate without and with IPTG induction to overexpress FIPV 3CL protease with fusion tag, respectively. Lane 4 is the tagged protease after Ni-NTA column chromatography. Lane 5 represents the purified FIPV 3CL pro after cleavage of FXa to remove the fusion tag. Two extra bands of the intact FIPV 3CL pro and the fusion tag at lower molecular mass appear on SDS-PAGE. Lane 6 shows the purified untagged protease (arrowed) after passing the second Ni-NTA column. (B) Determining the kinetic parameters of FIPV 3CL protease. The initial reaction rates of the protease at different substrate concentrations were plots against substrate concentrations to obtain the V max and K m values of the enzyme. GraphPad Prism software was used to fit the kinetic data using Michaelis-Menten equation. The k cat and K m of this reaction were 0.71 \u00b1 0.04 s \u22121 and 8.56 \u00b1 1.15 \u03bcM, respectively. Glu118, His163, Leu164, Asp186, Gln187; hydrogen bonds: Asn24, Val26, Thr47). In particular, all the compounds showed interactions with the thiol group of cysteine (Cys144) and the imidazole ring of histidine (His41) (Fig. 5 ). In addition, we evaluated the drug-like physicochemical properties of the candidate compounds using the Lipinski's Rule of Five (Rule-of-5, Ro5; Lipinski, 2004) and ADME/T properties. The Ro5 criteria defined four ranges of simple physicochemical parameters, molecular weight \u2264500, log P \u2264 5, H-bond donors \u22645, and H-bond acceptors \u226410, which are mostly associated with orally active drugs. The compounds NSC87511 and NSC343256 abided by the 'drug-likeness' criteria, except the compound NSC345647, which showed less potential for orally-active properties (Supplementary Table 2 ).

The compound NSC345647 was a fungal metabolite called Chaetochromin, isolated from Fusarium (Ascomycotina, Hypocreales), Penicillium, Chaetomium, etc. Chaetochromin A is a symmetrical dimer having two trans-2,3-dimethyl groups on the 5,6,8-trihydroxy-naphtho-\u03b3-pyrone ring (Ugaki et al., 2012) . Chaetochromin and their derivatives have been reported as inhibitors of HIV integrase, based on strandtransfer assay of recombinant integrase, with IC 50 = 1-12 \u03bcM (Singh et al., 2003) . Using in silico analysis, the complex of chaetochromin and HRAS protein in AIDS-associate cancers was simulated, and chaetochromin B was observed to be stable in the binding pocket, making it a promising antiviral drug (Omer and Singh, 2017) . In our study, the three viral infection assays showed that chaetochromin could inhibit FIPV infection, with low IC 50 and EC 50 .

Stictic acid is a \u03b2-orcinol depsidone that is produced by the lichens. The polyketides and their unique secondary metabolites containing aromatic rings are commonly found in stictic acid. The derivatives of stictic acid could reduce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cells via their anti-oxidative activity (Loh\u00e9zic-Le D\u00e9v\u00e9hat et al., 2007; Papadopoulou et al., 2007) . Moreover, stictic acid could react with the Cys141 within the cysteine triad of tumor suppressor protein p53, to reduce its reactivation in human cancers (Wassman et al., 2013) . It should be noted that 3CL pro of CoV also contains cysteine as the nucleophilic active site in the catalytic dyad (Cys144 and His41) Kim et al., 2012) . In our docking study, the compound interacted with His41 (hydrophobic bond) and Cys144 (hydrophobic and hydrogen bonds). We also observed the protease-inhibitory effect of NSC87511 (Supplementary Table 1 ) during the FIPV 3CL pro inhibition assay. Stictic acid derivatives and atranorin that were extracted from lichens using acetone could inhibit the replication of hepatitis C virus (Vu et al., 2015) .

The mechanism of action of ribavirin is still unclear and highly variable among patients (Cameron and Castro, 2001; Zumla et al., 2016) . However, it from isolated is known to interfere with the synthesis of viral mRNA and viral replication, and is primarily indicated for hepatitis C virus (Dixit and Perelson, 2006) . The activity of ribavirin is enhanced by using its combination with interferons or other antiviral drugs that synergistically inhibit the viruses, rather than treatment with ribavirin alone, as reported for the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV regimens (Falzarano et al., 2013; Omrani et al., 2014) . Ribavirin in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir and steroids showed a slight reduction in the mortality rate in patients infected with SARS-CoV (Chan et al., 2003) . It has been used as a reference antiviral compound for testing the antiviral activities of candidate compounds in several studies. In our pre-and post-viral entry experiments, ribavirin showed less antiviral effect on FIPV, compared to compounds NSC345647, NSC87511, and NSC343256 (EC 50 = 48.87-73.98 \u03bcM). Furthermore, it did not show an antiviral effect in the prophylaxis study.",

The booted forms of lopinavir and ritonavir have exhibited antiviral activities in some clinical cases of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV (Chu et al., 2004; Chan et al., 2003) . It was expected that lopinavir could possibly inhibit 3CL pro activity. However, lopinavir and its derivatives partially inhibited the 3CL pro of SARS-CoV, with IC 50 values of~50 \u03bcM and~25 \u03bcM, respectively (Wu et al., 2004) . We observed that lopinavir effectively inhibited FIPV during the stage of viral entry (EC 50 = 5.38-31.70 \u03bcM). It is possible that lopinavir may have higher inhibitory activity toward other proteases when examined by cellbased experiments. The papain-like protease 1 (PL1 pro ), a common protease of CoV, has a finger-shaped subdomain and a catalytic triad Cys32-Hi-s183-Asp196, which have been found only in the alpha-CoV including FIPV, but absent in beta-CoV (Lei et al., 2018) . For other host proteases such as furin protease, the action of lopinavir might involve the blocking of furin-mediated cleavage during viral entry. Therefore, the mechanism of The interactions are presented as dashed lines for alkyl/\u03c0-alkyl bonds (pink), \u03c0donor (dark blue), \u03c0-\u03c0 stack (black), \u03c0-sigma (yellow), \u03c0-cation (purple), hydrogen bonds (green) and hydrophobic interaction (red circles and ellipses). The ligandprotein interactions are visualized using UCSF Chimera version 1.10.2 and LigPlot software. action of lopinavir on FIPV requires further investigation.",

The binding affinity of this compound to the binding pocket of FIPV 3CL pro was determined as \u22128.3 kcal/mol using the program Autodock Vina.

Some inactive compounds CID5318214, CID3821945, CID5748601, and CID5372747 also inhibited protease activity, but could not control FIPV infection under all the tested conditions.

In the case of post-viral entry, capability of the selected compounds to penetrate through the plasma membrane might be poor. Therefore, intracellular concentration of the compounds was less than the actual amount added in the culture media. For the prophylactic purpose, the compounds stability was very crucial. The antiviral activities of these compounds may be improved by utilizing a special drug delivery system that directs the compounds to macrophages and carries them inside the cells. Recently, nanoparticle-encapsulated drugs have been reported as a cargo for biopharmaceutical delivery to the target cells as well as preventing drug degradation (reviewed by Visser et al., 2019) . On the other hand, modification by adding functional groups such as carboxyl, methyl, acetyl, aldehyde or ketone to the compound can improve their binding affinities, solubility or stability. However, the modification should not decrease their drug-like characteristics. In this study, we have modified the compound NSC87511 by adding a acetyl group as shown in Supplementary Table 3 which strengthened its interaction with the 3C pro binding pocket and might enhance cell permeability.",

Usually, the inhibitors of 3CL pro are designed to facilitate the nucleophilic attack by protease at the carbonyl residue for the formation of a covalent bond with the inhibitor and trap the enzymatic nucleophile, terminating its catalytic activity. The functional groups are commonly termed as 'warheads', which are based on carbonyl groups and contain dipeptidyl residues with different warheads (Tiew et al., 2011; . The dipeptidyl aldehyde contains a carbonyl group with a nucleophile that can donate a pair of electrons. Consequently, hydrolysis of the key catalytic group occurs at the active site of 3CL pro . In this study, we observed that most of the candidate compounds contained an acyl group, which tends to share a lone-pair of electrons to the active site of FIPV 3CL pro . According to our molecular docking analysis, the three best candidate compounds interacted with the His41 or Cys144 and other residues in the binding pocket, mainly through non-covalent bonds. We also evaluated the ADME/T properties, which were useful in prioritizing drug modifications. We observed that NSC87511 and NSC343256 passed the Ro5 and had good 'drug-like' properties of small molecules for refinement into potential oral drugs. However, NSC345647 violated two of the Ro5 filters. Nevertheless, modification of the chemical structures should be able to reduce the undesirable properties and increase the drug-like fragment contents. In our study, the FIPV 3CL pro -compound complexes were mainly stabilized by the non-covalent interactions within the binding pocket. Therefore, besides the affinity of the molecule to its protein target, its chemical structure, especially the properties related to bioavailability and serum albumin binding, should be considered.",
