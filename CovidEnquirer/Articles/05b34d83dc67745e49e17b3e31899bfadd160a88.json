Immunopathol., 26:157-170. Intraepithelial leukocytes (IEL) and splenocytes collected from uninfected and rotavirus-infected chickens were evaluated for cytotoxic activity against a natural killer (NK) cell-susceptible lymphoblastoid cell line (LSCC-RP9) and against rotavirus-infected chick kidney cells in 4-h chromiumrelease assays. Both splenocytes and IEI_a from uninfected and rotavirus-infected chickens were cytotoxic for LSCC-RP9, and the levels of this NK cell activity were not altered by infection of the host with rotavirus. IELs but not splenoeytes from uninfected and rotavirus-infected chickens were cytotoxic for rotavirus-infected but not for uninfected chick kidney cell targets. Because this cytotoxic activity was not induced nor altered by rotavirus infection of the host, and was not major histocompatibility complex-restricted, it was considered to be due to NK cell activity. The cytotoxicity of IELs against rotavirus-infeeted target cells was dose-dependent; however, there was some suppression of cytotoxic activity at high effector to target cell ratios. There were no differences in the cytotoxic activities of IELs collected from the duodenum versus the jejunum. The in vitro cytotoxic activity of IELs against rotavirus-infected target ceils suggested that NK cell activity may be an important immune response to rotavirus infections in vivo. The absence of cytotoxic activity by splenoeytes against rotavirus-infected target cells indicated that there may be different subpopulations of NK cells in the spleen and intestinal epithelium of chickens.",

            "text": "The immune response to rotavirus infections has been the subject of much study since the recognition of the etiological significance of rotaviruses in human and domestic animal diarrheas (Kurstak et al., 1981) . Most of these studies have examined antibody-mediated responses. In mammals, rotavirusspecific intestinal antibodies clearly mediate passive immunity (Offit and Clark, 1985; Archambault et al., 1988) , and are thought to be important in the active immune response to primary (Sheridan et al., 1983; Van Zaane et al., 1986 ) and secondary (Bishop et al., 1986 ) rotavirus infections. However, there is evidence to suggest that mechanisms besides rotavirus-specific intestinal antibodies may participate in recovery and resistance. Clinical studies in humans show that the presence of rotavirus-specific fecal IgA does not always correlate with resistance to diarrhea following challenge (Bernstein et al., 1986) . Also, studies in experimentally infected calves have shown that calves lacking coproantibodies to a heterologous secondary challenge virus can still be protected against developing diarrhea (Bridger and Oldham, 1987) . Furthermore, neonatal nude (athymic) mice are able to recover normally from rotavirus infection despite the inability to mount a T cell or an intestinal antibody response (Eiden et al., 1986) . Conversely, neonatal mice with severe combined immunodeficiency, which are also incapable of normal T and B cell responses, exhibit persistent rotavirus infections following inoculation (Riepenhoff-Talty et al., 1987 ) .",

Offit and Dudzik (1988) have demonstrated MHC-restricted, rotavirus-specific cytotoxic T cell activity in vitro using splenocytes from rotavirus-infected mice at 7 DPI. This cytotoxic activity was directed against target cells infected with rotaviruses either homotypic or heterotopic to the virus inoculum. Kohl et al. (1983) demonstrated that human interferon can induce in vitro NK cell activity of human peripheral blood leukocytes (collected from randomly selected individuals) against rotavirus-infected target cells. In calves, La Bonnardiere et al. (1981) showed that intestinal interferon is produced during rotavirus infection and Van den Broecke et al. (1984) found a correlation between high levels of intestinal interferon and reduced clinical disease. Thus, there is evidence to indicate that cytotoxic T cells, NK cells, and interferon may participate with intestinal antibodies in mediating rotavirus immunity.",

These cultures were trypsinized at 48 h in culture and frozen in liquid nitrogen for use as secondary CKCs. Twenty-four hours prior to their use in a CRA, an ampule of CKCs was thawed, and cells were counted, resuspended at 0.5 \u00d7 106 cells per ml in M25 medium, dispensed into a 96-well fiat-bottomed tissue culture plate (Coming) at 200 Ftl per well, and allowed to grow at 38\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. The next day, cultures in a row of 12 wells were trypsinized and these cells were collected and counted to determine the number of target cells per well (counts averaged about 5 X 104 cells per well). The remaining wells were then washed twice in PBS, and inoculated with 7.5 \u00d7 105 TCIDso Ch2 in 25 ~tl M20 (M25 without FCS) medium (or with 25/~1 M20 medium alone) resulting in an average multiplicity of infection of 15 : 1. Prior to inoculation of cultures, the purified Ch2 virus had been diluted 1:3 in M20 supplemented with 5/~g/ml trypsin and incubated in a 37 \u00b0C waterbath for 1 h. The cultures were incubated at 38 \u00b0C for 1 h, the inoculum was aspirated, and, after washing once with PBS, the wells received 200/~1 of M20. Each well then received 2.5/tCi Na 51CrO4 in 10 #1 M20 and the cultures were incubated at 38\u00b0C for 3 h (Schat and Heller, 1985) . Wells were washed three times in M20 with 30 min between washes. Each well then received 100/zl LM20 just prior to the addition of effector cells. CKC cultures grown on glass coverslips in 24-well tissue culture plates (Coming) in parallel with the 96-well cultures and evaluated with a direct fluorescent antibody assay (Yason and Schat, 1985) demonstrated from 75 to 90% rotavirus-positive cells 5 h post inoculation when the CKC cultures were ready to receive the effector cell suspensions.",

We also demonstrated that the NK activity of splenocytes and IELs measured against LSCC-RP9 cells was not affected by primary rotavirus infection of the host. This was in contrast to work performed by Lillehoj (personal communication) who showed that splenic and IEL NK activity was transiently depressed during the early phase of Eimeria primary infections.

Because this activity was not induced by rotavirus infection of the host and was not MHC-restricted, it was considered by definition to be NK cell rather than cytotoxic T cell activity. Furthermore, it is unlikely that the cytotoxic activity observed in these experiments was due to macrophages or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. IELs isolated by this procedure exhibit the characteristic morphology of lymphocytes but not macrophages (Chai and Lillehoj, 1988 ) . Also, cytotoxic activity in our study was demonstrated for IEL preparations from uninoculated control chickens which were negative for antibodies to rotaviruses. While Kohl et al. (1983) reported NK activity for human peripheral blood leukocytes against rotavirus-infected target cells, our demonstration of IEL cytotoxicity for rotavirus-infected cells extend these findings to suggest that NK cell activity may indeed be an important intestinal response to rotavirus infection. In similar studies, in vitro spontaneous cytotoxic activity has been demonstrated for murine (Carman et al., 1986) and porcine (Cepica and Derbyshire, 1983 ) IELs against emetic coronavirus-infected target cells. Our results were in contrast, however, to the findings of Offit and Dudzik (1988 ) , who demonstrated both primary and secondary (after in vitro stimulation) cytotoxic T cell activity for splenocytes against rotavirus-infected target cells. We were unable to demonstrate rotavirus-specific cytotoxic T cell activity for IELs or splenocytes following primary or secondary infection of the host. This does not necessarily indicate that a cytotoxic T cell response was absent from infected birds. First, the response could be masked by a higher level of NK activity in the splenocyte or IEL preparations. Furthermore, MHC-restricted cytotoxic T cell activity has only been documented for chicken splenocytes against reticuloendotheliosis virus-infected cells (MacCubbin and Schierman, 1986; Weinstock et al., 1989) and has yet to be demonstrated for chicken IELs.",

            "text": "The reduced cytotoxic activity of IELs for rotavirus-infected CKC targets at high E: T ratios suggested there may be a subpopulation of IELs or some factor in the IEL preparations which suppressed NK cytolysis. Lillehoj and Chai ( 1988 ) did not observe reduced NK activity of IELs at high E: T ratios against LSCC-RP9 target cells in 4-h or 16-h assays. However, Mowat et al. (1983) demonstrated that murine IELs could suppress the NK activity of spleen cells, and that this suppression was not mediated by T lymphocytes or macrophages. Further experimentation will be needed to explore and confirm our observation. Chai and Lillehoj (1988) demonstrated that the NK activity of IELs for lymphoblastoid target cells was greater in the jejunum than in the duodenum for the SC strain chickens. We did not observe a difference in NK activity between these two sites using the rotavirus-infected target cell assay. It is unclear if this discrepancy is due to differences between the IELs from the two strains of chickens or to differences between the assay systems. Chai and Lillehoj (1988) commented that the cytotoxic activity of their IEL preparations was critically dependent upon the expeditious handling of intestinal tissues and cell preparations. We observed a similar decrease in cytotoxic activity when tissues or cell suspensions.were not processed quickly. Furthermore, in our assays using rotavirus-infected CKCs, we observed poor cytotoxic activity by IELs if the number of rotavirus-positive CKCs (as demonstrated by the direct fluorescent antibody assay) was less than 50% or if the spontaneous release of chromium was greater than 30% (data not shown). This study did not attempt to determine the importance of NK cell activity to rotavirus immunity in vivo. This question will be difficult to address experimentally in the chicken system. However, the beige mouse, which exhibits a selective impairment of NK function (Roder, 1979 ) , may prove to be a useful model for examining this question.",
