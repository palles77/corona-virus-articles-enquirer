            "text": "For many encephalitis cases, the cause remains unidentifi ed. After 2 children (from the same family) received a diagnosis of acute necrotizing encephalopathy at Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (Tours, France), we attempted to identify the etiologic agent. Because clinical samples from the 2 patients were negative for all pathogens tested, urine and throat swab specimens were added to epithelial cells, and virus isolates detected were characterized by molecular analysis and electron microscopy. We identifi ed a novel reovirus strain (serotype 2), MRV2Tou05, which seems to be closely related to porcine and human strains. A specifi c antibody response directed against this new reovirus strain was observed in convalescent-phase serum specimens from the patients, whereas no response was observed in 38 serum specimens from 38 healthy adults. This novel reovirus is a new etiologic agent of encephalitis.",

            "text": "Orthoreovirus, are nonenveloped double-stranded RNA viruses with a genome composed of 10 segments. These viruses have 3 major serotypes: type 1 Lang (T1L), type 2 Jones (T2J), and type 3 Dearing (T3D), which can be differentiated by neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition tests (1) . A fundamental characteristic of these viruses, because of their segmented genome, is that 2 distinct viruses can infect the same cell and combine their genomes, thus generating novel viruses (2) . The acronym reovirus (respiratory enteric orphan virus) is used to designate viruses isolated from the respiratory and enteric tracts of persons with mild respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms (3) . Although reovirus infection of humans usually induces mild symptoms, infection of newborn mice leads to severe pathologic conditions, such as lethal encephalitis, depending on the inoculation route and strain (4, 5) . Previous studies have described the isolation of 3 reovirus strains after cell culture of cerebrospinal fl uid (CSF) from patients with meningitis: serotype 1 (6), serotype 3 (T3C96) (7) , and serotype 2 (T2W) (8, 9) . The etiologic role of the T2W strain in meningitis could not be ascertained because the patient was co-infected with other agents (8) . Similarly, new mammalian reoviruses, such as BYD1, JP, and BYL, were isolated from throat swab specimens of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (10) . Similarly, Melaka virus (11) , Kampar virus (12) , and HK23629/07 virus (13) were isolated from adults with acute respiratory infection. Here, we report the isolation of a novel human type 2 reovirus (named MRV2Tou05) from 2 children hospitalized with acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE). Virologic, molecular, and serologic methods were used to detect the MRV2Tou05 strain.",

He could respond to simple verbal commands, such as requests to open eyes or make some other movements, but he was lethargic (no articulated language) and had epilepsy-like abnormal movements of the face or distal muscles. For 2 days previously, he had experienced a prodromal illness with high temperature (40\u00b0) and headache. Results of an analysis of CSF on the fi rst day of hospitalization were within normal limits and showed a protein level of 0.81 g/L and 4 leukocytes/mm 3 on day 5. An electroencephalogram showed generalized slow-wave activity. Computed tomography of the brain showed a low-density change in the thalami. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed on the fi rst day of hospitalization showed multiple symmetric lesions, with high signal intensity on T2-weighted images and low signal intensity on T1-weighted images, mostly involving the thalami bilaterally but also the brainstem tegmentum ( Figure 1 , panel A) and cerebral white matter in external capsules. He received treatment in the intensive care unit and was given acyclovir, methylprednisolone, and clonazepam intravenously. Beginning 2 days after he arrived at the hospital, he showed improvement, and he recovered completely in a few weeks. He was discharged on the 25th day of illness. A follow-up brain MRI, 1 year later, showed no abnormal fi ndings. Three years later, his development and neurologic examination results were within normal limits. Patient 2, a 22-month-old girl, was the cousin of patient 1. She was admitted 4 days later, on April 3, 2005, with drowsiness and fever after 1 day of high fever, asthenia, and rhinorrhea. A neurologic examination showed brisk deep tendon refl exes and extensor plantar responses; Glasgow Coma Score was 8. CSF initially showed a slightly elevated protein level (0.55 g/L, reference <0.30 g/L) with no cells, and fi ndings were within normal limits on day 4 of illness (0.38 g/L protein, no cells). Radiologic examinations of the brain showed similar lesions to those of her cousin ( Figure 1, panel B) , and she received the same treatment. She experienced mild hepatomegaly on day 11 of illness. Her condition began to improve on day 7 of illness, and she was discharged from the hospital on day 18, April 20, with marked hypotonia, responsiveness but absence of language, and pyramidal tract signs. One year later, she remained easily tired, with uncoordinated movements. MRI of the brain found that the damage was less visible and the signal was much less marked.",

The virus isolates were then identifi ed as reovirus type 2 by seroneutralization at the National Reference Center for Enteroviruses (Lyon, France). The discrepancy initially observed between immunofl uoresence and RT-PCR results may be attributed to the cross-reactivity of the Pan-Entero Blend reagent toward reoviruses, as mentioned in the manufacturer's description.

Sequence analysis of the 3 large segments, the 3 medium segments, and the S2, S3, and S4 segments indicated overall a close genetic relationship between MRV2Tou05 and swine SC-A viruses and a relationship with the 2 reovirus prototypes 1 and 3 ( Table 2 ). The sequences of the MRV2Tou05 S1 gene showed great diversity at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, compared with the S1 gene from mammalian reoviruses and SC-A strains (Tables 2, 3) . Otherwise, the S3 gene showed high identity with type 2 human reovirus strains ( Table 3 ). The highest identities (83% and 99%) were with type-2 human isolates 302I and 302II from the People's Republic of China (18) and human isolates from the Netherlands (18), respectively, for S1 and S3 genes ( Table  3) .

The viruses commonly involved in encephalitic syndromes were not detected in CSF specimens from both patients. Results of broad virologic investigations for other viruses were also negative. The reovirus isolation and the molecular detection of the specifi c sequences in patients' specimens demonstrated that the 2 hospitalized children with ANE had been exposed to a novel reovirus strain.

Sequence analysis and phylogenetic trees showed that most reovirus segments (L1-L3, M2-M3, S2, and S4) were closely related to the swine reovirus strain (91%-97% identity), except for the S1 and S3 segments. The S1 segment determines the reovirus serotype and encodes the nonstructural protein sigma 1s and the viral cell attachment protein sigma 1. The S1 gene showed a high identity score (83%) with human type 2 strains isolated from fecal specimens of 2 children in China in 1982 (18, 23) . This fi nding was compatible with the results of the neutralization assay performed with the initial infected cell culture supernatant. The S1 segment from reoviruses is highly diverse in size and sequence. This diversity may explain why, even within the same serotype, the S1 segment could not be amplifi ed with a different set of primers initially defi ned by alignment of reovirus serotype 2 strains. The S3 segment is genetically similar to that of the human reovirus strains T2Neth/73 and T2Neth/84 (98% identity) isolated in the Netherlands in 1973 and 1984 (24) . The S3 gene is known to encode the nonstructural protein \u03c3NS (25, 26) , which plays a notable role in the replication of reovirus gene segments and assortment (27, 28) . On the basis of these data, we conclude that the novel type 2 human reovirus, designated MRV2Tou05, might have originated from a reassortment between a human isolate and a swine reovirus, both probably fi rst identifi ed in China.",

It affects children, and clinical and radiologic fi ndings seem identical to ANE, with suddenonset encephalopathy triggered by viral infection including infl uenza. The outcome, however, seems worse, with death, mild to severe developmental regression, and recurrence in half of the survivors (33) . The simultaneous occurrence of the cases described in this study and the familial clustering may suggest either a causative role for MRV2Tou05, the patients' genetic predisposition to such an agent, or both (34) . Investigations are in progress to determine genetic susceptibility in the family.",

They are designated as orphan viruses, and more than half of the adult population possess antibodies directed against reoviruses, which suggests that infection occurs frequently without any specifi c effect on human health. However, reovirus strains have been isolated from persons with serious human diseases (35) . Indeed, an unknown reovirus strain in 1996, the T3C/96 strain in 2004, and the T2W strain in 2006 were isolated and reported from human meningitis patients, which shows that reoviruses can also cause central nervous systemic disease in humans. Melala virus, Kampar virus. and HK2369/07 virus were isolated from patients with acute respiratory infections, and BYD1, JP, and BYL strains of serotype 2 were isolated from patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome. In all these of cases, a reovirus strain with novel molecular characteristics was described, except for the 1996 case, but the characterization of the isolated strain was not reported.",

The reproduction of symptoms in an animal model and in vitro studies of the cellular interactions and apoptosis of MRV2Tou05 are needed to help clarify the exact role of this novel reovirus strain. Identifying the MRV2Tou05 reovirus sequence could contribute to the improvement of ANE diagnosis and treatment, for example, by confi rming susceptibility to viral infection and clarifying the possible role of other common viruses in its pathogenicity.
