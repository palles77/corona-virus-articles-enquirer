The identification and mechanistic dissection of host genetic polymorphisms therefore has powerful implications for our understanding of viral diseases, including the identification of novel therapeutic targets. In this chapter, we review the classical approaches used to identify host allelic variations that regulate disease susceptibility.

As discussed in Chapter 12 (The Virus-Host Interactome), host proteins that promote the survival or replication of a virus are referred to as host factors. With the advent of high-throughput screening technologies, it has become feasible to identify in a single experiment large numbers of host factors that are required to promote viral replication. In addition, high-throughput screens are used to identify constitutive or inducible cellular factors that exhibit antiviral activity (referred to as restriction factors). These high-throughput screens often use genetically deficient yeast or siRNA knockdown technologies. Although in vitro screens allow for the rapid identification of candidate host or restriction factors, an understanding of the role of these factors in viral pathogenesis requires in vivo studies.",

Many of these genes are related to immune responses, such as those involved within the complement pathway or in the development of adaptive immune responses. However, many other host genes influence intrinsic biological activities such as transcription, translation, and intracellular transport. Removal of many of these genes has divergent effects that are dependent upon the virus. A given host gene may play a protective, pathologic, or neutral role during infection, and this will vary between viruses. Individual viruses co-opt divergent host mechanisms, and the specific host response can have radically different results depending upon that interaction.

Much of this progress has come from studies comparing mouse strains with differing susceptibility to specific viral pathogens and the subsequent mapping of the polymorphic genes responsible for strain variation. For example, studies in the 1920s identified mouse strains that differed in their susceptibility to infection by a number of flaviviruses, including West Nile virus and Japanese encephalitis virus, revealing that differential disease responses are driven by a single autosomal-dominant genetic locus. Follow-up studies using positional cloning showed that animals carrying a functional allele of the OAS1b gene are highly resistant to flavirvirus replication (Brinton and Perelygin, 2003) . Similar studies identified mouse genes associated with resistance to influenza virus (Mx1) (Staeheli et al., 1988) and murine cytomegalovirus (Ly49H) (Lee et al., 2001) .",

            "text": "Although there are cases where viral disease outcomes are governed largely as a Mendelian trait, the majority of viral disease traits are much more complex. That is, multiple genetic, environmental, and demographic effects interact to determine an individual's disease response. Furthermore, many of the genetic variants contributing to trait differences are due to polymorphisms that have more moderate effects rather than the extreme phenotypes typically seen with geneknockout approaches (Figure 1 ). Within a polymorphic population, there can be multiple genetic variants affecting the expression and function of a single gene. In this way, three different alleles of the translation factor Eif4E all confer bean plants with some level of resistance to clover yellow vein virus. Importantly, each of these alleles is effective against a different subset of virus strains, showing the complexity of disease responses that can be driven by multiple segregating natural polymorphisms (Hart and Griffiths, 2013) . A statistically complex framework, developed from elegant agricultural experiments over 80 years ago, posited that even if traits are not under strict Mendelian control, those under some form of genetic control must be heritable. That is, individuals who have some resistance to a viral pathogen tend to have offspring that are also somewhat resistant to the same viruses. Assessment of such heritability was initially used to measure the overall impact of host genetic variants on phenotypic traits, then for the selection of favorable traits (more below), and eventually as the basis of genetic mapping approaches.",

            "text": "Effects of natural genetic variation. In contrast to gene knockouts, natural polymorphisms can impact genes in a variety of ways. These include (A) changes in promoter or repressor regions that impact overall RNA expression levels; (B) changes within 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 UTRs that impact translational efficiency; (C) changes in coding sequence that alter protein function, and (D) variation in splice sites that create different isoforms of the protein. Importantly, multiple changes can segregate within the same gene in a population, driving multiple expression and functional differences in disease responses. These types of analyses were enthusiastically applied within the agricultural community and are still heavily used today. Controlled agricultural breeding allows for the explicit choice of breeding pairs, such that the next generation of animals will be enriched for a desired phenotypic trait. By iterating this process over generations, eventually the breeders fix large numbers of genetic variants within this population, and all animals have the advantageous traits of interest. Indeed, this is how milk and meat production, as well as crop yields, are regularly maximized. Also, it was quickly realized that these methods could be applied to disease resistance, such as the breeding of resistance to potato viruses. Furthermore, with the development of a variety of molecular markers, the classical need to use phenotypic markers to aid in the selection of resistant breeders has been reduced, allowing for more robust and rapid approaches. However, such approaches had only limited feasibility within human populations (and were used solely in the assessment of heritability) until mapping approaches were developed.",

            "text": "A key insight from genetic studies is that virus-host interactions and outcomes vary depending upon the virus. For example, the complement pathway is a complex pathway involved in the control of pathogens through several recognition and response arms. Depending on the recognition or response arms activated, differential disease outcomes can result (Stoermer and Morrison, 2011) . As an example, the mannose binding lectin (MBL) complex, which binds sugar moieties on pathogens to activate the complement cascade, exhibits a direct antiviral activity against flaviviruses in part by blocking viral fusion to cells. In contrast, MBL not only fails to protect against Ross River virus (RRV) infection, but MBL deposition within RRV-infected joint and muscle tissue promotes complement activation and subsequent inflammatory tissue destruction (Gunn et al., 2012) . Since the MBL genes are highly polymorphic in humans, and MBL levels correlate with RRV-induced disease severity, genetic variation in human MBL genes may be associated with susceptibility to RRV-induced disease. These types of studies also have important implications for the development of antiviral therapies targeting the complement cascade. Although therapies designed to block complement activation might be beneficial in the case of RRV, this type of intervention might have adverse consequences for individuals infected with West Nile virus or dengue virus. The development of technologies to create gene-specific knockouts, especially in mice, dramatically increased the ability to determine how specific host genes affect viral pathogenesis. Studies using knockout mice have contributed to the identification and characterization of a wide array of host genes that play either protective or pathologic roles during viral infection (Table 1 ). As noted above, components of the host complement cascade play a protective role during West Nile virus infection, but exacerbate RRV-induced arthritis. Similarly, a deficiency in the chemokine receptor CCR2 reduces early stage lung pathology during influenza virus infection, but exacerbates disease following Chikungunya virus infection by altering the inflammatory infiltrate and resultant arthritic disease. Importantly, in addition to providing insights into the role that a specific molecule plays in the pathogenesis of specific viral diseases, these types of studies have revealed important principles about the role of host genes in viral pathogenesis (Sidebar 1).",

ENU is an alkylating agent that induces point mutations in sperm progenitor cells at a predicable frequency. When male mice are treated with ENU and then bred to wild-type female mice (G 1 mice), their offspring carry a subset of the mutations derived from ENU mutagenesis. Through subsequent rounds of breeding, ENU-induced mutations affecting immune phenotypes that drive differential viral disease responses can be identified ( Figure 2 ). Historically, the identification of causal ENU-induced mutations has required a time-and labor-intensive mapping effort. However, with the advent of high-resolution wholeexome or genome sequencing, the efficiency of identifying causal ENU mutations has been significantly enhanced, thereby increasing the ability of this approach to identify genes impacting specific phenotypes. The power of this system is illustrated by the identification of a large number of innate immune genes that modulate the host response to herpesvirus infection, as well as the identification of several nonobvious host factors that regulate homeostasis and protect against viral disease. For example, ENU mutagenesis initially identified UNC93B1 as a mediator of herpesvirus resistance in mice that is essential for signaling via multiple TLRs. Subsequent studies also demonstrated that UNC-93B deficiency in humans is associated with enhanced susceptibility to herpesvirus infection. Multiple ENU-induced mutations within the same gene can have strikingly different effects on phenotype, such as variant mutations affecting TLR signaling (Hoebe, 2009) .",

Individuals are typed at a series of markers (whose positions relative to each other are known), and these individuals are also phenotyped for traits of interest. Whether these are closely related populations (e.g., a large family pedigree of humans or an F2 cross between two inbred strains of animals) or larger population-level association studies, all such studies rely on recombination within gametogenesis to break apart genome structure. As a result, only markers physically close to the polymorphic loci of interest will remain associated or linked throughout the study population. Therefore, at each marker, the significance of the association between the trait values and the two alleles at that marker is determined. When polymorphisms controlling a trait are unlinked to a marker (e.g., they are on different chromosomes), then there will be completely random association between the two variants at the marker and the trait of interest. However, when tested markers exist on the same chromosome as a polymorphism controlling a trait, there will be an increased association of one of the two marker variants and an increase in the trait of interest. Furthermore, for the markers near the traitcontrolling polymorphism, there will be a tighter and tighter association between the marker variant and an increase in the trait of interest. Indeed, with sufficient numbers of individuals, it is possible to identify polymorphisms driving subtle effects. Genetic markers have undergone development from restriction fragment length polymorphisms or micro/ minisatellite markers, to well-annotated single nucleotide Sidebar 1 Key findings from genetic manipulation studies 1. A large number of immune-related genes influence viral pathogenesis either by providing protection or enhancing pathology (Table 1 ).

In this way, a specific virus might interact with multiple sensors within the same pathway. Thus, dissection of such pathways can often require complex experiments and the generation of double (or even triple) knockouts in the same animals 3. Many genes play different roles when interacting with different pathogens. Just as there can be redundant-sensing pathways for some pathogens, the specific molecules that a virus interacts with can modulate disease progression. In this way, abrogation of a specific pathway member can either enhance or ameliorate disease ( polymorphisms (SNPs) or even haplotype reconstructions (a set of tightly clustered heritable polymorphisms). Using current methods, it is possible to more finely identify both the chromosomal locations and the relative linkages between genetic factors. Careful analysis is needed to differentiate multiple genetic variants affecting many traits in close proximity to each other from pleiotropy (a single variant affecting multiple traits). However, analyses of host genetic contributions at specific loci suggest that there are often multiple variants close together that commonly affect a given trait, or set of related traits. For example, many early mapping studies showed that the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus affects a wide variety of immune responses including complement function, B-cell and T-cell responses, and allergic responses. This genome region contains a large number of genes involved in antigen presentation, the complement cascade, innate immune responses, and development all in close physical proximity. Furthermore, as the sequence and annotation of mammalian genomes has progressed, other loci with tightly linked genes of related function have been identified. Such tightly linked genes hint at co-evolutionary pressures, but more practically they create difficulty in identifying specific polymorphic genes influencing phenotypes.",

In order to identify these very tight associations, many markers are necessary. This necessitates incredibly large cohorts of individuals with which to attain statistical significance.

G1 offspring of this mating receive a variety of mutations from the ENU-mutagenized sperm, some of which can confer novel phenotypes, such as susceptibility to a viral pathogen.

Mice offer the most tractable experimental system, in part because of well-developed molecular and genetic methods. Inbred mouse strains can be used to map genome locations contributing to differential disease responses between inbred strains. For certain largeeffect genes, it is possible to identify causal genes contributing to disease differences in these populations. Genes such as Mx1, Oas1b, CEACAM1a, and Cmv-1 (Ly49H) have been identified as major players in specific viral diseases. In addition, inbred mouse strains offer the ability to perform reproducible studies designed to elucidate the mechanisms by which a specific gene impacts disease. Researchers have designed recombinant inbred panels to extend studies using animals with different genetic variants. Classical recombinant inbred (RI) panels (e.g., the C57BL/6J by DBA/2J (BxD) and A/J by C57BL/6J (AxB and BxA)) were derived from pairs of inbred lines. The generation of RI panels is initially identical to the generation of F2 animals for genetic mapping. However, instead of testing these F2 animals for viral disease, pairs of F2 animals are mated with a sibling, and the resultant animals undergo brother-sister mating until a set of new inbred lines are derived from this initial cross (Figure 4) . Each new inbred line in this panel has an inbred genome composed of different segments from each of the two founder inbred lines. Furthermore, since each new inbred line is generated from two unique F2 animals, each one of the new RI lines has private recombination events. In this way, a panel of recombinant inbred lines provides a large number of inbred and reproducible mouse lines that are all related to each other. Each set of lines shares a subset of polymorphisms they By crossing F2 animals, followed by inbreeding (B) classical recombinant inbred panels can be generated. These panels are sets of lines all derived from common ancestors, but containing unique haplotype combinations of these founder lines, and allow for the assessment of genetic effects across time points, treatments, and conditions of viral infections. In order to better model the genetic diversity and complexity present within the human population, the Collaborative Cross panel (C), derived from eight classical inbred founder strains, was bred from a complex funnel design to incorporate genetic information from each founder line within each CC line. Following this funnel breeding, a large number of unique lines are generated and can be used for experimental analysis and genetic mapping of complex traits. received in common from the two founder lines, while at other loci they have different polymorphisms. Therefore, a whole RI panel can be used to conduct genetic mapping, or individual lines within a panel can be used to study specific aspects of viral disease. A major advantage of RI panels is the ability to compare or contrast treatments across time points or viral infections. For example, use of the BxD panel to compare host responses to highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus and a less-pathogenic H1N1 influenza virus identified completely different polymorphic host loci controlling exacerbated disease. A major host genetic locus driving H5N1 susceptibility is a defective Hc (hemolytic complement) allele present within the DBA/2J strain. However, this defective Hc allele has no effect on disease responses following H1N1 infection.",

They also show the importance of understanding both the basal (uninfected) status of the immune system as well as how different viruses interact with specific variant host pathways to influence disease outcome. This was shown in a study of the whole-genome transcriptional responses of C57BL/6J and DBA/2J lines before and after H5N1 infection (Boon et al., 2009) . Whereas many transcripts are commonly regulated in response to infection between these two lines, over one-third of transcripts have baseline differential expression between the two strains. Furthermore, approximately half of the genes are underneath quantitative trait loci (QTL) driving differential H5N1 responses. Therefore, high-priority candidates are primarily differentiated by basal expression differences versus differences in induction between strains. Such analyses significantly improve the identification of \"core\" immune or cellular responses that respond to viruses across genetic backgrounds. For instance, there are over 1800 transcripts that are commonly regulated following H5N1 infection of C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice.

These genetic details have two main advantages over other approaches. First, instead of genetic mapping based on individual SNPs, mapping can be conducted on founder haplotypes. In this way, false-positive associations between genome regions and phenotypes are reduced, true associations increase in significance, and it is possible to rapidly narrow QTL regions down to a smaller number of likely candidate genes and features. In a study of H1N1 influenza virus infection of a progenitor population of CC animals, these approaches identified sets of high-priority candidate genes driving differential host responses, and showed that multiple antiviral Mx1 alleles segregating within this population can differentiate antiviral and clinically protective disease responses (Ferris et al., 2013) . Second, this genomic sequence and composition information is critical for correctly assessing microarray and RNA-seq data, avoiding misaligned sequences from RNA-seq, and correctly assessing microarray probes that are impacted by SNPs.",

However, several F1 crosses between CC lines develop a severe Ebola virus disease, including hepatic involvement, coagulation defects, and rapid mortality.

These approaches integrate a variety of data types with whole-genome measures of transcription and translation to better understand the complex networks and pathways that are altered during infection, specifically targeting those that are causative for hostmediated protection or disease exacerbation. In addition to the genetic mapping approaches described above, genetic reference populations provide a novel and powerful overlay to systems biology approaches. Integrating variant disease pathologic, virologic, and transcriptional responses to virus infection, across a range of genetically distinct host backgrounds, allows for the direct assessment of the role of genetic variation on host response networks ( Figure 5 ). Systems genetics incorporates genetic complexity to explain differential disease responses. An advantage of genetically tractable, yet complex experimental systems such as RI panels, is the ability to explicitly integrate host genetic (A), virologic (B), and transcriptional responses (C) in order to identify polymorphic genetic loci (D) that contribute to differential virologic responses, and to develop transcriptional networks (E) that shed mechanistic insight into these polymorphic responses.",

These studies have shown the need for sophisticated approaches to identify, manipulate, and characterize genetic variants contributing to complex responses. It is clear that many polymorphisms underlying complex diseases are pleiotropic (a single polymorphism impacts multiple aspects of the disease response), epistatic (some responses occur only when an individual has multiple interacting polymorphisms), and epigenetic (polymorphisms that either influence, or are activated or repressed by, genome modifications such as methylation). Gene deletion approaches have allowed for the dissection of pleiotropic gene responses (e.g., many gene knockouts ameliorate weight loss and inflammation, but have no effect on viral titers; others have an effect on viral titers, but not on weight loss or inflammatory responses). However, it is only with the advent of the large next-generation genetic reference populations that epistatic interactions can reliably be detected. Such systems allow for the induction, characterization, and manipulation of epigenetic states, clarifying the role and mechanisms of epigenetic responses in complex viral diseases.",

The anti-influenza effects of Ifitm3 were then recapitulated in cell culture and with a knockout mouse model. That said, it remains unclear how often mouse knockouts will successfully translate to human polymorphisms.
