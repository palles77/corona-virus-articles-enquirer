Guidelines in many countries recommend antiviral treatment for older people and individuals with comorbidity at increased risk of complications. However, antivirals are not often prescribed in primary care in Europe, partly because its clinical and cost effectiveness has been insufficiently demonstrated by non-industry funded and pragmatic studies. Methods and analysis Antivirals for influenza-Like Illness? An rCt of Clinical and Cost effectiveness in primary CarE is a European multinational, multicentre, open-labelled, nonindustry funded, pragmatic, adaptive-platform, randomised controlled trial. Initial trial arms will be best usual primary care and best usual primary care plus treatment with oseltamivir for 5 days. We aim to recruit at least 2500 participants \u22651 year presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI), with symptom duration \u226472 hours in primary care over three consecutive periods of confirmed high influenza incidence. Participant outcomes will be followed up to 28 days by diary and telephone. The primary objective is to determine whether adding antiviral treatment to best usual primary care is effective in reducing time to return to usual daily activity with fever, headache and muscle ache reduced to minor severity or less. Secondary objectives include estimating costeffectiveness, benefits in subgroups according to age (<12, 12-64 and >64 years), severity of symptoms at presentation (low, medium and high), comorbidity (yes/no), duration of symptoms (\u226448 hours/>48-72 hours), complications (hospital admission and pneumonia), use of additional prescribed medication including antibiotics, use of over-the-counter medicines and self-management of ILI symptoms. Ethics and dissemination Research ethics committee (REC) approval was granted by the NRES Committee South Central (Oxford B) and Clinical Trial Authority (CTA) approval by The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. All participating countries gained national REC and CTA approval as required. Dissemination of results will be through peer-reviewed scientific journals and conference presentations. trial registration number ISRCTN27908921; Preresults.",

Annual influenza epidemics account for considerable morbidity and mortality, 1-4 and influenza outbreaks have the potential to become pandemics. 2 Effective control and management of seasonal and pandemic influenza is a high priority for national governments. Routine use of antiviral agents is rare in European primary care. 5 General practitioners (GPs) in Europe generally advise patients who consult with influenza-like illness (ILI) to take paracetamol or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, either as required or at regular intervals. They may also provide advice about other overthe-counter (OTC) medicines and self-management of ILI symptoms, for example, maintaining fluids, bed rest and taking time off work or school. This broad approach is currently considered best usual care for the empirical management of ILI in Europe. [6] [7] [8] Currently, the most suitable antiviral agent available for pragmatic evaluation in Antivirals for influenza-Like Illness? An rCt of Clinical and Cost effectiveness in primary CarE (ALIC 4 E) is oseltamivir (Tamiflu), a neuraminidase inhibitor (NI). The US Food and Drug Administration approved oseltamivir in 1999. Oseltamivir was classified by WHO as an essential medicine until 2017, 9 10 and many countries have stockpiles of the drug to ensure it is readily available to treat seasonal and pandemic influenza. 5 Oseltamivir could therefore be used for the management of ILI on assumption that many cases of ILI may be caused by influenza, the probability of this being higher during confirmed periods of heightened influenza based on national reports of ILI consultations and laboratory-confirmed influenza cases.",

            "text": "Oseltamivir phosphate is an oral prodrug which undergoes hydrolysis by hepatic esterase to form active oseltamivir carboxylate. Oseltamivir carboxylate acts by selective inhibition of influenza A and B viral neuraminidases. This enzyme normally promotes release of the virus from infected cells by cleaving terminal sialic acid residues on the surface of host cells and influenza virus envelopes and facilitates viral movement within the respiratory tract. By blocking the activity of the enzyme, oseltamivir prevents new viral particles from being released. 11 12 Oseltamivir might also modify the immune response to influenza infection by reducing levels of proinflammatory cytokines which might, in turn, modulate symptoms of influenza. 13 Industry-sponsored trials (or studies), efficacy studies and clinical study reports of NIs, most often oseltamivir, have been the subject of many systematic reviews and meta-analyses, including individual patient meta-analyses. [14] [15] [16] In two recent meta-analyses that differed in their methods and the primary outcome measures used, but that included almost the same set of trials, Jefferson et al found that oseltamivir improved the mean time to first alleviation of symptoms over the placebo by 16.8 hours, 13 and Dobson et al found that oseltamivir improved the median time to alleviation of all symptoms over the placebo by 17.8 hours 15 . The reviewers also found that oseltamivir reduced the risk of self-reported, non-verified pneumonia but not for clinically diagnosed pneumonia. 13 15 Dobson et al furthermore indicated that treatment with oseltamivir might reduce the risk of lower respiratory tract infection complications and hospitalisation in patients testing positive for influenza. 15 However, increased nausea and vomiting were found to be associated with oseltamivir use. 13 15 Even with a possible reduction in symptom duration (compared with a placebo), the value of oseltamivir treatment of previously healthy individuals with non-severe seasonal influenza is questionable. Conversely, circumstances of some individuals, for example, those urgently needing to return to work and parents and other carers, may mean that a reduction in function-limiting symptoms of a day may be considered very worthwhile. The UK Academy of Medical Sciences recently reviewed current evidence, and they advised that additional pragmatic trials in primary care and cost-effectiveness analyses that take virulence and severity of the circulating strain into account are required to further inform such judgements. 17 Since 1999, oseltamivir has generated sales in excess of US$18bn (\u00a311bn; \u20ac13bn). The USA stockpiled 65 million treatments at a cost of US$1.3bn. The UK spent \u00a3424m on a stockpile of 40 million doses. By 2009, 96 countries possessed enough oseltamivir for 350 million people. 18 In 2017, WHO downgraded oseltamivir in the list of essential medicines from a 'core' drug to one that is 'complimentary'-a category of drugs considered less cost-effective. 9 10 However, there has never been a large-scale, international, publicly funded, pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT) of its cost-effectiveness in primary care, and so the evidence base either to support or not support the routine use of this agent in primary care is inadequate and raises the question: does the effect found in previous efficacy studies translate into a meaningful benefit in every day primary care? Specifically, what are the overall costs and benefits of this possible shortened symptom duration from the perspective of the individual sufferer, the health services and for society? Do patients considered to be at higher risk for complications of influenza (for example, due to age, duration and severity of symptoms or relevant comorbidity) benefit more from antiviral treatment in primary care? Answering these questions will reduce important clinical uncertainty for primary care clinicians about whether to prescribe antiviral agents for ILI and whether or not to prioritise antiviral treatment for subgroups of primary care patients.",

Emergency randomisation procedures will be available should this web-based facility be temporarily unavailable. Randomisation will initially be a 1:1 ratio between the two arms, with stratification by subgroup according to ECDC definitions of those at higher risk of complications from influenza, namely their age (<12, 12-64 and >64 years), severity of symptoms (low, medium and high), any relevant comorbidity i (yes/no) and duration of symptoms i Heart disease/diabetes/chronic respiratory condition (eg, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)/hepatic, hematological, neurological or neurodevelopmental condition/stroke or transient ischaemic Open access since onset (\u226448 hours/>48-72 hours). The proportions randomised to study arms may be altered during the course of the trial following a prespecified Bayesian, response adaptive approach. 26 ALIC 4 E is an open trial. The participant, the recruiting clinician and the study personnel will be aware of the participant's allocation. An open pragmatic trial was chosen because this design is better for determining effects in routine care when patients are much less tightly supervised. Estimates of effect from placebo-controlled efficacy trials may not translate into similar effect sizes when interventions are taken up into routine clinical care. Knowledge of what medication one is taking influences help-seeking behaviour, and decisions to reconsult may substantially affect cost-effectiveness. In addition, efficacy estimates have already been repeatedly determined in efficacy trials with tightly controlled inclusion criteria, in which children, the elderly and people with comorbidities have been under-represented. 27 Clinicians do not prescribe placebos in routine care, and so the credible comparator is current best practice. 28 Therefore, no unblinding or code breaking is required in the event of a relevant emergency. However, the trial team will be blind to treatment allocation at the aggregate level. The recruiter will promote equipoise for the participant about the attack/overnight hospital admission in the last year. two arms which will be carefully covered in trial-specific training, and each arm of the trial will be supported as in routine practice; previous open pragmatic trials have been able to minimise placebo effects using this approach. 29 30 Intervention Participants randomised to best usual primary care plus oseltamivir arm will be given a dose of 75 mg oseltamivir two times per day for 5 days by the oral route (capsules) for those \u226513 years. For those who are \u22651 year but <13 years, the doses will be two times per day for 5 days in suspension, administered orally, according to weight: 10-15 kg=30 mg, >15-23 kg=45 mg, >23-40 kg=60 mg and >40 kg=75 mg. Children weighing >40 kg and who are able to swallow capsules may receive treatment with the adult dosage of 75 mg capsules two times per day for 5 days as an alternative to the same dose of oseltamivir suspension. Route of administration, dosage and treatment periods follow the manufacturer's summary of product characteristics. 12 Weight will be measured in children \u226412 years during the recruitment visit for medication dosing. All other participants will be asked about their weight at the baseline assessment and measured in case of uncertainty.

In addition, platform trial designs can incorporate response adaptive randomisation in order to randomise more participants to the best performing interventions during the course of the trial. This can increase statistical power and efficiency of the trial, as well as lead to better patient outcomes over the course of the study. 34 We chose an adaptive platform trial design because it provided flexibility to evaluate additional interventions in the trial, should interventions emerge that are suitable to pragmatic evaluation in primary care. Additionally, the design provides the ability to prospectively identify particular subgroups of interest that may receive benefit from antiviral agents, as opposed to estimating a single overall effect. This is done by incorporating a Bayesian modelling approach, combined with response adaptive randomisation based on prespecified participant characteristics.

By including a 'best usual primary care' arm, our study will determine the added benefit of antiviral agents over and above current practice for seasonal and potentially pandemic influenza. This information will be of great importance to the delivery of primary care for ILI, as well as enhance the evidence base around advocating self-care. In many countries, patients with ILI symptoms are advised not to consult but to self-manage, and patients with additional risk factors are seldom routinely treated with an antiviral agent.

ALIC 4 E aims to recruit over three winter/influenza seasons in 15 countries, thereby obtaining widely applicable data allowing us to determine whether any benefit or otherwise of antiviral agents is influenced by season. Furthermore, the aim is to include a wide age-range of participants from many different settings, as well as those with comorbidities. Additionally, in the event of an influenza pandemic, or should additional intervention arms be included, a decision could be made to increase the maximum sample size.",

Recruitment into a particular arm can be stopped once a predetermined level of certainty about the effectiveness or non-effectiveness of treatment in that arm has reached a predefined estimated precision. Adaptive randomisation could increase the chances of participants being allocated to arms where their information will be most useful and to the intervention that is most effective for them. This can lead to better patient care and better patient outcomes as the trial progresses. Second, the platform design allows new intervention arms to be added to the trial, benefiting from comparisons with existing treatment arms in a head to head way. This flexibility extends to a potential pandemic situation where additional or alternative interventions may be added according to governmental or public health recommendations. In this way, the study will remain current and relevant to clinical practice and evolving circumstances throughout.",
