Thus, we characterized asymptomatic and symptomatic HRV infections by incidence, species diversity, and viral load of 502 university students during September and October of 2010 and 2011 from nasal swabs and electronically submitted symptom questionnaires. We tested all symptomatic students and randomly sampled participants who remained asymptomatic (n = 25/week, over 8 weeks each study year) on a weekly basis by real-time PCR and sequenced HRV positives. HRV was identified in 33/400 (8.3%) and 85/92 (92.4%) of the asymptomatic and symptomatic students, respectively. We identified a higher than previously reported rate of HRV-B in both groups, although the distribution of HRV species was similar (P = 0.37). Asymptomatic viral load averaged 1.2 log 10 copies/mL lower than symptomatic HRV (P b 0.001). In conclusion, asymptomatic HRV activity preceded peak symptomatic activity in September and October and was associated with lower viral load.",

Surveillance of 15 children ages 1-9 years over a 12-month period identified 20% of children with asymptomatic HRV infections over 1 year (Peltola et al., 2008; Brownlee and Turner, 2008; Greenberg, 2011) . In children 3 months to 15 years old, incidence of symptomatic HRV was 6 infections per year (Winther et al., 2006) . The incidence of asymptomatic HRV has not been reported in adult populations; however, the incidence of symptomatic HRV is estimated to be 2-3 infections per person per year (Madigan et al., 2003) . Rates of asymptomatic HRV have varied in the literature, and direct comparisons are difficult because of differences in the study population (most populations observed are children), in the definition of an asymptomatic episode, and in the detection method utilized (Jartti et al., 2004; Johnston et al., 1993; Kusel et al., 2006; Mackay, 2008; Nokoso-Koivisto et al., 2002; Peltola et al., 2008; van Benten et al., 2003; Winther et al., 2006) .

HRV incidence rates were calculated to be 8.3%/week and 1.9%/week for asymptomatic and symptomatic students, respectively. To our knowledge, our study is the first to determine the incidence of asymptomatic HRV infection in an adult population. In cases of symptomatic HRV, incidence has been documented at 1.6 colds/9 months per student (Brownlee and Turner, 2008; Picornavirus Study Group, 2013) . The weekly distributions of HRV illustrated that asymptomatic HRV peaked just prior to the symptomatic infections. This suggests that there is a relationship between the incidence of asymptomatic infections and the spread of symptomatic illness in the community. Partial sequencing of the VP1 gene determined that the distribution of HRV species was similar in both populations, indicating that species may not account for the presence or absence of symptoms. A larger study would be necessary to confirm this finding as we only identified 11 episodes of HRV-C (2 asymptomatic and 9 symptomatic) in our student cohorts. Interestingly, when we investigated a cohort of hospitalized children with respiratory illness during the same time frame, we identified a higher proportion of HRV-C (Granados, 2012) . The lower number of HRV-Cs identified in our student cohort may indicate that HRV-C infections are more common in children than in healthy adults, as previously suggested by Bochkov and Gern (2012) . In our study, HRV-B was identified at a higher frequency than has been previously reported (Watanabe et al., 2010; Xiang et al., 2010) . In 271 adults presenting with URTI, 25% were infected with HRV-B and HRV-C and had a lower percentage of URTI symptoms compared to HRV-A (\u03c7 2 = 7.18; P b 0.05) (Xiang et al., 2010) .

In 73 symptomatic events, a viral etiology could not be identified; this could be accounted for by symptoms confused for allergic events or a viral pathogen that could not be detected by the xTAG\u2122 RVP assay. Our study period only looked at September and October when HRV is most frequently detected in North America. To accurately estimate the annual rate of asymptomatic HRV incidence, surveillance throughout the year would need to be conducted. We utilized an absolute quantitation method to determine the amount of virus. Differences in methodology and imprecision among any quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay make direct comparisons between reports difficult to conduct unless digital qPCR is conducted. While previous studies have shown that self-sampling with flocked nasal swabs has consistent quality, our viral load results should not be directly compared with previous studies (Smieja et al., 2010) . The identification of symptoms is subjective, and there is a risk that some students had such minimal symptoms that they did not perceive and report any, whereas others may have low tolerance and would report symptoms. In order to minimize reporting bias, all participants were required to submit self-collected nasal swabs weekly regardless of symptom status as it became a weekly activity. Additionally, during the weekly visits, study staff could confirm that any symptoms were properly recorded.",
