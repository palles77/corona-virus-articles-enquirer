TGEV, like PEDV, is found only in swine, can survive on fomites, and can cause high mortality rates in pigs <2 weeks of age. TGEV has been found in the US domestic swine industry since the 1940s. We found TGEV-positive feral swine throughout the entire sampling period and throughout the United States ( Figure; online Technical Appendix Tables 1, 2), suggesting that TGEV is probably being persistently transmitted among feral swine, although continual spillover from domestic swine cannot be ruled out. Whether PEDV will display a similar pattern of endemicity over time is unknown; however, our data did not suggest continual transmission or high seroprevalence. For example, the most recent PEDVseropositive feral swine in Hawaii was detected in January 2015. Seventy-six feral swine sampled from the same island after that date were seronegative, suggesting that either seroprevalence was low enough to evade detection or that viral transmission burned out, most likely after initial deaths of susceptible piglets. Research in Asia, however, has found higher PEDV exposure in wild boar, reinforcing that animals can survive infection and raising the possibility of continual transmission in nondomestic swine populations (6) .",

The 4 positive feral swine samples from California were collected in September 2014 from adult animals in Santa Clara County. In Hawaii, seropositive feral swine were detected on Oahu and Kauai (Figure). Hawaii confirmed its first case of PEDV in domestic swine on Oahu in November 2014, but our findings identified a PEDV-positive feral swine sample collected in April 2014, before detection in domestic swine on the same island. This finding suggests initial PEDV introduction into domestic pigs in Hawaii might have gone undetected for 7 months before the first confirmed case. The 4 PEDV-positive feral swine samples from Hawaii were collected at 4 different times.",

            "text": "To the Editor: We read with interest the article by Kajon et al. (1) , which highlighted that human adenovirus type 4 might be an underrecognized cause of acute respiratory disease (ARD) outside military settings. We report that human adenovirus B7 (HAdV-B7) might also be a cause of this disease.HAdV-B7 is well recognized as a causative agent of neonatal disease and infections in immunocompromised patients. However, we identified an unusual cluster of 4 cases of severe ARD caused by this pathogen in immunocompetent adults in Dublin, Ireland. These patients had acute respiratory illness when they came to the emergency department of Mater Misericordiae University Hospital in Dublin. The patients came to the hospital over a 4-week period during the summer of 2017, and each patient required intensive care support for single-organ failure. Three patients required intubation and ventilation; all 4 patients recovered.Three patients reported gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms, as seen in Oregon, USA (2). Although coinfection with other viruses or bacteria has been described (3), only 1 patient in our cluster had a possible concomitant pathogen. None of the 4 patients were given antiviral therapy but all received antimicrobial drugs.All 4 case-patients were either homeless or in temporary accommodations for homeless adults, but we did not identify any epidemiologic link. The Department of Public Health and temporary accommodation sites were notified to raise awareness and offer early testing of symptomatic persons. However, no additional cases were identified.HAdV-B7 was identified by BLAST analysis (https:// blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) of viral hexon genes (4). Each virus had 100% identity within the region sequenced to a strain previously associated with respiratory illness in a military training camp in China (GenBank accession no. KP896481).This cluster of HAdV-B7 causing severe ARD in immunocompetent adults appears to have no clear epidemiologic link. We agree that HAdV might be an underrecognized pathogen in severe communityonset ARD. Testing for viral respiratory pathogens should be considered in all patients and not just the immunocompromised.",
