A total of 134 herds were tested twice, six months apart. The herds were classified as positive for BRSV if at least one animal between 150 and 365 days old tested positive for antibodies against BRSV, thereby representing herds that had most likely had the virus present during the previous year. The prevalence of positive herds at the first and second sampling was 34 per cent and at 41 per cent, respectively, but varied greatly between regions. Negative herds were found in close proximity to positive herds. Some of these herds remained negative despite several new infections nearby. Of the herds initially being negative, 42 per cent changed status to positive during the six months. This occurred at the same rate during summer as winter, but a higher rate of animals in the herds was positive if it took place during winter. Of the herds initially being positive, 33 per cent changed to negative. This indicates that an effective strategy to lower the prevalence and the impact of BRSV could be to employ close surveillance and place a high biosecurity focus on the negative herds.",

            "text": "In areas where vaccination is rarely used, which is the case in Norway, the prevalence of BRSV infection at herd level, or in a population, is usually based on the detection of antibodies in serum or milk from a group of animals in the herd. The prevalence is usually found to be high (Elvander 1996 , Paton and others 1998 , Uttenthal and others 2000 , Gulliksen and others 2009 , Ohlson and others 2010 . Such screenings have some disadvantages; animals will remain seropositive for several years after an infection. Additionally, calves that receive colostrum from seropositive cows will also be positive. Most dairy calves will not have detectable maternal antibodies after the age of five months others 1986, Uttenthal and others 2000) . Serological methods, therefore, have low specificity for distinguishing between animals or herds with ongoing infection versus the past. The ideal method to describe the occurrence of BRSV would be to detect the virus. However, infected animals do not have the virus circulating in the blood, they shed the virus for a short time period and the laboratory methods for detection are expensive. This means that large-scale studies on the prevalence of herds with ongoing or recent infection of BRSV are challenging, which has, in turn, led to a lack of knowledge on the spreading pattern of BRSV. Factors, such as rate of new introduction to herds, elimination rate, seasonal pattern and virus reservoir are not well described.",

            "text": "More extensive serological studies where herds are classified according to BRSV status should be based on an investigation of animals chosen with the intent to reduce the possible time period between sampling and infection. The number of animals needed to classify the herds correctly as infected or not will rely on several factors, one of the main ones being the within-herd prevalence. Generally, BRSV is reported to give high morbidity due to the rapid spread of the virus within herds causing high within-herd prevalence (Rossi and Kiesel 1974 , Stott and others 1980 , Verhoeff and van Nieuwstadt 1984 . Bidokhti and others (2009) found the mean within-herd prevalence of adult animals to be 70 per cent and 93 per cent in herds tested twice, also showing that the seropositivity increased with age. If the within-herd prevalence is 70 per cent and an ELISA with a sensitivity of 94.6 per cent and specificity of 100 per cent is used, it can be calculated by the methods described by Martin and others (1992) that the sensitivity at the herd level will be 66, 89, 96, 99 and 100 per cent, respectively, when one to five animals are included. With a withinherd prevalence of 93 per cent, it will be 88 per cent and 99 per cent for one and two animals sampled, and 100 per cent if three or more are sampled. A study by H\u00e4gglund and others (2006) suggested conducting such studies by using three animals in each herd.",

            "text": "The study was designed as a repeated, cross-sectional survey and performed between June 2004 and December 2006. In order to cover all parts of Norway, 30 veterinary districts across the country were selected. The selection of districts was based on geographic location, animal density and that the veterinarians in the district had a health service agreement with The Norwegian Cattle Health Services (NDHRS). The 30 districts represented herds from 16 out of the 19 Norwegian counties. Dairy herds recorded in the NDHRS as having at least 15 cow-years were included for further random sampling. One cow-year is the sum of the total of individual feed days for all cows in a herd over the course of a calendar year divided by 365. Herds located in the selected districts were stratified according to herd size in the following four groups: (1) herds with 15-24.9 cow-years (n=1807); (2) herds with 25-49.9 cow-years (n=568); (3) herds with 50-99.9 cowyears (n=62); (4) herds with more than 100 cow-years (n=6). Using random computer sampling (SAS V.9.1), on principle, two herds were selected from each district in the first group, four in the second group, two in the third group and all herds in the fourth group (Gulliksen and others 2009 Vaccination against BRSV had not been performed in any of the study herds. In each herd, blood from an average of five calves was collected on two occasions. There was some variation in the number of tested calves due to practical circumstances such as number of available calves at the time of sampling (distribution shown in Table 1 ). The calves were aged 0-365 days, and the animals were randomly selected at each sampling. This gave a total of 1348 blood samples collected from 1294 calves. Of the samples, 470 were from calves less than 150 days old. Out of these, 159 samples from 157 calves tested positive for antibodies to BRSV. They were excluded from analysis to prevent misclassification caused by the presence of maternal antibodies. The calves less than 150 days old with negative antibody titre were included. Finally, this gave a total of 1189 samples collected from 1137 calves included in the analysis. In each herd, the two samplings were performed approximately 6 months apart. In 17 of the 134 herds, samples were only available from one sampling for different reasons, for example, too few available animals, or farmers closing down their activities.",

The exclusion of the positive animals less than 150 days old reduced the number of tested animals in some herds. Three or more calves were included on 93 per cent of the occasions.

Uttenthal and others (2000) found that maternal antibodies of dairy calves are not likely to be detected after five months. Baker and others (1986) found an average duration of 3.2 months, but up to 6.8 months in some animals. Maternal antibodies are reported to last longer in beef than dairy cattle, with an average of 6.1 (Fulton and others 2004) . In the present study, only dairy herds were included.

One factor that can give false negative results is that presence of maternal antibodies in young calves might depress the natural development of immunity after infection. Kimman and others (1987) and Uttenthal and others (2000) conclude that maternal antibodies markedly suppress the humoral immune response, leading to shorter duration of humoral immunity. This might give false negative results in individuals that are tested serologically. Their conclusions are based on investigation of a relatively low number of calves observed for a short period of time, leaving questions on how the antibody titre will develop further. The laboratory methods were also different from the ones used in the present study, leaving questions open as to exactly what degree this impairment will influence the test strategy used in the present study. The degree of impairment of the humoral response is also likely to be affected by the level of maternal antibodies of each individual; the lower the level of maternal antibodies, the less impairment. It is possible that some animals were falsely classified as negative in the present study, but the number and age dispersion of the calves used to classify the herds makes it unlikely that this applies to many herds.",

This was probably due to the fact that these samples were only collected in areas with a low prevalence of BRSV. When comparing the results of the serum and bulk milk sampling, the majority of herds positive on bulk tank milk were negative based on serological analysis. Ninety-seven percent of the herds that were negative on bulk tank milk samples were also negative on serology, and bulk tank milk is therefore convenient for the classification of negative herds.",

The counties with the highest cattle density generally had a higher proportion of positive herds, but no link was found between herd size and the risk of being classified as positive. A previous study in Norway (Norstr\u00f6m and others 1999) found that the risk of transmission of respiratory disease between herds was high. Nevertheless, in the present study, there are examples of counties with herds in all categories close together: negative herds, positive herds, as well as herds initially being negative changing to positive and herds initially positive changing to negative. This pattern is also seen in several smaller geographical districts. Thus, the herds grouped within a restricted area do not necessarily change infection status in the same direction. In one of the counties (Fig 1, number 15) , the classification status of the herds is especially complex, with all types of classifications present within a small area. In another small district (Fig  1, northern part of county number 7) a clinical outbreak of respiratory disease was registered and most herds were infected. In spite of this, one herd stayed negative throughout the epidemic, which demonstrates that a herd can keep its negative status without immunity despite an ongoing epidemic in the area.",

These findings contrast with the findings of Van der Poel and others (1993) who found that the highest incidence of primary infection was in the autumn or winter season. Baker and others (1997) also report that there is a peak occurrence of BRSV infections in the autumn and winter, and that primary infection in other seasons is rare. The fact that new infections occur throughout the summer could explain how the virus can survive between winter seasons. There is some uncertainty about these results as the samples were collected only every sixth month. Interestingly, it was also found that the introduction of BRSV into a herd in the winter leads to a higher proportion of seropositive animals than such introduction in the summer. This is in accordance with more clinical outbreaks taking place during winter due to higher infectious pressure because of indoor housing with tighter relations between animals, poor ventilation and high humidity (Stott and others 1980, H\u00e4gglund 2005) . In the summer, the infectious pressure is likely to be low and, consequently, fewer animals are likely to be infected in the herd, resulting in less clinical disease.",

Given the high volatility herd infection status and the close proximity between negative and positive herds, individual examination of each herd may be necessary. Further studies with the inclusion of a higher number of animals in each herd, and a higher number of herds in an area, are necessary.",
