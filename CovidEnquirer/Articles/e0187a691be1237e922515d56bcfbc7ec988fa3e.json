            "text": "Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, known as favism, is classically manifested by hemolytic anemia in human. More recently, it has been shown that mild G6PD deficiency moderately affects cardiac function, whereas severe G6PD deficiency leads to embryonic lethality in mice. How G6PD deficiency affects organisms has not been fully elucidated due to the lack of a suitable animal model. In this study, G6PD-deficient Caenorhabditis elegans was established by RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown to delineate the role of G6PD in animal physiology. Upon G6PD RNAi knockdown, G6PD activity was significantly hampered in C. elegans in parallel with increased oxidative stress and DNA oxidative damage. Phenotypically, G6PD-knockdown enhanced germ cell apoptosis (2-fold increase), reduced egg production (65% of mock), and hatching (10% of mock). To determine whether oxidative stress is associated with G6PD knockdown-induced reproduction defects, C. elegans was challenged with a short-term hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ). The early phase egg production of both mock and G6PD-knockdown C. elegans were significantly affected by H 2 O 2 . However, H 2 O 2 -induced germ cell apoptosis was more dramatic in mock than that in G6PD-deficient C. elegans. To investigate the signaling pathways involved in defective oogenesis and embryogenesis caused by G6PD knockdown, mutants of p53 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways were examined. Despite the upregulation of CEP-1 (p53), cep-1 mutation did not affect egg production and hatching in G6PD-deficient C. elegans. Neither pmk-1 nor mek-1 mutation significantly affected egg production, whereas sek-1 mutation further decreased egg production in G6PD-deficient C. elegans. Intriguingly, loss of function of sek-1 or mek-1 dramatically rescued defective hatching (8.3-and 9.6fold increase, respectively) induced by G6PD knockdown. Taken together, these findings show that G6PD knockdown reduces egg production and hatching in C. elegans, which are possibly associated with enhanced oxidative stress and altered MAPK pathways, respectively.",

            "text": "susceptible to hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 )-induced senescence. 11 The susceptibility to oxidative stress-induced cytotoxic effect in G6PD-depleted cells is a recurring theme. Recently, G6PD-knockdown HepG2 cells have been shown to be highly susceptible to diamide-induced cytotoxicity with concomitant increased membrane peroxidation and cytoskeletal protein aggregation. 12 Such enhanced susceptibility to diamide-induced oxidative stress has been attributed mainly to impaired glutathione regeneration. These observations suggest that G6PD-deficient cells are predisposed to imbalanced redox status and oxidative stress. As a result, the increased oxidative stress elicits oxidative damage in macromolecules, such as DNA, protein, and lipid. Indeed, elevated DNA oxidative damage is found in G6PD-deficient fibroblasts, 11 and such cumulative genotoxic insult impairs cell growth. 17 The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway is involved in coordinating the response to oxidative stress, 18 thereby modulating cellular events including proliferation, differentiation, stress adaptation, and apoptosis. Recently, it has been shown that G6PD-knockdown human HepG2 cells are sensitive to oxidant-induced apoptosis due to altered MAPK signaling pathway. 13 Although much progress have been made on understanding the cellular effects of G6PD deficiency in erythrocytes and nucleated cells, the role of G6PD at the level of multicellular organism has not been investigated extensively due to the lack of G6PD-deficient animal model. The free-living soil nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, is the first multicellular animal with its genome being fully sequenced 19 and the C. elegans G6PD protein shows 56% amino-acid sequence homology with the human counterpart. In addition, the advantages of using C. elegans, including short life span, ease for large-scale culture, transparent body for microscopic examination, and readily frozen for storage as well as tractable genetic system, make it an invaluable animal model for G6PD research as well as other biomedical research. [20] [21] [22] In the present study, we used RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown technique to establish a reproducible G6PDdeficient C. elegans animal model. Such G6PD-knockdown C. elegans displayed defective oogenesis (increased apoptotic germ cells and reduced egg production) with concomitant increase of oxidative stress and DNA oxidative damage. Most importantly, we have found that G6PD-knockdown C. elegans displayed a severe defect in embryogenesis as indicated by a dramatic reduction of hatching of the embryos from these animals. Mechanistically, the reduced egg production and defective hatching induced by G6PD deficiency could be attributed partly to increased oxidative stress and possibly mediated by altered MAPK pathways in C. elegans, respectively.",

In addition, C. elegans G6PD is separated from multicellular eukaryotic and microbial G6PD homologues in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 1b) . Although microbial G6PD homologues display lower degree of conservation compared with human counterpart, it has been shown that the bacterial form of G6PD exerts antioxidant activity in G6PD-nullizygous mouse embryonic stem cells. 23 Based on the high degree of conservation between C. elegans and human, it is speculated that C. elegans G6PD is a functional homologue of human G6PD.",

To investigate the effect of G6PD deficiency in C. elegans, RNAi knockdown technique was employed to inhibit the endogenous G6PD expression. By measuring G6PD status, including mRNA, protein, and enzymatic activity in G6PD-RNAi knockdown (Gi) C. elegans, the knockdown efficiency was determined ( Figure 2 ). As expected, a marked reduction of g6pd mRNA level was detected in Gi C. elegans (22% of mock, Po0.005, N \u00bc 4) (Figure 2a ). In addition, western blot analysis using antihuman G6PD polyclonal antibody showed diminished G6PD protein level in Gi C. elegans compared with mock ( Figure 2b , inlet). Consistent with the downregulated G6PD protein expression, a significant decrease of G6PD catalytic activity was detected in Gi C. elegans (11% of mock, Po0.005, N \u00bc 8) (Figure 2b ). The residual G6PD activity (11%) in Gi C. elegans was in good accord with our recent report in G6PD-knockdown human cell line. 13 Despite significant depletion of G6PD, no vital growth defects were observed in the first generation of Gi C. elegans compared to mock C. elegans under our experimental condition. Taken together, these results demonstrate that G6PD knockdown in C. elegans is reproducible in the generation of a viable G6PD-deficient animal model.",

By incubating first-day C. elegans adult with ROS-sensitive fluorescent dye 2 0 , 7 0 dichlorodihydrofluoroscein diacetate (DCFDA), increased ROS was detected in Gi C. elegans compared with mock C. elegans (1.2-fold, P \u00bc 0.038, N \u00bc 6) (Figure 3a ). To further investigate whether G6PD deficiency caused oxidative damage in macromolecues, malondialdehyde (MDA) and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) were measured. While there was no significant difference of MDA level between mock and Gi C. elegans (data not shown), 8-OHdG level was significantly increased in Gi C. elegans compared to mock (1.5-fold, P \u00bc 0.005, N \u00bc 6) (Figure 3b ).

In the first generation of Gi C. elegans, no significant phenotypic changes including morphology, pharyngeal pumping, mobility, and growth rate were observed (data not shown). The lack of major phenotypes upon G6PD knockdown indicated that the residual G6PD activity in Gi C. elegans is sufficient to maintain basic cell functions in C. elegans (Figure 2b) . Nevertheless, the brood size derived from the first generation of Gi hermaphrodite was significantly reduced (65% of mock, P \u00bc 0.011, n \u00bc 60) compared with mock control (Figure 4a ). This finding indicates that G6PD is required for maintaining normal egg production. In addition to the decreased egg production upon G6PD knockdown, a majority of eggs produced by Gi C. elegans were unable to hatch compared with mock (10% of mock, Po0.005, n \u00bc 60) (Figure 4b ). This dramatic observation is consistent with a previous report that G6PD knockdown induces embryonic lethality in C. elegans. 24 Enhanced germ cell apoptosis by G6PD knockdown in C. elegans. In order to investigate whether decreased egg production induced by G6PD knockdown is the consequence of enhanced germ cell death, the germ cell apoptosis was determined in G6PD-deficient C. elegans using GFP reporter strain bcIs39 (P lim-7 ced-1::gfp), which highlights somatic sheath cell around apoptotic germ cells upon oogenesis. 25 Under basal condition, the number of apoptotic germ cells in bcIs39 Gi C. elegans was significantly increased by 2-fold (7.4 per gonad, P \u00bc 0.04, n \u00bc 80) compared with bcIs39 mock (3.7 per gonad, n \u00bc 60) (Figure 4c ). This result clearly demonstrates that reduction of G6PD increases germ cell apoptosis. Involvement of high oxidative stress in altered germ cell apoptosis and egg production by G6PD knockdown in C. elegans. Increased oxidative stress has been associated with reduced brood size in C. elegans. [26] [27] [28] To test whether high oxidative stress was involved in altered germ cell apoptosis and egg production caused by G6PD knockdown, a short-term H 2 O 2 treatment was exogenously applied to C. elegans adult followed by scoring the apoptotic germ cells (Figures 5a and b) and egg production (Figure 5c ). At 5 mM and 10 mM H 2 O 2 , the apoptotic germ cells were increased in mock C. elegans (6.2\u00b11.8 cells per gonad, P \u00bc 0.109 and 7.5 \u00b1 1.9 cells per gonad, Po0.005, respectively) compared with untreated control (3.7\u00b11.3 cells per gonad) ( Figure 5a ). However, the apoptotic germ cells in H 2 O 2 -treated Gi C. elegans showed no discernible difference (5 mM H 2 O 2 : 7.8 \u00b1 2.3 cells per gonad, P \u00bc 0.276 and 10 mM H 2 O 2 : 7.2\u00b11.7 cells per gonad, P \u00bc 0.652) compared with untreated Gi control (7.4 \u00b1 1.9 cells per gonad) ( Figure 5a) . Furthermore, at 5 mM H 2 O 2 , the total egg production of both mock and Gi C. elegans were not significantly affected compared with untreated control (P \u00bc 0.924 and P \u00bc 0.832, respectively) ( Figure 5c and Supplementary Table S1 ).",

In order to elucidate the signaling pathway associated with defective egg production caused by G6PD deficiency, loss-of-function mutants of possible pathways were analyzed for their egg production.

Previous studies have shown that G6PD deletion does not affect the viability of E. coli. 29 Likewise, G6PD-null S. cerevisiae grows normally, except for the nutritional requirement of organic sulfur. 30 Mild G6PD deficiency (40% of normal activity) moderately affects cardiac function in a mouse model. 31 In contrast, severe G6PD deficiency leads to 32 Currently, the lack of a workable G6PD-deficient animal model is the major obstacle to reveal the role of G6PD in organismal level. In the present study, G6PD-deficient C. elegans is established by RNAi knockdown as a viable and workable model system. Upon G6PD knockdown, C. elegans demonstrates significant reduction of G6PD expression and catalytic activity (Figure 2) , which are consistent with reduced G6PD status in G6PD-knockdown cells. 13 G6PD deficiency is associated with embryonic lethality in animals. Indeed, the most dramatic finding in this study is the extremely low hatching of eggs derived from G6PD-knockdown C. elegans (Figure 4c ). This result is supported by previous reports in mice 32 and C. elegans from a large-scale RNAi screen. 24 Consistently, the low hatching of eggs from G6PD-knockdown C. elegans provides strong evidence to the notion that G6PD is indispensable for embryonic survival in C. elegans. However, the underlying mechanism on how G6PD status affects embryonic survival is largely unknown.",

            "text": "One possible mechanism responsible for the defective oogenesis induced by G6PD knockdown in C. elegans is increased oxidative stress and oxidative damage. Indeed, G6PD deficiency has been correlated with increased oxidative stress in cells. [10] [11] [12] [13] Presumably, elevated oxidative stress and oxidative damage should be present in G6PD-deficient animals. Toward this end, we have determined ROS and oxidative damage in G6PD-knockdown C. elegans. As expected, G6PD-knockdown C. elegans displays increased oxidative stress compared with mock in basal condition ( Figure 3a ) and such observation is comparable with G6PDknockdown cells. 12, 13 Previous study has shown that G6PD-knockdown cells do not display enhanced MDA under physiological condition. 12 Similarly, the MDA level in G6PDknockdown C. elegans is indistinguishable to mock control under physiological condition (data not shown). On the other hand, G6PD knockdown enhances DNA oxidative damages in C. elegans (Figure 3b ). The fact that G6PD deficiency enhances DNA oxidative damage but not lipid peroxidation suggests that G6PD-deficient C. elegans is particularly sensitive to genotoxic insult, which is in accord with previous finding in G6PD-deficient fibroblasts. 11 Previous studies showed that increased oxidative stress is associated with defective oogenesis 33 ( ex ROS, low oxidative stress) Figure 8 Proposed mechanism of defective oogenesis and embryogenesis induced by G6PD knockdown in C. elegans. G6PD deficiency reduces NADPH level, which may modulate signaling pathways of egg production and hatching. (a) The mechanism of G6PD knockdown-induced defective egg production is proposed. NADPH depletion impairs redox homeostasis as indicated by increased oxidative stress and DNA oxidative damage. As a result, the accumulated oxidative insult enhances germ cell death and leads to decreased egg production. (b) The mechanism of G6PD knockdown-induced defective hatching is proposed. Upon G6PD knockdown, the diminished NADPH reduces the activity of a yet to be identified sensor, for example dual oxidase. The decreased production of sensor-derived ROS, which serves as signaling molecules, activates mek-1 or sek-1 through negative regulation. In turn, activation of mek-1 or sek-1 impairs normal hatching possibly through multiple signaling pathways. Hence, the loss of function of mek-1 or sek-1 negates the deleterious effects on hatching due to G6PD deficiency in C. elegans G6PD-deficient C. elegans cannot be excluded. In the current study, short-term H 2 O 2 enhances germ cell apoptosis in mock C. elegans in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5a) . However, the fact that H 2 O 2 cannot further enhance germ cell apoptosis in G6PD-deficient C. elegans suggests that it may be due to the buildup of endogenous oxidative stress in the oocytes that enhances germ cell apoptosis. Consequently, the enhanced germ cell death may lead to reduced egg production in G6PDknockdown C. elegans as possible mechanism illustrated in Figure 8a . Nevertheless, the fact that vitamin E feeding fails to rescue the defective egg production and hatching in G6PDknockdown C. elegans under our experimental condition (data not shown), suggesting the modulation of the redox homeostasis is a very complicated matter and these findings are consistent with previous report that antioxidant supplementation often displays mixed or negative outcomes in clinical trials. 34 Hence, the effect of increased oxidative stress or oxidative damage may be limited in playing a role in enhanced germ cell apoptosis caused by G6PD deficiency. As p53-dependent DNA damage pathway 35 and G6PD knockdown-induced alteration in MAPK activity are associated with cell demise, 13 loss-of-function mutants of C. elegans p53 (cep-1) and MAPK pathways (pmk-1, sek-1 and mek-1) are scored for their egg production ( Figure 6 ) and hatching (Figure 7 ) upon G6PD knockdown. The interpretation of the genetic analysis suggests that cep-1 is not required for the maintenance of normal egg production (Figure 6a ). On the other hand, the p38 MAPK pathway, including pmk-1 and sek-1, is required for the maintenance of normal egg production (Figures 6b and c) . As G6PD knockdown cannot further decrease egg production in pmk-1 mutant, this indicates that pmk-1 may act downstream of g6pd in the same pathway for maintaining normal egg production (Figure 6b ). While mek-1 is not involved in the maintenance of normal egg production (Figure 6d) , the additive suppression of egg production in sek-1/g6pd(RNAi) double mutant suggests that sek-1 may function in parallel to g6pd rather than in the same pathway (Figure 6c ). In general, p38 MAPK pathway is associated with diverse cellular functions, including immunity, apoptosis, stress response, and cell fate determination. The C. elegans pmk-1, a human p38 MAPK homologue, is activated by the mammalian MKK3/6 homologue sek-1, a member of MAPKK, which is downstream of nsy-1. The nsy-1-sek-1-pmk-1 cascade of p38 MAPK signaling is essential in the environmental response in C. elegans. 36 In addition, the C. elegans mek-1, a member of MAPK kinase (MAPKK) and activator of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), is also involved in stress response. 37 Hence, our results indicate that MAPK pathway is not directly associated with G6PD knockdown-induced defective egg production in C. elegans.",

Since G6PD is a major NADPH producing enzyme in cells, we hypothesized that there is a yet identified molecular sensor that respond to NADPH status in C. elegans. Upon G6PD knockdown, such NADPH sensor modulates the downstream signaling required for normal hatching. Such notion is not unprecedented. The translocation of the transcription factor, Nrf2 (Nuclear factor erythroid 2p45-related transcription factor), is modulated by a NADPH-requiring enzyme, NADPH oxidase (NOX). 38 This exemplifies a positive regulation of signal transduction affected by NADPH. On the other hand, a recently identified NADPH sensor, HSCARG (NmrA (34-36)-like family domain containing protein 1), is shown to negatively regulate NF-kB function. 39, 40 Furthermore, the dual oxidase-derived oxidative burst is essential for extracellular matrix modification of sea urchin eggs during fertilization. [41] [42] [43] Still more, it has been reported that ROS can negatively regulate Ras/MAPK pathway. 44 In addition, p38 and ERK/MAPK have been shown to block bovine preimplantation embryogenesis. 45 In order to clarify the role of MAPK in G6PD knockdown-induced defective hatching, we proposed a mechanism (Figure 8b ) in which the depletion of G6PD-derived NADPH reduces the activity of the unknown NADPH sensor (for example, dual oxidase 46 ) in C. elegans. The decreased ROS signaling (represents as low oxidative stress, in contrast to high oxidative stress that causes defective egg production in G6PD deficiency) activates MAPK activity through negative regulation. In turn, the activated MAPK impairs the hatching possibly through multiple signal transduction pathways. Hence, the inactivation of mek-1 or sek-1 negates the deleterious effects on hatching caused by G6PD knockdown in C. elegans. Indeed, the role of MAPK signaling in antagonizing essential gene for embryogenesis has been documented. The loss-of-function of MAPK pathways, including lin-45 (RAF), mek-2 (MEK), and mpk-1 (ERK), differentially rescue embryonic lethality of par-1 (partitioning defective) mutant embryos. 47 However, how does the inactivation of sek-1 or mek-1 actually suppress the defective hatching induced by G6PD knockdown remains to be elucidated.",

This G6PD-knockdown animal model allows us to delineate the chronic effects of G6PD-deficiency at the multicellular organism level. The parental G6PD-knockdown C. elegans is viable and shows no major growth defect. However, G6PD-knockdown C. elegans displays enhanced germ cell apoptosis and reduced egg production as well as a severe defect in hatching. Mechanistic studies suggest that decreased egg production in G6PD-knockdown C. elegans could be attributed in part to increased oxidative stress and oxidative damage. In contrast to its toxic effect in egg production, ROS may play an important role as signal molecules to mediate MAPK pathway that in turn can affect hatching in C. elegans.",
