C57BR/cdJ mice developed an acute histological allergic encephalomyelitis when given 2 weekly sensitizing injections of homogenate in complete Freund's adjuvant. When peripheral inoculation of LDV-C was substituted for one of the two sensitizing injections, a higher percentage of mice developed lesions, and the lesions were more severe and persisted for much longer periods of time. This same lesion-enhancing effect was not observed if the mice were sensitized with homogenate suspended in buffer or emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Interestingly, mice sensitized with complete Freund's",

Recently we discovered that LDV-C can produce encephalomyeloradiculitis in C57BR/cdJ mice (Stroop and Brinton 1983) . Following intraperitoneal inoculation of LDV-C, approximately 50% of young C57BR/cdJ mice developed encephalomyeloradiculitis, and the inflammatory lesions could be detected for many weeks after infection. Development of lesions in C57BR/cdJ mice was independent of immunosuppression and was not age-related, sex-linked or exclusively controlled by the H-2 histocompatibility locus (Stroop and Brinton 1983) . The central nervous system (CNS) lesions consisted of infiltration of inflammatory cells into the leptomeninges or around blood vessels in the white matter; demyelination was not a prominent feature.",

These results indicated that C57BR/cdJ mice were susceptible to develop acute histologic EAE when M. tuberculosis was included in the sensitizing regimen.

When LDV-C was used in conjunction with CFA, an incidence of lesions was observed similar to that seen in recipients of 2 injections of SSCH/CFA. These data suggested that M. tuberculosis was the critical element in the sensitizing inoculum responsible for the lesion-enhancing effect when injected into an LDV-C infected mouse or when given to a mouse prior to LDV-C infection. This was confirmed by the observation that when SSCH in phosphate-buffered saline was administered before or after infection, an incidence of lesions was produced consistent with the incidence of lesions produced by LDV-C infection.",

            "text": "The role of M. tuberculosis in the construction of an adjuvant in the production of EAE in mice, guinea pigs and rats has been known for many years. The mycobacterial component of CFA appears critical to the induction of EAE, although its mode of action has not been completely elucidated (Lee and Schneider 1962; Shaw et al. 1962; Paterson 1976) . In contrast, when animals are immunized with syngeneic brain tissue or mylein basic protein in IFA, little or no EAE is produced (Paterson 1976) , and animals fail to develop EAE when subsequently challenged with encephalitogenic proteins in CFA (Alvord et al. 1965; Swierkosz et al. 1975) due to the induction of suppressor T cells (Swierkosz et al. 1975; Welch and Swanborg 1976; Swierkosz and Swanborg 1977) . Killen and Swanborg (Killen and Swanborg 1982) found that rats sensitized with a dose of myelin basic protein in IFA produced EAE effector cells in lymph node and spleen, suggesting that mycobacteria were not required for the activation of EAE effector cells. However, mycobacteria may be responsible for an amplification of effector cells generated through production of interleukin 1 by macrophages which in turn activates T helper cells (Gery et al. 1972; Killen and Swanborg 1982; Oppenheim et al. 1982) . Helper cells, which produce interleukin 2 (Larsen et al. 1980; Smith et al. 1980 ) may activate the T effector cells responsible for EAE production (Killen and Swanborg 1982; Ortiz-Ortiz and Weigle 1982) . Also because LDV-C replicates in macrophages in vitro (Brinton-Darnell et al. 1975 ) and probably replicates in fixed macrophages in vivo, it is possible that interleukin production itself is also directly affected by LDV infection.",

If the mechanism of LDV-induced CNS inflammation was autoimmune due to some antigenic similarity between CNS and LDV antigens, analogous to production of EAE in animals when sensitized to autologous or heterologous CNS encephalitogens, one would expect that administration of SSCH/IFA before infection with LDV/C would prevent lesion development. The fact that mice sensitized with SSCH/IFA 1 week before infection with LDV-C developed lesions, suggests that antigenic similarity between LDV-C and SSCH does not form the basis for an autoimmune mechanism by which LDV-C produced CNS inflammation.",

(1977) found that an intracranial injection of HSV could substitute for an injection of the encephalitogen in their EAE protocol. These results are similar to the results we obtained when C57BR/cdJ mice were given LDV-C 1 week before or 1 week after SSCH/CFA. Recently, Watanabe et al. (1983) have found that reactive T cells are generated against myelin basic protein during the course of coronavirus infections in Lewis rats. Infection of rats with murine coronavirus JHM produces a late onset demyelinating encephalomyelitis due to lytic replication of the virus in oligodendrocytes. When lymphocytes from infected rats were stimulated in vitro with myelin basic protein, and adoptively transferred to naive recipient rats, lesions and mild clinical signs consistent with EAE were produced. It is possible that replication of LDV-C in the CNS may cause the release of neural antigens, in a manner similar to JHM infection. These antigens may then participate in the EAE process to hasten and worsen the CNS lesions observed, perhaps through production of effector T cells.",
