Flaviviruses, including yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, dengue virus, and Zika virus, induce unique single-membrane ER invaginations that house the viral replication machinery 1 . Whether this virus-induced ER remodeling is vulnerable to antiviral pathways is unknown. Here, we show that flavivirus replication at the ER is targeted by the interferon (IFN) response. Through genome-scale CRISPR screening, we uncovered an antiviral mechanism mediated by a functional gene pairing between IFI6, an interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) cloned over 30 years ago 2 , and HSPA5, which encodes the ER-resident HSP70 chaperone BiP. We reveal that IFI6 is an ERlocalized integral membrane effector that is stabilized through interactions with BiP. Mechanistically, IFI6 prophylactically protects uninfected cells by preventing formation of virus-induced ER membrane invaginations. Notably, IFI6 has little effect on other mammalian RNA viruses, including the related Flaviviridae member hepatitis C virus, which replicates in double-membrane vesicles that protrude outward from the ER. These findings support a model in which the IFN response is armed with a membrane-targeted effector that discriminately blocks the establishment of virus-specific ER microenvironments required for replication.",

            "text": "To confirm this result, we used two strategies to deplete IFI6 via CRISPR. In the first, we used a puromycin-selectable lentiCRISPRv2 vector to deliver one sgRNA targeting IFI6 (IFI6-KO 1 ). In the second, we used both puromycin-selectable and blasticidin-selectable lentiCRISPRv2 vectors to co-deliver two distinct IFI6-targeted sgRNAs (IFI6-KO 2 ) that were also different from the sgRNA in the IFI6-KO 1 strategy. We generated an IFI6 knockout line, Huh7.5-IFI6-KO 1 , and showed loss of IFN-induced IFI6 expression by western blot (Fig 1e and Supplementary Fig 1a) . In infection studies, compared to control Huh7.5 cells, Huh7.5-IFI6-KO 1 cells were markedly refractory to an otherwise robust IFNmediated inhibition of West Nile virus expressing (WNV-GFP) (Fig 1f) and YFV-Venus ( Supplementary Fig 1b) . Similar results with YFV-Venus were obtained in two other cell backgrounds, A549-IFI6-KO 1 and U-2 OS IFI6-KO 1 , and in Huh7.5-IFI6-KO 2 cells ( Supplementary Fig 1c,d,e) . To determine the effects of IFN-inducible IFI6 on a nonattenuated, non-reporter flavivirus, we assessed WNV titers in Huh7.5-NT (control cells expressing a non-targeting sgRNA) or in Huh7.5-IFI6-KO 2 cells with or without IFN pretreatment (Fig 1g) . In the absence of IFN, WNV replicated to similar titers in Huh7.5-NT and Huh7.5-IFI6-KO 2 cells. IFN suppressed WNV replication by approximately 3 logs in Huh7.5-NT cells at 24 h and 48 h. At 72 h, the inhibitory effect was diminished, and this correlated with decreased IFI6 expression by western blot. Notably, WNV titers were nearly completely restored at all time points in IFN-treated Huh7.5-IFI6-KO 2 cells. To complement these IFI6 depletion studies, we also demonstrated that ectopically expressed IFI6 potently suppressed YFV-Venus in multiple cells types (Supplementary Fig 1f) . Time courses revealed potent and sustained IFI6-mediated inhibition of YFV-Venus and dengue virus expressing GFP (DENV-GFP) (Fig 1h,i) , as well as 2-3 log 10 suppression of non-reporter YFV titers (Fig 1j) . Contemporary and prototype strains of Zika virus were also inhibited by IFI6 (Fig 1k and Supplementary Fig 1g) , though to a lesser extent than the other flaviviruses we tested. These data establish a robust inhibitory phenotype for IFI6 against flaviviruses. In previous ectopic expression or shRNA knockdown screens, we and others also found IFI6 as inhibitory toward flaviviruses, further strengthening the reproducibility of the phenotype through multiple screening approaches [4] [5] [6] [7] .",

            "text": "Another screening hit, HSPA5, encodes BiP/GRP78, an HSP70 chaperone in the ER that assists in protein folding and surveillance of misfolded proteins 10 . We hypothesized that BiP may modulate the antiviral effects of IFI6. We first assessed IFI6 and BiP mRNA and protein levels in IFN-treated cells (Fig 2a) . As expected, IFI6 mRNA and protein were highly induced over a time course of IFN treatment. BiP mRNA levels were largely unaffected by IFN, while BiP protein increased slightly at each time point after IFN treatment. To validate the CRISPR screen, we depleted BiP via CRISPR and found that YFV infection was de-repressed by more than 5-fold in the presence of IFN\u03b1 (Fig 2b) . In the absence of IFN\u03b1, we detected a modest 1.5-fold loss of infection in BiP-depleted cells, suggesting a minor role for this chaperone during YFV infection. We then knocked out BiP in cells ectopically expressing IFI6 and observed a similar (~ 4-fold) de-repression of YFV infection as with IFN\u03b1 treatment (Fig 2c) . The antiviral activity of IFN\u03b1 could be restored in BiP-depleted cells by complementing cells with sgRNA-resistant BiP (Fig 2d) . Notably, depletion of BiP resulted in near complete loss of ectopic IFI6 expression (Fig 2e) . These data suggest that in the absence of BiP, IFI6 is targeted for degradation. This was confirmed by restoring IFI6 expression in BiP-depleted cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig 2f) . To test whether BiP chaperone activity was required for its regulation of IFI6, we reconstituted BiP-depleted cells with CRISPR-resistant wild-type BiP, or three ATPasedefective mutants 11 . The mutants could not rescue IFI6 levels (Fig 2g) , suggesting that BiP chaperone activity is required for IFI6 protein expression. To assess potential interactions between BiP and IFI6, we immunoprecipitated ectopically expressed FLAG-tagged IFI6 and found that BiP was indeed pulled down (Fig 2h) . The interaction was abrogated by ATP, which binds the chaperone and induces a conformational change that releases substrates 12 . We next tested whether endogenous, IFN-induced IFI6 interacts with BiP. Since our IFI6 antibody has high background ( Supplementary Fig 1a) , we used CRISPR-Cas9-mediated \"gene tagging\" to introduce a 3xFLAG epitope at the C terminus of endogenous IFI6 in U-2 OS cells 13 . RT-PCR and western blotting confirmed IFN\u03b1-mediated induction of endogenous FLAG-tagged IFI6 (Fig 2i) . In a proximity ligation assay, we detected a robust interaction signal for BiP and IFI6 in IFN-treated gene tagged cells (Fig 2j and  Supplementary Fig 4a) . Thus, BiP likely functions as a regulator of the IFN response to flaviviruses by facilitating proper folding and/or localization of IFI6 at the ER membrane.",

We therefore sought to resolve IFI6 subcellular localization. The N terminus of IFI6 has a predicted signal peptide ( Supplementary Fig 4b) , suggesting targeting to the secretory pathway (ER, Golgi, endosomes, etc.). Indeed, expression of IFI6 bearing a C terminal 3x FLAG epitope (IFI6-3xF) revealed a reticular staining pattern that overlapped with ER translocon member Sec61\u03b2-GFP, but was distinct from mitochondria-localized GFP (Fig 3a) . Since overexpression can mislocalize proteins, we assessed the localization of endogenous IFI6 in our gene-tagged cells (Fig 2i) . Immunofluorescence of IFN-treated, gene-tagged cells demonstrated a reticular pattern for endogenous IFI6 that overlapped with Sec61\u03b2-GFP ( Fig  3b) and was similar to ectopically expressed IFI6-3xF (Fig 3a) . Immunogold electron microscopy in COS-7 cells revealed that ectopically expressed IFI6 bearing a C terminal HA tag (IFI6-HA) localized extensively to cytosolic membranes resembling ER structures, but not within nuclei or mitochondria (Fig 3c) . We confirmed by immunofluorescence that IFI6-HA staining in COS-7 cells was reticular and distinct from a mitochondrial GFP signal ( Fig  3d) . Lastly, we fused the putative N terminal signal peptide of IFI6 to GFP and found that the signal from this fusion protein, (N32)IFI6-GFP, overlapped with the common ER epitope KDEL (Fig 3e) . Together, these results suggest that, contrary to previous reports, IFI6 is localized to the ER, the site of flavivirus replication.",

Solubilization of membranes with Triton X-100 shifted the entire pool of IFI6 and calnexin to higher densities. By contrast, disrupting electrostatic interactions with a high salt concentration did not affect the migration pattern. Treatment with sodium carbonate pH 11.5, which disrupts peripheral membrane protein association 19 , caused a small proportion of IFI6 to shift to higher densities, although most signal was retained at lower density. Similar results were obtained with a different gradient composition (Supplementary Fig 4e) . These data suggest IFI6 is primarily an integral membrane protein, though we cannot rule out that some of the protein may associate to membranes through peripheral interactions. Supporting this conclusion, we did not detect secretion of IFI6 from cells, whereas secretion of CCL2, a control, was robust and readily blocked by Brefeldin A treatment (Fig 3g) .",

To distinguish these two possibilities, we performed a time-of-addition experiment in which IFI6 was expressed either before or after infection. We found that expressing IFI6 at the same time as or after viral infection rendered IFI6 incapable of inhibiting replication, as shown by infectivity assays and viral NS1 protein expression (Fig 4 d,e) . Thus, despite being expressed in virally infected cells, IFI6 cannot inhibit viral replication once it is already established. This \"pointof-no-return\" phenotype indicates that IFI6 is primarily a prophylactic antiviral effector, and suggests that it may target virus-induced membrane alterations at the ER (model 2) rather than viral genome amplification (model 1). In support of this conclusion, when we infected IFI6-expressing cells at a high enough MOI of DENV to partially overcome the antiviral effect, we observed that IFI6 colocalized with ER-resident DENV NS4B (Fig 4f, g , and Supplementary Fig 8) . We also found that in some cells, IFI6 re-localized to NS4B-rich large cytoplasmic punctae, which are characteristic of DENV infection (Fig 4f) 17 . Since NS4B helps form the membrane scaffold required for replication organelle biogenesis 23-25 , we propose that IFI6, if expressed before infection, suppresses flavivirus replication by thwarting virus-induced ER perturbations.",

Indeed, ectopic expression of IFI6 did not inhibit other diverse RNA viruses, including Sindbis virus (Togaviridae family), coxsackie B virus (Picornaviridae family), or measles virus (Paramyxoviridae family) ( Supplementary Fig 5b) . Loss of IFI6 did not affect IFN-mediated inhibition of SINV or CVB infection ( Supplementary Fig 5c) . We next tested the inhibitory potential of IFI6 against hepatitis C virus (HCV), which like DENV or YFV, is a Flaviviridae family member (genus Hepacivirus). Using multiple HCV constructs in both gain-and loss-of-function assays, we found that IFI6 lacked inhibitory activity against HCV (Fig 4h, i, j and Supplementary Fig 5d) . This was unexpected since HCV also replicates at the ER. However, rather than induce single-membrane invaginations like the flaviviruses, HCV infection results in the formation of double-membrane vesicles that protrude out from the ER 1 . To determine whether HCV subverts the antiviral effects of IFI6, which was proposed recently 26 , we co-infected cells with both YFV and HCV reporter viruses, predicting that IFI6 may have reduced activity against YFV if HCV counteracts its function. However, IFI6 still inhibited YFV, but not HCV (Fig 4k) , suggesting that HCV does not antagonize IFI6 in a manner that interferes with its anti-flavivirus activity ( Supplementary Fig 5e) . Other groups have reported that ectopically expressed IFI6 inhibits HCV 27, 28 , but the magnitude of inhibition in those studies was typically on the order of 2fold, rather than the multiple log-fold inhibition we observe with flaviviruses. Moreover, supporting our data, three independent loss-of-function screens to identify genes mediating the IFN response to HCV failed to identify IFI6 as a hit [29] [30] [31] . Beyond HCV, we also found that IFI6 does not inhibit a coronavirus (Fig 4l) , which like HCV, forms double-membrane vesicles at the ER 32 . Together, these data support a model in which IFI6 inhibits ER membrane perturbations specific to flaviviruses, but not to other viruses that generate different ER structures (Fig 4m) .",

The unique viral specificity of IFI6 suggests a mechanism that may be tailored for flavivirus-induced single-membrane invaginations at the ER, but not the ERderived double-membrane vesicles formed during replication of HCV and coronavirus. If the host has evolved multiple mechanisms to inhibit membrane-derived viral replication compartments, then future studies may reveal IFI6-like molecules that target other viruses replicating at the ER or distinct membranous organelles. Our findings further raise the intriguing possibility that this antiviral strategy may be leveraged for therapeutic intervention of flavivirus infection.",
