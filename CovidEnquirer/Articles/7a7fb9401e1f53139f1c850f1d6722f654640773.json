Macrophages and neutrophils constitute the majority of cells recruited into infected lungs, and are associated with immunopathology in influenza pneumonia. We examined pathological manifestations in models of macrophage-or neutrophil-depleted mice challenged with sublethal doses of influenza A virus H1N1 strain PR8. Infected mice depleted of macrophages displayed excessive neutrophilic infiltration, alveolar damage, and increased viral load, later progressing into ARDS-like pathological signs with diffuse alveolar damage, pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, and hypoxemia. In contrast, neutrophil-depleted animals showed mild pathology in lungs. The brochoalveolar lavage fluid of infected macrophage-depleted mice exhibited elevated protein content, T1-\u2423, thrombomodulin, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and myeloperoxidase activities indicating augmented alveolarcapillary damage, compared to neutrophil-depleted animals. We provide evidence for the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), entangled with alveoli in areas of tissue injury, suggesting their potential link with lung damage. When co-incubated with infected alveolar epithelial cells in vitro, neutrophils from infected lungs strongly induced NETs generation, and augmented endothelial damage. NETs induction was abrogated by anti-myeloperoxidase antibody and an inhibitor of superoxide dismutase, thus",

Although reports implicate the possible involvement of neutrophils in ARDS complications in mice challenged with influenza virus, 8, 9 there is a paucity of evidence to reinforce their role. Neutrophil-dominant infiltrations within the affected areas of lungs with complications of DAD, intra-alveolar-associated hemorrhage have been documented in human cases [17] [18] [19] [20] as well as in animal models 8, 9, [21] [22] [23] of severe influenza. Mice lacking interleukin 17 receptor A (IL-17RA), or mice treated with antibody against macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2; a potent regulator of neutrophil recruitment) are protected from lethal influenza A/PR/8/34 H1N1 challenge. 24, 25 Congruent with the role of MIP-2 in ALI, increased neutrophil recruitment was observed in mice challenged with reconstituted 1918 H1N1 virus. 21 Mice lacking IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-\u2423 (TNF-\u2423) exhibit delay in onset of death following lethal influenza infection. 26 On the other hand, neutrophils have ameliorative effects, given that neutrophil depletion enhances lethality in influenzainfected mice. 27, 28 Macrophages and neutrophils constitute the majority of infiltrated cells into the lungs in highly pathogenic influenza virus infections.

Although NETs aid in trapping bacteria and other pathogens, their prolonged presence may lead to tissue damage. [32] [33] [34] DNA fibers in NETs attach to the capillary endothelium, and are embroiled in vascular damage in sepsis and small vessel vasculitis. 30, 35 Reactive oxygen intermediates, NADPH oxidase, or anti-proteinase 3 (PR-3) are known to mediate NETs induction. 36, 37 Neutrophils activated by IL-8 or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) also form NETs. 29 Bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus survive even in the presence of NETs by producing endonucleases (which digest NETs) or catalase (which metabolizes hydrogen peroxide). 36, 38 NETs formation in viral infections is virtually unknown, except for a recent study that demonstrated modulation of NETs formation in feline leukemia virus infections. 39 Here, we exploited macrophage-or neutrophil-depleted animals to unravel the association of these cells with ALI in influenza pneumonia. Our results show that macrophage-depleted animals suffered complications of ARDS when challenged with sublethal influenza virus infection, in contrast to neutrophil-depleted animals that developed only mild lung injury. For the first time, we demonstrated the induction of NETs during influenza virus infection both in vitro and in vivo. NETs were lodged within the areas of alveolar destruction, thus suggesting their putative role in lung damage. Additional in vitro studies revealed the participation of NETs in endothelial damage, and that the regulation of NETs formation was dependent on activation of redox enzymes.",

We To understand the mechanism of NETs induction during epithelial-neutrophil interaction, the coculture was incubated in the presence of anti-MPO antibody, DPI (NADPH oxidase inhibitor), DETC (SOD inhibitor), or anti-ENA-78 antibody. As shown in Figure 6H , significant reduction in NETs release was observed in the presence of anti-MPO and SOD inhibitor, but not with DPI or anti-ENA-78. The opposite effects of DETC and DPI on NETs formation may be attributed to the different modes of action of the inhibitors at the concentrations tested. The SOD-related conversion of superoxide to H 2 O 2 is blocked by DETC, 46 whereas DPI inhibits NADPH oxidase, nitric oxide synthase, and xanthine oxidase. 47 Furthermore, exposure of H 2 O 2 alone significantly induced NETs formation. These results suggest that superoxide-generated H 2 O 2 may contribute to NETs induction in influenza pneumonia. These studies also indicate that NETs formation is an active mechanism which could participate in ALI. A possible hypothesis is that influenza virus infection of epithelial cells induces superoxide and H 2 O 2 generation, which in turn stimulate MPO present on the surface of neutrophils, thus inducing NETs and mediating tissue injury.",

Firstly, mice challenged with sublethal doses of influenza virus after macrophage depletion exhibited aggravated pathological lesions that further developed into ARDS-like complications and hypoxemia. Histopathological and biochemical analyses showed excessive neutrophil infiltration, destruction of the microvascular bed, and pulmonary edema. In contrast, infected neutrophil-depleted and nondepleted animals exhibited mild lung injury. Second, our data provide the first evidence demonstrating NETs induction in influenza virus pneumonitis in vivo with their prominent appearance within alveoli and airways, and in lesions of tissue injury. Thirdly, co-incubation of neutrophils with influenza virus-primed alveolar epithelial cells induced release of NETs, which was abrogated by inhibitors of redox enzymes (including MPO and SOD), thus implicating redox enzymes in NETs formation. Accumulating evidence underscores that most patients with severe influenza infections suffer from complications of ARDS, whereas histopathological analyses of their lungs reveal dominant neutrophilic accumulation in affected regions with tissue consolidation and DAD. [17] [18] [19] [20] Macrophages and neutrophils comprise the majority of cells that are recruited into infected lungs, and are linked with immunopathology. 31 Our studies have revealed that mice depleted of macrophages and challenged with sublethal influenza developed severe clinical signs of ARDS and suffered from hypoxemia, with gross appearance of highly edematous and hemorrhagic lungs, whereas neutrophil depletion resulted only in mild lung injury. These results are congruent with previous studies demonstrating relatively high mortalities in macrophage-depleted mice compared to neutrophil-depleted mice challenged with 1918 reconstituted virus. 21 Furthermore, our studies revealed that macrophage depletion led to intense neutrophilic infiltration into alveoli and airways as observed at 5 dpi, and eventually these mice portrayed clinical signs of ARDS and histological features of DAD, with alveolar spaces filled with proteinaceous exudates and erythrocytes by 10 dpi. Severe hypoxemia in macrophagedepleted infected animals was evident by decreased pAO 2 and sAO 2 levels, compared to their nondepleted or neutrophil-depleted counterparts. Neutrophil-depleted or nondepleted infected mice had milder lung injury with more prominent bronchopneumonia. Progressive pathological complications of ALI were observed in macrophage-depleted animals at 7 and 8 dpi (data not shown) with prominent clinical signs of respiratory distress. A previous study showed that neutrophil depletion was associated with increased lethality in H3N2 infection, with mainly bronchitis and systemic viral spread. 28 In contrast, our mouse model displayed severe alveolitis and pulmonary edema. Compared to nondepleted or neutrophil-depleted mice, high viral titers were observed in macrophage-depleted mice despite the intense influx of neutrophils, implying that macrophages are more important in viral clearance. These findings concur with previous studies on influenza infections in pigs and mice. No significant bacterial infection was noticed in any group, suggesting that damage was not attributable to secondary bacterial pneumonia.",

Moreover, elevated levels of T1-\u2423 and thrombomodulin (membrane proteins of alveolar type I pneumocytes and endothelium, respectively) in BALF of infected macrophage-depleted animals reflected damage of the pulmonary microvascular bed. Alveolar type I cells and endothelium constitute the microvascular bed that forms the physical barrier that prevents fluid flux into the air spaces. Previously, we demonstrated enhanced apoptotic death of infected alveolar epithelial cells during blockade of macrophage recruitment into the lungs. 43 Our results indicate that excessive neutrophil recruitment, activation, and release of toxic enzymes can exacerbate the damage of alveolar epithelium by virus infection, leading to vascular leakage, pulmonary edema, and hypoxemia, thus finally developing into ARDS.",

            "text": "Several groups have demonstrated that NETs formation is a novel strategy by neutrophils for trapping bacteria with their web-like structures consisting of proteolytic and chromatin material. NETs formation is also linked with tissue injury in sepsis and small vessel vasculitis. 30, 35 The DNA entangled with the endothelium of small blood vessels appear with capillary damage both in vivo and in vitro. 35 Here, we provide novel data to validate the induction of NETs following lethal influenza virus challenge of mice. Bundles of DNA fibers appeared prominently in the alveoli and terminal bronchioles within areas of tissue consolidation. Only a subpopulation of neutrophils produced NETs, since we also detected unstimulated neutrophils with disintegrated nuclei that were undergoing apoptosis or necrosis. The existence of DNA fibers closely entangled to the alveolar epithelium suggests that these structures may contribute to damage of the alveolar-capillary barrier. Occasionally, NETs were found attached to the endothelium of large blood vessels or occluding some of the airways. Similar observations were made in small vessel vasculitis and sepsis, wherein extensive NETs accumulate inside the glomerular capsule or cause occlusion of sinusoids, and NETs were prominent in patient tissue biopsies with intense neutrophil infiltration. Immunostaining revealed the presence of histone, MMP-9, and MPO colocalized with DNA chromatin fibers. NETs formation in macrophage-depleted infected mice was more obvious, thus suggesting that NETs induction may participate in pathological events, and spur progression toward ARDS. In contrast, lungs of Due to the close proximity of NETS with the alveolarcapillary surface, we next asked whether the crosstalk between neutrophils and infected alveolar epithelial cells could instigate NETs formation. Neutrophils isolated from influenza virus-infected mice indeed stimulated NETs release when incubated with murine alveolar epithelial cells primed with influenza virus, thus suggesting that interactions of these cells are critical for NETs generation. NETs formation is a distinct mode of cell death induced by reactive oxygen intermediates, NADPH oxidase, and cytokines such as IL-8. 37, 49 Influenza virus infection of alveolar epithelial cells led to increased superoxide activity and elevated CXCL-5, a chemokine known to stimulate neutrophils and induce chemotaxis. To investigate the mechanism of NETs, we used inhibitors or antibodies against CXCL-5 and redox enzymes (including MPO, SOD, NADPH oxidase). We found that inhibition of MPO and SOD, but not of NADPH oxidase, reduced NETs generation. Concurrently, we observed extensive NETs induction when neutrophils were incubated in the presence of H 2 O 2 , a product of SOD activity. This finding was observed previously, ie, H 2 O 2 -generating enzyme can cause significant NETs induction. 36 Taken together, these experiments describe a novel mechanism of NETs induction via H 2 O 2 production by infected target cells. The generation of H 2 O 2 may in turn activate MPO present on the neutrophil surface, and further investigations are warranted to understand how these interactions culminate in NETs induction.",

            "text": "Although NETs generation is documented in various infections, the role of NETs in viral infections is largely unknown. Although NETs were first identified to participate in bacterial killing, certain bacteria possess a defense strategy by producing endonucleases that can degrade the NETs. 36, 38 To test the functional significance of NETs in influenza, we performed endothelial injury and bactericidal activity studies. We found that NETs mediated damage of endothelial cells as evident by the cell death assay as well as by thrombomodulin release into the culture supernatant. Furthermore, incubation of neutrophils with different bacteria demonstrated that NETs inhibited the growth of K. pneumoniae to a certain degree, but not of S. pneumoniae or S. aureus when incubated with an inhibitor of phagocytic activity. These results suggest that NETs induced during influenza virus infection can contribute to lung injury, but have limited bactericidal activity.",

PMA served as the positive control for NETs induction. To test whether influenza virus infection of alveolar epithelial cells could induce superoxide, we stained the infected and uninfected cells with the selective mitochondrial superoxide indicator, MitoSOX Red (Molecular Probes).
