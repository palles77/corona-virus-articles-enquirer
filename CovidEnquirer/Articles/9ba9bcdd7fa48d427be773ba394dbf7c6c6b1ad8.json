The authors also suggested that the presence of varying amounts of casein in normal bovine colostrum might increase the variation in AEA in calves fed colostrum with similar IgG content. Our data do not support this hypothesis. Calves in experiment 1 consumed 296 (C-0), 496 (C-200, W-200), or 696 (C-400, W-400) g of DM in the experiment. Protein intakes were 184, 360, 334, 535 and 483 g, respectively. Only at 400 g of casein (535 g of protein intake) was plasma IgG concentration or calculated AEA impaired. The marked increase in total protein in calves fed WPC in experiment 1, coupled with the small increase in plasma urea-N suggests that much of the WPC was absorbed into the circulation but was not metabolized to urea N. Conversely, total plasma protein increased less and urea N increased more when calves were fed casein, but particularly 400 g of casein.",
