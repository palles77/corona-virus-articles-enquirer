            "text": "Germline variation at immunoglobulin gene (IG) loci is critical for pathogen-mediated immunity, but establishing complete reference sequences in these regions is problematic because of segmental duplications and somatically rearranged source DNA. We sequenced BAC clones from the essentially haploid hydatidiform mole, CHM1, across the light chain IG loci, kappa (IGK) and lambda (IGL), creating single haplotype representations of these regions. The IGL haplotype is 1.25Mb of contiguous sequence with four novel V gene and one novel C gene alleles and an 11.9kbp insertion. The IGK haplotype consists of two 644kbp proximal and 466kbp distal contigs separated by a gap also present in the reference genome sequence. Our effort added an additional 49kbp of unique sequence extending into this gap. The IGK haplotype contains six novel V gene and one novel J gene alleles and a 16.7kbp region with increased sequence identity between the two IGK contigs, exhibiting signatures of interlocus gene conversion. Our data facilitated the first comparison of nucleotide diversity between the light and IG heavy (IGH) chain haplotypes within a single genome, revealing a three to six fold enrichment in the IGH locus, supporting the theory that the heavy chain may be more important in determining antigenic specificity.",

            "text": "Antibodies are essential components of the immune system that play key roles in processes associated with innate and adaptive immunity 1 . They are expressed by B-cells as either cell surface receptors or secreted proteins, and are formed by two pairs of identical \"heavy\" and \"light\" immunoglobulin (IG) protein chains, encoded by genes located at three primary loci in the human genome: the IG heavy chain (IGH) at 14q32.33, and the two IG light chain regions, lambda (IGL) and kappa (IGK), located at 22q11.2 and 2p11.2 2 . Specifically, through a unique mechanism referred to as V-(D)-J recombination 3 , individual Variable (V), Diversity (D), and Joining (J) genes at the IGH locus, and V and J genes at either the IGK or IGL loci recombine somatically at the DNA level to generate templates for the subsequent transcription and translation of antibody heavy and light chains, respectively. V-(D)-J recombination is accompanied by the random addition and deletion of nucleotides at the junctions of the combined V, D, and J genes by terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (TdT). The extreme variability observed in expressed antigen-na\u00efve B-cell antibody repertoires is due to this combinatorial and junctional diversity, and partly ensures that the immune system is able to recognize and mount effective immune responses against a diverse range of potential pathogens. At the population and species level, IG haplotype and allelic variation also make important contributions to the diversity of expressed antibody repertoires [4] [5] [6] [7] ; however, broader roles of IG genetic polymorphism in antibody function are generally less well understood 8 .",

Importantly, not only has IG genetic diversity recently been implicated in inter-individual variation in expressed antibody repertoires [4] [5] [6] , but genetic variants in both IG coding regions and well-characterized regulatory motifs are also known to influence antibody expression and function, and mediate risk of disease phenotypes 10-12 . However, our understanding of germline variability at the IGH, IGK, and IGL loci remains severely limited, especially in terms of haplotype structure (i.e., large segmental duplications and deletions) as well as coding and non-coding sequence polymorphisms. We have begun to uncover this variability in the IGH locus, leading to complete nucleotide resolution descriptions of large structural variants (insertions, deletions, duplications, and complex rearrangements), including novel functional IGHV genes and alleles 7 .",

The region spans approximately 0.9 MB, and includes 69 IGLV, seven IGLJ, and seven IGLC functional/open reading frame (ORF) genes and pseudogenes. Additional V, J, and C genes not present in this haplotype are known to occur as insertion variants in the human population 2, [14] [15] [16] . Similarly, the initial sequence of the IGK locus was generated from a composite assembly of cosmid, bacteriophage, and BAC clone libraries 17 . A unique feature of the IGK locus is that it includes two large inverted segmental duplications (SDs) that comprise distinct V-gene containing regions (termed proximal and distal); these regions remain separated by a large, currently unsequenced, assembly gap. The proximal region spans 0.54 MB and includes 69 IGKV functional/ORF genes and pseudogenes, whereas the distal region spans 0.43 MB and includes 62 V genes and pseudogenes (distal V genes are denoted by a \"D\"; e.g., IGKV1D-13), five functional IGKJ genes, and a single functional IGKC gene also reside downstream of the proximal V gene cluster.",

Our analyses have facilitated the identification of novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within IGL and IGK gene coding regions and regulatory elements, and also revealed a novel large sequence conversion event between the IGKV proximal and distal regions. In addition, our unbiased tri-locus comparison shows a striking enrichment of structural and nucleotide diversity in the IGH locus, confirming previous suggestions that germline variation within the light chain gene loci is lower than that observed in IGH 15, 22, 23 .",

Clones unique to either IGK or IGL were then used to construct locuswide contigs; clones in IGKV proximal and distal regions were aligned separately because the gap separating these two regions was not completely filled by the current sequencing effort. Figure 1) . In total, we identified 37 of the 38 known functional/ORF IGLV genes, seven functional J genes, and four functional C genes. The remaining IGLV gene, IGHV5-39 was not found in CH17, consistent with it being an insertion polymorphism 15, 21 . Sequence comparisons within IGLV, IGLJ, and IGLC genes revealed allelic differences between CH17 and the Kawasaki haplotype at six V genes, two J genes, and one C gene (Figure 1 ; Supplementary Table 1 ). Six of these alleles, five of which were novel (IGLV6-57, IGLV11-55, IGLV5-45, IGLV5-48, and IGLC7), included non-synonymous changes. Notably, the novel allele identified at IGHV5-48 included a nonsense mutation that introduced a premature stop codon in the framework 3 region of the protein; 15 additional SNPs were also characterized within the exons of this gene. Prior to this study, only a single allele of IGLV5-48 had been described, classified as an ORF due to an uncharacteristic single nucleotide difference in the heptamer portion of the recombination signal (RS: TACAGT instead of CACAGTG 24 ). SNPs characterized in the remaining four novel functional/ORF alleles were represented in the 1000 genomes project (1KG) dataset 25 . Previously described regulatory motifs 13 , including RS sequences, associated with each of the 37 identified functional/ORF IGLV genes were also inspected for previously uncharacterized variants in the CH17 haplotype, but no SNPs in these regions were identified.",

Segmental duplications are known to facilitate sequence exchange via non-allelic homologous recombination and interlocus gene conversion 29, 30 ; however, given the lack of reference sequence data this has not been investigated in the IGK locus. To address this, we conducted pair-wise comparisons of distal and proximal regions from CH17 and Kawasaki haplotypes to search for large tracts of shared sequence ( Figure 3A ). The expectation is that sequence should be most similar between homologous regions in the alternate haplotype, whereas higher similarity between proximal and distal regions within a haplotype would suggest the occurrence of sequence exchange. Using this approach, we identified a large ~16.7 Kbp region that showed higher identity between the proximal and distal units of the Kawasaki haplotype than between the CH17 distal and Kawasaki proximal units ( Figure 3A ). This region included two IGKV genes for which we observed allelic variants between the Kawasaki and CH17 haplotypes.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/006866 doi: bioRxiv preprint haplotype. It is important to note, however, that the Kawasaki distal fragment harbors many unique bp differences compared to the other three sequences (blue tick marks, Figure 3B ), which could be suggestive of the occurrence of mutation following the predicted sequence exchange event. Further analysis of this multi-sequence alignment using the DSS method for recombination detection also predicted two potential flanking recombination breakpoints within the expected regions based on visual inspection of the sequence alignment and comparison of sequence similarities. We also analyzed sequence from two BAC clones in the proximal and distal clusters from the RPCI-11 BAC library 18 ; this analysis revealed that these carried the same variants observed in the Kawasaki haplotype.",

This prompted us to also compare other genomic characteristics between the three loci. Excluding regions of structural variation between haplotypes, we first generated SNP calls (not including gaps and single bp indels) between the CH17 and reference haplotypes for all three loci; 491, 1046, and 2897 SNPs were identified for IGKV, IGLV, and IGHV, respectively (Table 2; Figure 4 , left panel).

An analysis of genomic features in the three loci also showed that the fraction of each locus covered by repeat content was highest in IGHV, whereas that covered by SDs, not surprisingly was highest in IGKV (Table 2 ). However, when SDs associated with the IGKV proximal/distal duplication event were excluded, SD coverage in IGHV (37.7%) was found to be much higher than both of the light chain loci (IGLV, 24.6%; IGKV, 28.2%; Table 2 ).

However, given the prevalence of segmental duplication in the IG loci, it will undoubtedly be essential to consider the impact of paralogous sequence variants (PSVs) when assessing 1KG SNP data in these regions, as complex and duplicated sequence structure are known to confound SNP characterization 36, 37 .",

Our first observation from this comparison was that the number of V gene allelic differences among the CH17 haplotypes was highest in IGHV. This finding is perhaps not surprising given that allelic richness is also known to be highest in IGHV based on available genetic data in the IMGT database. In addition, studies of substitution patterns in heavy and light chain V genes have also revealed evidence for increased diversity in IGHV compared to IGLV and IGKV 23, 39 . Strikingly, however, when we extended our comparison to include all SNPs within the three loci, we found that locus-wide genetic diversity was also much higher in IGHV, indicating that increased diversity in this locus is not limited to within V gene coding regions.

First, segmental duplications are known to be associated with SVs genome-wide 42 , and second, duplications have been shown specifically to facilitate structural variation in IGH 7 . Segmental duplications and tandem repeats also mediate sequence exchange either through gene conversion or recombination, that can either result in the homogenization of paralogous sequences 29, 30, 43 , or in an increase in genetic diversity 44, 45 . Illustrating the latter of these two scenarios, we found that for IGHV, SNP density was highest in regions including segmental duplications, particularly those with >95% sequence identity with their paralogs; similar trends were not noted for SNP density estimates calculated within non-SD repeat regions (Table 2) . Importantly, SDs with >95% identity comprised nearly twice the fraction of IGHV sequence than IGLV sequence, which may in part explain the differences observed in SNP density between IGH and IGL. It is also worth noting that the difference in the fraction of SDs between IGH and the light chain regions would be greater if the 222 Kbp of novel sequence (comprised primarily of SDs) identified in IGH by our previous study 7 were also included. In addition to this, assessments of CHM1 SNP density across autosomal telomeres and centromeres revealed that the telomeric region on chr14 containing IGHV had both elevated levels of SNP diversity, and increased SD .

            "text": "The fact that we found evidence of a large tract of sequence exchange between the proximal and distal IGKV units lends support to this notion. However, fully understanding the relationship between segmental duplication and SNP density in the human IG regions will undoubtedly require further sequencing and comparisons of additional haplotypes. We must also acknowledge the potential for confounding effects related to the use of mosaic reference sequences for this comparison 13,17,31 , which were generated from multiple large insert libraries constructed from diploid tissues, in some cases of unknown ethnicity. Considering this, it is possible that a comparison of CH17 IG regions to references generated from individuals with different ethnic backgrounds could result in artifactual differences between loci. However, because our findings are supported by existing V gene allelic variation data at the population level, it seems unlikely that the difference in variability between loci is due to ethnic origin of the tissue. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/006866 doi: bioRxiv preprint If the difference in SNP density observed here between the IG V gene clusters is in fact genuine, it raises the question of whether increased genetic diversity in IGH has any functional consequences. Given that SNP density within V gene coding regions in the CH17 haplotype was also higher in IGH compared to IGL and IGK, it could be speculated that mechanisms associated with an increased number of polymorphisms locus-wide in IGHV, could by default, result in greater IGHV gene diversity and a more variable expressed antibody repertoire. Intriguingly, in natural antibodies, the IG heavy chains are considered to play a more prominent role in epitope binding than IG light chains, although this is primarily attributed to residues of the third complementary determining region (CDRH3) not encoded by IGHV gene segments 46 ",

A sequence similarity plot was then generated for each pair-wise comparison using 10 kbp windows with a sliding size of 500 bp, as reported previously 17 . Sequences, ~22.5 kbp in length, from the region suspected to harbor a potential recombination event between proximal and distal regions, were extracted from each haplotype (proximal and distal) and aligned using ClustalW 59 within ebioX (http://www.ebioinformatics.org/ebiox/). Recombination/gene conversion analysis based on this alignment was conducted using the Difference of Sums of Squares (DSS) method within TOPALi v2 60, 61 . This method is based on comparing the branching patterns of two trees constructed using the first and second halves of sequence alignments within a given window of a larger alignment being analyzed; the fit between these two trees and the calculation of DSS is measured using the sum of squares. Windows in which trees differ significantly between the two halves are scored with high DSS values, and are thus candidate sites for recombination. The parameters used here for this analysis were as follows: a window size of 2.5 Kbp with a step size of 100 bp; the Jukes-Cantor substitution model for calculating distance matrices; 500 bootstrap iterations to test for significance; and the analysis was conducted in both forward and reverse directions along the alignment.",

The proximal contig, containing four BACs, spanned from 170 Kbp downstream of IGKC to within the intron of IGKV2-40; thus, this contig lacked 10.9 Kbp of known sequence upstream of IGKV2-40 characterized in the initial genomic description of the locus, representing a small gap in the CH17 sequence. In the distal region, four complete BACs were assembled into a single contig spanning 60 Kbp upstream of IGLV2D-40 to 22 Kbp downstream of the most distal gene in the locus, IGHV3D-7. This sequence included ~49 kbp of additional sequence (compared to the Kawasaki haplotype) extending into the assembly gap between the proximal and distal units, which is predicted to be 800 kbp 17,26 . The sequence extending into the unsequenced gap is dominated by complex repeats (Supplementary Figure 1), likely contributing to the difficulty of completing assemblies in this region. Alleles at forty-four functional/ORF IGKV genes, 22 in each of the proximal and distal regions, as well as five IGKJ genes, and a single IGKC gene in the proximal region were characterized and compared to those found in the IGK Kawasaki haplotype (Figure 2; Supplementary",

In IGL, for example, only three insertion-deletion variants of functional genes have been identified, involving IGLV1-50, IGLV8-61, and IGLV5-3915,21 ; although, the deletion of IGLV8-61 was identified in only a single individual.

However, there are several examples demonstrating essential functions of IGHV germline-encoded variation in antigen specificity; for example, residues encoded by germline IGHV1-69 alleles have been shown to make important contributions to neutralizing antibody responses against influenza, hepatitis C, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 11,47,48 . Whether increased genetic diversity in IGHV is associated with the dominant role of the heavy chain in antibody function remains to be seen. In addition, there is still much to be learned about the contribution of IG genetic polymorphism to variability in expressed repertoires and the implications of this variation for susceptibility to infectious and autoimmune diseases, responses to therapeutic antibodies and vaccines, and other clinical outcomes. These outstanding questions stress the importance of accurately representing standing genetic variation in the human IG loci.",

For IGKV and IGLV, 10 kbp downstream of the most proximal V gene and 10 Kbp upstream of the most distal V gene were compared totalling 858,805 and 858,244 bp of aligned sequence, respectively (the large insertion variant identified in CH17 within IGLV was not included). The lengths of aligned sequence are based on bp coordinates in the Matsuda (IGH) and Kawasaki (IGL and IGK) haplotypes. CH17 and reference haplotypes were aligned on a per locus basis and SNPs were determined from the resulting alignments using the same commands from MUMmer3.0 referenced above. Single nucleotide variants called from CHM1 cell line DNA using whole-genome paired-end Illumina short-read sequencing (Steinberg et al., manuscript in preparation; NCBI BioProject ID: 176729) were used to assess the accuracy of variants called from the CH17 assemblies. To do this, the NCBI remap tool (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/tools/remap) was used to convert the GRCh37 coordinates to the CHM1_1.1 assembly coordinates (Genbank Accession: GCA_000306695.2), which were then compared with variant calls generated from the alignment of CHM1 Illumina data to the CHM1_1.1 assemblies. Variants in both callsets were flagged as unsupported by the Illumina data, and deemed errors in the CHM1_1.1 assembly. The coordinates of V gene exon boundaries based on the Vega gene annotation track, repeat content (RepeatMasker 3.2.7; www.repeatmasker.org), SDs 62,63 , and centromere/telomere coordinates were downloaded from UCSC (www.genome.ucsc.edu). Percent sequence identity values for SDs were also downloaded from UCSC and used for partitioning the SD datasets.Locus coverage and SNP density values were calculated using BEDTools version 2.1.
