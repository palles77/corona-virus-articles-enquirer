The results showed that SARS _ NP existed in vitro as oligomer, more probably dimer, as the basic functional unit. This protein shows its maximum conformational stability near pH 9.0, and it seems that its oligomer dissociation and protein unfolding occur simultaneously. Thermal-induced unfolding for SARS _ NP was totally irreversible. Both the thermal and chemical denaturant-induced denaturation analyses showed that oligomeric SARS _ NP unfolds and refolds through a two-state model, and the electrostatic interactions among the charge groups of SARS _ NP made a significant contribution to its conformational stability.

For coronaviruses, NP plays an important role in the host cell entry and virus particle assembly and release [13] [14] [15] . In particular, it binds to a defined packaging signal of viral RNA, leading to the formation of the helical nucleocapsid. NP is incorporated into virions by intracellular budding through a membrane containing three envelope proteins: the M glycoprotein [15] , the E protein and S glycoprotein [16] . Additionally, NP has been proposed to be multifunctional with additional roles in replication, transcription and translation for coronaviruses [17] [18] [19] .",

In addition, the unfolding and refolding characterizations of SARS _ NP dimer caused by thermaland chemical denaturant-induced denaturations were also inspected by fluorescent and CD spectral investigation, it is found that SARS _ NP exhibits its most stable conformation near pH 9.0, and its oligomer dissociation and protein unfolding seem to be of coinstantaneous occurring events.",

It is found that at its low concentration around 1.0 mg/ml, SARS _ NP tends to form largely in monomer involving a small quantity of dimer (Lane 1), and the amount of dimer is fortified with the increasing concentration of SARS _ NP (~1.5 mg/ml) as indicated in lane 2. When the protein concentration was higher (~3.0 mg/ml), the trimer state of SARS _ NP appeared (Lane 4). Such a result suggested that homo-oligomerization of SARS _ NP is of concentration dependence. Due to the difficulty in obtaining large quantity of soluble SARS _ NP and the weak visualization of Coomassie brilliant blue dye for SARS _ NP in gel, higher polymer than trimer could not be obtained for SARS _ NP by native gel.",

According to the reference proteins, these two peaks might be ascribed to the dimer and monomer of SARS _ NP, respectively; SARS _ NP at 2.5 mg/ml had a new small elution peak at 23.8 ml, which may be ascribed to SARS _ NP trimer. This is in agreement with the results of non-denatured gel electrophoresis that oligomer formation of SRAS _ NP is of concentration dependence. According to Fig. 1B , SARS _ NP at 0.2 mg/ml contained equivalent ratio of monomer and dimer, and at 2.5 mg/ml, it existed as a mixture with more dimer and less monomer and trimer. It is noticed that in native gel experiment, SARS _ NP at different concentrations existed mostly in monomer state. This might be resulted from the experimental differences between native gel and gel filtration. The heat generated during the native gel test might cause some of the protein oligomer to dissociate into monomer.",

To avoid the non-specific interactions, an equivalent amount of lysozyme was immobilized on the sensor chip as a reference. As shown in Fig. 2 , even under very low concentrations (below 4 AM or 0.2 mg/ml), SARS _ NP has tendency to assemble as dimer based on the fact that the binding curves in the sensor gram showed saturation tendency at 2000 RU, nearly equivalent to the coupling level of 2400 RU. This result is in accordance with the fact obtained in size-exclusion chromatography experiment that SARS _ NP exists as oligomer at 0.2 mg/ml. Furthermore, as indicated in Fig. 2 , when SARS _ NP concentration was higher than 4 AM (0.2 mg/ml), the binding level exceeded the immobilized one (2400 RU) on the sensor chip and increased in a linear way; this may be tentatively attributed to the formation of trimer (or higher polymer) for SRAS _ NP. Therefore, based on the results from the non-denatured gel, gel filtration analyses and the preliminary SPR data, it is suggested that SARS _ NP might exist in oligomer, more probably dimer, as the basic functional unit in vivo. As can be seen from Fig. 2 (dotted curves), the trimer (or higher polymer) of SARS _ NP departed quickly firstly then appeared as the similar dissociation course to that of dimer, suggesting that during the dissociation course of SARS _ NP oligomer, it firstly dissociates into dimer. The quicker dissociation course indicates that the structure of SARS _ NP polymer is possibly less compact than that of its dimer.",

(2) (The fitting goodness was shown in Fig 4C  and D) , and DH m was plotted against T m (transition midpoint of thermal-induced denaturation) to obtain DC p by linear fitting (Fig. 4E) (Eq. (4) ). The averaged DC p of 1.5039F0.0567 kcal/mol was used to calculate DG8 (Eq. (5)), and the entropy changes (DS m ) (Eq. (6)) at different pH values. It was found that SARS _ NP is more stable in alkaline than in acidic condition, indicating that the variation of the electric charge of the protein with pH change will modify the intra-molecular cooperative process [37] . Table 1 summarizes the thermodynamic parameters for characterizing the thermal denaturation of SARS _ NP by fluorescence intensity, emission k max and CD ellipticity at 222 nm at different pH. In the pH ranges from 6.0 to 9.0, T m increases with the increasing pH, e.g. from 42 8C at pH 6.0 to 48 8C at pH 9.0. However, T m decreases with increasing pH after 9.0. The free energy (DG8) of unfolding is used to estimate the protein stability in enduring the denaturants, high DG8 means the protein might be more stable against denaturant [28] . Comparing the DG8 values of SARS _ NP at different pH, the conformational stability of SARS-NP is highest near pH 9.0, with the highest DG8 about 4.459 kcal/mol.",

The native SARS _ NP exhibited emission k max around 333F0.5 nm, and k max of SARS _ NP was found to shift to 346F1 nm when denatured by urea and GuHCl, as expected for a tryptophan exposed to solvent.

The equilibrium unfolding transitions induced by these two denaturants are not always similar to each other, and the difference might be more related to the ionic character for GuHCl [38] . GuHClinduced unfolding of SARS _ NP obeys the similar transition pattern as the urea-induced unfolding. However, as shown in Table 2 , DG u H 2 O obtained by GuHCl-induced unfolding is a little bigger than that by urea-induced unfolding, at pH 9.0, for example, 7.1884 kcal/mol for urea-induced unfold- ing and 7.801 kcal/mol for GuHCl. Such a difference in free energy of unfolding may thus be also attributed to the ionic effect of GuHCl.",

SARS _ NP is prone to assembling itself as dimer below~4 AM and incompact oligomer at higher concentration (over 4 AM) in the absence of genomic RNA. SARS _ NP might exist in oligomer, more probably dimer, as the basic functional unit in vivo. Thermal and chemical denaturant-induced denaturations of SARS _ NP are subject to the two-state transition model: NU. In addition, it is found that the dissociation of subunit and loss of SARS _ NP structure are of simultaneous events. The denaturation investigation has proved that SARS _ NP shows its most stable conformation near pH 9.0 with the highest DG u H 2 O and DG8. The electrostatic interactions among the charge groups make a significant contribution to the conformational stability for SARS _ NP. Thermal-induced unfolding and refolding are irreversible, while urea-induced unfolding of SARS _ NP is nearly reversible. ing SARS from the Ministry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China and Shanghai Science and Technology Commission.",
