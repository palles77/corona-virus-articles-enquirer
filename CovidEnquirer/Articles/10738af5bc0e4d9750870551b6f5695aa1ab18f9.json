Type II patients had monoclonal component (with the same isotype as anti-C1Inh antibody) when angioedema was diagnosed. Most type I patients had lymphoproliferative disorders or systemic diseases when angioedema was diagnosed. Five type II patients presented with hypertension, as compared with 1 patient with type I disease. Four type II patients were treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors when they had the first angioedema attack, as compared with none with type I disease. These drugs are known to trigger attacks of angioedema by inhibition of bradykinin degradation (4) . Discontinuation of ACE inhibitor use did not affect the course of angioedema.",

Treatment procedures also varied among patients (Table) . Danazol was prescribed most frequently; it was effective, but patients often needed high daily doses (100 to 600 mg/d). Tranexamic acid, which was rarely used, was effective in only 1 patient with type II disease. A good clinical response was observed in all 3 patients with type I disease who were taking corticosteroids, as well as in 1 of the 2 patients with type II disease. Immunosuppressive drugs were clinically effective in type I patients, with partial restoration of biological activity. However, the 1 patient with type II disease who took immunosuppressive drugs died (laryngeal edema). In conclusion, the data suggest that danazol would be effective in the treatment of acquired angioedema, although tranexamic acid, which was rarely used in these patients, may also be a good rational prophylactic choice as proposed by Cugno et al (5) .",

Her chest radiograph showed bilateral pneumonic patches. Because SARS was suspected, she was admitted to our hospital on April 28. She was intubated and given midazolam and succinylcholine for respiratory failure. Fever of up to 39\u00b0C was noted on the same day. Repeat blood, urine, and sputum cultures did not yield any pathogens. Vero cells from a throat swab yielded a coronavirus. SARS-associated coronavirus infection was confirmed by detection of coronavirus ribonucleic acid by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests from sputum. Serum creatine kinase level increased from 21 to 13,834 U/L from May 2 to 3, while serum creatinine level increased to 3.27 mg/dL. By May 6, serum creatine kinase level had increased to a peak value of 339,750 U/L, even after hydration and alkalization, while serum myoglobin level had increased to 167 ng/mL (normal, \u03fd70 ng/mL). Rhabdomyolysis was diagnosed clinically. Acute renal failure developed on May 4 and the patient went into a deep coma. She died 3 weeks later due to secondary bacterial infection despite mechanical ventilatory support, hemodialysis, and antibiotic treatment. A skeletal muscle biopsy specimen showed necrotic muscle fibers, basophilic change of sarcoplasm, enlarged vesicular nuclei, and centrally located nuclei.",
