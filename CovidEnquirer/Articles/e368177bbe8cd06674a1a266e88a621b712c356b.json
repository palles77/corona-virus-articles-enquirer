            "text": "Background: Palivizumab is a respiratory syncitial virus (RSV)neutralizing monoclonal antibody clinically used for the prevention of severe RSV infections in high-risk infants, preterm infants and infants with hemodynamically significant heart disease or chronic lung disease. Palivizumab acts by blocking the fusion step of virus replication. Mutants resistant to palivizumab were isolated in vitro and also in children with RSV infection while receiving palivizumab. The mutations reported are situated on the fusion protein (amino acids 262-276), in the liaison site of the palivizumab. It seems that mutations out of the liaison site do not confer resistance to palivizumab. The gene coding for the attachement glycoprotein (G gene) was rarely sequenced. The aim of this study was to analyze the complete F and G genes sequences coding the surface glycoproteins of RSV isolates collected from patients receiving palivizumab.",

Differentiated tissues were infected in parallel with clinically relevant strains of rhinovirus (A16, A49, A55, B48, C8, C15), respiratory enterovirus (EV68), influenza virus (H3N2) and corona virus (OC43).

Interestingly, (i) Oseltamivir reduced the replication of H1N1 and H3N2 and restored the impaired barrier function monitored by Trans-Epithelial Electrical Resistance and (ii) Rupintivir restored the mucociliary clearance impaired by EV68 (7 m/s for the Mock up to 40 m/s for the Rupintrivir treatment at 50 nM at 96 h post innoculation).",

In recent years, the epidemic process is characterized by co-circulation of influenza virus subtypes A(H1N1), A(H3N2) and type B. In determining the etiology of viral infection serological analysis is one of the fundamental components. Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) permit to dramatically increase the specificity and sensitivity of diagnostic techniques for the detection of viral antigens. Immunological characteristics of MAbs produced against the Kazakhstan isolates of influenza A(H1N1) virus were studied with immunofluorescence, HAI and microneutralization assays. Immunofluorescence testing revealed that MAbs are specific against homologous and related antigens, and identified them in the form of distinct granular fluorescence before the conjugate dilutions of 1:80-1:160. It was found that MAbs in HAI assay revealed a wide range of responses and in high titres (1:160-1:10240) inhibited the hemagglutinating activity of the homologous and related reference and Kazakhstan influenza viruses and did not react with the heterologous A(H3N2) and type B viruses. In microneutralization assay MAbs neutralized influenza A(H1N1) viruses and did not react with influenza viruses A(H3N2) and type B. Thereby, the similar spectra of MAb reactivity against A/H1N1 viruses indicate the presence of antigenic determinants in the HA composition of all the investigated viruses, that allows to recommend the resulting MAbs for differentiation of A(H1N1) viruses from the seasonal A(H3N2) and type B strains. Introduction: Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is rapidly gaining importance as one of the most economically significant diseases in swine worldwide. PRRSV is an enveloped positive single-stranded RNA virus that can be divided into two different genotypes, the European genotype (type 1) and the North American genotype (type 2). The genome of PRRSV is approximately 15 kb in length and contains at least 20 open reading frames (ORFs). ORF5, encoding GP5, is one of the most variable regions of the PRRSV genome, and often used to examine genetic diversity and monitor evolution of PRRSV. In this study, the recent isolates in the field were evaluated for genetic variation based on ORF5 nucleotide and amino acid sequence.",

To obtain sequences of the complete ORF5, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was carried out using the One Step RT-PCR Kit (QIAGEN) and PRRSV primer sets derived from sequences of the ORF4-6 of the LV and VR-2332 strain, respectively. Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees were carried out using CLC Main Workbench 7.0.3 and Mega 6 program.

The results showed that both types 1 and 2 have been circulating in Korea pig farms and that the regional rate of infection was more prevalent in Gyeongsangnam-do province in Korea. Type 1 PRRSVs from Korea are clustered in subtype 1, subgroup A, B, and C. Type 2 PRRSVs are classified in lineage 1, 4, 5 and new Korea subgroup A, B. Recently, the genetics of type 2 PRRSVs in Korea have become unique regional characteristics in Gyeongsangnam-do. Recently, the genetics of PRRSVs in Asia have become more diverse.
