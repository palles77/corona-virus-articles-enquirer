We divided emerging infectious diseases into four categories, with subcategories in categories 1 and 4. The categorization was based on the nature and characteristics of pathogens or infectious agents causing the emerging infections, which are directly related to the mechanisms and patterns of infectious disease emergence. The factors or combinations of factors contributing to the emergence of these pathogens vary within each category. We also classified public health laboratories into three types based on function, namely, research, reference and analytical diagnostic laboratories, with the last category being subclassified into primary (community-based) public health and clinical (medical) analytical diagnostic laboratories. The frontline/leading and/or supportive roles to be adopted by each type of public health laboratory for optimal performance to establish the correct etiological agents causing the diseases or outbreaks vary with respect to each category of emerging infectious diseases. We emphasize the need, especially for an outbreak investigation, to establish a harmonized and coordinated national public health laboratory system that integrates different categories of public health laboratories within a country and that is closely linked to the national public health delivery system and regional and international high-end laboratories.",

            "text": "Infectious diseases have affected humans since the first recorded history of man. Infectious diseases remain the second leading cause of death worldwide despite the recent rapid developments and advancements in modern medicine, science and biotechnology. Greater than 15 million (.25%) of an estimated 57 million deaths that occur throughout the world annually are directly caused by infectious diseases. Millions more deaths are due to the secondary effects of infections. Moreover, infectious diseases cause increased morbidity and a loss of work productivity as a result of compromised health and disability, accounting for approximately 30% of all disability-adjusted life years globally. 1, 2 Compounding the existing infectious disease burden, the world has experienced an increased incidence and transboundary spread of emerging infectious diseases due to population growth, urbanization and globalization over the past four decades. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Most of these newly emerging and re-emerging pathogens are viruses, although fewer than 200 of the approximately 1400 pathogen species recognized to infect humans are viruses. On average, however, more than two new species of viruses infecting humans are reported worldwide every year, 9 most of which are likely to be RNA viruses. 6 Emerging novel viruses are a major public health concern with the potential of causing high health and socioeconomic impacts, as has occurred with progressive pandemic infectious diseases such as human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV), the recent pandemic caused by the novel quadruple re-assortment strain of influenza A virus (H1N1), and more transient events such as the outbreaks of Nipah virus in 1998/1999 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus in 2003. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] In addition, other emerging infections of regional or global interest include highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, henipavirus, Ebola virus, expanded multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis and antimicrobial resistant microorganisms, as well as acute hemorrhagic diseases caused by hantaviruses, arenaviruses and dengue viruses.",

The diagnostic laboratory plays a central role in identifying the etiological agent causing an outbreak and provides timely, accurate information required to guide control measures. This is exemplified by the epidemic of Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1998/1999, which took more than six months to effectively control as a consequence of the misdiagnosis of the etiologic agent and the resulting implementation of incorrect control measures. 15, 16 However, there are occasions when control measures must be based on the epidemiological features of the outbreak and pattern of disease transmission, as not all pathogens are easily identifiable in the early stage of the outbreak (Figure 1 ). Establishing laboratory and epidemiological capacity at the country and regional levels, therefore, is critical to minimize the impact of future emerging infectious disease epidemics. Developing such public health capacity requires commitment on the part of all countries in the region. However, to develop and establish such an effective national public health capacity, especially the laboratory component to support infectious disease surveillance, outbreak investigation and early response, a good understanding of the concepts of emerging infectious diseases and an integrated country and regional public health laboratory system in accordance with the nature and type of emerging pathogens, especially novel ones, are highly recommended.",

            "text": "Traditionally, emerging infectious diseases are broadly defined as infections that: (i) have newly appeared in a population; (ii) are increasing in incidence or geographic range; or (iii) whose incidence threatens to increase in the near future. 6, 17 Six major factors, and combinations of these factors, have been reported to contribute to disease emergence and re-emergence: (i) changes in human demographics and behavior; (ii) advances in technology and changes in industry practices; (iii) economic development and changes in land use patterns; (iv) dramatic increases in volume and speed of international travel and commerce; (v) microbial mutation and adaptation; and (vi) inadequate public health capacity. 6, 17 From the perspective of public health planning and preparedness for effective emerging infectious disease surveillance, outbreak investigation and early response, the above working definition of emerging infectious disease and its associated factors that contribute to infectious disease emergence are too broad and generic for more specific application and for the development of a national public health system, especially in the context of a public health laboratory system in a country. Thus, in this article, emerging infectious diseases are divided into four categories based on the nature and characteristics of pathogens or infectious agents causing the emerging infections; these categories are summarized in Table 1 . The categorization is based on the patterns of infectious disease emergence and modes leading to the discovery of the causative novel pathogens. The factors or combinations of factors contributing to the emergence of these pathogens also vary within each category. Likewise, the strategic approaches and types of public health preparedness that need to be adopted, in particular with respect to the types of public health laboratories that need to be developed for optimal system performance, will also vary greatly with respect to each category of emerging infectious diseases. These four categories of emerging infectious diseases and the factors that contribute to the emergence of infectious diseases in each category are briefly described below. [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] Factors that contributed to the occurrence of emerging infectious diseases in this subcategory include population growth; urbanization; environmental and anthropogenic driven ecological changes; increased volume and speed of international travel and commerce with rapid, massive movement of people, animals and commodities; and deterioration of public health infrastructure. Subcategory 1b includes known and unknown infectious agents that occur in new host 'niches'. Infectious microbes/ agents placed under this subcategory are better known as 'opportunistic' pathogens that normally do not cause disease in immunocompetent human hosts but that can lead to serious diseases in immunocompromised individuals. The increased susceptibility of human hosts to infectious agents is largely due to the HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome pandemic, and to a lesser extent, due to immunosuppression resulting from cancer chemotherapy, antirejection treatments in transplant recipients, and drugs and monoclonal antibodies that are used to treat autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders. A notable example is the increased incidence of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that is caused by the polyomavirus 'JC' following the Public health laboratories in emerging infectious diseases KB Chua and DJ Gubler 2 increased use of immunomodulatory therapies for anti-rejection regimens and for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. 24 ",

Accidental or potentially intentional release of laboratory manipulated strains resulting in epidemics is included in this category. Factors that lead to the spillovers and emergence of these novel pathogens are human population expansion, economic development, changes in land use patterns, modifications to natural habitats, and changes in agricultural practices and animal husbandry. Human behavior, such as wildlife trade and translocations, live animal and bush meat markets, consumption of exotic foods, development of ecotourism, access to petting zoos and ownership of exotic pets, also plays a significant role in the transfer of pathogens between species. 19 [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] Examples of infectious diseases under category 4b are gastritis and peptic ulcers due to Helicobacter pylori, Kaposi sarcoma due to human herpesvirus 8 and chronic hepatitis due to hepatitis virus C and G.

Ideally, the national reference laboratory should have state-of-the-art laboratory technology and be able to identify and characterize novel pathogens with specialized university laboratories and foreign institutes that can provide backup capability, but more importantly, the national reference laboratory should be able to conduct research for the development of new diagnostic technologies to detect and identify novel pathogens, especially those classified as category 4. The US system, which includes local and state public health laboratories that conduct diagnoses of known pathogens, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and university laboratories that provide research and reference activities, is a good model.",

The situation is further complicated by the siting of various pathogen-specific diagnostic laboratories in different buildings or institutes or different locations within a country, thus preventing more cost-effective measures of sharing common equipment and reagents, clinical samples, information and human resources. Finally, the problem is compounded by policy makers and laboratory managers lacking flexibility and not allowing these disease or pathogen-specific laboratories to adopt a more generic approach in the investigation of infectious disease outbreaks.",

The proposed integrated system of public health laboratories is not entirely new; public health laboratories are already in existence in most countries, but most are poorly equipped and are not adequately funded or staffed with trained professional staff. Moreover, a lack of knowledge and coordination has led to ineffective operation in the support of infectious disease surveillance. The basic concept of realigning and harmonizing public health laboratories to optimize their roles and functions can be drawn from the system of medical practices. Due to rapid and vast expansion of medical knowledge, technology and demand of specialized skills and therapy, medical practices have evolved into a number of specialties and subspecialties, such as infectious disease, cardiology, gastroenterology, neurology, radiology, anesthesiology and oncology. An excellent aspect of the medical system is the continual retention of the general physician (family physician) or general pediatrician as the initial or first entry point for patients seeking consultation for any medical problem before being subsequently referred to the appropriate specialist, if deemed necessary. It is not uncommon for patients, especially older individuals, to have more than one disease or pathology at the time of presentation to the doctor. In a similar manner, in outbreaks of infectious diseases, 'background' endemic pathogens are often present that are capable of similar disease manifestations. Thus, public health analytical diagnostic laboratories (both primary and clinical) should adopt a generic approach and serve as the initial or first entry point for the investigation of the causative pathogens in the event of an infectious disease outbreak or the occurrence of any fatal illness with clinical suspicion of infectious etiology.",

Despite the presence of several types of health laboratories, they can be classified into three main categories: (i) public health research laboratories; (ii) public health reference laboratories; and (iii) public health analytical diagnostic laboratories. Public health analytical diagnostic laboratories can be further subcategorized into primary public health (community-based) and clinical/medical (hospital and clinic-based) analytical diagnostic laboratories. A proposed organizational model to establish an integrated system of public health laboratories within a country to coordinate and link health laboratories under different ministries and in both public and private institutions based on their functional roles is shown in Figure 2 . The broken lines indicate the diagnostic laboratories that are not directly regulated by the ministry of health. A schematic flow chart illustrating the functional relationships and linkages between various types of public health laboratories in a country was described previously. 51 A defined and harmonious linkage and collaboration will not only avoid duplication and redundancy, but also enhance and complement the function and output quality of each laboratory. Bearing in mind that not all countries in the world have similar resources (financial, man-power and expertise), demography, geopolitical structure, needs and commitment, the proposed model can be appropriately modified to tailor each country's immediate needs with a provision for future upgrading and expansion. Ultimately, it is recommended that all countries establish an integrated system covering all three categories of public health laboratories, with a cohesive centralized national public health reference laboratory.",

For countries without such an idealistic centralized public health reference laboratory, an in-place system of networking should be developed to link to regional and international high-end laboratories or WHO Collaborative Centers to rapidly identify and characterize novel pathogens and provide other specialized laboratory diagnostic reagents, assays or validation. In addition, each region should have a regional center for reference Public health laboratories in emerging infectious diseases KB Chua and DJ Gubler 4 and research to help the national reference and/or diagnostic laboratories train and maintain laboratory quality control. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is a major WHO collaborative partner and provides laboratory service not only for the American region, but also for many other countries in the world. Investigations into the diagnosis of Nipah virus, SARS coronavirus, pandemic influenza A virus and hemorrhagic fever viruses are just a few examples illustrating its worldwide function. The placement of the centralized reference laboratory under the National Center for Disease Control strengthens close communication and coordination among public health specialists, epidemiologist and laboratory personnel and serves as an important coordinating center to support the functions and activities pertaining to biorisk issues, centralized pathogen characterization and storage, laboratory-based surveillance and laboratory quality assurance, as shown in Figure 2 .",

The proposed network scheme will provide more cost-efficient laboratory services and ensure a regular flow of laboratory work to maintain the competency of technical staff to produce quality output. Because of the increased likelihood of epidemic diseases caused by novel pathogens, diagnostic laboratories serving as the primary entry point of investigation should be able to take a more generic approach in pathogen detection, isolation and identification. The traditional existing system of 'compartmentalization' of national disease/pathogenspecific diagnostic laboratories should thus be reviewed and integrated into the national public health infectious disease diagnostic laboratory system.
