External biosecurity involves practices and techniques directed at the prevention of entry of new diseases into a group of animals. Internal biosecurity or biocontainment, involves practices and techniques that are directed at the prevention or spread of disease within an existing group of animals. External biosecurity is particularly important in North America camelid operations due to the extensive movement of animals for breeding or show purposes. Internal biosecurity typically involves this the prevention and treatment of failure of passive transfer, maintenance of proper nutrition and housing, and the implementation of an appropriate vaccination program for endemic or relevant diseases. Attention to appropriate cleaning and disinfection procedures related to housing, feeding, and treatment equipment is important for the maintenance of both internal and external biosecurity practices. This paper discusses various risk factors associated with the control of infectious disease in the context of external and internal biosecurity measures in camelids operations.",

The concept of biosecurity is not new, however it is likely that renewed awareness has been \u0b1d This paper is part of the special issue entitled Special Issue on accelerated by several factors. Recent international events such as the outbreak of foot and mouth Disease (FMD) in the United Kingdom and Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE, mad cow disease) in Europe and US has demonstrated vulnerability of national animal resources. The potential risk of agri-terrorism has also helped spur global interest in biosecurity. Notwithstanding these events, biosecurity in the alpaca industry is, and will be, primarily driven by breeders and veterinarians in order to optimize the care and production of alpacas. Biosecurity can be defined as those efforts designed to prevent the introduction and spread of disease in a population, herd, or group of animals (Thomson, 1999) . These efforts can be further categorized into external measures (external biosecurity), those directed at prevention of entry of new diseases into a group; internal measures (internal biosecurity, biocontainment), those directed at prevention of spread of disease within a group (Dargatz et al., 2002) . Therefore, biosecurity can be implemented at various levels, from those involving specific farms to governmental regulationzs involving importation of animals. To be valid, the minimum biosecurity plan should address: (1) the means of isolating new animals introduced into an existing herd or group of animals, (2) the regulation of animal, worker and equipment trafficking (movement), and (3) the design and implementation of cleaning and disinfection procedures directed at the reduction of pathogen load within a herd or group of animals.",

Yet, overdependence on these technologies may have inadvertently fostered a level of indifference to more traditional management components involved in disease control, namely biosecurity (Anderson, 1998) . Many examples exist whereby in the face of an outbreak, both producers and veterinarians rapidly seek the development of a new vaccine rather than address basic principals of internal and external biosecurity. Ideally, management should strive to incorporate and coordinate a spectrum of available tools, from the execution of optimal husbandry practices to the implementation of modern technologies.",

Regardless of the species of animal, the most common means by which contagious diseases are introduced to a herd involves the introduction of new animals. Clearly, introduction of new animals displaying any clinical signs of disease should be avoided. More-over, producers must realize that the mere exclusion of clinically affected animals is insufficient for preventing disease introduction. Animals that appear to be clinically normal can be either incubating disease or be subclinically affected. In fact, it is well documented that within most populations of animals, only a fraction of animals typically exhibit clinical disease, whereas a larger proportion are subclinically affected. Consequently, appropriate and effective efforts in biosecurity must focus on the entire population of animals, rather than prioritize only those clinically affected.",

As previously mentioned, the most prevalent means of introducing disease into a group of animals is via the addition of new animals to the herd. It is important to realize the breadth of the concept of this \"new animal\" (or animals). Acquisition of an animal which has never resided on a farm is inherently seen as new. However, the concept of a new animal should also include the reintroduction of those which have been temporarily residing at other facilities. When animals are commingled at breeding farms or shows, there is an increased risk of disease transmission. Importantly, transfer of certain agents does not necessarily require direct contact between animals. Some pathogens are efficiently transmitted in the air or water, some can survive in soil or organic debris for extended periods (weeks to months), and some are efficiently transmitted via fomites (equipment, tack, etc.), pests (flies, rodents, etc.), or personnel (Barrington et al., 2002) .",

Buyers should not only be knowledgeable about the current health status of the herd of origin, but also seek historical information concerning past diseases or conditions within the herd. Specific conditions to inquire about might include respiratory diseases, gastro-intestinal conditions (diarrhea, etc.), ill thrift, failure of passive transfer, abortion, and other herd-based disease. In addition to seeking historical information concerning disease occurrence, buyers should also be knowledgeable concerning fundamental biosecurity practices of the herd of origin. Questions regarding animal movement, quarantine practices, disease testing, vaccination practices, de-worming schedules, and other herd health practices should be asked.

Typically such events include the commingling of numerous animals from different sources. Many animals have traveled long distances and have been housed for varying periods of time. Upon arrival, changes in environment can serve as a source of stress for animals. Some changes might include new footing/bedding, different temperatures/humidity/ventilation, variation in lighting, different water or feed source, and different personnel. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that significant risk of disease exists in these settings, despite the fact that animals attending such events typically have been examined and deemed to be healthy on health certificates. The stresses of travel, commingling, and environmental changes may exacerbate latent disease conditions resulting in the onset of clinical disease, or at least the shedding of organisms that went unnoticed during the time of veterinary inspection.",

To obtain adequate passive transfer of immunity, crias must consume and absorb an adequate mass of colostral immunoglobulin in a timely manner. In general, alpaca colostrum contains a relatively high concentration of immunoglobulin, therefore FPT rarely occurs as a result of poor colostrum quality. Instead, FPT in crias generally results from a failure to nurse appropriately within the first hours of life. Factors associated with a cria that is unable to nurse include neonatal maladjustment (hypoxia at parturition), cleft palate, choanal atresia, fractures or other causes that limit mobility or nursing. Hypothermia or mis-adventure could result if a cria is born unsupervised or at pasture. Maternal factors associated FPT in crias include mis-mothering, teat or udder abnormalities, agalactia, or conditions causing recumbency of the dam. While the degree of intervention deemed necessary during and after parturition is debatable, at the least owners should be instructed to visually monitor the birthing process and initial nursing activity.",

Owners should be instructed to routinely weigh their animals, or alternatively be instructed in methods of palpation to determine body condition scores. Once animals are determined to be thin or loosing body condition, owners should be assisted in determining the cause of the weight loss. In contrast to the problem of underfeeding or thin body-conditioned animals, overfeeding of alpacas is typically a more frequent occurrence. Obese animals are more likely to be infertile and develop hyperthermia. Over-conditioning of animals may also exacerbate primary diseases, both non-infectious and infectious.

Importantly, extra-label use carries no assurance of efficacy or safety. Therefore, the basic foundation for immunizing alpacas is rather limited and includes immunization with C. perfringens type C and D toxoid, and C. tetani toxoid. A killed rabies vaccine and a leptospirosis bacterin can be used if either disease is endemic. While several other vaccines have been administered to alpacas, it is advisable that any modified-live virus vaccine or live bacterin be used with extreme caution in an extra label manner.

Prevention of heat stress should center on management changes that facilitates cooling (Middleton and Parish, 1999) .
