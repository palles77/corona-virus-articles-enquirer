Of the large spectrum of 52 histologically different tumour types, the highest incidences were observed for adenomas of the pituitary gland and adenomas/adenocarcinomas of the adrenal cortex in both sexes, mammary gland tumours and endometrial carcinomas in females, and C-cell adenomas/adenocarcinomas of the thyroid gland and tumours of the haemopoietic system in males. Of these, the high incidences of tumours of the haemopoietic system in males (27.7 %) and of endometrial carcinomas in females (45.2 %) should be considered as characteristic features of the strain.",

All studies were performed with virgin animals under almost identical maintenance conditions. The development of endometrial carcinomas in virgin rats may be explained by an unopposed oestrogenic stimulation of the endometrium, caused by hormonal disorders and the development of a permanent oestrus in virgin rats at the end of their first year of life (Lu et al. 1985; DEERBERG and KASPAREIT 1987) . In humans, endometrial carcinomas are the most frequent neoplasms of the female genital tract. There is good epidemiologic evidence that use of oestrogens promotes the development of endometrial cancer, the risk increasing with increasing duration of use (ANTUNES et al. 1979; EWERTZ et al. 1988 ). The primary exogenous sources of oestrogen are oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy during the menopause (ZIEL 1982; HENDERSON et al. 1988) .",
