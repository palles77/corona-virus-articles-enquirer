            "text": "This chapter focuses on the diagnosis, treatment, and control of large animal diseases primarily affecting the nervous system. In general, the principles of clinical neurology and their application to large animal neurology has not kept pace with the study of neurology in humans and small animals, although remarkable progress has been made in equine neurology over the last 30 years. To a large extent this shortfall is caused by the failure of large-animal clinicians to relate observed clinical signs to a neuroanatomical location of the lesion. In many cases this failure has been because of adverse environmental circumstances, or the large size or nature of the animal, all of which adversely impact the quality of the neurologic examination. It may be very difficult to do an adequate neurologic examination on an ataxic belligerent beef cow that is still able to walk and attack the examiner. An aggressive, paretic bull in broad sunlight can be a daunting subject if one wants to examine the pupillary light reflex; ophthalmoscopic examination of the fundus of the eye in a convulsing steer in a feedlot pen can be an exasperating task. Thus at one end of the spectrum is the clinical examination of pigs affected with nervous system disease, which is limited to an elementary clinical examination and necropsy examination. At the other end, neurologic examination of the horse with nervous system disease is very advanced. The global occurrence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) has highlighted the importance of accurate clinical diagnosis in adult cattle with neurologic abnormalities.",

Many diseases are characterized by diffuse neurologic lesions associated with bacteria, viruses, toxins, nutritional disorders, and embryologic defects, and the clinical findings of each disease are similar. Rather than attempting to localize lesions in the nervous system, large-animal practitioners more commonly devote much of their time to attempting to identify whether an animal has diffuse brain edema or increased intracranial pressure, as in polioencephalomalacia (PEM); whether it has clinical signs of asymmetric brainstem dysfunction and depression of the reticular activating system, as in listeriosis; or whether the dysfunction is at the neuromuscular level, as in hypomagnesemic tetany.",

Abnormalities of posture and gait are among the best indications of nervous system disease because these functions are governed largely by the coordination of nervous activity. Along with contributing to posture and gait, skeletal muscle tone is characteristic in its own right. However, its assessment in animals is subject to great inaccuracy because of our inability to request complete voluntary relaxation by the patient. In humans it is a very valuable index of nervous system efficiency, but in animals it has serious limitations. The most difficult step whenever there is a defect of gait or posture is to decide whether the defect originates in the skeleton, the muscles, or the nervous system.",

Because of its essentially coordinating function, the transmission of impulses along nerve fibers can be enhanced or depressed in varying degrees, with the extreme degree being complete failure of transmission. Because of the structure of the system, in which nerve impulses are passed from neuron to neuron by relays at the nerve cells, there may also be excessive or decreased intrinsic activity of individual cells giving rise to an increase or decrease in nerve impulses discharged by the cells. The end result is the same whether the disturbance is one of conduction or discharge, and these are the only two ways in which disease of the nervous system is manifested. Nervous dysfunction can thus be broadly divided into two forms, depressed activity and exaggerated activity. These can be further subdivided into four common modes of nervous dysfunction; excitation (irritation) signs, much more emphasis on the history and epidemiologic findings. Many of the diseases have epidemiologic characteristics that give the clinician a clue to the possible causes, thus helping to narrow the number of possibilities. For example, viral encephalomyelitis of horses occurs with a peak incidence during the insect season, lead poisoning is most common in calves after they have been turned out on to pasture, and PEM occurs in grain-fed feedlot cattle and sheep.",

The clinical findings that should arouse suspicion of neurologic disturbance include abnormalities in the three main functions of the system. collection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the different species and ages of large animal without causing damage to the animal or contaminating the sample with blood is a technique that few large-animal veterinarians have mastered. However, the collection of CSF from the lumbosacral cistern is not difficult if the animals are adequately restrained, and the information obtained from analysis of CSF can be very useful in the differential diagnosis of diseases of the brain and spinal cord.

If they are recumbent, the animals commonly develop secondary complications such as decubitus ulcers and other self-inflicted injuries because of repeated attempts to rise. Very few diseases of the nervous system of farm animals are treatable successfully over an extended period of time. This has become particularly important in recent years with the introduction of legislation prohibiting the slaughter of animals that have been treated with antibiotics until after a certain withdrawal period, which may vary from 5 to 30 days.

Thus a slowly developing tumor of the spinal cord will have a different pattern of clinical development from that resulting from an acute traumatic lesion of the vertebrae.

The weakness is caused by damage to the upper or lower motor neurons and the proprioceptive deficit by damage to the ascending sensory neurons. With a mild or even moderate cervical spinal cord lesion in an adult cow or horse, signs of ataxia and weakness may be evident in the pelvic limbs only, and it can be difficult to determine whether the thoracic limbs are involved. Close examination of the gait, posture, and postural reactions in the limbs, together with a search for localizing abnormalities, will often be productive in localizing the lesion. Signs of weakness or ataxia may be elicited by gently pushing the hindquarters to one side or pulling the tail to one side as the animal is walked (the sway response). The normal animal resists these movements or steps briskly to the side as it is pushed or pulled. The weak animal can be easily pulled to one side and may stumble or fall and may also tend to buckle or collapse when strong pressure is applied with the hand over the withers and loin regions.

It is caused by acute, severe compressive injury of the thoracolumbar spinal cord and manifested by extensor rigidity or hypertonia of the forelimbs and hypotonic paralysis of the hindlimbs. Neurons located in the lumbar spinal cord are responsible for the tonic inhibition of extensor muscle alpha motor neurons in the cervical intumescence. The cell bodies of these neurons are located in the ventral gray column from L1-L7, with a maximum population from L2-L4. Their axons ascend to the cervical intumescence. Acute severe lesions cranial to these neurons and caudal to the cervical intumescence will suddenly deprive the cervical intumescence neurons of this source of tonic inhibition, resulting in a release of these latter neurons. This results in extensor hypertonia observed in the thoracic limbs, which can function normally in the gait and postural reactions, except for the hypertonia.",

The descending motor pathway receives some input from the cerebellum and proceeds from the ipsilateral pons to the contralateral facial nerve nucleus in the medulla oblongata, and then to the facial nerve, and finally the orbicularis oculi muscle. A threatening gesture of the hand (or even better by the index finger in a pointing manner) toward the eye elicits immediate closure of the eyelids. The finger must come close enough to the eye without touching the tactile hairs of the eyelids or creating a wind that can be felt by the animal. Some stoic, depressed, or even excited animals may not respond to a menace reflex with closure of the eyelids; others may keep the eyelids partially or almost closed. It may be necessary to alert the patient to the risk of injury by touching the eyelids first. The menace response is a learned response that is absent in neonates. Most foals have a menace response by 9 days after birth and most calves by 5 to 7 days after birth. Group housing of neonatal calves appeared to facilitate faster learning of the menace response as a result of more visual threats. 4 The most definitive test is to make the animal walk an obstacle course and place objects in front of it so that it must step over the objects easily. A similar procedure is the only way to test for night blindness (nyctalopia). The area should be dimly lit, but the observer should be able to see the obstructions clearly.

The neck should be manipulated from side to side and up and down to detect any evidence of resistance or pain. Localized unilateral sweating of the neck and cranial shoulder is evidence of Horner's syndrome, in which It results in swaying from side to side of the pelvis, trunk, and sometimes the entire body.

This often results in abducted or abducted foot placement, crossing of the limbs, or stepping on the opposite foot, especially when the animal is circling or turning tightly. Circumduction of the outside limbs when turning and circling is also considered a proprioceptive deficiency. Walking an animal on a slope, with the head held elevated, often exaggerates ataxia, particularly in the pelvic limbs. When a weak and ataxic animal is turned sharply in circles, it leaves the affected limb in one place while pivoting around it. An ataxic gait may be most pronounced when an animal is moving freely, at a trot or canter, especially when attempting to stop. This is when the limbs may be wildly abducted or adducted.

This can be done while the animal is standing still and walking forward. Pulling the tail and lead rope laterally at the same time will assess the strength on each side of the body. Making the animal turn in a tight circle by pulling the lead rope and tail at the same time will indicate strength; an adult horse should be able to pull the examiner around and should not pivot on a limb or be pulled to the side. Pressing down with the fingers on the withers of a normal animal causes some arching, followed by resistance to the downward pressure. An animal with weakness in the thoracic limbs may not be able to resist this pressure by fixing its vertebral column but will arch its back more than normal and often buckle in the thoracic limbs.",

A case series involving 102 cattle highlighted the clinical utility of CSF analysis in the antemortem diagnoses of nervous diseases. 6 CSF is formed mostly from the choroid plexuses of the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles by the ultrafiltration of plasma and the active transport of selected substances across the blood-brain barrier; as such CSF should be regarded as a modified ultrafiltrate of plasma. A small amount of CSF is formed from the ependymal lining of the ventricular system, the pia arachnoid and meningeal blood vessels, and the central canal of the spinal cord. The rate of CSF turnover is approximately 1% per minute; accordingly, it takes many minutes for systemic electrolyte or acid-base changes (such as an increase in plasma magnesium concentration in hypomagnesemic beef cattle) to result in detectable and clinically relevant changes in CSF concentrations. CSF in the ventricular system flows caudally and diffuses out of the lateral recess in the fourth ventricle to circulate around the brain and spinal cord. The presence of CSF in the subarachnoid space separates the brain and spinal cord from the bony cranium and vertebral column, which reduces trauma to the underlying delicate nervous tissue. CSF flows within the subarachnoid space of leptomeninges, and it is primarily in this location that CSF equilibrates with the extracellular fluid (ECF) compartment of CNS parenchyma. 6 It also helps regulate intracranial pressure, maintains electrolyte and acid-base homeostasis, serves as an intracerebral transport system for neurotransmitters and hormones, and has excretory functions with the removal of products of cerebral metabolism. CSF analysis therefore provides a clinically valuable insight into diseases of the CNS.",

The needle must be introduced in a perfectly vertical position relative to the plane of the animal's vertebral column because of the danger of entering one of the lateral blood vessels in the vertebral canal. Changes in tissue resistance can be felt as the needle point passes sequentially through the subcutaneous tissue and interarcuate ligament; then there is a sudden \"'pop\" caused by the loss of resistance as the needle point penetrates the ligamentum flavum into the epidural space.

This formula corrects the CSF IgG concentration for an increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier; therefore, theoretically it provides a more sensitive method for detecting local production of IgG within the CNS. Calculating the albumin quotient and IgG index is expensive and rarely provides additional information to that provided by CSF protein concentration alone, and for this reason is not commonly performed in large animals. When antigen-specific titers are measured, two modified CSF indices, the Goldmann-Witmer coefficient (C-value) and the antibody index (AI), can be calculated to distinguish intrathecal versus passively acquired antibodies in the CSF. 14 16 Similar studies do not appear to have been conducted in large animals. The Pandy test also provides a useful on-farm assessment of CSF protein concentration. The basis for the test is that proteins (globulin and albumin) are precipitated by a saturated solution of phenol in water. The Pandy test uses a 10% solution of carbolic acid crystals dissolved in water (providing a saturated aqueous solution of phenol); the solution is termed Pandy's solution. One milliliter of Pandy's solution is placed in a glass tube and one drop (approximately 0.05 mL) of CSF is carefully layered on top. A turbid appearance at the interface signifies the presence of elevated concentrations of globulin or albumin in the CSF and is regarded as a positive Pandy's reaction (usually a total protein concentration greater than approximately 50 mg/dL). A variant of the test has the sample thoroughly mixed and the degree of turbidity ranked from 1+ (faint turbidity)",

The magnitude of the opening is also dependent on age, with neonates having a \"leakier\" blood-brain barrier than adults. 3, 4 This supports clinical observations that mannitol treatment appears to be more successful in treating neonates suspected to have cerebral edema than adults. The preferred treatment is mannitol given as a 20% solution in a series of bolus intravenous infusions of 0.25 to 1 g/kg BW every 4 to 6 hours. The suggested dose rate has been derived from those recommended for humans and dogs but is very expensive. There are dangers with mannitol: it should not be repeated often, it must not be given to an animal in shock, and it should be given intravenously slowly. A recent meta-analysis suggested that hypertonic saline (1.5-23 .5% NaCl at 10-30 mL/ kg BW total dose) may be as effective as 20% mannitol in the treatment of cerebral edema, with 7.5% NaCl as the most commonly used osmalality. 5 Dexamethasone administration (1 mg/ kg BW intravenously every 24 hours) is no longer recommended for the treatment of cerebral edema in human infants, 6 and its efficacy in large animals with cerebral edema is uncertain. Dexamethasone is thought to decrease cerebral edema and CSF production and inhibit tumor-induced angiogenesis in patients with intracranial tumors. Hypertonic glucose given intravenously is not recommended because an initial temporary decompression is followed after a 4-to 6-hour interval by a return to pretreatment CSF pressure when the glucose is metabolized.",

Failure to treat meningitis associated with pyogenic bacteria often permits the development of a fatal choroiditis, with exudation into CSF, and ependymitis. There is also inflammation around the nerve trunks as they pass across the subarachnoid space. The signs produced by meningitis are thus a combination of those resulting from irritation of both central and peripheral nervous systems. In spinal meningitis, there is muscular spasm with rigidity of the limbs and neck, arching of the back, and hyperesthesia with pain on light touching of the skin. When the cerebral meninges are affected, irritation signs, including muscle tremor and convulsions, are the common manifestations.

Primary bacterial meningitis is extremely rare in adult farm animals, with the exception of listeriosis and H. somni (formerly Haemophilus somnus) infection, although the latter is more a vasculitis than a primary meningitis. The possibility of immunodeficiency should be considered in adult horses with bacterial meningitis. Compared with adults, bacterial meningitis is more common in neonates because their immune system is immature, the blood-brain barrier is incomplete, and umbilical infections are common, providing a nidus of infection. Acquired hydrocephalus needs to be differentiated from other diffuse diseases of the brain, including encephalitis and encephalomalacia, and from hepatic dystrophies, which resemble it very closely.

It is not clear whether the EEG recording changed the initial treatment protocol for affected foals, and it should be noted that a diagnosis of epilepsy in humans is made primarily on clinical grounds. 1 TREATMENT Treatment is empirical. Seizures in foals can be initially controlled with intravenous diazepam (0.1-0.4 mg/kg; the large dose range suggests that some seizures are of short duration). Long-term seizure control emphasizes oral phenobarbital because of its cost and proven efficacy in humans and dogs. A loading intravenous phenobarbital dose that has been used in foals is 12 to 20 mg/kg diluted in 1 L of 0.9% NaCl and administered over 30 minutes, followed by oral phenobarbital at 6 to 12 mg/kg every 12 hours. The oral dose is adjusted based on clinical response and measured peak and trough serum phenobarbital concentrations. Therapeutic phenobarbital concentrations for horses are unknown, but the therapeutic range in humans is 15 to 40 \u00b5g/mL. Once seizure control is established with oral phenobarbital and the foal is seizure free for 6 months, the phenobarbital dose can be decreased by 20% every 2 weeks and the horse closely monitored. If phenobarbital does not provide adequate seizure control, potassium bromide can be tried at a tentative initial oral dose of 25 mg/kg every 24 hours. Clients should wear gloves during administration of potassium bromide. Although there is an increase in intracranial pressure, the removal of CSF is contraindicated because of the deleterious effects of the procedure on other parts of the brain.",

Ingestion of these plants in sufficient quantity is associated with a syndrome of mydriasis (pupil dilation and blindness), dry mouth, restlessness, tremor, tachycardia, hyperthermia, and frenzied actions. 5 Colic, in particular impaction colic, is reported in horses. 4 Convulsions, recumbency, and death may occur. Cholinesterase inhibitors such as physostigmine may be used to reverse the anticholinergic effects. 4 There are no significant necropsy lesions.",

Vacuolation reaches its greatest intensity in the CNS, and this is probably related to the predominance of nervous signs in the disease. Vacuolation of the chorionic epithelium may be related to the occurrence of abortion, and a transient infertility is suspected in rams to be the result of a similar lesion in the epithelium of the male reproductive tract. The lesion appears quickly and is reversible if the swainsonine intake ceases. In addition, swainsonine inhibits mannosidase II resulting in an alteration of glycoprotein synthesis, processing, and transport.

The most important factor is the amount of plant material ingested and the amount of time the animal is exposed to the toxin. Animals should not be allowed to graze when toxic plants are palatable and other forage is in short supply. In the western part of the United States, cattle should not be allowed to graze on locoweed-infected pastures until late May or early June, when other grasses have begun to grow. Pastures should not be overstocked because a lack of adequate forage will force animals to graze on locoweed. Animals grazing on locoweed pastures should be monitored closely and moved to a different pasture if they begin to show signs of poisoning. Herbicides may be used to control Astragalus spp. and Oxytropis spp., but the endophyte is contained in the seeds and they are drought resistant and able overwinter, allowing only for control and not elimination. Attempts to reduce consumption of the toxic plants by creating conditioned reflex aversion, to reduce absorption ETIOLOGY Nitrocompounds (nitrotoxins) poisonous to animals occur in a number of plants, especially in some species of Astragalus. They are all glycosides of 3-nitropropionic acid (NPA) or of 3-nitro-ropanol (NPOH). Miserotoxin is the most common and well known toxin; other toxins include cibarian, corollin, coronarian, coronillin, and karakin. 1 The best known occurrences of the nitrocompounds include the following: Astragalus and Oxytropis spp. are herbaceous legumes, most of them are perennial, and they dominate the desert range over large areas of the United States. They provide excellent forage. Only some species contain miserotoxin, but this makes them very destructive and very heavy losses of sheep and cattle may occur.",

The fungi grow on a wide variety of foodstuffs including spoiled food, garbage, stored grains, forages (grasses and legumes), malt (beverage) residues, and compost piles. 2, 3 Despite the different fungi and mycotoxins, the common neurologic signs of prolonged muscle tremors, ataxia, and stress-exacerbated weakness are similar in most species. 2 Hyperexcitability or depression, tetanic seizures, recumbency, paralysis, and rarely death may occur. 2, 4 Tremorgenic mycotoxins are rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and signs occur anywhere from a few hours to several days, depending on the species and particular mycotoxin. Age is important with younger animals more susceptible than older. 5 They are lipid soluble and easily move across the blood-brain barrier and into the CNS. Excretion is primarily biliary and fecal; little hepatic metabolism occurs. 6 The mechanism of action is unknown, but generally tremorgenic mycotoxins interfere with inhibitory neurotransmitters heavy infestations of sod webworms (grass caterpillars), African black beetles, leaf hoppers, and armyworm caterpillars (Pseudoletia separata, Pseudocalymma elegans, Spodoptera exempta). 2 Cattle, sheep, and to a lesser extent, goats, show signs of poisoning in late summer and autumn. 2 Clinical signs include depression, hypersalivation, abdominal pain, ruminal tympany and stasis, paralysis of the tongue and pharynx, sham drinking, muscle tremors, incoordination, recumbency, diarrhea, dehydration, and death. 2 In the forestomachs there is distension, mucosal reddening, and extensive microscopically visible necrosis in the rumen and abomasum.",

The biological half-life of lead excretion in cattle is between 6 and 14 weeks. 15 Studies in six affected dairy herds reported a variable half-life ranging from 48 to 2507 days. 2 One probable reason for this great variance is the ability of the ruminant to retain variable amounts of metallic lead in the rumen, which acts as a continuing reservoir. Half-life studies do not account for variable intake and retention of a persistent reservoir of toxicant, so the concept of using half-life excretion in dealing with lead-poisoned cattle is not likely accurate. Owners of such cattle should be advised of the potentially long withdrawal period. It may be advisable to test periodically and allow marketing based on actually measured levels or to estimate the costs of such a plan and consider salvage. This recent work casts doubt on the economic utility of holding recovered animals. In acutely sick cows that were emergency slaughtered, the range of lead levels in edible muscle tissue was 0.23 to 0.50 mg/kg. The concentrations in the kidneys ranged from 70 to 330 mg/kg and in the livers 10 to 55 mg/kg.",

For farm animals, significant pollution is more likely to occur near smelters or other industrial enterprises or near major highways where pasture is contaminated by exhaust fumes of automobiles if leaded gasoline is still used in the region. Much of the poisoning is subclinical because of the low level of absorption, but leadintoxicated animals have served as sentinels for human lead exposure. 11 Lead is still commonly found in pastures near highways. The lead levels in the whole blood of sheep grazing near main highways in three areas of the Nile delta region of Egypt were 0.062, 0.067, and 0.083 parts per million (ppm). Pasture adjacent to heavily used roads may carry as much as 390 mg/kg of lead, in contrast to 10 mg/kg on lightly used roads. 9, 10 The concentration of lead on pasture varies markedly with proximity to the traffic, falling rapidly the greater the distance and with the time of the year. Pastures contaminated by smelters are recorded as carrying 325 mg/kg of lead (equivalent to a daily intake for an animal of 6.4 mg/kg BW). 12 In some locations near lead smelters, lead poisoning is considered to be a predictable occurrence in horses that are allowed to graze on local pastures. 4 As a result horses are either not raised in these areas or hay is imported from other areas. Although ingestion is the principal method of poisoning of animals, inhalation may also be a significant method of entry for cattle grazing close to smelters or highways. early intensive therapy can be successful and reduce the figure to less than 50%. In one recorded outbreak, in which a discarded 24-V battery was accidentally mixed and ground up into the feed of 80 heifers, 55 of the animals died or were euthanized.",

Most cases of poisoning occur during the summer months from May to August, when the cattle have ready access to lead-containing materials such as crankcase oil and batteries that are being changed in agricultural machinery. In many countries the incidence of the disease is highest in cattle in the spring of the year a few days after the animals have been turned out onto pasture. 5 Poisoning is most common in younger cattle, with 52% of the cases reported in animals 6 months of age or less. 6 Younger animals are more susceptible to lead toxicosis presumably because of a higher rate of gastrointestinal tract absorption. In addition, young cattle are especially curious and seem to seek out and find sources of lead.

Many countries currently ban leaded gasoline, and in these areas used motor oil may not contain lead as well as motor oil from diesel engines or presentday machinery grease. 8 In ruminants, there is a tendency for metallic lead particles to settle in the reticulum, and poisoning results from the gradual conversion of lead particles to soluble lead acetate. Several epidemics of lead poisoning in domestic animals have been recorded throughout the world in which the source of the metal was 0.35 ppm have been associated with poisoning 4 and blood lead levels less than 0.2 ppm with background exposure. Correlation between blood lead levels and milk levels is good; correlation between blood lead levels and the presence or severity of clinical signs is often poor. 14, 17 Lead is transferred across the placental barrier, 17 and high liver levels occur in the lambs of ewes fed more than normal amounts of lead. Calves born from cows experimentally poisoned with lead have elevated levels of lead in bone, kidney, and liver.

            "text": "The absorption, distribution, and elimination of lead vary depending on the chemical form of lead, amount ingested, age and species of animal, and other physiologic factors. Deficiencies in calcium, iron, and zinc are associated with increased lead absorption and increased toxicity. Lead from salts such as lead sulfate are absorbed more than metallic lead from battery plates. 13 Regardless of the chemical form of the ingested lead, only a small proportion (2%-10%) is absorbed because of the formation in the alimentary tract of insoluble lead complexes, which are excreted in the feces. 1, 15 Once absorbed, 60% to 90% of lead is found in erythrocytes and the rest bound to albumin and other proteins. 3 Very little lead is found unbound in the serum. Lead is distributed to first to the soft tissues, especially kidneys and liver, and ultimately to bone, which serves as a storage or \"sink\" for excess lead. Excretion is slow and primarily through bile and the milk of lactating animals with little excreted in the urine. 1, 3, 14 Blood lead concentrations are an excellent marker of exposure in animals. In cows, blood-level concentrations greater than 0.35 ppm have been associated with poisoning 1 and blood lead levels less than 0.1 ppm with normal background exposure. In horses, blood lead levels greater than 0.2 to cattle with typical clinical lead poisoning before such animals can be sent to slaughter or before the milk can be used safely is not known. It is suggested that treated animals should be appropriately identified 6 and blood lead levels determined once or twice monthly for several months. When the blood lead levels have dropped to background levels for three consecutive samplings at least 2 weeks apart, the animals are assumed to be safe for slaughter. Undocumented field observations suggest that at least 6 months are necessary for background levels to be achieved. Decisions about reaching acceptable residue levels will depend on national or local regulations as well as the economics of maintaining a herd for long periods without sales of milk or meat, and appropriate food safety and public health officials should be consulted in this decision. The lead concentrations in blood and milk from periparturient heifers 7 months after an episode of acute lead poisoning revealed no lead in the milk. Animals that had been severely affected by lead poisoning experienced a transient increase in whole-blood lead concentration at parturition that was not high enough to be considered toxic.",

However, cattle on lush pasture may also seek out foreign material to chew. Discarded lead batteries are one of the most common sources of lead poisoning in cattle. 13 In Alberta, Canada, over a period of 22 years, discarded batteries or used crankcase oil accounted for more than 80% of cases for which the source of lead was determined: batteries, 39.5%; used crankcase oil, 31.6%. The batteries are commonly placed in garbage dumps on the farm and, in temperate climate countries, the batteries freeze during the winter months and break open, exposing the plates, which are attractive and palatable for cattle to lick and chew.",

Discarded lead-based paint cans are particularly dangerous but fences, boards, the walls of pens, painted canvas, and burlap are also common sources in calves. Painted silos may cause significant contamination of the ensilage. One outbreak of lead poisoning in cattle was associated with silage containing lesions of the vertebrae, usually affecting one or more of the lumbar bones, resulting in compression of the spinal cord. In the other form, gait abnormalities occur in the same lamb age group and are manifested initially by incomplete flexion of the limb joints so that the feet drag while walking. In a later stage the fetlocks are flexed, the extensor muscles paretic, and the lamb soon becomes recumbent. Recovery is common, although many lambs die of concurrent disease.",

All forms of mercury accumulate in the kidney, concentrating in the proximal renal tubular cells, producing cell membrane permeability, excess free radical formation,",

Inorganic mercury (mercury salts) is produced when mercury is combined with a salt such as sulfur or chlorine. Fungicides, disinfectants, antiseptics, and older anthelmintics may contain inorganic mercurial compounds. Organic mercury (organomercurials) is formed when mercury combines carbon to form, among others, methylmercury, ethylmercury, and phenylmercury.",

Toxicosis, when it occurs, is most often associated with oral ingestion of an organic mercury compound. In general, this is chronic and caused by accumulation of grain contaminated with mercury in the form of phenylmercury. 3 Acute or chronic poisoning can occur from either inorganic or organic mercury compounds but is generally accidental in nature. 4 Because of the availability of fungicidal agents other than mercury it is possible to limit the use of mercuric agents by legislation to those excreted rapidly by animals, the phenylmercury compounds, and prohibit those that are most highly retained in animal tissues, the ethyl and methyl compounds. 5 Worldwide use of mercurial fungicides has declined, and poisoning is much less common than in the past. The most common products, when used, are dusts of 5.25% methoxyethylmercury silicate or methylmercury dicyandiamide. These and ethylmercuric chloride are toxic when fed to pigs at the rate of 0.19 to 0.7 6 mg of mercury per kilogram BW per day for 60 to 90 days. Methylmercury dicyandiamide fed to pigs at the rate of 5 to 15 mg/kg is associated with illness, and 20 mg/kg is associated with some deaths with a delay of 3 weeks between dosing and illness.",

When associated with lipophilic drug overdoses, it may act as a vascular \"lipid sink, \" pulling drugs from the CNS back into the systemic circulation in which they can be metabolized and/or excreted. 10 There currently is no specified dose in large animals; the recommended small animal dose is a bolus of 1.5 mL/kg BW slowly over 1 to 3 minutes, followed by an infusion of 0.25 to 0.5 mL/kg BW over 30 to 60 minutes. 19 The dose (0.25 mL/kg BW) may be repeated in 4 to 6 hours if there is no evidence of lipemia in the serum. 10 are slowly absorbed, widely distributed throughout the body to fat and liver, poorly metabolized, and excreted primarily unchanged in the feces. 1, 5 Up to 90% of ivermectin and 77% of moxidectin are excreted via bile into the feces. 1, 6 At normal doses they do not cross the blood-brain barrier of healthy, adult large animals, which his due primarily to action of the P-glycoprotein transporter system. 5, 6 They are lipophilic, in particular moxidectin, and thus the lack of body fat may play a role in the elimination half-life and toxicity in debilitated animals. 5 In the absence of body fat, MLs concentrate in the serum and may reach levels high enough to overcome the blood-brain barrier. 5 They exert their toxic effects by binding to GABA and glutamate-gated chloride channels. Binding to glutamate-gated chloride channels results in hyperpolarization and paralysis of the parasite's pharyngeal pump musculature. 1, 5, 6 Glutamate-gated chloride channels are present only in nematodes and arthropods. In animal species, GABA-gated channels are only found in the CNS and poisoning does not occur unless the P-glycoprotein transporter is overwhelmed or compromised and MLs are allowed to enter.",

This results in erosion of the incisor teeth and intermittent bouts of spasmodic colic and flatulence.

Treatments include environmental enrichment (move horse to a stall where they can view more activity; change stall door/walls so that other horses can be seen) and feeding more hay and less concentrate so that feeding takes longer. More aggressive treatments include placement of a crib-strap (a strap placed around the neck of the horse that has two pieces of metal hinges at the ventral area; during arching of the neck the crib-strap tightens around the pharynx) or neurectomy or myectomy.

Success rates for these interventions varied between 6% and 27%, with the most success obtained by use of a nose net (27%). Nose nets provided better control of signs than did face or eye masks. These figures on the success of treatment illustrate the refractory, and therefore frustrating, nature of the disease.",

Within each area, a spillover of rabies into other species occurs, especially during epidemics. Temporal and spatial analysis of skunk and raccoon rabies in the eastern United States indicated that epidemics in raccoons and skunks moved in a similar direction from 1990 to 2000.

Current recommendations include sampling of the hippocampus, medulla oblongata, cerebellum, or gasserian ganglion. 4 However, a recent publication stipulates that the hippocampus and cerebellum are less desirable samples than the thalamus, pons, or medulla for the detection of viral antigen, and that the current sampling recommendations stem from the visibility of Negri bodies, rather than the true distribution of viral antigen. An FAT can be completed in approximately 2 hours and is accurate when done routinely by experienced personnel because it detects all genotypes if a potent conjugate is used. 5 The reliability of FAT confirmed by the mouse inoculation test is over 99%. Those specimens that are negative on FAT, and have contact with humans, are inoculated into experimental mice.

The most rational approach to reducing human rabies is to reduce the prevalence and incidence of America. Raboral V-RG is the only rabies vaccine licensed for use in the United States. It has not produced sufficient levels of population immunity in skunks in the wild at the current dose, and it may be less effective in skunks than in other species. Skunks are a major contributor to rabies in North America and this has raised concerns about an independent maintenance cycle for raccoon rabies in skunks. The national rabies management goals of virus containment and elimination will likely remain elusive until an oral vaccine is licensed that is immunogenic in all terrestrial rabies reservoir species. Vaccination will succeed in reducing or eradicating rabies only if a sufficient proportion of the target population can be immunized. Mathematical modeling techniques are now being tested to examine the population biology of rabies in wildlife species such as raccoons and skunks. It is notable that no practical vaccination methods have been developed for bats. Phylogenetic analyses of viruses from bats and carnivores suggest a historical basis for still existing viral origins caused by interactions between these taxa.

The occurrence of the disease in two dogs in the United Kingdom in 1969 to 1970 in which the incubation period appeared to last 7 to 9 months suggests that the more usual period of 6 months may give incomplete protection. Therefore vaccination on two occasions with an inactivated vaccine while the animal is still in quarantine for 6 months is the current recommendation. To require a longer period of quarantine would encourage evasion of the law by smuggling. The situation in the UK, and in any country where the disease does not occur, is a vexed one. It is possible to rely chiefly on quarantine and act swiftly to stamp the disease out if it occurs. The shock eradication program would include quarantine of, and vaccination in, a risk area, ring vaccination around it, and destruction of all wildlife. This procedure is likely to be adopted in countries where the risk is small, such as Australia. Where the risk is great, consideration must be given to mass vaccination of wildlife by baits, because wildlife are the cracks in the defense armor.

The disease has occurred in sheep and cattle following the use of a multidose syringe previously used in infected swine. It may spread from normal or clinically affected pigs to animals of other species, but does not usually spread between animals of the other species. For example, sheep and calves can be infected experimentally, but there is no evidence that they excrete the virus. The disease may occur in pigs, sheep, and cattle on the same farm. Brown rats may be a minor source of infection but are unlikely to be an important reservoir; they are capable of spreading the disease to dogs. The wild Norway rat is thought to have only a minor role in the transmission of the disease to farm animals. The virus causes fatal disease in dogs, which are usually infected from close association with infected pigs. The raccoon can be infected experimentally, but is not considered to be a longterm subclinical carrier of the virus. The possible role of wild animals in transmission of PRV in swine has been examined with inconclusive results. It has been seen in Kodiak, polar, and Himalayan bears fed on a diet of raw pig's heads. Five viral isolates were recovered from latently infected wild boar originating from two regions of East Germany, but in the Netherlands the wild boar were said to be rarely affected. The PRV infections in the wild boar in Germany are said to exist in the country as an endemic infection and persist completely separately from the domestic population and also do not appear to affect it. The sacral ganglia and trigeminal ganglia of wild pigs were said to be a source of infection. The latency was shown in 9/16 sacral ganglia, 7/16 trigeminal ganglia, and 5/13 tonsils from feral swine in severe dyspnea are common. Trembling, incoordination, and paralysis and convulsions follow, and precede death. With others, the disease may be manifested at this age by mild signs of posterior incoordination and leg weakness. In adults, fever may not be present, and the infection may cause only a mild syndrome of anorexia, dullness, agalactia, and constipation. However, virulent strains may produce acute disease in adults, characterized by fever, sneezing, nasal pruritus, vomiting, incoordination and convulsions, and death. Infection in early pregnancy may result in embryonic death, or abortion, and early return to estrus. An abundant vaginal discharge may occur. Infection in late pregnancy may result in abortion, or in the subsequent birth of mummified fetuses, which may involve all or only part of the litter. Abortion may result from the effects of fever or from viral infection of the fetus.

A stage of paralysis follows in which salivation, respiratory distress, and ataxia occur. The temperature is usually increased, sometimes to as high as 41\u00b0C to 41\u00b0C (106\u00b0F-107\u00b0F). Final paralysis is followed by death in 6 to 48 hours after the first appearance of illness. A case of nonfatal PRV in a cow is recorded. There is also a report of PRV occurring in feedlot cattle in which there were nervous signs, bloat, and acute death, but no pruritus. In young calves, it is characterized clinically by encephalitis, no pruritus, erosion in the oral cavity and esophagus, and a high case-fatality rate. An outbreak in sheep was associated with skin abrasions acquired at shearing. Affected ewes were dull, inappetent, and had a fever of 41.1\u00b0C. About 23 of 29 affected sheep developed the \"mad itch, \" with nibbling of their fleece and frenzied attempts to bite one area of the skin and rub it against the wall and bars of their pen. Terminally, recumbency, tremors, and opisthotonus were common, and death occurred within 12 to 24 hours after onset. Five farm cats also became ill and died; the virus was isolated from the brain of one cat. In goats, rapid deaths, unrest, lying down and rising frequently, crying plaintively, experimental infection. The trigeminal ganglia and olfactory bulb are good sources of virus. The virus may be present in the trigeminal ganglion of a naturally infected sow without any history of clinical disease. Experimental inoculation of the virus into young pigs can result in a mild pneumonia, which may progress to a severe suppurative bronchopneumonia.",

Strain differences in the effect of historical PRV strains in porcine respiratory nasal mucosa explants shows that there were differences in the strains. 8 The virus is pantropic and affects tissues derived from all embryonic layers. Receptor and receptor-binding virion proteins that can mediate the virus entry into the cell and cell-to-cell spread have been described. The various glycoproteins of the virus are required for various stages of virion morphogenesis. For example, deletion of glycoproteins gE, gI, and gM inhibits the virion maturation. Pseudorabies glycoprotein gK is a virion structural component involved in virus release from the cell but not viral entry, and its presence is important to prevent immediate reinfection. Viremia occurs with localization of the virus in many viscera, but with multiplication occurring primarily in the upper respiratory tract. Viral and cell interactions have been described in detail. 9 Spread to the brain occurs by way of the olfactory, glossopharyngeal, or trigeminal nerves, i.e., via the autonomic nerves. It can pass across synapses and infect higher level neurons. 10 Cells with the common leukocyte antigen CD45+ populate the CNS-infected areas from the local capillaries, and the number of cells is increased in proportion to the number of infected neurons. Virus disappears from the brain by the eighth day, coinciding with the appearance of neutralizing antibody in the blood. When the virus gains entry through a skin abrasion, it quickly invades the local peripheral nerves, passing along them centripetally and causing damage to nerve cells. It is this form of progression that causes local pruritus in the early stages of the disease, and encephalomyelitis at a later stage when the virus has invaded the CNS. In pigs, pruritus does not develop after intramuscular injection, but a local paralysis indicative of damage to low motor neurons occurs before invasion of the CNS in some pigs. In cattle, pruritus of the head and neck is usually associated with respiratory tract infection, whereas perianal pruritus is usually caused by vaginal infection.",

Differentiation is possible when vaccine virus strains have either a natural, or a genetically engineered, deletion that encodes for either gI, gIII, or gX genes. Commercial ELISA kits that specifically detect antibody responses to gI of the virus offer considerable advantages as diagnostic tests for the virus, with a sensitivity of 99.2% and specificity of 100%. The gI ELISA is able to distinguish infected pigs from those vaccinated with gI-negative vaccines. The field strains of the virus produce antibodies to gI when inoculated into pigs. Unvaccinated pigs, or pigs vaccinated with gI-negative vaccines, that become subclinically infected with field strains of the virus may be detected with the gI-ELISA for a long time after infection. Thus pigs that are seropositive in the gI-ELISA have either been infected with PRV or have been vaccinated with gI-positive vaccines; gIseronegative pigs can be considered to be uninfected.

The immunoperoxidase test can be used to study the distribution of the virus in different tissues. Latent virus can be detected using a DNA hybridization dot blot assay. Whenever possible, whole carcasses and fetuses should be submitted for laboratory examination. The location of the optimal neural samples, including the paravertebral ganglia, has been described for sheep. The placental lesions in pregnant sows that have aborted from natural infection with pseudorabies consist of necrotizing placentitis and the presence of intranuclear inclusions. In an experimental infection of loops of intestine it was shown that there was necrosis of the follicles in the Peyer's patches and degeneration of the epithelial cells in the crypts and villi and degeneration of the cells in the myenteric plexuses. Intranuclear inclusion bodies were found 2 to 4 days after inoculation. The primary target of the wild PRV was the macrophages of the subepithelial area of the dome of the Peyer's patch.",

New legislation imposed restrictions on the movement of pigs where clinical signs of the disease were present in the herd. The first part of the eradication scheme involved testing all of those herds previously known to have PRV. Within several months after the beginning of the eradication campaign, 417 herds had been slaughtered, involving 342,275 pigs, of which 72.5% were salvaged. Only 121 herds had been known to be previously infected, while the remaining 296 herds had been identified through trace backs and reports of new cases. By 1985 it was concluded that the disease was well controlled in England with only 10 to 14 infected herds remaining. Farmers were compensated for all animals slaughtered and also for consequential loss associated with the loss of stock. The cost of the eradication program was financed by a levy on all pigs normally marketed for slaughter in England. In 1995 England was free of Aujeszky's disease. Following the successful use of the gene-deletion vaccination and an eradication program the Netherlands and Germany are free of the disease. In Sweden the herds were declared free from 12 to 53 months after the start of the program. Now, in Northern Ireland, PRV is more widespread than it ever was in Britain before the eradication program. Because the infection rate is over 50%, an eradication program based on slaughter of infected herds would destroy the swine industry.

Intensive regional vaccination of finishing pigs with a gI-deleted vaccine, along with companion diagnostic tests, reduced the seroprevalence in infected finishing herds from 81% to 19% in 2 years. Vaccination increases the virus dose needed for establishment of infection and decreases the level and duration of virus excretion after infection. In the control group, with routine disease control, no significant change in seroprevalence occurred. The consistent application of intensive vaccination of all breeding herds in a region, including those herds participating in a production chain, can also decrease the prevalence of infection in heavily infected areas. The intensive regional vaccination did not completely eliminate virus infections within these herds; the source of infection was not determined. It is suggested that the virus either circulated at a low level within herds, or its introduction or reactivation did not lead to an extensive spread of the virus. A voluntary vaccination program on individual farms was unsuccessful in reducing the prevalence of virus-infected breeding pigs. The importation of breeding stock from outside the area is associated with a higher prevalence of virus-infected pigs because of lack of vaccination.

It has subsequently been reported from most of the major sheep-producing countries and probably occurs in all of them. The disease occurs primarily in sheep, and less often in goats and free-living ruminants, such as chamois. 3 The prevalence of infection is much higher than the incidence of clinical disease because the latter only occurs when there is infection during pregnancy. BDV-1 has been detected in sheep from Australia, New Zealand, UK, and United States; BDV-2 from ruminants in Germany; BDV-3 in Switzerland and Austria; BDV-4 in Spain; BDV-5 and BDV-6 in France; and BDV-7 in Turkey. 1 Studies on seroprevalence suggest that pestivirus infections in sheep and goats are less common than in cattle, but there are considerable differences in seroprevalence between different geographic areas and flocks. Flock seroprevalence in different regions or countries generally falls within the range of 5% to 50%. The prevalence of seropositive females within positive flocks is influenced by age, with a lower seroprevalence in sheep 4 to 8 months of age than in older sheep. Seroprevalence is higher in flocks with persistently infected sheep, but there can still be a significant proportion of seronegative sheep present in a flock containing persistently infected sheep.",

Because of the nature of the virus, recombination during replication, hence antigenic drift, is common and may facilitate persistence of the virus in the host and the development of disease. Based on analysis of gag and pol genomic regions, SRLVs have been placed into five clusters (A to E), with A and B further divided into at least 13 and 3 subtypes, respectively. Some of these are geographically restricted, such as cluster C in Norway, whereas others appear more dispersed, probably reflecting the active trading of animals. In Canada, molecular analysis of goat and sheep isolates of SRLV from herds or flocks with only sheep or goats reveals a relatively simple arrangement, with goats infected with B1 subtype and sheep with A2 subtype, respectively. However, on farms with both goats and sheep, there is evidence of crossover between sheep and goats, and vice versa, and mixed infections in both species. 2 Consequently, mixed flocks of goats and sheep may represent an active source for the evolution of these viruses, with a CAElike virus responsible for severe outbreaks of arthritis in sheep in Spain and mixed infections confirmed in many European countries and North America.

The larval and nymphal stages will feed on any vertebrate, but the adult female will engorge and mate only on larger mammals. The tick becomes infected by feeding on a viremic host and the virus translocates to the salivary gland of the subsequent stage to provide a source of infection at feeding in the following year. Transstadial transmission of the virus occurs, but transovarial transmission does not; thus only the nymph and adult ticks are capable of transmitting the disease. The tick is seasonally active at temperatures between 7\u00b0C and 18\u00b0C. Most ticks feed in the spring, with peak activity dependent on the latitude and elevation of the pasture, but generally occurring in April and May. In some areas there is a second period of activity of a separate population of I. ricinus in the autumn during August and September. Although infected ticks can transmit the infection to a large number of vertebrate hosts, only sheep, red grouse (Lagopus scoticus), and possibly horses, attain a viremia sufficient to infect other ticks and act as maintenance hosts. Grouse amplify the virus, deer amplify the vector, and hares (Lepus timidus) amplify both. Infection in red grouse is accompanied by a high mortality, and the louping-ill virus is essentially maintained in an area by a sheep-tick cycle and hare tick cycle.",

The latter circulate in Europe and Asia and are a serious zoonotic disease for humans, but do not infect sheep. 1 Louping-ill virus occurs in Great Britain, Ireland and Norway, but similar disease occurs elsewhere and there is antigenic diversity between isolates from different geographic areas. Viruses that are closely related to louping-ill virus, and that cause very similar disease but in different regions of the world, include Russian springsummer encephalitis, Turkish sheep encephalitis, Spanish sheep encephalitis, Spanish goat encephalitis, 2 and Greek goat encephalitis viruses.

Animals that survive exposure to louping-ill virus have an earlier immune response to the infection and have high concentrations of antibody in the CSF.

Experimental inoculation of little ravens (Corvus mellori) with WNVKUN resulted in infection and viremia but not clinical disease. 13",

The inflammatory changes and viral distribution are concentrated in the rhombencephalon and spinal cord, with comparatively little damage to the cerebrum. One IHC study of naturally infected horses concluded that examination of the spinal cord is required to accurately identify West Nile virus infection. Another report, in which RT-PCR was used, concluded that high-quality samples of medulla were sufficient to detect the presence of the virus. Postmortem confirmation of the diagnosis through virus isolation is possible, but the sensitivity is generally inferior to molecular biology-based techniques. RT-PCR is generally superior to IHC. The processing of tissue from multiple CNS sites is recommended to increase the chances of finding a virus-rich focus. High concentrations of West Nile virus are not found in non-CNS tissues of infected equids, in contrast to the distribution of the virus in many other species. altered mentation is detected in approximately 66% of horses.

There is an effective vaccine. 3 The genome has one long open reading frame (ORF) that encodes a single poly-horses providing a means of identifying recently naturally infected horses from those with vaccine-induced serologic results. 32 Both inactivated virus vaccine and a live canarypox-vectored recombinant vaccine are available in North America. 6 The inactivated virus vaccine should be administered in two doses at an interval of 3 to 6 weeks in early summer in the first instance, and then again once to twice yearly before the season of peak disease incidence. Foals from unvaccinated mares should be administered the vaccine beginning at 2 to 3 months of age, and foals of vaccinated mares should be administered the vaccine beginning at 7 to 8 months of age. Vaccination of foals that acquired passive immunity from the dam can be effective at inducing active immunity when the first dose of vaccine is administered at 3 months of age. 35 Administration of the recommended two doses of inactivated virus vaccine fails to induce an adequate plaque reduction titer in approximately 14% of horses 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination and in 30% of horses 5 to 7 months after vaccination. This effect was especially evident in horses >10 years of age. These results indicate that some horses will not develop protective immunity against West Nile virus despite administration of vaccine in the recommended dose and interval.",

It is important to recognize that factors affecting vector density, as happened in Australia in 2011, introduction of new vectors, or emergence of virus strains with higher virulence can affect incidence of the disease and require revision of existing control measures. 12, 25, 31 Elimination of the virus is not practical given that it cycles through avian and insect vectors and that the horse is incidentally infected. Vaccination is effective in preventing development of disease, and reduces the likelihood of death in horses with West Nile encephalitis by approximately two to three times. [32] [33] [34] Vaccination is an important aspect of controlling the disease. There is no evidence that administration of the inactivated virus vaccine increases the risk of fetal loss in mares. Vaccination prevents viremia in most horses following exposure to West Nile virus-infected mosquitoes. Vaccination induces an IgG, but not an IgM, response in vector, whereas C. gelidus, C. fuscocephala, and C. annulirostris are considered as secondary/regional vectors. The virus has been detected in Anopheles peditaeniatus Leicester, A. barbirostris (van der Walp), and A. subpictus in India. cats, and humans become infected but likely play only a minor role in the spread of the virus because of the low level of viremia in these species. There are a number of species of mosquito important in the biology of the virus: 11,12 C. tritaeniorhynchus is the primary protein is cleaved cotranslationally and posttranslationally into three structural proteins and seven nonstructural proteins. The three structural proteins are the capsid (C), precursor to membrane (prM), and envelope (E) proteins. 3 Based on the nucleotide sequence of genomic RNA, JEV is classified into five major genotypes. 4 Fig. 14-5 ). 2,4,5,9 JEV RNA has been detected in dead birds and a C. pipiens mosquitos in Italy. 10 The virus cycles between avian and mammalian amplifying hosts and the mosquitoes (Fig. 14-6 ). 2 The natural maintenance reservoir for JEV are birds of the family Ardeidae (herons and egrets), which do not demonstrate clinical disease but do have high levels of viremias. The pig is the principal mammalian amplifying host among domestic animals. Horses, cattle, sheep, goats, dogs, ",

Recovery usually occurs within about a week. More severe cases show pronounced lethargy, mild fever, and somnolence. Jaundice and petechiation of the nasal mucosa are usual. There is dysphagia, incoordination, staggering, and falling.

Aedes detritus), a temperate zone (British) mosquito can be infected by JEV in laboratory settings and might be a competent vector in the field, although this remains to be established. 11 The virus is destroyed by heating for 30 minutes above 56\u00b0C and the thermal inactivation point (TIP) is 40\u00b0C.

Epidemics of WEE are associated with factors that increase the number of infected mosquitoes or their feeding on susceptible (unvaccinated) horses.

In areas where WEE occurs, clinical cases of the disease in unvaccinated horses usually precede the occurrence of the disease in humans. The establishment of a reporting system in which practicing veterinarians report all clinical cases of the disease in horses will also assist in predicting potential epidemics of WEE virus infection in the human population. Serologic surveys of wildlife may also serve as good indicators of the geographic distribution and seasonality of circulation of these viruses and provide an early warning system before the detection of human cases. 1 The pathogenic variant, IAB, has been detected in cryptic circulation up to 8 years after an epizootic. 2 The infection cycles between rodents and mosquitos as an enzootic cycle not associated with disease in equids or humans ( Fig.  14-8) . Birds might be involved in this enzootic cycling. Disease occurs when pathogenic variants of the virus become established and cycle between humans or horses, both of which have high levels of viremia, and mosquitos. 1, 3 Outbreaks of disease in horses and humans occur infrequently, but can affect large numbers of equids and humans when they do occur. Outbreaks were documented in Mexico in 1993 and 1996, and in Venezuela and Columbia in the autumn of 1995. The Columbian outbreak affected 90,000 people and killed an estimated 4000 horses. The strain involved in the Columbian outbreak was IC, whereas that involved in the Mexican outbreaks was a variant of the usually nonpathogenic IE. The outbreak in Mexico was associated with a variant of VEE that did not cause viremia in horses, although it was capable of causing neurologic disease in this species, and it might have been this attribute that abbreviated the course of the epidemic. There is evidence of continuing enzootic circulation of VEE IE in southern Mexico. 4, 5 The virus is extremely fragile and disappears from infected tissues within a few hours of death.",

A recent outbreak of VEE in Columbia caused 75,000 human cases, 300 fatalities, and killed approximately 4000 horses. Human infections generally follow equine infections by approximately 2 weeks. The infection in humans is usually a mild, influenza-like illness in which recovery occurs spontaneously. When clinical encephalitis does occur, it is usually in very young or older people. Occurrence of the disease in humans can be limited by the use of a vaccine in horses, thus limiting the occurrence of the disease in horses in the area. There is a strong relationship between the mosquito population and the incidence of the disease in horses and in humans. The occurrence of the disease in humans may be predicted by an unusually high activity of virus in mosquitoes. There are usually, but not always, widespread mortalities in horses before the disease occurs in humans. VEE infections, and disease, of epizootic or enzootic virus have occurred among laboratory workers as a result of aerosol infections from laboratory accidents, from handling of infected laboratory animals, or inhalation of cage debris of infected laboratory animals. 3 Human VEE virus infections have originated by aerosol transmission from the cage debris of infected laboratory rodents and from laboratory accidents. Those who handle infectious VEE viruses or their antigens prepared from infected tissues or cell cultures should be vaccinated and shown to have demonstrable immunity in the form of a VEE virus-specific neutralizing antibody.",

Nonpathogenic VEE viruses persist in sylvatic cycles in northern South America, Central America, and parts of the southern United States, and are important because they are the source of the epizootic strains of the virus that emerge at infrequent intervals. The enzootic strains also confound the diagnosis of VEE because of the extensive serologic cross-reactivity among endemic and epidemic VEE viruses. However, recent advances in diagnostic techniques may have solved this diagnostic problem. The nonpathogenic viruses are maintained in rodents associated with swamps, and transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus Culex, and perhaps other hematophagous insects. Humans, horses, cattle, pigs, dogs, and ratites are accidental hosts of the virus. Epidemics of VEE occur irregularly, the latest being in northern Columbia in 1995, and Mexico in 1993 and 1996. The source of virus during outbreaks is infected horses. Horses develop a profound viremia and are amplifying hosts that aid in the spread of the epizootic; other domestic species, including cattle, pigs, and goats, are not considered to be amplifiers of the virus. During epizootics, all species of mosquitoes that feed on horses, including Aedes, Psorophora, and Deinocerites species, are thought to be capable of spreading the infection, although O. taeniorhynchus is thought to be the principal vector responsible for transmission of VEE virus during outbreaks, whereas Culex (Melanoconion) species mosquitoes transmit enzootic strains of VEE virus. 6 Epizootics end as the population of susceptible horses decreases below a critical level, either by death or vaccination. The reservoir of the virus between outbreaks, which may be up to 19 years, was unknown until it was demonstrated that epidemic VEE type IAB virus arises by mutation of endemic strains (types ID-F and II-VI), or that type IE (enzootic) mutates into an epizootic form serologically very similar to IE. This mutation of the endemic virus into the epidemic form has occurred on at least three occasions associated with epidemics of VEE. It is likely that pathogenic strains of VEE will continue to emerge in areas where the nonpathogenic strains of the virus are endemic.",

The vaccine causes a mild fever, leukopenia, and a viremia and, because of conflicting reports about its capacity to cause abortion, should not be used in pregnant mares.

            "text": "Although EHV-1 virus is genetically stable, with limited genetic divergence and differences in strains of less than 0.1%, genetic variants of EHV-1 exist and some have differing biologic characteristics. 20 Analysis of ORF 68 reveals at least 19 distinct DNA sequences allowing identification of 6 major strain groups of EHV-1. 20 Importantly, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (A-G) at position 2254 in the DNA polymerase gene (DNA pol , ORF 30) that results in substitution of asparagine (N) by aspartic acid (D) at position 752 in the DNA polymerase protein is not limited to any one strain. Variants of the virus are therefore classified as N752 or D752 , irrespective of the particular strain. 20 This suggests that the D752/N752 mutation has occurred multiple times. 21 The original isolation of EHV-1 in 1941 was of the D752 phenotype. 21 The D752 variant is isolated more frequently than is N752 from horses with myeloencephalopathy and, increasingly, abortion. [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] Infection with the D752 variant increases the risk of myeloencephalopathy by 160\u00d7 compared with that of infection with N752. 28 These data are based on retrospectively collected data that were not randomly collected, and this relative risk estimate could change markedly, although the association between increased risk of EHM and infection by D752 is well accepted. 18, 19, 21, 23, 24, 29 However, horses can develop EHM when infected by the N752 variant in approximately 25% of cases (noting the uncertainty around this estimate). 28 The N752 variant is the one most commonly reported as infecting asymptomatic horses. 28, 30 Although estimates are potentially biased by the sampling method used in various epidemiologic studies, the D752 variant was identified in 3%, 10.8%-19.4%, 7.4%, 24%, and 10.6% of horses positive for EHV-1 sampled in Japan, the United States, Argentina, France, and Germany, respectively. 31 Horses can be infected by both variants of the disease simultaneously, and each variant can cause disease (D752 variant causing neurologic disease in the dam and N752 causing abortion). 32 Both D752 and N752 variants were both isolated from trigeminal ganglia of 12 of 153 horses Some asinine herpesviruses cause a fatal interstitial pneumonia or neurologic disease in donkeys. 8 Infection by EHV-1, EHV-4, or both is common, if not ubiquitous, in equids worldwide with most animals infected while juveniles and latent virus in trigeminal ganglia 9 and other tissues maintaining that infection. EHV-4 causes respiratory disease and, rarely, abortion. EHV-1 causes respiratory disease but also causes individual cases or outbreaks of myeloencephalopathy, abortion, and neonatal septicemia. Certain variants of EHV-1, detectable by examination of viral genome, are associated with increased risk of myeloencephalopathy, abortion, or both.",

            "text": "A partial list of disease syndromes attributed to EHV and asinine herpesvirus infection and the viruses associated with them include the following: \u2022 Upper respiratory tract disease of adult horses, weanlings, and older foals is caused principally by EHV-4, although disease attributable to EHV-1 occurs. EHV-2 causes respiratory disease, including pneumonia, of foals, and rarely upper respiratory disease of adults. \u2022 Abortion in horses is almost always associated with EHV-1, although rare sporadic cases are associated with EHV-4. EHV-7 (syn. asinine herpesvirus-2, a gammaherpesvirus) was associated with abortion in a donkey. 4 \u2022 Perinatal disease of foals, including birth of sick and weak foals and development of viral septicemia within 48 hours of birth, is associated with EHV-1. \u2022 EHV-1 myeloencephalopathy (EHM) is associated with EHV-1 and rarely, if ever, with EHV-4. In donkeys it has been associated with an asinine gammaherpesvirus. 8 \u2022 Coital exanthema is associated with EHV-3, and genital disease is an unusual manifestation of EHV-1 infection. \u2022 Equine multinodular pulmonary fibrosis in horses is associated with infection by EHV-5. 10,11 \u2022 Lymphoma in horses is tentatively associated with infection by EHV-5. 12,13 \u2022 Chorioretinitis is associated with EHV-1 infection. 14 \u2022 Dermatitis (erythema multiforme) is associated with EHV-5 infection in horses. 15 \u2022 Neurologic disease or abortion in gazelle, onagers, and polar bears is caused by EHV-9 or EHV-1 originating from zebra. 2, 3, 16, 17 The following discussion focuses on myeloencephalopathy, abortion, and neonatal septicemia in equids associated with infection by EHV-1. Respiratory disease caused by EHV-4 and EHV-1 is discussed Herpesviruses infecting equids (such as horses, donkeys, mules, and zebra) are all viruses with a linear, double-stranded DNA genome in the order Herpesvirales, family Herpesviridae. 1 Equid herpesviruses (EHV)-1, 3, 4, 8 (syn. asinine herpesvirus-3), and 9 (a virus infecting gazelle) are Alphaherpesvirinae (alphaherpesviruses) in the genus Varicellovirus. EHV-6 (syn. asinine herpesvirus-1) is tentatively assigned to this genus. EHV-2, 5, and 7 (syn. asinine herpesvirus-2) are Gammaherpesvirinae (gammaherpesviruses). 1 There is also a zebra gammaherpesvirus, which appears to be associated with disease in nonequids housed in proximity to zebras (see later). 2, 3 Five herpesviruses have been associated with various diseases of horses and foals (EHV-1 to 5). Common names are \"equine abortion virus\" for EHV-1, \"cytomegalovirus\" for EHV-2, \"equine coital exanthema virus\" for EHV-3, and \"rhinopneumonitis virus\" for EHV-4 (although this term is sometimes used, confusingly, for EHV-1). Related herpesviruses (asinine herpesvirus-1 to 6, some of which have been recently classified or identified as EHVs 1 ) infect, and some cause disease in, donkeys, mules, or horses. 4 all horses that seroconverted to EHV-1 also either seroconverted to influenza virus or had been recently vaccinated with a vaccine containing EHV-1. These results suggest that the stress of influenza disease may have triggered reactivation of latent EHV-1 infection in some horses, suggesting that EHV-1 did not have a primary role in the outbreak of respiratory disease. Similarly, in England, EHV-1 was not associated with clinical respiratory disease in Thoroughbred racehorses. EHV-1 was isolated from foals with purulent nasal discharge and respiratory disease concurrent with neurologic disease among the dams in Australia. Abortion caused by EHV-1 occurs as both sporadic cases and as epizootics (abortion storms). 27, 40, 44 Approximately 3% of abortions in mares are attributable to EHV-1 infection, although the actual incidence probably varies widely among years and geographic regions. Outbreaks of EHV-1 abortion and birth of nonviable foals occurs sporadically on farms with sometimes catastrophic losses. Loss of foals through abortion or birth of nonviable foals can be as high as ~60% of pregnant mares on the farm. 27, 40, 44 Initial cases can, in the absence of appropriate control measures, rapidly spread the infection and prompt diagnosis, and implementation of control measures is important to limit the spread of infection. 27, 29 Vaccination with killed EHV-1 vaccine during late gestation does not reliably prevent the disease, although conventional wisdom is to ensure that mares are well vaccinated (see the section Control). 27 EHV-4 rarely causes abortion in mares. Disease of neonates associated with EHV-1 occurs both sporadically and as outbreaks in which up to 25% of foals may be affected. Foals infected in utero usually die soon after birth, whereas those infected in the period after birth may have milder disease and a lower mortality rate (6%). One-third of viremic foals may not seroconvert, based on the complement fixation test.",

Serologic surveys, which provide an index of the extent of infection in the sampled population, performed before 1995 were hindered by the lack of an assay able to differentiate immune responses to EHV-1 from those to EHV-4. Furthermore, the advent of vaccines eliciting serum antibodies against EHV-1/4, and the inability of diagnostic tests to differentiate between antibodies induced by vaccination or natural infection, complicates assessment of the prevalence of serum antibodies to EHV-1/4. Seroprevalence of EHV-1-specific antibodies is 9% to 28% in adult Thoroughbred horses, 26% of Thoroughbred broodmares, 11% of Thoroughbred foals, and 46% to 68% of 1-and 2-year-old Thoroughbred race horses in Australia. Sixty-one percent of 82 normal horses and horses with upper respiratory tract disease had antibodies to EHV-1 in New Zealand. Of 70 Thoroughbred race horses examined postmortem, 18 (26%) and 58 (83%) horses were PCR positive for the gB gene of EHV-1 and EHV-4, respectively, in at least one of trigeminal ganglia, bronchial, or submandibular lymph nodes sampled. Twelve horses were dually infected with EHV-1 and EHV-4. 33 The EHV-1 D752 variant has been detected in equids in North America, Europe (the Netherlands, France, Belgium, and Germany), Australia, New Zealand, and South America. 18, 27, [30] [31] [32] [40] [41] [42] [43] It likely occurs worldwide given that it is not a recent mutation, having been detected in samples collected in the 1940s. 21 EHM is rarely reported in the Southern Hemisphere with the first case described in New Zealand in 2013. 18 Upper respiratory tract disease associated with EHV-1 infection has been suggested to occur as outbreaks, although this is not well documented. Signs of infectious upper respiratory disease affected 20% of Thoroughbred race horses at one race track in Canada over a 3-year period, and seroconversion to EHV-1 occurred in 5% to 18% of these horses, whereas the vast majority of horses seroconverted to influenza. However, examined postmortem for reasons other than EHV-associated disease, indicating that symptomatic dual infection is common. One or the other variant, but not both, were isolated from a further 9/153 horses. 9 Similarly, of 70 Thoroughbred racehorses examined postmortem because of death secondary to catastrophic musculoskeletal injuries, 2 carried only a latent neurotropic strain of EHV-1, 6 carried a nonneurotropic genotype of EHV-1, and 10 were dually infected with neurotropic and nonneurotropic EHV-1. 33 Among 132 mares from central Kentucky sampled postmortem, latent EHV-1 DNA was detected in the submandibular lymph node tissues of 71 (54%). Thirteen (18%) of the 71 latently infected horses were infected with the D752 variant, of which 11 were also infected with the N752 variant. 30 The remainder were infected with only the N752 variant.",

Horses experimentally infected with D752 variant developed EHM, whereas those infected with the N752 variant did not, although uniform development of EHM in horses or ponies experimentally infected with D752 variant is not present in other studies of the disease. 34 The D752 variant infects submucosal immune cells in respiratory explants to a greater extent than does the N752 variant. 35 CSF from horses infected by D752 was abnormal, whereas that from horses infected with N752 was not abnormal. 34 It is unclear whether viral load is associated with the outcome of clinical disease, although one study of a small number of horses (seven) treated at a referral institution, identified viral loads in nasal fluid and blood that were 1000\u00d7 and 100\u00d7 greater in nonsurviving horses with EHM. These findings require confirmation because of the small number of horses examined and in surviving (five) and nonsurviving groups (two). 36 Both N752 and D752 variants can cause disease. Virulence is associated with presence of a functional gp2 protein, which is apparently responsible for viral egress from infected cells, and glycoprotein D and cellsurface glycosaminoglycans that are needed for efficient entry of EHV-1 into cells.",

There is a cyclical pattern in which horses are infected at a young age and the source of infection is, depending on the age of the foal, either its dam or other foals. Foals are infected by EHV-1 and shedding virus in nasal secretions as young as 11 days of age, often without development of clinical signs but usually associated with mucopurulent nasal discharge. Peak incidences of cases of respiratory disease associated with EHV-1 are late during the foaling season before weaning, and again after weaning when foals from several groups are housed together. The source of infection in foals before weaning is mares and, as the number of foals in the herd increases over the course of the foaling season, other foals. Weanlings spread the disease among their herd during the period shortly after weaning when foals from more than one group are mixed. The incidence density of new cases among weanlings can be as high as 13 new cases per 1000 foal weeks. The disease associated with these outbreaks is mild and without long-term consequences to the foal or weanling. However, the presence of foals excreting large quantities of EHV-1 has the potential to increase the risk of viral abortion in late-term mares in contact with these foals. Furthermore, the presence of respiratory disease associated with EHV-1 and shedding of virus by foals is associated with development of myeloencephalopathy in mares.",

A likely scenario in abortion storms is the reactivation of latent virus in a resident horse with subsequent shedding of virus in nasal secretions or, if the mare aborts, fetal tissues and uterine fluids. Contamination of the environment or horse-to-horse contact spreads infection to susceptible cohorts (primary transmission). The infected cohorts then further spread the virus to other horses in that band of mares (secondary transmission), which then spread infection among other bands of mares and foals, paddocks or fields of horses, or farms (tertiary transmission).",

EHV-1 DNA, but not EHV-4, was detected in semen samples of 51 of 390 stallions, illustrating the potential for spread of the virus during mating or artificial insemination. 50 The virus is efficiently transmitted to in-contact animals, and rapid spread of infection results from close contact of an infected animal with susceptible horses.

Horses and foals are infectious during the active stage of disease and, because horses become latently infected, during subsequent periods of viral reactivation and shedding. Latent infection occurs by inclusion of virus in immune cells (CD8+ T cells) in trigeminal ganglia, submandibular lymph nodes, and likely other immunologically active tissues. 9,30,51 Latent infection by EHV-1 virus can be reactivated by administration of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants but, at least in experimental situations, the resulting level of viremia is very low and in-contact susceptible horses were not infected. 51 Virus is detectable in nasal fluids of approximately 70% of horses when they first exhibit clinical signs of EHM and for up to 9 days after development of it. 32, 47 The duration of nasal shedding is not related to age, duration of fever, or severity of clinical signs. 32 There is good circumstantial evidence, such as the occurrence of abortion, neonatal disease, or myeloencephalopathy in closed herds, to support a role for latency and reactivation in the genesis of the disease, although the importance of reversion from latency has been questioned.

The virus gains access to the body after binding to respiratory mucosal epithelium where it forms plaques that do not extend into submucosal tissues. 35 In the respiratory tract there is an initial phase after infection of nasal epithelium 56 in which there is rapid proliferation of the virus in the nasal, pharyngeal, and tonsillar mucosae, with subsequent penetration and infection of local blood vessels. This is followed by a systemic, viremic phase in which the virus is closely associated with blood lymphocytes (especially CD172a(+)), 56 from which it can be isolated. Infection induces increased production of IFN-\u03b3 by T lymphocytes. 54 Absence of viral antigens on the surface of EHV-1infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells explains their ability to avoid complementmediated lysis. This activity, combined with the immunosuppression that accompanies EHV-1 infection, 55,57-59 allows dissemination of the infection to the reproductive tract and CNS. Immunosuppression is mediated by production in EHV-1-infected cells of an \"early protein\" that interferes with peptide results in leukopenia that is attributable to both neutropenia and T-cell lymphopenia, with B-cell lymphocytosis occurring during the recovery period. EHV-1 septicemia of foals is characterized by profound leukopenia, neutropenia with a left shift, and lymphopenia. An approach to achieving prompt antemortem diagnosis of EHM is suggested in Fig. 14-9 . 63 CSF of horses with EHV-1 encephalomyelopathy is characteristically xanthochromic and has an increased total protein concentration (>1 g/L) with a normal white cell count. 32, 64 The interpretation of EHV-1 antibody in CSF is uncertain, although normal horses are not expected to have detectable antibodies to EHV-1 in the CSF.",

However, highly specific ELISA tests based on differences between EHV-1 and EHV-2 in the variable region of the C terminus of glycoprotein G, at least one of which is commercially available, have been developed that can differentiate between antibodies to EHV-1 and EHV-4 in horse serum. The ELISA is reported to be more sensitive, easier to perform, more rapid, and more reproducible than the virus neutralization test. Importantly, the ELISA test is able to differentiate between infections associated with EHV-1 and EHV-4. 65, 66 Identification of the virus in nasal swabs, or blood buffy coat, or tissue by culture or a PCR test provides confirmation of infection. [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] The use of seminested or multiplex PCR or qPCR, which avoids the risk of carryover contamination, provides rapid identification of EHV-1 viral genome in nasopharyngeal swabs, blood, and other tissues.

Rapid identification of virus shedding using qPCR can facilitate monitoring and interventions to prevent spread of infection and additional examination or prophylactic treatment of infected horses.",

Additionally, vaccination of mares is intended to reduce transmission of EHV-1 to foals in an attempt to interrupt the cyclical nature of infection on stud farms. Vaccines consisting of a modified live EHV-1, inactivated EHV-1, or a mixture of inactivated EHV-1 and EHV-4 are available for intramuscular or intranasal administration to horses. Both inactivated and modified live EHV-1 vaccines elicit virus-neutralization and complement fixation antibody responses in horses, although high antibody titers are not necessarily related to resistance to infection.",

Widespread use of a combined EHV-1 and EHV-4 killed virus vaccine in Australia has not reduced serologic evidence of infection in foals on farms where mares are vaccinated, although the vaccine was effective in preventing disease induced by experimental infection. Complicating assessment of vaccine efficacy is the variable response to vaccination by some mares and foals, with certain animals having minimal responses to vaccination, which in other horses elicits a strong immune response. Efforts are underway to develop modified live vaccines that can be administered intranasally. Intranasal administration of one such EHV-1 vaccine induced protection against experimentally induced EHV-1 (and EHV-4) respiratory disease and abortion in mares, and prevented infection of foals even when administered in the presence of maternally derived antibodies. An alternative approach is the development of subunit vaccines using the envelope glycoprotein D, which has been shown to elicit protective immunity in laboratory animal models of EHV-1 disease and administration of which induces VN antibody and glycoprotein D-specific ELISA antibodies in horses. Current modified live vaccines appear to induce a more restricted IgG isotype than does natural infection, which could partly account for their limited efficacy. 53 Despite the incomplete protection afforded by vaccines, vaccination against EHV-1 is an important part of most equine herd health programs in the vaccination of pregnant and nonpregnant mares, foals, and adult horses. The intent of vaccination of mares is to prevent abortion associated with EHV-1. One inactivated virus vaccine is reported to decrease the incidence of abortion by 65%, although others have not been able to replicate this success and there are reports of abortion storms on farms of wellvaccinated mares. An inactivated virus vaccine containing EHV-1 and EHV-4 prevented abortion in five of six mares exposed experimentally to EHV-1, whereas all six nonvaccinated mares aborted. Mares are parenteral nutrition and fluid administration (see the section Clinical Assessment and Care of Critically Ill Newborns in Chapter 19) . Treatment with acyclovir has been reported. Failure of transfer of passive immunity should be rectified with oral or intravenous administration of colostrum or plasma, respectively.",

The challenges of this approach are that the infection is well advanced by the time clinical signs of neurologic disease are detected, especially in cases early in the disease outbreak before purposeful monitoring is in place, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the available drugs are unknown or imperfectly known, and the drugs are expensive. Antiviral drugs considered for use in horses with EHM include acyclovir, valacyclovir, penciclovir (after oral administration of its prodrug famciclovir), ganciclovir, and valganciclovir. [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] Acyclovir is effective against EHV-1 in vitro, and pharmacokinetic studies suggest that administration of 10 mg/kg orally every 4 to 6 hours (five times daily) or 10 mg/kg intravenously every 8 hours results in acceptable concentrations of drug in the blood. However, further investigation reveals that there is a large variation between individual horses in the absorption of acyclovir with consequent failure to obtain therapeutic concentrations in many horses. 79 The in vitro activity of acyclovir, ganciclovir, cidofovir, adefovir, 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)-2,6-diaminopurine (PMEDAP) and foscarnet against three abortigenic isolates and three neuropathogenic isolates of EHV-1 revealed variable activity of cidofovir and limited to no activity of foscarnet. 80 Current recommendations for the prophylaxis and treatment of horses with EHM include administration of acyclovir (10-20 mg/kg every 5-8 hours, orally for 7 days) or ganciclovir IV at 2.5 mg/kg every 8 h for 24 h followed by maintenance dosing of 2.5 mg/kg every 12 h, or orally at 30-40 mg/kg every 8-12 h for 7 days. 72 The efficacy of these compounds has not been demonstrated in appropriate clinical trials, and earlier comments about the variability in oral bioavailability of acyclovir should be noted.",

No vaccines are currently licensed with the claim of preventing EHM, and the disease occurs in well-vaccinated horses. Concerns that the disease might represent a \"second hit\" as a result of vaccination and subsequent infection have not received widespread support and do not have empirical evidence that is in any way supportive. 21 Foals are an important source of infection and control of infection in foals is considered critical to control of infection on a farm. Consequently, attention has been paid to the responses of foals to vaccination at various ages, given the risk of passive immunity interfering with vaccination and the early age at which foals are infected by EHV-1. Current recommendations vary with some authorities recommending vaccination of foals after 5 months of age, to avoid the interfering effect of passive immunity on response to vaccination. However, vaccination of foals at this age likely misses the period of time when foals are first infected by EHV-1 from their dam or other mares in the band. One recommendation is that foals should be vaccinated in their third month, with revaccination 1 month and 6 months later. Modified live virus vaccine is given to foals at 3 to 4 months of age, and nonpregnant mares and other horses are given two doses administered 3 months apart followed by revaccination every 9 months. Because of the short duration of immunity following vaccination, frequent vaccination, perhaps at intervals as short as 3 months, of horses at high risk is recommended. However, the efficacy of such a program is uncertain.",

The incubation period for EHV-1 abortion ranges between 9 and 121 days. \u2022 All nonpregnant animals and mares that have foaled should remain at the stud for 30 days after the last abortion. The main problem that arises in this program is in deciding what to do with mares that come into contact with the respiratory disease but not the abortion disease. This may occur very early in pregnancy and prolonged isolation would be onerous. The decision usually depends on the owner's risk aversion and the availability of facilities to maintain long-term isolation. equipment that might have been contaminated should be disinfected by thorough cleaning followed by application of a phenolic or iodophor disinfectant. The mare should be isolated until results of laboratory examination are negative for EHV-1 or until the second estrus, at which time it is unlikely that there is shedding of virus from the reproductive tract. Other mares in the same band as the mare that aborted should be considered exposed and at risk of abortion. These mares should be held in strict isolation until the results of laboratory examination are negative for EHV-1, or until they foal or abort.

Borna disease is now recognized as a subacute meningoencephalitis in horses, cattle, sheep, rabbits, and cats in Germany, Sweden, and Switzerland. 2 There are reports of encephalitis with Borna disease virus genome detected in lesions by PCR in a horse and a cow in Japan. The disease apparently occurs in New World camelids. 3 Encephalitis associated with Borna disease virus was detected in young ostriches in Israel. The disease does not appear to be a common cause of nonsuppurative encephalitis in pigs. 4 Serologic evidence of infection by Borna disease virus is widespread both geographically and in the range of species. 5, 6 Borna disease virus is suspected of causing disease in humans, including lymphocytic meningoencephalitis, but infection is not associated with an increased prevalence of psychiatric disorders. Others suggest that the presence of circulating Borna disease virus immune complexes (Borna disease virus antigen and specific antibodies) is associated with severe mood disorders in humans. The role, if any, of Borna disease virus in human neurologic or psychiatric disease has not been established with any certainty and is the subject of considerable debate. 1 Detection Important enteric viruses of the pig belong to the Picornaviridae particularly enteroviruses, teschoviruses and sapeloviruses (formerly porcine enterovirus A or porcine enterovirus).",

This takes the form of perivascular cuffing with mononuclear cells, focal gliosis, neuronal necrosis, and neuronophagia. The brainstem and spinal cord show the most extensive lesions, often with the most severe lesions in the cord. These take the form of degenerated or necrotic nerve cells in the ventral horns, glial nodules, occasional hemorrhage, and a diffuse infiltration of mononuclear cells. In the white matter the changes were not so severe. Infiltration of mononuclear cells was also seen in the dorsal root ganglia (together with degenerated ganglion cells and neuronophagia) spinal nerves, and sciatic nerves. Swollen myelin sheaths and axonal spheroids were seen in the peripheral nerves. Meningitis, particularly over the cerebellum, is an early manifestation of the disease.

This is the so-called \"species barrier, \" which may be absolute or partial because it will affect only a proportion of animals on first passage, or may result in an extended incubation period on first passage.",

An assessment in 1996 of risk for the occurrence of BSE in the United States concluded that the potential risk of an epizootic was small and that there are substantial differences in the strength of the risk factors between the United States and the UK. These result from differences in proportional numbers of sheep and cattle, differences in the nature of the beef and dairy industries, the type of animal used for beef production and the age at slaughter, and differences in the practice of feeding ruminant-derived protein in calf rations, which is uncommon in the United States. Thus the risk of an outbreak similar to that in the UK was considered negligible. However, a case in a native-born cow in the United States occurred in 2005.

Some countries with a high incidence of BSE have banned cattle over 30 months of age for human consumption. disposal of the carcass by incineration. The limitations of passive surveillance were described earlier and, in most countries, passive surveillance has been replaced with some form of active surveillance. Active surveillance was initially directed at a targeted proportion of culled animals, animals manifesting neurologic disease, rabies suspects negative for rabies, fallen (down) cattle, and emergency slaughter categories, and a proportion of cattle, or all cattle, over 24 to 30 months (depending on country) that were presented for slaughter for human consumption. In slaughter cattle, the sampling frame was set to detect BSE at a prevalence rate of one mature animal in a million mature animals. The ability to conduct active surveillance, particularly on slaughter cattle, has been allowed by the development of rapid tests that can be conducted and read while the carcass is being held so that positive test cattle are not released for human consumption. Positive rapid tests need to be confirmed by histology and IHC. More recently, because the average age of BSE cases has been over 11 years, meaning that they were born before the date of the reinforced feed ban, the majority of EU countries have now raised the age limit for testing to 72 months for healthy slaughtered cattle (or even stopped testing) and to 48 months for fallen stock and emergency slaughter categories. 1 In the United States, following the case of BSE in an imported cow, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) implemented an intensive national testing program for BSE that concentrated on a targeted highrisk population. The purpose is to help discover if BSE is in the United States and, if so, at what level. The intention is to sample as many cattle over a 12-to 18-month period as possible with the goal of examining 268,500 cattle. This would allow a detection rate of 1 in 10 million with a 99% confidence level. The cattle will be over 30 months of age and include nonambulatory cattle, cattle that are too weak to walk, cattle that are moribund, cattle with neurologic signs, rabies suspects that are negative, and dead cattle.",

These tests typically apply proteinase K to destroy the cellular isoform of the prion protein (PrP c ) while maintaining a proteinase K-resistant disease-associated isoform (PrP sc ). This approach has identified three types of BSE: classical type (C-type), H-type, and L-type, with the H and L designation referring to the apparent molecular weights of the proteins. 20 Major histologic changes are in the brainstem, and the pathognomonic lesion is a bilaterally symmetric intracytoplasmic vacuolation of neurons and gray matter neuropil. The occurrence of vacuolation in the solitary tract and the spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve in the medulla oblongata is the basis of the statutory diagnosis of the disease in Great Britain. In Great Britain, statutory diagnosis is achieved by an examination of a single brainstem section obtained via the foramen magnum and obviating the need of extracting the brain with the associated risk of aerosol production. This sampling location has the potential to miss some cattle infected with atypical BSE. 21 Scrapie-associated fibrils can be visualized by electron microscopy.

After digestion by exogenous enzymes, the BSE PrP molecule is shorter than that of scrapie stains giving rise to different IHC patterns, and this is supported by Western blot studies. Unlike scrapie, the intracellular truncation site of ovine BSE PrP is influenced by the cell type in which it accumulates, giving distinct patterns of immunolabeling with different PrP antibodies. Epitope labeling shows that the shortest fragment of disease-associated PrP occurs in tangible body macrophages followed by glial cells and neurons. It appears that this difference in truncation of PrP in experimentally infected BSE sheep is not influenced by route of inoculation or by genotype or by sheep bred, and it is proposed that truncation patterns, as detected by immunoblotting and IHC, can be used in surveys for BSE in sheep.",

PrP C can be converted to a scrapie prion protein molecule (PrP Sc ) in infected sheep which, when it accumulates in the CNS, causes disease. The susceptibility of sheep to this conversion, and thus to scrapie, is strongly associated with certain polymorphisms at codons 136, 154, and 171. It is thought that there are at least two groups of scrapie TSE strains, one of which is influenced primarily by the amino acid at codon 136 and the other group by the amino acid at codon 171.

There is substantial genetic control of the incidence of disease, and in both the natural and experimental disease, genetics is a major determinant of susceptibility with the susceptibility of sheep strongly linked to certain polymorphisms in the sheep PrP gene. In earlier studies, experimental challenge and breeding showed that sheep could exhibit a long or short incubation period following challenge, and that this difference in incubation period or susceptibility was determined by a single gene called scrapie incubation period (Sip). There is a similar gene in mice (Sinc) that determines incubation period and susceptibility following experimental challenge. The Sip gene has two alleles, sA and pA, which, respectively, shorten or prolong the experimental incubation period for most strains of the scrapie agent. The subsequent recognition of prion protein (PrP) and its association with scrapie led to the recognition of the gene that encodes PrP, which was found congruent to and AV RR. \u2022 They can also be referred to using the codon number followed by the corresponding amino acid 136AA, 171RR and 136AV, 171RR or the amino acid followed by the codon. \u2022 Often only the amino acids at codon 171 are listed.",

How the scrapie agent reaches the CNS is not certain, but it is probably through transportation across intestinal villous enterocytes 15 and subsequent infection of the autonomic nervous system.

The overall aim is to identify sheep genetically resistant to scrapie on the basis of their genotype (ARR) and to and breed them to create a national flock with scrapie resistance. Genetic testing will allow the selection of resistant sheep for breeding and the culling of susceptible sheep, particularly in breeds such as the Suffolk in which the genetics of susceptibility appear relatively simple. The UK has a Voluntary National Scrapie Flocks Scheme and a National Scrapie Plan which, under EU regulations, become compulsory for flocks that have had a case of scrapie after July 2004. Under the Compulsory Scrapie Flocks Scheme farmers with confirmed scrapie cases on their farms will either have their sheep flocks genotype tested so that those animals more susceptible to disease can be identified and removed or the whole flock slaughtered and disposed of. All goats on affected holdings also will be slaughtered and disposed of. Testing of breeding rams will also become compulsory for all purebred flocks and any other flocks producing and selling homebred rams for breeding. All rams carrying VRQ PrP genotypes will be slaughtered or castrated. Allied to this will be a voluntary ewe-testing scheme.",

These equilibria reactions help to explain the association between high sulfate intakes, high-grain diets, and increased risk of sulfur-associated PEM. The ingestion of excessive quantities of sulfur from the diet and water supply can cause the disease in cattle and sheep without any change in the thiamine status of the tissues.

Ultrastructural examination of the brain of sheep with the natural disease reveals that the first change that occurs is an edema of the intracellular compartment, principally and alfalfa hay.

The clinical and necropsy findings were identical to PEM; however, molasses toxicity is not thiamine responsive and can be reversed by feeding forage.",

If ruminants inhale 60% of eructated gases, inhalation of hydrogen sulfide could be a route of systemic sulfide absorption, in addition to gastrointestinal absorption.

The hydrogen sulfide test is more accurate when applied to healthy animals in the same pen as an animal showing clinical signs of sulfate-induced PEM, because affected animals have a markedly reduced appetite and therefore lower sulfate intake and higher ruminal pH.",

The response is the same in all species, but in pigs there is also an accumulation of eosinophils in nervous tissue and the meninges. The sodium ion is the one that accumulates in the tissues, and identical syndromes are produced by the feeding of sodium propionate or sodium sulfate.

In the UK, primary vitamin A deficiency occurs in housed cattle fed a ration containing little or no green forage. Animals at pasture receive adequate supplies of the vitamin, except during prolonged droughts, but animals confined indoors and fed prepared diets may be deficient if not adequately supplemented. For example, a diet of dried sugar beet pulp, concentrates, and poor-quality hay can result in hypovitaminosis A in confined beef cattle. Primary vitamin A deficiency is still relatively common in beef cattle that depend on pasture and roughage for the major portion of their diet. Beef calves coming off dry summer pastures at 6 to 8 months of age are commonly marginally deficient.",

However, vitamin A in the ester form, as it occurs in fish oils, will pass the placental barrier in cows. Feeding of these oils, or the parenteral administration of a vitamin A injectable preparation before parturition, will cause an increase in stores of the vitamin in fetal livers. Antepartum feeding of carotene and the alcohol form of the vitamin does, however, cause an increase in the vitamin A content of the colostrum. Young animals depend on the dam's colostrum for their early requirements of the vitamin, which is always highest in colostrum and returns to normal levels within a few days of parturition. Pigs weaned very early at 2 to 4 weeks may require special supplementation. Pregnant beef cows wintered on poor-quality roughage commonly need supplementation with vitamin A throughout the winter months to ensure normal development of the fetus and an adequate supply of the vitamin in the colostrum at parturition.",

The onset of clinical signs in growing feedlot cattle is typically seen 6 to 12 months after feeding a diet deficient in carotene or vitamin A. Small farm feedlots may feed their cattle a cereal grain such as barley and barley straw with no vitamin supplementation or inadequate supplementation. Grains, with the exception of yellow corn, contain negligible amounts of carotene, and cereal hay is often a poor source. Any hay cut late, leached by rain, bleached by sun, or stored for long periods loses much of its carotene content. The carotene content of yellow corn also deteriorates markedly with long storage. Moreover, under conditions not yet completely understood, the conversion by ruminants of carotene present in feeds such as silage may be much less complete than was formerly thought. In feedlot cattle, the disease is most common in steers fed the same ration as heifers that may remain clinically normal.

The intake of inorganic phosphorus also affects vitamin A storage, low phosphate diets facilitating storage of the vitamin. This may have a sparing effect on vitamin A requirements during drought periods when phosphorus intake is low and an exacerbating effect in stall-fed cattle on a good grain diet. However, phosphorus deficiency may lower the efficiency of carotene conversion. Vitamins C and E help to prevent loss of vitamin A in feedstuffs and during digestion. Additional factors, which may increase the requirement of vitamin A, include high environmental temperatures and a high nitrate content of the feed, which reduces the conversion of carotene to vitamin A and rapid rate of gain.

In Friesian cattle it is inherited as a lysosomal storage disease in which the activity of an enzyme, \u03b2-galactosidase, in nervous tissue is greatly reduced. As a result, there is an accumulation of the ganglioside (GM 1 ) in the tissue. Clinical signs of progressive neuromotor dysfunction and a reduction in growth rate appear at about 3 months of age. The growth rate is reduced, and the animal is in poor condition, blind, and has a staring coat. The neuromotor signs include lack of response to external stimuli, sluggish mastication and swallowing, hindquarter sway while walking, a wide stance, a tendency to fall, reluctance to move, stiff high-stepping gait, aimless walking, head-pressing, and convulsions. Abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) tracings are common. The blindness results from lesions in the retina and the optic nerve. Ophthalmoscopic examination of the retina is recommended as an aid to diagnosis. A positive diagnosis is made on the grounds of intraneuronal lipid storage plus reduced \u03b2-galactosidase activity plus identification of the stored lipid. The stored ganglioside is visible under the electron microscope as stacks and concentric whorls of lamellae. In the live animal enzyme assays are performed on leukocytes. The enzymatic defect is also detectable in liver, skin, and leukocytes.",

They are grouped together because of common clinical and pathologic phenomena related to brain and retinal atrophy, premature death, and accumulation of a fluorescent lipopigment in neurons and many other cell types within the body. Molecular genetic studies have identified mutations in eight different genes (CLN1, CLN2, CLN3, CLN5, CLN6, CLN6, CLN8, and CTSD) that can result in neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses. [1] [2] [3] [4] The disease is recorded in Devon cattle, 1 South Hampshire sheep, 2,3,4 Rambouillet sheep, Borderdale sheep, 5 Merino sheep, Nubian goats, and Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs. 6 It resembles neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis of humans and is not strictly a primary lysosomal disorder; it is classified as a proteolipid proteinosis, and provides a good animal model for discussing the similar disease (Batten disease) of humans. Secondary lysosomes in animals with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses fill with subunit c of mitochondrial ATP synthase because of excessive peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. The mechanism of the accumulation is that protein is formed, which is normal for mitochondria, but is misdirected so that it accumulates in the lysosome. The disease in Devon cattle is caused by a single base duplication in the bovine CLN5 gene. 1 The disease in Merino sheep is a subunit cstoring abnormality, clinically and pathologically similar to ceroid lipofuscinosis in South Hampshire sheep, which is caused by a missense mutation in the ovine CLN6 gene. 2, 3 The disease in Borderdale sheep is caused by a nucleotide substitution in the ovine CLN5 gene. 5 The occurrence of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis in South Hampshire and Borderdale sheep in New Zealand have been well described. The severity of neurodegeneration and minor differences in the ultrastructure of storage material suggests this is a different disease from other forms of ovine ceroid lipofuscinosis, which accumulate the subunit c of mitochondrial ATP synthase. An autosomal recessive mode of inheritance is considered probable.",

There is a progressive storage of lipopigment in nervous tissue, especially retinal photoreceptors; its presence can be demonstrated by quantitative autofluorescence using a modified slit lamp microscope. Other clinicopathologic aids include lysosomal enzyme assay, organ biopsy, and CT, which reveals the enlargement of the lateral ventricles of the brain resulting from cerebral atrophy.",

Most calves are obviously affected at birth. While lying down, there is no marked abnormality, although a moderate lateral tremor of the neck occurs, causing a gentle side-to-side swaying of the head. Severely affected calves are blind; they have widely dilated pupils and their pupils do not react to light. Such calves are unable to stand, even when assisted, because of flaccidity of limb muscles. When less severely affected animals attempt to rise, the head is thrown back excessively, the limb movements are exaggerated in force and range and are grossly incoordinated, and many calves are unable to rise without assistance. If they are placed on their feet, the calves adopt a straddle-legged stance with the feet wide apart and the legs and neck extended excessively. On attempting to move, limb movements are incoordinated and the calf falls, sometimes backward because of overextension of the forelimbs. Affected animals drink well but have great difficulty in getting to the teat or pail, with attempts usually wide of the mark. There are no defects of consciousness and no convulsions. Tremor may be evident while standing and there may be postrotational nystagmus after rapid lateral head movements. Sight and hearing are unimpaired and, although complete recovery does not occur, the calf may be able to compensate sufficiently to enable it to be reared to a vealing weight. Diagnosis can be confirmed by MRI. At necropsy the most severe defect comprises complete absence of the cerebellum; hypoplasia of the olivary nuclei, the pons, and optic nerves; and partial or complete absence of the occipital cortex. Less severe defects include a reduction in size of the cerebellum and absence of some neuronal elements in a cerebellum of normal size.",

The characteristic signs are vertical head-nodding (some cases show horizontal head tremors), especially when excited, and ataxia, which is most noticeable at a fast gait. It may not be evident while the foal is walking. Very badly affected foals are unable to stand or suckle at birth, less severe ones are normal until about 4 months of age when head-nodding becomes obvious. The degree of ataxia varies from slight incoordination to inability to stand. A goose-stepping gait, which slams the front feet into the ground, occurs in some. All foals can see but there is an absence of the menace reflex in many. Nystagmus is not recorded as occurring in this disease. The first antemortem confirmatory test to be developed was computer-assisted MRI brain morphometry, which is used to determine the presence of a relatively smaller cerebellum and relatively larger cerebellar CSF space compared with size-matched horses. 3 Diagnosis has historically been made on the basis of breed and age of the animal, clinical signs, slow progression of disease, and elimination of other differential diagnoses. 2 The recent development of a DNA test on hair roots that detects the presence of the putative cerebellar abiotrophy gene mutation [4] [5] [6] should make antemortem diagnosis much more straightforward in Arabian horses.",

The lesion must affect at least the ventral third of the cord before spinal shock occurs. When the shock wears off, the effects of the residual lesion remain. These may be temporary in themselves and completely normal function may return as the edema or the hemorrhage is resorbed. In sheep, extensive experimental damage to the cord may be followed by recovery to the point of being able to walk, but not sufficiently to be of any practical significance. Traumatic lesions usually affect the whole cross-section of the cord and produce a syndrome typical of complete transection. Partial transection signs are more common in slowly developing lesions.

Horses <1 year of age are at lower risk of developing disease than are horse 1 to 4 years of age. Older horses are less likely to develop the disease.

Signs of spinal ataxia range from subtle changes in gait, which are difficult to differentiate from obscure lameness caused by musculoskeletal disease, through obvious spinal ataxia evident as truncal sway, toe dragging, and circumduction of feet, to spontaneous falling and recumbency. Asymmetry of clinical signs, in which one limb is affected more than the contralateral limb, is highly suggestive of EPM because CSM and equine degenerative myelopathy usually cause symmetric ataxia.",

Diagnosis has focused on the demonstration of antibodies to S. neurona in serum or CSF by Western blot, indirect fluorescence testing, or ELISA. The important concept is use of paired serum and CSF samples to demonstrate intrathecal production of antibodies to differentiate infection associated with neurologic disease from clinically inapparent infection. 13, [27] [28] [29] The sensitivity and specificity of Western blot (Sn 80%-89%, Sp 38%-87% on serum, and Sn ~88% and Sp 44%-89% in CSF); indirect FAT (IFAT) (Sn 59%-94%, Sp 71%-100% in serum, and Sn 65%-100%, Sp 90%-99% in CSF); SAG1 ELISA (Sn 13%-68%, Sp 71%-97% in serum); and SAG2,4/3 ELISA (Sn 30%-86%, Sp 37%-88% in serum, Sn 77%-96% and Sp 58%-96% in CSF) for detection of EPM have been recently reviewed. 13, 28, 29 The combination of serum and CSF testing using tests to detect antibodies to SAG2, 4/3 surface proteins were the most sensitive and specific for diagnosis of horses with clinical signs of neurologic disease. 28, 29 Interpretation of the results of Western blot analysis of CSF for IgG antibodies to S. neurona is problematic because of the potential for blood contamination of the sample during collection, and the high sensitivity but low specificity of the test. Blood contamination of the sample is problematic in horses that are seropositive for antibodies to S. neurona and in which it is desired to know if antibodies are present in CSF. Contamination of CSF with blood can introduce antibodies from serum into the otherwise antibody-free CSF, causing a \"false\"positive test. Contamination of CSF with small quantities of blood with high concentrations of antibodies to S. neurona might not be detectable using RBCs, albumin quotient, or immunoglobulin index, but could yield a positive result on Western blot testing.",

This genus is closely related to the lungworms of small ruminants but is found in the cranial subarachnoid space, cranial venous sinuses, and occasionally in the spinal subarachnoid space. Paralaphostrongylus tenuis occurs in white-tailed deer 1 and moose 2 in eastern North America and parts of western Canada, E. cervi in deer, sheep, and goat in Europe 3-5 and New Zealand, and E. rangiferi in reindeer in Scandinavia. P. odocoilei has been found to infect bighorn sheep in North America. 6 Eggs or larvae are carried to the lungs, undergo a tracheal migration, and the firststage larvae are passed in the feces. The larvae are quite resistant to adverse environmental conditions and enter slugs or snails to develop into infective larvae. The lifecycle is complete when infected molluscs are ingested by deer and the larvae penetrate the abomasum and migrate, possibly along spinal nerves, to the spinal cord where they develop into adults and migrate into the subarachnoid space. Clinical signs are not seen in infected deer, but in sheep, goats and New World Camelids the worm continually moves through nervous system tissue causing limping and incoordination followed by almost complete paralysis of the hindlimbs or of the neck, body, and all four legs. 3, [7] [8] [9] There are usually no signs of cerebral involvement, and affected animals remain bright and continue to eat. If given supportive treatment, they may survive for at least 1 month. P. tenuis also transmits to moose and is responsible for the nervous signs in \"moose sickness, \" including the following 4 Histopathologic lesions include axonal degeneration and swelling, perivascular cuffing, presence of hemosiderin-laden macrophages, and increased numbers of eosinophils. 9, 10 Clinical signs of spinal cord disease attributed to Parelaphostrongylus tenuis appear to diminish after treatment with high doses of oral fenbendazole (50 mg/kg, daily for five days), although randomized clinical trials have not been completed to confirm this impression.",

Most cases are manifested by a flexion of the hock that can be violent enough for the horse to kick itself in the abdomen. The hoof is held in this position for a moment and then stamped hard on the ground. If both hindlegs are affected, progress is very slow and difficult and the horses often use a bunny-hopping gait. In the most severe cases the horse is unable to rise without assistance. The horse's general health is unaffected, although it may be difficult for it to graze.

It has been observed in crossbred Brahman cattle and in an Ayrshire \u00d7 Beef Shorthorn crossbred steer. The disease occurs principally in calves, with signs appearing from several weeks to 6 months or more after birth. Occasional cases are reported as developing in adult European cattle, and there is one report of the occurrence of the disease in adult Indian cattle. The disease was first termed Elso heel based on its first description in 1922 as a heritable disease from an East Friesian bull named Elso II. The preferred name spastic paresis was first used in 1932 to emphasize the primary defect. 1 It has been held for a long time that the disease is inherited, and the principal argument has centered on the mode of inheritance. Attempts to determine this have shown that the rate of occurrence in planned test matings is so low that, if inheritance is involved, it can only be the inheritance of a susceptibility to the disease. It is suggested that different time appearances represent a single disease entity with varying expressivity, with the late forms affected by cumulative environmental factors. A proposed hypothesis is of a gene with increased penetrance in the homozygote, with weak penetrance in the heterozygote, acting on a polygenic basis dependent on external factors. Males appear to be affected more often than females, but a clear sex predilection has not been identified. The prevalence of disease appears to be <1% in all breeds. 1 Infectious agents causing transmissible subacute spongiform encephalopathies interacting with trace elements such as lithium have been suggested as etiologic agents, but there is no evidence to support this hypothesis.",

If only one leg is affected, it may be thrust out behind while the calf is walking and advanced with a restricted, swinging motion often without touching the ground. There is no resistance to passive flexion of the limb and the animal appears normal while sitting. Clinical signs are most exaggerated after immediately encouraging a sitting animal to stand. The gastrocnemius and perforatus muscles are rigid and in a state of spastic contraction. There is a characteristic elevation of the tail (Fig. 14-19) .

Extensive examinations of muscles and tendons have failed to reveal histologic abnormalities. The absence of any structural lesion and the variation in intensity of the abnormality suggests that it is a functional one. An overactive stretch reflex is thought to be responsible for the clinical signs, possibly caused by defective glycinergic synaptic transmission and alteration of calcium signaling proteins (Fig. 14-20) . 1, 2 The diagnosis of spastic paresis is based on history, signalment, clinical signs, and progressive nature of the disease. A genetic test is currently unavailable because the underlying gene defect(s) have yet to be identified. An epidural injection of 0.38% procaine solution diminishes the clinical signs of spastic contracture within 10 to 15 minute and has provided a useful supporting diagnostic test when the gastrocnemius is the principal muscle of contracture; it is less helpful in cases of spastic contraction of the quadriceps. In the latter case ultrasoundguided infiltration around the femoral nerve with local anesthetic solution may be attempted. 1, 3 In Europe, affected animals are kept for breeding purposes, especially if they are double-muscled. They are kept because of the efficacy of the curative surgical operation (partial tibial neurectomy) and for the high incidence of double-muscling in such calves. In the Holstein breed, and several German breeds, bulls that sire affected calves have been observed to have very straight hocks and to suffer from various forms of stifle and hock lameness early in life.",

A similar disease of medium-wool Merinos, characterized by progressive posterior ataxia and degeneration of sensory tracts in thoracic segments of spinal cord, commencing after 5 months of age and terminating fatally before 2 years of age, is also recorded in Australia. It is probably also an inherited defect",

Neuronal dystrophy of the cuneate and gracilis nuclei is considered a form of EDM and is likely the underlying pathophysiologic process of EDM. 1 The prevalence of the disease varies widely, with up to 40% of susceptible animals on a farm being affected, although the disease is usually sporadic. There is a familial predisposition to the disease apparently involving an increased requirement for vitamin E, although other factors, including housing, are contributory. Foals from dams that had an EDM-affected foal were at a significantly higher risk (relative risk = 25) of developing EDM than foals from other dams. The occurrence of clusters of cases involving related horses is supportive of a genetic component with inheritance as in an autosomal dominant with variable expression or polygenic manner, although this has not been confirmed in all breeds.

A role for oxidative stress and damage to neurons is supported by documentation of markers of oxidative stress in nervous tissue and low serum and/or CSF vitamin E concentrations in two horses with EDM and not in healthy control horses. 5 Low vitamin E concentrations in serum are often associated with the disease, but in one small study only foals with a genetic predisposition to the disease, and having a low serum vitamin E concentration, developed the disease.

Ataxia is the incoordinated movement of limbs and is evident as interference of one limb with another (such as one foot stepping on another when the horse is tightly circled), knuckling of the fetlock joint (which can also be a sign of weakness), unusual placement of feet (excessively wide-based or narrow-based stance, incomplete or delayed return of the foot to its normal position after it is relocated to an abnormal position, excessive circumduction of the outside foot during tight circling), stumbling, and/or swaying of the trunk during walking in a straight line. Paresis is weakness and is evident in its most extreme form as inability of the horse to rise. In less extreme manifestations it is evident as knuckling of the fetlock joint, stumbling when walking downhill or over obstacles, and ease of pulling the horse to one side by the tail when it is walking. Dysmetria refers to uneven gait typified by undershoot or overshoot of the limb such that the hoof is in an incorrect position.

            "text": "An intravertebral sagittal ratio of the spinal canal to vertebral body diameter of less than 50% for C4-C6 is associated with a 26-to 41-fold increase in the probability of a compressive myelopathy for horse >320 kg; in a separate study all horses with a value of this ratio of less than 0.485 had at least one compressive lesion. 15 An intervertebral ratio can also be calculated and it has diagnostic utility that might be slightly greater than that of the intravertebral ratio. 2, 15 The results of these tests are not definitive and a healthy horse can have ratios below this cutoff and affected horses can have normal ratios. 16, 17 It is important to recognize that the utility of intravertebral (and other) ratios is dependent on the pretest likelihood that the horse has cervical compressive myelopathy. The ratios should therefore be considered in light of other clinical findings. Importantly, neither the intravertebral nor intervertebral ratios predict the site of compression, which can only be detected by myelographic examination. 2 Myelography has been considered to provide the definitive antemortem confirmation of spinal cord compression, but recent studies demonstrate that it is not a perfect diagnostic test and that results should be interpreted cautiously. 2 The sensitivity of this technique, using a 50% reduction in the width of the dorsal dye column as a cutoff for diagnosis of the disease, is 53% (95% CI 34%-72%, n = 22) and the specificity is 89% (95% CI of 84%-93%, n = 228) (Fig. 14-24 ). 2 Others have found similar values for sensitivity and specificity with values of 47% and 78%, respectively, for older horses with compressive myelopathy at caudal cervical sites. 1 These values indicate a test with a relatively high false-negative rate but low false-positive rate for neutral views and indicate that a positive finding on myelography is highly suggestive of the disease, but that a negative finding does not eliminate the possibility of the disease. The false-positive rate is increased to 12% to 27% for compression at midcervical sites during neck flexion. Myelography is superior in diagnosing compressive lesions at C6-C7 than at more proximal sites. Occasionally the compression is lateral rather than dorsoventral and is not readily apparent on routine myelography.",

For this reason, the portal of entry is often difficult to identify. Puncture wounds of the hooves are common sites of entry in horses. Introduction to the genital tract at the time of parturition is the usual portal of entry in cattle. A high incidence of tetanus may occur in young pigs following castration and in lambs following castration, shearing, docking, vaccinations, or injections of pharmaceuticals, especially anthelmintics. Docking by the use of elastic band ligatures is reputed to be especially hazardous. Neonatal tetanus occurs when there is infection in the umbilical cord associated with unsanitary conditions at parturition. Cases of tetanus in ruminants after thermic dehorning and ear-tagging have been reported. 1 Outbreaks of \"idiopathic tetanus\" occur occasionally in young cattle without a wound being apparent, usually in association with the grazing of rough, fibrous feed, and it is probable that toxin is produced in wounds in the mouth or gastrointestinal tract or is ingested preformed in the feed. Proliferation in the rumen may also result in toxin production.",

Carrion includes domestic and wild animals and birds. In endemic botulism areas, the carcasses of dead animals are invaded by C. botulinum, and high concentrations of toxin are produced such that very small amounts of flesh or bone have lethal concentrations. Most outbreaks of carrionassociated botulism are associated with type C and D strains; these strains produce much higher concentrations of toxin in carrion than type A and B strains. Toxin can persist in carrion for at least 1 year. Where the carcasses of rodents, cats, and birds contaminate hay or silage, toxin can leach out and contaminate surrounding hay or other feeds to cause multiple cases of botulism. In one instance a single mouse carcass is thought to have contaminated 200,000 tons of alfalfa cubes. A common source in Australia is hay made at the time of a mouse plague. At such times even good, fresh hay can contain a great deal of carrion.

The interpretation of this result is complicated by the fact that the BoTN affecting this animal was BoTN type C, whereas the BoNT type E was isolated in milk. 1 Furthermore the toxin was retrieved in a mastitic quarter but not the remaining three clinically healthy quarters. It has therefore been suggested that the BoNT retrieved in this quarter was either produced locally or is the result of contamination. 1 Cows are relatively sensitive to BoTN, whereas the toxin is rarely detectable in the blood of clinical cases. The excretion of BoTN in relevant amounts through the mammary gland is therefore considered to be unlikely. Nonetheless because of the mentioned uncertainties the meat and milk from cattle that have botulism should not be used for human consumption.",

Detection of toxin using bioassay in mice where mice are inoculated intraperitoneally coupled with toxin neutralization with polyvalent antitoxin is considered the most sensitive test currently available. Nonetheless the rate of positivity in clinical cases particularly when testing serum is low, which has been explained by the much higher sensitivity to BoNT of cattle and horse compared with mice and the rapid binding of BoNT in the neuromuscular junctions, leaving low to no amounts of free BoNT in blood. Currently gastrointestinal content or fecal material is preferred over fecal material for the detection of BoNT. 5, 7 In outbreaks of botulism it is not uncommon to have only a proportion of clinically affected animals, or none, test positive. Protection with monovalent antitoxin allows type identification. Toxin detection by an ELISA test appears less sensitive than mouse bioassay. Toxin production or carrion contamination can potentially occur in a number of feeds; however, the majority of outbreaks are associated with contamination in hay or silage and suspect feeds should be tested in mice for toxin. To get around the problem of lack of sensitivity with the mouse test, suspect feed has been fed to experimental cattle. Alternatively, one can make an infusion of the feed sample and use this as the sole drinking water supply for experimental animals. The problem with all feeding experiments is that the BoTN is likely to be very patchy in its distribution in the feed.",

Clinically, there is an ascending, flaccid paralysis commencing with incoordination of the hindlimbs, followed by paralysis of the forelimbs and chest muscles, causing lateral recumbency. 1 Respiration is grossly abnormal; there is a double expiratory effort and the rate is slow (12-15 breaths per minute) but deep. Death, caused by respiratory failure, may occur in 1 to 2 days, but the course is usually 4 to 5 days. The mortality rate may be as high as 50% in dogs, but is usually much lower in farm animals. I. holocyclus have been shown to paralyze calves of 25 to 50 kg BW. Between 4 and 10 adult female ticks are required to produce this effect and paralysis occurs 6 to 13 days after infestation occurs. The ticks under natural conditions parasitize wild fauna, and infestations of other species occur accidentally. The disease is limited in its distribution by the ecology of the ticks and the natural host fauna. The paralysis characteristic of the disease is associated with a toxin secreted by the salivary glands of female ticks, which is present in much greater concentration in the glands of adults than in other stages. The severity of the paralysis is independent of the number of ticks involved; susceptible animals may be seriously affected by a few ticks. 1 Hyperimmune serum is used in the treatment of dogs, but in farm animals removal of the ticks in the early stages is usually followed by rapid recovery. Control necessitates eradication of the ticks or host fauna. The general principles of tick control are outlined in Chapter 11. The use of appropriate insecticides is an effective preventive.",

Topical administration of petroleum jelly or similar products can protect the skin of the perineum and escutcheon from fecal and urine scalding.",

The disease usually has a slow onset, but some affected horses developed severe signs with hours. 2 The median duration of clinical signs in affected horses that recover is 4.4 months (range 1-17 months) and survivors can recover completely.",

In cattle with spastic paresis, spinal cord neurons are thought to provide defective control to the \u03b3-motor neuron system, most likely by overstimulation or sufficient inhibition. During the normal stretch reflex the extrafusal skeletal muscle fibers are lengthened, stretching the muscle spindle. This stretch is detected and a signal sent via the afferent axon to the dorsal root. The signal is then sent directly to the \u03b1-motor neurons, resulting in muscle contraction. \u03b3-Motor neurons in the ventral spinal cord that are controlled by the central nervous system appear to inappropriately modulate the sensitivity of the stretch reflex system, resulting in sustained and excessive contraction.(Reproduced with permission from De Vlamynck C.

In acute lead poisoning, the common clinical findings are blindness, convulsions, champing of the jaws with the production of frothy saliva, and twitching of the eyelids and ears. In subacute lead poisoning in cattle there is blindness, stupor, head-pressing, grinding of the teeth, and almost no response to treatment. Rabid cattle are usually not blind, and signs of motor irritation such as convulsions and twitching of the facial muscles usually do not occur. However, there are signs of bizarre mental behavior, such as wild gazing, bellowing, yawning, attacking, and compulsive walking.\u2022 Lactation tetany occurs in lactating cattle on lush pasture in the spring during cold wet and windy weather, and is characterized by hyperesthesia, tremors, convulsions, recumbency, and rapid death. \u2022 Vitamin A deficiency occurs in groups of young cattle from 6 months to 18 months of age not receiving adequate carotene intake or vitamin A supplementation and is characterized by blindness in the ocular form and episodes of tremors and convulsions. \u2022 Polioencephalomalacia in cattle and sheep is characterized by blindness, nystagmus, opisthotonus, and convulsions; bellowing, loss of sensation, and tenesmus do not occur. \u2022 Listeriosis in cattle and sheep is manifested by localizing signs of circling and facial nerve paralysis. \u2022 Enterotoxemia in sheep is usually confined to lambs on heavy carbohydrate diets. \u2022 Pregnancy toxemia is a disease of pregnant ewes and is readily differentiated by the presence of ketonuria. \u2022 Louping-ill in sheep is transmitted by insects, has a seasonal occurrence, and a localized geographic distribution.",

Birds and insects also serve as transport hosts. Sporocysts ingested by the intermediate host undergo schizogony and ultimately form infective sarcocysts in muscle.

The definitive and intermediate hosts of N. hughesi have not been determined. Dogs are the definitive host of the closely related N. caninum.

The sciatic nerve has been most commonly affected in cattle because historically most intramuscular injections were given deep in the hamstring muscles. Young calves were particularly susceptible because of their small muscle masses. Current recommendations in cattle are that intramuscular injections should be administered cranial to the shoulder.Femoral nerve paralysis in calves occurs in large calves born to heifers with dystocia. The injury occurs when calves in anterior presentation fail to enter the birth canal because their stifle joints become engaged at the brim of the pelvis. Traction used to deliver these calves causes hyperextension of the femur and stretching of the quadriceps muscle and its neural and vascular supplies. In most cases the right femoral nerve is affected. Such calves are unable to bear weight on the affected leg within days after birth, the quadriceps muscle is atrophied, and the patella can be luxated easily. The patellar reflex is absent or markedly reduced in the affected limb because this reflex requires an intact femoral nerve and functional quadriceps muscle. Varying degrees of rear limb paresis result, accompanied by varying degrees of hindlimb gait abnormality. Skin analgesia maybe present over the proximal lateral to cranial to medial aspect of the tibia. At rest, the affected leg is slightly flexed and the hip on the affected side is held slightly lower. During walking, the animal has difficulty in advancing the limb normally because the limb collapses when weight bearing. In severe cases of muscle atrophy, the patella is easily luxated both medially and laterally. Injury to the femoral nerve is relatively easy to clinically identify, and there is usually no need to perform EMG studies of atrophied quadriceps muscle to document denervation.Calving paralysis is common in heifers that have experienced a difficult calving. Affected animals are unable to stand without assistance; if they do stand, the hindlimbs are weak and there is marked abduction and inability to adduct. It has always been erroneously thought that traumatic injury of the obturator nerves during passage of the calf in the pelvic cavity was the cause of the paresis; however, detailed pathologic and experimental studies have demonstrated that most calving paresis/paralysis is caused by damage to the sciatic nerve. Experimental transection of the obturator nerves does not result in paresis. The term obturator nerve paralysis should only be used for postparturient cattle with an inability to adduct one or both hindlimbs, and calving paralysis in the preferred descriptive term for hindlimb paresis/ paralysis occurring in the immediate postparturient period.Damage to the sciatic nerve results in rear limb weakness and knuckling of the fetlocks; the latter clinical sign is an important means for differentiating sciatic nerve damage from obturator nerve damage (Fig. 14-25) . The patellar reflex in ruminants with sciatic nerve damage is normal or increased, because the reflex contraction of the quadriceps muscle group by the femoral nerve is unopposed by the muscles of the hindlimb innervated by the sciatic nerve.The peroneal nerve is most frequently damaged by local trauma to the lateral stifle where the peroneal nerve runs in a superficial location lateral to the head of the fibular bone. Damage to the peroneal nerve leads to knuckling over of the fetlock joint from damage to the extensor muscles of the distal limb, resulting in the dorsal aspect of the hoof resting on the ground when the animal is standing. Full weight can be borne on the",
