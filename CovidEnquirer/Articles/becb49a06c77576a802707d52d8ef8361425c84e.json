No specific drug is currently available for the effective treatment of CSFV infection. RNA interference (RNAi) technology depends on effective delivery systems, for which several effective vectors have recently been developed. Three retroviral plasmids containing siRNA genes targeting different regions of N pro and NS4A have been constructed, and 3 replication-incompetent retroviral vectors have been produced in the human embryo kidney cell line GP2-293 by retroviral plasmid transfection. PK-15 cells were then infected with these replication-incompetent retroviral vectors and screened for siRNA stably expressing PK-15 cell clones. Growth of CSFV in such siRNA stably expressing cell clones resulted in a 186-fold reduction in viral genome copies and, at 72 h post-infection, only a small % of cells showed infection by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, and effective inhibition of virus replication persisted for up to 120 h. Retroviral vector-mediated RNAi can therefore be used to study the specific function of viral genes associated with CSFV replication and may have potential therapeutic application.",

CSF causes great economic losses in the pig industry worldwide, particularly in Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe. The disease was first recognized in China in the 1920s and there continue to be major epizootics in China Zhu et al., 2009) . CSFV belongs to the genus Pestivirus of the family Flaviviridae. Its genome consists of a singlestranded (+) sense RNA of about 12.5 kb with a single large open reading frame (ORF), encoding a polyprotein (Meyers et al., 1989) . After translation, the polyprotein is cleaved into viral structural and non-structural peptides which are, from N-to C-terminus, N pro -C-E ms -E1-E2-P7-NS2-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5A-NS5B (Meyers et al., 1989; Elbers et al., 1996; Ruggli et al., 1996; Tautz et al., 1997) . N pro is an atypical cysteine protease with an autoproteolytic activity that cleaves the viral polyprotein via cis hydrolysis, generating the Nterminus of the capsid protein C (Rumenapf et al., 1998) . N pro is also essential for evading the cellular antiviral defense system, and protects cells from double-stranded RNA-induced apoptosis (Ruggli et al., 2005) . NS4A is an indispensable cofactor of uncleaved NS2-3 in the formation of infectious particles, with the N-terminus of NS3 providing serine protease activity (Moulin et al., 2007) .",

First, cells can be transfected with chemically synthesized siRNAs or in vitro-transcribed siRNAs (Elbashir et al., 2001; Xu et al., 2008) . This can achieve effective and very rapid silencing of a target gene, although limited to cells that can be transfected at high rates and the effects are transient. To circumvent the latter problem, so-called short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) can be expressed from stably transfected plasmids (Kapadia et al., 2003) . Like miRNA precursors, shRNAs form hairpin structures, which are cleaved by Dicer to produce siRNAs. However, the generation of shRNA-expressing cell lines are time-consuming. An alternative way to achieve stable integration of shRNA expression cassettes into the genome of cells is delivery via retroviruses (Schuck et al., 2004) . Their production is fast and simple. If expression of shRNAs is combined with expression of a selectable marker, populations in which every cell contains at least one active copy of the retroviral genome can readily be obtained. This study has demonstrated the use of retroviral vector-based RNAi against CSFV, a major pathogen of pigs. Three different siRNA gene constructs, delivered via a replicationcompetent retroviral vector, successfully reduced viral replication using targets in viral genes N pro and NS4A, two key genes involved in CSFV replication. The results showed that these siRNAs were stably integrated into, and expressed in PK-15 cells and were capable of significantly inhibiting viral genomic RNA replication.",

            "text": "The CSFV genome contains a single large ORF encoding a polyprotein (Meyers et al., 1989) . Since N pro is the ultimate Nterminal protease involved in the polyprotein processing, the binding of siRNA to N pro mRNA likely interfered with the translation and the subsequent processing of the viral polyprotein, thereby resulting in significant inhibition of the viral replication. Moreover, there are studies showing that it is essential that the sequence downstream of the internal ribosome entry site within the starting region of CSFV mRNA should be single-stranded for high efficiency translation (Ruggli et al., 1996; Wilson et al., 2003) . Consequently, since this part of the N pro mRNA may not form a secondary structure, it is likely to be highly accessible to siRNA (Kretschmer-Kazemi Far and Sczakiel, 2003) . NS4A is an indispensable cofactor of uncleaved NS2-3 in the formation of infectious particles, with the N-terminus of NS3 having serine protease activity (Moulin et al., 2007) . That uncleaved NS2-3 recruited for virion assembly does not require the enzymatic activity of NS3 essential for RNA replication further supports the hypothesis that NS2-3 and NS3, each in association with NS4A, have independent functions in the CSFV life cycle. Based on this knowledge, satisfactory RNA interference results were obtained by siRNAs generated against both key genes, although no research studying the effect of RNAi on the NS4A gene has been done before.",

Standard molecular cloning techniques were employed for the construction and generation of 3 different siRNA retroviruses, corresponding to different regions of the CSFV genome: N pro and NS4A. The retroviruses infected PK-15 cells, and expression of siRNAs was combined with expression of a selectable marker. SiRNA stably expressing cell clones were obtained in which every cell clone contained at least one active copy of siRNA. Knowledge of the kinetics of CSFV replication in cultured cells is critical for determination of the sampling points for estimation of siRNA effect in cells. Hence, the replication kinetics of CSFV strain Shimen in PK-15 cells was studied by IFA and TCID 50 assay prior to siRNA transfection, with results showing that the proliferation of virus peaked at 48-72 h post-infection (Xu et al., 2008) . Based on this consideration, viral growth in siRNA stable expression cells was determined after 48 h post-infection.",

As shown in Fig. 3 , significant elevations in virus titers seen at 120 h post-infection of siRNA stably expressing cells indicates that the effects of these siRNAs diminished after 96 h post-infection. Only a few cells were infected in siRNA stably expressing cells at 72 h post-infection, and at 120 h exhibited 45% fluorescence in siN2 stably expressing cells. When siRNA-expressing cells with CSFV infection were passaged at 72 h post-infection, almost all cells were infected at the second passage (data not shown). In order to study further the siRNA effect, the replication kinetics of CSFV was studied by real-time RT-PCR, and results showed that there was effective inhibition of virus replication. The RT-PCR used in this study showed that specific siRNAs were detected easily in siRNA stably expressing cells, suggesting efficiency and specificity of siRNA expression in siRNA stably expressing cells. For siS11, there was no detection of expression, yet it displayed a significant inhibition although it was not as efficient as siN1 or siN2. Considering that siS11 was below detection level, one could argue that the siS11 construct may be actually more effective than the two siN constructs.",

The overall interspecies sequence identity within the genus is less than 70%, and sequence identity within a species varies from 75% to 100%. This genetic variety makes it impossible to design a siRNA able to cross-inhibit 3 species and very difficult to design one able to inhibit all isolates within the species. In order to evaluate the cross-inhibitory capabilities of our siRNAs, multiple alignments of N pro and NS4A sequences of CSFV strains were conducted based on their availability in GenBank. Results showed that siN1, siN2 and siS11 could cover 71% (20/28), 60% (17/28) and 79% (22/28) of CSFV strains, respectively (data not shown), indicating that additional efforts should be undertaken to screen siRNAs with the widest cross-inhibitory effects on a range of CSFV strains.",

Some studies so far have clearly shown a prolonged inhibition by siRNA; for example, retroviral mediated suppression of HIV transcription by a single siRNA has been observed for 1 year in a susceptible HeLa cell line (Yamagishi et al., 2009) . This study has demonstrated that retroviral vector-mediated RNAi has potential for the treatment of CSFV infection. This method may not inhibit completely viral growth, but it merits further animal study to define its real therapeutic potential, and a replication-competent retroviral vector with siRNA in its genome can be used directly for treatment. Additionally, the combined use of different siRNAs might improve further the effect, and the siRNAs might be delivered to animals via transgenics (McGrew et al., 2004) , or as a part of a vaccine potentially to create virus-resistant animal populations. The effect of siRNA can be combined use of different replication-competent retroviral vectors with siRNAs, and by repeated application. This concept might help reduce viral transmission during the immunity gap between vaccination and the onset of protection, thereby gaining precious time for bringing outbreaks under control.",
