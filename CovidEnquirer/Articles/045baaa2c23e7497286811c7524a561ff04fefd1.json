While it is impossible to disprove the role of luck in growth, we argue that luck is endogenous, and good luck is a function of good policy. Luck favours those who strive. Again contrary to common belief, we show that resurgent Asian economies have endured more, not less, than their fair share of economic volatility. They learned their lessons by success and failures, and luck is endogenous through learning-by-investing.",

            "text": "In the new millennium, our picture of world economic development is filled with hope and despair. On the one hand, real per capita income in the Western developed world has increased faster during the past 50 years than ever before. On the other hand, income distribution across nations is worsening at an alarming rate. Uneven development is entrenched, the gulf between rich and poor countries is widening, and rampant poverty continues to haunt millions of people in Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America. 1 Also in the past 50 years, four Asian Newly Industrialised Economies-Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore (NIEs for short)-have caught the imagination of the world. Taken together, the NIEs have grown at an average rate of 7.9% per year from 1960 to 2000, roughly three times the world average. 2 At constant 1995 US$ terms, the NIEs' Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased by a staggering 20 times from 1960 to 2000. Singapore, for instance, within a single generation raised her per real capita GDP from 20% of that of the United States of America in 1960 to 88% in 2000. The NIEs have presented the world with great hopes and, by the same token, an intellectual puzzle: How did they do it? The NIEs' growth experience has often been referred to as a \"miracle.\" Can poor nations replicate their economic \"miracle?\" If yes, then how? 3 In life, there are three basic ingredients to good fortune: wisdom, hard work, and luck. Luck is important because we live in a world of chance. More precisely, luck can be defined as an unknown and unpredictable phenomenon that causes an event to result one way rather than another. Luck can be good or bad, but either way it is characterised by an enigmatic and unknowable volatility.",

            "text": "In this regard, two recent papers raise the question of how luck may affect economic development. One is Acemoglu and Zilibotti (1997) , which argues that \"At the early stages of development, the presence of indivisible projects limits the degree of risk spreading (diversification) that the economy can achieve. [. . . ] 'Lucky' countries will spend relatively less time in the primitive accumulation stage and develop faster\" (p. 709, italics added). Indivisibility is certainly a problem for small countries, and each of the four NIEs is small. Singapore, for instance, is a small city state that deals with indivisibility by targeted-investment policies. Largely as a result of her government's economic development policy, 42.1% of her total manufacturing output in 2002 came from a single sector of electronic products and components, even though this proportion had fallen from 48.9% in 1 See Maddison (2001) , p. 17. 2 Data from World Bank's World Development Indicator CD-Rom (2002) and from Taiwan Statistical Yearbook (various years). 3 The total factor productivity debate may be intellectually satisfying, but poor countries in the world are primarily interested in how the NIEs did it, not whether it was a \"miracle\" or not. Even if Singapore had \"bought\" her success with high saving rates, to many poor nations that surely is a price worth paying for the resulting vast improvement in living standard. It is in this spirit when Stiglitz recently wrote that \"the total factor productivity debate is much ado about nothing\" (2001, p. 512). 1997. Similar stories can be told of Taiwan's targeting basic industries such as glass, plastics, steel and cement (see Wade, 1990, p. 78) , and of Korea's targeting shipbuilding, cement, and steel (see Amsden, 1990 and Jones & Sekong, 1980) . Applying Acemoglu and Zilibotti's hypothesis that \"chance will always play a key role in his [Prometheus'] unchaining\" (p. 711), these NIEs must have hit the jackpot by choosing the growth industries. These Asian countries could, according to the Acemoglu-Zilibotti hypothesis, easily have betted on the wrong horse. They have been lucky; things could have been much worse.",

They conclude that \". . . luck is important relative to policies in determining the long-run path of output\" (1993, p. 476) . Not only do Easterly and his co-authors assert that luck is important, but that growth policy is not. Thus they write, \"The finding that much variation in growth rates is due to random shocks should induce caution in attributing high growth rates to good policy (or to a good 'work ethic'). Just as a baseball star is dubbed a clutch hitter after a lucky hit, some so-called economic miracles are likely due to random variation\" (1993, p. 481, italics added) . The \"miracles\" they refer to are the four high-flying Asian NIEs, which Easterly in another paper predicts \"should be heading back toward earth soon\" (1995, p. 283) . Sure enough, merely two years after Easterly wrote this, all four NIEs headed \"back toward earth\" in the form of the 1997 Asian financial crisis. They did not stay on earth for very long though, and they quickly rebounded to above-average growth rates until, in 2003, another shock hit them (except Korea) in the form of a deadly virus called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The Asian NIEs have been lucky, but perhaps their luck is finally running out.",

Consequently, we have to be careful in order not to reduce our enquiry to a state of quagmire. Luck is often associated with fate, even superstition; a student may think that he did well in an examination paper because he wore his \"lucky T-shirt\" that day. Such prosaicism must be excluded from our discussion. Furthermore, any theory based on luck is intellectually distasteful since it can never be falsified. For instance, we can never disprove that the student's T-shirt brought him \"luck\" that day. By the same token, we can never disprove that Asian NIEs' growth performance was due to \"luck\" at least in some ways. Even though a luck-theory, by its incapacity of being falsified falls within the Popperian realm of \"non-science,\" it is still enlightening, meaningful, and indeed crucial to consider how it may help us to understand growth. Luck is by definition unknowable. However, we could find out how luck evolves amid economic volatility, and thence infer the role of good luck and good policy in (NIEs) growth. After all, the history of human civilization is the history of knowing the unknown and of reducing our realm of ignorance, much of which we unwittingly assign to luck.",

The question, \"What has luck got to do with growth?\" is, for poor countries yearning for economic progress, too important to be ignored. As the only star performers for almost a half century, the NIEs have carried the hopes of many poor nations in the world. China, India, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam and a host of Asian countries have begun lately to emulate the four NIEs with various degrees of success. \"How to make a miracle\" 4 is without doubt the most encapsulating question today, but much hope will sadly be dashed if the NIE miracles are merely freak results from a lucky draw. If the NIE's growth really were freak results from a lucky draw, then poor countries should forget about learning from the Asian examples, but instead try to improve their fortune through other means.",

As explained earlier, disproving the luck-hypothesis is an impossible mission; this is not the purpose of this paper. Our aim is instead twofold. First, we need to dispel the widespread misconception that the Asian NIEs have had a smooth ride all the way. The fact is the contrary-they have had to endure more than their fair share of volatility along their growth path. Second, we argue (in Section 4) that even luck is endogenous. Luck always favours those who work hard, not as an article of faith, but as a consequence of learning-by-doing and learning-by-investing. The Asian NIE's high degree of volatility was a consequence of their intensive investment policy (see Section 3); their luck and fortune are spin-offs from their toil and dexterity. Our recommendation to poor countries is to formulate good investment and growth policies now, as luck will take the side of those who strive.",

Such approbation is not justified. Although Asian NIEs did not have a major crisis before 1997, they had to ride through storms and turbulence more severe than other countries at comparable levels of economic development. The purpose of establishing NIE's high degree of volatility is not to show that they had been unlucky, but rather to show that their economic \"miracle\" is a history of struggle, hard work, and learning-by-investing.

These countries are poor, slow-growing (some have negative growth rates), and technologically backward. Many of them rely heavily on agricultural products which have low supply elasticity; agricultural supplies are subject to wide fluctuations because of floods, droughts and other natural disasters. In manufacturing, poor-country workers are unskilled and produce labor intensive, technologically well-diffused commodities. Widely available substitutes and intense competition increase demand elasticities for their outputs. The combination of a flat demand curve and a steep supply which shifts easily leads to large swings of sales revenue. The more backward a country is, the more volatility she will face. Next we consider the Asian NIEs, which are distinguished by fast growth and intensive investment. In addition, these nations are small in size. As we mentioned earlier, they are restricted by investment indivisibilities and had resorted to industrial targeting policies in order to exploit economies of scale. Even though such gambles have paid off in the long run, targeting large-scale investments restricted their economic profile to a limited number of sectors. Being small in size, Asian NIEs are driven to rely on export markets located in advanced countries. Even though they are catching up with advanced technology, their production remains labor-intensive, and their technology diffused compared to the advanced OECD countries. Like the poor countries, the NIEs face highly elastic demand curves. But unlike the poor countries, the NIE's volatility stems mainly from shifts in demand. Despite their differences, both the stagnant, less-developed countries and the progressive, Asian NIEs have high volatility.",

Their modest investment means that they take less risk, and that they can hedge their investment better than the Asian NIEs. Their high-technology outputs have fewer competitors, greater market power, and less elastic demand curves than the NIEs'. Furthermore, the supply curves of such high-tech outputs do not fluctuate as much as the poor countries' agricultural output, and the demand curves of high-tech commodities do not shift as much as the NIEs' because of their market power.

In this section, we will give reasons to contend that luck has a habit of favouring those who strive and persevere.

The history of human civilization and industrialisation can be seen as an endless endeavor to reduce our ignorance. This history is one of learning. As we strive, we experiment, make mistakes, learn and sharpen our skills. When we encounter similar circumstances, our performance improves because of what we learned before.",

The difficulty facing poor countries is that they lack investment experience; the irreversibility deters investment decisions since committing to an inferior investment option today means missed opportunities tomorrow. Bernanke (1983) also constructs a formal model to show that there is an option value to waiting, and he concludes, \". . . in early stages of the learning process, waiting for information is a valuable activity, and investment tends to be deferred\" (p. 95).

For any start-up investor the first investment project is inevitably difficult. The second project benefits from the experience of the first, and subsequent decisions are made more accurately and with more conviction as the investor gains from learning-by-investing. Thus, Bernanke continues, \"As knowledge accumulates and priors concentrate, the propensity to invest increases\" (1983, p. 95) . For all less-developed countries, the take-off is the most important and the most difficult part of their industrialisation. Making the second million dollars is usually easier than making the first million, not so much because luck favours those who have made the first million, but rather because past experience improves the odds of success in future endeavors.",

The lesson for the poor, undeveloped nations is that the path to growth is bound to be a bumpy ride, but the going can only get better because of learning-by-investing in addition to learning-by-doing. Precisely because the beginning is the most difficult, the time to start learning is now. The harder one works, the faster one learns.

In Section 2 we corrected the common misconception that Asian NIEs have maintained high-speed growth with little volatility. We showed, on the contrary, that NIEs have endured more volatility than the advanced OECD countries. Such volatility is, in addition, a necessary part of their learning experience. Small country-size and investment indivisibility led Asian NIEs to targeted investment policies, which brought fast growth as well as a high degree of fluctuations. It is precisely from such business ups and downs that these nations learn to sharpen their investment skills; economic growth is not only a process of learning-by-doing, it is also one of learning-by-investing.",
