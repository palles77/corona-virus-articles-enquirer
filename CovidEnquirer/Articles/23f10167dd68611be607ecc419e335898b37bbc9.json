However, neither of these hypotheses accounts for the age-distribution of severe cases and deaths, or for the geographic and other variations in rates and explosiveness of mortality during the Pandemic. It will be shown here that, alternatively, the epidemiology of the influenza lethality could be completely explained by a combination of two determinants: (1) acquired immune-differentiation of birth-cohorts, within populations, through developmental epigenetic adaptation (and selection) secondary to maternal or early-life episodes of influenza infection and (2) a triggering context -emergence of a new sub-type/strain, and its co-circulation (competition?) with seasonal viruses immunologically related to ones that had circulated in the past and primed particular population birth-cohorts. This article (1) presents age, geographic, and temporal variations in 1918-1919 and 2009 influenza severity, (2) presents and discusses ecologic evidence in favor of the hypothesis to influenza lethality advanced here, (3) suggests biologic mechanisms capable of explaining it, (4) retrospectively, proposes co-circulation between the Pandemic and a 1918 seasonal (H3?) influenza virus as the context for the increased lethality during the second wave of the 1918 Pandemic, and (5) predicts an increase in influenza severity in the northern hemisphere as the 2009-2010 season advances and H3 circulation increases.",

However, neither of these hypotheses accounts for the age-distribution of severe cases and deaths or for the geographic and other variations in rates and explosiveness of mortality during the Pandemic. According to Frost [3] , epidemiologically, the overall mortality in 1918-1919 would be fully explained not by the incidence of influenza infection, but by the incidence of severe pneumonia cases. Therefore an alternative hypotheses to the severity of influenza cases will be addressed here that departs exactly from the epidemiology (time, person, and place) of the influenza mortality.",

            "text": "As a general idea, it is proposed that early-life infection by contemporary circulating influenza viruses results, at the population level, in an acquired immune differentiation of successive birthcohorts, both by adaptive epigenetic transformations capable of fitting fetal development to a new environmental condition (maternal infection and immune response), and by elimination of those genotypes unable to adapt. (For gene-environmental interactions, see Levins-Lewontin, 1996 [9] , and Schmalhausen, 1949 [10] ). Immune responses to different influenza sub-types would be less adaptive than to the subtype that originally primed each individual. An extensive literature exists on a phenomenon called influenza ''original antigenic sin\", described by Davenport [11] as follows: ''It is now recognized that the major antigens of the strains of first infection of childhood permanently orient the antibodyforming mechanisms so that, on subsequent exposure to related variants of influenza virus, the cohort of the population would respond with marked reinforcement of the primary antibody\" ( [11] , p. 453). Thus, it would be expected that (1) individuals originally primed by different types/sub-types of influenza viruses responded differently to ulterior influenza challenges and (2) due to the changing prevalence of influenza types/sub-types over time, individuals' priming would emerge, at the population level, as birthcohort variation in vulnerability to influenza re-infections [12] .",

            "text": "The 1918-1919 Pandemic is usually described as a succession of three waves, the first one, mild, occurring in March-April-May in the US and reaching England in June-July [13] , the second and most severe initiating in August 1918 and growing globally in September-October-November of 1918 [13, 14] , responsible for most of the deaths associated to the Pandemic, and a third wave early in 1919, more severe than the first but lighter than the second regarding mortality [13, 14] . The main characteristic of the 1918 influenza pandemic, besides its enormous mortality toll, was the unusual age distribution of the influenza deaths. While the incidence of respiratory illness was highest in children under 10 years of age, dropping towards ages 15-24, rising to a second small peak at ages 25-40 and then declining as individuals aged, mortality from influenza and pneumonia was exceptionally concentrated in young adults [3, 13, 14] . Cases-fatality in 1918-1919 was higher among the military compared to the civilian population [14] . Other unexplained feature of the 1918-1919 Pandemic was the influenza-excess mortality variation across and within countries [14, 15] . Among 40 US cities, Pearl [15] observed that ''there [was] an extraordinary amount of difference between different cities in respect of the force with which they were struck by the epidemic ( [15] p.1745)\". The differences could not be accounted for by demographic factors, density of population, geographic position or recent growth of the population. The only factor that was shown to be correlated with the explosiveness of the outbreaks was the usual mortality level prevailing in the cities. Cities with relatively high normal death rates, and particularly ones associated with pulmonary tuberculosis, organic heart diseases and chronic nephritis and Bright's diseases, had also a relatively severe and explosive mortality from the influenza epidemic ( [15] , p. 1781).",

Routine notification and testing of community cases was interrupted in week 27, when sustained local transmission of infection had been established. From then on, only severe acute respiratory syndrome cases were notified. The number of weekly notifications increased to about 1000 weekly suspected cases in weeks 30 and 31, and then rapidly declined to 136 suspected cases in week 35. Laboratory tests did not keep up with the increase in number of cases. But up until week 30, from 1466 available results, 59% were positive for the new A/ H1N1 virus and 14.3%, positive for influenza A seasonal viruses, odds of 4:1. Up to week 35, the 4458 reported cases had resulted in 327 deaths. While cases concentrated around ages 20-29, deaths predominated at ages 30-59. Significant variations occurred in the geographic distribution of cases and deaths within the State, with areas heavily hit and others completely spared from severe disease and deaths [6] . Variation in mortality across different countries were also significant until September of 2009, with higher rates occurring in Mexico, Argentina, Uruguay, and Rio Grande do Sul/ Brazil than in the United States and European Countries [18] .",

In 2009, the levels of circulation influenza viruses in the US in the summer was unusually high, but 99% of the identified viruses belonged to the H1N1 pandemic strain [20] . In Rio Grande do Sul, in the winter, the new H1N1 co-circulated with seasonal viruses in a proportion 4:1 [6] . Co-circulation of new and seasonal influenza viruses were also documented in Mexico. On May 15, answering a question about the possibility of a new, more pathogenic variant of the H1N1 virus to be circulating in some areas of Mexico, Celia Alpuche, head of the Instituto de Diagn\u00f3stico y Referencia Epidemiol\u00f3gicos (InDRE) in Mexico City told ScienceInsider: ''We have seen influenza seasonal strains circulating even more than swine-origin A (H1N1) virus, in particular in areas in Mexico such as Durango, Jalisco, and Zacatecas.

Serological studies done in the 1950s-1960s in the US and in Europe [11, 28] found anti-H2 and anti-H3 influenza antibodies mostly among individuals born until around the turn to the 20th Century, but low levels of H3 antibodies were identified in cohorts born until about 1918 [11] and even 1936 [28] , in samples collected before the 1968 Pandemic. Thus, co-circulation of different sub-types of influenza viruses, like happened after 1978, probably occurred also during the beginning of the 20th Century. The much higher level of mortality in 1918 was most likely associated with the very high level of influenza activity documented in the United States [22] and in Great Britain [13] from 1888-1890 to the mid-30s.",
