However, there is a lack of a method to simultaneously detect and distinguish PEDV and TGEV in preclinical levels. In this study, we aimed to establish a dual ultrasensitive nanoparticle DNA probe-based PCR assay (dual UNDP-PCR) based on functionalized magnetic bead enrichment and specific nano-technology amplification for simultaneous detection and distinguish diagnosis of PEDV and TGEV. The detection limit of dual UNDP-PCR for single or multiple infections of PEDV and TGEV is 25 copies/g, which is 400 times more sensitive than the currently known duplex RT-PCR, showing better specificity and sensitivity without cross-reaction with other viruses. For pre-clinical fecal samples, the dual UNDP-PCR showed a markedly higher positive detection rate (52.08%) than conventional duplex RT-PCR (13.21%), can rapidly and accurately identify targeted pathogens whenever simple virus infection or co-infection. In summary, this study provides a technique for detecting and distinguishing PEDV and TGEV in preclinical levels, which is high sensitivity, specificity, repeatability, low cost and broad application prospect.",

Among them, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) are the main pathogens causing viral diarrhea in piglets. TGEV and PEDV, as the main members of the coronavirus family, can cause highly contagious intestinal infections in piglets [1] . Because transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) and porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) show great similarities in clinical symptoms, pathological changes and epidemiology, therefore, it is difficult to diagnose and distinguish one from another only depending on clinical features and histopathology. If there is not a timely method to control their infection, TGEV and PEDV will spread rapidly across the whole swine farm. At present, the prevention and control of TGE and PED are mainly carried out from two aspects: vaccination and purification of the farm environment. Among them, early detection is the key to decontamination of the farm. Therefore, to establish a pre-clinical laboratory detection technology with high sensitivity and specificity for these two pathogens is urgently needed, which will be of great significance for the pre-clinical diagnosis to purify the environment as soon as possible, preventing large-scale infection and reducing economic losses.",

However, the method of isolation and identification of viruses has a long period of time and the process is cumbersome, the serological assays have low detection sensitivity and cannot be early warning, the cost of immunological methods is high, the detection range is limited, and the application range is not extensive. In addition, the molecular biology methods such as duplex RT-PCR are inconvenient to operate and costly, which required the process of viral nucleic acid extraction, purification and reverse transcription. Therefore, it is an urgent need to develop new detection methods with the characteristics of high sensitivity, high specificity and low cost [9e11]. In this study, dual ultrasensitive nanoparticle DNA probe-based PCR (dual UNDP-PCR) assay for both PEDV and TGEV uses magnetic beads and gold nanoparticles to improve the detection sensitivity, and uses specific probes and labels to reduce the probability of false positives; meanwhile, the whole operation does not require reverse transcription and professional research personnel, which save the detection cost.",

As shown in Fig. 1A , visible targeted bands around 628 bp and 501 bp could be seen in lanes representing fecal samples with viral concentrations ranging from 10 3 copies/g to 25 copies/g respectively. However, at least 10 4 copies/g of TGEV and PEDV in samples, visible targeted bands around 451 bp and 275 bp could be seen in lanes when detected by conventional duplex RT-PCR assay (Fig. 1B) , suggesting that the sensitivity of dual UNDP-PCR specific for PEDV and TGEV was 400fold that of the conventional duplex RT-PCR.",

The results of the independent triplicates assay showed highly consistency as our expected. (Fig. 2A) . The specificity of the dual UNDP-PCR assay for PEDV and TGEV was measured by fecal samples collected from healthy pigs and others infected with PPV, PRV, CSFV, PCV2 or PRRSV. As our predicted, specific PCR products with bands of 628 bp and 501 bp were detected in the sample with PEDV and TGEV whenever other viruses exist or non-exist. As shown in Fig. 2B , the result demonstrated that the detection results of TGEV and PEDV do not interfere with each other and were not disturbed by other viruses, revealing the specificity and independence of the established dual UNDP-PCR for PEDV and TGEV.",

As shown in Table 1 , using conventional duplex RT-PCR detection found 53 positive samples and 219 negative samples, while using dual UNDP-PCR assay detection found 96 positive samples and 176 negative samples among 272 samples; the detection positive rate of dual UNDP-PCR assay (35.29%) is markedly higher than that of conventional duplex RT-PCR (19.49%). We found 46 fecal sample were collected from the piglets with clinical diarrhea symptoms in all of 53 positive samples detected by conventional duplex RT-PCR, while 50 fecal sample were collected from the piglets without apparent clinical symptoms in all of 96 positive samples detected by dual UNDP-PCR assay. Notably, all of 53 positive samples detected by conventional duplex RT-PCR were also positive in dual UNDP-PCR assay, and TGEV positive rate (9.43%), PEDV positive rate (56.61%) and double positive rate of co-infection (33.96) were completely identity when these 53 positive samples were detected by dual UNDP-PCR assay and conventional duplex RT-PCR (Table S3 ). These results suggested that dual UNDP-PCR assay not only possesses great diagnostic accuracy as well as conventional duplex RT-PCR, but showed a higher positive detection rate than conventional duplex RT-PCR. For 43 positive samples, 3 samples were TGEV positive, 27 samples were PEDV positive, 13 samples were double positive, which were further confirmed by the amplification of isolated pathogens. These data further show the higher sensitivity of dual UNDP-PCR assay, and demonstrate that dual UNDP-PCR assay can rapidly and accurately identify targeted pathogens from preclinical samples whenever single virus infection or co-infection.",

In addition, traditional RT-PCR methods can not detect the presence of low-concentration viruses in the early stages of infection. Therefore, the virus infection could not be discovered in time, and the virus began to spread rapidly throughout the piggery, causing serious harm to the pig industry. With the development of nanotechnology, nanoparticles have been widely used in pathogen detection. In this study, based on nanoparticle and DNA tags, we established a dual UNDP-PCR technology to simultaneously detect and distinguish TGEV and PEDV in the same system. This combined method not only greatly shortens the detection time and reduces the detection cost, but also show reliable reproducibility, specificity and higher sensitivity than the conventional duplex RT-PCR.",

Secondly, compared with the duplex RT-PCR technology, real-time RT-PCR and other molecular biology methods, dual UNDP-PCR saves detection time and testing costs by eliminating the need for process of viral nucleic acid extraction, purification and reverse transcription. Thirdly, based on the two kinds of special gold nanoparticles and functionalized magnetic beads, dual UNDP-PCR allows simultaneous preclinical testing of TGEV and PEDV in low-dose viral stool samples and distinguishes each other in one test, which is more convenient and quick than the single UNDP-PCR assay established previously. In addition, the experimental results show that the method can detect 25 copies/g of TGEV and PEDV with 400 times the sensitivity of traditional duplex RT-PCR. Finally, in terms of its specificity, specific nucleic acid probes for labeling magnetic particles and DNA labels for modifying nano-gold particles are two completely different specific sequences designed based on the conserved region of the viral gene, and by evaluating their ability to capture viral nucleic acids optimized screening for specificity. In the clinical sample application, the detection technology established in this study can easily identify whether it is pure PEDV or TGEV infection or mixed infection, which provides a basis for clinical medication and early control of infection to reduce the economic loss of pig farms.",
