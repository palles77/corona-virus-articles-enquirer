In the present study, various influenza H1, H3, H5, and H9 hemagglutinin (HA) proteins were expressed in insect cells, and then mice were subcutaneously immunized with the expressed HA proteins, and challenged by influenza A viruses (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) or A/chicken/Guangdong/96 (H9N2)). The results first showed that wild-type H3 hemagglutinin (HA) (H3-WT), but not a transmembrane domain (TM) mutant, had hetero-protection against both H1N1 and H9N2 with survival rates of 17% and 33% respectively, and that wild-type H1 (H1-WT), H5 (H5-WT) and H9 (H9-WT) had no hetero-protection against H1N1 or H9N2 except for H5-WT against H1N1 with a survival rate of 17%. Then the H3-WT TM replaced the TMs of H1-WT, H5-WT and H9-WT to generate recombinant H1-TM, H5-TM and H9-TM respectively, and whether the H3-WT TM-dependent heteroprotection could be transferred to these TM mutants was investigated. The results showed that the H3-WT TM-dependent hetero-protection was transferable. H1-TM against H9N2 and H9-TM against H1N1 were with survival rates of 33% and 17% respectively, and H5-TM against both H1N1 and H9N2 with survival rates of 50% and 17% respectively. Furthermore, higher dosage H5-TM scored 100% hetero-protection against H1N1. These results demonstrated that replacement of the TMs of non-H3 HAs with H3-WT TM could enhance their hetero-protection. These findings would help the development of future influenza vaccines against pandemics such as the recently appeared H7N9 infection.",

They are classified into subtypes based on the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) expressed on viral surfaces [2] . The recent discoveries of H17N10 and H18N11 subtypes in bat have expanded the influenza A viruses into 18 HA subtypes [8, 9] . HA is the main surface antigen and responsible for virus entry and fusion activity [6, 7] . The accumulation of point mutations within the antibody-binding sites of HA is called antigenic drift causing annual epidemics, and the introduction of a HA na\u00efve to humans by a reassortant virus is referred as antigenic shift associated with irregular pandemics [2] . The recent emergence of avian influenza H7N9 in China is a vivid reminder that the danger of influenza pandemics is still imminent [1, 5] .",

The inactivated virus vaccine was first introduced more than 60 years ago. Current QIV vaccine consists of a H1N1 strain, a H3N2 strain, B Yamagata, and B Victoria strains are now becoming available [34] . However, the TIV/QIV vaccine has been in need of at least two imperative improvements; one is to overcome its dependence upon chicken eggs for viral propagation, and other to increase its cross-protective immunity (hetero-protection) because the TIV/QIV vaccine provides little protection when there is a http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.03.058 0264-410X/\u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. gross antigenic mismatch between the vaccine strains and circulating strains [4] . The commercially available trivalent HA subunit (THS) vaccine ('FluBlok') consisting of three insect-cell-derived full length HAs same as the seasonal TIV vaccine represents the success of overcoming chicken-egg dependence [3, 10, 11] . As for heteroprotection, both TIV and THS vaccines have been largely overlooked that universal vaccines have been developed in other platforms; for example, the hemagglutinin HA2 stalk domain-based vaccine, NPbased DNA vaccine, M2e-based subunit vaccine and cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies [2, 6, [12] [13] [14] [15] 35] .",

More recently, Kanekiyo et al. showed that the ectodomain of HA protein was fused to ferritin to form nanoparticles with eight trimeric viral spikes on its surface, and the nanoparticle vaccine improved the potency and breadth of influenza virus immunity [19] . In addition, Li et al. showed that the full-length ectodomain of the spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was fused to the foldon domain derived from T4 bacteriophage, and the fusion protein induced a significantly higher titer of neutralizing antibody [21] .
