We found that the surge in cases resulted predominantly (90%) from secondary transmission largely attributable to an outbreak at a single healthcare facility in Riyadh. Genome sequencing of MERS coronavirus from 6 cases demonstrated continued circulation of the recently described recombinant virus. A single unique frameshift deletion in open reading frame 5 was detected in the viral sequence from 1 case.",

To date, approximately 80% of MERS-CoV cases have been reported by SA. The spectrum of clinical illness associated with MERS-CoV infection is broad and ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia, multiorgan failure, and death. The overall case fatality rate is approximately 35%-40%, and individuals with underlying medical comorbidities appear to be at increased risk for infection, severe illness, and death [1] . The epidemiology of MERS-CoV has been characterized by intermittent sporadic cases, occasional large healthcare-associated outbreaks, and transmission to close household contacts of cases [2, 3] . Zoonotic transmission is suspected as the source of primary infection in humans, with increasing evidence supporting the importance of dromedary camels in SA [1, 4] .",

All 6 cases were either from Riyadh or had traveled to Riyadh within the exposure period. Four of the 6 cases were exposed to Hospital A as patients or visitors. Phylogenetic and recombinational analysis revealed that all 6 viruses were members of a recently described novel recombinant clade (NRC-2015). Sequences from cases linked to Hospital A were genetically similar ( Figure 1B) and distinct from 2 cases not linked to Hospital A. Of cases not linked to Hospital A, one had visited a relative (not a MERS case) in a Riyadh hospital where limited transmission had occurred, but the patient denied contact with a known MERS-CoV case. The other case was an 83-year-old man who resided in Jeddah, but he had visited Riyadh during the exposure period and had healthcare contact in both Riyadh (not Hospital A) and Jeddah for a chronic illness. The MERS-CoV sequence from this patient possessed a unique 20-nucleotide frameshift deletion spanning positions 387/388 to 407/408 of the nonstructural protein gene ORF5. Whereas native ORF5 is predicted to encode a 224-amino acid (aa) protein, the deletion would predict a 147-aa truncated protein consisting of the amino-terminal 129 aa of ORF5 plus 18 non-ORF5 residues prematurely terminating in an out-of-frame stop codon. This sequence clustered most closely with MERS-CoV sequences derived from 3 camels in April 2015 from Taif, SA, that lacked the deletion [4] (Figure 1B) . No definitive link to camels was identified for this patient; however, the patient was deceased and the interview was conducted with a relative.",

Overall, 129 (90%) of 143 cases reported in July and August were exposed to a healthcare setting or had close contact with a known MERS-CoV case during the exposure period. Sporadic cases were relatively uncommon. The case fatality rate of 43% during July-August 2015 was similar to the overall MERS-CoV case fatality rate of 42% reported in SA since 2012 [8] . Other characteristics of cases, such as male predominance, median age, and a high prevalence of medical comorbidities, particularly diabetes, are consistent with what has been described from earlier outbreaks [2, 9] . Our findings demonstrate that transmission of MERS-CoV continues to be predominantly linked to healthcare exposure and, to a lesser extent, household exposure to close contacts [2, 3] .",

Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV possesses 5 group-specific ORFs (3, 4a, 4b, 5 , and 8b) that encode putative accessory proteins whose functions have not yet been fully characterized [12] . Deletion analysis by reverse genetics has shown that several of these ORFs, including ORF5, are not essential for virus replication in vitro [13] . The ORF5 frameshift mutation described here would most likely result in diminished or lost protein function, suggesting that it was not essential for efficient virus propagation in this particular patient. The possible effect of the ORF5 frameshift mutation on the clinical course of infection in this patient is unknown; we have no evidence that the deletion resulted in altered virulence or transmissibility of the virus, nor do we know whether the MERS-CoV ORF5 deletion was successfully transmitted to a new host.",

(B) Phylogeny of MERS-CoV full genome sequences. The phylogenetic tree was constructed from MERS-CoV genome sequences obtained from the 6 cases reported during July-August, 2015, and all near complete genome sequences available in public domain (n = 188) using the program MrBayes version 3.2.6 under a general time-reversible (GTR) model of nucleotide substitution with 4 categories of \u03b3-distributed rate heterogeneity and a proportion of invariant sites (GTR + 4 + I). Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV sequences belonging to the recently described novel recombinant clade (NRC-2015) [7, 10] are shown in expanded view. The 6 sequences identified in this study are marked with circles, and those colored red highlight the 4 cases linked to Hospital A. The sequence from the case with the 20-nucleotide frameshift deletion in open reading frame (ORF)5 is marked with \u0394. Clade-credibility values \u226570% are indicated above the respective nodes. Numbers in brackets after some strain identifiers are the number of identical sequences with the same geographic location and sample collection year/month. The scale bar shows the genetic distance as nucleotide substitutions per site. Weeks are WHO epidemiologic weeks; week 35 is truncated at August 31, 2015.",
