            "text": "Coronaviruses belong to the family Coronaviridae, which primarily cause infection of the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract of hosts. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is an economically significant coronavirus that can cause severe diarrhea in pigs. Silver nanomaterials (Ag NMs) have attracted great interests in recent years due to their excellent anti-microorganism properties. Herein, four representative Ag NMs including spherical Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs, NM-300), two kinds of silver nanowires (XFJ011) and silver colloids (XFJ04) were selected to study their inhibitory effect on TGEVinduced host cell infection in vitro. Ag NPs were uniformly distributed, with particle sizes less than 20 nm by characterization of environmental scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope. Two types of silver nanowires were 60 nm and 400 nm in diameter, respectively. The average diameter of the silver colloids was approximately 10 nm. TGEV infection induced the occurring of apoptosis in swine testicle (ST) cells, down-regulated the expression of Bcl-2, up-regulated the expression of Bax, altered mitochondrial membrane potential, activated p38 MAPK signal pathway, and increased expression of p53 as evidenced by immunofluorescence assays, real-time PCR, flow cytometry and Western blot. Under non-toxic concentrations, Ag NPs and silver nanowires significantly diminished the infectivity of TGEV in ST cells. Moreover, further results showed that Ag NPs and silver nanowires decreased the number of apoptotic cells induced by TGEV through regulating p38/mitochondria-caspase-3 signaling pathway. Our data indicate that Ag NMs are effective in prevention of TGEV-mediated cell infection as a virucidal agent or as an inhibitor of viral entry and the present findings may provide new insights into antiviral therapy of coronaviruses.",

            "text": "CoVs have been very common throughout the world, as both human and animals are susceptible to them (http://www.cdc.gov/ coronavirus/). Particularly some coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the recently identified Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) may cause fatal infection in human. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a porcine coronavirus, causes very high mortality in piglets and thus has tremendous impact of pig industry [11, 12] . Vaccination has been extensively applied to prevent pigs from TGEV infection. Virulent or attenuated vaccines can be used to vaccinate sows and the resulting colostrum may provide protection to sucking piglets, however, the immune efficacy was not ideal and the potential dissemination as well as prevalence of infectious agent in piglets remain [13, 14] . Therefore, development of preventive and therapeutic strategies is indispensible for control of TGEV infection. To date, the understanding and knowledge regarding effectiveness evaluation of chemical reagents on TGEV infection are limited. Although Ag NMs have been displaying appealing effect on antiviral research [15, 16] , their potential inhibitory effect on TGEV infection has not been studied and reported until now. Moreover, TGEV, like many other viruses, exerts much of its cell effect through the induction of apoptosis of its host cell [17e19] . Previous reports showed that the activation of caspases played a critical role in cell apoptosis triggered by TGEV [19e 21] . However, whether and how TGEV-mediated apoptosis could be regulated by Ag NMs is unknown.",

Relative quantifications of mRNA expression of the genes of interest were calculated using the comparative threshold cycle number for each sample. The following genes were measured: S-X (a fragment comprising the 3 0 half of the S gene, the intervening sequence and the 3a gene), 3CLpro (a nonstructural gene encoding the 3CLprotease of TGEV), Bax, Bcl-2 and beta-actin. The primers for qRT-PCR in this study were shown in Table S1 .",

The stabilizing agents of Ag NPs were comprised of 7% ammonium nitrate, 4% each of Polyoxyethylene Glycerol Trioleate and 4% Tween 20. The capping agent of silver nanowires 60 nm (Ag NW60), silver nanowires 400 nm (Ag NW400) and silver colloids was PVP (Polyvinylpyrrolidone). However, the concentration of PVP used in these nanomaterials was not the same. The content of PVP in silver colloids was about four times higher than silver nanowires, which is necessary for their synthesis and their good dispersion. Silver colloids were well dispersed and had no obvious precipitation formation even at 1 mg/mL when put at room temperature for 6 months. To determine their dispersion and particle size distribution, Ag NPs and silver colloids were further characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), which has been reported as a powerful characterization technique that complements dynamic light scattering [30] . As shown in Fig. S1 , both Ag NPs and Ag colloids were well dispersed, and their average particle size was about 30 nm. It seems that the particle size distribution data got from NTA is not consistent with the data provided by the company. Maybe it is because two or three nanoparticles bunched together during NTA. Nevertheless, the biggest size is not exceeding 100 nm, and there appeared a single peak in either Ag NPs or Ag colloids. All these findings suggest that Ag NPs and Ag colloids were well dispersed.",

To evaluate the potential cytotoxic effects of various Ag NMs on ST cells (a type of TGEV-susceptible porcine cell line), we used MTT assay to investigate the viability of ST cells incubated with different Ag NMs at a concentration ranging from 3.125 to 50 mg/mL for 48 h. As shown in Fig. 1A , 12.5 mg/mL Ag NPs resulted in little cytotoxicity in vitro. More than 80% of the cells remain unaffected by 12.5 mg/mL Ag NPs, whereas 25 and 50 mg/mL Ag NPs were highly toxic to ST cells. In addition, high concentrations (i.e. 50 mg/mL) of silver nanowires (60 nm, 400 nm) induced much less cell death than Ag NPs in ST cells. This might be due to the bigger size of silver nanowires than Ag NPs, and thus little silver nanowires could be taken up by ST cells. However, given the high aspect ratio of silver nanowires, the limited toxicity caused by silver nanowires may be attributed to the insertion of silver nanowires into ST cells. More interestingly, although silver colloids, which were well coated and dispersed by PVP, had a similar shape and size with Ag NPs, they caused no cytotoxicity in ST cells even at the highest dose tested (50 mg/mL). It is well known that the surface chemistry of the nanoparticles can modify their interactions with external systems. The fact that the Ag NPs present higher cytotoxicity than PVPcoated Ag colloids can be explained in terms of surface chemistry. Since Ag NPs possess lower surface coating, they may be able to interact stronger with ST cells or easier to be taken up by ST cells, in turn increasing their toxicity.",

To analyze the anti-TGEV activity of Ag NMs, ST cells were treated with a mixture combined with TGEV and Ag NMs at a concentration of 3.125-12.5 mg/mL. The S-X gene and 3CLpro gene of TGEV were used as target genes and qRT-PCR was employed to examine their expression level. As shown in Fig. 1B and C, the gene levels of S-X and 3CLpro were significantly decreased by Ag NPs, Ag NW60 and Ag NW400 in a dosedependent manner. Nevertheless, silver colloids treatment did not cause a statistically significant change of the amplification of the two genes. These data indicate that Ag NPs and Ag nanowires possess significant anti-TGEV activity, but silver colloids have no effect on TGEV multiplication. The low anti-TGEV activity of PVPcoated silver colloids can also be explained in terms of surface chemistry. Although silver nanowires are also coated with PVP, however, on one hand, the PVP concentration used in silver nanowires is lower than in silver colloids; on the other hand, silver nanowires may be more difficult to be well coated and dispersed by PVP due to their high-aspect-ratio. Thus, the coated PVP may participate in reducing the free Ag surfaces exposed directly to cells and virus, which is responsible for Ag NMs-mediated cytotoxicity and antiviral activity.",

In the present work, we firstly observed the morphological changes of TGEV-infected ST cells. As shown in Fig. 2A Fig. 2B showed that at 24 hpi, the early apoptotic rate of cells infected by the virus control was 10.07%, however, in cells treated with the combined mixture of virus and Ag NMs, the apoptotic rate was downregulated to 5.33% (Ag NPs), 4.97% (Ag NW60) and 4.93% (Ag NW400), respectively, which indicated that Ag NMs had an inhibitory activity against TGEV-induced cell apoptosis. Moreover, we further employed MTT assay to examine the effect of Ag NMs on TGEV-induced cell viability inhibition. Compared with the virus control (without treatment of Ag NMs), Ag NMs (Ag NPs, silver nanowires 60 nm and 400 nm) which were at a concentration of 3.125-12.5 mg/mL exhibited a dose-dependent anti-TGEV activity at 48 hpi (Fig. 2C) 28.94 AE 3.84% (Ag NW400).

To explore the mechanism of TGEV-induced apoptosis in ST cells, we first investigated whether MMP changes were induced in TGEVinfected ST cells. Compared with the untreated ST cells (control), the MMP in TGEV-infected ST cells was notably depolarized in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A) , implying the destruction of mitochondria integrity in TGEV-infected ST cells. Moreover, Bcl-2/ Bax ratio is considered as a predictive marker in mitochondriamediated apoptotic pathway [18, 21, 36] . The pro-apoptotic protein Bax induce the permeabilization of mitochondrial membrane, allowing proteins in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, such as cytochrome C, to escape into the cytosol where they can induce caspase activation and cell apoptosis [37] . Bcl-2, the major antiapoptotic protein, can inhibit Bax-mediated mitochondrial membrane permeabilization [38] . Therefore, we subsequently examined the mRNA levels and protein levels of Bcl-2 and Bax in TGEVinfected ST cells by qRT-PCR and Western blot. The results showed that the mRNA level of Bcl-2 significantly diminished at 12 hpi, and continuously increased until 36 hpi (Fig. 3B) . The mRNA level of Bax was significantly increased in TGEV-infected cells at 12 hpi and continued to increase over infection time (Fig. 3C ). In accordance with the changes at the transcriptional level, the protein level of Bax was also up-regulated in a time-dependent manner in TGEV-infected cells; while the protein level of Bcl-2 was down-regulated in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3D) . These results suggest that up-regulation of Bax and decrease of Bcl-2 induced by TGEV infection may play important roles in TGEVmediated apoptosis in ST cells.",

To further investigate whether TGEV induced ST cell apoptosis through activation of p38 MAPK-p53-mitochondia signaling cascades, we assessed the kinetics of p38 MAPK phosphorylation by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 4A , the expression level of phosphorylated p38 (Pi-p38) was increased in a time-dependent manner and appeared the most significant increase at 24 hpi in TGEV-infected ST cells. Next we further examined whether TGEV-stimulated p38 phosphorylation could participate in the regulation of Bcl-2 and Bax expression. SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38-MAPKs [41] was used to inhibit TGEV-induced p38 phosphorylation, and then the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax was analyzed by Western blot. In the presence of 25 mM SB203580, the activation of p38 was significantly blocked in TGEV-infected cells (data not shown). Moreover, SB203580 treatment could significantly inhibit TGEV-induced Bax expression, and restore the expression of Bcl-2, which was down-regulated by TGEV infection (Fig. 4B) . These findings indicate that TGEV-induced increase of Bcl-2/Bax ratio, which plays important roles in mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis, is dependent on TGEV-mediated activation of p38 MAPK.",

To determine whether Ag NMs could inhibit TGEVinduced apoptosis through regulating p38 MAPK-p53mitochondia signaling cascades, we next employed Western blot to quantify the expression of Pi-p38, Bcl-2 and Bax in ST cells exposed to mixtures combined with TGEV and Ag NMs. As shown in Fig. 4C , Ag NMs treatment could significantly inhibit TGEVinduced expression of Pi-p38 and Bax, but increase the expression of Bcl-2 protein.

Importantly, caspases-3 has been considered as a critical mediator of mitochondrial events of apoptosis [42] . Therefore, in this study, we next tried to figure out whether the antiapoptotic effect of Ag NMs could be explained by an inhibition of caspase-3 activation. As shown in Fig. 4D , E and 4F, the level of precursor caspase-3 (pro caspase-3) was reduced in TGEV-infected cells, but drastically recovered in cells treated with TGEV plus Ag NMs. We also examined the caspase-3-mediated cleavage of precursor PARP (pro PARP) by Western blot. The results showed that caspase-3-mediated cleavage of precursor PARP in cells treated with TGEV plus Ag NMs was much less than in the cells only infected with TGEV (Fig. 4D, E and 4F ). All these results indicate that Ag NMs inhibit apoptosis during TGEV infection via regulating p38/mitochondria-caspase-3-mediated apoptotic pathway.",

Ag NMs including Ag NPs and silver nanowires may directly interact with TGEV surface protein, such as TGEV S glycoprotein, thus inhibit the initiation of TGEV infection. TGEV S glycoprotein is the dominant surface protein that responsible for inducing neutralizing antibodies and initiating infection [43e46] . Binding of the S glycoprotein to the cellular receptor porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) is required for the initiation of TGEV infection [47] . It is possible that Ag NPs and Ag nanowires could alter the structure of some surface proteins of TGEV and then inhibit their recognition and adhesion of the cellular receptor pAPN. However, silver colloids, which are well coated and dispersed by PVP, may cause limited effect on the activity of TGEV. Nevertheless, future studies will be focused on the underlying molecular mechanisms by which the effective anti-TGEV Ag NMs interact with TGEV by using experimental studies and large-scale molecular-dynamics simulations.",
