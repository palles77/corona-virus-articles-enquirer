The nucleolar trafficking of wild type viral proteins and chimeric proteins, which contain altered NoLSs, were compared to investigate the role of NoLSs in dynamic nucleolar trafficking. Three viral proteins from diverse viruses were selected which localised to the nucleolus; the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus nucleocapsid (N) protein, the herpesvirus saimiri ORF57 protein and the HIV-1 Rev protein. The chimeric proteins were N protein and ORF57 protein which had their own NoLS replaced with those from ORF57 and Rev proteins, respectively. By analysing the sub-cellular localisation and trafficking of these viral proteins and their chimeras within and between nucleoli using confocal microscopy and photo-bleaching we show that NoLSs are responsible for different nucleolar localisations and trafficking rates.",

Several features can be identified in the nucleolus corresponding to its central role in RNA synthesis including fibrillar centres (FCs), dense fibrillar components (DFCs), and a granular compartment (GC) . As with other sub-nuclear structures, although the nucleolus appears to be stable, when viewed as fixed cell preparations for fluorescence or under the electron microscope, nucleolar proteins are undergoing continuous exchange with the nucleoplasm (Andersen et al., 2005; Hernandez-Verdun, 2006; Hernandez-Verdun et al., 2002; Lamond and Sleeman, 2003; Phair and Misteli, 2000) . Therefore the structure of the nucleolus has been proposed to be maintained by the equilibrium between binding and release of sequestered proteins (Misteli, 2001) . As such to account for protein localisation to discrete compartments within the nucleus including the nucleolus, a scanning mechanism has been proposed (Misteli, 2001) in which proteins diffuse through the nucleoplasm until they find their target, rather than requiring specific targeting signals per se (Misteli, 2001) .",

For example, in the DNA virus herpesvirus saimiri (HVS), nucleolar localization of the viral ORF57 protein was shown to be required for the nuclearcytoplasmic trafficking of intron-less viral RNAs (Boyne and Whitehouse, 2006; Goodwin et al., 1999; Williams et al., 2005) . A number of retroviral proteins, for example from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), localise to the nucleolus including the Rev (Cochrane et al., 1990; Perkins et al., 1989) and Tat proteins (Kuppuswamy et al., 1989; Ruben et al., 1989) . One of the functions of Rev protein within the life cycle of HIV is trafficking of intron-containing viral RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Pollard and Malim, 1998) . Multimerisation of Rev is crucial to this function (Stauber et al., 1998) , and this step is predominately thought to occur in the nucleolus (Daelemans et al., 2004) . Indeed the interaction of Rev with viral RNA can be disrupted through the use of nucleolar Rev binding elements (Michienzi et al., 2006) , HIV-1 RNA can be cleaved in the nucleolus using ribozymes (Michienzi et al., 2000) and likewise small nucleolar RNA-TAR decoy RNAs can be used to sequester Tat (Michienzi et al., 2002) . All of these approaches have illustrated the essential role of the nucleolus in virus biology as well as providing potential genetic therapeutic strategies against HIV-1 infection (Rossi et al., 2007) . Despite the cytoplasm being the primary site of viral RNA synthesis, many positive strand RNA virus proteins have been shown to localise to the nucleolus (Hiscox, 2003 (Hiscox, , 2007 Rowland and Yoo, 2003; Taliansky and Robinson, 2003; Weidman et al., 2003) , and these are generally viral capsid/ nucleocapsid proteins whose function is in binding to viral RNA. For example, many coronavirus and the closely related arterivirus nucleocapsid (N) proteins have been shown to localise to the nucleolus Rowland et al., 1999; Tijms et al., 2002; Wurm et al., 2001) . Mutation of the nuclear/nucleolar localisation signal (NLS/NoLS) in the arterivirus porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) N protein in the context of recombinant virus infected cells resulted in cytoplasmic localisation of the protein and lower viral titers when compared to wild type virus (Lee et al., 2006) . Upon passage in swine, NLS/NoLS revertant mutants were observed (Lee et al., 2006) pointing to a role for the nucleolus/ nucleus in the virus life cycle (Pei et al., 2008) . In the positive strand plant RNA groundnut rosette virus the nucleolus and interaction with nucleolar proteins has been shown to be essential for systemic infection (Kim et al., 2007a (Kim et al., , 2007b . In negative strand RNA viruses the nucleoprotein and non-structural protein 1 (NS1) protein in certain strains of influenza virus has also been shown to localise to the nucleolus (Melen et al., 2007; Ozawa et al., 2007) , and NS1 protein has been shown to interact with nucleolin (Murayama et al., 2007) .",

How these operate to direct proteins to the nucleolus is generally not well understood. To investigate the role of NoLSs in dynamic trafficking and directing sub-nucleolar localisation, three viral proteins were selected from a DNA, RNA and retrovirus, which had defined but different NoLSs. The avian coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus N protein, a phosphorylated viral RNA binding protein (Chen et al., 2005; Spencer et al., 2008; Spencer and Hiscox, 2006) , localises to both the cytoplasm and the nucleolus in both infected and cells over-expressing N protein (Chen et al., 2002; Hiscox et al., 2001; Wurm et al., 2001) . N protein can be predominately found within the DFC and GC Reed et al., 2006) and contains an eight amino acid motif (WRRQARFK) which is necessary and sufficient for directing nucleolar localisation . N protein also contains a defined nuclear export signal . HVS ORF57 protein localises predominately to the nucleus, nucleolus and nuclear speckles Williams et al., 2005) and contains a bi-partite NoLS which is composed of two different but functional NLSs, a classical pat4 motif (KRPR) and a second 10 amino acid motif (RRPSRPFRKP) (Boyne and Whitehouse, 2006) . HIV-1 Rev protein, localises to the nucleolus in the DFCs and GC (Dundr et al., 1995) and contains a 16 amino acid motif (RQARRNRRRRWRERQRQ) which directs nucleolar localisation (Cochrane et al., 1990; Kubota et al., 1989) . All of these signals have been shown to be necessary (i.e. if they are deleted/mutated in the context of wild type protein then nucleolar localisation is abolished) and sufficient (they will retarget an exogenous protein to the nucleolus) for protein localisation to the nucleolus (Cochrane et al., 1990; Goodwin and Whitehouse, 2001; Reed et al., 2006) .",

            "text": "To investigate the role of viral NoLSs in localisation and dynamic nucleolar trafficking, a series of expression plasmids were utilised which led to the production of wild type viral proteins tagged to EGFP (EGFP-N, EGFP-Rev and EGFP-ORF57) (Fig. 1) , and chimeric proteins in which the function of the wild type NoLS had been disabled and replaced with a heterologous NoLS from another viral protein. These chimeric proteins were generated from EGFP-N protein in which its own NoLS had been disrupted and replaced with the corresponding NoLS from ORF57 (generating protein EGFP-N\u0394 NoLS/ORF57 ) and the EGFP-ORF57 protein in which its NoLS had been disrupted and replaced the HIV-1 Rev protein NoLS (generating protein EGFP-ORF57\u0394 NoLS/Rev ) (Boyne and Whitehouse, 2006) (Fig. 1 ). Fluorescent fusion tagged proteins were used in this study to allow live imaging, dynamic trafficking, to avoid fixation artefacts of subcellular localisation and also difficulties associated with using antibodies to detect proteins in the nucleolus (Sheval et al., 2005. To provide markers for the nucleolus and for comparison in the dynamic trafficking analysis described below, Vero cells were transfected with expression plasmids which led to the production of fluorescent tagged cellular nucleolar proteins, nucleolin (EGFPnucleolin), fibrillarin (EGFP-fibrillarin) and one of the two splice variants of B23 (Chang and Olson, 1989) ; B23.1 (EGFP-B23.1). EGFPnucleolin localised predominately to the nucleolus (with some nuclear localisation) and was located mainly within the GC, but was excluded from FCs (Fig. 2 ). EGFP-fibrillarin had a globular type nucleolar localisation and localised principally to the DFCs with some nuclear accumulation (Fig. 2) . EGFP-B23.1 localised mainly to the DFCs in the nucleolus but did not accumulate in the FCs (Fig. 2 ). This is similar to previously published data on the nucleolar localisation of these proteins (Chen and Huang, 2001; Dundr et al., 2000) .",

Whilst EGFP-N protein and EGFP-Rev protein had a nucleolar distribution which was similar to EGFP-B23.1, localising to the DFCs, EGFP-ORF57 did not have a nucleolar localisation pattern which corresponded to the marker proteins, and could not be assigned either to the FC, DFC or GC. Previously, Rev protein has been reported to localise to the DFC and GC and to co-localise with B23.1 (Dundr et al., 1995) . Interestingly overexpression of the viral and chimeric viral proteins led to different nucleolar morphologies suggesting that these proteins may alter the structure of the nucleolus.

Both EGFP-N protein and EYFP-N protein co-localised to the cytoplasm and the nucleolus as determined by the merged image ( Fig.  3A ). EGFP-ORF57 protein and BFP-ORF57 protein co-localised as determined by the merged image (Fig. 3B ). In both cases variable nuclear localisation was observed and two examples of this are shown in which the proteins appear to be mainly localised to the nucleolus, or localised to the nucleolus and other sub-nuclear structures (Fig. 3B ). Co-expression of EGFP-N and BFP-ORF57 indicated that whilst EGFP-N localised in the cytoplasm and the nucleolus, BFP-ORF57 localised in the nucleolus only ( Fig. 3C ) as would be predicted based upon their expression profiles when expressed in isolation. In cells expressing EGFP-Rev protein and BFP-ORF57 protein (Fig. 3D) , EGFP-Rev protein localised predominately to the nucleolus and BFP-ORF57 predominately to other nuclear structures, with a weaker localisation in the nucleolus. This suggested that when co-expressed, EGFP-Rev protein may occupy the nucleolus in preference to BFP-ORF57 protein; this may be related to trafficking dynamics and/or relative affinity of interaction with components of the nucleolus.",

However, EYFP-N protein had a localisation pattern that was predominately nucleolar/nuclear (Fig. 4A ), similar to EGFP-N\u0394 NoLS/ ORF57 protein. A minority of the protein still localised to the cytoplasm but was below the threshold of detection when the fluorescence in the nucleolus was captured in the linear range, indicating a localisation pattern intermediate between fluorescent tagged wild type N protein and EGFP-N\u0394 NoLS/ORF57 protein. This result may indicate that EGFP-N\u0394 NoLS/ORF57 protein and EYFP-N protein dimerised and that the ORF57 NoLS was the dominant localisation signal operating in the protein complex.

Co-expression of EGFP-ORF57\u0394 NoLS/Rev and BFP-ORF57 indicated that in general both proteins co-localised ( Fig. 4C ) (although there were minor differences, arrowed and visible in merged image), despite the parental EGFP-Rev protein and BFP-ORF57 protein having different localisation patterns (Fig. 3D ). Similar, to the self-association of N protein, data indicated that ORF57 protein can also self-associate (Malik and Clements, 2004) which may therefore account for the co-localisation of EGFP-ORF57\u0394 NoLS/Rev and BFP-ORF57, and again indicating that one NoLS might be dominant over another.",

In general the trafficking of nucleolar proteins can be classified into two broad criteriafast and slow, depending on their function (Hernandez-Verdun, 2006) . In this study 24 h post-transfection a defined region of the nucleolus was photo-bleached using FRAP and the time taken for the nucleolar marker proteins (Fig. 5) , viral proteins and chimeric viral proteins (Fig. 6) to refill this photo-bleached area was determined (Fig. 7) . The data indicated that EGFP-nucleolin (t 1/2 = 2.93 \u00b1 1.28 s) and EGFP-fibrillarin (t 1/2 = 2.13 \u00b1 0.41 s) had recovery rates that were not significantly different from each other (P = 0.22, significant difference P \u2264 0.05).

For example, the predicted molecular weights of N, ORF57 and Rev monomeric proteins are approximately 45, 48 and 15 kDa, respectively (excluding the EGFP tag), yet the trafficking of EGFP-Rev protein is slower than EGFP-N protein, while the trafficking of EGFP-N protein is faster than the largest protein, EGFP-ORF57. This analysis is somewhat complicated in that all three proteins have been reported to form multimers (Chen et al., 2003; Daelemans et al., 2004; Malik and Clements, 2004) . However, taken together our data suggests that similar to cellular nucleolar proteins, different viral proteins (from diverse viruses) can display different nucleolar trafficking profiles. Indeed, although conducted in different cell lines, the PRRSV N protein has faster recovery rates than the IBV N protein and nucleolin, fibrillarin and B23.1 (You et al., 2008) .",

In this assay, a selected nucleolus was continually imaged and photo-bleached for a period of 3 min and the fluorescence intensity of the non-bleached nucleolus was assessed. Rapid loss of fluorescence in the non-bleached nucleolus is suggestive of a dynamic interchange of the tagged protein between the nucleoplasm and nucleolus. No reduction in fluorescence intensity would Comparison of the relative trafficking between two nucleoli using FLIP in general reflected the mobility data obtained in the FRAP experiments. The three cellular nucleolar proteins examined were rapidly lost from the non-bleached nucleolus, with greatly reduced signal at 60 s (Fig. 8) . This is similar to the data of Phair and Misteli (2000) , who found that if one nucleolus was continuously photobleached then this resulted in the complete loss of nucleolin, fibrillarin and B23.1 from the other. Our data indicated that there was no general correlation between rate of loss and whether the protein had a nucleolar/nuclear rather than an exclusively nuclear distribution (e.g. EGFP-nucleolin versus EGFP-B23.1). Of the viral proteins examined, loss of fluorescence from the unbleached nucleolus was not related to the molecular weight of the protein, with EGFP-ORF57 having a slower amount of loss compared to EGFP-Rev and EGFP-N, the latter of which had the fastest amount of loss (Fig. 9) . A possible explanation for this observation may be due to the presence of a pool of the viral protein in the nucleoplasm which is more readily drawn on by the photo-bleached nucleoli, as observed with EGFPnucleolin and EGFP-fibrillarin. Again, the chimeric proteins had loss rates which were similar to the protein from which the NoLS was derived. EGFP-N\u0394 NoLS/ORF57 protein was retained in the non-photobleached nucleolus similar to EGFP-ORF57 and EGFP-ORF57\u0394 NoLS/Rev protein had a greater loss than EGFP-ORF57.",

This is supported by the use of chimeric viral proteins which have their own NoLS mutated and a heterologous NoLS inserted. These chimeric proteins have an altered localisation pattern and trafficking rate which overrides the wild type phenotype and would appear to be dependent on the heterologous NoLS. Interestingly substitution of the ORF57 NoLS with the Rev Protein NoLS restored the viral RNA trafficking function of ORF57 protein (Boyne and Whitehouse, 2006) .",

            "text": "Given that trafficking of the viral and chimeric proteins may not be related to their molecular weight, the different NoLSs may be interacting with different cellular partners to promote differential trafficking and localisation of a protein within the nucleolus. Within the nucleolus the two obvious candidates are interactions with nucleolar proteins and/or RNA. Previous data has indicated that N protein can interact with nucleolin and fibrillarin (Chen et al., 2002; Dove et al., 2006; Reed et al., 2006) . Indeed the trafficking profile of N protein, in this study is similar to nucleolin and fibrillarin. This suggests a protein:protein interaction with N protein and a cellular nucleolar protein may be responsible for its trafficking. However, Rev protein has been shown to co-localise and interact with B23.1 (Dundr et al., 1995; Li, 1997; Marasco et al., 1994; Miyazaki et al., 1996) although the trafficking profiles are different. Similarly ORF57 can also associate with viral RNA and other cellular protein which are found in the nucleolus (Boyne et al., 2008; Williams et al., 2005) . Likewise, although PRRSV N protein has been shown to interact with fibrillarin the mobility of the two proteins within the nucleolus is different (EGFP labelled PRRSV N protein had a D value of 0.839 \u03bcm 2 /s and EGFP-labelled fibrillarin had a D value of 0.278 \u03bcm 2 /s) (You et al., 2008) .",
