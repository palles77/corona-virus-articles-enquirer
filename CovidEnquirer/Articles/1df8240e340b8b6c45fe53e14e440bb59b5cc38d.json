More recently, an in vitro translation-translocation reaction has been described for set and p&dependent proteins (Miiller and Blobel, 1984; Rhoads et al., 1984) . In this reaction, presecretory proteins, synthesized in an Escherichia coli extract, translocate into the lumen of inverted, sealed plasma membrane vesicles. As clearly established in vivo, the in vitro translocation is not coupled to ongoing polypeptide chain growth and requires both ATP hydrolysis (Chen and Tai, 1985) and the membrane electrochemical potential (Geller et al., 1988) .",

An important step in the purification of trigger factor is affinity chromatography on proOmpA-Sepharose, confirming our hypothesis that these proteins can form a complex. N-terminal sequence analysis indicates that trigger factor is not one of the proteins encoded by the well-studied set, prl, or heat shock genes. Studies reported here and in an accompanying article (Lill et al., 1988) show interactions of trigger factor with ribosomes, proOmpA, and membranes and suggest a cyclic mode of its action. The similarity of this trigger factor cycle to the cyclic action of canine SRP led us to the finding that SRP, which had been thought to act exclusively in the context of the ribosome, can also stabilize purified proOmpA for membrane insertion. These studies suggest that a primary function of trigger factor, and possibly SRP, is to stabilize presecretory proteins for membrane translocation.",

Expression of the omp9 gene under the trc promoter in a multicopy plasmid causes substantial overproduction of proOmpA and OmpA ( Figure 1, lanes 1 and 2) . Cells were disrupted and incubated with Sarkosyl to solubilize the membrane proteins. As described by Freud1 et al. (1986) the proOmpA remains aggregated in this detergent extract and can be separated from the other cellular proteins simply by centrifugation. ProOmpA was solubilized from this \"washed pellet\" fraction with 8 M urea. This procedure resulted in a 5-fold purification and 35% yield of proOmpA. In a typical preparation, 422 mg of purified proOmpA (Figure 1 , lanes 3-9) was obtained from 62 g (wet weight) of cells.",

Incubations were performed in either the presence, or absence of ATP and NADH, as indicated. Lane 15 is a standard of proOmpA. available, we covalently linked proOmpA to a CNB-activated Sepharose column to create an affinity resin for the isolation of trigger factor. The resin was suspended in crude soluble protein extract (S40) from E. coli in the presence of 8 M urea, then dialyzed to remove the urea. These conditions were chosen to mimic those in which the trigger factor in S40 was shown to support renaturation of radiochemically pure [s5S]proOmpA (Crooke and Wickner, 1987). The dialyzed suspension was poured into a column, rinsed with buffer, and step-eluted with buffer containing 8 M urea. This affinity step resulted in a 23-fold purification of trigger factor with a 55% yield.",

The overall purification, in three steps, is 150-fold with a 54% yield (Table 1 ; see Experimental Procedures for trigger factor activity assay). Analysis of trigger factor at each step of the purification by SDS-PAGE and silver staining ( Figure 4A ) shows that the purified protein (lane 5) is a single polypeptide of apparent size 63,000 daltons. It was recovered as a single, sharp, symmetric peak on the final step of ion exchange chromatography ( Figure 48 ). The 63,000 dalton polypeptide eluted at fraction 28 ( Figure  4C ), coincident, with the trigger factor activity of promoting proOmpA translocation into membrane vesicles ( Figure  4D ). While minor bands of lower molecular weight can be detected, these polypeptides are not consistently seen (see, for example, Figure 3A of Lill et al., 1988) and do not form a complex with proOmpA (see Figure 7 ). Gel filtration analysis shows that the prominent polypeptide ( Figure  4C ) and trigger factor activity co-elute with an apparent size of 73,000 daltons ( Figure 5 ), indicating that trigger factor is a monomeric protein.",

To establish that this is a feature of the purified protein, and to characterize its action, proOmpA was diluted from 8 M to 0.8 M urea and assayed for translocation. Immediately after dilution, proOmpA is competent for translocation ( Figure 6 , lane 3) and the efficiency of this translocation is not affected by trigger factor (lane 4). However, pro-OmpA lost competence for membrane insertion after a 3 hr preincubation at 21% (Figure 6, lane 5). As previously reported (Crooke et al., 1988) proOmpA preincubated in the presence of trigger factor retains full activity for assembly into inverted plasma membrane vesicles from E. coli ( Figure 6, lane 7) . Addition of trigger factor to proOmpA that had already misfolded during preincubation at 21% did not restore its competence for assembly (lane 9) suggesting that trigger factor stabilizes the competent form of proOmpA rather than refolding the incompetent protein. Since proOmpA can bind directly to membrane vesicles in the absence of trigger factor, we determined whether membranes would stabilize the translocation-competent form of the precursor protein. Pro-OmpA preincubated at 21\u00b0C with membrane vesicles lost competence for subsequent membrane translocation ( Figure 6 , lane 11) while preincubation in the presence of membranes and trigger factor, but without ATP and NADH (lane 12), stabilized the assembly-active precursor.",

A second question is whether trigger factor is related to the heat shock, ATP-dependent unfolding activities required for protein translocation into endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria in yeast (Deshaies et al., 1988; Chirico et al., 1988) . We note, however, that the cellular concentraGon of trigger factor is not affected by heat shock (E. C. and S. L., unpublished observations). Finally, it will be important to understand how trigger factor is released from proOmpA as the proOmpA crosses the membrane.
