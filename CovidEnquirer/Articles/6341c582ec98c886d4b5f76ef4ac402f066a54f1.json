Recently, molecular methods have been used to amplify and identify novel nucleic acid sequences directly from clinical samples, but these methods may be hampered by the quantity of virus present in respiratory secretions at different time points following the onset of infection. Human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures, which effectively mimic the human bronchial environment, allow for cultivation of a wide variety of human respiratory viral pathogens. The goal of the experiments described here was to determine if propagation and identification of a human respiratory virus may be achieved through inoculation of HAE cultures followed by whole transcriptome amplification (WTA) and sequence analysis. To establish proof-of-principle human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) was evaluated, and the first visualization of HCoV-NL63 virus by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is reported. Initial propagation of human respiratory secretions onto HAE cultures followed by TEM and WTA of culture supernatant may be a useful approach for visualization and detection of new human respiratory pathogens that have eluded identification by traditional approaches.",

            "text": "The detection of human respiratory virus pathogens can be challenging due to difficulty in obtaining high titer clinical specimens, and the inefficiency of propagating the virus in established cell lines. Viruses that replicate readily in culture and induce dramatic cytopathic effect (CPE), such as influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial viruses, adenoviruses, rhinoviruses and coronaviruses responsible for common colds (229E and OC43) were identified and characterized by electron microscopy in the 1960s. However, these efficiently propagating viruses likely represent only a fraction of Abbreviations: HCoV-NL63, human coronavirus NL63; WTA, whole transcriptome amplification; SARS-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; CPE, cytopathic effect; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; HAE, human airway epithelium. the viruses that cause significant clinical disease (Iwane et al., 2004; Jartti et al., 2004; Juven et al., 2000) . In recent years, viral respiratory pathogens such as human metapneumovirus (van den Hoogen et al., 2001) and human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) (van der Hoek et al., 2004 ) that propagate slowly in standard cell lines have been identified using molecular approaches to amplify novel sequences from infected cell lines. However, the optimal propagation of a human respiratory virus and detection of virus-infected cells may still be a roadblock for identification of novel pathogens. A culture system which faithfully mimics human airways may alleviate some of these challenges. Therefore, human airway epithelial (HAE) cells were evaluated as a culture system for the initial propagation of a human respiratory virus, followed by visualization of the virus by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and use of a random amplification approach to detect viral sequences. HAE cultures are derived from primary bronchial epithelial cells isolated from the airways of human lung donors or patients undergoing lung transplantation, and have been used extensively to study the biology of respiratory epithelium (Fulcher et al., 2005) . Primary bronchial epithelial cells are harvested from the inner lining of airways and are cultured on porous supports, initially submerged in medium. After the cells grow to form a confluent monolayer, the medium is removed from the apical side, creating an air-liquid interface culture. The primary cells then replicate and differentiate to recapitulate the pseudostatified epithelial morphology found in the human airway. Mature differentiated HAE cultures can be maintained for up to 2 months and contain mucus-producing goblet cells and non-ciliated and ciliated epithelial cells, which have been shown to be ideal for propagation of a wide range of human respiratory pathogens, including influenza virus (Thompson et al., 2006) , parainfluenza viruses (Zhang et al., 2005) , respiratory syncytial virus (Zhang et al., 2002) , adenovirus (Zhang et al., 2002) , and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Sims et al., 2006) . Propagation of human viral pathogens in clinical specimens on HAE cultures may provide an optimal environment. Therefore, HAE cultures may be a useful culturing technique for virus discovery research. To establish proof-of-principle for this concept, the replication of HCoV-NL63 in HAE cultures was studied.",

Researchers noted that a clinical specimen obtained from a pediatric patient hospitalized with a respiratory tract infection induced a low level of CPE after 8 days of incubation in a monkey kidney cell line, LLCMK2 cells. Using a novel molecular amplification, van der Hoek et al. (2004) were able to amplify, sequence and identify a novel coronavirus, designated HCoV-NL63, as the infectious agent. Interestingly, this virus was also identified in respiratory secretions from children with respiratory symptoms by two additional independent research groups (Esper et al., 2005; Fouchier et al., 2004) . In addition to causing upper respiratory infection, HCoV-NL63 is responsible for croup in children , and is distributed worldwide (Arden et al., 2005; Bastien et al., 2005; Suzuki et al., 2005; Vabret et al., 2005) .

However, it is unclear whether viruses that replicate less efficiently in standard cell culture, such as HCoV-NL63 (Schildgen et al., 2006) , would propagate efficiently in HAE cultures. Therefore, HAE cultures were inoculated with 0.2 TCID 50 of HCoV-NL63 and incubated at 33 \u2022 C for 72 h. Cultures were then fixed and stained with anti-serum directed against replicase product expressed in HCoV-NL63-infected cells Chen et al., 2007) . HCoV-NL63 replication was detected in the ciliated bronchial epithelial cells in the HAE cultures (Fig. 1) . Cilia were stained with anti-tubulin antibody (green), nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue), and HCoV-NL63 was stained with antibodies directed against replicase product nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3) (red). HCoV-NL63 replicase protein was detected exclusively in the cytoplasm, with punctate, perinuclear staining evident in discrete foci in the culture. Over a time course of 5 days, spread of infectious virus was detected by visualizing the broader distribution of the antigen positive cells and by passaging cell-free supernatant to fresh cultures and detecting HCoV-NL63 virus at low titer (10-100 TCID 50 /ml) 48-102 h post-infection (data not shown). This is in stark contrast to SARS-CoV, which replicates to high titer (10 8 pfu/ml) in both VeroE6 cells and HAE cultures (Sims et al., 2005) . These results indicate that HCoV-NL63 productively infects ciliated cells. In addition, there was minimal apparent cytopathicity observed in the HCoV-NL63-infected HAE cultures. Similar immunofluorescence results were obtained in three independent experiments. Therefore, this HCoV-NL63 model system manifest-ing low levels of viral replication and virus particle production was ideal to test whether TEM coupled with random amplification of infected cell supernatant could identify a virus that was produced at only low titer in this system.",

All HAE cultures contained a typical mixture of ciliated and non-ciliated bronchial cells, and mucus-producing goblet cells. The mock-infected HAE cultures did not contain HCoV-NL63 virus particles, and cell degeneration and necrosis was extremely rare (data not shown). In HCoV-NL63infected cultures, virus particles were readily detected by careful examination of the ciliated cells ( Fig. 2A-C) . Viral morphogenesis occurred in the apical, supranuclear, Golgi/RER region of the cell cytoplasm. Virus particles, with club-shaped spikes, budded into smooth-walled vesicles ( Fig. 3A and B) . The typical HCoV-NL63 spherical virion measured from 75 to 115 nm in size, with surface spikes projecting 10-20 nm from the viral envelope. This observed morphology is consistent with the average 100 nm diameter and 20 nm spikes of other viruses within the Coronaviridae (Lai et al., 2007) . The HCoV-NL63-infected cells ranged from being healthy to necrotic, with shedding of the dead and dying cells from the monolayer (Fig. 4) . In the necrotic cells, virus was either free in the cytosol or present within vacuoles. Mature virions were seen \"trapped\" among the cilia in HAE cultures from 2 to 4 days after infection with HCoV-NL63. Collections of virions were seen at the bases of cilia, indicating that they likely had undergone exocytosis recently (Fig. 2C) . These results are consistent with TEM analysis of SARS-CoV replication in HAE cultures (Sims et al., 2005) .",

Apical washes from cells at 48 and 72 h post-infection were collected, cell debris was removed, and RNA was isolated from the medium. The RNA was subjected to reverse-transcription and amplification using random primers tagged with amplicon sequences as described in Section 2. This approach, termed whole transcriptome amplification (WTA), has been shown to generate an unbiased array of the sequences present in the sample, and has been used for amplification of quasispecies from unpurified influenza virus (Afonso, 2007; Nagy et al., 2005) . WTA products generated from RNA isolated from the supernatants of mock-infected or HCoV-NL63-infected cells were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel (Fig. 5A) , which revealed that abundant amplification products were generated from the HCoV-NL63-infected sample. The WTA products were cloned into the TOPO-TA cloning vector, transformed into E. coli and plasmid DNA was isolated and subjected to restriction enzyme digestion to determine the size of inserted sequences. Inserts ranged in size from approximately 50 to 500 nucleotides (Fig. 5B) , and plasmid DNAs with inserted sequences were subjected to DNA sequencing and NCBI-BLAST analysis. Sequence analysis of randomly isolated clones revealed that 1 out of 63 (1.6%) was of viral origin (Fig. 5C ). Similar to results obtained with WTA, high throughput pyrosequencing of HCoV-NL63 inoculated HAE cultures revealed that approximately 1% of clones were HCoV-NL63 (data not shown). The remaining clones which were identified by BLASTN or TBLASTX analysis represented a variety of human DNA sequences. Subsequent studies indicate that DNase I treatment after RNA isolation reduced cloning of chromosomal DNA sequences although a background of human ribosomal RNA and mRNAs was still detected. Overall, WTA is an effective method for random amplification and detection of viral sequences from supernatant of HAE cultures experiencing lowlevel viral replication, in a background of cellular sequences.",

Establishing and validating this method will allow for future screening of acute clinical respiratory secretions from patients suffering from illnesses of unknown etiology. Although HAE cultures are labor intensive to establish, they are a valuable research tool for analysis of human respiratory pathogens. To evaluate clinical respiratory samples the respiratory secretions must be filtered to remove bacteria prior to inoculation of HAE cultures. Preliminary studies using application of filtered clinical samples to HAE cultures have not revealed detrimental effects to the HAE cultures.",

HAE cultures were exploited for propagation of a human respiratory virus, HCoV-NL63, and viral replication was detected using an immunofluorescence assay, TEM analysis and a sequenceindependent amplification approach. WTA analysis of HCoV-NL63 inoculated HAE cultures revealed that 1.6% of clones were HCoV-NL63 positive. In comparison, Palacios et al. (2008) identified viral sequences in 14 out of 103,623 (0.01%) randomly amplified cDNAs generated from a patient who succumbed to an unknown viral illness. Thus, the ability to amplify and isolate virus from supernatants has the advantage of reducing the background of human cellular sequences.",

TEM is a powerful tool for the rapid identification of unknown human respiratory viral pathogens as demonstrated by its use in the initial identification of SARS as a member of the Coronaviridae family (Ksiazek et al., 2003) . In summary, experimental demonstration of the use of HAE cultures for the propagation and TEM visualization of human respiratory virus pathogens and sequence-independent amplification of nucleic acid isolated from the supernatant of the infected cultures to identify specific sequence of the virus have been demonstrated.",
