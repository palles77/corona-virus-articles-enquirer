The new method for detection of these viruses was applied simultaneously with real-time PCR for the detection of six bacterial pathogens in clinical samples from 1700 pediatric patients with communityacquired pneumonia (CAP). Of all the patients, 32.5% were suspected to have single bacterial infections; 1.9%, multiple bacterial infections; 15.2%, coinfections of bacteria and viruses; 25.8%, single viral infections; and 2.1%, multiple viral infections. In the remaining 22.6%, the etiology was unknown. The breakdown of suspected causative pathogens was as follows: 24.4% were Streptococcus pneumoniae, 14.8% were Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 11.3% were Haemophilus infl uenzae, and 1.4% were Chlamydophila pneumoniae. The breakdown of viruses was as follows: 14.5% were RV, 9.4% were RSV, 7.4% were hMPV, 7.2% were PIV, and 2.9% were HBoV. The new method will contribute to advances in the accuracy of diagnosis and should also result in the appropriate use of antimicrobials.",

The total time required for obtaining the results for viruses was about 5.0 h. Using this improved method, we 6 detected etiological agents in 117 patients who were hospitalized with CAP. In that study, antibody titers for some pathogens were also measured for paired sera from the patients to verify the PCR results. Based on the identifi cation of etiological agents, our cases in that study were categorized as viral infection (23.1%); viral and bacterial coinfection (38.5%); bacterial infection (21.4%); M. pneumoniae infection, including coinfection with another pathogen (16.2%); and C. pneumoniae infection (0.9%). Our data were very similar to those previously reported by Michelow et al. 7 and J\u00faven et al. 8 It is well known that the causative viruses of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are quite varied, such as infl uenza viruses A, B (Flu A, Flu B); respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) subgroup A and B; parainfl uenza virus 1-3 (PIV1, PIV2, PIV3); adenovirus (AdV); rhinovirus (RV); enterovirus (EV); and coronavirus (CoV).

PPLO broth was selected for cultivating M. pneumoniae. A 1.0-ml aliquot of the PPLO broth was transferred to an Eppendorf tube and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. Nine hundred microliters of the supernatant was discarded, and the remaining solution including the pellet was used as the sample. DNA/RNA was extracted using Extragen II (TOSOH, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's protocol, as follows: fi rst, a 100-\u03bcl aliquot of the suspension was transferred to an Eppendorf tube, which contained 8 \u03bcl of detergent for DNA/RNA coprecipitation. Next, the Eppendorf tube was vortexed for 10 s. To this mixture, 500 \u03bcl of 60% (vol/vol) isopropanol-containing protein-denaturing detergent was added, and the resulting mixture was centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 3 min at 4\u00b0C after vortexing for 10 s. The supernatant was discarded, and the residue was treated with 200 \u03bcl of 40% (vol/vol) isopropanol again, as described above. Finally, the harvested DNA/ RNA pellet was resuspended in DNase-and RNase-free H 2 O to provide 40 \u03bcl of DNA/RNA sample. The extraction process was fi nished within 10 min. cDNA synthesis Reverse transcription (RT) was performed in an Eppendorf tube containing 25.5 \u03bcl reaction mixture after the addition of a 10-\u03bcl aliquot of the DNA/RNA sample as described above. The reaction mixture consisted of: (i) 100 U Rever Tra Ace (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan), (ii) 8.5 \u03bcl of 2 mM dNTPs, (iii) 1 \u03bcl of 25 pmol/\u03bcl random primer, (iv) 40 U RNase inhibitor, and (v) 4 \u03bcl of 5 \u00d7 RT buffer. The RT reaction was carried out at 30\u00b0C for 10 min, 42\u00b0C for 50 min, and terminated by incubation at 99\u00b0C for 10 min, using a thermal cycler (Gene Amp PCR System 9600-R; Perkin-Elmer Cetus, Norwalk, CT, USA). After the RT reaction, 25 \u03bcl of DW was added. Table 1 shows four sets of virus-specifi c primers and molecular beacon (MB) probes (RSV subgroup B, AdV, CoV, and HBoV) that were newly constructed for this study. The primers and MB adenovirus probes were modifi ed from those of He and Jiang 31 in order to amplify serotypes 7 and 14. The HBoV and CoV (OC43) primers were designed based on alignment from the The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. The reference sequences were as follows: HBoV, accession no. DQ296618; CoV (OC43), accession no. NC_005147. The other probes were slightly modifi ed for MB probes as previously described in each of the following references: RSV subgroup A; 32 Flu A, Flu B, and PIV1-3; 26 RV; 33 EV; 34 and hMPV. 35 The MB probes and primers were prepared by Sigma-Aldrich Japan (Tokyo, Japan) and Operon Biotechnologies (Tokyo, Japan), respectively. All of the MB probes were labeled with a fl uorescent reporter, 6-carboxyfl uorescein (FAM) or carboxy-X-rhodamine (ROX) at the 5\u2032 end and labeled with black hole quencher 1 (BHQ-1) at the 3\u2032 end.",

Infections for which the etiological agent was unknown occurred in 22.6% (n = 384) of all the patients examined here.

Bacterial infection accounted for 49.6% (n = 843) of all cases, among which 24.4% (n = 415) were caused by S. pneumoniae, 14.8% (n = 251) were caused by M. pneumoniae, 11.3% (n = 192) were caused by H. infl uenzae, 1.4% (n = 24) were caused by C. pneumoniae, and 0.1% (n = 1) were caused by S. pyogenes.

Therapeutic antibiotics administered to patients upon hospitalization are usually selected empirically, based on the likely etiological agent after viewing of the chest X-ray, hematological studies, consideration of the history, respiratory symptoms, and age of the patient. To avoid inappropriate antimicrobial therapy and to select the most appropriate agent, guidelines for CAP in pediatric and adult patients have been proposed in Japan, 41, 42 as well as in other countries. 43 However, we often encounter a patient in whom it is diffi cult to predict the causative pathogen from the clinical fi ndings described above. It is preferable that the etiological agent be identifi ed on the day of hospitalization, so that the diagnosis of CAP can be made without waiting for bacterial cultures.",
