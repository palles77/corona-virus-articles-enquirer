Currently solid-phase immunoassay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assay [11] [12] [13] have been reported. Although these methods are rather simple and sensitive for the HIV-PR assay, either enzyme or fluorophore labeling of the antibodies or the substrates is required for facile detection and, thus, each assay results in a great expense. In current reports, HIV-PR activity in clinical specimens such as blood of AIDS patients has not been assayed by those methods. In general, the diagnosis of AIDS has been performed by genetic detection of HIV with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the sample amplification because of its extremely high sensitivity.",

When the fluorogenic reaction was carried out for 10 min at pH 7.0 under the different temperatures of 80 to 120\u00b0C (Fig. 1B) , the fluorescent derivative was produced by the high temperatures of the reaction. However, the FL intensity was gradually decreased at a higher temperature than 100\u00b0C, probably due to instability of the fluorescent product at the higher temperatures. The FL production was also greatly affected by pH of sodium borate solution. For the pH examination, the fluorogenic reaction was carried out at 100\u00b0C for 10 min (Fig. 1C) .

When this fluorogenic reaction with the peptide (FLDG) was carried out at 120\u00b0C for 20 min, however, the production yield of the fluorescent derivative of the peptide was approximately 65% of that at 100\u00b0C for 10 min. The different conditions between the peptide and the amino acid amide might be caused by the stability of the fluorescent products given that the product of the amino acid amide was more stable than that of the peptide. The stability of the product of the peptide was investigated by measuring the FL intensity after the fluorogenic reaction. The product was stable at 0 to 4\u00b0C for at least 48 h, although the product was unstable at 100\u00b0C and slightly unstable at room temperature. Therefore, the reaction mixture was cooled in an icewater bath after the fluorogenic reaction until detection.",

However, the residual activity of HIV-PR was less than 5% at 1.0 mM pepstatin A, which was one of the specific inhibitors for aspartic proteases such as HIV-PR [15] [16] [17] . The activity of HIV-PR in the cell lysate was strongly decreased with increasing concentrations of pepstatin A and was completely inhibited with 100 lM pepstatin A. The data indicated that the IC 50 of pepstatin A is 10 \u00c2 10 \u00c06 M. Therefore, the proposed method is specific for the assay of HIV-PR activity.",

In this case, the activity values that were obtained by individually repeated assays (n = 10) using all of the same reagents within a day indicated a larger error with a 7.35% relative standard deviation (RSD), as shown in Fig. 5A . However, the pH adjustment using the same NaOH solution in the presence of PBS (pH 7.0) gave satisfactory precision with a 1.82% RSD for the assays (Fig. 5B) . Because mixing the strong alkaline solution and the acetate buffer (pH 5.5) resulted in varying pHs, it is better to use PBS (pH 7.0) for the pH adjustment.

The conditions for the enzymatic and fluorogenic reactions were optimized, and thus HIV-PR activity in cell lysate could be readily assayed. This assay was applicable to the evaluation of several protease inhibitors for their effect on the activity of HIV-PR. This proposed spectrofluorometric method is reliable and inexpensive, and it does not require any special modified substrates. It is important to measure HIV-PR activity in the blood of AIDS patients. Unfortunately, no specimens of AIDS patients could be prepared in our laboratory due to the biohazard restriction. Therefore, the application of this method is considered as being able to discriminate HIV activity in the presence of other proteases. ",
