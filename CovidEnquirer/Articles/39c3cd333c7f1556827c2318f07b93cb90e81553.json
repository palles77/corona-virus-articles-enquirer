RNA interference (RNAi) pathways have emerged as important regulators of virus-host cell interactions. In this study, the specific effect of RNAi on the replication of ORFV was explored. The application of RNA interference (RNAi) inhibited the replication of ORFV in cell culture by targeting the ORF025 gene of ORFV, which encodes the viral polymerase. Three small interfering RNA (siRNA) (named siRNA704, siRNA1017 and siRNA1388) were prepared by in vitro transcription. The siRNAs were evaluated for antiviral activity against the ORFV Jilin isolate by the observation of cytopathic effects (CPE), virus titration, and real-time PCR. After 48 h of infection, siRNA704, siRNA1017 and siRNA1388 reduced virus titers by 59-to 199-fold and reduced the level of viral replication by 73-89 %. These results suggest that these three siRNAs can efficiently inhibit ORFV genome replication and infectious virus production. RNAi targeting of the DNA polymerase gene is therefore potentially useful for studying the replication of ORFV and may have potential therapeutic applications.",

It is caused by orf virus (ORFV), which is an epitheliotropic parapoxvirus, the prototype member of the genus Parapoxvirus, family Poxviridae [1] . ORFV generally induces proliferative and self-limiting lesions around the mouth, teats and skin of affected animals, especially in young lambs [2] .The mortality rate is as high as 93 % in kids when lesions of the lips and udders prevent them from receiving nutrition, thus leading to rapid emaciation [3, 4] . Outbreaks of orf have occurred in many countries where substantial numbers of sheep and goats are raised [5] . The disease not only causes huge economic losses to the sheep industry but also, as a zoonotic disease, poses a threat to human health [2] .",

RNAi technology is not only a powerful tool for functional genomics studies but is also a potentially useful antiviral method, and it is increasingly being used to inhibit the replication of viral pathogens [10] . Therefore, it has been suggested that the preferred method for controlling the virus is to interfere with replication of the viral genome and the expression of viral genes. We designed specific siRNAs to target the DNA polymerase genes of ORFV in order to test whether RNAi could selectively target ORFV viral DNAs.

The correlation coefficient (R 2 ) of the standard curve was 0.991, and PCR amplification efficiencies (E) were [0.96, with only one peak in all dissociation curves, thereby demonstrating the specificity and reliability of the analysis. The results indicated a significant reduction in the relative expression level of the viral genome per nanogram of total DNA, by 84 %, 89 % and 73 %, respectively, compared to the mock group at 48 h postinfection, when siRNA704, siRNA1017 and siRNA1388, respectively, were used (Fig. 4) .

Long double-stranded RNA is cleaved by an endonuclease (Dicer) into 21-to 25-nt fragments (small interfering RNA; siRNA), and these oligonucleotides can serve as guide sequences to direct a multicomponent nuclease to a specific messenger RNA to destroy it [12] . Studies of the antiviral activity of siRNA have shown that it is effective in the inhibition of viral infection and modulation of viral replication in cultured mammalian cells.",

RNAi is increasingly being used to inhibit the replication of viral pathogens and is a promising approach for antiviral therapy in mammals. siRNAs can be introduced into mammalian cells by in vitro transcription or by transfection with chemically synthesized siRNAs to achieve effective and very rapid silencing of a target gene, although this approach is limited to cells that can be transfected at high rates, and the effects are transient [8] . The DNA polymerase gene, which is located in the central region of the genome of ORFV, is highly conserved within species and is a highly conserved gene that codes for the most conserved nonstructural protein, which catalyzes the replication of the viral genome and plays a primary role in viral replication [18] .",

Our results demonstrate that the three siRNAs were highly capable of inhibiting viral DNA genome replication. Based on the replication kinetics of ORFV in OFTu cells prior to siRNA transfection and the peak period of viral proliferation (data not shown), the cell cultures for viral titration and DNA extraction were harvested at 48 h postinfection.",
