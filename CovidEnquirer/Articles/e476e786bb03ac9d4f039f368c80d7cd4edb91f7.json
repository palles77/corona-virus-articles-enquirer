Liver involvement in nonhepatotropic viral infections can range from mild derangement of liver biochemistry to fulminant liver failure. In most of these infections, liver inflammation is thought to be a consequence of an immune response to viral antigens rather than a direct hepatic infection. In this chapter we review liver diseases associated with opportunistic viral infections in immunocompromised hosts, common systemic viral infections, and viral hemorrhagic fevers. (Table 38 -1)",

            "text": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is transmitted by contact with oral secretions and resides latently in the resting memory B cells. 1 Primary EBV infection affects 90% of the population and manifests as the classic triad of fever, sore throat, and lymphadenopathy, known as infectious mononucleosis. Gastrointestinal manifestations such as abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea are mild. EBV often causes a mild self-limited hepatitis, manifested as twofold to threefold elevations of the levels of serum aminotransferases and hepatosplenomegaly. A cholestatic biochemical pattern has been described in up to 65% of cases 2 but jaundice is rare (5% to 10 % of cases) 3 and vanishing bile duct syndrome is sporadic. 4 Severe hepatitis or acute liver failure requiring emergent liver transplantation is very rare (0.21% of acute liver failure cases in the United States) but has a high case-fatality rate. 5 Notably, these patients are young (younger than 30 years) and immunocompetent. [5] [6] [7] Clinically significant hepatic damage from EBV infection can occur in immunosuppressed patients, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients, transplant patients, or inflammatory bowel disease patients receiving immunosuppressive medications. 8, 9 Chronic hepatitis potentially linked to EBV infection has been reported. 10 Some cases of autoimmune 11 or granulomatous 12 hepatitis have also been associated with EBV infection. Despite the definite oncogenic potential of EBV, there is no convincing evidence linking EBV and the development of liver cancer, with the exception of the lymphoepithelioma-like hepatocellular carcinoma 13 and lymphoepithelioma-like cholangiocarcinoma. 14 EBV infection after liver transplantation is a rare (3%) but feared complication because it can lead to posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). Because 90% of adults are EBV seropositive, the predominant pathophysiologic mechanism of active EBV infection after transplant is EBV reactivation. 15 High-dose steroid treatment of rejection is a strong predictor of PTLD. 16 Although liver biopsy samples from EBV hepatitis patients exhibit a wide spectrum of histologic features, a moderate to marked lymphocytic infiltrate in the portal tracts with scattered foci of interface activity is the main finding. When a large number of atypical lymphocytes are present, exclusion of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma should be considered. A more characteristic feature of EBV hepatitis is the beaded sinusoidal lymphocytic infiltration in a single-file pattern 17 (Fig. 38-1) . Additionally, a variable degree of bile duct damage can be seen in most cases, although the mechanism is unknown. Small epithelioid granulomas can be seen, which, together with the biliary histopathologic features and biochemical cholestatic pattern can mistakenly lead to a false diagnosis of primary biliary cholangitis. The diagnosis of EBV hepatitis requires a high index of suspicion and confirmation with ancillary tests, such as in situ hybridization and polymerase of reduction of immunosuppression, 19 followed by additional therapies such as anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (rituximab) if no response is observed.",

Typical vesicular lesions occur in 30% of cases; thus the diagnosis should not rely on their presence. 33 Before the institution of antiviral prophylaxis, HSV hepatitis after solid-organ transplant was noted within 20 days after transplant (earlier than for CMV disease) and was associated with disseminated infection in most of the cases. 35, 36 The serum aminotransferase levels can be elevated 10 to 100 times the normal effects resulting from the triggering of immunologic phenomena or transactivation of other herpesviruses such as CMV. Hepatitis from HHV 6 and HHV 7 has been described most commonly in liver transplant recipients. The liver test values are elevated in a mixed pattern. 53 HHV 6 may also be associated with liver allograft rejection 54 and increased mortality. 55 HHV 6 has been associated with reactivation of HHV 7, CMV, 56 and invasive fungal infections. 57 Diagnosis is best established by PCR techniques or shell-vial cultures. Serologic tests are of limited value because of high seroprevalence in the general population, cross-reactivity, and diminished serologic reactivity in immunosuppressed individuals. 58 Treatment includes active antiviral agents as in CMV infection, such as ganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir.",

HHV 8 is the etiologic agent of Kaposi sarcoma, body cavity lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman disease. The exact mode of transmission of HHV 8 remains unclear. Potential modes of transmission include saliva, sexual transmission, blood transfusions, and solid organ transplant. The prevalence of HHV 8 infection in the United States is unclear but recent studies estimate a rate of 30% in blood donors 59 and up to 56% in HIV-seropositive subjects. 60 Kaposi sarcoma is classically associated with AIDS, as it is 300 times more common in AIDS patients than in other immunosuppressed hosts. However, it is increasingly recognized as a complication of solid organ transplant (incidence of 0.4% in the United States), 61 with the highest rates in liver transplant recipients. 62 Kaposi sarcoma represents 5.7% of malignancies after transplant. 63 Hepatic involvement is not common with primary infection, which typically manifests as a mild febrile illness, lymphadenopathy, and rash. However, liver nodules can be part of the multiorgan involvement of Kaposi sarcoma, or rarely the first manifestation of the disease. 64 The manifestations include characteristic dark-red nodules present on the skin and visceral organs. Whorls of spindle-shaped cells with leukocytic infiltration and neovascularization with aberrant proliferation of small vessels are characteristic microscopic findings 65 (Fig. 38-4) .",

Primary HIV infection rarely manifests as self-limited hepatitis, including abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, and elevated levels of serum aminotransferase levels. 74, 75 Severe hepatitis has been more commonly described in children. 76 HIV has been detected in the liver, in the hepatocytes and Kupffer cells. 77 During accelerated viral replication in the context of a low CD4 count, the levels of serum aminotransferases can be highly elevated (>5 times the upper limit of normal) without any other apparent cause. 78 Liver histologic findings are nonspecific but steatohepatitis with a mononuclear/lymphocytic infiltrate is a common characteristic. Immune restoration with HAART and a decrease in HIV load results in normalization of liver test findings. AIDS cholangiopathy is a rare condition characterized by abnormalities of the bile ducts in patients with advanced AIDS and low CD4 count. The hallmark of the disease is the cholangiographic abnormalities, which include papillary stenosis, sclerosing cholangitis, and rarely, biliary strictures, along with a cholestatic serologic pattern. 79 Opportunistic infections with Cryptosporidium parvum, Microsporidium, and CMV are the most common causes but do not account for all causes.

Serum transaminase levels start to rise 48 hours and 72 hours after the onset of illness, before the appearance of jaundice. The degree of liver enzyme abnormalities at this stage may predict the severity of subsequent hepatic dysfunction. 106 Most patients enter the remission phase and recover within 2 days. However 15% of patients enter the intoxication phase, characterized by recurrent fever, hemorrhagic diathesis, and multiorgan dysfunction. This stage has a mortality rate of 20% to 50%. Hepatic injury is reflected by the level of aminotransferase elevation, as high as 2000 U/L to 3000 U/L. 106 The levels are proportional to disease severity. Alkaline phosphatase levels are normal or only slightly elevated, whereas direct bilirubin levels are typically between 5 mg/dL and 10 mg/dL, with higher levels in fatal cases. 107 Hepatocyte apoptosis is a result of direct viral damage to the midzone of the liver lobule, with sparing of cells bordering the central vein and portal tracts 108 (Fig. 38-7) . Autopsy reveals midzonal hepatocyte necrosis with mild nonspecific lymphocytic infiltration and eosinophilic degeneration (Councilman bodies). 109 In the nonfatal cases healing is complete, without residual hepatic abnormalities, although jaundice and liver enzyme elevations can take weeks or months to resolve. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of IgM (determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or ELISA) or virus (determined using PCR or culture) in the blood. Organ biopsy is not recommended because of the high hemorrhagic risk. Treatment is supportive.

Serious adverse reactions to the vaccine include two syndromes, yellow fever vaccineassociated neurotropic disease (incidence 0.8 per 100,000) and yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease (incidence 0.4 per 100,000). 112",

Unvaccinated travelers to tropical regions of sub-Saharan Africa and South America are at risk of infection (1 in 1000) and death from yellow fever (1 in 5000). 104 In 2013 there were approximately 130,000 infections in Africa, including 78,000 deaths. 105 Yellow fever is the prototype member of the family Flaviviridae. The primary transmission cycle involves monkeys and daytime biting mosquitoes (Aedes species in Africa, Haemagogus species in South America). The classic illness is characterized by three stages: infection (3 to 4 days), remission (2 days), and intoxication. Hepatic involvement is apparent at all stages, in varying degrees are among the most virulent human pathogens. Previous outbreaks have been described in Central Africa, until the 2014-2015 Ebola epidemic (caused by the Zaire species of the virus), which was the first to occur in West Africa, and were larger than all previous outbreaks combined. 121, 122 As of June 2015, 27,479 cases were attributed to Ebola virus, including 11,222 deaths. 123 The natural reservoir of the virus is not clearly defined but bats seem to be at least one of the hosts. The virus is transmitted by direct contact with body fluid from an infected animal or blood, body fluids, or skin of patients with Ebola virus disease. Ebola virus may be transmitted though contact with contaminated surfaces and objects. Healthcare workers may be at risk of Ebola virus disease if they are exposed to aerosols generated during medical procedures, although no human cases of aerosol transmission have been reported. 124 Symptoms occur after an incubation period of 6 to 12 days and include fever, vomiting, and diarrhea, followed by a diffuse maculopapular rash in selected cases. Although the infection was previously categorized as a hemorrhagic fever, in the recent West a recovery phase with less than 10% necrotic hepatocytes and hepatocellular mitoses, suggestive of liver regeneration. 116 Laboratory diagnosis of Lassa fever relies on detection of viral antigen or genetic material, or virus-specific antibodies by methods including indirect fluorescent antibody tests, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and conventional and real-time RT-PCR. The challenges of accurate and timely diagnosis revolve around the nonspecific presentation, genetic diversity of virus strains, and lack of a commercially available diagnostic test. 118, 119 Treatment of mild infection is supportive. Intravenously or orally administered ribavirin is effective in patients with high mortality risk (AST level >150 IU/L and high-level viremia), with greater efficacy if it is administered early in the course of the disease. 120 There is no effective vaccine for Lassa virus.",

The two genera Africa epidemic unexplained hemorrhage was noted in only 20% of cases. Hypotension, shock, and death were mostly the results of major fluid losses from gastrointestinal sources. Liver disease is a result of multifocal hepatic necrosis caused by the virus. Aminotransferase elevations (AST higher than ALT, suggestive of concomitant rhabdomyolysis) and mild elevation in alkaline phosphatase level but not in bilirubin level are a characteristic pattern for Ebola virus disease. 125 Most acute infections are diagnosed by viral RNA detection through the use of RT-PCR. The virus can be detected within 3 days after the onset of symptoms. 126 A heightened level of suspicion and risk stratification is crucial for timely diagnosis and management of Ebola virus disease. The treatment is supportive, as there are no approved medications for the treatment of Ebola virus disease and there is no approved postexposure prophylaxis or vaccination. 127",

In most viral infections, liver inflammation is generally a consequence of the immune response to viral antigens rather than a direct hepatic infection. In healthy individuals, systemic viral infections typically manifest as mild derangement of liver biochemistry. When infection occurs in individuals with compromised immunity, such as liver transplant recipients, and individuals with HIV infection or malignancy, it can be associated with substantial mortality and morbidity, including acute liver failure. Treatment of severe hepatitis includes use of direct antiviral agents in select infections, reduction in immunosuppression if applicable, or liver transplantation. Viral hemorrhagic fevers affect individuals irrespective of their immune status and cause liver damage via a direct viral hepatotropic effect.",

Magnetic resonance imaging (A) shows irregular intrahepatic ductal dilatation mainly involving the left liver lobe. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography acquisitions (B and C) detect multiple alternating stenosis and saccular dilatations of segmental portions of the intrahepatic biliary tree. A poorly visualized common hepatic duct is consistent with a stricture, whereas the choledochus appears minimally dilated with terminal tapering (papillary stenosis). (From Tonolini M, Bianco R.
