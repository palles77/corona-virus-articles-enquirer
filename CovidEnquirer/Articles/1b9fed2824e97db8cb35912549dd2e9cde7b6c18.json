In our present study, an epitope-based peptide vaccine against nonstructural protein 4 of beta coronavirus, using a combination of B cell and T cell epitope predictions, followed by molecular docking methods are performed. Here, protein sequences of homologous nonstructural protein 4 of beta coronavirus are collected and conserved regions present in them are investigated via phylogenetic study to determine the most immunogenic part of protein. From the identified region of the target protein, the peptide sequence IRNTTNPSAR from the region ranging from 38-47 and the sequence PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG from the positions of 76-90 are considered as the most potential B cell and T cell epitopes respectively. Furthermore, this predicted T cell epitopes PTDTYTSVY and PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG interacted with MHC allelic proteins HLA-A*01:01 and HLA-DRB5*01:01 respectively with the low IC 50 values. These epitopes are perfectly fitted into the epitope binding grooves of alpha helix of MHC I molecule and MHC II molecule with binding energy scores -725.0 Kcal/mole and -786.0 Kcal/mole respectively, showing stability in MHC molecules binding. This MHC restricted epitope PTDTYTSVY also showed a good conservancy of 50.16% in world population coverage. This MHC I HLA-A*01:01 allele is present among 58.87% of Chinese population also. Therefore, the epitopes IRNTTNPSAR and PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG may be considered as potential peptides for peptide-based vaccine for coronavirus after further experimental study.",

Early on, many of the patients in the outbreak in Wuhan, China reportedly have some link to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting animal-toperson spread.

The 2019-nCoV is spreading from person to person in China and limited spread among close contacts has been detected in some countries outside China. Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. There is currently no vaccine to protect against 2019-nCoV.",

Two complete virus genomes (HKU-SZ-002a and HKU-SZ-005b) are sequenced from 2019-nCoV infected patients [2] . HKU-SZ-002a and HKU-SZ-005b differ from each other by only two bases. One of them is a non-synonymous mutation at amino acid position 336 of non-structural protein 4 (Ser336 for HKU-SZ-002a; Leu336 for HKU-SZ-005b). The amino acid sequence of the N-terminal domain of Spike subunit 1 of this novel coronavirus is around 66% identical to those of the SARS-related coronaviruses, and the core domain of the receptor binding domain of this novel coronavirus has about 68% amino acid identity with those of the SARS-related coronavirus. But the protein sequence of the external subdomain region of receptor binding domain of Spike subunit 1 has only 39% identity, which might affect the choice of human receptor and therefore the biological activity of this virus.",

Positive-strand RNA viruses, such as coronaviruses, can induce cellular membrane rearrangements during replication to form replication organelles which allows efficient viral RNA synthesis. Nonstructural Protein 4 alone induces membrane pairing in infectious bronchitis virus [3] . Infection with coronavirus causes rearrangement in the host cell membrane to accumulate a replication and transcription complex in which replication of the viral genome and transcription of viral mRNA can occur. For coronaviruses, a major pathogenicity factor has now been identified with non-structural protein 1 in a murine model of coronavirus infection [4] . Sakai et al in 2017 [5] highlighted the role of nsp4 of SARS coronavirus in viral replication. It has been discovered that only a change in two amino acids in nsp4 protein sequence can abolish viral replication completely. So, to prevent coronavirus infection by designing vaccine, nonstructural protein 4 of beta coronavirus can be selected as target protein in this study.",
