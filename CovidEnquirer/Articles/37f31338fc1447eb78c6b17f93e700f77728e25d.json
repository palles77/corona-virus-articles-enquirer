In this study, a data set containing 2.3 million lead-like molecules and a data set of all the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs are virtually screened for potential Mcl-1 ligands using Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID 2MHS. The potential Mcl-1 ligands are evaluated and computationally docked on to three conformation ensembles generated by normal mode analysis (NMA), molecular dynamics (MD), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), respectively. The evaluated potential Mcl-1 ligands are then compared with their clinical use. Remarkably, half of the top 30 potential drugs are used clinically to treat cancer, thus partially validating our virtual screen. The partial validation also favors the idea that the other half of the top 30 potential drugs could be used in the treatment of cancer. The normal mode-, MD-, and NMR-based conformation greatly expand the conformational sampling used herein for in silico identification of potential Mcl-1 inhibitors.",

To inhibit anti-apoptosis (ie, promote apoptosis) and interfere with tumor cell survival, several small-molecule drugs that mimic pro-apoptotic BH3 proteins were developed. 3 The BH3-mimetics include ABT-737 4 and its orally available derivative ABT-263. 5 These BH3-mimetics bind selectively to Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w and interfere with cell survival; however, they do not bind to Mcl-1 and some cancers cannot be treated by these compounds alone. To complicate things further, upregulation of Mcl-1 is a key factor in the development of resistance to ABT-737 and ABT-263. 2 Thus, there is an unmet need to design ligands, and in particular new small molecules, that inhibit Mcl-1. 6 Mcl-1 is a major cancer target, and Mcl-1 overexpression is often encountered in human cancer. 7, 8 Mcl-1 overexpression has been reported in breast cancer, 9 lung cancer, 10 prostate cancer, 11 pancreatic cancer, 12 cervical and ovarian cancers, 13 and leukemia. 14 Mcl-1 overexpression leads to resistance against Bcl-2-selective inhibitors and other smallmolecule drugs used in chemotherapy. 15 Remarkably, in vitro inhibition of Mcl-1 overexpression through RNA silencing inhibits tumor growth 16 and abolishes chemoresistance. 17 As such, Mcl-1 represents a promising cancer target.",

Furthermore, unrestrained MD simulations can move conformations previously not amenable to docking into the predictive range. 21 To assist virtual screening, several studies have also used normal mode analysis (NMA). 22 NMA is one of the standard techniques for studying long-time dynamics and, in particular, low-frequency motions. 23 In contrast to MD, NMA provides an analytical and fully detailed description of the dynamics around a local energy minimum, 24, 25 and the conformation ensemble is generated by perturbing the initial structure along a set of relevant low-frequency normal modes.",

AutoDock Vina was applied once for each Mcl-1 protein conformation, but by sampling multiple conformations, the signal-to-noise ratio of true positives is expected to increase. Ligands with low standard deviation of binding energies usually have few rotatable bonds, are rigid, and sometimes symmetric. For example, dihydroartemisinin and artemeter are rigidified by the polycyclic skeleton, whereas carbofenotion contains a C2 axis of pseudosymmetry. Contrarily, ligands with high standard deviations are highly flexible. The standard deviation is an indicator of entropy, and the more conformations a ligand may adopt, the more receptor poses are possible. Often, drug candidates with low standard deviation are preferred as binding is confined, but not always.",
