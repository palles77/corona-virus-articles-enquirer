This is because intact antibodies are large and flexible molecules which are rather difficult to crystallize (Harris et al., 1992) (Figure 1 , opposite). Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies have shown that antibody Fab fragments are multimeric proteins consisting of light (L) and heavy (H) polypeptide chains appearing as four homologous globular domains, organized in pairs, that share a common 3-D arrangement. The \"immunoglobulin\" fold consists of two antiparallel P-sheets formed by three and four antiparallel strands in the constant light (CL) and heavy (CHI) domains, and five and four antiparallel strands in variable light (VL) and heavy (VH) domains. These are connected by loops showing a conserved topology (for reviews, see Amzel and Poljak, 1979; Davies and Metzger, 1983; Alzari et al., 1988; Davies et al., 1990) . The specificity of immunoglobulins is determined by the amino acid sequences of three hypervariable loops of both the heavy and the light chains of a variable domain. These CDRs occur at the extremities of the molecule, fully exposed to solvent, where they form the antigen binding site. Using the techniques of molecular biology it is also possible to produce, by expression in bacteria, only VH-VL domain pairs, called Fv. Utilizing this system it is possible to perform site directed mutagenesis, and selectively change amino acids forming CDRs, and monitor the binding capabilities of new antibody combining regions.",

Ribbon representation of the structure of the murine antibody against canine lymphoma determined by X-ray analysis of the triclinic crystals. The heavy chains are shown in yellow and blue, while the light chains are in red. The Fc stem of the molecule projects towards the viewer and assumes an asymmetric, oblique orientation with respect to the Fabs. This orientation illustrates the vast difference in hinge angles of about 65\u00b0 and US''. One of the Fabs is viewed along the axis through the switch peptides. This Fab has an elbow angle of 143\u00b0, in contrast to the other which has an elbow of 159\u00b0. several plausible explanations for this: a) there are structural differences that occur at the combining site of the idiotopic D1.3; b) the open loop structure of anti-idiotypic antibody's CDRs may not be able to mimic the partly ahelical conformation of the lysozyme epitope recognized by the idiotopic D1.3; and, c) the potential for anti-idiotopic mimicry is reduced because of only partial overlap between the paratope and the idiotope of D 1.3. In addition, anti-idiotopic antibody E225 has a con-siderably lov^er affinity for D1.3 (2.0 x lOVM) than the original lysozyme antigen (1.4 x 107M).",

This analysis was the first to visualize molecular mimicry of the external antigen (lysozyme) by an anti-idiotypic . Stereo view of the structure of the two 2-fold related mAb GH1002 Fab molecules reveals \"head on\" positioning of variable heavy and light chains with respect to the corresponding subunits of the other molecule along the direction of p strands. The Fab molecule is in magenta (light chain) and dark blue (heavy chain). The 2-fold axis crosses between the two Fabs approximately in the plane of the paper (panel A). Molecular surface of the Ab3-Ab3 complex demonstrates tight interaction between the two molecules. The orientation and color scheme is the same as in panel A (panel B). Figure 8 . Stereo view of the combining site of anti-anti-Id mAb GH1002. The 2-fold axis of symmetry is approximately in the plane of the paper and vertical. This makes atoms on the left side of the image interact with atoms on the right side of the image of the two identical, 2-fold related, molecules. In panel A, all atoms are shown as space filling models. There are 116 van der Waals contacts and 13 probable hydrogen bonds. Twelve groups involved in hydrogen bonding are labeled to facilitate identification of contact points between the two Fabs. The hydrogen bond acceptors are labeled with red and donors with blue. Threonine labeled with magenta is interacting with itself and can be either donor or acceptor. In panel B, this region is buried upon complex formation. The surface is color coded according to the distance between two molecules in the complex. antibody (E5.2). The mimicry is achieved by extensive overlap between the paratope and the idiotope of D1.3. Virtually the same residues of idiotypic D1.3 are involved in binding the original antigen and the anti-idiotope. Furthermore, there is a considerable similarity in the nature of the interactions of the idotypic Dl .3 in the antigen-idiotype and the Id-anti-Id complex, and the affinity of the E5.2 for the D1.3 of 1.4 X lOVM approaches the affinity between the antigen and D1.3 of 2.7 x lOVM.",

The E2 peplomer was chosen as an antigen because it is responsible for: a) the binding of virus to plasma membranes of susceptible cells, b) cell fusion, c) induction of cell-mediated cytotoxicity of infected cells, and d) induction of neutralizing antibody (Sturman and Holmes, 1983) . This virus, antigenically similar to other coronaviruses, including human coronavirus 229E (Pedersen and Black, 1983) , produces a fatal disease in both wild and domestic cats that has defied conventional vaccines (Escobar et al., 1992) . A salient observation was that anti-idiotypic antibody 409.5.3 raised against Abl 730.1.4, when injected back into mice, elicited the production of Ab3 antibodies that had FIP virus neutralizing properties. This indicated that the combining properties of the original epitope were transmitted by the Ab2. (38) . Loop H3 has 12 amino acids and forms a long hairpin structure that extends towards L2 and LI on the light domain. Two ridges on the surface of the combining site are formed by LI, L3 and H3 on one side and HI and H2 on the other. Four hypervariable regions of the Fab2 can be classified as belonging to the canonical structures L2j, L3^, HI J and H2^ (Chothia et al, 1989) . Even though loop HI can be classified as Hl^, it has a conformation different from the canonical structure: the side chain of residue Phe 27 is buried within the framework structure instead of residue Phe 29 in the canonical structure model. On the other hand residue Phe 29 of this loop is oriented towards the V^-V^ domain interface and partially buried. Sequence analysis of the Fab2 indicated that the LI region belongs to the mouse kappa light chain subgroup IV (Kabat et al., 1991) . This loop has 10 residues and main chain atoms of residues 25-27a and residue 33 follow the canonical structure model. Hydrophilic serines between residues 29-31 form a turn that is one residue longer than the turn in the LI^ loop of HyHel-5. Loop H3 of Fab2 has 10 amino acids and forms a broad turn stabilized by a hydrogen bond between the side chain of Arg 94 and the carbonyl oxygen of Phe 97. The Fab2 CDR's surface is undulating, with no deep grooves as are observed when the antigen is a small molecule (Davies et al., 1990) . A shallow cavity exists between the LI, H3 and H2 loops.",

            "text": "It may be noteworthy that a comparison of the sequences of the three light and three heavy chain CDRs with the known sequence of the antigen shows homology in two instances. In both LI and HI there is near identity with sequences of six residues that occur in the antigen. The LI CDR sequence is Val-Ser-Ser-Ser-Ile-Ser, which differs with the segment on the E2 peplomer beginning at position 276 having sequence Ile-Ser-Ser-Ser-Ile-Ser by the conservative substitution of valine for isoleucine at the first position. Similarly, the HI loop is Gly-Phe-Thr-Phe-Asn-Asn, which matches the Gly-Phe-Ser-Phe-Asn-Asn sequence of the antigen beginning at residue 1451. Here again, only the conservative change from serine to threonine marks a difference. These two regions of homology on the anti-idiotope provide important contacts with the idiotypic antibody originally produced in response to antigen. Homologous residues on LI of the anti-idiotope are involved in 36 van der Waals contacts and two hydrogen bonds, and those on HI form 18 van der Waals contacts and the one hydrogen bond presented in Table l .D (pp. 30-31) and in Figure 5 (below). The possibility exists, therefore, that antigen sequence information determining specificity may in fact be preserved through the idiotypic antibody and be made to reappear in the structure of the anti-idiotypic response.",

The surface of the interface may be described as circular with a diameter of approximately 35 A and a small cavity in the center, presumably occupied by water molecules. Hypervariable loops of two Fabs in contact through van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonds are: LI, L2, L3, HI, H2 (minor contributor), heavy chain FR3 and H3 (65 atoms). Loops LI and L2 on one Fab are in contact with loops LI and L2, on the other molecule, while heavy chain FR3 provides 17 van der Waals contacts and three hydrogen bonds, binding primarily to the same framework element of the symmetry related molecule. In total, 23 residues of the anti-anti-Id mAb participate in 116 van der Waals interactions <4.11 A (Table 1 .E, pp. 30-31). The interaction is further stabilized by 13 probable hydrogen bonds.",

The extensive and intimate contact, judged according to buried surface area, hydrogen bonds, and van der Waals bonds are not consistent with the more tenuous crystal packing interactions usually observed. Interactions are very tight and comparable to those seen in antibody-antigen complexes. In spite of the fact that antibodies and particularly Fab fragments are becoming the most studied family of proteins (Davies and Chacko, 1993; Padlan, 1994) , similar self-interaction has never been reported. Furthermore, the original antigen for this anti-anti-antibody is the CDR region of another antibody (anti-idiotypic MK2-23). It is possible that the interaction between the anti-antiidiotypic mAb GH1002 and the anti-idiotypic MK2-23 involves certain framework regions. These regions are likely to be similar for the two antibodies, and could be the basis for the self-recognition of GH1002 in the crystal.",

Because it would be immunologically fiitile to prolong an anti-idiotypic cascade indefinitely, evolution of a cascade toward selfneutralization would provide a mechanism for modulation and ultimate termination. Indeed, isologous interactions based on dyad symmetry are usually the basis for energetically favorable protein-protein interactions in oligomers (Monod et al., 1965; Morgan et al., 1979) ; Id-anti-Id complexes of Fabs already possess pseudo dyad axes, by virtue of the roughly collinear disposition of Fabs, relating framework portions of the molecules Ban et al. 1994; Evans et al., 1994; Fields et al., 1995) , and the only parts of the antibody subject to change in an anti-idiotypic series, and therefore capable of exerting self regulation, are the CDRs.",
