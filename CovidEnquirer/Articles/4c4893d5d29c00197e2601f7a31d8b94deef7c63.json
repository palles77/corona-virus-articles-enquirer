The computed results of the pollutant diffusion around a typical Hong Kong high-rise building model (at a linear scale of 1:30), were found to show a similar trend to the outcomes of self-conducted experimental measurements that the pathways of pollutant migration for windward and leeward pollutant emission are different. For the case with windward pollutant emission at the 3rd floor within a re-entry, the pollutant migrated downwards due to the downwash created by the wind. In contrast, for the case with leeward pollution emission, dispersion is dominated by intense turbulent mixing in the near wake and characterized by the upward migration of the pollutant in the leeward re-entry. The simulated results of haze-fog (HF) studies confirm that the pathway of pollutant migration is dominated by windestructure interaction and buoyancy effect only plays a minor role in the dispersion process.",

Poor quality air promotes the spread of respiratory and other communicable diseases (Portney and Mullahy, 1990) , and even results in serious cardiovascular diseases (Brook et al., 2004) , particularly for the very young and very old, and people with chronic diseases and those with immune deficiency. The alarming progressive degradation of air quality worldwide is attributable to the growth of manufacturing and resource industry in East and South Asia to meet the burgeoning demand for goods and services by a growing affluent population, a lack of control of air pollution caused by fossil fuel combustion to meet the demand for energy and the inadequacy of air ventilation in urban area where a large proportion of the world population reside (Alejo et al., 2010; Lu et al., 2012) . Evidently, building arrays and street canyons have an undesirable impact on the ground level wind flow, air ventilation within the urban fabric, as well as the dispersion of air pollution; however windestructure interaction which governs the effects of buildings on atmospheric flow is often not properly considered when making urban development and urban planning decisions (Abd Razak et al., 2013) .",

For instance, after the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong in 2002, many researches have been reported to address the mechanisms of disease spreading. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether buoyancy effect or wind flow plays the more significant role (Niu and Tung, 2008; Yip et al., 2007; Zhou and Jiang, 2004; Li et al., 2005) .

One of the advantages of wind tunnel test is that model testing in a wind tunnel produces a set of physical data. The physical data are reliable provided that the test processes and measurements are undertaken in accordance to established experimental methods. However, there are also obvious limitations of physical wind tunnel test: the building models must be scaled down to fit in the wind tunnel, which creates low resolution of the measurements; and the boundary effect of the wind tunnel cannot be fully eliminated from the test. Although the physical measurements obtained in a wind tunnel model test are reliable, a scaled model is not a true reproduction of the real world. The need to satisfy the governing scaling and similitude requirements, such as Reynolds Number and Froude Number scaling, remains a formidable challenge.",

The calculation domain of a numerical wind tunnel is adjustable and different boundary conditions can be applied so that the boundary effects on the simulations are minimized. If the computational power is large enough to accommodate a proper calculation domain, a numerical wind tunnel can test lifesize objects, so that the scale effect can be minimized.

Most notably the adopted numerical method affects the simulated results, i.e. different numerical scheme, different grid arrangement may make significantly different predictions.",

Therefore, in Li's paper (Li et al., 2006) , it was clearly indicated that a standardized quality assurance procedure is required. Furthermore, Blocken et al.

It is well known that LES and K\u00c0u\u00c0SST models can give better predictions than others, but this is mostly meaningful in flow simulation. It has shown that the widely-used eddy-viscosity models in LES are not able to correctly predict time scales of turbulent mixing (He et al., 2002) and dispersions (Jin et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2008) , which presents a new challenge for adopting LES in the study of pollutant dispersion. Often the improvement offered by these time-consuming models is not significant enough to justify the additional computational time. Furthermore, the measurements taken using conventional chemical probe are not accurate enough to necessitate model predictions of transient flow well in excess of the accuracy associated with physical measurements. Hence a standard k \u00c0 \u03b5 model was employed in the current numerical wind tunnel simulation. The model used in this paper is not dissimilar to that in commercial software, thus providing further advantages in using an in-house code with the self-developed eddy-viscosity models that are convenient to embed in the proposed numerical wind tunnel for this study and for future work.",

The atmospheric boundary layer flow in the wind tunnel was generated by a combination of turbulence generating spires, a barrier at the entrance of the wind tunnel, and roughness elements along the wind tunnel floor upstream of the model. The reliability of the physical wind tunnel modeling has been validated in previous work (Tse et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2013) . A 1:30 scale model was constructed to represent a 10 stories high-rise building of 30 m height in prototype, which has a crucifix shape typical of residential buildings in Hong Kong, as shown in Fig. 1(a) . Each building wing has a \"re-entry\" to comply with building regulation that requires all rooms to be fitted with a window/opening. This cul-de-sac design mostly accommodates kitchens, bathrooms and/or toilets fitted with exhaust fans through which odorous and other contaminated/spent gas/air and steam are emitted into the generally poorly ventilated space bounded by the cul-de-sac. Experiments were conducted to study the pollutant dispersion around this complex building structure. The tracer gas used was air with a 10% propane concentration. The tracer gas was released through a flow-meter at a constant flow rate of 58.5 ml/s, and this flow rate was low enough to ensure that source momentum effects were not significant. The tracer gas was emitted at the same position within the re-entry at 3rd floor, with the emission at either windward or leeward relative to the incident wind direction. Measurement of tracer gas concentration at each floor in the re-entry area was carried out after the wind flow stabilised. Details of the experimental work can be found in one of our previous publications (Liu et al., 2010 ).",

The current study focused primarily on a crucifix-form building with re-entry, and on a plain rectangular building for comparison purposes only. The flow regime around such prismatic bluff bodies with well-defined separation points is dominated by separated flow and the interaction of the separated shear layers with the building afterbody, particularly for the crucifix-form building with re-entry with its more complex afterbody shape. Correspondingly, the pollution dispersion is primarly driven by the windestructure interaction which in turn is characterised by the building shape.",

At a quasi-steady dispersion Phase 3, the pollutant leaves the reentry area and spreads into the surrounding. For Case A with a windward pollution emission at 3rd floor, the pollutant is driven downwards by the downwash, spreads horizontally at ground level to form the horseshoe vortex, and disperses downstream. For Case B with a leeward pollution emission at 3rd floor, the pollutant is driven upwards, discharges onto the roof and becomes entrained into the near wake. This upwards migration of pollutant in the leeward re-entry is consistent with near wake flow regime driven by windestructure interaction described earlier.",

Haze is defined as the unexpected atmospheric phenomenon that leads to weak atmospheric visibility due to the moisture, dust, smoke, and vapor in the atmosphere, while fog is composed of fine liquid droplets suspended in the air near the ground. The formation of HF is a result of long-term air pollution and mostly happens in major cities in the world, thus affects public health of city dwellers. The characteristics of HF are that the source point of the pollutant is generally unspecified (the pollutant could be produced in the city or transferred from other places) and the components are uncertain (the aerosol includes both particular matters (PM) and gas-phase precursors such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxides (SOx)).",

The screen shots at 2nd, 4th and 6th second show the pathway of the HF dispersion around the test building. Six seconds after the wind-assisted dispersion commenced, the HF has been completely removed from the windward region of the building. In contrast, it took twice as long, over a period of 12 s, for HF to be evacuated for the leeward near wake region. Evidently, at time 2nd, 4th and 6th second, HF remained within the re-entry area at the leeward face of the building before eventually migrated upward and dispersed, as shown by the indicating arrows. Fig. 8 presents the quantitative HF concentration as a function of time at 3rd, 6th and 9th floor re-entry in both windward and leeward faces of the building. Evidently, HF concentration at 3rd, 6th and 9th floor re-entry on the windward face decreases with time. At 6th second, HF concentrations were reduced to less than 0.5% at all locations. Within the leeward re-entry, HF concentrations fluctuate; within the first 3 s, concentration firstly decreases and then increases. Indeed, at 6th second, HF remains at about 3% at different stories. The variation in HF concentration suggests that turbulent mixing and recirculation within the near wake spread the diluted HF throughout the near wake and also keep the diluted HF entrapped within the near wake for a sustained period, prolonging the exposure of the leeward face of the building, including the reentry, to potentially harmful HF exposure.",
