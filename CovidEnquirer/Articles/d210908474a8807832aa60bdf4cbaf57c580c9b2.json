Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) has been shown to be effective for decontaminating influenza-contaminated FFRs. This study aims to build on past research by evaluating the UVGI decontamination efficiency of influenza-contaminated FFRs in the presence of soiling agents using an optimized UVGI dose. Methods: Twelve samples each of 15 N95 FFR models were contaminated with H1N1 influenza (facepiece and strap), then covered with a soiling agent-artificial saliva or artificial skin oil. For each soiling agent, 3 contaminated FFRs were treated with 1 J/cm 2 UVGI for approximately 1 minute, whereas 3 other contaminated FFRs remained untreated. All contaminated surfaces were cut out and virus extracted. Viable influenza was quantified using a median tissue culture infectious dose assay. Results: Significant reductions (\u22653 log) in influenza viability for both soiling conditions were observed on facepieces from 12 of 15 FFR models and straps from 7 of 15 FFR models. Conclusions: These data suggest that FFR decontamination and reuse using UVGI can be effective. Implementation of a UVGI method will require careful consideration of FFR model, material type, and design.",

            "text": "on NIOSH-approved FFRs should consider hygiene, damage, and breathing resistance, and be replaced whenever they are damaged, soiled, or cause noticeably increased breathing resistance. 12 Implementation of these reuse practices is up to the respiratory protection program's manager and is dependent on the respiratory pathogen's characteristics (eg, route of transmission and severity of illness) and local conditions (eg, number of N95 respirators available and use rate). 11 Among the primary concerns for implementing an FFR extended use or limited reuse policy is the possibility of respirators becoming contaminated and subsequently acting as fomites, potentially spreading the disease. HCWs are well versed in selfcontamination incidents that occurred during the severe acute respiratory syndrome and Ebola virus disease outbreaks and are concerned that extended use of FFRs may lead to self-infection. 13, 14 Although guidance for limited reuse and extended use of FFRs is currently available, implementation of FFR-DR strategies is a more complicated process. For reprocessed single-use medical devices, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires validation data regarding cleaning, sterilization, and functional performance. 15 Cleaning is generally performed before decontamination to ensure soiling materials do not interfere with the decontamination process. The common definition of a cleaned device-no visual contamination is present-differs from the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002, which states that the reprocessor must establish cleaning end points and rationale for their selection. 16 Cleaning FFRs is a difficult task because the N95 facepiece is an exposed filter and not compatible with standard laundering techniques. Additionally, research has been performed demonstrating that several FFR models cannot be effectively cleaned using various cleaning wipes. 17 According to the Institute of Medicine, any method decontaminating a disposable N95 FFR must remove the pathogen, be harmless to the user, and not compromise the integrity of the various parts of the respirator. 18 If the decontamination process can eliminate viable pathogens from the medical device in the presence of other organic material, the question arises of whether cleaning would still be required, especially during a public health emergency.",

            "text": "The study described herein is a continuation of the UVGIbased FFR decontamination research performed by Heimbuch et al 19 in 2011. Although all 3 methods (MGS, MHI, and UVGI) demonstrated >4-log reduction in viable virus, some methods may be better suited for hospital use than others. The MHI method required the longest decontamination time (30 minutes) and the use of an oven set to 160\u00b0F. The MGS method was the shortest decontamination time (2 minutes), but there may be concerns over wattage variability among microwave ovens. Although the UVGI method required a 15-minute decontamination period, this method may be most suitable for large-scale applications due to simplicity of use and ability to rapidly scale. UVGI technologies for whole-room decontamination have already been developed and are commercially available. [24] [25] [26] Despite showing >4-log reduction in viable influenza, some limitations of the study were subsequently identified. The study authors listed the primary limitation as being the low number of FFR models evaluated. Also, the ultraviolet (UV) light dose (concentration \u00d7 time) could likely be optimized for hospital use by increasing the concentration of UV rays (ie, source and distance between the substrate and the UV light source), and reducing the time required to achieve decontamination, making the method more conducive to hospital use by minimizing logistical burden. Additionally, the 2011 study 19 evaluated decontamination efficiency of influenza in the absence of soiling agents (ie, protective factors) that may shield the virus from the decontamination source. During real-world contamination events, influenza virus could very likely be shielded by organic soiling agents like saliva or skin oil, which can inhibit the effectiveness of decontamination techniques. [27] [28] [29] The objective of the current study was to evaluate the UVGI decontamination efficiency of an intact FFR contaminated with both a pandemic influenza strain and a soiling agent to better simulate real-world contamination events. Fifteen N95 FFR models were contaminated with viable H1N1 influenza and either artificial saliva or artificial skin oil, then subsequently treated with UV light and evaluated for remaining viable virus.",

Based on the Fisher et al 23 model predicting influenza contamination levels of FFRs in hospitals from aerosol sources, the highest estimated contamination level (10 5 virus/FFR) would result in a loading concentration of 10 3 virus/cm 2 for a 200-cm 2 FFR, requiring a 3-log reduction to fully decontaminate. The virus loading concentration used in the current study is approximately 100-times higher than the loading concentration resulting from the highest contamination level estimated by Fisher et al. 23 Maximizing the loading concentration is important for laboratory studies in order to generate a measurable log reduction and overcome the virus loss resulting from variable extraction efficiencies of different materials, potential loss of viability due to environmental exposure, and the detection limit of the log-based viable assay (~0.50 TCID50).",

Across the 15 FFR models evaluated for this study there are considerable differences in FFR facepiece design, varying in overall shape (eg, cup, flat-fold, or pouch), material composition, and other design features (eg, pleats and flaps). Variability in design between FFR models has the potential to influence the effectiveness of FFR-DR strategies, making it important to understand which design attributes may be less or more advantageous for a given decontamination method. Reductions in virus viability \u22653 log were considered significant because a 3-log reduction would be required to fully disinfect an FFR contaminated with the highest level of influenza contamination predicted by the Fisher et al 23 model. Significant reductions in influenza viability were observed on both mucin-and sebumsoiled facepieces for 12 of 15 FFR models post-UV treatment. The 3 remaining FFR models-Gerson 1730 (Louis M. Gerson Co, Inc, Middleboro, MA), Sperian HC-NB095 (Honeywell Safety Products USA, Smithfield, RI), and U.S. Safety AD2N95A-still demonstrated statistically significant reductions in virus viability. The facepieces from these 3 FFR models are relatively similar in appearancewhite, cup-shaped, with slightly rough texture. The Gerson 1730 and U.S. Safety AD2N95A facepieces both appear to be hydrophilic, as indicated by the immediate absorption of the liquid inocula, whereas the Sperian HC-NB095 appears to be hydrophobic. Absorption of the viral inoculum away from the surface could potentially limit the UVGI decontamination efficiency because UV light is primarily effective for surface decontamination. Although the Sperian HC-NB095 facepieces did not appear hydrophilic, the relatively low log reduction may be attributed to the presence of horizontal ridges across the front of the facepieces, which may have created small shadowing effects while the mask was exposed to UV light. In general, the presence of shadows indicates the blocking of UV light, thus inhibiting UVGI efficiency. Although the data demonstrate UVGI can be effective, additional research would be required to define how specific FFR design attributes may influence UVGI efficiency, either individually or in combination.",

Significant reductions in virus viability were observed for both mucin-and sebum-soiled straps from 7 of 15 FFR models post-UV treatment, whereas 5 FFR models demonstrated <3-log reductions for both soiling agents. Of these 5 FFR models, 4 models-3M 1860, U.S. Safety AD2N95A, Moldex EZ 22, and Alpha Protech 695-appear to have hydrophilic straps and thus absorption of the virus away from the surface could potentially limit UVGI effectiveness. As with FFR facepieces, shadowing during UVGI treatment could also influence the UVGI effectiveness on FFR straps. The presence of shadows are likely a greater concern for FFR straps than FFR facepieces due to their propensity to twist and orientation based on how much slack is available. Ultimately, FFR straps pose a logistic challenge for UVGI decontamination strategies. This is a significant finding because proper doffing techniques for FFRs require handling of the straps, increasing the likelihood of fomite transfer. Thus, FFRs with straps that are amenable to UVGI disinfection would be preferred. Unlike the facepiece component, straps could potentially be disinfected using a disinfecting wipe or similar approach, but determining the effectiveness of these methods would require additional research outside the scope of this study.",

UVGI effectiveness has been shown to correlate with soil load, decreasing in disinfection efficiency as the soil load increases. 29 As previously mentioned, the levels of sebum and mucin buffer used were intentionally high to act as a worst-case scenario. Pochi and Strauss 35 measured casual sebum levels of 51 male subjects with and without acne to determine a cause-and-effect relationship. They found that subjects with severe acne had a mean density of 0.18 \u00b1 0.08 mg/cm 2 sebum on their face based on the samples taken. Compared with the sebum level of subjects with acne, the sebum challenge used in this study is approximately a 7-fold increase. For mucin buffer, 5 loadings were used for each influenza droplet to provide multilayered shielding against UVGI. Although the level of soiling agents used in this study may be considered excessive and thus a limitation, significant reductions in viable influenza were still observed for both soiling agents, indicating UVGI decontamination of influenza could be performed in the absence of cleaning.",

For the purposes of this study, only the exterior surface of the facemask was evaluated for UVGI effectiveness. If implemented in a hospital setting, a UVGI application would likely need to treat both the interior and exterior FFR surfaces, accounting for potential contamination resulting from either the environment or the user. Additionally, the soiling agents used were artificial and thus a difference in UVGI effectiveness between artificial and natural soiling agents could potentially occur. There was also some loss in viable virus between the inoculation and extraction of control samples. The source of this reduced fraction of viable virus could be attributed to natural decay of the virus or influenced by the material's extraction efficiency; the effect of either factor is unclear.",

This study demonstrates significant reductions in viable influenza under substantial soiling conditions after being exposed to~1-minute UVGI treatment. UVGI-based FFR-DR would allow hospitals to treat FFRs in a quick and efficient manner, benefiting HCWs during a potential influenza pandemic.

Implementation of a UVGI method will likely require careful consideration of FFR material type and design.
