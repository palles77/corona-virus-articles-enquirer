The further study of 5', 3' 89 and intronic sRNAs help rediscover double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) cleavage, RNA interference (RNAi) 90 and the regulation of gene expression, which challenges the classical theories. In a genome-alignment map of sRNA data, there usually are some peaks or hotspots [8] , where the 103 depths of the positions are much higher than those of other positions in the genome. In our previous study of 104 human rRNA genes [6], we found that some of peaks comprised 5' and 3' sRNAs and they were ubiquitously 105 existed in mitochondrial and nuclear non-coding genes. As the current sRNA-seq technologies usually 106 provide sequences with short lengths, 5' and 3' sRNAs are defined as sRNA-seq reads with lengths of 15~50 107 bp, which are precisely aligned to the 5' and 3' ends of mature RNAs respectively ( Figure 1A ) and they have 108 such features: 1) 5' and 3' sRNAs are degraded fragments from mature RNAs and the lengths of them vary 109 progressively with 1-bp differences. 2) The cleavage sites between 3' sRNAs and their downstream 5' 110 sRNAs are not limited to one (usually three) due to inexact cleavage by enzymes ( Figure 1B) . 3) 5' and 3' 111 sRNAs of steady-state RNAs (e.g. 18S, 5.8S and 28S rRNA) are significantly more abundant than the 112 intronic sRNAs of them, while 5' and 3' sRNAs of transicent RNAs (e.g. Internal Transcribed Spacers of 113 rRNA, ITS1 and ITS2) are not. This criterion can be used to identify new steady-state RNAs, which are 114 usually from functional genes. One example of a new steady-state RNA downstream tRNAs and another 115 example of two novel mitochondrial lncRNAs were introduced in the following paragraphs. Particularly, it 116 was proved that MDL1 and MDL1AS were two steady-state lncRNAs in the human mitochondrial DNA and 117 predicted to have biological functions [7] . 118",

However, these authors did not correctly understand the tRFs 163 due to the technology limit and the small dataset size. Using the pan RNA-seq analysis, we proved that the 164 tRF-5 and tRF-3 series were 5' and 3' sRNAs from mature tRNAs and the tRF-1 series were 5' sRNAs from 165 mature RNAs of their downstream genes (Figure 2A) . In this study, 13 mature tRNAs and their 43 166 precursors (Supplementary file 1) were analyzed, and the 5/3-sRNA ratios of them ranged from 0.1 to 167 595.8. However, we did not found the characteristics in the size distribution of 5' and 3' sRNAs from these 168 tRNAs. As 3' sRNAs contain detailed 3'-end information of mature RNAs, we acquired more discoveries 169 related to tRNA processing, maturation and degradation. One example was 3' sRNAs of tRNAs had four 170 types, which were non-tail, C-, CC-, and CCA-tailed. The proportions of these four types were 5.26% 171 (22,906/4,355,95), 12.36% (53,845/4,355,95), 13.81% (60,176/4,355,95) and 68.57% (298,668/4,355,95) .

In our previous study, we annotated two 209 primary transcripts and 30 mature transcripts (tRNA Ile , tRNA Gln AS, tRNA Met , ND2, tRNA Trp , 210 tRNA Ala AS/tRNA Asn AS/tRNA Cys AS/tRNA Tyr AS, COI, tRNA Ser AS, tRNA Asp , COII, tRNA Lys , ATP8/6, 211 COIII, tRNA Gly , ND3, tRNA Arg , ND4L/4, tRNA His , tRNA Ser , tRNA Leu , ND5/ND6AS/tRNA Glu AS, Cytb, 212 tRNA Thr , MDL1, tRNA Phe , 12S rRNA, tRNA Val , 16S rRNA, tRNA Leu and ND1) on the H-strand with 1-bp 213 resolution [7] . In this study, COI and tRNA Ser AS were corrected as one mature transcript COI/tRNA Ser AS 214 that could not be further cleaved. We classified mitochondrial genes into tRNA, mRNA, rRNA, antisense 215 tRNA (e.g. tRNA Ser AS), antisense mRNA (e.g. ND6AS), antisense rRNA and lncRNAs (e.g. MDL1 and 216 MDL1AS) [7] and improved the \"mitochondrial cleavage\" model that had been proposed in our previous 217 study [7] . The improved model is that RNA cleavage can be processed: 1) at 5' and 3' ends of tRNAs, 2) 218 between mRNAs and mRNAs (e.g. ATP8/6 and COIII) and 3) between antisense tRNAs and mRNAs (e.g. 219 tRNA Tyr AS and COI), but cannot be processed: 1) between mRNAs and antisense tRNAs (e.g. COI and 220 tRNA Ser AS) 2) between mRNAs and antisense mRNAs (e.g. ND5 and ND6AS), 3) between antisense 221 mRNAs and antisense tRNAs (e.g. ND6AS and tRNA Glu AS) or 4) between antisense tRNAs and antisense 222 tRNAs (e.g. tRNA Ala AS/tRNA Asn AS/tRNA Cys AS/tRNA Tyr AS). This model provided a framework to identify 223 all the full-length coding and non-coding RNAs of animal mitochondrion with 1-bp resolution. For example, 224 the identification of ND5/ND6AS/tRNA Glu AS, MDL1 and MDL1AS proved that all the reported lncRNAs 225 from ND5, ND6, Cytb [12] or the D-loop region were meaningless fragments from RNA degradation or. 226 All rights reserved.

            "text": "As 5', 3' and intronic sRNAs are accumulated RNA degradation intermediates, they can be used to 254 investigate the RNA degradation [16], particularly for steady-state RNAs. The result using our data showed 255 that in general, 5' and 3' sRNAs were more abundant than intronic sRNAs and short 5' and 3' sRNAs were 256 more abundant than longer ones for tRNAs, rRNAs, snRNAs and mitochondrial RNAs. This suggested that 257 these mature RNAs, particularly short RNAs (e.g. tRNAs), were mainly degraded by 3' and 5' exonucleases 258 to accumulate 5' and 3' sRNAs. As for rRNAs and snRNAs, we found many peaks in the body of genes, 259 which were even much higher than the peaks comprising 5' or 3' sRNAs in the genome-alignment map. In 260 addition, the peaks comprising intronic sRNAs in rRNAs showed tissue specificities. The liver tissue (SRA: 261 SRP002272) had specific peaks at the positions 12,891. The Plasma (SRA: SRP034590) had specific peaks 262 and 10,627. Further study of these tissue specificities was beyond the scope of this study. Then, we focused 274 on the study of the secondary structures around these peaks in rRNAs and snRNAs and found that some of 275 them involved in dsRNA regions. Particularly, we found a featured peak spanning a 43-bp region from 49 276 bp to 92 bp of U1 snRNA (Figure 3) . In this region, 5' ends of most intronic sRNAs were precisely aligned 277 to 49 bp or 78 bp (Figure 3A) . We also found that this region formed a hairpin in the secondary structure of 278 U1 snRNA and produced a series of siRNA duplexes [17] with lengths from 15 bp to at least 25 bp (Figure  279 3C). The most abundant reads AGGGCGAGGCTTATC and TGTGCTGACCCCTGC formed a 15-bp 280 duplex structure. The duplex ratio of AGGGCGAGGCTTATC against TGTGCTGACCCCTGC was 2.15 281 (34,078/15,825) and 99.97% (49,889/49,903) of these duplexes were sequenced from 14 samples of plasma 282 (SRA: SRP034590). It suggested that this dsRNA region was cleaved by the ribonuclease III (RNase III) 283 family [18] to produce these siRNA duplexes and could induced RNAi. Based on the findings in this study, 284 our hypothesis is: 5' and 3' exonucleases are prevalent than endonuceases for the degradation of mature non-285 coding RNAs. So abundant 5' and 3' sRNAs were observed using sRNA-seq data. The longer mature RNAs 286 have more and longer dsRNA regions (e.g. 15-bp long for U1) than short ones (e.g. 7-bp longest for tRNAs) 287 to induce dsRNA cleavage to produce siRNA duplexes. Although the lengths of siRNA duplexes discovered 288 in this study were only 15 bp, we still hypothesized that they could induce RNAi due to the unbalanced 289 duplex ratio 2.15. As RNAi regulate the expression of these genes through a negative feed-back mechanism, 290 we designed preliminary experiments to over-express U1 snRNA in the HEK293 (human), SY5Y (human) 291 and PC-12 (rat) cell lines to prove our hypothesis. The basic idea was that if the negative feed-back 292 mechanism existed, the expression level of U1 snRNA could decrease rather than be stable when the over-293 expression of it beyond a threshold. The experimental results showed that the expression level of U1 snRNA 294 decreased after 4X, 9X and 6X dosage (Materials and Methods) in the HEK293 (human), SY5Y (human) 295 and PC-12 (rat) cell lines, respectively ( Figure 3D) . Particularly, the results in the HEK293 cell line showed 296 a significant effect caused by the negative feed-back mechanism. Therefore, RNAi could involve in the 297 RNA degradation and gene expression regulation of U1 snRNA. 298 299",

However, our finding suggested that RNAi's function in the RNA degradation could be a 307 general mechanism. 308 Based on a previous study, the Rnt1p The ancestral function of RNAi is generally agreed to have been immune defense against exogenous 317 genetic elements such as transposons and viral genomes [20] . However, our findings help rediscover dsRNA 318 cleavage, RNAi and the regulation of gene expression. That is, both of dsRNA cleavage and RNAi are 319 innate mechanisms rather than immune defense mechanisms. Basically, the enzymatic dsRNA cleavage is 320 responsible for RNA processing, maturation and degradation, while RNAi is responsible for RNA 321 degradation. By the degradation of mature RNAs, RNAi of one gene produces siRNA duplexes to regulate 322 expression levels of itself or other genes. Mature RNAs containing more hairpin structures have more 323 chances to induce RNAi, which is more important for highly expressed genes (e.g. U1 snRNA) or virus 324 genes. These genes need RNAi to regulate gene expression though a negative feed-back mechanism. In one 325 of our previous studies, we reported for the first time the existence of complemented palindromic small 326 RNAs (cpsRNAs) and proposed that one cpsRNA from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 327 (SARS-CoV) could induced RNAi [14] . This cpsRNA was detected from a 22-bp DNA complemented 328 palindrome in the SARS-CoV genome. As DNA complemented palindromes are prone to produce dsRNA 329 regions, viruses containing more DNA complemented palindromes in their genomes have more chances to 330 induce RNAi and have more abilities for the regulation of gene expression, which is important for their 331 infection or pathogenesis. 332",
