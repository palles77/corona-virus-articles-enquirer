A beta-lactam-based regimen was considered the preferred treatment in all cases. The mean age of patients was 58 years (range 29e89), with 15 male patients and one female. Twelve patients had lesions consistent with endocarditis on echocardiography and 15 had positive microbiological samples (13 patients with positive blood cultures, one with organisms cultured from pacing wire tips and one with bacterial DNA detected in explanted valvular tissue by broad range 16s rDNA PCR). We estimated the time taken from diagnosis of endocarditis to allergy testing by using the date of the first diagnostic test or, in patients transferred to our centre with a diagnosis of endocarditis, date of admission. It took a mean of five days (range one to eleven). All patients tested negative for IgE-mediated allergy to penicillin on skin prick testing. Twelve patients also underwent oral drug provocation testing (flucloxacillin in seven, amoxicillin in four and co-amoxiclav in one). All but two patients had their antibiotics changed to the recommended first line (betalactam based) regimen following negative allergy testing; one patient had finished their antimicrobial course before undergoing allergy testing and complete antimicrobial records were unavailable for the other. Following introduction of beta-lactam therapy, only one patient developed an adverse reaction (rash). A summary of cases with aetiology and outcome is presented in Table 1 .",

Such a service is also likely to be of benefit in the management of other infections requiring prolonged antibiotic courses, such as bone and joint and vascular graft infections.",

Nose or throat swabs are useful tools for the rapid diagnosis of respiratory viruses using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), 4 especially within the context of Hajj studies, which are generally conducted among pilgrims as they arrive at and depart from the airport. 5, 6 We recently reported the nasal acquisition by French pilgrims of various respiratory viruses, including rhinovirus, 7,8 and influenza viruses, 9 by using RT-PCR. This study aims to compare nasal swabs with throat swabs for the detection of respiratory viruses in pilgrims by RT-PCR methods.",

Each sample was tested independently in a 25 mL reaction containing 5 mL of RNA, 12.5 mL of 2\u00c2 buffer (iS-criptTM One-Step RT-PCR Kit for Probes [Biorad]), 1 mL of reverse transcriptase/Taq, 400 nM concentration of each primer and 160 nM of probe. The reactions were performed using a C1000TM Thermal cycler (CFX96TM Real-Time System, BioRad, Marnes-la-Coquette, France). The following cycling conditions were applied: 50 C for 10 min; followed by 95 C for 5 min; and then 45 cycles of 95 C for 15 s; and 60 C for 30 s. The presence of inhibitors was determined using MS2 and T4 bacteriophage specific detection systems, as previously reported. 10 Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software version 17 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Pearson's Chisquare test and Fisher's exact test, as appropriate, were applied to analyze categorical variables. The PCR results from paired nasal and throat swab specimens were compared using McNemar's test. P values of 0.05 or less were considered significant.",
