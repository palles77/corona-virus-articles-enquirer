The form of the terrorism, the time, and the place will not be of our choosing. Radiology professionals (radiologists, technologists, radiologists' assistants, and nurses) will be involved in caring for the victims of the attack, whether the method employed is chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear. If chemical or biological weapons are used, we must be ready to help with the diagnoses and follow-up care of these patients. Probably the greatest challenges to the radiology community will arise if the terrorist act involves a radiological or a nuclear explosive device. Understanding terrorists' goals of creating pandemonium and causing economic disruption is important. Radiology professionals need to be prepared to be resources for the medical community in providing patient care and for the community at large, especially if the terrorist attack involves detonation of a nuclear device, an attack on a nuclear power plant, or the use of a simple radiation dispersal device in a highly populated area.",

We are reminded by our government and our news media on an almost weekly if not daily basis of the potential for a terrorist attack. Terrorist threats have been broadly categorized by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as national security emergencies to the population at large. These threats, which are posed by either hostile governments or extremists, are grouped by FEMA into broad categories. These include the simple \"threat\" of a terrorist act, the assassination of highlevel officials, kidnappings, hijackings, cyberattacks on our nation's computer-based infrastructure, both bomb scares and actual bombings, chemical and biological attacks, and nuclear and radiological attacks [1] .",

Theretofore, most Americans considered mail delivered by the US Postal Service as safe. They did not seriously consider that the mail could be used as a weapon to attack us with biological agents. Widespread fear and public uncertainty were created. An entire Senate office building was closed for several weeks. Other government buildings, including post offices, were closed.

Their model showed that in addition to the pandemonium created, the economic impact of a bioterrorist attack could range from an estimated $477.7 million per 100,000 persons exposed (B. melitensis scenario) to $26.2 billion per 100,000 persons exposed (anthrax scenario).

You can do it with 10 to 15 people, not all Ph.D.'s, but some engineers, technicians. Our judgement is that a gun-type device is well within the capability of a terrorist organization\" [10] .

First, unlike many civilian industrial facilities, nuclear power plants operationally are protected by complex power plant design safeguards and redundancies in power plant safety systems [11] . Numerous protective measures prevent the release of radioactive material into the environment. Second, extensive security measures designed to thwart terrorist attacks exist at all these facilities. They are often likened to military fortresses. Third, all nuclear material is safeguarded according to federally set guidelines and guidelines set by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Last, all of the material in a power plant is highly radioactive. Handling this material is complex and difficult.",

The second modeled an RDD explosion using a 60 Co pencil in Battery Park at the southern end of Manhattan. These 60 Co pencils, 1 inch in diameter and 1 ft long, are used to sterilize food in processing plants across the country. The third model employed a small source of 241 Am, similar to americium sources found in oil well surveying equipment. This material was modeled being spread from the detonation of 1 lb of TNT at Times Square in New York. Both 137 Ce and 60 Co are high-energy \u2425 emitters. 241 Am is an \u2423 particle emitter [13] .",
