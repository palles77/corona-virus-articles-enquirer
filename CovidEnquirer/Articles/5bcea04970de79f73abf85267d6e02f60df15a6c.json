We empirically investigate the co-movements and the causal relationships among real GDP, tourism development, and the real exchange rate in a multivariate model. We use two different tourism variables-international tourism receipts and number of international tourist arrivals. To employ the unit root tests and the cointegration tests allowing for a structural break, the empirical evidence clearly shows that the causality between tourism and economic growth is bi-directional. Lastly, the international and cross-strait political change, economic shocks, and the relaxing of some tourism control and policies would break down the stability of the relationships between tourism development and economic growth. Overall, we do find the structural breakpoints, and they look to match clearly with the corresponding critical economic, political, or tourist incidents.",

As part of the emerging market in tourism, Taiwan has an abundance and diversity of natural and cultural resources, offering great potential for the development of tourism. The main purpose of this paper is to investigate whether regime changes have broken down the stability of the long-run relationship between tourism development and real GDP in Taiwan. We empirically examine the co-movements and the causal relationships among real GDP, tourism development, and the real exchange rate in a multivariate model. To employ the unit root tests and the cointegration tests allowing for a structural break, the empirical evidence clearly shows that the causality between tourism and economic growth is bi-directional. Moreover, international and cross-strait political changes, economic shocks, and relaxing of some tourism control and policies would break down the stability of the relationship between tourism development and real GDP. Taiwan has always been a great travel destination for business travelers and tourists from neighboring countries. Over the period 1960-2000, total tourist arrivals to Taiwan increased from 23,636 to 2,624,037. International tourism revenue of Taiwan increased from US$ 1.477 million in 1960 to US$ 3.738 billion in 2000 (see Table 1 ). Further analysis of overseas visitors by country shows that came from countries within the neighboring Asian region, which provided nearly 77% of all visitors in 2004. The top five of Taiwan's tourist-source residences in 2004 were Japan, Hong Kong, and Macau region, United States, South Korea, and Singapore.",

Over the late 1970s to the early 1990s, Taiwan faced a turbulent international political relationship and world economic crises, which eroded the growth of Taiwan's tourism development. After the United States Government changed its diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing on 1 January 1979, this policy prompted Taiwan to face a difficult relationship with mainland China and the international community. Only around 30 countries maintain formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan at the moment. Substantial relations between Taiwan and those countries without diplomatic relations were confronted with many challenges, including foreigners applying for visas and the rights of international airlines. This severe international political situation resulted in a prolonged slowdown of Taiwan's tourism growth. The grim situation has also been aggravated by two oil price shocks, occurred respectively in 1973 and in 1979, and the change of Taiwan's exchange rate regime in 1987. Being in the presence of the circumstances, Taiwan's government relaxed some tourism controls and policies to reinvigorate the tourism industry in the stage. First, in the 1980s the government established 6 national parks and 12 national scenic areas. Furthermore, there was the lifting of travel restrictions-for example, the government's institution of a 5-day visa-free entry program for 15 countries in 1994.",

As well as the above tourism polices, the rapid economic growth of the neighboring Asian counties has also fueled overseas arrivals to Taiwan. 1 The fast economic growth rate of Taiwan has also brought more business visitors, which exceeded tourist visitors to become the first group from 1998 to 2000. Another important reason is that the policy for mainlanders visiting Taiwan experienced a gradual door opening from 1988 as there was an initial reconciliation between Taiwan and mainland China.",

Some advantages may vitalize Taiwan's tourism industry in the future. First, the opening up of Taiwan tourism to mainlanders was permitted starting from 2002, which will effectively boost tourism development. After many traditional industries moved into mainland China, tourism development has recently become a major policy in Taiwan for increasing employment and economic growth. For example, the Doubling Tourism Arrivals Policy is proposed by the government of Taiwan. This plan sets to double the number of tourists visiting Taiwan in 2008.",

Secondly, we use Johansen's [25] multivariate cointegrated method to test the cointegration relation between GDP and tourism development. Based on the multivariate cointegration model, we probe into the causality between GDP and tourism development with the weak exogeneity test. Finally, it is possible that structural breaks have occurred which might affect the result of the cointegration test. Using two kinds of Hansen [21] and Gregory and Hansen [18] structural change tests, which to our knowledge has not been previously applied in this area, we examine the cointegration relationship altogether and commented whether there is instability or not between GDP and tourism development.",

Tourism-led growth occurs when tourism manifests a motivating influence across the entire economy in the form of spillovers and other externalities [41, 51] . Balaguer and Cantavella-Jorda [6] examine the role of tourism's long-run economic development in Spain. The hypothesis of tourism-led economic growth was confirmed by applying cointegration and causality tests. Durbarry [12] also supports the hypothesis of tourism-led economic growth by using the cointegration and causality tests to study the case of Mauritius. Some research studies did not arrive at the same conclusion. Table 2 presents previous empirical results between tourism and economic growth, but we still cannot see an explicit result. Nevertheless, different empirical evidence shows different policy implications, which cannot only contribute to distinguishing the innate characters of the tourism industry, but can also be used as the basis for how a government can resolve the symbiosis policies of tourism businesses and economic development [62] . In many countries much hope for economic development is laid on tourism due to its capacity in generating employment. The development of tourism as such mostly requires investment, principally in hospitality, transportation, basic health, and recreation in order to motivate the accommodation and the stay of visitors. Finally, governments have to be active in laying out legislation and ordaining the development of tourism, so that the environment might be preserved and the future of tourism activities might be insured over time [65] .",

The empirical results show that tourism development can contribute to the economic growth of mediumor low-income countries, while such a role is unclear for developed countries. In South Korea, the tourism-led economic growth hypothesis did not hold according to the research of Oh [51] , which studies the causal relations between tourism growth and economic expansion. This research obtains the one-way causal relationship of economic-driven tourism growth. Kim et al. [28] examines the causal relationship between tourism development and economic growth in Taiwan.

The lag order of models is selected based on the modified Akaike information criteria (MAIC). In order to take into account this possible shift in regime in the unit root test, Zivot and Andrews ( [67] ; hereafter ZA) and Perron [52] develop a new category of tests that allows an endogenous structural break. Two tests are allowed for a unit root against the alternative of a trend stationarity process with a structural break. We adopt the Akaike information criteria (AIC) to select the model and the lag lengths for the ZA [67] and Perron [52] tests. Fig. 1 plots the actual values of these series, indicating that the entire series exhibit trends. Consequently, all unit root test regressions are run with a constant and trend terms. We find the results of unit root tests without structural change which indicate that different tests may yield contradictory results. 6 Except for the PP test in LTOUR2, all other statistics are not able to significantly reject the null of the unit root. Furthermore, the DF-GLS and MZ GLS \u03b1 indicate 5 Hakkio and Rush [19] pointed out that when using monthly or quarterly data in an empirical analysis, increasing the number of observations does not add any robustness to the results. 6 We do not report the details of all of the unit root tests we use here in order to conserve space, but all results are available upon request. that all difference variables do not reject the null hypothesis of I(2), apart from LRQ that are integrated with order one. However, the two tests by the ZA and Perron approaches point out unanimously that all variables are I(1). Also noteworthy is that the ZA test results indicate that the breakpoint occurs in 1992 for real GDP, in 1965 and 1966 for tourism development variables, and in 1987 for the real exchange rate. We find critical economic and tourism incidents for Taiwan that can match with the structural breaks of these series. First, what caused the breakpoint of real GDP in 1992? Due to the collapse of Taiwan's bubble economy in 1990, the asset markets went bust, the stock price index sank from around 12,000 to under 3000 in half a year, and the real estate market became sluggish if not outright collapsed.",

The bi-directional causality between tourism and GDP in the long-run, which indicates the level of economic activity and tourism development, mutually influences each other in that a high level of economic growth leads to a high level of tourism development and vice versa. This suggests that tourism and GDP are endogenous and therefore any single equation forecast of one or the other could be misleading [59] . This is different from the empirical results of previous related literature in studying the causal relationship between tourism and economic development, such as Balaguer and Cantavella-Jorda [6] , Durbarry [12] , Eugenio-Mart\u00edn et al. [16] , and Oh [51] -all of who obtain the one-way causal relationship of economic-driven tourism growth. 8 It is now extensively accepted that the relationship between economic and financial time series are mainly nonlinear. 9 Non-linear dependence may exist if tourism, real income, and the real exchange rate are generated by non-linear processes-this hypothesis is theoretically plausible and empirically substantiated. Several studies investigate the tests of non-linear causality relations, such as Baek and Brock [5] and Hiemstra and Jones [22] . Baek and Brock [5] show that the linear Granger causality tests have low power against the non-linear alternatives. However, any test based on the assumption of linearity fails to find any non-linear dependence. Savit [56] indicates that the difference between the linear and non-linear adjustments to any deviation from the equilibrium lies in whether or not the size of adjustment is proportional to the deviation. A proportional adjustment means a linear relationship, but this kind of adjustment cannot cause the randomness observed in financial and commodity markets.",

Consequently, it is important to check the cointegration relationship for structural breaks. 10 In this context, Hansen [21] proposes three tests (L c , MeanF, and SupF) for parameter instability based on the full modified statistics. When the constant term is included in the specification, the data do not support the parameter stability. These tests show signs of instability. 11 Furthermore, Gregory and Hansen ([26] , henceforth GH) provide an alternative approach with tests that are based on the notion of regime change and are a generalization of the usual residual-based cointegration test. GH consider three alternative models-a level shift (model C), a level shift with trend (model C/T), and a regime shift that allows the slope vector to shift as well (model C/S). GH have developed versions of the cointegration ADF tests of Engle and Granger [14] , as well as the Z t and Z \u03b1 tests of Phillips-Quliaris [54] , whereby all of them are modified according to the alternative considered. Taking into account that the date of the change is unknown, they compute the values of ADF * t = inf \u03bb \u2208 J ADF t , Z * t = inf \u03bb \u2208 J Z t , and Z * \u03b1 = inf \u03bb \u2208 J Z \u03b1 . GH test provides clear evidence of not finding cointegration even when we allow for a structural break in the relationship between LY, LTOUR1, and LRQ. However, the relationship between LY, LTOUR2, and LRQ reveals a structural break in ADF * and Z * at the 10% level. According to the ADF statistic criterion, the structural break years estimated on the basis of the three models are mainly in 1980 and 1983. The structural break years of 1980 and 1983 were caused by the following: first, the oil price shock of 1979, which preceded economic recessions and decreased tourism activities. Second, another shock was the change in international political relationships. As with the descriptions of the last section, in 1979 the United States changed its diplomatic recognition from Taiwan, and this policy resulting in Taiwan facing difficult international and cross-strait political relationships. This severe international political situation prompted a prolonged slowdown in Taiwan's tourism growth. Finally, the adjustments of tourism policies also created some effects. In 1980, the Statute for the Development of Tourism was amended to encourage the construction of international tourist hotels. Moreover, the first management offices of the national scenic area administration were set up in 1982.",

Reviewing the investigation of past empirical literature [23, 42] , the above disasters indeed struck Taiwan's international tourism industry in the short run, but in the long run these disasters did not generate structural breaks as our empirical results present. After the 921 earthquake in 1999, the Tourism Bureau of Taiwan implemented a series of measures to help the island's tourism industry recover. The Tourism Bureau assisted in reconstructing public facilities under relief loans for tourist industries. More international promotions were carried out to attract foreign tourists [23] . After facing the detrimental effects of SARS, Taiwan's government launched a US$ 75 million promotional campaign to recover from the devastating impact of SARS on the tourism industry [42] . In the long run, the prompt and effective efforts of Taiwan's government have helped the tourism industry to recover and have concurrently improved Taiwan's awareness around the globe. These efforts avoided sapping Taiwan's tourist development in the long run. 12",

We empirically reexamine the long-run co-movement and causal relationship between real GDP and tourism development in a multivariate model.",

The empirical evidence was based on an elaborate methodology, by first identifying the full systems model. Then, it was reduced to the single equation framework. Finally, testing was done for the structural break with unknown timing. This paper demonstrates the following empirical results. First, it indicates that all variables have the phenomena of a breakpoint. The breakpoint in 1992 was for real GDP, because of Taiwan's collapsing bubble economy in 1990. With the end of the U.S. aid program in Taiwan in 1965 plus Japan relaxing its ban on overseas travel in 1964, there was a breakpoint of tourism development variables in 1965 and 1966. The breakpoint of the real exchange rate in 1987 was due to the government of Taiwan releasing foreign exchange controls and altering its foreign exchange rate system.",
