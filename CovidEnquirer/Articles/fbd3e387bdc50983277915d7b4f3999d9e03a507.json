This first step was rapidly followed by the development of vaccines, either inactivated or attenuated, specifically directed against canine parvovirosis. Some situations are more problematic when facing the outbreaks of diseases caused by viruses showing broad antigenic diversity such as Foot-and-mouth disease virus or Bluetongue virus; in this latter case it is even more difficult due to the fact that the infection is transmitted by a Culicoides vector from the family Ceratopogonidae (biting midges). It took two years in Northern Europe before inactivated vaccines against serotype 8 of Bluetongue virus were available [3] . In Northern America, the spectacular spread of West Nile virus infection, another vector transmitted disease, in humans and horses, was rapidly followed by the development of several vaccines, including a DNA-based vaccine for horses. One solution to be ready to vaccinate in face of an outbreak of a re-emerging infection is to stockpile vaccines as exemplified by Foot-and-mouth virus vaccines as concentrated antigens. Stockpiling is also envisaged for the possible pandemic of avian influenza H5N1 in humans [4] (pandemic pre- * Tel.: +33 1 44151859; fax: +33 1 42670987.",

Moreover, viruses have co-evolved with their natural hosts, often leading to unapparent infections.
