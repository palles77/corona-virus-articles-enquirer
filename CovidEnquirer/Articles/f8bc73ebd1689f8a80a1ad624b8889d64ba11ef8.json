Additionally, the maternal mortality ratio declined from 111\u00b70 deaths per 100 000 livebirths in 1990 to 21\u00b78 per 100 000 livebirths in 2015, 1 achieving MDG 5 on target.

They used data from China's national Annual Report System on Maternal and Child Health to analyse the progress made in achieving MDG 5 and the level and trends of maternal mortality ratios across China from 1996 to 2015, including inequalities. Overall, maternal mortality ratios declined substantially and rapidly, from 108\u00b77 per 100 000 livebirths in 1996 to 21\u00b78 per 100 000 livebirths in 2015, making the annualised rate 8\u00b75%.

            "text": "Nevertheless, an urgent unmet need remains to improve upfront therapy for the remaining patients with CD30-negative peripheral T-cell lymphoma, for whom outcomes remain suboptimal with CHOP and CHOP-like therapies. As our knowledge of the disease biology improves, the heterogeneity of the molecular and genetic landscape in peripheral T-cell lymphoma is becoming increasingly apparent. Further optimisation of therapy in peripheral T-cell lymphoma is therefore likely to be achieved through incorporation of rational targeted therapies in biomarker-selected populations, as in the ECHELON-2 trial. 14 To this end, the importance of international collaboration in clinical studies will be key to further improving outcomes in this rare disease entity. county level. However, at the provincial level, trends in inequality varied, showing much smaller inequalities within provinces than between provinces. This disparity illustrates the substantial geo graphical inequity of maternal health in China. The Chinese Government has taken a series of actions to eliminate disparities in maternal health. For example, the programme Reducing Maternal Mortality and Eliminating Neonatal Tetanus, which was launched in 2000, was mainly targeted at rural areas, especially poverty-stricken areas. After years of effort, the urbanrural disparity of maternal mortality ratios in China has been greatly narrowed. In 2000, the maternal mortality ratio was 29\u00b73 deaths per 100 000 livebirths in urban areas and 69\u00b76 per 100 000 livebirths in rural areas, giving an urban-to-rural ratio of 1:2\u00b737. By contrast, in 2015, the maternal mortality ratio had declined to 19\u00b78 per 100 000 livebirths in urban areas and 20\u00b78 per 100 000 livebirths in rural areas, reducing the urbanto-rural ratio to 1:1\u00b705. 3 Because of socioeconomic imbalance between regions, however, health inequity is still substantial in China. 4 As noted by Liang and colleagues, 2 191 counties had maternal mortality ratios greater than the target in SDG 3. Most of these counties were in poor rural areas in western China. If as well as maternal mortality ratios, the rate of decline in these ratios in the western regions is taken into account, the gap has been gradually shrinking. From 1990 to 2015, the total maternal mortality ratio in China declined by 4\u00b742 times, while that in Tibet declined by 7\u00b712 times, catching up with the national average maternal mortality ratio. 5 Since the start of the 21st century, China has taken targeted measures to help people lift themselves out of poverty, improving women's status and education equity, which will all contribute to the improvement of maternal health. 1 China's health reforms since the severe acute respiratory syndromes epidemic have greatly strengthened the health system in the western regions. However, improvements were mainly made in health financing and improving infrastructure, and development of the health workforce has lagged behind. 6 In 2016, the total number of health-care institutions was similar in the eastern (0\u00b735 million) and western (0\u00b731 million) regions, but the health workforce, especially the number of health technicians, was much higher in the eastern region (3\u00b77 million) than in the western region (2\u00b72 million). Due to the shortage of health-care workers, there is a gap in the quality of health between the two regions. 7 This is a challenge for China on the way to achieving universal health coverage.",

However, a question worth exploring is whether it is appropriate to calculate and compare maternal mortality ratios by county. The population differences between provinces in China are large, and between counties are even greater. The largest county in China has a population of 2\u00b744 million, while the smallest has a population of less than 10 000. The number of livebirths in the small counties can be less than 200 per year. 8 Many of the small counties are located in the western regions. Thus, the maternal mortality in these counties can be very unstable from year to year, which should be considered when drawing conclusions from Liang and colleagues' research.",

[6] [7] [8] [9] Moreover, lenalidomide maintenance also prolongs overall survival, reducing risk of death by approximately 25%. 9,10 Prolonged use of lenalidomide, however, is associated with increased risk of cytopenias, diarrhoea, thromboembolic events, and secondary primary malignancies. 10 Furthermore, efficacy in patients with high-risk cytogenetics remains a matter of debate, with a meta-analysis 10 of three randomised phase 3 trials showing no survival benefit in this patient subset. By contrast, the Myeloma XI study 9 showed improved overall survival irrespective of cytogenetic risk, but lenalidomide maintenance did not completely abrogate the inferior outcomes associated with adverse cytogenetic abnormalities. 9 Importantly, the use of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib for induction and as post-transplant maintenance improves outcomes of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, especially those with high-risk features such as del(17p). 11 Longterm bortezomib therapy, however, is limited by neurotoxicity and the inconvenience of subcutaneous administration. Thus, the development of the oral proteasome inhibitor ixazomib represents an important advance.",
