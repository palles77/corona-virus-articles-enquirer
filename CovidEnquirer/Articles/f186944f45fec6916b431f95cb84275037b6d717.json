            "text": "The CD147 receptor plays an integral role in numerous diseases by stimulating the expression of several protein families and serving as the receptor for extracellular cyclophilins; however, neither CD147 nor its interactions with its cyclophilin ligands have been well characterized in solution. CD147 is a unique protein in that it can function both at the cell membrane and after being released from cells where it continues to retain activity. Thus, the CD147 receptor functions through at least two mechanisms that include both cyclophilin-independent and cyclophilindependent modes of action. In regard to CD147 cyclophilin-independent activity, CD147 homophilic interactions are thought to underlie its activity. In regard to CD147 cyclophilin-dependent activity, cyclophilin/CD147 interactions may represent a novel means of signaling since cyclophilins are also peptidyl-prolyl isomerases. However, direct evidence of catalysis has not been shown within the cyclophilin/CD147 complex. In this report, we have characterized the solution behavior of the two most prevalent CD147 extracellular isoforms through biochemical methods that include gelfiltration and native gel analysis as well as directly through multiple NMR methods. All methods indicate that the extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains are monomeric in solution and, thus, suggest that CD147 homophilic interactions in vivo are mediated through other partners. Additionally, using multiple NMR techniques, we have identified and characterized the cyclophilin target site on CD147 and have shown for the first time that CD147 is also a substrate of its primary cyclophilin enzyme ligand, cyclophilin A.",

            "text": "The cellular receptor CD147 (also known as extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer or EMMPRIN) is expressed in nearly every cell type including fibroblasts, 1 platelets, 2 and T-cells 3 where its biological roles include the regulation of multiple protein families. For example, CD147 stimulates the secretion of numerous matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that are responsible for the reconstruction of the extracellular matrix 4 and CD147 has been shown to stimulate secretion of several pro-inflammatory cytokines. 2 In cancer, CD147 overexpression underlies tumorigenesis and CD147-mediated stimulation of MMPs is a critical part of metastasis. 5, 6 Expression levels of CD147 are so high during disease progression that CD147 has been termed a \"biomarker\" for prostate, 7 liver, 8 and gastric cancer. 5 Moreover, in several types of cancer cells, CD147 is released in various soluble forms where it continues to play an active role in stimulating MMP secretion in distal cells. [9] [10] [11] CD147 is also overexpressed in inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) where CD147-mediated MMP secretion leads to the destruction of joint tissue. 12, 13 While CD147 is thought to act as its own receptor, whereby either membrane-bound or soluble CD147 participate in homophilic interactions with membrane-bound CD147 to stimulate intracellular signaling 14, 15 (Fig.  1, mechanism 1 ), a rapidly growing list of CD147 protein interactions has emerged over the last 5 years, suggesting that CD147-mediated signaling may be orchestrated by other proteins. Such protein interactions may include integrins, 16 syndecan-1, 17 and the recently identified enzyme ligands of CD147, the cyclophilin class of peptidyl-prolyl isomerases. 18 Cyclophilins are ubiquitously expressed enzymes that catalyze isomerization of peptidyl-prolyl bonds and regulate a diverse array of protein functions. For example, analogous to methylation and phosphorylation, cyclophilin-mediated isomerization is thought to be the underlying regulatory phenomena of several signal transduction pathways. 19 Similar to their CD147 receptor, cyclophilins are highly expressed in multiple cancers 20 and inflammatory disorders such as RA. 21 In fact, it was within the synovial fluid of RA patients that the prototypical cyclophilin family member, cyclophilin A (CypA), was first identified as an extracellular protein. 22 Later studies showed that CD147 functions as a signaling receptor for extracellular CypA as well as another cyclophilin, cyclophilin B (CypB). 23, 24 Extracellular cyclophilins exhibit cytokine-like properties and mediate numerous intracellular events through their interactions with the CD147 receptor 18, 25 (Fig.  1, mechanism 2 ). For example, CypA displays potent chemotactic activity that is dependent on its interaction with CD147 24 and inhibition of the CypA/ CD147 interaction greatly decreases migration of immune cells to the sites of inflammation in mouse models of such diseases as acute lung injury, 26 asthma, 27 and RA. 28 Moreover, while many viruses utilize host cell CypA for infection, including vesicular stomatitis virus, 29 vaccinia virus, 30 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), 31 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 32 a subset of these viruses has been shown to rely on host cell Both mechanisms stimulate the secretion of MMPs and pro-inflammatory cytokines. These mechanisms include the following: Mechanism 1, CD147 homophilic interactions occur both between neighboring cells as well as soluble CD147 released by cells through several known mechanisms (see the text). Mechanism 2, extracellular cyclophilin enzymes target the CD147 receptor. CD147 Iglike domains, Ig1 (blue) and Ig2 (green), are shown along with the predicted flexible regions (orange) and CypA (khaki). CD147 as well. Specifically, in both HIV-1 and SARS, virus-associated CypA that is \"hijacked\" from a previous host cell and anchored within the viral membrane has been proposed to increase infection by targeting CD147 on a new host cell. In support of such a proposal, specifically blocking CypA/CD147 interactions inhibits infection in cell culture. 32, 33 Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms of cyclophilin/CD147 interactions may have profound therapeutic value with respect to therapies for cancer, inflammation, and viral infection.",

Based on the X-ray crystal structure of the CD147 extracellular region, it was suggested that several crystal contacts persist in solution with subnanomolar affinity, 34 yet there is little biochemical or biophysical data to support such a conclusion. Furthermore, while cyclophilin/CD147 interactions may represent a newly discovered mechanism of signal transduction, whereby cyclophilin-mediated peptidyl-prolyl isomerization of CD147 on the outside of the cell results in a conformational rearrangement on the inside of the cell, direct evidence of such a catalytic mechanism is still absent. The only present support of a catalytic role of CypA in CD147-mediated signaling comes from the use of an active-site mutant, CypA R55A , which was shown to exhibit little activity compared to wild-type CypA. 35 However, the affinity of this same mutant to its substrates is nearly an order of magnitude weaker than that of wild-type CypA, 36 and therefore, the only conclusion that can be drawn is that the interaction is mediated through the CypA active site. Thus, here, we have initiated solution studies to probe both the CD147 homophilic interactions and CD147 interactions with its enzyme ligand, CypA.",

            "text": "By utilizing multiple solution experiments that include nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), we have discovered that the extracellular region of CD147 does not self-associate in the absence of another molecule and that CypA both binds and catalyzes a single site within CD147, Pro211. This residue is predicted to lie just outside of the extracellular membrane. Interestingly, CD147 Pro211 already exists in an inherent cis:trans equilibrium in the absence of CypA, yet CypAmediated catalysis of this site leads to a higher rate of interconversion and likely a higher cis content within the active CypA/CD147 complex than in the uncatalyzed CD147 receptor alone. A similar preexisting equilibrium has previously been observed for the only other two CypA protein substrates studied to date via NMR, that is, the HIV-1 capsid 37 and the interleukin-2 tyrosine kinase (Itk), 19 suggesting that an increase in the cis conformation of a bound substrate may be a general mechanism for CypA-mediated control of protein function. More specifically, our studies here suggest that CypA catalysis, which has been proposed to regulate a cis/ trans \"conformational switch\" inside the cell, 19 may also perform a similar task to CD147 on the outside of the cell. Thus, CypA-mediated peptidyl-prolyl isomerization appears to regulate signal transduction at several levels. Our findings are the first to directly show that CD147 is a substrate of its extracellular ligand CypA and strongly suggest that CD147 homophilic interactions are mediated by another molecule such as a co-receptor.",

The extracellular region of the dominant CD147 isoform (isoform 2, which is CD147 ) contains two Ig-like domains, herein called Ig1 (residues 22-103) and Ig2 (residues 105-205), and each contains two cysteine residues that form a single disulfide bond within each domain. The extracellular region of a less widely found CD147 isoform comprises only the Ig2 domain (isoform 3, which is CD147 94-269 ). The presence of these disulfide bonds was recently confirmed by the X-ray crystal structure of the CD147 extracellular region purified from a bacterial periplasmic expression system that relies on spontaneous folding within this oxidizing environment. 34 However, here we have discovered that both of these isoforms can be readily refolded in their entirety after intracellular bacterial expression to produce soluble proteins (both with and without the signal peptide sequence of residues 1-21, although these residues lead to soluble oligomers). While we can produce many soluble constructs of CD147 that represent different regions of the receptor via our in vitro refolding method (see Materials and Methods), CD147 constructs containing residues 215-229, which correspond to the hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) region, form large aggregates as assessed by size-exclusion chromatography (Fig.  2a, CD147 ). Removal of residues 205-229 that comprise both the membrane-proximal and TM region completely abrogates aggregation (Fig. 2a , CD147 22-269\u0394 \u2122). Refolded CD147 constructs comprising the extracellular Ig-like domains were all found to elute as a single monomeric species on size exclusion and were therefore further analyzed by both SDS-PAGE denaturing gels and native gel analysis below.",

The single disulfide bond within each extracellular CD147 domain was correctly formed by our refolding procedure as confirmed by SDS-PAGE denaturing gels where the presence of dithiothreitol (DTT) reduced each disulfide bond and led to a slower migrating species for all constructs (Fig. 2b) . Furthermore, all extracellular CD147 constructs migrate as a single species on a native gel (Fig. 2c ) and, together with the aforementioned size-exclusion data, suggest that with proper disulfide formation, each Ig-like domain neither self-associates nor interacts with the other Ig-like domain.",

Specifically, our refolded recombinant CD147 stimulates the release of two wellcharacterized pro-inflammatory cytokines in cell culture, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, providing the first evidence that glycosylation of CD147 is not required for cytokine stimulation as has recently been shown for MMP stimulation. 14 However, caution must be taken in assessing the activity of unglycosylated CD147 since the explicit role of CD147 glycosylation is still poorly understood. For example, the unglycosylated form of CD147 has been found to act as an antagonist of MMP induction in some contexts 38 and there is growing evidence that supports the notion that the degree of CD147 glycosylation in vivo regulates its activity. 39, 40 Moreover, \"differentially glycosylated\" does not necessarily imply that CD147 is unglycosylated in vivo and, in fact, there is no evidence to suggest that the soluble CD147 forms released from cells are not glycosylated. Thus, future studies aimed at producing glycosylated CD147 from, for example, mammalian expression systems will allow for a rigorous comparative analysis to our unglycosylated forms probed here.",

Specifically, the previous purification schemes of recombinant CD147 relied on spontaneous refolding in the oxidizing environment of the Escherichia coli periplasm and this likely leads to a small population of incorrectly folded protein, which would be susceptible to intermolecular disulfide formation. In contrast, our in vitro refolding procedure may simply be more efficient since we do not observe such dimers on SDS-PAGE or native gel analysis. However, such cross-linked dimers can still be observed within our protein preparations using Western blot analysis, indicating that even our purification procedure produces trace amounts of this cross-linked dimer, albeit at far lower relative concentrations to the monomeric species (Fig. S2 ). While we suspect that these dimers are simply a by-product of purification rather than a biologically relevant protein, it would be na\u00efve to completely rule out a potential role of disulfide shuffling for CD147 homophilic interactions. However, receptor interactions that rely on disulfide shuffling require other protein interactions such as protein disulfide isomerase 41 and such interactions have not been identified for CD147. Regardless of such hypothetical interactions, our data indicate that the extracellular region of the intact fully folded monomeric extracellular domains of CD147 do not self-associate in the absence of another mediator.",

Since several reports have indicated that CD147 acts as its own receptor analogous to other cellular adhesion receptors, 42 such affinity could potentially be under the detection limit of our native gel analysis performed above. In contrast, NMR solution experiments can be used as particularly sensitive markers of such protein/protein interactions on multiple timescales and are therefore well suited to probe interactions with various affinities. For example, NMR titration experiments offer an obvious means of monitoring interactions that exhibit affinities on the order of the concentrations utilized (micromolar to millimolar concentrations). Additionally, NMR relaxation experiments provide the dynamic details of each residue and, thus, if the individual Ig-like domains of CD147 selfassociate, then this may be detected at atomic resolution. To this end, we have completed the backbone resonance assignments of the extracellular regions of the two most prevalent CD147 isoforms CD147 (isoform 2 comprising both Ig1 and Ig2) and CD147 94-205 (isoform 3 comprising Ig2) in order to characterize CD147 solution properties and its potential interactions at atomic resolution (Supplementary Material, Tables S1 and S2 and BMRB accession numbers 16322 and 7433).",

            "text": "NMR spectra, NMR relaxation experiments, and NMR titration experiments all indicate that the intermolecular contacts observed in the crystal are not maintained in solution. The extracellular regions of both CD147 isoforms give rise to high-quality spectra and are shown here in the context of 2D 15 Nedited heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra (Fig. 3) . While the high dispersion is indicative of characteristically well-folded proteins, the relatively narrow linewidths observed in solution already provide evidence that the four proposed subnanomolar interactions in the crystal do not persist in solution ( Fig. 3a and b, top right). R1 (longitudinal) and R2 (transverse) relaxation rates measured here define the correlation times of each amide and indicate that CD147 residues 22-101 (i.e., Ig1) and residues 105-205 (i.e., Ig2) are independently rotating domains within CD147 22-205 ( Fig. 3a and b , bottom). The correlation time for each domain was calculated from all residues with R2/R1 ratios within one standard deviation using the equation described by Larsson et al., 44 and the differences are immediately apparent in the raw data. For example, the average R2 rates are about 22 Hz for residues 22-101 and 35 Hz for residues 105-205, indicating that these domains exhibit markedly different tumbling times in solution. While these differing R2/R1 ratios are consistent with the two independently folded Ig-like domains found within the X-ray crystal structure, 34 the fact that these domains tumble with different correlation times provides evidence that the inter-domain interactions observed in the crystal are not maintained in solution. In other words, the CD147 Ig1 and Ig2 domains would be expected to exhibit the same correlation time if they self-associated in solution. To rule out the possibility of anisotropic rotation, correlation times for each of the individual domains were also calculated using the FAST-Modelfree (Facile Analysis and Statistical Testing for Modelfree) analysis 45 for each domain with an isotropic model and an anisotropic model. For the anisotropic model, each of the respective domains within the X-ray crystal structure was used. Correlation times calculated using an isotropic model were 11.8 and 14.1 ns for Ig1 and Ig2, respectively, and for an anisotropic model, the correlation time for Ig1 was found to increase slightly to 12.6 ns while the correlation time for Ig2 was the same as that of the isotropic model. Thus, regardless of rotational anisotropy, the major finding from these relaxation experiments is that the tumbling times of the two CD147 Ig-like domains in solution differ by at least 1.5 ns. Consistent with these findings, no chemical shift changes were observed upon a titration of 15 N-CD147 94-205 with stoichiometric amounts of CD147 (Fig. S4 ), thereby proving that these two domains do not interact as separate entities even weakly (i.e., K d \u223c 1.0 mM). Moreover, no concentration-dependent chemical shift changes are observed for CD147 that would be expected to occur if there was even a weaker selfassociation (i.e., K d N 1 mM). Finally, the R2/R1derived correlation times for each domain and the observed linewidths are completely consistent with Fig. 3 . NMR solution studies reveal that the CD147 Ig-like domains do not self-associate or interact with each other. The extracellular regions of the two major CD147 isoforms, (a) isoform 2 (CD147 ) and (b) isoform 3 (CD147 94-205 ), were characterized using NMR solution studies. The particular regions under study are shown using the X-ray crystal structure (Protein Data Bank accession code: 3B5H) with the corresponding 15 N-HSQC spectra and NMR relaxation data. Specifically, amide R1 (red dots) and R2 (black bars) relaxation rates were obtained for both CD147 constructs and used to calculate the correlation times. The extracted correlation times are shown adjacent to each Ig-like domain, Ig1 (blue) and Ig2 (green). Secondary-structure propensities are shown on top of each plot as calculated from our chemical shift assignments with the program TALOS. 43 All data were collected at 25\u00b0C and 900 MHz. monomeric proteins. Thus, the NMR solution data are consistent with the aforementioned native gels that also indicate that CD147 homophilic interactions do not occur through the extracellular region in the absence of another mediator.",

These CD147 residues are predicted to lie at the surface of the extracellular TM region, and some of these residues may even lie within the membrane itself. However, both extracellular cyclophilin ligands of CD147, CypA and CypB, are known to readily traverse the membrane. 20 Upon titration of these latter CD147 comprising residues 206-214 to 15 N-CypA, both CypA amide residues (Fig. 4a ) and the single CypA indole of Trp121 (Fig. 4b) were found to exhibit chemical shift changes that were all localized to the CypA active site (Fig. 4c, left) . Thus, CypA specifically engages CD147 within residues 206-214 through its active site and there is only a single potential targeted residue, Pro211, within this region (Fig. 4c, right) . Furthermore, only a single set of CypA resonances was observed during such titrations, indicating that exchange between the free and bound states is fast on the NMR chemical shift timescale and the affinity of these two proteins is relatively weak. Also in support of such a weak affinity of the CypA/CD147 complex, the measured chemical shift changes were linear over the titration range employed, indicating our inability to fully saturate all CypA binding sites (CD147 constructs were not stable beyond 1-2 mM). Our data therefore imply that the binding affinity of CypA/CD147 is weaker than the highest CD147 concentration used (i.e., K d N 1 mM since 1 mM was our final titration point) and is consistent with the relatively weak affinity cyclophilins have for most of their substrates. 50 Such weak affinity also explains the failure of previous pull-down experiments. 24 Thus, CypA targets CD147 within residues 207-214 specifically but with relatively weak affinity.",

Specifically, we have estimated the affinity of CypA to CD147 residues 206-214 using a peptide, herein called the CD147 10mer (sequence of 205-HLAALWPFLG-214), which corresponds to the CypA target site on CD147. The use of a representative peptide for this CD147 target site was warranted based on both R1 and R2 measurements, since this membrane-proximal region is highly flexible on the fast timescale (Fig. S5 ). In accord with previous studies that have suggested that the CypA/CD147 interaction is of relative weak affinity, a K d of 4.2 \u00b1 0.2 mM was calculated from the binding isotherms between 15 N-CypA and the CD147 10mer (Fig. 5a) . Many more residues exhibit chemical shift changes using this peptide due to our ability to titrate to saturating conditions (Fig. 5b) and, as expected, these perturbations are still confined to the active site, confirming CypA specificity for this peptide (Fig. 5c) .",

Strikingly, a similar preexisting conformational equilibrium has been observed for the two CypA substrates studied to date, the HIV-1 capsid (HIV-1 CA) 36, 37 and Itk. 19 In CD147, the mutation of this proline to an alanine, that is, CD147 P211A , probed in the context of either CD147 or CD147 94-214 , resulted in only a single set of resonances (Fig. S6) , confirming that proline isomerization is the underlying cause of this inherent conformational heterogeneity. Many of the resonances within CD147 P211A also overlapped with those resonances corresponding to the major conformation observed in the wild-type receptor, simultaneously confirming that the trans conformer dominates in the wild-type receptor and allowing us to assign the cis resonances. From the relative peak intensities in wild-type CD147, a cis:trans ratio of 33%:67% was calculated (i.e., 33% of CD147 Pro211 molecules are in the cis conformation), which is about twice the cis content as that of the HIV-1 CA 36 and very similar to that of Itk. 51 Thus, all three CypA protein substrates that have now been studied at the molecular level, that is, the HIV-1 CA, Itk, and CD147, exhibit this intrinsic conformational equilibrium of the targeted proline with an unusually high cis content. Moreover, it is likely that enzyme-mediated catalysis alters these equilibriums (upon complex formation) as described below (see Discussion).",

The fact that two distinct sets of resonances are observed for free 15 N-CD147 residues 207-214 means that the intrinsic rate of peptidyl-prolyl isomerization is slow on the NMR timescale (b0.1 s \u2212 1 ). In contrast, upon addition of stoichio-metric concentrations of CypA, amide resonances within 15 N-CD147 residues 207-214 either converge or are so severely linebroadened that they disappear ( Fig. 5a and b, respectively) . This implies that in the presence of CypA, CD147 undergoes a conformational exchange on both the fast and the intermediate NMR timescale. In other words, the intrinsic interconversion of CD147 Pro211 is higher in the presence of CypA, and therefore, the conformational exchange of peptidyl-prolyl interconversion of Pro211 is enhanced by CypA-mediated catalysis. Those residues that converge undergo \"fast exchange\" and those residues that disappear undergo \"intermediate exchange\".

Specifically, two ZZ-exchange experiments were collected using identical concentrations of 0.5 mM 15 N-CD147 94-214 but with two substoichiometric concentrations of the enzyme (i.e., catalytic concentrations) of 0.01 mM (Fig. 7a) and 0.05 mM (Fig. 7b) CypA. Under each condition, the apparent exchange rate (k ex ), which is the sum of the apparent cis \u2192 trans (i.e., k ct ) and trans \u2192 cis (i.e., k tc ) catalytic rates, was determined to quantify the rate enhancement of CypA-mediated catalysis (Table 1) . Both the raw data and fits are shown for CD147 Trp210 N\u025b1 for all four peaks (i.e., both auto peaks and both exchange peaks), which is adjacent to the catalyzed CD147 Pro211. A verification of our sample preparations is shown by the fact that the maximum cross-peak intensities occur approximately 5-fold apart and corresponds to the 5-fold difference in enzyme concentrations ( Fig. 7a and b spectra shown in center). For example, we observe maximum cross-peak intensities for CD147 exchange peaks at \u223c 240 ms and \u223c 48 ms for the 0.01 mM CypA sample and the 0.05 mM CypA sample, respectively. These data along with all nonoverlapping amides within the CypA target site of CD147 residues 207-214 were used to calculate the apparent catalytic rate constants at each CypA concentration as shown in Table 1 (and for the residue-specific results, see Supplementary Material, Tables S3 and S4). Using our quantitative estimation of the K d for the CypA/CD147 complex derived from our model peptide substrate above, 0.2% and 1.1% complex relative to the free 15 N-CD147 94-214 would exist for 0.01 and 0.05 mM CypA, respectively (see Supplementary Material, Section 2). Thus, extrapolating these apparent exchange rates (Table 1) to the fully bound complex gives approximately 4000-4800 s \u2212 1 for CypAmediated interconversion of CD147 at 25\u00b0C. While this is only a rough approximation of the CypAmediated exchange rate, it is clear that CypA provides a significant rate enhancement relative to the uncatalyzed cis/trans exchange rate of peptidylprolyl isomerization that is less than 0.1 s \u2212 1 . 52 However, this rate enhancement is less than that in our previous study of a model peptide substrate measured at the same temperature. 49 A possible explanation for this lower catalytic rate is that CD147 has a bulky Trp residue preceding the catalyzed CD147 Pro211 (i.e., CD147 Trp210-Pro211) that likely slows the interconversion rate relative to the model peptide substrates. In fact, in a study conducted nearly two decades ago with various amino acid substitutions preceding the catalyzed Pro, the authors found that the Trp-Pro sequence exhibited the slowest k ct rate for human CypA. 53 In conclusion, CypA catalysis serves to increase the uncatalyzed rate of interconversion by at least several orders of magnitude.",

Only single monomeric species were detected for all CD147 constructs that correspond to these extracellular regions as confirmed by gelfiltration analysis, native gel analysis, and multiple NMR solution studies. In regard to the monomeric species, secondary-structure predictions based on our NMR resonance assignments are largely consistent with the X-ray crystal structure of the extracellular region of isoform 2, CD147 , thereby confirming that the solution structure of the monomer is similar to that within the crystal. The only noted difference is that resonances corresponding to CD147 residues 151-159 are not observed in solution, and thus, this region likely undergoes a conformational exchange within the intermediate timescale (relative to the chemical shift differences between sampled conformations). Interestingly, this same region contains one of the three potential N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn152) and implies that inherent flexibility may be important for function. However, there are likely no contacts between the Ig-like domains and no preferred orientation relative to each other as observed within the recently solved X-ray crystal structure of CD147 . 34 Although the conclusions of several recent reports have suggested that a fraction of recombinant CD147 self-associates in solution, 14, 34 there has been no direct proof that such an interaction occurs without mediation by another molecule in vivo (i.e., coreceptors or small molecules). In fact, much of these prior data are in agreement with our findings in this study. For example, there is a major contradiction between the data and the conclusions found within the recently published X-ray crystal structure of CD147 . 34 Namely, these authors have suggested that the four interaction surfaces observed in the crystal give rise to highly favorable interactions with computationally calculated \u0394G values ranging from \u2212 16 to \u221220 kcal/mol (i.e., subnanomolar K d affinities). However, these same authors experimentally show that at mg/ml concentrations of CD147, only a small fraction forms dimers on a native gel, which should all be oligomers if any of their four calculated crystal contacts were truly of submicromolar affinity. Another contradiction in the literature is that the observed dimeric interactions of the extracellular region observed within native gels are abrogated in the presence of reducing agents, prompting some to conclude that this is due to protein unfolding caused by disulfide reduction. 14 However, a similar phenomenon is also observed within denaturing gels, suggesting that the dimers observed are simply intermolecular disulfides formed as a by-product of recombinant protein purification. Moreover, analogous to our findings, other groups have had difficulty in measuring CD147 self-association through its Ig1 and Ig2 domains. 54 Thus, CD147 oligomerization may be a far more complicated process than previously thought and likely involves mediation by other molecules such as a co-receptor to induce signaling (Fig. 8a) .",

Models for both the cyclophilin-independent and cyclophilin-dependent mechanisms of CD147 activity. (a) Based on our findings here that have shown that the extracellular region of CD147 does not self-associate, CD147 homophilic interactions are likely mediated by other molecules that potentially include TM proteins (i.e., co-receptors). (b) The direct observation of CypAmediated isomerization of Pro211 suggests a mechanism whereby CypA may alter the inherent cis:trans equilibrium of CD147 Pro211. The inherent cis:trans ratio of CD147 Pro211 was calculated from the relative peak intensities of the amides of residues 207-214 within 15 N-HSQC spectra, and the cis:trans ratio in the active complex is based on previous studies with a model peptide substrate. 55 Colors are as defined in Fig. 1. tions, it is important to begin addressing likely candidates since CD147 is a high profile player in the progression of many diseases. CD147 oligomerization in cell culture and in vivo may be modulated by small molecules as shown, for example, for cadherin dimerization that is modulated by calcium 56 or fibroblast growth factor receptor interactions that are mediated by heparins. 57 Thus far, we have not been able to identify such smallmolecule interactions that affect CD147 self-association (data not shown), yet many other potential candidates that regulate CD147 homophilic interactions include membrane proteins such as monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), syndecans, and integrins. 42 For example, an elegant fluorescent energy transfer study has revealed a 2:1 interaction between MCT-1 and CD147. 58 However, MCT-1 is predicted to have only short extracellular loops; thus, this TM protein seems an unlikely candidate for mediating homophilic interactions between cells. We have recombinantly expressed the entire extracellular region of syndecan-1, a well-known heparan sulfate proteoglycan that has recently been shown to co-localize with CD147 in cell lysates. 17 While we have discovered that syndecan-1 is primarily an unfolded protein, as expected from its primary sequence (i.e., within its 283 residues, there are 33 threonines, 30 glycines, and 25 prolines), it does not interact with the extracellular region of CD147 (Fig.  S7 ). This may suggest that specifically attached glycans or the TM domains of CD147 and syndecan-1 modulate their interactions, and thus, probing such interactions biophysically awaits mammalian expression systems that produce full-length glycoproteins with relatively high yields.",

Interestingly, this membrane-proximal region of CD147 residues 207-214 already exists in its free form in a cis:trans equilibrium characterized by an unusually high cis content of 33% (Fig. 8b, left) . However, this uncatalyzed cis/trans isomerization is very slow, as evidenced by our observation of both sampled cis and trans resonances for all residues within this region of CD147. Upon addition of stoichiometric concentrations of CypA, 15 N-HSQC spectra collected on the active CypA/CD147 complex showed both the collapse of several cis and trans resonances and severe linebroadening for others, suggesting that a conformational exchange event occurs within the active CypA/CD147 complex (i.e., catalysis). Further proof of catalysis came from several NMR experiments collected under substoichiometric conditions, which unambiguously confirmed that CypA catalyzes CD147 Pro211. Namely, the appearance of exchange peaks in the both ZZ-exchange and 3D-NOESY experiments verifies a CypA-induced rate enhancement of the inherently slow cis/trans equilibrium of CD147 residues 207-214 and, therefore, provides direct evidence of CypA-mediated catalysis of its CD147 receptor. A quantitative analysis of our ZZ-exchange data reveals that the catalysis may be only slightly slower than that of nonnatural substrates previously studied, a finding reflective of the bulky CD147 Trp210 residue preceding the targeted Pro211.",

Based on such evidence, the trans \u2192 cis catalytic rate of CypA has been proposed to be higher than the cis \u2192 trans catalytic rate, 62 and thus, the relative cis population of CD147 within the catalyzed enzyme complex would be higher than that in the free state of CD147. Previous NMR studies that measured linebroadening of a model peptide substrate in the context of substoichiometric amounts of CypA have suggested that the relative cis population on the enzyme is higher than that of the trans population. 55 Finally, previous NMR studies that measured CypA dynamics with saturating concentrations of the same model peptide were also consistent with a higher bound cis population. 63 Thus, for CD147, this would culminate in a reversal of the relative cis:trans populations upon CypA catalysis (Fig. 8b) . Interestingly, a similar conformational switch mediated by CypA within the inside of the cell has also been proposed to regulate signaling. 19 Specifically, the SH2 domain of Itk also exists in an inherently slow interconverting cis/trans equilibrium dictated by a central proline residue and it is the trans conformation that binds a phosphotyrosine target peptide approximately 4-fold tighter than the cis conformation. Since this proline residue of Itk is also a substrate target of CypA, it seems possible that intracellular CypA mediates a similar regulatory phenomenon that we have proposed for CD147. In conclusion, CypA catalysis may regulate a conformational switch both inside and outside of the cell by way of increasing the relative cis:trans ratio of its substrates in the bound complexes (Fig. 8b) .",

Owing to the complex nature of CD147 interactions and its association with multi-protein complexes, at this point, we can only speculate as to how CypA-mediated catalysis may regulate intracellular signaling. For example, while it is clear that cyclophilin/CD147 interactions promote intracellular signaling events, recent data suggest that the intracellular C-terminal region of CD147 is not important for signaling. 64 Thus, analogous to the case of Itk where the conformation of a proline residue dictates its affinity for other proteins, the conformation of CD147 Pro211 may also dictate its affinity for a signaling-competent complex. Unfortunately, identifying such a complex (or complexes) is required to further address both the dynamic and structural changes that ensue upon CypA-mediated catalysis. Finally, although the CD147 Pro211 target site of CypA is predicted to lie outside of the TM and we have found that the inherent cis:trans equilibrium of CD147 is maintained in several different solvents (data not shown), we do not yet know how other protein interactions may alter this equilibrium. Thus, it will be critical to re-evaluate this equilibrium in the context of other protein interactions that will be identified in the future and then address how CypAmediated catalysis alters such interactions.",

THP-1 cells were cultured in RPMI (supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum) and stored at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO 2 at all times. Differentiation of THP-1 cells was achieved by adding 100 nM phorbol-12-myristate-13acetate to 1 ml suspended cells in a 24-well cell culture dish at 1 million cells/ml for 24 h, removing undifferentiated cells by aspiration, washing with phosphatebuffered saline, and then replacing the media. The cells were then incubated with CD147, and cytokines secreted into the media were measured by ELISA. ELISAs were performed under the manufacturer's protocol (ElisaTech).",

(b) Several of the CypAtargeted CD147 residues, such as CD147 Leu213, exhibit severe linebroadening in the presence of substoichiometric concentrations of the enzyme and disappear under stoichiometric concentrations. Thus, relative to the CypA-bound chemical shift differences, the CypA-induced conformational exchange is on the intermediate timescale.
