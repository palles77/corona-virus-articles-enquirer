In mice, marine leukemia virus gp71 covalently linked to its 15,000 dalton transenvelope anchoring protein (gp71-pl5E or gp85) has been shown to he even more immunogenic than gp71 alone (Hunsmann et al 1981) .

It was for these reasons that the following experiments were conducted. In these experiments cats were immunized with inmLmoaffinity colunn purified FeLV-gp70 or chemically purified FeLV-gp85 and then challenged in various ways with virulent FeLV or FeSV. As controls for these studies, cats were either left unimmunized, or were vaccinated with formalin inactivated purified whole FeLV. Formalin inactivated whole FeLV vaccines have previously been shown by our laboratory to be effective irmmmogens in preventing persistent FeLV infection following natural exposure (Pedersen et al., 1978) .

Neutralizing antibodies might be generated only as a result of exposure to larger envelope polyproteins (pre-cleavage products) present in inmature particles and on the cell membrane. The role of cellular immunity in FeLV infection is largely unknown. Passive transfer of immune sera will greatly inhibit the retroviremia that follows experimental infection in cats (deNorohna et al., 1980) , suggesting that humoral immunity is in~ortant in clearance of virus from the blood.

If the current findings and those of Salerno and associates (Salerno et al., 1978) are universally applicable, then the answer seems to be no. It is possible, however, that FeLV-gp70 or -gp85 would induce protective immunity if given in some other form, at some other dose, or with other adjuvants. These possibilities cannot be answered without a great deal of additional research. The point that should not be overlooked, however, is that many researchers have placed great hopes on subunit vaccines produced by genetically engineered bacteria or yeast, or on synthetic oligopeptides.",

To prove that envelope proteins alone were responsible for the protective immunity demonstrated by iscom preparations, cats should be vaccinated with iscoms containing envelope proteins alone.
