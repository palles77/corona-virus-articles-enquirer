In recent years, two seasonal HCoVs have been named NL63 and HKU1 according to the country (e.g., NL = the Netherlands) or the organization (e.g., HKU = Hong Kong University) in which they were identified. The two highly pathogenic viruses, i.e., SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), were named primarily according to the key features of disease caused. [3] The genomic sequences of the new coronavirus are distinct from those of SARS-CoV (approximately 79% identity). [4] Most individuals (approximately 80%) infected with 2019-nCoV develop mild or moderate symptoms and signs and asymptomatic individuals may also be infectious. [5, 6] These may make it hard to control the epidemic. It is highly possible that COVID-19 will eventually evolve into a seasonal epidemic. Thus, the virus causing COVID-19 is largely different from SARS-CoV. To avoid conceptual confusion and considerable public fear associated with SARS, the new coronavirus should not be named SARS-CoV-2.",

One approach may be to name the new coronavirus under the four existing genus, i.e. \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4. [3] For example, the current new name suggested This nomenclature is controversial. Several significant discrepancies between these two viruses should be noted. First, although both viruses may have originated from bats, the intermediate host involved is likely to be different, indicating that the transmission paths are distinct. Second, SARS-CoV results in more than 40% of patients developing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and 10% patient deaths. [9, 10] In contrast, the new coronavirus only leads to SARS in approximately 10% of cases and 3% cases of death, respectively, [11] [12] [13] including all the cases from Hubei province. Third, treatment regimens or vaccines for SARS are not indicated for the new coronavirus. Altogether, there exist significant differences in transmission, pathogenesis, clinical treatment, and vaccine development between these two viruses.",

In more recent times, genetic sequence-based tests have advanced, and such genotyping tests have been able to provide a more rapid and precise typing approach than serological tests. Genotyping provides a new clinical diagnostic tool for directing the use of drugs and the development of vaccines. Based on genotyping, SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to be significantly linked to SARS-CoV. Rather, SARS-CoV-2 may lead to the misunderstanding of the pathogenesis of the new coronavirus, which is less pathogenic compared with SARS-CoV.",

In contrast, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are used to refer to coronaviruses that are highly pathogenic, with non-human animals as their primary natural host. When considering pathogenicity and natural hosts, the new coronavirus fits in between but shares more similarity with the latter. Hence, I would suggest the new coronavirus be referred to as the \"2019 acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus\" (TARS-CoV). TARS-CoV uniquely identifies the new coronavirus from SARS-CoV and is also different from human coronavirus. Accordingly, the disease caused by TARS-CoV should be named 2019 acute respiratory syndrome (TARS).",

Alternatively, the new coronavirus can be named to reflect the WHO's naming of the disease (COVID-19), we can differentiate the new coronavirus according to the year of discovery, e.g., human coronavirus-19, which is similar to the naming of the influenza virus subtype A/H1N1/2009pdm.Jian-QingXu, Professor at Institutes of Biomedical Sciences and Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University. Director of the Shanghai Institute of Emerging and Re-HCoV-19, or 2019 acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (TARS-CoV): A new coronavirus emerged in Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China and then rapidly spilled over to many other parts of China and more than 20 other countries. Recently, the ICTV suggested thatthe new coronavirus be named SARS-CoV-2 because the genomic sequences of the two coronaviruses appear to be similar (approximately 80% homogeneity).[7,8] In addition, this new coronavirus and SARS-CoV of 2003 share similar pathogenesis, both primarily affecting the respiratory system.",
