Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study on 7.347 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus as the principal diagnosis, using hospitalization discharge summary data from January 1 to December 31, 2015. Disease stages were classified as stages 1, 2, and 3. Results: Of 7.347 patients, 16.2% had urinary tract infections. The urinary tract infection prevalence was 24.4% in 428 patients in stage 1 and 4.8% in 2.840 patients in stage 2; it was higher among patients who underwent medical procedures than among those who underwent surgery (24.4% vs 4.8%). In multivariate regression analysis, age (OR = 1.031; 95% CI = 1.02-1.04), length of hospitalization (OR = 1.018; 95% CI = 1.013-1.024), sex (woman) (OR = 2.248; 95% CI = 1.778-2.842), comorbidity of stage 3 cerebrovascular disease (OR = 1.737; 95% CI = 1.111-2.714), and comorbidity of stage 1 colorectal cancer (OR = 2.417; 95% CI = 1.152-5.074) were found to be the risk factors of urinary tract infection in the ten hospitals considered. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that urinary tract infection prevalence was higher in women without evidence of organ injury and those receiving medical treatment. Comorbidities (cerebrovascular disease and colorectal cancer) were identified as risk factors.",

            "text": "In Portugal, urinary tract infections (UTIs) are frequent adverse events during hospitalization (https://apurologia.pt/. A, 2008), for which T2DM is a major risk factor (Wilke et al., 2015; Hirji et al., 2012) . However, the cause of UTI is considered to be multifactorial (https:// apurologia.pt/. A, 2008) . Studies (Wilke et al., 2015; Hirji et al., 2012) have reported that UTI is prevalent in those with diabetes, particularly in older women. Wilke et al. (2015) showed that 3.86% of UTI events were associated with inpatient hospitalization and 35.6% of UTI events were caused by more than one reported bacterium. It is difficult to determine the actual incidence of UTIs in Portugal, but approximately 15% of women aged 70 years have asymptomatic bacteriuria; this rate increases to 30-40% in elderly women admitted to geriatric institutions and practically to 100% in patients with permanent urinary tubes (https://apurologia.pt/. A, 2008). Mazzi et al. (2017) reported that other risk factors, such as severe hypoglycemic events, advanced age, and the presence of comorbidities, may increase the occurrence of infection in diabetes patients. Another study (de Decker et al., 2017) found that a high burden of comorbidities (stroke, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and functional cognitive impairment) increased the risk of hypoglycemic events in elderly patients (aged over 80 years) with diabetes. Mendez-Bailon et al. (2017) studied 715 patients with diabetes admitted for cardiovascular diseases who underwent invasive cardiac procedures, and found that obesity (18%), arterial hypertension (67.3%), lipid abnormalities (45.8%), renal failure (14.07%), and intermittent claudication (1.65%) were risk factors for adverse events during hospitalization.",

The difference in the frequency of UTIs between the type of treatment may be due to the different therapeutic strategies employed; for example, antibiotic prophylaxis was administered in patients undergoing surgery. With respect to the severity of diabetes, we found a higher UTI rate in patients with stage 2 diabetes than that of those with stage 1 diabetes (4.8% vs 24.4% respectively; OR = 0.16), contradicting previous studies (isk Factor Collabora, 2016; Ljungqvist et al., 2005) . Increased hyperglycemia may occur after surgical stress (Ljungqvist et al., 2005) , and, thus, our results may indicate a non-effective glycemic control in those with stage 1 severity of diabetes. Typically, patients with diabetes are only diagnosed with UTI during their first hospital visit in the health services of the Portuguese National Health System because of the gap in follow-up of these patients in primary care (Sociedade Portuguesa de Diabetologia, 2015) .

Some hospitals do not observe safety protocols in the insertion, maintenance, and aseptic removal of devices and do not comply with guidelines for the prevention of UTIs, such as the assessment of the need for catheterization (based on individual risk); do not select the type of catheter according to the predicted duration of catheterization; do not implement prevention and control policies for asymptomatic bacteriuria; and do not follow clinical practice guidelines for managing hospitalized patients with diabetes who have UTIs. With respect to sex, women were at a higher risk of UTIs than men (OR = 2.248), consistent with other studies (Popejoy et al., 2017; Costantini et al., 2017) .

Therefore, random audits of medical processes have caused better handling of medical data, in Portugal. Third, we do not know if the cause of UTIs was preventable or not. Lastly, this study has all the limitations and risks of bias inherent to cross-sectional study design, thus limiting the generalizability of the conclusions to other populations. Given the increasing incidence of T2DM worldwide, particularly in Portugal, diabetes-specific healthcare guidelines during hospitalization are needed, and the number of physicians and nurses in primary care should be increased to meet the increased need for proper management of comorbidities, in order to avoid more hospitalizations.",

Our findings suggest that women in stage 1 of T2DM have the highest prevalence of UTIs and those who have received medical treatment with fewer comorbidities. More effective health policies should be implemented to manage T2DM, particularly in stage 1 disease. Home visits by primary care physicians and nurses are crucial for those with limited healthcare access for better diabetes management and for reducing admission rates. In hospitals, health professionals should control hyperglycemia before and after medical treatments and should adopt safe protocols to reduce UTIs. Further, health education on diet and nutrition should be provided to reduce comorbidities due to increased risk for UTIs. This study can be beneficial for risk stratification of these patients and for the early identification of those at higher risk of infection, and the findings can be used to implement optimal healthcare measures to prevent UTIs.",
