This association enabled public health official to identify the source of human contagion and isolate the causative agent, known now as Nipah virus, a name denoting the location of the case from which the virus was first isolated. 6 Infection control measures, including the slaughter and disposal of \u03fe1 million pigs, contained the disease; during this outbreak, human-to-human transmission of Nipah virus was not observed.",

In 2001, and again in 2004, Nipah virus encephalitis reemerged, this time in Bangladesh. 8 Bats in the region of the Bangladesh outbreaks were found to harbor Nipah virus, suggesting that they again served as the original source of infection; however, in contrast to the Malaysian outbreak, pigs did not participate in the transmission of the virus to humans. Rather, contact with sick humans was strongly associated with contracting Nipah virus encephalitis, and the Nipah virus was isolated from samples of human urine. Now, human-to-human transmission of Nipah virus was occurring.",

The Nipah virus had apparently existed endemically for some time among fruit bats in the remote rainforests of Malaysia and other parts of Asia. In the late 1990s, the bats' natural habitat and food supply were disrupted when millions of acres of rainforest were cleared for human use. Some biologists have theorized that the clearing of the land and the haze caused by the fires used to clear the land forced the bats to search for new sources of food. 9 The bats began to colonize the fruit trees planted by humans and fertilized by the pig manure from the farms that had replaced the forests. 9 Pigs raised on these farms became infected with Nipah virus and ultimately passed the virus to humans. By infecting and replicating in humans, the virus adapted to a new host, and because humans lacked previous exposure to the virus, Nipah encephalitis, a severe potentially fatal disease, was the outcome.",

Bats worldwide harbor several ancient coronaviruses and appear to serve periodically as the source of human viruses, including the coronavirus causing subacute adult respiratory syndrome. 11 Events that facilitate host switching, such as changes in the ecology of potential vectors or modifications in virus genes or proteins, enable viruses to infect and replicate in additional animal species, including humans. Other notable examples of host switching leading to human disease include Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, Lyme disease, Ebola hemorrhagic fever, dengue fever, and HIV/AIDS.",

            "text": "West Nile Virus Epidemiology First isolated from humans in Uganda in the 1930s, West Nile virus emerged in Egypt and Israel in the 1950s 12 and rarely caused recognized human disease. West Nile virus circulates in bird-mosquito cycle, involving rural or urban wild birds and Culex or Aedes mosquitoes. Beginning in the mid-1990s, human outbreaks became more frequent, and fatal cases began to appear in Israel, Algeria, and Romania. 13 Mutation of the virus genome leading to enhanced virulence for humans was suspected. In 1999, West Nile virus infections occurred in the United States, marking the initial appearance of the virus in the Western hemisphere. A virus closely related to a West Nile virus strain that had been identified in the Middle East in 1998 caused 7 deaths during an encephalitis outbreak in the New York City metropolitan area. 14 In 2000, West Nile virus activity was detected in 12 states surrounding New York State, and by the end of the following year, West Nile virus had infected persons in 27 different states and in the District of Columbia. 15 Because mosquitoes and birds in North America had no previous exposure to West Nile virus, the infection spread rapidly, resulting in a massive human outbreak in 2003 that affected nearly 10,000 US inhabitants from New York to California. Only 2 western states (Oregon and Washington) did not report West Nile virus activity in that year. 16 By 2009, nearly 30,000 cases of West Nile virus-induced human disease had been reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings include leptomeningeal enhancement and subtle abnormalities of the thalamus and brainstem, especially on T2-weighted or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences. 23 Treatment, Prevention, and Prognosis Treatment of neuroinvasive West Nile virus infections consists of supportive care; no currently available antiviral drugs have proven efficacy against West Nile virus. Control measures include the personal use of mosquito repellants, avoidance of outdoor activities during nights and evenings when mosquitoes are most active, and mosquito-abatement programs. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), an effective insect repellant, be avoided in infants \u03fd2 months and that DEET concentrations not exceed 30% in lotions or sprays used by infants and children. 24 Persons with West Nile virus-induced meningitis and encephalitis gradually recover, whereas patients with limb paralysis usually have permanent deficits. 17 ",

Although most persons with chikungunya gradually recover, mortality rates of up to 33% can be observed among the elderly. 30 Dengue Virus Epidemiology Dengue fever, also known as \"breakbone fever\" because of the intense myalgias, arthralgias, and bone pain experienced by persons with the disease, results from infection with 1 of 4 related RNA, arthropod-borne Flaviviruses (dengue virus serotypes 1-4) endemic to Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, Indonesia, and South and Central America. 33 After the initial transmission from monkeys to humans during the past 800 years, dengue virus infected humans infrequently. The events of World War II facilitated transport of mosquito vectors into historically nonendemic regions, and during the past 60 years, dengue has emerged throughout the tropical and subtropical world. 33 In the US, dengue cases have been observed in Puerto Rico, considered an endemic location, and recently in Key West, Florida, and along the Texas-Mexico border. 33 The Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes serve as the virus reservoirs and transmit the virus to humans during a blood meal. Persons of any age living in endemic regions and travelers to these regions are at risk of infection. More than one-third of the world's population lives in endemic regions, and as many as 100 million people experience dengue fever annually. In endemic areas, outbreaks of dengue occur annually, particularly during warm, humid, and rainy seasons, conditions that favor mosquito proliferation. 33 Because infection with 1 virus serotype does not confer immunity to the other virus serotypes, humans can experience recurrent dengue fever. Although as many as one-half of dengue virus infections produce no symptoms or signs, severe dengue fever causes several thousand deaths annually worldwide. 33 ",

Older children or adults can have more severe illness with high fever, myalgias, retro-orbital pain, bone pain, arthralgias, nausea, vomiting, petechiae, and a diffuse erythematous maculopapular rash. 33 Persons with dengue hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome, the most severe form of dengue virus infection, have hepatomegaly and hemorrhage, including epistaxis, gingival hemorrhage, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage, disseminated intravascular coagulation, plasma leak, and shock may be fatal during this phase. Neurological complications, uncommon manifestations of dengue fever, include altered mental status, seizures, and focal neurological signs or, rarely, GBS. [34] [35] [36] Diagnosis The diagnosis of dengue fever can be established by isolating dengue virus using cell culture methods, detecting viral RNA in serum, plasma, or CSF by using RT-PCR, or identifying dengue virus specific IgM and/or immunoglobulin G in serum obtained during the acute and convalescent phases of infection. 33 CSF examination may demonstrate lymphocytic pleocytosis and protein elevation, and MRI may show areas of increased T2 signal, especially in cases of dengue virus-induced acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Patients with dengue virus-induced GBS may show an albuminocytologic dissociation and abnormal electrophysiologic studies. 36 Treatment, Prevention, and Prognosis Currently available antiviral agents are not effective against dengue virus; treatment consists of supportive care and fluid resuscitation. 33 Because of the potential for hemorrhagic disease, acetominophen should be used to treat pain and fever, and ibuprofen, aspirin, and naproxen should be avoided. 33 Dengue virus infections can be prevented by mosquito abatement and personal use of insect repellants, especially DEET. Although most cases of dengue fever are mild, as many as 25,000 deaths are attributed annually worldwide to dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome.",

Humans serve as the primary source of infection and transmit the parechoviruses in stool, saliva, and respiratory secretions. 39 Most infections with parechoviruses occur in young children, and by adulthood, virtually all individuals in many regions possess serological evidence of previous infection. 38 Human parechoviruses have been detected in monkey feces, suggesting that monkeys may serve as a zoonotic reservoir. 40 ",

Infections with serotypes 1 2, 4, 5, and 6 have been associated with fever and mild gastrointestinal or respiratory illnesses in young children. 41 In contrast, serotype 3 has been linked to severe, sepsis-like disease and meningoencephalitis in neonates. 42, 43 Infants with human parechovirus disease can exhibit fever, seizures, irritability, abdominal distension, and erythematous rash, clinical features that can be indistinguishable from neonatal enteroviral infections. 42, 44 Diagnosis The diagnosis of human parechovirus infection can be established by detecting parechovirus RNA in saliva, respiratory secretions, feces, or tissues using RT-PCR. [42] [43] [44] [45] Sequence analysis of viral RNA or serologic methods can be used to identify parechovirus serotypes. Infants with parechovirus meningoencephalitis may have CSF pleocytosis or periventricular white matter abnormalities detected best by MRI. 42, 43 Treatment, Prevention, and Prognosis Parechovirus infections cannot be treated with any of the currently available antiviral agents. Mild childhood infections require no treatment; infants with severe disease require supportive care. Infants with severe neonatal parechovirus infections and meningoencephalitis can have permanent sequelae consisting of cerebral palsy and developmental delay. 42, 43 Death in association with pediatric parechovirus infections has been reported, although the role of parechovirus in the deaths of the infants described in 1 report is uncertain. 45 ",
