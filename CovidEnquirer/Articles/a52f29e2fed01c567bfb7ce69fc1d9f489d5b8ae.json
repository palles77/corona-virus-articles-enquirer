Proactive infection control measures with an emphasis on timely education of health care workers and hospitalized patients about directly observed hand hygiene along with active surveillance, opportunistic \"added test\" screening, rapid laboratory diagnostics, appropriate patient isolation and decolonization, and extensive contact tracing for potential secondary cases were performed to minimize the risk of outbreaks in our hospital between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2014. The infection control team, composed of 1 infection control officer and 7 infection control nurses, conducted syndromic surveillance and monitored the detection of hospitalacquired microorganisms, defined as a positive microbiology test on specimens collected after 48 hours of admission, via a computerized surveillance system that is connected to the microbiology laboratory database. A clustering report is generated by the computerized surveillance system when 3 or more microorganisms are isolated in the same ward within 7 days. The retrospective surveillance period could be extended further if the microorganism has a longer incubation period. A hospital outbreak was defined as 3 or more patients acquiring epidemiologically important agents after 48 hours of hospitalization in the same ward. Epidemiologically important agents were classified into 4 categories: respiratory viruses (influenza A virus, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and rhinovirus), gastrointestinal pathogens (norovirus, rotavirus, and Clostridium difficile), MDROs (VRE, carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, multiple-drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, and MRSA in pediatric and neonatal units), and miscellaneous pathogens of known epidemiologic significance (eg, scabies).",

Each hospital network is led by the biggest acute regional hospital, such as Queen Mary Hospital leading the Hong Kong West network, and hospitals A1 (another tertiary referral hospital), B1, C1, D1, E1, and F1 of comparable bed numbers leading networks A, B, C, D, E, and F, respectively. The characteristics and services provided by the 7 acute regional hospitals are listed in Table 1 . When an outbreak occurs, the hospital infection control officer is required to notify the Hospital Authority and the Centre for Health Protection, Department of Health. Upon receiving an outbreak notification, a press statement is released and simultaneously uploaded to the public domain of the Hospital Authority website. The infection control performance of Queen Mary Hospital and Hong Kong West hospital network was analyzed with respect to the overall performance of the 7 regional hospitals and hospital networks. All acute regional hospitals and hospital networks had similar staff ratios in infection control: 1 infection control nurse per 250 beds. They do not implement similar proactive infection control measures but follow the Hospital Authority guidelines with regard to standard and transmission-based precautions for the prevention of nosocomial transmission of infectious diseases. Using the hospital outbreak episodes per 1 million patient discharges and per 1 million patient-days as benchmarks, the performance of all public hospitals in regard to outbreak prevention can be measured.",

In other words, Queen Mary Hospital has more medical staff per 1,000 beds compared with the regional average, but the differences in nursing staff allotted per 1,000 beds was not significantly different between Queen Mary Hospital and the regional average. Proactive infection control measures are performed by the infection control team of Queen Mary Hospital (Table 2 ). 4,7-16 After implementation of hand hygiene practice using alcohol-based handrub, the overall hand hygiene compliance was 66.4% in 2010, 76.3% in 2011, 78.6% in 2012, 75% in 2013, and 76.2% in 2014. Except for the infection control program for MRSA and C difficile described previously, 12,13,17 322 episodes of nosocomial cases without clustering or with clustering of <3 cases were investigated in Queen Mary Hospital. Two hundred fifty-five of 322 episodes (79.2%) were due to viruses, whereas 67 episodes (20.8%) were due to MDROs. Respiratory syncytial virus (61 episodes, 18.9%), parainfluenza virus (59 episodes, 18.3%), norovirus (47 episodes, 14.6%), influenza A virus (31 episodes, 9.6%), and VRE (28 episodes, 8.7%) constituted 70% of sporadic nosocomial cases.

In our analysis of hospital outbreaks in 7 local hospital networks over 5 years, one-third of outbreaks occurred in extended-care units because patients in these units had a longer length of stay and tended to be more dependent on nursing care. Transmission of epidemiologically important pathogens may occur when there is a lapse in hand hygiene and other infection control practices. Influenza A virus was the most common agent causing outbreaks in extended-care units, which corroborates previous findings. 21 Our hospital network, Hong Kong West network, had the lowest number of hospital outbreaks in terms of per million patient discharges and patient-days. Because the patient case mix of the 7 hospital networks in Hong Kong may be different, we attempted to assess infection control performance using number of hospital outbreaks per 1 million patient discharges and patient-days among the biggest acute regional hospitals, which are comparable in annual discharges within each hospital network.

Group 1 is the index case. Group 2 comprises of patients who have been exposed to the index case. outbreak-prone divisions in the hospital such as pediatrics and infectious disease services, all acute regional hospitals provide pediatric service, and Queen Mary Hospital has the highest number of pediatric beds. Infectious disease services are provided by all 7 acute regional hospitals, whereas 1 acute regional hospital, Hospital B1, is designated for admission of the first few cases of any emerging infectious diseases with high mortality such as avian influenza and SARS-CoV. However, after the outbreak of SARS-CoV in 2003, airborne infection isolation rooms were built in all acute regional hospitals for preparedness for emerging infectious diseases, but these isolation beds are used for patients requiring contact precautions even when there is no emerging infectious disease outbreaks. Queen Mary Hospital has a significantly lower number of isolation beds for general infection control purposes. Despite these factors, Queen Mary Hospital achieved almost zero hospital outbreaks during a 5-year time period with the implementation of proactive infection control measures, and our outbreak episodes per 1 million patient discharges and patientdays was 16 and 15 times lower than the benchmark, respectively, among 7 acute regional hospitals in Hong Kong. It is very difficult to minimize the number of hospital outbreaks over a sustained period, and 322 episodes of nosocomial-acquired cases were detected during the 5-year period through our syndromic and computerized surveillance system that allows early detection of the first hospital-acquired case. Nonetheless, only 1 cluster of 5 patients with respiratory syncytial virus was observed during our study period. Therefore, the low number of hospital outbreaks most likely reflects the effectiveness of our timely implementation of enhanced infection control measures in response to the first patient, as illustrated in Table 3 , instead of a failure to detect outbreaks. This surveillance system also worked well at the time of an unprecedented outbreak of SARS-CoV in 2003. Out of 386 infected health care workers in Hong Kong, only 2 (0.52%) were from Queen Mary Hospital. 22 We speculate that our practice of daily monitoring of microbiology laboratory data to identify the first hospital-acquired case, proactive approach to perform timely education of health care workers by the infection control team at the bedside, environmental disinfection, priority use of single-room isolation, and implementation of \"exit entry control\" directly observed hand hygiene of hospitalized patients by health care workers, appears to be effective in terminating nosocomial transmission of epidemiologically important pathogens. 4,7-9,13,23 Among these measures, provision of timely education by our infection control team, in particular, empowers frontline staff to comply with hand hygiene and infection control practices. We promoted our proactive infection control measures to other public hospitals in the third quarter of 2013, which may explain the overall reduction in hospital outbreaks in 2014.",
