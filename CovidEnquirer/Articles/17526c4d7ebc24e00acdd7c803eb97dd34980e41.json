To understand the parameters that enable RNAi activity in vivo, it is necessary to develop a systematic approach to identify which cells within a tissue are permissive to oligonucleotide internalization and activity. In the present study, we evaluate the distribution and activity within the lung of chemically stabilized siRNA to characterize cell-type tropism and structure-activity relationship. We demonstrate intratracheal delivery of fully modified siRNA for RNAi-mediated target knockdown in lung CD11c + cells (dendritic cells, alveolar macrophages) and alveolar epithelial cells. Finally, we use an allergen-induced model of lung inflammation to demonstrate the capacity of inhaled siRNA to induce target knockdown in dendritic cells and ameliorate lung pathology.",

When delivered systemically, siRNA formulated within a lipid nanoparticle or carrying a hepatocyte-specific targeting ligand can trigger near-complete and highly specific mRNA silencing of numerous targets in the liver at well-tolerated doses. [2] [3] [4] For certain indications, local delivery of siRNA (e.g., mucosal, intraocular, intrathecal) may be more desirable than the standard intravenous or subcutaneous administration, as it may enable higher oligonucleotide concentrations in relevant tissues and protection from systemic nucleases. 5, 6 However, previous studies on local siRNA administration have yielded variable and unpredictable results, limiting its clinical relevance. These confounding results arise primarily by the need to achieve sufficient metabolic stability of siRNA while preserving its intrinsic RNAi activity and to avoid potential siRNA-induced innate immune responses, which have been historical challenges in the field. Overall, there is still a general paucity in understanding parameters that influence siRNA bioavailability and efficacy in non-liver tissues.",

            "text": "The lung is an accessible tissue with attractive therapeutic targets and unmet medical needs and has been the focus of several RNAi studies in recent years. 7 In humans, ALN-RSV01, an unmodified siRNA targeting the RSV nucleocapsid (N) gene, advanced to phase IIb clinical trials, where it missed its primary endpoint but nevertheless showed a clinically meaningful treatment effect. 8, 9 In preclinical studies, specificity of ALN-RSV01 was demonstrated in vivo by using mismatched controls, and a theoretical protective effect through innate immune activation was ruled out as immunogenic non-specific siRNAs lacked antiviral efficacy, while a chemically modified form of ALN-RSV01 with no detectable immunostimulatory capacity retained full activity in vivo. 10 Furthermore, the RNAi mechanism of action of ALN-RSV01 was demonstrated in vivo by detecting site-specific cleavage product of the RSV mRNA. Additional studies report inhaled naked siRNA efficacy against parainfluenza virus (PIV), as well as lung xenograft tumor growth. 11, 12 Other groups have described how intratracheal or intranasal delivery of siRNA targeting effectors of Th2driven inflammation like SOCS3 and STAT6 improved disease outcome in rodents, although direct target engagement in pathology-relevant cells was not conclusively demonstrated. 13, 14 In contrast with these reports, Moschos et al. 15 concluded that intratracheally delivered siRNA could not be internalized by cells and therefore lacked efficacy in the lung. Importantly, it should be noted that the lung delivery reports so far have used unmodified or partially modified siRNAs that are expected to have poor metabolic stability.",

The airway and lung are composed of a wide variety of cells with specific roles in pathology and homeostasis, including specialized epithelial cells, vascular endothelial cells, and different hematopoietic cell subpopulations with complex immunological functions. In particular, the lung immune compartment contains pharmacological targets that can be modulated for therapeutic benefit in asthma, COPD, and autoimmune disease. Flow cytometry and cell sorting technologies have allowed a better definition of lung parenchymal cells and resident leukocyte populations. 16, 17 In the present study, we have taken advantage of these technologies, particularly advances in fully modified siRNAs to provide exceptional metabolic stability, 18 to evaluate the distribution and activity of siRNA within the lung for a systematic characterization of cell-type tropism and structure-activity relationship of siRNA chemistry. Finally, we use the allergen-induced model of lung inflammation to demonstrate the capacity of inhaled siRNA to ameliorate lung pathology.",

The sequences and chemical modification schemes used in this manuscript can be found in Figure S1 . Synthesized siRNAs were dissolved in PBS and delivered without conjugation to cellular uptake agents (e.g., cholesterol) or association to any transfection-promoting reagents (e.g., liposomes) intratracheally using a microsprayer aerosolizer. Analysis of total lung RNA 3 days post-treatment revealed significant target knockdown in a dose-dependent fashion (up to 40% at 50 mg/kg) (Figure 1A) . Importantly, crossover controls demonstrated that this effect was observed in each case only for the targeted gene, demonstrating mRNA knockdown occurs through an RNAi-mediated mechanism and not through non-specific inflammation-related events. The in vivo activity of siRNA in the absence of lipid or polymer transfection agents has only been conclusively demonstrated in liver so far 24, 25 and requires conjugation to a hepatocyte-targeting ligand like multivalent N-acetylgalactosamine 3 or a lipophilic moiety like cholesterol. 26 Moschos et al. 15 reported that intratracheally administered antisense oligonucleotides escaping the lung into blood circulation can accumulate and induce target knockdown in the liver. Correspondingly, we observed liver Ctnnb1 silencing after siRNA lung administration. Importantly, knockdown was observed only when siRNA molecules were conjugated to multimeric galactose N-acetyl (GalNAc) ( Figure 1B) . Overall, these results indicate the presence of cells in the lung that can passively take up siRNA (i.e., without a cell-targeting ligand) and are permissive to RNAi activity. Furthermore, the results demonstrate the potential of lung-administered siRNA to have an effect in distal tissues like liver.",

As shown in Figure 2A , silencing activity triggered by chemically modified siRNA was significantly higher, suggesting a dependence on oligonucleotide stability for lung RNAi activity. We then compared the ability of si-Ctnnb1-2 0 -OH and si-Ctnnb1 to induce inflammation. A time course analysis, which included E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as a positive control, demonstrated that the neutrophilia (Figure 2B ) and pro-inflammatory cytokine elevation in the BAL fluid ( Figure 2C ) induced by si-Ctnnb1 2 0 -OH were abrogated by the modifications included in the active si-Ctnnb1 siRNA. Intranasal LPS administration, which induces a strong inflammatory response, had no significant effect on Ctnnb1 levels. These data demonstrate that the modifications introduced in our siRNA design successfully prevent the activation of the innate immune system in the lung and rule out the possibility that non-specific inflammation contributes to the decrease in target mRNA levels.

Analysis of mRNA levels showed that conjugation of the fluorescent label did not affect the RNAi activity of the siRNA (data not shown). The study revealed that early (2 h) after dosing by intratracheal delivery, siRNA localizes primarily to the muscular layer surrounding central arteries, with significant localization also to endothelial cells, the submucosal layer of upper airways, and alveolar epithelia ( Figure 3A ). This distribution pattern is subsequently lost, as the intense staining in the arterial region is significantly decreased 24 h post-dosing ( Figure 3B ). After 72 h, most of the fluorescent signal is observed in alveolar macrophages ( Figure 3C ). Importantly, we did not detect fluorescent siRNA in the bronchial epithelium at any of the time points analyzed. Higher magnification analysis at 2 h post-dose reveals siRNA localization to the lamina propria and smooth muscle layer area surrounding bronchi and bronchioles ( Figure 3D ). However, siRNAs designed against a smooth-muscle-specific gene marker (Pde4d) failed to induce gene knockdown activity at total lung RNA level, suggesting there is no productive siRNA delivery to smooth muscle cells (data not shown). Taken together, our data suggests that chemically modified unconjugated siRNA can distribute passively into lung cells, primarily alveolar macrophages and alveolar epithelia.",

To assess this possibility, we synthesized two siRNAs carrying PEG moieties of different molecular weight and configuration. Analysis of target mRNA levels 3 days post-dosing revealed that, despite carrying identical guide strands, passenger strand PEGylation rendered the siRNAs inactive ( Figure 5A) . Interestingly, the loss of activity did not correlate with lower siRNA content in the lung subsets analyzed. In fact, in support of our hypothesis, PEGylated siRNA content in the CD45 neg cell population was up to 10-fold higher than control siRNA ( Figure 5B ). The results suggest that PEG modi-fication results in changes to intracellular trafficking mechanisms that prevent RNAi activity.",

As treatment controls, mice were dosed with a non-specific siRNA or PBS only. As expected, OX40L mRNA levels in total lung were almost undetectable in sensitized-only (no challenge) mice and were upregulated (>100-fold) upon intranasal challenge. Importantly, mice dosed with OX40L-specific siRNA showed significant downregulation of the target gene, while control siRNA had no effect ( Figure 7B ).

            "text": "Addressing this problem, Moschos et al. 15 used tissue disruption and cell sorting to conclude that intratracheally delivered unmodified siRNA could not internalize into cells and therefore could not mediate RNAi activity in the lung. In the same study, chemically modified antisense oligonucleotides were shown to accumulate in alveolar macrophages and lung epithelia but did not induce target knockdown. We now conclusively demonstrate that chemically modified siRNA can indeed mediate RNAi activity in multiple cells in the lung while avoiding immune system activation. The conflicting results can be explained by our optimization of chemical modifications that render the siRNA more resistant to lung nucleases and/or lysosomal degradation, increasing its in vivo half-life and facilitating cytosolic release, respectively. In correspondence with this idea, we observed that lung mRNA silencing is highly dependent on such chemical modifications, which confer resistance to circulating and intracellular nucleases. This finding agrees with the reports of extensive chemical modifications needed for intracellular stability of siRNA conjugates in liver. 3 To our knowledge, the work presented here represents the most comprehensive characterization of lung siRNA distribution and activity and demonstrates that intratracheally delivered siRNA results in target knockdown 3 days post-dosing in lung cells, particularly CD11c + cells (dendritic cells, alveolar macrophages) and alveolar epithelia. Importantly, no targeting or other large functional group was required on the molecule to achieve pharmacological activity. Similar results were observed 7 days post-dosing or using an siRNA against a different target (Ssb), thus demonstrating the sequence-specific effect and by using a bolus instillation instead of intratracheal delivery. Importantly, unlike unmodified siRNAs, delivery of chemically modified siRNAs did not induce inflammation in the lung or induce marked histological changes in the lung, nor did we observe any sig-nificant change in relative cell numbers or staining pattern in the lungs of dosed animals, except for increased autofluorescence of alveolar macrophages.",

However, a direct correlation between cellular siRNA content and mRNA knockdown cannot be established, since the epithelial (CD45 neg CD326 + CD31 neg ) cell subset showed similar mRNA knockdown (60%) with 200-fold lower siRNA levels. Likewise, PEG conjugation abolished the activity of siRNA molecules while actually inducing a significant increase in cellular siRNA content. The results clearly demonstrate how cell-intrinsic differences in siRNA internalization and trafficking mechanisms that can be regulated by the oligonucleotide design define RNAi enablement at the cellular level.",

            "text": "Multiple studies disrupting the OX40L-OX40 signaling axis and employing dendritic cell (DC) depletion approaches have demonstrated a crucial role for DC-expressed OX40L in recall responses in the lung. 36, 37 Using a protocol similar to those that established the effectiveness of anti-OX40L-blocking antibodies, 38 we have demonstrated that intratracheal delivery of siRNA induces gene silencing within the DC-containing lung CD11c + cell population and modulates lung pathology. Furthermore, we have shown these effects were dependent on the siRNA modification pattern employed, demonstrating that siRNA stabilization by chemical modifications is absolutely required for in vivo activity. In correspondence with the role of DC-expressed OX40L in memory Th2 responses, we observed a downregulation of IL-13, IL-5, and IgE in siRNA-dosed mice. However, we did not see statistically significant decrease in IL-4 or lung eosinophilia that would be expected by a complete downregulation of the Th2 recall response. Seshasayee et al. have proposed that study protocols using two sensitization doses instead of one result in longer-lasting effector responses that are not fully suppressed by OX40L-blocking reagents. 38 Considering this possibility, we started challenging mice 21 days after our second sensitization dose. For comparison, a Hoshino et al. 46 study challenging mice starting at 10 days after the second dose reported no significant suppression of the Th2 recall response by OX40L-blocking reagents. Therefore, it is possible that study protocols with longer prechallenge periods would result in even stronger downregulation of Th2-associated parameters. Alternatively, a combination approach with another agent targeting a different stage in the Th2 pathway could have a synergistic protective effect. 47 The systematic characterization of siRNA tropism and in vivo activity as described here, together with recent advances in optimal modifications for improved in vivo potency, can pave the way for the development of newer siRNAs as inhaled reagents for human therapy. 48 Primary sequences and chemical modification schemes of siRNA targeting mouse Ctnnb1, Ssb, Tnsf4, and siRNA controls employed in our studies are summarized in Figure S1 . Oligonucleotides were dissolved and dosed in 50 mL PBS. Animals sedated by inhaled isofluorane were dosed intratracheally using a microsprayer aerosolizer high pressure syringe (Penn-Century).",
