Until recently, the numbers of patients affected remained small and the problem showed little sign of growing. However, a new class of ESBL (CTX-M enzymes) has emerged and has been widely detected among hospital E. coli but also found in the community. These ESBL-E. coli are found most often in urinary tract infections and are resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins. Carbapenems, such as meropenem, are usually the effective treatment for ESBL. However, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE; glycopeptide-resistant enterococci [GRE] ) may arise in Klebsiella species and E. coli. CRE infections are most common in patients receiving treatment involving devices such as catheters or ventilators, and those who are on long antibiotic courses.

Recurrent infections appear in up to 30% of patients, typically at the mucocutaneous junction of the lip (herpes labialis; cold sores) or nose, and are often precipitated by exposure to systemic infections, sunlight, trauma, stress or menstruation. These factors stimulate HSV to reactivate by more than one mechanism. One way is by direct induction of viral genes such as ICP4 and VP16. Heat can induce these viral genes either directly or via the by-products of heat. The activated viral gene products then overcome the effects of latent (LAT) RNAs. Another mechanism is an indirect one involving immunosuppression. Ultraviolet light is immunosuppressive and also induces cytokines that can trigger inflammation.

One out of five of the total adolescent and adult population in the USA are infected with HSV-2; the prevalence is rising but few have signs or symptoms. When signs of genital herpes do appear, they are typically as blisters on or around the genitals or rectum. The blisters break, leaving tender ulcers that may take 2-4 weeks to heal. It is important that women avoid contracting HSV-2 during pregnancy because a first episode during pregnancy causes a greater risk of transmission to the newborn. HSV-2 can cause potentially fatal infections in infants if the mother is shedding virus at the time of delivery. If a woman has active genital herpes at delivery, a Caesarean delivery is therefore usually performed.",

Denture-related stomatitis (denture-associated stomatitis) is a common infection secondary to long-standing occlusion of part of the oral mucosa by a denture. Denture-related stomatitis typically develops beneath a well-fitting upper denture, which effectively cuts off the mucous membrane from the normal oral defence mechanisms. It is not seen under a lower denture, in spite of the fact that the latter is a common cause of trauma. The characteristic feature is uniform bright erythema of the whole of the upper denture-bearing area, limited by the denture margin. Occasionally, the erythema is patchy or there may be flecks of thrush. Symptoms are typically absent but occasionally there is soreness. Angular stomatitis is frequently associated. The vast majority of patients are healthy, as local factors alone determine the pathogenesis. Occasionally, patients may be anaemic but less frequently than might be expected from the fact that angular stomatitis is often regarded as a typical sign of iron deficiency. Other occasional contributory factors are dry mouth, diabetes mellitus or immune defects. It is, however, unjustifiable to screen all patients with denture-related stomatitis but investigation should be considered if the patient has any other complaints suggestive of such disorders or if the infection is particularly severe or intractable. Treatment includes leaving dentures out of the mouth at night and storing them in hypochlorite to clear the fungus from the denture surface. Topical antifungals should also be used, as suggested above, or the fitting surface of the denture can be coated with miconazole.",

Both larval and adult forms of T. spiralis can parasitize humans as the definitive host but later they become the intermediate host when the larvae are established in the muscles. The same host sustains the adult worm temporarily, but the larvae for a long period of time. After ingestion of infected meat, the larvae mature to adult forms in the intestine in approximately 1 week. Adult female nematodes then deposit larvae in the gastrointestinal mucosa. The larvae penetrate and subsequently enter the bloodstream and pass to muscles such as the tongue, masseter, gastrocnemius, deltoid and diaphragm, where they grow and develop, and become encapsulated. Many infestations are subclinical but they can calcify and appear as radio-opaque nodules.",

Causes transient rashes if given to patients with glandular fever, leukaemia or cytomegalovirus infection Available with cloxacillin (Ampiclox) or flucloxacillin (co-fluampicil) Benzyl penicillin Given i.m. or i.v. Contraindicated in penicillin allergy Most effective penicillin when organism is sensitive Large doses may cause K + to fall, Na + to rise Not resistant to penicillinase Co-amoxiclav Mixture of amoxicillin and potassium clavulanate Contraindicated in penicillin allergy Inhibits some penicillinases (beta-lactamases) and therefore active against most Staph. aureus; also active against some Gram-negative bacilli May cause cholestatic jaundice Flucloxacillin Given by mouth Contraindicated in penicillin allergy Effective against most penicillin-resistant staphylococci Treatment in elderly, or for more than 2 weeks, may result in cholestatic jaundice Tetracyclines Tetracyclines Very broad antibacterial spectrum. Little to choose between the many preparations, but doxycycline and minocycline (see later) are safer for patients with renal failure Absorption impaired by iron, antacids, milk, etc. SUMMARY OF THE MAIN ANTIBACTERIAL AGENTS USED IN DENTISTRY 561 Many bacteria now resistant but still useful for infections with Chlamydia, Rickettsia, Brucella, Lyme disease, acne, leptospirosis, Haemophilus influenzae, methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus (MRSA) Contraindicated in pregnancy and children up to at least 7 y (tooth discolouration) Dose reduced in renal failure, liver disease and elderly Frequent mild gastrointestinal upsets May rarely cause intracranial hypertension Doxycycline Given by mouth in a single daily dose Contraindicated in pregnancy and children up to at least 7 y (tooth discolouration) Safer than other tetracyclines in renal failure; may rarely cause intracranial hypertension Reduce dose in liver disease and elderly Azithromycin Slightly less active than erythromycin against Gram-positive bacteria Reduced dose indicated in liver disease and long QT syndrome Long half-life (single daily dose) With terfenadine and pimozide may cause arrhythmias Fewer gastrointestinal effects than erythromycin Interacts with theophylline and lithium Caution in pregnancy Erythromycin Given by mouth but absorption erratic and unpredictable Reduced dose indicated in liver disease and long QT syndrome Similar antibacterial spectrum to penicillin With terfenadine and pimozide may cause arrhythmias Avoid erythromycin estolate, which may cause liver disturbance Interacts with theophylline and lithium Useful in those hypersensitive to penicillin Caution in pregnancy Effective against some staphylococci and most streptococci May cause nausea or hearing loss in large doses Rapid development of resistance Clarithromycin Fewer gastrointestinal effects than with erythromycin Reduced dose indicated in liver disease and long QT syndrome With terfenadine and pimozide may cause arrhythmias Interacts with theophylline and lithium Caution in pregnancy May be used in prophylaxis of meningitis after head injury since Neisseria meningitidis and Staph. aureus are frequently resistant to sulphonamides Occasional rashes, jaundice or blood dyscrasias Safe and effective but resistance rapidly develops Body secretions turn red Sulphonamides Main indication is for prophylaxis of post-traumatic meningitis but meningococci are increasingly resistant Contraindicated in pregnancy and in renal disease Adequate hydration essential to prevent (rare) crystalluria Other adverse reactions include rashes, erythema multiforme and blood dyscrasias Teicoplanin Reserved mainly for endocarditis and serious Staph. aureus infections, including some MRSA Reduce dose in renal failure and elderly Occasional rashes, nausea, fever, anaphylaxis May cause hearing loss or tinnitus Vancomycin Reserved for serious infections (including MRSA) Contraindicated in renal disease or deafness Given by slow (100-min) i.v. infusion May cause nausea, rashes, 'red man syndrome', tinnitus, deafness when given intravenously Extravenous extravasation causes necrosis and phlebitis Effective by mouth for pseudomembranous colitis Quinolones Can induce fits Contraindicated in patients with tendonitis, the elderly or those on steroids; epilepsy; diabetes; pregnancy; myasthenia gravis Can cause tendon damage Warn patients taking an oral contraceptive to use additional precautions if on antimicrobials for more than a single dose. APPENDIX 21.5 BACTERIAL INFECTIONS SEEN MAINLY IN PEOPLE FROM THE DEVELOPING WORLD Acute form, symptoms are nonspecific and 'flu-like, particularly fever, sweats, malaise, anorexia, headache, myalgia and back pain Undulant form (<1 y from illness onset), symptoms include undulant fevers, arthritis and epididymo-orchitis in males. Neurological symptoms may develop rapidly in up to 5% Chronic form (>1 y from onset), symptoms may include chronic fatigue syndrome-like depressive episodes and arthritis Brucellosis may be associated with chronic or intermittent lymphadenopathy Can cause massive diarrhoea with depletion of water and electrolytes, and can be fatal Pneumonic plague: results from secondary infection of lungs following dissemination from other sites. Direct infection of others may result. Untreated septicaemic and pneumonic plague are invariably fatal Fever, headache, malaise, myalgia, sore throat, chills, sweats, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal and chest pain APPENDIX 21.6 UNCOMMON BACTERIAL INFECTIONS THAT MAY HAVE IMPLICATIONS IN DENTISTRY Brucella melitensis, suis and abortus Brucellosis Rare infections or cranial nerve palsies Tetracycline with streptomycin",
