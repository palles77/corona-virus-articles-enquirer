Ready-to-eat (RTE) products factories have begun to further segregate or 'zone' production areas for food safety or hygiene reasons. A series of higher hygiene zones have been created to protect the product from microbiological cross-contamination events after it has been heat treated or decontaminated. There has also been the recognition that non-microbiological hazards, particularly allergens, and label declaration issues such as 'suitable for vegetarians', 'organic', 'does not contain GM materials' or 'Kosher/Halal' have to be controlled by segregating them from other product ingredients.",

With the advent of enhanced hygiene control in high hygiene areas, however, this has now been extended to four barriers (Holah, 2003) , as shown in Fig. 13 .1 . These encompass the site (1), the factory building (2), a high risk or high hygiene zone (3) and a product enclosure zone (4). The barrier system has two intrinsic properties. Firstly, each barrier is designed to minimise the presence, or challenge, of a given hazard on subsequent barriers. Secondly, the degree of control of the production environment increases such that fi nally, fully processed products are manipulated in controlled environments in which contaminants are actively excluded.",

This may be for protection against chemicals, such as the requirement for separate chemical stores, or for the protection from a particular process, e.g. the dosing of chlorine into a product washing system. The requirement for segregation and compartmentalisation of specifi c heat processes, e.g. ovens and fryers, or fi re hazards such as bulk storage of oils and fats, has long been recognised in the food industry, and these areas are segregated with incombustible materials. Because of fi res in chilled food factories that, through the use of false ceilings giving rise to large open spaces above processing areas that allowed the rapid (and unseen) spread of fi res, compartmentalisation of this roof space is strongly recommended. In addition it may be necessary to segregate particularly noisy pieces of equipment (see Reducing noise exposure in the food and drink industries , Food Information Sheet No. 32; http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/fi s32.pdf ).",

For example, by splitting down large processing areas into smaller sub-units (e.g. a single 12-line meat slicing hall into 3 fully segregated sub-units of 4 slicing lines), cross-contamination between lines can be eliminated. This is particularly the case when some lines need to be shut down for cleaning or maintenance whilst the others need to remain in production. Many large, multisite, international food manufacturers are also considering the layout and segregation of new and existing factories such that they are suitable for multiproduct food processing. This allows the manufacturer the fl exibility to change the nature of the product produced at the factory within a short time period, to take advantage of ever changing economic conditions.",

Many names have been adopted for this third level processing area, including 'clean room' (or ' salle blanche ' in France) following pharmaceutical terminology, 'high hygiene', 'high care' or 'high risk' area. In some sectors, particularly chilled, ready-to-eat foods, manufacturers have also adopted opposing names to describe second barrier areas such as 'low risk' or 'low care'. Much of this terminology is confusing, particularly the concepts of 'low' areas, which can imply to employees and other people that lower overall standards are acceptable in these areas where, for example, operations concerned with raw material reception, storage and initial preparation are undertaken. In practice, all operations concerned with food production should be carried out to the highest standard. Unsatisfactory practices in so-called low risk areas may, indeed, put greater pressures on the 'barrier system' separating the second and third level processing areas.",

Wet systems are used when the surface of the material to be decontaminated is soiled, e.g. logs of cut meat produced at one factory and then sent to the high risk area of another factory to be sliced. Critical parameters are the orientation of the spray bars, spray pressure, the concentration of the disinfectant and the speed of the conveyor. Dry systems are used when the surface of the material to be decontaminated is relatively clean; for example, in the same meat slicing factory, cans of corned beefed for slicing could be decontaminated by UV at the entrance to high risk. For UV tunnels, critical parameters are the orientation and intensity of the lamps and the speed of the conveyor. Early tunnel design for wet spray systems placed the tunnel approximately half in low risk and half in high risk. Whilst this formed an effective barrier, disinfectant wash sprayed onto the fl oor of high risk making it very wet and encouraging the growth and spread of microorganisms, including Listeria . Best practice is now to place the tunnel almost entirely in low risk such that spray is retained in this area.

The fourth barrier approach is essential for the production of aseptic foods, but is also being used for the production of some chilled, ready-to-eat foods. Aseptic machines tend to be fully automated with the object of packing a product into a specifi c container. Product enclosure systems allow a degree of manual intervention and further manipulation of the product prior to packing and can be undertaken by physical segregation (a box within a box within a box) or by the use of highly fi ltered directional air currents. With respect to physical segregation, 'glove boxes' offer the potential to fully enclose product with the ability to operate to aseptic or ultra-clean conditions. Glove boxes for the food industry work in the same way as glove boxes for the medical, microbiological or pharmaceutical industry, in which the food is enclosed in a sealed space, totally protected from the outside environment, and manipulated through gloves sealed into an inspection window. They work best if the product is delivered to them in a pasteurised condition, is packed within the box and involves little manual manipulation. The more complicated the product manipulation, the more ingredients to be added, the faster the production line or the shorter the product run, the less fl exible glove boxes become. Operating on a batch basis, pre-disinfected glove boxes give the potential for a temperature controlled environment with a modifi ed atmosphere if required, that can be disinfected on-line by gaseous chemicals (e.g. ozone) or UV light. surrounding air can be demonstrated within the protected conveyor zone (Burfoot et al. , 2001) .",

Glove boxes are only necessary, of course, if people are involved in the food production line. If robots undertook product manipulation, there would be less microbiological risk and the whole room could be temperature and atmospherically controlled! Where the use of glove boxes is impractical, partial enclosure of the product can be achieved by the use of localised, fi ltered airfl ows. The high risk air handling system provides control of airborne contamination external to high risk but provides only partial control of aerosols, generated from personnel, production and cleaning activities, within high risk. At best, it is possible to design an air handling system that minimises the spread of contamination generated within high risk from directly moving over product. Localised airfl ows are thus designed to:\u2022 Provide highly fi ltered (H11/12) air directly over or surrounding product and its associated equipment. The air is generated into a box which has a top and sides that direct the air downwards, and a fl oor that collects the air and wastes or recycles it. In some cases the 'base' of the box may be missing and the air is directed to waste.\u2022 Provide a degree of product isolation ranging from partial enclosure in tunnels to chilled conveyor wells, where the fl ow of the fi ltered air provides a barrier that resists the penetration of aerosol particles, some of which would contain viable microorganisms.By chilling the air, it is possible to keep chilled product cold whilst operating the high risk area at ambient conditions. Economically, it is also very expensive to cool the whole of the high risk area down to simply maintain low product temperatures, thus localised chilling could both cut costs and enhance product safety. Even at the lowest level of product enclosure, localised air conveyor wells ( Fig. 13 .5 ), a 1-2 log reduction of microorganisms from the Fig. 13 .5 Chilled air is supplied from air ducts on either side of a product conveyor. The chilled air retains the product temperature and its movement, spilling over the duct surfaces, provides a barrier to microorganism penetration. SHAPTON ",
