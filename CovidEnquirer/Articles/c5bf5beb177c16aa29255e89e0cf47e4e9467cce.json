A number of modelling efforts have investigated the interaction between the disease transmission dynamics and human behaviour change mediated by news coverage and by information spreading in the population. Yet, given the scarcity of data on public awareness during an epidemic, few studies have relied on empirical data. Here, we use fine-grained, geo-referenced data from three online sources -Wikipedia, the GDELT Project and the Internet Archive -to quantify population-scale information seeking about the 2016 Zika virus epidemic in the U.S., explicitly linking such behavioural signal to epidemiological data. Geolocalized Wikipedia pageview data reveal that visiting patterns of Zika-related pages in Wikipedia were highly synchronized across the United States and largely explained by exposure to national television broadcast. Contrary to the assumption of some theoretical models, news volume and Wikipedia visiting patterns were not significantly correlated with the magnitude or the extent of the epidemic. Attention to Zika, in terms of Zika-related Wikipedia pageviews, was high at the beginning of the outbreak, when public health agencies raised an international alert and triggered 1 All rights reserved.

In the past ten years, several studies have addressed the impact of awareness and information spread during epidemic outbreaks and it has been reported that the degree of public attention and concern induced by an epidemic threat might affect the disease transmission dynamics [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . However, modeling efforts have been mostly theoretical and a large-scale empirical characterization of information seeking behaviour and its interplay with the disease dynamics during an epidemic outbreak has been elusive so far due to the lack of available data 8 .",

ZIKV is a RNA virus from the Flaviviridae family which is mainly transmitted by infected Aedes mosquitoes, although there have been cases of sexual and perinatal transmission. Infection is mostly asymptomatic or associated with mild symptoms 9 but it can lead to serious and sometimes fatal neurological defects in neonates born to ZIKV infected women. In particular, following the association between ZIKV and a cluster of microcephaly cases in Brazil 10 , the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ZIKV epidemic a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on February 1st, 2016 11 . The emergency lasted until November 18th 2016, when the WHO declared the PHEIC to be over 12 . As of March 2017, ZIKV has spread worldwide to 79 countries where there has been evidence of an ongoing vector-borne virus transmission. The most affected region has been the American continent with 47 countries or territories reporting local ZIKV transmission, due to the extensive presence of Aedes mosquitoes in almost all the region's countries 13 . In such epidemiological context, the ZIKV epidemic has posed peculiar communication challenges to the public due to its association with microcephaly in newborns, its transmission modalities, and its prevalence in areas where the virus was never detected before and that was suddenly characterized by intense international travel due to the 2016 Summer Olympics [13] [14] [15] . Public polls conducted in the United States evidenced the lack of knowledge about ZIKV in the general population and more specifically in groups at risk, such as pregnant women 16 .

Intuitively, mass media coverage represents the main driver of public attention during an epidemic. Indeed, several peculiarities of media narratives around public health hazards 17 and infectious diseases 18 have been elucidated, but a general and quantitative comprehension of how the public opinion responds to media exposure during an emerging epidemic threat is still lacking. The majority of modeling studies assume that media exposure is driving behavioural changes, hence media exposure effects are incorporated into some kind of media function that modulates individual behaviors and may affect disease dynamics [19] [20] [21] . The general assumption is that as the number of cases increases and is reported by mass media, the susceptibility of individuals will decrease due to increasing awareness and the associated behavioral changes 20 . However, for most disease outbreaks, such an assumption has never been supported by direct empirical evidence. More in general, the complex interplay between media coverage, public attention and disease dynamics during an epidemic remains an open research challenge.",

Summer 2016 was also characterized by the first reports of local ZIKV transmission in Florida and in Texas, events that were also responsible for an increased news coverage of Zika. However, the surge of reported ZIKV cases in the United States did not result in an increased level of attention with respect to the initial spike observed at the beginning of the outbreak. The epidemic profile is indeed not correlated with the timeline of Wikipedia page views (r = \u22120.15) or the media coverage profiles (r = 0.04 for TV and r = 0.14 for Web news). Such dynamics of public attention can be ascribed to the initial novelty of the outbreak, which was presented as a novel and serious health threat even in the presence of a small number of imported cases. As the extension of the outbreak and the associated risks became clearer to the public, the interest of Americans in looking for additional information on Wikipedia faded over the course of the year, with relatively smaller increments linked to important events such as the Olympics. This observation is consistent with the presence of a memory effect in the dynamics of Wikipedia page views: individuals retain information for some time before their attention toward a topic is elicited again by novel events or anniversaries 22, 23 .",

To answer this question, we examined the attention to ZIKV in 788 cities of the United States with a population larger than 40,000 and compared it to their total Wikipedia viewership. By ranking the U.S. cities based on their total volume of Wikipedia pageviews in 2016, and comparing such ranking with the one based on pageviews of Zika-related articles only, we identified locations where the attention to ZIKV was higher than expected. As shown in Figure 3 A, cities on the East Coast of Florida showed the highest relative attention to ZIKV, when compared to their overall Wikipedia activity. Other relevant outliers with high attention were cities in Texas and in the Northeast. On the contrary, the lowest attention to ZIKV was observed in cities in California, and in the Midwest ( Figure 3B ). These results suggest that increases in public attention at city level may be explained by risk perception due to the presence of the vector (as in Florida and Texas). However, the high level of attention in other places, such as Union City, NJ, can not be easily explained by epidemiological risk factors and it may be due to specific events, such as one or more case importations, that do not appear in our dataset.",

That is, we assume that information seeking behavior in Wikipedia is driven, at any given point in time, by same-week exposure to media sources. Since our goal is uncovering drivers of collective attention, rather than achieving optimal prediction of the empirical time series, we choose an equal-time modeling approach over standard time series modeling techniques (e.g., autoregressive models). More specifically, we start with a linear regression model that predicts population-rescaled pageview counts for a given week and a given state using only national Web news and TV data for the same week. We focus on 43 states with population in excess of 1 million, comprising more than 98% of the U.S. population according to 2016 United States Census Bureau estimates 25 . We train the model via state-wise cross-validation and evaluate its performance using the determination coefficient R 2 and the Pearson's correlation coefficient r. Despite its simplicity, this equal-time linear regression demonstrates that both media signals, taken independently, are already quite informative of the Zika population-rescaled pageview time series: using exclusively TV close captions we obtain R 2 = 0.61 and r = 0.80, while using only Web news we obtain R 2 = 0.52 and r = 0.78.",

While previous studies have focused on newspaper coverage of epidemics 31 , we investigated the relationship between the exposure to TV coverage and online news, and the attention to Wikipedia pages. Our study confirms the high sensitivity of Wikipedia searches to breaking news and official announcements, in particular in the case of disaster events, as found by previous studies 32, 33 . On the other hand, the temporal dynamics of Wikipedia page views during the 2016 ZIKV epidemic showed a nonlinear dependence with media coverage: the Wikipedia pages activity was high in the initial phases of the outbreak, but it declined more quickly than media coverage. This can be explained by the fact that information on Wikipedia is rather static, and users will view Wikipedia pages immediately after the news breaks but they will not return in the next days, unless more recent events renew their attention 32 . 11 All rights reserved.

Similarly, we did not find any statistically significant correlation between the attention to Wikipedia pages and the ZIKV incidence data in the U.S. The correlation between ZIKV incidence and media coverage was also mild, and varied from state to state, suggesting that media coverage was only relatively influenced by the actual progression of the epidemic over time. One might argue that our results may not generalize to all epidemic outbreaks. Indeed, the peculiar characteristics of the ZIKV infection, such as its association to mild symptoms and the relatively small size of the population at risk, due to the spatial distribution of the vector, may have influenced the attention dynamics during the outbreak. Epidemic outbreaks caused by different pathogens, possibly characterized by a higher transmissibility, and different symptomatology, such as the Ebola virus or pandemic influenza, may lead to different attention patterns. However, it is reasonable to believe that media coverage would be, in any case, the main driver of collective attention, as it also has been during the 2014 West African Ebola virus epidemic 29, 35 .",

The daily timeline of Wikipedia page views (Figure 1 A) highlights two distinct peaks of attention in 2016: the first, in the beginning of February 2016, corresponding to the international alert raised by the WHO and by the CDC at national level; the second, in August 2016, corresponding to the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, which attracted significant attention due to the health concerns for athletes and the related risk of case importation. Such spikes of attention visibly correspond to similar spikes in the media coverage profiles, both in the TV coverage of the epidemic (Figure 1 B) and in the Web news coverage of Zika (Figure 1 C). The three time series are indeed highly correlated, with a Pearson's correlation coefficient r = 0.74 for the Wikipedia pageviews and the Web news time series, and r = 0.80 for the Wikipedia attention and the TV coverage. On the contrary, while the profile of Wikipedia pageviews shows a temporal pattern that is very similar to the one displayed by mentions of Zika in media outlets, the temporal profile of the disease incidence is qualitatively very different.

Table 1 summarizes the performance of the model, in terms of determination coefficient R 2 and Pearson's correlation coefficient r, for 10 different sets of features. The introduction of a memory kernel increases the determination coefficient by about 20%, reaching an average R 2 = 0.76. This is obtained for a characteristic time scale \u03c4 of about 2 weeks, over which collective attention is affected by past media exposure. We also considered state-level news features obtained by counting the weekly number of mentions of each state in Web news.
