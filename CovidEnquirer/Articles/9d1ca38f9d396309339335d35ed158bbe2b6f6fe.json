Influenza A is the most prevalent of the 3, frequently causes seasonal outbreaks and epidemics in humans, and infection with this subtype leads to more severe morbidity than influenza B and C. In addition, influenza A is the only subtype that causes pandemics. Influenza A H1N1 and H3N2 are currently the predominant virus subtypes causing influenza infection in humans. Since 1977, these 2 flu viruses have been circulating, causing seasonal influenza worldwide, whereas influenza A H2N2 subtype has not circulated in humans since 1968. 10 Influenza B viruses circulate less widely than influenza A, causing fewer seasonal outbreaks and epidemics, whereas influenza C viruses cause only sporadic cases or minor outbreaks but not epidemics. In both cases, humans develop antibodies to these influenza viruses during childhood that provide some protection later against severe disease. 18 However, in children less than 6 years of age who have not yet acquired antibodies to influenza C, this virus can cause serious respiratory infections. 19 Antigenic Drift and Antigenic Shift Influenza A viruses, more than influenza B and C viruses, have a natural tendency to periodically undergo hemagglutinin and neuraminidase antigenic changes. Small point mutations in the RNA gene segments that code for these 2 glycoproteins lead to minor hemagglutinin and neuraminidase antigenic changes called antigenic drifts that result in localized outbreaks. Large mutations with viral gene reassortment that result in major hemagglutinin and neuraminidase antigenic changes referred to as antigenic shifts are associated with more widespread epidemics and pandemics. Influenza A, because of their greater propensity for antigenic variation, is the only influenza virus type able to undergo antigenic shifts, whereas all 3 virus types (influenza A, B, and C) have the ability to undergo antigenic drifts.",

The virus initially attaches to the epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract and, if not neutralized by the host's immune system, the virus can continue to invade more and more cells as the virus descends the respiratory tract. After adsorption and binding of viral hemagglutinin to host cell sialic acid-conjugated glycoproteins, the virus enters the host cell. This adsorption and binding is deemed necessary for virus cell entry, 20 and is epidemiologically significant because the configuration of sialic acid-conjugated glycoproteins differs from one species to another, which may exert a crucial role in limiting transfer of influenza viruses across species. 21 Once the virus has entered the host cell, it immediately disrupts normal cell function and starts replicating and releasing its viral progeny. Neuraminidase is essential for viral release and propagation. 22 Viral replication leads to host cell degradation and death via several mechanisms that shut off protein synthesis and release potent cytokines. 23, 24 Cytokines, such as type I interferons, interleukins, tumor necrosis factor, as well as other inflammatory mediators, are thought to cause coughing and other systemic symptoms of flu.",

Primary viral pneumonias are uncommon but tend to have increased symptom severity. However, during influenza outbreaks, influenza virus types A and B are responsible for more than half of all community-acquired viral pneumonia cases. Secondary bacterial pneumonia is a significant complication of influenza, accounting for 25% of all influenza deaths. 46 Children hospitalized with influenza-associated pneumonia have a higher risk for intensive care admission, respiratory failure, and death compared to those hospitalized with influenza without pneumonia. Classically, influenza patients complicated with pneumonia have an exacerbation of fever and respiratory symptoms after an initial improvement. The most common bacterium is S pneumonia, accounting for approximately 50% of cases. Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenza are also important common organisms. During the 2006 to 2007 influenza season, 51 cases of community-acquired S aureus pneumonia were reported to the CDC. Almost 50% of these cases had antecedent or concomitant viral illness, and just under 80% of the S aureus cultures were MRSA. The median age was 16 years, 44% had no known pertinent medical history, and approximately half of patients, for whom final disposition was known, died a median of 4 days after symptom onset. Despite the selection bias in the cases reported, community-associated S aureus (CA-MRSA) Influenza in the Emergency Department pneumonia accounts for severe pneumonia with high mortality in young otherwise healthy patients with influenza. Therefore, empiric therapy for severe communityacquired pneumonia should include treatment against S aureus, including MRSA. 47 Neurologic complications include encephalitis, transverse myelitis, and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Reye syndrome has been reported in patients using aspirin after influenza infections. Myositis is rare, but has been reported more commonly in children than adults. It presents in early convalescence with acute onset of pain and tenderness in the lower leg muscles severe enough to limit walking. Serum creatine kinase (CK) levels transiently increase, with complete recovery generally occurring in 3 to 4 days; renal failure is rare. 48 Cardiovascular involvement occurs by directly affecting the myocardium or exacerbating existing cardiovascular conditions. The frequency of myocardial involvement in influenza infection is variable, with rates of up to 10% having been reported in the literature, although this depends on the methods used to detect myocardial involvement. Although many patients are asymptomatic, a significant proportion of these have electrocardiogram changes. Fulminant myocarditis resulting in cardiogenic shock and death may occur. When a patient's condition deteriorates with hemodynamic compromise, cardiac involvement should be considered. The mainstay of treatment of influenza myocarditis is supportive. Cardiovascular deaths also increase during influenza epidemics by increased deaths from coronary artery disease. These deaths have been shown to be reduced by influenza vaccination, which should be offered to all patients with cardiovascular disease. 49 Other rare complications encountered include toxic shock syndrome in conjunction with secondary S aureus infection and parotitis. 50 ",

A positive influenza test may be used to confirm influenza virus in the community, which may affect clinical practice related to home care guidance, hospital infection control practices, future testing practices, and so forth. Neither the rapid influenza test nor clinical prediction rules were superior to clinical judgment alone in the diagnosis of influenza. In one study of 258 patients with 21% confirmed influenza, the overall clinical judgment had a sensitivity of 29% (95% CI, 18%-43%) and specificity 92% (95% CI, 87%-95%), which improved to a sensitivity of 67% (95% CI, 39%-86%) and specificity of 96% (95% CI, 81%-99%) when patients presented within 48 hours.

In immunocompetent children and adults, in whom viral shedding is brief, specimen samples yield the best results during the first 1 to 5 days of illness. 54, 57 Low viral titers in the first 12 to 24 hours following onset of clinical illness have been suggested as a cause of falsenegative results in patients tested early 58 ; similarly, specimens obtained after 5 days of illness have an increased likelihood of false-negative results because of decreased virus shedding. Immunocompetent infants and young children spread virus for longer (1 week), which ideally permits the collection of specimens after 5 days of illness. 54 Irrespective of age, specimen collection in immunocompromised persons can also exceed 5 days of illness because virus shedding in this patient population can last for weeks, even months. 54 In the ED, collection of serum specimens is not recommended for diagnostic purposes because results are not readily available and therefore cannot guide clinical decision making and management. 54",

Commercial RIDTs currently available in the United States and Canada are listed in Table 3 , and general RIDT characteristics, including advantages and disadvantages, are described in Box 2. RIDTs are valuable in the ED because they produce results in a timely and clinically relevant manner that facilitate on-site point-of-care diagnosis of influenza that, according to limited research, has led to a decrease in demand for further diagnostic tests (eg, chest radiography, blood cultures) and the use of antibiotics, thus resulting in decreased patient costs. 61 Recommendations for the use of RIDTs were developed and promulgated by the World Health Organization (WHO) (Box 3). The CDC has recently issued guidelines for clinicians on the use of RIDTs for the 2010 to 2011 influenza season. 59 A major drawback of RIDTs is their limited reliability in accurately detecting influenza virus, which depends on a wide variety of factors, including RIDT sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, type of specimen collected, and time of collection with respect to onset of symptoms. Although RIDTs exhibit high specificities ranging between 90% and 95%, RIDTs have substantially lower sensitivities, ranging from about 70% to 90% in children, decreasing even further to approximately 40% to 60% or lower in adults, compared with viral culture and RT-PCR. 54, 62, 63 Thus, if RIDTs are the only diagnostic assay used in a center, positive results can be trusted but a negative result cannot reliably exclude disease. Table 4 displays specifically selected commercially available RIDTs and corresponding test sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative predictive values, which also vary according to the study.",

As a result, RT-PCR has become the recommended test of choice for accurately diagnosing influenza in a timely fashion. 54 During the recent pandemic, the CDC released a method through the WHO for RT-PCR detection of influenza A that allowed clinical and reference laboratories to standardize methodology and thus produce data that could be compared between laboratories. 67 However, the major advantage of RT-PCR lies in its ability to more readily detect influenza viruses in people with chronic lung diseases and immunosuppressed persons, who may exhibit lower levels of the virus. 68 In these susceptible patients, RT-PCR can efficiently and accurately confirm the diagnosis of influenza to support therapeutic and infection control decisions.",

There should be appropriate communication to other personnel about patients with suspected or confirmed influenza before transferring them to other departments (eg, radiology) and admitting units in the facility. Some procedures performed on patients with suspected or confirmed influenza infection may be more likely to generate higher concentrations of infectious respiratory aerosols. These procedures include intubation and related procedures (eg, manual ventilation, open endotracheal suctioning, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, sputum induction, nebulized therapy, and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation such as continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP] or biphasic positive airway pressure [BiPAP]). Although there are limited data available on influenza transmission related to such aerosols, many authorities recommend the additional precautions to be used when such procedures are performed. 87 The number of health care workers present should be limited to only those essential for patient care and support. Those present should have received influenza vaccine. There should be a low threshold for intubation rather than using prolonged aerosol-generating procedures such as BiPAP and CPAP. The health care worker should wear respiratory protection including a fitted N95 respirator during aerosol-generating procedures. N95 respirators should be used in the context of a comprehensive respiratory protection program that includes fit testing and training as required under the respiratory protection standard (29 CFR 1910 .134) of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OHSA). 88 The procedures should be conducted in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR), when feasible. AIIRs reduce the concentration of infectious aerosols and prevent spread into adjacent areas using controlled air exchanges and directional airflow. AIIR are negative-pressure rooms relative to the surrounding areas, with a minimum of 6 air exchanges per hour. The air should be exhausted directly to the outside or filtered through a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter before recirculation. There should be environmental surface cleaning following the procedure.",

The most significant was in 1918, when the so-called Spanish flu killed 40 to 50 million people worldwide. 90 In 2009, there was the emergence of a novel H1N1 virus, a genetic combination of human and swine influenza viruses. Because many persons have little or no immunity to a new pandemic virus, the disease can spread quickly. With the H1N1 pandemic, the rate of infection was highest among young individuals; infections were less common in persons older than 65 years, perhaps secondary to preexisting immunity against antigenically similar viruses.

The emergency physician should enquire about the patient's travel history or any close contact with persons who have traveled (especially from southeast Asia) or contact with any health care provider. 95 Such patients require isolation and consultation with the infection control team.

This information is based on data published by the FDA (Available at: http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/informationbyDrugClass/ucm100228.htm). b Recommended duration for antiviral treatment is 5 days. Longer treatment courses can be considered for patients who remain severely ill after 5 days of treatment. c Recommended duration is 10 days when administered after a household exposure and 7 days after the most recent known exposure in other situations. For control of outbreaks in longterm care facilities and hospitals, CDC recommends antiviral chemoprophylaxis for a minimum of 2 weeks and up to 1 week after the most recent case was identified. d A reduction in the dose of oseltamivir is recommended for persons with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min. e For the recommended treatment dose for oseltamivir for children aged 10 to 12 years who weigh 40 kg or less, please see weight of child and dose for age groups 7 to 9 years. from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
