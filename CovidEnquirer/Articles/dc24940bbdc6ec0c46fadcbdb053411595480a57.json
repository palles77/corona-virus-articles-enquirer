Eight aminoazocompounds and 27 aryltriazene derivatives exhibited antiviral activity, sometimes of high level, against one or more viruses. A marked activity against BVDV and YFV was prevailing among the former compounds, while the latter type of compounds affected mainly CVB-2 and RSV. None of the active compounds inhibited the multiplication of HIV-1, VSV and VV. Arranged in order of decreasing potency and selectivity versus the host cell lines, the best compounds are the following; BVDV: 1 > 7 > 8 > 4; YFV: 7 > 5; CVB-2: 25 > 56 > 18; RSV: 14 > 20 > 55 > 38 > 18 > 19; HSV-1: 2. For these compounds the EC 50 ranged from 1.6 lM (1) to 12 lM (18), and the S. I. from 19.4 (1) to 4.2",

Antifungal and anti-proliferative activities have been found in a peculiar class of cyclic aminoazocompounds (3,3-disubstituted-3,4-dihydro-1,2,4-benzo triazines), which, moreover, can display several other pharmacological activities depending on the substituents that are present on the bicyclic system. 5, 6 Very potent relaxant activity on intestinal and uterine smooth muscles was displayed at nanomolar concentration by N-dialkylaminoalkyl derivatives of another cyclic aminoazo system, namely 11H-dibenzo-[1,2,5]-triazepine, which exhibited also local anesthetic and antithrombotic activities. 7 Arylazoenamines could be also seen as vinylogues of aryltriazenes (Fig. 2) , a class of compounds which hold an important position as carcinogens and/or anticancer agents. 3,3-Dimethyl-1phenyltriazene and, even better, dacarbazine are able to methylate DNA; thus the former resulted a powerful carcinogen, while the latter is in clinical use for the treatment of malignant melanoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma. 8 Temozolamide, 9 closely related to dacarbazine, is currently used to treat malignant glyomas. A recent development of this cyclic aryltriazene is represented by benzotriazepinones, 10 that are very promising agents against breast cancer. It is worth noting that these compounds are weak alkylating agents and may damage DNA by a novel mechanism.",

Some biologically active aminoarylazo compounds and aryltriazene derivatives. antiviral activity has been shown by several benzotriazole derivatives, which could be formally considered as cyclic triazenes, though the resonance stabilization of the heterocycle could imply even substantial differences in the chemical and hence the biological behavior of the two kinds of compounds. Interestingly, some halogenated benzotriazoles have been shown to inhibit the NTPase/helicase activities of hepatitis C and related viruses. 15 Aromatic and heteroaromatic esters of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole were found to strongly inhibit (K i = 7.5 nM) the 3CL-protease, which is essential for the replication of the coronavirus responsible of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). 16 More recently, a set of benzotriazole derivatives have been found endowed with potent activity against RSV and moderate activity against YFV, BVDV and CVB-2. 17 On this base we deemed interesting to investigate the possible antiviral activity of some assorted aminoarylazo compounds and aryltriazene derivatives, allotted in seven groups A-G (Fig. 3) .

More importantly, however, this molecular scaffold is anchored in place by three persistent hydrogen bonds (HBs). A first HB bridge involves the nitrogen atom of the N(CH 3 ) 2 substituent group on 1 and the -OH group of Y289 side chain, with an average dynamic length (ADL) of 3.08 \u00b1 0.3 \u00c5. The second HB interaction engages the terminal amino group of K263 and the N atom of the inhibitor secondary amino group (ADL = 3.18 \u00b1 0.2 \u00c5). Finally, one of the nitrogen atoms belonging to the azo group characterizing compound 1 is involved in the third HB interaction with the backbone -NH group of E265 (ADL = 2.92 \u00b1 0.3 \u00c5). Importantly, quantitative information about the affinities of our ligands towards BVDV RdRp can be inferred by applying the MM/ PBSA methodology to estimate the free energy of binding, DG bind , and its components. The calculated DG bind values for the dimethylaminopropyl derivatives 1, 2, 4, and the quinolizidinylmethyl derivatives 7-10 are listed in Table 6 . Generally speaking, and in harmony with our previous findings, 33,34 both the nonbonded mechanical energy components of DG bind , DE vdW and DE el , afford a substantial, favorable contribution to binding for both series of compounds. On the other hand, due the polar character of the azo group, the desolvation penalty paid by these molecules upon binding (DG PB ) is also quite substantial, so that the net, resulting electrostatic contribution to the affinity of these inhibitors to their enzyme receptor are notably unfavorable. Specifically, for this series of compounds, the mean value of the electrostatic energy (DE el + DG PB ) is 26 kcal/mol, whilst the corresponding mean values of the van der Waals and hydrophobic overall interaction energies (DE vdW + DG np ) are \u00c046 kcal/mol. Accordingly, it follows that the association between the ligands and the RdRp is mainly driven by more favorable nonpolar interactions in the complex than in the solution, in harmony with a proposed general scheme for noncovalent association. 33, 34 However, as indicated for instance by the energy components of compound 2, this driving force can be weakened when the polar groups on the molecule do not find an adequate bonding pattern in the protein compared to water. The free energy penalty for this (DE el + DG PB ) term is least for compound 1 and this, together with its substantial van der Waals contribution and moderate entropic unfavorable term, consequently leads to one of the highest binding affinity in this set of inhibitors.",

Although we obviously cannot directly compare the computed binding free energy (and hence the corresponding IC 50 ) with the EC 50 values deriving from experiment, we can observe that, in most cases, the rank of the inhibitors with respect to their activity towards their putative targets, the RdRps of BVDV, is maintained, although with some discrepancies.

            "text": "The overall results obtained from molecular modeling deserve some more comments. First of all, the binding site identified by our procedure is very close to the putative binding site proposed for two allosteric inhibitors of BVDV RdRp, VP32947 and BPIP, 23 Table 5 Cytotoxicity against MT-4, MDBK, BHK and Vero-76 cell lines and YFV, Reo-1, CVB-2, RSV, HSV-1 and Sb-1 inhibitory activity of triazene derivatives of structure F and G Tables 3 and 4. and involves residue F224 (see Fig. 5d ), a residue found mutated into S224 in BVDV BPIP-resistant clones. The binding pocket is located in a turn of the fingers domain between two b-sheets which is believed to be involved in finger flexibility for RNA template/product translocation, 35 dimerization of the RdRp in the replication complex, or protein/protein interactions, 36, 37 enabling the assembly of an active replication complex. According to our docking results, then, the hypothetical binding of our compounds to the polymerase could affect the finger flexibility or impair the capacity of the protein to translocate its template/product during RNA polymerization. Alternatively, the diarylazo moiety could possibly act by hampering the entrance of the template RNA in the template binding cavity. Although our in silico data clearly show the same trend of the corresponding experimental EC 50 values, at the same time they yield no evidence that binding of these inhibitors onto the BVDV RdRp result in a real allosteric inhibition of the enzyme or in a reduced template-binding ability. One of the explanations why we find IC 50 values higher than the corresponding EC 50 could be explained by the following rationale. Recently an attempt of co-crystallize the BVDV RdRp with the inhibitor VP32947 failed do to a dimer interface near the putative binding site of VP32947 in the BVDV RdRp crystal. The authors of the work proposed that the for-mation of this dimer could constitute an important point in the replication complex. Moreover, it was also hypothesized that the top of the fingers domain could be a protein-docking site pivotal to the interactions with other enzymes of the replicase complex. As the VP32947 binding site is part of the putative binding pocket for our molecular series, it could be that, upon binding, our compounds hinder the interactions among different proteins making up the replicase complex.",

            "text": "Last but not least, it is important to recall that RdRp functions in virus-infected cells in the context of membrane-bound replication complexes, that usually consist of several virus-encoded proteins, host proteins, and various forms of viral RNA. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase may then have a role in interacting with these other components and/or in the stability of the replication complexes. If one or more of these putative actions of the RdRp in infected cells is sensitive to our inhibitors, viral RNA synthesis may be disrupted in a manner which is distinct from the one estimated by our in silico assays. Now, given the similarity among the polymerases of pestiviruses, hepaciviruses, and flaviviruses, any knowledge gained from any one of these viral systems is likely to foster progress in the others. Given the high importance of the hepatitis C pandemic and the stringent need for efficient therapeutics for this pathology, it is expected that new molecular entities such as those described in this work can provide meaningful insights towards the identification of possible anti-HCV agents. Interestingly, the overall sequence identity between BVDV and HCV RdRp proteins is quite low, approximately 30%. If we consider the alignment of BVDV and HCV RdRp reported in Figure 4c , and in particular focus on the highlighted fingers domain part, we can immediately speculate that: (i) the F224 residue in the BVDV protein has no counterpart in the corresponding HCV enzyme; accordingly, if the drug would bind in the same binding pocket with the same binding mode, there should in principle be no problem of resistant mutant at this position. (ii) The important region of K263-K266 in the BVDV RdRp is highly conserved in the corresponding HCV polymerase (KNEK in BVDV and KNEV in HCV, respectively, see Fig. 4c ); importantly, both K263 and E265 are engaged in fundamental stabilizing hydrogen bonds with the inhibitors in the BVDV case but, being conserved, they are able to establish the same interactions with the compounds also in the case of HCV. (iii) The residue Y289 of BVDV RdRp is not conserved in the corresponding HCV polymerase, being replaced by a phenylalanine. Therefore, the anchoring hydrogen bond between the Y289 -OH group and, for instance, the tertiary nitrogen of 1 can no longer take place. Taken all together, these evidences can justify a minor potency of this molecular series towards the HCV RdRp as a target with respect to the BVDV counterpart. At the same time, in the case of both viruses, the binding pockets on the respective RdRps do share a sufficient degree of structural and sequence homology; thus, since these regions involve the fingers domains, which overhang the palm domains of the enzymes, they might be involved in RNA substrate recognition and, hence, the The side chains of all residues that form the primary binding pocket interacting with compound 1 are shown as stick models, and the atom color-coding is as follows: N217, firebrick; A221, orange; A222, dark kaki; F224, red; E258, dim gray; T259, rosy brown; I261, green; K263, hot pink; N264, tan; E265, sienna; K266, dark magenta; I287, gold; Q288, navy blue; Y289, purple; P290, dark slate blue; E291, pink; R295, olive drab; R529, coral; L530, kaki.

The ensemble of structures for the uncomplexed reactants are generated either running separate MD simulations for them, or by using the trajectory of the complex, simply removing the atoms of the protein or ligand. In this work we applied the latter variant. Accordingly, the term E int in Eq. 2 cancels out in the calculation of the free energy of binding. The calculations of the polar solvation term G PB were done with the DelPhi package, 49 with interior and exterior dielectric constants equal to 1 and 80, respectively. A grid spacing of 2/\u00c5, extending 20% beyond the dimensions of the solute, was employed. The non-polar component G NP was obtained using the following relationship: G NP = cSA + b, in which c = 0.00542 kcal/(mol \u00c5 2 ), b = 0.92 kcal/mol, and the surface area was estimated by means of the MSMS software. 50 The last parameter in Eq. 1, that is, the change in solute entropy upon association -TS solute , was calculated through normal-mode analysis. In the first step of this calculation, an 8-\u00c5 sphere around the ligand was cut out from an MD snapshot for each ligand-protein complex. This value was shown to be large enough to yield converged mean changes in solute entropy. On the basis of the size-reduced snapshots of the complex, we generated structures of the uncomplexed reactants by removing the atoms of the protein and ligand, respectively. Each of those structures was minimized, using a distance-dependent dielectric constant e = 4r, to account for solvent screening, and its entropy was calculated using classical statistical formulas and normal mode-analysis. To minimize the effects due to different conformations adopted by individual snapshots we averaged the estimation of entropy over 50 snapshots.",

Missing hydrogen atoms were added to the protein backbone and side chains with LEaP module of AMBER 9. All ionizable residues were considered in the standard ionization state at neutral pH. The geometry of added hydrogens and ions was refined for 200 steps (steepest descent) in vacuum using the parm94 force field. 40 Further protein geometry refinement was carried out using the sander module of AMBER 9 via a combined steepest descent-conjugate gradient algorithm, using as a convergence criterion for the energy gradient the root-mean-square of the Cartesian elements of the gradient equal to 0.01 kcal/(mol \u00c5). The generalized Born/surface area (GB/SA) continuum solvation model 41 was used to mimic a water environment. As expected, no relevant structural changes were observed between RdRp relaxed models and the original 3-D structure.The putative binding site for our compounds on the BVDV RdRp was determined using the ActiveSite_Search option of the Binding Site module of InsightII (v. 2001, Accelrys, San Diego, USA). 33 Active-Site_Search identifies protein active sites or binding sites by locating cavities in the protein structure. According to the Site_Search algorithm employed, the protein is first mapped onto a grid which covers the complete protein space. The grid points are then defined as free points and protein points. The protein points are grid points, within 2 \u00c5 from a hydrogen atom or 2.5 \u00c5 from a heavy atom. Then, a cubic eraser moves from the outside of the protein toward the center to remove the free points until the opening is too small for it to move forward. Those free points not reached by the eraser will be defined as site points. After a site is located, it can be modified by expanding or contracting the site. One layer of grid points at the cavity opening site will be added or removed by each expand or contract operation, respectively.The model structures of all ligand molecules were built and subjected to an initial energy minimization. The convergence criterion was set to 10 \u00c04 kcal/(mol \u00c5). A conformational search was carried out using a well-validated, ad-hoc developed combined molecular mechanics/molecular dynamics simulated annealing (MDSA) protocol. 33, 34 Accordingly, the relaxed structures were subjected to five repeated temperature cycles (from 310 K to 1000 K and back) using constant volume/constant temperature (NVT) MD conditions. At the end of each annealing cycle, the structures were again energy minimized to converge below 10 \u00c04 kcal/ (mol \u00c5), and only the structures corresponding to the minimum energy were used for further modeling. The atomic partial charges for the geometrically optimized compounds were obtained using the RESP procedure, 42 and the electrostatic potentials were produced by single-point quantum mechanical calculations at the Hartree-Fock level with a 6-31G * basis set, using the Merz-Singh-Kollman van der Waals parameters. 43 Eventual missing force field parameters for the compounds considered were generated as follows: AM1 geometry optimization of the structure was followed by RHF/6-31G * single point calculation to obtain the electrostatic potentials. Next, the RESP method was used for charge fitting. The missing bond, angle torsion or van der Waals parameters not included in the parm99 were generated using the antechamber module of AMBER 9.The optimized structures of the inhibitors were docked into the putative enzyme allosteric binding site by applying a consolidated procedure; 33, 34 accordingly, it will be briefly reported below. The software AUTODOCK 3.0 44 was employed to estimate the possible binding orientations of all compounds in the receptor. In order to encase a reasonable region of the protein surface and interior volume, centered on the binding site, the grids were 60 \u00c5 on each side. Grid spacing (0.375 \u00c5), and 120 grid points were applied in each Cartesian direction so as to calculate mass-centered grid maps. AM-BER 12-6 and 12-10 Lennard-Jones parameters were used in modeling van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonding (N-H, O-H and S-H), respectively. In the generation of the electrostatic grid maps, the distance dependent relative permittivity of Mehler and Solmajer was applied. 45 For the docking of each compound to the proteins, three hundred Monte Carlo/Simulated Annealing (MC/ SA) runs were performed, with 100 constant temperature cycles for simulated annealing. For these calculations, the GB/SA implicit water model 41 was used to mimic the solvated environment. The rotation of the angles u and /, and the angles of side chains were set free during the calculations. All other parameters of the MC/ SA algorithm were kept as default. Following the docking procedure, the structure of all compounds were subjected to cluster analysis with a tolerance of 1 \u00c5 for an all-atom root-mean-square deviation from a lower-energy structure representing each cluster family. In the absence of any relevant crystallographic information for our compounds, the structure of each resulting complex characterized by the lowest interaction energy in the prevailing cluster was selected for further evaluation.Each best substrate/RdRp complex resulting from the automated docking procedure was further refined in the AMBER 9 suite using the quenched molecular dynamics (QMD) method. 33, 34 In this case, 1 ns MD simulation at 310 K were employed to sample the conformational space of the substrate-enzyme complex in the GB/SA continuum solvation environment. The integration step was equal to 1 fs and the parm99 force field parameters were applied in the simulations. After each ps, the system was cooled to 0 K, the structure was extensively minimized, and stored. To prevent global conformational changes of the enzyme, the backbone of the protein binding site was constrained by a harmonic force constant of 100 kcal/\u00c5, whereas the amino acid side chains and the ligands were allowed moving without any constraint.The best energy configuration of each complex resulting from the previous step was allowed to relax in a 55-\u00c5 radius sphere of TIP3P water molecules. 46 The resulting system was minimized with a gradual decrease in the position restraints of the protein atoms. At the end of the relaxation process, all water molecules beyond the first hydration shell (i.e., at a distance > 3.5 \u00c5 from any protein atom) were removed. Finally, to achieve electroneutrality, a suitable number of counterions were added to neutralize the system using the leap module of AMBER 9, removing eventually overlapping water molecules. To reduce computational time to reasonable limits, all proteins residues with any atom closer than 20 \u00c5 from the center of mass of each bounded ligand were chosen to be flexible in the dynamic simulations. Subsequently, a spherical TIP3P water cap of radius equal to 20 \u00c5 was centered on each inhibitor in the corresponding RdRp complex, including the hydrating water molecules within the sphere resulting from the previous step. After energy minimization of the new water cap for 10 ps, keeping the protein, the ligand, and the pre-existing waters rigid, followed by a MD equilibration of the entire water sphere with fixed solute for 1 ns, further unfavorable interactions within the structures were relieved by progressively smaller positional restraints on the solute (from 25 to 0 kcal/(mol \u00c5 2 ) for a total of 2 ns. Each system was gradually heated to 310 K in three intervals, allowing a 1 ns interval per each 100 K, and then equilibrated for 5 ns at 310 K, followed by 10 ns of data collection runs, necessary for the estimation of the free energy of binding (vide infra). The MD simulations were performed at constant T = 310 K using the Berendsen",
