Previous studies have shown that peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PPMO) can be an effective antiviral against the PRRS virus (PRRSV). PPMO is structurally similar to DNA with modified backbone and is resistant to nuclease. This study was designed to examine increasing inhibitory effect of PPMO combination. Two pairs of PPMOs were identified to have enhanced suppression of PRRSV replication in cell culture, while individual constituents did not work under the same testing conditions. PPMO 5UP1 that is complementary to 5 terminus of PRRSV genome was paired with 4P1 or 7P1 that are complementary to sequence in the translation initiation regions of ORFs 4 and 7, respectively. The PPMO combination also inhibited replication of heterologous strains in the North American PRRSV genotype. Treatment of the cells with the combinations reduced PRRSV RNA and protein levels. In cell-free or cell-based luciferase reporter assays, the PPMO combination suppressed target mRNA translation more effectively than individual constituents, indicating that the suppression was due to their antisense effect. These results suggest potential application of these PPMO combinations for PRRS control.",

The etiologic agent of PRRS was first isolated on porcine alveolar macrophages in Europe in 1991 and this isolate was designated as Lelystad virus (LV) (Wensvoort et al., 1991) . In 1992, a similar virus was isolated on an MA104-derived cell line, CL 2621, in the U.S. and the isolate was ATCC VR-2332 (Collins et al., 1992) .

North American and European isolates were found to have approximately 67% homology at the nucleotide sequence level. The genome of PRRSV is about 15 kb in length. It has a cap structure at its 5 end and a poly(A) tail at its 3 end (Meng et al., 1994; Meulenberg et al., 1998) . The genome contains nine ORFs and the genome organization starts with the 5 untranslated region (UTR), followed by nine open reading frames (ORF1a, ORF1b, ORF2a, ORF2b, and ORFs 3-7) and 3 UTR. ORFs 1a and 1b are located at the 5 end of the genome and comprise about 80% of the genome.

However, in PMO, each base is joined to a novel backbone consisting of one morpho- (Summerton and Weller, 1997) . PMO is uncharged, water-soluble, and highly resistant to nuclease degradation. PMO binds to target mRNA by Watson-Crick base pairing and exerts an antisense effect by preventing access to critical segments of RNA sequence, such as a translation initiation site, through steric blockade. This is a distinctly different process from the RNase H-dependent mechanism induced by the often-used antisense structural type phosphorothioate DNA (Summerton, 1999) . PMO that are conjugated with short arginine-rich cell penetrating peptides has displayed a higher efficiency in delivery into cultured cells (Moulton and Moulton, 2004) . This peptide-conjugated PMO (PPMO) has been found to be fairly stable in cells and human serum for at least 24 h (Youngblood et al., 2007) . The sequence-specific antiviral efficacy of peptideconjugated PMO compounds has been documented against a number of viruses in animal models, including PPMO against Ebola virus (Enterlein et al., 2006; Warfield et al., 2006) , Coxsackievirus B3 (Yuan et al., 2006) , murine coronavirus (Burrer et al., 2007) , Dengue virus , and West Nile virus (Deas et al., 2007; Deas et al., 2005) .",

In contrast, treatment of CRL11171 cells with a combination of 2 M 5UP1 and 16 M of the other PPMOs against PRRSV resulted in complete inhibition of PRRSV yield, which was below detection level (data not shown). To further assess the effect of PPMO combination, the 5UP1 concentration was reduced from 2 to 0.5 M and the other PPMOs were reduced to 8 M. Treatment with 5UP1 alone at the concentration of 0.5 M did not reduce virus yield compared to virus control or mock treatment ( Fig. 2A) . Among all of the PPMO pairs tested, a combination of 0.5 M 5UP1 and 8 M 4P1, 6P1, or 7P1 showed more enhanced inhibition effects on PRRSV replication than other PPMO pairs ( Fig. 2A) . CRL11171 cells treated with 0.5 M 5UP1 in conjunction with 8 M of 4P1, 6P1, or 7P1 caused a 1 to 2 log 10 reduction in PRRSV yield in comparison to the pair of 5UP1 + CP1 control.

This experiment was repeated three times and similar results were observed each time. These results demonstrated that combination of 5UP1 (0.5 M) with 4P1 or 7P1 (8 or 16 M) was more effective in inhibiting PRRSV replication than a constituent individual PPMO of the pairs.

Previous work at this lab has demonstrated that treatment of CRL11171 cells with 16 M 5UP1 led to a significant reduction in PRRSV minus-strand RNA synthesis (Zhang et al., 2006) . To assess the effect of PPMO combination on PRRSV RNA synthesis, CRL11171 cells were treated with the two pairs of PPMO combinations, 5UP1 + 4P1 and 5UP1 + 7P1 and harvested at 40 h p.i. for RNA isolation. The 5UP1 PPMO was used at the concentration of 0.5 M, while 4P1 or 7P1 was tested at two different concentrations of 8 and 16 M. Real-time RT-PCR was performed to assess the levels of PRRSV genomic RNA. PPMO 5UP1 at the concentration of 0.5 M had no effect on viral RNA level, consistent with virus yield titration. PPMO 4P1 or 7P1 at the concentration of 16 M also did not lead to much reduction of viral RNA level when compared to that in mock-treatment control (Fig. 3) . The combination of 5UP1 (0.5 M) with 4P1 (16 M) or 7P1 (8 or 16 M) led to over 1000-fold (3 log 10 ) reduction of viral RNA level (Fig. 3) . Moderate reduction in viral RNA level was observed when the combination of 5UP1 (0.5 M) with 4P1 (8 M) was used. The results indicate the treatment with PPMO combination had enhanced effect on the inhibition of PRRSV RNA synthesis. It was noted that the 5UP1 and CP1 combination also slightly reduced the viral RNA level compared to the mock treatment, which is consistent with viral yield reduction shown in Fig. 2B . However, this reduction in viral RNA level was much smaller than that by combination of 5UP1 with 7P1 or 4P1.",

The 312-nt sequence of PRRSV 5 UTR region from subgenomic RNA7 was cloned upstream of a luciferase reporter gene in pCiNeoLuc vector. In this assay, PPMO binding to its target RNA was expected to inhibit its translation, leading to lower luciferase yield. Cell-free transcription and translation were conducted to assess the luciferase yield in the presence and absence of PPMO. In this test, the cellular uptake of PPMO was avoided and the direct effect of PPMO combination on target mRNA translation was determined. Different concentrations of PPMOs were used to determine dose-responsive reduction of luciferase yield. The 5UP1 at the concentrations of 5 and 50 nM resulted in the reduction of luciferase yield to 26% and 11%, respectively, compared to the mock-treatment control (Fig. 5A) . The 7P1 at the concentrations of 5 and 50 nM resulted in the reduction of luciferase yield to 55% and 36%, respectively. When 1 nM 5UP1 was combined with 5 and 50 nM 7P1, the luciferase production was down to 44% and 32%, respectively. When 5 nM 5UP1 was combined with 5 and 50 nM 7P1, the luciferase production was down to 12% and 9%, respectively, which were far lower than that of each of these two PPMOs alone. When 5UP1 was combined with CP1, the luciferase yields were similar to the values of 5UP1 alone. The result demonstrated that the combination PPMO's enhanced effect on inhibition of target mRNA translation was sequence-specific.",

To our surprise, the combination of 5UP1 at 2 M with all the other PPMOs tested completely inhibited VR2385 replication to below detection level, while 5UP1 alone at 2 M had a little effect. This result suggests the enhanced effect of combination of two PPMOs. PPMO 5UP1 at the concentration of 0.5 M was paired with 8 or 16 M of the other PPMOs. Of the total six pairs in combination, two pairs, 5UP1 + 4P1 and 5UP1 + 7P1 showed effective inhibition of PRRSV replication. But individual PPMOs alone at the concentrations tested did not have inhibitory effect. Virus titration clearly demonstrated that 5UP1 combined with 4P1 or 7P1 was effective in a dose-responsive manner in inhibiting PRRSV production in infected cells.

It is likely that the combinatory effect of blocking both target sites was responsible for the reduction of PRRSV replication since combination of 5UP1 with CP1 or the other PRRSV PPMOs did not have the enhanced effect. The reason that the other pairs were less effective is not clear, but could be due to inaccessibility of PRRSV target sequence or successful PPMO/target-RNA hybrid did not affect PRRSV replication.

The RNA level from the cells treated with the 5UP1 at 0.5 M with 4P1 or 7P1 at 16 M was about 2 log 10 , which was unexpected since the virus yield was below detection level. The possible reasons are Lelystad is a prototype of European PRRSV genotype. All other strains are North American PRRSV genotype. \"Mock\" is virus infection control without PPMO.

The first speculation might be the case since the virus RNA translation initiates right after entry into the cells. It is expected that pretreatment of the cells with the PPMOs before virus inoculation would reduce the virus RNA translation. But our previous results showed that treatment post-virus inoculation led to stronger reduction of virus yield (Zhang et al., 2006) . The second speculation is more plausible since the virus titration assay did not detect PRRSV from the cells treated with the two PPMO pairs. In addition to the inhibition at RNA level, the PPMO combination also led to inhibition of viral N protein expression. This result is consistent with the reduction of PRRSV genomic RNA level. The reduction of N protein in cells treated with 5UP1 + 4P1 indicates that PRRSV subgenomic RNA synthesis was reduced since 4P1 does not bind to subgenomic RNA7 and inhibit its translation.",

Due to its easy transmission and high variability of PRRSV, and the lack of a broadly protective vaccine, the control of this disease is difficult. Current vaccines available have limited effect, especially when used against the heterologous PRRSV strains, which are commonly found in outbreaks. PPMO combinations of 5UP1 + 4P1 and 5UP1 + 7P1 inhibited replication of 10 North American PRRSV strains in our crossstrain inhibition assay.

Analysis of PRRSV sequences from the GenBank indicates that the comple-mentary sequences of 5UP1 and 7P1 are highly conserved across North American PRRSV strains (Patel et al., 2008) . Thus, these two pairs of PPMOs have the potential for application against most North American PRRSV strains. It would be a plausible advantage to use PPMO combinations rather than a single PPMO in consideration of heterologous PRRSV strains in the field and potential benefit to have less chance in generation of escape mutant virus.
