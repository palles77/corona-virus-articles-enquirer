Twenty-one cloned Acanthamoeba isolates designated as IMU1 to IMU21 were established from the positive primary cultures. Five species were identified from the 16 isolates according to the morphological criteria of Pussard and Pons; i.e. A. castellanii, A. culbertsoni, A. griffini, A. hatchetti and A. polyphaga. Species identities for the remaining five isolates (IMU4, IMU5, IMU15, IMU20 and IMU21), however, could not be determined morphologically. At genotypic characterization, these isolates were placed into T3 (IMU14); T5 (IMU16 and IMU17) and T4 (all the remaining isolates). To predict the potential pathogenicity of these Acanthamoeba isolates, thermo-and osmotolerance tests were employed; many isolates were predicted as potential human pathogens based on the outcome of these tests. This is the first time potentially pathogenic Acanthamoeba have been isolated from air-conditioners in Malaysia.",

The speciation of Acanthamoeba is mainly based on cyst structure as described by Pussard and Pons (1977) . Based on this, over 20 species have been described (Visvesvara, 1991) . However, polymorphism of cysts within a cloned cell line, influence of growth condition in altering cyst features, and the inability to accurately differentiate or identify Acanthamoeba spp. based on subtle differences in cyst features have made this morphological taxonomic scheme unreliable and difficult (Sawyer, 1971; Stratford and Griffiths, 1978; Walochnik et al., 2002) . Other non-morphological techniques such as biochemical and molecular analyses were used to differentiate members of the genus (de Jonckheere, 1983; Khan and Paget, 2002; Kong et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2005) . The most promising technique currently used is phylogenetic analysis of the complete nuclear 18S rRNA gene sequence. This approach was first used by Gast et al. in 1996 , who employed molecular genotying for the taxonomic characterization of the Acanthamoeba genus (Gast et al., 1996) . Today, 15 genotypes (T1 to T15) have been discovered within the genus, with a divergence of >5% between the most closely related genotypes (Stothard et al., 1998; Horn et al., 1999; Gast, 2001; Hewett et al., 2003) .",

Pathogenic Acanthamoeba isolates are recognized as the causative agents of opportunistic granulomatous amoebic encephalitis, cutaneous acanthamoebiasis, Acanthamoeba pneumonitis, and the non-opportunistic Acanthamoeba keratitis (Martinez, 1991; Rosenberg and Morgan, 2001; Marciano-Cabral and Cabral, 2003; Sukthanaa et al., 2005; mailto:fschuste@dhs.ca.govAwwad et al., 2007) . Until now, the pathogenesis for Acanthamoeba infections remain poorly understood. The ability to grow at high temperature and osmolarity, are presumed hallmarks of pathogenic Acanthamoeba. These observations may be explained by the need for Acanthamoeba trophozoite to withstand the human body temperature or the osmolarity of human tear film in order to secure a successful invasion (Walochnik et al., 2000; Khan et al., 2001; Khan, 2006) . Currently, thermo-and osmotolerance tests are used to predict the pathogenic potential of environmental isolates. Under these test conditions, potentially pathogenic Acanthamoeba are able to grow at temperature \u226537 \u2022 C, and on non-nutrient agar incorporated with 1 M mannitol (Khan and Tareen, 2003; Kilic et al., 2004; Lorenzo-Morales et al., 2005a,b) .",

To date, there is no direct evidence indicating that poor indoor air quality could be a source for Acanthamoeba infection. Neverthe-less, contaminated indoor air handling system has been shown to be the source for numerous outbreaks of air-borne diseases such as the aspergillosis, Legionnaires' disease caused by bacteria Legionella pneumophila, and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome caused by SARS virus (O'Mahony et al., 1990; Lutz et al., 2003; Li et al., 2004) . The tropical climate of Malaysia which is generally warm throughout the year has encouraged the use of air-conditioners. This could inevitably increase the risk of the building occupants to exposure of biogenic indoor air-pollutants such as cysts and trophozoites of Acanthamoeba spp. Therefore, the present study sought to detect and characterize Acanthamoeba spp. in air-conditioners in Malaysia using morphological and molecular techniques.

All primary cultures containing Acanthamoeba spp. were subjected to cloning and axenisation. After the series of procedures, only 31 out of 59 cloned cell lines were successfully axenised and established into stable cultures. The clonality and identity of the established axenic cell lines were checked by direct sequencing of the ASA.S1 amplicons. Analyses on the DNA sequences revealed that 10 of the cloned isolates were mixtures as overlapping DNA sequences were obtained for them. The remaining pure clones were subjected to further characterization. They were designated as IMU1 to IMU21. Eleven different ASA.S1 sequences were amplified from the 21 axenic Acanthamoeba cell lines as indicated by multiple sequence alignment analyses. Strains that had identical gene sequences were clustered into the same group. Altogether, there were five such groups: (IMU1, IMU2, IMU6 and IMU7); (IMU4 and IMU5); (IMU10, IMU11, IMU12 and IMU13); (IMU16, IMU17); and (IMU19, IMU20 and IMU21). Nucleotide similarities search analyses indicated that most of the present ASA.S1 sequences displayed closest sequence identities (99-100%) to the 18S rRNA gene segments belonging to various Acanthamoeba spp. deposited in the GenBank database. The only exception was the ASA.S1 sequences of IMU16 and IMU17 which only gave best scores of 97% identities to the 18S rRNA gene segments of five strains of A. lenticulata (Table 1 ). In should be noted that DNA information contained within ASA.S1 amplicons is meant for genotyping and not for species identification. This is because many of the present sequences showed remarkable high sequence similarities (97-99%) with sequences belonging to different Acanthamoeba species at the same time (Table 1) . Genotypic classifications of IMU1 to IMU21 were done by assembling and comparing the ASA.S1 sequences of these isolate with reference sequences encompassing all the currently established genotypes of Acanthamoeba, including selected sequences which most closely resembled the ASA.S1 sequences obtained in the study. According to the tree constructed, IMU14 was placed into T3 genotype, IMU16 and IMU17 were identified as T5 isolates and the remaining 18 isolates were assigned to T4 genotype (Fig. 1) .",

It was observed that all investigated isolates have cyst sizes \u226418 m, and are therefore identified as either Group II or Group III Acanthamoeba. Isolates recognized as having Group II morphology were IMU1 to IMU9, IMU14, IMU15, and IMU18 to IMU21. Some of these isolates could be identified further to specific species based on the Pussard and Pons' key (1977) . They were A. castellanii (IMU1 to IMU3, IMU6, IMU7, IMU9 and IMU18); A. culbertsoni (IMU10 to IMU13); A. griffini (IMU14); A. lenticulata (IMU16 and IMU17), and A. polyphaga (IMU8 and IMU19) (Fig. 2, Table 2 ). Species identity for the remaining five isolates, however, could not be determined morphologically. Cysts of IMU4 and IMU5 resembled each other. Both isolates have polygonal cysts. The cysts arms were truncated, ranging from six to seven in number. Ectocysts were wrinkled and closely attached to endocysts. These characteristics were common to both A. castellanii and A. polyphaga (Fig. 3) . IMU15 revealed the cyst morphology of either A. hatchetti or A. polyphaga. This isolate has squarish or pentagonal endocysts. Ectocysts were wrinkled and were in close contact with the underlying endocysts, conforming to the shape of the later (Fig. 3) . Cysts of IMU20 and IMU21 resembled each others. Cysts of these isolates often have pentagonal and occasionally stellate endocysts, and the ectocysts were loosely applied to endocyst, and these cysts features resembled to cysts of A. polyphaga. However, their ectocyst was rather smooth in contrast to ectocyst of A. polyphaga which was wrinkled. Therefore these three isolates could only be identified under the genus of Acanthamoeba (Fig. 3) . The remaining six isolates were placed into Group III.

Microorganisms like algae, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa are probably present within the air particles in the return air and fresh air, and these would be retained at the grilles. These microorganisms would accumulate and proliferate here and serve as food source for other free-living organisms such as the Acanthamoeba spp. It is possible that fresh outdoor air could carry additional Acanthamoeba into the indoor air.

It is postulated that the fiber filter of the air-handler failed to retain all air-borne solid particles, especially the microorganisms. Microorganisms such as Acanthamoeba spp. would possibly transfer to the respective vents by air flow. Less Acanthamoeba spp. were detected at the vents compared to that at air-handlers. This is possibly due to the distance that air needed to travel from the air-handlers to the vents, allowing dilution of the Acanthamoeba cells carried within the air. Since conditioned air was recirculated in an enclosed environment, these pollutants would in time, accumulate indoors. Therefore, it is postulated that the use of air-conditioners could increase the exposure risk of building occupants to air-borne Acanthamoeba infections.",

The frequent cleaning of these machines certainly could help to prevent the growth of Acathamoeba spp. at these machines.

As many as five Acanthamoeba isolates could not be identified with confidence based on morphological characteristics. Furthermore, the present study clearly showed that culture conditions (xenic vs. axenic) could greatly distort the typical cyst features of Acanthamoeba isolates. Our findings on the inconsistency of cyst features influenced by culture conditions concur with those reported previously (Sawyer, 1971; Stratford and Griffiths, 1978) . In the present study, all the Acanthamoeba isolates investigated were genotyped using DNA sequencing with the JDP1-JDP2 primers. However, this approach is limited by a drawback; the amount of DNA information obtained was insufficient to discrimi-nate isolates closely related to T3, T4 and T11 genotypes (Schroeder et al., 2001) . The better way to differentiate Acanthamoeba genotypes is probably to sequence the complete 18S rRNA genes; however, this is not possible in the current study due to financial constraint. To date, the taxonomic status of Acanthamoeba genus is still evolving. The decision on whether to classify Acanthamoeba isolates by genotypes or specific names is still debated. Although publications and DNA sequences deposited into GenBank database reflect the current trend on the use of molecular genotyping of Acanthamoeba spp., the value of morphological characteristics should not be entirely excluded. Morphological classification of Acanthamoeba spp. should be preserved, at least until a globally standardized scheme is established.",

The greater abundance of T4 isolates in our environment samples probably reflects their better adaptation to limited growth condition relative to isolates from other genotypes. On the other hand, the isolations of two T5 Acanthamoeba isolates from central air-conditioners could signify that these sampling sites have high moisture content. Our postulation was deduced from other studies which reported the frequent isolations of this rare Acanthamoeba genotype from aquatic environment (Lorenzo-Morales et al., 2005a,b; Rivera and Adao, 2008; Huang and Hsu, 2010) .",

These observations have led us to postulate that all present Acanthamoeba isolates can survive and grow in human bodies which have an average body temperature of \u00b137 \u2022 C, and are therefore considered as potential human pathogenic isolates. Other studies have demonstrated that a higher environmental temperature would favor the growth of thermotolerant Acanthamoeba. It is believed that such isolates could have evolved through natural selection to adapt to the heat stress in their niche (Rivera et al., 1993; Gianinazzi et al., 2009) . However, unlike these findings, our study did not show such association. The site of Acanthamoeba isolations in the present study, i.e. the grilles at air-handler units, the vents at ceilings and the grilles of room airconditioners are either at low temperature (\u223c25 \u2022 C during office hour, with an operating duration of 10.5 h per day, from Monday to Friday each week), or at ambient temperature (>30 \u2022 C, during nonoffice hours). However, the present study could not entirely rule out the possible influence of niche heat stress on the better survival of thermotolerant Acanthamoeba in air-conditioners. The origin of the air-conditioner Acanthamoeba isolates investigated in the present study could not be identified. As mentioned earlier, they could be from outdoor fresh air or from indoors, including building occupants. It is known that the climate of Malaysia is generally warm; the highest outdoor temperature being recorded in Kuala Lumpur could even achieve 37 \u2022 C (National Environment Agency, 2009). Therefore, it is likely that a higher proportion of Acanthamoeba isolates in the Malaysian environment, particularly in Kuala Lumpur are naturally thermotolerant. This assumption may help to explain the isolations of large numbers of thermotolerant air-conditioner Acanthamoeba isolates in the present study. On the other hand, cysts of all Acanthamoeba isolates retained their viability after overnight exposure to temperature up to 52 \u2022 C. The remarkable tolerance and resilience of Acanthamoeba cysts to extreme growth temperature probably contribute to the ubiquity, abundance and persistent occurrence of these free-living amoebae in diverse environments. This physiological characteristic may also enable the cyst to serve as the ideal vehicle for transmitting Acanthamoeba infection from environment to human, and their persistence in the human host.",

Our finding was complementary to the findings by el Sibae in Egypt, who managed to detect Acanthamoeba polyphaga in cooling towers; the outdoor units of air-conditioning systems (el Sibae, 1993) . The air-conditioner is essential in commercial as well as residential settings for comfort. Its wide use is attributed to the increase in climatic temperature due to global warming, and as a symbol of development and modern lifestyles. Our findings should alert us on the risk of acquiring Acanthamoeba infections through the use of poorly maintained air-conditioners. In addition, although environmental Acanthamoeba spp. feed on surrounding bacteria, fungal and other free-living organisms, they could be host for certain endosymbionts such as the pathogenic Legionella pneumophila, Parachlamydia and mimivirus, and indirectly become agents of transmission for these pathogens. Therefore, it is important to understand the interactions between Acanthamoeba spp. and the surrounding microorganisms, especially the pathogenic microbes. In order to decrease the risk of building occupants being exposed to both pathogenic Acanthamoeba spp. and their endosymbionts, regularly cleaning and decontamination of air-conditioners using effective Acanthamoeba cidal cleansing solutions are essential (Srikanth and Berk, 1993) .",
