Although infected and noninfected patients were separated, nosocomial transmission continued, largely because of the lack of minimal aseptic procedures, coupled with the fact that infected patients were not separated from each other by disease. By 1890 to 1900, nursing textbooks discussed recommendations for practicing aseptic procedures and designating separate floors or wards for patients with similar diseases, thereby beginning to solve the problems of nosocomial transmission (Lynch, 1949) .",

These practices were used in U.S. infectious disease hospitals. By the 1960s, the designation of specifically designed single-or multiple-patient isolation rooms in general hospitals and outpatient treatment for tuberculosis caused these specialized hospitals (which since the 1950s had housed tuberculosis patients almost exclusively) to close .",

In using the disease-specific isolation precautions, the issue of mistakes in applying the precautions arose if the patient carried a disease not often seen or treated in the hospital (Garner, 1984; Haley, 1985) , if the diagnosis was delayed, or if a misdiagnosis occurred. This happened even if additional training of personnel was encouraged. These factors, coupled with increased knowledge of epidemiologic patterns of disease, led to subsequent updates of portions of the CDC reports: \u25a0 Recommendations for the management of patients with suspected hemorrhagic fever published in 1988 (CDC, 1988) \u25a0 Recommendations for respiratory isolation for human parvovirus B19 infection specific to patients who were immunodeficient and had chronic human parvovirus B19 infection or were in transient aplastic crisis (CDC, 1989) \u25a0 Recommendations for the management of tuberculosis, which stemmed from increasing concern for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, especially in human immunodeficiency virus ( ",

An apron or other barrier was also to be worn to keep the provider's own clothing and skin clean. It was recommended also that personnel be immunized if proof of immunity could not be documented when barriers, such as masks, could not prevent transmission by airborne routes (e.g., rubella, chickenpox). Additionally, when immunity was not possible, as with pulmonary tuberculosis, masks were to be worn during all patient contact. Goggles or glasses, hair covers, and shoe covers were also used as barriers. Careful handling of all used sharps, recapping of needles without using the hands, and the disposal of used items in rigid punctureresistant containers were stressed. Trash and soiled linen from all patients were bagged and handled in the same manner. This approach sought to protect the patient from contracting nosocomial infections and the provider from bacterial or viral pathogens that might originate with the patient.",
