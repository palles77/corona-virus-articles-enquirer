Research suggests that vitamin D deficiency (VDD) puts children at risk for ALRI. The purpose of this review is to examine ALRI and VDD in children 5 years and younger. Common etiologies, diagnosis, prevention, treatment of ALRI, and recommendations for vitamin D supplementation are summarized. Method: Databases were searched for studies investigating VDD and ALRI in children. Independent reviewers assessed the internal validity of the studies. Results: Of 18 studies examined, VDD was found to be associated with increased risk or severity of ALRI in 13 studies; associations were not found in 4 studies. In one study it was found that high maternal vitamin D levels was associated with ALRI in infants. Discussion: Vitamin D supplementation is a low-cost, lowrisk intervention that providers should consider for children, especially those at high risk for ALRI. Practitioners should follow current recommendations when prescribing vitamin D supplementation for infants and children. J Pediatr Health Care. (2014) 28, 572-582.",

It was thought that the efficacy of phototherapy might be due to sunlight increasing vitamin D levels. After the discovery of antibiotics, light intervention was abandoned. However, more than a century later, the possibilities of vitamin D for prevention and treatment of respiratory illnesses are now being researched again (Camargo et al., 2011; Manaseki-Holland et al., 2010) .",

Palivizumab dosage is 15 mg per kg (AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases, 2009) and costs on average $1074 per 50mg vial (Mahadevia, Masaquel, Polak, & Weiner, 2012) , making the treatment cost for a 3-kg infant approximately $966 for a single dose of palivizumab, or approximately $5000 for 5 months' administration early in life. As the child grows, so does the dose required. In the second year of life, the cost can be $3000 per month (for a child who weighs more than 10 kg) or up to $15,000 for 5 months of the RSV season (Hampp et al., 2011) . In Florida's Medicaid population, Hampp and associates (2011) concluded that the cost of palivizumab prophylaxis to prevent RSV-related hospitalizations ''far exceeded the savings associated with prevented hospitalizations'' (p. 502).

Cultural and health practices can contribute to vitamin D insufficiency or VDD by preventing infants from acquiring vitamin D from sun exposure. First, in some cultures infants are swaddled when outdoors, minimizing their sun exposure (Najada, Habashneh, & Khader, 2004) . Second, applying sunscreen to limit the sun's damage to skin is recommended, especially in children, because 25% of lifetime sun exposure is estimated to occur before 18 years of age, a time of high vulnerability to the potentially toxic effects of sun exposure (Balk & AAP, Council on Environmental Health and Section on Dermatology, 2011). However, sunscreen suppresses cutaneous synthesis of vitamin D3 by blocking the absorption of ultraviolet B radiation (Matsuoka, Ide, Wortsman, MacLaughlin, & Holick, 1987) . Third, mothers are likely to have vitamin D insufficiency or VDD for the same reasons as their infants (Lee et al., 2007) . At its best, breast milk provides little vitamin D and even less if a mother is vitamin D deficient (Wagner & Greer, 2008) .",

In a study of 152 children younger than 59 months of age with pneumonia at Al-Sabeen hospital in Sana'a, Yemen, VDD was an independent predictor of persistent hypoxemia for children admitted with pneumonia (p = .021; Banajeh, 2009 ). Rachitic children were four times more likely than nonrachitic children to fail to respond to treatment 30 days after enrollment in the study (20.6 vs. 6%; 95% CI, 1.2-14.4; p = .029). Treatment failure was defined as modification of treatment because of worsening clinical condition, development of a comorbid condition, such as bacterial meningitis, or death. Likewise, Inamo and colleagues (2011) studied 28 infants in Tokyo, Japan, and found that, compared with infants who had 25(OH)D levels of 6 ng/ml or more, infants with 25(OH)D levels of < 4 ng/ml were significantly more likely to need supplementary oxygen and ventilator management (p < .01). Similarly, McNally and colleagues (2009), previously discussed, found that children with ALRI in a Canadian pediatric intensive care unit had significantly lower vitamin D levels than did control subjects, who were children hospitalized for something other than ALRI (19.6 AE 9.6 vs. 33.2 AE 12.0 ng/ml, p = .001).

In a study in Sana'a, Yemen, Banajeh (2009) found that VDD significantly decreased the percentage of circulating polymorph nuclear neutrophils (37% vs. 47%; adjusted OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.53-0.95; p = .02), which are important innate immune cells that migrate into the lung tissues and kill bacteria and viruses through phagocytosis. In a randomized controlled trial conducted in Afghanistan by Manaseki-Holland and colleagues (2010) , 224 children admitted with pneumonia were randomly assigned to receive either a single-dose 100,000 IU oral vitamin D supplement or a placebo. No vitamin D levels were assessed during the trial, and it was not stated when the supplements or placebos were administered. Manaseki-Holland and associates (2010) assessed the frequency of repeat pneumonia episodes during the 90-day posttreatment period. Children who received a vitamin D supplement had a significantly lower risk of a repeat episode compared with children who received a placebo (92 vs. 122; RR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64-.94; p=.01). These results suggest vitamin D supplementation might strengthen the immune system. Because Manaseki-Holland and colleagues (2010) did not assess vitamin D levels, it is not known whether the children had VDD.",

As needed, we converted vitamin D values to nanogram per milliliter to facilitate comparison between studies. In addition, researchers used thresholds ranging from 9 to 20 ng/ml to determine VDD (see Table 3 ). This range could explain why some studies found that VDD was significantly associated with ALRI in children, but others did not.

Camargo and colleagues (2007) further relied on maternal recall by asking mothers to complete a food frequency questionnaire and then using the information to assess vitamin D intake. Maternal self-report can be inaccurate because mothers might incorrectly remember past events or not understand the questions. Also, mothers might hesitate to report their children's illnesses if they believe reporting illnesses would reflect poorly on their abilities as mothers and be less socially acceptable (Lau, Hurst, Smith, & Schanler, 2007) .",

However, the researchers used a single bronchiolitis score for each child, which does not accurately reflect the extent or severity of illness over time. Additionally, Carroll and colleagues did not specify when the bronchiolitis score was determined, and scores can vary widely, depending on the timing of assessment (e.g., on admission versus prior to discharge) and when the infant had last undergone suctioning or received a respiratory treatment. These data collection methods have weaknesses that could affect the study's results. Another weakness is the lack of data on serum vitamin D levels. Neither randomized controlled trial (Manaseki-Holland et al., 2010; Manaseki-Holland et al., 2012) measured serum vitamin D levels either prior to administering vitamin D supplementation or after administration.

Roth and colleagues (2009) suggested that the causative agent might explain the difference in findings between their study and the study by Wayse and associates (2004) , noting that bacterial pneumonia is common in developing countries like India, but the study by Roth and associates (2009) in Canada included mostly patients with viral ALRI.

Most prenatal vitamins contain 400 IU vitamin D. For all breastfed infants, the AAP recommends a 400 IU vitamin D supplement daily beginning soon after birth for all breastfed infants, as well as children who consume less than 1 L of vitamin D-fortified formula or milk per day and adolescents who obtain less than 400 IU vitamin D per day through vitamin D-fortified milk or foods (Wagner & Greer, 2008) . Vitamin D supplementation forms for infants and children are listed in Table 4 (Casey et al., 2010) . Of note, there is a discrepancy between the multivitamin dose manufacturers recommend for 2-and 3-year-old children (1/2 tablet, 200 IU) and the amount of vitamin D the AAP recommends for vitamin D supplementation (400 IU).",
