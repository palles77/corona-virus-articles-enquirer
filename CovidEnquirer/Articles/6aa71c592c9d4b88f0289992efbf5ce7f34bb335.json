As a respiratory disease, influenza A virus (IAV) infection can lead to hepatitis, but the mechanism remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the occurrence of hepatitis by establishing a model for infected mice for three different subtypes of respiratory IAVs (H1N1, H5N1, and H7N2). Histological analysis was performed, and results showed increase serum aminotransferase (ALT and AST) levels and evident liver injury on days 3 and 7, especially on day 5 post infection. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) results indicated a wide distribution of IAV's positive signals in the liver of infected mice. Real-time PCR results further revealed a similar viral titer to IHC that presented a remarkedly positive correlation with histology injury. All these data showed that the mouse model suitably contributed valuable information about the mechanism underlying the occurrence of hepatitis induced by respiratory influenza virus.",

Its genome consists of eight RNA fragments, two of which encode two important surface glycoproteins called hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). According to its antigenicity, this virus can be divided into 18 HA subtypes (H1~H18) and 11 NA subtypes (N1~N11). At present, some of the combination between different HA subtypes and NA subtypes have been detected [1] . Depending on the virus strain, different IAVs have different pathogenesis for the infection. Low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIV) cause mild respiratory symptoms and are sometimes accompanied with a gastrointestinal infection. Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV), including H5N1 and H7N9, can cause multi-organ systemic infection and even fatal diseases [2] . The main clinical feature of these cases is the different degrees of pneumonia manifesting as fever, cough, and difficulty in breathing.",

Moreover, the structural disorder of hepatic lobules and necrosis with dissolved nucleus in the liver cells was seen in H5N1 infected mice. On day 5 p.i., a more noticeable hemorrhaging was seen in the hepatic sinusoidal and central veins and a large amount of red blood cells was observed between the cells, in which certain cells dissolved. Inflammatory cell infiltration, including lymphocyte and neutrophils in the hepatic sinusoida veinl was noted in the H5N1 infected group. On day 7 p.i., the liver appeared to have vacuolization and acidophilic degeneration accompanied with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. H5N1 infected animals displayed more severe pathological damage among the three IAV infected groups. The pathological damage in these infected mice was most serious on day 5 p.i but mild on day 3 and 7. No clear histopathological change was seen in PBS treated mice (Fig. 3) . The scores in the pathological changes were also shown. These results suggested that the three IAV subtypes can induce liver injury and H5N1causes the most serious pathological lesions among them.",

That respiratory, gastrointestinal, and other mucosal tissues have experienced viral replication or immune damage, but do not influence non-mucosal organs, such as the liver or kidney [11] [12] [13] . However, some contradicting findings were obtained, such that a pandemic A \u2044 H1N1 (2009) influenza A virus, which is different from seasonal influenza, can lead to liver damage [14] . An abrupt and massive increase in aminotransferase levels is the first direct evidence of liver injury [15] [16] [17] . Unexpectedly, we observed that the three subtypes of respiratory influenza infection in mice caused not only damage in the lungs but also in the liver accompanied with clear upregulation of AST in serum. Given that these symptoms resembles those exhibited by humans after influenza infection, our influenza virus infected mice provided a good model for studying the underlying mechanisms of how respiratory influenza infection causes liver damage. Influenza productively infects the upper respiratory tract to host a trypsin-like enzyme and activate the viral hemagglutin. Liver injury associated with influenza virus infection is uncommon. In case of influenza with accompanying liver damage, no direct evidence is available for viral replication in liver. Therefore, the means for associating influenza infection with damage to tissues or organs is still unclear when these injuries are not induced by direct viral infection. After respiratory A/Kawasaki/86 (H1N1) virus infection, the C57BL/6 (B6) mice displayed \"collateral damage\" in liver without viral replication. Further study found that Kupffer cells and apoptotic hepatocytes mediated inflammatory injury [18] . Hypoxic hepatitis was a clinical characteristic in the H7N9 infection [9] . Recent data further confirmed that hypoxic hepatitis can be an important causative factor for acute liver failure associated with influenza virus infection instead of virus related hepatitis [19] . We know that highly pathogenic influenza virus leads to respiratory failure, which reduces the oxygen supply to the liver, and hypoxic hepatitis is a likely cause of severe liver impairment in our study. In our study, viral antigens were widely distributed in the liver of the different influenza virus subtype-infected mice during the infection stage, especially the H5N1-infected group. As expected, a certain relationship exists between the degree of pathological injury in liver (revealed by HE) and the viral load in liver (detected by qRT-PCR).",

The molecular structure and sensitivity of HA to host cell proteases directly affect the virulence of the virus. The majority of LPAIV, which contain a single arginine (R) or rarely include a lysine (K) at the HA cleavage site, usually cause a local infection. By contrast, the HPAIV of subtypes H5 and H7 possesses the consensus sequence R-X-R/K-R, which supports systemic infections [20] . In this study, among the three virus subtypes, H1N1 and H5N1 caused a high viral load in liver on the basis of the qPCR results. By contrast, H7N2 was a low pathogenic virus that caused a very small amount of virus in the liver. The results of the histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses further showed that pathological damage was present in the same data. However, only H5N1 virus possesses the R-K-K-R amino acid sequence at the cleavage site. The different levels of liver injury caused by influenza infection in this research were independent from the viral HA genes. Thus, a large scale study should be performed to determine the contribution of respiratory influenza virus inducing hepatic tropism and deduce the correlation between them.",
