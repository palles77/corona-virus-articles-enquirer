            "text": "During the evolution of the human species, infectious diseases have also evolved. The emergence of new diseases and the resurgence of old ones are a challenge to humanity. 1 Emerging infectious diseases are rapidly increasing in frequency and geographic range. Among these, zoonotic diseases account for billions of cases of human illness and millions of deaths every year, constituting a persistent health problem worldwide. 2 Mosquitos (Diptera: Culididae) are vectors of pathogens and parasites of health diseases, such as dengue, zika, Chikungunya and lymphatic filariasis. 3 Additionally, mosquito control is of great importance throughout the world, especially in tropical and subtropical areas. 3 . However, the use of insecticides to kill mosquitoes has led to the development of resistance. 3 In general, zoonotic viruses are transmitted to humans by hematophagous insects, such as mosquitoes, sandflies, ticks, and biting midges, and they are called arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses). 2 In this sense, Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arthropod-borne virus that belongs to the genus Alphavirus of the family Togariridae. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] It is transmitted by the bite of female mosquitoes of the Aedes aegypti, A. albopictus, A. furcifer species 12 and Culex ssp. 2, 4, 5, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Based on this, CHIKV can be transmitted through an urban cycle, man to mosquito to man, or through a sylvatic cycle, animal to mosquito to man. 18 Although in recent epidemic some cases were related to maternal-fetal transmission. 19 In 1952, CHIKV was firstly identified during an epidemic in Tanzania. In 2004, the global re-emergence of CHIKV started in Kenya, after which it spread to different islands in the Indian Ocean. Since the end of 1999, CHIKV infection has been reported in many countries in Central and South Americans, causing an estimated 11675,000 cases. 4, 8, 20, 21 Actually, CHIKV is considered a real health problem where the Aedes mosquitoes thrive. 4 In 2008, the United State National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) included CHIKV into category C priority pathogen: this category is related to pathogens that could be utilized for mass dissemination in the future, due to their high morbidity and mortality rates and those with major health impacts. 12,22",

[23] [24] [25] Normally, the CHIKV symptoms begin between 4 and 7 days after a mosquito bite, it causes Chikungunya fever, which has symptoms, such as fever, arthralgia and, in some cases, a maculopapular rash. 4, 5, 7, 9, [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] It is rarely lethal, the disease proceeds in 60% of infected patients into a chronic stage that is characterized by persistent severe polyarthritis (predominantly Old World viruses). 4, 12, 31 Occasional cases of eye, heart, gastrointestinal, and neurological complications have been reported. 11, [32] [33] [34] Basically, CHIKV illness severe joint pain in the ankles, fingers, toes, elbow, knees, and wrists. Additionally, the most of the patients fully recover, but in 10% of the cases, joint pain may persist for several for weeks, or months, or years. [35] [36] [37] In 40% of patients were found to still have anti-CHIKV immunoglobulin M (IgM), eighteen months after disease onset. 38, 39 In general, CHIKV attacks fibroblasts, suggesting its involvement with muscles, joints, and skin connective tissues. The high number of nerve endings within the joints and muscle tissues explains the pain associated with CHIKV. 40 Although, physical exercise are recommended to decrease the joint stiffness. 41 In some cases, CHIKV has been associated with encephalitis in patients, leading to the increasingly strong suspicion of CHIKV being neurotropic (predominantly New World viruses). 7, 8, 12, 25, 31 Despite the propagation and the high morbidity rate of CHIKV infections, there is currently no approved vaccine or antiviral treatment available. 4, 5, 36 Although, researchers have recently reported on the development of a new candidate vaccine to protect against CHIKV infection. 42 Basically, treatment has been limited to antipyretics, analgesics, corticosteroids, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to alleviate the symptoms. 4, 37 In addition, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as methotrexate and sulphasalazine can be used in severe cases when NSAIDs are not effective. 30, 43, 44 Moreover, co-infection with Dengue (DENV), CHIKV, and Zika (ZIKV) has been reported in patients 9, 45, 46 Although, co-infection with ZIKV and CHIKV does not appear to increase the severity of the disease or the duration of arthritis. 47 Finally, chronic inflammatory rheumatisms following CHIKV infection are rare but potentially bone damaging. The most number of cases only require symptomatic treatments, mainly non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs and physiotherapy. 36 ",

Translation of viral RNA leads the viral non-structural protein complex, replicating the CHIKV RNA genome. 48 Then, this step is followed by translation of viral structural proteins and assembly of viral components within the cytoplasm. 48 Finally, viral particles bud out through the plasma membrane, forming mature, infectious progeny. 48 There are three genotypes, namely Asian (Asian), Eastern Central South African (ECSA), and West African (WA) strains. 45, 58 Furthermore, the amino acid sequence identity between CHIK and other alphavirus range from 58% to 85% and 42-85% in case of non-structural and structural proteins, respectively. 1",

Inhibition of entry step presents an attractive therapeutic strategy because the damage caused by virulence factors during intracellular viral replication can be minimized. The identification of more CHIKV-specific receptors is crucial to driving future research into CHIKV entry inhibitors. 50 Several previous studies have reported anti-CHIKV activities for some compounds and approved drugs, in vitro. These are chloroquine, 59,60 furin inhibitors, 61 arbidol, 31 mycophenolic acid, 62 picolinate, 63 interferon-a and ribavirin combination (considering that the IFN-a and IFN-b are mainly produced by leucocytes and fibroblasts, and those are associated with CHIKV physiopathology) 35,64-67 and others. Among these, only chloroquine has been tested in vivo, where proved to be poorly active. 27, 61, 68 Additionally, the CHIKV replication can be considered as a great starting point to identify potential targets during the development of novel antiviral compounds. 48 The antiviral mechanism of these agents is validated on the basis of their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, scavenging capacities, immune-stimulatory properties inhibiting viral DNA and RNA synthesis, inhibition of viral entry, etc. 69 On the next pages, all these studies were organized and properly described.

The introduction of two bulky chlorine atoms at positions 2 and 6 (11) led to selective inhibition. The substitution of the ethyl ester at position 2 with a tert-butyl ester resulted in compounds more actives, with EC 50 values ranging from 11 to 27.8 lM. The best compound was 15, which is not only the most potent of this series (EC 50 = 11 lM) but which also is less cytotoxic with selectivity index higher than (2) . Finally, it obviously noted which the presence of an electron-withdrawing group at the para position of the thiophenol ring (14-16, and 19) lead to molecules with an antiviral activity more than that (2) . Derivatives (17) and (18) presented an opposite activity, suggesting that the position and the steric hindrance of the halogen can influence the antiviral activity. Therefore, derivatives with the lowest EC 50 values were converted into their corresponding sulfoxide derivatives. 71 The oxidation of compounds (14), (15) and (16) to sulfoxides (23), (24) and (25) led a decrease in anti-CHIKV activity and cytotoxicity. The replacement of the trifluoromethyl group from para (24) to ortho (27) position resulted in an increased potency and reduced cytotoxicity. Additionally, the similar effect was observed for the simultaneous presence of two chlorine atoms at ortho position (26) .",

Additionally, BGM cell assays using CHIKV pseudoparticles (CHIKVpp) demonstrated which the molecular mechanism of action occurs in the entry and post-entry of the viral particle, probably also associated with other mechanisms. 55 The closest site to Gly82 (site 1) indicates that this small hydrophilic and shallow pocket is probably not the binding site for (2). Site 2 consists of a more hydrophobic and well-defined pocket formed by Trp64, Arg80, Met97, Thr96, and Thr160. Gly82 is not directly involved in site 2 formation but it should be noted that this residue is located in a very flexible loop and it can be speculated that a substitution to Arginine, a significantly bigger residue, could change the loop conformation affecting the overall architecture of the proposed site 2. That way, (2) occupies the binding site inserting the ethyl ester group and the thiophenol deep in the pocket, whereas the dimethylamino moiety and the hydroxyl group are more solvents exposed. 55 ",

Among all compounds, the hit compound (111) was found bind to the central portion of the nsP 2 protease active site (Fig. 9) . In vitro activity of this compound showed inhibition of virus at an EC 50 of 5.0 lM and a selectivity index (SI) of 14, in the inhibition of virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE). 79 Finally, a novel analog (112) (Fig. 9 ) was proposed based on the compound (111) structure. The antiviral activity was slightly improved with (112) displaying an EC 50 of 3.2 lM and a SI of 32. Moreover, the binding poses of both compounds (111 and 112) were found to be similar. 77, 79 Analogously to the active site nsP 2 , the hydrazone group is placed in the region defined by the catalytic dyad, Cys579, and His649, and also close to Trp650. The cyclopropane moiety is positioned in the space formerly occupied by the second Glycine residue of the nsP 3-4 linking peptide. The most relevant interactions observed for (111) are a hydrophobic contact between the 3,4diethoxyphenyl ring and the Trp650 side chain, two hydrogen bonding bonds between the hydrazone function and the amide groups of the Tyr613 and Asn648 skeleton, and another interaction Hydrophobic group between the t-butyl group of (111) and His649. In addition, a substitution of the hydrazone group would be beneficial to overcome possible problems of chemical instability (susceptible to hydrolysis). That way, the compound (112) the cyclopropyl group was replaced by a trans-ethenyl function, which allows maintaining the length and geometry of the original ligand, avoiding the presence of any chiral center in the molecule. The simplified structure of compound (112) allows for a more rapid and efficient optimization of this class of treatment using a more accessible synthetic route, that way the of action of the novel inhibitors related is promising for representing an initial step towards a finding of a clinical candidate for the treatment of CHIKV infections. 79 Sangeetha et al. 35 performed an in silico study using the crystal structures of the CHIKV proteins nsP 2 protease (PDB ID: 3TRK) and non-structural protein-3 (PDB ID: 3GPG) were obtained from Pro-tein Data Bank. The envelope, capsid, and non-structural protein-1 were predicted by in silico modeling, using blast on-line platform. Finally, the results showed the compound (113) interacts with this same protein at Phe118, Val 179, Pro208, Lys181, Ser120, and Glu209 (Fig. 10) , with low-affinity energy (\u00c032.16 kcal mol \u00c01 ). Jadav et al. 72 have employed molecular docking simulation in order to understand the possible mechanism of action of the best rhodanine derivatives (see Table 3 ) in the CHIKV nsP 2 protease (PDB ID: 3TRK). After docking analyses, all interactions observed were summarized in Table 7 .",

In sense, Rashad and Keller 81 have investigated for the first time the identification of possible antagonist for the E 1 and E 2 sites through virtual screening using two success docking scores; FRED docking for fast precise screening using top hits then subjected to a ranking scoring using the AutoDock algorithm. 81 Additionally, both the immature (PDB ID: 3N40) and the mature (PDB ID: 3N42) E 1 -E 2 protein complex structures from CHIKV were included in the study to increase the probability of finding positive and reliable hits. Finally, several molecules have been identified as good in silico Chikungunya virus enveloped proteins inhibitors (Table 9) . Initially, two chemical compounds libraries were used -NCI (265,242 compounds) and Life chemicals protein-protein interactions inhibitors library of 31,143 compounds. In addition, some filters were applied, such as Molecular Weight 500, cLogP 5, hydrogen bond donors (HBD) and acceptor (HBA) (OH and NH 5; N and O 10). 81 Subsequently, molecular docking calculations were performed using previously selected compounds by FRED program. After docking analyses, the poses retrieved were scored and ranked with Gaussian shape function independently by the five available scoring functions (PLP, ChemGauss3, ChemScore, OEChemScore, and ScreenScore). 81 In total, seven sites were detected at E 1 -E 2 protein complex, where the sites 2 and 4 showed interesting in this study. Site 2 represents a surface activity that lies between the E 1 domain II and E 2 b-ribbon that connects E 2 domain A to E 2 domain C. Additionally, it makes close contact with residues from E 1 and E 2 proteins. E 1 residues are Glu50-Val60, Val229-Pro237; the E 2 residues are Ala97-Arg102 (which corresponds to Ala33-Arg38 in the mature form) and Gln300-Arg308 (Gln236-Arg244 in the mature form). In general, valine, alanine, and proline amino acids within this pocket are also able to participate in the hydrophobic interactions. 81 At site 2, the presence of an electron rich system leads in strong non-covalent molecular interactions. Additionally, the heterocyclic ring adjacent to the sulfur in most of the top-ranked poses can accept hydrogen bond and with E 1 Lys52, Ile55, and Thr53. Site 4 can be described as a narrow channel extending just behind the fusion loop and surrounded by both E 2 domains A ",

Based on screening studies, the thieno[3,2-b]pyrrole family presented promising anti-CHIKV activity, and this was used to prepare different active analogs (Table 11) . Initially, the primary screening of the anti-CHIKV activities was measured using a Gaussia luciferasebased gene assay (CHIKV-Gluc). 85 The compounds (142) (175) showed the best selectivity index (SI > 32). Additionally, no direct relationship was observed between the electronegativity of the substituent and the antiviral activity or cytotoxicity. Finally, it was also observed that thieno[3,2-b]pyrroles with similar sub-stituents (183-184 and 186-187) showed poorer activity as compared to their corresponding amides (175 and 177-179) .",

However, all these alternatives are expected to be improved and evidence-based in scientific and clinical studies. Despite several studies involving biological targets and biomolecular approaches, the physiopathologic mechanism remains poorly understood. Additionally, the major problem is the lack of an animal model that can perfectly reproduce the human chronic stage of Chikungunya disease. Finally, Chikungunya virus represents a serious public health problem in the world that can no longer be ignored.

Notably, compound (154) which possess an ester moiety at the 4-position of the piperidine resulted in significant improvement in activity (EC 50 value of 13.1 lM) when compared to the corresponding compound (150). In contrast, the compound (155) (acid) is inactive. The secondary amides, those amides possessing an aryl group (157-159 and 165) were not cytotoxic (CC 50 values > 100 lM) and provided a selectivity index > 8, while those amides with an alkyl group (161-164) show some cytotoxicity (CC 50 values ranging from 18 to 30 lM). Among the amides (161-164), compound (1 6 1) exhibited the best activity (EC 50 value of 7 lM).",
