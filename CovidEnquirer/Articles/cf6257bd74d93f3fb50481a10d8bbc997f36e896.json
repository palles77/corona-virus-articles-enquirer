At our own institution, although the distributions of recordings were not statistically significant (P = .105), a P value approaching significance is a clinically relevant finding. From calculating the number of times nurses reported a value of 20 breaths per minute, it became evident that the nurses erred in reporting values that were not within the 20 \u00b1 2 range. The false negative recording of SIRS criteria can delay early recognition of sepsis.

Although much of the literature has focused on strategies for governmental and regional preparedness, very little information is available regarding the local preparedness of the primary care physician and his or her role in the medical management of such a disaster. Most preparedness planning up until this point has centered on hospital emergency departments (EDs) [1] . A recent report focused on emergency health care providers including emergency medical services, ED nurses, and emergency physicians and their intention to work during an infectious pandemic. In this study, the investigators noted that 80% of respondents would report for work if the infectious agent was unknown; less than half, however, would plan on reporting for work if the infectious agent was identified and known to be transmissible. The addition of treatment for the provider and family would, however, increase the number of providers who would report for work [2] .",

Instead, two thirds of those surveyed preferred to seek help and information from their family physician or the health authorities [1] .

Internists (25%), family practitioners (18%), and pediatricians (14%) comprised a significant proportion of respondents, whereas the category of \"other,\" including radiologists, anesthesiologists, emergency medicine physicians, as well as a myriad of other specialists, comprised an additional 35% of respondents. More than half of those responding had a clinical practice independent of the hospital. Fig. 1 summarizes other characteristics of the responding physicians, including their capacity and willingness to assist in the community during a medical disaster (this survey used the example of an influenza pandemic), as well as their perceived state of preparedness. In the event of a large-scale, high-mortality influenza pandemic (similar to the 1918 pandemic [3, 4] ), only 18% predicted that they would close completely. Thirty-three percent predicted that their clinic would remain open for any patient within the community, whereas 27% said they would remain open for established patients only (Fig. 2) . Answers regarding a small-scale, low-mortality pandemic (similar to the 1957 or 1968 There has been much discussion in the ethics literature on infectious disease outbreaks regarding the physician's \"duty to treat\" in such circumstances [5] [6] [7] . Historical accounts of past epidemics and pandemics reveal the complexity of this issue and the evolving view of the physician's obligations during an infectious disease outbreak. Ethicists describe a peak acceptance of this duty between 1847 and the 1950s and a more recent \"professional retrenchment\" against it over the past 40 years [5] . The results of our survey, however, reveal that most physicians do accept a certain duty to treat during a medical disaster such as the one described in our study. Only 9% of physicians surveyed said they would turn away patients with influenza (ie, answered that they would either close their clinic or remain open only for established patients without influenza-like symptoms) during a smallscale pandemic and 34% would do so during a largescale pandemic.",

With these points in mind, it is interesting to note which requirements for keeping their clinics open ranked most highly among the physicians surveyed: (1) vaccination for self and family (24%); (2) antiviral medications for self and family (22%); and (3) regular delivery of personal protective equipment (20%). Notably, financial reimbursement ranked much lower at only 8%.

Unfortunately, the lack of clarity-such as the vital signs of patients who did or did not receive naloxone-makes this finding nearly meaningless. Considering that methadone intoxication can persist for days, information such as the number of times naloxone was administered, the use of a continuous naloxone infusion, the cumulative dose of naloxone, or the number of patients who were intubated (another highly effective therapy for opioid intoxication) would be highly useful to clinicians. In addition, the authors stated that symptoms, presumably from opioid intoxication, developed within 9 hours, but did not state whether this was 9 hours from ingestion or presentation. Although unable to ascertain the total amount of naloxone needed, LoVecchio et al were capable of determining a mean estimated overdose of 109 mg of methadone. Unfortunately, the authors provide no dosage range. Did any of these overdose cases entail just twice the daily dose? How many of the patients were naive to methadone? Was comprehensive toxicology screening performed to verify that methadone was present and/or that other substances were not? In what percentage of cases was the overdose intentional versus accidental? What percentage were suicide attempts?",
