In this study, the M protein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) was used to biopan a 12-mer phage display random peptide library. Three phages expressing TGEV-M-binding peptides were identified and characterized in more depth. A phage-based immunosorbent assay (phage-ELISA) capable of differentiating TGEV from other coronaviruses was developed using one phage, phTGEV-M7, as antigen. When the phage-ELISA was compared to conventional antibody-based ELISA for detecting infections, phage-ELISA exhibited greater sensitivity. A chemically synthesized, TGEV-M7 peptide (pepTGEV-M7; HALTPIKYIPPG) was evaluated for antiviral activity. Plaque-reduction assays revealed that pepTGEV-M7 was able to prevent TGEV infection in vitro (p < 0.01) following pretreatment of the virus with the peptide. Indirect immunofluorescence and real-time RT-PCR confirmed the inhibitory effects of the peptide. These results indicate that pepTGEV-M7 might be utilized for virus-specific diagnostics and treatment.",

            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) is a highly contagious disease of swine characterized by up to 100% mortality in suckling piglets (Laude et al., 1993) . The clinical symptoms include acute diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration. Pigs of all ages and categories are susceptible. In seronegative herds, TGE can cause devastating economic losses (Saif and Wesley, 1999; Yin et al., 2010) . The virus responsible for TGE (TGEV) has a glycoprotein surface envelope and positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 28.5 kb (Ortego et al., 2002) . The virus consists of four structural proteins: spike (S), small membrane (sM or E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins (Spaan et al., 1988; Saif and Wesley, 1999; Penzes et al., 2001) . The S protein is a large transmembrane surface glycoprotein that induces virus-neutralizing (VN) antibodies (Jim\u00e9nez et al., 1986; Laude et al., 1987; Su\u00f1\u00e9 et al., 1990) ; the N protein, together with genomic RNA, forms the viral nucleocapsid Cavanagh, 1994) ; and the sM protein regulates virion assembly and release (Laude et al., 1990) . The M protein is the most abundant component of the coronavirus particle (Rottier, 1995) . Roughly one-third of the M protein assumes a topology where part of the endo domain constitutes the fourth transmembrane segment, thereby positioning the carboxy terminus on the exterior portion of the virion (Risco et al., 1995; Masters, 2006) . It has been suggested that the M protein induces innate immunity including interferon production (Charley and Laude, 1988; Laude et al., 1992) .",

Phage display yields billions of heterologous fusion peptides that are expressed on the surfaces of filamentous bacteriophage (Scott and Smith, 1990) . Inasmuch as each phage expresses only one fusion peptide, the technology permits high throughput panning of a phage library with the intent of identifying single phage particles with the capacity to bind a target protein. This permits epitope mapping and easy purification at marginal costs. In the current study, three TGEV M-binding phage and the concomitant peptides were identified from a phage display library. Results indicate the ability of these peptides to function as TGEV-specific diagnostic reagents. One peptide was further studied for its potential as an inhibitor of TGEV infectivity.",

Real time RT-PCR was used to quantify TGEV RNA in ST cells and therefore virus infectivity. PCR was performed on the TGEV S-AD gene. 100TCID50 TGEV virus was pre-incubated with 2-fold, serially-diluted (500-31.25 lg/ml) peptide (pepTGEV-M7) then added to ST cells for 48 h. An un-related peptide pepPEDV-S1 at the maximal concentration was used as control. Virus-derived cDNA was amplified and DCt values were measured in triplicate. The relative amplification of TGEV S-AD in TGEV-infected cells was normalized to beta-actin and calculated using 2 \u00c044Ct method. Statistical significance is indicated by '' \u2044 '' (p < 0.01) relative to 0 lg/ml peptide. 3X with rTGEV-M, the phage-ELISA appeared more sensitive. Clearly, targeting the M protein rather than the whole virus could sacrifice sensitivity. Although we demonstrated specificity in phage and peptide binding to rTGEV-M, we have not determined how well-exposed the binding region is to the surface of the virus. As such, using the M protein as the biopanning agent is probably not as effective as using whole virus.
