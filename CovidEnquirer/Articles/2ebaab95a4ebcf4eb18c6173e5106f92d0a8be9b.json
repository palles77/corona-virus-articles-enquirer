The history of coronaviruses is often marked by some successful emergences like the human SARS coronavirus in 2002 (Drosten et al., 2003) .

ECoV was first isolated in North Carolina (USA) from the feces of a diarrheic foal in 1999 (ECoV-NC99) (Guy et al., 2000) . The full-length genome of the ECoV-NC99 strain was then sequenced and published in 2007 (Zhang et al., 2007) . Recently in Japan, ECoV was detected from the feces of adult horses with pyrogenic and enteric disease (ECoV-Tokachi09), and from fecal samples collected in three outbreaks that occurred at Obihiro Racecourse in Hokkaido (Oue et al., 2011 (Oue et al., , 2013 . In October 2012, 4 outbreaks were associated with ECoV in adult horses in 4 different states in the USA (Pusterla et al., 2013) . Of 59 sick horses, 44 were tested for ECoV by PCR and 38 of them (86%) were positive in feces samples. Surprisingly, Veterinary Microbiology 171 (2014) Equine coronavirus (ECoV) is involved mainly in enteric infections. Following the recent description of ECoV in 2000, this study reports for the first time the presence of ECoV in France and, on a wider scale, in Europe. ECoV was molecularly detected from diarrheic and respiratory specimens. Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that European strains are most closely related to the reference North American strain (ECoV-NC99) than the Asian strain (ECoV-Tokachi09).",

Prior to these results, the identification of ECoV in two sequential fecal samples at a 5-week interval contrasts with previously observed persistence of ECoV in horses for only 3-9 days (8). Our findings indicate a viral replication that is intense and persistent, hence the presence of potentially severe clinical forms.",

Indeed, much is to be learned about the circulation of the betacoronavirus A1 group inside coronaviruses, which will, in turn, play an important role in our understanding of the emergence of CoVs. A novel betacoronavirus A1 was discovered very recently in fecal samples from dromedary camels in Dubai (United Arab Emirates) -the dromedary camel coronavirus (DcCoV) UAE-HKU23 -as part of the continuous surveillance conducted to identify the potential animal reservoir of MERS-CoV. The DcCoV has a 126-nt sequence in the RdRp identical to that of equine CoV, but differs from the MERS-CoV also detected in dromedaries (Woo et al., 2014) . Knowledge of ECoVs and closed coronavirus strains will make an important contribution to the comprehension of circulating strains in the world. Epidemiological studies on ECoV infections will contribute to determining the impact and the prevalence of the virus in the equine population.",
