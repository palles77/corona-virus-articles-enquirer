The plant is rich in simple bisphenyl lignans and tricyclic lignans known as cyclolignans. These compounds are responsible for many of the pharmacological activities of extracts of the plants. Some of these activities, namely antiherpes, antioxidant, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory, were known a century ago. Only recently have further studies revealed other crucial activities of the same plant molecules as powerful agents against human immunodeficiency virus, human papillomavirus, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and symptoms of aging. Molecular mechanisms underlying the antiviral and anticancer activities have been elucidated and involve the inhibition of SP1 dependent gene transcription. This review summarizes the recent findings on creosote bush lignans. We introduce the concept of a cocktail of safe well-characterized natural products from the creosote bush that would represent a bridge between oriental herbal medicines and Western drug-based therapies.",

These have resulted in nearly 25% of all prescription medicines, which underscores the vital importance of investigating thoroughly the plant kingdom for potential treatment modalities. Nature is the first, and for millions of people, the only source for medicines. According to reports of the World Health Organization (WHO), 80% of the world population depends on herbal medicine for primary health care. 2 In spite of scientific progress in organic synthesis and biochemistry over the past century, current medicine still relies primarily on drugs isolated from plants, fungi, marine botanicals, molds, etc. to save countless human and animal lives.

Podophyllin is a resinous powder extracted primarily from the rhizomes of American Mayapple (Podophyllum peltatum) and Himalayan Mayapple (Podophyllum hexandrum or emodi). Podophyllotoxin, also known as podofilox, is extracted from the roots and rhizomes of several Podophyllum species. These compounds are powerful antineoplastic agents. 3 Podophyllum-derived compounds, along with other complex lignans, are part of two important classes of lignans known as aryltetralin lignans and arylnaphthalene lignans (Fig. 1) . Current efforts are aimed at using these molecules as templates for drug discovery. Both aryltetralin and arylnaphthalene lignans serve as lead compounds for drug development as they exhibit a plethora of biological activities. 4 Other equally complex lignans have been isolated from the Chinese mock-barberry, Schisandra chinensis (\u4e94\u5473 \u5b50 w\u01d4 w ei z\u01d0). This plant is the source of numerous benzocyclooctadiene lignans that support the uses of the plant extract in traditional oriental medicine. 5 Several classes of lignan are shown in Fig. 1 , where the complexity of the molecules of the other classes sharply contrasts with the structural simplicity of the dibenzylbutane or linear type lignans found in the creosote bush.",

Cov., is a desert shrub also known as gobernadora (meaning lady governor to reflect the shrub's remarkable ability of retaining water by inhibiting, through its roots, the growth of most nearby plants), hediondilla (Spanish for little stinker), and guamis. The creosote bush is a widespread perennial flowering bush thriving in the deserts of the Southwestern USA and south through the New World deserts. Its generic name Larrea honors the Spanish scientist J. A. Hern andez P erez de Larrea, who first described the species. 6, 7 It is believed that the creosote bush originated in South America and spread to North America some millennia ago. In some arid regions of southwestern USA, the plant not only thrives as the most dominant vegetation but has also genetically adapted as evidenced by genotypes that vary according to regions. The plant grows in all desert regions, but only the species that grow in South America and in North America's largest desert (the Chihuahuan) carries two sets of chromosomes in each cell nucleus. In the Sonoran desert, where winters are mild and rains fall during both the summer and winter, the plant has four sets of chromosomes. By contrast, in the Mojave desert, the smallest and driest desert of the USA, where summers are very long and hot, the plant is hexaploid. 7, 8 Whether the chromosomal variations are in response to the climate of the region or correlate with the quantity and diversity of the production of secondary metabolites is unknown. There is considerable pharmacologic interest in these metabolites, which the plant appears to use for defense.",

Other traditional uses of the leaves include treatment of cold virus infections, influenza, diabetes, skin sores, arthritis, sinusitis, gout, anemia, fungal infections, and cancer. Usages of the plant for antimicrobial properties, women's premenstrual symptoms, allergies, autoimmune diseases, and rheumatism are still of common occurrence in several indigenous cultures.

Likewise, the dimethoxy and trimethoxy derivatives are oily and active. These activities were also observed with O-methylated cyclolignans isolated from the same plant extract.

HIV contains three Sp1 motifs, which directly and indirectly interact with the HIV Tat protein to exponentially increase the virus gene transcription and replication. The creosote bush lignans have structural determinants that bind to DNA sequences rich in cytosine/guanine (C/G) boxes and Sp1 is likely to be a primary target for these compounds. The blockade of this sequence by the plant molecules (for instance M4N) prevents Sp1 factors from binding to their cognate site at HIV LTR promoter level. As a result, the virus replication is abrogated. Thus, these lignans are able specifically to inhibit HIV basal gene transcription as well as HIV Tat-regulated gene trans-activation. 21 The sexually transmitted herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) affects~500 million people worldwide. More than 80% of the world population is seropositive for HSV-1 according to WHO's reports. 24 Within 18 hours after infecting the cells, HSV makes three types of genes: the immediate early or a genes, then the intermediate or b genes and finally, the late or g genes. For a successful infection, these genes must be made in that sequential order (a, then b, then g). The a-gene ICP4 plays a pivotal role in this viral cascade and is an attractive therapeutic target, since without its expression, all early genes cannot be transcribed. 25 Herpes virus has no effective vaccine but the infection can be managed by good symptomatic drug treatments, namely nucleoside/nucleotide analogues. More than a dozen drugs are currently on the market or in the pipeline of development for herpes infections. 26 They act as decoys that are inserted in the viral DNA during synthesis and stop the elongation of the viral nucleic acid, thus temporarily suppressing the viral infection. Since these drugs target viral DNA synthesis and the ever-changing viral enzymes, they are prone to drug resistance in the long run. 27 Acyclovir (trade name Zovirax) has been intensively studied and is the gold standard for the treatment of HSV-1 and HSV-2.",

According to a recent report of the WHO, each year 530,000 women develop cervical cancer and about 275,000 (52%) die from the disease. DNA sequencing of HPV genome shows that virus has more than 200 types. To our knowledge, no effective drug treatment of HPV has been reported yet. However, commercially available vaccines against the most virulent HPV types are currently in clinical use. Molecular studies show that all HPV types contain one Sp1 motif in their HPV-16 long control region promoter, which makes them a specific target for the creosote bush lignans. Indeed, Mal-4 has been shown to interfere with HPV type 16 early promoter p97 to suppress HPV replication via interaction with Sp1 transcription factor in p97 promoter. 30 These and other in vitro studies on the anti-HPV activities of the plant lignans are corroborated by conclusive preclinical and clinical studies of terameprocol on the cervix of women for potential use of the drug as a microbicide. 31, 32 In summary, herpes viruses have a wide range of drug treatments but no vaccine. Human papillomavirus has vaccines but no drug treatment. The creosote bush lignans indiscriminately suppress the infections of both viruses. Therefore, the plant lignans inhibit the replication of at least three major sexually transmitted viruses (HIV, HPV, and HSV) by blocking the invariable Sp1 gene transcription cofactor that they share in common. This unique feature makes these plant molecules potential agents in a useful vaginal microbicide to stop sexual exposure to these viruses. It is noteworthy that beside these three viruses, Sp1 motifs are found in the viral gene promoters of a number of other viruses including blindness-causing cytomegalovirus and the potential tumorcausing simian vacuolating virus 40. Other newly emerging viruses may be responsive to these lignans as well.",

One mechanism of drug resistance that has been described is over-expression of the multiple drug resistance gene (ABCB1) encoding a transmembrane glycoprotein (P-glycoprotein). This protein is one of a family of proteins involved in plasma membrane permeability that function as efflux pumps for numerous lipophilic anticancer drugs. 39 The P-gp/MDR1 protein is over-expressed in drug resistant neoplastic cells and its gene promoter is regulated by the Sp1 transcription factor, which is an oncogenic factor. 40 Methylated NDGA derivatives have been shown to induce a reversal of multidrug resistance of breast cancer cells to doxorubin or paclitaxel, key chemiotherapeutic agents of the deadly disease. 33 In summary, the molecular mechanisms underlying the anticancer activities of creosote bush lignans have been shown to involve a dozen cancer pathways, and this number is on the rise as research progresses.

About 90% of all cancers result from risk factors, namely environmental factors and lifestyle. 41 These risk factors are: cigarette smoke, alcoholic beverages, environmental pollutants (pesticides, gasoline exhausts, industrial pollutants), sun UV sunlight, food (fried, grilled, smoked), red meat consumption, cancer-causing infectious agents (HIV, HPV, Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, etc.), stress, obesity, hyperglycemia, lack of physical exercises, etc. The link between these risk factors and cancer promotion is the production of proinflammatory mediators such as cytokines, chemokines, reactive oxygen species, and inflammatory enzymes. 42 It is established that most of these risk factors are also etiological for neurodegenerative disorders and premature ageing of human brain cells. Reactive oxygen species are now directly implicated in a variety of neurological disorders including cerebral ischemia, Alzheimer's disease, acceleration of neuronal senescence, and loss of brain cells. 43 The creosote bush lignans have been known for decades for their strong anti-inflammatory activities. They block the production of these proinflammatory mediators by inhibiting the enzymes responsible for the inflammatory cascades. 44 This partially accounts for the activity of these plant molecules against asthma, type II diabetes, 45 rheumatoid arthritis, vascular diseases, 46 etc., and their remarkable neuroprotective effects were recently described in an excellent review. 14 Increasing data also support the beneficial effects of the plant lignans against Alzheimer's disease and retardation of senescence (aging symptoms), as Miller and his team 47,48 demonstrated on animal models of the disease.",

All these compounds should work synergistically as they compete for various targets inside the cells and viruses. It is our view that for a robust and effective treatment of complex diseases such as cancer, a combination of small organic molecules is required, and these molecules must fulfill three major criteria: (1) they must be relatively safe, sparing normal cells and reversing multidrug resistance phenotype of cancer cells; (2) they must have multi-ligand capability, i.e., each molecule in the cocktail must act on multiple biomolecular targets; and, finally, (3) they must be capable of reversing tumorigenesis by inhibiting oncogenes or restoring the tumor suppressor genes such as the p53 family of tumor suppressor proteins.

This activity was even greater by several hundred-fold in in vivo studies. These results were corroborated by other investigators who demonstrated that organic extracts of the creosote bush exhibited greater activity than individual compounds including NDGA and the cancer drug paclitaxel when tested against breast cancer cell lines (MCF7). 52 These preliminary results lend validity to our view that the Me-1 strategy may lead to a safer and more effective anticancer and antiviral cocktail.

The few vaccines available against some of these viruses need to be updated every year, and never reach the majority of people in developing nations. Antibiotics are designed to reach and stop the replication of bacteria without crippling the vital cellular genetic machinery. By contrast, most viruses have the ability to hijack the cell genetic machinery inside the nucleus in order to replicate. This explains why antibiotics are often ineffective against many viral infections such as the flu, cold virus, and many others. The creosote bush lignans possess the ability to act at the cellular level and permeate the nucleus and the virus envelope to block the viral gene machinery. 21 They are capable of suppressing viruses that contain Sp1 or are rich in C/G boxes in their gene transcriptional machinery such as HSV, varicella zoster virus, blindnesscausing cytomegalovirus, HIV, and HPV.
