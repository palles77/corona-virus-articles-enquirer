Methods: Seventy-one patients with a clinical diagnosis of SARS were studied according to the modified World Health Organization case definition of SARS who were involved in the SARS epidemic between 10 March and 20 June 2003. The clinical diagnosis was confirmed by serological test and/ or molecular analysis. Biochemical markers of bone metabolism were analysed retrospectively using serial clotted blood samples collected from each patient during the course of hospital admission to discharge and subsequent follow-up at out-patient clinic using the arbitrary time periods: (i) Day ,10; (ii) Day 28-44; (iii) Day 51-84; and (iv) Day .90 after the onset of fever. Magnetic resonance imaging of the knee and hip joints were performed post-admission to evaluate the prevalence of osteonecrosis amongst these SARS patients. Various risk factors for the development of osteonecrosis were assessed using receiver operating characteristics curve comparison with appropriate test statistics and Spearman's coefficients of rank correlation with biochemical bone markers. Results: Biochemical markers of bone metabolism showed significant bone resorption as evidenced by a marked increase in serum C-terminal telopeptide concentration (CTx) from Day 28-44 after the onset of fever. With tapering down of corticosteroid dosage, CTx started to return to previous baseline level from Day 51 onwards, while other bone formation markers, serum osteocalcin and bonespecific alkaline phosphatase concentrations (OC and BALP, respectively), started to increase. The latter effect was even more marked after Day .90. Seven patients developed radiological evidence of osteonecrosis. The prevalence of osteonecrosis in this cohort was 9.9%. A total corticosteroid dosage of .1900 mg hydrocortisone, .2000 mg methylprednisolone, .13 340 mg hydrocortisone-equivalent corticosteroid therapy, and .18 days on corticosteroid therapy were found to be significant risk factors for the subsequent development of osteonecrosis. There were also significant positive correlations amongst various biochemical bone markers in this patient cohort. Conclusions: Both bone resorption and formation markers were unable to predict the subsequent development of osteonecrosis. The use of high dose of hydrocortisone or methylprednisolone for an extended duration was shown to be a significant risk factor for osteonecrosis. Its prevalence in this cohort is comparable to those reported in the literature for SARS patients with high-dose corticosteroid therapy. The Day 28-44 increase in the serum CTx coincided with the timing of corticosteroid use. The Day .51 increase in serum OC and BALP coincided with the timing of corticosteroid withdrawal.",

            "text": "Use of massive doses of corticosteroid has been criticised because of its potential adverse effects on various organ systems including the cardiovascular, endocrine, skeletal, and central nervous systems apart from the targeted immunosuppression. High-dose corticosteroid has been used as salvage therapy for refractory adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with the typical dosage ranging from 1-2 mg of methylprednisolone per kg of body weight daily. 1 For a 70 kg patient with ARDS, the amount of corticosteroid received would be equivalent to 350-700 mg of hydrocortisone per day, that is 17-35 times the normal daily production by the adult adrenal glands. High-dose inhaled corticosteroid in prepubertal asthmatic children was associated with compromised bone mineral density that may potentiate the risk of fractures in the future. In patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the role of daily oral corticosteroid therapy in the pathogenesis of osteonecrosis is well recognised. Oral non-bolus corticosteroid therapy for the treatment of SLE was shown to correlate strongly with osteonecrosis. 3 More recently, a 5year prospective study on patients with SLE showed that 14% developed osteonecrosis. Both intravenous pulse corticosteroid and oral prednisolone therapy at a dose of more than 30 mg/day for at least 1 month were risk factors for osteonecrosis. 4 However, it is unclear whether shortterm high-dose methylprednisolone pulse therapy is a risk factor.",

Maintenance corticosteroid using either intravenous hydrocortisone or oral prednisolone was offered to SARS patients who did not respond to conventional anti-viral and antimicrobial agents, while high-dose pulse methylprednisolone was prescribed in addition to maintenance therapy to those who deteriorated clinically. The use of corticosteroid was to withhold or at least to alleviate the alleged cytokine and chemokine storm induced by the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), 6 thereby preventing massive tissue destruction and organ damage. 7 However, the dosage of methylprednisolone used was about 3.5-7.0-fold of those documented in the literature for the salvage therapy of ARDS. 1 While short-term high-dose glucocorticoid therapy is ineffective in ARDS, 8 steroid usage in SARS has also been questioned. 9, 10 In this study, biochemical markers of bone metabolism were used retrospectively to investigate the effect of massive doses of pulse and maintenance corticosteroid therapies on patients with SARS. After discharge from hospital, patients were followed up at the medical outpatient clinic, with magnetic resonance imaging for assessment of knee and hip joints to document any osteonecrotic changes.",

Serum osteocalcin (OC) and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTx) concentrations were measured using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (E170 Modular Analyser; Roche Diagnostics, USA) as bone formation and resorption markers, respectively. The antibody used in the measurement of OC detects only the intact osteocalcin (OC ) and its N-mid fragment (OC ). Another bone formation marker, serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP) concentration, was measured for all patient samples using chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (Access Analyser; Beckman-Coulter, USA).

            "text": "Steroid-induced osteonecrosis, most frequently (.25% of cases) involving only the hips, can impose very significant morbidity and devastating disability. 15 Estimated prevalence in the last decade was 7.6% in 132 renal transplant recipients, 16 and 10% in 69 SLE patients. 17 It may develop in patients who received steroids in very high short-term doses, in long-term doses, or even by intra-articular injection. The interval between corticosteroid administration and the onset of symptoms is rarely less than six months and may be more than three years. 18 In a Korean study, the time for the development of osteonecrosis with steroid therapy was reported to be 1 to 16 months (median 5.3). 19 The median time from admission to MRI examination in our cohort was 6.7 months (range 3.3-9.7) which is comparable with the literature data. The prevalence of steroid-induced osteonecrosis is around 10% for this cohort of SARS patients involved in the earliest outbreak and treated at our hospital. This is also comparable with the prevalence reported in the literature 15, 16 but higher than the overall results of 5% when more SARS patients from other hospitals are included. 20 A plausible explanation could be the more judicious use of ribavirin-corticosteroid combination therapy during the respiratory decompensation stage towards the end of the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong when much clinical experience had been accumulated. At a later stage of the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong, convalescent sera donated from recovered SARS patients were available to serve as another treatment modality; the corticosteroid dose could thereby be lowered accordingly to minimise the risk of osteonecrosis. 21 The subsequent increase in serum concentrations of both bone formation markers (OC and BALP) suggests that the osteoblasts were activated after a temporal delay from the peak bone resorption. Even though the osteoblasts were treated with high-dose corticosteroids, the bone remodelling mechanism was still active. After the initial breakdown of bony substances by osteoclasts, the coupled osteoblasts would be activated and enter into proliferative phase. Although it is impossible to separate the matrix synthesis from mineralisation phase with the current biochemical markers and technology, an enhanced expression of alkaline phosphatase immediately following the proliferative period, and later, an increased expression of osteocalcin and osteopontin at the onset of mineralisation have been hypothesised. 22 Thus, the significant increase in serum BALP from Day 28-44 and OC from Day 51 onwards may suggest that the living osteoblasts were trying to replenish the previous bone loss and the effect of corticosteroids on bone metabolism could be transient and reversible. 23 Serum peak CTx and BALP concentrations were positively associated with each other (r 0.241) but differ in the time sequence (Fig. 1A,C) representing the coupling of bone resorption followed by bone formation in a normal bone remodelling process. 24 As a biochemical marker of bone formation, the amount of osteocalcin release was thought to represent the osteoblastic activity during the bone mineralisation phase 25 of which newly synthesised proteins were being incorporated into bone matrix where osteocalcin functions to bind calcium. 26 The mineralisation process also requires the presence of BALP that is involved in the breakdown of pyrophosphate. Without BALP, pyrophosphate will then inhibit the deposition of calcium and phosphate ions onto these extra-cellular matrices. 18 Therefore, there was no surprise that the serum concentrations of these two biochemical bone markers (OC and BALP) were positively associated with each other (r 0.448) representing the physiological coupling of new bone matrix synthesis and mineralisation phase in a normal bone remodelling process.",

Both bone markers of resorption and formation are unable to predict its subsequent development. Cumulative doses of .2000 mg of methylprednisolone, .1900 mg of hydrocortisone, .13 340 mg of hydrocortisone equivalent, and .18 days on corticosteroid therapy are significant risk predictors for osteonecrosis, while pulse steroid therapy is not. Biochemical bone markers are useful in studying the pathophysiology of bone metabolism in response to massive doses of corticosteroids.",
