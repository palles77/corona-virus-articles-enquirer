Upon environmental alterations, microglia quickly modify their activation state and adjust their range of effects which include phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, modulation of neuronal activity, elimination of synapses, production of neuromodulatory factors that support synaptic plasticity as well as release of cytokines to modulate inflammation in the adult brain (Kettenmann et al., 2011; Li and Barres, 2018; Wake et al., 2011) .",

The influence of muscarinic receptors might be more important for the modulation of \"activated microglia\" than \"resting microglia\" as their expression is largely increased in microglia isolated from stroke and Alzheimer's disease mouse models when compared to microglia isolated from healthy mice (Pannell et al., 2016) . To note, most of these studies were done in vitroand microglia have been shown to respond differently when analyzed in vitro or in vivo (Aguzzi et al., 2013; Bohlen et al., 2017; Yamasaki, 2014) .",

In contrast, chronic activation of this signaling pathway attenuated the increase in brain cytokine production and sickness behavior triggered by low dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injected peripherally.

Application of CNO increased intracellular Ca2+ levels in the presence (Fig. 2C , green traces) and in the absence (Fig. 2D , green traces) of extracellular Ca2+ in hM3Dq-positive microglia cells, indicating mobilization from intracellular Ca2+ stores. Microglia isolated from CX3CR1CreER(+/-) littermate control mice did not show a CNO-induced increase in Ca2+ signaling (Fig. 2C, D; Fig.2E , F, black traces). However, both positive and negative cells responded to ATP and ionomycin or thapsigargin, used as positive controls (Fig. 2C-F) .

By applying voltage ramps (from -100mV to +50mV over 150ms) to test cells, we found that activation of h3MDq by CNO evoked a current appearing only at negative membrane potentials (Figs. 2G and 2H; F(2,36)=7.663, p=0.0017, oneway ANOVA), which has been previously related to SOCCs (Michaelis et al., 2015) .

Previous validation of the CX3CR1CreER-dependent manipulation of gene expression in microglia using the reporter Rosa26-STOP-DsRed mice showed that in the absence of tamoxifen, very few (~0.3%) CX3CR1-positive cells expressed DsRed. In contrast, 5 days after tamoxifen treatment, the majority of CX3CR1positive cells were positive for DsRed. Also, 30 days following tamoxifen treatment, more than 90% of microglia still expressed DsRed (Parkhurst et al., 2013) , whereas less than 2% of CX3CR1positive monocytes in the blood showed the expression due to their rapid turnover. Importantly, because microglia are long-lived (Fuger et al., 2017) , they continue to express the recombined gene (Parkhurst et al., 2013) .

Although these receptors are activated by different ligands, they are all able to elicit Gq pathway activation. Gq proteins are known to mobilize calcium through inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate-regulation of intracellular stores and diacylglycerol-dependent protein kinase C activation (Mizuno and Itoh, 2009 ). Our in vitro experiments showed that CNO was able to elicit an increase in microglial intracellular calcium concentration, only in hM3Dq-positive cells. This increase was seen in both calcium-free media and media containing calcium, indicating that hM3Dq was functional and the source of calcium influx is, at least in part, from intracellular stores. The functionality of hM3Dq and the signaling pathway activated were also confirmed by patch-clamp experiments showing that hM3Dq activation by CNO induced an increase in conductance in microglia that was abolished by the SOCC inhibitor.",

Upon previously encountering an inflammatory stimulus, microglia can adjust their activation state and elicit amplified responses to a secondary inflammatory insult, a phenomenon referred to as microglial pre-conditioning or \"priming\" (Neher and Cunningham, 2019) . Microglia can also develop long-lasting molecular reprograming that suppresses microglial activation upon a secondary insult, a phenotype referred to as \"innate immune memory\" or tolerance (Netea et al., 2016; Netea et al., 2011) . Microglia have recently been shown to display immune training and tolerance in response to repeated daily peripheral stimulation with LPS. One low-dose intraperitoneal injection of LPS led to increased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the brain in response to the second injection. Conversely, upon the fourth daily LPS injection microglia barely responded, showing decreased cytokine levels in the brain, an indication of immune tolerance (Wendeln et al., 2018) . We showed that acute activation of hM3Dq in microglia strongly induced brain TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 mRNA expression, however, this \"proinflammatory\" effect was completely lost after repeated (4 days) hM3Dq activation, suggesting that repeated activation of muscarinic M3 receptors in microglia can result in microglial tolerance.",
