Additional measures were taken to provide proper primers and probes because these components are most vulnerable to variation when assays are adapted from protocols, e.g., because of synthesis errors or poor purifi cation. Primers and probes were synthesized in large reference lots and stored centrally at an oligonucleotide factory.

Lyophilized samples were shipped at ambient temperature to participating laboratories. Each shipment contained a coded panel of 9 CHIKV RNA positive-and 3 CHIKV RNA-negative lyophilized samples with virus concentrations shown in Table 1 . Participants were asked to test the material with any molecular assay routinely used for detecting CHIKV in human plasma or with the preformulated test.

However, for chikungunya fever, commercial fi rms did not rapidly prioritize development of CHIKV test kits. ENIVD attempted to assist implementation of molecular diagnostics on an ad hoc basis by distributing a validated CHIKV RT-PCR and all required reagents. Our profi ciency study showed surprisingly good overall performance of participating laboratories than most of our previous external quality assessments (8, 10) . Analysis of factors identifi ed that this success was primarily due to the preformulated assay. In our earlier external quality assessments on detection of emerging viruses, many participants used diagnostic methods reported in the literature, which did not provide technical features such as real-time PCR (8, 9, 11) . The assay distributed in this study was technically advanced, and its effi cient adaptation was supported by providing quality-controlled oligonucleotides and controls. This in-house assay was readily implemented by a large number of laboratories. It improved diagnostic profi ciency similar to the commercial assay distributed during the SARS epidemic (9) . We showed that novel PCR diagnostics for emerging diseases can be implemented on an international scale. However, enhanced support by reference laboratories through effi cient collaborative networks of laboratories is indispensable. Public health organizations should be encouraged by these data to strengthen and extend networking between diagnostic laboratory facilities.
