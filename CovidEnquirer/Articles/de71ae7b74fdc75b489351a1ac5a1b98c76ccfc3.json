These models were developed with the aid of multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) combined with shuffling cross-validation technique. A shuffling MARS algorithm is utilized to select the most important variables in QSAR modeling and then these variables were used as inputs of ANFIS to predict SARS inhibitory activities of pyridine N-oxide derivatives. A data set of 119 drug-like compounds was coded with over hundred calculated meaningful molecular descriptors. The best descriptors describing the inhibition mechanism were solvation connectivity index, length to breadth ratio, relative negative charge, harmonic oscillator of aromatic index, average molecular weight and total path count. These parameters are among topological, electronic, geometric, constitutional and aromaticity descriptors. The statistical parameters of R 2 and root mean square error (RMSE) are 0.884 and 0.359, respectively. The accuracy and robustness of shuffling MARS-ANFIS model in predicting inhibition behavior of pyridine N-oxide derivatives (pIC 50 ) was illustrated using leave-oneout and leave-multiple-out cross-validation techniques and also by Y-randomization. Comparison of the results of the proposed model with those of GA-PLS-ANFIS shows that the shuffling MARS-ANFIS model is superior and can be considered as a tool for predicting the inhibitory behavior of SARS drug-like molecules.

In this work, over hundred meaningful descriptors were calculated for each compound, which encoded different aspects of the molecular structures. These descriptors were consisted of constitutional, topological, electronic, geometric and empirical descriptors. Pairs of descriptors that were highly correlated (R > 0.90) encoded similar information, and therefore one of them has been eliminated. Descriptors with constant or almost constant values for all molecules were also eliminated. All these molecular descriptors were generated using Dragon3 software [21] . Table 2 shows 15 different combinations of calibration and validation subsets used for the variable selection via shuffling MARS.

Then the molecules were divided into six groups, five groups of them consisted of twenty molecules each and one consisted of nineteen molecules. Each group was selected in such a way that it consisted of all range of inhibitory activity from weak to highly active compounds. In the variable selection procedure, four groups were applied as calibration set and the two remaining subsets were used as validation set for evaluating the selected parameters. The data set was divided into six subgroups, so, we can make 15 MARS models with various calibration and validation sets. Because these calibration and validation sets contain different molecules, various descriptors are expected to be selected by MARS search strategy, in each model. In the calibration procedure, the forward selection and backward deletion algorithm uses the parameter, root mean square of validation set (RMSE v ) as an index for evaluating the selected split points. Statistical parameters obtained for 15 models are shown in Table 2 . The selected descriptors and the frequency of each descriptor in shuffling-MARS models are shown in Fig. 3 . Inspection of this figure shows that parameters of solvation connectivity index (X3sol), length to breadth ratio (L/Bw), relative negative charge (RNCG), harmonic oscillator of aromatic index (HOMA), average molecular weight (AMW) and total path count (TPC) have appeared more frequently (more than 10 runs) in the 15 runs compared to the other descriptors. These six descriptors are among topological, electronic, geometric, constitutional and aromaticity descriptors. The detailed description of these descriptors is given in Reference [23] . The most important selected variables (six variables) using the shuffling MARS algorithm were used as inputs for developing the ANFIS model to predict the value of pIC 50 for the SARS inhibitors.",

Length to breadth ratio is defined as the ratio of the longest (L) to the shortest (B) side of the rectangle that envelopes the molecular structure and at the same time maximizes the L/B ratio.

This is more serious when the data set under study is diverse or the mechanism of the process is complex. The data set considered in this work consisted of drug-like molecules inhibiting SARS and consequently, the mechanism of their action could be complicated. An approach of shuffling MARS-ANFIS was successfully applied for predicting the inhibitor activity of pyridine N-oxide derivatives against SARS. The reasons behind this success could be: (1) the strength of the shuffling MARS as feature selection technique. It is shown that the six parameters of AMW, X3sol, LBw, RNCG, HOMA and TPC chosen by shuffling MARTS affect significantly the inhibition process of the drug-like molecules. (2) The role of ANFIS as mapping model which has the power of prediction of the inhibition behavior. It is a general framework that combines two technologies, namely neural networks and fuzzy systems; by using fuzzy techniques, both numerical and linguistic knowledge can be combined into a fuzzy rule, which require extensive trails and errors for the optimization of their architecture. The shuffling MARS-ANFIS has been testified to be an effective method for variable selection and developing model by using the cross-validation techniques of leave-one-out, leave-multiple-out and also Y-randomization.",
