Although there is a significant variation in codon usage bias among different SARSCoV genes, codon usage bias in SARSCoV is a little slight, which is mainly determined by the base compositions on the third codon position. By comparing synonymous codon usage patterns in different viruses, we observed that synonymous codon usage pattern in these virus genes was virus specific and phylogenetically conserved, but it was not host specific. Phylogenetic analysis based on codon usage pattern suggested that SARSCoV was diverged far from all three known groups of Coronavirus. Compositional constraints could explain most of the variation of synonymous codon usage among these virus genes, while gene function is also correlated to synonymous codon usages to a certain extent. However, translational selection and gene length have no effect on the variations of synonymous codon usage in these virus genes.",

Moreover, mutational pressure rather than translational selection is the most important determinant of the codon bias in some human RNA viruses (Levin and Whittome, 2000; Jenkins et al., 2001; Jenkins and Holmes, 2003) . Furthermore, replicational and transcriptional selection is responsible for the codon usage variation among the genes of Borrelia burgdorferi (McInerney, 1998) . In some other researches, codon usage was also found to be related to gene function (Chiapello et al., 1998; Epstein et al., 2000; Ma et al., 2002) , protein secondary structure (Chiusano et al., 1999 (Chiusano et al., , 2000 Oresic and Shalloway, 1998; Xie and Ding, 1998; Gupta et al., 2000) , cellular location of gene products (Chiapello et al., 1999) and gene length (Coghlan and Wolfe, 2000; Marais and Duret, 2001; Moriyama and Powell, 1998) . Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a respiratory disease that was recently reported in Asia, North America and Europe (Chan-Yeung and Yu, 2003; Drazen, 2003). Although genome sequence of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus (SARSCoV) has been published and many studies have been performed on SARSCoV in recent months (Paul et al., 2003; Qin et al., 2003; Marra et al., 2003; Snijder et al., 2003) , little genomic analysis is available on this virus. Codon usage data of SARSCoV might give some clues to the features of SARSCoV genome and some evolutionary information of this virus. Here, we analyzed the codon usage data of this virus and other viruses in the order Nidovirales. The key evolutionary determinants of codon usage bias in these viruses were also investigated.",

However, there is a marked variation in codon usage pattern among different SARSCoV genes (S.D. = 6.41). Similarly, GC 3S values of each SARSCoV gene also confirm the heterogeneity of synonymous codon usage among different SARSCoV genes, which range from 28.3 to 58.1% with a mean of 37.23 and S.D. of 8.78%.",

Average codon usage bias is higher in RNA polymerase gene group than in envelop gene group (t-test, P-value = 0.031), and it is higher in polymerase gene group than in structural glycoprotein gene group (t-test, P-value = 0.002). But, there is no association between codon usage in structural glycoprotein gene group and envelop protein gene group (t-test, P-value = 0.74). Because the structural glycoprotein and envelop protein are all structural proteins in these viruses and RNA polymerase is a nonstructural protein, it is clear that codon usage in structural genes is significantly diverged from that in nonstructural genes. On the other hand, structural genes are generally highly expressed than nonstructural genes. So, if translational selection was also contributed to codon usage bias in these genes, codon usage bias in structural genes should be higher than in RNA polymerase genes. However, RNA polymerase genes (ENC = 49.25) were found to have greater codon usage bias than structural genes (ENC = 54.60 for envelop gene and ENC = 55.33 for structural glycoprotein). Hence, codon usage bias in these virus genes is not related to gene expression level. Furthermore, we also performed a linear regression analysis on ENC value and gene length of each gene. But, there was no significant correlation between codon usage and gene length in these virus genes (P-value > 0.05). So, gene function, rather than translational selection and gene length, is another factor accounting for codon usage variation among these virus genes.",

            "text": "Our analysis revealed that synonymous codon usage bias in SARSCoV was less biased, which was mainly determined by the base compositions on the third codon position. Comparative analysis of codon usage bias in the order Nidovirales also suggested that codon usage in these viruses was virus specific and mutational bias was the main factor drives the codon usage variation among these viruses. Gene function was also related to codon usage bias in these viruses to some extent. But, translational selection and gene length might have no effect on the codon usage pattern in these viruses. Some published results has shown that the overall extent of codon usage bias in RNA viruses is low and there is little variation in bias between genes (Levin and Whittome, 2000; Jenkins et al., 2001; Jenkins and Holmes, 2003) . Although SARSCoV is a newly detected RNA virus infecting human, the synonymous codon usage pattern in SARSCoV we described here is also in accordance with these published codon usage pattern of human RNA viruses (Jenkins and Holmes, 2003) . Because mutation rates in RNA viruses are much higher than those in DNA viruses (Drake and Holland, 1999) , it is understandable that mutation pressure is the main determinant of codon usage bias in SARSCoV. Our analysis also revealed that there was no host specific codon usage pattern in these viruses. So, host genome might have no obvious effect on the evolution of these viruses.",
