Symptoms of severe encephalomyelitis developed in a 31-year-old man in 1967. He had a high serum antibody titre to mumps virus associated with a polymorphic cell reaction and an increased protein concentration in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). He recovered considerably within a year and was able to resume work. In 1975 his condition deteriorated again; it improved during the following few years, but a further deterioration then occurred. In March, 1981, the complement-fixing antibody titre to mumps virus was 1/32 in the serum and 1/4 in the CSF. In November, 1981, the CSF IgG index was increased and the altered serum/CSF antibody ratio persisted. The specificity of the altered antibody ratio was confirmed by the single radial haemolysis test and an immunoassay specific for mumps virus. Antibodies against the mumps virus envelope glycoprotein, M-protein, and nucleoprotein could be demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and the antibody patterns in serum and CSF were similar. Antibodies against other microorganisms were not detected in the patient's CSF, and mumps antibodies were not found in the CSF specimens of 57 control patients. This case may be an example of a new disease&mdash;chronic mumps virus infection in the central nervous system. We report a patient with chronic encephalomyelitis with a specific increase in intrathecal antibodies to mumps virus.",

Three weeks after the onset of symptoms spastic paresis of the legs, distal weakness of the arms, and vague sensory disturbances in the legs were noted. A positive Babinski sign appeared bilaterally, tendon stretch reflexes were brisk, and abdominal reflexes were absent. In addition nystagmus, intention tremor and dysarthria were present and the patient seemed euphoric. In April his legs were paralysed. An electroencephalogram (EEG), first obtained in April, 1967, was normal, brain scan was also normal. An electroneuromyogram (ENMG) revealed marked denervation in the legs suggesting an anterior-horn lesion similar to that in poliomyelitis. The patient was treated in hospital until October, 1967, and diagnosed as having acute encephalomyelitis. He was rehabilitated, was able to walk in a year, received professional training as a technician, and worked until 1975. His condition deteriorated in 1975 and he had difficulty in walking and some spasticity. After a period of improvement lasting some years his symptoms increased again early in 1980, with positive Babinski sign, ankle clonus, and neuropsychological deficiences. His condition has remained poor and he is unable to work. There has been a further deterioration since 1980. Both EEG and computed tomography were normal in 1981. An ENMG showed a chronic neurogenic lesion without active denervation.",
