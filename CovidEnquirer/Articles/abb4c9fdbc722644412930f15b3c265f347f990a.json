Although clinical competence and facility readiness are paramount in the health system's response to a disaster event, whenever care is provided, it is often subject to scrutiny and sometimes litigation following a disaster, as evidenced by the civil and criminal proceedings concerning the care provided in New Orleans-based health care facilities following hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. Although physician leaders and health care administrators might find it counterintuitive, there underlies a complex web of liability and malpractice concerns unique to the delivery of patient care during and following disasters.",

As patients present to health care facilities, emergency departments (EDs), urgent care centers, or physicians' offices seeking care for disaster-related illness or injury, providers can typically handle a specific number or volume of patients at a certain level of acuity before they become overwhelmed by the numbers or severity of cases that present. This fundamental concept of supply and demand is pertinent to the study of disaster science. Disasters, by nature, are emergencies where the resources needed to respond to or manage an event exceed what is readily available to meet that need. If four moderately injured victims from a car accident present in a hospital ED, most facilities would be able to handle these injuries with the number of physicians, nurses, diagnostic services, operating suites, and inpatient resources that an acute care hospital would routinely possess.",

The concept of altered standards of care is discussed further in this chapter; however, the ethical principle of the allocation of scarce resources is a significant issue that should be considered by hospital emergency planners and ethics committees during mass casualty incidents (MCI). When the needs of multiple patients exceed the clinical or physical resources of the health care facility, and transfer is not an option, how should the hospital address the needs of patients in a manner that allows for the largest number of individuals to survive? This question leads to a discussion of the differences between dayto-day ED triage, where the measurement of priority of care is acuity, compared to disaster triage, where those with injuries or illnesses that are most likely to recover or survive would be treated in lieu of patients whose conditions place them in a high likelihood of mortality.",

If patients come to a hospital with syndromes of illness that progress to respiratory failure or other conditions that require intubation and ventilator therapy, what would be the triage procedure for determining which patients would receive a ventilator versus which patients would not?

However, as with all scarce resource events, there is inevitably a tipping point where demand exceeds availability and physicians will need to provide supportive therapy only to a certain subpopulation of patients, while placing others on ventilators.

This may vary in sophistication from a single intensive care unit (ICU) within a small community hospital to a number of ICUs and intermediate care units in larger tertiary medical centers. Typically, due to the severity and clinical acuity of the patients admitted to these units, the patient-to-staff ratios are kept low, so that changes in status are rapidly identified and patients who require more intensive treatments or procedures are attended to by an appropriate number of nurses, mid-level practitioners, and physicians. During a disaster, act of terrorism, or public health emergency, there may be a larger number of patients who require critical care admission than there are available beds. Medical leadership along with hospital administration and the hospital ethics committee should develop a rapid discharge tool for attending physicians to use in situations where it is prudent to move certain patients to subacute care floors, or discharge them to other facilities in order to create more critical care surge capacity within the facility. A second aspect of critical care surge management is the adjustment of the staff-to-patient ratio. If critical care units possess beds that are unfilled because of staffing levels, these beds should be used or, as space permits, beds could be added and the ratio of nurses and house staff to patients increased. This would require more staff; however, it may allow for a temporary ability to handle more admissions to critical care units during or following disasters.",

Many hospitals write preparedness plans which specify that they would contact other hospitals to obtain necessary medications, or use caches of medical equipment and supplies such as the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS), or even enter into preferred vendor agreements where vendors would maintain an inventory of supplies that are earmarked for a specific hospital. This strategy is helpful for a local or geographically limited event; however, in a regionwide event where all health care facilities need the same types of supplies, a shortage is likely to develop, and hospitals may not be able to keep sufficient stock of medical countermeasures specific to the illness or agent of concern. In this case, if alternative countermeasures are not appropriate or clinically effective, it may be necessary for the physician leadership, pharmacist-in-charge, and the ethics committee to develop an appropriate formulary tool that goes beyond the indications for use promulgated by the health department or the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). This is one reason that The Joint Commission has required facilities to adopt the 96-hour rule of self-sufficiency before relying upon external resources during a disaster. 1",

Furthermore, the very definition of standards of care permits extenuating circumstances and hence requires no further changes. 6 An extrapolation of this argument in legal parlance predicts that any alteration would be detrimental to patient care and that physicians should be awarded no special considerations or immunity even during catastrophic circumstances 7 Altered standards of care can be defined as a substantial change in usual health care operations and the level of care it is possible to deliver, made necessary by a pervasive (e.g., pandemic influenza) or catastrophic (e.g., earthquake, hurricane) disaster. 8 In 2009 The Institute of Medicine proposed guidelines for \"Crisis Standards of Care\" that allow for some deviation from the norm yet encourage evidence-based, legally sound, and ethically commensurate practices. 9 These propositions were formed after extensive analysis of previous disaster responses, assessing their shortcomings and pitfalls and incorporating new research and development in the field. These guidelines also take into account the ever-changing circumstances of a disaster and allow a transition from conventional standards to contingency and crisis care. Thus they provide an operational framework for responders. These guidelines, however sound, have not been universally accepted.",

These discrepancies are magnified during a large-scale catastrophe, and hence MCI triage guidelines are critical to future response scenarios. These criteria would include general considerations, global sorting, lifesaving interventions, and assignment of triage categories. 17 In an effort to standardize and universalize mass casualty triage, an expert committee performed a detailed analysis and review of existing triage systems and proposed the SALT (sort, assess, lifesaving intervention, transport) system. 18 This is one of the most exhaustive and detailed analyses of all existing triage systems in place. After much deliberation, the committee proposed the Model Uniform Core Criteria (MUCC) protocol for mass casualty triage. MUCC include 24 specific criteria that are detailed yet easy to implement, allow greater interoperator consistency, and permit further modifications. Most triage systems, including SALT, currently use 15 of these criteria. Though MUCC was well received in the disaster preparedness community, its formal acceptance and implementation nationwide remains a challenge. As of 2010, only 18 states in the United States had implemented statewide MUCC-compliant mass casualty triage protocols. 19 SALT was conceived so as to make triage easy to understand across jurisdictions, avoid confusion, and improve outcomes. Although it appears effective in principle, further research needs to be undertaken to establish the efficacy of such a system in large-scale disasters. The National Disaster Life Support Foundation (NDLSF) offers training in SALT along with other methodologies for disaster preparedness.",

During an MCI, triage ideally should be under the supervision of a trained physician; however, resources may not always permit this. Along with medical decision making, disaster triage also presents many ethical dilemmas, sometimes counterintuitive to the essence of being a physician. The sickest patients may not always get priority if they are deemed unlikely to benefit from the finite resources available. These people may be considered \"beyond emergency care.\" Such patients should be treated with empathy, dignity, and compassion and may benefit from sedation and analgesia. 20 The concepts of \"expectant\" patients and \"reverse triage\" led to one of the most well-known cases of litigation in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Dr. Anna Pou, a practicing surgeon, and her nursing team were assisting in the evacuation of critical patients from Memorial Medical Center. With no imminent help, resources, or guidance, her team decided to reverse-triage evacuees. Those who were unlikely to survive the process were given palliative care with sedation and analgesia. Although there were no specific guidelines to do so, Dr. Pou exercised her clinical judgment in these cases. Volunteer physicians are routinely asked to make such tough choices and expected to formulate, design, and implement such criteria or algorithms, placing an extra burden on them and their ability to care for patients. 21 In one of its most controversial decisions yet, the Louisiana Attorney General's office decided to pursue criminal charges against Dr. Pou and her team for administering palliative doses of sedatives and analgesics to expectant patients. Dr. Pou was a salaried employee, as were her nurses, and thus not considered a volunteer worker, which disqualified her from the legal shield of the Uniform Emergency Volunteer Health Practitioners Act (UEVHPA). (We discuss UEVHPA and other regulations in more detail below.) As stated previously, no laws exist to shield care providers from willful or negligible acts of malpractice. The case against Dr. Pou was subsequently dropped, although civil cases lingered until they were dismissed later. In response, Dr. Pou championed the cause of better protection for health care volunteers and physicians in the State of Louisiana, 22 including salaried and paid workers participating in disaster care. Though such laws were later implemented and have brought better clarity and improved protection in Louisiana, the rest of the nation still lags behind.",

During the physician shortage in the United States in the 1960s, a movement to create and promote the use of nonphysician health care providers was established. Physician assistant (PA) and nurse practitioner (NP) programs have flourished and today form an integral tool for delivering quality health care, with disaster situations being no exception. The American Academy of Physician Assistants (AAPA) has a detailed position paper that delineates the role of PAs in disasters and large-scale emergencies and addresses issues of scope of practice, reciprocity, licensure, and legal protection. 23 The AAPA position paper states that disaster care begins with effective and competent training and discourages untrained volunteers to participate in response efforts. It also recommends that PAs register in advance with accredited relief agencies such as the Red Cross or Disaster Medical Assistance Teams (DMATs) created as part of the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS). This allows verified and credentialed personnel to be readily deployed in a disaster scenario. Communication with physicians and nurses in the response team is essential as PAs bring their own set of skills and expertise that must be maximally used. Defining their role and expectations is critical, as sometimes PAs may be the most skilled and capable personnel in a response team that includes physicians and nurses. The AAPA also advises its members to familiarize themselves with local, state, and federal laws regarding disaster care and take the initiative to understand the existing legal framework. Such knowledge serves as an important tool in negotiating the risk management landscape.",

The First and Second World Wars actively mobilized and deployed volunteer nurses, predominantly with the Red Cross, mostly women. 24 Nursing became 170 SECTION III Pre-Event Topics an independent service of its own for the Red Cross in 1909. 25 Their experience and learning have shaped the course of modern day emergency nursing. Today nurses form the largest group of the health care workforce. 26 Although training and education of nurses have improved and evolved, disaster preparedness continues to be a critical deficiency. 27 Columbia University developed emergency preparedness core competencies for hospital workers in 2003 that have been widely cited throughout the literature. These deserve review when considering emergency preparedness content for nursing education. 28 NPs were trained as physician extenders primarily to shoulder the burden of primary and preventative care. Their scope of practice continues to broaden as the nation struggles to meet its demands for qualified health care personnel. NPs are likely to also be crucial in disaster preparing and planning. As the physician extender's responsibilities grow in the United States, the NPs' positions in the community allow them to serve as a great medium to transmit awareness and model preparedness. NPs are trained to be exceptional planners, and this role should be maximized within the interdisciplinary emergency preparedness team in all communities. 29 Allied health and mid-level provider volunteers are subject to the same laws and regulations as physician volunteers and are also afforded the similar legal protections. NPs have proven to be highly reliable and efficient workers in such measures. 30 Qualified and competent midlevel providers have been shown to decrease medical liability, 31 although whether this trend extends to disaster situations remains unclear.",

Most states receiving these volunteers (host states) reserve the right to determine the role and capacity of these volunteers and usually 171 CHAPTER 28 Disaster Risk Management do not permit any activity outside their scope of practice. In 2007 NCCUSL approved further amendments to the UEVHPA regarding civil liability protection for volunteer workers, providing more specific language regarding the application of this law. 43 As is the case with all these laws, acts of willful, wanton misconduct or criminal activity are exempt from these scenarios.",

One school of thought proposes that there is no evidence that shows that lack of, or unclear, immunity for physicians hampers volunteer participation in disasters, although some studies find otherwise. 44 An extrapolation of this point of view is that altruistic physicians are rarely deterred in such cases, and shielding volunteer physicians creates a division of those who can be held accountable versus those who cannot. Not all physicians who deliver care during crises are volunteers. Non-volunteer physicians are compensated and remunerated for their services and are held liable for malpractice. Non-volunteers tend to treat patients who are financially sounder, whereas volunteers are likely to treat the indigent and destitute. Giving volunteers immunity would take away any legal recourse for the most indigent and destitute should they receive substandard care. Protecting volunteer physicians has been called \"unwise, unnecessary and unjust.\" 8 These arguments, however, are an overt simplification and idealization of existing laws and procedures. They ignore the fact that volunteer health professionals risk their lives, livelihoods and their own wellbeing in disasters; to ignore the legal ramifications that these volunteers may be faced with or to deny them any protection will ultimately be detrimental to the future of disaster response. 45 ",

EMTALA is a federal law that is regulated under the Center for Medicaid Services (CMS). In brief, it requires all Medicare-participating hospitals with dedicated emergency departments to provide a medical screening exam (MSE) to all those who seek care at their emergency room and determine if an emergency medical condition (EMC) exists. Should an EMC be identified, the hospital is obligated to stabilize the patient and, if deemed necessary, transfer him or her to another hospital that has the means and capacity to provider further care to that patient. 49 In its original format, EMTALA made no provisions for MCIs or disasters, placing the burden of compliance on emergency departments even if overwhelmed with patients. In the wake of 9/11 and multiple flu pandemics, CMS introduced an amendment that would provide waivers for patient transfers during declared disasters in emergency areas; such transfers would not be considered EMTALA violations even if they do not meet the guidelines. 50 No provisions were made for the MSE component of the law.",

Under Section 1135, the Secretary of DHHS is allowed to waive certain Medicare and Medicaid requirements, including EMTALA, during emergencies. These waivers apply to transfer and redirection of patients from the emergency department. 51 These waivers, however, only apply to certain regions that have been declared a disaster region by the U.S. President or the Secretary of DHHS for a finite period of time. Local and state emergencies do not qualify for Section 1135. 52 Such a declaration was made on September 4, 2005 , in response to Hurricane Katrina. The waiver addressed specific issues such as HIPAA, EMTALA, state licensure, and credentialing, among other things. 53 CMS has introduced additional guidelines for hospitals responding beyond surge capacity in a pandemic that do not qualify for federal waivers. It delineates administration of MSEs at alternative health facilities that are hospital controlled and reiterates when and where EMTALA waivers apply. 54 It is customary for CMS to announce additional disaster-specific guidelines for EMTALA through its regional offices during active crises. In the spring of 2009, CMS advised New York City hospitals-particularly those experiencing significant increases in emergency department visits-that they could permissibly send patients seeking a flu screening to a specific area of the hospital without violating EMTALA. 55 Medical Licensing. Licensing and regulation of health care workers are usually the purview of state medical boards or licensing agencies, with no federal involvement. Each medical board has its own unique requirements commensurate with state and local laws that must be satisfied before privileges to practice in health care are granted. In disasters and large-scale emergencies, these processes are too slow and cumbersome to license out-of-state health care professionals. After the 9/11 attacks, North General Hospital received a significant number of patients that overwhelmed the existing providers. A number of volunteer physicians who were not credentialed at the hospital were allowed to provide care under New York State's education law that permits for licensed physicians to provide emergency care. 56 In response to multiple disasters, The Joint Commission formulated guidelines for hospitals regarding credentialing and privileges for a volunteer licensed independent practitioner (LIP) that allows temporary privileges to external practitioners when the hospital's emergency management plan has been activated. 57 These standards have now been adopted by most states, including New York. 58 In contrast to these waivers to state licensing regulations, New York State has also prohibited the use of paramedics in ACSs within the state that are set up during public health emergencies. The rationale is that paramedics are certified, not licensed, and limitations on their certification prohibit them from operating within a fixed health care facility. This has placed a significant burden on local and county health departments, which need staff who can establish intravenous lines and administer intravenous medications during a public health emergency and do not have the numbers of registered nurses to staff these sites appropriately. 59 A potential solution to this is a formal request to the State Commissioner of Health for a waiver during the duration of a declared public health emergency. Although, many state agencies will not issue waivers prospectively, it is likely they would consider them during an actual event.",

Children's Hospital of Philadelphia was faced with a large surge volume of influenza-like illnesses during the H1N1 outbreak in 2009. As the first cases of H1N1 were reported in Philadelphia, an integrated plan involving their outpatient after-hours call program, outpatient clinics, inpatient teams, and EDs was put into place. Routine and preventative visits were cancelled, but many clinics remained open with increased availability for sick visits. Pediatric specialty clinics were at times cancelled, with the space used for ED overflow patients, or saw influenza patients in addition to their normal schedule. These interventions were estimated to decrease ED visits by 11 to 44 per day. 63 Cancellation of Elective Procedures. Just as outpatient services may be suspended or adapted in preparation or response to an event, establishing a protocol to cancel or delay outpatient surgeries is another way to provide staff to enhance surge capacity or to deal with a large number of casualties caused by an event. Clearly in the setting of an MCI like the 2013 Boston Marathon Bombing or the shootings in Aurora, the large number of casualties requiring surgical intervention would take precedence over an elective procedure. For the expected event of Hurricane Sandy, hospitals suspended elective surgeries for 2 days to increase available staff for emergent cases and to assist with surge capacities. 62 In the correct setting, surgeries do not have to be cancelled in anticipation of an event, but plans can be made should the surge capacity hit a critical level. Disaster plans for Children's Hospital of Philadelphia during the H1N1 pandemic called for cancellation of elective procedures only when surge capacity hit a critical level, with reassignment of the staff in that event. While the surge capacity was significant, the threshold to cancel outpatient and elective procedures was never surpassed, thereby avoiding the need to delay and reschedule these procedures. 61 ",

In other cases, such as a low-acuity influenza, it may be appropriate to forego sending labs or giving intravenous (IV) hydration that would be considered if more resources were available. It may also be possible to facilitate a rapid discharge by condensing workups, such as using a single troponin test or a second troponin test 2 hours later to rule out a cardiac event in an apparent low-risk chest pain patient. These rapid discharges free up nursing, ancillary staff, and physicians to focus on evaluating and treating the sickest patients in the surge. Rapid discharge does not come without risk, and it is important to remember to provide patients with appropriate discharge instructions and return precautions. 66 Medical/Surgical Beds and Step-Down. Beyond the ED, inpatient wards will also have to deal with the influx of additional patients. Anticipating the surge associated with Hurricane Sandy, New York hospitals proactively managed their inpatient census, discharging 10% to 25% of patients who were safe to send home at that time. When two large hospitals were forced to close because of flooding, this decreased both the number of transfers necessary and allowed other hospitals to accept more patients. Notably, hospitals had significant difficulties arranging for skilled nursing facilities to accept patients on short notice. 62 Similar steps may be taken if there is no advance warning of a disaster, but it would present additional challenges to rapidly discharge inpatients while accepting surge patients.",

Following the Sarin attacks in Japan in 1995, along with the threat of biological weapon production by multiple foreign governments, the federal government created the national pharmaceutical stockpile program, now the SNS program. These resources are intended to augment local stockpiles within a medical facility. 68, 74 The most readily available component of the SNS is the 12-hour push package. This premade package contains 50 tons of medical supplies, pharmaceutical agents, and equipment designed to begin 10-day regimens for up to 300,000 patients. The contents of this package include oral and IV antibiotics, airway management equipment, resuscitation equipment, analgesics, and other emergency supplies. These packages are stored at secret locations around the country and are designed to arrive at the site of a disaster within 12 hours of request by state government or federal agency. A 5-to 7-person Technical Advisory Response Unit is also deployed to assist local authorities in the implementation of the push pack. 68, 75 In addition to the 12-hour push pack, the government has managed inventory supplies. Instead of a preassembled unit, these supplies are specific to the event and are designed to arrive within 24 to 36 hours of request. The managed inventory may be used to augment push pack supplies. It also contains vaccines, antitoxins, chelating agents, ventilators, and additional antibiotics. In smaller scale disasters that do not warrant a full push pack, managed inventory supplies can be requested alone. 68 Extensive financial investments by the government have been made to generate vaccines and treatments; $4.7 billion has been contributed to the production of cell-based vaccine technology and stockpiling with another $1.4 billion for oseltamivir. 76 Stockpiles of smallpox vaccine are now adequate to vaccinate the entire population of the United States. 77 Additional specific antidotes include the Chempack, which is stored locally in all of the states and contains atropine, pralidoxime, and diazepam. These units are designed to be at the site of an emergency within 1 hour. 78 Obtaining and maintaining stockpiles of pharmaceuticals and medical countermeasures is an expensive and complicated undertaking. A detailed plan to effectively deploy the countermeasures must be established. The H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009 serves as an important reminder. While the public health measures undertaken to decrease the spread of disease are suspected to have been largely successful, the deployment of oseltamivir-an antiviral to treat influenza-met with unexpected challenges. Because of cost-saving and shelf life concerns, the Mexican government invested in a dried oral powder requiring reconstitution, with a plan to ship locally for reconstitution. When the pandemic was identified, officials sent the medication, only to learn that local laboratories did not have the necessary components to reconstitute the medication and the medication would have to be shipped back and reconstituted centrally. This with other factors led to a delay of 11 days before the first doses of oseltamivir could be administered. 79 Food Services. Another critical area of disaster preparation is ensuring an adequate food supply for patients in the setting of limited resources or availability. Loss of water and electricity is the most common problem concerning food services, according to a survey of food service directors, yet the majority of the directors polled were unable to identify alternative water sources or procedures to sanitize the lines if they become contaminated. 80 Hospitals should consider a stockpile of food and water for a minimum of 96 hours, planning for one quart of water per person per day, taking surge capacity into account. In the setting of advance notice of a potential event, consider expanding reserves to a 5-to 7-day supply. Whenever possible, a normal meal schedule should be maintained, though it may be necessary to adapt menus to supplies. Donations may be accepted if necessary. Drinking water should be preserved, and toilets should be flushed only with nonpotable water. Hospital food supplies should be reserved for patients, and physicians or families should plan to bring their own food supplies. Food stockpiles may be rotated for items with limited shelf life to minimize waste. Interfacility transfer agreements should consider transfer of food and water with the patient. Agreements between suppliers can be made in advance to supply hospitals with additional food in these settings. Food and nutritional services employees are critical employees in a disaster, and planning should directly involve the director of food services. 72 ",

ACSs can serve as areas for primary screening and triage or short-term medical treatment, assist in diverting nonacute patients from hospital EDs, and manage non-life-threatening illnesses in a systematic and efficient manner. In addition to diverting patients to an alternative location where limited medical care can be provided, such as influenza-type care (hydration, bronchodilator therapy, antibiotics and antivirals, etc.) patients could be discharged from acute hospitals to this location prior to returning home. This would allow the health system to handle a surge beyond its original capacity, and in a farreaching public health emergency allow for the recovery of the health system. Maintaining consistent standards of care in these settings is essential to a uniform approach to the medical management of a public health emergency.",

This strategy may relieve hospitals of new admissions and allow them to focus on patients in need of either emergency care or more sophisticated (critical) care than could be provided in an ACS. In order to use the limited resources at the ACS to treat the most appropriate patients, it is necessary to adopt a model where patients from the community can receive a medical evaluation at another location, where a determination can be made as to the patient's clinical acuity and where the patient can be most appropriately treated (i.e., home, hospital, or ACS/community-based care center). Public health agencies across the country are working on this model, and states such as New York have adopted statewide models for ACSs to augment the traditional health system during a public health emergency.",

Disaster plans must be field tested frequently, updated and scrutinized regularly, subject to expert review and incorporate lessons from other sources and events. Ideally, these tasks should be undertaken by a disaster committee within a health care facility. Engaging the health care volunteer workforce and local community members and educating them about disaster care and legal protections is highly recommended. Committee members should be well informed about the federal, state, and local laws regarding disasters and be versed in the ethical, legal, and operational challenges associated with health care emergency management.",
