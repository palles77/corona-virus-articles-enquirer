            "text": "This study reports pathological and molecular features in 41 cases of feline restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM). Grossly, there were patchy or diffuse areas of endocardial thickening affecting the left ventricle. The more common patchy endocardial lesions occurred as large trabecular or irregular broad bands of fibrous tissue bridging the left ventricular free wall and ventricular septum. Microscopically, regardless of the gross pattern, the thickened endocardium contained various numbers of stellate, spindle-shaped or elongated mesenchymal cells surrounded by fibrous connective tissue. Immunohistochemical findings were indicative of smooth muscle differentiation in mesenchymal cells. These cells proliferated vigorously and produced alcian blue-positive ground substance and collagen fibres; it was considered that the mesenchymal cells contributed to the formation of the endocardial lesions. In addition, multiple left ventricular 'false tendons' were invariably included within the trabecular or broad fibrous bands, providing a framework for formation of those bands. Evidence of endocarditis or endomyocarditis was lacking in all 41 cases, and no viral genomes were detected in any of the DNA or RNA samples obtained from 14 of the hearts. These observations suggest that any relationship between feline RCM and a virus-induced inflammatory response seems unlikely. A prominent pathological feature of the endomyocardial form of feline RCM is severe and extensive",

A variety of specific pathological processes can cause RCM, including endomyocardial scarring, myocardial fibrosis or infiltrative disorders (Gallo and d'Amati, 2001) . These conditions are divided into two distinct groups in man: those with predominant endocardial involvement (endomyocardial form) and others with predominant myocardial involvement (myocardial form) (Gallo and d'Amati, 2001) . This classification of RCM also appears to be applicable to cats (Ferasin et al., 2003; Fox, 2004) and the endomyocardial type, also known as endomyocardial fibrosis, is the most prevalent form of feline RCM (Bond and Fox, 1984; Kimura et al., 2016) . fibrous thickening of the endocardium and chamber deformity (Fox, 2004) . This process primarily affects the left ventricle (LV) or, rarely, both ventricles. There are two basic morphological patterns of endocardial fibrosis, although a degree of overlap in features may occur (Fox, 2004) . In the first pattern, the LV shows diffuse, marked fibrosis, which appears as an opaque, whiteegrey, firm covering involving substantial portions of the left ventricular cavity. In the second pattern, large trabecular or irregular broad bands are observed bridging the left ventricular free wall and ventricular septum (VS) and often causing fixed stenosis or a fibrotic tube in the mid to apical left ventricular chamber. This is the most common form reported in cats with endomyocardial RCM (Fox, 2004) .",

A total of 327 necropsy examinations were performed on cats with heart disease, and 41 cats were diagnosed as having the endomyocardial form of RCM.

The hallmark gross findings included an enlarged heart with marked left atrial and often right atrial dilation and hypertrophy; severe and extensive endocardial fibrosis, frequently bridging the left ventricular free wall and VS; left ventricular hypertrophy commonly associated with wall and chamber deformity; and mural thrombi in the left atrium (LA) or LV (Fox, 1999 (Fox, , 2004 .",

Primer pairs and Taq-Man probes labelled with the reporter dye FAM at the 5 0 end and fluorescent dye TAMRA at the 3 0 end for FHV, FPLV, FIV and FeLV were designed on the basis of the published sequences (Dieter et al., 1999; V\u20ac ogtlin et al., 2002; Ravi et al., 2005; Andr e et al., 2013) .

The fibrous bands were usually located between the anterior and/or posterior papillary muscles (PMs) and the VS, frequently causing intraventricular partial obstruction and/or chamber deformity at different levels. Less commonly, the left ventricular endocardium showed diffuse and marked fibrosis, which appeared as a whiteegrey, smooth, firm and uniform covering over the inflow and outflow tracts, PMs, mitral valve apparatus and, occasionally, the aortic valves and trunk ('diffuse' pattern; n \u00bc 7) (Fig. 1B) . In this type, extensive fibrosis caused a moderate to marked reduction of left ventricular chamber size. The mitral valve apparatus and PMs were distorted and fused to surrounding structures. Heart weights in the cats with endomyocardial RCM (HW/BW 6.0 AE 1.1 g/kg [mean AE SD]) were greater than those in cats with normal hearts (4.0 AE 0.3 g/kg; Liu and Tilley, 1980) . The LA and its auricular appendage were markedly enlarged, often with apparent wall thickening. Mural thrombi occurred in the LA, left auricle or LV and were found in 29.3% of the affected cats. In addition, distal aortic thromboembolism was observed in 43.9% of cases.",

In lesions showing this pattern, mesenchymal cells derived from pre-existing LVFTs had proliferated vigorously, showing a characteristic concentric circular pattern centering on the LVFTs. These cells produced a large amount of alcian blue-positive ground substance and delicate collagen fibrils (type 1), resulting in fusion of the markedly thickened LVFTs (Fig. 3A) .

In addition, the number of cat hearts with type 1 lesions was much lower than the number with type 2 Feline Restrictive Cardiomyopathy and 3 lesions. Considering the degree of fibrous tissue maturation in each lesion type, it is very likely that the type 1 lesion is an early form of this abnormality, which usually progresses to the more mature type 2 and 3 forms with age. The gradations of the endocardial lesions, the presence of intermediate cases, and the age relationship appear to indicate that the endomyocardial form of feline RCM develops after birth and progresses gradually with age. The fact that no reports appear to have documented the disease in newborn kittens lends further support to this idea.",

In this connection, it is of interest that the subendocardial layer originally contains smooth muscle cells and undifferentiated mesenchymal cells, especially in the left ventricular septal region and the LA (John et al., 2001) . Furthermore, the presence of PDGF and TGF-b was confirmed immunohistochemically. It is well known that these growth factors regulate the proliferation of smooth muscle cells and their synthesis of extracellular matrix, leading to the development of arteriosclerotic intimal lesions (Gotlieb and Silver, 2001) . Therefore, it is considered that the proliferation of pre-existing mesenchymal cells, which are capable of undergoing smooth muscle differentiation, cause or contribute to the formation of endocardial lesions in the endomyocardial form of feline RCM.",

The patchy lesions appeared as single or multiple large trabecular bands or irregular broad bands of fibrous tissue bridging the left ventricular lumen, usually from the anterior and/or posterior PMs to the VS. Histologically, the fibrous bands invariably included multiple LVFTs around which mesenchymal cells proliferated vigorously and produced alcian bluepositive ground substance and delicate collagen fibrils. These observations suggest that LVFTs provide a framework for the formation of fibrous bands, and it is noteworthy that a pathological condition associated with abnormal diffuse networks of LVFTs (referred to as 'excessive moderator bands') has been reported in 21 cats with heart failure (Liu et al., 1982) . The increased numbers of LVFTs most commonly connected the posterior PM or the anterior PM to the VS, showing arrangement patterns similar to those of the trabecular or broad bands observed in the present study. Considering that multiple LVFTs were embedded within the fibrous bands, it is possible that excessive LVFTs are closely related to the occurrence of this type of RCM. Ferasin (2009) believes that 'excessive moderator bands' or 'moderator band cardiomyopathy' are simply lesions associated with endomyocardial RCM. The aetiology of the endomyocardial form of feline RCM remains unresolved; however, it has been suggested that endomyocardial damage followed by reparative fibrosis might be associated with viral or immune-mediated endomyocarditis (Fox, 2004) . Endomyocarditis of undetermined origin has been described as an important disease of cats since the early 1970s (Liu, 1970; Stalis et al., 1995) . In addition, parvoviral genomic material has been isolated from a small number of feline hearts with cardiomyopathy (including RCM) and myocarditis, although cause and effect has not been established (Meurs et al., 2000) . In the present study, histological evidence of endocarditis or endomyocarditis was lacking in all 41 cases. Furthermore, our molecular biological observations using real-time PCR detected no viral genomes in any of the DNA or RNA samples obtained from 14 cat hearts with this abnormality. These findings suggest that any relationship between a virus-induced inflammatory response and the occurrence of feline RCM is unlikely, but do not necessarily rule out this possibility because the present molecular biological study was limited by its small sample size, the localization of viral genomes within the heart and technical factors associated with realtime PCR. On the other hand, it remains to be seen whether an immune-mediated pathway contributes to the pathogenesis of endocardial or endomyocardial inflammation, and further studies will be required in order to address this issue.",

Secondly, from a histological viewpoint, stellate, spindleshaped or elongated mesenchymal cells proliferate vigorously in the endocardium, producing alcian blue-positive ground substance and collagen fibres; these cells are thought to contribute to endocardial lesion formation. Thirdly, from an immunohistochemical viewpoint, the mesenchymal cells embedded within fibrous connective tissue show a tendency for smooth muscle differentiation. Fourthly, in lesions with a patchy pattern, multiple LVFTs are invariably included within large trabecular or irregular broad bands of fibrous tissue, providing a framework for the formation of the fibrous bands. Finally, the lack of any histological evidence of endocarditis or endomyocarditis and the absence of candidate viral genomes in cardiac tissue suggest that the occurrence of feline RCM is not significantly related to a virusinduced inflammatory response.",
