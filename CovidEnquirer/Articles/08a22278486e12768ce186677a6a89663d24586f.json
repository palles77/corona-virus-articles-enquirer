To improve virus detection in mammals, our strategy was to detect and 64 compare featured RNA fragments in plants, invertebrates and mammals using sRNA-seq data.

In our previous study of mitochondrial genomes, we had 77 reported for the first time a 20-nt palindrome small RNA (psRNA) named hsa-tiR-MDL1-20 [10]. The 78 biological functions of hsa-tiR-MDL1-20 had been preliminarily studied in our previous study, while the 79 biological functions of SARS-CoV-cpsR-22 were still unknown. In this study, we compared the features of 80 siRNA duplexes induced by mammal viruses with those induced by plant and invertebrate viruses and found 81 that siRNA duplexes induced by mammal viruses had significantly lower percentages of total sequenced 82 reads and it seemed that they were only produced from a few sites on the virus genomes. One possible 83 reason could be a large proportion of sRNA-seq data is from other small RNA fragments caused by the 84 presence of a number of dsRNA-triggered nonspecific responses such as the type I interferon (IFN) 85 synthesis [11] . Another possible reason could be the missing siRNA duplexes or siRNA fragments functions 86 in cells by interaction with host RNAs or proteins. Based on this idea, we suspected that SARS-CoV-cpsR-87 22 could play a role in SARS-CoV infection or pathogenicity.

In 101 our previous study, six mammal viruses were detected using 36 runs of sRNA-seq data [6] . The detection of 102 siRNA-duplexes by 11 invertebrate and eight mammal viruses was performed using a published program in 103 our previous study [7] . Then, we compared the features of siRNA duplexes induced by invertebrate viruses 104 ( Figure 1A ) with those induced by plant viruses ( Figure 1B) . The results showed that the duplex length was 105 the principal factor to determine the read count in both plants and invertebrates. 21-nt siRNA duplexes were 106 the most abundant duplexes in both plants and invertebrates, followed by 22-nt siRNA duplexes in plants 107 but 20-nt siRNA duplexes in invertebrates. 21-nt siRNA duplexes with 2-nt overhangs were the most 108 abundant 21-nt duplexes in plants, while 21-nt siRNA duplexes with 1-nt overhangs were the most abundant 109 21-nt duplexes in invertebrates but they had a very close read count to that of 21-nt siRNA duplexes with 2-110 nt overhangs. 18-nt, 19-nt, 20-nt and 22-nt siRNA duplexes in invertebrates had much higher percentages of 111 total sequenced reads that those in plants. In addition, 18-nt and 19-nt siRNA duplexes had very close read 112 counts and 20-nt and 22-nt siRNA duplexes had very close read counts in invertebrates. Since siRNA 113 duplexes induced by mammal viruses had significantly lower percentages of total sequenced reads, the 114 comparison of siRNA-duplex features between mammals and invertebrates/or plants could not provide 115 meaningful results using the existing public data with standard sequencing depth. However, as an 116 unexpected result from siRNA-duplex analysis, we discovered cpsRNAs from invertebrate and mammal 117 viruses. 118",

A DNA 137palindromic motif is defined as a nucleic acid sequence which is reverse complimentary to itself, while 138 small RNAs which are reverse complimentary to themselves are defined as cpsRNAs. Accordingly, the 139 typical psRNA should have a sequence which is 100% identical to its reverse sequence, but most psRNAs 140 are heteropalindromic or semipalindromic as hsa-tiR-MDL1-20 reported in our previous study[10]. The 141 psRNA hsa-tiR-MDL1-20 AAAGACACCCCCCACAGUUU (NC_012920: 561-580) contains a 14-nt 142 region (underlined) which reads the same backward as forward and a 3-nt flanking sequence at the 5' end 143 which is reverse complimentary to a 3-nt flanking sequence at the 3' end. With these 3-nt flanking 144 sequences, hsa-tiR-MDL1-20 can form a hairpin as cpsRNAs usually do(Figure 2A). Although SARS-145 CoV-cpsR-22 is also typical, most of cpsRNAs have mismatches or InDels (Insertions/Deletions) in the 146 reverse complimentary matches (Supplementary file 1). one example is a new Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) 147 microRNA precursor (pre-miRNA) with the length of 89 nt reported in our previous study [6]. This pre-148 miRNA sequence contains six mismatches and five insertions and only 87.64% (78/89) of the total 149 nucleotides contributes to reverse complimentary matches. 150 151 Clues to origins of SARS-CoV-cpsR-22 152 The previously unknown SARS virus generated widespread panic in 2002 and 2003 when it caused 774 153 deaths and more than 8000 cases of illness. Scientists immediately suspected that civet cats which were only 154 distantly relatives to house cats may had been SARS-CoV's springboard to human [13]. Later, scientists 155 concluded that civets were not the original source of SARS. Further investigation showed that genetic 156 diversity of coronaviruses in bats increased the possibility of variants crossing the species barrier and 157 causing outbreaks of diseases in human populations [14]. To investigate the origins of SARS-CoV-cpsR-22, 158 we obtained coronavirus genome sequences associated to bats, palm civets, rats and mice, monkeys, dogs, 159 bovines, hedgehogs, giraffes, waterbucks and equines from the NCBI GenBank database. The results of 160 sequence analysis showed that SARS-CoV-cpsR-22 was only located in the orf3b gene encoded by the 161 betacoronavirus genome. Then, we blasted the orf3b gene from human betacoronavirus (bats and palm civets (Supplementary file 2) rather than in other species. SARS-CoV-165 cpsR-22 also had homologous sequences at a 22-nt locus on bat and civet betacoronavirus genomes. All the 166 homologous sequences at the 22-nt locus on civet betacoronavirus genomes were identical to SARS-CoV-167 cpsR-22, while one of four genotypes at the 22-nt locus on bat betacoronavirus genomes was identical to 168 SARS-CoV-cpsR-22 (Figure 2C). Four genotypes at the 22-nt locus on bat betacoronavirus genomes had no, 169 one, two and three mismatchs to SARS-CoV-cpsR-22 and their corresponding orf3b homologous sequences 170 had identities of 96.77%, 96.13%, 87.96% and 85.16%. This suggested that one variant containing SARS-171 CoV-cpsR-22 could originate from betacoronavirus in bats, then be passed to palm civets and finally to 172 human. This was consistent with the results of phylogenetic analysis using the orf3b homologous sequences 173 from bat and civet betacoronavirus genomes (Figure 2D). In the phylogenetic tree, all human and civet 174 betacoronavirus containing SARS-CoV-cpsR-22 was grouped into one clade. The nearest relative of the 175 human and civet clade was the bat betacoronavirus (GenBank: JX993988.1) containing SARS-CoV-cpsR-22 176 and the next nearest relative was the bat betacoronavirus (GenBank: DQ412042.1) containing 22-nt 177 homologous sequence with one mismatch to SARS-CoV-cpsR-22. 178 179 Preliminary studies on biological functions of SARS-CoV-cpsR-22 180 Our previous study showed that the psRNA hsa-tiR-MDL1-20 contained the Transcription Initiation 181 Site (TIS) and the Transcription Termination Site (TTS) of the human mitochondrial H-strand and could 182 involve in mtDNA transcription regulation [10]. This inspired us to speculate that cpsRNAs could have 183 similar biological functions and we investigated SARS-CoV-cpsR-22 using RNA interference (RNAi). 184 Then, SARS-CoV-cpsR-22 and its 16-nt, 18-nt, 19-nt and 20-nt segments were designed as siRNA duplexes 185 and introduced into PC-9 cells by pSIREN-RetroQ plasmid transfection (Materials and Methods). As a 186 result, the 19-nt and 20-nt segment significantly induced cell apoptosis to 2.76 and 1.48 times at 48 hours 187 after their transfection, respectively. Particularly, the 19-nt segment significantly induced cell apoptosis to 188 7.94 (36.04/4.54) times at 72 hours after their transfection (Figure 3). This corresponded to the 19-nt 189 segment being the most abundant among all the segments of SARS-CoV-cpsR-22. Using the 19-nt segment, 190 we also tested cell apoptosis in five other human cell lines and one mouse cell line. The results showed the 191 19-nt segment significantly induced cell apoptosis in the cell lines of A549, MCF-7 and H1299, but not in 192the cell lines of MB231, H520 and L929 (mouse). Since different cell types express specific genes, the 19-nt 193 segment could silence cell-type specific transcripts to induce cell apoptosis through RNAi. These results 194 suggested that the 19-nt segment had significant biological functions and could play a role in SARS",
