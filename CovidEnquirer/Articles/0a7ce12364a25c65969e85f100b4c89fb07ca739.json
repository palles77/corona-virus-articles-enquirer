Kidney transplant candidates are also at risk for infections in the native kidneys and occult abscesses. Liver transplant candidates may have intra-abdominal infections or aspiration pneumonia.

Hospitalized candidates are at risk for catheter-or device-related infections, such as those associated with dialysis access devices or ventricular assist devices (VADs).",

Thus the demand for donor hearts far exceeds the supply. 3 VADs were developed to augment circulation in patients with end-stage heart disease. These devices have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for three purposes: to bridge patients to heart transplantation, to bridge patients to recovery of their native myocardial function, and to provide permanent support for patients who are not deemed to be suitable heart transplant candidates (\"life-time\" or \"destination\" therapy). 4 VADs can support the right or left ventricle or both. They stabilize the patient's condition by increasing cardiac output, improving perfusion to vital organs, and restoring mobility. 5, 6 These devices are typically implanted through a median sternotomy incision and placed in a pre-peritoneal or intra-abdominal pocket.",

            "text": "The major components of a VAD are inflow and outflow cannulae, unidirectional valves, a polyurethane chamber (for pulsatile devices), and a pump or rotor. The device is connected to an external power source through a driveline that exits through the abdominal wall (Fig. 1) . 7, 8 VADs contain biomaterials and, unfortunately, none of these materials are biologically inert. 9 Therefore, events that occur at the host-implant interface can trigger aberrant immune activation. When the patient's blood comes in contact with the foreign VAD surface, T cells can become activated and initiate a defective proliferative response and subsequent activation-induced cell death. As a result, the patient's immune system is impaired and the patient may be more susceptible to infection. 4, 5, 7, 9 Infection is a common complication of VAD therapy. 6 VAD-related infections may delay or prevent transplantation altogether and they are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in lifetime therapy patients. 10 -12 The most recent International Society for Heart and Lung/Mechanical Circulatory Support Device Registry data indicate that infection occurred in 32.5% of the 655 VAD patients enrolled in this database and that patients with VAD infections had a 7.9% mortality rate. 13 Device-related infection rates reported in the literature have ranged between 13% and 80%. 5 Potential infection sites include the surgical site or any component of the VAD (driveline, device pocket, or pump membrane). Driveline infections are the most common; however, more than half of all infections involve several device sites simultaneously. 7 VAD infections may remain localized or become systemic. If the infection spreads to multiple sites, serious complications such as bloodstream infections, bacteremia, sepsis, and endocarditis can ensue. 7 Device-, patient-, and mechanical-related factors can contribute to VAD infections. Device-related factors include the exposure of percutaneous drivelines to pathogens and the VAD cavities and pockets that can harbor pathogens. These microorganisms can cause blood flow through the pump to become turbulent; this in turn enables the pathogens to adhere to the surface of the device. 4 Patient-related risk factors for infection include older age, poor nutritional status, indwelling catheters, prolonged intubation, postoperative bleeding, blood transfusions, multiorgan dysfunction, comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus and obesity, prolonged hospitalization before VAD implantation, and surgical reexploration. 4, 6, 7 Mechanical trauma to the driveline exit site is frequently associated with late-onset (\u03fe30 days after implantation) infections. Driveline trauma occurs when, for example, the controller or battery pack is dropped or when the driveline is snared on an object. These accidents result in shearing or torsion injuries that can lead to infection. 12 Device-related infections can occur at any time; however, the majority develop between 2 weeks and 2 months of implantation. 7 Gram-positive pathogens, particularly Staphylococcus species, cause most infections. 14 These organisms are able to form a protective biofilm that blunts the host immune response and enables them to attach to and grow on inanimate surfaces. 8 Fungal and gram-negative bacilli, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the Enterobacter and Klebsiella species, are other causative agents; these particular pathogens are associated with poorer outcomes. 4, 7 The administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics often leads to the development of fungal infections. 7 The clinical manifestations of VAD-related infections are varied. Presentation may be subtle or acute. If a device-related infection is suspected, the patient must have a thorough evaluation that includes a comprehensive physical examination and extensive work-up including blood cultures with Gram stains. If possible, cultures should be obtained before initiation of antimicrobial therapy. 7 Other sources of infection, such as pneumonia, urinary tract or catheter-related infections, must be investigated appropriately. Additional diagnostic tests are site specific. For example, ultrasound is used to evaluate suspected pump pocket infections; transesophageal echocardiograms are useful in the setting of VAD-related endocarditis. Table 1 lists the typical signs and symptoms of devicerelated infections and potential treatment options.",

Many donors are also screened for nosocomial infections such as methicillinresistant Staphylcoccus aureus or vancomycin-resistant enterocci. Because infection can be transmitted via transfusions, serologic testing is typically performed both before and after a potential donor receives blood products. In addition, family members are questioned about the potential donor's infection risk, including prior infection exposure, history, and immunizations; travel to endemic areas; and risky behaviors such as intravenous drug abuse. Table 3 displays donor organ acceptance and exclusion criteria based on the results of infectious disease screening. The acceptance of organs from donors with known infections with or exposure to HIV, hepatitis, or other viruses remains controversial. 21 Given that the number of transplant candidates on the waiting list far exceeds the number of available organs, strategies to expand the donor pool include accepting donors with certain infections, higher-risk serological profiles, and social histories suggestive of prior exposure to bloodborne infections as well as donors who may be more at risk for transmitting infections (eg, older donors and donors with long ICU stays). 20 Informed consent ",

            "text": "Most posttransplant viral infections are caused by two groups of pathogens: the herpes viruses (CMV, EBV, HSV 1 and 2, and varicella zoster) and the hepatitis viruses. Viral infections are particularly deleterious because they have both direct and indirect effects. The direct effect is the clinical syndrome caused by the virus itself, such as CMV pneumonia or hepatitis. Indirect effects include potential injury to the allograft, rejection, oncogenesis, and the virus's ability to alter the net state of immunosuppression, thereby increasing the patient's susceptibility to other opportunistic infections. The herpes viruses are characterized by latency. This means that once the virus is present, the patient will harbor the viral genome for life. Immunosuppression, particularly augmented immunotherapy in the setting of rejection, can trigger replication of latent herpes viruses. 24 Cytomegalovirus is the most important pathogen that affects transplant recipients. There is a bidirectional relationship between CMV and rejection. CMV can trigger rejection and the inflammatory effects of rejection and rejection therapy can increase CMV viral replication. The allograft is more likely to be affected by a CMV infection than a native organ. Thus, liver transplant recipients with CMV infections are prone to develop vanishing bile duct syndrome, heart transplants recipients are at risk for coronary artery vasculopathy, lung transplant recipients are at risk for bronchiolitis obliterans, and so forth. The most common types of CMV disease are hepatitis, pneumonitis, and gastroenteritis. With regard to CMV serostatus, the risk of developing a posttransplant CMV infection is highest in CMV-seronegative recipients who receive an allograft from a CMV-seropositive donor and lowest in CMV-seronegative recipients who receive an allograft from a CMV-seronegative donor. Recipients who receive potent antirejection therapy such as antithymocyte globulin are also at increased risk for developing a CMV infection. A concurrent critical illness can lead to the reactivation of a latent CMV infection; this is thought to be associated with proinflammatory cytokines and subsequent downregulation of the immune system. Agents used to prevent or treat CMV infection include ganciclovir, valganciclovir, acyclovir, and CMV immune globulin. Foscarnet is often used to treat ganciclovirresistant organisms. Because CMV can be transmitted through blood transfusions, CMV-seronegative transplant candidates and recipients should receive CMV-negative, leukocyte-poor, or filtered blood products. 1, 24 Given that most adults are EBV-seropositive, most posttransplant EBV infections in adults are reactivated from latent pretransplant infections. However, EBV-seronegative recipients can acquire an EBV infection through blood transfusions or community exposure. The incidence of posttransplant EBV infections is highest in multiorgan and intestinal transplant recipients followed, in decreasing order, by kidney-pancreas, lung, heart, liver, and kidney recipients. Intravenous ganciclovir has been used as preemptive therapy for patients at high risk for EBV infections, for example, patients receiving antilymphocyte antibody therapy for rejection. The clinical sequelae of EBV infection range from a relatively mild mononucleosis-like syndrome to posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). Treatment options for mononucleosis include acyclovir. PTLD is a set of syndromes that ranges from a benign, self-limiting polyclonal proliferation of B cells to an aggressive, malignant, monoclonal lymphoma. Risk factors for PTLD include pretransplant EBV-negative serostatus, primary EBV infection, high EBV viral load, CMV serostatus mismatch (recipient is CMV negative and donor is CMV positive), CMV disease, potent rejection treatment, and type of allograft. The incidence of PTLD is highest in intestinal transplant recipients. Treatment options for PTLD range from antiviral agents (acyclovir, ganciclovir) and decreased immunosuppression for the benign polyclonal form to chemotherapy, radiation, resection, and decreased immunosuppression for malignant monoclonal lymphoma.",

Together, these two pathogens account for more than 80% of invasive fungal infections. These infections typically present during the first month posttransplant, 27 but they can occur at any time.

            "text": "Acute mediastinitis can develop after the implantation of mechanical circulatory assist devices or after heart, lung, and heart-lung transplantation. The risk of posttransplant mediastinitis is higher if the patient had a mechanical circulatory assist device or a total artificial heart as a bridge to transplantation. There are preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative risk factors for mediastinitis. Examples of preoperative risk factors include diabetes mellitus, prior sternotomy, renal failure requiring dialysis, prolonged hospitalization before the transplant surgery, and obesity. The risk of developing mediastinitis is more than double in patients with a body mass index greater than 30. Intraoperative risk factors include blood transfusions and prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass, aortic cross-clamp, and operative times. Examples of postoperative risk factors include surgical reexploration, prolonged ICU stay, prolonged mechanical ventilation (\u03fe24 -48 hours), having a tracheostomy, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, poor perioperative and postoperative glucose control, and low posttransplant cardiac output. 31 The major etiologic pathogens associated with mediastinitis include, in decreasing order, gram-positive cocci (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus spp.), gram-negative bacilli (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp., other Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas spp.), and fungi (Candida albicans). 31 The initial clinical manifestations of mediastinitis may be subtle: mild chest pain, and edema or erythema along the sternal incision. 24 The most common presenting symptom is fever; it may be associated with localized infection, erythema, cellulitis, purulent drainage, pleuritic-like pain, and sternal instability. Diagnostic studies include CT scans, cultures, and laboratory tests. Laboratory findings include elevations in the white blood cell count, C reactive protein, and procalcitonin. The latter test is particularly useful in distinguishing between rejection and infection. Once mediastinitis is diagnosed, treatment should be initiated promptly. Therapeutic options include surgical drainage/d\u00e9bridement, wound irrigation, tailored parenteral antimicrobial agents, and nutritional support. 31",

            "text": "In transplant recipients, central nervous system (CNS) infections are among the most deleterious because they can be difficult to diagnose and treat. Diagnosis is often challenging because presenting symptoms, such as mental status changes, seizures, focal neurologic deficits, and headache, may be blunted by immunosuppressive therapy. Moreover, the neurotoxic effects of antibiotics, antiviral agents, and immunosuppressants themselves may make diagnosis even more complicated. 32, 33 The first step in diagnosing a suspected CNS infection is a neuroimaging study to establish the presence, location, potential etiology, and characteristics of any lesion(s). Magnetic resonance imaging studies of the brain or spinal cord or both are typically preferred to CT scans. Neuroimaging studies are useful in determining if the infection is focal or nonfocal and if it involves the meninges. Other diagnostic tests include cerebrospinal fluid analyses, electroencephalograms, viral polymerase chain reaction tests, cultures, and serologic tests. Brain biopsies are rarely done, except in the setting of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease and brain abscesses. The posttransplant interval, patient-specific risk factors, and the timing and evolution of clinical manifestations also help to inform the diagnosis. 32 CNS infections may be caused by fungi, viruses, or bacteria. Fungal infections carry the highest mortality rate-90% or higher-of all pathogens. 32 Most brain abscesses are associated with Aspergillus. These abscesses tend to occur early in the posttransplant period, particularly in recipients who have multiple risk factors for infection such as surgical reexploration, dependence on mechanical ventilation or dialysis, or retransplantation. 33 Unlike meningitis in immunocompetent patients, posttransplant meningitis is typically caused by fungi. In this setting, the patient often develops a systemic infection that subsequently spreads to the CNS. Viral CNS infections may be associated with the reactivation of a latent virus, such as JC virus-induced progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, or they may be caused by a new exposure to a pathogen such as West Nile virus. Other pathogens commonly associated with posttransplant encephalitis include the herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, EBV, and CMV. Bacterial CNS infections are more frequently caused by Listeria and Nocardia rather than more common bacterial pathogens. 32 Due to the severity of CNS infections in transplant recipients, an infectious disease consult, coupled with prompt diagnosis and treatment, is imperative. Empiric, broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents are typically administered until the causative organism is identified. 32",

Fevers of unknown origin are most commonly associated with CMV or EBV viral syndromes. It is important to note that fevers in transplant recipients may also be caused by drug reactions (particularly antilymphocyte therapy), pulmonary emboli, deep vein thrombosis, and rejection. Rejection-induced fever typically occurs in lung transplant recipients. It occurs less commonly in kidney and liver transplant recipients and rarely in heart recipients. 24, 29 ",
