Unlike dogs and cats, rabbits lack footpads; instead, their feet are covered with thick coarse fur that protects the plantar and palmar surfaces of the feet. Because they lack footpads, rabbits should be provided soft padded areas within their enclosures. Rabbits have nonretractable claws, making declawing an inappropriate procedure. Certain breeds of female rabbits have a dewlap, which is analogous to a second chin. Female rabbits may pluck fur from the dewlap during the breeding season to build a nest. Male and female rabbits may have three types of scent glands, including a single chin gland, paired inguinal glands, and paired anal glands. The glands are used to mark the rabbit's territory.",

With the lateral positioning of their eyes and their large corneas, rabbits have an overlapping fi eld of vision of 190 degrees. 3 Although rabbits are visually acute within this region, they cannot visualize items below the horizon, including the area below their nose. Instead, rabbits use their highly sensitive vibrissae and lips as tactile structures to distinguish food items. Rabbits possess good night vision and some color vision. Rabbits have functional third eyelids that partially close with sleep or while under anesthesia. 5 A harderian gland is found at the base of the third eyelid. If this gland prolapses, then it may present as a mass under the third eyelid. Surgical intervention is recommended to replace the gland. Tear drainage from the eyes occurs via the nasolacrimal gland. There is a single lacrimal punctum located in the craniomedial aspect of the lower eyelid. The punctum empties into a cuniculus, leading to a lacrimal sac and continuing to the base of the maxillary incisor. At this point, the duct sharply changes direction, runs along the incisor root, and emerges in the nasal cavity in the ventromedial aspect of the alar fold. 2 Blockage of this duct is common in captive rabbits. Affected animals may have unilateral or bilateral epiphora. Rabbits have a large retrobulbar orbital venous plexus. When an enucleation is performed, this venous plexus must be ligated to minimize hemorrhage.",

Their receptivity periods last approximately 14 to 16 days, followed by 1 to 2 days of nonreceptivity. 2 When females are ready to ovulate, they become restless, rub their chins, and assume a lordosis-like posture. Gestation lasts 31 to 32 days, and litters average 4 to 10 kits. As gestation or pseudopregnancy reaches the last 3 to 4 days, does initiate nesting behavior and line their nests with hair from the hip and dewlap. 3 During this period, does consume less food, which can cause an increased risk for pregnancy toxemia. Parturition usually occurs in the early morning and lasts less than 30 minutes. Kits generally only suckle 1 or 2 times a day and are not usually seen with the doe, especially in the wild.

Due to the positioning and well-developed nature of the cardiac sphincter, rabbits are unable to vomit. 8 Adult rabbits have a gastric pH of 1.5 to 2.2, whereas suckling rabbits have a higher pH of 5.0 to 6.5. The higher gastric pH in neonates is necessary for bacterial colonization of the intestinal tract. This elevated pH also makes suckling rabbits more susceptible to gastrointestinal disease. Dietary absences, especially during weaning, should be gradual, and foods high in sugars and starch should be avoided. Rabbits have a large cecum that acts as an anaerobic fermentation vat. The cecum has a complex and delicate population of microbes. The most common organisms found in the rabbit cecum are the Gram-positive Bacillus spp. In the cecum, fi ber is broken down and separated. Rabbits are highly susceptible to antibiotic-induced enterotoxemia, especially when there is Clostridium spiriforme contamination in the environment. The rabbit's gastrointestinal tract is designed to eliminate fi ber from the gut rapidly, in the form of hard feces, and digest the nonfi ber portion of the diet, creating caecotrophs, which are reingested at a later time. Cecotrophs are covered with a thin mucus, which protects the volatile fatty acids, vitamins, and amino acids from the low pH of the stomach. Cecotrophs differ from feces in that they are soft, moist, usually stuck together, and are eaten directly from the anus. 8 The gastrointestinal transit time in rabbits is approximately 20 hours. Rabbits offered a diet defi cient in fi ber usually have increased gastrointestinal transit times.",

Because rabbits have a welldeveloped muscular system and thin cortical bone, they are subject to vertebral and long bone fractures if restrained incorrectly. Because most skeletal injuries associated with incorrect restraint occur in the lumbar vertebrae, it is important to fi rmly restrain the hindlegs. Rabbits should be handled in a manner similar to cats; place one hand on under the forelimbs, and use the other hand to hold the rear legs against the body. Always place the rabbit onto a nonslip surface to ensure that it has good footing. To restrain the animal, lightly scruff the animal and support its dorsum with the same arm. The opposite arm is used to support the body and rear legs (Figure 14-1). It can be helpful to tuck the head of the rabbit into the crook of one's elbow to decrease the rabbit's vision, which can decrease the stress on the animal. Placing a rabbit in dorsal recumbency evokes an immobility response, which can be helpful during simple procedures. However, this response is performed by prey species under stressful or threatening conditions and may not be welcomed by all rabbits (Figure 14 -2). The immobility response is characterized by a lack of spontaneous movement and a failure to respond to external stimuli. This restraint technique should only be used in those cases where chemical sedation is not desired. 2 A towel or blanket is usually necessary during the physical examination to cover the stainless steel exam table and to minimize slipping or kicking, which can lead to injury. In addition, a towel may be used to wrap the rabbit into a \"bunny burrito\" (Figure 14-3) . The bunny burrito can be used to hold a rabbit for transport or to facilitate the examination of the head. Cat bags can also be used to restrain rabbits. In addition to using these techniques for examination, they can also be used to administer medication, collect blood samples, or perform nail trims.",

To examine the incisors, gently lift the lips for inspection. Be sure buccal surfaces are smooth (no horizontal ridges are present) and proper occlusion is met with mandibular incisors slightly caudal to the maxillary ones. A common noninvasive technique for examining the cheek teeth, which can be performed during every examination, is inserting an otoscope or vaginal speculum gently into the diasterna. Position the instrument caudally to visualize molars and premolars from both buccal and lingual surfaces (Figure 14-4) . This technique does not provide the most thorough examination; however, it is relatively stress-free to the rabbit. If the rabbit is too stressed or uncooperative or a more thorough examination is necessary, lightly sedate the animal with an injectable sedative, or use isofl urane to get a better view. Once sedated, use a mouth speculum, mouth gag, or an endoscope to examine the molars ( Figure 14 -5). The most common locations for molar lesions are on the lingual surface of the mandibular cheek teeth and the buccal aspect of the maxillary teeth. The gingiva surrounding the molars should be at the level of the crowns except for the fi rst mandibular cheek teeth in which the cranial aspect of the crowns will be more exposed. In addition to examining the teeth for overgrowth and malocclusion, it is important to inspect the oral mucosa and tongue for ulcerations and lacerations that may occur as a result of sharp points on teeth. The cheeks and jaws should be palpated for any swellings (e.g., abscesses) and the chin and dewlap examined for signs of drooling or slobbering. Abnormalities may be indicative of dental disease.",

For restraint, a rabbit can be placed into a towel or a cat bag, and the neck gently extended in a manner similar to a cat; however, care should be taken not to extend the head too far. In some female rabbits, a large dewlap can reduce access to the jugular vein. Marginal ear veins can be used to collect blood samples with a 25-or 26-gauge needle. Generally, this site can only be used to collect small blood samples.

Rabbit lymphocytes are similar in appearance to this cell type in other vertebrates and are characterized by a deep blue cytoplasm, acentric nucleus, and high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio. The acute infl ammatory cell in rabbits is the heterophil. Although the function is similar to the neutrophil of other mammals, the staining characteristic of this cell type is different. Monocytes are the largest circulating white blood cell in rabbits and are characterized by diffuse nuclear chromatin, blue cytoplasm, and large, dark red granules in cytoplasm. 9, 11 Eosinophils have large granules and a bilobed or horseshoe-shaped nucleus. Low-grade eosinophilia can be seen with chronic parasitism. Basophils are relatively common in rabbits and can represent up to 30% of the differential in healthy animals. Infections rarely cause elevated white blood cell counts (>15,000 cells/ml) in rabbits; however, several changes may be associated with an acute infection, including a low total number of white blood cells (<5000 cells/ml) with a normal differential or normal cell counts with a shift to heterophilia, thrombocytopenia, and nucleated red blood cells. Other reasons nucleated red blood cells may be found are endothelial changes and regenerative responses.",

P. multocida abscesses can occur anywhere on the body and can be diffi cult to treat. An extensive review of abscess treatment can be found later in this chapter (see Abscesses).",

Myxoma virus is associated with a benign cutaneous fi broma in its natural hosts: Sylvilagus bachmani (wild brush rabbits in the western United States-the Califor-nian type), and S. brasiliensis (the South American type). Both of the myxoma strains can cause lethal disease in the European rabbit. 3, 16 Although rare, this virus has been found to cause high mortality in domestic rabbits from Oregon and California. 19 This virus is transmitted via mosquitoes and fl eas. The clinical signs associated with myxomatosis in natural hosts include swelling of the eyelids, face, head and testes/scrotum, the production of a milky ocular discharge, 1-cm mucoid cutaneous nodules, pyrexia, lethargy, depression, and anorexia. Infected domestic rabbits may become lethargic, pyrexic, anorectic, and develop skin hemorrhages and seizures. 4 Death usually occurs within 14 days of clinical onset. Although the exact mechanism leading to the animal's demise is not well understood, it has been suggested that it is due to the proliferation of Gram-negative bacteria secondary to the immunosuppression caused by the virus. No effective therapy is known, and euthanasia is recommended. 15 Cross-immunity can be achieved using a live, attenuated, Shope fi broma virus vaccine. However, the vaccine does not provide full coverage and is safe only in healthy nonpregnant animals. Boosters should be administered at 6-to 12-month intervals in susceptible animals. 15 Shope fi broma virus is a Leporipoxvirus and is related to the myxoma virus.

Outbreaks have been reported in rabbitries. Clinical signs include subcutaneous, nonattached, wart-like fi bromas on the legs or feet and around the muzzle and eyes.

Eimeria spp. can infect both the intestinal tract and the liver (E. steidae). The transmission of these protozoal parasites is via the fecaloral route. Sporulated oocysts represent the infectious stage. Clinical signs associated with intestinal coccidiosis include inappetence, weight loss, dehydration, diarrhea (\u00b1 hemorrhagic), and, in chronic cases, intussusception. Hepatic coccidiosis is considered a more serious disease. Rabbits infected with hepatic coccidiosis may have limited growth, diarrhea, weight loss, dehydration, ascites, hepatomegaly, icterus, and hepatic encephalopathy. Severe cases can result in death. A fecal fl otation and direct smear or histopathology can be useful to confi rm a diagnosis. Treatment may be accomplished using trimethoprim sulfadiazine (30 mg/kg PS or SC BID \u00d7 7-10 days), sulfadimethoxine (50 mg/kg PO once, then 25 mg/kg SID \u00d7 21 days), or sulfaquinoxaline (0.025% in feed or pellets). 14 Extended treatments may be required for some populations. If routine treatment is practiced, then the anticoccidial drugs should be rotated to minimize the likelihood of inducing resistance.",

E. cuniculi is shed transiently and can live for 4 weeks at room temperature. Clinical signs can vary depending upon the organ or system affected and the severity and duration of the disease. This protozoan affects primarily the kidneys, eyes, and neuro-logic system. Most infected rabbits present for vestibular disease. Clinical signs may include head tilt, hemiparesis, an inability to right itself, tumbling/rolling, seizures, ataxia, and paralysis ( Figure 14-10) . When E. cuniculi affects the neurologic system, the prognosis for recovery is grave. In some cases, rabbits show a reduction in vestibular signs but require lifelong treatment. Without treatment, the quality of life is usually poor, and euthanasia is recommended. When the kidneys are affected, clinical signs may be absent because renal function is not usually altered. Cataracts and uveitis are common sequelae to ocular infections (Figure 14-11) . Phacoemulsifi cation is the treatment of choice for E. cuniculi-induced cataracts. Without treatment, the lens can rupture and induce a phacoelastic uveitis. Diagnosing E. cuniculi antemortem is usually done from the physical examination, hematology, and serology. Serology is generally only used to rule out E. cuniculi infection; however, a positive titer does not conclusively rule in disease. Albendazole, fenbendazole, or oxibendazole is generally used to minimize the infl ammatory response associated with the infection. 4 Antibiotics that penetrate the blood-brain barrier (e.g., chloramphenicol) can be used to combat opportunistic infections. Diazepam can be used to control seizures. Although some corticosteroids have been used for treating E. cuniculi, they can cause immunosuppression and should be used with caution. The steroid's primary benefi t is to increase the uptake of the respective antiparasitics. Life-long treatment is required to minimize the clinical signs associated with the disease. 23 Baylisascaris procyonis, the raccoon roundworm, has been documented in rabbits and can be associated with fatal neurologic disease. Affected animals may present for torticollis, ataxia, and tremors. 24 Rabbits become infected from eating food or drinking water contaminated with raccoon feces. A diagnosis can be made from a serologic titer (exposure) or postmortem. Albendazole can be used to minimize the clinical disease associated with the parasites.",

Stress, barbering, and nest building have also been associated with the formation of trichobezoars. Anorexia, lethargy, diarrhea, small dry feces or an absence of feces, hair loss, and a palpable fi rm mass in the cranial abdomen are common fi ndings in affected rabbits. A thorough history, physical examination, and survey radiographs (\u00b1 contrast) are generally required to make a diagnosis. Endoscopy can be used to confi rm a diagnosis. A history of anorexia in combination with a soft tissue density in the stomach is highly suggestive of gastric trichobezoars (Figure 14-13) . Positive or negative contrast radiography can be used to help outline a trichobezoar. In most cases, medically managing a trichobezoar yields a higher treatment success than does surgery. However, there are cases where surgical intervention is the only method that can be used to treat a trichobezoar. Treatment should focus on rehydrating the gastric contents through fl uid administration and providing motility stimulants, analgesics, antibiotics, and nutritional support. Fresh greens and hay should be offered to animals that are still eating. Rabbits that are anorectic should be force-fed a critical care diet (Oxbow Pet Products, Murdock, NE) to prevent hepatic lipidosis. Fresh pineapple juice contains the enzyme bromelain, and this enzyme is thought to have ceratolytic properties (5-10 ml BID). 7 Papaya and prozyme may also be used to assist in the digestion of the trichobezoar. Metoclopramide or cisapride can be used to stimulate gastric motility; however, this should not be used if impaction is suspected. A broad-spectrum antibiotic, such as enrofl oxacin or trimethoprim sulfa, is generally used to limit the overgrowth of bacterial pathogens. Analgesics, such as buprenorphine, fl unixin meglumine, metacam, or carprofen, can be used to minimize the pain associated with the alterations in gastrointestinal motility. Without treatment, trichobezoars can lead to mal nutrition and death or gastric rupture causing fatal peritonitis. 26 If the ingested material is synthetic (e.g., carpeting), surgery is usually required. The prognosis for cases going to surgery is generally considered guarded to grave; however, if the animal is stabilized before the procedure, then the likelihood for success is higher.",

It is often possible to palpate an enlarged uterus in rabbits with uterine adenocarcinoma. The neoplastic organ will palpate as a tubular structure in the caudoventral abdomen. An increased soft tissue density in the same area may be seen radiographically. Thoracic radiographs should be taken to assess the patient for metastasis. If metastasis to the lungs has occurred, then the prognosis is grave. If metastasis has not occurred, then an ovariohysterectomy is recommended. During the surgical procedure, the abdomen should be inspected for localized metastasis. Any suspect tissues should be biopsied. 4 Mammary adenocarcinoma is another common neoplasia of adult (>3-4 years of age) rabbits. 4 These cases should be managed using the diagnostic plan described for uterine adenocarcinomas. Removing the affected mammary gland (local or radical) and the reproductive tract provides the best prognosis. Metastasis can be found in regional lymph nodes, lungs, or other organs. The incidence of mammary adenocarcinoma can be reduced signifi cantly by performing ovariohysterectomies in rabbits before they are sexually mature. Some clinicians use different chemotherapeutics as adjunctive therapy to surgical treatment. Tamoxifen is a nonsteroidal, antiestrogen drug with antitumor effects that works by binding estrogen receptors. 28 The overall value of this drug in rabbits is unknown for spayed animals. However, clinicians using the protocol believe, subjectively, that survival is extended. If tamoxifen is used, the patient should be routinely monitored for changes in behavior, tumor size, and liver or CBC changes.",

Urinary neoplasia rarely occurs; however, nephroma, lymphosarcoma, renal carcinoma, and urinary bladder leiomyoma have been reported. Primary neoplasia of the lungs is very rare. Carcinomas have been found to be associated with the nasal turbinates, causing an unresponsive nasal discharge. Thymomas have been reported in both juvenile and adult rabbits. Affected animals often present with tachypnea, dyspnea, and, occasionally, bilateral exophthalmos resulting from the interference of the blood fl ow to the heart. A thymomectomy can be performed via a median sternotomy. 4 Metastasis to the lungs is a common sequela for many different malignant neoplasias. Both teratoma and neurinoma affect the central nervous system of rabbits. Neoplastic conditions found to affect the digestive tract include adenocarcinoma, leiomyosarcoma, papilloma, and metastatic uterine adenocarcinoma. Surgical resection is the treatment of choice for those conditions. Bile duct carcinoma has been reported in rabbits; however, in these cases, surgery is not an option and metastatic disease carries a grave prognosis. Cutaneous neoplasias that have been reported in rabbits include the following: cutaneous lymphosarcoma, nonviral papilloma, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and sebaceous gland carcinoma. Malignant melanoma has been associated with ocular, abdominal, thoracic, and vertebral disease. 31 Miscellaneous Diseases DERMATOLOGY Many different diseases or conditions, such as obesity, sore hocks, arthritis, poor diet, dental disease, urinary disease, and neurologic disease, can lead to secondary dermatitis. Moist dermatitis around the oral cavity is a common sequela to dental disease. Discomfort caused by tooth malocclusion can lead to drooling, and the chronic wetness associated with the drooling predisposes the animal to bacterial dermatitis. Skin fold pyoderma is a common problem in obese animals; the sites most commonly affected are the dewlap, perianal, and genital areas. Treatment for those conditions requires aggressive wound debridement. Fur from the affected area should be clipped to provide adequate exposure. The wound should be cleaned with a topical disinfectant (e.g., Betadine or chlorhexidine). To control bacterial infections, we recommend using a hyperosmotic solution (e.g., 50% dextrose). The wound should be liberally irrigated with the 50% dextrose solution. After 1 to 2 minutes, the wound should be irrigated with isotonic saline to remove the dextrose. Extended contact with the dextrose can dry out the healing tissue. The procedure should be repeated at least three times, twice daily. In addition to this topical treatment, obese animals should be placed on a calorierestrictive diet. This is best achieved by reducing the amount of pellets and providing (ad libitum) grass hay (e.g., timothy hay). Surgery may be required to remove excess skin folds. In cases of tooth malocclusion, the primary problem should be identifi ed and corrected.",

            "text": "Dermal abscesses are a common presentation in rabbits and can occur anywhere on the body. Abscesses in rabbits are generally more caseous in nature than in other mammals. The thick, caseous nature of rabbit abscesses limits their drainage, and the use of standard Penrose drains is usually futile. Treating abscesses with (only) systemic antibiotics is ineffective, as the nucleus of the abscess in unaffected by the treatment. To effectively treat rabbit abscesses, the entire abscess (including the capsule) must be removed. In cases where the abscess and capsule are removed, the prognosis is good; however, in most cases the capsule is inherently attached to vital organs or bone and is diffi cult to remove. When it is impossible to extract the entire capsule, as much of the capsule should be removed as possible to avoid contact between caseous material and unaffected tissue. Culture and antibiotic sensitivity testing of the purulent material or capsule is recommended. Abscesses that cannot be completely removed should be left open for daily cleansing and debridement. When choosing a topical antibiotic therapy, be sure to select antibiotics that will not induce bacterial dysbiosis when the rabbit grooms itself. Penicillin (80,000 IU/kg) or ampicillin (20 mg/kg), although not to be given orally because of the potential for dysbiosis, can be used parenterally to treat local skin abscesses. In our experience, the application of honey to the abscess as a hyperosmotic has produced moderate success. The honey, in addition to acting as an antimicrobial, encourages a rabbit to groom or lick at the area and promotes drainage. 2 The honey also acidifi es the area and promotes healing. Systemic oral antimicrobials and analgesics should also be considered when treating rabbit abscesses. 29 Antibiotic-impregnated polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) beads can also be used to manage rabbit abscesses. Heat-stable antibiotics must be used to make PMMA beads. Amikacin 1.25 g/20 g methylmethacrylate, cefazolin 2 g/20 g methylmethacrylate, cephalothin 2 g/20 g methylmethacrylate, gentamicin 1 g/20 g methylmethacrylate, or tobramycin 1 g/20 g methylmethacrylate are all appropriate for PMMA beads. 30 Treating abscesses in rabbits can be frustrating and may require multiple procedures. In some cases, treatment is not successful, and amputation may be the only option. Owners should always be made aware of their pet's prognosis before treatment is initiated. Systemic antibiotics are appropriate for generalized abscesses. Antimicrobial treatment is ideally based on culture and antibiotic sensitivity testing. While testing is pending, abscesses can be treated with benzathine/penicillin G procaine (40,000 IU/kg SC SID \u00d7 14 days, then q48h \u00d7 2 weeks); enrofl oxacin (5 mg/kg PO BID); or metronidazole (30 mg/kg PO BID). 30, 35 The use of trime-thoprim sulfa-dimethoxine should be avoided when there is caseous material present because the antibiotic is inactivated by pus.",

This is a painful, progressive disease that can be diffi cult to treat. Predisposing factors for this disease include breed (e.g., Rex), housing (e.g., metal grate fl ooring, concrete, carpet), lack of exercise, and obesity. Rabbits housed on an inappropriate fl ooring surface alter their weight distribution and bear the brunt of their weight on their metatarsus and hock instead of on the claws and plantar surface of the feet. 2 This shift in weight leads to the medical displacement of the superfi cial fl exor tendon, which can exacerbate the condition. 2 Treatment is aimed at relieving the pressure on the affected area. A nonabrasive, dry surface should be provided. Providing an affected animal time during the day on a grass lawn or deep bed of hay is helpful. A thick foam rubber pad, towels, or newspaper substrate can also be used to minimize the likelihood of exacerbating this disease. Skin wounds can be managed using the technique described previously. Surgical skin glue can be used to protect the wounds. A padded splint can be used to alleviate any pressure on the lesions. Opportunistic infection should be managed with appropriate antibiotics. Analgesics (e.g., nonsteroidal antiinfl ammatories, opioids) should be used to alleviate discomfort. Underlying problems, such as obesity and inappropriate substrate, should be corrected.

Otitis externa is a common problem, and it is most often associated with a parasitic or bacterial predisposition. Parasitic infections were described previously (see Parasitic Disease). 32 Lop breeds are predisposed to developing bacterial otitis because of the fl exion of the cartilage at the base of their ears. Rabbits with otitis externa may present for shaking, pruritus, erythematous pinna, malodor, and possible auricular discharge. Because otitis externa can be painful, care should be taken when manipulating the ears; we prefer to treat affected rabbits with systemic antibiotics and antiinfl ammatories rather than treating the ears topically. Bacterial cultures should be collected before treatment. Otitis externa can advance to otitis media or otitis interna. Otitis interna should be ruled out in rabbits with a head tilt. Radiographs and/or CT scans can be used to assess the tympanic bullae. In severe otitis cases, a permanent osteotomy may be required. 32 The most common causes of conjunctivitis in rabbits are bacterial infections (e.g., Pasteurella), trauma, and entropion. When evaluating rabbit eyes, the approach to the examination should be similar to that for other mammals. Unless trauma has been acknowledged in the history, a thorough work-up should be pursued, including a cytologic scraping and bacterial culture. For confi rmed bacterial infections, topical antibiotics can be used. Treatment regimens may require three to four doses daily. Application of topical antibiotics three to four times a day in addition to removing the initial cause of conjunctivitis is recommended. Entropion is a common presentation in large breed and obese rabbits, and surgical resection is necessary for resolution. 21 Epiphora can be associated with early signs of dental disease, causing the blockage of the nasolacrimal ducts, or it can occur secondarily to conjunctivitis or rhinitis. Any rabbit presenting with dacryocystitis, conjunctivitis, or epiphora should receive a thorough ophthalmic examination, in addition to skull radiographs, to evaluate the roots of the teeth. Because many cases of epiphora are the direct result of blocked or infl amed lacrimal ducts, the lacrimal punctum should be fl ushed with sterile saline to facilitate the removal of debris (Figure 14-17) . The ducts can be fl ushed with antibiotics too if a bacterial infection is suspected.",

Early in the disease course, the parasite causes segmental, granulomatous, interstitial nephritis, which can be seen as irregular depressions on the surface of the kidneys. However, interstitial fi brosis can occur late in the disease. Many times these changes do not cause a reduction in kidney function. (For more information about E. cuniculi, see Parasitic Disease.) \"Red urine\" is a common problem in rabbits. In these cases, veterinarians must determine whether a sample is red because of the presence of blood or porphyrin pigment. Blood indicates a breakdown in the epithelial barrier and is common with cystitis, uroliths, and neoplasia. The presence of porphyrin pigment is associated most with stress, dietary changes, or both. A thorough history will often provide insight into whether a recent stress event or dietary change occurred. A urinalysis should be done to determine if a color change in the urine is based on blood or pigment. The presence of red blood cells is diagnostic.

Clinical signs can vary, but generally include diffi culty with prehension of food, anorexia, cachexia, dacryocystitis, abnormal facial swelling, and excessive salivation. Incisor malocclusion has been attributed to congenital factors, such as mandibular prognathism, and is seen at an increased rate in rabbits less than 1.5 kg or certain breeds (e.g., Netherland dwarf rabbits). 2 Animals that suffer traumatic injuries to the jaws are also more susceptible to developing tooth malocclusion. Abnormal incisor growth can lead to the blockage of the nasolacrimal duct, resulting in epiphora. Incisor malocclusion can also lead to molar malocclusion, causing further dental complications. Trimming incisors is the primary method for correcting malocclusion, and this can be done using a highspeed Dremel tool (Dremel, Racine, WI) or dental drill ( Figure  14-19) . Incisors grow at a rate of 3 mm per week when the opposing incisor is present and 1 mm per day when there is no tooth opposition. Therefore, trimming should be done at approximately 3-week intervals when there is a malocclusion or no opposing incisor. Toenail clippers have been recommended for trimming incisors; we do not recommend this, as toenail clippers have been associated with tooth fracture. Where there is severe malocclusion, complete incisor extraction is recommended. This is a relatively easy procedure; however, it does require patience. Aggressive, rough manipulation of the teeth can lead to tooth fracture and, again, pain and discomfort. (This procedure is discussed in detail in Surgery.)

Maxillary cheek teeth and all but the fi rst mandibular cheek teeth can be reduced to the level of the gingiva; however, this is not always necessary. In some cases, removing the points is suffi cient. The gingiva naturally exposes the cranial aspect of the fi rst mandibular cheek tooth. Ideally, when trimming or fl oating the cheek teeth, the procedure should be done with power equipment (e.g., fl at fi ssure bur) to ensure rapid tooth removal without damaging the surrounding tissue. The use of rasps or clippers can create friction and rock the teeth, causing periapical and periodontal damage. For this reason, these tools are not recommended or should be used with extreme caution. Extraction of the cheek teeth is much more complicated than removal of the incisor and more traumatic to the rabbit. (Crossley DA, personal communication) When several extractions are required, it is best to perform multiple procedures to minimize the pain and discomfort to the animal.

If the animals is mildly dehydrated and has a functional gastrointestinal tract (e.g., no diarrhea), then fl uids should be provided PO. This represents the natural route of fl uid administration. For mildly dehydrated animals that will not tolerate PO fl uids or have diarrhea, SC fl uids are recommended. SC fl uids can be administered on the dorsum between the scapulae or over the lateral body wall. Animals that are moderately to severely dehydrated should be given fl uids IV or IO. The primary IV sites we use are the cephalic, lateral saphenous, or auricular veins. The site for catheter placement should be sterilely prepared before catheter placement. The largest bore catheter that can be fi tted comfortably into the vein should be used. For most large breeds, a 20-or 22-gauge catheter can be used, whereas a 24-or 26-gauge catheter may be required for smaller breeds. A smaller bore catheter should be used for the auricular vein. The peripheral site for IO catheter placement is the femur. A surgical preparation using a disinfectant (e.g., Betadine or chlorhexidine) should be done to minimize contamination at the catheter site. A local anesthetic should be used to minimize the discomfort associated with the procedure. The trochanteric fossa is the landmark for catheter insertion. A spinal needle should be used for the procedure, as it has a stylet and will prevent the needle from being clogged with a bone core. The IO route is preferred in cases where the animal is severely dehydrated and the veins are collapsed. IP fl uids are generally reserved for moderately dehydrated rabbits when IO or IV catheters are not available or for juvenile rabbits. To administer these fl uids, place the rabbit in dorsal recumbency and insert the needle in the caudal abdomen. The needle should be inserted at a 20-to 30-degree angle to the body.

When rabbits stop eating, physiologic changes can occur in the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., mucosal atrophy) that alter the gastrointestinal permeability. From this, a cascade of events can occur (e.g., reduced motility, decreased water absorption, pH alterations, microbial fl ora changes) that lead the animal into a life-threatening situation. The fi rst step in managing these cases should be to restimulate the gastrointestinal tract, and the second step is to diagnose the cause of the anorexia. Providing nutritional support is the best method for restimulating the gastrointestinal tract. Motility modifi ers can also be used, but these should be given only when there is no concern for a gastric or small intestine foreign body (e.g., trichobezoar). The preferred method for administering nutritional support to mild or moderately ill animals is syringe feeding. In more severe cases, an orogastric tube or nasogastric tube should be placed. A 3.5-to 5.0-French pediatric feeding tube can be used as a nasogastric tube. Before placing the tube, it should be marked to estimate the distance between the nare and the stomach. Placement can be achieved by inserting the tube through the ventral medial nasal meatus and advancing it ventromedially. The rabbit's head should be maintained in a natural position during the procedure to facilitate passage of the tube. Placement of the tube should be evaluated using survey radiographs. Once placed, the tube can be secured to the skin covering the nasal bones using suture. A pharyngostomy or gastrotomy tube can also be placed to facilitate feeding.",

One compound that should be avoided is Telazol (Fort Dodge Animal Health, Fort Dodge, IA), as it has been shown to cause severe renal tubular necrosis in rabbits. 38 We recommend intubating rabbits for any procedure that requires general anesthesia. When an animal is intubated, it gives the anesthetist more control over the patient. Rabbits that are not intubated and experience respiratory arrest are rarely recovered. Intubating rabbits can be diffi cult. These animals have long, narrow oral cavities, which restrict direct visualization of the larynx. Several techniques have been described for intubating rabbits. Blind intubation using a 2.0 to 2.5 outside diameter (OD) endotracheal tube can be done, but it can be associated with laryngeal trauma. 9 To perform the procedure, the head should be elevated and neck stretched. The endotracheal tube should be gently lowered into the trachea. This technique requires patience and skill. Practicing this technique on recently expired rabbits is one way of obtaining experience with this procedure. Our preferred method for intubating rabbits is via an endoscope. 39 A 2.7-mm rigid endoscope can be used to directly visualize the larynx and ensure passage of the tube into the trachea. In those cases where laryngospasms limit access to the trachea, lidocaine can be applied topically. Rabbits should be monitored closely during a surgical procedure. An ultrasonic Doppler, ECG, and/or pulse oximeter can be used to monitor the heart rate and rhythm during the procedure. A respiratory monitor can be used to monitor respirations. We prefer to use a ventilator during rabbit procedures to ensure that the rabbit is receiving an appropriate dose of anesthesia and oxygen. The ventilator also ensures that the animal is respiring. A capnograph can be added in line to measure carbon dioxide levels and determine the rabbit's respiratory effi ciency. In addition to the capnograph, the pulse oximeter can provide additional blood gas information by providing an estimate of oxygen saturation levels. Rabbits should be provided thermal support during a procedure, and its body temperature should be measured throughout the procedure. Routine anesthetic monitoring during a procedure is essential to a veterinarian's success and will limit the occurrence of anesthetic deaths.",

The same technique described earlier can be used for the orchiectomy, or a suture can be placed around the tunic at the cranial aspect of the incision, an open castration done, the remnant cord directed cranially past the suture placement, and the suture ligature tied down to close the canal. Again, a subcuticular closure or tissue glue can be used to close the skin incision. The animal should be monitored postoperatively for any swelling or discharge in the area of the incision or scrotum.",

            "text": "An ovariohysterectomy should be recommended for any female rabbit not intended for breeding. It is recommended that the procedure be done when the animal is young (<5 months of age) because the amount of intraabdominal fat can increase dramatically with age and will reduce the surgeon's visibility. The incision for a rabbit ovariohysterectomy should be made from cranial to the pelvis to the umbilicus. The incision may need to be extended in some cases. Care should be taken when entering the peritoneal cavity, as the urinary bladder and/or cecum may be directly under the body wall. The ovaries are located in the same location as would be expected for a cat or dog. The ovaries can generally be grasped by hand, but a spay hook may be needed for some large breeds. Once the ovary is in hand, the ovarian pedicle should be identifi ed. Circumferential sutures (at least two) should be placed around the pedicle, and the pedicle incised. The ovary and uterine horns should be gently grasped and elevated from the body cavity. Rabbits have two separate uterine horns, each with its own cervix ( Figure 14-21) . Each uterine horn should be ligated just cranial to its cervix. A circumferential and transfi xation suture can be used to ligate the uterine horn. The large uterine vessels running parallel to the uterine horns should also be ligated at this time. Closure for an ovariohysterectomy is routine. The body wall, subcutaneous space, and subcuticular space can be closed with absorbable suture in a continuous pattern.",

In cases where medical management is not successful, surgery should be considered. Lateral ear resection has been found to provide relief to both the rabbit patient and the pet owner. The approach to the lateral ear resection is similar to that described for dogs. For the procedure, the rabbit should be placed in lateral recumbency. Two parallel incisions should be made at the base of the ear that follow into the line of the pinna. The skin and subcutaneous tissue should be dissected free and refl ected rostrally to reveal the vertical canal. An additional two parallel incisions are made into the lateral wall of the vertical canal. The cartilage should be carefully dissected to avoid the auricular veins. The dissection should continue to the level of the horizontal ear canal. Once exposed, the fl ap of cartilage is removed and the cartilage of the horizontal and vertical canals is sutured to the surrounding subcutaneous and skin tissues using absorbable suture. Rabbits should be maintained in the hospital for a minimum of 5 to 7 days to ensure that the surgical site is disinfected daily and does not dehisce. 32 In severe, chronic cases of otitis interna, when rabbits have nystagmus, head tilt, and radiographic abnormalities in the bulla(e), a total ear canal ablation and tympanic bulla(e) osteoectomy can be performed. For the procedure, the rabbit should be placed in lateral recumbency and the area around the base of the ear clipped and prepped. The skin at the base of the ear should be incised, and the lateral wall of the ear canal dissected away from the subcutaneous tissue without entering the canal. During the dissection process, it is important to remain close to the auricular cartilage to avoid damaging the rostral and caudal auricular veins. Next, the horizontal tract of the ear canal should be dissected down to the junction of the tympanic bulla. At that point, the canal should be transected. The opening of the tympanic bulla should be widened (using needle drivers), debrided, and fl ushed. The subcutaneous tissue surrounding the ablated vertical canal should be closed with 3-0 absorbable suture. After closing the subcutaneous sites, the surgeon should close the tissue surrounding the bulla by marsupializing the opening to the bulla. This will allow for postoperative fl ushing. 32 ",
