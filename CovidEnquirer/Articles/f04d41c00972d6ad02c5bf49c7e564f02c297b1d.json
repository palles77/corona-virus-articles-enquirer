The clinical and laboratory characteristics of hospitalized COVID-19 patients were described. 1, 2 Cough is one of the most common symptoms at onset of illness. 3 Here, we described the differences in characteristics of nasopharyngeal swab detection between patients with and without respiratory symptoms. We believe that patients with respiratory symptoms are more harmful to close contacts. First, the virus can be shed explosively from the COVID-19 patients' upper respiratory tract into the air through coughing. Second, the duration of virus shedding from nasopharynx was longer. It is an effective precaution to stop droplets spreading by hand or with towel when coughing. After coughing, the importance of frequent and proper hand hygiene should be emphasized. Moreover, strict precautions must be observed when handling the towel contaminated with spittle.",
