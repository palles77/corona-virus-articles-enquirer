On the other hand, virus spread by contaminated semen by artificial insemination can be enormous, since contaminated semen could infect numerous farms, areas, or even countries within a few hours or days. Pseudorabies virus (PRV) has been detected in semen (Guerin et al., 1995) , and foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV), and African swine fever virus (AFSV) have been isolated from porcine semen (Thacker et al., 1984) . For SVDV and AFSV, transmission to sows by artificial insemination of contaminated semen has been reported (McVicar et al., 1977; Thacker et al., 1984) . Under experimental conditions it was shown that transmission of CSFV by artificial insemination was possible and that semen contaminated with CSFV could cause an infection in sows after artificial insemination (de Smit et al., 1999) . Transmission of PRRSV to sows artificially inseminated with undiluted semen from experimentally infected boars has also been demonstrated (Yaeger et al., 1993) . It has been suggested that the introduction of PRRSV in herds by semen contaminated with PRRSV might even be of high risk (LePotier et al., 1997) . All these reports demonstrated the potential risk of virus spread by contaminated semen through artificial insemination. Frequent monitoring, and all kinds of precautions intensively guards the health of boars in artificial insemination centers in order to prevent virus transmission via semen. But, the occurrence of viral diseases in the AI centers is still possible as introduction of virus into the centers cannot be excluded completely. Despite all precautions, virus spread via semen still could remain unnoticed.",

It has been shown that even matrices such as boar semen can be used in PCR-based tests (Shin et al., 1997) . However, conventional PCR tests can be hampered by the high risk of contamination of previously amplified material. Recently, the quantitative ReTi-PCR technology has been developed with several advantages to the conventional PCR. The ReTi-PCR technique combines amplification and detection of amplified products in one closed tube. Therefore amplified material will not be released in the environment by reopening and other handlings of test tubes. Consequently, the chance of contamination of other test samples by previously amplified material is strongly reduced.",

If necessary, primers and/or probes were degenerated at defined nucleotide positions in order to maximize the detection of all known strains and isolates. For each ReTi-PCR, two probes were designed to hybridize side by side on the PCR product. The 3 end of the upstream probe was labeled with fluorescein acting as a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) donor for the acceptor dye (LC Red 640) coupled to the 5 end of the downstream probe. The FRET signal is transmitted only if donor and acceptor hybridize to their respective specific regions and in the vicinity of each other.",

This means that PRRSV test results of blood samples not always reflect the situation in semen, and that, despite intensive monitoring of boars with regular tests on blood samples, the safety of semen cannot be guaranteed for 100%. Although we did not use infected semen on recipient sows, others have shown that intra-vaginal infection by artificial insemination with contaminated semen is possible (Thacker et al., 1984; Yaeger et al., 1993; de Smit et al., 1999) . Based on the experimental data, we conclude that artificial insemination could be a potential risk for the transmission of PRV, CSFV, FMDV, SVDV and PRRSV to pig producing farms. To minimize the risk of introducing viral infections by artificial insemination as much as possible, semen may be screened for the presence of infectious viruses or viral genomic sequences by very sensitive tests. Due to the fact that undiluted semen is often toxic for cultures of many cell types, virus isolation can often not be used for the detection of viruses in semen or its sensitivity is too low. In addition, virus isolation is laborious and expensive. But most important, virus isolation is time consuming and therefore not applicable for boar semen, since this can only be stored temporarily, or for the rapid diagnosis of list-A diseases. Most conventional methods, used for the diagnosis of list-A diseases, take several days depending on the virus of interest. In contrast to virus isolation, the newly developed ReTi-PCR tests are rapid assays as results can be obtained within 4 h. This also offers opportunities to screen fresh semen prior to insemination for the presence of viruses such as PRRSV, as semen has been suspected to be an important source in the transmission of PRRSV (LePotier et al., 1997) .",

For PRRSV, the sensitive bioassay confirmed two positive results of the ReTi-PCR, whereas virus isolations of these semen samples were negative. The presence of neutralizing antibodies may partly interfere with the low virus recovery by virus isolation. The presence of neutralizing antibodies might also explain the low recovery of CSFV in semen collected after day 12 pi by virus isolation, as antibodies were detected in all boars experimentally infected with CSFV. Furthermore, our study also shows that the presence of viruses in semen was detected earlier by ReTi-PCR than by virus isolation, but also earlier than most antibody detection assays. For example, the ReTi-PCR was able to detect FMDV at 1 day pi. Early diagnosis and rapid measures to reduce the transmission and spread of list-A diseases, such as CFS, FMD and SVD, are of great importance. However, the ReTi-PCR tests may also have their limitations as some semen samples were scored as negative whereas virus isolation became positive, although only after one blind passage. A more extensive validation study needs to be performed to determine the real percentage of false negative samples by ReTi-PCR, and whether these ReTi-PCR tests have their limitations.",

It might also offer new opportunities for the screening of probably also other materials, besides semen, for the presence of viruses. It is appreciated that the PRV, CSFV, and the SVDV ReTi-PCR tests still have to prove their value in outbreak situations, and that the PRRSV ReTi-PCR has to prove its value for export and in the delivery of PRRSV-negative semen to PRRSV-free herds. To date, only the FMDV ReTi-PCR has proven its value in an outbreak situation. Their study showed that for the validation of other samples, such as plasma and tissues samples, only the DNA/RNA isolation procedure for that particular sample had to be optimized, whereas the conditions for amplification and detection remained unchanged (Moonen et al., 2003) .",

Although, the presented ReTi-PCR tests have not been accepted yet by the OIE as reference tests, these ReTi-PCR tests have several advantages above the routinely used virus isolation techniques, and therefore these PCR tests can be used as valuable supplementary assays in the early and rapid detection of mentioned viruses in semen and for surveillance purposes.",

Boar B lost appetite after a few days post-infection, and showed a strongly reduced libido starting from day 4 till day 14 pi (Table 4 ). Boar C also showed a strongly reduced libido as observed on days 6-8 pi. None of the collected semen samples were SVDV positive by virus isolation in the first passage. However, after one blind passage on IBRS-2 cells, a few samples became SVDV positive. Only one semen sample was clearly positive by ReTi-PCR, whereas seven semen samples were weakly positive suggesting low number of SVDV RNA. Remarkably, no correlation was found between results obtained by virus isolation and ReTi-PCR. Duplicate analyses of the SVDV suspected semen samples confirmed the results obtained in the first ReTi-PCR run. The weak positive results obtained by virus isolation and ReTi-PCR indicated that SVDV strain net92 is excreted in semen, however, most likely to a very low extent.The SVDV neutralization test revealed the development of neutralizing antibodies against SVDV starting on day 9 pi for boar A and on day 7 pi for the boar nos. B and C (data not shown).",

            "text": "To investigate PRRSV excretion in semen, three boars were infected with PRRSV strain LV ter Huurne, and serum and semen samples were collected for ReTi-PCR and virus isolation (Tables 5 and 6 ). In general, serum samples were positive by virus isolation and ReTi-PCR within comparable periods after infection. Virus isolation was positive from day 8 pi till day 22 pi (boar no. 1), and from day 6 pi till day 13 pi for boar nos. 2 and 3. In two boars, nos. 1 and 3, the presence of PRRSV in serum was detected earlier by ReTi-PCR than by virus isolation. Serum of boar no. 1 was virus isolation positive at day 22 pi, whereas the ReTi-PCR was negative.For semen samples, PRRSV detection by ReTi-PCR was positive as early as 6 days pi for boar nos. 1 and 3. Only one semen sample from boar no. 2 was scored as positive by ReTi-PCR (day 31 pi). A positive reaction was obtained again after retesting this semen sample by ReTi-PCR.Whereas 17 samples were positive in the ReTi-PCR test, only 2 semen samples were PRRSV-positive by virus isolation. Semen collected from boar 2 remained negative by virus isolation during the entire experiment. PRRSV was detected intermittently in semen from boar nos. 1 and 3, and prolonged up to 45 days pi, whereas viraemia was not detected by ReTi-PCR after 20 days pi in the respective boars (Tables 5 and 6 ). Apparently, the excretion period of PRRSV via semen is not similar to the viraemic period.A bioassay was performed to compare this sensitive method with the PRRSV ReTi-PCR. The bioassay showedns: no semen collected.that pigs injected with semen samples collected at day 20 pi from boar no. 1, and at day 22 pi from boar no. 3 became infected with PRRSV (Table 6) .",

            "text": "This study shows that ReTi-PCR tests, for the detection of PRV, CSFV, FMDV, SVDV, and PRRSV in boar semen, are highly specific and very sensitive (low limits of detection) with respect to virus isolation. Furthermore, ReTi-PCR tests proved to have several advantages in the detection of viruses in semen above the conventionally used virus isolation methods. Due to its sensitivity and rapidity, ReTi-PCR tests can be used for the sensitive screening of semen for the presence of viruses during outbreaks, for the rapid screening of semen for the presence of e.g. PRRSV prior to artificial insemination, and these tests offer opportunities for the early diagnosis of list A-diseases. The ReTi-PCR technique makes it possible to develop highly specific PCR tests mainly based on the strategic choice of primers in combina-tion with specific probes. Herein, the blast search is a powerful tool in the search for conserved regions with respect to related and non-related viruses. Due to strict regimes of sample preparation, and the use of a closed system (amplification and analyses in one closed capillary) strongly reduces the spread of previously amplified product and consequently the risk of contamination as observed by conventional PCR techniques.The use of artificial insemination has increased enormously in the swine industry. One disadvantage of this increase might be that one infected boar can rapidly infect multiple sows in more than one area or country. As viral infections can run a subclinical course, not all virus infections in boars will result in clinical symptoms, such as fever or reduced libido. This indicates that boars can shed virus in semen without showing clinical signs. This theory was confirmed by some of the boars infected experimentally. PRV, CSFV, FMDV, PRRSV, and to a lesser extent SVDV, were excreted in semen of experimentally infected boars, and furthermore, excretion could occur intermittently. For PRRSV it was shown that excretion in semen was prolonged and",
