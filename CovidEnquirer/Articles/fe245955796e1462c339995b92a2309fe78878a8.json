The replicase complex assembles on double membrane vesicles (DMVs). Here, we studied the role of a putative replicase anchor, nonstructural protein 4 (nsp4), in the assembly of murine coronavirus DMVs. We used reverse genetics to generate infectious clone viruses (icv) with an alanine substitution at nsp4 glycosylation site N176 or N237, or an asparagine to threonine substitution (nsp4-N258T), which is proposed to confer a temperature sensitive phenotype. We found that nsp4-N237A is lethal and nsp4-N258T generated a virus (designated Alb ts6 icv) that is temperature sensitive for viral replication. Analysis of Alb ts6 icv-infected cells revealed that there was a dramatic reduction in DMVs and that both nsp4 and nsp3 partially localized to mitochondria when cells were incubated at the non-permissive temperature. These results reveal a critical role of nsp4 in directing coronavirus DMV assembly.",

Gene 1 contains two open reading frames (ORFs) that produce two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab (Fig. 1A) . Polyprotein 1a is processed by viral proteinases to generate intermediates and mature products nsp1-nsp11. Polyprotein 1ab is generated by a ribosomal frameshift between ORF1a and ORF1b and contains all 16 nsps (Masters, 2006; Ziebuhr and Snijder, 2007) . For MHV, these large polyproteins undergo extensive proteolytic processing by three virally encoded proteinases, papain-like proteinase (PLP) 1, PLP2, and 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro) to produce intermediate and mature replicase proteins (Baker et al., 1989; Bonilla et al., 1997; Bost et al., 2000; Denison et al., 1995; Graham and Denison, 2006; Kanjanahaluethai and Baker, 2001; Kanjanahaluethai et al., 2003; Lu et al., 1998 Lu et al., , 1995 Schiller et al., 1998) . The replicase intermediate p150 contains the mature products nsp4-nsp11 and has been proposed to be functional in the synthesis of negative strand RNA and/or as a scaffold for the assembly of the transcriptase/ replicase complex (Kanjanahaluethai and Baker, 2000; Sawicki et al., 2007 Sawicki et al., , 2005 .",

We found that nsp4-N176 and nsp4-N237 are glycosylated and that substitution of nsp4-N237 to alanine was lethal for virus replication, whereas substitution of nsp4-N176 to alanine had no effect on virus replication.

Briefly, PCR based site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the plasmid DNA containing the region of nsp4 to be mutated (Clone B) using specific primers (Table 1) . Each mutant clone B DNA fragment was ligated with the remaining six WT fragments to produce full-length MHV cDNA which was then in vitro transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase. Infectious RNA was electroporated into BHK-MHVR cells and cells were laid over a semi-confluent monolayer of DBT cells. Cells were incubated at 33\u00b0C and scored for cytopathic effect. Supernatant from cells showing syncytia formation was collected and passaged over a fresh monolayer of DBT cells to generate a stock of infectious clone virus. RNA was isolated from mock and icv-infected DBT cells and RT-PCR was performed to amplify the region containing the mutation of interest. Amplicons were sequenced to verify the presence of the engineered mutation (Fig. 2) . Infectious viruses were successfully obtained for position N176A (referred to as nsp4-N176A icv) and N258T (designated Alb ts6 icv). However, we were unable to generate the nsp4-N237A single or nsp4-N176A/N237A double mutant virus, which indicates that mutation of N237 may be lethal for nsp4 function.",

Two sets of DBT cells were infected with WT-A59 icv or Alb ts6 icv at an MOI of 1.0 and incubated at 33\u00b0C. At 3.5 h.p.i., one set of infected cells was shifted to 39.5\u00b0C.

As shown in Fig. 7A , staining for nsp4 (green) and mitochondria (red) was non-overlapping in cells infected with WT-A59 icv at either temperature. At the permissive temperature, Alb ts6 icv nsp4 and mitochondria displayed a very slight increase in co-localization versus WT-A59 icv. At 39.5\u00b0C however, co-localization of nsp4 and mitochondria was substantially increased.

Antibodies against nsp3 and nsp4 were again used to detect replicase products. As seen in Fig. 8 , extensive overlap between replicase proteins nsp3 and nsp4 and mitochondria was detected only in the Alb ts6 icv-infected cells incubated at the non-permissive temperature (39.5\u00b0C). Similar results were obtained with MitoTracker stained HeLa-MHVR cells and MitoTracker and PDH were found to completely overlap (data not shown). These results are consistent with the TEM studies and reveal that the mutant form of nsp4 is partially localized to mitochondria at the non-permissive temperature. Furthermore, we also detected co-localization with mitochondria using the \u03b1-nsp3 antibody in Alb ts6 icv-infected cells incubated at 39.5\u00b0C (Figs. 7B and 8B) . Importantly, nsp3, and perhaps other replicase products, are misdirected due to nsp4 mis-localization and are likely unable to efficiently assemble into functional DMVs in the Alb ts6 icv-infected cells. This inability to generate functional DMVs and/or replication complexes would lead to an inability to synthesize viral RNA, which is the reported phenotype of Alb ts6 (Sawicki et al., 2005) .",

Via reverse genetics, we engineered the nsp4-N258T mutation into MHV and designated this virus as Alb ts6 icv.

Alb ts6 icv titers were reduced approximately 5 orders of magnitude when incubated at the nonpermissive temperature; however, Alb ts6 icv titers at 33\u00b0C were comparable to WT-A59 icv (Fig. 3A) . Growth kinetics, assayed by a one-step growth curve at the permissive temperature, were indistinguishable between Alb ts6 icv and WT-A59 icv.

Currently, it is unclear if a replicase precursor or only the final replicase products are directed to specific membrane sites or if nsp4 is actually penetrating the mitochondrial membrane. Since nsp4 is an integral membrane protein originally derived from the ER, the co-localization detected may be due to membrane reorganization.

Could nsp4-N258T be localizing to mitochondria in error resulting in reduced DMV assembly? Or is there a mitochondrial phase in MHV replication whose progression is inhibited by the nsp4-N258T substitution? Previous studies demonstrate that for some viruses, the replicase complex can be directed to use different membrane sources for efficient virus replication. For example, Flock house virus (FHV) normally induces spherules within the outer membrane of the mitochondria providing precedence for the use of mitochondrial membranes as the site of membrane-bound replication complex assembly (Kopek et al., 2007; Miller and Ahlquist, 2002; Miller et al., 2001) . To determine if mitochondrial membranes were required for replication, Miller et al. (2003) replaced the mitochondrial outer membrane targeting signal of FHV protein-A with that of an ER targeting signal and measured viral replication. They found that the ER-targeted replication complex functioned as efficiently, if not more efficiently, than the normal mitochondria-targeted replication complex. There-fore, a specific source of membranes for replication complex assembly is not required for FHV. For MHV, it is unclear if the replication complex could be appropriately targeted to mitochondria, or if cytoplasmic DMVs are critical for MHV replication. In addition, it will be interesting to determine if WT nsp4 or nsp4-N258T expressed in trans can direct MHV replication complexes to specific membrane sites.",

Interestingly, although MHV ORF1a encodes eleven mature nsps, mutants within ORF1a do not complement each other.

For example, virus with a mutation in nsp10 (TS-LA6) crossed with a nsp4 mutant (Alb ts6) do not complement each other (Sawicki et al., 2005) . Donaldson et al. (2007) suggest that the icTS-LA6, which exhibits a processing defect, fails to complement due to the inability to generate mature forms of nsp4-nsp16. Thus, a mutation in a single nsp (nsp10) affects the production of several nsps (nsp4-nsp16). Likewise, the mutation analyzed in this study, nsp4-N258T, which results in defects in DMV assembly and localization, also affects the localization of other nsps, such as nsp3. Therefore, like the icTS-LA6, the defect in Alb ts6 icv induces an overarching defect in MHV replication. These observations highlight the complex nature of coronavirus replication complex assembly and maturation and indicate that interplay among partially and fully processed replicase products ultimately leads to competent replication complexes.",
