The spontaneous or induced cell fusion of two different types of cells (heterokaryons) generates intraspecific or interspecific hybrid cells. Genetically programmed spontaneous cell fusion is known to occur in the formation of polykaryons such as myotubes, osteoclasts, and syntrophoblasts in vivo. Under in vitro culture conditions, spontaneous cell fusion has been found to occur occasionally in some cell lines and malignant cells. Cell fusion due to membrane integrity between two different cells is induced by treatment with chemical agents such as calcium ions, lysolecithin, and polyethylene glycol; by mediation by viruses such as paramyxoviruses, including Sendai virus (HVJ), oncornavirus, coronavirus, herpesvirus and poxvirus; and by electrofusion.",

This nuclear reprogramming results from the resetting of the somatic cell-specific epigenetic program by transacting factors present in unfertilized oocytes. Nearly 20 years ago, genomic plasticity had already been examined by cell fusion experiments between differentiated cell types (Blau et al., 1985; Baron and Maniatis, 1986; Blau and Baltimore, 1991) . More recently, this approach has been used to study genomic reprogramming that occurs in X chromosome reactivation (Takagi et al., 1983; Tada et al., 2001; and switching of parental origin-specific marks of imprinted genes (Tada et al., 1997) .",

In hybrid cells between ES cells and adult thymocytes, nuclear reprogramming of the somatic genome has been demonstrated by (1) the contribution of ES hybrid cells to normal embryogenesis of chimeras, (2) reactivation of the silenced X chromosome derived from female somatic cells, (3) reactivation of pluripotential cell-specific genes, Oct4, Xist, and Tsix, which were derived from the somatic cell, (4) redifferentiation into a variety of cell types in teratomas, (5) tissue-specific gene expression from the reprogrammed somatic genome in addition to the ES genome in in vivodifferentiated teratomas and in vitro-differentiated neuronal cells, and (6) acquisition by reprogrammed somatic genomes of pluripotential cell-specific histone tail modifications. More interestingly, cell fusion experiments between somatic cells and embryonic germ (EG) cells derived from the gonadal primordial germ cells of mouse 11.5-12.5dpc embryos have demonstrated that EG cells possess an additional potential for inducing the reprogramming of somatic cell-derived parental imprints accompanied by the disruption of parental origin-specific DNA methylation of imprinted genes (Tada et al., 1997 (Tada et al., , 1998 . Therefore, cell fusion with pluripotential stem cells is now recognized as a powerful approach for elucidating mechanisms of epigenetic reprogramming involving DNA and chromatin modifications.",

ES cells are adherent cells that undergo selfrenewal by rapid cell division, whereas thymocytes are nondividing and nonadherent cells. In order to select the hybrid cells effectively, either thymocytes carrying the neo transgene or male ES cells deficient for the Xlinked Hprt (hyoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase) gene are used as the partner cells in the cell fusion. Consequently, only hybrid cell colonies are capable of surviving and growing in culture in the presence of antibiotic G418 or HAT (hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine). ",

The culture conditions are basically those described previously (Abbondanzo et al., 1993) . A crucial point is quality control of the FBS, which is added to make the ES cell culture medium cocktail. FBS certified for ES cell culturing has become available commercially. We strongly recommend the use of a suitable production lot of FBS that can support effective cell growth without inducing differentiation equivalently to the ES cell-certified FBS. ",

Thus, only the hybrid cells between ES cells and somatic cells survive, proliferate, and form colonies.

Thymocytes are derived from ROSA26 transgenic mice, which carry the ubiq-uitously expressed neo/lacZ transgene (Friedrich and Soriano, 1991) . Only ES hybrid cells with the thymocytes can survive and grow in the ES medium supplemented with the antibiotic G418, a protein synthesis inhibitor. In this case, the ES hybrid cells and their derivatives are identified visually by their positive reaction with X-gal due to ~3-galactosidase activity, allowing one to analyze their contribution to the development of chimeric embryos and tissues (Tada et al., 1997 (Tada et al., , 2001 . Male ES cells deficient for the Hprt gene on the X chromosome are a powerful tool for producing hybrid cells with wild-type somatic cells. Electrofusion-treated cells are cultured in ES medium with the HAT supplement. In DNA synthesis, purine nucleotides can be synthesized by the de novo pathway and recycled by the salvage pathway. Hprt is a purine salvage enzyme, responsible for converting the purine degradation product hypoxanthine to inosine monophosphate, a precursor of ATP and GTP. In the presence of aminopterin, the de novo pathway is inhibited and only the salvage pathway functions. Consequently, dysfunction of Hprt induces cell death in cultures grown in HAT medium. Thus, the HAT medium proves fatal to Hprt-deficient ES cells, whereas ES hybrid cells, which are rescued by the thymocytes-derived wild-type Hprt gene, are able to survive and proliferate Kimura et al., 2003) .",

Hybrid cells between embryonic carcinoma (EC) cells deficient for the Hprt gene and lymphocytes from the thymus or spleen are produced by cell fusion induced chemically by PEG (Takagi et al., 1983) . To produce ES hybrid cells using PEG, wash a mixture of ES cells and thymocytes with DMEM and pellet the cells by centrifugation. Prewarm l ml of a 50% PEG mixture (PEG4000/DMEM = 1:1) at 37~ and then add the PEG mixture to the cell pellet gradually using the tip of a pipette. Add 9ml of DMEM gradually. Collect the cells by centrifugation, resuspend the cells in ES medium, and transfer them to a culture dish. Selection of hybrid cells is begun 1 day after the PEG-induced fusion treatment. Electrofusion has the following advantages over the PEGinduced cell fusion: (1) electrofusion is appropriate for in vivo applications of the hybrid cells, whereas PEGinduced fusion is not because PEG is toxic to cells; (2) electrofusion is more efficient and reproducible than PEG-induced cell fusion for producing ES hybrid cells; and (3) it is easier to produce hybrid cells by electrofusion than by PEG-induced fusion.",

Prepare frozen stocks of the MMC-treated PEFs at a concentration of 5 x 106 cells/ml and store in a cryotube in liquid nitrogen. The inactivated neo r PEFs are routinely used as feeder cells (1 x 10 6 cells/60mm culture dish and 2.5 x 106 cells/100-mm culture dish) for culture of ES and hybrid cells, and also for selection of hybrid cell colonies with G418.
