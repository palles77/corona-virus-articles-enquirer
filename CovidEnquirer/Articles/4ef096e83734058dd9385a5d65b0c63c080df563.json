Previous experiments have shown that RlmM is active on 23S rRNA from an RlmM knockout strain but not on mature 50S subunits from the same strain. Here, we demonstrate RlmM methyl transferase (MTase) activity on in vitro transcribed 23S rRNA and its domain V. We have solved crystal structures of E. coli RlmM at 1.9 \u00c5 resolution and of an RlmM-AdoMet complex at 2.6 \u00c5 resolution. RlmM consists of an N-terminal THUMP domain and a C-terminal catalytic Rossmann-like fold MTase domain in a novel arrangement. The catalytic domain of RlmM is closely related to YiiB, TlyA and fibrillarins, with the second K of the catalytic tetrad KDKE shifted by two residues at the C-terminal end of a beta strand compared with most 2 0 O MTases. The AdoMet-binding site is open and shallow, suggesting that RNA substrate binding may be required to form a conformation needed for catalysis. A continuous surface of conserved positive charge indicates that RlmM uses one side of the two domains and the inter-domain linker to recognize its RNA substrate.",

In addition, in some cases knockouts of native modifications in this region lead to higher sensitivity to antibiotics, suggesting an evolutionary link to intrinsic resistance to natural antibiotics (10, 13) .

Nucleoside 2498 is located at the start of a conserved sequence CXUCGAU in the central loop of domain V of 23S rRNA that has four modification sites ( Figure 1A ). In high-resolution crystal structures of ribosomes from different bacteria (14) (15) (16) , C2498 and U2500 are base paired to G2454 and A2453, respectively, at the end of helix 89, and the modification site is surrounded by the peptidyl transferase loop, the 570 region and the 2031 region of 23S rRNA ( Figure 1B ). The 2 0 O methylation adds hydrophobicity and has been suggested to stabilize the structure by filling a void in the packing between these regions (2) . Sequence analysis showed that RlmM contains a C-terminal Rossmann-like fold methyl transferase (MTase) domain that uses S-adenosyl methionine (AdoMet) as a methyl donor. This class of enzymes contain a 2 0 O-ribose MTase-specific consensus K-D-K-E/ H catalytic tetrad necessary to perform methyl transfer from AdoMet to the 2 0 OH of the target (17) .",

Most RNA modifications, such as 2 0 O methylation, can be detected directly using primer extension by reverse transcriptase and gel electrophoresis (24) . Low dNTP concentrations cause reverse transcriptase to pause one nucleotide before a 2 0 O methylation site (31) and the optimal dGTP concentration for Cm2498 detection reported by Purta et al. was also used here. A prominent C2499 band, induced by methylation on C2498, appeared after incubation of IVT with RlmM, showing RlmM does not rely on prior modifications to the 23S rRNA for activity ( Figure 2A ). Smaller fragments were also detected at G2502, G2508 and U2511 in all lanes, presumably due to strong secondary structure and limiting dGTP for the templated C that follows in each case. A reverse transcriptase stop on U2504 corresponding to wild-type methylation on A2503 can also be seen in the WT lane and not in the IVT lane, as expected ( Figure 2A ). Standardizing the intensity of the C2499 band to the average of band intensities of these smaller fragments allowed comparisons between lanes. On the basis of band intensity, the extent of modification in the in vitro reaction is nearly the same as found in the E. coli wild-type 23S rRNA (Figure 2A) , which was previously determined to be stoichiometric on 23S rRNA (32) . In addition, RlmM is capable of modifying unmodified 23S rRNA domain V alone to the same extent as full length IVT ( Figure 2B ). This demonstrates that RlmM recognition is neither dependent on other domains of the 23S rRNA nor other rRNA modifications. Although the primer extension assay is not highly quantitative, it was possible to use it to measure methylation of IVT by RlmM over time, showing >80% reaction completion after 45 min with a rudimentary initial velocity ( Figure 2C; Supplementary Figure S1 ) similar to other MTases under similar in vitro conditions (33) (34) .",

Molecular replacement trials with other Rossmann-like fold MTase domains failed to provide sufficient phase information to build the structure. The P3 1 21 structure was solved by SAD phasing using a K 2 PtCl 4 derivative and refined against the native data to 1.95 \u00c5 resolution. The resulting model was used to solve the 1.9 \u00c5 P31 structure by molecular replacement. The final refined structures of RlmM contain residues 1-357. The C-terminal residues 358-366 and the His-tag were disordered in all structures. RlmM was also co-crystallized with AdoMet in the P3 1 21 crystal form and the resulting structure will be described below.

The minimal THUMP domain is an RNA-binding fold containing a four-stranded mixed b-sheet that was identified on the sequence level and named after its predicted occurrence in thiouridine synthases, RNA methylases and pseudouridine synthases of all kingdoms of life (37) . The minimal THUMP domain was first observed in the structure of the tRNA thiouridine synthase ThiI (38) , where it is similarly fused to an N-terminal FLD. This arrangement was subsequently observed in several structures and is now classified as the THUMP domain family in the SCOP database.

Interestingly, in both of these enzymes, the THUMP domains are followed by catalytic Rossmann-like fold MTase domains, but in a different orientation compared with RlmM (further discussed in the subsequent sections). The same is true for a putative methylase from Clostridium difficile. THUMP domains only share 10-15% sequence identity, explaining why these domains were not detected in sequence analysis. The THUMP domain also occurs in combination with other catalytic domains; an N-terminal cytidine deaminase domain in the archaeal tRNA C8 deaminase CDAT8 (42) and a C-terminal PP-loop pyrophosphatase domain in ThiI (38) . In TAN1, a protein essential for the ac 4 C modification in tRNA, a tRNA-binding THUMP domain occurs by itself and needs an un-identified catalytic subunit for modification activity (37, 43) . Thus, the THUMP domain has the role of RNA recognition in several different enzymes that act on rRNA or tRNA. In comparison with previously observed THUMP domains, RlmM has a few unique features ( Figure 5A-D) . The strand b4 is shorter than in the other structures, making only three hydrogen bonds to b7 and thus making the half-barrel into two nearly separate b-sheets. The lengths of b4 and b7 at the center of the sheet affect the shape of the half-barrel, so that RlmM has more of a V-shape, whereas ThiI where both strands participate in the two sheets forms a shallow U and Trm14, TrmN and RlmKL, which have only b4 bridging the two sheets are intermediate. In RlmM, helix a4 is also longer than in the other structures in the direction of the barrel opening, which further contributes to the closing of the opening by pushing b4 inwards. RlmM also contains an extra 3 10 helix that forms hydrophobic interactions with the center of the barrel. Each of the compared THUMP domains have unique structural features, such as an extra b-hairpin in Trm14 and a longer a1 in ThiI, suggesting that the ancient THUMP domain (37) has evolved to form RNA-binding modules of different shape ( Figure 5B-D) .",

Although key catalytic residues are normally conserved among functionally related proteins, there are several examples of long-and short-distance migration of essential residues in the primary sequence (58) . In these cases, although a residue is shifted in the sequence and structure, the positions of the atoms involved in catalysis are preserved. In 2 0 O-ribose MTases, the position of the eamino group of the second catalytic lysine is thought to be crucial for deprotonation of the ribose 2 0 OH, enabling its nucleophilic attack on the AdoMet methyl group (46, 59) (Supplementary Figure S3) . In FlpA, binding of the substrate RNA re-orients the Lys so that its e-amino group can make the proper interaction with the 2 0 OH of the ribose, whereas RlmM and YiiB without RNA and AdoMet adopt conformations where the side chains of K306 and K157 are positioned similarly to the FlpA complex with substrate RNA ( Figure 6B ). This suggests that two optimized variants of the catalytic site for 2 0 Oribose methylation have evolved and that further analysis of the evolutionary relationship between RlmM, FlpA, YiiB and RrmJ would be of interest.",

Similar to proposals for Trm14/TrmN (40) , the likely RNA-binding surface of RlmM involves both domains and a positively charged inter-domain linker; but in our model, RlmM would use a distinct surface of the THUMP domain for RNA binding compared with Trm14/TrmN and RlmKL.
