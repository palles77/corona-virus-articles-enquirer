Approximately 20% of S. pneumoniae are penicillin-resistant and one third are macrolide-resistant. Fluoroquinolone resistance is low in the United States. 11. Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or fluoroquinolone monotherapy as empiric treatment for patients with CAP admitted to the general medical ward. 12. Patients admitted to the intensive care unit should receive coverage for S. pneumoniae, Legionella, and possibly Pseudomonas. 13. The optimum duration of antibiotic administration is unknown (7-10 days is reasonable in most cases). 14. Even with appropriate antibiotic use, fevers may take up to 72 hours to fully resolve. Persistent fevers or declining clinical status should prompt an evaluation for complications or worsening pneumonia. 15. Pulmonary infiltrates can take weeks or months to fully resolve following treatment. 16. Aspiration pneumonitis does not usually require antibiotic therapy unless the patient is at risk for bacterial colonization of the gastric contents or Community-Acquired Pneumonia the symptoms do not resolve within 48 hours of the event. 17. Therapy for aspiration pneumonia includes a swallowing evaluation and antibiotics with activity against gramnegative bacteria.

Preventive measures against CAP include smoking cessation and administration of the polysaccharide pneumococcal and inactivated influenza vaccines. ",

The decision to admit relies on clinical judgment, although there are also prognostic scoring rules that can support this decision. The most widely used and rigorously studied prediction rule is the Pneumonia PORT (Pneumonia Outcomes Research Team) Severity Index (PSI), which stratifies patients into one of five categories using a point system based on several variables at the time of presentation (Fig. 13-1 ). An easy-to-use version is available on the internet at http://ncemi.org.

Therefore, the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends home care for risk classes I to III only. Patients with low PORT scores may fail outpatient treatment because of preexisting conditions, such as social or psychiatric problems, inability to take oral medication, or acute hypoxemia.
