A 1.8 A resolution structure rendering for EBOV NP shown in Figure 6b illustrates that NP44-52 is a buried structural loop, which is likely to be important to the structural integrity of the EBOV NP protein [13] . This structural role of NP44-52 likely explains its conservation across EBOV strains. We saw what appears to be an innate immune response at the 10,000 PFU EBOV exposure level. It has been suggested that EBOV can mediate an innate immunity response through stimulation of TLR-4 [28] . Because the adjuvanted 200 microsphere vaccine used in this experiment incorporates a TLR-4 agonist, we dosed 10 mice with adjuvanted microspheres without peptides and found the level of protection after exposure to 100 PFU EBOV to be statistically no different from that seen in PBS buffer controls.

Although vaccine development has been almost exclusively focused on eliciting a humoral immune response in the host through inoculation with whole protein antigen [40][56][46][24], CTL peptide 5 vaccines producing a T-cell response may offer an important alternative approach [19]. For HIV and EBOV and influenza in particular, the potential of CTL vaccines has been discussed [17][6][44]. Although computational prediction alone has been used for T-cell vaccine design [2][11], we saw a unique opportunity to see if a preventative EBOV T-cell vaccine could be successfully Acquired immunity has been documented after EBOV infection [3]. Antibody as well as T-cell responses have been described [34]. Sakebe et al have shown that of 30 subjects surviving the 2013-2016 EBOV outbreak in West Africa, CD8+ T-cells from 26 of those survivors responded to at least one EBOV antigen, with 25 of the 26 responders targeting epitopes on EBOV NP 25 [39]. One of the most commonly targeted EBOV eptitopes on EBOV NP in the survivor group (targeted by CD8+ cells from four survivors) was NP41-60",

The existence of such epitopes makes possible a range of pre-clinical vaccine experiments without having to rely on non-human 35 primates and expensive and complex-to-manage humanized mouse models. Wilson et al showed that the EBOV nucleoprotein (NP) is an immunogen that provides protective, CTL-mediated immunity against EBOV in a C57BL/6 mouse model and that this protection was conferred by a peptide sequence within Ebola Zaire: NP43-53 (VYQVNNLEEIC) [59]. Wilson et al came to this conclusion 40 based on studying splenocytes harvested from mice vaccinated with Ebola Zaire NP using a Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) vector. Their experiments showed that splenocytes from the vaccinated mice re-stimulated with NP43-53 had high levels of cytotoxic activity against target cells loaded with the EBOV NP peptide. Remarkably, NP43-53 also happens to be an 11 amino acid sub-45 sequence of the epitope identified by Sakebe et al, as most commonly favored for T-cell attack by survivors of the 2013-2016 EBOV outbreak in West Africa.",

However, observations derived from individuals able to control HIV infection [33] 165 and EBOV infection [39] demonstrating that control may be associated with specific CTL targeting behavior, suggest that there may be an important role for HLA restricted peptide vaccines for protection against infectious disease for which development of an effective traditional whole protein vaccine has proved to be difficult.

Recent advances in T-cell based vaccines have focused on avoiding all variable viral epitopes and incorporating only conserved regions [6][21]. EBOV NP may more conserved than nucleocapsid proteins VP35 and VP24 making it more suitable as a CTL vac-185 cine target [7][59]. The nucleocapsid proteins in SARS-CoV are also essential for that virus to function normally [8]. This suggests that a CTL vaccine targeting coronavirus nucleocapsid could be effective against SARS-CoV or COVID-19. We have shown that an H2-D b restricted Class I peptide exists within the NP41-60 epitope identified by Sakebe et al as the most commonly favored NP 190 epitope for CD8+ attack by survivors of the 2013-1016 EBOV outbreak in West Africa. We have demonstrated, when delivered in conjunction with a predictedmatched Class II epitope using an adjuvanted microsphere peptide vaccine platform, NP44-52 protection against mortality and morbidity for the maEBOV challenge doses tested in a C57BL/6 mouse model.

MHC binding algorithms hosted by the IEDB predict that YQVNNLEEI will bind strongly to the MHC of HLA-A*02:06, HLA-A*02:03 and HLA-A*02:01 individuals (Supplementary MaterialTable 2) [52]. HLA-225 DR binding database analysis also suggests that VKNEVNSFKAALSSLAKHG demonstrates sufficiently promiscuous binding characteristics cover that same population (Supplementary Material Table 4) [52]. Taken together, a peptide vaccine based on YQVNNLEEI and VKNEVNSFKAALSSLAKHG could pro-duce a cellular immune response in about 50% of the population of the Sudan 230 and about 30% of the population of North America. The internal proteins located within influenza virus, in contrast to the glycoproteins present on the surface, show a high degree of conservation. Epitopes within these internal proteins often stimulate T-cell-mediated immune responses. As a result, vaccines stimulating influenza specific T-cell immunity approach could be applied to COVID-19 which has conserved regions in nucleocapsid which is located within the virus (see multiple sequence alignment in Supplementary Material Figure 8 and Supplementary Material Figure 9). Antigenic escape allows a virus to retain fitness despite an immune 240 response to vaccination [16]. Picking conserved regions for vaccine targeting is an important part of mitigating this problem. Coronavirus spike protein, for example, may be particularly susceptible to mutation meaning that antigenic escape would be likely if the spike protein was targeted by a coronavirus vaccine, making it difficult to achieve durable protection [60]. A recent paper 245 conducted a population genetic analysis of 103 COVID-19 genomes showing that the virus has evolved into two major types: L and S, with changes in their relative frequency after the outbreak possibly due to human intervention resulting in selection pressure [49]. We took all possible 424 9mer peptide sequences from the COVID-19 nu-250 cleocapsid protein sequences available and evaluated each peptide for HLA restriction using NetMHC 4.0 and NetMHCpan 4.0 [52][25][1]. We analyzed 9mer peptide sequences because these are often associated with superior MHC binding properties than class I peptides of other lengths [50]. We found 53 unique peptides with predicted binding below 500nM from NetMHC 4.0 and/or NetMHC-255 pan 4.0. These results are shown in Supplementary Material",
