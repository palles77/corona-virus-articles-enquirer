Outlier in time series has been realized as an influential factor in model fitting and forecasting. Failure to downweigh the outlying effects may lead to a poor model fit, an overestimation of variance, an inappropriate interpretation and an inaccurate prediction. This issue has received a great deal of attention, therefore several approaches have been developed to reduce the influence of outliers and the distributional deviation in the data analysis. Over the past decades, two main approaches are considered to cope with the overdispersion caused by the outliers. The first approach simply incorporates mixture effects to account for the heterogeneity in the distribution of the data. This can be viewed as a missing data problem assuming that the membership of the data from one of the distributions is unknown and has to be estimated. The mixture model is usually implemented using expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm or Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithm.",

Some popular choices of heavy-tailed distributions include the Student's t-distribution and a more general class of distributions is the Pearson Type IV distribution (Johnson et al., 1995) . Alternatively, the exponential power (EP) distribution which can describe a leptokurtic (positive excess kurtosis) or platykurtic (negative excess kurtosis) shape is another good choice. However, the implementation of these distributions is difficult because the derivation of the marginal posterior distributions of the parameters is intractable using conventional numerical and analytic approximations (Choy and Smith, 1997) . To overcome this problem, Box and Tiao (1973) proposed a new exponential power family of normal scale mixtures (SMN) and later Qin et al. (1998) pioneered the scale mixtures of uniform (SMU) which replaced the normal distribution in the SMN form by uniform distribution. Theoretically, any distribution that can be expressed by SMN form, also has a SMU representation.",

The recent emergence of the software WinBUGS which performs the Bayesian statistical inferences using MCMC algorithms also facilitates the implementation of these representations, thus enhancing their popularity in the context of Bayesian modelling. This hierarchical structure is very practical in insurance applications because it is well known that the normal error distribution falls short of allowing for irregular and extreme claims and hence contaminates the estimation procedure and leads to poor estimation. For instances, Choy and Chan (2003) applied the Student's t-and EP distributions in SM representations to predict the insurance premiums to be charged on the policyholders in credibility analysis and Chan et al. (2008) predicted and projected the loss reserves data with various heavy-tailed distributions under the generalized-t distribution family expressed in SMU representation.",

            "text": "To cope with this problem, Thall and Vail (1990) proposed adding cluster-specific and time-specific random effects into the mean link function to give extra-Poisson variation to the data. Thereon, Jowaheer and Sutradhar (2002) incorporated the gamma random effects in the Poisson mixed model and later, Jowaheer et al. (2009) adopted a Poisson mixed model with two independent sources of normal random effects to deal with the problem. Nevertheless, the mixed effects approach which assumes the mean of the Poisson distribution follows gamma or log-normal distribution maybe inadequate to cast light on the outlying effect caused by the extreme observations. To tackle this pitfall, plenty of researches tried various mixing distributions. Some useful ones include generalized inverse Gaussian, generalized gamma, generalized exponential, inverse gamma, etc. Refer to (Gupta and Ong, 2005) for more details. In this paper, we seek a new direction to model overdispersed longitudinally time series of counts due to the presence of outliers. Our proposed model is an extension of the generalized mixture Poisson geometric process (GMPGP) model proposed by Wan and Chan (2009) which is developed from the geometric process (GP) model originated by Lam (1988a,b) . The GMPGP model is a two-component mixture model with a mean function to analyze the covariate effect and a ratio function to describe the time effect. Meanwhile, the mixture effects in both mean and ratio functions can capture the population heterogeneity and overdispersion in the data. See Wan (2006) and Wan and Chan (2009) for more details. In this paper, we introduce a robust mixture Poisson geometric process (RMPGP) model using some heavy-tailed distributions in scale mixture representation. We assume that the outcome variable has a Poisson distribution with a stochastic mean which forms a latent GP, and the mean of the GP after geometrically discounted by the ratio follows a heavy-tailed distribution such as log-t distribution or log-exponential power (log-EP) distribution represented in SMN and SMU forms respectively. Under the scale mixture representation, the model parameters can be simulated using the MCMC algorithms and the mixing parameters help to identify the extreme values in the outlier diagnosis. To our knowledge, this is a pioneering work in adopting Student's t-or EP distributions for Poisson time series. Besides, our proposed GP models have a trend component (ratio function) which enables the study of trends of the outcomes over time and can accommodate the clustering effect using a mixture of homogeneous distributions. These make our model more advantageous than many existing Poisson time series models.",

Since the non-conjugate structure in the posterior distribution for both RMPGP models and the absolute term in the density function of the EP distribution complicate the sampling algorithms, representing the heavy-tailed distributions in a scale mixture form produces a simpler set of full conditional posterior distributions for the parameters and alleviates the computational burden of the Gibbs sampler in the MCMC algorithms. Choy and Smith (1997) has shown that Student's t-and EP distributions can be expressed in scale mixture representation to facilitate the simulation in the MCMC algorithms via a Bayesian hierarchical structure. However, the ways they handle outliers are different. Choy and Walker (2003) revealed that the former downweighs the extreme values, whereas the latter merely downweighs or bounds the influence of the outliers. Thus, it will be interesting to study their performances in outlier diagnosis.

The data were collected from a clinical trial of 59 epileptics by Leppik et al. (1985) . In the randomized controlled trial, = 59 patients suffering from simple or complex partial seizures were assigned to either an antiepileptic drug progabide (z \u00b5i1 = 1) or a placebo (z \u00b5i1 = 0) with no intrinsic therapeutic value. The seizure counts were recorded at a two-week interval for an eight-week period (n i = 4) with no dropout or missing cases. As shown in Table 4 , the seizure counts exhibit a prominent extra-Poisson variation with large variance to mean ratios at all time t due to some outlying observations as displayed in Fig. 4(a) and (b) . To assess the overdispersion in the data, we fit a simple Poisson regression model using a mean link function \u03b7 it = exp(\u03b2 0 + \u03b2 1 z \u00b5i1 + \u03b2 2 t) and a PGP model using a mean function \u00b5 it = exp(\u03b2 \u00b50 + \u03b2 \u00b51 z \u00b5i1 ) and a ratio function a it = exp(\u03b2 a0 +\u03b2 a1 t).

Obviously, neither of the two simple models, as restricted by their equidispersed property, can capture the overdispersion. Besides, the higher mean seizure counts of the placebo group indicate that 'treatment group' is a feasible covariate. Moreover, the gradually decreasing seizure counts over time for both placebo and progabide groups suggests that time t maybe a possible time-evolving effect.

On the other hand, the fitted pmff tl (w) is simply obtained by the numerical approximation described in (5) based on the parameter estimates \u03b8 l and is weighted by \u03c8 b . Based on Fig. 5 (a)-(d), both models imitate the observed pmfs pretty well. However the estimated trend in the ratio function cannot accommodate the upsurge in observation w = 4 at t = 2 resulting in a discrepancy between the observed and fitted pmfs in Fig. 5(b) . It is not surprised to find that the two RMPGP models give similar pmfs as both have the capability of modelling highly overdispersed data. Nevertheless, despite of the affinity, the slightly heavier tail in the distribution of the RMPGP-EP model possibly gives rise to the better DIC . In the best model, the RMPGP-EP model, since extra variation is added to the mean of the Poisson distribution, the variances of the estimated pmff tl (w) of each treatment group and the overall variances which comprises the variance of expectation and the expectation of variance conditional on the mixture group being known, show a dramatic improvement and are reported in Table 4 . Advantageously, implementing the model using Bayesian approach enables us to study the latent stochastic process y * itl and the mixing parameters \u03bb itl which can be output in the coda in WinBUGS. Under the RMPGP-EP model, to examine the density of the unobserved y * itl which are simulated from an EP distribution with location parameter \u00b5 * itl , scale parameter \u03c3 2 l and shape parameter \u03bd l , we compare the densities of the posterior samples of y * itl with the normal distribution which has mean and standard deviation of the posterior samples and the EP distribution with same mean and standard deviation and a shape parameter\u03bd l . Four selected y itl from each cluster group l and treatment group z \u00b51i are illustrated in the following Fig. 6 . Obviously, y it1 's have a leptokurtic shape whereas y it2 's appear to be more uniform than the normal distribution. These agree with the results in Table 5 that the shape parameter of the high-level group is larger than that of the low-level group (\u03bd 1 > \u03bd 2 ) and explain how the EP distribution can downweigh the outlying effect.",

This model allows the mean X itl of the Poisson distribution to follow a GP and the logarithm of the underlying stochastic process {Y it = a t\u22121 it X it } follows a heavytailed distribution. The resultant model is called the RPGP model. By varying a set of model parameters, the properties of the RPGP models are reported in Tables 1 and 2 and their pmfs are revealed in Figs. 1 and 2. Although the marginal pmfs do not have a closed-form, Monte Carlo integration in (5) can be used to approximate the pmf, and hence the mean as well as the variance. Tables 1 and 2 show that the model can accommodate both equidispersed and overdispersed data with varying degrees of kurtosis. The RPGP models and its extension, the RMPGP models to allow clustering effects are implemented using a Bayesian approach. Expressing the heavy-tailed distributions in a scale mixture form facilitates the model implementation using MCMC algorithms and the mixing parameters enables us to perform outlier diagnosis as shown in the real data analysis.

However, comparing Fig. 2(a) withFig. 1(a), the shape parameter \u03bd in the RPGP-EP model allows a wider range of shapes than those of the RPGP-t model as the EP distribution includes both leptokurtic and platykurtic shapes. Hence the RPGP-EP model can accommodate different degrees of tailedness due to moderate to adverse outlying effects. RPGP-t model with varying \u03bd, \u03c3 , \u03b2 \u00b50 and \u03b2 a0 .",
