An overall survival rate of 70% was found for piglets nursing the 12 PRCV-infected gilts, compared to a 16% survival rate for piglets of nine uninfected control gilts. Six of the PRCV-infected gilts had adequate levels of immunity to resist infection with TGEV following the challenge of their litters. These six completely immuned gilts also solidly protected their litters from TGEV as shown by a 96% piglet survival rate through weaning at 3 weeks of age. The results suggest that respiratory infection with PRCV induces a substantial degree of protective lactogenic immunity against TGEV.",

The use of firstlitter gilts in these experiments is the most stringent test for colostral immunity because the possibility of a previously undetected exposure to TGEV is reduced. Gilts were experimentally infected with different doses of PRCV to determine the level of cross-protection, and their litters were uniformly challenged with TGEV at 4 days of age. To stimulate a maximum level of passive immunity, the gilts were immunized three times at 8, 4, and 2 weeks prior to farrowing. The last vaccination was divided between the O/IN and IM routes, the latter emulsified with adjuvant to further stimulate immunity. Passively acquired cross-protection to TGEV by vaccination with PRCV was significant (P= 0.0001 ), but varied among the litters. The overall survival rate was 70% of 103 piglets farrowed by 12 PRCV-vaccinated gilts, compared to a 16% survival rate of 68 TGEV challenged piglets from nine control gilts. Within a litter, the survivors ranged from 100% (4 litters) to 0% (1 litter), although piglets from the litter with a 0% survival rate could possibly have died from starvation due to agalactia caused by secondary infection of the gilt with TGEV.",

Resistance to infection and passive protection were probably due to the fact that these gilts produced and transmitted to their suckling piglets the highest levels of protective antibody. The other six PRCV-vaccinated gilts were infected with TGEV, as shown by increased SN titers following challenge. Two of the vaccinated gilts had soft stools following challenge and a third had a pronounced but transient diarrhea. Thus, gilts vaccinated with the U.S. strain of PRCV were not completely protected against TGEV. Similar observations were made by Hooyberghs et al. ( 1988 ) in Belgium where TGEV outbreaks occurred in swine herds that were naturally exposed to the European isolate of PRCV.",

The lack of correlation between these parameters was reported previously for PRCV (Bernard et al., 1989) and has been recognized as a consistent feature of TGEV vaccination and challenge experiments (Saif and Wesley, 1992) . This suggests that the immunodominant neutralizing epitopes for PRCV and TGEV are probably not the major contributors to passive protection. Our results also show that the initial PRCV dose, in the range of 108-2 \u00d7 109 PFU, did not correlate with the magnitude of the primary immune response. Thus, the degree to which PRCV replicates in the respiratory tract and induces immunity is probably more dependent on host factors and the virus strain rather than on the initial virus dose. The second booster dose did not increase the humoral immune response, but the third dose did (P= 0.0001 ), presumably due to the emulsification with adjuvant and the IM route. This increase in immunity from the third dose by the IM route may explain why antibody against the U.S. PRCV protected piglets better than previously reported resuits with sows exposed to European PRCV isolates.",

In studies by Paton and Brown (1990) and by De Diego et al. (1992) , seronegative sows were experimentally infected with either a low or high dose of PRCV, respectively. In both instances, following two oronasal exposures to PRCV, the serum and colostrum VN titers were approximately I 0-fold less than we report here following infection with the U.S. PRCV. Paton and Brown (1990) , using a challenge TGEV of low virulence, concluded that PRCV-vaccinated sows transmitted no passive protection to their nursing piglets, whereas De Diego et al. ( 1992 ) protected 47% (7/15 ) of the piglets from two PRCV-vaccinated sows. Bernard et al. (1989) also tested passive protection against TGEV in sows naturally infected with PRCV. Serum titers in these sows were also low because of the > 1 year time interval since exposure to PRCV. With these naturally infected sows and using a virulent challenge virus, Bernard et al. (1989) protected 56% of the piglets. The survival rate among these litters was highly variable; two sows protected all piglets in their litters and two sows did not protect any of their piglets. Our results support the observations of Bernard et al. (1989) and De Diego et al. (1992) and show that there is a link between respiratory infection with PRCV and secreted protective antibody in the mammary glands of post-parturient gilts. Since the serum and colostral VN titers are lower following vaccination with European isolates, it is possible that the European PRCVs could have lower infectivity for sows and gilts than the U.S. PRCV isolate.",
