Organizations, when acquiring or planning biosurveillance systems, take into account the considerable financial resources required to develop, use, and maintain such systems, as well as the feasibility and costs of recruiting and retaining capable personnel. Organizations consider the effects of false alarms, which result in the unnecessary mobilization of multiple resources. False alarms can be expensive and in the extreme case may lead to a boy-who-cried-wolf effect in which users of a system begin to ignore a system either partially or completely. Without a proper understanding of the tradeoffs between action and inaction discussed in the previous two chapters, users of a biosurveillance system may also under-react or delay response to early warning signs of an outbreak, potentially resulting in higher levels of injury, loss of life, and damage to the psychology, operations, and infrastructure of the affected region.",

In particular, economic studies of such decisions make explicit the choices available in each situation and the potential costs and rewards of each choice. Economic studies can provide guidance to organizations about how much and where to invest in biosurveillance and what level and type of biosurveillance to develop and maintain. They can provide guidance about whether to develop and configure a biosurveillance system that can catch subtle early warning signs but potentially generate many false alarms, or one that only looks for very suspicious warning signs but may miss insidious cases.",

For example, people in densely populated areas that are vulnerable to bioterrorist attacks may benefit more from biosurveillance than would people in remote rural areas who are less likely to experience such attacks. If the residents in both areas have to pay the same amount of taxes (i.e., shoulder equal burdens of paying for the biosurveillance system), the rural residents may be less interested in such a system. Every economic study should state clearly its perspective: whether it is taking the perspective of an individual, a particular institution or organization, a government body, or society in general. As you might imagine, changing the perspective of a study can drastically alter its composition and results. For any given decision situation, the optimal decision for one individual or organization may differ from that for another individual or organization. The perspective of the economic study should match that of the decision maker.",

Each type of study has strengths and limitations and differs in feasibility. Retrospective studies are useful, because the past often repeats itself or helps predict the future. However, current and future situations may not mirror the past, and reconstructing past events can be difficult, especially without accurate and comprehensive data. Prospective studies, which involve collecting data while natural or created situations occur, give an analyst much more control over the situations and the information collected. However, prospective studies can be difficult and expensive to perform and only generate results representing specific situations. In the case of outbreaks, prospective studies may be nearly impossible, because the onset and timing of events are unpredictable and creating such an event would be unethical (and quite damaging to one's career). A limitation shared by both retrospective and prospective studies is that the studies are only feasible if the event has occurred or is likely to occur. Predictive studies overcome this limitation because the analyst builds a mathematical model or computer simulation of hypothetical situations. Because most outbreaks are uncommon and many types have never occurred, many biosurveillance-related economic analyses are at least partially predictive. A predictive analysis is always feasible. Moreover, it provides the analyst more flexibility in manipulating the situation that is being modeled to produce insights about a range of potential situations. The key limitation of a predictive study is that it rests on many modeling assumptions.",

For example, in deciding whether to administer a certain vaccine, retrospective study of previous outbreaks and experience with vaccination programs can provide important quantitative data for a predictive economic model. Performing a prospective study, such as vaccinating a small representative sample of the population and tracking the ensuing costs and rewards, can provide additional estimates that facilitate projections about what would happen if a strategy was applied on a larger scale (e.g., the entire population). Retrospective and prospective analyses often provide data for a predictive analysis, such as a computer model of different potential outbreaks and the effects of vaccination programs.",

For example, a study that only measures costs up to one month after a bioterrorist attack may seriously underestimate the impact of that attack because diseases and injuries can have long-term effects. Conversely, if the study attempted to measure the economic impact of that event 300 years into the future, it would clearly run aground on the banks of infeasibility, owing to the many uncertainties whose cumulative effect would be impossible to model. Analysts frequently face a tension between the benefit of increased fidelity from extending the time horizon of an economic study and the difficulty in constructing the model. The ideal balance between the two is often obvious from the specifics of the problem being modeled; nevertheless, it is the rule rather than the exception that economic modelers revise the time horizon as they develop a study.",

Therefore, you must carefully account for every person and organization that may be reasonably involved and affected by an event. For example, a single successful small-scale bioterrorist contamination of a commercial building can lead to many direct costs, including the cost of diagnosing and treating the victims and the cost of decontaminating the building. However, it can also entail indirect costs to the company or companies occupying the building, including lost worker productivity, the cost of finding replacement employees, and damage to the company's reputation and worker morale.

Moreover, bills may not break down the charges to the level of detail needed. For example, an emergency department visit charge may aggregate many components (e.g., placing an intravenous line, transporting the patient to different locations) of the visit but not identify what fraction of the charge is associated with each component.

For example, if an anthrax attack resulted in a patient staying 30 days in the hospital, then multiplying the cost of a hospital day by 30 could estimate the per-hospitalized-patient cost of the attack.

The earliest economic studies expressed all benefit in purely monetary terms, converting all potential benefits of an intervention into dollars, pounds, yen, francs, etc. However, researchers soon found that they could not easily express all benefits in monetary terms. For example, they could not use monetary terms to capture completely the value of saving a life (e.g., a person contributes to society in many nonmonetary ways, such as providing emotional and psychological support to friends and families), so researchers began using \"life-years saved\" as a reward for some interventions. However, life-years saved could not adequately represent the benefits of some quality-of-life-improving interventions (e.g., pain medications, walking devices) that do not save lives or the suffering caused by non-life-threatening diseases. As a result, researchers developed quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as a health status measure, with one QALY representing a year of perfect health and less than one QALY representing a year of impaired health. Researchers also have developed and used many other reward measures specific to particular classes of interventions, such as the number of bypass operations prevented to measure the success of cardiac medications.",

If the ICER is positive, then the magnitude of the ICER matters. If for instance, the ICER is $10 per life year saved, then choosing strategy B requires only $10 more for each life year saved. Most, except for the most penurious, would view this as a worthwhile investment and choose B. However, if the ICER were $100,000 per life year saved, then decision makers would have to debate over whether this reward is worth the investment.

In each case, understanding of the above principles of economic analysis will help a reader (a consumer of these published studies) to catch more subtle implications from the study. Rather than accept or reject a final conclusion, one should fully discern the set of steps that led to that conclusion. Even if the results are not applicable to a decision maker's specific situation, components of the analysis may be. In fact, many times the greatest value of a study is not in the answers it provides, but instead in the questions that it raises. A study such as the boil-water CBA in Chapter 29 may focus decision makers on the key parameters or the crux of the matter. Economic studies may identify the need for additional future studies. In addition, there may be multiple approaches in dealing with a given decision or problem. Therefore, for each issue, although the selected examples offer important teaching points, they are not necessarily the best or most definitive studies. Corso et al. (2003) conducted a retrospective cost-of-illness study of the 1993 Milwaukee Cryptosporidium outbreak. This study is a good example of a study that used multiple disparate sources to profile the economic impact of an outbreak. The analysts conducted a telephone survey of a random sample of Milwaukee residents to estimate the total number of people affected by the outbreak, the percentages who sought different levels of medical care, the length of illness for those who did not seek medical care, and the total number of work days missed. The investigators also selected a representative sample of patients who sought medical care and reviewed each patient's medical chart to determine the medical resources (e.g., medications, diagnostic tests, emergency medical services) each patient consumed. They then used billing records to obtain the associated hospital charges. They used the Wisconsin 1993 average urban hospital and emergency department cost-to-charge ratios (0.70 and 0.67, respectively) to convert charges to costs.",

One implication of these studies for biosurveillance economic analyses is that any cost-of-illness study that fails to include productivity losses may seriously underestimate the potential impact of an outbreak. Outbreaks can be devastating to not only the health care system and directly affected individuals but also many businesses and the economy. This result, if further developed, may perhaps persuade individuals and organizations initially uninterested in biosurveillance to reconsider their stance. In fact, the Milwaukee study actually underestimated productivity costs by not accounting for the lost lifetime productivity of those who died from the outbreak, the degree to which the outbreak diverted companies and the government from daily normal operations, and the damage the outbreak had on consumer and public confidence.",

Early action can lead to effective containment of a threat, and prompt measures can minimize disruptions in government and business operations. Many treatment options are only effective very early in an outbreak. Because biological agents used by terrorists would be expected to kill quickly, a tardy response can result in substantial morbidity and mortality. A predictive CBA, such as Kaufmann, Meltzer and Schmid's simulation of three types of bioterrorist attacks (with Bacillus anthracis, Brucella melitensis, and Francisella tularensis) over a major city suburb of 100,000 people, can help quantify the cost of such delays.",

Then, data from the few previous outbreaks of these agents helped forecast how soon patients would develop symptoms and die after exposure. Next, extrapolations from published laboratory and clinical experimental data supplied the clinical efficacy of administering different antibiotic interventions to the exposed population. The investigators also postulated that 90% of the exposed population would participate in the treatments.",

Previous clinical studies furnished the risk of each outcome for each age and risk category (high risk versus not high risk for contracting influenza). Age-and sex-weighted average wage data helped estimate lost productivity for each outcome. As before, the economic cost of a death was equal to the present value of how much the victim would have earned in his or her remaining lifetime. By use of this procedure, the investigators estimated that without large-scale immunization, an influenza epidemic would cost somewhere between $71.3 billion and $166.5 billion.

For example, the CUA by Khan et al. (2005) compared different response strategies to a hypothetical SARS outbreak in New York City. Because SARS can be very difficult to distinguish from other illnesses (e.g., caused by influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, Bordetella pertussis, Legionella pneumophilia) that cause respiratory symptoms and fever, i.e., febrile respiratory illnesses (FRI), the investigators wanted to see the value of home isolation versus testing (for SARS or other common diseases) of patients with FRI. Their analysis included a variety of costs (such as transportation, laboratory tests, influenza vaccination, antimicrobial agents, hospitalization, public health investigation, and patient time) and used the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI) to estimate the changes in health-related quality of life from different situations such as home isolation. The study revealed that using a test (multiplex polymerase chain reaction [PCR] assays) to diagnose other common respiratory infections 1 would save $79 million and 8,474 quality-adjusted life-years over home isolation. 1 Adding SARS testing to the multiplex PCR assays would actually cost $87 million more and decrease utility. The explanation for this less-testing-is-better result is that causes of FRIs other than SARS are much more common than is SARS; therefore, SARS testing would generate false positives, resulting in more patients without SARS erroneously isolated. This study is an excellent example of how additional information provided by testing could actually be suboptimal.",

The investigators created a hypothetical cohort of a large metropolitan population with a similar age and sex distribution to New York City and obtained costs, probabilities, and rewards from a variety of sources, including the published literature, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data, and the 1998 Statistical Abstract of the United States. The analyses showed that administering vaccine and antibiotics offered more utility (21.36 QALYs) and cost less ($46,099) than did the other three postattack strategies. Of the two preattack strategies, no vaccination was less expensive and resulted in higher QALYs gained per person when the annual risk for attack was 1% and during an attack 10% of the population was infected. However, sensitivity analyses revealed an interesting finding: if the probability of an individual being exposed (i.e., the risk for an attack multiplied by the probability of exposure given an attack) is less than one in 200, then the ICER drops below $50,000 per QALY. In health economics, an ICER of $50,000 per QALY is often used as an arbitrary threshold, as researchers consider anything below this threshold costeffective. These findings imply that probability of exposure is pivotal in deciding whether to mass vaccinate a population preemptively, another important implication for biosurveillance.",
