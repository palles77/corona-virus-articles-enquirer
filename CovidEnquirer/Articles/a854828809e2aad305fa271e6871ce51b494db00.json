            "text": "Large-scale feline cruelty cases typically arise from investigations involving individual hoarders, rescue organizations, sanctuaries, or breeders. These cases involve the crime scene, animal processing at the scene and temporary shelter, animal removal and transport, sheltering, and final animal disposition. The veterinarian plays a role in the planning of the operation, at the crime scene, the temporary shelter, and the hospital receiving cats for more advanced treatment. The clinical management of these cases is different from traditional shelter medicine or feline practice. To act and respond appropriately, the veterinarian must have an understanding of all aspects of the operation. These are legal cases requiring certain types of documentation and procedures. The organization of the entire operation should be conducted similar to disaster response using the Incident Command Systemwhere the medical management on scene and at the temporary shelter is incorporated into this reporting structure with direct communication to the lead investigator. 1 Extensive planning is needed, anticipating the number of cats, age ranges, known or likely medical issues, and socialization status. Decisions must be made considering practicality, stress on the animals, costs, resources, future animal placement, and any legal impact. The goal is a successful outcome for the individual cat and the criminal case.",

In addition, this system serves to establish the examination sequence. The assignment of color categories may vary with each case based on the availability of the color devices used (Table 69-2) . Colored duct tape is easily used and readily purchased at home improvement, hardware, office supply, and general merchandise stores. Colored flagging tape may also be used but poses a risk of animal ingestion and can be difficult to remove from transport carriers or cages. A piece of the appropriate colored duct tape is placed on the animal identification (ID) label located on the transport carrier or cage; some animals may have more than one color assigned (Figure 69-1) . The primary use of the color system is at the scene, but some colors may continue to be used within the sheltering system. The color system and their assigned categories should be posted at the scene, within each forensic examination area, and at multiple areas within the shelter.",

Every consideration should be made to minimize stress during removal, transport, sheltering, and examination of the cats. Physical handling of the cats and change of environment are additional but necessary stressors in these cases that carry a risk of exacerbating any pre-existing medical conditions. It is not unusual for these large groups of cats to be subclinical disease carriers that have reached a state of homeostasis that when disrupted results in new outbreaks. In addition, many of these cases involve animals that lack proper socialization and/or have been under severe emotional stress. They may exhibit aggression (due to fear or pain), or they may be completely unable to interact. Some cats may exhibit subtle behavioral clues of extreme distress. It is the initial handling at the scene that can set the animal up for success or failure more so than any setbacks that may occur during examination or sheltering.",

It is important to recognize that these cats may have reactions to novel stimuli different from those raised as pets in private homes.

These separations are often based on infectious diseases, zoonotic diseases, critical medical observation, bite quarantine, reproductive status, and special needs (such as those cats that are difficult to handle, pregnant, neonates, or nursing). Decisions for separate housing areas must be done with consideration of the crime scene assessment. Most of these cases involve cats that have previously been exposed to each other either through housing design or fomite transmission; therefore, separation based on infectious disease is neither necessary nor recommended. In large open shelters, separate areas can be created by hanging tarps or clear plastic sheets that are open at the ceiling for airflow. Other considerations for housing of cats include lighting, number of separate rooms, secure areas, and airflow. Cats are more stressed when at ground level, so every effort should be made to elevate the housing. 3",

It is important to have the veterinarian's input on the initial design and any adjustments made based on the crime scene assessment or forensic examinations. The shelter should be designed to be flexible based on changing medical or behavioral conditions of the animals. Shelter design should take into account the number of cats, special housing needs, ease of handling, infectious disease, temperature control, airflow, foot traffic, noise levels, animal stress, and environmental enrichment. Continued assessment and reassessment of cat behavior and temperament should be conducted, with changes made to address any issues noted.

Often these cases involve group housing or free-roaming shelter settings, and the temporary shelter results in isolation of cats into individual cages. Although this can be another stressor on the cats, it can be offset (at least for the short term) by the positive change to a sanitary environment and the elimination of competition for resources of space, litter, food, and water. Cats should be paired or group-housed whenever possible and practical to reduce stress. Shy or feral cats are often less stressed when paired with another cat. Wire cages are especially amenable to alteration, creating a \"double-wide\" space for this purpose. Environmental enrichment is important to incorporate into the sheltering design and protocols. This includes soft bedding, boxes, or small carriers to hide in, toys, treats, and catnip. It is critical to offer canned food, especially for cats with upper respiratory or dental disease, to assess and stimulate appetite, and for further enrichment. It is important to minimize changing of bedding and other items within the cages, which can create additional stress. 3 The use of synthetic pheromones (e.g., Feliway, Ceva Animal Health) may be effective in stress reduction when sprayed on bedding and through the use of plug-in diffusers. 4 addition, the veterinary teams should use consistent terminology and abbreviations, which may be posted in the exam areas. Breed descriptions should be done carefully. Unless the breed is known, it is often best to use \"breed-type\" or predominant \"breed-mix.\" The body condition score (BCS) to be used should be posted in each examination area so that the veterinarians can refer to it. The age or estimated age of a cat should only be documented if supported by examination findings, such as dentition or ocular changes. It is preferable to use designations of neonatal, juvenile, adult, or geriatric with documentation of the basis for the determination. After the examination is complete, a check mark should be placed on the animal's ID marker to create a visual indication that the animal has been examined. Any color-coded markers should be assessed and removed or changed based on the examination; those that may impact shelter operations should be communicated to the shelter manager.",

Fecal testing is not necessary unless there is unresolved diarrhea after deworming, or it is otherwise dictated based on clinical illness. Coccidiosis is a common finding in large-scale cat cruelty cases; it is found in up to 23% of cats with diarrhea and 33% of clinically healthy cats. 9 Based on observed diarrhea findings at the scene, within the temporary shelter, or diagnostic test results, it may be reasonable to treat all cats for coccidiosis. Ponazuril is an effective treatment for coccidiosis and is easily administered to large numbers of cats, given orally once daily at 15 to 30 mg/kg for 1 to 3 days and repeated if necessary in 1 week. 3, 10 The stressors the cats have been exposed to along with dietary changes at the temporary shelter can contribute to diarrhea. In addition, many cats from these cases may harbor other enteropathogens, such as Tritrichomonas, Giardia, or Cryptosporidium species, as well as feline enteric coronavirus, which may or may not be a cause of refractory diarrhea. 9, 11 Any additional testing and interpretation should be conducted as discussed later in this chapter.",

For each test considered, both the test itself and the action to be taken based on its result must be appropriate and reasonable. In a large-scale case, tests that may be recommended or conducted in private or shelter medicine practice may not be appropriate or reasonable. The goal is not to cure all animals and eliminate all pathogens prior to the cat leaving the temporary shelter, rather it is to immediately identify and address any important medical issues, improve overall physical and mental health, and address any obvious zoonotic issues. This should be a clear and constant guidepost for decisions made. It cannot and should not be the expectation to test and treat for everything.

In addition to fleas and associated dermatitis, there may be other external parasites, such as Cheyletiella, lice, and demodectic or sarcoptic mange.

Less commonly, cases of Streptococcus canis have been reported in intensively housed cats, often manifesting with skin ulceration and necrotizing fasciitis (Figure 69-7) . 15 Dermatophytosis may be seen in some cats but rarely is a widespread issue within the population. Cats may be mechanical carriers and never develop clinical lesions themselves; such cats are seldom clinically relevant to the case, the individual animals, or the general population. For these reasons, dermatophyte testing is not routinely recommended on intake of cats or for those without dermatologic lesions. Rather, the focus should be on diagnosing and treating cats with suspicious lesions and enacting precautions for handling and cleaning. Housing placement within the shelter for cats suspected or diagnosed with dermatophytosis should be based on the considerations previously discussed.

Loss of hair occurs due to anagen and/or telogen defluxion. In the anagen or growth phase of the hair cycle, there can be loss and/or abnormal growth of hair, resulting in broken hair shafts. With telogen defluxion, there is widespread loss of hair in the quiescent phase of the hair cycle due to large numbers of hair follicles being synchronized in this phase. Loss of normal hair color and hair keratinization abnormalities can occur.
