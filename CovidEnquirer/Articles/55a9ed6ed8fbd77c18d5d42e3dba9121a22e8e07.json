            "text": "Newcastle disease virus (NDV) are both important viruses seriously affecting poultry industry worldwide. In this study, reverse-transcription LAMP (RT-LAMP) was combined with lateral flow dipstick (LFD) forming a novel detection tool which could simultaneously detect IBV and NDV visually. Primers targeted the 5 -untranslated region (5 -UTR) of IBV genome and the conserved region of NDV large polymerase gene (LP). The specificity and sensitivity of this multiple reverse transcription-LAMP-LFD (mRT-LAMP-LFD) assay were compared with those of conventional RT-PCR, nested RT-PCR (nRT-PCR), quantification RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), and RT-LAMP monitored by electrophoresis. No non-specific amplifications were observed when the assays were tested with unrelated viruses. According to the sensitivity study, when detecting IBV or NDV alone, the lowest detection limits of mRT-LAMP-LFD were 10 0.8 IBV RNA copies/reaction and 10 0.7 NDV RNA copies/reaction. Furthermore, when detecting IBV and NDV simultaneously, the lowest detection limit was the same as that of the single detection assays. In the clinical sample study, mRT-LAMP-LFD performed the best among these assays. When tested with IBV or NDV single infected samples, the mean detection rates were 98.65% and 97.25%, respectively. In the IBV and NDV co-infected sample study, the mean detection rates of IBV and NDV were both 95%. This study showed that mRT-LAMP-LFD was a promising qualitative detection tool suitable for field single or multiple IBV and NDV detection.",

            "text": "A wide variety of diagnostic assays for IBV and NDV have been developed, including virus isolation, and serological and molecular assays (Bande et al., 2016; Brown and Bevins, 2017) . Costs, requirements of stringent techniques, and time required limit the use of virus isolation as a routine virus detection assay (Bande et al., 2016) . Serological assays, such as hemagglutination inhibition and ELISA, are faster and simpler than virus isolation, but tend to lack specificity and sensitivity, especially in the case of IBV, and poor crossreactions between serotypes makes serological tests less applicable (Cavanagh, 2007; Miller et al., 2010) . In view of their high sensitivity, specificity, and reduced flow time, molecular assays are the most commonly used 5401 methods for IBV and NDV monitoring. According to previous studies, both IBV and NDV quantification RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) detection methods were highly specific, and the lowest detection limits were 10 2 -10 4 genome copies indicating that these qRT-PCR methods were highly sensitive (Callison et al., 2006; Farkas et al., 2009; Wise et al., 2004) . Another highly specific and sensitive molecular method is nested RT-PCR (nRT-PCR) which involves 2 rounds of PCR amplifications. As previously reported, the lowest detection limits of IBV and NDV nRT-PCR assays were 10 1.9 and 10 4.0 EID 50 /mL, respectively (Nguyen et al., 2013) . While PCR assays are widely applied in pathogen detection, the conduct of PCR requires sophisticated laboratory equipment and observation of PCR product requires electrophoresis, making PCR assays unsuitable for point-of-care and visible detections, especially in some low-resource regions.",

            "text": "Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) amplifies DNA under isothermal conditions by the Bst DNA polymerase large fragment (Notomi et al., 2000) . Numerous studies have demonstrated that the amplification efficiency of LAMP is quite high (Khan et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2014) . Moreover, the specificity of LAMP is also satisfactory as there are 4 specially designed primers recognizing 6 distinct regions on the target DNA (Asiello and Baeumner, 2011; Zhang et al., 2014) . Furthermore, unlike conventional PCR assays, only simple devices are needed during LAMP, such as a water bath or a heat block. LAMP is thought to revolutionize molecular biology not only because of its excellent performance on DNA amplification but also due to its diverse, simple, and intuitional reaction monitoring methods. Several naked eye monitoring approaches have been applied, such as adding color indicators into reactions and combining with immunochromatographic techniques (Parida et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2014) . Lateral flow dipstick (LFD), an immunochromatographic technique, utilizes antibody capture followed by secondary antibody labeling (Chen et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2014) . LAMP combined with LFD (LAMP-LFD) could be used for highly sensitive, simple, visual, and multiple pathogen detections (Chen et al., 2016) . LAMP products can be labeled by employing biotin/FITC modified FIP/BIP primers, and subsequently, these biotin-FITC double labeled LAMP products can be captured by biotin-antibodies and immobilized at specific locations on LFD strips (test line). Subsequently, FITC at the other end of the products can specifically combine with gold particles labeled with FITC-antibodies, thus making the results readable using the naked eye (Nimitphak et al., 2008) . However, no previous studies have reported multiple detection of avian pathogens using LAMP-LFD.",

Studies have shown that multiple conventional RT-PCR could be used for detecting and differentiating respiratory dis-ease pathogens in poultry diseases (Pang et al., 2002; Rashid et al., 2009) . However, the sensitivity of multiple conventional RT-PCR is not satisfactory. Multiple nested RT-PCR is much more sensitive than multiple conventional RT-PCR but time-consuming (Nguyen et al., 2013) . Furthermore, these assays are not suitable for on-site pathogen detection, because products of RT-PCR need to be monitored by electrophoresis and qRT-PCR need to be conducted with highly accurate instruments. Here, we developed a visual multiple RT-LAMP-LFD (mRT-LAMP-LFD) assay which could simultaneously detect IBV and NDV and be easily carried out and monitored by the naked eye. To evaluate this novel detection method, PCR assays (including conventional RT-PCR, qRT-PCR and nRT-PCR) and reverse-transcription LAMP (RT-LAMP) monitored by electrophoresis were also conducted and the specificity and sensitivity of the assays were compared with those of the mRT-LAMP-LFD assay.",

Furthermore, IBV and NDV produce clinical picture somewhat resembling each other, it is very much crucial not only to detect but also differentiate simultaneously. Existing IBV and NDV diagnostic methods, including virus isolation and PCR assays, are specific and sensitive. However, they are not suitable for timely onsite pathogen detection. Although portable PCR machines are gradually applied in the field, in most areas, especially in undeveloped and developing countries, these sophisticated equipments are too expensive to be popularized, and the sensitivity of PCR is not satisfactory. Multiple RT-LAMP-LFD developed in this study could detect and differentiate IBV and NDV, both simultaneously and accurately. When IBV and NDV cDNA co-exist in the same reaction system, an IBV and NDV double-positive result was observed. To evaluate the sensitivity of mRT-LAMP-LFD, conventional RT-PCR, nRT-PCR, qRT-PCR, and RT-LAMP assays detecting IBV or NDV alone were also conducted to compare with mRT-LAMP-LFD. When detecting IBV or NDV alone, mRT-LAMP-LFD performed as sensitive as nRT-PCR and RT-LAMP did, in a directly visual way. It is always thought that qRT-PCR methods provided high sensitivity during pathogen diagnoses. According to the result of detection limit study, nRT-PCR, and LAMP assays, established in this study, possessed 10 times higher sensitivity than qRT-PCR. In the first round of amplification of nRT-PCR, the original template was amplified with the outer primers. Thus, the number of the fragments containing the inner primer target sequence is greatly improved compared with the original template. As a result, the number of templates in the second round of amplification of nRT-PCR is much higher than that in qRT-PCR. This is the reason why nRT-PCR could detect lower concentration of original templates than qRT-PCR do. Similarly to our results, previous study conducted by Weng and Chen indicated that nPCR showed higher sensitivity than real-time PCR when detecting Phytophthora infestans (Khan et al., 2017) . LAMP is one of the most widely used isothermal nucleic acid amplification techniques (INATs) . Several studies on the diagnostic methods of other pathogens had showed that these INATs possessed equal or even higher sensitivities compared with qPCR assays (Gao et al., 2018; Khan et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2015) . Our results indicated that LAMP assays possessed higher sensitivities than qPCR when detecting IBV and NDV ( Figure 5 ).",

Previous studies on PCR methods detecting IBV and NDV showed that these PCR methods are specific and sensitive, but the need for expensive thermal cycling equipments makes them not suitable for on-site IBV and NDV detection. Portable PCR machines are gradually applied in the field. While, in most areas, especially in undeveloped and developing countries, these sophisticated To further evaluate mRT-LAMP-LFD, 10 chickens were experimentally co-infected with IBV and NDV. The mean detection rates of the assays, when detecting different kinds of samples, are labeled above the histograms. The fraction numbers under the X-axis represent (positive sample numbers detected by the assays)/(total sample numbers). * indicate P < 0.05. equipments are too expensive to be popularized. Thus, simpler and visible IBV and NDV detecting methods are urgently needed. High specific and sensitive single IBV and NDV RT-LAMP assays have been developed in previous studies (Chen et al., 2010; Pham et al., 2005) . In these assays, products were visualized by electrophoresis or by adding color indicators. When detecting multiple pathogens, the products must be easily differentiated. When visualized by electrophoresis, LAMP products could be distinguished by observing bands with different molecular weights, however, this method is not suitable for on-site pathogen detection. By adding color indicators, the change in color could be easily observed, but this change is non-specific. Obviously, these two LAMP monitoring methods are not applicable for on-site multiple pathogens detection. Multiple LAMP-LFD has been applied in the detection of some pathogens, and it showed great advances compared with common PCR and LAMP assays, such as the requirement for little equipment, short reaction time, and the ability to detect multiple genes or pathogens (Chen et al., 2016; Lalle et al., 2018) . To our knowledge, RT-LAMP-LFD has not been applied to IBV or NDV detection and no studies on an mRT-LAMP-LFD technique that detects multiple avian respiratory viruses have been reported. In this study, the products generated in IBV and NDV RT-LAMP were differentiated by Biotin/FITC and Digoxigenin/FITC labeling, respectively. The products could bind with Biotin-or Digoxigenin-antibodies fixed on different test lines on the LFD strip, and then products were visualized by combining with gold particles modified with FITC-antibodies (Figure 1 ). When tested with clinical samples, the mean detection rate of mRT-LAMP-LFD was higher than that of the other assays. These results indicate that mRT-LAMP-LFD is not only able to detect IBV and NDV simultaneously, but is also suitable for field testing in both technical (more sensitive than PCR and LAMP assays) and practical aspects (more simple to put out and no specialized equipment needed).",
