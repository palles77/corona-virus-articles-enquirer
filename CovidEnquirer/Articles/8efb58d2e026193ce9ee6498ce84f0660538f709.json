Cytoskeletal elements that interact with vesicles to prevent movement are believed to be quite different from the microtubule-based components, which generate movement. What cytoskeletal elements are present at the active zone? Although the high quality immunoelectron microscopy that would help answer this question is not yet available, a role for actin seems plausible. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy have provided some evidence for F-actin, ankyrin, and fodrin in electroplax nerve terminals (Walker et al., 1985; Kordeli et al., 1986 ) but have not provided information about their exact location. Rare F-actin filaments can be seen in quick-freeze, deep-etch preparations of neuromuscular junctions (Hirokawa and Heuser, '1982) . Sparse actin labeling can be seen by immunoelectron microscopy of nerve terminals on dendritic spines (Cohen et al., 1985) . One protein that may be important in vesicle anchoring is synapsin I. Since synapsin I is known to have an actinbundling capacity (Bahler and Greengard, 1987; Petrucci and Morrow, 1987) , it may link the synaptic vesicle to the cytoskeleton by binding to vesicle proteins or lipid (Benfenati et al., 1987, Sot. Neurosci., abstract) . In endocrine cells, secetory granules are anchored to the plasma membrane prior to release by an interaction thought to involve an actin-fodrin subplasmalemrnal cytoskeleton (for review see Burgess and Kelly, 1987) .",

The docking proteins must be constrained similarly. Molecular bridges of the type predicted here have been described in cell-cell contacts between nonneuronal cells. The crucial finding in nonneuronal cells is that when cell-cell contact occurs, molecular bridges linking the cytoskeleton of one cell to that of another form (zonulae adherens and desmosomes). Such contacts and the analogous specialized attachments to the extracellular matrix (focal contacts and hemi-desmosomes) are relatively well described. A characteristic of focal contacts, but not zonulae adherens, is the presence of the cytoskeletal protein talin. The finding of talin at nerve muscle synapses (Sealock et al., 1985) strengthens the parallel between neuronal and nonneuronal cell contacts and suggests that the neuromuscular junction has homologies to focal junctions rather than zonulae adherens. At focal contacts, actin cytoskeletons are anchored to extracellular matrix. A homology between focal contacts and the neuromuscular junction makes sense in light of the considerable evidence that regenerating nerve terminals recognize the extracellular matrix of muscle (for review see Burden, 1987) .",

There seems little support, therefore, for the once popular idea that osmotic swelling of the vesicle causes the fusion event. The second exciting development is the use of conductance and admittance measurements to estimate the size of the channel that forms when the mast cell granule membrane first fuses with the plasma membrane. The channel is estimated to have the conductance of a gap junction and may show flickering (Breckenridge and Almers, 1987b).

From the endosome three destinations are possible: a return to the plasma membrane, delivery to the lysosome, or transfer to the Golgi region. In nonneuronal cells, the latter route is thought to be a minor one. (8) In endocrine cells, recycling of the secretory granule membrane requires a massive membrane flow back to the Colgi region.

But how appropriate is it to assume that information on dense core granule fusion is pertinent to synaptic vesicle fusion? The dense core granule is formed in the cell body and releases protein at sites that need not coincide with the sites of synaptic vesicle fusion (e.g., Zhu et al., 1986) . However, the presence of three synaptic vesicle membrane proteins in endocrine secretory granules argues in favor of some similarity in mechanism, as does the similar membrane composition of dense and light vesicles of sympathetic nerves (for review see Winkler et al., 1987) . The similarity in the two vesicle types has led to the frequent speculation that synaptic vesicles arise by endocytosis of dense core granule membranes (Winkler et al., 1987; Lowe et al., 1988) . If this is true, the remarkable enrichment of vesicle proteins in small vesicles of endocrine and neuroendocrine cells (Navone et al., 1986) implies that the endocytotic mechanism must concentrate proteins of the secretory granule membrane . The evidence for different sites of exocytosis (Zhu et al., 1986) and different responses of dense core and low density synaptic vesicles to stimulation (for review see Burgess and Kelly, 1987) is also consistent with an alternative hypothesis (Navone et al., 1986 )-that there are two separate and independent regulatory pathways in neurons. At present, the idea that synaptic vesicles are generated independently of dense core vesicles is as tenable as the idea that they are generated from them. Even comparison with nonneuronal cells does not help. For instance, the correct analogy in nonneuronal cells to neurotrans-mitter release could be the regulated recycling of the proton pump (Schwartz and Al-Awqati, 1985) and not the regulated secretion hormones.",

However, when HRP is coupled to wheat germ agglutinin (Gonatas et al., 1984; Broadwell and Balin, 1985) or when wheat germ agglutinin is used alone (Rhodes et al., 1986) , the Golgi apparatus becomes labeled.

Such a lifetime is not inconsistent with measurements in nonneuronal cells. A question that perplexes a cell biologist examining synaptic vesicle recycling is whether or not an endosome is involved as an intermediate compartment (Figure 3C) . HRP-labeled endosomes can clearly be seen (e.g., Siegel and Brownell, 1986) , but there is no direct evidence that they are involved in recycling synaptic vesicle membranes. It has been reported that stimulation increases cisternal organelles (Wiley et al., 1987; Brewer and Lynch, 1986) and that it does not (Torri-Tarelli et al., 1987) . The conservative cell biologist might insist on the simplifying assumption that all membrane recycling goes through endosomes. On the other hand, the similarity in size between the vesicle membrane inside a coated vesicle and the synaptic vesicle makes it feasible that the nerve terminal cuts out the endosomal middleman and merely uncoats a coated vesicle to generate synaptic vesicle. Hopefully antibodies to synaptic vesicle proteins will soon resolve this issue.",

            "text": "The presence of synaptic vesicle antigens in endocrine secretory cells and of dense core granules in neurons suggests a model in which the neuronal precursor, evolutionarily or developmentally, is an endocrine cell that has regulated secretion. Many nonneuronal cells can be induced to extend processes. When a permanent membrane flow is required to add membrane to growing tips. In addition, large dense core vesicles secrete their contents. The membranes are then recovered in coated pits and form endocytotic vesicles that are returned to the cell body for reuse. (6) When contact is made, cell recognition molecules accumulate in the region of contact between neuron and target. As for epithelial cells, this is suggested to produce an organization of cytoskeletal elements at the nerve terminal plasma membrane. Synaptic vesicles on this model are initially derived by endocytosis of large dense core vesicle membranes. Accumulation of synaptic vesicles upon synaptogenesis is by selective retention, via interaction with the cytoskeleton. Since the process is no longer extending, a massive retrograde transport of constitutively transported material begins (Hollenbeckand Bray, 1987) . line of endocrine cells in induced to extend long processes, the tips of the processes are packed with regulated secretory vesicles (Matsuuchi et al., 1988; Tooze and Burke, 1987) . Such cells show strong similarity to immature neurons (Buckley and Kelly, 1985) in which vesicle antigens are also found at the tips prior to synaptic contact. Large amounts of other membranous material are also transported to the tip presumably to allow process extension (Matsuuchi et al., 1988; Hollenbeck and Bray, 1987) .",

            "text": "When the immature nerve terminal makes contact with a target, there is accumulation of vesicle antigens at the contact points (Bixby and Reichardt, 1985; Burry et al., 1986) . This is likely to involve a redistribution of preexisting material since protein synthesis is not required (Burry, 1985) . The amount of material transported retrogradely increases markedly, presumably because material is no longer needed for process extension (Hollenbeck and Bray, 1987) . The two simplest explanations of how synaptic vesicle material might be redistributed extensively during synaptogenesis are that it is selectively sent to the nerve terminal or selectively retained. We cannot tell with confidence which is correct. Insight into how the reorganization might be brought about may come from considering a simpler example of cell-cell interaction, the formation of an epithelium. The basolateral plasma membrane of an epithelial cell but not the apical membrane contains the (Na+,K+)ATPase and is associated with a cortical lining of the actin, fodrin, ankyrin cytoskeleton. As with the neuron, these components are present before contact and redistribute following cell-cell contact Veshnock, 1987a, 1987b) . In this case, one of the elements causing the distribution is known. The transmembrane protein E cadherin (uvomorulin, L-CAM) allows selective association of epithelial cells, and antibodies to it block formation of the junction (Boulter et al., 1985; Gumbiner and Simons, 1986) . By analogy with these observations, synapse formation may involve cadherin-like molecules present in the immature neuron. The cytoplasmic domains of the clustered cadherin-like molecules could serve to hold in place the cytoskeletal elements that selectively retain synaptic vesicles at the nerve terminal.",
