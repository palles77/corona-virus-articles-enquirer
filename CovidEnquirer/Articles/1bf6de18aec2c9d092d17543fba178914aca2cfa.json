The goal of this study was to identify genetic features unique to KM22 by comparing the genome sequence of KM22 to the laboratory reference strain RB50. To gain a broader perspective of the genetic relationship of KM22 among other B. bronchiseptica strains, selected genes of KM22 were then compared to five other B. bronchiseptica strains isolated from different hosts. Overall, the KM22 genome sequence is more similar to the genome sequences of the strains isolated from animals than the strains isolated from humans. The majority of virulence gene expression in Bordetella is positively regulated by the two-component sensory transduction system BvgAS. bopN, bvgA, fimB, and fimC were the most highly conserved BvgAS-regulated genes present in all seven strains analyzed. In contrast, the BvgAS-regulated genes present in all seven strains with the highest sequence divergence werefimN, fim2, fhaL, andfhaS. A total of eight major fimbrial subunit genes were identified in KM22. Quantitative real-time PCR data demonstrated that seven of the eight fimbrial subunit genes identified in KM22 are expressed and regulated by BvgAS. The annotation of the KM22 genome sequence, coupled with the comparative genomic analyses reported in this study, can be used to facilitate the development of vaccines with improved efficacy towards B. bronchiseptica in swine to decrease the prevalence and disease burden caused by this pathogen.",

            "text": "The U.S. swine industry is the third largest producer of pork in the world, and respiratory disease in pigs is the most important health concern for swine producers today (U. S. Department of Agriculture, 2008) . According to the recent survey conducted by the National Animal Health Monitoring System (NAHMS), respiratory disease is on the rise and is the greatest cause of mortality in nursery and grower/finisher swine, making the development of efficacious vaccines and therapeutic interventions that can protect against these infections a top research priority (U. S. Department of Agriculture, 2008) . Bordetella bronchiseptica colonization is pervasive in swine herds and is an important contributor to respiratory disease in pigs. It is a primary cause of bronchopneumonia in young pigs, while it additionally contributes to secondary pneumonia in older pigs. It is also the primary etiologic agent of nonprogressive atrophic rhinitis, a mild to moderately severe reversible condition that promotes colonization by toxigenic strains of Pasteurella multocida and can lead to severe progressive atrophic rhinitis . In swine exhibiting pneumonia, B. bronchiseptica is often isolated in combination with other pathogens . Previous studies have demonstrated that co-infection with B. bronchiseptica increases colonization and exacerbates the severity of disease caused by both viral and bacterial pathogens, including swine influenza virus (SIV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), Haemophilus parasuis, P. multocida and Streptococcus suis .",

One of the approaches found to be highly discriminatory is multilocus sequence typing (MLST) based on comparison of DNA sequences from seven housekeeping genes (Diavatopoulos et al., 2005) . The virulent B. bronchiseptica strain KM22 was originally isolated in Hungary in 1993 from a swine herd with atrophic rhinitis. Similar to the majority of B. bronchiseptica strains isolated from pigs exhibiting disease, KM22 is sequence type (ST) 7 in Clonal Complex 1 of an MLST-based Bordetella phylogeny (Diavatopoulos et al., 2005) , and it harbors a PvuII ribotype (Register and Magyar, 1999) . Additionally, KM22 contains a pertactin repeat region variant (Register, 2001 ) that is shared with the majority of strains isolated from swine. KM22 has been successfully used by our laboratory to develop a reproducible swine respiratory disease model reflective of clinical B. bronchiseptica infections within swine herds and host-to-host transmission (Brockmeier and Register, 2007; Nicholson et al., 2009 Nicholson et al., , 2014a Nicholson et al., , 2012 .",

This  table includes the NCBI genome accession number and the  reference for the original genome publication. Assembly and annotation of the KM22 genome sequence data identified a total of 4853 predicted protein coding sequences (CDSs) (Nicholson et al., 2014b) . Upon further investigation, seven CDSs were identified as likely representing a CDS split across two contiguous sequences (contigs) such that the 5 0 end of one gene is located at the end of one contig and the 3 0 end of the same gene is located at the start of the following contig, with some portion of the middle gene sequence missing, preventing joining of the contigs. PCR primers were designed for each end of the fourteen contigs, and amplification confirmed that each predicated pair was indeed one contiguous region. Additionally, 3CDSs were identified that have sequence homology at the nucleotide and translated protein level with a single large CDS present in RB50 (BB1186) that is homologous to KM22_01212. The three CDSs in KM22 (KM22_04905, KM22_04906 and KM22_04907) each comprise small contigs and align to highly repetitive regions of the RB50 sequence that are missing in the homologous KM22CDS (KM22_01212). Therefore, we believe these three annotated CDSs in KM22 actually comprise various portions of a single gene (KM22_01212) that was not correctly assembled due to the highly repetitive nature of the DNA sequence. As a result, our revised assembly and annotation of the KM22 genome sequence resulted in 4843 unique protein coding sequences in 46 contigs ranging from 679,114 bp to 686 bp, with a total length of 5119,729 bp.",

Locally collinear blocks (LCBs) representing regions of sequence that align in each genome are illustrated as colored rectangles connected by lines. For the KM22 sequence, blocks above the center line are in the same orientation as RB50, blocks below the center line align in the inverse orientation. White areas reflect regions that are not conserved. Symbols are used to mark LCBs whose rearrangement in KM22 relative to RB50 occurs within a single contig, likely reflecting a true rearrangement. three of these regions, the rearrangement is supported by genome sequence assembly data from both strains, such that the position at which the organization changes in KM22 relative to RB50 occurs within a single contig on at least one edge of the region (Fig. 1) . The fourth rearrangement identified occurs at contig boundaries such that it is not possible to determine if a true genome rearrangement has occurred at that site or if the contig ordering is incorrect (Fig. 1) . Genome rearrangements can have profound phenotypic effects on bacterial niche adaptation by impacting gene expression or loss of gene function resulting from genes located near rearrangement breakpoints being placed under control of new transcriptional regulatory elements (Suyama and Bork, 2001) . Genome rearrangements have been previously identified in other Bordetella isolates, including B. bronchiseptica strains (Brinig et al., 2006; Park et al., 2012; Parkhill et al., 2003) .

While these major fimbrial subunit genes are unlinked on the chromosome, assembly and secretion of their protein products are mediated by the products of three genes, fimBCD, encoding the usher, the chaperone, and an adhesin, respectively (Locht et al., 1992; Willems et al., 1994) . The fimBCD locus is located between the fhaB and fhaC genes, which are required for production and secretion of filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) (Locht et al., 1992; Willems et al., 1994) . Similar to RB50, the fimBCD genes were identified in KM22 and located between the fhaB and fhaC genes. A total of eight major fimbrial subunit genes (fimA, fim2, fim3, fimN, fimX, fim2-like KM22_03370, KM22_03368, and KM22_03128) were identified in KM22 and located at unlinked positions along the chromosome. Of the chromosomal regions containing fimbrial subunit genes, we observed the greatest sequence divergence within the fimNX locus. In strain RB50, the fimNX locus contains three genes (fimbrial protein,fimN, fimX), while four genes were identified within this locus in KM22, annotated in order as KM22_03368 (fimbrial protein), KM22_03369 (fimN), KM22_03370 (fim2-like), KM22_03371 (fimX). KM22_03370 is a fimbrial subunit gene identified in KM22 and is Fig. 3 . qPCR analysis of fimbrial subunit genes. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to determine mRNA expression of fimbrial subunit genes in wild-type KM22 and the phase-locked mutants TN30 (Bvg \u00c0 ) and TN31 (Bvg i ). Gene expression relative to KM22 and standardized to 16S rRNA is plotted along the y-axis and fimbrial genes analyzed are shown along the x-axis. Data shown are averages obtained from triplicate cultures. The error bars represent AE the standard error. not present in RB50. As shown in Supplemental Fig. 3 , the gene organization present in the fimNX locus of KM22 is also present in strains 253, Bbr77 and D445.

Comparison of the Type 3 secretion system (T3SS) locus am ongst sequenced B. bronchiseptica strains Genes encoding the components of the Bordetella T3SS, including the secretion apparatus, secreted effector proteins, and putative chaperones, are located within the bsc locus (Mattoo et al., 2004) . Directly adjacent to this locus is the btr locus, which contains genes encoding the regulatory elements for T3SS (Mattoo et al., 2004) . A broad comparison of the region encompassing both loci among strains RB50, KM22, 1289 and 253 showed that overall, the region is highly conserved and over 98% identical. One difference was identified among these strains; one CDS annotated in strains RB50 (BB1639) and KM22 (KM22_01795) as a hypothetical protein is annotated as a pseudogene in strains 1289 (BN113_1619) and 253 (BN112_1817) due to a frameshift. In strain 1289 the CDS is annotated as a hypothetical protein (pseudogene) over 2 ORFs and as an unnamed gene only (no CDS annotated) in strain 253.",

Comparison of the Type 6 secretion system (T6SS) locus am ongst sequenced B. bronchiseptica strains Comparison of the T6SS locus containing 26 genes among strains KM22, RB50 and 1289 revealed that the region is highly conserved in these 3 strains ($99% identical). The only region that shows any sequence variation is one intergenic region, which differs in size in each strain. This intergenic region is located between CDSs BB0798 and BB0799 for strain RB50 and KM22_00821 and KM22_00822 for strain KM22. The overall conservation among the other strains that encode the T6SS compared to RB50 is 98% for strain 253 and 96% for strain MO149. Possible pseudogenes were identified in strains 1289 and KM22. In 1289, locus BN113_0788 is split into 2 coding regions in different reading frames, but the same CDS is full-length in strains RB50 and KM22. In KM22, two sets of possible pseudogenes were identified: M22_00819/KM22_00820 and KM22_00833/KM22_00834. These genes are full-length in strains RB50 and 1289, but the coding sequence switches reading frames in KM22. No possible pseudogenes were identified in strains RB50, MO149, and 253. Strains D445 and Bbr77, isolated from human hosts, are missing either most or the entire T6SS region.",

The O-antigen locus from the B. bronchiseptica strains evaluated here typically contains 24 genes, except for the O3 locus in MO149, which contains 15 genes (Hester et al., 2013; Park et al., 2012) . The Oantigen locus of KM22 is highly similar to that of strain 1289, with the annotated CDSs sharing between 99.7-100 percent identity and, therefore contains the genes encoding the alternative or O2antigen.",

            "text": "Given that the gene set analyzed in Fig. 2 encodes factors that influence how B. bronchiseptica strains interact with their host and/ or environment, we sought to determine how a phylogenetic tree based on this gene set would compare to the MLST-based phylogenetic tree. Therefore the phylogenetic relationship among the B. bronchiseptica strains used in our analyses was reconstructed based on single nucleotide polymorphisms in the BvgAS-regulated genes using a Maximum Likelihood method (Fig. 4) . We were intrigued by the similarity of a phylogeny based on BvgASregulated genes (Fig. 4) to one derived from MLST sequences (Supplemental Fig. 1 ). Both trees contain two distinct sublineages, one that includes all of the isolates from animal hosts (253, 1289, RB50, and KM22) and a second that includes the strains isolated from human hosts. Focusing on the phylogeny based on BvgASregulated genes (Fig. 4) , the phylogenetic separation among the strains isolated from human hosts (MO149, D445, and Bbr77) was not well resolved based on the low support from the bootstrap values indicated at the nodes; this suggests that mechanisms of diversity, such as recombination, insertions, deletions, or horizontal gene transfer may have occurred within these genes. Although this is a small sample size it is not the first time this observation has been made. Based on SNP densities, Park et al. (Park et al., 2012) recently demonstrated that such mechanisms of diversity, specifically horizontal gene transfer, likely have occurred within the ptx and ptl loci. In addition, recombination could explain why strain 253 is so highly divergent from the other strains of animal origin in the MLST tree (Supplemental Fig. 1 ), but not in the trees based on the BvgAS-regulated genes (Fig. 4) .",
