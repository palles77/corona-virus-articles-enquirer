It is produced as a recombinant protein by means of a baculovirus expression vector which contains the feline interferon omega (IFN-\u03c9) sequence (Ueda et al., 1993) . This baculovirus replicates in silkworms, permitting the production of the glycosylated molecule which, after purification, can be used therapeutically (Ueda et al., 1993) .",

Following initial in vitro studies (Truyen and Schultheiss, 2002) , several authors have performed in vivo trials in order to assess its clinical and immune properties. The action of rFeIFN-\u03c9 in cats naturally infected with feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and coinfected with FeLV and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) has been described, showing that this compound induced an important clinical improvement and an increased survival time of treated cats (de Mari et al., 2004) . Another group of authors reported that rFeIFN-\u03c9 improved the clinical condition of retroviral infected cats, although minor changes were observed on other parameters such as hypergammaglobulinemia, CD4/CD8 ratio, proviral load and viremia (Dom\u00e9nech et al., 2011) . Thus, an overall improvement of innate immunity was suspected (Dom\u00e9nech et al., 2011) . Recently, our group has reported that, in addition to improving clinical signs, rFeIFN-\u03c9 also induces a reduction of concurrent viral shedding (namely herpesvirus, coronavirus, parvovirus and calicivirus) which is particularly relevant in shelter medicine . In an attempt to understand the immune pathways underlying the therapeutic action of rFeIFN-\u03c9, we also evaluated the effect of this compound on acute phase proteins (APPs) in naturally retrovirally infected cats, confirming that it potentiates the innate immune response .",

After some trials describing the use of lower oral doses of rFeIFN-\u03c9 in various conditions such as chronic gingivostomatitis (Hennet et al., 2011; Leal et al., 2013) , an oral protocol was recently proposed in naturally FIV-infected cats . This was based on the daily oral administration of 0.1 MU/cat during 90 consecutive days and, in a similar way to the licensed protocol, revealed a significant clinical improvement of treated cats without relevant changes in hematology, serum biochemistry, serum protein electrophoresis or, in contrast to the licensed protocol, APPs . This apparent difference in the mechanism of action between the two protocols is in agreement with previous authors who suggested that oromucosal interferon (IFN) therapy seems to act by different mechanisms than parenteral protocols (Tovey, 2002) . Therefore, while in the licensed protocol the increased APP seems to denote a potentiated innate immune response Leal et al., 2014) , in the oral protocol the immune mechanisms underlying the observed clinical improvement remain unclear.",

The groups were indistinguishable on D0 for mRNA expression of all the measured cytokines, which made the Fig. 2 . Mean \u00b1 SE of plasma IL-12p40, IL-4 and IL-6 concentrations in naturally FIVinfected cats submitted to two different protocols of rFeIFN-\u03c9. SC refers to cats treated with the subcutaneous rFeIFN-\u03c9 licensed protocol and PO to cats receiving the oral protocol. The groups were statistically similar at baseline values except for IL-4 concentration which was higher in the SC group than in the PO group (\u25cap = 0.013comparison between groups). The SC group showed a statistically significant decrease of IL-6 concentration (*p = 0.037 -comparison between the end and beginning of therapy). SC group, submitted to the licensed protocol, a reliable positive control. Comparing the beginning and the end of therapy in both groups, there were no marked differences in mRNA expression for the majority of cytokines, although a decreasing tendency was observed. This decrease was only significant for IL-6 expression in FIVinfected cats after oral rFeIFN-\u03c9 therapy. Although not statistically significant, IL-1 and TNF-\u03b1 also tended to decrease in these animals. These findings are consistent with an overall reduction of proinflammatory pathways in cats treated with the oral protocol. The same is observed in the SC group in which IL-1, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 expression showed a decreasing tendency. Therefore, also in the licensed protocol, the pro-inflammatory pathways of the innate immune response tend to be reduced. Correlating these findings with other biomarkers of the innate immunity, our group had shown that the licensed subcutaneous rFeIFN-\u03c9 therapy is associated with a concurrent increase of APPs . In opposition, the oral protocol did not change APP profile in treated cats . Due to the fact that IL-6 is strongly involved in the stimulation of APP production, it is surprising that pro-inflammatory pathways tended to decrease in these animals. A possible explanation relies on the fact that although IL-6, IL-1 and TNF-\u03c9 are thought to be the main inducers of this acute phase reaction (Mart\u00ednez-Subiela et al., 2001; Paltrinieri, 2008) , they are not the only cytokines involved in this phenomenon. Recognizing that APPs have several protective functions (Ceron et al., 2005; Hochepied et al., 2003; Paltrinieri, 2008; Petersen et al., 2004; Steel and Whitehead, 1994) , various pathways other than pro-inflammatory stimuli can lead to their production. Therefore, it seems reasonable to state that this paradoxical increase of APPs in cats with evidence of a reduced pro-inflammatory stimuli may be induced by other mediators than IL-6, IL-1 or TNF-\u03b1, such as IL-18 (Duan et al., 2004) . Further studies are needed to fully understand the mechanisms behind the observed APP increase in these cats.",

The same was observed for the Th2 quantified cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10). In particular, IL-10 was undetectable in the majority of animals, making the results for this cytokine negligible by this method. Nonetheless, IL4 mRNA expression allowed a reasonable quantification of Th2 activation. Although nonsignificant, a decreasing trend was noted in both protocols for IL-4 mRNA expression. This was closest to significance for the oral protocol (p = 0.058), which, incidentally, may partially explain the benefit seen with oral rFeIFN-\u03c9 therapy in a recently published study on canine atopic dermatitis where a high IL-4/IFN-\u03b3 ratio is believed to contribute to the disorder (Litzlbauer et al., 2014) .

            "text": "Concurrently to mRNA expression monitoring, the plasma levels of IL-6, IL-12p40 and IL-4 were also measured. Similarly to the basal values of cytokine expression, groups were similar on D0 for IL-6 and IL-12p40. The exception was IL-4 which was significantly higher in animals from the SC group than in the PO group. This can be explained by different factors such as their environment once cats from the SC group were living in a cattery whereas cats from the PO group were mainly indoor animals with less exposure to other cats. Another relevant factor is the presence of opportunistic infections, which were more evident in the SC group than in the PO one . In cats from animal shelters it is expected that the Th2 response will be increased due to the constant stimuli from concurrent infections and environmental challenges. However, as the effect of therapy was assessed by monitoring plasma levels of each cytokine before and after therapy and the cats did not alter their living conditions, it is not anticipated that this difference at baseline will have any relevant impact on the results. Nevertheless, the changes seen in IL-4 and IL-12p40 plasma levels were not statistically significant and the overall tendencies were considered negligible. They can probably be explained by a high individual variability that induced slight fluctuations on the overall results of these cytokines. Interestingly, IL-6 plasma levels significantly reduced in the SC group while it remained stable in cats treated with the oral protocol. Correlating these results with mRNA expression profile, it is observed that in the SC group, although the decrease of IL-6 mRNA expression was not significant, rFeIFN-\u03c9 induced an important reduction of its concurrent plasma levels. In contrast, the significant decrease noted in IL-6 mRNA expression in cats submitted to oral therapy was not reflected in their plasma levels of this cytokine. This can be explained by eventual post-transcriptional events (Vogel and Marcotte, 2012 ) that delay the translation and impair a direct correlation between IL-6 mRNA expression and its concurrent plasma level in cats treated orally even though, albeit with some differences, these results suggest that IL-6 cytokine production is affected in FIV-infected cats during rFeIFN-\u03c9 therapy, independently of the protocol applied. It seems reasonable to state that higher pulsate subcutaneous doses seem to be more effective than lower continuous oral therapy for reducing pro-inflammatory stimuli in FIV-infected cats. However continuous oral therapy also altered IL-6 expression meaning that this immune modulation protocol retains some anti-inflammatory properties. These results reinforce the beneficial aspects of rFeIFN-\u03c9 as an immunomodulatory therapy, in light of the facts that basal levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines tend to be increased in FIV-infected cats (Lawrence et al., 1995) . Proviral load on D0 was similar in both groups and an expectable correlation was established between this parameter on D0 and clinical presentation, meaning that cats in worse condition showed higher levels of provirus. It has been previously reported that the licensed protocol does not induce significant changes in proviral load (Dom\u00e9nech et al., 2011) . However in this study we found a significant increase of proviral load in the SC group. An increasing, but non-significant, tendency was also noted with the oral protocol. A possible explanation for this finding lies in the fact that, in both groups, lymphocyte numbers tended to increase with therapy. Although this increase was within the reference range, it may explain the subsequent increase of proviral load, especially in light of the improved clinical condition in both groups. .",

            "text": "Viremia was only detected in a small proportion of animals of both groups on D0. This is not surprising in a study using naturally infected cats with an unknown duration of infection. Chronically FIV-infected cats eventually cease to have detectable viral RNA due to viral latency (Murphy et al., 2012; Tomonaga et al., 1995) . No correlation was established between viremia and clinical scores. The main clinical signs in the symptomatic animals were therefore most likely due to opportunistic infections rather than directly induced by FIV replication. This suggests that the beneficial effects of rFeIFN-\u03c9 in FIV-infected cats is unlikely to be related to a direct anti-viral action on the FIV virus in either protocol, but rather to improved control of secondary infections in addition to reduction of proinflammatory pathways.",

            "text": "As for all clinical trials, there were a few limitations that must be stated. Even if the groups did not differ in the majority of measured variables, cats that received the SC group were living in a cattery/animal shelter while cats treated with oral rFeIFN-\u03c9 were mainly indoor/owned cats. Therefore, the groups were exposed to different environmental and human stimuli which cannot be precisely determined. However, recognizing that D0 results were set as the baseline value and the individual control for each cat, the overall tendency was analyzed for each group which minimized this limitation. Another point to consider is that cytokine expression results depended on blood mRNA collection and extraction. It is important to note that a reliable measurement of circulating mRNA is difficult as RNAases are present ubiquitously which degrade it (Etheridge et al., 2013) . Furthermore, mRNA extraction efficiency varies according to the method applied and can be affected by multiple external variables such as blood clots and sampling conditions which determine its quality (Wong et al., 2004) . To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study reporting cytokine profiles based on blood mRNA measurements in naturally FIV-infected cats. Considering the low values obtained, it is reasonable to say that blood mRNA does not seem to be as effective as plasma levels or even in vitro studies for assessing this aspect of the immune response (Robert-Tissot et al., 2011) . A concurrent evaluation and stimulation of PBMCs from naturally-FIV infected cats would have been helpful in clarifying these data. Interestingly, a recent study validated a microsphere immunoassay for the detection of plasma IL12/ 23 (Wood et al., 2012) . Perhaps in the near future the evaluation of the cytokine profile of FIV cats will be easier and more helpful in the monitoring of infected cats and therapies.",

Among the measured cytokines, this work revealed that IL-6 production was significantly affected in FIVinfected cats treated with subcutaneous or oral rFeIFN-\u03c9 protocols. While the high pulse scheme of the SC protocol leads to an important reduction on IL-6 plasma levels, the continuous lower doses of the oral protocol induce a decrease on IL-6 expression, although not sufficiently to be reflected in significant reductions of its plasma levels. In summary, the acquired immune-response, namely Th1/Th2 pathways, was not found to be the major means by which rFeIFN-\u03c9 acted in this study. Its main action seems to be on the innate immune response where it reduces the proinflammatory stimuli. This anti-inflammatory action can in part justify the observed clinical improvement induced by this immunomodulator.",
