The majority of these illnesses are nonbacterial and neither necessitate nor are alleviated by antibiotic therapy (Tables 1-1 to 1-3). Acute streptococcal pharyngitis, however, warrants accurate diagnosis and therapy to prevent serious suppurative and nonsuppurative complications. Furthermore, life-threatening infectious complications of streptococcal and nonstreptococcal oropharyngeal infections may manifest with mouth pain, pharyngitis, parapharyngeal space infectious extension, and airway obstruction (Tables 1-4 and 1-5).",

In pharyngitis caused by parainfluenza and influenza viruses, rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the symptoms of coryza and cough often overshadow sore throat, which is generally mild. Influenza virus may cause high fever, cough, headache, malaise, myalgias, and cervical adenopathy in addition to pharyngitis. In young children, croup or bronchiolitis may develop. RSV is associated with bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and croup in young children. RSV infection in older children is usually indistinguishable from a simple upper respiratory tract infection. Pharyngitis is not a prominent finding of RSV infection in either age group. Parainfluenza viruses are associated with croup and bronchiolitis; minor sore throat and signs of pharyngitis are common at the outset but rapidly resolve. Infections caused by parainfluenza, influenza, and RSV are often seen in seasonal (winter) epidemics.",

There is sparing of the posterior pharynx in herpes gingivostomatitis; the infection usually occurs in young children.

Chlamydia trachomatis has been implicated serologically as a cause of pharyngitis in as many as 20% of adults with pharyngitis, but isolation of the organism from the pharynx has proved more difficult. Chlamydia pneumoniae has also been identified as a cause of pharyngitis. Because antibodies to this organism show some crossreaction with C. trachomatis, it is possible that infections formerly attributed to C. trachomatis were really caused by C. pneumoniae. Diagnosis of chlamydial pharyngitis is difficult, whether by culture or serologically, and neither method is readily available to the clinician.M. pneumoniae most likely causes pharyngitis. Serologic (positive mycoplasma immunoglobulin M [IgM]) or, less often, culture methods can be used to identify this agent, which was found in 33% of college students with pharyngitis in one study. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is diagnostic.There is no need to seek evidence of these organisms routinely in pharyngitis patients in the absence of ongoing research studies of nonstreptococcal pharyngitis. The efficacy of antibiotic treatment for M. pneumoniae and chlamydial pharyngitis is not known, but these illnesses appear to be self-limited. Treatment of more complicated M. pneumoniae infections, such as pneumonia (Table 1 -12), is indicated with erythromycin, azithromycin, or clarithromycin; doxycycline may be used if the patient is older than 10 years.",
