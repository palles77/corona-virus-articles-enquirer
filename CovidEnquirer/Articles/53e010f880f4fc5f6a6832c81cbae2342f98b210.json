            "text": "We used a single equation with discrete phases to fit the daily cumulative case data from the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in Toronto. This model enabled us to estimate turning points and case numbers during the 2 phases of this outbreak. The 3 estimated turning points are March 25, April 27, and May 24. The estimated case number during the first phase of the outbreak between February 23 and April 26 is 140.53 (95% confidence interval ) if we use the data from February 23 to April 4; and 249 (95% CI: 246.67-251.25) at the end of the second phase on June 12 if we use the data from April 28 to June 4. The second phase can be detected by using case data just 3 days past the beginning of the phase, while the first and third turning points can be identified only \u224810 days afterwards. Our modeling procedure provides insights into ongoing outbreaks that may facilitate real-time public health responses. M athematical models have been used to predict the course of epidemics, albeit with mixed results (1). Whether and how infectious diseases are likely to spread (2-4) are affected by stochastic events (5). Once outbreaks have begun, knowing their potential severity helps public health authorities respond immediately and effectively. Much relevant information is contained in the answers to 2 questions: 1) Is the current outbreak getting better or worse? 2) How many people will be infected before the outbreak ends? Attempts to answer these questions in the early stages of an epidemic can be futile and at times misleading (6); nonetheless, we can address them with an appropriate mathematical model once sufficient time has elapsed (7). Moreover, answers can be accurate if no stochastic event occurs that could substantially alter the course of outbreaks.",

Moreover, t m = t i + (lna)/r is equal to the inflection point t i when a = 1 and approximates t i when a is close to 1 The model parameters are as follows: K is the carrying capacity or total case number, r is the per capita growth rate of the infected population, and a is the exponent of deviation from the standard logistic curve.

            "text": "To rectify this situation, we proposed a multistage Richards model, 1 stage for each of the S-shaped segments resulting from multiple waves of infection during this outbreak. Stages are distinguished by turning points (or inflection points), denoting acceleration after deceleration at the end of each S-shaped segment, the local minima of the corresponding incidence curves. For an n-phase epidemic outbreak, n -1 local minima separate the n phases. For illustration, the incidence curve for Toronto given in Figure  2 contains 2 peaks (local maximum or turning point of the first type) and 1 valley (local minimum or turning point of second type). The multistage Richards model procedure requires 5 steps. First, fit the Richards model to cumulative cases on successive days by using a standard least-square routine. For single-phase outbreaks, parameter estimates (a, r, t i , K) will converge as the trajectory approaches carrying capacity K, as demonstrated in the Taiwan and Hong Kong SARS outbreaks (7, 9) . Second, if estimated parameters remain convergent until no more new cases are detected, the outbreak has only 1 phase. However, if the estimates begin to diverge from heretofore fixed values, one knows that a turning point denoting the start of a second phase has occurred. Third, locate the turning point, t min , separating 2 S-shaped phases of the epidemic as the local minimum of the incidence curve ( Figure 2 ). This is the curve for S\u2032(t) given in the equation (1) . Fourth, fit the Richards model to the cumulative case curve again, but starting from t min + 1, the day after the start of second phase. The estimated parameters (a, r, t i , K) will again converge as the curve approaches the carrying capacity K for the second phase. Finally, repeat steps 2-4 in the event more phases occur until the outbreak ends.",

This finding pinpoints the second turning point of the Toronto outbreak at April 27.

Through this procedure, we can pinpoint retrospectively the 3 key turning points for the spread of disease during the 2-phase outbreak in Toronto area. The first turning point for the spread of SARS occurred on March 20 when the first wave of infections leveled off. April 22 was the second turning point, at which time persons infected by the undetected index patient for the second wave began to experience symptoms. Our findings also concur with the World Health Organization action that lifted a travel advisory issued on April 22 that limited travel to Toronto. In retrospect, the Toronto outbreak would have ended with the first wave, if not for the single undetected case and subsequent infections that occurred before April 22. Furthermore, our results also corroborate the assessment of Health Canada, which pinpointed April 21 as the start of the second phase of the outbreak in Toronto area. The third and final turning point for the infections occurred on May 19, when the spread of disease finally leveled off.",

However, accuracy depends on having the incidence data for some time past the inflection point (7) and no new waves of infection in the future. Both points can be aptly illustrated by the Toronto outbreak. By using data from 2/23-4/14, we can predict the 95% CI of cases in the first phase of this outbreak at 137.34-148.22, 10 days before the phase ended. Incidence data 20 days after the inflection point of the first phase (March 25) would have enabled us to project the severity of the epidemic, had there not been a second wave of infection. By performing daily fits with updated case data, one could determine if parameters were converging to reliable values for the current phase of the outbreak. Similarly, for phase 2 of the Toronto outbreak, 11 days after the final inflection point (May 24) , the data from April 28 to June 4 give a good estimated 95% CI of the cumulative cases of 246.67-251.25, 8 days before onset of the last case.",

The estimated r = 0.136 for Taiwan outbreak in (7) yields R 0 = 3.08. Note that, because of the shift in the cumulative number used for the model fit of the second phase, the resulting value for r cannot be used in this simple calculation. A list of basic reproduction numbers for SARS in affected areas computed in literature by using Richards model and T = 8.4 is given in Table 4 for comparison. The larger basic reproduction numbers for Toronto (phase 1) and Taiwan, as compared with Hong Kong and Singapore, may be attributable to the relatively high percentage of nosocomial infections (13, 14) .",
