Humoral immune response as induced by rMVEZHPVL1 vaccines in susceptible primates and comparison with P. pastoris expressing HPV vaccine 3.4.1. Total IgG response measured by anti-HPV16L1/18L1 antibody ELISA The HPV16L1 and HPV18L1 antibody titres ( Fig. 4A and B) were 4-fold or higher than the PBS negative control titres as early as D21 only after 1 dose in all vaccine groups. These antibody titres were slightly increased by the 2nd and 3rd boosters in both groups. At various intervals between immunization and until the end of experimentation, anti HPV16L1/18L1 titres were always P4-fold higher than those in the negative control. Interestingly, when one dose of MV vectored HPV vaccine was given in measles vaccine-primed animals on D342, the anti-HPV 16 and 18L1 antibodies appeared quickly on D372 and later. This result confirms that pre-existing immunity to measles does not interfere with replication of the MV vectored HPV vaccine. Additionally, priming with Pichia and boosting with measles HPV resulted in a more than 4-fold increase in titres, demonstrating that classical and next-generation measles HPV can be combined for immunization.",

In developed countries, measles vaccines cost approximately $10 and are offered to UNICEF at a price of $0.24. Both commercial HPV vaccines require a complete three-dose vaccination regimen to confer protective immunity. Therefore, these vaccines cannot fulfill the needs of HPV vaccination in developing countries or low-resource areas. The process of vaccine production is complex and involves numerous steps (seed and batch fermentation, lysis, clarification, chromatography, ultracentrifugation and/or ultrafiltration, sterile filtration, adjuvant adsorption, and filling) when using yeast or other classical recombinant expression systems such as baculovirus. In contrast, live measles vaccines can be produced quickly and simply using MRC-5 cells for virus propagation in roller bottles followed by harvesting of the supernatant, clarification, blending, final filling, and lyophilization. The yield of live virus measles HPV was quite high at approximately 400,000 doses or more per batch of 100 roller bottles.
