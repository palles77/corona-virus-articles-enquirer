Rapid and accurate testing at the point-of-need (PON) supports prevention of virus spread and management of clinical disease. This study evaluated the performance of an insulated isothermal PCR (iiPCR) that detects proviral DNA, and a reverse transcription (RT)-iiPCR that detects both viral RNA and proviral DNA, for FeLV detection at the PON. Methods Mycoplasma haemofelis, feline coronavirus, feline herpesvirus, feline calicivirus and feline immunodeficiency virus were used to test analytical specificity. In vitro transcribed RNA, artificial plasmid, FeLV strain American Type Culture Collection VR-719 and a clinical FeLV isolate were used in the analytical sensitivity assays. A retrospective study including 116 clinical plasma and serum samples that had been tested with virus isolation, real-time PCR and ELISA, and a prospective study including 150 clinical plasma and serum samples were implemented to evaluate the clinical performances of the iiPCR-based methods for FeLV detection. Results Ninety-five percent assay limit of detection was calculated to be 16 RNA and five DNA copies for the RT-iiPCR, and six DNA copies for the iiPCR. Both reactions had analytical sensitivity comparable to a reference realtime PCR (qPCR) and did not detect five non-target feline pathogens. The clinical performance of the RT-iiPCR and iiPCR had 98.82% agreement (kappa[\u03ba] = 0.97) and 100% agreement (\u03ba = 1.0), respectively, with the qPCR (n = 85). The agreement between an automatic nucleic extraction/RT-iiPCR system and virus isolation to detect FeLV in plasma or serum was 95.69% (\u03ba = 0.95) and 98.67% (\u03ba = 0.85) in a retrospective (n = 116) and a prospective (n = 150) study, respectively. Conclusions and relevance These results suggested that both RT-iiPCR and iiPCR assays can serve as reliable tools for PON FeLV detection.",

            "text": "Feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) is a gamma retrovirus that causes malignant, proliferative and degenerative disorders of the feline haematopoietic system. 1 The most common outcome of FeLV infection is a regressive infection, whereby cats clear infectious virus from the blood but retain proviral DNA in infected cells and their progeny. [2] [3] [4] Alternatively, in a progressive infection, FeLV replication goes unchecked, and infectious virus or viral RNA can be recovered persistently from the bloodstream. Progressively infected cats provide the major reservoir of infection, and most die within 3 years from a haematopoietic disorder. 5 The prevalence of FeLV is in decline worldwide, [6] [7] [8] owing to the widespread use of effective vaccines, as well as test and removal policies. Accurate and rapid identification of FeLV-infected cats at the point-of-need (PON) can support strategies towards virus eradication. Many diagnostic tests are already available, including immunoassays that detect circulating FeLV p27 antigen, virus isolation (VI) assays that recover circulating infectious virus, and molecular assays that detect either viral RNA (reverse transcription real-time PCR [RT-qPCR]) or integrated proviral DNA (qPCR).",

            "text": "The p27 immunoassays are predominantly used as rapid screening tests at PON. However, given the declining prevalence of FeLV and consequent increase in falsepositive results, and the significance of a positive result, it is currently recommended that antigen-positive samples are retested using a second method. 9, 10 This can delay decision-making, with welfare and cost implications, particularly for shelters. VI, the gold standard in FeLV infection diagnosis, is not readily available to private practitioners; furthermore, the test is laborious with long turnaround times. Increasingly, sensitive molecular assays (RT-qPCR and qPCR) are viewed as practical alternatives to antigen and VI testing. 3, 9, 11, 12 RT-qPCR assays detect viral RNA, which correlates well with viraemia and progressive infection, 9 whereas qPCR assays detect proviral DNA that has integrated into the genome of infected cells. 11, 13 Both progressively and regressively infected cats harbour proviral DNA, but quantitative assays can assist in distinguishing between these populations. 3 Molecular assays have been recommended for the detection of FeLV-exposed cats, to investigate obscure clinical cases and to screen potential blood-donor cats. 3, [9] [10] [11] [12] However, RT-qPCR and qPCR assays are currently restricted to commercial diagnostic laboratories owing to their requirement for sophisticated instruments and skilled technicians. A rapid, affordable and user-friendly platform is needed for PON detection of FeLV viral RNA or proviral DNA.",

[14] [15] [16] [17] The methodology is simple, cost-effective and rapid, with the potential to be field-deployable. One iiPCR system, the portable POCKIT Nucleic Acid Analyzer (GeneReach USA), is commercially available. This device is equipped with a simple heating source to establish natural thermal convection in a capillary tube. A hydrolysis probe (eg, a TaqMan probe) generates optical signals that are converted to S/N ratios (signal after /signal before ) and automatically reported as positive/negative results on a digital screen by a data-pr\u00b0Cessing module. Accumulated evidence is available to support the assertion that the clinical performance of the POCKIT system is comparable to that of various laboratory qPCR or nested PCR assays for a number of veterinary-significant pathogens, including feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), canine parvovirus, canine distemper virus, equine influenza virus H3N8 subtype, classical swine fever virus and blue tongue virus. [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] Taking advantage of the POCKIT system, a commercial RT-iiPCR that detects both viral RNA and proviral DNA (POCKIT FeLV Reagent Set; GeneReach USA), and an iiPCR that only detects proviral DNA (POCKIT FeLV Reagent Set [-RT]; GeneReach USA) have been developed to help PON identification of FeLV-exposed cats. Fielddeployable manual and automatic nucleic acid extraction methods are available to work with the POCKIT system for PON applications (PetNAD Nucleic Acid Co-prep kit and taco mini Nucleic Acid Automatic Extraction System [taco mini], respectively [GeneReach USA]).",

In total, six samples were positive and 144 negative by VI (Table 7) , indicating that the prevalence of FeLV infection in the study region was likely relatively low. All six VI-positive and two VI-negative samples were positive by the taco mini/ RT-iiPCR system; one of the VI-negative samples gave positive results with both PCR-based methods (Ct = 27) and the p27 ELISA at VDS-UG (number 7; Table 8 ). The second VI-negative sample tested negative on qPCR and p27 ELISA, and subsequently tested negative on POCKIT on repeat testing (number 12; Table 8 ). Compared with VI, the taco mini/RT-iiPCR system had a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 68.29-100) and a specificity of 98.61% (95% Table 3 Evaluation of analytical sensitivity of the feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) insulated isothermal PCR (iiPCR) and reverse transcription (RT)-iiPCR reagent sets using nucleic acids prepared from FeLV-infected cells CI 95.99-100).

Three retrospective and one prospective VI-negative samples tested at VDS-UG were positive by both the taco mini/RT-iiPCR and QIAamp DNA Mini/qPCR systems (Ct = 20, 20, 29, 27, respectively), and were p27 antigen positive on ELISA. In the VDS-UG laboratory and other diagnostic laboratories, 27 low qPCR Ct values are consistent with viraemia. Additionally, in the VDS-UG laboratory, proviruspositive samples that are antigenaemic have a high probability of viraemia (data not shown). As all four samples were both provirus and p27 antigen positive, it is likely that the VI results are false negative. Although very sensitive, VI is still dependent on the successful recovery of live virus from blood samples, which may fail owing to non-viable virus or undetectable viral loads. Results from a fourth retrospective sample that tested negative on VI and p27 antigen ELISA, but positive on RT-iiPCR and qPCR (Ct = 32), suggests that FeLV virions were not actively produced from the proviral DNA; that is, this was a regressive infection. At VDS-UG, one retrospective VI-positive sample was unexpectedly negative by the taco mini/RT-iiPCR system. One possibility may be poor quality or degenerate nucleic acid; RNA is particularly fragile once extracted. Alternatively, the presence of sample inhibitors may have interfered with the reaction, or the viral loads were relatively low which may lead to <100% positive results in repeat tests.",

This interesting finding may reflect the testing of diverse blood fractions in this study. The VDS-UG qPCR screened cells within the buffy coat for proviral DNA, whereas both VI and RT-iiPCR assays tested plasma or serum for whole infectious virions or viral RNA. The detection of proviral DNA at high Ct levels, and the failure to detect viral RNA or infectious virus in plasma or serum suggest that all four cats were regressively infected. 4 This might suggest that using the RT-iiPCR to test different blood fractions may assist in distinguishing progressively and regressively infected cats; that is, testing serum for viral RNA and testing buffy coat for both viral RNA and proviral DNA. A positive result on serum would suggest progressive infection. However, in the retrospective study, one cat with a suspected regressive infection tested positive using the RT-iiPCR on plasma or serum, so this may not be absolutely reliable.",

            "text": "It is highly recommended that FeLV infection status is determined before introduction of cats into group housing, before administration of the FeLV vaccine, and before blood donation, to help mitigate the spread of FeLV. On-site sensitive testing prior to blood transfusion could help reduce unintentional FeLV transmission. 28 Timely isolation or removal of a FeLV-infected cat in a multi-cat household, shelter or boarding kennel environment is also important for FeLV infection control. It is increasingly recognised that it may be important to identify all FeLV-exposed cats irrespective of their infection status. In regions where FeLV prevalence is low, identifying all FeLV-exposed cats may be an important step towards FeLV eradication. Although regressively infected cats appear to have a low risk of developing FeLV-related disease, [29] [30] [31] and were previously not believed to pose a significant infection risk to healthy cats, 32,33 recent studies have concluded that regressive infections can be reactivated to resume virus replication, shedding and disease. 2, 34 Although rapid p27 antigen immunoassays can serve as the initial screening test at patient-side, they cannot identify cats with regressive infection, and a portion of p27-negative cats are regressively infected. 11, 35 In addition, FeLV RNA could be detected in the circulation or in tissues of some regressively infected cats, even in the absence of detectable proviral DNA. 2, 34, 36 In general, PCR methods are more sensitive and specific than antigen immunoassays. 2 Therefore, the fielddeployable FeLV RT-iiPCR of the POCKIT system, with excellent sensitivity for both RNA and DNA template, is the recommended method to identify all FeLVexposed cats at patient-side; but the preferred sample is buffy coat. Testing plasma or serum with the RT-iiPCR may exclude a low number of regressively infected cats, whereas the clinical performance of this assay had excellent agreement with the reference method when buffy coat was tested ( Table 4 ). The costs of the POCKIT Micro Plus device and the reagent, US$2000 and US$8, respectively, shall allow cost-effective on-site screening of FeLV-exposed animals even for shelter settings to facilitate eradication of FeLV infection from the community in the long run.",

The combination of a proviral PCR method and a p27 antigen immunoassay have been shown to achieve 100% diagnostic sensitivity. 2, 3, 13, 24 For instance, p27-positive and proviral DNA (iiPCR-positive results) suggest a progressive infection; p27-negative and the iiPCR-positive results suggest regressive infection with the potential for future viral reactivation. In addition, screening with a rapid p27 antigen immunoassay alone carries the risk of falsepositive results owing to cross-reactivity (this is exacerbated in populations of low FeLV prevalence) and any positive antigen results from stand-alone rapid p27 antigen immunoassays could be followed up with the same p27 antigen immunoassay and the proviral iiPCR at PON, as suggested above. 9, 10 Providing automatic interpretation of signals from the fluorescent probe, the POCKIT method is sufficiently user-friendly to be run by animal shelter personnel or clinical technical staff with basic training. There is no requirement to open the reaction tubes at any stage, significantly reducing the risks of carry-over contamination of PCR amplicons. The POCKIT (throughput 8) and its hand-held version POCKIT Micro Plus (throughput 4; GeneReach USA), are small, lightweight and robust, and could be operated with a rechargeable battery or car battery in low-resource settings. The reagent sets are offered in a lyophilised format to allow easy shipping and storage. Moreover, the field-deployable automatic nucleic acid extraction device helps simplify the nucleic acid preparation step. The taco mini/iiPCR system allows the users to obtain results from clinical samples in <2 h. For resource-limited settings, a manual nucleic acid extraction method (PetNAD Nucleic Acid Co-prep Kit) is also available, but may be less suitable in a PON setting given the requirement for appropriate technical competency and prolonged hands-on time.",
