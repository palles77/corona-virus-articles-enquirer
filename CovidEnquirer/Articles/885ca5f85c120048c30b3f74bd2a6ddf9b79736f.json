Recent advances in molecular diagnosis have made it possible to detect previously unknown viral agents and define the epidemiology of the most common respiratory viral infections more precisely, 6 but there are still many unanswered questions concerning the role of viruses in pediatric CAP. Little is known about the real prevalence of some viral infections, particularly those that have been identified more recently, and the frequency and importance of viral co-infections have not been fully clarified. In order to answer these questions, there is a need for studies using methods that allow the identification of the greatest number of potential viral respiratory pathogens.",

The enrollment of a large number of pediatric patients was facilitated by the use of pernasal nylon flocked swabs, which are significantly less invasive than nasopharyngeal aspirates and washes, and a valid alternative means of collecting secretions for the detection of respiratory viruses, particularly when used with molecular assays. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] To the best of our knowledge, we evaluated more respiratory viruses (including recently identified viruses) in children with CAP than ever before, thus improving our understanding of the role of individual viruses and viral co-infections. The data not only confirm the importance of viruses in determining pediatric CAP previously highlighted by a number of authors, but also suggest that viruses may play an even greater role than pre-viously thought as more than 75% of the children had a viral respiratory infection, including more than 90% of those aged <12 months. Previous studies have always found lower percentages and have therefore underestimated the real importance of viruses in pediatric CAP, probably because they sought a smaller number of viruses. [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] RSV and rhinovirus were the most common pathogens associated with CAP in the form of single viral infections and co-infections. They were found alone in more than 50% of the cases, thus highlighting their role as the causes of pediatric CAP and underlining the need to develop safe and effective vaccines in order to face the clinical problems they may give rise to. This seems to be particularly important in the case of rhinovirus which, until a few years ago, was considered only relatively important, was rarely associated with CAP, and was not usually included in the evaluation of CAP etiology. 1 The most frequently identified of the recently discovered viruses were bocavirus and hMPV. The data regarding bocavirus are quite similar to those reported by Fry et al. 26 and Don et al., 27 who found it in about 12% of children with CAP in, respectively, Thailand and Italy. However, as observed in other studies, [28] [29] [30] it was mainly found in association with other viruses that are often detected singly (particularly RSV and rhinovirus). This suggests that bocavirus may not play a primary role as a cause of CAP, and that its presence in respiratory secretions is owing to a previous infection followed by prolonged low-level viral shedding. Furthermore, in a previous study of children with respiratory diseases and bocavirus infection, we found that the most severe clinical pictures were diagnosed in children suffering from co-infections, whereas most of the cases associated with a single bocavirus infection were very mild. 31 The role played by hMPV seems to be more important. Its overall frequency was quite similar to that of bocavirus, but it was detected in association with other viruses in only about 22% of the cases, which is quite similar to that found by Wolf et al. 23 in a study carried out in Israel. This suggests that the virus may play a direct pathogenic role in the development of CAP.",

This confirms the importance of these viruses even in lower respiratory tract infections and once again underlines the need for annual vaccine administration. [32] [33] [34] The global incidence of infections owing to coronaviruses was 5AE6%, higher than that found in a large pneumonia study carried out in Thailand. 26 However, the fact that all of the coronaviruses were mainly found in association with other viruses suggests that both the old and new viruses are only relatively important in pediatric CAP. Consequently, despite the discovery of new coronaviruses, effective preventive measures do not seem to be urgently needed. The same seems to be true in the case of enterovirus, which was found in a very small number of cases and was very frequently associated with other viruses. Adenovirus and parainfluenza virus were identified in a very small number of cases. Previous studies have found that the frequency of identifying adenovirus can vary from 3% to 10%. 5 Although its prevalence is always relatively low, virus should be systematically monitored because it has been associated with severe and fatal necrotising pneumonia. 17 The incidence of parainfluenza virus infection was significantly lower than that observed in previous studies, 5 a finding that may have been at least partially due differences in the methods used to identify the viruses and the fact that we looked for a larger number of infectious agents. In most cases, they were found in association with other viruses, thus suggesting their only relative clinical importance.",

However, although higher among the most frequently isolated viruses, the prevalence of co-infections was not strictly related to the absolute prevalence of the individual viruses because it was higher in the case of coronaviruses, parainfluenza viruses, enterovirus, and adenovirus than RSV, rhinovirus, and influenza viruses, even though these last were detected in significantly more children. This finding contrasts with the hypothesis of Cilla et al., 19 who suggested that the percentage of co-infections owing to each virus is owing to its circulation in comparison with the other viruses and seems to indicate that other factors may play a role in favouring concomitant multiple viral infections in the same subject. Interestingly, only marginal differences were found in the demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiographic variables associated with the single viral infections. Although there were significant differences in the individual variables associated with a specific virus, the variability of the data makes it impossible to define a characteristic picture of the CAP cases associated with each virus. Furthermore, there were no difference between the viruses in terms of the clinical variables indicating disease severity (i.e., the rate and CRP, C-reactive protein; SD, standard deviation; SpO 2 , peripheral oxygen saturation. *38AE0\u00b0C or more any time during the illness (before or at enrolment, or during follow-up). **39AE0\u00b0C or more any time during the illness (before or at enrolment, or during follow-up).",

It also highlights the importance of epidemiological surveillance and the use of molecular (or at least rapid) tests in individual patients, in order to ensure that antiviral drugs are only used in the few cases in which they are indicated. 35, 36 Comparison of the characteristics of the single viral infections and co-infections showed that the only significant difference was the association between alveolar pneumonia and viral co-infections. As the clinical and laboratory data (including white blood cell counts and CRP concentrations) do not suggest bacterial super-infection, this finding may be explained by the synergistic role of more than one virus in causing lung inflammation and the consequent radiographic changes. On the other hand, non-alveolar CAP was similarly or more prevalent than alveolar pneumonia in the children with single viral infections.",

            "text": "This study has two limitations. First of all, identifying viruses in the upper respiratory secretions of children with CAP may not indicate that they are really involved in causing the disease because it may only indicate a coincidental upper airways infection or be due to a carrier state or the prolonged shedding of a pathogen that caused a previous infection. However, viruses are generally detected in no more than 5% of asymptomatic subjects, although the prevalence of rhinovirus can be as high as about 15%. 19 Given the prevalence of each viral infection in our children, it is highly likely that the detected viruses played an important pathogenic role in determining CAP in most cases. However, as it has been demonstrated that viral \u2044 bacterial co-infections are common, it is possible that the CAP cases attributed to viruses by us were at least partially owing to concomitant viral and bacterial infections. The higher CRP levels and the greater frequency of alveolar CAP observed in rhinovirus-positive cases than in RSV-and influenzapositive cases may indicate a greater degree of bacterial involvement in some viral infections. We systematically performed blood cultures for all of the enrolled children in order to identify bacterial infections but, because this procedure is not very sensitive, most of the cases were negative. It is therefore not possible to draw any conclusions concerning the real incidence of viral \u2044 bacterial co-infections or to evaluate the importance of each virus in favouring bacterial super-infections. On the other hand, although it may be useful to culture sputum in order to identify respiratory bacteria responsible for CAP, 37 we decided not to do so because the importance of collecting sputum from children is widely debated and, even when complicated and uncomfortable procedures are used (including pharmaco-logical pre-treatment, saline aerosol, and nasal aspiration), only some of the specimens are considered adequate. 38 The second limitation is related to the fact that the study was conducted in the winter and early spring, and so it may have overestimated the role of infectious agents that only circulate during this period or underestimated viruses that have a prevalent circulation in other months. Our organization in the ER does not allow active specimen collection from all CAP cases during a whole year.",
