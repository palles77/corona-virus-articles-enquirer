In today's modern laboratories many of the pathogens that were commonplace in the past are only occasionally observed today. Much of this progress is due to improvements in husbandry, breeding or rederivation methods, and health surveillance tests used by the supplier and the users. However, the breeder and the users must be forever vigilant and cognizant of some of the more common pathogens and the disease they can cause, because infections can and will continue to occur. This chapter will concentrate on the pathology of the more common pathogens of the laboratory rat. Although other ancillary tests (e.g. serological, bacteriological, etc.) will be mentioned briefly, the reader is encouraged to consult the listed references for details.",

It appears that mice and hamsters are not susceptible (Ueno et al., 1997) . Both RPV and RV are tropic for many of the same tissues and they both may result in a persistent infection. However, RPV is antigenically and genetically distinct from RV, and it apparently does not cause clinical signs or lesions in infant rats. It also seems that RPV may be more tropic for the small intestine and this site maybe the primary portal of entrance for RPV. The lung is believed to be the portal of entry and the site of initial replication for RV (Gaertner et al., 1993) .",

Viral factors include the viral strain, its virulence and tissue tropism. Host factors include the age and the immune status of the rat at the time of infection. For example, neonates may exhibit tremors, ataxia, jaundice, stunted growth, oily hair coats (Figure 7 .1), diarrhea and sudden death, whereas rats infected as juveniles (4 weeks old) or adults usually have latent asymptomatic infections. However, if such latently infected rats become immunocompromised or stressed they may exhibit paralysis resulting from hemorrhage and necrosis in the brain and spinal cord. In addition, scrotal cyanosis and hemorrhage (Figure 7 .2) may be observed in juvenile and adult male rats. There may also be a transient drop in breeding efficiency. Similar clinical signs may also be observed in naive young adult rats which are introduced into an enzootically infected population of rats (Coleman et al., 1983) .",

Similarly, RPV has also been detected in the feces, urine and saliva (Ueno et al., 1997) . Horizontal transmission of RV and RPV is thought to be primarily through direct animal-to-animal contact and fomites 0acoby et Yang et al., 1995; Ueno et al., 1996) . Vertical or in utero transmission appears to be dependent on the virus strain, the route of inoculation and the inoculation dose (Jacoby et al., 1988; Gaertner et al., 1996) . The duration of transmission after infection depends more on the age of the rat at the time of initial exposure than on the development of humoral immunity (Jacoby et al., 1988) . Experimentally infected neonates transmitted virus for 10 weeks after inoculation, whereas juvenile rats (4 weeks old) only transmitted RV for 3 weeks. In addition, Jacoby et al. also reported that the rats which had been experimentally infected as neonates continued to transmit virus for at least 7 weeks after seroconversion.",

RV attacks and destroys the cells in the external germinal cell layer of the cerebellar cortex of neonates, which results in granuloprival cerebellar hypoplasia and ataxia. Hepatocytes of the neonate and in some situations the adult are also targets for RV. Hepatic necrosis, hepatitis, fibrosis, nodular hyperplasia and iaundice result when the hepatocytes are targeted. The vascular endothelium and megakaryocytes are also attacked by RV and this along with the possible activation of the complement cascade may explain the hemorrhage observed in the testes (Figure 7 .3), epididymis, central nervous system (Figures 7.4 and 7.5 ) and other tissues (Figure 7 .6). The fetus is particularly vulnerable since a variety of tissues are mitotically active. In some in utero infections there are fetal deaths which result in decreased litter sizes and increased numbers of intrauterine resorption sites Margolis, 1966, 1969; Jacoby et al., 1979) .",

The most commonly used serologic tests are the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI). The ELISA and IFA can be used to identify antibodies to parvoviruses, and then the positive sera can be tested with the HAI assay to specifically identify whether or not the sera is reactive to either RV or H-1. There is currently no HAl test available to specifically identify RPV; however, negative results using the HAI test :for both RV and H-1 is putative evidence of previous exposure to RPV (Ueno et al., 1996) .",

Toxicological studies and surgical experiments involving the liver may also be compromised by the activation of a latent parvovirus infection during hepatocyte regeneration or proliferation (Ruffolo et al., 1966; Margolis et al., 1968) . There is also the possibility that a latent parvovirus infection could be activated when rats are immunocompromised by cytotoxic or immunosuppressive chemicals (Nathanson et al., 1970) . In addition, it would not be too hard to imagine the problems which might be encountered by the pathologist and the toxicologist attempting to distinguish parvoviral lesions from toxic lesions. Similar problems also may be encountered with teratology studies.

This rat has both purulent exudate and blood in its eye. Wojcinski and Percy, 1986; Schoeb and Lindsey, 1987; Percy and Williams, 1990; La Regina et al., 1992; Bihun and Percy, 1995; Liang et al., 1995; Macy et al., 1996; . All three coronaviruses cause inflammation and necrosis of the submaxillary (submandibular) salivary glands. Depending on the stage of the infection there may also be necrosis and/or squamous metaplasia of the ducts in the submaxillary salivary gland. Similar findings may be observed in the parotid salivary gland (Figure 7 .14), Harderian gland (Figure 7 .15) and other lacrimal glands of rats infected with SDAV or RCV. Lesions may also be observed in the respiratory tract with SDAV and RCV including interstitial pneumonia as well as inflammation, necrosis, and hyperplasia of the airways throughout the upper and lower respiratory tract. Bronchiectasis and squamous metaplasia of the bronchial epithelium have also been reported in persistently infected athymic rats (Weir et al., 1990) . Pulmonary atelectasis with compensatory emphysema, nonsuppurative perivasculitis and hyperplasia of the bronchial associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) may also be observed with RCV. Inflammation in the upper respiratory tract has been reported with CARS; however, there was apparently no involvement of the lower respiratory tract, parotid salivary gland or lacrimal glands (Maru and Sato, 1982) . Enlargement of the lymph nodes in the neck is due to reactive hyperplasia and/or inflammation. Ophthalmic lesions which may be seen include those observed at necropsy as well as lenticular degeneration, retinal degeneration and anterior synechia (Lai et al., 1976; Weisbroth and Peress, 1977; Weir et al., 1990) . observed a necrotizing encephalitis in rats which had been intranasally inoculated with SDAV during the first week of life. They speculated that similar lesions could possibly be seen in young suckling rats during natural epizootics; however, it appears that no cases have been reported in the literature. They also believed that the virus was probably carried to the brain via the blood, and not through the cribriform plate.",

The host's genotype, immune status and age are important factors Carthew and Sparrow, 1980a; Castleman et al., 1987; Liang et al., 1995) . For example, in one epizootic with SV the disease was more severe in Sprague-Dawley, BN/Bi and (WAG x BN) F1 rats, whereas WAG/Rij rats had a relatively milder disease . In this same epizootic, rats younger than eight months had relatively more severe lung lesions than older rats. In addition, the infection is more severe and the virus persists for a longer time in athymic nude rats, compared with euthymic rats. The microbial status of the host is also important, since the disease outcome can be significantly affected by secondary opportunistic bacteria and mycoplasma . Macroscopic lesions are frequently absent, but when present there may be small red to gray randomly distributed foci on the surface of the lungs or the lungs may be diffusely reddened (Castleman, 1983) . In addition, the lungs may fail to collapse when the thoracic cavity is opened. Purulent exudate wkhin the airways, ventral consolidation or abscesses in the lungs, as well as bronchiectasis would be suggestive of a possible infection with opportunistic bacteria and/or mycoplasma Carthew and Aldred, 1988 ). In pregnant females there may be a bloody vaginal discharge, retarded embryonic development and increased resorption sites in the uterus (Coid and Wardman, 1971; Carthew and Aldred, 1988) .",

During the acute stage the lesions include epithelial necrosis and inflammation in the nasal cavity, trachea, larynx, airways in the lung (Figure 7 .19), and alveoli. The inflammatory cell infiltrates in these locations include variable numbers of mononuclear cells (lymphocytes and plasma cells) and neutrophils. Increased numbers of alveolar macrophages may also be present in the alveoli. In general, the lesions in the lung are centered around the airways, especially the terminal bronchioles, and the adjacent alveoli; therefore, these lesions can be collectively referred to as a necrotizing bronchointerstitial pneumonia. During the reparative stage there may be hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia of the epithelium in the nasal cavity, bronchi, bronchioles (Figure 7 .20), and alveoli. Multinucleated syncytial epithelial cells may also be present in the bronchiolar epithelium and alveoli during the early and chronic stages of infection. In some lungs there may be collections of inflammatory ceils and fibroblasts in the lumina of bronchioles, and presumably these structures may develop into epithelial covered polypoid structures (Figure 7 .21). This finding is referred to as bronchiolitis obliterans. The lungs may completely return to normal or there may be residual scars (Figure 7 .22) including interstitial fibrosis, cholesterol clefts, and peribronchial and perivascular mononuclear cell cuffs. This later lesion may be the only lesion observed in aged rats during any stage of infection. The lesions are suggestive of a possible SV infection but they are not pathognomonic since similar lesions may be caused by coronaviruses of rats and less likely pneumonia virus of mice (Eaton and Van Herick, 1944; Vogtsberger et al., 1982; Liang et al., 1995) .",

In contrast, there have been slightly more reports of PVM interfering with research involving mice (Horsfall and Curnen, 1946; Richter, 1986) . PVM has the potential to have devastating effects on research using athymic nude mice since they are particularly prone to develop fatal disease (Richter et al., 1988; Weir et al., 1988) . Although similar fatal infections have yet to be reported in athymic rats, PVM might have the same effect with research involving them. Vonderfecht and his colleagues (1984) were the first to identify a virus which caused diarrhea in suckling rats. The virus was morphologically identical to typical rotaviruses, but it was antigenically different from other rotaviruses. They gave this virus the name of Infectious diarrhea of infant rats virus (IDIR) because it apparently only caused diarrhea in infant rats. Subsequent to their discovery, the IDIR virus was assigned to the group B rotavirus group which coatains similar atypical rotaviruses that infect and cause similar disease in humans, calves and pigs (Mebus eta/., 1978; Vonderfecht et al., 1988; Chasey et al., 1989; Eiden et al., 1991) .

IDIR virus seems to have more of an affinity for the middle and distal small intestines and less affinity for the proximal small intestines and even less for the colon. The virus causes loss of small intestinal villous enterocytes which are quickly replaced with immature cuboidal epithelium.

Intercurrent infections with Sendai virus, rat coronaviruses, opportunistic bacteria and possibly cilia-associated respiratory (CAR) bacillus can also significantly influence the disease outcome (MacKenzie et al., 1981; Lindsey et al., 1985; Lindsey, 1985, 1987; Schunk et al., 1995) . High environmental ammonia levels and other irritating gases can also exacerbate the disease (Lane-Petter et al., 1970; Cassell et al., 1973 Cassell et al., , 1981a Broderson et al., 1976; Schoeb et al., 1982; Lindsey et al., 1985; Pinson et al., 1988) . Such increases in environmental irritating gases may result from faulty ventilation systems, overcrowding and infrequent bedding changes. Similarly, exposure to some toxic chemicals (e.g. hexamethylphosphoramide) can also exacerbate the disease (Cassell et al., 1973; Overcash et al., 1976) . Some nutritional deficiencies (e.g. vitamins A and E) may predispose rats to infection with M. pulmonis (Tvedten et al., 1973) . Apparently, most strains of M. pulmonis are capable of causing upper respiratory tract lesions; however, not all are capable of causing significant pulmonary lesions (Lindsey et al., 1971; Cassell et al., 1973) . In addition, the inoculation dose of M. pulmonis also influences the disease outcome, especially in mice (Cassell et al., 1973 (Cassell et al., , 1981a .",

Rats of all ages may have evidence of acute (suppurative) to chronic rhinitis, otitis media, otitis interna and laryngotracheitis (Lane-Petter et al., 1970; Lindsey et al., 1971 Lindsey et al., , 1985 Broderson et al., 1976; Cassell et al., 1981a; Schoeb and Lindsey, 1987) . In addition, there may be pseudoglandular epithelial hyperplasia and/ or squamous metaplasia in the nasal and tracheal mucosa, as well as a reduction in the number of cilia which normally lines different parts of the airways (Lindsey et al., 1971 Schoeb and Lindsey, 1987) . In contrast, lesions in the lower respiratory tract are most common in rats beginning at 4 weeks old and may include one or more of the following lesions: hyperplasia of the bronchial-associated lymphoid tissue, bronchiectasis (Figure 7 .23), bronchiolectasis, suppurative bronchopneumonia, suppurative bronchiolitis, epithelial hyperplasia with associated submucosal mononuclear cell infiltrates in the upper and lower air passages (Figure 7 .24), peribronchial and perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrates, nonsuppurative to suppurative alveolitis, atelectasis and peribronchial pseudoglands (Figure 7 .25) (Lindsey et a/., 1971 Cassell et al., 1973; Jersey et al., 1973; Broderson et al., 1976; Lindsey, 1985, 1987; .

Grossly, the lungs of adult rats may have a cobblestone appearance (Figure 7 .26), due to the bronchiectasis and/or abscesslike structures, or there may only be dark red, purple, brown, or gray depressed foci with or without yellow areas (Lane-Petter et al., 1970; Lindsey et al., 1971; .

This accounts for the distribution of most lesions in the host. Although virtually any organ can develop lesions, the lung is the most frequently involved organ in the rat, whereas the kidney and liver are the most common organs in mice (Seronde, 1954; Giddens et al., 1968; Weisbroth and Scher, 1968) .",

In addition, there may also be hepatic necrosis, and fibrinous or fibrous pleuritis, and fibrinous pericarditis (LeMaistre and Tompsett, 1952; Zucker and Zucker, 1954; Seronde et al., 1956; Giddens et al., 1968; McEwen and Percy, 1985; Fox et al., 1987) .

In the lungs there may be either irregular foci of caseous necrosis surrounded by mixed inflammatory cells (Figure 7 .29) or there may be abscesses (Figure 7 .30). The lesions in the lungs are primarily found in the interstitium; however, in some instances abscesses can erode through the airways and parietal pleura resulting in the seepage of septic exudate and ultimately pleuritis. In contrast to some reports in the literature, multinucleated giant cells may be present at the margins of the lesions (Figure 7 .31). Necrosis and/or abscesses may be also present in the liver, kidney, subcutaneous tissues (Figure 7 .32), brain (Figure 7 .33), and other sites. Clusters of pleomorphic Gram-positive rods can be observed in the lesions. These bacterial colonies typically have either a Chinese letter (Figure 7 .34) or bottle brush configuration.",

(1995b) recommended culturing the oral cavities of rats, using furazolidone-nalidixic acidcolimycin (FNC) agar to detect latent infections with C kutsched. Additional sites along the upper and lower digestive tract also had a very high isolation rate, but the oral cavity was the best site. Serological tests (e.g. ELISA) as well as DNA-DNA hybridization techniques on tissue touch blots may also be helpful if available (Saltzgaber-Muller and Stone, 1986; Fox et al., 1987; Boot et al., 1995) . Subcutaneous injections with cortisone can also be used to detect latent infections by precipitating the disease (Fauve et al., 1964) . C kutsched has the potential to interfere with virtually any type of research which causes stress, immunosuppression, nutritional deficiencies, etc.",

All of the streptococci of concern in rats are Gram-positive cocci, and are catalase-negative, nonfermentative, and generally nonmotile (Ruoff, 1995) . The name Streptococcus is derived from the tendency of many members of the genus to form chains, visible on wet mounts of cultured colonies or in histologic section. Streptococci are differentiated on their ability to hemolyse erythrocytes in blood agar. Beta hemolysis refers to a clear, colorless zone of red cell lysis surrounding the bacterial colonies. This contrasts with alpha hemolysis, an often greenish to brownish indistinct zone of partially lysed erythrocytes, as well as with gamma hemolysis, the term used when no hemolysis is observed. Of primary interest in the rat is S. pneumoniae, which is alpha-hemolytic. There is also lesser interest for various members of the betahemolytic group, and for JEnterococcus spp., which are not truly streptococci.",

Humans are the natural host for S. pneumoniae (Austrian, 1998) , with both adults and children frequently colonized. Transmission is primarily via aerosol; fomites may play a less important role. Infection in rats is usually asymptomadc although disease has, albeit infrequently, been reported. Asymptomatic rats harbor the infection in the nasopharynx.

Histologically, the bronchopneumonia is characterized by edema, fibrinopurulent inflammation (Figure 7 .37) and necrosis of the pulmonary parenchyma, often with fibrinopurulent pleuritis. Affected rats may become bacteremic, and develop fibrinopurulent inflammation of other serous surfaces (peritoneum, synovium, etc.) and other tissues. Colonies of laboratory rats are screened for S. pneumoniae infection by nasopharyngeal culture onto blood agar (Kohn and Barthold, 1984) . However, S. pneumoniae must be differentiated from other alpha-hemolytic streptococci. This is most often performed by the optochin inhibition test which measures the sensitivity of the test isolate to optochin disks; most S. pneumoniae strains are inhibited to a greater degree than other alpha-hemolytic streptococci. Isolates displaying intermediate degrees of inhibition should be tested for bile solubility for confirmation; S. pneumoniae colonies are bile soluble (Ruoff, 1995) . However, due to the occurrence of nonpathogenic isolates (Fallon et al., 1988) , isolation of S. pneumoniae from rats, even if a respiratory problem is present, does not necessarily provide a diagnosis, nor does isolation of S. pneumoniae from asymptomatic rats necessarily indicate a colony health threat.",

Additionally, there may be bronchiectasis and considerable amounts of mucopurulent exudate in the airways and alveolar spaces (Figure 7.40) . A thin basophilic layer may be observed on the surface of the respiratory epithelium of airways in hematoxylin and eosin stained sections (Figure 7.41) , giving the impression that the cilia are more basophilic than normal, but this is not specific and should not be used as a defirfitive diagnostic feature. With a Warthin-Starry or Grocott's methenamine silver stain, filamentous bacilli are readily observed among cilia of respiratory epithelium from the nasal cavity to the bronchioles CAR bacillus infection should be distinguished from murine respiratory mycoplasmosis, other bacterial pneumonias (i.e. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Corynebacte,ium kutscheri, etc.) and viral pneumonias. Diagnosis of CAR bacillus infection should also raise the suspicion of coinfection with the other pathogens that often accompany CAR bacillus infections (van Zwieten et al., 1980; MacKenzie et al., 1981) .",

Interestingly, infection is not readily transmitted by soiled bedding (Cundiff et al., 1995) , so many sentinel programs may fail to detect this organism. Infection is lifelong, and the organisms are readily retrievable by tracheal lavage or scraping (Medina et al., 1998) .

Grossly, Tyzzer's disease may cause perianal fecal staining, but the most characteristic lesions are internal (Tyzzer, 1917; Duncan et al., 1993) . Multiple, pinpoint or larger, pale foci of necrosis are often visible on the surface of and within the liver (Figure 7 .44). Megaloileitis (Figure 7 .45), a greatly dilated, flaccid and hyperemic small intestine (ileum) may be present (Hansen et al., 1992a) . Hyperemia, edema, hemorrhage and possibly ulceration may affect any part of the intestine, especially the terminal ileum, cecum and colon. Probably as a consequence of intestinal involvement, mesenteric lymph nodes may be enlarged, hyperemic and edematous. In the heart, pale, circumscribed, sometimes raised foci may be present on the surface. Myocardial necrosis and inflammation due to Tyzzer's disease may also appear as pale linear streaks or circumscribed raised areas on the heart (Figure 7 .46), especially near the apex.",

In the liver, coagulative necrosis ( Figure  7 .47) is a frequent finding, and is often accompanied by a moderate leukocytic infiltrate (neutrophils, mononuclear cells, macrophages and, rarely, multinucleated giant cells) at the periphery of the lesions. Hemorrhage may accompany acute lesions, and mineralization may be visible with time as a consequence of the necrosis. In the heart, myocardial degeneration and necrosis occurs in a minority of cases, often associated with a mixed leukocytic infiltrate and dystrophic calcification.",

The vegetative form of the organism is a filamentous bacillus, 8.0-20.0 x 0.3-0.5 gm. One or usually more bacilli are present in cells in either a jumbled array (pickup stick) or parallel arrangement, as dictated by the shape of the cell. Occasionally, the vegetative form may be visible in hepatocytes in tissue sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin (Figure 7 .48), but usually special stains are necessary, including Warthin-Starry silver (best), Giemsa and methylene blue stains. The organism is Gram-negative, but stains very poorly with Gram stains. In the liver, the organisms are most often observed in surviving hepatocytes at the periphery or within lesions (Figure 7 .49), but may also be in hepatocytes not associated with a lesion. In the intestine, normal gut flora within mucosal crypts and superimposed upon the mucosal epithelial cells may complicate evaluation. Organisms may also be observed in myocytes of the heart when there is cardiac involvement. Less frequently, they may be seen in myocytes of the tunica muscularis of the intestine. Differential diagnoses for necrotizing hepatitis in the rat should include other bacterial septicemias, such as Corynebactedum kutsched, as well as infection with Rat virus. Diagnosis of clinical disease depends on demonstration of the organism in tissue. Tissue smears may facilitate rapid diagnosis (Figure 7 .50); Giemsa-stained smears of suspicious liver lesions are especially useful (Percy and Barthold, 1993b) .",

Disease provocation tests to exacerbate latent infections are widely used, and are recommended as a follow-up test when serologic positive results are obtained. However, there is some doubt as to the efficacy of these tests which rely on immunosuppression, usually with cyclophosphamide (Boivin et al., 1990) and less frequently with corticosteroids, followed by histopathologic evaluation. The doubt arises since animals may clear the C. piliforme infection and, therefore, would no longer be susceptible to activation of 'latent' infection (Motzel and Riley, 1992) . Alternatively, sentinel animals can be placed on soiled bedding, but this may require sentinels to be of the same species (to avoid species-specificity causing false negatives), as not even gerbils are susceptible to all strains of C pil~)rme (Motzel and Riley, 1992) .",

Offspring should also be held in strict isolation (i.e. not mixed in with a breeding colony) until repeatedly cultured negative for P. pneumotropica. P. pneumotropica is not transmitted to a significant degree by fomites, does not persist or multiply in the environment, and only rarely colonizes humans. Therefore, once a colony is free of the agent there is relatively little risk of reinfection except through introduction or incursion of infected animals.",

Eggs, which remain viable at room conditions for weeks to months, are deposited by the female in the colon and around the anus, and become infective in apprmdmately 6 hours. They are ingested during selfcleaning behavior, and hatch in the small intestine. The larvae then mature in the cecum in 10-11 days.
