In our study, 18 of 29 patients (62.1%) showed negative findings on CRs because the pneumonic shadows were dominantly distributed over basilar lung fields. Although lateral CRs might be useful for detecting the shadows, it was difficult to take lateral views for the poor PS patients. In addition, most of the poor PS patients could undergo chest radiography in the prone or sitting position only, and they could not obey the instruction of inspiration.

With regard to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus pneumonia, there was a study reported that CT was useful for the early diagnosis of pneumonia in patients with normal CRs. 17 For pneumonia in febrile neutropenic patients, there was a report that CT could detect pneumonic shadows approximately 5 days earlier than CR. 9 Our subgroup analysis performed among care level 5 patients showed significantly lower mortality in the CR-negative group irrespective of severity. Although it would be difficult to clarify the relationship between radiographic findings and prognosis using the retrospective survey seen in the current study, we think that CT contributes to early diagnosis, early treatment, and better prognosis for pneumonia patients with poor PS and negative CR findings. Additionally, our data showed that 31.0% of the CR-negative group had an A-DROP score of 3 or more. It was notable that CRs sometimes could not show positive findings even though pneumonia was severe.",

We did not include all patients with pneumonia admitted to our hospital, and there may have been a selection bias through including only the patients who underwent chest radiography and CT on the same day. Even performed on the same day, the time lag between the chest radiography and CT may have influenced the outcome because it is conceivable that the chest radiography findings changed from negative to positive during the few hours before the CT scan was performed. A further limitation is related to radiological diagnosis ability; only part of the chest CT image was surveyed by a radiologist from another facility, and no radiologists participated in the interpretation of the CRs. To accurately evaluate the radiographic findings, all CT images and CRs should be surveyed by two or more radiologists, and the Cohen's kappa coefficient should be calculated to measure interobserver agreement regarding the interpretation of the images. However, this was logistically difficult at our hospital.",
