Such oligonucleotides were subsequently eluted from the gels and their nucleotide sequences determined. When oligonucleotide probes of those sequences were synthesized and used in a dot-blot hybridization assay, the probes lacked IBV strain-speciticity and reacted with the RNAs of homologous as well as heterologous IBV strains. Based on these results, the methods used in this study need to be applied to a large number of oligonucleotide probes, to find one or a few that might be suitable as IBV strain-or serotype-specific oligonucleotide probes.",

Finally, the probes may have hybridized to themselves because of the palindromic nature of residues within the oligonucleotides which may have decreased the specificity of the hybridization and did not allow more stringent hybridization conditions.

(1991) who reported amplification of a 1020-nt fragment from IBV strain Beaudette by using two primers to conserved regions. In another study, Lin et al. (1991) amplified 400 nt from the S2 genes of twelve strains of various IBV serotypes. Although, restriction enzyme analysis of amplified DNA showed different patterns that were consistent with serological typing, it was not clear why this consistency occurred, since serotypic determinants were shown to be located on the Sl subunit. In a similar study, Zwaagstra et al. (1992) amplified 438 nt from the N genes of 18 IBV isolates and sequenced 360 nt of each isolate. They showed that the sequences of the N genes were different between serologically indistinguishable strains. All three methods, including the method described by us, were able to detect IBV RNA; however, none of them was able to detect serotypic differences. This suggests that nucleic acid detection methods may not be suitable for identification of IBV serotypes. This may due to the following: (1) as noted above cDNA clones are not suitable for discrimination because, while there may be variation between the strains, there is considerable homology between the strains of various IBV serotypes; (2) although considerable sequence data are available, design of universal IBV-specific primers that can be used for amplification of the Sl gene has not been achieved due to high sequence variability between the strains. Perhaps oligonucleotide hybridization probes based on sequences from the Sl gene would be more likely to discriminate strains belonging to different serotypes.",

The most important is the difficulty in establishing a correlation between the nucleic acid sequences and VN determinants, probably due to the following: (1) the exact location of serotypic determinants remains to be determined; (2) it has been shown that VN epitopes that determine virus serotype are conformation dependent, and are usually formed by non-contiguous amino acids on the polypeptide chain; hence, amino acid changes in distant and different locations may cause changes in serotype of the virus; (3) modification of the proteins such as glycosylation may also cause changes that may not be detectable by nucleic acid probes.
