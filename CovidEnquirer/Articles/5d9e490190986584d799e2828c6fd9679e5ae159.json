            "text": "Bats are reservoirs for a number of highly pathogenic zoonotic viruses, yet they remain relatively asymptomatic during infection. Whether this viral resistance is due to a unique innate immune system is unknown. An evolutionarily conserved feature of vertebrate antiviral immunity is the interferon (IFN) response, which triggers cellular defenses through interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. While bats encode an intact IFN system, global ISG expression patterns in bat cells are not well characterized. Here, we used RNA-Seq to assess the transcriptional response to IFN\u03b1 in cells derived from the bat Pteropus alecto (black flying fox). We show induction of more than 100 transcripts, most of which are canonical ISGs observed in other species. Kinetic gene profiling revealed that P. alecto ISGs fall into two unique temporal subclusters with similar early induction kinetics but distinct late-phase declines. In contrast to bat ISGs, human ISGs generally remained elevated for longer periods following IFN treatment, suggesting host-based differences in gene regulatory mechanisms. Notably, we also identified a small group of non-canonical bat ISGs, including an enzymatically active RNASEL that plays a role in controlling viral infection. These studies provide insight into the innate immune response of an important viral reservoir and lay a foundation for studies into the immunological features that may underlie unique virus-host relationship in bats.",

A recent study identified bats as hosts for a greater proportion of zoonotic viruses than all other mammalian orders tested, with the highest viral richness found in Flavi-, Bunya-and Rhabdoviruses (10) . While the mechanisms underlying disease resistance are not known, it has been speculated that bats possess unique immune components that confer innate antiviral protection (9, 11) . In vertebrates, one of the first lines of defense against viral pathogens is the interferon (IFN) response. Upon viral infection, pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) sense viral components and initiate a signaling cascade that results in the secretion of IFNs. These IFNs bind their cognate receptors to activate the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, leading to the transcriptional induction of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), many of which have antiviral activity (12) .",

Our data set reveal a previously unappreciated subtlety in the temporal induction and regulation of ISG expression. A recent study of IFN-inducible gene kinetics in mouse cells reported a profile that resembles a combination of our SC3 and SC4 data sets (32). Our study further refines this kinetic analysis by delineating two separate ISG pools based on unique temporal induction profiles. While both SCs are characterized by similar peak mRNA levels and a subsequent decline by 12-24 hours, SC4 contained some genes that remained elevated. These genes may offer residual antiviral protection, even when IFN signaling has returned to basal levels. In addition, many genes in SC4 have both higher baseline and higher maximal induction levels in bat cells compared to human cells, which could contribute to species-specific differences in susceptibility to viral infection. Additional studies are needed to explore the mechanisms underlying unique expression of certain ISGs in bats cells.",

It is also possible that canonical bat ISGs have evolved unique effector functions that contribute to reduced viral susceptibility. Uncovering mechanisms of bat ISGs will provide insight into the innate immune responses of an important viral reservoir and may inform research and development of antiviral therapies.",

To test if RNASEL induction played a role in the protective effect of the IFN response, we treated PaKi WT and KO bulk cells with increasing doses of IFN\u03b1 for 24h, then infected with YFV17D-Venus (Fig 5E).Consistent with previous results, KO bulk cells were more permissive to infection than WT cells.In addition, KO bulk cells were resistant to the protective activity of IFN. IFN\u03b1 (100U/mL) pretreatment resulted in 80% reduction of infection in WT cells, but only 50% reduction in bulk KO cells.

In addition, the short RNA fragments created by RNASEL can potentiate the IFN response by activating the cytosolic RNA sensor RIG-I (33). The induction of RNASEL in response to IFN in bats may provide an additional layer of antiviral protection. Indeed, knockout of RNASEL increased viral susceptibility of P. alecto-derived cells. Although RNASEL induction itself does not result in significant nuclease activity, stimulation with poly (I:C) is sufficient to cause degradation of total RNA in the cell. Unlike in humans, where only the upstream OAS proteins are IFN-induced, bat cells co-induce both components of the OAS/RNASEL pathway, likely creating a more rapid and potent effect that would inhibit viral replication before extensive viral spread could occur. RNASEL induction may also be a counterdefense against viruses that subvert the pathway through through various immune evasion mechanisms, such as degradation of RNASEL by L* protein of murine Theiler's virus(34), or increased expression of an RNASEL inhibitor by HIV(35) and EMCV(36).",
