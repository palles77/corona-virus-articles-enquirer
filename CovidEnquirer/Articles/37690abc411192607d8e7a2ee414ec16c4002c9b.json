            "text": "Food insecurity persists in many parts of Africa and Asia, despite ongoing agricultural research for development (AR4D) interventions. This is resulting in a growing demand for alternative approaches to designing and evaluating interventions in complex systems. Theory of Change (ToC) is an approach which may be useful because it enables stakeholders to present and test their theories and assumptions about why and how impact may occur, ideally within an environment conducive to iterative reflection and learning. However, ToC is yet to be appropriately mainstreamed into development by donors, researchers and practitioners. We carried out a literature review, triangulated by interviews with 26 experts in African and Asian food security, consisting of researchers, advisors to programs, and donors. Although 17 (65%) of the experts had adopted ToC, their responses and the literature revealed four challenges to mainstreaming: (i) different interpretations of ToC; (ii) incoherence in relationships among the constituent concepts of ToC; (iii) confused relationships between ToC and project \"logframes\"; and (iv) limitations in necessary skills and commitment for enacting ToC. A case study of the evolution of a ToC in a West African AR4D project over 4 years which exemplified these challenges is presented. Five recommendations arise to assist the mainstreaming of ToC: (i) select a type of ToC suited to the relative complexity of the problem and focal system of interest; (ii) state a theory or hypotheses to be tested as the intervention progresses; (iii) articulate the relationship between the ToC and parallel approaches (e.g. logframe); (iv) accept that a ToC is a process, and (v) allow time and resources for implementers and researchers to develop ToC thinking within projects. Finally, we suggest that communities of practice should be established among AR4D and donor organisations to test, evaluate and improve the contribution that ToCs can make to sustainable food security and agricultural development.",

            "text": "The literature traces the dominant ToC lineage to the field of theorybased evaluation approaches (Vogel, 2012) . These evaluation approaches were introduced over four decades ago to explain how and why an intervention achieved or contributed to impact (Weiss, 1972) , rather than focusing only on measuring whether or not an intervention had achieved stated outputs and outcomes (Chen and Rossi, 1983; Connell and Kubisch, 1998; Pawson and Tilley, 1997; Rogers et al., 2000) . The call for ToC-informed design of interventions was thus triggered by the needs of evaluation practitioners. James (2011) identifies a second contribution to the evolution of ToCthe community development domain's work on participatory approaches (such as Participatory Action Research, action learning and empowerment) that have long advocated for conscious and continuous joint reflection as a catalyst for learning and informed action to bring about positive changes. This strand is also important because it connects ToC to proactive change through single-, double-and triple-loop learning. Single-loop learning refers to modification or incremental improvement of action strategies without questioning the underlying assumptions and goals. Double-loop learning is the revisiting and reframing of assumptions and goals (Argyris and Sch\u00f6n, 1999) . In tripleloop learning, one starts to reconsider underlying values, beliefs and paradigms, because the initial world-view no longer seems to hold (Flood and Romm, 1996; Pahl-Wostl, 2009) .",

Most AR4D interventions have lofty food security and/or agricultural development goals, but often the theories and pathways for how and why the particular intervention would contribute to or achieve impact were not well articulated, encapsulated in design, or tested (Douthwaite et al., 2003) . Kuby (1999) refers to this as the \"missing middle\" or \"output-impact gap.\" Douthwaite et al. (2003) developed Impact Pathways Analysis (IPA) as a version of program theory or ToC (Rogers et al., 2000) that incorporated recent conceptual advances and articulations of the \"missing middle\" and \"attribution gap\" in AR4D. They used the terms \"ToC\" and \"IPA\" interchangeably, but preferred the latter because of the familiarity and pragmatic nature of the term to practitioners working in agricultural research and development interventions (Douthwaite et al., 2003; Douthwaite et al., 2007; Kuby, 1999; Mackay and Horton, 2003; Secretariat, 2000; Springer-Heinze et al., 2003) . More recently, key developers of IPA have made distinctions between IPA and ToC, where the former \"maps out causalitynormally using boxes and arrows\", and the latter \"explains the assumptions behind the arrows\" (Douthwaite et al., 2013) .",

Implementation theory focuses on the necessary steps through which an intervention will be carried out, thereby mirroring IPA. In contrast, program theory focuses on the responses an intervention generates, or the mechanisms of change triggered by the intervention (Pawson and Tilley, 1997; Blamey and Mackenzie, 2007) . These distinctions are important, since most current work on Impact Pathways, and indeed the application of ToC in AR4D, is largely about implementation logic rather than deep reflection on underlying worldviews, assumptions and theories that explain the mechanics that generate the desired changein the manner of triple-loop learning.",

This evolution of development thinking is important and likely to continue, but there are concerns that ToC could simply become another burdensome administrative requirement that brings no substantive change beyond simplistic compliance or \"boxticking\" (e.g. Green, 2012; Valters, 2014) . This paper assesses the challenges and potential solutions to appropriately mainstreaming ToC into the design and evaluation of AR4D interventions. By \"mainstreaming\" we refer to the process of embedding a new concept, principles or an approach into a routine practice of individuals and organisations of relevant domains (McCarthy, 2010) , while recognising that there is no guarantee that the new approach will be institutionalised as originally intended (Squires, 2005) . First, we conducted a literature review, triangulated via interviews with experienced practitioners and donors in the agricultural and development field to ascertain the current understanding and application of ToC (Section 2). Four major challenges to mainstreaming emerging as themes from the analysis of literature and interviews are described in Section 3. We then present a case study of the evolution of ToC practice in an AR4D project in West Africa, which exemplifies several of these challenges (Section 4). We conclude with some recommendations about how ToC can be mainstreamed into AR4D, and its practice refined and improved through ongoing testing, reflection and learning.",

Recently ToC has been increasingly used as an essential part of the process of designing interventions that guides implementation and also informs ex-post impact analysis (Douthwaite et al., 2013) . Stein and Valters (2012) identified a continuum of interpretations of ToC and we found that usage in the literature can be grouped into three broad categories along this continuumdescriptive, explanatory, and reflectiveeach with different implications for ToC practice (Fig. 1) . At the descriptive end of the continuum, ToC is understood as a precise planning tool that extends the \"assumptions\" box in a logframe (Green, 2012) . In the centre of the continuum the explanatory category provides a response to the causal questions of how and why an intervention works, although such explanations often tend to remain technical. The reflective end of the continuum goes deeper and considers that in addition to having technical dimensions, the enabling environment is also critical as development problems have social, institutional and political dimensions which make problems complex. This ToC interpretation promotes complexity-aware and deliberate reflection to identify and challenge paradigms, theories and assumptions on how change will happen through the interplay between an intervention's design and its context.",

Instead, reflective ToC that also facilitates institutional and social changes through explicit doubleand triple-loop learning may be required to achieve impact.",

While this is an important development in theory-informed ToC, a generic ToC underpinned by behavioural change theory is unlikely to be appropriate if the primary mechanism for impact is structural change (e.g. institutions, networks and/or infrastructure) rather than individuals' behaviours and choices. There are many cases where structural change has to precede, or at least must be implemented in parallel with, behavioural change among beneficiaries to achieve desired sustainable development impacts (e.g. Butler et al., 2016; Hounkonnou et al., 2012) . In West Africa, Hounkonnou et al.

Furthermore, more than one theory might be entertained (Funnell and Rogers, 2011) .

Theories possess explanatory and predictive power and use few assumptions as premises or preconditions to generate an integrated set of testable hypotheses. Theories do not generally make assumptions in their conventional meaning (i.e. as statements accepted as true); instead, key assumptions are either supported by evidence (such as from testing of previously existing theories in certain contexts), or the evidence will be produced in the course of testing the theory in other contexts (Nkwake, 2013) . The set of assumptions in a theory must have internal logical consistency, and to be consistent they must be explicit. The process of identifying and questioning key assumptions is crucial for achieving common understanding among stakeholders about how an intervention will generate impact. If conflicting assumptions are not discussed upfront and resolved, they can lead to conflicting expectations from an intervention (Weiss, 2000) . There is considerable subjectivity and a degree of arbitrariness in the identification and selection of assumptions underpinning a ToC. Where assumptions have been stated, they have almost always been external and of an extreme nature (e.g. a civil war does not recur). However, there is another type, known as causal assumptions (Nkwake, 2013) , that are internal and integral to cause and effect relationships involved in bringing impact. For example, in an intervention aimed at improving the nutrition of children, Mayne (2015) identified an assumption that mothers make dietary decisions for their children, and husbands and mothers-in-law are supportive of those decisions. Such a causal assumption is deeply cultural and underlines the potential social complexity of that project's context.",

The primary weakness of the logframe is that it oversimplifies the reality of intervention-outcome/impact relationships, particularly when dealing with complex development issues in which interacting feedback loops may generate unintended effects (Dale, 2003; Hummelbrunner, 2010) . Thus logframes can instil a mistaken belief in predictability and control over how events will unfold during a project (Reeler, 2007) , and fail to deal well with the slow or negative progress typical of the early stages of many types of projects (Bakewell and Garbutt, 2005; Hummelbrunner, 2010; Woolcock, 2009) .",

Green (2012) notes that uses of ToC are currently very top-down, usually drawn up by \"experts\" in the country office, rather than through a participatory, reflective processpresumably to maintain investments of time and other resources within budget. For example, a review by Barrett et al. (2009) noted that many donors expect the CGIAR to perform an impossible task, generating research that delivers large-scale, sustained poverty reduction in a very short time. However, creating these top-down accounts of prospective change that speak more to donor interests than to on-ground realities of the people affected by these interventions is problematic (Douthwaite et al., 2009; Valters, 2014; Thornton et al., 2017) .",

Assumptions were as general as \"social and political stability is maintained at national and regional levels for smooth flow of resources, knowledge and technology\" and targets were as specific as \"at least 50% of producers have a pit manure heap by 2013\". The mismatch between the specificity of assumptions and impact expectations was significant. It was clear that the project team had created the logframe as a top-down process because it was a donor requirement; saw the logframe as a checklist of activities, rather than as a tool to reflect upon and encapsulate a pathway to impact or ToC; and had little conception of a ToC other than as a purely additive structure (i.e. if the listed activities had been conducted and all the assumptions met, then impact would follow).

The team agreed that innovation and adoption of new technologies and practices by producers could only come about through participatory engagement of marketplace actors with producers. As an example, the team developed a causal model for the production and supply of fresh milk (rather than imported powdered milk) to local tourist hotelsincluding the identification of intermediate outcomes across different actors/sectors which lead to the ultimate outcome of increased profitability and well-being for households (Fig. 2) . This analysis was a major step forward from the initial logframe-as-checklist, and represented the beginnings of an explanatory project ToC, in the sense of Fig. 1 .

Had this exercise been developed further before the project closed in 2014, the team could have progressed further along the continuum, using the causal-model thinking as a foundation. However, several factors impeded this evolution. First, the agronomists and animal scientists who dominated the team were unwilling to use their combined years of field experience with producers and marketplace actors to consider social and institutional factors driving human behaviour, and instead determined that only social scientists were capable of doing so. Nonetheless, their learning did begin the establishment of a community of practice within APESS. The second factor was the amount of time required to allow the learning of the team to evolve from single-to double-loop learning, and with it a deeper explanatory ToC approach. In the event, four years were insufficient to enable this evolution to occur. The third factor was the lack of commitment and resources provided by the donor to encourage such an evolution.

An agriculturerelated example was the confusion and panic in the early stages of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or Mad Cow Disease) outbreak in the UK, which was assumed as a known problem that didn't affect humans, but only in retrospect was it found that the agents were prions which could be contracted by humans (French, 2013) . Other examples could be coup d'\u00e9tats, conflicts that lead to genocide, emergence of novel diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), large-scale terror attack such as 9/11, or nuclear accidents such as Chornobyl (French, 2013; Lazaroff and Snowden, 2006; Snowden and Boone, 2007; Tadros and Allouche, 2017) . There is no a priori ToC that can be applied to chaotic situations, other than rapid top-down action which is necessary to create a central attractor for stability. Real time and rapid learning is necessary to sense any signal of pattern emerging from the action and to respond adaptively (French, 2013; Hummelbrunner and Jones, 2013; Lazaroff and Snowden, 2006) .",

A complex food security problem may be treated by some stakeholders as complicated or even a simple farming productivity issue (Foran et al., 2014) . The reasons for varying stakeholder perceptions may include a desire to advance a particular pathway or a specific technology, or a donor's desire to see tangible results in a hurry. Several authors have reported the unsatisfactory outcome of problem oversimplification (Hummelbrunner, 2010; Ramalingam, 2013) . Resultsbased approaches that instil unrealistic certainty of outcomes encourage aid recipients to neglect hard and complex problems that may not show immediate and visible outcomes (Reeler, 2007) . Even in organisations with extensive experience of AR4D, attempts to apply reflective ToC to complex problems with long time horizons have been met with misunderstanding and apprehension (Douthwaite and Hoffecker, 2017) . In chaotic emergency situations decisive and rapid top down responses may be imperative in the short term to stabilise an unmanageable situation. However, there is a danger that responses in such circumstances often persist, even when the challenge has changed to a complex or complicated system which requires a different approach (Adams, 2017; Snowden and Boone, 2007) .",
