Among three graph partition algorithms, the Guimera's simulated annealing method is chosen to study the details of topology structure and other properties of this cellular signaling network, as it shows the best performance. To reveal the underlying biological implications, further investigation is conducted on ad hoc community and sketch map of individual community is drawn accordingly.

These researchers believe that no matter how complex this machine could be, the mystery of which shall be ultimately unveiled by investigating its every separate part. Evidently this is a philosophy of reduction. Accordingly, last century's life science is a typical experiment discipline adopting the strategy of ''divide and conquer''. However, along with the accomplishment of Human Genome Project and the advent of Post-Genome era, scientists gradually recognize that life is not an automata but a complex system following rules much different from reductionism (Kitano, 2002) .",

The molecular foundation of this nonlinearity is the generic and intricate interactions among all sorts of biomacromolecules, genes and proteins. Moreover, these biomacromolecules never behave or perform their biological functions alone, but have many direct or indirect relations between each other, which could be in physical or chemical manner. It is these relations that bring about various biological networks, such as metabolic network, gene regulation network, and signal transduction network, etc. Ultimately, all activities of life fall back on these networks in their structure and function (Maslov and Sneppen, 2002) .",

This is much different from the computer-generated scale-free networks, in which the most common nodes are terminals. The reason of this difference may lie in that the surface area of living cells is finite and the type of terminals or membrane proteins is also limited. The reception, procession and emission of signals are frequently performed in the form of coding (Buck, 2000; Buck and Axel, 1991) , not in simple linear form such like receptor A only receives signal a, then transmits to the next node B, till reaches the information processing center, where decisions are made. The practical Fig. 2 . To test the performance of these methods, random networks with known community structure are built. Each test network comprises 128 nodes divided into 4 communities of 32 nodes, with the average degree of a vertex equal to 16.The x-axis is the fraction of vertices that are classified by the algorithm into their correct communities and the y-axis is the fraction of inter-community edges. Supposing a vertex has 8 intercommunity edges, the fraction of inter-community edges of this vertex is 0.5, which also means 50 percent of a vertex's total links is intercommunity. HC is the abbreviation of standard hierarchical clustering, GN stands for Girvan-Newman algorithm and SA is for Guimera's simulated annealing method. As it shows, the performance of standard hierarchical clustering (squares) is far inferior to that of GN algorithm (diamonds). Meanwhile, the Guimera's Simulated Annealing method (circles) shows the best performance among the three. Fig. 3 . The circles represent the degree distribution of the signaling network discussed in this study, which has 931 nodes and 6798 edges. The stars represent that of a random network of same size. To avoid random fluctuation, each point is an average over 100 realizations. For example, if there are 4600 nodes with degree equal to 10 in the 100 experiments altogether, the expectation number of nodes with degree equal to 10 is 46. Fig. 4 . The circles represent the degree distribution of the signaling network discussed in this study. The stars show a trend-line whose g equals to 2.2. To improve the quality of the plot, the coordinate is switched from linear scale to logarithmic scale, although not essential to reveal the power-law in the degree distribution. situation is usually that a group of similar or identical receptors could receive and emit different signals, according to the different location, number and excitation time of activated receptors.

Besides the difference in evolution mechanism, another possible reason for this small exponent could be the general existence of decentralized decision-making in organisms, which dramatically decreases the quantity of hub proteins that have enormous neighbors. To explain this, we construct another 100 scalefree networks comprising 931 nodes and 6798 edges, following the same evolution mechanism defined in classical BA model. In these networks, the hub node with most neighbors has 106 links to other nodes. If we construct enough more scale-free networks of this kind, a star network would theoretically emerge, in which all terminal nodes link to the central hub to have its degree equal to 930. At that time, computing the degree distribution of all these computer-generated networks, we would find the exponent g to be exactly 3. However, in organisms, this situation will never occur.",

Result shows that it has 14 communities in total (Fig. 6A) . Comprising too much nodes, Fig. 6A is not clear enough for direct observation. By shrinking all nodes in the same community into one node, Fig. 6A is transformed to Fig. 6B . With the size of nodes proportionate to the number of its constituent proteins and the thickness of edges proportionate to the number of intercommunity links, it has only 14 nodes and 32 edges, which clearly reveals the relationships between those communities. To learn the detail of the inward-relationships of those communities, we conduct further investigation on the constitution of individual community. (Batagelj and Mrvar, 1998) .

Firstly, constructs a cellular signaling network of H. sapiens from KEGG and conducts regular static geometric analysis on this network; then, compares three community detection algorithms and studies the topology of the signaling network accordingly; finally, discusses the biological implication of community structure and its potential influence in basic research and drug discovery.",

For instance, 11317 and 3516 are homologs of protein CSL; 4851, 4853, 4854 and 4855 are homologs of protein Notch, etc. By shrinking homologs, we draw a sketch map of this community",
