Methods: After translation, the psychometric properties of the Chinese WAAQ were analyzed among 417 nurses, and content validity was determined by six experts. Results: Item-level content validity index (CVI) values were between 0.83 and 1.00; scale-level CVI/universal agreement (S-CVI/UA) and S-CVI/average were 0.86 and 0.98, respectively, which implicated a good content validity. The correlation of the Chinese WAAQ with AAQ-II (r s = \u22120.247, P < 0.001) suggested criterion validity, and those with General Health Questionnaire-12 (\u22120.250, <0.001) and general self-efficacy scale (0.491, <0.001) and Utrecht work engagement scale (UWES) (0.439, <0.001) suggested convergent validity. Exploratory factor analysis identified a seven-item, one-factor structure of WAAQ. The Chinese version of WAAQ had high internal consistency (Cronbach's \u03b1 = 0.920), with an item-total correlation coefficient of 0.702-0.828 (P < 0.05), split-half reliability of 0.933, and test-retest reliability of 0.772. Conclusions: The Chinese WAAQ is a reliable and valid tool for assessing psychological flexibility in Chinese oncology nurses.",

[1] There is a significantly positive correlation between burnout and psychological symptoms (depression, anxiety, and stress) in nurses. [2, 3] In nurses working in Norway, the prevalence of anxiety and depression has been reported to be 19.2% and 8.4%, respectively, [4] which is higher than that of the adults in Nepal (16.1% and 4.2%). [5] A high incidence of anxiety, depression, and stress has been reported in nurses working in China and Hong Kong. [6, 7] Furthermore, the prevalence of \"burnout syndrome\" is significantly higher among oncology nurses than among surgical nurses. [8] Furthermore, oncology nurses have high levels of emotional exhaustion, and a large proportion of them are at risk of developing burnout. [9, 10] However, burnout and mental health of nurses are strongly associated with the quality of patient care. [11] [12] [13] Noben et al. conducted a cost-benefit analysis of mental health programs for hospital nurses. They concluded that offering preventive intervention represents a favorable business case as seen from the employer's perspective. [14] A stress-reduced program based on mindfulness meditation was reported to improve stress, burnout, depression, and anxiety significantly. [15] Therefore, focus on nurses' mental health, as well as reducing the prevalence of burnout of nursing staff, is valuable.",

            "text": "Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is the \"third wave\" of behavioral and cognitive theory based on acceptance and mindfulness. ACT interventions aim at increasing \"psychological flexibility,\" which is the core concept of the ACT model of psychological health and behavioral effectiveness.Psychological flexibility is closely connected with individuals' internal experiences, which could have great impact on psychological and physical function. With satisfying psychological flexibility, individuals could respond to negative thoughts, feelings, and events, thereby improve their well-being flexibly. [16] [17] [18] ACT treatment involves six core processes (acceptance, cognitive defusion, self-as-context, being present, value, committed action), and acceptance, cognitive defusion, self-as-context, and being present belong to the acceptance and mindfulness process. ACT is becoming an increasingly popular approach that has been applied widely to treat anxiety, [19] depression, [20] diabetes mellitus, [21] chronic pain, [22] cancer, [23] and obesity. [24] The process goal of ACT in those treatments is to enhance the psychological flexibility of participants and finally to achieve better health status. Psychological flexibility was measured by the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ) [25] and its revised version (AAQ-II). [26] Then, measures of psychological flexibility in specific thoughts were developed, such as the Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire (CPAQ-20 and CPAQ-8). [27] Bond et al. found psychological flexibility to be correlated with work-related outcomes, including mental health, better job performance, increased capacity to learn skills at work, and a lower prevalence of absence from work. [28] In 2013, Bond et al. developed the work-related AAQ (WAAQ), and then validated its good reliability and validity (mean coefficient = 0.83). [29] The WAAQ has also been validated for employees in Spanish, and good psychometric properties have been reported. [30] A validated Chinese version of WAAQ is needed to measure psychological flexibility as an assessment in mental health and job performance in workplaces among Chinese individuals.",

            "text": "Over the past decade, experimental and longitudinal studies have shown that psychological flexibility is an important determinant of mental health and behavioral effectiveness in the workplace. Higher levels of psychological flexibility correlate with better mental health, better job performance, and an increased capacity to learn skills at work. [28, 50] ACT interventions can improve employees' mental health, increase innovation, and reduce the risk of burnout by increasing their psychological flexibility. Reliable and valid instruments are needed to further explore psychological flexibility in the workplace. The WAAQ is an instrument that enables assessment of psychological flexibility among individuals in a work context. The present study showed the psychometric properties of the WAAQ among Chinese nurses working in a cancer hospital. Our data suggest that the Chinese version of the WAAQ had satisfactory reliability and validity in our sample of nurses. EFA helped us to identify a seven-item, one-factor structure of work-related psychological flexibility, a result that is in accordance with earlier studies. [29, 30] Our findings revealed good reliability for internal consistency for the WAAQ, as demonstrated by Cronbach's \u03b1 coefficients (0.920 for the total scale) and item-total correlation coefficients (0.786-0.878). The odd-even split-half reliability is commonly used which helps to avoid some of the potential biases that arise from simply dividing the measurement procedure into two. The odd-even split-half reliability coefficient is 0.933, which is generally considered to be satisfied. High test-retest reliability over 2-4 weeks (r = 0.772) was also found. These findings are consistent with previous studies. [29] For example, the Spanish translation of the WAAQ resulted in a Cronbach's \u03b1 coefficient of 0.92 and item-total correlations of 0.65-0.81. [30] To assess the criterion and convergent validity of the WAAQ, the correlation between the WAAQ and the AAQ-II, GSES, UWES, and GHQ-12 were examined. The correlation between the WAAQ and AAQ-II was small to moderate, which suggests that both instruments are assessing related constructs, but the correlation is not so high as to suggest that they are assessing the same one. Moreover, the AAQ-II showed lower correlations than the WAAQ with work engagement as measured by the UWES and self-efficacy as measured by the GSES. These findings demonstrated that a work-specific measure of psychological flexibility was more strongly associated with work-related outcomes than a general measure of the same construct. These data replicate the outcomes found by Bond et al. [29] and Ruiz and Odriozola-Gonz\u00e1lez [30] which support the hypothesis that psychological flexibility is related to a specific context as well. However, the AAQ-II showed higher correlations than the WAAQ with psychological distress as measured by the GHQ-12, which may have been because the AAQ-II is a general measure of psychological flexibility. This outcome was different to that elicited previously, possibly because of the features of our study sample. Furthermore, the mean scores of each item in the Chinese version of the WAAQ were lower than those found in the Spanish version, which suggests that the psychological flexibility of the oncology nurses was poor. The Chinese version of WAAQ can measure the psychological flexibility for oncology nurses in workplace. Therefore, the nursing administrators can have some insight into the psychological status of oncology nurses to pay more attention to their mental health in the future.",
