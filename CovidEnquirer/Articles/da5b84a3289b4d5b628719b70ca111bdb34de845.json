These viruses are responsible for approximately 4% to 8% of pneumonia cases in healthy adults, and higher rates were found during outbreaks and epidemics. 9, 10 Influenza A can be disseminated by aerosols and affect the entire respiratory tract. Commonly, it is the most virulent serotype, comprising a number of other subtypes. Influenza B usually causes disease in populations confined to closed spaces, such as daycare centers and boarding schools. Influenza C is the least common serotype, and is found as pathogenic agent in sporadic reports. 10 Influenza viruses A and B are responsible for approximately 50% of community-acquired viral pneumonia in adults. Their impact is greater in the elderly and other at-risk populations such as pregnant women, immunocompromised patients, and patients with chronic diseases, especially heart and lung diseases. 10 Recently, a subtype of influenza A, H1N1, known as the swine-flu agent, has emerged as an important and threatening pandemic, severely affecting immunosuppressed patients such as transplant recipients and other high-risk populations such as pregnant women, obese patients, and those with heart and lung disease. The affected individuals were generally younger than those affected by seasonal influenza. 11, 12 It has been estimated that there were approximately 16,226 deaths from April 2009 to January 2010 according to estimates by the World Health Organization. In Brazil, 10% to 30% of the admitted patients required admission to an intensive care unit, and of the total, 60% to 88% required mechanical ventilation. The mortality rate for H1N1 in the country was 70 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants. 12, 13 Infection by the influenza virus leads to cell death, especially in the upper airways. When the virus infects the lower airways directly, there may be bleeding without proportional accumulation of inflammatory cells. There is also mucociliary clearance impairment, which may determine bacterial adherence to the respiratory epithelium. Impaired function of T-cells, macrophages, and neutrophils also occurs, which leads to decreased host defenses. All these events together facilitate the frequently observed concomitant bacterial infection. 14 The incubation period is one to two days and symptoms typically last three to five days. There are three clinical presentations: primary influenza pneumonia, influenza infection with secondary bacterial pneumonia, and simultaneous coinfection (viral and bacterial). 14 Primary pneumonia manifests as persistent cough, pain in the throat, headache and myalgia for over five days, associated with the onset of progressive dyspnea and cyanosis. This is the less common, albeit more severe, presentation. Influenza pneumonia with secondary bacterial infection is characterized by intensification of high fever, cough, and purulent sputum after initial improvement, associated with the appearance of new opacities on chest radiography. The main agents involved are Streptococcus pneumoniae (48%), Staphylococcus aureus, and Haemophilus influenzae. Pneumonia caused by viral and bacterial coinfection manifests similarly to pneumonia with secondary bacterial infection, but there is no initial improvement. In this context, both the virus and the bacterial agent are isolated together in the microbiological analysis. 14 Inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein and procalcitonin are also of little use when differentiating between bacterial and viral pneumonia, as the most severe cases, as observed in the H1N1 pandemic, showed high levels of these two substances in patients with viral pneumonia. 15",

They work by blocking the ion channels of the viral M2 protein and inhibit its decapsulation. Its use should be indicated within 48 hours of symptom onset in uncomplicated cases, but its effectiveness has not been tested in severe pneumonia. Furthermore, many strains are now resistant to these drugs, thus they should not be recommended as an empirical single-drug therapy. 3 Oseltamivir and zanamivir are drugs that block the surface protein neuraminidase and trap the virus within the infected respiratory epithelium, preventing its dissemination. They too should be preferably administered within 48 hours of symptom onset. They are active against influenza A and B, and have low potential to induce resistance, although some cases have been described in the United States during the H1N1 pandemic. In cases of severe pneumonia, medication can be provided even after 48 hours of symptom onset. 18 When there is potentially fatal respiratory failure, as in many cases of the H1N1 pandemic, rescue maneuvers for refractory hypoxemia, such as recruitment and ventilation in the prone position, may be instituted in combination with antiviral therapy. 19",

RSV is highly contagious, spreading through droplets and fomites. The population at risk consists mainly of children younger than six months; patients with chronic diseases, such as cystic fibrosis; patients with congenital heart disease; institutionalized elderly individuals; and immunosuppressed patients. 21 The overall mortality in adults varies according to the immune status, from 1% to 5% in healthy adults to 41% in bone marrow transplant recipients. 22 viruses A and B (85% to 100%), but low sensitivity (40% to 80%). It is noteworthy that in suspected H5N1 cases, this test is not recommended, as the RT-PCR analysis has greater diagnostic usefulness. Histological assessment is another possible diagnostic option, achieved by ultrastructural analysis through lung biopsy. 17 The treatment must be performed with supportive measures such as supplemental oxygen, analgesics, antipyretics, and antiviral therapy in selected cases. The drugs approved for the treatment of influenza infection are amantadine, rimantadine, oseltamivir, and zanamivir (Table 2 ). 17 RSV is rarely diagnosed in adults. The infection is characterized by persistent symptoms in the upper airways, such as runny nose, earache, and sore throat, associated with prolonged cough (whether dry or productive), dyspnea, and wheezing; it may cause bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and severe pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation. Compared to the influenza virus infection, a higher frequency of rhinorrhea and purulent sputum is observed, as well as a lower frequency of fever and gastrointestinal symptoms. 23 Some inflammatory markers obtained from airways and blood, such as soluble intercellular adhesion molecule type I (sICAM-1), interleukin 10 (IL-10), and IL-6 were tested in children and appear to show a positive correlation, at higher concentrations, with the severity and duration of hospitalization. 24 The pulmonary radiological findings associated with RSV infection are nonspecific; bilateral alveolar opacities and interstitial alterations are described in most cases, similar to those observed in influenza virus infection. 21, 22 The virus can be isolated in culture, where the highest yield is found in samples of nasopharyngeal lavage and tracheal secretions. In immunosuppressed patients, a positive culture is found in up to 15% of nasopharyngeal lavage samples, in up to 71% of tracheal secretions, and in up to 89% of bronchoalveolar lavage. Rapid tests for detection of viral antigens have a sensitivity of 50% to 90% and a high specificity (90%-95%). Gene amplification with RT-PCR is also available. 23 Ribavirin works by preventing viral transcription and is the only currently available antiviral drug for the treatment of RSV pneumonia ( Table 2 ). The current recommendation is that the medication should only considered for severe cases or in patients at high risk of complications. Intravenous immunoglobulin specific for RSV (palivizumab) can also be used in combination with ribavirin in critically-ill patients and those at high risk for complications, especially in bone marrow transplant recipients. 24",

Adenovirus infection can occur at any time of the year, accounting for approximately 10% of pneumonias in children. Historically, this virus is also identified as an important causative agent of respiratory infection outbreaks in military bases in the United States. 25 Its serotypes are classified into seven subgroups or species (A to G), and pulmonary infections are caused predominantly by serotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 14, and 21. Although it is a virus that determines low mortality, subtype 14 can cause severe respiratory failure in susceptible patients, such as solid-organ transplant recipients, individuals with HIV infection, and patients with other types of impaired cell immunity, although there are reports of fatal cases in the postoperative period after cardiac surgery in previously immunocompetent patients. 26 Adenovirus dissemination occurs by direct inoculation into the conjunctiva, aerosol, feces, and fomites; the virus is capable of surviving in contaminated areas of the environment for several weeks. Viral reactivation can also occur in immunosuppressed patients, resulting in several clinical syndromes, including keratoconjunctivitis, gastroenteritis, hepatitis, and hemorrhagic cystitis, associated or not with pneumonia. Pneumonia mortality rates range from 38% to 100%, especially in bone marrow transplant recipients. 27 The clinical picture is characterized by fever, cough, runny nose, sore throat, tonsillitis, and otitis media, with a mean duration of three to five days. Leukocytosis and elevated inflammatory activity can be observed, and it is important to differentiate from bacterial infections. Pulmonary opacities are often reticulonodular in radiological images, but consolidations can also be observed. 27, 28 Respiratory secretion cultures can be performed to confirm the diagnosis, which can be demonstrated by cytopathic effects two to 20 days after onset. Serotype 14 can be diagnosed by rapid antigen detection and PCR techniques, especially in immunosuppressed patients. 27, 28 There are no controlled studies regarding the best treatment option, or which drug is more adequate for each specific clinical syndrome. Thus, the use of antivirals is based on recommendation from experts and case reports. The drugs that can be used are ribavirin, cidofovir, ganciclovir, and vidarabine, with a larger number of reports favoring the combined therapy with cidofovir/ ribavirin, especially in patients with a history of unfavorable evolution and bone marrow transplantation ( Table 2 ). 28",

This virus is the second most common cause of viral infection in children, accounting for approximately 30% to 40% of respiratory infections; it is also identified as a causative agent of pneumonia in adults (mainly HPIV serotypes 1 and 3). Transmission can occur through direct contact with the infected host, by respiratory droplets, or by fomites. 29 Once installed, the infection causes the secretion of high levels of inflammatory cytokines such as interferon alpha, IL-2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). These mediators are responsible for the abundant production of mucus in the respiratory epithelium, submucosal edema, and vocal cords, which can determine the partial obstruction of the upper airway and the characteristic stridor of this disease. 29 The incubation period lasts one to three days and the characteristic symptoms of croup, such as hoarseness and stridor (steeple sign), common in children, are less prevalent in immunocompetent adults. HPIV-3 is the primary strain causing bronchiolitis and pneumonia, leading to the onset of nonspecific symptoms such as fever, runny nose, wheezing, dry cough, and dyspnea. The symptoms can mimic a number of other respiratory infections, especially in immunosuppressed individuals; the identification of marked upper airway involvement, such as sinusitis and stridor, is an important clue for diagnosis. Reports of bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia and giant-cell pneumonia have also been described after infection by this agent. 29 From the radiological point of view, the alterations often observed are the focal alveolar opacities, although a diffuse interstitial pattern has also been described. A previous study showed that infection may be associated with the presence of multiple noncavitated nodules < 5 mm with peribronchial distribution. 29, 30 Isolation by culture can be carried out preferably in nasal secretions. RT-PCR is the faster and most sensitive diagnostic method. 29, 30 Supportive care is usually enough, and specific therapy should be recommended only for patients at high risk or with severe symptoms. In these cases, the agent of choice, based on in vitro study and a case study, is oral or aerosolized ribavirin ( Table 2 ). 31",

This virus belongs to the same family as RSV and HPIV, is usually acquired in early childhood, and causes bronchiolitis, croup, and pneumonia. Reinfection can occur in adulthood, with the most severe cases affecting the elderly, individuals with heart and lung disease, and immunocompromised patients. The incubation period is approximately five days; the clinical picture is similar to that of other viruses, with nasal congestion, coughing, wheezing, fever, and dyspnea. Hoarseness is the most common finding in RSV infection. Chest images show bilateral alveolar opacities in 43% of cases, and nodular opacities and pleural effusion can also occur. It is a difficult virus to isolate in cultures, with extremely slow replication rates. RT-PCR is the method of choice for the diagnosis. 33 The treatment is yet to be well established, but the use of ribavirin alone or in combination with immunoglobulin appears to be promising in more severe cases. 34 Coronaviruses have been recognized as causing pneumonia after a serious epidemic in China during 2003. Four human subtypes have been recognized: HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1. The incubation period of coronavirus-associated infection is of two to five days; the most common symptoms are myalgia, chills, and dyspnea, with possible progression to respiratory failure, while fever is uncommon. Other findings that may be observed are thrombocytopenia, elevated levels of transaminases, and D-dimer. The radiological pattern is nonspecific, commonly demonstrating diffuse pulmonary ground-glass opacities on chest tomography. Cases of pneumomediastinum have also been reported. 35, 36 In cases of severe outcome, protease inhibitors, such as lopinavir and ritonavir, and interferonalpha and -beta can be administered. There is no evidence of efficacy for ribavirin use. 37 The Rhinovirus, a member of the Picornaviridae family, is the major cause of colds in the general population, and it is the second most prevalent agent as the cause of bronchiolitis in the pediatric population -in some studies, it has been shown to be the agent more often related to exacerbations in asthmatic children. 38 Although controversial, some studies have shown a prevalence of this virus in up to 30% of cases of severe pneumonia hospitalized in intensive care. 39 The diagnosis is difficult; it is attained through PCR techniques, as other methods (such as serological tests and cultures) are not feasible, and the rapid detection of antigens is not standardized. 40",

Together with the greater possibility of diagnosing viral infections, it will be feasible not only to increase the knowledge on epidemiological profile of viral community-acquired pneumonia, but also to plan better therapeutic and prevention strategies for society.",
