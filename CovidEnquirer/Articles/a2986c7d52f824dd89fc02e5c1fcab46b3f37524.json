            "text": "SARS is an acute respiratory disease from infection of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that spreads mainly through the respiratory route ( 1 -3 ) , with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the only known functional receptor ( 4 ) . One of the clinical features in SARS infection is continuous deterioration of lung function and the obvious loss of lung repair capacity after viral load has declined ( 5 ) . However, the pathogenesis for SARS-CoV infection, for which characterizing the nature of virus-infected cells is crucial, is still ill-defi ned. Reports in the literature regarding the identity of SARS \u03e9 cells are unconvincing either because no colocalization study was performed or because of technical limitations. Results in the literature are also inconsistent in that some reports suggested type I pneumocytes, whereas others suggested type II pneumocytes, as the major target in humans and in simian models ( 6 -11 ) . It has also been implied that these SARS \u03e9 cells express cytokeratin, whether they are described as type I or type II cells ( 6 -10, 12 ) . It is also a concern that none of these reports demonstrated colocalization of ACE2 expression with SARSinfected cells. Using multicolor colocalization techniques, we previously reported that cells containing SARS-CoV antigen in the autopsy lung of SARS patients expressed ACE2 and liver/lymph node -specifi c ICAM-3 -grabbing non-integrin (L-SIGN; CD209L) ( 13 ) . L-SIGN is a SARS-CoV binding receptor that mediates proteasome-dependent viral degradation and is expressed in cytokeratin \u03e9 respiratory epithelia (Fig. S1 , available at http://www.jem.org/cgi/ content/full/jem.20070462/DC1) (13) . L-SIGN can also facilitate SARS-CoV infection/replication in trans ( 13 ) . In this study, we further characterize the SARS-infected cells and show that a novel subset of putative stem/progenitor CD34 \u03e9 Oct-4 \u03e9 cells are the only cells expressing ACE2 in the human lung and are the major target for SARS-CoV infection.",

We found that the SARS antigen could be detected in six patients who died within 11 d after illness onset, but not in the other three patients who died 21, 24, or 27 d after disease onset ( Table I ) , which is consistent with a recent report showing that SARS antigen or RNA could not be detected in patients who died \u03fe2 wk after disease onset ( 11 ) . In samples where SARS antigen was detected, as many as 42 SARS \u03e9 cells in a microscopic fi eld (400\u03eb) were identifi ed ( Table I ) . By location, SARS \u03e9 cells were found in the alveoli ( Fig. 1 , a and b, and d and e , red) and the bronchiolar lining layer ( Fig.  1 , j and k , red). By morphology, SARS \u03e9 cells were round or oval in shape and rich in cytoplasm ( Fig. 1, b , d, e, j, and k ). Furthermore, SARS \u03e9 cells did not express surfactant A, a type II pneumocyte marker ( Fig. 1, a, b , d, and j , brown), or cytokeratin ( Fig. 1 , e and k , green). SARS \u03e9 cells did not express surfactant C (also a type II pneumocyte marker) or T1 \u2423 (a type I pneumocyte marker) either (Fig. S2 , available at http://www .jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20070462/DC1). Because bronchial/bronchiolar lining layers are composed of multiple cell types that are compactly arranged, some SARS \u03e9 cells were \" overlapping \" with adjacent cytokeratin \u03e9 cells (e.g., one indicated by a circle, Fig. 1 k and Fig. S3 ), which could be mistakenly interpreted as \" colocalized \" on two-dimensional images.

Results showed that the SARS \u03e9 cells did not express tryptase, defensins 1/2/3, CD15, CD68, CD57, CD45RO, CD3, and CD20, indicating that they were not mast cells, neutrophils, macrophages/monocytes, NK, T, or B cells (Fig. S5 , available at http://www.jem.org/ cgi/content/full/jem.20070462/DC1). We next examined the markers for other cell types. CD34 is expressed by hematopoietic progenitors in the circulation ( 19 ) and also by bone marrow stromal cell precursors ( 20 ) . By a four-color sequential IHC and simultaneous fl uorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and ISH study, we demonstrated that SARS \u03e9 cells ( Fig. 2 a , red) were distinct from cells expressing the macrophage/monocyte-specifi c marker CD68 ( Fig. 2 a , brown) , and the SARS \u03e9 cells expressed the only known functional receptor ACE2 ( Fig. 2 b , green) as well as the stem/progenitor cell marker CD34 ( Fig. 2 c , purple). Similar observations were made in the bronchioles, i.e., SARS \u03e9 cells expressed both ACE2 and CD34 (Fig. S6 ). In a separate sequential IHC/ FISH/ISH study, SARS \u03e9 cells ( Fig. 2 i , red) expressed CD34 ( Fig. 2 j , green) and another stem/progenitor cell marker, Oct-4 ( Fig. 2 k , purple). Oct-4 is a transcription factor, and its activity is essential for maintaining pluripotency of the some of previous reports the identity of the SARS \u03e9 cells was judged by morphology or location alone without colocalization with specifi c markers to confi rm the phenotype ( 6, 7, 10 ) . In addition, these reports used avidin -biotin complex for SARS-CoV or cytokeratin staining ( 6, 7, 10 ) . Biotin is widely dispersed in mammalian tissues ( 15 -17 ) , and the presence of endogenous biotin is likely to result in false-positive readings, even after blocking procedures before immunodetection ( 18 ) . Experiences with this problem have also been encountered in our lab (Fig. S4 , available at http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/ full/jem.20070462/DC1). In other reports, the double-color results for colocalization either could not be clearly diff erentiated from single-color staining ( 8, 9 ) or were interfered by autofl uorescence ( 11, 12 ) or by hematoxylin counterstaining ( 9 ) . It is also a concern that none of these reports demonstrates the colocalization of ACE2 expression with the SARS \u03e9 cells.",

Panels of each row represent results on the same section of a patient. Results are representative of six SARS patients. Bar, 20 m. express ACE2 but not cytokeratin; however, only the latter contain SARS-CoV antigen in the SARS lung. We also note that the frequency of CD34 \u03e9 cells in the non-SARS lung appears to be higher than that of SARS \u03e9 cells in the SARS samples. However, these numbers cannot be directly compared because the non-SARS lung samples were from lung cancer patients, which may not represent the situations in healthy individuals who have no lung pathology. Furthermore, it is still unclear how the frequency of these putative stem/progenitor cells is regulated, for example, in cancers.",

After 16 h, the ex vivoinfected tissue blocks were fi xed and embedded for IHC-FISH-ISH study. Results showed that though few in number, SARS \u03e9 cells were identifi ed in samples from four patients ( Fig.  3 B , b and c, red, and Figs. S8 and S9, which are available at http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20070462/DC1). Consistently, these four patients also had detectable CD34 \u03e9 Oct-4 \u03e9 cells in the fresh samples studied immediately upon collection ( Table II ) . Furthermore, in line with observations in the SARS-infected lung, the SARS antigen ( Fig. 3 B , b and c, red, and Fig. S8 ) was not colocalized with surfactant A ( Fig. 3  B , b, brown, and Fig. S8 ). SARS \u03e9 cells could be clearly visualized under a fl uorescence microscope before FISH study ( Fig. 3 B , c) . After FISH/ISH study, SARS \u03e9 cells indeed mammalian embryonic cells ( 21, 22 ) . Such observations were made in all lung samples from patients recruited for this study who died within 11 d after illness onset ( Table I ) . We thus conclude that the majority of SARS \u03e9 cells in the SARS lung were a subset of putative stem/progenitor cells expressing CD34, Oct-4, and ACE2.",

However, in contrast to the diff usely intra-cytoplasmic staining in SARS \u03e9 CD34 \u03e9 cells, the viral staining in CD68 \u03e9 cells was usually granular ( Fig. 2 a vs.  Fig. S7) , suggesting that the mechanism(s) by which SARS antigen enters CD34 \u03e9 and CD68 \u03e9 cells may be diff erent. Because CD68 \u03e9 cells did not express the functional receptor ACE2 ( Fig. 2 ) , we regard that the presence of viral antigen in CD68 \u03e9 cells is most likely due to phagocytosis.",

            "text": "To determine if ACE2 \u03e9 CD34 \u03e9 Oct4 \u03e9 cells could be found in non-SARS lung, lung tissues from 14 lung cancer patients who had no SARS infection ( Table II ) were examined. Eight of these patients were retrieved from our archive. The other six were additionally enrolled to obtain fresh lung tissues, part of which was immediately fi xed, embedded, and sectioned for IHC-FISH-ISH study upon collection, and the other part was used for ex vivo infection experiments (described below). Results showed that ACE2 signals were detectable in samples from 8 of 14 lung cancer patients, but not in the others ( Table II ) . In these eight patients, we found that consistent with our fi ndings in the SARS lung, ACE2 ( Fig. 3 A , b , f, and n, green) was not expressed by surfactant A \u03e9 cells ( Fig. 3 A , a, e, i, and m, brown; each row represents results from a patient) but was expressed by CD34 \u03e9 cells ( Fig. 3 A , c and j, purple or green). For better diff erentiation between alveolar and vascular lumens, an endothelial cell marker, CD31, was used to depict blood vessels ( Fig. 3 A , a -c, red) . We showed that cytokeratin \u03e9 cells ( Fig. 3 A , e, f, m, and n, red) did not express ACE2 either ( Fig. 3 A , f and n, green) . Furthermore, CD34 expression ( Fig. 3 A , j, green) was colocalized with Oct-4 ( Fig. 3 A , k, purple) . Interestingly, these ACE2 \u03e9 CD34 \u03e9 Oct4 \u03e9 cells did not express CD15 (i.e., SSEA-1), another marker for stem/progenitor cells ( Fig. 3 A , i, j, and k, red) . We also found that in line with our previous report ( 13 ), ACE2 \u03e9 cells ( Fig. 3 A , n, green) also expressed L-SIGN ( Fig. 3 A , p, purple) , a binding receptor for SARS-CoV. In the lung samples from these eight patients, the number of CD34 \u03e9 cells was identifi ed from 2 to 72 per microscopic fi eld (400\u03eb) ( Table II ) . Therefore, ACE2 \u03e9 CD34 \u03e9 Oct4 \u03e9 L-SIGN \u03e9 cells are also present in the lung of some non-SARS individuals. Together with our previous fi ndings (reference 13 and Fig. S1 ), we also conclude that the binding receptor L-SIGN is expressed by at least two cell types in the non-SARS lung: cytokeratin \u03e9 ACE2 \u2212 bronchial/bronchiolar epithelial cells and CD34 \u03e9 Oct4 \u03e9 cells that , followed by FISH for ACE2 (green labeling in b, some indicated by green arrows) and ISH for CD34 (purple labeling in c, some indicated by light blue arrows).

Whether or not our fi ndings may contribute to the above clinical observation deserves further study.

Recently, a subset of pulmonary Oct-4 \u03e9 stem/progenitor cells that could diff erentiate into pneumocytes has been isolated from neonatal mouse lung ( 14 ) . Of signifi cance, these mouse stem/progenitor cells express ACE2 and are susceptible to SARS-CoV infection and replication in vitro ( 14 ) , which at least in part supports our fi ndings. In the adult mouse lung, CD34 \u03e9 bronchioalveolar stem cells (BASCs) that can diff erentiate into alveolar epithelia have also been isolated ( 25 ) . The phenotype of the novel cell subset we identifi ed in the human lung, however, is not entirely compatible to those known mouse lung stem/progenitor cells. For example, the Oct-4 \u03e9 stem/progenitor cells isolated from the neonatal mouse lung express cytokeratin and CD15 (i.e., SSEA-1) ( 14 ), whereas our cells do not ( Fig. 3 ) . The BASCs identifi ed in the adult mouse lung express surfactant ( 25 ), which is undetectable in our cells. In addition, instead of being at the bronchioalveolar duct junction where the BASCs are located ( 25 ), our cells are scattered in the lung stroma ( Fig. 3 A ) and in the bronchiolar lining layer (Fig. S6) . Nevertheless, we notice that some CD34 \u03e9 Oct4 \u03e9 cells in the non-SARS lung are actually juxtaposed to the cytokeratin \u03e9 or surfactant \u03e9 cells ( Fig. 3 A ) . Therefore, the possibility that these putative stem/progenitor cells in the human lung may diff erentiate into mature respiratory epithelia or pneumocytes, as in the case in mice, cannot be excluded.",

In our study, some uninfected CD34 \u03e9 Oct4 \u03e9 cells were identifi ed in the alveoli and bronchiolar lining layer of the SARS lung ( Fig. 2 and Fig. S6) . Furthermore, not all the enrolled non-SARS individuals had these cells in the lung. It is thus likely that these CD34 \u03e9 Oct-4 \u03e9 cells might be blood-borne and recruited into the lung under regulation. This postulation can be supported at least in part by reports that circulation-or bone marrow -derived cells may diff erentiate into mature respiratory epithelia in animals ( 26 -28 ) , and that preexisting injury may increase recruitment of adult bone marrow -derived cells to the lung, which subsequently give rise to diff erentiated cells ( 29 ) . Because CD34 \u03e9 Oct4 \u03e9 cells can be found in the non-SARS lung ( Fig. 3 A ) and can be infected by SARS-CoV ex vivo ( Fig. 3 B and Figs. S8 and S9), we regard it unlikely that the presence of these cells in the lung is merely a response to SARS infection. For the same reason, it is also unlikely that these cells are recruited into the lung only as part of an attempt for viral clearance or are the only remaining cells bearing viral antigen by the time of death.",

Our ex vivo infection model in part can be a complement to actual early infection. However, in vivo confi rmation of the identity of virus-targeted cells in the early phase is diffi cult because of unavailability of samples from patients who died within 3 d after illness onset or even before the onset. Extrapolation of animal studies to humans for early infection also requires much caution because iatrogenic inoculation with large-volume viral droplets into animals is different from infection in a more natural aerosol form in human settings ( 30 ) . Moreover, the value and reproducibility of the nonhuman primate model for SARS infection are also highly disputable ( 31, 32 ) .",

Nevertheless, we present clear evidence that putative stem/progenitor CD34 \u03e9 Oct4 \u03e9 cells are the major target for SARS-CoV infection in the human lung. With our fi ndings, we postulate that although L-SIGN -mediated viral entry into cytokeratin \u03e9 respiratory epithelia leads to viral degradation ( 13 ) , infection of CD34 \u03e9 Oct4 \u03e9 cells may result in cell death (cytopathy) and the production of proinfl ammatory cytokines or other soluble mediators. The death of the stem/progenitor cells and the resulting local immuno-dysregulation (e.g., cytokine storm from infi ltrating immune cells [ Fig. S5 ], including macrophages, and/or from the infected CD34 \u03e9 Oct4 \u03e9 cells) may together contribute to alveolar cell damage, loss of repair capacity, and respiratory insuffi ciency as clinically observed. Isolation and purifi cation of these CD34 \u03e9 Oct4 \u03e9 cells are underway to further examine their role in the pathogenesis.",
