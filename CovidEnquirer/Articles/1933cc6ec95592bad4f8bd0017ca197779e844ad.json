In some wildlife applications, transmission is even a goal [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Understanding the ramifications of transmission is now a matter of importance. In this treatise, we bring together results from genome engineering, evolutionary biology, and mathematical epidemiology to discuss the problems and unknowns facing the design, implementation, and outcomes of transmissible vaccines. Our understanding is yet rudimentary, so this document is both a review and a recommendation for new studies. The technology of genome engineering has advanced by leaps, enabling many new transmissible vaccine designs. By contrast, our understanding of the epidemiological and evolutionary ramifications of transmission is in its infancy. Transmissible vaccines are but one set of strategies of transmissible interventions (Box 1), and the general topic offers many exciting opportunities for research and possible implementation.",

The virus was grown in unnatural conditions, perhaps novel temperatures, novel hosts, or novel host cells. Adaptation to the new conditions compromised viral growth ability in the natural hostresulting in a viral growth rate reduction that subdued the infection enough to avoid disease. The endpoint of the adaptation was chosen by trial and error, with little insight to the vaccine properties until tested in an actual host. It was thus not feasible to knowingly generate a variety of vaccine candidates differing in the degree of attenuation. Consequently, the range of attenuation compatible with avirulence and immunogenicity was never worked out. But the fact that adequate immunity and avirulence were often achieved by such an imprecise method suggests that the acceptable range of attenuation levels is broad. (Of course, the inoculum dose could always be adjusted to compensate for different levels of attenuation.)",

Cells coinfected with the DIP and standard virus vastly overproduce the DIP, and the asymmetry in output leads to an overall reduction in standard viral load [44, 45] . Because DIPs suppress viral load, they have long been entertained as therapies for viral diseases [46, 47] . A more recent proposal is to engineer DIPs as therapeutic interfering particles (TIPs); any TIP transmission among hosts is a strong potential benefit [48, 49] . Thus, TIPs that protect against HIV would not only suppress the disease but would also spread and automatically target superspreaders [7] . Despite the promise of this approach, challenges await. For instance, because DIPs and TIPs require a high density of the competent virus for effective replication, an interfering virus that profoundly suppresses the pathogenic virusotherwise a good propertywill ultimately suppress its own replication, with poor transmission to other hosts.",

The protein sequences are unaltered from the wild type, but protein expression and intracellular growth are reduced (by mechanisms not fully understood but likely involving reduced translation). Greater attenuation is achieved with larger numbers of synonymous codon changes, allowing a very precise tunability. This method can be applied to parts or the whole of any viral genome. This type of attenuation is very slow to recover high fitness.",

Its genome is engineered to carry one or a few antigenic genes from a pathogen.

In contrast to an attenuated vaccine, a 'recombinant vector' of this type is intrinsically safe because it carries only a small part of the pathogen's genome. However, even supposedly benign vectors may be pathogenic in individuals with compromised immune systems, so an RVV may be safe only in some individuals.

In pigs, the corona viruses TGEV (transmissible gastroenteritis virus) and PRCV (porcine respiratory corona virus) infect different tissues (the gut and respiratory tract, respectively) despite few genetic differences. This tissue tropism is caused by just two amino acid substitutions in the S spike gene that encodes a glycoprotein essential for attachment to host cells [61] . Although TGEV is more fatal than PRCV, infection by the genetically similar PRCV can provide some protection from TGEV [62, 63] . In this case, there seems to be little possibility of the 'vaccine' strain (PRCV) evolving back to high virulence. Studying the genetic basis of naturally occurring tissue tropism should inform blueprints for the genetic engineering of vaccines that maintain transmissibility despite low virulence. transmission (e.g., Box 2). By contrast, live RVVs may unavoidably transmit because they have the (largely) complete genome of the vector. Engineering may be used to partly disable the vector, thereby limiting transmission, and the use of heterospecific vectors may also effectively block transmission (e.g., a nonhuman vector virus for a human vaccine).",

Any vaccine transmission helpsthe ratio is fully indifferent to whether R 0,V is greater or less than 1. The impact of vaccine transmission is merely measured relative to that of the pathogen, and the same R 0,V will have a larger impact for a poorly transmitted pathogen than for a highly transmitted pathogen. The amount of direct vaccination required goes to 0 as the R 0 of the vaccine approaches that of the pathogen. As is well known from classical theory, the agent with largest R 0 will prevail in the long term [41] , so were the vaccine R 0 to exceed that of the disease agent, the disease agent would disappear without any intervention beyond the initial introduction of the vaccine (the expression in Equation 1 becomes negative). And this realization also leads to the second point above: whenever the vaccine R 0 is less than that of the pathogen's R 0even if the vaccine is capable of maintaining itself in a na\u00efve populationthe vaccine will die out in the absence of continual supplementation until the pathogen is eradicated.",

The dynamics of a transmissible attenuated vaccine are simple because the vaccine and its pathogen are in direct competition for susceptible hosts: a host previously infected by either the pathogen or vaccine is immune to both. But the competition is limited to the two viruses. With an RVV, there is a three-way interaction because the RVV faces competition from the pathogen and vector. If immunity to the vector is widespread, vaccine transmission may be limited even when the intrinsic vaccine transmission rate is high.
