For uncertainty intervals, we estimated the covariance as the inverse of the negative Hessian matrix, at the maximum log-likelihood estimate (1) . We then used this in a multivariate normal distribution, taking 10,000 samples, calculating the relative risk with each draw, and taking the 2.5, 50, and 97.5 percentiles of the resulting values.",
