            "text": "The basic question asked by anomaly detection systems is whether anything strange has occurred in recent events. This question requires defining what it means to be recent and what it means to be strange. The WSARE algorithm (Wong and Moore, 2002 , Wong et al., 2002 is one example of an algorithm that attempts to do this. It defines all patient records failing on the current day under evaluation to be recent events. Note that this definition of recent is not restrictive--the approach is fully general and \"recent\" can be defined to include all events within some other time period such as over the last six hours. In order to define an anomaly, we need to establish the concept of something being normal. In WSARE version 2.0, baseline behavior is assumed to be captured by raw historical data from the same day of week in order to avoid environmental effects such as weekend versus weekday differences in the number of ED cases. This baseline period must be chosen from a time period similar to the current day. This can be achieved by being close enough to the current day to capture any seasonal or recent trends. On the other hand, the baseline period must also be sufficiently distant from the current day. This distance is required in case an outbreak happens on the current day but it remains undetected. If the baseline period is too close to the current day, the baseline period will quickly incorporate the outbreak cases as time progresses. In the description of WSARE 2.0 below, we assume that baseline behavior is captured by records that are 35, 42, 49, and 56 days prior to the day under consideration. We would like to emphasize that this baseline period is only used as an example; it can be easily modified to another time period without major changes to the algorithm. In a later section, we will illustrate how version 3.0 of WSARE automatically generates the baseline using a Bayesian network.",

Even if surveillance data were generated randomly, entirely from a null distribution, we can expect that the best rule would be alarmingly high-scoring if we had searched over 1000 possible rules. In order to illustrate this point, suppose we follow the standard practice of rejecting the null hypothesis when the p-value is >a, where a = 0.05. In the case of a single hypothesis test, the probability of a false positive under the null hypothesis would be a, which equals 0.05. On the other hand, if we perform 1000 hypothesis tests, one for each possible rule under consideration, then the probability of a false positive could be as bad as 1 -(1 -0.05) l~176176 1, which is much greater than 0.05 (Miller et al., 2005) . Thus, if the algorithm returns a large score, we cannot accept it at face value without adding an adjustment for the multiple hypothesis tests we performed. This problem can be addressed using a Bonferroni correction (Bonferroni, 1936) , but this approach would be unnecessarily conservative. Instead, we turn to a randomization test in which the date and each ED case features are assumed to be independent. In this test, the case features in the data set DB remain the same for each record but the date field is shuffled between records from the current day and records from five to eight weeks ago. The full method for the randomization test is shown below.",

Under this assumption, detection algorithms operate by subtracting away the baseline from recent data and raising an alarm if the deviations from the baseline are significant. The challenge facing all such systems is to estimate the baseline distribution using data from historical data. In general, determining this distribution is extremely difficult due to the different trends present in surveillance data. Seasonal variations in weather and temperature can dramatically alter the distribution of surveillance data. For example, influenza season typically occurs during mid-winter, resulting in an increase in ED cases involving respiratory problems. Disease outbreak detectors intended to detect epidemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), West Nile virus and anthrax are not interested in detecting the onset of flu season and would be confused by influenza. Dayof-week variations make up another periodic trend.",
