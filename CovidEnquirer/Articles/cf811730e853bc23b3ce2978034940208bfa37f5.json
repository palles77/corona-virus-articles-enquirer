Although the virus has yet to be implicated in human disease, epidemiologic studies have shown that 69%-80% of persons (7) (8) (9) are seropositive for this virus; infection probably occurs during early childhood. In addition, viral DNA has been detected in blood, feces, respiratory tract secretions, tonsils, and cerebrospinal fluid (10) . Although these studies have contributed to a better understanding of WUPyV, only 1 has explored the in vivo tropism of the virus or described the detection of viral antigen in tissue (11) . That study determined that WUPyV was present in epithelial cells from a bronchoalveolar lavage from a lung transplant recipient with Job syndrome. A complete understanding of the types of cells and tissues in which the virus replicates is critical for identifying potential diseases with which it may be associated. However, the propensity for viruses of the family Polyomaviridae to cause disease only within the context of immunosuppression makes disease association particularly challenging. We describe molecular characterization and immunohistologic and microscopic localization of WUPyV in tissues from a deceased patient who had had viral pneumonitis.",

Compared with 79 complete WUPyV genome sequences available in GenBank, nucleotide identity scores for Rochester-7029 ranged from 0.970 to 0.985. Compared with the reference sequence, Rochester-7029 had 8 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, 5 of which were in coding regions. Two of these 5 were synonymous mutations. We predicted an amino acid change in VP2 and VP3 from glutamic acid to glutamine at positions 250 and 107, respectively. We also predicted amino acid changes in large T-antigen: glutamine to glutamic acid at position 134 and isoleucine to leucine at position 594. Of note, the Rochester-7029 genome contained a 77-bp terminal duplication in the large T-antigen as compared with the reference WUPyV genome, which was not predicted to have any effect on the size or sequence of the translated protein because it was located 3\u2032 to the T-antigen stop codon.",

We anticipated that some WUPyV-positive cells in lung tissues of the patient reported here were also epithelial cells, but we did not explicitly confirm this suspicion because of the limited amount of lung tissue available. Instead we chose to explore additional hypotheses regarding potential tropisms of WUPyV because of our recent detection of KIPyV in CD68-positive cells (16) . CD68 is a glycoprotein present on monocytes and macrophages. We performed dIHC testing by using the monoclonal antibody against WU-VP1 (NN-Ab06) and a monoclonal antibody against CD68, which primarily labels macrophages and monocytes. Cells positive for both WU-VP1 and CD68 were detected within the patient's lung tissue (Figure 3 ). In addition, the cell shown in Figure 3 , panel B (arrow) is morphologically consistent with a foamy macrophage, a specific morphotype of macrophage that is laden with lipid droplets in the cytoplasm (17) . A serial section stained with isotype-matched antibodies (IgG2b for NN-Ab06 and IgG1 for the anti-CD68 antibody) was negative (not shown). In a recent study, KIPyV was also detected in a foamy macrophage (16) .",

            "text": "We describe a case of viral pneumonitis in a bone marrow transplant recipient who died in 2001. Before her death, influenza and adenovirus were identified from the patient. Although samples from the patient were initially tested for several viruses by IHC and culture, no agent was identified. Subsequent work since 2007 showed that multiple tissues from this patient were positive for WUPyV by real-time PCR and IHC, but the same tissues were negative for KIPyV and HBoV by PCR. To date, WUPyV has been the only virus detected in tissue samples from this patient. Crystalline lattices of polyomavirus-like particles were seen in the lung, which substantiated the high virus titers measured by qPCR. Collectively, these observations suggest a potential pathogenic role for WUPyV infection in this case. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that WUPyV infection was simply opportunistic in this severely immunocompromised patient. Analysis of samples from this patient provided novel insights into fundamental properties of WUPyV infection in vivo. In the lungs, we detected WUPyV antigen in CD68positive cells (probably of the macrophage/monocyte lineage) by immunohistochemistry. WUPyV is most closely related to KIPyV, and the viruses share many similarities, including an apparent tropism for CD68-positive cells (16) . Other polyomaviruses have also been detected in cells of the monocytic lineage (16) . We do not believe that this detection represents phagocytosis of other WUPyV-infected cell types because WU-VP1, a late-expressed protein, was detected in the nucleus of CD68-positive cells, suggesting an infection in this patient. Granted, we did not prove that infectious particles were produced.",

The detection of WUPyV in tracheal tissue was unexpected and expands the known tissue tropism of the virus. As previously mentioned, MUC5AC is a mucin primarily produced by goblet cells in the airway. Several viruses in glandular cells in the trachea have been described: adenovirus has grown in primary cultured peribronchial submucosal gland cells (19) ; rhinovirus has grown in human respiratory submucosal gland cells (20) ; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus antigen and RNA have been detected in tracheal/bronchial serous gland epithelium (21) ; and BKPyV has been shown to replicate in salivary gland cells (22, 23 In conclusion, WUPyV was detected by multiple methods in the lung of a bone marrow transplant recipient who had viral pneumonitis at the time of death. Tracheal tissue from this patient was also positive for WU-VP1. Viral antigen was specifically detected in CD68-positive cells and in close association with MUC5AC-positive cells within a tracheal submucosal gland. The role of WUPyV as a human pathogen remains unclear, although the evidence for an infection of the respiratory tract in this patient is strong.
