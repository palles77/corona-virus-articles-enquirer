            "text": "The International Society for Antiviral Research (ISAR) organizes and sponsors an annual international meeting, the International Conference on Antiviral Research (ICAR). The 32nd annual ICAR was held in Baltimore, MD, USA on May 12-15, 2019. The goal of these meetings is to foster and nurture progress in antiviral research, so as to accelerate the development of new drugs and vaccines to help prevent and treat the many viral diseases that affect humans and animals. As in previous years, the 32nd ICAR provided a most collegiate environment in which the most recent advances in antiviral research and development, as well as historical perspectives and current situation analyses of the worldwide landscape of viral disease and therapy, were presented and discussed. As in previous years (Andrei et al., 2017; Bray et al., 2018; Vere Hodge, 2013; 2014 , the following pages provide an overview of the meeting, The ISAR awards were again one of the highlights of the meeting. This year, ISAR bestowed the fourth-ever Award for Outstanding Contributions to the Society to Mark Prichard, who has since passed away. Many of us have used Mark's MacSynergy\u2122 software series to analyze drug-drug interactions. The fifth-ever ISAR Award of Excellence was granted to Dr. Robert Gallo, who discussed the challenges in the discovery of HTLVs, the impact of these discoveries in the later discovery of HIV, and the current challenges posed by HTLVs. He also introduced the Global Virus Network. The Gertrude Elion Memorial awardee, David Evans, discussed the challenges and opportunities in developing antivirals against viruses that do not currently infect humans. The Antony Hol\u00fd Memorial awardee, Richard Mackman, presented a lecture on the development and activities of remdesivir and its ongoing clinical testing against Ebola virus. This year's William Prusoff Young Investigator awardee, Marnix Van Loock, disserted on dengue virus and the development of anti-dengue drugs from a pharmaceutical perspective. Our second Women in Science awardee, Grace Zhou, gave her excellent perspectives on a woman's most successful career in academy and industry in the USA and China. The Keynote address was delivered by Diane Griffin, who spoke on measles virus persistence and immunity. Her lecture was partly focused on the requirement for very high vaccine coverage to curtail measles epidemiology, and the different challenges to achieve this coverage in https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2019.104550 Received 27 June 2019; Accepted 2 July 2019 developed and less developed parts of the world.",

Two sessions on \"What's new in antiviral research\" covered a range of topics and new challenges and progress in antiviral research and development. The short talks were organized in sessions dedicated to specific viruses or diseases, such as DNA viruses and respiratory or hepatotropic viruses, or areas such as medicinal chemistry. The poster presentations further expanded in all areas of antiviral research and development. As in all previous years, the symposia, sessions, short talks, shotgun talks, and poster presentations altogether gave an excellent background and update on the challenges posed by viruses and on the virological and chemical aspects of antiviral drug discovery and development in academia, industry, health care, and other national, international, governmental, or nonfor-profit organizations. This year's ICAR thus continued to reinforce one of the major strengths of the society: bringing together people working in all areas of antiviral discovery and development, in all different settings. Also highlighting its international presence were the many talks by researchers from the USA, Europe, China, Japan, Australia, India, Singapore, South America and other parts of the world.",

After completing his Ph.D. in 1992, Mark did postdoctoral training with Ed Mocarski until 1996, when he moved to the pharmaceutical and biotech industry, with stints at Hybridon, Iconix Pharmaceuticals and MedImmune Vaccines, before moving back to Academia in 2003 to take a position as Associate Professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Department of Pediatrics. He quickly climbed the ranks, becoming a full professor in 2008 and the Director of the Molecular Diagnostics laboratory in 2012.

Dr. Gallo discussed how the discovery of HTLVs started changing the appreciation for human retroviruses, supporting the then not so widely accepted model that AIDS could be caused by a retrovirus, and provided the technologies required to detect and analyze human retroviruses, thus facilitating the discovery of HIV. Both these discoveries, of HTLVs and HIVs, became possible by the then new capacity to grow T cells using interleukin (Il)-2 and the development of sensitive methods to detect reverse transcriptase activity, differentiating it from that of the human DNA polymerases.",

Despite these successes, however, HIV infections cannot yet be cured. There are three main goals in HIV prevention/therapeutics. The first one is the development of an effective vaccine. Unfortunately, progress towards this goal has been limited. The second would be a complete cure -eliminating the virus. Although much progress has been made at controlling the disease, there is no major progress yet toward curing the infection.

            "text": "Subsequently, David Evans discussed how HPMPA, which is more bioactive in vitro, inhibits VACV replication. As HPMPApp is a less efficient chain terminator than CDVpp, more HPMPA is expected to accumulate in the replicated DNA in what would later become the template strand. VACV DNA pol faithfully incorporates a nucleotide opposite a drug residue when either CDVpp or HPMPApp were incorporated in the template rather than the primer strand. However, template-encoded HPMPA or CDV strongly inhibited further primer extension. David Evans speculated how these biochemical data might relate to the mutations responsible for CDV R . The A314T substitution maps to the exonuclease domain of E9 DNA pol and results in differential exonuclease activity that can excise CDV from the end of the primer strand. The A684V mutation maps to a highly conserved \u03b1-helix of the DNA pol and may help dNTP versus CDVpp selection. A third class of mutation (S851Y), at the base of the thumb of the DNA pol, The presence of these drugs in the template strand might inhibit transit of the DNA through a polymerase. The mechanism is like the one when a stripped thread blocks a bolt passage through a nut. E. Tramontano, et al. Antiviral Research 169 (2019) 104550 confers resistance to the purine analogue HPMPDAP and results in a highly attenuated virus. David Evans suggested that these drugs in the template strand might inhibit transit of the DNA through a polymerase molecule and that the S851Y mutation may also alter the way in which DNA is enclosed within the thumb and palm domains. Thus, nucleoside phosphonates may act by inhibiting virus polymerases with what is essentially damaged DNA (Fig. 1) . In support to this hypothesis, NMR structures of a dodecamer DNA duplex containing a CDV molecule at position 7 show that CDV is well accommodated within the dodecamer DNA duplex (Julien et al., 2011) , but the duplex is destabilized, suggesting increased dynamics around CDV. Thus, template-bearing drug adducts create a barrier to poxviruses replication. Whereas cells bypass template damage with the specialized error-prone DNA polymerases, poxviruses replicate in the cytoplasm with just their own highly faithful DNA polymerase.",

These drugs offer promise as a second smallpox therapeutic when considering that they have a high barrier to resistance and resistant mutants have reduced fitness, mutants are still drug sensitive with only a modest increase in EC 50 , and the drugs have shown efficacy in several animal models. These attributes may all result from the complex ways in which these drugs inhibit multiple steps in the DNA polymerization reaction. David suggested that a DNA damage model deserves more attention in that it may be the bases for both the selectivity of these drugs and their somewhat surprising anti-cancer activity. The later could result from the DNA repair/bypass systems in normal cells being tolerant to drug damage, whereas repair defects in cancer cells may sensitize them to these agents (Andrei et al., 2015) .",

A highly impractical cyanation reaction, which required full body suit protection for the process chemists, required that Gilead develop a novel flow reactor system to perform the reaction. This allowed for kilograms of compound to be generated safely. Additional advances included the development of a formulation that could eliminate cold chain requirements making it more practical for use in the African continent.",

However, she found she could apply her basic science training to industry. She emphasized that she was driven at challenging times by her belief that there is \"no good excuse (age, gender, education) not to continue learning.\" She found that success in running a business (or lab) relies heavily on focusing on the people with whom she works. She shared some advice with the audience: (1) make sure you select wisely the team working with you; (2) recruit them not to work for you, but to work for themselves; (3) encourage and motivate your team instead of pushing them; and (4) provide a big enough stage for young people to develop their careers. Overall, her approach to management centered on her finding that when \"you free their spirit, they work very hard.\" She emphasized needing to allow employees or mentees to make mistakes while taking herself the responsibility for them. She illustrated her philosophy for both research and industry by encouraging the audience to \"play violin on the stage and make sure the audience dances with you.\" Finally, she discussed recognizing and being grateful for unplanned situations. She narrated the story of a funder who sought her out and reached her unexpectedly to then invest millions to support her efforts. Grace Zhou continued by speaking about an oncolytic platform, product line, and drug formulation, with an emphasis on the challenges in manufacturing oncolytic viruses. In brief, these viruses demonstrate robust oncolytic activity because of a specialized backbone that expresses IL-12. Upon a single injection into a tumor model in nude mice, the virus suppressed the tumor in a dose-dependent manner. This product would be applied to the treatment of melanoma. Grace Zhou continued by describing some of her group's recent investigations into HSV-1, in particular the function, activation, and control of innate immune networks in response to HSV infection. Her objective was to identify constitutively expressed cellular genes that limit viral replication. Her group screened a subset of cellular genes and found that HSV-1 relies on the functions of constitutively expressed and inducible cellular genes to suppress innate immunity genes inimical to viral replication. To date, they have identified three recruited genes: LGP2, HDAC4, and GADD45?? Their data suggest that the cellular genes recruited by HSV-1 act independently on the same (or at least on an overlapping set of) innate immunity genes. The targets of recruited genes identified so far include IFI16, IFIH1 (MDA5), IFIT1, and RIG-I. In cells depleted of LGP2 and GADD45?? HSV-1 demonstrated impaired ability to suppress the innate immune response, resulting in reduced viral replication.",

Dengue disease has a major social-economical impact and is listed by the WHO in the top 10 of global health treats for 2019. Most primary dengue infections are asymptomatic. However, approximately 15-25% lead to febrile illness (dengue fever), characterized by a rapid onset of high fever combined with a plethora of other symptoms (e.g. rash, retro-orbital pain, joint and muscle pain, back pain, etc.) Unfortunately, a small fraction of patients progresses to more severe disease, termed dengue hemorrhagic disease or dengue shock syndrome. There are four serotypes of dengue virus that co-circulate in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Infection with one serotype produces long-lasting immunity to that serotype, but also generates non-neutralizing antibodies to the other three. These nonneutralizing antibodies can enhance infection in people infected with any of those different serotypes by binding to the virion and increasing entry into permissive cells through Fc-mediated uptake of antibody virus complexes, which results in higher viral load and increased risk of developing more severe dengue.",

During an outbreak in 1846 in the Faroe Islands, Peter Ludvig Panum, a Danish physician, observed that measles was contagious. He found the incubation time to be 14 days, and the attack rate to be 100% for those who had not been alive at the time of the previous outbreak in the islands some 60 years before. The lifelong immunity to the disease thus became clear. We now know that antibody levels remain high in 60-65 years old people infected as children. The extremely high attack rate of MeV is a consequence of the very high R 0 (a descriptor of the number of people who get infected from each case), which for MeV is 12-18 (in comparison to mumps: 10-12, polio: 10-15, smallpox: 5-7, or flu: 3-4).",

The vaccine replicates better than the WT virus in most cell types but not in PBMC, in which the WT produces 100-1,000 infectious units/ ml whereas the vaccine produces none. Not surprisingly, WT MeV infection induces much better antibody responses, which do not decrease much with time whereas those resulting from the vaccine do.

From then till 2013, there were only some 50-100 imported cases per year, which produced only small domestic outbreaks. However, the decrease in vaccination has resulted in a re-emergence, with the first peak of some 650 cases in 2014, and a second one ongoing right now with almost 900 cases in the first four months of this year. The problem is not limited to the US: the number of cases quadrupled worldwide from 2018 Q1 to 2019 Q1. The vast majority of the current cases of MeV occur in unvaccinated people, in particular those who have not been vaccinated yet because of young age. Only less than 1% of cases occur in patients who have received the two doses. As a result of the high R 0 , however, a very high vaccination coverage (around 92-95% or higher) is required to interrupt transmission and prevent outbreaks. The challenges to vaccination differ. In developing countries, the biggest challenge to achieving these essential high coverages lies in the health infrastructure, the cold chain, the availability of needles and syringes, and the need for sufficient number of skilled trained health workers, which are all compounded by the requirement for two doses. In developed countries, there is a growing challenge regarding vaccine acceptance, compounded by safety worries and the considerations to the balance between the individual rights and public health. As there is no evidence that secondary vaccine failure is any major contributing factor to the ongoing recurrent outbreaks, restoring vaccine coverage is paramount to stop the current ongoing measles outbreaks. Jeffery Taubenberger described the 1918 influenza pandemic as the \"worst natural disaster in history\". Although clinical samples were not collected at the time of the pandemic, autopsy specimens have been used to sequence and reconstruct the virus genome. He described the 1918 influenza A virus as a novel \"founder virus\" that initiated the current \"pandemic era\", as all influenza A pandemics and seasonal epidemics since then have been caused by descendants of the 1918 virus. The most important lessons learned from the 1918 pandemic may be the need to produce better antivirals, and broadly protective 'universal' influenza vaccines, which will necessitate a better understanding of the correlates of immunity and pathogenicity between humans and animal models of infection.",

Risk can be reduced with better surveillance in camel and human populations in areas where the virus is known to be circulating, with more aggressive contact tracing to identify more people with sub-clinical infection, fit enough to travel and serve as potential sources for exposure. Since E. Tramontano, et al.

MERS is on the WHO's list of Blueprint Priority Pathogens due to its epidemic potential and the current lack of available countermeasures. There is an urgent need for research to better understand transmission of MERS-CoV in dromedaries and at the animal-human interface.

In terms of transmission, males experiencing breathing difficulty were found to be the most efficient at person-to-person transmission (Nikolay et al., 2019) . As reviewed by Emily Gurley, caregivers are at greatest risk of infection. In the understaffed medical centers, and based on Bangladeshi culture, caregivers are largely family members. Spouses are especially at risk and their exposure to body fluids containing infectious virus facilitates transmission.",

Emily Gurley highlighted that the individuals exposed to infectious virus contaminating date palm sap have a shorter incubation period and more rapid disease progression compared to patients infected through person-to-person transmission, and that their diagnosis generally occurs only on the day of death, under the best possible circumstances (case fatality ratio -CFR of approximately 90% by this exposure route). Therapeutic intervention may be feasible in cases acquired by person-to-person transmission, with longer incubation times, slower evolution to severe disease, and earlier diagnosis (by a few days), which all improve the prospects for survival (approximately 50% CFR with person-to-person transmission), and opportunities for antiviral treatment. In addition to effective antivirals, rapid diagnostics were the highest priority on Emily Gurley's wish list as they are much needed to be able to initiate treatment (when a good treatment is one day available) and infection control interventions earlier. She concluded that, ultimately, mitigating the pandemic risk associated with NiV will require a combined approach that includes prophylactic measures, such personal protective equipment for the care of patients, implementation of sound infection control measures, improved surveillance and education, vaccines for at-risk individuals (such as healthcare workers and those that consume date palm sap), and cost-effective, shelf-stable and easy to administer antivirals.",

He began by reviewing that outbreaks of arboviral disease result from of enzootic and epizootic spillover events leading to human infection, although for some, such as Zika and dengue viruses, a human amplification and transmission cycle is involved. He highlighted the importance of the vector and its vectorial capacity, with Aedes aegypti being superior in this regard. The evolution of A. aegypti in close association with humans has led to its major role in the transmission of urban arboviruses, including yellow fever and chikungunya viruses. He discussed how proactive approaches employing deep sequencing of nonhuman primate (NHP) and arthropod vector samples can identify new emerging and re-emerging arboviruses with potential to cause human disease and emphasized the need to develop cell culture, rodent and NHP models to learn about their human impact potential. In parallel, vector competence studies in critical Aedes species such as A. aegypti and A. albopticus are needed to inform potential risks.",

MAYV has great urban emergence potential, but the viremia may not be high enough for transmission to urban mosquitoes. The MAYV enzootic region overlaps considerably with that of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) which has outbreak potential based on mutations leading to major epizootics with spillover to humans, as occurred in 1995 in Columbia and Venezuela, as well as high levels of human viremia. He also noted the potential risk of importing Rift Valley fever virus, which like VEEV and Japanese encephalitis virus is amplified in domestic animals. Availability of competent mosquitoes for RVFV in the United States is well documented but evidence of vectorial capacity is lacking. He also referred to recent experimental infection and modeling studies (Althouse et al., 2016; Vanchiere et al., 2018) that support concerns that a Zika virus (ZIKV) sylvatic cycle can be established in areas where susceptible NHP hosts are present. ZIKV spillbacks into enzootic cycles would make elimination near to impossible.",

Founder effects also appear to be at play with ZIKV. Scott Weaver also indicated that there is uncertainty regarding how global warming will affect arboviral diseases. In addition to altering the current range of vector species, increasing temperatures are sometimes harmful to the virus and mosquitoes. Moreover, hotter weather may limit outdoor activities thereby reducing human exposure risk.",

Reverse transcriptase can use EFdA-5\u2032triphosphate (EFdA-TP, MK-8591-TP) as a substrate more efficiently than the natural substrate, dATP (Acosta-Hoyos and Scott, 2010). MK-8591-TP inhibits the reverse transcriptase by first being incorporated at the 3\u2032-primer terminus, and after its incorporation it prevents further addition of nucleotides by blocking the translocation of the primer strand on the viral polymerase (Michailidis et al., 2014) . MK-8591-TP exhibits prolonged intracellular persistence and excellent potency. MK-8591 has been evaluated preclinically for both HIV treatment and preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), demonstrating robust protection in a rhesus macaque (RM)-simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) model (Markowitz et al., 2019) . MK-8591 has been shown to be generally well-tolerated when administered as a one-time dose (0.5-30 mg) to HIV-1-infected adult subjects. Further, it has a half-life in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HIV-1-infected subjects of 78.5-128 h, which renders is compatible with a variety of potential dosing regimens. Single-dose treatment with MK-8591 at doses as low as 0.5 mg leads to robust VL decline in treatment-na\u00efve HIV-1-infected subjects (Barrett et al., 2018; Matthews et al., 2007) . As a result of its exquisite potency, long-acting PK profile, and robust efficacy, MK-8591 is a candidate for ExDD formulations. Drugs such as MK-8591 may be dispersed within polymers that exhibit controlled degradation (bioerodible and nonerodible) to generate monolithic matrix implants of dimensions suitable for subcutaneous administration. Implants are designed to achieve a broad range of drug release characteristics and durations, achieved through optimization of drug loading and polymer composition of the implants (Barrett et al., 2018) .

            "text": "In this symposium, three presentations were given by outstanding scientist in the field. The goal of this mini-symposium was to bring Medicinal Chemistry closer to a broad audience describing the methods and the approaches chemists use to develop new potential antiviral agents. The first lecture was given by Katherine Seley-Radtke (Chemistry), the second lecture was presented by Andrea Brancale (Molecular Modeling) and the third lecture was given by Anthony Keefe (compound library development). . These articles reviewed the development of nucleoside analogue antiviral drugs, and were written for a target audience of virologists and other non-chemists, as well as chemists who may not be the most familiar with the history of the field. As a result of their important role in the field of medicinal chemistry for several decades, nucleosides remain a key focus for antiviral research efforts. The naturally occurring nucleosides represent a unique starting point for drug design due to their involvement in numerous critical biological processes as well as their serving as essential building blocks for both DNA and RNA synthesis. Because nucleoside/tide analogues mimic the structure of the natural nucleosides such that they are recognized by cellular or viral enzymes, modifications to their structure typically lead to disruption or termination of replication or other biological processes. Rather than providing a simple chronological account, she walked us through the thought processes, the advances in synthetic chemistry and the lessons learned from antiviral testing that led to several molecules moving forward clinically and eventually approved for human therapy, while others were discarded. There are more than 30 nucleoside/tide analogues on the market approved for use in treating viruses, cancers, and other conditions, with many more in clinical and preclinical trials. In her lecture Katherine Seley-Radtke focused first on early, relatively simplistic changes made to the nucleoside scaffold, beginning with modifications of the nucleoside sugars of Ara-C and other arabinosederived nucleoside analogues in the 1960s. She then extended the review to more recent developments, focusing particularly on more complex modifications, particularly those involving multiple changes to the nucleoside scaffold as, e.g., in sofosbuvir or remdesivir, a new broad-spectrum antiviral developed from Gilead Sciences. She explained why certain drugs were successfully developed, while the majority of candidate compounds encountered barriers from low-yielding synthetic routes, toxicity or other problems that led to their abandonment. Concurrently, she also discussed some of the hurdles that these types of compounds must overcome, e.g., in activation by lack of phosphorylation that can now be overcome by using monophosphate or triphosphate prodrug forms of the parent nucleoside analogues. Her lecture served to provide an informative and useful overview of the importance of nucleoside analogues in antiviral research, as well as the issues and solutions surrounding their development.",

            "text": "Andrea Brancale focused his presentation on the use of computeraided techniques, in particular structure-based drug design methods, in the early stages of antiviral drug discovery. He supported his discussion by providing few examples from his published work. He started with a summary of the work on the identification of a novel CHIKV nsP2 protease inhibitor, describing that no structure was available for the viral protein when they started the project, and hence a homology model was built to be used in a virtual screening protocol of a library of commercially available compounds. The best ranked compounds resulting from the in silico results were then purchased and tested in an antiviral assay. The biological evaluation resulted in the identification of a promising compound with low micromolar antiviral activity. Interestingly, the hit optimization that followed was carried out using a more traditional systematic structure activity exploration, without support from computer-aided methods. Andrea at this point highlighted that at that time a direct assay for nsP2 activity was not available. Hence, direct evidence that these compounds were active on the protease was missing. However, shortly after the publication of these results, another group tested a selection of the molecules reported by Andrea's group and they reported an inhibitory effect on the CHIKV nsP2 for this chemical scaffold. He then moved to a second example taken from his current work. The modeling approach was similar to the previous one, but in this case, there was more emphasis on the different ligand-based filters used in the virtual screening. The biological target in this case was the norovirus polymerase. The structure of the enzyme has been resolved, also in complex with an inhibitor. The group used this information to filter the compound library using a shape-based approach to select the compounds with a similar volume of the crystallized ligand. The compounds resulting from this procedure were then docked into the polymerase and the most promising ones were tested in a biochemical assay against the purified enzyme. Two interesting hits were identified with a low micromolar inhibitory activity; however the compounds did not show a good antiviral activity in the cell-based assay.",

            "text": "Anthony Keefe from X-Chem, a company which over the last eight years has licensed over sixty programs to a range of partners from large pharmaceutical companies to small biotechs, reported on a new strategy in drug discovery using DNA-encoded chemical libraries. Traditional drug discovery project initiation using HTS is limited to the number of compounds one can screen in a one-compound-one-well paradigm, typically no more than the single-digit millions. DNA-encoded chemical libraries allow the screening of combinatorially-generated libraries of compounds that exceed the numerical size of HTS collections by up to five orders of magnitude. Each compound in a DNAencoded chemical library is covalently attached to a unique DNA barcode that, when sequenced, can be used to understand the chemical history of the encoded small-molecule to which it is attached and thereby to elucidate its identity. DNA-encoded chemical libraries are generated in solution by split-and-pool chemical synthesis in which individual isolated compartments are used to contain building block installation reactions along with corresponding ligations of short DNA tags, the sequences of which encode the building block identities (Fig. 2) . These libraries are utilized in affinity-mediated screening in which rare individual library members that bind to protein targets are separated from non-binders by protein capture and stringent washing to remove non-binders. These protein-binding small-molecules are then identified by PCR amplification and sequencing. Re-synthesis and biochemical or biophysical assays are then used to determine if the identified small-molecules bind to the target in a manner that appropriately moderates the target activity. E. Tramontano, et al. Antiviral Research 169 (2019) 104550 The approach offers the potential for discovery of entirely new chemical matter to inhibit or otherwise modulate targets of interest from either a 120-billion compound DNA-encoded chemical library collection, or covalent irreversible inhibitors from a 100-billion compound DNA-encoded electrophile-capped covalent library (www.xchemrx.com, akeefe@x-chemrx.com).",

The first case study was a 33-year-old German traveler returning from Brazil who presented with fever, shivering, prostration, conjunctival suffusion, jaundice and hepatomegaly. The patient had not received the yellow fever vaccine. The patient was positive for yellow fever virus by PCR detection and rapidly progressed to acute liver failure with acute renal failure and coma. Dr. Jacobs described the epidemiology and natural history of yellow fever virus infection. Yellow fever is classically described as having two phases, characterized by an initial viremia associated with an acute febrile illness that lasts for up to 6 days followed by a remission of 2-24 h. Following this brief remission, there is a period of intoxication that lasts 3-8 days with symptoms that include gastroinestional disturbances, liver involvement (jaundice) and increasingly severe clinical presentation leading to death in 30-60% of patients. Although historical descriptions report that infectious virus cannot be isolated at this stage, PCR detects viral RNA in abundance. Approximately 1 in 7 infections progress to the intoxication phase of disease. The pros and cons of liver transplantation or use of antiviral interventions was discussed.",

Several strategies were discussed for identifying drug candidates to treat chikungunya infections. The use of approved or investigational drugs (drug repurposing) reduces time and costs and some candidates can be developed with abbreviated clinical studies. Broad-spectrum antivirals have been tested against chikungunya replication, including ribavirin, 4-hydroxycytidine, favipiravir, and sofosbuvir, which have all shown some level of efficacy in vitro. Host targeting agents are another pathway for therapeutic development that can reduce the selection for resistance and may result in broad spectrum activity. However, host pathways can also result in use limiting toxicities. Phenotypic screens can be used to identify chemical matter that inhibit virus replication by high throughput screening. While this methodology can identify novel compounds, hit optimization and target identification are not straightforward.

The compound was active against chikungunya in cell-based replication assays with and EC 50 value of 19 \u03bcM and a CC 50 value of 743 \u03bcM. Structure activity relationships guided medicinal chemistry efforts to improve its potency. These results identified several areas on the molecule that can be chemically modified to potentially improve activity. This approach led to the identification of several novel MADTP compounds with EC 50 values in cell-based replication assays of approximately 1-3 \u03bcM. Resistance mapping identified a mutation (P34S) in the nsP1 gene that correlated with reduced susceptibility to the MADTP compounds. The compounds were shown to inhibit the guanylylation activity of the nsP1 protein. Virus variants containing the P34S mutation were resistant to the inhibitory effects of the MADTP compounds. The resulting optimization campaign identified a compound (MADTP411) with EC 50 values ranging from 0.3 to 1.2 \u03bcM and CC 50 values > 70 \u03bcM. Goris, Ph.D.ViroVet, Leuven, Belgium In this lecture, Nesya Goris of ViroVet in Leuven, Belgium reviewed the concept of using small-molecule drugs to halt the spread of viral diseases in livestock. She began by noting that some 65 billion animals are consumed for food each year, and by 2050 the demand for animal protein is expected to increase by 75%. Despite the availability of numerous vaccines, however, 20% of livestock production is still being lost to disease and death. Given their success in humans, small-molecule antivirals are gaining attention as alternatives for the prevention and treatment of livestock diseases. Her talk highlighted the potential of antiviral therapy to contain outbreaks of exotic infections, using classical swine fever and the compound BPIP as an example. In experimental studies in piglets, BPIP reduced the viremic period by 74% and the viral load by 1,000-fold, and was highly effective in preventing transmission of infection to untreated sentinels (Vrancken et al., 2009a (Vrancken et al., , 2009b . Modeling studies have shown this to be an economically viable control policy (Backer et al., 2013) . Small-molecule antivirals may also have a role to play in endemic disease control, to cost-effectively reduce production losses and improve animal health and welfare. Collett, Ph.D. ViroDefense, inc., Rockville, MD, USA Marc Collett of ViroDefense in Chevy Chase, MD, USA, reviewed the expected need for antiviral therapies in the \"polio endgame.\" Three decades of infant immunization campaigns have brought the world close to the goal of eradication, as only 136 cases of paralytic disease were recognized, and in only three countries, in 2018. However, the use of the live attenuated oral vaccine (OPV) has resulted in unanticipated consequences: in under-immunized populations, the vaccine virus can spread, occasionally reverting to virulence. Moreover, in persons with immunodeficiency disorders, the virus may establish a persistent infection and be shed for years. The planned cessation of OPV use will address the former, but eradication will require treatment of chronically infected persons. it is currently accepted that two antivirals with different mechanisms of action will be needed. Marc described the current status of two lead compounds: pocapavir, which acts by stabilizing the viral capsid, preventing disassembly, and V-7404, an inhibitor of the enterovirus 3C protease. Both are highly active against all three strains of vaccine virus, and show synergistic activity, with minimal toxicity. To date, only pocapavir has been tested for efficacy in human volunteers (Collett et al., 2017) . The results suggest that combination therapy will be required to block the evolution of resistant virus.",

He noted that a compound currently under development at Janssen Pharmaceuticals targets the NS4B of all four dengue virus serotypes, while some other candidate molecules are not active against all serotypes. A recent paper from the Bartenschlager group validates the dengue NS1 protein as a \"Swiss army knife\" that could be an ideal antiviral target', especially given its interaction with precursor versions of NS4B (Plaszczyca et al., 2019) . Opportunities for targeting dengue and Zika virus with nucleoside-analogue inhibitors such as remdesivir (Gilead) were also suggested, based on extensive structural and functional similarities of the NS5 protein with the replication mechanisms of other RNA viruses. He also briefly reviewed the work of small biotech companies attempting to develop therapeutic antibodies against dengue, Zika and yellow fever virus.",

Five New World arenaviruses (NWAs) cause life-threatening viral hemorrhagic fever in the Americas, and others such as Lassa in the Old World. With only supportive therapy, ribavirin and immune plasma -against only Junin virus, these viruses are considered high priority pathogens by the NIAID, the CDC and WHO. The envelope glycoprotein (GPC) mediates arenavirus entry through a process of pH-dependent fusion with the endosomal membrane. Brian Gowen discussed the antiviral activity against Tacaribe virus (TCRV) of a novel fusion inhibitor, ARN75039 and on its preclinical development. TCRV is closely related to Junin and Machupo viruses, pathogenic NWAs. Dose-response analyses showed ARN75039 to be highly active against TCRV with sub-nM potency and a selectivity index (SI) > 1,000 (CC 50 was not achieved at the highest concentration of 100 nM). The compound's half-life in mice was 13.2 h, allowing for once-daily dosing, and no clinical adverse effects observed at 100 mg/kg (highest dose tested). At 10 or 35 mg/kg, ARN75039 treatment started prophylactically 2 h before infection protected against mortality (~80% survival at 27 days vs 20% for the placebo treated animals) and weight loss. Viremia and liver and spleen titres were between 2.5 and 5 orders of magnitude lower in the treated animals. Therapeutic treatment could be started up to 5 days post infection (dpi) and still achieve full protection against mortality and weight loss, albeit viremia, serum and spleen viral loads were only partially inhibited. Treatment started at 7 dpi still protected 50% of the mice against a lethal TCRV challenge dose. Treatment was therefore effective when started after the onset of clinical signs, as it is required to support a potential clinical use for ARN75039.",

Coronaviruses (CoVs) have a natural predilection for expansion into new host species giving rise to novel human diseases, as exemplified by the recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). MERS causes a severe respiratory syndrome, which has been associated with more than 2,200 cases and 800 deaths in 27 countries since 2012. Zoonotic CoVs similar to SARS and MERS-CoV circulate in animal reservoirs. Thus, is it possible that novel CoV may emerge in the future. Currently, there are no approved therapeutics for any human CoV. Remdesivir (RDV, GS-5734) is a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analogue that targets the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and has been shown to inhibit replication of viruses in multiple families. This presentation showed RDV and IFN\u03b2 had superior antiviral activity to LPV in vitro. RDV showed potent inhibition of MERS-CoV replication with an EC 50 of 0.09 \u03bcM and no observable cytotoxicity up to 10 \u03bcM in a human lung epithelial cell line (Calu-3) . The EC 50 values were 100-fold lower than those of LPV (11.6 \u03bcM) or RTV (24.9 \u03bcM). The EC 50 for IFN\u03b2 against MERS-CoV in Calu-3, 175 IU/mL (CC 50 > 2800 IU/mL), did not change significantly (160 IU/mL) when coupled with a clinically relevant LPV/RTV concentration (5 \u03bcM:1 \u03bcM). Humanized DPP4 mice deficient in Ces1c expression (C57BL/6J Ces1c\u2212/\u2212 hDPP4) were generated. In this model, MERS-CoV lung viral loads were significantly reduced, respiratory function was improved, and mice exhibited less weight loss with prophylactic or therapeutic administration of RDV (25 mg/kg, BID, subcutaneously), as compared to vehicle. Prophylactic and therapeutic combinations of LPV/RTV (LPV:160 mg/kg and RTV: 40 mg/kg, QD, PO) and IFN\u03b2 (1x human equivalent dose 1.6 MIU/kg or 25x human equivalent dose 40 MIU/kg, every other day, subcutaneously) slightly improved pulmonary function, but only prophylactic LPV/RTV-IFN\u03b2 had modest impacts on viral load. Prophylactic treatment with IFN\u03b2 alone failed to reduce viral loads and moreover it exacerbated disease.",

Despite the high medical and economic impact, with approximately 200,000 deaths and an estimated 60 billion USD costs per year, there are no indicated vaccines or antivirals for noroviruses. One of the major challenges to develop vaccines or drugs is the high genetic variability. However, as shown in an earlier talk for ZIKV, the RdRp gene is highly conserved and presents an attractive target for drug discovery. The RdRp inhibitor CMX521, a ribonucleoside analogue that inhibits NoV RdRp (IC 50 s 1-2 \u03bcM) by competing with GTP, has pan-genotypic norovirus activity (EC 50 , 0.12-5 \u03bcM). 150 mg/kg CMX521 twice a day reduced fecal MNV shedding by approximately 10-fold in immunocompetent mice and extended survival in a lethal immunocompromised mouse model. CMX521was evaluated in a Phase 1 double-blind, single-dose escalation clinical phase I safety and pharmacokinetics study. Thirty-eight healthy adults divided into 5 cohorts were randomized to receive single oral doses of CMX521 (200 mg-2400 mg) or placebo. All doses were generally well-tolerated and no clinically significant safety concerns were identified. In a second part of the trial, the concentration of the active form (CMX521-triphosphate) was evaluated 4 h after a single dose (2,400 mg, orally) in seven duodenal biopsies for each of three subjects.

Additional NTP/ dNTP mimics were synthesized by conjugating dAMP or tenofovir to a variety of amino acids, namely L-or D-glutamate, histidine, methionine, and arginine. Crystal structures revealed a conserved mode of binding for the nucleotide moieties, whereas different amino-acid substitutions interact with the binding pocket differently. These results suggest the potential for improving the target-specificity of NTP/dNTP analogues by introducing additional substitutions beyond the TP substations.",

BNBC activates a human-STING dependent cytokine response in primary human fibroblast cells. Pretreatment of cells with BNBC established an antiviral state against flaviviruses. Furthermore, BNBC also induces a robust type I and III interferon dominated cytokine response in PBMC and PBMC-derived macrophages and dendritic cells, and promotes dendritic cell maturation. Importantly, BNBC also inhibited cccDNA transcription and viral replication in HBV-infected Hep-G2 cells overexpressing NTCP. The work provides evidence supporting the development of STING agonists to treat viral infections in the context of a dysfunctional immune response, such as that by HBV.",

He reported the improved efficacy of poly-lactic-acid (PLA)-nanoparticulated-Pam3CSK4 (NP-Pam3SCK4) in vitro and in vivo (AAV-HBV transduced mice). In vivo, NP-Pam3SCK4 was far more efficient than free-Pam3CSK4 to inhibit HBV, with a negativation of viremia and a significant decrease of viral episomes in the liver. Hence, the data demonstrate the potential of innate immune stimulation of TLR2 in vivo as anti-HBV agents, provided liver delivery is optimized.",

Two compounds with different mode of actions suppressed HIV latency reversal in J-Lat cells, a cell line model of HIV latency. One of them was shown to inhibit activity of cyclin-dependent kinase 9, a component of the host p-TEFb complex required for Tat-mediated transcription.

In a fourmonth period, five viral isolates were obtained. Most isolates showed population heterogeneity of HSV-1 variants. Genotyping of two isolates demonstrated the presence of the A189V mutation in the thymidine kinase (TK) resulting in acyclovir resistance. Other isolates presented different mutations in the TK (A189V, R222H) and DNA polymerase (L778M, L802F) that led to resistance to both acyclovir and foscarnet. The TK T183P is a novel polymorphism that does not affect drug susceptibility. Two isolates obtained the same day from different body sites showed differences in heterogeneity and frequency of viral variants. The study demonstrates that typing of drug-resistance at multiple time points and at multiple body sites is a useful approach to adjust antiviral therapy.",

A phase 1 study showed sisunatovir to be safe while a phase 2 RSV challenge study showed that sisunatovir was able to reduce viral load and disease severity compared to placebo group. In vitro characterization of sisunatovir resistance showed that its target is the viral F protein. The F-protein gene selected mutation D489Y increased EC 50 value by 76-fold. However, the mutant virus has reduced in vitro fitness and inability to compete with wt RSV. Only two RSV F protein variants were detected in 34 sisunatovir treated subjects, an L141F and an D453G mutation, which resulted in no emergence of clinical resistance.",

The networking opportunities were further supported by the very well attended and liked Women in Science and Careers workshops. The Pechakucha approach provided an outstanding opportunity to develop skills to present science in a precise but also accessible and entertaining manner. The attendees therefore greatly benefited from the science, the opportunities to network and collaborate, the different perspectives about career development, and the many interactions with colleagues working in different countries in different areas of antiviral development in different settings. We are all already looking forward to the 33rd ICAR in Seattle, March 30-April 3rd , 2020.",
