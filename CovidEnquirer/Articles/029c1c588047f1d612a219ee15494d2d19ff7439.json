The Ebola data was originally obtained by the World Health Organization 266 and provided by Christopher Dye (dyec@who.int). The Hong Kong SARS data was provided by 267 Gabriel Leung (gmleung@hku.hk) of Hong Kong University. Please contact Christopher and 268 Gabriel for data regarding Ebola and SARS, respectively, due to concerns regarding potentially 269 identifiable health information. Finally, the MERS data for Saudi Arabia and South Korea were 270 obtained from data compiled by Andrew Rambaut (a.rambaut@ed.ac.uk) of the University of 271 Edinburgh, and is publicly available at https://github.com/rambaut/MERS-Cases/blob/gh-Evans Lodge helped develop the project and conduct initial data analysis with John Drake as 279 part of the University of Georgia Population Biology of Infectious Diseases REU Site. Annakate 280 Schatz updated Lodge's analyses with finalized Ebola data and wrote an initial paper draft from 281 that work. Lodge and Drake finalized the manuscript for submission.
