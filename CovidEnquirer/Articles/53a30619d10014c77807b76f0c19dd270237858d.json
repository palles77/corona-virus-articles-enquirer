Long-term mobility involves durations longer than six months and typically concerns relocation (immigration, move) or long term displacement from the place of residence (refugees). Six months is chosen as a cut point because public health authorities typically require that individuals affiliate with them if they spend this amount of time in their midst. Medium-term mobility involves events lasting from 1 to 6 months, typically related to domestic and foreign migrant workers, with individuals often maintaining two places of residence. Shortterm mobility ranges from over 1 day to 1 month and corresponds to travel away from and back to the place of residence for E-mail address: Julien.Arino@umanitoba.ca.",

For many years, long range mobility was mainly linked to trade. Most humans were mobile only very locally (within a village or to neighbouring villages).

The total number of mobility events occurring nowadays on a daily basis is enormous. The number of events is also difficult to apprehend. Indeed, while a lot of data is available concerning the number of mobility events, this data is often incomplete concerning the nature of the events themselves. Take for instance the traffic data used in Arino and Portet (2015) to parametrize a movement model. While the number of vehicles passing through counting stations is precise, it is impossible to tease out from this data whether passengers are undertaking local or long distance trips. Traffic utilization surveys are then useful complements to raw traffic data. The following examples serve to provide some sense of the number of mobility events.",

Finally, refugees constitute an important factor of international migration, particularly relevant in the context of public health as they represent populations often in precarious health conditions.

Indeed, whatever the modalities and characteristics of mobility, all migrants or travellers carry with them their \"health history\", which may include latent or active infections (TB, H1N1, polio, HIV), immunizations (schedules vary by country), health/nutrition practices or treatment methods. Thus, as the way humans utilize space evolves, so does the spread of pathogens they carry. In earlier times, human pathogens followed well-defined human trade routes. For instance, the Black Death followed the Silk Route into Europe (Benedictow, 2004) . As long range mobility becomes more of a mix between trade and leisure and trade routes evolve, the picture has become increasingly complex.

However, pathogens ignore borders and thus mobility-induced interconnections between administrative units have consequences. One striking example is that of poliomyelitis in Nigeria in 2004. Because of a vaccine scare that started in 2002 (Raufu, 2002) , authorities in the northern Nigeria state of Kano interrupted polio vaccination in 2004 (Olusanya, 2004) . This occurred in a context where neighbouring countries had polio vaccine coverage that was not ideal; see Fig. 2a . Vaccinations resumed in July the same year (Fleck, 2004) , but between the official interruption and the longer lasting public distrust, the damage was done: cases spiked in Nigeria (Cheng, 2008) but also in close countries such as Cameroon (Endegue-Zanga et al., 2016) .

This poses a very interesting problem, the inheritance problem. Consider model (3) where k2U , [2I and p2P . Think of (13) as representing any model for a single population found in the literature. Within a given patch p, suppose some dynamical properties are known about (13). Which of these properties also hold for the general system with mobility (3)? It is relatively easy to show that such things as existence and boundedness of solutions is preserved. As shown in this article, the same is true to some extent of existence and local asymptotic stability of the DFE. As we have just seen, global asymptotic stability is not as easy to settle. Techniques such as the one in Li and Shuai (2010) allow to envision a general treatment of this issue when a Lyapunov function is known for the isolated model.",

Consider a metapopulation such as (3) in which, when there is no movement, i.e., in the case of (13), some patches are at the DFE while others are at an EEP.
