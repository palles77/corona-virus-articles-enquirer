            "text": "Abstract: Throughout history, infectious diseases have posed a serious burden to mankind. More recently, there has been an alarming increase in drug-resistant microbes. Furthermore, new pathogens are emerging due to microbial evolution and adaptation. The spread of these diseases is a result of pathogen mutations and changes in human behavior patterns. Then, there are diseases that are lurking in the background, waiting for the right conditions before they strike again. In the war against these diseases, we have come to understand the behaviors of microbes in a heterogeneous world and the mechanisms governing disease transmission. These works have profoundly shaped modern knowledge of emerging and re-emerging infections. More recently, computational techniques have led the way into this new era by allowing rapid highthroughput analysis of pathogens which was previously not possible using traditional laboratory techniques. This chapter introduces methods in mathematical modeling, computational biology, and bioinformatics that have been used to study infectious diseases.",

In 430 bc , Thucydides described the very fi rst pandemic in recorded history -the Athenian plague that reportedly killed up to one-half of the citizens of Athens. In ad 541-2, an outbreak occurred in the Byzantine Empire, causing 10 000 deaths every day. The outbreak, named the Justinian plague after the reigning emperor Justinian I, resulted in over 100 million deaths and wiped out nearly half the inhabitants of the city. In 1348-50, the plague returned to Europe under the name of the Black Death, killing up to 60% of the continent's population. In March 1918, an infl uenza outbreak was fi rst reported in a US military camp in Kansas. The outbreak, later known as the \"Spanish fl u,\" subsequently spread and infected up to a billion people, or half the world's population at the time, causing some 50 million deaths within six months. All over the world, changes in socio-economic, demographic and environmental factors brought about by urbanization and industrialization have led to the resurgence of old and new infectious diseases.",

Furthermore, the world is also witnessing the emergence of more new pathogens due to microbial evolution and adaptation. Then, there are diseases that are lurking in the background, waiting for the right conditions before they strike again. In 1999, West Nile virus re-emerged in New York and spread across the United States to Long Island, Connecticut, Maryland, Florida, California, Arizona, and Colorado, with over 4100 reported cases and 280 associated deaths within a span of fi ve years. Previously known to be a mild disease, the re-emergence of epidemic Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in Africa, Indian Ocean, South-East Asia, Pacifi c, North America, and Europe in the past decade has caused severe morbidity with some cases of fatality. In April 2009, a new strain of human infl uenza A (H1N1) virus containing genes from human, swine and avian infl uenza A viruses emerged in Mexico. Over the course of one year, the virus had spread to more than 212 countries and overseas territories or communities, causing more than 15 921 deaths. More recently, in January 2012, a human case of avian infl uenza A (H5N1) virus infection was reported in China. If history is our guide, we can assume that the threat of these diseases will continue to grow and pose a serious problem to the security of countries worldwide.",

            "text": "Similarity between related sequences can give clues to the structure, function, or homology to the common ancestor. Computational methods that can compare sequence features are, therefore, particularly useful. Sequence alignment is the determination of residue-residue correspondences between two or more character strings, usually preserving the relative order. This method allows us to measure similarity and infer evolutionary relationships between two or more sequences. Pairwise sequence alignment is useful for analyzing the degree of similarity between two biological sequences. Where more than two sequences are involved, multiple sequence alignment can be used to identify regions of similarity that may help explain functional and/or phenotypic variability. The 2009 H1N1 fl u was not the fi rst human pandemic caused by infl uenza A viruses. It is related to the 1889 Russian fl u that killed \u223c1 million people, the 1918 Spanish fl u that infected \u223c25% of the global population and killed at least 50 million people worldwide, the 1957 Asian fl u that resulted in \u223c2 million deaths and the 1968 Hong Kong fl u that caused \u223c1 million deaths.

This method has been used to analyze the genetic diversity and antigenic relationships of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) proteomes from its introduction in 1952 to 2009. Antigenic switches refer to changes in gene expression at a specifi c site which may abrogate binding to HLA molecules or antagonize/ interfere with T cell response, leading to cellular immune evasion. The study suggested that CHIKV is undergoing mild positive selection, with signifi cant amounts of \"antigenic switches\" clustered over the entire genome. An effective way to identify amino acid residues that are involved in virus adaptation is to fi nd interdependencies between mutations in multiple proteins. A simple way to do this is to calculate mutual information (MI) between variable pairs. MI is an information theoretical statistic that measures the strength of association between a pair of variables. The mutual information between two variables A and B is defi ned by: ",

The neutral theory of molecular evolution by Kimura in 1968 states that most evolutionary changes at the molecular level are caused by random genetic drift of selectively neutral nucleotide substitutions. Due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, some point mutations are silent with no amino acid replacements. Silent or synonymous substitutions are primarily transparent to natural selection, whereas replacement or non-synonymous substitutions may be a result of strong selective pressure. A simple method to calculate the extent of adaptive evolution at highly variable genetic loci is to compare the fi xation rates between nonsynonymous (d N ) and synonymous (d S ) substitutions.",

However, the reliability of this technique is low when the rate of transitional nucleotide change is higher than that of transversional change.

Lineagespecifi c models assume that \u03c9 do not vary among sites, and can detect positive selection for a lineage only if the averaged d N over all sites is greater than the average d S . Site-specifi c models, on the other hand, allow \u03c9 to vary among sites but not among lineages. As such, these models can detect positive selection at individual sites only if the averaged d N over all lineages is greater than the average d S . By allowing \u03c9 to vary both among sites and among lineages, the method can be applied to detect positive selection that occurred at a few time points and affects a few sites.",
