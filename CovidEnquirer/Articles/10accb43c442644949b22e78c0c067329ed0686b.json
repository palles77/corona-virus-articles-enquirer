            "text": "Feline Coronaviruses (FCoVs) are members of genus Coronavirus, Family Coronaviridae. Two variants of FCoV have been described, Feline Enteric Coronavirus responsible for an enteric disease and Feline Infectious Peritonitis Virus (FIPV) the etiological agent of FIP, a fatal disease of domestic and wild cats. FIP development in a small percentage of animals infected with FCoV is related to the occurrence of genomic mutations supported by the close genetic relationship between the higher virulent virus and the parental FCoV (Herrewegh et al., 1997; Vennema et al., 1998; Vennema, 1999) . Additionally, FCoVs were classified as Types I and II according to their serological and genomic features. Type I is strictly feline. Type II FCoV, although sharing with Type I a high degree of similarity in the 3 0 -end of the genome, is antigenic and genetically more related to Canine Coronavirus (CCoV) (Hohdatsu et al., 1991) , suggesting that Type II resulted from a homologous and independent recombination event within the S and the M genes of Type I FCoV and CCoV (Herrewegh et al., 1998) . The current information on the geographical distribution of FCoV indicates a high incidence of Type I in Europe, Japan and USA (Addie et al., 2003; Hohdatsu et al., 1992) . However in Japan and Taiwan detection of FIP was associated with Type II FCoV (Hohdatsu et al., 1992; Lin et al., 2009) . Presently there is no available information about the molecular epidemiology of FCoV in Portugal. Due to the pathogenic impact of this virus in the feline health it was our purpose to investigate the presence of FCoV Types in the Portuguese cat population using a RT-PCR-nested PCR assay previously reported (Addie et al., 2003) and to assess its genetic diversity by heteroduplex mobility assay (HMA) and phylogenetic analysis.",

For a period of 3 years, 120 samples were collected and 57 were found positive for FCoV RNA. Within the positive samples the presence of FCoV Type I was found in 79%. Type II was only detected in 3.5% in animals with Feline Infectious Peritonitis. The remaining 17.5% could not be differentiated. These viral sequences, comprising a region within gene S were further subjected to a heteroduplex mobility assay (HMA) detecting the presence of viral quasispecies in 17% of the samples. Phylogenetic analysis for FCoV Type I revealed high genetic diversity between the Portuguese sequences and other previously characterized strains, while Type II tree showed a higher genetic homogeneity. This study confirmed the presence of FCoV Types I and II circulating in Portugal and detected high genetic diversity between circulating strains suggesting that the virus persists within the host as mixed viral populations.",

Sequence 11LVI_05b was also included in branch A but sequence 11LVI_05a, obtained from the same cat was positioned in branch B. Sequence 25LVI_04a was grouped in branch A though it was obtained from the same animal as sequence 25LVI_04b placed in a different branch. These two viral quasispecies (25LVI_04a/b) came from the same household of the source cats of sequences 22LVI_04a/b and 23LVI_04, which in this analysis were found distributed in outlier branches supported by 100% of bootstrap value. Sequences 20LVI_06Z (stool), 20LVI_06PBMC (blood) and 20LVI_06L (ascites) amplified from the same animal, were placed in two separate branches, one with 100% bootstrap value (20LVI_06PBMC and 20LVI_06L). Type II FCoV phylogenetic tree included previously assigned FCoV Type II sequences and two Portuguese sequences obtained during this study, one positive to viral quasispecies (32LVI_06; 32LVI_06a/b). All the sequences clustered in one branch, although FIPV 79-1146 and 79-1683 grouped together with 100% of bootstrap value. Due to the low number of nucleotides considered in the alignment (170b), a likelihood mapping analysis was preformed (TREE-PUZZLE) to assess its phylogenetic content, revealing 62.86% of fully resolved, 0% of partially resolved and 37.14% of unresolved quartets demonstrating therefore its reliable use to estimate phylogenetic relationships.",

In our analysis 47.5% of the samples were positive in the RT-PCR assay (57/120) and were obtained either from healthy animals or from cats with FIP. Moreover, the vast majority of the amplicons was classified as Type I. Type II was found only in two samples both from cats with FIP. The values found for FCoV Types I and II were in accordance with the distribution reported in Europe and USA (Addie et al., 2003; Benetka et al., 2004) although in Japan and Taiwan a higher prevalence of FCoV Type II was observed in animals with FIP (Hohdatsu et al., 1992; Lin et al., 2009) . In our study even though the two FCoV Type II sequences were obtained from sick cats, the low incidence of this viral biotype does not allow any relationship between FCoV II and symptomatic disease.",

These viral variants were found within the same animal but also in samples collected from animals sharing a multi-cat environment. This finding supports the viral internal mutation theory (Dye and Siddell, 2007) and confirms the animal exposure to divergent viral strains. The significance of FCoV quasispecies had already been studied (Battilani et al., 2003) suggesting a correlation between high viral genetic diversity within the host and development of disease. However from our data it was not possible to correlate viral diversity with virus subtype or disease therefore a more extensive study should be performed to assess this connection. The phylogenetic analysis of FCoV Types I and II sequences revealed an assorted distribution of sequences in Type I tree, showing high genetic diversity of the FCoV Portuguese sequences, its divergence toward European and Japanese sequences (Fq1_1099UK, H9_1100UK, and strains KU2, Black and UCD1) confirming the previous findings.",

A boostrap analysis of 1000 replicates was performed and values above 80% are indicated on the branches.
