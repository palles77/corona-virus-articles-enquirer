            "text": "On June 15th, 2015, an Omani male from the Middle East presented to the emergency department at BIH with dyspnoea. He had been recently hospitalized in his home country for a respiratory infection. Because of this symptom, his recent hospitalization in his home country and his history of recent travel from the Middle East, the patient had a surgical mask placed over his nose and mouth 7 min after registration and screening. On examination his vital signs showed temperature 37 C, pulse 93/min, blood pressure 154/86 mmHg, respiratory rate 24/min, and oxygen saturation 94% on room air. Physical examination revealed tachypnoea and rales in the right lung field. A chest radiograph showed opacification of the right upper and right lower lung fields. Because MERS-CoV was suspected, an infectious disease specialist was immediately consulted and the patient was admitted into a negative pressure room in the intensive care unit with full isolation precautions. Following Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) guidelines for patients who are not intubated, only nasopharyngeal swabs were initially performed for real-time polymerase chain reaction. This first sample yielded a weakly positive result for MERS-CoV at a referral laboratory. This led to a second set of nasal swabs being collected; these were sent to three referral laboratories, one of which was the National Institute of Health, MOPH laboratory. These samples were reported to be negative. However, to be certain of a negative result, a third sample, this time of sputum, was collected and sent to a fourth laboratory certified by the World Health Organization. This sample was reported positive for UpE, ORF1a, and RdRp genes. The patient was then transferred to Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute where he received supportive care and recovered.",

He was isolated in the emergency department and then admitted to a negative pressure room in the intensive care unit. Simultaneously, the MOPH was contacted and an investigation was begun by the government epidemiologist. The MOPH team came to the hospital and evaluated the individuals who had been in contact with the patient. A total of 101 individuals, including hospital staff and relatives of the patient, were evaluated for isolation. The hospital infection control team and the MOPH epidemiologist collaboratively determined the risk for contracting the infection for each individual. Twenty individuals (20%) were considered to be at high risk of contracting the infection; 25 (24%) at low risk; and 56 (56%) at extremely low risk. Twenty-one individuals (21%) were isolated in the hospital, two (2%) in another hospital, 13 (13%) were placed under quarantine in a house outside the hospital, and 65 (64%) selfmonitored at home. The hospitalized patients were placed in a single hospital ward with the individuals at high risk physically separated from the lower risk individuals in a different area of the ward separated by empty rooms. The high risk individuals were placed in rooms with more rapid air turnover.",

The decision was also based on the significant negative impact of the isolation on the hospital staff when the chance of the patient having MERS-CoV was assessed to be very small. The finding of a false-negative result is not rare in medicine and could have negatively affected the outcome; however, it ultimately did not affect the outcome because of the rapid response to the positive result reported for the third sample.",

Daily risk re-classification was accomplished based on routine clinical assessment, new laboratory findings and updated interviews with the isolated individuals.
