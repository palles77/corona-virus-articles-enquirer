            "text": "Atherosclerosis is increasingly viewed as an inflammatory process. A number of infectious agents have been implicated in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease. Chlamydia pneumoniae has been the most popular and well-studied of these pathogens. It is difficult to prove a causal relationship which requires the fulfillment of Koch's postulates, first developed in the late 1800s, to establish an infectious agent as the cause of a disease process. This paper reviews the evidence for and against Chlamydia pneumoniae infection as a contributing factor to atherosclerosis disease. It examines seroepidemiologic and histopathologic studies as well as animal models using Koch's postulates and then provides an analysis of current clinical trial data. n 2005 Published by Elsevier Inc. I nfectious agents have been proposed as a potential cause of atherosclerosis since the late 1800s and early 1900s (Table 1 ). In a paper published in 1911, Frothingham 1 stated, bAcute infectious diseases may cause some pretty general lesion throughout the arterial system, either from the diffuse action of toxins or from a widespread invasion of the arterial system by the infecting organisms. The exact nature of these lesions in human cases and their final result have not been so well worked out.Q Nearly 100 years later, we are still grappling with the same question. This certainly is not the first instance of an infection being linked to a chronic disease. Welldocumented associations that have revolutionized disease management include Helicobacter pylori and peptic ulcer disease, human papillomavirus and cervical cancer, human herpesvirus 8 and Kaposi sarcoma, and hepatitis B and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although diseases such as scarlet fever, diphtheria, and measles were cited as plausible contributors to the atherosclerotic process in the early 20th century, the control of these pathogens over the ensuing years has given rise to a new cast of suspect agents.",

            "text": "Data linking herpes viruses to atherosclerosis first came from Marek avian herpes virus, where infection of disease-free chickens with the virus produced arterial lesion. 2 A member of the Herpesviridae family, CMV has been associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis and death from coronary disease after cardiac transplant. [3] [4] [5] Prior CMV infection has also been linked to increased risk of restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention. 6 However, data are conflicting with several prospective, nested, case-control studies showing disparate results. Whereas the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study found that high levels of CMV antibodies correlated with an increased risk of coranary artery disease (CAD) during a 5year follow-up, 7 the Physicians Health Study did not find any association between CMV or HSV antibodies and myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke over a 12-year follow-up period. 8 The Cardiovascular Health Study found that antibodies to HSV but not CMV were associated with increased risk of MI and cardiovascular death in elderly patients. 9 A number of seroepidemiological studies have suggested an association between H pylori and coronary disease, but many of these studies did not adjust appropriately for potential confounders such as socioeconomic status. 10 However, 1 case-control study which did adjust for age, sex, other cardiac risk factors, and social class found a correlation between H pylori and coronary disease; this relationship may have been caused by an increased prevalence of more virulent H pylori strains in these patients. 11 Unlike the other organisms in question, H pylori has not been detected in atherosclerotic plaque.",

The former is the infectious form and adapted to extracellular survival, whereas the latter is the metabolically active and dividing form, adapted for intracellular multiplication. In addition, the organism may evolve into a bpersistent body,Q an intracellular, metabolically inactive, nonreplicating but viable form that allows it to maintain chronic infection and thereby a state of chronic inflammation that may contribute to the atherosclerotic process.

C pneumoniae antibodies were positively associated with coronary disease in 15 of 16 studies and cerebrovascular diseases in 2 of 2 studies. In the majority of the studies, odds ratios exceeded 2.0. All but 3 of these studies did not adjust for potential confounders. These studies were fairly heterogeneous, varying in the populations studied, the criteria used in defining cardiovascular disease, and the degree of adjustment for confounding variables.

The majority of the studies used microimmunofluorescence (MIF) as the serology test. Since it was first developed, this assay has been recognized to be problematic as the test is not standardized and subject to interlaboratory variation. 20 Interpretation of the slides requires an experienced microscopist, and there is a large subjective component to this assay, leading to poor reproducibility. It is difficult to establish or rule out a diagnosis of C pneumoniae infection by a single MIF titer. Especially in children, acute culture-documented infection can occur without a positive MIF. 21 The high prevalence of infection among the adult population also complicates interpretation of MIF results. One study of healthy adults found that 17% of culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-negative individuals had evidence of bacuteQ infection by MIF. 22 In addition to the problems inherent to the assay, the abovementioned studies were inconsistent in the serological criteria used to define past or chronic persistent infection by the MIF assay. IgG and IgA antibody titer cutoffs varied between studies, and in some cases, titers were selected post hoc after data analysis determined which cutoff provided the strongest association. In a few cases, the same investigators used different criteria in different studies. Another source of potential bias is the lack of blinding of the microscopist performing the MIF assay to the disease status of the patient; only 4 of the studies indicated that blinding occurred.",

The organism acts as a stimulus for chronic inflammation, inducing the production of tissue factor, leukocyte adhesion molecules, and inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) a, and interleukins 1, 2, and 6. 26 TNF-a has been observed to increase the expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules 34 and inhibit lipoprotein lipase, leading to altered lipid metabolism and accumulation of triglycerides in the bloodstream. 35 Increased expression of adhesion molecules promotes leukocyte adherence, migration, and intimal inflammation. These inflammatory cytokines together act to stimulate fibroblast and smooth muscle cell proliferation. They also promote a hypercoagulable state by activating platelets, increasing hepatic synthesis of acute-phase proteins, and inducing tissue factor release from the endothelium with activation of the coagulation cascade. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide antigen acts as a potent stimulus for macrophage activation. 36 In addition, it binds to low-density lipoprotein, which could modify the lipoprotein, making it toxic or immunogenic to endothelial cells, and subsequently lead to foam cell formation. 38 Persistent growth of the organism in situ leads to a state of chronic inflammation, platelet activation, vasospasm, and thrombosis.",

Patients with stable coronary disease differ from those presenting with an acute coronary syndrome. Patients with unstable plaque may have a higher infective burden or be more likely to have active infection and thus may benefit more directly from antibiotic therapy. Two of the published trials, ROXIS and CLARIFY, involved patients with unstable angina or NQWMI, and both demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in cardiovascular events with treatment.

Although the 4 traditional criteria in Koch postulates are not entirely fulfilled, there is evidence to suggest that the organism may be more than simply an innocent bystander. Seroepidemiological data have provided modest support for an association between atherosclerosis and C pneumoniae, although more recent prospective studies have not been as convincing. When interpreting these findings as well as the findings of clinical trials, it is important to consider the limitations of current serological tests, which are unable to distinguish between previous exposure and active persistent endovascular infection. Several studies have shown that positive serology does not necessarily correlate with presence of the organism in atheroma. 20 Although serologies may be used as a screening test, we lack a gold standard that is able to confirm the presence of active infection in the vascular wall. In the same way that cholesterol levels can be accurately tested to evaluate for hyperlipidemia as a potential modifiable risk factor, we need a sensitive and standardized means of identifying active endovascular infection. PCR to detect C pneumoniae DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells may be a better marker of persistent infection and measure of the effect of antichlamydial therapy. 20, 45 Although the organism is not present in all atheromatous plaque (Koch's first postulate), histopathological data suggest that the organism has a tropism for atherosclerotic vascular tissues, with viable organism being cultured from these tissues (Koch's second postulate). However, the difficulty in culturing the organism in vitro and, as described above, the absence of a surrogate marker of active infection pose a diagnostic challenge to determine the presence of an active endovascular infection. Data from animal models provide support for Koch's third postulate as inoculation of the organism into a healthy host has been observed to cause atherosclerotic disease or increase the progression of atherosclerotic lesions in those with preexisting disease. In these same animal studies, after inoculation with the organism, the presence of C pneumoniae in the vessel walls has been confirmed (Koch's fourth postulate.)",

A positive clinical trial would provide additional evidence in favor of a causal relationship, whereas a negative trial would suggest the opposite. However, results from current antibiotic clinical trials are inconclusive, and the effectiveness of therapy may vary between different subsets of patients as seen in the ROXIS and CLARIFY studies compared with the ACADEMIC and WIZARD trials. Patients who present with acute coronary syndrome may derive more direct benefit from antibiotic therapy than those with stable coronary disease. Active chlamydial infection may be involved in plaque rupture, and antibiotics may be an important initial therapy in those presenting with acute coronary syndrome in the same way that aspirin, antiplatelet agents, b-blockers, and statins are used. The results of the PROVE-IT and ACES trials and other ongoing large-scale clinical trials (Table 3) will be important in clarifying the potential role for antibiotics in the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndrome and coronary disease, respectively. 46 There are several other important issues raised by these clinical trials. The metabolically inactive, persistent form of the organism may make its eradication difficult, raising the question of the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy. A longer duration of therapy may be needed to provide bactericidal effects against the organism. If these trials demonstrate a positive treatment benefit, we will need to weigh these benefits against the risk of increasing antimicrobial resistance. An additional area of uncertainty is the degree to which the anti-inflammatory effects of antibiotics account for any of the benefit seen in cardiovascular outcomes.",

The ANTIBIO study examined over 800 acute MI patients randomized to roxithromycin or placebo for 6 weeks and found no difference in mortality or other secondary end points between the two groups at 12 months. The PROVE-IT study was a trial of over 4000 patients admitted with an acute coronary syndrome and did not show any cardiovascular benefit associated with long-term (2 years) treatment with azithromycin. The lack of any benefit seen in these trials suggests that there is currently no role for long term antibiotic treatment (at least with the current antichlamydial therapies available) in the management of coronary artery disease.",
