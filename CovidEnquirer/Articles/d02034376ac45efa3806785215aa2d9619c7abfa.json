In this simulation study, a patient with suspected avian or pandemic infl uenza (API) sought treatment at 9 Australian hospital emergency departments where patient-staff interactions during the fi rst 6 hours of hospitalization were observed. Based on World Health Organization defi nitions and guidelines, the mean number of \"close contacts\" of the API patient was 12.3 (range 6-17; 85% HCWs); mean \"exposures\" were 19.3 (range 15-26). Overall, 20-25 PPE sets were required per patient, with variable HCW compliance for wearing these items (93% N95 masks, 77% gowns, 83% gloves, and 73% eye protection). Up to 41% of HCW close contacts would have qualifi ed for postexposure antiviral prophylaxis. These data indicate that many current national stockpiles of PPE and antiviral medication are likely inadequate for a pandemic.",

The simulated patient was an actor unknown to the hospital staff, who appeared at the triage area of the emergency department and followed a prerehearsed script designed to trigger the hospital protocol for API. The standardized history included a 72-hour period of high fever, cough, shortness of breath, and severe malaise after a recent return from a Southeast Asian country. The patient reported handling unwell live poultry in a rural setting where human cases of avian infl uenza were known to have occurred. This standarized clinical scenario was chosen because guidelines for managing human cases of avian infl uenza (H5N1) form the current template for pandemic infl uenza case management (4, 5, 7) . To heighten staff awareness of the appropriate management of an API case, each hospital organized education sessions on PPE use, infection control practices, and protocol familiarization in the 1-2 weeks before the simulation. Staff members were informed that the simulation would occur at some time during the allocated week (but not the exact day) and were instructed that hospital protocol should be followed as if it were an actual API case.",

These items included PPE worn by HCWs involved in direct patient care (HCW close contacts) and ancillary HCWs who performed indirect clinical tasks associated with the API case-patient such as cleaning, ward support, and specimen transportation and processing.

During the initial 6 hours of hospital assessment, the number of close contacts of a single suspected API patient was high (mean 12.3), with a mean number of exposures of 19.3.

If appropriate PPE, especially N95 masks, were not available, the number of HCWs who would experience moderate-risk API exposure requiring postexposure antiviral prophylaxis would increase substantially. Notably, a substantial minority of close contacts (15%; \u22482 per API patient) were non-HCWs (e.g., hospital patients or visitors), generated primarily in the triage area. Although the duration of unprotected exposure was often short (<5 minutes) for these persons, they represent a potential risk for subsequent community and hospital spread of API. This highlights the importance, in triage and reception areas particularly, of using appropriate infection control measures and signage to assist in cohorting of potential API patients and minimizing exposure of unprotected bystanders.",

Planning for suffi cient numbers of resource items is complex and dependent on estimations of pandemicrelated additional emergency presentations, hospitalizations, general practice, and outpatient visits. In Australia, offi cial estimates of additional hospitalizations range from 57,900 to 148,000 (4). Our data suggest that management of this number of hospitalizations without regard for suspected infl uenza patients who are assessed but who are not suffi ciently ill to require admission, would require from 1,123,260 to 3,714,800 PPE sets (depending on whether they were N95 masks, gowns, or gloves, or all 3 items). Although ascertaining (from these data) the number of courses of postexposure antiviral prophylaxis required is diffi cult, if stocks of readily available PPE were inadequate, the number of courses of antiviral medication required would likely increase dramatically, up to 12-13 courses per suspected API case during the initial 6-hour assessment. Thus, adequate stocks of PPE provide a means of protecting valuable antiviral drug stockpiles for use in ill or heavily exposed persons.",

            "text": "An important consideration when extrapolating our data to other healthcare systems is that recommendations regarding the optimal form of respiratory protection vary between countries. The WHO interim guidelines for management of human cases of avian infl uenza (AI) state, \"HCWs working with AI-infected patients should select the highest level of respiratory protection available, preferably a particulate respirator\u2026 designed to protect the wearer from respiratory aerosols expelled by others\" (7) . This recommendation is refl ected in the Australian pandemic infl uenza guidelines (3) and explains the high use of N95 masks in our study. However, pandemic infl uenza plans in the United Kingdom (5), United States (6), and Canada (16) currently recommend the use of surgical masks for close patient care, unless the HCW is engaged in procedures in which aerosolization occurs. Thus the proportion of N95 masks to surgical masks required will vary between countries with different guidelines, which affects assessment of stockpile adequacy. Our study did not assess the relative effi cacy of N95 masks compared with surgical masks for protection against API transmission. This study has several limitations. First, the duration of the study was short (6 hours), much shorter than the likely in-hospital stay of days for a patient with severe infl uenza. Thus, total PPE and antiviral agent usage per admission is likely to be substantially higher. Second, the study was conducted at a less busy time of day for emergency departments and therefore may not refl ect the greater number of persons who would likely be exposed in the triage and emergency department areas during busier periods. Third, the patient was not clinically unwell or hypoxic; thus, relatively few HCWs were required to assess, manage, or review the API patient's condition. Fourth, we observed the management of the index API case-patient alone, although we acknowledge that actual patients are likely to come to the hospital with other household members (high-risk close contacts). However, extending observation to include management of asymptomatic but potentially infectious accompanying persons in a standardized manner would have substantially increased the complexity of the exercise. Our fi ndings, therefore, likely underestimate the true resources required and contacts exposed for the management of a genuine API patient. Finally, the presence of observers and the preceding education sessions may have artifi cially increased compliance with PPE use, although in the event of a true pandemic one might assume that HCW compliance rates would be high as they aim to minimize their personal risk. Also, this study was designed to quantify the use of PPE in an environment with raised awareness of infection control practice, mimicking that which might occur during a pandemic, and thus provide relevant data for health resource planners.",
