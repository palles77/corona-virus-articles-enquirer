We processed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) 91 to interrogate the transcriptome of cholangiocytes in human liver ductal organoids.

We isolated and plaque-purified the SARS-CoV-2 from a COVID-19 111 patient in Shanghai. The liver ductal organoids from two individuals were inoculated 112 with SARS-CoV-2 for 1 hour then re-embedded in Matrigel and maintained in culture Statistical analysis. 249 We employed Student's t-test or ANOVA test to analyze the parametric 250 experimental results.

However, the mode of virus transmission and 29 tissue tropism is not well established yet. Recent findings of substantial liver 30 damage in patients and ACE2+ cholangiocytes in healthy liver tissues prompted us 31 to hypothesize that human liver ductal organoids could serve as a model to 32 determine the susceptibility and mechanisms underlining the liver damage upon 33 SARS-CoV-2 infection. By single-cell RNA sequencing, we found that long-term liver 34 ductal organoid culture preserved the human specific ACE2+ population of 35 cholangiocytes. Moreover, human liver ductal organoids were permissive to 36 SARS-CoV-2 infection and support robust replication. Notably, virus infection 37 impaired the barrier and bile acid transporting functions of cholangiocytes through 38 dysregulation of genes involved in tight junction formation and bile acid 39 transportation, which could explain the bile acid accumulation and consequent 40 liver damage in patients. These results indicate that control of liver damage caused 41 directly by viral infection should be valued in treating COVID-19 patients.",

The expression of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein was 115 readily detected in patchy areas of human liver ductal organoids whereas no signal 116 was found in uninfected control (Figure 2A). In addition, the infected cholangiocytes 117 underwent membrane fusion and formed syncytia (Figure 2A, enlarge). Although the 118 number of infected cholangiocytes was limited, qRT-PCR analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 119 genomic RNAs revealed a dramatic increase of viral load in organoids at 24 hours 120 post infection (Figure 2B). These data demonstrate that human liver ductal organoids 121 are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and support robust viral replication. The 122 recapitulation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human organoids suggests that this model 123 could be employed to dissect the viral pathogenesis and to test antivirals. 2B), probably due to virus-induced death of host cholangiocytes or activation 129 of anti-viral response. This promoted us to detect whether SARS-CoVfunction of cholangiocytes in homeostasis is to transport bile acid 132 secreted by hepatocytes into bile ducts. The tight junction between cholangiocytes 133 maintains the barrier function of bile ductal epithelium, which is essential for bile 134 acid collection and excretion. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection ablated the 135 expression of Claudin1 (Figure 3), suggesting that the barrier function of 136 cholangiocytes was disrupted. More importantly, the expression of two major bile 137 acid transporters, apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) and cystic 138 fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), was significantly reduced 139 following SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 3). These data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 140 infection impairs the barrier and bile acid transporting functions of cholangiocytes 141 through modulating the expression of genes involved in tight junction formation and 142 bile acid transportation. Our study therefore supports the idea that the liver damage 143 in COVID-19 patients might be resulted from direct cholangiocyte injury and 144 consequent bile acid accumulation induced by viral infection. host-microbe interaction 16 . Here we demonstrated that long-term human 148 liver ductal organoid culture preserves the human specific ACE2+ population of 149 cholangiocytes. The SARS-CoV-2 exposure experiments revealed that the virus infects 150 and replicates efficiently in these organoids. To our knowledge, this is the first 151 SARS-CoV-2-human organoid infection model reported. Given that the culture 152 conditions for various organoids (lung, intestine and kidney) have been established, it 153 would be intriguing to study the tropism, replication, and innate immune response of 154 SARS-CoV-2 infection in other organs that are targeted by this virus. 155 It appears that liver dysfunction or damage in severe patients with COVID-19 is a 156 common but unignored phenomena. The improper use of anti-viral drugs may be 157 hepatotoxic and cause liver damage. On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection may 158 trigger overwhelming inflammatory response and lead to tissue injury at multi-organ 159 levels including the liver 2 . In this study, by using the human liver ductal organoids as 160 model, we have clearly shown that SARS-CoV-2 can infect the cholangiocytes and 161 impair their barrier and bile acid transporting functions. This could be due to the 162 direct viral cytopathogenic effect on target cells that express the ACE2 as entry 163 receptor. The viral infection may also down-regulate the expression of host genes 164 involved in the formation of tight junction and transportation of bile acid. Thus, it is 165 noteworthy to take into account the fact that the liver damage in COVID-19 patients 166 might be in part the result of direct cholangiocyte injury and consequent bile human liver ductal organoids, we have investigated the infection and 170 liver tissue damage of SARS-CoV-2 ex vivo.

All 184 experiments involving virus infections were done in biosafety level 3 ductal organoid culture and SARS-CoV-2 infection. 188 The human ductal organoids were generated from primary bile ducts isolated 189 from human liver biopsies as described by Huch et al 17 . The organoids embedded in 190 Matrigel (Corning, 356231) were scrambled off the plate and collected in tubes, then 191 washed with cold PBS by pipetting the material up and down for 10 times. After 192 centrifugation (2 min at 250 g), the organoid pellet was suspended with medium 193 containing 5 \u03bcM Y-27632 (Sigma-Aldrich, Y0503).

The organoids were then 204 washed with PBST (PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) and blocked by 5% BSA in PBST 205 for 1 hour at room temperature. Organoids were incubated with the primary 206 antibodies at 4 \u00b0C overnight, washed with PBST 3 times, and incubated with the 207 secondary antibodies and DAPI for 1 hour at room temperature.

            "text": ". A national wide clinical study collecting 56 1,099 COVID-19 patients revealed that around 20% of patients had elevated ALT and AST and around 10% of patients had elevated TBIL. Especially, the percentage of 58 patients with liver damage is much higher in severe patients than that in non-severe 59 ones 2 . Although the clinical correlation has been implicated, it is still unclear whether 60 the liver damage is caused by direct virus infection in the liver or by systematic 61 reasons such as cytokine storm. Viruses bind to host receptors to initiate the infection. Recent studies have 63 demonstrated that both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV use the same 64 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein to enter the cells 6-10 . It has been 65 shown that ACE2 expression is widely distributed across human tissues, including 66 lung, liver, kidney and multiple digestive tract organs 11-13 . A significant enrichment of ACE2+ population in cholangiocytes compared to hepatocytes in human healthy liver 68 was reported recently 14 , implying that SARS-CoV-2 might directly target ACE2+ 69 cholangiocytes in patients. However, whether the virus indeed infects human 70 cholangiocytes thus causes local damage has not been addressed yet. At present, due to the lack of suitable research models, studies on mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis mainly depend on bioinformatics analysis, clinical 73 characteristics and rare autopsy reports 15 .
