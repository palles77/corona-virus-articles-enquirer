The conference recommendations were published in the International Guidelines 2000 for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care. 1 The goal of every resuscitation organisation and resuscitation expert is to prevent premature cardiovascular death. When cardiac arrest or life-threatening emergencies occur, prompt and skillful response can make the difference between life and death and between intact survival and debilitation. This document summarises the 2010 evidence evaluation of published science about the recognition and response to sudden life-threatening events, particularly sudden cardiac arrest and peri-arrest events in victims of all ages. The broad range and number of topics reviewed necessitated succinctness in the consensus science statements and brevity in treatment recommendations. This supplement is not a comprehensive review of every aspect of resuscitation medicine; not all topics reviewed in 2005 were reviewed in 2010. This executive summary highlights the evidence evaluation and treatment recommendations of the 2010 evidence evaluation process.

Separate writing groups were formed to coordinate evidence evaluation for defibrillation and mechan- ical devices because these overlapped with both BLS and ALS. Each task force identified topics requiring evidence evaluation and invited international experts to review them. To ensure a consistent and thorough approach, a worksheet template was created with step-by-step directions to help the experts document their literature reviews, evaluate studies, determine levels of evidence (Table 1) , and develop treatment recommendations (see Part 3: Evidence Evaluation Process). 4 When possible, 2 expert reviewers were invited to perform independent evaluations for each topic. The worksheet authors submitted their search strategies to 1 of 3 worksheet review experts. The lead evidence evaluation expert also reviewed all worksheets and assisted the worksheet authors in ensuring consistency and quality in the evidence evaluation. This process is described in detail in Part 3. 4 In conjunction with the International First Aid Science Advisory Board, the AHA established an additional task force to review evidence on first aid. This topic is summarised in Part 13. The evidence review followed the same process but was not part of the formal ILCOR review.",

A final total of 277 specific resuscitation questions, each in standard PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) format, were considered by 356 worksheet authors who reviewed thousands of relevant, peer-reviewed publications. Many of these worksheets were presented and discussed at monthly or semimonthly task force international web conferences (i.e., \"webinars\" that involved conference calls with simultaneous internet conferencing). Beginning in May 2009 the evidence review and summary portions of the evidence evaluation worksheets, with worksheet author conflict of interest (COI) statements, were posted on the ILCOR Web site (www.ilcor.org).

COI disclosure was required from all participants and was updated annually or when changes occurred. Commercial relationships were considered at every stage of the evidence evaluation process and, depending on the nature of the relationship and their role in the evidence evaluation process, participants were restricted from some activities (i.e., leading, voting, deciding, writing, discussing) that directly or indirectly related to that commercial interest. While the focus of the process was the evaluation of the scientific evidence, attention was given to potential COI throughout the CoSTR process.

We must increase the effectiveness and efficiency of instruction, improve skills retention, and reduce barriers to action for both basic and ALS providers. Similarly, the placement and use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in the community should be encouraged to enable defibrillation within the first minutes after a ventricular fibrillation (VF) sudden cardiac arrest.",

The most significant adult BLS change in this document is a recommendation for a CAB (compressions, airway, breathing) sequence instead of an ABC (airway, breathing, compressions) sequence to minimise delay to initiation of compressions and resuscitation. In other words, rescuers of adult victims should begin resuscitation with compressions rather than opening the airway and delivery of breaths.",

Once an advanced airway (tracheal tube or supraglottic airway) has been inserted, rescuers should provide continuous chest compressions (without pauses for ventilations) and ventilations at a regular rate (avoiding hyperventilation).",

It may be difficult or impossible to assess the contribution of any one action (energy level for defibrillation, airway maneuver, drug) on the most important outcomes, such as neurologically intact survival to discharge. In fact, it is likely that it is the combination of actions, each performed correctly, in time and in order, that results in optimal survival and function. A few studies give insight into this necessary shift from studying of changes in individual actions (point improvements) to studying the effects of changing the entire sequence of actions (flow improvement). 21,22 The compression-ventilation ratio was one of the most controversial topics of the 2005 International Consensus Conference. The experts began the 2005 conference acknowledging that rates of survival from cardiac arrest to hospital discharge were low, averaging \u22646% internationally, 23, 24 and that survival rates had not increased substantially in recent years. That observation led to the 2005 change to a universal compression-ventilation ratio for all lone rescuers of victims of all ages and to an emphasis on the importance of CPR quality throughout the 2005 Consensus on CPR and ECC Science With Treatment Recommendations (CoSTR) document and subsequent ILCOR member council guidelines. 25 Resuscitation outcomes vary considerably among regions. 26, 27 In recent studies the outcome from cardiac arrest, particularly from shockable rhythms, is improved. [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] Moreover, there is an association between implementation of new resuscitation guidelines and improved outcome. 31, 33 However, there is also evidence that new guidelines can take from 1.5 to 4 years to implement. 34, 35 There have been many developments in resuscitation science since 2005 and these are highlighted below.",

Therapeutic hypothermia has been shown independently to improve outcome after adult witnessed out-of-hospital VF cardiac arrest and after neonatal hypoxic-ischaemic insult. Since 2005, two nonrandomised studies with concurrent controls indicated possible benefit of hypothermia after cardiac arrest from other initial rhythms in-hospital and out-of-hospital, 55, 56 and other studies with historic controls have shown benefit for therapeutic hypothermia after out-of-hospital all-rhythm cardiac arrests in adults. 22, [57] [58] [59] [60] Studies of newborns with birth asphyxia 61, 62 showed that therapeutic hypothermia (33.5-34.5 \u2022 C) up to 72 h after resuscitation has an acceptable safety profile and was associated with better survival and long-term neurological outcome.

Such strategies also reduce cost by reducing unnecessary hospital admissions and improve patient safety through accurate identification of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). \u2022 The acquisition of a prehospital 12-lead ECG is essential for identification of STEMI patients before hospital arrival and should be used in conjunction with prearrival hospital notification and concurrent activation of the catheterisation laboratory. \u2022 Nonphysicians can be trained to independently interpret 12-lead ECGs to identify patients with STEMI. This skill is of particular value in the prehospital setting, where paramedics can independently identify STEMI, thus reducing the need for ECG transmission, which is not always possible. \u2022 Computer-assisted ECG interpretation can be used to increase diagnostic accuracy of diagnosis for STEMI when used alone or in combination with ECG interpretation by a trained healthcare provider. \u2022 STEMI systems of care can be implemented to improve the time to treatment. The following measures have been shown to reduce the time to primary PCI (PPCI): institutional commitment, use of a team-based approach, arranging single-call activation of the catheterisation laboratory by the emergency physician or prehospital provider, requiring the catheterisation laboratory to be ready in 20 min, having an experienced cardiologist always available, and providing real-time data feedback. \u2022 IV \u2424-blockers should not be given routinely in the ED or prehospital setting but rather should be reserved for a subset of patients with hypertension or tachycardia in the setting of ACS. \u2022 The routine use of high-flow supplementary oxygen in ACS is not recommended. Instead oxygen administration should be guided by arterial oxyhaemoglobin saturation. \u2022 Reinforce the need for time targets for reperfusion beginning from the time of first medical contact. The clinical circumstances that favor fibrinolysis and PCI are discussed, including the role of prehospital fibrinolytics. \u2022 The prophylactic use of antiarrhythmics is discouraged.",
