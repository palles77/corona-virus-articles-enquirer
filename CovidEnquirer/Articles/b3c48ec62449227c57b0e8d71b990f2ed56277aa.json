The cat's respiratory signs improved and the uveitis was less severe, but 6 days later a neuropathy developed, with flaccid paralysis of the tail and proprioceptive deficits of the hindlimbs. Treatment was maintained at the owner's request until the cat died 3 days later. A post-mortem examination was not performed. This is the first reported case of FIP in which skin lesions have been recognised as a feature of the disease. The nodular erythematous skin lesions were associated with pyogranulomatous phlebitis and periphlebitis in the dermis. The presence of FCoV antigen within a significant proportion of macrophages in these infiltrates demonstrated their association with FIP. This case also illustrates the important role of histopathology and immunohistology for the premortem diagnosis of FIP. In this case the clinical signs were consistent with a number of possible diagnoses, the most likely of which were considered to be FIP, lymphosarcoma, feline leukaemia virus-associated disease, feline immunodeficiency virus-associated disease and toxoplasmosis. FIP was suspected because of the presence of clinical, clinicopathological and histopathological findings that were consistent with the disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of numerous FCoV antigen-positive macrophages within the granulomatous lesions, a finding only seen in, and therefore pathognomonic for, FIP (Kipar et al 1998, in press) .",

An elevated a 1 -glycoprotein concentration is frequently seen in cats with FIP, but is a non-specific feature of inflammatory diseases in general, and is also found in terminal stages of FIV (Duthie et al 1997) . An albumin:globulin ratio of less than 0.6, mild non-regenerative anaemia, lymphopenia and mild hyperbilirubinaemia are also common findings with FIP but are not specific to the disease (Sparkes et al 1994) . In this cat the CoV antibody titre was zero and this was an unusual feature of the case. A positive CoV antibody titre is not a universal finding in cats with FIP (Sparkes et al 1994 , Gaskell and Dawson 2000 , Lappin 2003 ) and negative CoV antibody titres may occur in cats affected by either 'effusive' or 'non-effusive' forms of the disease (Sparkes et al 1991 , Harvey et al 1996 , Paltrinieri et al 1998 . A number of explanations have been postulated, including lack of circulating CoV antibodies due to immune-complexing with CoV antigen and loss of ability to produce antibodies in the terminal stages of disease (Hoskins 2001) .",

One of the morphological hallmarks of FIP is a granulomatous to necrotising phlebitis and periphlebitis (Hayashi et al 1977 , Weiss et al 1980 , Kipar et al 1998 which was recently shown to be triggered by activated monocytes which attach to venous endothelial cells, migrate out of the veins, thereby destroying the basal lamina, and then accumulate perivascularly (Kipar et al in press) . The process appears to be cytokine-mediated (Kipar et al in press ). The morphological features (predominance of macrophages) and distribution (only veins are affected) of vascular lesions in FIP do not support a primarily immune complex-mediated development of vasculitis, although FCoV immune complexes may well participate in the disease (Jennette and Falk 1995, Kipar et al in press) .",

However, phlebitis in, for example, lungs and liver has been shown (Hayashi et al 1977 , Weiss et al 1980 and the present report demonstrates that dermal veins can also be affected.",
