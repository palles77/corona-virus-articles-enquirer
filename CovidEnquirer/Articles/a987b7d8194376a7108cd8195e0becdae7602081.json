A new variant strain of PEDV emerged in the US in the late December, 2013. This variant strain of PEDV differs from the virulent strain of PEDV currently circulating in the US in 1170 nt of the 5'end of the S1 domain in the spike gene. Importantly, the variant PEDV caused significantly less mortality in piglets than the virulent PEDV, based on clinical observations. This suggests it may be a potential vaccine candidate for PED. Variant PEDV has been detected in samples from multiple states by our laboratory as well as other laboratories in the US. It is critical to detect and differentiate variant PEDV from the virulent PEDV during outbreaks to enhance control and to prevent PED associated disease. In this study, the development and validation of a duplex real-time RT-PCR assay for detection and differentiation of the variant and the virulent strains of PEDV currently circulating in the US was reported.",

PED is a highly contagious diarrheal disease, characterized by severe watery diarrhea and high mortality in piglets. PED was originally identified in England in 1971 (Oldham, 1972) . Since then, it has been reported in several European and Asian countries including China and Korea. Since 2010, a highly virulent strain of PEDV emerged in China and caused significant loss in the pig industry (Sun et al., 2012) . In May 2013, this virulent strain of PEDV was recognized in the United States (US). By March 8 of 2014, PED had been detected in 27 US states and a total 4458 cases were confirmed (http://www.aasv.org/pedv/PEDv weekly report 140312.pdf). The disease has caused severe economic losses to the swine industry in the US. Recently the virus was found in Canada.",

Recently, we reported a new variant PEDV detected in Ohio . Clinical observation indicated that this new variant virus (OH 851) caused mild clinical disease with low mortality in newborn piglets (unpublished data), making it a potential vaccine candidate. Strain OH 851 is distinct from the virulent strains of PEDV in the US and is most closely related to CH/HBQX/10 reported in central China (Zheng et al., 2013) , based on the phylogenetic analysis of the full-length spike gene . Further analysis showed that the strain OH851 differs from the virulent strains of PEDV in the first 1170 nucleotides (nt) of spike gene, indicating that at least two genotypes of PEDV are circulating in the US pigs (Stevenson et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014) .",

            "text": "Since effective vaccines are not currently available in North America, accurate diagnosis combined with biosecurity is the only reliable method for control and prevention of PED. Electron microscopy was widely used in the diagnosis of the initial outbreaks of PEDV (Pospischil et al., 1981) . Since then, several methods have been developed for laboratory diagnosis of PEDV, including the direct immunofluorescence test for detection of PEDV antigen (Guscetti et al., 1998) , enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays (ELISA) for detection of either PEDV antigen or antibodies (Carvajal et al., 1995) , and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Kwon et al., 1997; Ishikawa et al., 1997 years, real-time RT-PCR has increasingly been used to detect viral pathogens because of its advantages including high specificity and sensitivity, fast turnaround, and quantification of pathogen loads. Currently, the Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory in the Ohio Department of Agriculture uses a real-time RT-PCR method which targets the membrane (M) gene for detection of PEDV. However, since the M gene is highly conserved between the virulent and the variant strains of PEDV in the US, this real-time RT-PCR assay cannot differentiate between the two strains of PEDV. Therefore, the present study sought to develop and evaluate a duplex real-time RT-PCR method to distinct between the virulent and the variant strains of PEDVs.",

Since there is no PEDV vaccine available in North America, it is important to take biosecurity strategies to control PED. The findings of a recent study demonstrated that PEDV was found in 5.2% of trailers used to transport pigs, highlighting the importance of strict biosecurity (Lowe et al., 2014) .",

It is possible that the third deletion and insertion site may also be used as a target for designing primers and probes (Fig. 1) . The assay is specific for PEDVs, since cross-reaction with non-PED viral genomes used in this study was not detected.
