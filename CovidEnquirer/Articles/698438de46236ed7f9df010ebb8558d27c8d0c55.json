            "text": "Synthesis of C-nucleoside and carbocyclic nucleoside analogs has been inspired by their interesting biological activities as well as chemical and enzymatic stability. C-Nucleosides are a unique class of compounds in which the heterocycle is connected to the sugar moiety by a C-C bond instead of a C-N bond of the natural nucleosides. As a result, they are resistant to the chemical and enzymatic hydrolytic cleavage of the glycosidic bond. C-Nucleosides have received considerable attention due not only to their chemical stability, but also for their interesting biological activities of naturally occurring compounds such as showdomycin, formycins, oxazinomycin, pyrazomycin, etc. 1 Also several biologically active synthetic C-nucleosides such as 9-deazaadenosine, 2 pseudoisocytidine, 3 and thiazofurin 4 have been reported to possess both antitumor and antiviral activities. Carbocyclic nucleosides are another class of metabolically stable nucleosides, in which a methylene group replaces the oxygen in the furan ring of the natural nucleosides. 5 The natural carbocyclic nucleosides such as neplanocin 6 and aristeromycin 7 were isolated from microorganisms and were found to possess various biological activities including antiviral and antitumor activities. The synthetic carbocyclic nucleosides, abacavir, 8 entecavir, 9 and lobucavir, 10 have shown promising antiviral activities. Recently, abacavir and entecavir were approved by the FDA as an anti-HIV agent and anti-hepatitis B virus agent, respectively.",

Although some carbocyclic nucleosides and C-nucleosides are naturally occurring, so far no natural carbocyclic C-nucleosides have been identified. The history of the synthesis of carbocyclic C-nucleosides dates back to 1960s. 11 Despite the long history of both carbocyclic and C-nucleosides, only a few carbocyclic C-nucleosides have been synthesized, 12 probably due to the synthetic difficulties of these nucleosides. As part of our ongoing program toward synthesis of novel nucleosides, we were exploring the synthesis of cyclopentenyl carbocyclic nucleosides with unnatural bases. 13 Therefore, it was of great interest to synthesize optically Chemistry 15 (2007) [839] [840] [841] [842] [843] [844] [845] [846] active carbocyclic C-nucleosides, possessing a cyclopentenyl moiety as analogs of neplanocin.

The optimal temperature was found to be 55\u00b0C for this reaction, since at 70\u00b0C the starting material decomposed. The assignment of b-configuration of 7 was performed by proton NOE experiments. 13a Selective reduction of ester group of 7 with DIBAL-H, followed by condensation with aminoacetonitrile bisul-fate in the presence of sodium acetate, gave the pyrrole precursor 9. 12a Protection of the amino nitrogen of 9 as a carbamate with ethylchloroformate followed by cyclization catalyzed by 1, 8-diazabicyclo[5.4 .0]-undec-7-ene (DBU) and subsequent deprotection of carbamate with sodium carbonate led to the substituted pyrrole 10.
