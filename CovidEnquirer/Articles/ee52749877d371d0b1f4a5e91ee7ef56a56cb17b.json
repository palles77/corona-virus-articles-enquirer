Pneumatosis intestinalis can be subtle, and much time and discussion are expended in NICUs debating its presence or absence. This sign is often confused with gas mixed with stool or blood. It would be advantageous to have other objective tests to substantiate the diagnosis of NEC. Several methods aimed at detecting increased production of hydrogen gas, although currently not universally available, are worthy of comment. Malin and co-workers63 reported the incidental finding of echocardiographic evidence of microbubbles in the circulation of an asymptomatic neonate who later developed fulminant NEC and expired. In a subsequent report by Merritt and colleagues,65 12 infants with NEC demonstrated a characteristic ultrasonographic pattern of intermittent hepatic parenchymal and portal venous microbubbles of gas. Ultrasonic evidence of abnormal gas was seen in the absence of pneumatosis intestinalis or portal gas on x-ray examination in five patients. 65 Another potential diagnostic tool is the analysis of breath hydrogen excretion. Kirschner et al. 46 have demonstrated increased levels of hydrogen gas in breath samples of infants with NEC. Finally, Garcia and colleagues 33 studied urine samples from nine infants with confirmed NEC for the presence of D-Iactate. D-Iactate is known to be produced in large quantities by the bacterial enteric flora of ruminates fed excessive amounts of carbohydrates. This group found markedly elevated levels of D-Iactate in infants with NEC. Nonetheless, each of these new methods requires much further testing before it can aid the clinician in the diagnosis of infants with NEC.",

There are many forms of gastrointestinal disease that have been classified within the spectrum of NEC. Leonidas -l and Ra1l 6 ! described seven infants with what they termed neonatal pneumatosis coli. All infants had mild systemic signs, grossly bloody stools, and pneumatosis intestinalis limited to the colon. All responded rapidly to standard medical therapy. The authors labeled this as a mild form of NEe and emphasized an excellent prognosis. These infants fulfill criteria for Stage IIA. Richmond and Mikity73 have also described a similar group of seven infants with what they labeled \"benign necrotizing enterocolitis.\" Again, these infants generally had mild systemic and gastrointestinal symptoms and signs. Nonetheless, their abdominal radiographs showed surprisingly extensive pneumatosis intestinalis. Five of the seven infants had pneumatosis intestinalis limited to the colon; two infants also had portal venous air. Again, the prognosis for \"benign NEe\" was excellent. This benign end of the spectrum of disease, which is clinically and radiologically identical to NEe, is expanded in a report by Powell 70 of two infants with bloody diarrhea associated with pneumatosis intestinalis. Both infants developed symptoms while being fed a standard cow's milk protein formula. After standard treatment for NEe, the patients improved, but NEe recurred whenever challenged with a cow's milk or soy-based formula. Aziz 6 described another term infant with a presentation similar to that reported by Powell. Peripheral blood eosinophilia or specific mucosal biopsy findings may be helpful to identify an immunologic component in this group of patients. The number of term infants included in this category of NEe emphasizes the need to include the diagnosis of NEe in the differential diagnosis of bloody diarrhea in previously well full-term newborns with presumed milk allergy.",

In addition, the final mucosal pathology may be the result of simultaneous events that produce synergistic damage. 49, 53 Mechanisms of mucosal injury that have been implicated to be important in the pathogenesis of NEe include gastrointestinal and immunologic immaturity, ischemia, colonization by and subsequent invasiveness of pathogenic enteric bacteria, isolated intestinal bacterial overgrowth, excess bacterial substrate, and immunologic injury from milk protein allergy.",

Cutting the umbilical cord requires a rapid and smooth transition to enteral feeding to ensure adequate postnatal growth. Much of this adaptation seems to require a local intestinal factor or stimulus and not a specific gestational age; even a very premature infant can thrive on enteral feedings many weeks \"too soon\" in terms of biologic maturity. There is increasing evidence that enteral feedings may be the critical element that initiates functional postnatal intestinal maturation via the release of gut peptide hormones. 5 Knowledge of the processes controlling maturation are nonetheless incomplete. There is evidence, however, that levels of important potentially trophic gastrointestinal hormones are different in unfed infants, infants given bolus feedings, and continuously enterally fed infants. 4, 62 Whether prolonged periods without enteral feedings or the artificial nature of timed bolus nasogastric feedings in an immature infant contributes to the pathogenesis of NEC is presently unknown.",

At birth, the human intestinal mucosa has no secretory 19A, the major gastrointestinal immunoprotective antibody.35 Human breast milk contains many immuno-active components, including sIgA, leukocytes, lysozyme, and lactobacillus growth factors. All of these are thought to be protective against gastrointestinal infection; indeed, the incidence of neonatal sepsis and diarrhea has been suggested to be lower among breast milk fed infants. 40, 49 These observations, combined with experiments in an animal model of NEC in which fresh breast milk protected newborn rats from a disease similar to NEC, led many investigators to hope that human milk feedings might be equally protective in human neonates. Unfortunately, this has not been demonstrated in the premature human; NEC is well documented in neonates exclusively fed human milk. 31, 51, 67, 72, 96 Enteral Feeding Perhaps more so than in any other area, conflicting opinions exist regarding the relationship of enteral feeding practices and the development of NEC. Ninety to 95 per cent of all infants who develop NEC have been enterally fed. 17, 46, 51, 66, 50, 81 Although hyperosmolar elemental formulas 13 and possibly hyperosmolar medications 92 have been associated with gastrointestinal mucosal injury and, subsequently, an increased incidence of NEC, other proposed theories of the role of oral feedings in the pathogenesis of NEC have not been proved, One hypothesis of the relationship of enteral feedings and the etiology of NEC holds that the volume and absolute rate of enteral feedings contribute to NEC, Brown and Sweet1 6 advocate a cautious feeding schedule to prevent the development of this disease based on retrospective review of their experience. These neonatologists propose that a 1000-gm infant should be fed slowly and not be advanced to full enteral feeding until 2 weeks into the feeding protocol. Distention, hematest positive stools, or apnea warrants stopping enteral feedings for various periods of time. The risk of such a cautious approach is that of limiting enteral feedings at the time that may be critical to the postnatal adaptation of the intestine. Furthermore, there is a paucity of prospective studies related to feeding practices and the development ofNEC. In the only prospective, randomized trial, Book and associates J4 demonstrated that two rates of formula volume increments (10 mllkg/day vs. 20 ml/kg/day), designed to reach a reasonable maximum of 140 mllkg/day, did not result in differences in the incidence of NEC. Goldman 34 reported in a retrospective uncontrolled study that an increased incidence of NEC occurred during a period when large absolute feeding volumes (greater than 150 mllkg/day) or large increments in volume (greater than 60 ml/kg/day) were introduced into his nursery. Furthermore, Anderson and colleagues 3 retrospectively compared 19 infants with endemic NEC to 38 controls matched by birthweight and the time of admission. They found a highly significant difference in the daily increment of enteral feedings; patients with NEC had their feedings increased by a mean of 28 mllkg/day, whereas on the same day, the control infants had their feedings increased by 17 ml/kg/day. The present issue of \"how much is too much?\" remains unresolved, but caution should be taken in that large increments of formula may stress the immature bowel.",

Touloukian and colleagues 88 developed an ischemic model of NEC in newborn piglets. They linked the \"diving reflex,\" well documented during submersion in marine mammals, to the response during neonatal systemic hypoxia. During this reflex, the brain and heart are selectively perfused while blood is shunted away from other vascular beds, including the intestines. Factors implicated in the hypoxia-ischemic pathogenesis of NEC are many of the events commonly seen in high-risk premature infants: perinatal asphyxia, respiratory distress syndrome, hypothermia, hypotension, umbilical vessel catheterization, patent ductus arteriosus, and exchange transfusion (see Table 1 ). Nonetheless, these risk factors are often present among many infants in a NICU, and NEC does not develop in the majority of these infants. Furthermore, when studies compared control infants matched for gestational age with patients with NEC, few risk factors were consistently identified. 32, 50, 85, 93, 96 In addition, NEC has been observed among premature infants without identifiable risk factors. 48 , 68, 96 Umbilical arterial catheterization has been implicated as a potentially ischemic event that might predispose to NEC. 13 , 14, 19, 44, 60, 93 Large vessel thromboemboli have been a rare and inconsistent pathologic finding in patients dying with NEC. 34 , 45 If the arterial catheter is indeed a factor, infants with catheters above the orifices of the mesenteric arteries should be at a higher risk than those with lower lying catheters. In a prospective trial of 341 infants randomized to high or low umbilical arterial catheter, the incidences of NEC in patients with catheters above and below the mesenteric arteries were similar. 52 Neonatal polycythemia has been consistently demonstrated in controlled studies to be a risk factor for NEC.I2, 58, 93 It is unclear whether the hyperviscosity accompanying polycythemia results in sluggish gastrointestinal blood flow or whether the partial exchange transfusion used to treat polycythemia is the etiology of the ischemia. Work by LeBlanc and associates 59 in newborn dogs suggests that the hyperviscosity rather than the exchange transfusion is the cause.",

Pathogens implicated thus far include: Escherichia coli, 25, 83 Klebsiella, 42, 74 Enterobac'ter,71 Pseudomonas, 41, 89 Salmonella, 84 Clostridia species, 20, 30, 38, 43 Coronavirus, 21, 79 Rotavirus,77 and enteroviruses. 55 Nonetheless, in most cases, no single enteric pathogen has been consistently isolated from each epidemic of NEC.2 Confounding the issue are asymptomatic carriers who have also been reported during epidemics. Thus, it would seem that bacteria or viruses alone may not be sufficient to result in disease. Furthermore, most epidemics of NEC have not had any enteric virus of bacteria isolated from affected infants. 2 Nevertheless, epidemics have been terminated by routine infection control procedures such as cohorting of nurses and patients, strict isolation, and handwashing. 15 , 47 Other investigators have reported a reduction in the incidence of NEC (prevention) in babies treated with oral aminoglycosides. 7 , 28, 36 Lawrence and associates 56 proposed that because of the sterile NICU environment and liberal use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, there may be a delay in the normal bacterial colonization of the neonatal intestine. Under these circumstances, they suggested that colonization with only one or a few species may alter the intestinal flora. It was postulated that the lack of competition among normal members of the gastrointestinal flora might contribute to the initiation of NEC. Yale and Balish,94 in studies with germ free and monocolonized animals, have demonstrated a spectrum of bacterial virulence, with certain strains inherently more virulent than others. In their studies, Clostridium perfringens was lethal in 99 per cent of animals, and E. coli was lethal in 77 per cent. Kosloske 53 went on to further postulate that elaboration of excessive amounts of bacterial toxin may be the critical initiator of intestinal necrois.",

These are obligate anaerobes with a propensity to infect ischemic tissue; they also produce hydrogen gas and enteric toxins. There are naturally occurring clostridial diseases in animals and humans that result in gastrointestinal disease with striking similarities to NEC. Pulpy kidney disease is seen in newborn lambs exposed to an increased carbohydrate load. The disease is characterized by intestinal dilatation, bloody stools, and, frequently, death; it is due to C. perfringens Type B enterotoxin. 26 There are also models for clostridia enterotoxin-mediated disease in humans. Highlanders of New Guinea contract a disease similar to NEC whenever a period of relative starvation is followed by a pig feast. These victims develop NEC characterized by abdominal distention, bloody diarrhea, and shock. Pathologic examination of clinical specimens reveals areas of submucosal and subserosal cellulitis, and gangrene. Pigbel is due to C. perfringens Type C enterotoxin and can be prevented by immunization with clostridial toxoid. 57 The analogies between these diseases and neonatal NEC are obvious and have fueled the search for clostridia organisms as primary pathogens in NEC. However, certain clostridia and clostridia toxins appear to be present in the normal flora of the neonatal gastrointestinal tract. 23 , 82 Therefore, their role as primary pathogens has been challenged. 23, 26, 56, 57, 82, 87, 91 Summary of Pathogeneses A unifying theory of necrotizing enterocolitis must explain the development of disease in the enterally fed, high-risk neonate and in the apparently healthy term infant or in the unfed infant. It seems likely that what we identifY as necrotizing enterocolitis represents one of a limited number of potential final reponses that the immature gastrointestinal tract may express after one or more unrelated stresses. It is appropriate to assume that because there are many stressful factors, there may also be a wide range of the severity of bowel injury and, therefore, a continuous spectrum of disease. Perhaps in benign forms of disease, the mucosa is exposed to a low inoculum of one injurious agent; whereas in the more severely affected infants, multiple stresses interact to synergistically produce more serious damage. Figure 8 is a diagram of the interaction of implicated agents. The relative contribution of each factor in any given case can only be speculative at the present time.",

Once NEC is documented, cross-table lateral abdominal radiographs should be taken every 6 hours during the acute period. Enteral feedings are discontinued, and the stomach is decompressed with a nasogastric tube.

Furthermore, enteral gentamicin may even increase serum gentamicin levels and therefore is not indicated. 39 Patients with Stage I, or suspected, NEC may benefit from bowel rest and antibiotic therapy for 72 hours pending culture reports and signs of clinical deterioration.

Edema of the intestine and, in some cases, peritonitis with ascites lead to tremendous third-space fluid losses. In neonatal animal models with septic shock, fluid volumes of 100 per cent of total blood volume were required to restore cardiac output.l! In our nursery, these critically ill infants have required as much as 200 to 300 mllkg/day above maintenance fluid requirements. Such large fluid infusions seem excessive but are often necessary to restore and maintain intravascular volume. End points in fluid resuscitation are normalization of heart rate, blood pressure, and urine output, and reversal of metabolic acidosis as adequate tissue perfusion is restored. Buntain et al. I8 have reported the use of transcutaneous oxygen (TcP02) measurements as an adjunct to fluid therapy.18 Adequate fluid resuscitation improves tissue perfusion, and because TcP02 measurement depends in part on tissue perfusion as the perfusion improves, the TcP0 2 should also improve. Buntain et al. found that a ratio of TcP0 2 /Pa0 2 equal to 0.7 correlates with survival. In their study, there were no survivors in the group receiving less than 150 ml/kg/24 hours. Fluids commonly used include saline, lactated Ringer's solution, and albumin. We prefer fresh frozen plasma and, if anemia is present, packed red blood cells. If anuria or oliguria is present, excessive fluid replacement may result in pulmonary edema; monitoring of central venous pressure and respiratory status may avoid this complication.",

In their series, 36 infants with NEC underwent paracentesis; brown peritoneal fluid or bacteria was noted in 26. All 26 infants had gangrenous bowel resected at exploratory laparotomy. Ten infants had a negative paracentesis; four were subsequently taken to the operating room and were found to have necrotic bowel.

Strictures, which are caused by formation of cicatricial scarring, become symptomatic 2 to 8 weeks after the acute illness. In addition, nonobstructing strictures are probably a common cause of gastrointestinal bleeding after NEC. Some of these patients have persistent melena and may require repeated blood transfusions. Post-NEC bleeding due to strictures may be due to a local, small area of active disease remaining at the base of the stricture. Strictures associated with post-NEC bleeding do not necessarily present with intestinal obstruction. Resection is not indicated for bleeding alone.

Preservation of the terminal ileum and the ileocecal valve also appears to be an important determinant of successful enteric alimentation and survival. The ileum contains the majority of active transport sites for nutrient absorption, especially of fat, vitamin B12 and bile saltS. 87 Furthermore, in both humans and experimental animals, the ileum has the greatest potential for adaptation.
