            "text": "Background: Total joint replacement (TJR) accounts for a substantial proportion of the total expenditures for health care. Efficient utilization of health resources requires information regarding the trends of TJR. This study investigated the association of TJR with the demographic characteristics in Taiwan from 1998 to 2009. It also estimated the demand for total knee replacement (TKR) and total hip replacement (THR) in the next two decades. Methods: International Classification of Diseases-9 (ICD-9) procedure codes were used to identify the data for primary and revision TKRs and THRs between the years 1998 and 2009 from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. Age-and sex-specific rates of such procedures were calculated. The trend in TJR rate and its future estimation were studied with regression analyses. Results: From 1998 to 2009, the number of primary TKRs increased by 99.1% and that of primary THRs increased by 11.3%. The number of revision TKRs increased by 3.1% and that of revision THRs decreased by 13.2%. Compared with their respective rates in 2005, the rates of primary TKR and primary THR were projected to increase by 508.2% and 69.7%, respectively, in 2030. The rate of revision TKR was predicted to increase by 75.3% and that of revision THR to decrease by 36.1%. Conclusion: This study gives an insight into the current status burden of TJR in Taiwan. TJR rate projection would be useful for future planning of budget and resources for TJR in Taiwan.",

            "text": "Total joint replacement (TJR) is one of the most clinically successful interventions for patients with debilitating hip and knee diseases. 1, 2 In recent decades, the procedural rates of total knee replacement (TKR) and total hip replacement (THR) have increased worldwide, 3 accounting for a large share of the total health care expenditure. 4 Information regarding trends in TJR is required for optimal utilization of health resources and creation of an effective health care policy. Moreover, a large amount of the resources are being used for the training of surgeons and planning for hospital capacity; this creates the need for a reliable study for the estimation of TJR in future. Studies in Nordic countries, 5 Australia, 6 and the USA 7 have reported trends in TJR using national registry data Conflicts of interest: The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest related to the subject matter or materials discussed in this article. or health insurance databases. However, only a few of them have predicted the number of TJRs to be performed in the future. 4, 8, 9 To our knowledge, no study of such prediction has been reported for Asian countries. Previous studies in Asian countries to understand the temporal trends of TJR did not estimate future TJR rates. 10e12 Moreover, such studies did not consider revision TJR, and in those studies the time frame of analysis was limited to 4e9 years. Therefore, a study to understand the current and future trends in primary as well as revision TJR with data from recent years and longer periods would add to the useful information of health care planning. In this study, we investigated the trends in procedure frequency from 1998 to 2009 and estimated the requirements in the next two decades for THR and TKR in Taiwan.",

A longitudinal analysis of such a database is useful for understanding the temporal patterns of TJR. Some of the previous studies of knee and hip replacement in Taiwan have used the NHI Research Database, 10, 14 and detailed information about the NHI program in Taiwan is described in the agency's literature. 13 In this study, BNHI data were used to calculate the procedural rates of primary and revision TJR for each year between 1998 and 2009. International Classification of Diseases-9 (ICD-9) procedure codes for THR (8.51, 8.53 ) and TKR (8.54, 8.55 ) were used to identify the procedures in the database. A 2.88-million-population database was decoded, representing 12.5% of the Taiwan population. All personal identification information of patients was deleted, and patients' personal information was protected while analyzing the data. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of China Medical University and Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.",

The rates were calculated by dividing the number of procedures by the corresponding resident population of Taiwan in that year. The primary and revision procedure rates were analyzed separately. Changes in the rates during the 12-year period (1998e2009) were evaluated. The frequency of the procedures was categorized by sex (male and female) and 10 age groups (<40 years, 40e44 years, 45e49 years, 50e54 years, 55e59 years, 60e64 years, 65e69 years, 70e74 years, 75e79 years, and 80 years). The number of THR and TKR procedures performed in a given year and for a particular ageesex group was assumed to follow a Poisson distribution, which is suitable for the distribution of such count data of TJR. A multivariate Poisson regression analysis with age, sex, calendar year, and their interactions as covariates was used to estimate the future procedure rate. For estimation of future rate, the future Taiwan population estimated by the Ministry of Interior was used. The estimation method used by the Ministry of Interior includes life expectancy and the current population growth rate. Moreover, a comparison of the rates in different age groups was performed using a univariate Poisson regression analysis, and temporal trend was examined using linear regression. The statistical analysis was performed with SAS statistical software (version 9.2 for Windows; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA).",

The smaller increase in the procedural rate shown in our study may suggest improved medical management of clinical conditions such as osteoarthritis. Similar studies in the USA, 4,9 Nordic countries, 5 Australia, 6 and South Korea 12 showed a higher rate of primary TKR than that in Taiwan, in the respective study periods in those studies. Such differences in the procedural rate of TJR from Western countries may be due to differences in the incidence of obesity, sociocultural beliefs about surgery, work and exercise habits, hereditary characteristics, and socioeconomic status between Taiwan and the Western populations. Taiwan's population has an obesity rate of 17e18%; in Western countries it is 24e34%, 17,18 which may be a significant factor for differences in TJR rates between Taiwan and the Western population. Moreover, Taiwan NHI criteria for coverage of sponsored arthroplasty may also add to the difference in procedural rate.",

Avascular necrosis of the femoral head is among the major causes of THR in Taiwan. 10 Similar to primary TKR, primary THR showed a lower rate compared with those in the USA, Nordic countries, and Australia, but higher than that in South Korea.

The estimation in their study was higher than those in ours (1.3 times for primary TKR, 2.5 times for THR, 8.0 times for revision TKR, and 4.8 times for revision THR). In 2014, in another study by Kurtz et al, 9 the increase in the primary THR rate was estimated to be higher than that in their earlier prediction. The lower estimated increase of rates in our study may be due to the same factors mentioned above as the reasons for lower primary TKR and THR, and also due to the difference in the statistical model used in our studies. However, in Taiwan, the projected rate of primary TKR is high, having a significant impact on health budgets and service provisions.",
