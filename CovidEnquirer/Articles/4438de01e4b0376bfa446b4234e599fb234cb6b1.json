In contrast to other proteases of the ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) family, USP18 shows no reactivity towards ubiquitin but specifically deconjugates the interferon induced Ubl ISG15. To identify molecular determinants for this specificity, we solved the crystal structures of mouse USP18 and of mouse USP18 in complex with mouse ISG15. USP18 was crystallized in an open and a closed conformation revealing high flexibility of the enzyme. Structural data, biochemical and mutational analysis showed that only the C-terminal ubiquitin-like domain of ISG15 is recognized and essential for USP18 activity. A critical hydrophobic patch in USP18 interacts with a hydrophobic region unique to ISG15 providing evidence that ISG15 specificity of USP18 is mediated by a small interaction interface. Our results may provide the structural basis for the development of new drugs modulating ISGylation.",

            "text": "ISGylation represents one of the major antiviral effector systems and is essential to counteract various pathogens including influenza-, herpes-, noro-, and coronavirus11, 12. ISGylation can occur at the ribosome in a co-translational manner, favoring the modification of viral proteins in infected cells13. Concordantly, ISGylated viral capsid proteins fail to assemble properly, thereby inhibiting the propagation of the virus13. However, also multiple cellular proteins14,15 including the ubiquitin E2 enzymes Ubc1316 and UbcH617 as well as the transcription factor IRF318,19 are modified by ISG15. Moreover, free ISG15 is released from cells and acts in a cytokine-like manner on NK cells to stimulate IFN-\u03b3 production20. Concordantly, humans with inherited ISG15 deficiency showed impaired IFN-\u03b3 responses and failed to effectively counteract mycobacterial infection21. Besides the function of ISG15 in immunity, ISGylation is involved in DNA repair22 and tumorigenesis23, 24. Analogous to other posttranslational control mechanisms, covalent linkage of Ub and Ubls to substrate proteins is a reversible process antagonized by deubiquitinating enzymes and Ubl-proteases (DUBs). Ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs) represent the largest subclass of DUBs25. Most of the more than 50 known USPs cleave ubiquitin chains with different types of linkage, and some like USP2, USP14 or USP21 were reported to recognize not only Ub but also ISG1526, 27 . In contrast to these cross-reactive isopeptidases, USP18 does not deconjugate ubiquitin from target substrates and represents the only ISG15-specific protease known so far28, 29 . Yet, there are reports that in a specific context USP18 is associated with ubiquitin protease activity30,31. USP18 cleaves ISG15 from target proteins with high catalytic activity28 and constitutes the major ISG15 isopeptidase in vivo. Accordingly, Knock-In mice selectively lacking USP18 enzymatic activity exhibit strongly enhanced and prolonged ISGylation32. Intriguingly, enhanced ISGylation in these mice mediated increased resistance against influenza and vaccinia virus infections and diminished myocarditis upon cocksackie virus B3 infection, thus qualifying USP18 protease inhibition as a potential antiviral strategy33,34. Irrespective of its enzymatic function, USP18 is a major negative regulator of type I IFN signaling by interacting with the interferon receptor (IFNAR) 35, 36 . Recent studies have shown that depletion of USP18 causes interferonopathies characterized by aberrant microglia activation35,37. Furthermore, ISG15 deficiency in humans correlated with destabilization of USP18, thereby enhancing the IFN response38.",

Whereas the palm and thumb domains of the two chains A and B align well, the orientation of the finger domain differs in both molecules. The finger domain of chain B exerts a closing movement towards the thumb domain, reorienting \u03b2-sheets 4 and 5 and the connecting loop by 10 \u00c5 (Fig. 1) . Furthermore, the loop located between residues 126 and 136 exhibits major differences. This loop corresponds to the previously described switching loop of USP7 and was shown to influence the catalytic activity41. Whereas in one USP18 molecule (chain B) this loop exhibits no secondary structure, the residues 131-135 of the second molecule (chain A) fold into a short \u03b1-helix. Minor differences were e.g. observed for a loop that comprises residues 307-314 and corresponds to the so called blocking loop 2 described in several USPs like USP1442, USP843, and USP744. With respect to the USP18 finger domain, the two conformations were assigned to an \"open\" and a \"closed\" state. The structure of the USP18-ISG15 complex described below, revealed that the closed state of USP18 is not compatible with ISG15 binding. Residues Cys61, His314 and Asn331 form the catalytic triad of USP18. The distances between these residues within the two molecules of unbound USP18 are very similar: the Cys61 S\u03b3 and the His314 N\u03b41 atom are separated by 4.0 \u00c5 -4.2 \u00c5 and the carbonyl group of the Asn331 side chain resides in a distance of 3.5 \u00c5 -3.7 \u00c5 from the N\u03b52 atom of His314 (Fig. 1c,d) (Supplementary Fig. 3a,b) . The observed distances suggest that the catalytic triad is not in catalytic configuration in unbound USP18. In summary, the conformations observed for both USP18 molecules in the asymmetric unit represent two different states that are both enzymatically inactive.",

Based on the structure of USP21 in complex with di-ubiquitin it had been suggested that USP18 binds ISG15 in a similar mode. In order to prove the observations from the structure described here, we tested the reactivity of USP18 towards the isolated C-terminal Ubl domain of ISG15 (ctodified with a propargylamide (PA) as an active site probe and compared it with full-length ISG15-PA. Both, full-length ISG15-PA and ct-ISG15-PA reacted readily with the active site cysteine of USP18 and formed a covalent complex. In contrast, no binding of USP18 to the respective Ub probe45 was observed (Fig. 2b) . Likewise, the kinetic analysis of USP18 reactivity towards a fluorescent ct-ISG15-FP substrate revealed highly efficient cleavage ( Table 2 , Supplementary Fig. 4a ). Moreover, USP18 cleaved ct-ISG15 as effectively as full-length ISG15 from cellular substrates (Fig. 2c) . Thus, our results demonstrate that only the Cterminal Ubl domain of ISG15 is essential and sufficient for USP18 binding and activity.",

The second area encompasses residues 256-263 located in the blocking loop 1 (Fig. 4a , Supplementary Note 1). We defined these areas as ISG15-binding box 1 and 2 (IBB-1 and IBB-2).",

The side chains of His149 and Trp121 in ISG15 are in close proximity forming a \u220f-\u220f contact that stabilizes the orientation of these residues and form a hydrophobic bulb. In USP18, residues His251, Ala138 and Leu142 are part of a hydrophobic pocket that perfectly accommodates the hydrophobic bulb of ISG15 (Fig. 4c ). This characteristic hydrophobic contact is further stabilized by the side chain of Pro128 of ISG15 and Leu142 of USP18 (Fig. 4c) . The corresponding regions of USP7 largely differ from USP18. In particular, the residues in USP7 corresponding to IBB-1 are more bulky and polar. Ser192, His251 and Ala138 of USP18 are all substituted by Gln residues in USP7. The hydrophobic Leu142 is replaced by an Arg. In particular, replacement of the Ala138 in USP18 by a polar residue in other USPs might block the access of the bulky and hydrophobic Trp121 side chain of ISG15 (Fig. 4d) . In contrast to IBB-1, IBB-2 located on blocking loop 1 mediates mainly hydrogen bond binding of ISG15 (Fig. 4e) . The corresponding blocking loop in USP7 is extended by two residues and adopts a conformation incompatible with ISG15 or ubiquitin binding. No hydrogen bonds are formed between USP7 and ubiquitin in this region (Fig. 4f ).",

In USP18 IBB-1-USP7 residues Ala138, Leu142, His251 and Ser192 of IBB-1 were replaced, in USP18 IBB-2-USP7 the blocking loop 1 of USP7 was inserted, and USP18 IBB-1-USP7-IBB-2-USP7 combined both modifications. Likewise, we generated an ISG15 variant that carries an Arg residue instead of Trp121 (ISG15-W121R), as well as a further variant where Trp121, Pro128 and His149 of ISG15 were changed to the corresponding residues of ubiquitin (ISG15-W121R-P128G-H149V). The interaction of murine USP18 and ISG15 as well as of several variants was analyzed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The binding curves and parameters are given in Supplementary Fig. 5 . ISG15 bound to immobilized USP18 with high affinity characterized by a fast association and dissociation phase. The K d of 1.49 \u00b1 0.03 \u03bcM is in good agreement with the K d of 1.3 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcM determined previously by microscale thermophoresis28. Changing the residues in IBB-1 to the corresponding residues of USP7 (variant USP18 IBB-1-USP7 ) or in IBB-2 (variant USP18 IBB-2-USP7 ) resulted in a clear decrease in affinity towards ISG15. A more drastic drop in affinity was observed for USP18 IBB-1-USP7-IBB-2-USP7 that combines both changes. In order to validate these results, we also analyzed variants of ISG15 with changes in the residues interacting with IBB-1 of USP18. The exchange of Trp121 in ISG15 to the corresponding Arg of Ub (variant ISG15-W121R) caused a clear drop in affinity and mutation of all three interacting residues Trp121, Pro128 and His149 (variant ISG15-W121R-P128G-H149V) almost abolished the interaction with USP18. Likewise, the observed binding ratio of ISG15 per immobilized USP18 dropped to 0.4 if Trp121 was mutated and no clear stoichiometry of binding could be obtained for the variant ISG15-W121R-P128G-H149V, indicating that the observed binding might be due to some residual unspecific interaction. The observations for the ISG15 variants corroborated the structural data showing that IBB-1 represents an important determinant for the interaction between USP18 and ISG15.",

Wildtype USP18 reacted readily with ISG15-PA and ct-ISG15-PA within one minute. In contrast, USP18 IBB-1-USP7 formed no adduct even after 5 minutes. The covalent adduct was observed only after prolonged incubation (Fig. 5a) . USP18 IBB-2-USP7 reacted almost as fast as wildtype but completion of the reaction was impaired as indicated by the presence of unreacted USP18. Strikingly, mutation of both IBBs in USP18 IBB-1-USP7-IBB-2-USP7 completely abolished covalent complex formation (Fig. 5a ). Of note, neither wildtype USP18 nor the USP18 variants reacted with Ub-PA even after prolonged incubation ( Supplementary Fig. 6a ). As shown by multiple sequence alignments IBB-1 and IBB-2 are well conserved among mammalians ( Supplementary Fig.  7 ). To evaluate whether human USP18 recognizes ISG15 like murine USP18, we built a 3D model of the human USP18-ISG15 complex based on the structure of the murine USP18-ISG15 complex. As expected, the interaction surfaces are complementary and the model puts forward that IBB-1 of human USP18 is crucial for reactivity (data not shown). To evaluate these observations, we expressed and purified human USP18 and generated a human ISG15-PA probe. Since the interaction surfaces in the USP18-ISG15 complex are well conserved between human and murine proteins, we tested whether the ISG15-PA active site probes label USP18 across species. As predicted by the model, human USP18 reacted readily with murine ISG15-PA and vice versa ( Supplementary Fig. 6b ).",

            "text": "Multiple sequence alignments of USP18 show that the hydrophobic character of IBB-1 is highly conserved among mammals and marsupialia ( Supplementary Fig. 7) . Likewise, the corresponding counterpart in ISG15, which carries the bulky tryptophan protruding from the surface, is also highly conserved ( Supplementary Fig. 8) . Thus, the hydrophobic interaction described here appears to be strictly conserved among different species. In particular, IBB-1 of USP18 and the hydrophobic patch of ISG15 represent one of the most conserved regions of these proteins. A similar degree of conservation is only observed for the catalytic cleft of USP18 and the C-terminal tail of ISG15 (Supplementary Fig. 7b and 8b ). In contrast, instead of the two hydrophobic residues Ala138 and Leu142 (numbering Mus musculus), fish USP18 carries an Asp and a His residue at the respective positions ( Supplementary Fig. 7a ). Most interestingly, in fish ISG15 these variations are compensated by an exchange of the hydrophobic Trp121 and Pro128 (numbering M. musculus) to the polar residues Arg and Gln, respectively ( Supplementary Fig. 8a ). A molecular model of a USP18-ISG15 complex carrying these mutations suggested that the side chains of these polar residues can form several hydrogen bonds. This type of interaction is reminiscent of the respective interaction between other USPs and ubiquitin. Thus, we speculated that fish USP18 might not be restricted to ISG15 but also capable to recognize ubiquitin. To test this hypothesis we expressed USP18 from Danio rerio in HEK 293T cells and analyzed the cell lysates for reactivity with ISG15-and Ub-reactive probes (Fig. 6a) . USP18 from D. rerio reacted readily with murine ISG15-PA (Fig. 6b ). Most interestingly, USP18 from D. rerio reacted not only with ISG15-PA, but also with mammalian Ub-PA, whereas murine USP18 showed no cross-reactivity with Ub (Fig. 6c) 28. Although the portion of covalent modification of USP18 from D. rerio with Ub appeared to be less than with ISG15, it is clearly visible and not seen when the active site cysteine is mutated to alanine (Fig. 6c) . These data further support that the IBB-1 region is critical for ISG15 specificity.",

            "text": "Most members of the USP family of deubiquitinating enzymes cleave different kinds of ubiquitin chains from substrates. In addition, some USPs show cross-reactivity towards ISG1526. To ensure specific functions of the different USPs, most enzymes of the USP family comprise further large domains mediating interaction with other protein complexes48, specific organelles49, or show temporal distribution50. In contrast, USP18 represents a remarkably small member, which comprises only the USP core domain. Nevertheless, USP18 is specific for ISG15 and not cross-reactive towards ubiquitin or any other member of the Ubl family28,29. Thus, the unique specificity must arise entirely from the USP core domain itself. Models based on structures of the isopeptidases USP2127 and the viral SARS CoV PLpro53 which both cleave ISG15 and ubiquitin suggested that also USP18 might recognize both Ubl domains of ISG15. In the USP21-diubiquitin complex the N-terminal Ub-domain is in contact with the finger domain. In the SARS CoV PLpro binding of the N-terminal Ubl domain to the thumb domain was observed. However, so far no structure of a complex of full-length ISG15 with an ISG15 protease was available. Our analysis demonstrates that only the C-terminal ubiquitin-like domain of ISG15 is sufficient for USP18 binding and activity. Moreover, we identified the structural determinants essential for the extraordinary substrate specificity of USP18. We have mapped two regions, namely IBB-1 and IBB-2, which are unique for USP18 and recognize regions of in the C-terminal Ubl domain of ISG15, which are not present in ubiquitin. Analysis of site-specific variants showed that IBB-1 represents the major determinant for ISG15 cleavage whereas IBB-2 has only minor contributions. This is also reflected in the conservation of IBB-1 across different species. While there is strict conservation of the residues in IBB-1 in mammals, fish USP18 shows no conservation within IBB-1. Our results suggest that fish USP18 constitutes a DUB cross-reactive to ubiquitin and ISG15. Furthermore, the IBB-1 region in fish USP18 has characteristics of ubiquitin-specific DUBs and lacks the two hydrophobic amino acids characteristic for IBB-1 of USP18.",

In contrast, in a recent study it was concluded that the mode of USP18-ISG15 interaction might differ between murine and human proteins51. Our results further show that neither murine nor human USP18 is able to catalyze de-ubiquitination in vitro and we provide a molecular rational for the remarkable specificity of USP18. Yet, two recent studies provide evidence that USP18 is involved in de-ubiquitination of the TAK1-TAB1 complex30 or NEMO31 thereby inhibiting activation of NF-\u03baB. The authors provide evidence that USP18 influences the ubiquitination status of NEMO independent of its protease activity31. In contrast, they suggest that USP18 inhibits ubiquitination of the TAK1/TAB1 complex in a protease dependent manner30,31. Our results clearly show that USP18 exhibits no reactivity towards ubiquitin in vitro indicating/demonstrating that the described inhibition of the NF-\u03baB pathway by USP18 is rather an indirect effect and not mediated by direct interaction between USP18 and ubiquitin.",

This property is clearly independent of the catalytic activity as IFN signaling in mice selectively lacking the active site cysteine is unaffected32. Based on mutational studies it was suggested that USP18 binds to the intracellular region of type I IFN receptor subunit IFNAR2 and outcompetes the downstream kinase JAK1 thereby abrogating IFN signaling36. The binding of primary signaling molecules to their cognate receptors in IFN signaling (JAK1 to IFNAR2 and Tyk2 to IFNAR1) is suggested to be highly conserved54. In IFNAR2 the interaction region consists of two motifs termed Box1 and Box2, with Box1 described to be critical for USP18 binding36. The hydrophobic nature of Box1 and of the USP18-ISG15 interaction plane suggests that a similar mode of interaction might occur between USP18 and IFNAR2.",
