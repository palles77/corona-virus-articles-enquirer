The proliferation rates of the cell lines with silenced CyP40 were decreased compared to the control cells. After UVA irradiation, the rate of apoptosis was found to be significantly lower in CyP40 silenced cell lines than it was in control cells. Moreover, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was found to be less dissipated and mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) less active in cells with knocked down CyP40 than in control cells after UVA irradiation. Also, less mitochondrial superoxide was detected in the cells with silenced CyP40 compared to control cells after UVA exposure. Moreover, silencing of CyP40 partially modulates expression of key genes involved in mitochondrial pore formation including CyPD, ANTs and VDAC family members. The ability of CyP40 to regulate UV induced apoptosis implicates this protein as a potential target for therapy in cancer cells.",

The MPTP is a high conductance channel of the inner mitochondrial membrane whose opening allows flux of molecules of r1.5 kDa [3] . The other regulatory and structural components of the MPTP are thought to include voltage-dependent-anion-channel (VDAC) family members, non-specific pore proteins located in the outer mitochondrial membrane and the adenine-nucleotidetranslocators (ANTs), specific ATP/ADP transporters, located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. CyPD is known to be associated with ANT in the matrix of mitochondria. The MPTP starts its formation in response to conditions of cellular stress including mitochondrial calcium overload, oxidative stress, elevated phosphate concentration and adenine depletion and the consequence of this process for the cell is MPTP fluxing [4, 5] . The opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore causes a collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential, leading to ATP depletion and cell death, depending on the rate of ATP consumption. MPTP opening can trigger different types of cell death. Transient opening results in the release of cytochrome c, which activates the caspase cascade and triggers apoptosis. Sustained pore opening results in the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation what limits ATP synthesis and leads to necrotic cell death.",

Periyasamy et al. [13] have previously showed that levels of FKBP52, FKBP51 and CyP40 are high in prostate cancer cells lines (LNCaP, PC-3, and DU145) compared to primary prostate cells and provided the first evidence that CsA and FK506 can negatively modulate proliferation of prostate cells in vitro. Ward et al. [14] reported that Cyp40 mRNA was over-expressed in breast cancer tissues as compared with matched normal breast control tissues, and Cyp40 mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in 10 breast cancer cell lines. The breast cancer cell line MCF-7 showed a 75-fold increase of Cyp40 mRNA expression in response to high temperature stress and marked redistribution of Cyp40 protein from a predominantly nuclear location to nuclear accumulation [15] . In addition to Cyp40 up-regulation, Ward et al. [16] also reported that genetic analysis of breast cancer patients heterozygous for Cyp40 showed 30% Cyp40 allelic loss. This indicates that dysregulation of CyP40 either as up-regulation of CyP40 gene expression or as loss of function could have pro-tumorigenic effects.",

            "text": "One of the most studied phenomena related to cyclophilins is their interaction with immunosuppressant drugs. The ability of CyP40 to bind the immunosuppressive drugs FK506 and CsA has served to categorize this protein as immunophilin. Binding of CsA to immunophilins causes inhibition of the protein's PPIase activity. The inhibition of PPIase activity is thought to ultimately contribute to the protection of cells from undergoing apoptosis [17] . CsA interacts with many cyclophilin proteins including 17 kDa CyPD located in the mitochondrial matrix leading to inhibition of MPTP formation [18] and inhibition of cell death pathways mediated by this pore [19] . This interaction was shown to be an effective therapeutic tool in limiting acute myocardial infarction and in correcting mitochondrial dysfunction in myopathies [20] . CsA also interacts with cytoplasmic 40 kDa CyPD (CyP40), although its affinity for this receptor is lower than the mitochondrial 17 kDa CyPD. The weak affinity of CyP40 for CsA was postulated to arise from a histidine (His) residue that replaces a tryptophan (Trp) residue critical for CsA binding which is highly conserved in other cyclophilins that have high affinity for CsA. Site-directed mutagenesis to replace His141 by Trp yielded a protein with an approximately 20-fold greater affinity for cyclosporin A. Thus replacing the His141 (in CyP40) by Trp (in CyPD) is likely to be critical for determining binding affinity to CsA [21] .",

We used two fluorescent dyes, JC-1 and TMRE which are specific indicators of MMP, to evaluate if there are significant changes in the status of MMP between the PPI-6 and PPID-7 cells transfected with CyP40 and control cells exposed to UVA-irradiation. JC-1 accumulates in mitochondria where it forms aggregates in cells with high MMP and emits a red fluorescence. When MMP collapses there is a shift in JC-1 fluorescence from red to green. Non-irradiated control cells showed high MMP with red JC-1 staining and treatment with CCCP, a mitochondrial uncoupler, caused a complete shift from red to green fluorescence. Tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) is a cell permeable, positively-charged, red-orange dye that readily accumulates in active mitochondria due to their relative negative charge. Depolarized or inactive mitochondria have decreased membrane potential and fail to sequester TMRE. FCCP (a mitochondrial uncoupler) depolarizes mitochondrial membrane completely and thus serves as a positive control. There was no significant difference in mitochondrial membrane potential status between all three nonirradiated cell lines. However, in UVA exposed cell lines, the measurements indicated that control cells show more sensitive response to UVA irradiation by manifesting low red/green ratio and low TMRE fluorescence. In PPID-6 and PPID-7 cell lines the red/ green ratio and TMRE fluorescence is higher, indicating less sensitivity to UVA exposure (Fig. 4A-D) .

Once inside cells, intracellular esterases cleave the acetoxymethyl esters to liberate the very polar fluorescent dye calcein, which does not cross the mitochondrial or plasma membranes. In order to assess MPTP activity, we measured calcein fluorescence accumulated in the mitochondria by quenching cytosolic calcein with cobalt chloride (CoCl 2 ). Flow cytometry analysis revealed that UVA-irradiated PPID-6 and PPID-7 cell lines had less loss of calcein fluorescence than it was observed in control cells (Fig. 5) indicating greater calcein AM retention in mitochondria (from a less active MPTP).

A small but significant difference was observed after 24 h of incubation starting with the same number of cells for all three cell lines. This difference between control cells and cells with silenced CyP40 was even more significant after 48 h and 72 h. These results correspond with observation of Periyasamy et al. [27] who reported significantly slower growth of androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells after transient transfection using siRNA against cytosolic CyP40. Cellular apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry and revealed that the viability of PPID-6 and PPID-7 cells was always slightly lower than was in the control cells. Although the apoptosis was not increased profoundly in CyP40 silenced cells (only by 5%), this difference was statistically significant and always present. Our data indicate that CyP40 is an important component in the apoptotic processes since once it is stably knocked down in cells then the apoptotic rate is higher. On the other hand, this difference does not explain observed decrease in cellular growth of CyP40 knocked down cells; proliferation rate in CyP40 knocked down cells is about 50% lower compared to control cells while apoptosis is increased by only 5%. Hence, the compromised cell growth is not predominantly caused by increased apoptosis in these cells but is an effect of silenced CyP40 on cellular growth through affecting cell cycle.",

Under standard laboratory conditions (without UVA exposure), PPID-6 and PPID-7 cells had slightly lower survival rates compared to control cells. Importantly, the UVA irradiation caused the opposite effect, showing that control cells responded with significantly higher apoptotic rate compared to the cells with CyP40 knocked down expression. Although UVA also triggered apoptosis in PPID-6 and PPID-7 cell lines, the response to UVA irradiation was notably diminished since the number of viable cells was significantly higher than in control cells and apoptosis was not observed close to the level of control cells. These findings are similar to those of Favreau et al. [28] who studied the effect of CyP40 silencing in human neuronal cell lines. Specifically, using the same viral constructs as used in our study they were able to protect CyP40 knock down cells against apoptosis after exposing the neural cells to human coronavirus. Although they incorrectly identified the 40 kDa CyP40 as the 17 kDa mitochondrial CyPD, the overall data did show that CyP40 silencing resulted in significant protection from cell death after inducing apoptosis by viral mechanism.",

Both experiments revealed that mitochondrial response to UVA irradiation is lower in CyP40 knocked cells than in control cells by showing significantly more stable MMP and less active MPTP what correlates with lower apoptosis in these cells. We also examined the ROS levels with and without UVA irradiation stimuli by focusing on mitochondrial superoxide. PPID-6 and PPID-7 cell lines were found to have significantly lower amount of superoxide after UVA irradiation but slightly higher level without UVA stimuli what correlates with the results obtained from the apoptotic assays. Furthermore, we conducted a mechanistic study focused on mitochondrial pore genes. It was already suggested in literature that suppression of mitochondrial pore proteins could be one of the possible cancer therapy treatments (VDAC [29, 30] , ANTs [31, 32] and CyPD [33] ). Here, we have demonstrated that silencing of cytosolic CyP40 is partially altering (down-regulating) the expression of genes coding the most important mitochondrial pore proteins including VDAC1, ANT2, ANT3 and CyPD/PPIF.",

Moreover, they pointed out the interactions between CyP40 and Bax protein as one of the major components promoting mitochondrial apoptosis. In addition to the Bax interaction, Favreau et al. [28] showed that inhibition of cytosolic CyP40 alters release of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and cytochrome c from mitochondria. Bax protein seems to be one of the major partners of CyP40 since its translocation toward mitochondria after an induced stress of either chemical, physical or biological origin leads to series of mitochondrial responses such as accumulation of ROS, increasing Ca 2\u00fe levels, and formation of pores in the mitochondrial membrane which allows for the release of pro-apoptotic factors such as cytochrome c and AIF [35] . Generally, these studies as well as our observations indicate that it is not solely mitochondrial 17 kDa CyPD that is regulating apoptosis at the mitochondrial level, but also the cytosolic CyP40 appears to be a factor which can partially regulate important mitochondrial functions including pore formation.",

Thus, our data show that diminished levels of CyP40 expression are associated with increased resistance to UVA-induced apoptosis. A more intensive investigation focused on cytosolic CyP40 interactions with other mitochondrial proteins and other pro-apoptotic components like Bax protein and contrarily anti-apoptotic agents like antioxidants is in order to elucidate if these pathways may be involved in the enhanced tumorigenesis seen in the skin of organ transplant recipients who take CsA to prevent grafted organ rejection.",

As a corollary, therapeutic strategies to increase CyP40 levels in cutaneous malignancies may allow for UVA to be used as a paired therapeutic modality to treat skin cancers with depths that are penetrable by irradiation with UVA. Anti-rejection drugs that maintain sensitivity of keratinocytes to UV-induced apoptosis without binding of the CyP40 immunophilin may also help reduce the burden and severity of skin cancers faced in the organ transplant recipient population.",
