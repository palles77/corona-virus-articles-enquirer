The United Nations now estimates that world population will be between 3.6 and 27 billion by 2150, and the difference between the two projections is only one child per woman (National Geographic, 1998b) . If fertility rates continue to drop until women have about two children each-the medium-range projection-the population will stabilize at 10.8 billion. If the average becomes 2.6 children, the population will more than quadruple to 27 billion; if it falls to 1.6, the total will drop to 3.6 billion.",

Current potential plagues may result from AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome), generally thought to be caused by a virus; influenza, another viral infection-for example, there may be a recurrence of the 1918 pandemic (Gladwell, 1997) ; sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a deadly infectious disease caused by a coronavirus (Lemonick and Park, 2003) ; and mad-cow disease, which is formally called bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). BSE is called Creutzfeldt-Jakob (also spelled as Creutzfeldt-Jacob) disease (CJD), when it occurs in humans (Hueston and Voss, 2000) . It is thought to be caused by prions, which were discovered by Stanley Prusiner (1942-) of the University of California School of Medicine in San Francisco; the discovery won Prusiner both the Wolf Prize (1996) and the Nobel Prize (1997) in medicine. Prions are a new class of protein, which, in an altered state, can be pathogenic and cause important neurodegenerative disease by inducing changes in protein structure. Prions are designed to protect the brain from the oxidizing properties of chemicals activated by dangerous agents such as ultraviolet light.",

The brightness of the sun varies during the 11-year solar cycle, but typically by less than 0.1% (Lockwood et al., 1992) . 3. 16,700 cm 2 \u00d7 2.00 cal cm \u22122 min \u22121 = 33,400 cal min \u22121 . 4. 33,400 cal min \u22121 \u00d7 60 min h \u22121 \u00d7 12 h d \u22121 = 24,048,000 cal d \u22121 , or, rounding, 24,000,000 cal d \u22121 . We multiply by 12 h d \u22121 , because we assume that the sun shines 12 hours a day. Of course, the length the sun shines each day depends on the day of the year, cloudiness, and location. 5. There is 6% conversion of absorbed solar energy into chemical energy in plants (Kok, 1967) . This 6% is for the best crop yields achieved; 20% (Kok, 1967) to 30% (Kok, 1976) conversion is thought possible, but it has not been achieved; 2% is the conversion for normal yields; under natural conditions, \u22641% is converted (Kok, 1976) . The solar energy reaching the earth's surface that plants do not capture to support life is wasted as heat (Kok, 1976 We recognize that the above calculation of productivity from two square yards is simplified, and more complex and thorough calculations of productivity, which consider geographic location, sky conditions, leaf display, and other factors, have been carried out (e.g., de Wit, 1967) . Nevertheless, the 1,440 kcal d \u22121 is a useful number to know. It would be a starvation diet. One could live on it, but the calories probably would not provide enough for active physical work, creative intellectual activity, and reproduction. Women below a minimum weight cannot reproduce (Frisch, 1988) . Civilization would advance slowly with this daily ration. People begin to die of starvation when they lose roughly a third of their normal body weight. When the loss reaches 40%, death is almost inevitable. Triage is a system developed in World War I. It is the medical practice of dividing the wounded into survival categories to concentrate medical resources on those who could truly benefit from them and to ignore those who would die, even with treatment, or survive even without it. This practice has been advocated to allocate scarce food supplies. Wealthy countries should help only the most promising of the poorer countries since spreading precious resources too thin could jeopardize chances for survival of the strong as well as the weak. If we can grow more food, then this system does not need to be put into effect. In this book, we seek a better understanding of movement of water through the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum, or SPAC (Philip, 1966) , because of the prime importance of water in plant growth.",

Plant growth curves also exemplify quantitative relationships that we seek to understand basic principles of plant-water relations. If we can develop equations to show relationships, then we can predict what is going to happen. Equations describing plant-growth curves demonstrate how we can quantify, and thus predict, plant growth. We first consider the growth of the bacterium Escherichia coli. In the early nineteenth century, when plants and animals were being classified, the bacteria were arbitrarily included in the plant kingdom, and botanists first studied them (Stanier et al., 1963, p. 55-56) .

In later growth stages, the decreasing relative growth rate has appeared to make impossible the application of this theory to the entire growth curve. Blackman attempted to do this, nevertheless, by using the average of all the different relative growth rate values as the r term in Equation 1.8. He called this term the \"efficiency index\" of plant growth. Hammond and Kirkham found that the growth curves (dry weight versus time) of soybeans [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] and corn (Zea mays L.) were characterized by a series of exponential segments, which were related to the growth stages of the plants. The exponential equation for all segments had the form: We get y = a + bx, which is the equation of a straight line. The differential form of Equation 1.9, w = w o e r(t\u2212to) , is dw/(wdt) = r (1.10)",

Hammond and Kirkham (1949) plotted the common logarithm of dry weight versus time and found that soybeans have three growth stages, I, II, and III. The analysis showed that the plants produce dry matter at the greatest relative rate during period I; at a smaller rate during period II; and at a still smaller rate during period III. That is, the slopes declined with age (slope = r/2.303). They saw that the dates of change in the growth curves from period I to period II were also the dates when the plants began to bloom. The dates of the second change in the growth curve, or the change from period II to period III, were the dates when the plants reached maximum height. The soybeans grew on two different soils, a Clarion loam and a Webster silt loam. The soybean plants in the Clarion soil bloomed and reached maximum height about a week earlier than the soybeans on the Webster silt loam soil. The growth curves clearly showed this difference ( Fig. 1.3) . Growth curves, therefore, can be used to see the effect of the soil environment on plant growth. Hammond and Kirkham (1949) did not give a reason for the difference in rate of growth on the Webster and Clarion soils, but it must have been related to one of the four soil physical factors that affect plant growth: water, temperature, aeration, or mechanical impedance. For corn, they found four periods of growth ( Fig. 1.4) . The additional period in corn apparently was related to the difference in time of appearance of male and female flowers in corn. The physiological changes associated with the breaks in the curves were associated with tasseling, silking, and cessation of vegetative growth. The last break occurred after the corn plants had reached maximum height. In sum, the data for soybeans and corn showed that a quantitative analysis of the complete growth curve can be accomplished if the overall growth is partitioned into segments based on the growth stages of the plants.",

The son of Scottish nobility, Napier's life was spent (1594), has a prominent place in Scottish ecclesiastical history as the earliest Scottish work on the interpretation of the scriptures. He then occupied himself by inventing instruments of war, including two kinds of burning mirrors, a piece of artillery, and a metal chariot from which shot could be discharged through small holes. Napier devoted most of his leisure to the study of mathematics, particularly to developing methods of facilitating computation. His name is associated with his greatest method, logarithms. His contributions to this mathematical invention are contained in two treatises: Mirifici logarithmorum canonis descriptio (1614; translated into English in 1857) and Mirifici logarithmorum canonis constructio, which was published two years after his death (1619) and translated into English in 1889. Although Napier's invention of logarithms overshadows all his other mathematical work, he has other mathematical contributions to his credit. In 1617, he published his Rabdologiae, seu numerationis per virgulas libri duo (English translation, 1667) . In this work, he describes ingenious methods of performing the fundamental operations of multiplication ",
