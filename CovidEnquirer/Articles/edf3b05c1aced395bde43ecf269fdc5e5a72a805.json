Common bacterial urinary pathogens in RTRs include the Enterobacteriaceae flora of the recipient (Escherichia coli, Proteus spp., Klebsiella spp.). Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other nosocomial pathogens such as Enterococcus species are also common. 1, 18, 19 Controversy remains in the literature regarding whether UTIs result in increased risk for allograft dysfunction or rejection. 19 Asymptomatic bacteruria is common, and persistent bacteruria has been associated with allograft infection and acute rejection in some, but not all, studies. 1, 3, 19 However, demonstrable reduction in symptomatic UTIs via treatment of asymptomatic bacteruria is lacking in the literature. 4, 19 Because of the controversies remaining in the literature, consensus on treatment of asymptomatic bacteruria has not been reached, but some transplant programs use this practice. 3 Patients receiving TMP-SMZ for Pneumocystic jiroveci prophylaxis may have lower risk of asymptomatic bacteruria and UTI. 17 the maintenance immunosuppression is weaned over time (however, rarely is stopped unless allograft fails and is removed). If the course is complicated by rejection, patients often require augmented immunosuppression. Prolonged and intensive immunosuppression increases risk for opportunistic infections and in an effort to reduce risk of the most common infections, antimicrobial prophylaxis often is used. 12",

Recipients who have positive antibodies (IgG) for CMV before transplant (CMV D-/R+ or CMV D+/R+) are considered to be intermediate-risk recipients for CMV infection. 25 Cases in which donor and recipient are seronegative (D\u2212/R\u2212) are at lowest risk for CMV infection, and it is important that they receive CMV-negative or leukocyte-depleted blood products to avoid iatrogenic transmission. 25 Patients who are at high or intermediate risk for CMV infection and receive induction therapy or treatment of acute rejection with antilymphocyte agents are at increased risk for CMV infection during the subsequent 3 to 6 months. In an effort to reduce CMV infection and disease as well as its indirect effects, several prevention strategies have been implemented. One option is to provide antiviral prophylaxis (intravenous ganciclovir or oral valganciclovir) to at-risk individuals during high-risk periods.

Commonly involved superficial sites are the oral cavity, esophagus, and bladder. Oral candidiasis manifests as single or multiple, white, raised, plaque-like lesions over the palate and oropharyngeal mucous membranes and often can be treated with topical agents. Oral candidiasis can progress distally and can lead to esophageal involvement with symptoms ranging from asymptomatic to odynophagia/dysphagia.

            "text": "Important community-acquired respiratory virus infections in immunocompromised hosts include influenza virus types A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIV), coronavirus, rhinovirus, and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). These viruses are transmitted by direct contact and respiratory droplets from infected individuals and typically follow a seasonal pattern. The clinical presentation made include upper respiratory tract infection, tracheobronchitis, influenza-like illness, bronchiolitis, or pneumonia. In the immunocompromised host, viral shedding may persist for months. It can be difficult to distinguish between these infections based on clinical presentation, and therefore to make a definitive diagnosis, multiplex PCR assays for respiratory specimens now are being used. Viral antigen testing for influenza and RSV also can be performed, but sensitivity is lower. Influenza is typically the most severe of the aforementioned viral infections, and treatment with a neuraminidase inhibitor such as oseltamivir or zanamivir usually is indicated, because it may shorten the duration of symptoms and prevent progression to more severe illness. Newer agents, such as intravenous peramivir, are not used routinely in critically ill or immunocompromised patients. Treatment recommendations should be reviewed yearly for updates in recommendations and management. Seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended. The treatment for the rest of the aforementioned viral infections is usually supportive in the renal transplant population. Antiviral therapy with ribavirin has been used to treat RSV, hMPV, and PIV in the lung transplant or HSCT population, but it is reserved for severe infections and should be administered under the direction of an infectious diseases specialist. 38",

            "text": "Pretransplant management of viral hepatitis is imperative, because these infections affect morbidity and mortality in the transplant setting. Hepatitis C is of particular concern because it further blunts the immune system if not treated before transplant. Further, HCV infection and secondary cryoglobulinemia may affect negatively graft function posttransplant. 1,3 HBV and HCV can reactivate with immunosuppression. For those who receive infected donor organs, development of active infection is variable in presentation but can be very rapid in clinical progression. Further, in the setting of immunosuppression, antibodies may not form for seroconversion, thus nucleic acid testing should be used to assess for infection. 3, 6 Fungal Infections Among all solid organ transplant recipients, RTRs have the lowest rates of invasive fungal infection (IFI), accounting transplantation and carries an approximately 30% to 50% mortality rate for RTRs. 3 Infection with this pathogen has decreased among this population because of the universal use of chemoprophylaxis among transplant centers for the first several months posttransplant with TMP-SMX as the preferred agent. 3 Alternative options include atovaquone, dapsone, and inhaled pentamidine, but these agents are less effective and breakthrough infections can occur. Symptoms of PJP include fever, dyspnea, and nonproductive cough with hypoxia that is more severe than expected. Imaging with radiograph or computed tomography (CT) scan often reveals the presence of interstitial infiltrates, often characterized as \"ground glass\" in appearance. Diagnosis is dependent on identifying the organism via respiratory secretions (sputum, BAL, or tissue specimen) and usually is made via appropriate staining (Silver or Giemsa) or molecular techniques (PCR). Therapy consists of 14 to 21 days of high-dose intravenous TMP-SMX (dosage adjusted according to kidney function) or, in case of sulfa hypersensitivity, intravenous pentamidine, atovaquone, clindamycin, and pyrimethamine or TMP plus dapsone (G6PD deficiency must be tested before administration of this medication). In addition, corticosteroids should be considered for those with significant hypoxia (partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli of <70 mm Hg on room air). 3 Further, P. jiroveci pneumonia, like most other severe infections, requires reduction of immunosuppression.",

Infections occur in a generally predictable pattern after solid-organ transplantation. The development of infection is delayed by prophylaxis and accelerated by intensified immunosuppression, drug toxic effects that may cause leukopenia, or immunomodulatory viral infections such as infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). At the time of transplantation, a patient's short-term and long-term risk of infection can be stratified according to donor and recipient screening, the technical outcome of surgery, and the intensity of immunosuppression required to prevent graft rejection. Subsequently, an ongoing assessment of the risk of infection is used to adjust prophylaxis and immunosuppressive therapy.

However, clinicians must recognize the importance of continuing antiretroviral therapy, monitoring for drug interactions, and changing regimens only with the assistance of a multidisciplinary team, including the transplant team, HIV specialist, and pharmacy. 3 Furthermore, there are increased risks of certain infections and malignancies in the setting of immunologic impairment from HIV and immunosuppressants, and these will have to be factored into differential diagnoses and management.",
