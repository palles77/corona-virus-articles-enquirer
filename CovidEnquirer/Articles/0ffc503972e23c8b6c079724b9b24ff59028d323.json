The transition: from communicable disease burden to noncommunicable diseases A total of 56.4 million human beings died in 2015, of which 54% were due to the top 10 causes enlisted in Table 1 [1] . Although infectious diseases were the most significant contributor to morbidity and mortality, the world over, in the pre-antibiotic era; the antibiotic era witnessed a steep reduction in the infectious disease burden. But the control of infectious diseases was notably greater in the developed countries vis-\u00e0-vis the developing countries. The developing countries are geographically located in the tropics, where the high temperatures, humid weather, clubbed with the poor sanitation and socio-economic status, lack of adequate medical facilities, provides an ideal breeding ground for the infectious diseases to flourish. Despite the development of antibiotics, the fight between microbes and mankind continued throughout the 20th century into the 21st century, with outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics of infectious diseases occurring even outside the tropics. However, of late, an important aspect that is very disturbing is the emergence of antimicrobial resistance, which is a major concern worldwide, because it threataens to tilt the balance in favour of the microbes bringing to naught the medical achievements which have been hitherto achieved in the control of infectious diseases and in improving the quality as well as the longevity of life.",

Infections no longer rank as the foremost cause of mortality in India. Diarrhoeal diseases, lower respiratory infections and tuberculosis are the top most infections contributing to death in India. In fact, on the infectious disease front, India reduced polio from 1934 cases in 1998 to 1 case in 2011, and is presently polio-free. However, Acute Diarrhoeal Disorders, Acute Febrile illnesses and acute respiratory infections still rank among the common syndromes of public health importance. Acute encephalitis syndromes (including Japanese encephalitis), Viral haemorrhagic fevers (including Dengue fever), influenza and malaria are important illnesses apart from HIV and tuberculosis. Health care associated infections are also a matter of grave concern, and need to be curtailed.",

In the last two decades, newly detected microbes of public health importance, first identified in Asia, include Nipah virus (1999), SARS corona virus (2002) caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Influenza A-H5N1 caused Avian influenza (2003), Influenza A (H1N1) caused Swine flu (2009) and a novel coronavirus in 2012 caused severe respiratory infection. This issue carries two articles, one on clinical profile of respiratory viral infections in a set-up from South India which suggests that rhinoviruses, influenza viruses and respiratory syncytial viruses were the common agents [4] while the other article describes the influenza A (H1N1) virus outbreak of 2015 in Rajasthan, India [5] .
