            "text": "Background: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a major infectious disease which has affected the Middle Eastern countries, especially the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) since 2012. The high mortality rate associated with this disease has been a major cause of concern. This paper aims at identifying the major factors influencing MERS recovery in KSA. Methods: The data used for analysis was collected from the Ministry of Health website, KSA. The important factors impelling the recovery are found using machine learning. Machine learning models such as support vector machine, conditional inference tree, na\u00efve Bayes and J48 are modelled to identify the important factors. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis is also carried out to identify the significant factors statistically. Result: The main factors influencing MERS recovery rate are identified as age, pre-existing diseases, severity of disease and whether the patient is a healthcare worker or not. In spite of MERS being a zoonotic disease, contact with camels is not a major factor influencing recovery. Conclusion: The methods used were able to determine the prime factors influencing MERS recovery. It can be comprehended that awareness about symptoms and seeking medical intervention at the onset of development of symptoms will make a long way in reducing the mortality rate.",

            "text": "The devastating marks left by infectious diseases on human race are much similar to that caused by famine and war [1] . Majority of the infectious diseases are caused by viruses, bacteria or fungi. Coronaviruses are a family of viruses responsible for causing diseases ranging from mild infection to death causing diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Since the advent of the 21 st century, there has been a surge in the discovery of new coronaviruses such as SARS Co-V, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1 etc. [2] . The detailed medical analysis on the death of a 60-year-old man in Saudi Arabia led to the discovery of a novel coronavirus [2] , which was later coined as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus (MERS Co-V). The incubation period associated with the viral infection ranges from 2 to 14 days. The mortality rate associated with MERS Co-V is over 30% [3] . MERS Co-V is a zoonotic virus wherein human beings may get infected due to direct or indirect contact with infected animals [4] . Camels have been identified as a carrier [5] . It is believed that the MERS-CoV is transmitted to humans from camels through respiratory droplet, saliva, or consuming undercooked camel meat or milk. Using viral genome sequencing, the zoonotic nature of the virus was confirmed [6] . MERS Co-V RNA was detected in nasal swab of infected camels, and their antibodies were found in 70% of the positively tested camels [7] . Contact with infected people in healthcare facilities, houses and communities have also contributed to the spread of the disease [8] [9] [10] [11] . Healthcare facilities are the major source of nosocomial outbreak of the disease [12] . Studies conducted have reported that there is no pandemic risk associated with the disease acquired through contact with infected people [13] . Proper awareness of modes of transmission of the disease can help in preventing the spread of the infection. Several studies have been conducted to assess the knowledge of MERS among various sections of the society [14] [15] [16] . A recent study conducted throws light on the lack of knowledge of the general public regarding the probable epidemic nature of the disease [15] . Arabia. Acute respiratory problem along with fever, cough or shortness of breath are the most common symptoms of MERS Co-V infection. Apart from the aforementioned health problems, many people infected with the virus suffered from diarrhoea, nausea or vomiting. In a small fraction of cases, people with infection showed very mild or no symptoms. The mortality rate is comparatively high in people suffering from comorbidities [17] . People suffering from kidney problems, cancer, diabetics, respiratory problems etc. are more likely to be severely infected by the virus [12] . Rivers et al. used Poisson regression to identify the risk factors associated with death and severity of the disease. They concluded that advancing age and pre-existing diseases were the main risk factors leading to death and severe infection [18] . Ahmed employed statistical methods to determine the predictors responsible for recovery from the disease after 3 and 30 days of onset of symptoms. The study identified old age, non-healthcare workers, severe infection and hospital-acquired infection as the leading factors responsible for mortality [19] .",

Hence the feature animal exposure turned out to be an insignificant attribute. However, it is to be specially noted that nearly 80% of the recovered patients who had exposure to camels were initially in a stable condition. This may have contributed immensely to recovery thereby making camel exposure as an insignificant factor. Nearly 10% of the MERS infected patients exhibited no symptoms and had recovered from the disease. It has been observed from the data obtained that all the asymptomatic patients were less severely infected and a majority of them acquired infection from others. The death rate among healthcare workers is negligible. This is due to increased infection awareness, early diagnosis and protective measures taken [26] . The univariate analysis of survival yields the result that gender is a significant factor and male are more likely to die. There is a considerable difference between the number of male and female infected patients. Furthermore the survival rate in women are more than men. This may be due to the following reasons:",

This is due to the fact that attributes such as age, pre-existing diseases and critical initial status shield the gender attribute. It is obvious that irrespective of gender, the aforementioned characteristics adversely affect recovery. Univariate analysis shows that acquiring infection from others is a significant feature. The death rate due to primary infection is nearly double that of infection acquired from others. Both univariate and multivariate analysis shows that age is a significant attribute in determining recovery and older people are more likely to die. The mortality rate is around 50% in patients above 50 years of age. This is attributed to the fact that they are most likely to suffer from other comorbidities [12] . Both univariate and multivariate analysis reflect that pre-existing diseases have a negative impact on recovery. The above facts suggest that the elderly and people suffering from comorbidities demand special care in the treatment of MERS [18] .",

The important factors identified include the patient's age, pre-existing diseases, initial status (severity of the infection) and whether he/she is a healthcare worker or not. Though MERS Co-V is zoonotic in nature, animal exposure is not a major factor leading to death. This is evidently due to stable initial condition of majority of the patients exposed to camels. The experiments conducted show that the severity of the disease is the most significant factor influencing recovery from the disease. It is apparent that the mortality rate can be reduced considerably, if the infected people seek medical attention at the earliest. Therefore widespread public awareness regarding the symptoms of MERS will play a vital role in increasing the recovery rate. Since the infection also spreads due to person to person contact, an effective monitoring system is highly essential to prevent the disease from spreading.",
