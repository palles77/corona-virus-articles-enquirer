Since its discovery in the 1950s, the majority of cases have been documented in HIV patients with low CD4 counts. In northern Thailand, T. marneffei is the fourth most prevalent opportunistic infection in this population (Chariyalertsak et al., 2001) . Clinical manifestations include fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy, cough, and hepatosplenomegaly (Wu et al., 2008) . While the frequency of T. marneffei infection has decreased with the advent of retroviral therapy, if left untreated the infection frequently leads to respiratory failure with a poor prognosis.",

Clinical and geographic context plays a particularly important role because some of these tests have been shown to have cross-reactivities. Pulmonary infection either by fungi, bacteria or virus has been observed to cause concomitant hyponatremia, with inappropriate levels of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) often found as the underlying etiology.

CT scan with contrast of the head and neck did not reveal acute intracranial abnormalities but did show cervical lymphadenopathy. Gram stain smear and culture of the sputum were negative. Respiratory viral panel including influenza, parainfluenza, coronavirus and RSV was negative. Legionella urine antigen was negative. Bacterial blood cultures and gram stain were negative. QuantiFERON gold and three sputum samples for AFB/culture were negative for tuberculosis. Serological testing for Cryptococci and Blastomyces were negative.

These infections in their disseminated forms will receive amphotericin-B with itraconazole.

ADH is produced on the paraventricular thalamic nucleus and thus classically this syndrome is observed after neurological insults that cause an excess in ADH. Nevertheless, it has been observed that respiratory tract infections can cause inadequate ADH secretion and these are the most common infections in HIV patients. Increase in the A-a gradient and hypoxia/hypercapniainduced ADH secretion are some of the non-osmotic mechanisms thought to trigger elevations in ADH in this population. It has been proposed that hypercapnic acidosis and hypoxemia induce central release of vasopressin through peripheral chemoreceptors and baroreceptors stimulation respectively (Rose et al., 1984; Dreyfuss et al., 1988) . Tuberculosis, cryptosporidium, plasmodium infections and Pneumocystis pneumonia have been previously reported as pulmonary infections causing SIADH. It is of note that HIV by itself could contribute to SIADH. But the mechanism underlying this infection is usually mediated by HIV induced thyroid and adrenal insufficiency. In our case, the patient had increased urinary sodium, decreased serum osmolality, normal cortisol and TSH levels and absence of neurological affect, leaving the pulmonary fungal infection as one of the explanations for inadequate ADH secretion.",
