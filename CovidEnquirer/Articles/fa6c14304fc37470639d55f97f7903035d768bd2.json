To this aim, we collected chronic wounded tissue from patients infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as shown by wound swabs. We stained the paraffinembedded tissue sections with an antibody against P. aeruginosa to confirm its presence in the wounds. As control, we used normal skin samples. Indeed, we could detect the presence of P. aeruginosa, either as biofilm or in the form of small colonies (Fig. 1A) . We subsequently stained for LecB and strikingly, we found this lectin to be distributed in the wound sections, both in the keratinocyte layers and in the dermis (Fig. 1B) . In contrast, no LecB was found in the normal skin control sample, proving the specificity of the antibody.",

LecB plays a crucial role in the adhesion of the bacterium to host cells [17] , implying the necessity for the lectin to target plasma membrane receptors via their glycosylated residues. Therefore, we screened for potential LecB interacting proteins via a pull-down assay. Briefly, we cultured NHKs in presence or absence of 5 \u03bcg/ml (106 nM) of biotinylated LecB, lysed them under conditions that preserve protein-protein interactions and incubated with streptavidin agarose beads to precipitate LecB in complex with interacting proteins. We performed on bead digestion and analysed the obtained peptides by protein mass spectrometry. This analysis revealed the presence of important cell growth factor receptors within the enriched proteins in the LecB pull down fractions (SI Appendix, Table S1 ). The mass spectrometry results were verified by western blot, confirming the presence of two of the major keratinocyte growth factor receptors implicated in epidermal keratinocytes proliferation and migration, the insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGF-1R) and the epidermal growth factor receptor 1 (EGF-1R) [20, 21] , in the eluted fractions. In addition to stimulating the cells with biotinylated LecB, an excess of L-fucose (30 mM) was added to clarify whether the interaction with IGF-1R or EGFR-1R was carbohydrate-dependent. As L-fucose saturates the carbohydratebinding pockets of LecB, no binding to cell membranes could be detected when LecB and Lfucose were simultaneously applied to the cells as neither IGF-1R or EGF-1R, nor LecB could be precipitated ( Fig. 2A and SI Appendix, Fig. S1A ).",

Indeed, surface staining experiments showed that IGF-1R is depleted from the plasma membrane of keratinocytes in a time-dependent manner as a consequence of LecB incubation (Fig. 2B, C) . IGF-1R internalisation from the cell surface was also visible after stimulation with 100 ng/ml of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) (SI Appendix, Fig. S2A, B) . However, while IGF-1 induced a fast autophosphorylation of the receptor on multiple tyrosine residues (Tyr1135, Tyr1131 and 7 Tyr1136), LecB did not (Fig. 2D , E, F). Thus, we concluded that LecB does not lead to the activation of IGF-1R, but rather triggers a \"silent\" receptor internalisation.",

While the former ultimately results in the phosphorylation and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), the latter activates the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). In order to check whether these two signalling cascades were affected by LecB, we monitored ERK1/2 and mTOR phosphorylation at Thr202/Tyr204 and Ser2448, respectively. The amounts of phosphorylated proteins were normalised to the respective pan-proteins. Indeed, LecB did not lead to the phosphorylation of both ERK1/2 and mTOR. ERK1/2 phosphorylation actually significantly decreased 1 h post stimulation ( Fig. 3A-D) . In contrast, LecB activated 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a cellular energy and nutrient status sensor, activated in response to cellular energy depletion (Fig. 3A , E). AMPK phosphorylation significantly increased after 3 h post stimulation and was inhibited by addition of L-fucose, confirming to be LecB-dependent (SI Appendix, Fig. S3A , B).",

Untreated keratinocytes present several light content vacuoles (Category 1), corresponding to endo-lysosomal compartments (Fig. 4A ), LecB treated cells display numerous degradative vesicles (Category 2) and an additional type of vacuoles (Category 3), with irregular shapes and variable sizes (Fig. 4B) . Surprisingly, these vacuoles contain a large number of clearly defined intraluminal vesicles (Fig. 4B ) and they seem to cluster together to form an intricate network (Fig. 4B', zoom) . To get insights into the origin of these structures, we performed a time-course experiment by collecting cells at different time points, from 30 min to12 h after exposure to LecB (SI Appendix, Fig. S4A -E). The Category 3 vacuoles were detectable after 30 min of LecB incubation, but they were quite rare. However, they became more prominent 3 h post LecB exposure (SI Appendix, Fig. S4D ). Interestingly, specific regions of the plasma membrane of the LecB-treated keratinocytes were extremely irregular and characterised by the presence of ruffle-like structures (SI Appendix, Fig. S4A-E) . As the number of Category 3 vesicles located at these regions increased over time, we hypothesised that the intraluminal vesicles-containing vacuoles originate from subdomains of the plasma membrane upon LecB interaction with surface proteins. This notion implies that LecB is present in the Category 3 vacuoles. To test this hypothesis, we exposed keratinocytes to biotinylated LecB before performing immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) using anti-biotin antibodies (Fig. 4C-F) . Notably, we specifically detected LecB on both the limiting membrane of the Category 3 vacuoles and to a minor . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Moreover, but to a minor extent, we also observed a time-dependent colocalisation between LecB and lysosomalassociated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) (SI Appendix, Fig. S5A ). In contrast, no colocalisation with the recycling endosome marker protein RAB11 was detected (SI Appendix, Fig. S5B ). Endocytosis and internalisation of LecB was also assessed biochemically by analysing the ubiquitination of the proteins associated with LecB, as a large number of growth factor receptors undergo ubiquitination upon endocytosis [26, 27] . In a time-course pull-down experiment we detected a decrease of the total levels of IGF-1R and an increase of the overall cell ubiquitin levels in the eluted fraction, indicating that on one hand IGF-1R is targeted for degradation and on the other hand that LecB interacting partners are ubiquitinated, thus very likely internalised (SI Appendix, Fig. S6A , B).",

Furthermore, it is possible that LecB induces a similar fate to other cell types, including immune cells, thus promoting the infection.

Electron microscopy inspection of LecB-treated cells revealed the peculiar nature of these vacuoles that over time accumulate and display an increased number of intraluminal vesicles. We also show that these vacuoles originate from ruffle-like plasma membrane regions where LecB was also found to be enriched. In the case of other bacterial lectins, such as the B-subunit of Shiga toxin (StxB) from Shigella dysenteriae and LecA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the sole interaction with the glycosphingolipid receptor globotriaosyl ceramide (Gb3) is sufficient to drive membrane shape changes leading to their subsequent uptake [3, 46] . In the case of LecB, however, pull-down experiments point to the existence of several receptors, also attributable to the fact that fucosylation is a very common modification. Additionally, LecB exists as a tetramer and each monomer possesses a binding pocket with the highest affinity to L-fucose and its derivatives [8, 47] . Although the L-fucose dissociation constant is in the micromolar range (2.9 \u03bcM), an increase in avidity can be achieved by a higher degree of interactions. This implies that LecB might crosslink several different surface receptors, thus inducing a higher degree of membrane rearrangements that could explain the extensive alterations at the plasma membrane.

Therefore, our data indicate that LC3 is recruited on LecB containing late endosomes, which may further favour their lysosomal degradation through a process that may be similar or identical to LAP. LAP can be triggered by several receptors. In addition to toll-like receptors (TLRs), whose signalling during phagocytosis rapidly recruits LC3 to phagosomes, the phosphatidylserine receptor TIM4 or the C-type lectin Dectin-1 can also induce LAP to efficiently clear dead cells and to facilitate antigen presentation, respectively[29, 48, 49] . LC3 can associate with single-membrane phagosomes even in absence of pathogens or dead cells, such in the case of phagocytosis and degradation of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) by retinal pigment epithelium or during the secretion of mucins in goblet cells [50, 51] . Our data indicate that IGF-1R colocalises with LecB and LC3, suggesting that LAP is involved in IGF-1R sorting for degradation, following LecBmediated receptor internalisation.",

Additionally, to exclude endotoxin contamination, LecB was further purified using an endotoxin removal column (Hyglos) and a LAL chromogenic endotoxin quantitation kit (Thermo Scientific) was carried out. The purity of the lectin was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. If not stated differently, LecB was used at a final concentration of 5 \u03bcg/ml (106 nM).LecB was fluorescently labelled using Cy3 (GE Healthcare) or Alexa Fluor488 (Thermo Scientific) mono-reactive NHS ester and purified using Zeba Spin desalting columns (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturers' instructions.Biotinylated LecB was obtained using sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Thermo Scientific) according to the supplier's instructions and dialysed two times for 1 h in water and one time overnight in PBS. seeded in T-75 flasks and stimulated with biotinylated LecB at a concentration of 5 \u03bcg/mL.

The protein lysates were incubated over night at 4 \u00b0C with streptavidin agarose beads (Thermo Scientific) to precipitate LecB-biotin-protein complexes. The beads were washed 4 times in PBS and then re-suspended in 8M urea.Immunoprecipitates were pre-digested with LysC (1:50, w/w) followed by reduction of disulfide bonds with 10 mM DTT and subsequent alkylation with 50 mM iodacetamide. Then samples were diluted 1:5 with ammonium bicarbonate buffer pH 8 and trypsin (1:50, w/w) was added for overnight digestion at RT. The resulting peptide mixtures were acidified and loaded on C18 StageTips[56]. Peptides were eluted with 80% acetonitrile (ACN), dried using a SpeedVac centrifuge, and resuspended in 2% ACN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), and 0.5% acetic acid.Peptides were separated on an EASY-nLC 1200 HPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Odense) coupled online to a Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer via a nanoelectrospray source (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
