To commemorate the 70th anniversary of this seminal declaration, we trace the evolution of human rights in global health, linking the past, present, and future of health as a human right (figure 1). This future remains uncertain. As contemporary challenges imperil continuing advance ments, threatening both human rights protections and global health governance, the fu ture will depend, as it has in the past, on sustained po litical engagement to realise human rights in global health.",

Operating through the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), the UN would \"make recom mendations for the purpose of promoting respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all\". 3 With the UN Charter also calling for the establishment of an international health organisation, WHO had the responsibility to operationalise human rights for public health. The 1946 WHO Constitution declared, for the first time, that \"the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being\", thereby establishing government responsibilities to ensure \"a state of complete physi cal, mental, and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\". 4 In creating a rights based foundation for global health governance, the WHO Constitution repre sented the world's most expansive conceptualisa tion of international responsi bility for health. 5 Figure 1 : The international development of human rights for health (1948-2018) WHO ",

Through this holistic vision, the UDHR situated health under the right to an adequate standard of living: \"Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and wellbeing of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medi cal care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of liveli hood in circumstances beyond his control\". 6 The human right to health, thus, encompassed both indivi dual health services and national health systems, with national health systems including social measures for public health. 9",

The resulting Declaration of AlmaAta re cognised the importance of participatory, broadbased socioeconomic development to build sustainable, compre hensive primary healthcare systems. Viewing health inequalities as a common concern to all countries, the Declaration reaffirmed health as a fundamental human right and worldwide social goal, 17 enumerating rightsbased obligations for primary health care. 18",

Reacting to societal stigmatisation of marginalised communities, discriminatory criminalisation of key populations, and public health infringements on in dividual liberty, civil society rose up to demand rights. AIDS activists fiercely challenged policy makers. Rights based campaigns resounded throughout the world: WHO came to embrace an inextricable link between public health and human rights in the AIDS response. 20 WHO's Global Programme on AIDS, launched in 1987 (figure 3), shaped a rightsbased framework for global health. 21 International guidelines recommended risk reduct ion strategies, such as needle exchanges, tran sition ing the AIDS response from punitive measures to health promotion. 22 As scientific breakthroughs ushered in the antiretroviral era, AIDS activists demanded uni versal access to treatment as a human rights im pera tive, giving rise to transformative institutions, from The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief to The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. 23",

WHO enlisted its first human rights advisor to operationalise a rightsbased approach in its programmes and collaborate with the UN human rights system. 27 At the turn of the millennium, the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, charged with overseeing ICESCR implementation, adopted general comment 14, providing an authoritative interpretation of the right to health. 28 The general comment went beyond preventive and curative health care to address underlying determi nants of health beyond the health sector, including food, housing, work, education, nondis crimination, and equality. 29 The UN Special Rapporteurs on the Right to Health and WHO's Commission on Social Determinants of Health thereafter elaborated the multisectoral ob ligations needed to implement healthrelated rights in areas such as mental health, health behaviour, maternal mortality, and access to treatment.",

Financial constraints are undermining advances in public health, including in HIV/ AIDS, since HIV prevention efforts have stalled, incidence is rising among marginalised populations, and in vestments in highimpact interventions focused on those populations most at risk are restricted. Racial and ethnic minorities continue to experience stigma, discrimination, and exclusion, while pervasive gender norms and stereotypes endure, with harmful repercussions on health and wellbeing as well as access to health services. Shrinking civil society space restricts dialogue with those whose experience and voice are vital to reduce health inequities. Attacks on health and human rights stand in direct contradiction to international human rights and humanitarian law. 43 Global threats, such as climate change, armed conflict, and mass migration, are exacerbating divisions within and across nations, in stark contrast to the UDHR's proclamation of common humanity. 44 In 2018, in response to these challenges, WHO revitalised its commitment to a rightsbased approach to health. The 13th General Programme of Work, WHO's 5year strategy, calls for leadership on equity, gender, and human rights to achieve its 3 billion objective: 1 billion more people accessing UHC, 1 billion more people protected from health emergencies, and 1 billion more people enjoying better health and wellbeing. 45 WHO is expanding partner ships with civil society, convening a civil society task team to promote inclusive participation to achieve its goals. WHO has also signed a 5year Memorandum of Understanding with the UN Office of the High Com missioner for Human Rights to bolster technical and political cooperation.",

Dec 10 is Human Rights Day, in commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the UDHR. While we celebrate the enduring legacies of human rights, we must also strive to identify and rectify the constraints on rightsbased governance for public health in a globalis ing world. It is more important than ever for the health and human rights communities to stand together as partners to uphold the values of the UDHR and resist contemporary threats to human rights. The human rights progress of the past, bringing together topdown leadership in global health governance with bottomup civil society advocacy, highlights the importance of sustained politi cal engagement to realise the right to health. Health practitioners have a crucial role in this political engage ment, advancing rightsbased public health policies, pro grammes, and practices that are essential to secure the future of human rights in global health.",
