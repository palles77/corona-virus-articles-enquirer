Nitazoxanide exhibits in vitro activity against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and other coronaviruses, inhibiting expression of the viral N protein. Nitazoxanide also suppresses production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and suppresses interleukin 6 production in mice. Having been used extensively in clinical trials and in post-marketing experience, nitazoxanide is an attractive drug candidate for treatment of Middle East respiratory syndrome. Future research should include in vitro mechanism studies, animal models of MERS-CoV infection, clinical trials, including dose-ranging trials, and evaluation of combination therapy with other potential MERS-CoV antivirals.",

The concentrations required to inhibit viral replication by 50% (IC 50 s) are between 0.2 and 1.5 g/ml in multiple human and canine cell lines using single-step virus growth with high multiplicity of infection (5 PFU/cell) and multi-step growth with low multiplicity of infection (0.001 PFU/cell). These IC 50 concentrations are easily achieved in humans following administration of nitazoxanide extended-release tablets, as peak and trough plasma concentrations during repeated twice daily dosing have been reported to be 4.6 and 0.8 g/ml, respectively. Tizoxanide acts synergistically with oseltamivir and zanamivir in inhibiting in vitro replication of influenza viruses, and it exhibits a high barrier to resistance with no decrease in sensitivity to influenza A viruses after passage for 30 days in increasingly sub-inhibitory concentrations of drug [2] [3] [4] .",

The broad-spectrum antiviral activity of tizoxanide is attributed to interference with host-regulated pathways involved in viral replication, rather than a virus-targeted mechanism. These pathways may include interferon or mTORC1 signaling pathways [2, 5] . In the case of influenza, tizoxanide ultimately blocks the maturation of viral hemagglutinin at the post-translational stage. It does not affect the neuraminidase glycoprotein (the target of oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir) or the M2 protein (the target of amantadine), and it has no effect on viral infectivity, adsorption or entry into target cells [3] .",
