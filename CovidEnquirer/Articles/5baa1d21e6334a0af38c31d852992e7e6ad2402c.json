As HBV core protein (HBc) is the most conservative and immunogenic component, in this study we used an overlapping 9-mer peptide pool covering HBc to screen and identify specific CTL epitopes. An unconventional HLA-A2-restricted epitope HBc141-149 was discovered and structurally characterized by crystallization analysis. The immunogenicity and anti-HBV activity were further determined in HBV and HLA-A2 transgenic mice. Finally, we show that mutations in HBc141-149 epitope are associated with viral parameters and disease progression in HBV infected patients. Our data therefore provide insights into the structure characteristics of this unconventional epitope binding to MHC-I molecules, as well as epitope specific CTL activity that orchestrate T cell response and immune evasion in HBV infected patients.",

HBV-specific CD8 + T lymphocytes (CTL)-mediated immune response is multi-specific, polyclonal, and vigorous during acute hepatitis B (AHB), which plays a vital role in viral control and viral clearance, as well as disease pathogenesis (Yukihiro, 2012; Westover and Hughes, 2007; Tan et al., 2008) .

Analysis of CTLs specific for viral epitopes within core (Sendi et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2012; ) , envelope (Liu et al., 2008) , polymerase (Rehermann et al., 1995) , and X (Hwang et al., 2002) proteins showed that the highly conserved HBV core protein (HBc) elicits the strongest CTL responses than other viral proteins, suggesting that HBc-specific T cell response may play a leading role in viral control and clearance. To identify immune-dominant HBV-specific CTL epitopes, especially epitopes from HBc protein, is therefore necessary for monitoring T cell responses during disease progression, as well as for developing epitope-based therapeutic vaccines against CHB (Inchauspe and Michel, 2007; Gordon et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013a, b) .",

However, most of these identified epitopes are derived from HBV of genotypes A and D, few HLA class I restricted epitopes have been defined in virus of genotypes B and C, which are more prevalent in Asia. Meanwhile, currently the mostly used methods to predict and identify T cell epitopes are either by computer algorithms based on the mode of peptide binding to MHC molecules, or measurement of T cell responses of PBMCs simulated with panels of overlapping peptides (Liu et al., 2011) . These epitope identification strategies may ignore unconventional T cell epitopes as computational analysis is largely based on the characteristic of anchor residues.",

HBc141-149 spanning from HBc aa 141 to 149 was chosen as the focus of this study due to its high binding affinity among the top hits from screening. To determine the minimal sequence length of the epitope, panels of N-or C-terminally truncated or extended peptides of HBc141-149 were synthesized. The FIs of truncated peptide HBc141-148 (STLPETTV) and HBc142-149 (TLPETTVV) were only 0.124 and 0.151, respectively (Fig. 1C) .

All HBc141-149 truncated and extended peptides displayed little binding to HLA-A*0201, which indicates that the 9-mer peptide HBc141-149 is the optimized epitope in length. In addition to T2 cell binding assay, the capability of HBc141-149 to bind to HLA-A*0201 was observed in the refolding assay (Fig. 1E ).",

The crystal structure of the HLA complex was determined to 2.3 \u212b resolution (Table 1 ). The structure of HLA-A*0201/HBc141-149 shows that HBc141-149 possesses a typical conformation of an HLA-A2-restricted 9-mer epitope ( Fig. 2A and 2B ). The unambiguous electron densities of HBc141-149 clearly show that position 2 (T2) and position 9 (V9) are buried in pockets B and F, respectively (Fig. 2C ). Compared to the typical HLA-A2-restricted epitopes which have an anchor residue Leu or Met at position 2, HBc141-149 has Thr at position 2. The side chain OH of Thr does not disrupt its inserting into the hydrophobic pocket B properly (Fig. 2D) . Instead, the side chain OH of Thr can form a strong hydrogen bond interaction with H atom of Glu on the \u03b11 domain of the heavy chain, which helps HBc141-149 binding to the HLA-A2 heavy chain and stabilizes the entire complex. The side chains of amino acids P4, E5, and V8 protrude out from the HLA-A2 surface and may be involved in T cell receptor (TCR) attachment and recognition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first structure showing the binding features of HLA-A2 to HBc141-149 with an unconventional P2 anchor Thr.",

We then evaluated HBc141-149 peptide-induced Tcell response could lead to inhibition of HBV.

The prevalence of the HBc141-149 mutations increased with the disease progression in HBV-infected patients (Fig. 5D ). To investigate the impact of these sequence variations within HBc141-149 epitope on its immunogenicity, three 9-mer peptides containing main epitope variations of HBcV149I, HBcT147A, and HBcT147C in CHB patients were synthesized, respectively, for HLA-A2.1/Kb transgenic mice immunization. As seen in Fig. 5E , compared to the wild-type HBc141-149 peptide-immunized mice (SFC, 96.7 \u00b1 6.02), CTL responses by ELISPOT assay were significantly decreased in HBcV149I mutant peptide-(SFC, 66.3 \u00b1 5.69) or HBcT147A mutant peptide-immunized mice (SFC, 73 \u00b1 7.81). Taken together, these results suggest that the HBc141-149 mutations associated with necroinflammation and higher HBV levels, and it may also be associated with poor prognosis, which may be due to viral immune evasion.",

These methods are effective and rapid to purposefully identify epitopes, however, a considerable number of atypical or unconventional epitopes may be ignored or missed by these methods due to the limitation of anchor residues analysis-based computation (Liu et al., 2011) . In this study, an overlapping 9-mer peptide pool was used to screen B and C genotype-derived HBc-specific CTL epitopes, and HBc141-149 was identified as a new 9-mer HLA-A2restricted T cell epitope. Importantly, similar numbers of HBc141-149-specific and immunodominant epitope HBc18-27-specific CD8 + T cells were observed in AHB patients (Fig. 3C) , indicating that HBc141-149 is an immunodominant epitope in HBV-infected patients. However, the newly defined epitope HBc141-149 (STLPETTVV) in this study possesses Thr at position 2. Different T cell epitope prediction programs, including SYFPEITHI (http://www.syfpeithi. de/Scripts/MHCServer.dll/Epitope-Prediction.htm), NET-MHC (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHC/), and BIMAS (http: //www-bimas.cit.nih.gov) show the binding score of the epitope HBc141-149 to HLA-A2 is only 0, 1.465, and 0.414, respectively. As HBc141-149 does not get a high score, it could be omitted in conventional screening. Interestingly, as for HBc141-149 (STLPETTVV), the side chain OH of Thr2 can form a stronger hydrogen bond interaction with Glu on \u03b11 domain of the heavy chain, which helps its inserting into ",

Therefore, our data indicated that Thr may also act as a dominant role as a P2 anchor for HLA-A2-binding peptides, which may be taken into consideration in the future designation of these online prediction programs. CD8 + T cells are the main effector cells responsible for viral clearance as well as disease pathogenesis during HBV infection (Thimme et al., 2003; Harari et al., 2006; Ouyang et al., 2013) . As a consequence of long-term interaction between HBV and infected patients, the virus evolves mutations to reduce epitopes for evading immune detection and clearance, especially escape from T cell recognition (Maman et al., 2011; Westover and Hughes, 2007) . Indeed, nonsynonymous mutations in HBV epitope have been found to be associated with disease progression in CHB (Kim et al., 2011; Frelin et al., 2009) . Consistent to these studies, we found that mutations in the newly defined epitope are positively related to viral parameters and pathogenesis of liver disease. The effect of mutations within HBc141-149 on viral replication capability, as well as the potential impact of the epitope-specific CTLs on the interplay of HBV and chronically infected patients remains to be addressed.",
