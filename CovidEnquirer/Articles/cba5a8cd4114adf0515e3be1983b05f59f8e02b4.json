Though not commonly associated with these clinical conditions, studies show that children with HHV-6 are more likely to have diarrhea than age-matched controls (26% vs 11% P = .05), 1 and hepatitis has been associated with HHV-6 in infants 10,11 and stem-cell and solid organ transplant patients. 12, 13 This case also demonstrates that liver and central nervous system involvement may not be present initially, warranting repeated laboratory testing if symptoms persist beyond a few days. Although this patient lacked features for an encephalitis diagnosis according to International Encephalitis Consortium criteria (seizures, focal neurologic abnormalities, pleocytosis, neuroimaging changes), 14 the presence of HHV-6 DNA in the CSF was associated with encephalopathy without an alternative explanation (broad-based CSF multiplex PCR and mNGS testing were negative for other pathogens). Normal CSF white blood cell counts are welldescribed in HHV-6 central nervous system infection, which supports a role for HHV-6 testing in the setting of encephalopathy regardless of pleocytosis. 6 Qualitative detection of HHV-6 DNA alone does not establish the virus as the cause of an illness. Chromosomal integration of HHV-6 is present in 1% of the population, 15 often passed through the germline in newborns. With chromosomal integration, HHV-6 DNA is detectable in all nucleated cells, often present in CSF, persistent over time, 16 and present in blood at high viral loads. HHV-6 also can establish latency in monocytes and macrophages following primary infection. Although detection of reactivated herpesviruses can represent serious illness in immunocompromised patients, 17 their detection usually is unrelated to the primary cause of disease in immunocompetent hosts. Additional laboratory studies are available to distinguish chromosomally integrated HHV-6 DNA from active or reactivated infection. For example, a whole blood quantitative PCR result greater than 5.5 log copies/mL of blood 18 or serial tests showing persistently high levels of HHV-6 DNA over time support a diagnosis of chromosomal integration. Acute and convalescent serologic testing is another method to distinguish active infection from reactivation or chromosomally integrated DNA. However, serial testing may be unavailable or impractical for use in the clinical setting, particularly when a timely diagnosis is needed. This patient's young age made reactivation unlikely, and his eventual development of a characteristic roseola-type exanthem with selfresolution of fever was highly consistent with primary HHV-6 infection. As a result, definitive laboratory confirmation was not performed.",
