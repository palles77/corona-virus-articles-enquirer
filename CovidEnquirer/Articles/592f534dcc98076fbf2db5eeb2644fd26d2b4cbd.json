The sequence diversity of an RNA virus population contributes to its ability to infect the host. This diversity emanates from errors made by the RdRp during RNA synthesis. The physical basis for RdRp fidelity is unclear but is linked to conformational changes occurring during the nucleotide-addition cycle. To understand RdRp dynamics that might influence RdRp function, we have analyzed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations on the nanosecond timescale of four RdRps from the picornavirus family that exhibit 30-74% sequence identity. Principal component analysis showed that the major motions observed during the simulations derived from conserved structural motifs and regions of known function. The dynamics of residues participating in the same biochemical property, for example, RNA binding, nucleotide binding or catalysis, were correlated even when spatially distant on the RdRp structure. The conserved and correlated dynamics of functional structural elements suggest coevolution of dynamics with structure and function of the RdRp. Crystal structures of all picornavirus RdRps exhibit a template-nascent RNA duplex channel too small to fully accommodate duplex RNA. Simulations revealed opening and closing motions of the RNA and nucleoside triphosphate channels, which might be relevant to nucleoside triphosphate entry, inorganic pyrophosphate exit and translocation. A role for nanosecond timescale dynamics in RdRp fidelity is supported by the altered dynamics of the high-fidelity G64S derivative of PV RdRp relative to wild-type enzyme.",

            "text": "The RdRp, like the reverse transcriptase of retroviruses, is a validated target for the development of antiviral therapeutics. 3, 4 One class of inhibitors consists of nucleoside analogues that are converted into the triphosphate in the cell and serve as substrates for the RdRp without terminating RNA synthesis. 4 Incorporation of this type of nucleotide analogue alters genome sequence, structure and/or function, thus leading to the observed antiviral activity. 4, 5 Only one drug, ribavirin, is currently used clinically that can be placed into this class of nucleoside analogues as an antiviral agent targeting the RdRp. Interestingly, ribavirin is the only clinically approved broad-spectrum antiviral nucleoside. 4, 6 The clinical efficacy of any inhibitor will be antagonized by the development of resistance. Mechanisms of resistance to ribavirin have been studied most extensively in PV [7] [8] [9] and the related foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). [10] [11] [12] These studies have revealed that RdRp variants exhibiting altered fidelity of nucleotide incorporation are less sensitive to ribavirin in cell culture. 7, 8, 12 However, viruses harboring these ribavirin-resistant alleles of the RdRp are attenuated in animals, 13 and these attenuated viruses elicit protective immunity against a lethal challenge with wild-type (WT) virus. 14 Together, these studies lead to the suggestion that RdRp fidelity is optimized to provide RNA viruses with population diversity that is apparently required for pathogenesis. Therefore, RdRp fidelity represents an important, untapped target for development of antiviral agents and development of attenuated virus variants that can be used as vaccine strains. Unfortunately, the physical basis for nucleic acid polymerase fidelity is not completely clear.",

The structure of the PV RdRp revealed three subdomains: fingers (including fingertips), thumb and palm (Fig. 1a) . 17 Interaction between the fingertips and the thumb leads to a completely encircled active site (Fig. 1a) . The fingers and thumb subdomains contribute primarily to nascent RNA (primer) and template binding ( Table  1 ). The palm subdomain is required for interacting with the primer 3\u2032-end, templating nucleotide, incoming nucleotide substrates and divalent cations, all of which contribute to the nucleotidyl transfer reaction catalyzed by the RdRp ( Table 1 ). The RNA template and nucleoside substrates access the active site through the template and nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) channels, respectively; for the egress of the newly synthesized RNA, the templatenascent RNA duplex channel is used. The recent structure of PV RdRp in complex with RNA substrate clearly showed the template and template-nascent RNA duplex occupying their corresponding channels. 20 The conserved functions of the RdRp are mediated by conserved structural motifs (A-G in Fig. 1b ) that contain conserved residues (Table 1) . Structures are also available for the RdRps from coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), human rhinovirus type 16 (HRV16) and FMDV. 19, 21, 22 The structures of these RdRps are essentially identical with that of the PV RdRp in spite of substantial sequence differences (Fig. S1 ).",

We observed the largest amplitude motions for residues contributing to conserved structural motifs required for nucleic acid and nucleotide binding and catalysis. Correlated motions were also apparent for these dynamic structural motifs. In contrast, conserved structural motifs required for divalent cation binding were the least flexible. Finally, rigid-body movement of the fingers and thumb subdomains relative to the palm subdomain led to expansion and contraction of the RNA and NTP channels, revealing the conformation that likely exists in solution. Given these intriguing findings of potential mechanistic and biological importance, we extended our analysis to RdRps from related viruses, specifically, CVB3, HRV16 and FMDV. Overall, there was congruence in the results obtained for the RdRps from all four viruses. Together, these studies provide compelling evidence for coevolution of dynamics and structure among the picornavirus RdRps and provide support for the hypothesis that RdRp dynamics are required for function. Finally, we used MD simulation of the The residues shown in boldface are completely conserved among RdRps; those residues representing signatures of the conserved sequence motifs are shown in boldface and underlined. 18 b The identification of residues' functions was based on the crystal structure of the RdRp-RNA-NTP complex of FMDV RdRp (PDB code 1WNE). 19 high-fidelity derivative of PV RdRp (G64S) to show that this single-amino-acid substitution altered the dynamics of elements implicated in binding and conformational rearrangements of the NTP substrate. We conclude that dynamics is an important contributor to RdRp functions, in particular, the fidelity of nucleotide selection.",

To yield information on components of the PV RdRp structure that are major contributors to the motions observed during the simulation, we performed a principal component analysis (PCA) 36, 37 using the trajectory of the entire production run. This analysis considers motions as the variance of atomic fluctuations around the average structure. Here, we only considered the variance (mean-square displacements) of C \u03b1 atoms. The number of principal components (PCs or modes) is equal to 3 \u00d7 C \u03b1 atoms (461 atoms in the case of PV RdRp). Every mode is associated with an eigenvalue, which corresponds to the magnitude of the fluctuation along that particular mode and contains different contributions from the analyzed atoms. The first mode represents the largest atomic fluctuation in the sampled conformations. The second mode represents the next largest atomic fluctuation orthogonal to the axis of the previous mode and so on. A majority (\u223c 70%) of the total variance sampled Fig. 3 . Per-residue RMSD analysis of PV RdRp suggests substantial conformational changes. The averaged per-residue RMSD was calculated using frames extracted from the last 10 ns of the trajectory at 10-ps intervals. Prior to calculation, the snapshots were superimposed onto the minimized starting structure using the backbone atoms of (a) the palm or (b) the thumb. High per-residue RMSD values for regions outside the subdomain employed for the superimposition indicate substantial conformational changes in the PV RdRp structure during simulation. In (b), segments of low per-residue RMSD values in regions other than the thumb subdomain are highlighted with short colored bars The low per-residue RMSD values suggest that residues of the highlighted regions move concertedly with residues of the thumb subdomain. (c) The residues highlighted in (b) are shown on the PV RdRp structure. These residues are involved in direct interactions with the thumb. during the simulation could be accounted for by the top six PCs. Therefore, we restricted our focus to these PCs. We calculated the displacement of each C \u03b1 atom in each of the top six modes, which was then summed to produce the total displacement for the individual residues represented by C \u03b1 atoms. In order to render the PCA in a manner that would facilitate comparisons with other simulated systems, we normalized the per-residue sum of the displacements of the top six modes to the average of the least flexible 5% of residues in the enzyme.",

Interestingly, essentially all of these regions are important for optimal viral fitness at 39.5\u00b0C 38 and for the recruitment of the polymerase to the initiation complex. 39 We considered the direction of motion for PC1, which accounts for 42% of the total motions (Fig. 4c ). This analysis revealed expansion-contraction and/ or hinge-twisting motions of the three channels of the enzyme. First, the template-nascent RNA duplex channel (denoted as nascent RNA channel) opened and closed more than once during the simulation. Each cycle of opening and closing comprised residues of the fingers (1-16, 96-149 and 269-283) and the thumb moving in opposite directions that resembled a hinge-twisting motion. When this channel opened, the fingers subdomain moved away from the palm subdomain, and the thumb moved toward the palm with a vectorial bias in the direction of the NTP channel. Second, the NTP channel opened and closed more than once during the simulation. As observed for the nascent RNA channel, each cycle of closing included residues lining the channel (157-176 and 353-365) moving in a correlated manner with a vectorial bias in the direction of the nascent RNA channel. Opening of this channel was driven by the movement of the fingers subdomain (157-176) relative to the palm subdomain (353-365) in opposite directions. Interestingly, when the nascent RNA channel was open, the NTP channel was closed and vice versa. These motions appeared in PC1 for all picornavirus polymerases studied here (data not shown). Finally, the template channel formed by residues (17-27 and 108-116) also expanded and contracted. The opening and closing of this channel was not synchronized with either the nascent RNA or the NTP channels.",

However, there are no known functions for residues 313-317, which showed conserved dynamics in the studied RdRps. Fig. 4 . Functional motifs of PV RdRp largely contribute to the major motions observed during the simulation. (a) The relative displacements of C \u03b1 atoms observed in the sum of the first six PCs (modes) are plotted for each residue. Peaks correspond to regions contributing to the major motions observed during the MD simulations. The structure has been divided into seven segments (S1-S7). The fingers subdomain is shaded purple, the palm subdomain is shaded light gray and the thumb subdomain is shaded orange. The conserved motifs A-G are indicated. Other regions of PV RdRp known to have functional significance have been labeled I-III. (b) PV RdRp structure rendered as a tube to indicate flexibility and shown in two views: (left) looking through the template-nascent RNA duplex channel and (right) looking through the NTP channel. The radius of the tube indicates the magnitude of the relative displacement shown in (a). Each segment has a unique color. Only segments S1, S3, S4, S6 and S7 are shown. Interestingly, highly dynamic regions are located around the nascent RNA duplex and NTP channels. (c) The motion content of PC1, the largest mode of PCA, is visualized in two views that show the PV RdRp from the front (left) and the back (right). The starting structure of PV RdRp is depicted as wires with subdomains colored differently: blue (fingers), gray (palm) and red (thumb). The green \"porcupine needles\" indicate the direction of displacements of motions based on PC1; the size of the needle is proportional to the displacement. From the directions of displacement vectors represented by the needles, expansion and contraction of the RNA and NTP channels can be indicated; interestingly, when the template-nascent RNA duplex channel is open, the NTP channel is closed and vice versa. (d) Structural variation among multiple crystal structures of PV RdRp is represented by RMSD for each residue in PV RdRp, calculated from superimposed crystallographic structures (PDB codes 1RA6, 1RA7, 2IM0, 2IM1, 2IM2, 2IM3, 2ILY and 2ILZ). The structures were superimposed using C \u03b1 atoms of motifs B and C; superimposition was performed using Chimera. Residues that demonstrate large structural variations, indicated by high RMSD values, are implied to be flexible. Structural variations among different crystal structures qualitatively showed a pattern similar to that displayed in (a) for residues in segments S1-S5. The smaller amount of variability of residues in segment S6 could be a result of using residues within this segment for superimposition. Differences between experimental data and simulation observed for residues in segment S7 are attributable to the crystal packing effect where mobility of these residues is masked inside crystals; such an effect is absent from simulation. the displacement, was positively correlated. The motions of motifs F and G are also positively correlated. In contrast to the negative correlation of the dynamics of residues of the fingers and thumb that contribute to the nascent RNA channel, we observed positive correlation between the dynamics of the fingertips and thumb.",

First, we monitored the radius of gyration (R g ) for the backbone atoms during the entire simulation (Fig.  6b ). On average, R g increased by 2-4% relative to the starting structure. Conformations with R g values comparable to those of the reference structure were occasionally sampled during the first half of the trajectory. These data were consistent with expansion and contraction of the entire molecule. When two residues, Ser113 from the fingers and Asp412 from the thumb, located at opposite sides of the nascent RNA channel, were chosen as probes for the size of the channel, expansion and contraction of the channel were readily apparent (Fig. 6c) . The distance between these two residues fluctuated over the entire duration of the simulation. The frequency of each distance observed during the production run of the simulation was evaluated (Fig. 6d) . From this analysis, it is clear that the channel can open by as For each enzyme, the calculated matrix whose elements are the pairwise correlation scores between its residues is visualized as a colored map. The correlation scores are encoded with a color gradient from \u2212 1 (blue, completely anti-correlated) to + 1 (red, completely correlated). The conserved structural motifs are marked with gray bars. Residues that appeared flexible in PCA of PV RdRp (see Fig. 4a ) are shown to be strongly correlated.

Note that the channel width increased from 15.7 \u00c5 in the apo structure of PV RdRp to 18.6 \u00c5 upon formation of the elongation complex, 20 consistent with what we observed in our simulation. The residues affected most by the closed-to-open transition are 19-24, 108-113, 120-132 and 165-170 in the fingers; 359-368 in the palm; and 407-412 and 440-450 in the thumb.

In order to avoid differences due to the statistical nature of the MD simulation, we used the average values for the relative displacement for all residues of a given motif/region of each RdRp (Fig. 7b) . A 3-to 4-fold difference was observed between the most and the least flexible motifs/ regions of each RdRp. With this value in mind, we reasoned that a 1.5-fold difference between RdRps for any motif/region would be a reasonable cutoff for a difference that may have some functional significance. When each motif/region of the RdRps from CVB3, HRV16 and FMDV was compared to that of PV using this criterion, motif A of CVB3 and HRV16 RdRps and motif E of HRV16 RdRp showed the only differences. Outside of the conserved motifs/regions, two additional differences were noted. PV RdRp residues 43-55 were less mobile than the corresponding FMDV RdRp residues. PV Fig. 7 . Conserved dynamics of the RdRps from PV, CVB3, HRV16 and FMDV. (a) The relative displacements of C \u03b1 atoms observed in the sum of the first six PCs (modes) are plotted for each residue. Peaks correspond to regions contributing to the major motions observed during the MD simulations. The structure has been divided into seven segments (S1-S7). The fingers subdomain is shaded purple, the palm subdomain is shaded light gray and the thumb subdomain is shaded orange. The conserved motifs A-G are indicated. Other regions of PV RdRp known to have functional significance have been labeled I-III. Dynamic regions under the peaks across the different polymerases show a striking similarity; the observed dynamic patterns are largely conserved. The major peaks in the different segments (S1-S7) observed in PV are also observed at equivalent positions for the other three RdRps. Nonetheless, differences in relative displacements of motifs A and E as well as of the region spanning residues 43-55 in the fingers are noted. Local sequence and structural variations might account for the differences in the observed dynamics. The plot of PV RdRp, shown previously in Fig. 4 , is included for comparison with the other RdRps. (b) The average relative displacement calculated for the conserved motifs A-G and functional regions I-III of each RdRp is shown.

We next wanted to determine if the MD simulations could inform the molecular basis for phenotypes that were eluded by structural studies. The G64S derivative of PV RdRp exhibits an increase in incorporation fidelity relative to the WT enzyme. 7, 8 This phenotype appears to arise from a decrease in the equilibrium constant for the conformational change step that leads to production of the catalytically competent RdRp-RNA-NTP complex. 7 Gly64 is located some 20 \u00c5 from the catalytic center. The backbone dihedral angles of Gly64 assume a conformation that is disallowed for side chains of all other amino acids. The Gly64 backbone permits stabilization of the amino terminus in the fingers subdomain by mutual hydrogen bonds between backbone atoms and stabilizes motif A by formation of hydrogen bonds with the backbone atoms of Ala239 and Leu241. Thus, it was thought that, by changing Gly64 to Ser, these interactions would be altered, leading to misalignment of motif A, a motif known to contribute to incorporation fidelity. 42 However, the X-ray crystal structure of G64S PV RdRp 24 superimposed with WT PV RdRp with b 0.3-\u00c5 RMSD.

A closer look at position 64 in the averaged structure showed different phi-psi conformations for Gly64 (phi = 169.7\u00b0, psi = \u2212 170.7\u00b0) in the WT and Ser64 (phi = \u2212 159.5\u00b0, psi = 155\u00b0) in the mutant enzymes. The changes in conformations of Ser64 altered the conformations of adjacent residues (59-65) even more dramatically; consequently, the side chain of Phe59 moved out of position, which, in turn, induced Met6 to move in order to maintain the hydrophobic interaction with Phe59 ( Fig. 8d-I) . The movement of Met6 and the adjacent residues influenced the conformations of the Pro8-Pro15 turn. Interestingly, as a result of these conformational changes, the side chain of Glu11 moved away from Arg7, breaking the hydrogen-bonding interaction observed in the WT and forming a new interaction with Lys10 in G64S. This rearrangement of interactions removed restrictions on the movement of the Pro8-Pro15 turn, which was shown to be more flexible in PCA (Fig. 8b and c) .",

In order to scrutinize the trajectory, we calculated B-factors for each residue and compared these to those obtained from the X-ray crystal structure data (Fig. 2) . Overall, the calculated Bfactors were in good agreement with experimental values except for residues participating in crystal contacts. Until recently, there was no empirical information available on the dynamics of PV RdRp or any RdRp for that matter. 26, 43 So, how does one really convince the bench biologist and biochemist that these computational data are functionally relevant? In the case of the picornaviruses, X-ray crystal structures are available for many RdRps in the family including CVB3, HRV16 and FMDV. 19, 21, 22 The biochemical parameters are nearly identical for the PV and FMDV RdRps, which are at the extremes of this group [30% identity on the amino acid level (Fig. S1) ]. 10 The relevance of the algorithm as applied to PV RdRp could be put to test by applying it to the other picornaviral RdRps. We reasoned that any dynamic features of functional significance should be conserved across the family. To our delight, we observed that the overall pattern of flexibility as a function of residues was conserved for all four RdRps evaluated (Fig. 7) . The conservation in dynamics even extended to correlated motions observed between sequence/structural motifs of functional importance (Fig. 7) . Together, our results engender confidence in the utility of MD simulations and suggest conservation in the dynamics of the picornaviral RdRps. As discussed in more detail below, the possibility exists that the dynamics are conserved for function, thus providing additional evidence for a role of dynamics in enzyme catalysis 27, 44 and contributing another enzyme system to use to interrogate this property of enzymes that is likely essential.",

The changes in intersubdomain distances sampled during the course of the nanosecond trajectories were in the 4-to 10-\u00c5 range. Conformational changes of this magnitude are often observed on the microsecond-millisecond timescale in enzymes and appear as rate-limiting events in the kinetic mechanism. 30, 45 In the case of the RdRp, it is clear that the fingers and thumb subdomains undergo conformational changes of this magnitude during the catalytic cycle.

This observa-tion is consistent with the proposal that release of the fingertips from the thumb limits association with and/or dissociation from primed templates in vitro. 48 For PV RdRp, residues of the fingertips (28-42 and 162-173), palm (214-219 and 376-380) and thumb subdomains move as a unit (Fig. 3) . However, these same residues of the fingertips and palm are negatively correlated (Fig. 5) . The thumb appears to be serving as a latch to constrain the complete opening of the channel for the nascent RNA duplex. Therefore, when or if the fingertips-thumb interactions are disrupted, one might expect a concerted opening of the channels for the nascent RNA duplex to enter. This observation applies to all of the picornaviral RdRps studied here (Figs. 3 and Fig. S7 ). The laboratory of Kao has shown that the RdRp from hepatitis C virus, an enzyme that also contains a completely encircled active site, is capable of using circular templates. 48 This observation has been interpreted to mean that the fingertipsthumb interaction is broken during the course of assembly.",

The expansion and contraction of the nascent RNA channel are most influenced by residues (96-117 and 120-149) of the fingers and residues (400-461) of the thumb (Fig. 6) . Crystal structures of PV RdRp show that the channel for the nascent RNA duplex is of insufficient diameter to accommodate duplex RNA. The expansion of the channel observed during the simulation showed that PV RdRp samples conformations sufficient for duplex RNA (Fig. 6) . Similar observations were made for the other RdRps, although the average diameter and magnitude of the expansion and contraction motions varied (Fig. S9) . For every RdRp, conformations of the nascent RNA channel larger than those of duplex RNA (20 \u00c5) were also sampled (Fig. S9) . Of note, differences in the extent of expansion are also observed in complexes of PV and FMDV RdRps with nucleic acid. 20, 49 This \"hyper-expansion\" suggests that translocation can proceed by using a passive mechanism without the need to actively disengage the RdRp from its interactions with the major and minor grooves of the nascent RNA duplex. The \"Brownian\" nature of polymerase translocation has been suggested by others. 50 Another interesting feature of the opening and closing of the nascent RNA duplex channel was that these motions were correlated with the opening and closing of the NTP channel (Fig. 4c) . When the RNA channel was open, the NTP channel was closed and vice versa. Of note, motions of residues lining the NTP channel were biased in the direction of the nascent RNA channel (Fig. 4c) . Given that the solvent and solutes flow through these channels, it is possible that these motions serve to pump reactants and products in and out of the active site. Closing of the NTP channel would force its contents into the nascent RNA channel and perhaps force its opening. Closing of the nascent RNA channel may also facilitate release of unincorporated NTP or inorganic pyrophosphate out of the active site through the NTP channel. The motions for the nascent RNA channel are more complex than those of the NTP channel. Therefore, a directional bias is not as obvious. Such an anti-correlated relationship between the nascent RNA duplex channel and the NTP channel has never been discussed. However, an examination of RdRp crystal structures supports this conclusion. The best example is provided by the rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus RdRp in which open and closed states of the nascent RNA duplex channel were present in the crystal. 51 When the nascent RNA duplex channel is open, the NTP channel is closed and vice versa.",

Of particular importance is Pro20. This residue exhibited a significant change in the psi dihedral angle during simulation where psi changed from 140\u00b0in the average structure to \u2212 5.8\u00b0i n the crystal structure, consistent with the flexible nature of this residue.

Of course, some were exceptionally stable on this timescale (e.g., motifs B and C in Fig. 4a ). The observed flexibility may facilitate interactions that employ an induced-fit mechanism for binding. The more static motifs may employ a lock-and-key mechanism for binding. It is well known that motifs A, D and F contribute to interactions with incoming nucleotide that dictate both ground-state binding and isomerization events that lead to a catalytically competent complex. 42, 52 In contrast, motif B plays an indirect role in selection of rNTP by forming a hydrogen bond with Asp238; motif C and the portion of motif A containing Asp233 serve as ligands for the Mg 2+ required for catalysis, and substantial changes in the positions of these motifs have never been noted when crystal structures of different complexes have been evaluated. Interestingly, regardless of the magnitude of flexibility, all sequence/structural motifs participating in the same aspect of the catalytic cycle exhibited correlated motions (Fig. 5) . Such a high level of coordination between structural elements might be required to facilitate function.",

The reduced flexibility of the catalytic core will limit conformational sampling of the core that may be necessary to achieve catalytic competence. Perhaps, this reduced flexibility would affect the incorrect nucleotides more than the correct nucleotides, hence increasing fidelity. The observations made here suggest two interesting lines of experimental investigation. Clearly, rigidification of the catalytic core is caused by propagation of the restricted motion of the G64S backbone. Dissemination of the reduced flexibility is mediated by an interacting (allosteric) network of amino acids, including, but not limited to, those shown in Fig. 8d . It may be possible to suppress the effects of G64S by introducing glycine residues in the vicinity of the site of interaction between Gly64 and motif A. Alternatively, it may be possible to prevent dissemination of the effects of the G64S substitution to motifs F and D by introducing \"functionally compensatory\" substitutions at various positions on the allosteric pathway. In addition, if a specific distance is required for interactions in the active site that lead to catalytic competence, this state will be sampled less often, given the more expanded nature of the catalytic site. The effect of the reduced sampling could be more severe for incorrect nucleotide incorporation than for correct incorporation, leading to the higherfidelity phenotype.",

At the extremes were the RdRps from PV and FMDV whose primary structures are only 30% identical. The pattern of dynamics observed for all RdRps was conserved and was in good agreement with empirical data on the dynamics of a phage RdRp. The congruence of so much computational and empirical data lends credence to the use of MD simulation for evaluation of RdRp dynamics and leads us to conclude that RdRp dynamics coevolve with the RdRp tertiary structure. The major contributors to the motions on the nanosecond timescale were conserved structural regions required for function. Motions involved in identical function were correlated regardless of location in the structure. Changing a single amino acid residue of PV RdRp remote from the catalytic site that increases polymerase fidelity causes a global change in the observed dynamics of this derivative that extends to the active site. We conclude that RdRp dynamics are governed by long-range networks of interacting residues that have evolved for function, including polymerase fidelity. This groundwork sets the stage for elucidation of the dynamics-function relationships of this important class of enzymes and exploration of RdRp dynamics as a tractable target for development of antivirals and attenuated viruses.",

First, the coordinates of the simulated system were relaxed to remove any steric clashes between the atoms of proteins, waters and ions. This was carried out in multiple steps using SANDER: (1) Short energy minimization of waters and ions only. (2) Short constraint dynamics under conditions of constant pressure and temperature (NPT ensemble) for 100 ps. Only the atoms of waters and ions were allowed to move while constraining the protein atoms using a force constant of 500 kcal/mol \u00c5 2 . (3) Energy minimization of the protein side chains in addition to the waters and ions. (4) Short constraint dynamics run similar to step 2 but allowing the side-chain atoms in addition to the waters and ions to move. (5) All atoms of the entire system were energy minimized, applying convergence criteria for the energy gradient distance root-mean-square (the root-mean-square of the cartesian elements of the gradient) of 0.1 kcal/mol \u00c5. Subsequently, the system was slowly heated to 300 K over a period of 150 ps under conditions of constant volume and temperature (NVT ensemble) and applying a Berndsen thermostat. 59 This was followed by a 200-ps NVT dynamics before switching to NPT dynamics for another 150 ps, applying Berendsen's method 59 with temperature and pressure coupling constants of 1 ps (weak coupling). Finally, the NPT dynamics were continued for the remainder of the MD simulation utilizing the parallel version of PMEMD in AMBER10. The total simulation times for the different systems were 25 ns (PV WT and G64S derivative), 20 ns (FMDV) and 14 ns (CVB3 and HRV16). Snapshots of the MD trajectories were retained every 1 ps for analysis. The first 2 ns (PV), 3 ns (G64S) or 4 ns (CVB3, HRV16 and FMDV) were considered as equilibration times and discarded from analysis. All MD simulations were carried out on 128 Cray XT3 processors, TeraGrid resources managed by the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, and 32 Intel Xeon E5450 Quad-Core processors managed by the High Performance Computing group at The Pennsylvania State University.",

The variance around an average structure can be characterized directly as atomic displacements or motion. In this analysis, our focus was to characterize regions of RdRp structures that contribute most to the major motions described by the top principal modes. To do so, for each C \u03b1 atom, we summed and normalized contributions to the total variance along the top six modes to the average of the least contributing residues (5% of total residues). The relative displacements were plotted as a function of residue (C \u03b1 atoms).",
