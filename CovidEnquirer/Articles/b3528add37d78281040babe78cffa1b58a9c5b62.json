The vast majority of de novo Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infections are acquired from contact with actively infected, coughing individuals (Fennelly et al., 2004; Jones-L\u00f3 pez et al., 2015) . Previous hypotheses regarding the mechanism of cough in pulmonary tuberculosis emphasized the role of infection-induced lung irritation and production of inflammatory mediators (Turner, 2019; Turner and Bothamley, 2015) . However, empiric evidence for these hypotheses is lacking. We generated an alternative hypothesis that Mtb pro-duces a cough-triggering molecule, thereby enhancing its own transmission.",

Chemosensory afferent neurons innervating the upper airway and lungs respond to a variety of chemicals, including exogenous noxious molecules like capsaicin, particulates, and cigarette smoke (Mazzone, 2005; Mazzone and Undem, 2016) . Such neurons have been directly visualized in whole mount biopsies of mouse, rat, guinea pig, and human lungs (De Proost et al., 2007a , 2007b Pintelon et al., 2007) , where their peripheral terminals encode both ion channel and G-protein-coupled chemosensory receptors (Mazzone, 2005; Mazzone and Undem, 2016) . While pulmonary defense against and response to respiratory infection is considered a major function of the cough reflex, whether virulence molecules from cough-inducing pathogens directly stimulate airway afferent neurons is unknown (Cherry, 2013; Hewlett et al., 2014; Turner and Bothamley, 2015) .",

To test this hypothesis, we first demonstrated that guinea pigs with pulmonary tuberculosis cough, and that an organic-phase extract of Mtb consisting primarily of lipid components of its cell wall and fat-soluble molecules is sufficient to induce cough. Exposing nociceptive neurons in vitro to the Mtb extract provokes a rapid increase in intracellular calcium, similar to the nociceptive molecule capsaicin. We determined that the active molecule in the Mtb extract is the mycobacterial lipid sulfolipid-1 (SL-1), an important component of the Mtb cell wall (Goren, 1970a (Goren, , 1970b Goren et al., 1971; Schelle and Bertozzi, 2006) . Genetic disruption of SL-1 biosynthesis results in an Mtb extract that cannot trigger neurons in vitro or induce cough in guinea pigs. Finally, we find that guinea pigs infected with Mtb mutants lacking SL-1 synthesis fail to cough. This work represents the identification of a cough-inducing molecule from a virulent human pathogen, with major implications for the pathogenesis and transmission of tuberculosis.",

We infected guinea pigs with~200 colony-forming units (CFU) of Mtb, placed individual animals in WBP chambers for 24 h every 2 weeks and monitored cough events by plethysmography ( Figures 1A and 1B ). Coughs were quantified using a pressure transducer attached to the WBP chamber ( Figure 1A ). Each cough was automatically identified by a predetermined algorithm based on the box flow pattern (sharp increase and decrease of box flow) that measures the sharp inspiration and expiration of air during a cough ( Figure 1B ). Uninfected control and Mtb-infected guinea pigs showed no statistically significant difference in coughs at 2-or 4-weeks post infection. However, at 6 weeks post-infection, Mtb-infected guinea pigs had twice as many coughs (mean 12 versus 6) compared to control guinea pigs ( Figure 1C ). Thus, Mtb-infected guinea pigs have more coughs than uninfected animals 6 weeks after lowdose infection, at a time of maximal lung CFU (Basaraba et al., 2006; Orme and Ordway, 2016; Turner et al., 2003) .",

We chose the organic fraction because the polyketide mycolactone of M. ulcerans is also isolated via chloroform: methanol extraction (George et al., 1998) and because Mtb has a lipid and organic metabolite rich cell wall with many active molecules (Jankute et al., 2015) . We then used an established model of cough induction, namely, transient exposure of unrestrained, naive, healthy guinea pigs to noxious molecules (Laude et al., 1993; Tanaka and Maruyama, 2005) via a nebulizer and WBP analysis to test if the Mtb extract could trigger cough. As an independent control, we exposed guinea pigs to 0.4 M citric acid, a known cough agonist (Laude et al., 1993; Morice et al., 2007) . After compound nebulization, we quantified coughs over 20 min as previously reported (Laude et al., 1993; Tanaka and Maruyama, 2005; Zaccone et al., 2016) . Each animal was exposed to vehicle control, Mtb extract, or citric acid on alternating days separated by a rest day to avoid tachyphylaxis. Nebulization of the vehicle control for the Mtb extract did not trigger coughing, while exposure to the Mtb extract (20 mg/mL final) produced more coughs (mean 8 versus 0.5 coughs in vehicle controls) ( Figure 1D ). As expected, nebulization of 0.4 M citric acid resulted in a mean of 12 coughs in 20 min ( Figure 1D ). Thus, an Mtb organic-phase extract induces cough in guinea pigs.",

            "text": "In Vitro Having established that the Mtb extract alone is sufficient to induce cough, we next investigated if the Mtb extract activates nociceptive neurons in cell culture using live cell imaging of intracellular calcium dynamics. When nociceptive neurons are triggered by nociceptive agonists, they demonstrate an increase in intracellular [Ca 2+ ] (Glaser et al., 2016) that can be quantified using Ca 2+ responsive dyes (Grynkiewicz et al., 1985; Iatridou et al., 1994; Kao et al., 2010) . To first determine if the Mtb extract can trigger neurons, we used the immortalized mouse embryonic dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cell line, MED17.11, which demonstrates properties of nociceptive neurons (Doran et al., 2015) . We loaded MED17.11 cells with the fluorescent semiquantitative Ca 2+ dye Fluo-4 and monitored fluorescence using live cell imaging after exposure to either vehicle control, Mtb extract, or capsaicin, a known transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) agonist (Caterina et al., 1997) . After treatment with either the positive control capsaicin or the Mtb extract, we observed maximum intracellular [Ca 2+ ] responses at 45 s, with the fluorescence returning to baseline by 90 s (Figure 2A; Video S1). We quantified the maximum change in fluorescence for each individual cell in the field of view using ImageJ and then averaged the response ( Figure 2B ). Not every cell responded to the Mtb extract or capsaicin, suggesting that the differentiated MED17.11 cells may not be a uniform population. However, in contrast to the vehicle control (DMSO), both Mtb extract and capsaicin triggered a significant increase in intracellular [Ca 2+ ] (Figures 2A and 2B) .",

Thus, to confirm our results with Fluo-4, we exposed Fura-2-loaded MED17.11 neurons to DMSO, the Mtb extract, and capsaicin and monitored intracellular [Ca 2+ ] over time for individual cells. Each compound was perfused onto the neurons and then removed by washing before the following compound was added ( Figure 2C ). While DMSO perfusion did not alter intracellular [Ca 2+ ], Mtb extract triggered a rise in intracellular [Ca 2+ ] at~45 s after exposure as can be seen in individual cell traces ( Figure 2C ), the average response ( Figure 2D ), and the quantified response for all cells ( Figure 2E ). The response of MED17.11 cells to Mtb extract was limited to capsaicin-responsive neurons, as capsaicin non-responsive cells did not demonstrate a significant increase in intracellular [Ca 2+ ] ( Figure S1 ). Furthermore, the Ca 2+ source was predominantly from intracellular Ca 2+ stores as there was no difference in the change in intracellular [Ca 2+ ] if MED17.11 neurons were bathed in Ca 2+ -containing or Ca 2+ -free media during activation by Mtb extract ( Figure S2 ). To determine whether the specificity of neuronal activation was restricted to the organic compartment, we tested if other Mtb compartments, including cell membrane extracts, cytosol fractions, soluble proteins from the cell wall, Triton X-114 soluble proteins, or secreted proteins can activate MED17.11 neurons. Only the total lipid compartment activated neurons (Table 1) .",

Because the cough reflex is mediated by vagal afferent nerves whose cell bodies are found within the nodose and jugular ganglia (Mazzone and Undem, 2016) , we also tested if primary nociceptive neurons isolated from murine nodose and jugular ganglia and loaded with Fura-2 could respond to Mtb extract. As with the primary mouse DRG neurons, exposure of mouse nodose/jugular ganglia neurons to the Mtb extract demonstrated a significant increase in intracellular [Ca 2+ ] entirely in capsaicin-responsive (TRPV1 + ) cells, in contrast to the DMSO control (Figures 2I-2K and S1). Thus, an organic Mtb extract is sufficient to activate a mouse nociceptive neuronal cell line, primary mouse DRG neurons, and primary mouse nodose/jugular ganglia neurons in vitro.",

            "text": "We next assessed if the nociceptive neuron response to the Mtb extract is evolutionarily conserved in humans by measuring the change in intracellular [Ca 2+ ] of primary human DRG neurons obtained from deceased donors (n = 2, one male, one female) after exposure to DMSO, Mtb extract, and capsaicin. Human nociceptive neurons were loaded with fluorescent Fluo-8AM dye and intracellular [Ca 2+ ] measured over time using live cell imaging ( Figures  2L-2N ). As with the mouse neurons, DMSO-treated human neurons had a minimal response both with respect to intracellular [Ca 2+ ] and number of cells responding. Exposure to Mtb extract generated a substantial increase in intracellular [Ca 2+ ] in multiple cells that were both capsaicin-responsive and non-responsive ( Figures 2L-2N and S1). Of the total cell population cultured from the human DRG, 56% in one donor and 100% in another donor of capsaicin-responsive (TRPV1 + ) neurons were activated by the Mtb extract (Table S1 ). Thus, an organic Mtb extract activates both mouse and human nociceptive neurons in vitro. mycobacterial organic extracts. We prepared organic extracts from a variety of mycobacterial species including virulent and non-virulent Mtb species, along with non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), and tested their ability to trigger increased intracellular [Ca 2+ ] in MED17.11 neurons. Of the extracts tested, neuronal activation overlapped with virulent bacteria in the Mtb complex ( Figure S3 ; Table 2 ). We noted that while the virulent Mtb H37Rv strain activated neurons, its attenuated derivative H37Ra (Steenken and Gardner, 1946; Steenken et al., 1934) did not (Table 2) . Because H37Ra has a mutation in the PhoP transcription factor that prevents it from producing the cell wall glycolipid SL-1 (Chesne-Seck et al., 2008), we obtained pure SL-1 and tested if it was sufficient to activate MED17.11 cells. Consistent with the lack of SL-1 in the H37Ra strain compared to H37Rv, pure SL-1-activated MED17.11 cells ( Figure 3A ). SL-1 is the most abundant sulfated glycolipid located in the outer membrane and cell wall of mycobacteria (Middlebrook et al., 1959) , and its presence is unique to pathogenic mycobacteria (Goren et al., 1974) . The structure of SL-1 includes a disaccharide trehalose-2-sulfate (T2S) core that is modified with four fatty acyl units (typically 2 hydroxypthioceranic acids, 1 pthioceranic acid, and 1 palmitic acid) (Layre et al., 2011) (Figure 3B, left) . In addition to SL-1, Mtb produces several similarly complex cell wall lipids such as trehalose monomycolate (TMM), trehalose dimycolate (TDM; also known as cord factor), phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM), and others (Figure 3B, center; Table 1 ). Thus, to assess the chemical specificity of the neuronal response to SL-1, we first determined if the response to SL-1 was saturable by performing a dose response experiment using MED17.11 neurons, yielding an EC 50 for SL-1 of 33 nM ( Figure 3C ). We next determined the ability of similarly complex molecules to activate nociceptive neurons by exposing MED17.11 cells to purified Mtb lipids. Of the tested lipids, only SL-1 activated neurons ( Figure 3A ; Table 1 ). In addition, only extracts from mycobacterial species that produce complex sulfated glycolipids were able to activate MED17.11 neurons including species of the Mtb complex (producers of SL-1) and M. avium (producer of a sulfated glycopeptidolipid but not SL-1) (Mougous et al., 2002a) (Figure S4 ; Table 2 ). Although M. smegmatis has been reported to produce small sulfated compounds (Mougous et al., 2002b; Rivera-Marrero et al., 2002) , it does not produce SL-1 (Mougous et al., 2002b; Rivera-Marrero et al., 2002) , and an organic extract from M. smegmatis did not activate MED17.11 neurons ( Figure S4 ; Table 2 ). Finally, mammalian cells including oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells produce a sulfated sphingolipid called sulfatide (3-O-sulfogalactosylceramide) ( Figure 3B , right) that comprises 4% of myelin lipids (Takahashi and Suzuki, 2012) . To determine if mammalian sulfatide could also activate nociceptive neurons and to further test the chemical specificity of neuronal activation, we exposed MED17.11 neurons to sulfatide and observed that neither sulfatide nor its non-sulfated analog galactocerebroside ( Figure 3B ) were able to trigger increased intracellular [Ca 2+ ] ( Figure 3D ). Thus, SL-1 alone can activate neurons and the neuronal response to SL-1 does not represent a generic response to non-sulfated mycobacterial cell wall glycolipids or sulfated monosaccharide lipids.",

Importantly, genetic deletion of stf0 in Mtb results in a failure to produce SL-1 (Mougous et al., 2004) . To determine if SL-1 synthesis was necessary for neuronal activation, we tested organic extracts from Mtb Erdman wild-type, Mtb ErdmanDstf0, and the complemented strain Mtb ErdmanDstf0::stf0 for their ability to activate MED17.11 neurons. While the organic extract from the Mtb ErdmanDstf0 strain failed to activate neurons, both the Mtb wild-type and Mtb ErdmanDstf0::stf0 extracts triggered neuronal activation ( Figure 3F ). We also verified that SL-1 was present in the wild-type and Mtb ErdmanDstf0::stf0 extracts, but not in the Mtb ErdmanDstf0 extract ( Figure S5 ). To confirm that the Mtb ErdmanDstf0 extract did not suppress the response of MED17.11 cells to another ligand, we exposed MED17.11 cells first to the Mtb ErdmanDstf0 extract followed by pure SL-1 and observed that MED17.11 retained their ability to respond ( Figure 3G ).",

As expected from prior studies (Converse et al., 2003; Kumar et al., 2007; Seeliger et al., 2012) , pathway mutants accumulated precursor molecules through mass action ( Figure S5 ). Interestingly, while an extract from the Mtb ErdmanDstf0 again failed to activate neurons, extracts from mutants in all subsequent steps retained a modest ability to activate neurons ( Figure 3H ). Thus, our genetic analysis demonstrated that while SL-1 precursors such as SL-659 and SL-1278 potentially activate neurons, T2S is the minimal molecule capable of neuronal activation in Mtb extracts. To confirm this result, we chemically synthesized T2S ( Figure S6 ) and tested if it could also activate neurons. Consistent with the genetic results ( Figure 3H ), while the non-sulfated precursor trehalose did not activate neurons, chemically synthesized T2S activated neurons ( Figure 3I ). Thus, synthesis of SL1 is both necessary and sufficient to activate MED17.11 neurons in vitro, and the organically synthesized precursor T2S also activates MED17.11 neurons.",

As before ( Figure 1D ), individual animals were exposed to each extract or compound on alternating days. Both the Mtb Erdman wildtype and the Mtb ErdmanDstf0::stf0 extracts induced a similar number of coughs as citric acid, while the SL-1-deficient Mtb ErdmanDstf0 extract did not induce coughing ( Figure 5A) . Furthermore, the response to the Mtb ErdmanDstf0 extract was comparable to the vehicle control ( Figure 5A ). To determine if SL-1 alone was a nociceptive, cough-inducing molecule, we exposed healthy guinea pigs to nebulized, pure SL-1 (250 mg/mL) and observed a significant cough response (Figure 5B) . Thus, the presence of SL-1 synthesis in the Mtb Erdman extract is necessary, and pure SL-1 alone is sufficient to induce cough in healthy guinea pigs.",

At day 0, the lung inocula were similar between the Mtb strains, and at 6 weeks, when the animals were beginning to show signs of disease, there was no difference in lung CFUs ( Figure 5C ). Likewise, there was no difference between the strains in lung pathology as assessed by histology ( Figure 5D ) and quantification of percent lung inflammation (Figure 5E ). However, at the 6-week time point, we observed an increase in coughing in both the Mtb Erdman wild-type infected and Mtb ErdmanDstf0::stf0 cohorts ( Figure 5F ). In contrast, except for one outlier animal in the Mtb ErdmanDstf0 cohort, the cough measurements in the Mtb ErdmanDstf0 cohort were comparable to uninfected controls ( Figure 5F ).

            "text": "In this study, we determined that both pulmonary Mtb infection and an organic extract from Mtb induce cough in guinea pigs, and an Mtb organic extract activates a neuronal cell line and primary neurons from both mice and humans. Through a combination of intracellular Ca 2+ imaging assays with mycobacterial extracts and isolated Mtb lipids, we identified SL-1 as the mycobacterial product responsible for neuronal activation. Genetic ablation of SL-1 synthesis in Mtb prevented neuronal activation and cough induction by Mtb extracts, and SL-1 alone was sufficient to induce cough in naive guinea pigs. Finally, guinea pigs infected with Mtb lacking SL-1 synthesis had a blunted cough response despite having a high bacterial burden and pulmonary pathology consistent with active tuberculosis. Together, our data demonstrate a previously undescribed role for Mtb SL-1 in nociceptive neuronal activation and cough induction. SL-1 was identified as a major component of the Mtb cell wall more than 60 years ago (Middlebrook et al., 1959) , but its activity has remained elusive despite the fact that SL-1 represents 1% of the dry weight of Mtb (Goren, 1970a) . Because virulence of Mtb strains correlated with the abundance of SL-1 (Goren et al., 1974) , it was proposed nearly 5 decades ago that SL-1 is an Mtb virulence factor. However, Mtb mutants that fail to produce SL-1 are not attenuated in mice Rousseau et al., 2003) or guinea pigs (Rousseau et al., 2003) although SL-1 deficiency enhances Mtb survival within human macrophages potentially through increased resistance to cationic peptides . Our findings are consistent with the in vivo evidence that SL-1 is not a classic virulence factor that enhances Mtb survival. Based on our cell culture and in vivo data, and the observation that only pathogenic mycobacteria produce SL-1 (this report and reviewed in Daffe et al., 2014; Minnikin et al., 2002) , we uncover a heretofore unrecognized function of SL-1 in nociceptive neuron activation and cough induction. Because cough is a major mechanism of Mtb transmission, we propose (legend continued on next page)",

In addition to Mtb, other mycobacterial species interact with the nervous system through production of complex molecules. For example, M. ulcerans, the etiologic agent of Buruli ulcer, causes peripheral anesthesia through the direct activity of a polyketide known as mycolactone (George et al., 1999) on peripheral nerves (Marion et al., 2014) . To date, mycolactone has not been isolated from Mtb. Conversely, M. ulcerans does not produce SL-1 owing to genomic loss of the pks2 locus (Stinear et al., 2007) , suggesting that each species has evolved unique neuromodulatory molecules to facilitate its own lifestyle. Indeed, neuromodulatory molecules have also been observed in gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. Both lipopolysaccharide from E. coli (Ochoa-Cortes et al., 2010) and formyl peptides and alpha-hemolysin from Staphylococcus aureus (Chiu et al., 2013) activate nociceptive neurons to trigger a pain response and inhibit innate immunity (Baral et al., 2018; Pinho-Ribeiro et al., 2018) . Thus, direct neuronal engagement by bacterial molecules to either enhance or suppress cellular responses reflects a common virulence strategy of pathogens.",

We observed a direct relationship between the presence of a complex sulfolipid and neuronal activation. Notably, in the matched pair of virulent (H37Rv) and attenuated (H37Ra) strains, SL-1 synthesis is lacking due to a mutation in PhoP (Chesne-Seck et al., 2008) , a phenotype that is corroborated in Mtb mutants of the PhoPR two-component system (Gonzalo Asensio et al., 2006; Walters et al., 2006) . Likewise, an extract from M. bovis did not increase neuronal [Ca 2+ ] and did not have SL-1, in accordance with the observations that M. bovis, like H37Ra, is also mutated in the PhoP/PhoR two component system (Gonzalo-Asensio et al., 2014) . While children typically develop either cervical lymphadenopathy or gastrointestinal disease when infected with M. bovis owing to ingestion of contaminated dairy products (Dankner et al., 1993) , primary pulmonary disease occurs in~50% of adults, in line with probable airborne acquisition either from infected livestock or humans (Dankner et al., 1993; Vayr et al., 2018) . Because cough is a feature of pulmonary tuberculosis disease caused by M. bovis in both livestock and humans, it is likely that molecules other than sulfolipids are involved in M. bovis-mediated cough and transmission. In contrast to M. bovis and Mtb H37Ra, an organic extract from the NTM species M. avium also activated neurons, consistent with its known production of a complex sulfated glycopeptidolipid (Mougous et al., 2002a) . Chronic cough is a feature of M. avium infection in immunocompromised individuals such as those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Daley, 2017) , cystic fibrosis (Martiniano et al., 2016) , and Lady Windermere syndrome (Reich and Johnson, 1992) . While the general consensus is that most primary pulmonary NTM infections are due to exposure to environmental reservoirs (Daley and Griffith, 2010; Griffith et al., 2007; Jeon, 2019) , there are conflicting data on the possibility of human-to-human transmission of NTM (Bryant et al., 2013 (Bryant et al., , 2016 Doyle et al., 2019) . Thus, as with M. bovis, M. avium induced cough and possible airborne transmission occur in an SL-1 independent manner, although for M. avium its sulfated glycopeptidolipid may have an analogous activity.",

            "text": "In addition to Mtb, many viral and bacterial organisms such as measles virus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, influenza virus, Bordetella pertussis, and Mycoplasma pneumonia have cough as a primary symptom and are transmitted via airborne or droplet particles. In the case of airway viruses, it has been proposed that infections can sensitize cough-evoking sensory nerves through upregulation of receptors involved in cough hypersensitivity (Abdullah et al., 2014; Omar et al., 2017) , induction of inflammatory cytokines, leukotrienes, and neuropeptides (Dicpinigaitis, 2014; Footitt and Johnston, 2009) , and excess production of airway mucous (Nadel, 2013) . Some infections can also cause cough after pathogen clearance. Such post-infectious cough states are similar to pain responses in other tissues that are mediated by nociceptive sensory neurons such that pain signaling commonly outlasts the presence of the original stimulus (Price and Inyang, 2015; Reichling and Levine, 2009 ). Thus, post-infectious cough might be similar to a chronic pain state where there is ongoing afferent nociceptive input for weeks or months after the injury has healed. Like viral pathogens, Mtb also induces production of a variety of eicosanoids and leukotrienes such as leukotriene B(4) (Tobin et al., 2010) that can function as an agonist of the TRPV1 cough receptor (Koskela et al., 2012) . In addition, extracellular ATP (eATP), a damage-associated molecular pattern (Schmid and Evans, 2019 ) that can modulate host immunity to Mtb infection (Lammas et al., 1997; Molloy et al., 1994) is a ligand for the purinergic ion channel family (P2X). As the P2X3 receptor has been identified as a cough receptor and possible drug target for chronic cough (Abdulqawi et al., 2015; Bonvini and Belvisi, 2017; Garceau and Chauret, 2019) , it is also possible that eATP could activate neuronal P2X3 receptors during Mtb infection. In this study, animals infected with an Mtb strain deficient only in SL-1 synthesis had significantly reduced cough. While we did not measure eicosanoids, leukotrienes or eATP in the lungs of infected animals, overall lung inflammation was equal between wild-type and mutant Mtb infected guinea pigs. Furthermore, our observation that pure SL-1 and wild-type Mtb, but not MtbDstf0, organic extract rapidly induced cough in naive guinea pigs suggests that the mechanism of cough is through direct activation of a neuronal receptor by SL-1 rather than indirectly through production of a secondary metabolite. Thus, we identify SL-1 as a pathogenic bacterial product with cough-inducing activity.",

Because guinea pigs and humans demonstrate a similar cough reflex to noxious agonists (Canning, 2008; Laude et al., 1993) , SL-1 may also induce cough in humans. Although a link between Mtb virulence and the production of sulfolipids has previously been suggested (Goren et al., 1974) , whether SL-1 is required for Mtb transmission remains unknown (Shiloh, 2016) . Among the Mtb strains we tested, the HN878 W-Beijing strain is considered to be the most transmissible based on epidemiologic data (Karmakar et al., 2019; Kato-Maeda et al., 2010) , and in our hands it produces SL-1 like the virulent laboratory strains Mtb Erdman, CDC1551, and H37Rv. Because our mass spectrometry analysis was qualitative, we are unable to correlate epidemiologic transmission data with SL-1 production. We are currently developing methods to quantify SL-1 in mycobacterial extracts using mass spectrometry as well as methods to safely test Mtb transmission between experimental animals in large scale. Future work will test the impact of SL-1 and cough in the transmission of Mtb as well as the role of putative SL-1 receptors in these processes.",

These findings provide new directions not only in the study of Mtb pathogenesis and transmission, but also a framework for studies on other respiratory pathogens spread by the airborne route. Identification of unique, coughinducing, pathogen-derived molecules and their host receptors could lead to the development of novel therapeutics that mitigates the spread of disease. For Mtb, in the absence of an effective vaccine to prevent disease acquisition by naive humans, a cough-inhibiting adjuvant therapy has the potential to significantly reduce transmission with major global health implications.",

The remaining water was removed via lyophilization and the resulting mixture contained the product and TFA salt. The TFA salt was removed via a double resin exchange procedure. The obtained mixture was dissolved in water, and added to the Dowex 50WX8 resin (H + form, 10 equiv) in a scintillation vial. After stirring for 2 hr, the resin was filtered off and dried via lyophilization overnight. The product was again dissolved in water along with the Dowex 50WX8 resin (Na + form, 10 equiv). The mixture was stirred for 2 hr. After filtration off the resin, the desired product trehalose-2-sulfate (T2S) ",
