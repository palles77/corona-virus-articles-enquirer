            "text": "Programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1PRF) is tightly regulated by messenger RNA (mRNA) sequences and structures in expressing two or more proteins with precise ratios from a single mRNA. Using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) between (Cy5)EF-G and (Cy3)tRNA Lys , we studied the translational elongation dynamics of -1PRF in the Escherichia coli dnaX gene, which contains three frameshifting signals: a slippery sequence (A AAA AAG), a Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence and a downstream hairpin. The frameshift promoting signals mostly impair the EF-G-catalyzed translocation step of the two tRNA Lys and the slippery codons from the A-and P-sites. The hairpin acts as a road block slowing the translocation rate. The upstream SD sequence together with the hairpin promotes dissociation of futile EF-G and thus causes multiple EF-G driven translocation attempts. A slippery sequence also helps dissociation of the EF-G by providing alternative base-pairing options. These results indicate that frameshifting takes place during the repetitive ribosomal conformational changes associated with EF-G dissociation upon unsuccessful translocation attempts of the second slippage codon from the A-to the P-sites.",

            "text": "Ribosomal frameshifting is programed in some messenger RNAs such that a ribosome can slip on a messenger RNA (mRNA) and start translating a new sequence of amino acids (1) (2) (3) (4) . Programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1PRF) is utilized in many RNA viral systems, including HIV-1, to express two or more proteins from a single mRNA (5, 6) . The Escherichia coli (E. coli) dnaX gene is a well-known -1PRF model system with high efficiencies in the range of \u223c50 to \u223c80% (7, 8) . Two DNA polymerase sub-units ( , \u2425 ) are programed in the 0 and -1 reading frames (7) . Many biochemical studies showed that such efficient -1PRF is promoted by three mRNA signals in the dnaX gene; a hexanucleotide slippery sequence (A AAA AAG) coding two lysine codons, a stimulatory hairpin structure, and a Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence (8) (9) (10) . The distances between the signals are crucial for the frameshifting efficiency. For the most efficient frameshifting, the signals are positioned in a way that the slippery sequence is placed on the ribosomal peptidyl (P)-and aminoacyl (A)-sites while the downstream hairpin is at the ribosomal mRNA entrance channel. At the same time, the upstream SD sequence base pairs with 16S ribosomal RNA near the ribosomal exit (E) site.",

            "text": "Slow translational elongation rates in the presence of -1PRF signals are well known and widely accepted as an effect of the downstream hairpin structure (1) (2) (3) , as the ribosome needs to unwind the hairpin structure to translocate (3, 11) . A translational elongation cycle includes a peptidyl transfer reaction upon delivery of a selected aminoacyl-tRNA by elongation factor-Tu (EF-Tu) as a ternary complex (TC) (EF-Tu(GTP)-aminoacyl-tRNA) (12) . In the next step, deacylated-and peptidyl-tRNAs translocate from the ribosomal P-and A-sites to the E-and P-sites and the ribosomal complex advances by three nucleotides toward the 3end of the mRNA. Translocation is accomplished via multistep large-scale conformational changes catalyzed by elongation factor-G (EF-G) (13) (14) (15) (16) . Spontaneous ribosomal conformational changes include rotation of the ribosomal subunits (50S, 30S) relative to each other, L1 stalk closure and formation of hybrid tRNAs (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) . In the hybrid state, the anticodon stem loops of the two tRNAs are located at the P-and A-sites in the 30S small subunit while their acceptor arms are located at the E-and P-sites in the 50S large subunit (P/E, A/P). Further structural studies showed that translocation of the codon:anticodon base-pairs through the 30S subunit involves many more intermediates along with EF-G binding and GTP hydrolysis (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) . EF-Gbound intermediates include swiveling of the head of the 30S subunit and chimeric hybrid tRNAs (pe/E, ap/P or ap/ap), where the two tRNAs are in transit toward translo-cation direction keeping partial contacts with both P-and E-, and A-and P-sites in each subunits. (21, (25) (26) (27) (28) . Along with the swiveling of the 30S head domain and chimeric hybrid tRNAs, the mRNA is also pulled by 2-3 nucleotides toward the translocation direction (27) . Complete translocation is achieved with back rotation of the 30S head domain to the un-swivelled position along with dissociation of EF-G, forming a POST complex, where the two subunits are in a non-rotated state and the tRNAs are in E/E and P/P states (21) (22) (23) . A recent smFRET study suggested that a rapid reversible head domain movement is involved in the final stage of the translocation as a rate-determining step (29) .",

Multiple EF-G binding and dissociation events on the ribosomal hybrid state were implied before a successful translocation in the context of -1PRF signals (30, 31) . Both studies suggested that frameshifting takes place during the translocation process of the second codon of the slippery sequence. Another single molecule study on the -1PRF of the dnaX gene by Chen et al., where they simultaneously probed ribosomal inter-subunit rotation and the events of EF-G or tRNA accommodations, showed that a downstream hairpin structure can induce a non-canonical rotated state during or after translocation of the first codon of the slippery sequence to the P-site (32) . Multiple EF-G bindings were observed and proposed to be wasted for back-rotation of the ribosomal complex to relieve the non-canonical state. Frameshifting was proposed to take place during the back-rotation attempts by EF-G binding; accommodation of the next amino acyl-tRNA on the second codon of the slippery sequence takes place on the already frameshifted frame. The proposed timing of the frameshifting by Chen et al. is after accommodation of the first codon, but before accommodation of the second codon of the slippery sequence.",

In the mRNA construct, the SD sequence plays a role as an initiating signal as well as -1PRF signal. The first five codons encode an amino acid sequence of MVKKF, where the tandem lysines are coded in the slippery sequence. Frameshifting by -1 on the slippery sequence results in translating different amino acid sequence (MVKKV\u223c) and termination at -1 stop codon. In order to examine the effect of each signal on the frameshifting efficiency and the ribosomal dynamics, we constructed mutated mRNAs by deleting the hairpin ( hp), mutating the SD sequence (mSD: AGGGAG \u2192AUAUCA) and mutating the slippery sequence (mSS: A AAA AAG \u2192 G AAG AAG). As both AAA and AAG are read by tRNA Lys , the mSS still encodes for two consecutive lysines, but is not slippery any more. Mass spectrometry analysis of the in vitro translated products from each mRNA construct showed that FS efficiency drops to 50% by mutating SD, 20% by deleting hairpin, and to 2% by mutating the slippery sequence to be non-slippery (Supplementary Figure   S1 ). These changes are consistent with reported bulk biochemical studies (7, 10) . The results confirm again that the slippery sequence is essential to the frameshifting and that the hairpin is a critical promoting signal. Also, our data show that the SD sequence clearly plays an important role on frameshifting, although it is not as critical as the hairpin.",

Once the translocation of the first lysine codon of the slippery sequence (Tl1) took place, the signal of the Cy3 from the (Cy3)tRNA Lys at the P-site displayed stable constant values until Cy3 photo-bleached ( Figure 2B , upper trace).

The same high FRET (\u223c0.9) excursion followed by Cy3 intensity increase was observed as described above, indicating the first translocation (Tl1) took place via binding of the (Cy5)EF-G (EF-G1) as in the experiments delivering (Cy5)EF-G alone. The Tl1 event was followed by another FRET excursions with much less intense Cy5 signals (denoted as EF-G2 by the blue arrows in Figure  2B , bottom trace) resulting in \u223c0.3 FRET values ( Figure  2D ). In contrast to the EF-G1 binding that mostly occurred only once for the Tl1 event, multiple EF-G2 binding events were observed before Cy3 signal disappeared. It is likely that the \u223c0.3 FRET state occurs between the (Cy3)tRNA Lys at the P-site and (Cy5)EF-G accommodated near the Asite. The second round translocation attempts were ongoing by accommodation of the (Cy5)EF-G (EF-G2 for Tl2) after peptidyl transfer from the first (Cy3)tRNA Lys in the P-site to the second tRNA Lys in the A-site (Figure 2A ). The translocation of the (Cy3)tRNA Lys to the E-site will be followed by release of the (Cy3)tRNA Lys from the ribosomal Figure 1 . The dnaX messenger RNA (mRNA) construct. The dnaX mRNA contains Escherichia coli dnaX frameshifting signals; an SD sequence, a slippery sequence and a downstream hairpin structure. An initiation codon (AUG) and two stop codons (UGA) for in-frame and -1-frame are encoded. The single SD sequence plays two roles as an initiation and a frameshifting promoting signals. The slippery sequence codes for two consecutive lysines. After the slippery sequence, -1 frame codes for different codons. in vitro translated products from the dnaX mRNA showed 84% frameshifting efficiency. Deleting the hairpin in the box reduces the frameshifting efficiency to 20% and mutating the SD sequence to AUAUCA (mSD) to 50%. Mutating the slippery sequence to a non-slippery G AAG AAG sequence, which is still coding for two lysines, reduced the frameshifting efficiency to 2%. complex, which can be monitored by the disappearance of Cy3 signals (Tl2, Figure 2B , bottom trace).",

In order to minimize photo-bleaching effect on the measurements of the translocation times, low excitation energy (4 mW) was used with longer averaging time (100 ms/frame). Considerably decreased reaction times were observed between Tl1 and Tl2 (31 \u00b1 3 versus 20 \u00b1 1 s, Figure  3B ), while slight changes were observed in the reaction time for Tl1 to first EF-G2 (4.7 \u00b1 0.2 versus 5.2 \u00b1 0.7 s) and the EF-G2 dwell times (0.44 \u00b1 0.01 versus 0.51 \u00b1 0.01 s) (Supplementary Figure S5 ). The results suggest that the duration between the Tl1 and Tl2 mostly corresponds to the reaction time for the second round of translocation (Tl2), by which the first and second codon of the slippery sequence, basepairing with (Cy3)tRNA Lys and peptidyl-tRNA Lys , translocate from the P-and A-sites to the E-and P-sites, respec-tively. Release of the (Cy3)tRNA Lys from the E-site afterward would result in abolishing the fluorescence signal. Indeed, the whole durations of the Cy3 fluorescence signals were shorter in the case of delivering (Cy5)EF-G and TC(K) together than the photo-bleaching time ( pb ) in each experimental condition ( pb = \u223c90 s for 100 ms/frame, \u223c60 s for 35 ms/frame,).",

Considering that there was no such fluctuations in the Cy3 intensity for the reactions with EF-G only in the absence of TC(K) (POST-K 1 *, Figure 2A , upper trace), the fluctuations of the Cy3 intensity likely correspond to a spontaneous conformational change of the ribosomal complex (PRE-K 1 *K 2 ) at an early stage of translocation process such as formation of the hybrid state (16, (18) (19) (20) , by which the Cy3 labeled acceptor end of the deacylated (Cy3)tRNA Lys at the P-site in the 50S large subunit experiences another environmental changes.

In accordance with such a big change of the frameshifting efficiency, there were several significant changes of the ribosomal dynamics upon deleting the hair- pin. First of all, the translocation of the hp mRNA took place at significantly faster rates for the both first and second slippery Lys codons as compared to those of the dnaX mRNA (RT to Tl1: 1.4 \u00b1 0.1 versus 2.8 \u00b1 0.1 s, Tl1 to Tl2: 8.5 \u00b1 0.4 versus 25 \u00b1 2 s, Figure 4B ). In consideration of almost no change on the first EF-G2 binding time after Tl1 event (Tl1 to first EF-G2: 4.6 \u00b1 0.3 versus 4.9 \u00b1 0.2 s, Figure 4B) , the difference on the second translocation times becomes more severe. Second, the complete translocation took place with mostly a single EF-G binding event for both rounds of translocation ( Figure 5A ). Finally, the dwell times of the bound EF-G were more than twice as short (e.g. EF-G2: 0.17 \u00b1 0.01 versus 0.42 \u00b1 0.02 s, Figure 5B ). All the results strongly suggest that the hairpin itself indeed hinders the translocation and causes consumptions of multiple number of EF-Gs, in agreement with a previous smFRET study using a FRET pair between the L1 stalk and P-site tRNA (30) .",

Also a successful translocation of the second Lys codon (Tl2) took place via fluctuations of the Cy3 intensity and multiple EF-G bindings as observed in the dnaX frameshifting mRNA ( Figure  4A ). However, faster Tl2 was observed on the mSS mRNA (17 \u00b1 3 versus 25 \u00b1 2 s, Figure 4B ). Interestingly, the average dwell times of the bound EF-G were prolonged more than twice on both codons compared to those of the dnaX (EF-G1 dwells: 0.82 \u00b1 0.05 versus 0.35 \u00b1 0.01 s and EF-G2 dwells: 0.88 \u00b1 0.03 versus 0.42 \u00b1 0.02 s, Figure 5B ). Also a smaller number of EF-G2 bindings were observed for the Tl2 (Figure 5A, bottom) . These observations suggest that SS helps dissociation of the bound EF-G to reset the ribosomal complex for another translocation attempt by allowing the ribosomal complex to explore other base-pair interactions.

It is a distinct difference from the Tl2 process on the dnaX and mSS constructs, which showed multiple EF-G binding and dissociation events until the successful translocation. The dnaX and mSS constructs contain both the upstream SD sequence and the downstream hairpin, while the mSD and hp lacks either the hairpin or the SD sequence ( Figure 1 ). However, other than the single EF-G2 bindings for the Tl2, there was no similarity between the results on the mSD and hp. Translocation rates on the mSD were as slow as those on the dnaX ( Figure 4B ). But, EF-G2 dwell time of the mSD was more than twice as long as that of the dnaX (0.86 \u00b1 0.05 versus 0.42 \u00b1 0.02 s), while EF-G1 dwell times are almost the same (0.30 \u00b1 0.01 versus 0.35 \u00b1 0.01 s) ( Figure 5B ). The results imply that SD sequences promote dissociation of the bound, futile EF-G, especially during the second Lys codon translocation process. These observations suggest that the SD sequence actually aids resetting the ribosomal complex from a non-canonical conformation formed upon encountering a downstream secondary structure. Other noteworthy changes upon mutating the SD are a slower peptidyl transfer rate (Tl1 to first EF-G2: 10.8 \u00b1 1.0 versus 4.9 \u00b1 0.2 s, Figure 4) and a lower success rate of the complete translocation (Supplementary Table S1 ). These observation indicate that SD has more diverse effects on an overall elongation cycle of the second Lys codon rather than only on the translocation step.",

Especially, a bulk FRET study between the ribosome and EF-G by Caliskan et al. suggested that frameshifting promoting secondary structure in the mRNA hinders translocation step of the two slippage codons by impairing the back-rotation of the 30S head domain and dissociation of EF-G (31) . Their observation of the prolonged EF-G dwells by bulk study can be explained by our results showing multiple EF-G binding events for the slow translocation of the second Lys codon, since greater number of EF-G binding events results in longer dwells on average. In another single molecule fluorescence study, Chen et al. employed a zero-mode waveguide to directly observe binding events of (Cy5)EF-G or (Cy3)/(Cy5)tRNA while monitoring the inter-subunit rotation with a FRET pair of (Cy3B)30S and (BHQ)50S ribosomal subunits (32) . They also observed that multiple EF-G bindings were required during or after translocation of the first Lys codon to resolve a long lived inter-subunit rotated state. Thus, the proposed timing of the frameshifting in their study is prior to the peptidyl transfer to the second Lys codon of the slippery sequence, unlike our results. The different results might be due to different experimental conditions including different labeling schemes. Further study will be required for more systematic comparisions between the experimental conditions that regulating the ribosomal dynamics and thus the frameshifting pathways.",

            "text": "Translocation of the PRE programmed with mutated SD (mSD) took place slowly as in the dnaX-PRE complexes, indicating that a hairpin itself can be a strong road block without the SD sequence. However, multiple EF-G binding events were not observed for the mSD-PRE complexes during the long period of translocation process. Interestingly, multiple EF-G bindings were only observed for the PREribosomal complexes with mRNAs containing both a SD and a hairpin (dnaX, mSS). Multiple shorter EF-G binding events in the presence of SD shows that the SD sequence works with the hairpin to promote EF-G dissociation. Unresolved SD-rRNA base pairings may push the ribosomal complexes backward such as back-swiveling of the 30S head domain along with the mRNA, during which trapped futile EF-G dissociation is also facilitated. Once reset, the ribosomal complexes are now open for another translocation attempt. A single-molecule force study by our research group inferred that a trapped ribosome on the slippery sequence between the upstream SD-sequence and the downstream hairpin may be able to move back and forth by one or two nucleotides (41) . These observations also support our proposal, as such ribosomal movement can correspond to the reversible swiveling of the 30S head domain accompanying 2-3 nucleotide movements of mRNA (27) The low success rate on translocation of the mSD may also mean that the resetting of the ribosomal complex with EF-G dissociation is a more active way to promote translocation on the slippery sequence surrounded by the SD and hairpin. Without the active conformational resetting processes, the ribosomal complex might be stalled in an inactive form such as a non-canonical rotated state (32, 42) . Therefore, SD sequence actively stimulate frameshifting by promoting such dynamic ribosomal conformational changes. Our proposal explains why there were no correlations between frameshifting efficiency and the pausing extent (43, 44) or the thermodynamic or mechanical stabilities of the downstream secondary structures (5, 45) , but the conformational plasticity of the structure was related to the frameshifting efficiency (5, 45) .",

An upstream SD sequence promotes dissociation of futile EF-G bindings and thus enables multiple attempts of EF-G catalyzed translocations. A slippery sequence provides base-pairing options in out-of-frame as well as in-frame sequences, which also helps expediting EF-G dissociation. Our results indicate that frameshifting takes place during the translocation process of the two slippage codons from the A-and P-to the P-and E-sites. More specifically, frameshifting takes place along with dissociation of futile EF-G, which facilitates ribosomal conformational resetting process involving back-swiveling of the 30S head domain. More chances of frameshifting can be produced upon repetitive ribosomal conformational changes associated with each EF-G dissociation. We find that most efficient frameshifting can be achieved by dynamic conformational changes during the translocation process.",
