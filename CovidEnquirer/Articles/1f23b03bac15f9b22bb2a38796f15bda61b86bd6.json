Objective: To study MxA protein levels in healthy state and during respiratory virus infection of young children in an observational prospective cohort. Study design: Blood samples and nasal swabs were collected from 153 and 77 children with and without symptoms of respiratory infections, respectively. Blood MxA protein levels were measured by an enzyme immunoassay and PCR methods were used for the detection of respiratory viruses in nasal swabs. Results: Respiratory viruses were detected in 81% of symptomatic children. They had higher blood MxA protein levels (median [interquartile range]) than asymptomatic virus-negative children (695 [345-1370] g/L vs. 110 [55-170] g/L; p < 0.001). Within asymptomatic children, no significant difference was observed in MxA responses between virus-positive and virus-negative groups. A cut-off level of 175 g/L had 92% sensitivity and 77% specificity for a symptomatic respiratory virus infection. Rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, influenza virus, coronavirus, and human metapneumovirus infections were associated with elevated MxA responses. Asymptomatic virus-negative children vaccinated with a live virus vaccine had elevated MxA protein levels (240 [120-540] g/L), but significantly lower than children with an acute respiratory infection, who had not received vaccinations (740 [350-1425] g/L; p < 0.001). Conclusion: Blood MxA protein levels are increased in young children with symptomatic respiratory virus infections, including rhinovirus infections. MxA is an informative general marker for the most common acute virus infections.",

The existence and duration of symptoms (rhinorrhoea, cough, wheezing, fever, and other symptoms) and the findings of clinical examination were uniformly documented. Fever was defined as body temperature \u226538 \u2022 C per rectum or \u226537.5 \u2022 C from axilla or tympanic membrane. Families were encouraged to visit the study clinic when children experienced symptoms of RTI.

In vitro and animal experiments show that RV infection is able to induce type I IFN response [28] and thus it would be expected that MxA or other IFN-inducible proteins would also be induced. However, an earlier flow cytometric analysis from isolated blood lymphocytes showed only a weak MxA response to RV [12] . The patients were adults and the severity of infection, or the presence of fever, were not specified. The discrepant results may be explained by the different clinical setup, different methodology used, and apparently a milder RV infection in adults [8, 12] .

Within the group of asymptomatic virus-negative children, the MxA levels were higher in children vaccinated with a live virus vaccine as compared to children without preceding vaccinations (240 [120-540] g/L vs. 85 [50-130] g/L; p 0.001), but the MxA level was not elevated in children vaccinated with inactivated vaccines (75 [50-135] g/L; p 0.85). Children with an acute respiratory infection, who had not received vaccinations (n = 103), had significantly higher MxA levels (740 [350-1425] g/L) than asymptomatic virus-negative children vaccinated with a live virus vaccine (p < 0.001).",

A single case with adenovirus is not presented.systematic detection of 14 respiratory viruses by PCR was performed, including HMPV, CoV, and HBoV, which have not been assessed in similar studies earlier. The MxA response varied according to the causative virus. In RSV, PIV, Flu and HMPV the disease was associated with high MxA levels while in RV and CoV infections MxA levels remained at a lower but yet clearly higher levels as compared to samples obtained from patients suffering from asymptomatic or non-viral infections. Febrile infections were associated with higher MxA levels as compared to non-febrile infections reflecting a stronger systemic immune response. Our data indicate that in children, most of the common respiratory viruses are capable of inducing an efficient IFN response, which readily correlates with elevated expression of blood cell MxA protein.Asymptomatic virus infections are common in children especially during the epidemic seasons with reported prevalences of upFig. 4.
