Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE1) insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism was previously reported to show association with the adult respiratory distress syndrome, which is also thought to play a key role in damaging the lung tissues in SARS cases. This time, the polymorphism was genotyped in 44 Vietnamese SARS cases, with 103 healthy controls who had had a contact with the SARS patients and 50 controls without any contact history. SARS cases were divided into either non-hypoxemic or hypoxemic groups. Despite the small sample size, the frequency of the D allele was significantly higher in the hypoxemic group than in the non-hypoxemic group (p = 0.013), whereas there was no significant difference between the SARS cases and controls, irrespective of a contact history. ACE1 might be one of the candidate genes that influence the progression of pneumonia in SARS.",

Pathological analysis of the lung at autopsy in cases of SARS revealed diffuse alveolar damage, characterized by desquamation of pneumocytes, inflammatory infiltrates, edema, and hyaline-membrane formation [6] [7] [8] .

ACE is a prototype of angiotensin converting enzyme, which is distinct from its human homologue ACE2 also known as a SARS receptor [15] . It is well known that ACE is rich in microvascular endothelium and is likely involved in angiopathy of the lung. The human ACE gene on chromosome 17q23 consists of 26 exons, and has insertion (I) or deletion (D) of a 287-bp Alu repeat sequence in intron 16 [16] . Although the function of this polymorphism remains unclear, the genotype or allele frequency of this polymorphism has been often reported to be associated with pathological status including the development of myocardial infarction and deterioration of the renal function in diabetes mellitus in humans [17] . In the present study, we explored the possibility of this polymorphism, based on the assumption that it might be associated with progression of SARS in Vietnamese cases.",

All the infection spread originally from one case from Hong Kong within 2 months. It implies that natural course of nosocomial infection of SARS was observed in Vietnam. This was an unfortunate event but was a major advantage for us to assess genetic risk factors, minimizing other confounding factors. Moreover, the study population was limited to be Vietnamese ethnicity for genetic analysis. Questionnaires taken by trained interviewers and chest radiographs of all cases in this study, and clinical records of most of the cases were available to evaluate clinical status in detail. As a result, 44 out of 54 accessible cases of ethnic of Vietnamese were enrolled and this achieved high coverage of this study.

This pathological status is characterized by increased permeability of alveolar-capillary barrier, which consists of two separate barriers, microvascular endothelium and alveolar epithelium [25] . When these barriers are damaged, the permeability of alveolar-capillary barrier increases and protein-rich edema fluids flow into alveolar spaces from blood vessel [25] . A previous report indicated that AT-I increased vascular permeability in Rat [26] . Another report showed that AT-II induces apoptosis of human alveolar epithelial cells [27] . The degree of epithelial injury seems to influence the outcome of ARDS [25] . The serum ACE levels of individuals who have genotype DD are almost twice as high as that of genotype II [16] . It is conceivable that D allele might influence the activity of renin-angiotensin system via ele- vation of serum or local ACE level, and then this may lead to damage of endothelium or epithelium of the lung. In this study, neither higher age nor underlying disease was found to be risk factors for hypoxemia in SARS. One of the reasons might be that SARS cases in Vietnam were mostly nosocomial infection among relatively young medical staff members who did not have underlying diseases. This situation may be different from ones in other countries. However, as described above, the number of cases that had specific underlying diseases, which may influence the prognosis of SARS, was too few to conclude the role of underlying disease as a risk factor in our cases.",

It would promote further studies to clarify genetic predisposition of infection, development or progression of SARS in the near future in other countries where a larger number of cases were reported.",
