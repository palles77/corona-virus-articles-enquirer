            "text": "Fetal thrombotic vasculopathy (FTV) is a vascular thrombotic condition causing obstruction of arteries and veins in the fetal circulation of the placenta, resulting in ischemic changes in the villi peripheral to the obstruction. When sufficiently extensive, FTV may cause a reduction in functional placental reserve or in other cases may be associated with additional thrombotic or thromboembolic events in the somatic vessels of the fetus itself. When extensive, the former condition can lead to fetal growth restriction or stillbirth, whereas the latter may result in infarcts of various fetal structures, such as the brain, kidney, or, rarely, an extremity, such as an arm or leg. As with intravascular clotting in general, causal factors of FTV include a combination of the triad of stasis (by compression of cord or aberrant vessels); a thrombophilic state, both genetic (eg, protein S or factor V Leiden) and acquired (anticardiolipin antibody and so forth); and vascular injury (inflammatory and localized compression). The most serious outcomes include growth restriction, neurologic injury, and perinatal death. Maternal thrombophilic state (occurs equally in nonthrombophilic mothers) including 1 case of maternal gestational diabetes and 2 newborns small for gestational age; the remaining 9 mothers and newborns were clinically normal. 1 In a selected series of 2910 placentas submitted for clinical indications from a total of 19674 deliveries, 183 placentas (6%) had histologic FTV. 2 ",

            "text": "Before delivery, FTV is clinically silent, with no predelivery warning of its presence. As discussed previously, FTV occurs more frequently in placentas selected for clinical study than in unselected pregnancies, but the factors involved in selection of placentas for pathologic study are diverse and nonspecific: maternal hypertension and diabetes mellitus, fetal growth restriction, abnormal fetal heart rate during labor, and so forth. Ultrasound and other imaging techniques do not detect FTV. When there seems to be some sort of fetal distress during labor, there is no way to suggest that the actual cause of these symptoms is FTV until the placenta is examined. In most cases, when FTV is identified on placental examination, the newborn usually appears well, there are no subsequent clinical abnormalities in the nursery, and the newborn goes home on schedule. Especially in more extensive or severe cases, FTV is associated significantly with neonatal encephalopathy, 3 cerebral palsy, 4 intrauterine growth restriction, 5 stillbirth, oligohydramnios, and fetal cardiac anomalies. 6 Cerebral infarcts may be the most common specific cerebral lesion associated with placental FTV. 7 Other fetal structural anomalies attributed to vascular disruption (including thrombi) include porencephaly, cerebral infarcts, bowel atresias, gastroschisis, unilateral renal absence, cleft lip or palate, and transverse limb or digit reduction. 8 ",

The villi clustered at left are avascular and hyalinzed, in contrast to some adjacent normally perfused villi at right. The fetus associated with this placenta experienced intrauterine death just 36 hours before delivery. There were both old and recent thrombi in the fetal vessels, and multiple clusters of hyalinized avascular villi were present in this placenta. The intravascular clotting injury in this placenta began many days, possibly even weeks, before the fetal death. No symptoms were detected during the course of this carefully monitored pregnancy (hematoxylin-eosin, original magnification \u00c2200).",

In contrast, the clusters of avascular villi of FTV form well-circumscribed clusters, surrounded by normally perfused villi.

Thus, FTV tends to reduce placental function progressively without causing perceptible injury until the cumulative effects of reduced placental reserve and the stress of labor onset combine to cause heart rate abnormalities, such as bradycardia, fetal distress, and even late perinatal stillbirth. It should be emphasized that FTV, as well as other pathologic processes that affect the placenta, commonly begin long before delivery, but produce no symptoms, and, finally, as injury progresses, may produce nonspecific stress related alterations, such as bradycardia, occur at onset of labor. Often it is at this stressful time, hours before delivery, that the reduced placental function finally causes acute injury to the brain, kidneys, and other organs of the fetus, even though it is the older placental pathologic lesions that initiated the chain of events that culminated in the serious injuries that the newborn must face after delivery.",

The largest fetal vessels at the chorionic plate appeared dilated and congested. The cord had a single umbilical artery and was tightly wrapped multiple times about the left leg of the fetus, resulting in compression marks on the leg. There were several large stem vessel thrombi; both old hyalinized villi and more recent hemorrhagic villi with extravasated red blood cells were present. Instances of atresia in the digestive tract have been attributed to vascular disruptions, most likely caused by thrombi.

In an autopsy series of 317 consecutive stillbirths at 15 to 40 weeks gestation, Avigliano and colleagues 35 found 32 cases with thrombi in cord vessels, an incidence of 1:10. The larger incidence in this report may be related to an acceptance of fibrin identified only in phosphotungstic acid-hemotoxylin stains of cord as evidence of clots, even if lacking adherence and changes at the clot-endothelial interface in some cases; others in this study did show loss of endothelium and extravasation of red cells at the inner vessel margin. The umbilical vein was most often involved. Cord abnormalities (eg, knots and hypercoiling) were present in 13 cases. Cord thrombi and FTV do occur together, but not invariably, in this series, as well as in my experience.",
