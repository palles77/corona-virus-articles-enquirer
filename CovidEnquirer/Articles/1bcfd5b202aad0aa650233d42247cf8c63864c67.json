Antigenically similar to their virulent counterparts are FCoV biotypes designated feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), which usually cause only mild enteritis and are unable to efficiently infect macrophages and monocytes. The FCoV spike protein mediates viral entry into the host cell and has previously been shown to determine the distinct tropism exhibited by certain isolates of FIPV and FECV, however, the molecular mechanism underlying viral pathogenesis has yet to be determined. Here we show that the FECV strain WSU 79-1683 (FECV-1683) is highly dependent on host cell cathepsin B and cathepsin L activity for entry into the host cell, as well as on the low pH of endocytic compartments. In addition, both cathepsin B and cathepsin L are able to induce a specific cleavage event in the FECV-1683 spike protein. In contrast, host cell entry by the FIPV strains WSU 79-1146 (FIPV-1146) and FIPV-DF2 proceeds independently of cathepsin L activity and low pH, but is still highly dependent on cathepsin B activity. In the case of FIPV-1146 and FIPV-DF2, infection of primary feline monocytes was also dependent on host cell cathepsin B activity, indicating that host cell cathepsins may play a role in the distinct tropisms displayed by different feline coronavirus biotypes. #",

They have a distinctive set of club-shaped spikes on their envelope, www.elsevier.com/locate/vetmic Available online at www.sciencedirect.com Veterinary Microbiology 132 (2008) [235] [236] [237] [238] [239] [240] [241] [242] [243] [244] [245] [246] [247] [248] comprised of the viral spike protein (S). The coronavirus S protein is a primary determinant of cell tropism and pathogenesis, being responsible (and apparently sufficient) for receptor binding and fusion (Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001) . Overall, the coronavirus S protein is categorized as a class I fusion protein (Earp et al., 2005) based on the presence of characteristic heptad repeats (Bosch et al., 2003; Chambers et al., 1990; Kliger and Levanon, 2003 ); as such it shows characteristic features of fusion proteins of influenza virus (HA), retroviruses (Env) and paramyxoviruses (F) for which there is extensive characterization at a structural and biophysical level (Colman and Lawrence, 2003) . Many viral fusion proteins are known to be activated following cleavage by host cell proteases (Klenk and Garten, 1994) . This has been most extensively documented for orthomyxo-and paramyxoviruses. In the case of high pathogenicity avian influenza strains, mutations in the region of the cleavage site that modify it from a trypsin-like (monobasic) to a furin-like (polybasic) cleavage site allow systemic spread within the host and hence show drastically increased virulence (Klenk et al., 2008) . Although coronaviruses do show structural similarities to canonical class I fusion proteins, they appear to have significant differences in regard to the role of proteolytic cleavage for fusion activation (Bosch and Rottier, 2008) .",

            "text": "Coronavirus S proteins consist of two principal domains (S1 and S2), with S1 responsible for receptor binding, and S2 mediating membrane fusion. In group 3 coronaviruses (e.g., infectious bronchitis virus; IBV) there is ubiquitous cleavage of the S precursor protein to form the S1 and S2 subunits (Cavanagh et al., 1986) , with cleavage apparently carried out by furin. In group 2 viruses (e.g., for mouse hepatitis virus; MHV), S1/S2 cleavage is variable (Frana et al., 1985) . The ability to be cleaved at the S1/S2 boundary has been studied quite extensively for MHV-1 and 4 (Wentworth and Holmes, 2007) . While there is some correlation between S1/S2 cleavage and increased cell-cell fusion, in general there appears to be no direct link between syncytia formation (and by analogy S1/S2 protein cleavage) and pathogenicity (Hingley et al., 2002) . For the group 2 MHV-2, the S protein remains uncleaved in the virus particle (Qiu et al., 2006) . For group 1 viruses (e.g., human coronavirus NL63 and feline coronavirus; FCoV), S1/ S2 cleavage is not considered to occur (Vennema et al., 1990) , however, recent identification of a group 1 coronavirus with a furin-like motif at S1/S2 (Pratelli et al., 2003) suggests this may not be the case with all group 1 members. Infection of cells by several coronaviruses has been shown to be sensitive to the presence of lysosomotropic agents, such as NH 4 Cl, which raise the pH of the endosome (Blau and Holmes, 2001; Gallagher et al., 1991; Hansen et al., 1998; Cavanagh, 1990, 1992; Mizzen et al., 1985) . These data suggest a pH-dependent route of coronavirus entry through endosomes. In some cases (e.g., IBVand MHV-4), the coronavirus fusion reaction has been clearly shown to be triggered by low pH (Chu et al., 2006; Eifart et al., 2007) , whereas in other cases, e.g., SARS-CoV, it is suggested that the low pH of the endosome is important for activation of cathepsin proteases that prime the fusion event (Simmons et al., 2005) , with fusion activation itself considered to be pH-independent.",

While a role for cathepsins during entry of the non-enveloped reoviruses has been known for some time (Ebert et al., 2002; Golden et al., 2004) , it has recently become apparent that the fusion proteins from several families of enveloped viruses can be cleaved by these proteases. Such examples are the recently identified paramyxoviruses Hendra and Nipah (Diederich et al., 2005; Pager et al., 2006; Pager and Dutch, 2005) , as well as Ebola virus (Chandran et al., 2005; Sanchez, 2007; Schornberg et al., 2006) and Moloney murine leukemia virus (Kumar et al., 2007) . In the case of coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MHV-2 are thought to require cathepsin activation (Huang et al., 2005; Qiu et al., 2006; Simmons et al., 2004 Simmons et al., , 2005 , with cathepsin L predominantly involved in SARS-CoV entry, and cathepsin B mediating MHV-2 cleavage during virus entry. For SARS-CoV, neither the site of cathepsin Lmediated proteolysis nor the cleaved products produced are known, although for MHV-2 cathepsin B may cleave at the S1/S2 junction (Qiu et al., 2006) . Other coronaviruses such as MHV-4, HCoV-NL63 and IBV are not considered to be dependent on cathepsins (Chu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2005; Qiu et al., 2006) .",

            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a highly lethal systemic infection of cats caused by a group I feline coronavirus (FCoV) of the FIPV biotype (Haijema et al., 2007; Olsen, 1993) . However, under normal circumstances FCoVs cause only mild and often inapparent enteritis; in this case the virus is classified as the feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) biotype (de Groot-Mijnes et al., 2005; Haijema et al., 2007) . FCoVs can exist as either serotype I, or less commonly as serotype II, in which case the spike protein share extensive similarity with canine coronavirus (CCoV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). Due to the relative ease of growth in cell culture, the serotype II FCoVs have been subject to some degree of molecular characterization. In particular, two strains of serotype II FCoV, WSU 79-1683 and WSU 79-1146, have served as model viruses that cause either mild enteritis or FIP, respectively (Pedersen et al., 1984a,b) . The viruses are thus referred to as FECV-1683 and FIPV-1146. In the ''internal mutation'' model of FIP it is believed that a process of mutation within an individual cat confers the ability of a FECV to infect macrophages and monocytes, and so allow systemic spread and become a virus that causes FIP (Vennema et al., 1998) . Despite extensive study, the genomic differences that determine whether an FCoV will behave as an FECV or an FIPV are still largely unknown (Haijema et al., 2007) . However, in the case of the serotype II FCoVs, mapping studies between the FECV-1683 and FIPV-1146 spike proteins have determined critical domains involved in the switch to FIPV. Surprisingly, the S1 domain (receptorbinding) domain is not important, and the critical region was mapped to the C-terminal part of the S2 (fusion) domain .",

Pellets were resuspended in either phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.4 for infection assays, or acetate buffer pH 5.0 for cathepsin cleavage assays. Virus titers were determined with TCID 50 assays on CRFK cells, using standard techniques (Gray, 1999) . Anti-FCoV nucleocapsid (17B7.1) (Olsen et al., 1992) ",

In order to assess whether cathepsins B and L might play a role in the entry of FIPV-1146 and FIPV-DF2 into its in vivo target, we isolated CD172a-positive, primary feline blood monocytes, pre-treated the cells with the cathepsin B inhibitor CA074-Me, or the cathepsin L inhibitor Z-FY-(t-Bu)-DMK, and then infected them with FIPV-1146 or FIPV-DF2. As shown in Fig. 6 , the cathepsin B inhibitor significantly reduced infection by FIPV-1146 and FIPV-DF2 (approximately 85-95% inhibition), however, the block was not as complete as observed in cell lines (see Figs. 2 and 4) . In line with our data using cell lines, the cathepsin L inhibitor showed no significant effect on FIPV infection of primary feline monocytes. As expected (Dewerchin et al., 2005) , primary feline blood monocytes were only negligibly susceptible to infection with FECV-1683, hence a role for cathepsin B or L cannot be determined in this case (Fig. 6) . These data indicate that cathepsin B-mediated cleavage of FIPV-1146 and FIPV-DF2 may play an important role in cells infected in vivo during the course of FIP.",

The two biotypes are genotypically very similar and the strains FECV-1683 and FIPV-1146, in particular, are known to share a high degree of amino acid identity in their spike protein (>95%) yet cause radically different clinical outcomes-lethal vasculitis for FIPV-1146, compared to mild enteritis for FECV-1683 (Haijema et al., 2007) . Previous studies have shown that the S2 domain of the viral spike protein is a critical discriminating factor in FECV-1683 and FIPV-1146 pathogenesis . The studies presented here raise the possibility that differential proteolysis of the spike (S2) protein might be an important factor in explaining the different pathogenic properties of these viruses.",

            "text": "At present, we cannot definitely determine the exact point in the FCoV infectious cycle that cathepsin cleavage would occur. However, the in vivo localization of cathepsins to the endosome/lysosome system, together with absence of any obvious cleaved product in purified extracellular FCoV particles unless exogenous activated cathepsin is added, would strongly suggest that cleavage occurs in the endosome during virus entry. In support of this, we find that addition of cathepsin inhibitors after virus entry has occurred has no detectable effect on viral replication. While the use of feline aminopeptidase N (fAPN) as a receptor for serotype II feline coronaviruses is well established (Tresnan et al., 1996; Tusell et al., 2007; Van Hamme et al., 2007) , many other aspects of the entry pathway have not been explored in great detail for these viruses. Based on the effects of lysosomotropic agents shown here, we suggest that all serotype II feline coronaviruses enter the endocytic pathway for virus entry, where they are primed for fusion activation by cathepsin cleavage, but that FECV-1683 is much more dependent on endosomal function, suggesting that FIPV-1146 and FIPV-DF2 may escape into the cytosol earlier in the endocytic pathway. Possibilities that might account for this are the differential cleavage of the FIPV spike protein by cathepsin L, or alternatively a lower threshold for any necessary low pH-dependent conformational changes for FIPV spike. It remains to be determined whether a similar situation with cathepsin cleavage exists for the serotype I FCoVs, which are not considered to share the same receptor as FECV-1683 and FIPV-1146 (Dye et al., 2007) . In general, the cleavage site of cathepsins is difficult to predict based on sequence specificity, and so we cannot at present determine specifically where in the spike protein cathepsin B or L might cleave. However, based on the single 150-160 kDa cleaved product seen in Fig. 5 for both cathepsin B and L, it does appear that the spike protein is subject to single, distinct cleavage event for both proteases, most likely occurring at the same approximate position in S. We used the monoclonal antibody 22G6.4 to show this specific cleavage event, and while the epitope recognized by 22G6.4 is not known, by analogy to the many other Sspecific FCoV monoclonal antibodies that have epitopes in S1 (Corapi et al., 1995; Olsen et al., 1993) , we tentatively suggest that the 22G6.4-reactive epitope is also most likely to be within the S1 domain. Based on the cleavage pattern shown in Fig. 5 ., it does not appear that cleavage occurs at the S1/S2 boundary, but rather, the 150-160 kDa cleavage products observed may represent cleavage within the C-terminal part of S2. As the C-terminal part of FCoV S2 has been previously considered to specify the pathogenic (CatL-I), or 10 mM NH 4 Cl, and then infected with virus. 6 h post-infection cells were fixed and stained for immunfluorescence microscopy with the anti-FCoV nucleocapsid mAb 17B7.1. Images from at least three independent experiments were processed and quantified. For quantification >500 cells were scored from three independent replicates. Error bars represent the standard deviation of the mean.",

This may indicate that the cleavage site is relatively inaccessible, and that only a small number of spike proteins are cleaved during virus entry. In this regard, it is noteworthy that in many cases cleavage activation of a viral fusion protein does not necessarily occur on all copies of the protein; for example see Michalski et al. (2000) . Our data also indicate that for FECV-1683 (which is cleaved by both cathepsin B and L), cleavage occurs to a greater degree than with cathepsin B (see Fig. 5 ). These data are consistent with inhibitor treatments where cathepsin B inhibitor had a greater effect on virus infection than cathepsin L inhibitor. Thus we consider that cathepsin B may be the more important protease mediating FCoV entry, with cathepsin L possibly having a more secondary role.",
