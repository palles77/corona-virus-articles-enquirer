Overlapping 12-mer peptides (n = 28,426) across the entire Pp1ab were arrayed on peptide chips and reacted with pooled sera from coronavirus seropositive cats and from one seronegative cat. Eleven peptides were further tested in ELISA with individual serum samples, and three were selected for further screening. Two peptides (16433 and 4934) in the nsp3 region encoding the papain 1 and 2 proteases were identified for final testing. Peptide 4934 reacted equally with positive sera from healthy cats and cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), while peptide 16433 was recognized predominantly by FIP-affected cats. The value of antibody tests based on these peptides in differentiating between the enteric and FIP forms of feline coronavirus infection remains to be determined.",

Infected cats typically remain healthy or develop mild, self-limited enteritis. However, in a small proportion of FECoV-infected cats viral variants that have lost tropism for enterocytes and gained ability to replicate in macrophages emerge. This, combined with ineffective immune response to the virus, leads to development of a severe systemic disease termed feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) (Addie et al., 2009; Pedersen, 2014) . Throughout this manuscript, the term \"feline coronavirus (FCoV)\" is used whenever distinction between the two pathotypes is not relevant.

There is no effective treatment and 95% of affected cats die within one year of the onset of disease (Legendre et al., 2017) . While post-mortem diagnosis of FIP is fairly straight-forward due to the presence of characteristic histopathological lesions of widespread vasculitis (Kipar and Meli, 2014; Pedersen, 2009 ), the same is not true for ante-mortem assessment. A kitten from a multi-cat environment that presents with compatible clinical signs is very likely to be affected by FIP (Pedersen, 2009 ). However, both attending veterinarians and owners of such cats often desire laboratory confirmation of the presumptive FIP diagnosis in order to facilitate an emotionally difficult decision to euthanize the cat. The fact that FIP usually affects young animals, combined with the variability in clinical and laboratory findings (Riemer et al., 2016) contributes to the problem.",

In one study, the virus was detected in only approximately half of the effusion samples and none of the serum/plasma samples from FIP cats using a commercially available qPCR test (Felten et al., 2017 ). Cats exposed to FECV raise antibodies against structural proteins of the virus and the titer of these antibodies often rise to high levels after macrophage-tropic mutants arise and FIP disease begins (Pedersen, 2009 ).

Thus, nsps are one of the first viral proteins abundantly produced within the infected cells. It is therefore logical to assume that cats infected with FCoV would raise an early immune response to at least some of FCoV nsps. However, while a number of previous studies focused on immune responses to structural proteins of the virus (Satoh et al., 2011; Takano et al., 2014) , there are no data related to immune responses to nsps of FCoV. Similarly, studies with coronaviruses other than FCoV were designed to identify immunodominant epitopes within viral structural proteins, but not those present within nsps (Duan et al., 2005; Yu et al., 2007) .",

For example, a total of 10 non-linear B-cell epitopes were identified in nsp1, nsp2 and nsp4 of porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV) (Oleksiewicz et al., 2001b) and sera from boars infected with PRRSV type I contained antibodies to both structural and non-structural proteins of the virus (Oleksiewicz et al., 2001a) . In another study, sera from pigs infected with different PRRSV viruses reacted with nsp1, nsp2 and nsp7 (Brown et al., 2009) . Johnson et al. (2007) described the presence of cross-reactive epitopes in nsp1 and nsp2 of various PRRSV strains, as well as type-specific epitopes within a hyper-variable region of nsp2. The latter provided a basis for development of serological assays able to differentiate between antibody responses due to infection versus vaccination. A number of nsps were also recognised by sera from horses infected with equine arteritis virus (EAV) (Go et al., 2011) . Interestingly, there seemed to be a difference in the immune response to EAV nsps between horses that cleared the infection and those that became carriers (Go et al., 2011) . There was also a difference between the antibody response to nsps of vaccinated horses and those experimentally infected with a virulent strain of EAV, suggesting that serological responses to nsps may be useful as a diagnostic tool to differentiate between infections with viruses of different virulence.",

Immune responses raised by such vaccines may have the advantage of recognising FCoV infected cells early in infection, without the disadvantage of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection associated with humoral immune responses to structural proteins of the virus (Balint et al., 2014) . Early clearance of FECoV infected cells would minimize the chances of de novo emergence of FIP-associated mutations and subsequent development of FIP. Identification of immunodominant epitopes that are recognised by sera from the majority of FIP-affected cats, but not by healthy FCoV seropositive cats, would provide targets for development of FIPV-specific serological test.",

There was no difference in the mean corrected OD 450 values obtained with sera from either FIP-affected (0.52) or non-FIP seropositive cats (0.51) when tested against peptide 4934 (Fig. 6) , although there was a considerable variability in the level of positivity between individual cats (Fig. 5) . Peptide 16433 was recognized predominantly by FIP-affected cats (Fig. 5) , with the mean corrected OD 450 values for samples from FIP cats (0.52) significantly higher than mean corrected OD 450 of sera from either FCoV-antibody positive non-FIP cats (0.09, p < 0.0001) or seronegative cats (0.01, p < 0.0001) (Fig. 6) . The immunogenicity of this peptide appeared to be linked to the presence of threonine (Thr) at the first position (Fig. 7) .",

Secondly, the targets for such immune responses differ between cats that develop FIP and cats that do not. We have shown that infection with FCoV induces antibodies that recognise nsps of FCoV. This conclusion was based on results from two different tests: hybridisation of pooled sera to custom-made peptide chips, and ELISA with selected peptides used as antigens against individual serum samples from cats with different FCoV antibody-and health-status. The agreement between the results of the two tests was poor (Fig. 4) . This is not necessarily unexpected, as the tests were run using different binding conditions and different detection methods. In addition, the chip data would have been affected by the make-up of the pooled serum samples, while individual serum samples were used in ELISA. In addition, the development of peptide ELISAs was hindered by problems associated with the presence of high background due to non-specific binding of feline sera to the plates. Normalisation of the data to OD 450 values from \"no peptide\" wells allowed for the correction for non-specific binding, but this may have also reduced sensitivity of the test and hence, may have contributed to the differences observed between the chip and ELISA data for some combinations of peptides and clinical samples.",

The function of this region is currently unknown (Lei et al., 2018) . We hoped that identification of immunodominant peptides that are recognised by sera from all FCoV infected cats combined with those that are selectively recognised by sera from FIP-affected cats only would provide potential targets for future development of specific diagnostic tests for FIP. Two of the peptides identified in the current study (4934 and 16433), both located within nsp3, showed promising binding pattern with extended collection of feline sera from FIP and non-FIP cats.

The same cat tested highly positive both by ImmunoComb (5/6) and 4934 ELISA a week later (#42a in Fig. 5 ). One may hypothesise that the immune response to nsps (tested by ELISA) precedes the immune response to the structural proteins of the virus (detected by ImmunoComb FIP).

This is the first description of a serological test that appears to have some discriminatory power between FCoV infected cats that remain healthy versus those that develop FIP. Availability of such test would be of a great benefit to companion animal veterinarians worldwide. Hence, it would be of value to investigate factors that influence development of antibodies to peptide 16433 in FCoV infected cats.
