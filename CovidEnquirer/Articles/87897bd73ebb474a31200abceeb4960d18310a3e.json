Viruses are perpetuated as a consequence of many rounds of persistent or acute infections, with possible extracellular stages in which genomes remain basically invariant. Despite lacking direct evidence, we presume that multitudes of successive transmissions have allowed viruses to survive at least for thousands of years, probably undergoing continuous genetic change. Picornavirologists are familiar with an Egyptian stela dated 1550e1333 BCE. (18th Egyptian dynasty) that portrays the image of a man with an atrophic leg probably a consequence of infection with poliovirus (PV) or a related virus (Eggers, 2002) . In this chapter, we deviate from the focus on how viral population numbers affect shortterm survival and evolution, and we turn to features of viruses as they infect successive hosts to permit virus perpetuation in nature.",

Vertical transmission occurs from parental organisms to their offspring, and it includes infection through the germline in animals and plants, from the mother to the embryo during fetal development, and also postnatal transmission to the newborn via blood, milk, or contact (Mims, 1981; Nash et al., 2015) . In horizontal transmission, a virus spreads from infected individuals to susceptible recipients. We are most familiar with this type of transmission. It frequently gives rise to disease outbreaks (infection episodes localized in space and time that affect a few individuals), epidemics (that affect an ample geographical area and are often extended in time), and pandemics (that affect most areas of our planet), typically the periodic influenza pandemics.",

            "text": "All transmission modes have probably contributed to the maintenance of viruses in our biosphere. Persistent infections are likely to have played a major role when the number of individual humans or animals living in close contact was limited throughout the preagricultural era, earlier than 10,000 years ago. A favorable climate change during the Holocene (the geological epoch that began at the end of the Pleistocene, around 12,000 years before the present; compare with Chapter 1) was probably an important driver toward large-scale domestication of plants and animals, 10,000e 7000 years BCE. From the behavior of current viruses, there might have always been a dynamics of virus change for adaptability within individual hosts, and transmissions among animals or plants. The probability of transmission increased as host population numbers rose with agricultural practices and urban life in the last several thousand years. Intensive agriculture must have contributed to accelerated sequence space exploration by viruses with consequences for the emergence of viral disease (Section 7.7). Probably, there has been a continuous dynamics of viral emergences, reemergences, and extinctions with patterns that may be parallel to those observed in present-day viruses. Virology has existed as an organized scientific discipline with the possibility to isolate, store, and study viruses only for about one century. The challenge to reconstruct the events that might have led to viruses similar to the ones we isolate today was addressed in Chapter 1, with a critical first question being if viruses originated 4000 million years ago, or \"only\" 2000 million years ago (diagrams in Figs. 1.3 and 1.4, and Section 1.5 in Chapter 1). In this chapter, we are more modest in our aspirations, and we will analyze, with the tools of genomics, what happens when viruses evolve for months or years in what we call interhost virus evolution.",

Despite the current capacity to amplify tiny amounts of viral nucleic acids for nucleotide sequence determinations, proposals on how long-term viral evolution might proceed have to be based mainly on the comparison of viral genomes and the structure of viral proteins from modern representatives of different virus groups. First, we should understand the basic concepts related to virus transmission, keeping in mind viral population numbers and the complexity of viral populations.",

At a population level, a value of R 0 larger than one means that a virus will continue its propagation among susceptible hosts if no environmental changes or external influences intervene. An R 0 value lower than one means that the virus is doomed to extinction at the epidemiological level under those specific circumstances. The basic models of infection dynamics were developed by R.M. Anderson, R.M. May, and M.A. Nowak, with inclusion of the following key parameters: rate k at which uninfected hosts enter the population of susceptible individuals (x), their normal death rate (u) (so that the equilibrium abundance of uninfected hosts is k/u), number of infected hosts (y), mortality due to infection (v) (so that 1/u \u00fe v is the average lifetime of an infected host), a rate constant (b) that characterizes parasite infectivity (so that bx is the rate of new infections and bxy is the rate at which infected hosts transmit the virus to uninfected hosts). These parameters are schematically indicated in Fig. 7 .1 and they provide a theoretical value for R 0 (Anderson and May 1991; Nowak and May 2000; Nowak, 2006; Woolhouse, 2017) .",

Despite uncertainties, consistent R 0 values have been estimated for different viral pathogens based on field observations. Values of R 0 for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus range from two to five; for PV the range is 5e7, and for Ebola virus is 1.5e2.5. For the measles virus (MV), which is one of the most contagious viruses described to date, the R 0 reaches 12e18 (Heffernan et al., 2005; Althaus, 2014) . Most isolates of the SARS coronavirus that circulated months after the emergence of this human pathogen had modest R 0 values, and this is consistent with SARS not having reached the pandemic proportions that were feared immediately following its emergence. In contrast, MV is highly transmissible, thus explaining frequent outbreaks as soon as a sizable population stops vaccinating its infants. This is an important problem, fueled by antivaccination campaigns without scientific basis. Since some of the parameters that enter the basic FIGURE 7 .1 A schematic representation of the main parameters of viral dynamics that enter the equations that predict the rate of variation of uninfected and infected (internal horizontal lines in the human figure) individuals (shaded box on the left) and the R 0 value (shaded box on the right).

Holland and colleagues wrote the following statement: \"Therefore, the acute effects and subtle chronic effects of infections will differ not only because we all vary genetically, physiologically, and immunologically, but also because we all experience a different array of quasispecies challenges. These facts are easily overlooked by clinicians and scientists because disease syndromes are often grossly similar for each type of virus, and because it would appear to make no difference in a practical sense. However, for the person who develops Guillain-Barr e syndrome following a common cold, or for the individual who remains healthy despite many years of HIV-1 infection, for example, it may make all the difference in the world\" (Holland et al., 1992) . The ever increasing number of identified human genes whose allelic forms influence viral infections provides strong support for the predictions of Holland et al. Indeterminacies in the process of virus spread can be viewed as an extension of the diversification due to bottleneck events in the case of virus transmission, as visualized in Figs. 6.1 and 6.2 in Chapter 6, when dealing with the limitations of the virus samples retrieved from an infected host as the starting material for experimental evolution approaches.",

Slow evolution is expected for retroviruses such as human T-cell lymphotropic virus types 1 and 2 (HTLV-1 and HTLV-2) whose life cycles are dominated by the integrated provirus stage, with the viruses following the clonal expansion of their host cells (Melamed et al., 2014; Kulkarni and Bangham, 2018) . Some single-stranded DNA viruses display rates of evolution typical of the rapidly evolving RNA viruses (Table 7 .1). Different genes of the same virus set may show different rates of evolution (i.e., the polymerase and other nonstructural proteins may evolve more slowly than structural proteins). Thus, a rate of evolution is far from being a universal feature of a virus. A comparison of rates of synonymous substitutions (under the assumption that synonymous substitutions do not affect protein function; see Chapter 2 for limitations of considering synonymous mutations as neutral) for several RNA viruses, yielded a range of evolutionary rates of 6 \u00c2 10 \u00c02 to 1 \u00c2 10 \u00c07 synonymous substitutions per synonymous site per year (Hanada et al., 2004) . The values were recalculated from primary phylogenetic data using maximum likelihood (ML) (Section 7.6), under the assumption of the molecular clock, and inference of the ancestral nucleotide sequences at the tree nodes. The five orders of magnitude variation were attributed mainly to the degree of virus replication rather than to differences in error rate. We will deal with the molecular clock hypothesis (constant rate of accumulation of mutations) in Section 7.3.3, but the major features of virus evolution studied in previous chapters (mainly those typical of mutant swarm-forming RNA and DNA viruses) should make us skeptical of similar evolution rates in different biological contexts. Rate variations were documented with HIV-1 subpopulations in different compartments of the human brain . The data did not fit a \"global\" molecular clock for the virus in the brain, and \"local\" clocks showed that meninges and temporal lobe HIV-1 subpopulations evolved 30 and 100 times faster, respectively, than other HIV-1 populations in the brain. It is believed that these differences were due to random drift of viral sequences rather than selection for some genome types. An additional complication is that even restricting virus isolations to the same biological material in a standard epidemiological setting, several measurements indicated discontinuities in evolutionary rates. The discontinuities had at least two origins: the nonlinear effect of time, and some unique features of evolution occurring inside an infected host. These points are examined next.",

Some viruses remain infectious in the environment for prolonged time periods, until they reach a susceptible host in which to initiate replication rounds. This is the case of viruses transmitted by the fecal-oral route, such as enteroviruses. FMDV can adhere and remain infectious on many objects (fomites), including dust particles, food products with neutral pH, or insects that can transport the virus mechanically. Infectious FMDV can traverse long distances (many kilometers) on dust particles, people, trains, and the like. Even if some infectivity is lost, a few infectious particles are sufficient to infect an animal (Sellers, 1971 (Sellers, , 1981 . There are some classic examples of longdistance transport of FMDV, a virus subjected to close scrutiny due to its economic impact. One is the spread of SAT1 and A22 FMDV during the 1960s in Turkey along the railway line from the cattle-raising region of Lake Van to slaughterhouses in Istanbul [this and other examples are described in (Brooksby, 1981) ]. Computer models have been developed to explain and predict possible airborne FMDV transmission in different geographical areas, the origin of epidemics, and the effectiveness of contingency plans (Sorensen et al., 2000; Tidesley et al., 2017) . [As an anecdote, in my experience as a member of the Research Group of the Standing Technical Committee for the Control of FMD of Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in the 1980s, FMD outbreaks in any country always came from somewhere else]. A time-dependent bias in evolutionary rates for viruses has been amply documented (Duchene et al., 2014; Aiewsakun and Katzourakis, 2016) , including when rates are compared between present-day isolates and those that circulated thousands of years ago (Muhlemann et al., 2018) .",

The reason is that during the extracellular stages, the virus will not undergo genetic change, at least to the extent of variation during intracellular replication (possible mutations due to chemical damage in viral genomes is indicated in Section 2.2. of Chapter 2). The effect of nonreplicative time intervals in the rate of evolution is illustrated in Fig. 7 .3. Some complications should be considered in the interpretation of the analyses depicted in Fig. 7 .3: (i) the consensus sequences determined to characterize the virus shed by each animal represent a simplification of the real genome composition of the virus. (ii) Individual animals vary in physiological and immunological status, and, obviously, they are not in line waiting to be infected; they move, gather around water and food sources, some are isolated, others in close contact with their peer, and so on. (iii) In this case, virus transport is assumed to be mechanical (on dust particles carried by wind, aerosols, insects, etc.) without additional viral replication during transport. However, subpopulations of 7.3 Rates of virus evolution in nature the most environment-resistant particles, or particles that adhere best to the transporter object, may bias the composition of the virus that will reach an animal to pursue replication. Such events, occurring for 10 to 100 rounds of host infections, render the appalling virus diversity described in Chapter 1 a bit less appalling. Since several additional environmental circumstances are changeable and unpredictable, it is unlikely that rates of viral evolution in nature can remain invariant on the basis of some internal principle of constant mutation occurrence (as if the accumulation of mutations was as monotonous as radioactive decay!).",

Mullins, and colleagues systematically observed lower nucleotide sequence divergence between HIV-1 isolates from different individuals sampled in primary infection than between isolates from individuals with advanced illness. HIV-1 regained some ancestral features when infecting a new host, again explaining a higher intrahost than the interhost evolutionary rate (Herbeck et al., 2006) . In a study of HIV-1 transmission between several pairs of individuals over an 8-year period, A.D. Redd and colleagues reported that the viral populations found in the newly infected recipients were more closely related to ancestral sequences from the donor than to the sequences found in the donor near the time of transmission (Redd et al., 2012) . Preferential transmission of ancestral sequences may also contribute to lower interhost than intrahost rates of evolution (Box 7.1). FIGURE 7.4 Scheme of a possible mechanism for faster intrahost than interhost virus evolution. Transmission events are represented by long arrows and intrahost evolution by short arrows (middle of the picture). The virus in the person on the left (black outline) has evolved to generate a complex mutant spectrum. However, only a subset of genomes are efficiently transmitted to the recipient person (brown outline). The virus in the recipient person evolves toward a complex mutant spectrum. Again, in this new mutant spectrum, only a minor set of genomes that resemble the ones in the first transmission is efficiently transmitted to the third person (green outline). The net result is that because at each transmission the genomes related to those that first entered the previous host have an advantage, rates of evolution will appear as slower than those within each host. Boxes at the bottom summarize the major event at each step. See text for additional related mechanisms and references. 7.3 Rates of virus evolution in nature K.A. Lythgoe and C. Fraser provided evidence that cycling of HIV-1 through long-lived memory CD4 \u00fe T cells is probably the main contributing factor to slower HIV-1 evolution at the epidemic level (Lythgoe and Fraser, 2012) . Ancestral sequences of HIV-1 in infected individuals may arise by the activation of proviral sequences kept in the form of quasispecies memory. In this case, we refer to the type of molecular memory defined as a reservoir, anatomical, or cellular memory in Section 5.5 of Chapter 5. A related type of reservoir memory is found in HBV, in the form of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) that persists in the nuclei of infected hepatocytes, and acts as a template for the synthesis of pregenomic RNA and viral mRNAs (Kay and Zoulim, 2007) . In this case, a record of ancient sequences is registered in the cccDNA. It should be noted that memory levels are dependent on fitness values, as evidenced experimentally with FMDV and expected from the theoretical basis of memory implementation (Chapter 5). In consequence, the most abundant memory genomes established early in an infection might be those displaying the highest fitness early in infection, and they might be better adapted to initiate infections than to sustain them ( Fig. 7 .4).",

Considerable evolutionary stasis is also observed by comparing isolates of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2, whose replication displays a preference for maintaining its integration in cellular DNA (Melamed et al., 2014) . For viruses that have a dual potential of error-prone replication and cellular DNA-like stasis, the permanence in cellular DNA may also contribute to reduced long-term evolutionary rates. HBV quasispecies dynamics was examined in a virus that infected members of the same family that presumably acquired the virus through mother-to-infant transmission (Lin et al., 2015) . Again, the intrahost evolutionary rate was higher than the interhost rate, and the latter decreased with the number of transmissions. The differences were mainly due to nonsynonymous substitutions at limited sites. These observations were interpreted as a rapid switch of HBV between colonization (invasion of new host) and adaptation (quasispecies optimization in the new host). The authors referred to the colonization-adaptation trade-off (CAT) model or alternations of virus facing an environment marked by a limited host immune response followed by a period of active immune response. In the former environment, viruses displaying rapid replication are selected, while in the latter environment, HBV escape mutants with lower productivity are selected. In each transmission, when the virus reaches a new host, the previously adapted subpopulations are overgrown by the rapidly replicating ones. Again, cccDNA can serve as a reservoir of ancient sequences.",

Even for neutral evolution, spatial asymmetries in populations are sufficient to perturb the molecular clock rate, as documented with a theoretical model of broad applicability (Allen et al., 2015) . However, quasispecies and the operation of a clock are not totally irreconcilable. An epidemiological study with FMDV suggested that viral quasispecies could produce a transient molecular clock due to the periodic sampling of components of the mutant spectrum in transmission (Villaverde et al., 1991) .

Remarkably, the antigenic variation over 6 decades was due to fluctuations among limited combinations of amino acid residues without net accumulation of amino acid substitutions over time (Fig. 7.5) . This result suggests that constraints at the protein level may maintain a long-term virus identity at the antigenic level. In a related observation on the interhost evolution of HIV-1 mentioned in Section 7.3.2, HIV-1 recovered ancestral features when infecting a new host (Herbeck et al., 2006) .

MV infection produces lifelong immunity (probably as a result of several factors) while patients that have cleared the hepatitis C virus (HCV) can be reinfected by the same virus.

Continuous epitopes are those whose primary amino acid sequence has the information to react with the cognate antibody. Discontinuous epitopes are those whose reactive residues come from distant positions of the same protein or residues of different proteins.

Mutation rates and frequencies for RNA viruses fall in the range of 10 \u00c0 5 to 10 \u00c0 3 substitutions per nucleotide (Chapter 2). However, mutation rates along a viral genome are not uniform, as evidenced by the occurrence of hot spots for variation. Influences such as nucleotide sequence context or RNA structure may conceivably alter mutation rates. It was proposed that a predicted double-stranded RNA at the region encoding the major antigenic site of FMDV might increase the polymerase error rate locally and give rise to multiple amino acid substitutions (Weddell et al., 1985) . While at some specific sites polymerases may be more error-prone than average, subsequent evidence for FMDV indicated that antigenic variation is due to amino acid substitutions at different antigenic sites and that even variation at the major site can be mediated by distant amino acids on the viral capsid (Rowlands et al., 1983; Geysen et al., 1984; Mateu et al., 1990; Feigelstock et al., 1996) . Later molecular studies have not provided evidence that viruses may have a large number of serotypes because their polymerases are more error-prone when copying regions encoding amino acids that belong to antigenic sites. Therefore, the possibility that differences in mutation rates can determine a different number of circulating serotypes is unlikely.",

Indeed, there is no universal procedure used to classify viruses serologically, and therefore, strictly speaking, there is the possibility that a different number of serotypes could be obtained using alternative classification procedures. FMDV is a pertinent example. Its seven serotypes are defined on the basis of a very stringent test that cannot be performed with human viruses for obvious reasons: the absence of crossprotection resulting from vaccination or infection with a given FMDV. Infection or vaccination with FMDV of one serotype does not confer protection against FMDV of a different serotype. In contrast, the subtype classification of FMDV was based on serological assays, such as cross-neutralization or complement fixation tests, usually using sera raised in guinea pigs. These assays allowed classification of FMDV in more than 65 serological subtypes. Subtyping was stopped when it was realized that using increasingly discriminatory assays such as reactivity with MAbs, virtually any new isolate could define a new subtype [(Mateu et al., 1988) ; see Sobrino and Domingo, 2004; Mateu, 2017) for review of serotype and subtype classification of FMDV]. Despite these considerations, it is unlikely that serological assays using in vitro tests would be responsible for a 100-fold difference between two human pathogens such as HRV and HAV. Thus, it does not seem justified to attribute antigenic constancy to an artifact derived from diagnostic procedures.",

The reader can find an illustration of this point by comparing the expanded phylogenetic HCV tree from six to seven genotypes and the subtype ramifications, published by P. Simmonds and colleagues in 1993 [compare (Simmonds et al., 1993 and (Smith et al., 2014) ], and continuing new subtype identification (Hedskog et al., 2019) .

            "text": "We come to constraints at antigenic sites that limit the number of accepted amino acid substitutions as a model for antigenic invariance. It is the preferred model of molecular virologists. The initial concept was proposed by M.G. Rossmann, in his canyon hypothesis (Rossmann, 1989) , based on studies with HRV14. A canyon in the virus preserves the receptor-binding site inside while permitting amino acid substitutions that affect antigenicity, without consequences for receptor recognition. A physical and functional separation between receptor and antibody binding allows extensive antigenic variation. Clearly, in many viruses, there is an overlap between antigenic and receptor recognition sites (Section 4.5 in Chapter 4), that could limit antigenic variation. A difference in constraints is also supported by a structural comparison carried out by J.M. Casasnovas and his colleagues of the interaction of PV and HRV16 with their respective cellular receptors that revealed a receptorbinding site more accessible in PV than in HVR16, rendering the latter suited to escape antibody neutralization (Xing et al., 2000) . This would render HRV a picornavirus prone to antigenic variation, as indeed found in nature. Thus, constraints imposed by the requirement to interact with the cellular receptor may explain the limited capacity for antigenic diversification, and perhaps with the contribution of other influences, the puzzle of widely different antigenic types despite similarly high genome mutability. Additional structural and functional studies with viruses of different families are necessary to substantiate this proposal. (Table 7 .2). In particular, the cardiovirus Mengo virus (one serotype) displays similar MAR frequencies than HRV (100 serotypes). In fact, none of the RNA and DNA viruses listed in Table 7 .2 deviate from a broad range of MARM frequencies of 10 \u00c0 3 to 10 \u00c0 5 , except for substitutions at some discontinuous epitopes of FMDV (Lea et al., 1994) . In some studies, the stability of the selected escape mutants was tested after a few passages in cell culture, but in other studies, the lack of reversion of the antigenic change was not ascertained. Two FMDV escape mutants showed a selective disadvantage over the parental wild-type virus (fitness decrease); upon continued replication, the mutants acquired fitness-enhancing mutations without reversion of the antigenic change (Mart\u00ednez et al., 1991a) .",

            "text": "The likely multiple origins of viruses, followed by extended events of interaction with evolving host organisms of all phyla have produced myriad viral particles that at the present time outnumber cells by a factor of 10 (Chapter 1). The way to put order into such diversity is to classify viruses as done periodically by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) (http://www.ictvonline.org/). Computational procedures developed to study phylogenetic relationships in evolutionary biology are routinely applied to virology to establish relationships among closely or distantly related viruses (Page and Holmes, 1998; Hall, 2001; Felsenstein, 2004; Salemi and Vandamme, 2004; Yang, 2006; Russell, 2014) . No phylogenetic tree that connects the viruses that have been characterized to date can be derived in a reliable way, not even a tree for DNA or for RNA viruses. What we can do is to produce trees for related viruses that probably share a common ancestor. Many data banks are available for viruses to retrieve sequences for comparison with new isolates. Despite the fact that data banks are periodically updated, some are listed in Table 7 .3, and can serve as the starting point to reach the desired uniform resource locator (URL) to implement a procedure for genome characterization. Prior to any FIGURE 7 .6 Stability of selected mutant subpopulations when selective pressure is removed. This scheme is the same portrayed in Fig. 3 .6 of Chapter 3, but shifted toward the right of the time scale. Five different colors have been chosen to depict fluctuations of four genomic classes. In a real population, thousands of genomes may be involved in each infected cell. In the present diagram, the red line represents genomes selected for their resistance to neutralizing monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. Once the antibody pressure is removed, the mutant genomes may remain dominant either because the relevant substitutions do not affect viral fitness or because compensatory mutations have been acquired (top diagram). In contrast, upon removal of the antibody pressure, the proportion of selected genomes may fade with time due to a fitness cost and absence of compensatory mutations (bottom diagram). In the latter case, the antibody-resistant mutant will not contribute to the long-term antigenic diversification of the virus. (Continued) 7 .5 Comparing viral genomes. Sequence alignments and databases comparative study of nucleotide or amino acid sequences (not only to establish phylogenetic relationships, but also to calculate genetic distances, to identify regulatory regions, functional domains, and structural motifs, to design oligonucleotide primers for amplification, or other applications) it is essential to align sequences accurately, and some programs for sequence alignments are also given in Table 7 .3, including processing of large data sets obtained by deep sequencing (Kearse et al., 2012; Kumar et al., 2016 Kumar et al., , 2019 Lai and Verma, 2017; Nakamura et al., 2018) , and visualization of pangenome networks (Peng et al., 2018) .",

Some of them offer a link with the web page of the ICTV, thus providing background information to assign newly determined sequences to current taxonomic groups. A structure-based amino acid sequence alignment of protein homologs can be carried out based on three-dimensional structures of proteins. Such types of amino acid sequence alignments may help in the identification of relevant Holmes, 1998; Mount, 2004; Salemi and Vandamme, 2004 ) (see also Chapter 3 for parameters used to quantify mutant spectrum complexity). Relevant information on protein evolution can be derived from alignment of the protein sequence of related viruses (or of isolates from one virus, or for components of the same mutant spectrum) and analyzing the statistical acceptability of the divergent amino acids at each position (Feng and Doolittle, 1996) with consideration of amino acid location when a three-dimensional structure is known (Farheen et al., 2017) . Statistical acceptability derives from the chemical nature and shape of the amino acid side chains, their structural context, and also the limitations that the genetic code imposes on amino acid replacements (Porto et al., 2005) . The basic assumption is that the more conserved the amino acid sequences, and the more similar are the variant amino acids, it is more likely that the proteins are derived from a common ancestor. M. Dayhoff pioneered the early comparison of protein sequences establishing a protein information resource (PIR) in the middle of the 20th century. Tables named PAM (percent accepted mutation) were constructed, and several evolved versions such as BLOSUM matrices, based on the BLOCKS database, are used to compare protein sequences. The BLO-SUM62 amino acid substitution matrix groups amino acids according to their chemical structure and provides a probability of occurrence of each amino acid replacement: zero, amino acid replacement expected by chance; positive number, replacement found more often than by chance; and negative number, replacement found less often than by chance.",

Application of phylogenetic methods to virus evolution requires careful consideration of the evolutionary models to be used, including probabilities of the different types of nucleotide and amino acid replacements, and the rates at which they may occur. Statistical methods (i.e., likelihood ratio tests) are available to select an adequate model for a given data set (Salemi and Vandamme, 2004 ). At the nucleotide sequence level, it is often assumed that when transitions are more frequent than transversions in a set of related sequences, no saturation of mutation took place. In contrast, when transversions are more frequent than transitions, saturation is presumed (Xia and Xie, 2001) . Parameter a applied to amino acid sequence alignments (e.g., using the program AAml from PAML package, version 3.14) takes into account multiple amino acid replacements per site, as well as unequal substitution rates among sites (Yang et al., 2000) . Parameter a can be calculated using the amino acid replacement matrix WAG available in the program MODELTEST (Posada and Crandall, 1998) . Despite their obvious utility, it is unlikely that these statistical procedures which were developed on the assumption of successions of defined sequences (rather than mutant clouds) can capture the complexities underlying longterm evolution of viruses in nature.",

In another approach, the probabilities of equivalence between pairs of residues in viral proteins are converted into evolutionary distances (Bamford et al., 2005; Ravantti et al., 2013) . The structure-based classification has grouped the coat protein of icosahedral viruses in separate classes, each of which, interestingly, embraces different domains of life (Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya) (McTavish et al., 2017) . A lineage of structurally related viruses includes tailed bacteriophages and the herpesviruses, suggesting that parts of the genomes of complex viruses may have a very ancient origin. They might have belonged to viruses that infected primitive cells before the latter diverged into the domains of life that we identify in our biosphere (Bamford et al., 2005; Villarreal, 2005) (compare with models of virus origins in Chapter 1).",

Back to the mutant clouds cloud components may differ in pathogenic potential. Fig. 7 .7 summarizes the diversification of HIV-1, since it entered the human population. Once HIV-1 originated from multiple introductions of a chimpanzee simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVcpz), the four major HIV-1 groups M, O, N, and P were generated, and group M evolved into the multiple subtypes and recombinant forms that circulate at present. Many factors determine the pathogenic potential of any of the HIV-1 subtypes and the newly arising recombinant forms. HIV-1 is a notorious case of successful emergence of a new viral pathogen from a zoonotic reservoir of a related virus.

The study concerned a WNV lineage 2 that circulated in Europe during the beginning of the 21st century. Environmental changes modified the haplotype composition while maintaining an invariant consensus sequence, an example of \"perturbation\" manifested only at the level of the mutant spectrum (see Section 6 in Chapter 6). There is evidence that some viruses that once produced human disease might be now extinct. One example is provided by a putative viral agent of Economo's disease (also termed lethargic encephalitis or epidemic encephalitis), a degenerative disease of the brain that produced a loss of neurons. The disease had an acute phase of variable duration and intensity, followed by a chronic phase, sometimes with a late onset of symptoms. The disease showed a seasonal character with a maximum incidence in late winter. The first cases were recorded in Eastern Europe in 1915, and the disease was first described by Baron C. Von Economo in Vienna in 1917 . During 1920e23 the disease attained pandemic proportions, although the number of cases and mortality were limited. It was estimated that between 1917 and 1929, about 100,000 cases occurred in Germany and Great Britain, and then mysteriously, the number of cases decreased, and the disease disappeared (Ford, 1937) . At the time it was suspected that a virus similar to IV or some picornavirus might have been the etiological agent of this disease, but no proof could be provided. Occasional cases of lethargic encephalitis are diagnosed, and there is evidence of a possible connection of the once epidemic disease agent with postencephalitic Parkinsonism (Vilensky et al., 2010; Bigman and Bobrin, 2018) .",

Interestingly, in the 1980s, the incidence of serotype C FMDV decreased to the point that at the beginning of the 21st century this FMDV serotypes was considered nearly extinct and its eradication feasible. It cannot be totally excluded, however, that type C FMDV is replicating in some persistently infected ruminant in some remote part of our planet and that the virus reemerges again. If not, its ecological niche has been occupied by FMDVs of other serotypes. This is one important issue behind virus eradication (smallpox in the late 1970s or rinderpest in 2011): the possibility that the niche left by an eradicated pathogen is occupied by a related pathogen. A.E. Gorbalenya, E. Wimmer, and colleagues examined the possible evolutionary origin of present-day PV, and that other picornaviruses might occupy the PV niche in the event of its eradication (Jiang et al., 2007) . Their phylogenetic analysis suggests that PV could originate from a C-cluster coxsackie A virus through amino acid substitutions in the capsid that led to a change of receptor specificity (other cases are discussed in Chapter 4). They generated chimeras of PV and its putative ancestors, and some of them were viable and pathogenic for transgenic mice expressing the PV receptor. The authors suggest that in a world without antiPV neutralizing antibodies, coxsackieviruses may mutate to generate a new PV-like agent.",

Emergence is defined as the appearance of a new pathogen for a host, while reemergence often refers to the reappearance of a viral pathogen, following a period of absence. Being a popular topic, the reader will find numerous books and reviews on the subject. It is worth emphasizing that in the 20th century many authors took the lead in emphasizing the problem of viral emergences and the need to investigate the underlying mechanisms, notably S.S. Morse and J. Lederberg [see several chapters of Morse (1993 Morse ( , 1994 ]. Given the adaptive capacity of viruses, in particular, the RNA viruses, the reader will certainly suspect that genetic variation of viruses must be one of the factors involved in viral emergences. Indeed, most of the high-impact new viral diseases recorded recently or historically are due to RNA viruses. A statement by J. Lederberg reflects our vulnerability in the face of the nearly unlimited potential of viruses to vary: \"Abundant sources of genetic variation exist for viruses to learn new tricks, not necessarily confined to what happens routinely or even frequently\" (Lederberg, 1993) . The situation is even more complex because a genetic variation of viruses is only one of many ingredients that promote the introduction of new viral pathogens in the human population. A report issued by the U.S. Institute of Medicine in 2003, analyzed and documented 13 factors that, individually or in combination, participate in the emergence of microbial disease. They include a number of sociological, environmental, and ecological influences that act to promote the emergence and reemergence of viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa (Smolinski et al., 2003) (Box 7.2) .",

We are now aware that even if two viral populations shed by an infected host have an identical number of infectious particles, not all mutant spectra might have the genomes subpopulations to permit the establishment in the human host ( Fig. 7.9 ). There is a natural lottery regarding which quasispecies subpopulations will hit which host. In the words of J.J. Holland and his colleagues: \"Although new RNA virus diseases of humans will continue to emerge at indeterminate intervals, the viruses themselves will not really be new, but rather mutated and rearranged to allow infection of new hosts, or to cause new disease patterns. It is important to remember that every quasispecies genome swarm in an infected individual is BOX 7.2 unique and 'new' in the sense that no identical population of RNA genomes has ever existed before and none such will ever exist again\" (Holland et al., 1992) . The number of infectious particles shed by an infected host determines the probability of transmission to susceptible hosts (Section 7.2), and of producing an emergence in a new host species. Viral population numbers and the number of transmissible particles can be largely amplified in immunocompromised individuals, and have been termed super-spreaders; they can contribute large amounts of variant viruses to the transmission lottery (Rocha et al., 1991; Paunio et al., 1998; Gavrilin et al., 2000; Khetsuriani et al., 2003; Small et al., 2006; Odoom et al., 2008; Woolhouse, 2017) . Concerning the recipient hosts, the higher the number of potentially susceptible hosts that come into contact with an infected donor, the higher the probability of establishment of an emergent infection. It is likely that the advent of agricultural practices some 10,000 years ago, combined with increased contacts between humans and animals, inaugurated a time of new viral emergences. In the new scenario, viruses could shift from a persistent (low interhost transmission) mode into an acute (high interhost transmission) infection mode.",

Several sociological and ecological factors that Only a subset of the genomes that surface an infected pig may be able to establish an infection in humans. The scheme indicates that a single genome that reached a human was not adequate to establish infection (pathway A).

R.V. Sol e and B. Goodwin define the sciences of complexity as \"the study of those systems in which there is no simple and predictable relationship between levels, between the properties of parts and of wholes.\" Several levels of complexity can be identified in the events that give rise to the emergence of a viral disease (Domingo, 2010; S aiz FIGURE 7. 10 Types of habitats that may limit or facilitate interaction between hosts that can potentially establish an emergent infection in a local habitat. In separate habitats, contacts are restricted while in overlapping habitats, contacts are facilitated. In most cases, habitats cannot be reduced to the standard extremes, and are multicomponent habitats with various degrees of complexity. See text for implications for viral emergences. 7.7 Extinction, survival, and emergence of viral pathogens. Back to the mutant clouds et al., 2014). One level of complexity concerns the behavior of viral populations which is often determined by interactions among components of mutant spectra in a way that cannot be predicted by the individual components of the population, even if we knew them! The second level of complexity that can have an impact on the emergence of viral disease stems from the environmental, sociological, and ecological variables that must converge for a virus from some animal reservoir to come into contact and successfully infect a new host, for example, a human. Despite close surveillance, the emergences of viral diseases are unpredictable. Experts anticipate new influenza pandemics to arise somewhere in Asia from the avian reservoirs of IV; however, in 2009, the new influenza pandemic originated in Central America. Paradoxically, despite a general agreement that surveillance of human and zoonotic virus reservoirs should be intensified using new molecular tools (i.e., mutant spectrum analyses to go beyond the consensus sequences), the reality is that what we have learned are the reasons why viral emergences are unpredictable. The \"abundant sources of genetic variation\" that was emphasized by J. Lederberg (see Section 7.7.1) should be extended to refer to \"abundant sources of complexity in viral emergences.\" For the time being, we have to be ready to react once the emergence has already occurred. Research funding agencies have a lot to do in favoring \"reactive\" rather than \"preventive\" antiviral policies.",

A point that is often either ignored or not sufficiently emphasized is that the quasispecies nature of viral populations introduces an element of uncertainty regarding which types of mutants are transmitted to new hosts. Despite being a complication that cannot be easily handled, it is a fact that should stimulate new approaches to the surveillance of virus transmission and the identification of the founder viruses in new infections.",

            "text": "A steady accumulation of mutations during the evolution of organisms was a well-accepted proposal that agreed with the neutral theory of molecular evolution developed last century. One suspects that this agreement resulted in a premature preference for a regular clock of steady incorporation of mutations to work in the case of viruses. The evidence is that there are multiple molecular mechanisms that render the operation of a molecular clock for viruses very unlikely, and perhaps fortuitous in some cases. Several possible mechanisms of variable evolutionary rates have been discussed, and further clarification is expected from entire genome sequencing applied to viruses during outbreaks and epidemics. Viruses are probably not the best biological systems to obtain experimental evidence in support of the clock hypothesis.",

Again, additional work is necessary to solve this interesting problem.",

Basic principles of transmission dynamics must take into consideration sampling effects and the inherent heterogeneity of viral populations. \u2022 Rates of evolution of viruses in nature are extremely high as compared to the estimated rate for their host organisms. Contrary to some tenets of neutral evolution, rates of viral evolution are not constant with time. In particular, several mechanisms explain why intrahost virus evolution is faster than interhost evolution. \u2022 Several procedures for sequence alignments and derivation of phylogenetic trees allow a partial description of virus diversification in nature. \u2022 Antigenic diversification of viruses is subjected to constraints that differ among viruses. Some viruses have a single serotype while others have 100 serotypes. Several possible mechanisms may contribute to this difference. \u2022 The emergence and reemergence of new viral pathogens is a multifactorial event with a clear influence of host and virus population numbers. Several levels of complexity participate in the emergence of a new pathogen, rendering the event highly unpredictable.",
