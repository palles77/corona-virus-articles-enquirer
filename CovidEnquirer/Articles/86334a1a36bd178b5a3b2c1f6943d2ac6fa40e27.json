For vesicular stomatitis virus, conserved region VI in the large (L) polymerase protein catalyzes both guanine-N-7 (G-N-7) and ribose 2'-O (2'-O) methyltransferases, and the two methylases share a binding site for the methyl donor S-adenosyl-l-methionine. Unlike conventional mRNA cap methylation, the 2'-O methylation of VSV precedes subsequent G-N-7 methylation. In this study, we found that individual alanine substitutions in two conserved aromatic residues (Y1650 and F1691) in region VI of L protein abolished both G-N-7 and 2'-O methylation. However, replacement of one aromatic residue with another aromatic residue did not significantly affect the methyltransferase activities. Our studies provide genetic and biochemical evidence that conserved aromatic residues in region VI of L protein essential for both G-N-7 and 2'-O methylations. In combination with the structural prediction, our results suggest that these aromatic residues may participate in RNA recognition.

Formation of the cap structure usually requires four enzymatic reactions. First, an RNA triphosphatase hydrolyses the 5' triphosphate end of the nascent mRNA to yield a diphosphate (5' ppN). Second, the diphosphate RNA end is capped with GMP by an RNA guanylyltransferase via a covalent enzyme-GMP intermediate to yield the GpppN cap structure. Third, the N-7 position of guanine cap is methylated by a guanine-N-7 (G-N-7) MTase to yield 7 m GpppN. Finally, for some eukaryotic mRNA, the cap structure can be further methylated by a ribose-2\u2032-O (2\u2032-O) MTase to yield 7 m GpppN m . The mRNA capping and methylation reactions are conserved among all eukaryotes (Shuman and Schwer, 1995; Furuichi and Shatkin, 2000; Shuman, 2001) . In this conventional cap methylation reaction, two methylase activities are carried out by separate enzymes, each containing its own catalytic site and the binding site for the methyl donor, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM).",

The NNS RNA viruses are classified into four families: the Rhabdoviridae, as exemplified by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and rabies virus; the Paramyxoviridae, as exemplified by human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3); the Filoviridae, as exemplified by Ebola and Marburg viruses; the Bornaviridae, as exemplified by Borna disease virus (BDV). With the exception of Bornaviridae, NNS RNA viruses typically replicate in the cytoplasm. These viruses share a common strategy for gene expression and replication (Rose and Whitt, 2001; Whelan et al., 2004) . For many years, VSV has been used as a model to study the replication and gene expression of NNS RNA viruses. The viral genomic RNA is tightly encapsidated by the nucleocapsid (N) protein, forming the N-RNA complex that serves as a functional template for replication and transcription, which carried out by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) . The viral RdRp is comprised of the catalytic subunit large (L) polymerase protein and the accessory phosphoprotein (P) (Emerson and Wagner, 1972; Emerson and Yu, 1975) . During transcription, the RdRp complex transcribes the viral genome into five mRNAs in a sequential and gradient manner, such that 3\u2032 proximal genes are transcribed more abundantly than 3\u2032 distal genes (Abraham and Banerjee, 1976; Ball and White, 1976; Villarreal et al., 1976) . These mRNAs are capped and methylated at the 5\u2032 end and polyadenylated at the 3\u2032 end (Iverson and Rose, 1981) . During replication, it yields ventional mechanism is conserved in other families of NNS RNA viruses is not known.",

            "text": "Like the unconventional capping mechanism, methylation of the VSV mRNA cap structure is also unique. Specifically, the G-N-7 and 2'-O methylations of VSV mRNA are accomplished by a single protein: the conserved domain VI of the L protein (Grdzelishvili et al., 2005; Li et al., 2005 Li et al., , 2006 Li et al., , 2007 Li et al., , 2008 ; Rahmeh et al., 2009) . Sequence alignment and structure prediction identified a putative 2'-O MTase in conserved region VI of the L protein (Bujnicki and Rychlewski, 2002; Ferron et al., 2002) . Alterations to the MTase catalytic motif (K-D-K-E) in conserved domain VI of VSV L protein abolished both G-N-7 and 2'-O methylations, suggesting that a single active site is essential for both methylase activities (Li et al., 2005) . This is in contrast to all other known MTases, in which the two activities are catalyzed by either separate proteins (Shuman and Schwer, 1995; Furuichi and Shatkin, 2000) or two different regions in one protein (Reinisch et al., 2000) . Interestingly, substitutions to the SAM binding site of VSV MTase disrupted methylation at the guanine-N-7 (G-N-7) position or at both the G-N-7 and ribose-2'-O (2'-O) positions of the mRNA cap, suggesting that the two methylase activities share one SAM binding site, and methylation of the G-N-7 position is not required for 2'-O methylation . Using purified recombinant L protein and in vitro-synthesized short RNA, it was demonstrated that 2'-O methylation of VSV precedes and facilitates subsequent G-N-7 methylation, and two methylase activities require different RNA sequence and length in methylation . Therefore, VSV cap methylation is mechanistically different from all other known mRNA cap methylation reactions.",

However, this putative substrate binding site has not been suggested for any of the NNS RNA viruses. In this study, we performed further sequence alignment and structure prediction of VSV MTase that suggested several aromatic residues in region VI of VSV L protein as the putative RNA binding site. Subsequently, we performed a systematic mutagenesis analysis of this putative substrate binding site and determined its role in mRNA cap methylation. We demonstrated that the mutation to the aromatic residue abolished both G-N-7 and 2'-O methylations. Although RNA binding has not been directly measured in this study, combined with the structural prediction, our results suggest that these aromatic residues may participate in RNA recognition.",

Sequence alignment showed that there are a number of aromatic residues that are highly conserved in the MTase domain of L proteins (Fig. 1) . Aromatic residues at positions 1650 (Y), 1691(F or Y), and 1835 (Y) are highly conserved in L proteins of NNS RNA viruses although there are some exceptions. For example, these aromatic residues are not conserved in nuclear BDV; 1691(F or Y), and 1835 (Y) are absent in plant rhabdovirus; and 1650 (Y) is not conserved in HRSV (Fig. 1) . Aromatic residues at positions 1742 (W), 1744 (Y), 1745 (F) and 1816 (F) are conserved in the L proteins of Rhabdoviridae and some Paramyxoviridae and Filoviridae. Therefore, these aromatic residues were selected as putative equivalents of Y22, F180, and Y204 in VP39. Unfortunately, there is no amino acid precisely aligned with D182 and E233 in VP39. With the exception of two acidic amino acids in the catalytic site (K1651-D1762-K1795-E1833), position E1764 is also conserved in all L proteins. In addition, D1735 is highly conserved although it is W in L protein of some viruses, such as measles virus (Fig. 1) . Actually, residue D1735 is a part of the SAM binding motif (GxGxG\u2026\u2026D). Previously, we have shown that an alanine substitution for D1735 diminished both G-N-7 and 2'-O methylations to 35% of the level of rVSV . Thus, we targeted E1764 as a candidate for the role of VP39 residues D182 and E233. Finally, other highly conserved amino acid residues (N1692, S1693, P1709, L1757 and S1827) within domain VI of L proteins were also selected for mutagenesis. Previously, a serine residue has been shown to be involved in RNAprotein interaction of E. coli. 2'-O MTase, RRMJ (Hager et al., 2004) . Therefore, we selected the most conserved serine residues (S1693 and S1827) for mutagenesis.",

As shown in Fig. 2C , both F1691A and Y1650A had significant defects in viral replication as compared to that of rVSV. Wild type rVSV reached peak titer (10 9.8 TCID 50 /ml) at 12 h post-infection.

TAP specifically cleaves the pyrophosphate bond of the GpppN cap to yield Gp or, if the cap structure is methylated, 7 m Gp. These products are resolved by TLC on polyethyleneimine (PEI) cellulose F sheets. For rVSV, when transcription reactions were performed in the presence of 1 mM SAM, a fully G-N-7 methylated cap (7 m Gp) was detected after TAP digestion (Fig. 3C , lane 1). This radioactive spot co-migrated with the marker 7 m Gp as visualized by UV shadowing. However, an unmethylated cap (Gp) was detected when the transcription reaction was performed in the presence of 100 \u03bcM SAH (Fig. 3C , lane 2). Quantitative analysis of three independent experiments showed that the total of 14 mutants can be classified into three different groups ( Fig. 3C and D). Viruses in the first group abolished G-N-7 methylation. These viruses included Y1650A, F1691A, and E1764A, which yielded 6.5%, 5.5%, and 8.8% of G-N-7 methylated cap, respectively. Viruses that had a moderate defect in G-N-7 methylation were classified into group 2. These viruses included N1692A, S1693A, F1745A, and S1827A, which yielded 30-60% of G-N-7 methylated cap. Viruses that did not have a significant defect in G-N-7 methylation were classified into group 3. This group includes P1709A, W1744A, L1757A, F1816A, F1816AD, and Y1835A. These data clearly demonstrate that alterations to two aromatic amino acid residues (Y1650A and F1691A) and one acidic residue (E1764A) abolish G-N-7 methylation.",

Recombinants Y1650A, F1691A, and E1764A reduced both G-N-7 and 2'-O methylations to an undetectable level ( Fig. 4A and C) . Recombinants N1692A, S1693A, F1745A, and S1827A were able to synthesize doubly methylated cap. However, the abundance of a fully methylated cap was diminished 30-60%. Viral mutants defective in G-N-7 methylation were also equally defective in 2'-O methylation. Recombinants P1709A, W1744A, L1757A, F1816A, and F1816AD, and Y1835A yielded similar amounts of doubly methylated cap compared to that of rVSV, confirming that they did not affect either G-N-7 or 2'-O methylation ( Fig. 4A and C) . Interestingly, none of the viral mutants was defective only either in G-N-7 or 2'-O methylation. To further confirm these results, we performed additional cap hydrolysis. The RNA samples from rVSV, Y1650A, F1691A and E1764A were digested by RNase T2 and TAP. RNase T2 is an endoribonuclease that cleaves the phosphodiester bonds on the 3' side of A residues. Digestion of the VSV mRNA cap structure with RNase T2 should yield 7 m GpppA m A if the cap structure was doubly methylated. Further digestion of this product by TAP would yield 7 m G and A m A. As shown in Fig. 4D , double digestion of RNA synthesized from rVSV yielded two radioactive spots. The first spot comigrated with the 7 m Gp marker, representing G-N-7 methylation. Presumably, the second spot was A m A, representing 2'-O methylation. The identity of these spots was also consistent with our previous publications (Li et al., 2005 . However, these two spots were undetectable in RNA synthesized from rVSV in the presence of SAH, Y1650A, F1691A, and E1764A (Fig. 4D, lanes 2-5) , confirming that both G-N-7 and 2'-O methylations were abolished. To ensure there is an equivalent amount of RNA synthesized from each mutant, a primer extension assay was performed to detect the first 130 nt of N mRNA. As shown in Fig. 4B , the amount of RNA used for cap hydrolysis is indistinguishable for each mutant. Therefore, these results further confirmed that Y1650A, F1691A, and E1764A lack both G-N-7 and 2'-O methylations.",

If aromatic residues are, indeed, involved in RNA cap recognition, maintenance of the aromatic ring may be essential for mRNA cap methylation. To further demonstrate the role of aromatic residues F1691 and Y1650 in VSV mRNA cap methylation, each of these two aromatic residues were changed to two other possible aromatic residues (Y, W or F) in the VSV infectious clone. A total of four possible mutants (F1691Y, F1691W, Y1650F, and Y1650W) were generated. As shown in Fig. 5A , each of these mutations yielded viable recombinant virus. Interestingly, changing from one aromatic residue to another aromatic residue did not significantly affect the size of viral plaques. All these viruses replicated to high titer in BSRT7 cells, indistinguishable from that of rVSV (Fig. 5B) . In sharp contrast, alanine substitutions for these aromatic residues resulted in recombinant viruses that did not form plaques ( Fig. 2A) and significantly diminished viral replication (Fig. 2C) . These data suggest that maintenance of an aromatic residue at positions 1691 and 1650 is essential for viral replication.",

F1745A had a moderate reduction in methylation. Other aromatic residues (W1742, Y1744, F1816 and Y1835) did not have a significant impact on mRNA cap methylation. To further characterize the role of these amino acids, we monitored the effect of SAM and SAH concentration on mRNA cap methylation of these mutants. Briefly, an increasing amount of either SAM or SAH was added to the in vitro transcription reaction in the presence of [\u03b1-32 P]GTP, RNAs were purified and treated with TAP. For rVSV, a full G-N-7 methylation was achieved when the reaction was performed in the presence of 100 \u03bcM of SAM ( Fig. 7A and B) . In contrast, Y1835A requires a much higher SAM concentration (1 mM) to achieve full G-N-7 methylation ( Fig. 7A  and B) . For rVSV, G-N-7 methylation was completely inhibited when 200 \u03bcM of SAH was added to the reaction (Fig. 7C ). However, Y1835A was much more sensitive to SAH inhibition and G-N-7 methylation was almost completely inhibited by the addition of 20 \u03bcM of SAH (Fig. 7C) . Thus, these experiments show that Y1835A requires higher SAM concentration for methylation and it is more sensitive to an MTase inhibitor. In contrast, alterations to other three aromatic residues (W1742, Y1744 and F1816) resulted in viruses with properties similar to rVSV (data not shown). These results suggest that an alanine substitution for Y1835 alters the affinity of SAM and SAH in mRNA cap methylation.",

Using the prototype rhabdovirus VSV as a model, we performed a systematic mutagenesis analysis of a putative substrate binding site in the MTase region of L polymerase and determined the effect of these changes on VSV mRNA cap methylation. We found that individual amino acid substitutions to two aromatic residues (Y1650 and F1691) and one acidic amino acid residue (E1764) abolished both G-N-7 and 2'-O MTases. Substitution for F1745 resulted in a moderate defect in both methylations. Mutation of Y1835 resulted in recombinant virus that was more sensitive to SAM and SAH concentration. We further demonstrated that MTase-defective viruses also significantly diminished replication in cell culture. These findings suggest that amino acid residues in VSV methylase are essential for both G-N-7 and 2'-O MTases and may function as a putative RNA recognition site.",

            "text": "Sequence alignment and structure prediction suggest that domain VI of VSV L protein shares homology with known 2'-O MTases. We are particularly interested in the highly conserved aromatic amino acids since they may be involved in cap recognition. Among 7 aromatic residues we selected, Y1650 and F1691 were the most critical amino acids essential for mRNA cap methylation. Specifically, alanine substitutions for Y1650 and F1691 abolished both G-N-7 and 2'-O methylation ( Fig. 3C and D) . However, replacement of one aromatic residue with another aromatic residue (Y1650F, Y1650W, F1691Y, and F1691W) did not significantly affect the methyltransferase activities ( Fig. 5C and E) , suggesting that maintenance of the aromatic residue is required for RNA substrate recognition and methylation. Similar to other known 2'-O MTases, these two residues may have a stacking interaction with the mRNA cap that lead to correct positioning of capped RNA into the catalytic site. Based on the predicted structural model for the VSV MTase (amino acid residues from 1644 to 1842 in the L protein) , the residues Y1650 and F1691 are located far from each other with a distance of 17.3 \u00c5 between their alpha carbon atoms. Y1650 is located in the middle of the first helix, and the F1691 is at the very C-terminal of the second helix (Fig. 8A) . Perhaps, a stacking interaction with one aromatic residue causes a conformational and structural change in the VSV methylase, which results in the interaction with another aromatic residue. An alanine substitution for either Y1650 or F1691 may prevent these stacking interactions, which, in turn, affects mRNA methylation. Interestingly, recombinants Y1650A and F1691A were not able to form plaques in either BSRT7 or Vero cells. During the plaque assay, we found that cells in six-well plates were either completely killed or intact without generating regions of cell destruction. However, they were still able to cause cell lysis and produce CPE in both BSRT7 and Vero cells. It is likely that these viruses were replication competent, but had a defect in cell-to-cell spread. In addition, recombinant Y1650A and F1691A synthesized only 50% of viral mRNAs in vitro compared to rVSV ( Fig. 3A and B) . Perhaps, alanine substitution to Y1650 and F1691 may have an effect on the overall folding and/or stability of L protein.",

Substitution of E1764 to A, D, Q or K abolished both G-N-7 and 2'-O methylations (Fig. 6) . The predicted structure of VSV MTase also shows that E1764, the residue adjacent to the catalytic residue D1762, is exposed to the putative SAM binding site. The side chain of E1764 shows close contact to the adenyl group of SAM (3.1 \u00c5) (Fig. 8A) . However, these residues are located at different sides of the cavity of the SAM-binding and catalytic sites. Y1650 and F1691 are on one side, whereas E1764 is on the other, and the side chains of these three residues are all exposed outward from the cavity. E1764 is apart from residues Y1650 and F1691 in the alpha-carbon atom distances of 16.8 and 27.0 \u00c5, respectively. Perhaps, E1764 may be critical for catalysis, SAM binding, or the interaction with the RNA chain, instead of mediating contact with mRNA cap. In addition, we also found that other amino acid substitutions such as N1692A, S1693A and S1827A affected mRNA cap methylation (Fig. 3C) .

If Y1650 and F1691 are the cap recognition site for VSV 2'-O MTase, why does alteration in these amino acid residues also abolish G-N-7 methylation? Perhaps, the simplest explanation is that the order of VSV mRNA cap methylation is unique in which 2'-O methylation is required for G-N-7 methylation Rahmeh et al., 2009) . Thus, inhibition of 2'-O methylation would likely also prevent the G-N-7 methylation. Another model is that aromatic residue Y1650 and F1691 also make contact with the mRNA cap during G-N-7 methylation. Previously, it was thought that no amino acid residue was in direct contact with the guanine-N-7 nucleophile, the SAM methyl carbon, or the SAH sulfur leaving group (Fabrega et al., 2004) . Rather, cap G-N-7 methylation is accomplished by optimally orienting the substrates in proximity to facilitate methyl transfer (Fabrega et al., 2004) . However, a recent structural study of vaccinia G-N-7 MTase revealed that aromatic residues (Y555 and F556) play a critical role in G-N-7 methylation (De la Pena et al., 2007; Zheng and Shuman, 2008a,b) . These aromatic amino acids stabilize binding to the catalytic site and facilitate the precise positioning of the methyl donor. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that Y1650 and F1691 play a role in stabilizing the binding of VSV MTase to the cap during G-N-7 methylation.",

In the case of reovirus, two methylase activities are located in two different domains in a single protein and each domain possesses a SAM binding motif (Reinisch et al., 2000) . To date, rhabdovirus VSV and flavivirus WNV are the two best characterized viruses that utilize a single region in the polymerase protein for both G-N-7 and 2'-O methylations. However, the mechanism of VSV mRNA methylation is distinct from that of the WNV system. In VSV, 2'-O methylation precedes and facilitates subsequent G-N-7 methylation Rahmeh et al., 2009) . However, WNV MTases modify the cap structure, first at the G-N-7 position and subsequently at the ribose 2'-O position (Ray et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2007; Dong et al., 2007) . In VSV, G-N-7 and 2'-O MTases require similar conditions for methylation with an optimal pH at 7.0 . In contrast, G-N-7 and 2'-O MTases of WNV require an optimal pH at 6.5 and 10, respectively (Ray et al., 2006) . Both VSV and WNV MTases modify the RNA in a sequence-specific manner, but require different elements in the RNA substrate. VSV G-N-7 and 2'-O MTases require specific gene start sequences with a minimum mRNA length of 10 nucleotides (Wang et al., 2007; Rahmeh et al., 2009) . In the WNV model, N-7 cap methylation requires specific nucleotides at the second and third positions and a 5' stem-loop structure within the 74-nucleotide viral RNA; in contrast, 2'-O ribose methylation requires specific nucleotides at the first and second positions, with a minimum 5' viral RNA of 20 nucleotides .",

            "text": "In this study, we found that there is another striking difference in the cap recognition site between VSV and WNV MTases. In WNV MTase, the cap recognition site is essential for 2'-O, but not G-N-7 methylation (Dong et al., 2008) . Consistent with this, GTP and cap analogs specifically inhibited 2'-O, but not G-N-7 methylation (Dong et al., 2008) . It was proposed that WNV MTase catalyzes two methylations through a substrate-repositioning mechanism, in which the G-N-7 methylated cap is repositioned to the cap binding site for 2'-O methylation upon binding (Dong et al., 2008) . However, it is unlikely that the RNA substrate binding site functions as a switching point for VSV MTase since substitutions to this site abolished both G-N-7 and 2'-O methylations. In agreement with this hypothesis, GTP and cap analogs did not affect VSV mRNA cap methylation in vitro (Li et al., unpublished observation) . Previously, we and others have performed extensive mutagenesis analysis in the MTase catalytic and SAM binding sites (Li et al., 2005 Grdzelishvili et al., 2005; . Some of the mutants (G1670A and G1672A) in the SAM binding site were defective in G-N-7, but not 2'-O methylation . Interestingly, none of the mutants were specifically defective in 2'-O, but G-N-7 methylation. Most likely, the cap recognition site in VSV MTase plays an essential role in stacking the cap of the RNA substrate during 2'-O methylation and possibly stabilizes the RNA-MTase complex during G-N-7 methylation. Overall, the mechanism of VSV mRNA cap methylation is significantly different that of WNV, although both of them encode dual MTase activities in a single domain in viral polymerase proteins. Most recently, it was found that capping of flavivirus RNA is catalyzed by conventional RNA guanylyltransferase via a covalent GMP-enzyme intermediate (Issur et al., 2009 ). However, VSV capping is catalyzed by a novel polyribonucelotidyltransferase (PRNTase) (Ogino and Banerjee, 2007; Li et al., 2008; Koonin and Moss, 2010) . These studies suggest that VSV and perhaps other NNS RNA viruses have evolved a unique mechanism to add the cap to their mRNA and to methylate the cap structure.",

We identified two aromatic amino acid residues that are essential for both G-N-7 and 2'-O methylation and may play a critical role in the stacking interaction with mRNA cap. Clearly, unraveling of the crystal structure of VSV MTase will provide more mechanistic insight to this unusual mRNA cap methylation. We also showed that mutations to the putative RNA substrate recognition site significantly diminished viral replication. These findings suggest that mRNA cap methylation is an attractive antiviral target for NNS RNA viruses.",

Using pVSV1(+) as a template, the coding sequence in the L gene was modified by sitedirected mutagenesis using the QuikChange methodology (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The presence of the desired mutation was confirmed by sequence analysis of a 2-kb region of pVSV1(+) that spanned from FseI site to an HindIII site. The pVSV1(+) variants were digested with FseI and HindIII, and the resulting 2-kb fragment was subcloned back into pVSV1(+) at the same sites. This approach ensured that no other sequence alterations were introduced during the mutagenesis reaction. Using this method, a total of sixteen L gene mutations was generated.",

Briefly, recombinant VSV was recovered by co-transfection of pVSV (+), pN, pP, and pL into BSRT7 cells infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus (vTF7-3) expressing T7 RNA polymerase (Fuerst et al., 1986) . At 96 h posttransfection, cell culture fluids were collected, filtered through 0.2 \u03bcM filter, and recombinant virus was further amplified in BSRT7 cells. Subsequently, the viruses were plaque purified. Viral plaque assay was performed in Vero cells as described previously (Whelan et al., 1995) . Individual plaques were isolated, and seed stocks were amplified on BSRT7 cells. To generate large stocks, plaque purified viruses were inoculated into 10 confluent T150 flask BSRT7 cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 in a volume of 2 ml of Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM). At 1 h postadsorption, 15 ml of DMEM (supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum) was added to the cultures, and infected cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 to 48 h. Cell culture fluids were harvested when extensive cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed. Cell culture fluids were clarified by centrifugation at 3,000 \u00d7g for 10 min. Virus was concentrated by centrifugation at 40,000 \u00d7g for 90 min at 4\u00b0C in a Ty 50.2 rotor.

The final pellet was resuspended in 0.3 ml of NTE buffer. The virus titer was determined by plaque assay in Vero cells, and the protein content was measured by the Bradford assay (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). The L genes of the purified viruses were sequenced again, and these stocks were used for in vitro transcription reactions.",
