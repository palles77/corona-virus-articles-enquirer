In April 2014 the General Medical Council (GMC) approved a Combined Infection Training (CIT) curriculum, designed jointly by the Royal College of Pathologists and the Joint Royal College of Physicians Training Board (JRCPTB). The new scheme recognizes the common competencies of existing infection specialties and combines their training curricula. National recruitment to CIT commenced in August of this year. 1 The Royal College of Pathologists' stated aim was to 'design a training programme which brought medical microbiology, medical virology and infectious diseases closer together'. 2 However, many infection specialists have questioned the motivation for change and remain apprehensive about the truncation of two training schemes.",

Trainees on the previous scheme would spend most (if not all) of their training in a clinical microbiology department; this will be reduced to as little as two-and-a-half years during CIT. Many IPC incidents (e.g. admission of a patient with novel coronavirus infection, a CPE patient cluster, or increase in Clostridium difficile incidence) occur unexpectedly and sporadically. By reducing training time, trainees will spend less time working in IPC teams, witness fewer IPC incidents, and experience fewer IPC investigations. They will have less time to immerse themselves in strategic quality improvement (e.g. reducing incidence of device-related Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia), surveillance schemes (e.g. postoperative surgical site), policy writing, and attending water safety/decontamination meetings. Whereas knowledge of health technical memoranda, national guidelines, and an understanding of pathogen transmission are undoubtedly critical, the medical doctrine of 'see one, do one, teach one' remains essential in IPC. Much of the learning is by observation of senior colleagues and CIT reduces trainees' exposure to this.",

The World Health Organization has recognized antimicrobial resistance as one of the leading threats to human health. 4 Issues such as carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis are growing challenges for IPC practitioners within the NHS. The surveillance, early detection, and control of such organisms are becoming increasingly complex. Globalization brings distant threats to the NHS and our patient population is becoming more susceptible to healthcare-acquired infection. The use of invasive devices and iatrogenic immunosuppression is growing and the UK has an ageing population with increasing prevalence of comorbidities (e.g. obesity, diabetes mellitus). 5, 6 The technologies available for IPC practitioners are increasingly sophisticated too. Tools such as mass spectrometry, real-time PCR, ribotyping, and whole genome sequencing can allow rapid detection of alert organisms and shed light on routes of transmission. An understanding of the role of such laboratory tests, their characteristics (e.g. sensitivity, predictive values), limitations, and pitfalls are critical. Without a sound understanding of these tests, interpretation of results can be difficult at best and misleading at worst. It is therefore crucial that trainees have sufficient access to laboratories performing such tests during their training to develop competencies. By reducing access, trainees will be less familiar with the rapidly evolving tools available to IPC teams.",

The exception is Higher Specialist Scientific Training (HSST) as part of modernizing scientific careers: 'a five-year work based programme supported by an underpinning part-time doctoral level programme'. 8 IPC competencies and techniques feature heavily on the HSST curriculum and include areas such as surveillance and epidemiology of healthcare-acquired infection, disinfection and sterilization, ventilation, and reporting of incidents. However, the number of microbiology or virology HSST trainees is very small.
