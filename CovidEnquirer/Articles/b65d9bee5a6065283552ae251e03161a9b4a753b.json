As a result, several defi nitional problems arise, such as how to diff erentiate research within budgets and how to allocate expenditure to disease categories. Instead, we adopt a revealed preference approach, comparing allocations within the budget of WHO, which are decided by its member states (including both donor and recipient countries) acting through the World Health Assembly-a uniquely representative organisation, providing a forum for 193 governments to infl uence the global health agenda-with WHO's extra-budgetary resources, which are established by a much smaller group of donors (including governments of rich countries and philanthropists). 7 We focus on the budget of WHO because, although it is only one of many sources of funds for global health and research, it has an important normative role. Furthermore, unlike many state and non-state donors, it has a global perspective and covers all aspects of human health. For both these reasons it provides a unique opportunity to understand the priority that is given to diff erent disease categories worldwide.",

The data sources and detailed calculations of these measures are described elsewhere. 18 In brief, in this Article we used the WHO's three broad categories of International Classifi cation of Diseases (ICD) codes that are used in the Global Burden of Disease project. Infectious disease refers to the type-I group of communicable, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional disorders (although not exclusively infectious diseases, these are overwhelmingly dominant, accounting for roughly four-fi fths of this category, expressed both as burden of disease and WHO expenditure); noncommunicable disease refers to the type-II cluster of chronic disorders; and injuries and violence consist of WHO's type-III cluster (WHO, 2004). The table summarises how WHO's so-called areas of work, or aggregated budget lines, from the fi nancial reports were matched to each of the infectious disease, chronic disease, and injury and violence burden of disease clusters. We identifi ed 14 budget lines for infectious diseases, fi ve for non-communicable diseases, and one for injuries and violence. For disease clusters such as nutrition and food safety that might have applied to infectious or non-communicable disease, we analysed the descriptions of the work in the WHO programme budget to identify the appropriate disease cluster.

WHO member states pledge to commit a specifi ed proportion of the total assessed contributions, which is calculated according to each country's wealth and population size.

For the same reason, international development assistance understandably concentrates on Africa and, within it, on the leading causes of disease. However, other regions worldwide still have a substantial burden of poverty and disease, although less than that in Africa. One such region is the Western Pacifi c region as defi ned by WHO, where almost three-quarters of all deaths are attributable to non-communicable diseases. In Africa, the burden of disease is almost the reverse: less than a quarter of mortality is from non-communicable diseases, and roughly three-quarters is from infectious diseases. Does WHO allocate a substantially greater fraction of the available funds to non-communicable diseases in the Western Pacifi c region than in the African region? Figure 2 shows the distribution of WHO's budgetary allocations across the three major burden of disease clusters in the African and Western Pacifi c regions in 2004-05. In both regions, the resources were heavily skewed toward infectious diseases. In the African region, infectious diseases received almost all funds, with non-communicable diseases and injuries receiving very small proportions of the overall funds allocated by WHO to the region. The trend for the Western Pacifi c region was nearly the same (fi gure 2). To further investigate whether the recorded mismatch between the disease burden and allocated funds can be attributed to the diff erential allocation of assessed contributions, which are decided on by member states, and voluntary contributions, which are determined by donors, we compared the distribution of each.",

Much of this growth has been driven by increasing funding from countries from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and, in recent years, from private philanthropic foundations, such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Since these foundations have increased the contribution to WHO's budget, the private for-profi t sector's direct contribution to WHO's extra-budgetary funds has dropped substantially, from 5% in 2000-01 to less than 1% in 2006-07. Figure 3 shows the sources of WHO's extra-budgetary funds in 2006-07. Most funds come from member states, and, as shown in webtable 3, more than four-fi fths of this money is donated by high-income countries that are not substantial recipients of the funds. Of the other sources, the three highest contributors were the UN, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the European Commission, together contributing half the funds from sources other than those received directly from member states (the fi rst and last of these contributors are essentially conduits for funds from member states). 15 years ago, direct funding by member states accounted for roughly four-fi fths of extra-budgetary funds. Nowadays that amount has fallen to 40%, with the greatest rises coming from UN organisations (21% in 2006-07 versus 5% in 1992-93) and public and private foundations such as the Gates Foundation and Rotary International (15% in 2006-07). 7 Webtable 3 shows the ten member states and the ten non-member states that contributed the most to WHO's extra-budgetary funds.",

Of WHO's regular budget, 61% of funds were allocated to infectious diseases, whereas 38% were allocated to noncommunicable diseases and roughly 1% to injuries. Of the WHO's extra-budgetary funds, 91% went to infectious disease, 8% to non-communicable disease, and about 1% to injuries.

First, the health priorities expressed by the world's health ministries-through their decisions at the World Health Assembly about WHO's regular budget, and those of the international donor community, which are expressed by the international donor community through its contributions to WHO's extrabudgetary funds-give greater weight to a death from an infectious disease than to one from a noncommunicable disease. Deaths from injuries are given even less weight. Second, and very importantly, the regular budget of WHO is actually more closely aligned with the burden of disease than are extra-budgetary funds. The regular budget indicates the views of all countries whereas extra-budgetary funds are driven by the wealthy donor countries, industry, and philanthropists. The obvious implication is that extra-budgetary funds are misaligned with the health needs of the main recipients of WHO's activities.",

These considerations obviously apply to diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian infl uenza, thus justifying expenditure on them even though the current burden of disease attributable to them is zero for SARS and negligible for avian infl uenza from a global perspective. Some other infectious diseases share this potential, such as cholera, but most do not, either because they are limited geographically by the distribution of vectors or other factors, or because eff ective control programmes are already in place. Another consideration is the economic burden of disease. The WHO Commission on Macroeconomics and Health drew attention to the economic eff ects of the common diseases affl icting the poorest countries in sub-Saharan Africa, which are dominated by infections. 19 However, evidence is growing for the substantial economic consequences of noncommunicable diseases. 20, 21 The diseases do not seem to diff er substantially with regard to their eff ect on the economy.",
