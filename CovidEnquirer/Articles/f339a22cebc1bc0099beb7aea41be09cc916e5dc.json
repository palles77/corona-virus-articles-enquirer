            "text": "The Arenaviridae is a large family of viruses causing both acute and persistent infections and causing significant public health concerns in afflicted regions. A \"trademark\" of infection is the quick and efficient immuno-suppression mediated in part by a 3'-5' RNA exonuclease domain (ExoN) of the Nucleoprotein (NP). Mopeia virus, the eastern African counterpart of Lassa virus, carries such ExoN domain, but does not suppress the host innate immunity. We have recently reported the crystal structure of the Mopeia virus ExoN domain, which presents a conserved fold and active site. In the present study, we show that the ExoN activity rules out a direct link between ExoN activity and alteration of the host innate immunity. We found that the Arenavirus ExoN, however, is able to excise mis-incorporated bases present at the 3'-end of double stranded RNA.",

The remaining ExoN(-) virus population showed an increased base substitution rate on a narrow nucleotide spectrum, linking the ExoN activity to genome editing. Since, the Arenavirus ExoN belongs to the same nuclease family as that of the nsp14 coronavirus ExoN ; which has been recently shown to promote viral RNA synthesis proofreading; we propose that Arenavirus ExoN is involved in a \"limited RNA editing\" mechanism mainly controlled by structural constraints and a low mutational/fitness ratio.",

After removing the 1 st 4 nucleotides, degradation stops at the loop region. A similar experiment in the presence of Mn 2+ allows further degradation into the loop, whereas ExoN is inactive in the presence of either Zn 2+ or Ca 2+ . The laddering degradation pattern visualized on the gel, together with radio-label quantification indicate that it acts in the 3'-5' direction (S2B Fig). Visual examination of degradation kinetics shows, a band-product accumulation prior to G nucleotides, indicating that the latter are slower to remove than Cs. We also tested the ExoN activity of the ExoN domain of NP-LCMV (NP-exo LCMV) (Fig 1A) on the same RNA substrate. Both proteins cleave the RNA following a similar degradation pattern and comparable kinetics (S2B Fig   and S3 Table) . The two ExoNs exhibit their highest activity in the presence of Mn 2+ , followed by Mg 2+ and they are inactive in the presence of either Ca 2+ or Zn 2+ or EDTA (Fig 1A ) . These results show that the nature of the ions is altering the ExoN activity and its associated pattern of degradation can be greatly modulated by the nature of the metal ion co-factor.",

Positive Tm shifts are observed in the presence of MnCl 2 (+16.5 \u00b0C), MgCl 2 (+4.9 \u00b0C), CaCl 2 (+7.5 \u00b0C) and a slight negative shift in ZnCl 2 (-2.2 \u00b0C) (Fig 2) .

On the other hand, at position 1021, the serine observed in MOPV subset does not represent the majority of the observed amino acid in the other subsets, the proline is by far the most frequent amino acids found (Fig 7) . In The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/541698 doi: bioRxiv preprint LASV, the serine subset represents only 3% of the observed amino acids at this position while 10% in the MAMV subset (Fig 7) . This observation indicates that this position in MOPV is an oddity compared to the others. It seems that the natural tendency in the L protein is to have a proline rather than a serine at this position. The fact that we observe that particular reversion in the NP-Exo(-) could indicate that for L MOPV there is a constraint at this particular position. Finally, at position 1477, the amino acid found at this position for the three subsets is a leucine (Fig 7) , indicating that, that particular position is under a high selective pressure. The mutation L1477S was never observed in any subsets, this mutation can be interpreted as unlikely and therefore considered as direct consequence of the NP-Exo(-).",

Several reports have demonstrated that NP is responsible for the degradation of these ds RNAs using the 3'-5' ExoN located at its C-terminus [25, 32, 35, 63] . This ExoN comprises a DEDDh catalytic motif that is completely conserved across the Arenaviridae [35] implying this activity may be a general feature of arenavirus NPs. The ExoN domain is conserved within the family regardless of both the virus pathogenic potential and its ability to suppress efficiently type I IFN, as previously reported for TCRV and MOPV [42, 60, 64] . MOPV is the closest counterpart of 18 386 387 LASV and presents a 73% NP sequence identity with LASV. During LASV infections, the virus targets mainly macrophages (MP) and dendritic (DC) cells [65] , and infections are characterized by high viremia and generalized immune suppression supposedly due to innate immune inhibition by the ExoN domain. Both MOPV and LASV induces strong type I IFN responses in MP and moderately in DC, but contrarily to LASV which abrogates this response, MOPV does not [42, 64] .",

It is also clear from the structure-ion analysis [43] , that toying with the catalytic ion leads to slight structural changes which impact dramatically [61] , correlated innate immunity suppression to ExoN mutants, postulating a direct involvement of the ExoN activity. We observed that mutant D382A completely loses ExoN activity consistently with results from reverse genetic studies [61] . A noticeable difference concern the mutant E384A, that was shown to have no effect and be dispensable for ExoN activity [61] , is rather shown critical in our in vitro study and consistent with the structural data as E384 (equivalent to MOPV E392) is involved in binding one of the catalytic ion (S4 Fig). Under our conditions, D459A and H517A still retains their ability to cleave two nucleotides meanwhile D522A shows a significant activity leading to the removal of two to three nucleotides. Theses latter three mutants were not reported before but the analysis of the structure of NP-exo MOPV confirms that major features such as fold, and the two ion binding sites (catalytic and structural) are conserved within the Arenaviridae [25, 32, 35, 36, 63] . Residues D390, E392, D534 of NP-exo MOPV directly coordinate the catalytic ion. Mutation of these residues logically alter ion binding and thus leads to complete loss of catalytic activity. The residual activity observed for D522A of NP-exo LCMV is rather difficult to explain as the two structures present no clear differences in the ion binding mode. ExoNs [36, 43] . Therefore MOPV ExoN activity alone is not per se responsible for the differences in innate immunity suppression between MOPV and LASV. Rather, the presence of the ExoN activity may serve other purposes in the viral life cycle, which might be connected directly or indirectly to innate immunity.",

The structural relatedness with the Coronavirus ExoN and its implication in viral replication prompted us to investigate to which extend the arenavirus ExoN domain is able to excise unpaired nucleotides. Our enzyme activity assays demonstrate that NP-exo MOPV and NP-exo LCMV can efficiently and selectively cleave a ds RNA mimicking an erroneous replication product carrying one 3'-mismatched nucleotide (Fig 4) . Our analysis confirms that despite additional inserted structural elements, the two domains belong to the same Ribonuclease H-like superfamily. In the case of Coronaviridae, several studies have pointed to a main role of the ExoN domain of nsp14 in RNA proofreading [47] [48] [49] [50] to maintain genome stability. Structural comparison between ExoN domain of nsp14 and MOPV shows conservation of active site and main fold (Fig 5) suggesting that they have a distant but common origin. Recent work by Becares and colleagues have shown that nsp14 of Coronavirus is also involved in innate immunity modulation [68] . Therefore, these data show that at least in mutations / kb. This means that the polymerase was able to incorporate a mismatch and then elongate it. The error rate does not change between the WT and the mutant, which is consistent with the fact that we did not altered the polymerase. For both, these mutations appears along the entire L segment at an average frequency of ~10.1 % (comprised between 5 to 24 %) for the WT and of 16.6 % (comprised between 5 to 93 %) for the mutant. The fact that unlikely mutants have become prevalent, as observed at passage 10, reflect that the control over certain type of mutation have been abolished, thus implicating that ExoN is active on its own genomic RNA. In this study, it is not the particular set of mutations that is relevant but rather that a set of unlikely mutations have emerged.",

Our results shows a clear diminution of the viral titer for viruses depleted of ExoN activity, but no clear evidence of a drastic increase of mutation in the genome that would lead to catastrophic event. Then what is happening in these mutated viruses? One tentative explanation could be the ExoN is involved in : i) checking and maintaining the sequence integrity of the conserved genomic region at its extremities, and/or ii) the structural integrity of the Intergenic Region (IGR). Indeed, both regions have been previously reported as being critical for viral fitness: i) The conserved region (19 nucleotides) exhibit high degree of sequence conservation at the 3'-termini and is complementary to the 5' end of scenario in which the polymerase is able to incorporate a mismatch but is unable to elongate it, leading to a decrease of suitable genomic material to package, therefore without the ExoN control the number of functional RNP would be reduced and consistent with the loss of viral fitness observed here and else [61, 67] . Therefore we propose that the Arenavirus ExoN is involved in a \"limited proof-reading\" mechanism driven by structural constraints rather than genomic stability.",

Ribavirin is the only drug so far administered on large scale and having demonstrated a decrease of mortality rates up to 5%, if administered within the first 6 days of arenaviral illness [73] . On the other hand, Ribavirin is ineffective against coronaviruses [74, 75] , as nsp14 ExoN domain excises the nucleotide analogue [51] . It is likely, that for Arenaviridae, the ExoN activity involved in a \"limited proof-reading\" mechanism remains as a trace of its past common ancestor with Coronaviridae. The critical problem of genomic stability being solved, either by the conservation of the \"original\" function of the ExoN for Coronaviridae, or by genome segmentation for Arenaviridae.",

The residual activity observed for D467 (D459 of LCMV) is rather difficult to explain as the two structures present no clear differences, yet that residue is very likely involved in the cleavage mechanism. Indeed, the kinetic experiments comparing the WT NP-exo MOPV and NP-exo LCMV to corresponding mutants show that the first event of the hydrolysis is comparable between NP-exo MOPV and NP-exo LCMV, while mutation of the aspartate reduces drastically the hydrolysis kinetics for NP-exo MOPV but only moderatelyfor NP-exo LCMV (S3 Fig). These differences suggest that the aspartate (respectively D467, D459) is involved in the structural set-up of the active site for positioning the ion responsible for the nucleophilic attack. The general mechanism for RNA hydrolysis is a two metal ion mechanism described by Steitz and Steitz [66]. It involves metal A and B positioned ~4 \u00c5 apart each other and across the target phosphodiester bond. Metal ion A facilitates the formation of the attacking nucleophile. This is followed by the formation of a penta-covalent intermediate which is stabilized by both metal ions. Metal ion B then eases the exit of the leaving group. With the help of the LASV structures of Jiang and collaborator [36], we made an attempt to reconstitute a model of the general mechanism for RNA hydrolysis (S5A Fig). In NP-exo MOPV structure (and all the others) only the metal B is visible. The site receiving the other catalytic metal A is partly created with interaction of the RNA and residues D390 and D467 (S5B Fig). The interaction between the ion in position A andD467 is mediated through a water molecule. Therefore, this might explain why this mutant retained a partial residual activity. was shown for TCRV, the ExoN domain of MOPV in vitro is endowed with full ExoN activity and obeys to the same structural and energetic constraints as those of other Arenaviridae",
