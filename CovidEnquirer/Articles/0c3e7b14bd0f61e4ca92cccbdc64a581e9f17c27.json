Objectives: We assessed the proportion of RVs and their impact on the outcome of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in the intensive care unit (ICU). Study design: Cases of HAP were retrospectively selected among patients who underwent screening for RVs by multiplex PCR (mPCR) in the ICU of a French tertiary care hospital from May 2014 to April 2016. ICU length of stay and in-hospital mortality were compared between four groups defined according to the identified pathogens: virus only (V), virus/bacteria (V/B), bacteria only (B) and no pathogen (Neg). When available, previous mPCR was retrieved in order to assess possible chronic viral carriage. Results: Overall, 95/999 (10%) ICU patients who underwent mPCR had HAP (V(17,18%), V/B(13,14%), B (60,63%), Neg(5,5%)). Median age was 61 years and 45 (47%) were immunocompromised. Influenza (27%) and rhinovirus (27%) were the most common RVs. V/B group had higher mortality rate than B and V groups (62% vs. 40% and 35%, p = 0.3) and a significantly longer length of stay (31 days (18-48)) than V group (5 days (3-11), p = 0.0002)) and B group (14.5 days (5.5-25.5), p = 0.007)). Among the 15 patients with available mPCR tests before viral HAP, seven were negative and eight were positive corresponding to long-term carriage of community-acquired viruses. Discussion: RVs were detected in 32% of HAP patients who underwent mPCR. Two situations were encountered: (i) acute acquired viral infection; (ii) long-term viral carriage (mostly rhinovirus) especially in immunocompromised patients complicated by a virus/bacteria coinfection. The latter was associated with a longer length of stay and a trend toward a higher mortality.",

            "text": "Respiratory viruses (RVs) are known to constitute a large burden in community-acquired respiratory infections [1] [2] [3] [4] . With regards to nosocomial infections, RVs (excluding herpes simplex virus (HSV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV)) have traditionally been paid little attention, except in hematopoietic stem cell or solid organ transplant recipients [5, 6] . Although hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is the second most common nosocomial infection in the developed countries and is associated with high mortality and morbidity [7, 8] , it has always been seen to be driven by bacteria, with no role of RVs [9] . However, in a recent South Korean study 22.5% of cases of HAP were related to viral infections, and 59.5% to bacterial infections. This finding, showing a non-negligible role of viruses, can be explained by recent improvements in detection methods and needs to be explored further. Indeed, improvements in the sensitivity of detection techniques such as multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) have greatly enhanced the ability to detect RVs [10, 11] . However, data on the frequency and role of RVs in HAPs and especially their outcome are still scarce. Apart from influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), other viruses are not usually investigated because of weak evidence of their pathogenicity, lack of available treatment, and the high cost of mPCR tests. Furthermore, the role of viral-bacterial coinfection is still unclear in pneumonia and all of the few investigations using mPCR were conducted on community-acquired pneumonia presenting viral-bacterial coinfection and yielded divergent data on pathogenicity and prognosis [2, [12] [13] [14] .",

All medical records of patients who underwent mPCR assay for RVs during an ICU stay from May 1, 2014 to April 31, 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with community-acquired pneumonia or with a diagnosis other than pneumonia were excluded. Only adult patients diagnosed with HAP who underwent screening for RVs at the time of suspected pneumonia were included in the study. When multiple episodes of HAP occurred in the same patient, only the first episode was taken into consideration. Patients included were classified in one of the following four groups according to the microorganisms identified from specimens collected within 72 h after the diagnosis of pneumonia: virus only, bacteria only, virus/bacteria and no pathogens. Of note, the use of mPCR for respiratory virus screening in the ICU of the Bichat-Claude Bernard Hospital is not systematic and is left at physician's discretion. Its use that started in 2013 and was at first limited to immunocompromised patients has progressively expanded over the years. We compared characteristics of those who did not undergo screening for RVs to those who underwent and were included in the study. For this we identified the total number of HAP that occurred during the study period in the ICU using the primary diagnosis coded according to the Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD10).",

However, clinical evidence from prospective studies on the role of coinfection in severity is somewhat conflicting [2, 14, 25, 26] . In our study it should be underlined that all eight HAP cases with long-term shedding of community-acquired viruses involved immunocompromised patients with coinfection with other pathogens. Shedding of rhinoviruses for more than 4 weeks is not uncommon even in immunocompetent individuals [27] and especially in patients with immunodeficiency in whom chronic rhinovirus carriage for as long as 4-12 months has been documented [28] . The significance of rhinovirus detection in respiratory specimens from pneumonia patients is a subject of some debate. Some findings have demonstrated that rhinovirus infection alters the respiratory microbiome and may precipitate secondary bacterial infections in patients with COPD [29, 30] .",

Virus distribution, viral-bacterial coinfection rate, and patient prognosis differed greatly from long-term virus shedding cases. Our findings support the possible nosocomial transmission of various RVs and not only influenza and RSV in debilitated patients who have prolonged hospitalizations [31, 32] , and highlight the need for infection control measurements targeted at health care personnel and family members to control further hospital transmission.",

Second, during the study period, mPCR testing for RVs was not systematic in the ICU, but was left instead to the clinician's discretion, which may have led to selection bias and to an underestimation of the total number of cases of HAP in admitted patients to the ICU or occurring in the ICU. We tried to overcome this issue by estimating the total number of HAP during the study period and comparing characteristics of patients with HAP who underwent RVs screening and those who did not. The group of patients who underwent RVs screening were more frequently immunocompromised. Third, the 48-h delay traditionally used for the definition of nosocomial cases is derived from data concerning bacteria. This delay may not be appropriate for RVs for which incubation and shedding data are still partial in these populations and can differ from one virus to another. Most authors agree to a median delay for symptoms of 2-7 days for all RVs [33] . We used previous RV tests done before HAP diagnosis when available to try to overcome this issue. Finally, our study design prevented assessment of the pathogenic role of RVs. However, the fact that all RVs were obtained from BAL fluid or ETA argues in favor of their active role.",

The latter seems to be associated with poorer outcomes compared with bacteria only or virus only pneumonia. RVs found in HAP could be divided in two categories: (i) community-acquired viruses with chronic shedding (i.e. mainly rhinovirus) in immunocompromised patients, associated with other microorganisms at the time of HAP, and (ii) hospitalacquired viruses (RSV, parainfluenza, influenza and human metapneumovirus) in debilitated patients with prolonged hospitalization. Our retrospective data did not demonstrate a causal relationship between viral shedding and outcome, but emphasize the need for further systematic prospective studies to assess the temporality and consequences of both viral infections and viral/bacterial coinfection.",
