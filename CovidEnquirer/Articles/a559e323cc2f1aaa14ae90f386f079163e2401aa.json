These lmwPEGs have either linear or ring-shaped conformations, each set comprising 2,113 and 1,404 lmwPEGs, respectively. For each PDB structure, we generated its symmetry related molecules with Pymol [1] . The lmwPEGs were further grouped into intra-unit and inter-unit PEGs. A lmwPEG is regarded to be inter-unit if it contacts \u22652 molecules from different asymmetric units within a 4.5 \u00c5 distance; conversely, it is an intraunit PEG if it only interacts with molecules within a single asymmetric unit. Ring-shaped lmwPEGs contain 969 (69.0%) inter-and 435 (31.0%) intra-unit PEGs, while linear lmwPEGs contain 1,214 (57.5%) inter-and 899 (42.5%) intra-unit PEGs.",

First, protein models were completed by manually modeling the disordered loop spanning amino acids 33 to 44 using Coot. Subsequently, the structure was subjected to ten cycles of phasefree restrained refinement using Refmac5 [9] . Further, since the full PEG molecule was not defined in the 2ZR5 crystal structure, nona-ethylene glycol and dodecaethylene glycol were modeled into it as roughly equivalent to the PEG400 and PEG500 average sizes. Next, files were prepared for simulation using the H++ server [18] . The resulting reasonable protonation predictions at pH 7.5 were manually added into the original files. For in-crystal simulations, the P3121 unit cell was constructed using UCSF Chimera [11] , including all crystallographic waters and ligands (i.e. waters and ligands whose positions could be experimentally determined during structure solution and refinement). For the in-solution simulations, samples were prepared in the same way but with just one water-free protein molecule.",

The only exception were the crown ethers, which, due to a rotational motion along the ring's center, had artificially increased RMSD, and per-atom B-factors. Consequently, we calculated a dummy atom with coordinates corresponding to the center of mass (com) of each crown ether molecule, and then calculated their RMSF values. Accordingly, crown ether RMSDs presented in this work refer to crown ether com RMSDs, and were not calculated for each crown-ether atom independently.
