To improve sensitivity, a second seminested reaction with 2.5 \u00b5L outer product and NP-1 as1 primer and NP-1 s2 (5\u2032-CTCACCTGCGAGCTCTG-TAAGTA) primer was performed at an annealing temperature of 55\u00b0C. Negative controls were used, and appropriate measures were taken to prevent contamination (7) . Samples with an NP-1-specific PCR product of 368 bp were confirmed by amplifying a 980-bp product of the VP1/2 capsid gene in a similar seminested PCR amplification protocol (primers VP s1 5\u2032-GCACTTCTGTATCAGAT-GCCTT, VP as1 5\u2032-CGTGGTATG-TAGGCGTGTAG, and VP s2 5\u2032-C T TA G A A C T G G T G A G A G -CACTG). A selection of the inner VP1/2 amplicons obtained from samples taken over the year were sequenced directly and aligned in ClustalX, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed with the Kimura 2-parameter neighbor-joining method with 1,000 bootstrap resamplings. Comparative sequences were obtained from GenBank and included HBoV isolate st1 (DQ000495), HBoV isolate st2 (DQ000496), and a CnMV isolate (NC_004442). Nucleotide sequences from this study were deposited into GenBank (DQ317539-DQ317561).",

A diagnosis of pneumonia or lower respiratory tract infection was made for 30 (86%) children. Thirteen (37%) HBoV-positive children required admission to the inten-sive care unit. Comorbid conditions were present in 22 children: cystic fibrosis (1), spinal muscular atrophy type 1 (4), Down syndrome (4), cardiac abnormalities (5) , and HIV infection (8) . Co-infection with a range of viral and bacterial organisms was a common feature in HBoV-positive children and was found in 14 (37%) samples. These organisms included cytomegalovirus (4), respiratory syncytial virus (2), adenovirus (1), HCoV NL63 (1), parainfluenza 3 (1), Staphylococcus aureus (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), and Pneumocystis jirovecii (2) .

Outbreak case finding involved local laboratories and genitourinary medicine physicians in London, as well as the national reference laboratory. A case was considered confirmed if S. sonnei PTQ was isolated from January 2004 through April 2005, and the patient had not traveled outside the country the week before illness. Possible cases were defined as for confirmed cases but were so designated when patient had a history of foreign travel in the week before illness or when travel history was unknown. From October 2004, when we became aware of the outbreak, until December 2004, we conducted telephone interviews with newly identified case-patients. For cases that occurred before October 2004, and from January 2005 through April 2005, information was obtained from laboratory records only.",

The scheme consists of 11 phages and is based on the typing of the rough phase II variant of S. sonnei. The scheme comprises defined phage types (PT) 1-100 and provisional PTs A-P. Cultures were grown overnight on MacConkey agar, and a rough colony was placed in nutrient broth and grown for 18 hours at 37\u00b0C. The broth culture was then used to flood a nutrient agar plate and, once dry, spotted with the 11 phages and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 5 hours. The patterns of lysis were recorded and compared with those indicated on the typing chart.
