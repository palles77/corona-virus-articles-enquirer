The patterns of these contacts tend to be highly heterogeneous. Traditional ''compartmental'' modeling in epidemiology, however, assumes that population groups are fully mixed, that is, every individual has an equal chance of spreading the disease to every other. Applications of compartmental models to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) resulted in estimates of the fundamental quantity called the basic reproductive number R 0 -the number of new cases of SARS resulting from a single initial case-above one, implying that, without public health intervention, most outbreaks should spark large-scale epidemics. Here we compare these predictions to the early epidemiology of SARS. We apply the methods of contact network epidemiology to illustrate that for a single value of R 0 ; any two outbreaks, even in the same setting, may have very different epidemiological outcomes. We offer quantitative insight into the heterogeneity of SARS outbreaks worldwide, and illustrate the utility of this approach for assessing public health strategies. r",

Yet, even during the three and a half months of SARS spread in China between its initial appearance and the broad implementation of public health measures, case counts were much less than expected from such values of R 0 (Xu et al., 2004) . By definition, the total number of expected cases of a disease goes up by a factor of R 0 for every generation of infection, a generation being the mean time between an individual becoming infected and their infecting others. Based on recorded dates of the first symptoms for 124 pairs of infections in Singapore and Toronto (Leo et al., 2003; Poutanen et al., 2003) , we estimate the average generation time (g) for SARS to be 9.770.3 days.

In fact only 782 cases were reported during the initial three months (World Health Organization, 2003) , which, using this simple calculation, suggests that R 0 should be much lower and closer to 1.6. A subsequent estimate based on data from the Hong Kong and Singapore outbreaks brings R 0 down to 1.2, which, by the above formula, predicts approximately 50 cases during the first 120 days of transmission (Chowell et al., 2003) . While this number agrees nicely with the case counts observed in Hong Kong and Singapore (Chowell et al., 2003a, b) it is an order of magnitude lower than that reported for China.",

            "text": "Why do epidemiologists derive such varied estimates of R 0 and why were the initial estimates so high in comparison to the observed epidemiology in China? The basic premise of fully mixed epidemiological modelsthat all individuals in a group are equally likely to become infected (or infect others)-often does not hold and therefore may lead to spurious estimates or estimates that cannot justifiably be extrapolated from the specific setting in which they were measured to the broader community context. Early SARS estimates were based largely on transmission data from closed settings like hospitals and crowded apartment buildings, where there are unusually high rates of contact between individuals (Lipsitch, 2003; Riley et al., 2003) . In fact, hospital transmission accounts for 50% of the value of R 0 described in Riley et al. (2003) . If the contact patterns in these settings were highly heterogeneous, then the estimates for R 0 may be inaccurate. Even if the estimates for R 0 were indeed appropriate for these specific settings, they probably should not be extrapolated to the population at large. Contact rates may be considerably lower outside hospitals and crowded apartment buildings and thus so may be the general value of R 0 for SARS (Yu et al., 2004) . Such disparity may account for the discrepancy between the estimates and the slower progress of the outbreak in China. In fact, further studies suggest that the unusually large cluster of infected cases in Amoy Gardens complex in Hong Kong was due to exposure to the virus-laden aerosol plume originating from one of the buildings in that area and not from direct person-to-person contact (Yu et al., 2004) . A recent analysis of the impact of SARS isolation interventions in Hong Kong, Singapore and Toronto emphasizes the importance of viewing R 0 as a distribution of possible values where the mean and median may vary depending on the setting in which the disease is spreading (Chowell et al., 2004) . SARS, like many other infectious diseases exhibits great heterogeneity in transmission efficiency with certain individuals appearing to be responsible for large proportion of transmission events (Booth et al., 2003; Donnelly et al., 2003; Leo et al., 2003) . These individuals may be ''superspreaders'' with unusually large numbers of contacts or ''supershedders'' who are unusually effective at excreting the virus into the environment they share with others. In contrast to the fully mixed assumption of standard compartmental models, the contact patterns in a community may be quite diverse. There is an enormous difference between a situation in which all individuals share typical contact patterns and one in which most infected individuals pass the disease on to only one or even zero others, but a small number pass it onto dozens or even hundreds-the mean value of R 0 can be the same in both cases, while the epidemiological outcomes are vastly different.",

For example, the strategies for international SARS control were founded upon the largely intuitive idea of early interruption of critical social contacts (World Health Organization, 2003) . There are several mathematical approaches that likewise consider sociological factors. To name a few, compartmental models that break populations into many demographic groups capture greater behavioral heterogeneity (Hethcote and Yorke, 1984) ; stochastic approaches including stochastic compartmental models (Bailey, 1975) , branching process models (Becker, 1977; Farrington et al., 2003) , dyad models (Keeling et al., 1997; Ferguson and Garnett, 2000) , and Reed-Frost chain-binomial models (Lefevre and Picard, 1989 ) allow more exact predictions of the size and probability of epidemics; and ''individual-based modeling'', a primarily computational approach based on following the contact and infection histories of simulated individuals, yields detailed statistical predictions about disease outcomes. Most individual-based models assume predefined simple contact patterns such as regular lattices (Durrett, 1999; Kleczkowski and Grenfell, 1999; Ritton and O'neill, 2002; Sander et al., 2002) , although there have been recent efforts to consider more realistic contact patterns (Van der Ploeg et al., 1998; Chowell et al., 2003a, b; Eubank et al., 2004) .",

The first step in contact network epidemiology is to construct networks based on information about real-life contacts between individuals. One can then analyse these networks to determine their crucial topological features and apply analytical methods to make epidemiological predictions and intervention recommendations. The two primary advantages of this approach are that (i) it makes no a priori assumptions about the global network structure and (ii) the mathematical analysis allows one to bypass extensive simulation.",

            "text": "In the studies described here, we start by generating a plausible contact network for an urban setting using computer simulations. The simulations are based on data for the city of Vancouver, British Columbia. We choose N=1000 households at random from the Vancouver household size distribution (Statistics Canada, 2001), which yields approximately 2600 people. Household members are given ages according to the measured Vancouver age distribution (BC Stats, 2003) , and, based on age, are then assigned to schools according to school and class size distributions ( Vancouver School Board, 2002) , to occupations according to (un)employment data (BC Stats, 2002) , to hospitals as patients and caregivers according to hospital employment and bed data (Centre for Health Services and Policy Research, 2002) , and to other public places. Within each location we create random connections between individuals with probabilities of 1 for households, 0.3 for hospitals and schools, 0.03 for workplaces, and 0.003 for other public places. Admittedly, these within-location parameters are largely based on intuition, and future versions of this model will include estimates based on data. We found that the structure of these simulated networks is robust to small changes in these values. Each school or hospital is sub-divided into classrooms or wards. Pairs of students or patients within these sub-units were connected with higher probability than pairs associated with different sub-units. Teachers are assigned to classrooms and connected stochastically to appropriate students. Caregivers are assigned wards and then connected to appropriate patients. There are also low probability neighborhood contacts between individuals from different households 3 . This network offers a high degree of realism but is quite complex. We therefore use two simpler networks to provide additional insight. One is a random network with a Poisson degree distribution in which individuals connect to others independently and uniformly at random (Fig. 1B) . Neither the simulated nor the Poisson network, however, contains a significant fraction of superspreaders. Therefore we also study a network with a (truncated) power-law degree distribution (Fig. 1C) , a form much discussed in recent work on network epidemiology (Barabasi and Albert, 1999; Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani, 2001) . This network has a ''heavy tail'' of superspreaders ( Fig. 2 ) and, as we will see, these individuals can have a profound effect on outbreak patterns despite being few in number. Network theorists often refer to such networks as scale-free because of the absence of a typical degree in the network.",

They will surpass the epidemic threshold when there is a nonnegligible probability that an outbreak will reach members of this minority. Because superspreaders are rare, however, any particular outbreak may fail to reach this minority and thus never generate an epidemic. In contrast, vertices in a Poisson network will be fairly homogeneous and any two small outbreaks will be essentially equivalent. Whereas a power law network reaches an epidemic threshold only when transmissibility is sufficiently high to reach superspreaders with reasonable frequency, a Poisson network reaches an epidemic threshold only when the 'typical' outbreak leads to an epidemic.

Simulation values are based on 2571 simulated epidemics, one for every unique patient zero in the network.

As an alternative to such direct estimates of T, if the underlying contact network is known, one can estimate T based on epidemiological case counts. We can predict the expected number of cases at each generation of transmission as a function T (not described here) and thus estimate T by curve fitting to the appropriate data (Meyers et al., 2003) . The sensitivity of our epidemiological predictions to the estimated value of T will vary by both contact network and disease . For example, for highly contagious diseases (T40.2), the probability of a large-scale epidemic is much more sensitive to minor variations in T in the power law network than in the Poisson and urban networks (Fig. 3) . The reverse is true for mildly contagious diseases just above the epidemic threshold.",

We offer a simple example to illustrate the benefits of measuring T. Suppose we measure R 0 \u00bc 2:7 in a hospital where the average individual comes in close contact with 100 other individuals. Then the probability that an individual will catch the disease from an infected contact is just 2.7% or, in network terms, T \u00bc 0:027: Now suppose the typical individual in the general population has 10 close contacts that could potentially lead to the spread of a disease. If we extrapolate R 0 \u00bc 2:7 to the general public, then we predict that, on average, 2.7 out of every 10 contacts or 27% of contacts become infected, whereas if we extrapolate T=0.027 to the general public we still have only 2.7% of contacts becoming infected, which gives us a much reduced expectation for the spread of the disease.",

To truly reap these benefits of the network epidemiology, we must have not only good estimates of T but also realistic models of contact networks. We have presented a first step towards a realistic community network and have shown that it departs significantly from the idealized networks previously used in network epidemiology, and yet still is sufficiently random for the application of epidemiological network analysis. The task of making even more realistic contact network models of small communities, hospitals, cities, even the global the population is enormous, but promises a step change in our ability to predict and effectively control the spread of infectious disease. As we incorporate better data at these various scales, network theory will allow us to generalize our predictions and make better suggestions for epidemiological control.",
