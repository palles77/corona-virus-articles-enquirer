Full academic-style programs should be developed at universities to comprehensively educate individuals in this applied science. Microbial forensics will necessarily cover a broad range of topics (microbiology, epidemiology, evolution, statistics, infectious diseases, etc.) and no one can be an expert in all aspects. However, all interested parties need to have some requisite knowledge in the various aspects of the discipline. A full academic program likely is not practical for working professionals; more abbreviated educational/training activities, similar to that of a continuing education course format, could be very effective at integrating professionals into the microbial forensics discipline. Shorter courses or symposia will be useful for expanding the knowledge base of trained professionals. Microbiologists, epidemiologists, public health, and law enforcement officials are highly trained in relevant aspects of microbial forensics, but may need additional training to integrate effectively their expertise with the demands of this new discipline.

            "text": "Microbial forensics is defined as a scientific discipline dedicated to analyzing evidence from a bioterrorism act, biocrime, or inadvertent release of a microorganism/toxin for attribution purposes (1) . It is the same as other forensic disciplines except for its focus on a particular type of crime (1, 2) . Based on past history and with current technology capabilities, the potential use of biological weapons is greater than at any other time in history. Only a few semiexpert individuals are needed with access to dual-use equipment (e.g., equipment used in the pharmaceutical or food industries) to produce bioweapons inexpensively. These bioweapons will contain signatures that might be exploited to help identify the perpetrators. One may consider attribution solely to be the \"DNA fingerprinting\" of a pathogenic agent, but unique genomic identification of a microorganism may not always be possible because of the clonal nature of many microorganisms and, on a case-by-case basis, lack of population and phylogenetic data. Microbial forensics employs the same general practices as other forensic disciplines. Recognizing a crime scene, preserving a crime scene, chain of custody practices, evidence collection and handling, evidence shipping, analysis of evidence, and interpretation of results are carried out in the same general manner as other forensic evidence. A common exception is that evidence will be handled as a biohazard (even more so than, for example, HIV-infected blood). It is anticipated that the majority of microbial forensic evidence will fall into a category with shared characteristics, with some data being very informative and some being less informative. An understanding of the field is essential to determining what type of evidence is collected, how it is analyzed, what the significance of a result is, and what is supportive in identifying a perpetrator and for prosecution.",

From a practical standpoint, many microbial forensic training programs will be based in other majors or minors in epidemiology, genetics, molecular biology, or microbiology. A major in epidemiology or microbiology could easily become a training platform for microbial forensics with the addition of select courses to include fundamentals in forensics. Alternatively, a forensics science program with additional training in basic sciences such as microbiology and epidemiology could serve to educate microbial forensic scientists. It will be important to emphasize integration of the material toward a specific microbial forensic profession.

The goal of epidemiology is to recognize infectious disease outbreaks and to attribute the outbreak to a source in order to prevent additional cases (see Chapter 15). In many aspects, microbial forensics employs the same tools as those used in epidemiology. A training program in microbial forensics will parallel many parts of current programs in epidemiology. Models can be obtained from epidemiology curricula and experience from natural outbreaks will help guide how microbial forensic scientists will perform investigations of biocrimes. Tracing the course of a disease will assist in identifying the index case, cause, and/or time of the outbreak. With many disease outbreaks as well as cases of unusual infections (e.g., monkey pox), the recurring question will be: Is this a natural event or an intentional attack? Epidemiological factors will help distinguish between natural or intentional events and enable more effective responses in either event. A biocrime may only be recognized through surveillance linking multiple unusual disease occurrences in contiguous or noncontiguous geographic areas. Often microbial forensic investigations will be based on initial public health findings and proceed further to address attribution as it applies to identify the perpetrator(s) of a biocrime or bioterrorist act.",

Molecular tools can be employed to characterize and potentially individualize samples and isolates to address forensically relevant questions. This subdivision of epidemiology has special importance in microbial forensics because it is desirable to determine the source of a particular microbe used in a crime. Highly discriminating assays can precisely identify strains and isolates, resulting in a more focused and effective investigation. These types of data could associate a sample with a single geographic area, even possibly a particular laboratory or flask, or with the specific conditions and nutrients used to culture the microorganism.

The need for proper documentation may seem obvious but it is a very important part of maintaining the integrity of the evidence. Crime scenes are chaotic and missteps can occur. To minimize missteps in handling documentation procedures should be established so the crime scene can be reconstructed at a later date for investigators or in a court of law. It is likely that biocrimes and acts of bioterrorism will add another dimension of complexity because (i) there is less experience in crime scene collection due to (fortunately) fewer cases, (ii) addressing the safety of victims will not be trivial, (iii) investigators will be wearing cumbersome but absolutely necessary protective gear, and (iv) the best approaches for collection and preservation of evidence may have to be determined at the scene given the limited extant information available.

Molecular epidemiology is increasingly applying the principles of evolutionary and population genetics to pathogens. It is important to understand what constitutes a sample population as opposed to a sample collection, the mode of inheritance related to a genetic marker, what significance or weight to apply to a genetic marker, what the mutation rate of a marker is, and how to combine the weight of multiple markers. Training of the student in this discipline will require basic genetics courses and more advanced courses in phylogenetic analyses. Such educational material will be found in population genetics and systematic and evolutionary biology programs. The population genetics of pathogens and its importance for microbial forensics are covered elsewhere in this book.",

These will range from microscopy to basic chemistry to analytical chemistry applications. The Amerithrax investigation demonstrated the importance of nonbiological measurements on samples of biological agents. A variety of mass spectral, spectroscopic, and other instrumental methods were used in an attempt to answer questions related to how, when, and what materials were used to produce the anthrax powders. Such information can be used to compare evidence directly to a reference sample or, indirectly, to infer something about the processes used to culture, stabilize, and/or disseminate the biothreat agent.",

            "text": "Forensic science is the application of science to answer questions of interest to a legal system as well as for military or state decisions (1, 6, 7) . While science may not offer definitive solutions to the problems of society, it does serve a special investigative role, particularly in the criminal justice system. The areas of science that have been traditionally exploited are diverse, but typically include the major disciplines of biology, chemistry, physics, and geology. Within each discipline are many scientific subcategories that may be used in a forensic science investigation. For example, within the discipline of biology are the subdisciplines of medicine, pathology, molecular biology, immunology, odontology, serology, psychology, and entomology. The specific discipline(s) applied depends on the circumstances of the crime. Mathematics, especially statistics, is used to place weight or significance on observations or data retrieved from crime scene evidence. The ultimate question addressed by forensic science is usually \"who committed the crime?\" (i.e., attribution), and crime scene evidence can play a role in answering that question. Evidence can be any material, physical or electronic, that can associate or exclude individuals, victim, and/or suspect with a crime. It typically comprises materials specific to the crime and to control samples for background information. Types of evidence may be fingerprints, blood, semen, saliva, hair, fibers, documents, photos, computer files, videos, firearms, glass, metals, plastics, paint, powders, explosives, tool marks, and soil. The student needs to be cognizant of the types of evidence, how these different forms of evidence interplay, and how they can be used to help reconstruct the crime and/or identify the perpetrator.",

Studies of case histories are instructive because they provide analysis of information in the relevant context, including real complexities. The study of each incident can be tailored to the particular group learning about them. The Amerithrax case is likely to be studied for years by many different groups ranging from scientists to law enforcement to lawyers. In addition to this case, many other cases are described in chapters of this book and the previous edition (6), as well as in specific publications (8) . Among these threats are food-borne illnesses from bacteria, such as Shigella and Salmonella, and toxins such as ricin. In addition, there have been events directed at agriculture, including foot-and-mouth outbreaks in the United Kingdom and mad cow disease in the United States in 2003. Environmental contamination is also an area of interest, such as water contamination by the poultry industry in Arkansas. Perhaps the most common area where issues of natural versus intentional events arise is related to emerging infections. This question has arisen with the outbreaks of influenza H1N1, severe acute respiratory syndrome, monkey pox, and specific cases of HIV infection.",

There will be times when the evidence will be used in a court of law to prosecute an individual who has been arrested for a biocrime. There are standards for admissibility of scientific evidence in a legal setting. The scientist may be asked to provide expert testimony. These need to be known and appreciated so that the burden of admissibility of evidence can be achieved. The government will use forensic scientists and their results, other experts, and the scientific literature to support its position. The defense will defend its client vigorously to attempt to achieve an acquittal. Because of the adversary system in the United States and other English-based law countries there will be challenges to the credibility of the science and the practitioners (7, 9) . Studying the science behind headlines can be a very instructive and creative way to interest students. A current controversy in forensics, which can be used instructively, involves the use of low copy number of DNA (10, 11) .

The primary goal is to intercede and thwart the attack before it can happen. Alternatively, if an attack has occurred, a head of state may require some evidence to determine whether to retaliate and to whom retaliation should be directed.
