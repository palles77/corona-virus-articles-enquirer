            "text": "A common cold is mainly induced by numerous viral infections (rhino virus, picorna virus, corona virus, influenza virus, and adenovirus) to the upper respiratory tract. 1 Although the common cold is not a seriously medical issue, it can lead to social inconvenience such as absence from work or school during infections. Adults who were healthy people are approximately 2 to 4 times a year on average, it takes a common cold. 2 The common cold symptoms are various, subjective, and self-limited, however it spontaneously recovers after several days of infection. Therefore, most of medical doctors don't serve medicines to patients for curing common cold. Nevertheless it has been come to critically social issues due to its relatively high medical costs. 2, 3 Previous study well documented that the medical costs for the common cold in the US are estimated approximately 40 billion dollars per year. 4 In spite of the above concerns, it can hardly treat this disease owing to diversities of cold virus infection as well as development of cold symptoms. Thus it is almost impossible to entirely treat to common cold and its symptoms. 5 On the other hand, the ways for treating common cold are mainly focused on alleviation of symptoms or preventing from secondary infections, however these ways are very limited and confined. 6 The typical treatments including antipyretic-analgesics, anti-virus drugs or anti-inflammatory drugs were partially used to treat cold symptoms; they are no conclusive ways for entire resolution of the common cold. [6] [7] [8] Due to deficiency of effective ways to treat common cold, many people access to the Traditional Chinese Medicine. As a one of most popular Traditional Chinese Medicine, the acupuncture has been clinically used to treat diverse types of diseases including for caring various types of cancer and its related adverse effects or pain during treatments, [9] [10] [11] skeletal muscle pain, 12 digestive tract disorder, 13 chronic fatigue, and depression or anxiety. 14 In the case of treating common cold, however it is still lack of evidences to prove its efficacies. In the present study, thus we aimed to investigate the beneficial effects of acupuncture alone treatment to the patients with common cold through case series study for reducing the illness duration, relieving symptoms, diminishing medical cost, and satisfying with the acupuncture treatment through the chart review.",

The previous studies showed that the validity of cold treatments would be required the shortening the duration of illness at least 26 h or more severity of cold symptoms will be reduced by average 25% to 57 %. 1, 21, 22 The cold period is commonly lasted for at least 7 days, but our result showed manual acupuncture treatment might be efficiently worked on the reducing the cold period. 8 At the point of view, especially onset time of common cold, the acupuncture treatment was more efficiently and significantly affected on the Group \u2160 as compared with Group \u2161. The results might be implied that manual acupuncture is more susceptibility on the early time of onset common cold. It is difficult to prove the beneficial effects of manual acupuncture treatment for relieving cold treatments periods. Furthermore, due to lack of the therapeutic treatments or agents for completed caring common cold, it is critical issue to reduce the subject symptoms of common cold which were depended on the patients. 8 Thus we investigated that the possibility of acupuncture improving cold related symptoms via questionnaire survey. In the current study, the cold related symptoms were drastically perished by manual acupuncture treatment in both Group \u2160 and Group \u2161 approximately 50% after initial acupuncture treatment (data not shown). Especially in the common cold therapies, the subjective satisfactions of each patient are most critical factor. 21, 22 Thus, we further assessed the satisfaction with acupuncture treatment. After completion of the manual acupuncture treatment, approximately 83% of subjects were responded satisfaction of manual acupuncture treatment. We gathered the chart data for 187 patients, however among them only 120 patients were completely finished. The reasons for the drop out were 'no reasons' or 'dissatisfaction with acupuncture' was mostly; however there were no subjects who suffered with the adverse effects or worsened cold symptoms caused acupuncture treatment. Some of previous studies already showed that the acupuncture treatment beneficially affected common cold and its symptoms. 23, 24 Those studies were taken a huge size of clinical trials and they collected the symptoms related reports via subjective opinions by participants, and estimated the treatment period for completed recover from the symptoms. As view of the reliving symptoms of common cold, the regression of period for the survival curves in Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (which meant less than score '1' of Jackson score) was taken for 2 weeks. The above studies well correspond and support the results of current study. In the present study was performed by chart review study with small size of subjects in South Korea, therefore it will be appeared methodological limitations as follows: (a) the results are out of place as for being generalized because the sample size is too small, and results might apply only to South Korea; (b) Notes: all of subjects were divided into two groups by durations of common cold. Group \u2160 is consisted of patients with common cold who visited within 36 h onset of common cold, and Group \u2161 is composed of patients who were over than on set of common cold over than 36 h. After complement of acupuncture therapy, all of the subjects answered the satisfaction of acupuncture treatment through questionnaire survey by subjective opinions. Notes: all of subjects were divided into two groups by durations of common cold. Group \u2160 is consisted of patients with common cold who visited within 36 h onset of common cold, and Group \u2161 is composed of patients who were over than on set of common cold over than 36 h. A total 67 of participants dropped out (Group \u2160 for 36 and Group \u2161 for 31) from the current study. Table 2 Reasons of dropped out from the present study (n) patients with cold in current study represent a heterogeneous group; (c) present study was performed with a small size of retrospective case series, thus making comparison with other studies will be remained difficult; (d) we didn't serve any of biological markers such as blood analysis data; (e) current study didn't explain the mechanisms of the acupuncture. Therefore, it will be need to consider those of limitations for next study. Despite to the lack of the above limitations, the values of the estimation for acupuncture as cold treatment cannot be discounted, since it has certain validity by itself. Taken together, therefore, our findings suggest that manual acupuncture treatments efficiently and beneficially worked on the patients with common cold.",
