            "text": "We have developed real-time PCR systems to quantitate feline cytokine gene expression. The method is based on the cleavage of fluorescent dye-labelled probes by the 5 H \u00b13 H exonuclease activity of the Taq DNA polymerase during PCR and measurement of fluorescence intensity by a Sequence Detection System. The feline-specific TaqMan probes were designed to encompass an intron, thus allowing differentiation of complementary DNA versus genomic DNA amplification products. Quantitative analysis of cytokine cDNA concentrations was performed in comparison to feline GAPDH. Messenger RNA (mRNA) from the universally expressed housekeeping gene GAPDH proved to be useful as an amplification control and allowed for correction of variations in the efficiencies of RNA extraction and reverse transcription. GAPDH mRNAs were readily detectable in cDNAs prepared from unstimulated feline peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and from frozen cell pellets, while cytokines (Interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, IL-12 p35, IL-12 p40, IFNg, IL-16) were expressed at variable amounts. IFNg transcription was found to be upregulated in stimulated PBMCs and feline cell lines. The synthesis of cDNA and the performance of the PCR in separate tubes proved to be of superior sensitivity compared to a single-tube based system. The assays described are highly reproducible, require no post-PCR manipulation of the amplicons and permit the analysis of several hundred PCR reactions per day. With this method it is possible to detect and quantify cytokine mRNA expression reliably in small amounts of cells even after storage of samples for at least 5 years. # (C.M.

            "text": "Cytokines play a central role in the regulation of cell differentiation, proliferation, and cell\u00b1cell communication (Balkwill and Burke, 1989) . In addition, some cytokines have important effector functions via activation of directly cytotoxic compounds (e.g. perforin, oxygen and nitric oxide radicals). Several studies indicate that variations in cytokine expression are associated with disease activity in immune-mediated or inflammatory disorders (Mosmann and Sad, 1996) . Low concentrations of circulating cytokines in blood or plasma make investigation of systemic cytokine patterns a difficult task. Therefore, sensitive detection systems are required to monitor their expression and secretion under various physiological conditions. Several methods exist that allow quantitation of cytokine expression at the protein level (ELISA, Elispot, biological assays, intracellular cytokine staining (Kabilan et al., 1990 )) and at the mRNA level (Northern blots, in situ hybridization, ribonuclease protection assay, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Dallman et al., 1991) ) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulations and in tissues. Northern blots and ribonuclease protection assays require large amounts of RNA that may constitute a limiting factor when small amounts of tissue samples or blood cell preparations are analyzed. PCR overcomes these limitations due to the exponential amplification of even minute amounts of starting material (Zimmermann and Mannhalter, 1996) and TaqMan procedures for human, bovine and mouse cytokines and chemokines have already been described (Wang et al., 1998; Collins et al., 1999; Fehniger et al., 1999) .",

The length of the PCR products (amplicon length, see Table 1 ) was held very short, between 76 and 113 basepairs (bp) (with one exception for IL16: 221 bp), so they are extended in a few seconds and do not require a separate extension step. Therefore, a timesaving two-temperature cycling was used.

Fluorescence intensity is directly related to the amount of input target DNA and can be detected with an automated fluorometer (ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System, PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA). As multiple cytokines from one cDNA sample were analyzed, GAPDH and the cytokines were all amplified in separate tubes due to an economical reason: multiplex PCR (detection of GAPDH and one cytokine in the same tube) would need more GAPDH reactions as when the analyzis of multiple cytokines were carried out in different tubes. The amplification conditions were the same for all cytokines assayed, and therefore, could be combined on the same 96-well plate: 2 min at 508C, 10 min at 958C, 40 cycles of 15 s at 958C and 60 s at 608C. Assay compositions were as follows: the 25 ml PCR mixtures contained a comercially available mastermix (TaqMan Universal PCR Mastermix, PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA) containing 10 mM Tris (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 2.5 mM deoxynucleotide triphosphates, 0.625 U of AmpliTaq Gold per reaction, 0.25 U AmpErase UNG per reaction, and 10 ml of the diluted cDNA sample. The primer and probe concentrations for all TaqMan systems were 400 nM and 80 nM, respectively. Final quantitation was done using the comparative C T method (see 2.7) and is reported as relative transcription or the n-fold differences relative to a calibrator cDNA (i.e. unstimulated PBMC sample).",

Among the two methods for quantitation of gene transcription (absolut quantitation by the standard curve method and relative quantitation by the comparative C T method), the latter was selected due to its ease and speed for setup and analysis. For relative quantitation by the comparative C T method, values are expressed relative to a reference sample, called the calibrator (unstimulated PBMC sample). First, the C T for the target amplicon and the C T for the internal control were determined for each sample. Differences in the C T for the target and the C T for the internal control, called \u00c1C T , were calculated to normalize for the differences in the amount of total nucleic acid added to each reaction and the efficiency of the RT step. The \u00c1C T for each experimental sample was subtracted from the \u00c1C T of the calibrator. This difference is called the \u00c1\u00c1C T value. Finally, the amount of target, normalized to an internal control and relative to the calibrator, was calculated by 2 \u00c0DDC T . Thus, all the experimental samples are expressed as an n-fold difference relative to the calibrator. \u00c1C T values can also be used to calculate an estimated copy number for every cytokine by using the GAPDH standard curve. 2 DC T would give a predicted copy number difference between GAPDH and a given cytokine mRNA. As the copy number of GAPDH mRNA is known from the standard curve a predicted copy number for the cytokine mRNA can be calculated.",

            "text": "In this report we describe the application of a novel assay for the quantitation of feline cytokine mRNA expression in fresh and stored PBMC. Several protocols using quantitative competitive RT-PCR (qc RT-PCR) for feline cytokines have been proposed (Dean et al., 1998; Rottman et al., 1995) . One of the most common concepts of qcPCR is the coamplification of two different templates of similar lengths and with the same primer recognition sequences in the same tube, thus ensuring optimised thermodynamics and amplification efficiencies for both template species (Menzo et al., 1992; Siebert and Larrick, 1992) . However, this PCR approach has several important drawbacks (Clementi et al., 1995) such as the need for parallel reactions for a single sample, postamplification steps reducing accuracy of the assay, and a narrowed linear range due to shared primer exhaustion (Sundfors and Collan, 1996) . The quantitative PCR technique used in this work has several advantages compared to classical quantitative PCR system. The use of fluorescent dye-labelled probes increases the sensitivity of the system, resulting in a linear relationship between copy number and C T values of at least seven orders of magnitude (Fig. 3) . In addition, the use of a third oligonucleotide in the form of the probe adds further specificity to the system comparable to hybridization techniques with blotted PCR products. The elimination of postamplification steps further increases reliability and reproducibility of the assay (Gut et al., 1999; Leutengger et al., 1999b) . A major factor Fig. 5 . Comparison of the two-tube TaqMan PCR with the one-tube RT-PCR. Standard deviations for all assays were between 0.08 and 2.3. Light grey bars: Two-tube system, cDNA produced with random hexadeoxyribonucleotide (pd(N) 6 ), white bars: one-tube RT TaqMan PCR, dark grey bars: one-tube RT TaqMan with random hexadeoxyribonucleotide (pd(N) 6 ) (rhex) added for reverse transcription. Relative expression for each cytokine is given as the difference of the C T values to 40 (total number of cycles). responsible for the accuracy of this method appears to be the determination of the C T value within the logarithmic phase of the amplification reaction rather than endpoint determination of conventional systems. The Sequence Detection System calculates the C T value at a time when amplification of PCR products is first detected, i.e., at the beginning of the exponential phase of amplification, when accumulation of inhibitory PCR products is unlikely to occur.",

Thus, this methodology offers a significant saving of time: pipetting, amplification and quantitation of 88 cDNA samples to be quantitated was achieved in less than 4 h with hands-on-time of around 60 min. The most pernicious problem facing the diagnostic application of PCR is production of false-positive results attributable to contaminating nucleic acids, particularly in the form of previously amplified material (carry-over). Any contaminant, even the most minute airborne remnant carried over from the previous PCR procedure or from a strongly positive sample (contamination) may be multiplied and can give falsepositive results. In the TaqMan system, the problem of carry-over is significantly reduced due to the real-time measuring principle which makes it unnecessary to open the tubes after amplification. In addition, the probability of contamination problems can be further decreased or even eliminated in TaqMan PCR by inclusion of the AmpErase 1 UNG system (Pang et al., 1992) .",
