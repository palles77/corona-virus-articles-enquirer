MDCK-33016PF cells are used in propagation of a cell-based seasonal influenza vaccine (Optaflu \u00d2 ); but, like most continuous cell lines, can grow in immunocompromised mice to produce tumors. It is, therefore, essential that no residual cells remain within the vaccine, that cell lysates or DNA are not oncogenic, and that the cell substrate does not contain oncogenic viruses or oncogenic DNA. Multiple, redundant processes ensure the safety of influenza vaccines produced in MDCK-33016PF cells. The probability of a residual cell being present in a dose of vaccine is approximately 1 in 10 34 . Residual MDCK-DNA is 10 ng per dose and the \u00df-propiolactone used to inactivate influenza virus results in reduction of detectable DNA to less than 200 base pairs (bp). Degenerate PCR and specific PCR confirm exclusion of oncogenic viruses. The manufacturing process has been validated for its capacity to remove and inactivate viruses. We conclude that the theoretical risks arising from manufacturing seasonal influenza vaccine using MDCK-33016PF cells are reduced to levels that are effectively zero by the multiple, orthogonal processes used during production.",

Vaccination remains the principal means of control for seasonal infections and is the core strategy in pandemic influenza virus preparedness. The vast majority of influenza vaccines are produced in embryonated hens' eggs, using decades-old technology, with one egg resulting in approximately one trivalent vaccine dose. While egg produced vaccines have a long history of safety there are issues of bioburden using this production system and a very small proportion of vaccines have an allergic reaction to egg protein [3, 4] . The logistics of egg production require a 6 month lead time before vaccine production can begin. This lengthy lead time results in a manufacturing inflexibility and can result in vaccine shortages as occurred in the 2004e05 influenza season.",

The public health requirement for hundreds of millions of doses of influenza vaccine is facilitated by the use of cells selected for suspension growth in large capacity fermentors [10] .

MDCK cells were derived in the late 1950s from the kidney of a normal Cocker Spaniel. Similar to many continuous cell lines, MDCK cells display a variable capacity to produce tumors when injected into immunocompromised animals [11e15] . Tumorigenicity is the ability of injected cells to produce tumors consisting of the same cell type in an immunocompromised animal. Oncogenicity is the ability of cellular elements to transform the cells of the injected animal into neoplastic cells that then grow into host animal-derived tumors [16] . The MDCK-33016PF cells used in the manufacture the Novartis cell-based seasonal influenza vaccine Optaflu \u00d2 are tumorigenic in immunocompromised (Nude) mice. It is, therefore, essential to ensure that no residual cells are present within a vaccine, that cell lysates or DNA are not oncogenic, and that procedures are in place to ensure that the cell substrate does not contain oncogenic viruses. Additional steps in the manufacturing process have been introduced to inactivate viruses and to remove or inactivate functional and potentially oncogenic DNA. We report here on the studies conducted and the multiple and redundant processes used to ensure the safety of an MDCK-33016PF cell-derived influenza vaccine with respect to issues of tumorigenicity and oncogenicity.",

The effects of BPL, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and polysorbate 80 (Tween 80) were studied to formally document the effects of each chemical on inactivation and depletion of cells. The results of these studies, which mimic the manufacturing process, indicate that in a worst-case challenge, BPL and polysorbate-80 are each capable of reducing the number of viable cells at least 10-fold. The cationic detergent, CTAB, had the strongest effect on cells with a complete destruction of cell cultures within 5 min. The extent of depletion of living cells by CTAB was shown to be !4 log 10 . However, the toxic effect of the reagents on cell viability during processing would likely be much higher than observed in the experimental approach, since the retention period of cells with each reagent would be much longer during the processing than in the experimental approach. Considered from this point of view the reduction capacity of the chemical moieties is unquestionably underestimated and a much higher depletion rate is anticipated. Taken together, the chemical solutions used for the processing of the vaccine have the capability to decrease the number of viable MDCK-33016PF cells by more than 6 log 10 . The chromatography steps used in the manufacture of the viral vaccine are also likely to be effective in cell removal. However, as with the ultracentrifugation step, the chromatographic steps have not been specifically validated for cell removal and were therefore not counted in the overall viral clearance factor. The cumulative cell removal potential of the manufacturing process e centrifugations, filtrations, and chemical treatments e when combined, can effect a greater than 41 log 10 reduction in cell number. Assuming that approximately 10 million cells are needed to produce each dose of vaccine, intact cells are removed by the manufacturing process to the point that there will be less than one cell in 10 34 doses of vaccine. For all practical purposes, the probability of an intact MDCK-33016PF cell being in the influenza vaccine is zero.",

BPL also reduces DNA size by inducing strand breaks and cross-links DNA with other DNA chains and with proteins. In addition to reducing the size of the DNA, BPL markedly reduces its ability to serve as a template for DNA polymerases [17e19]. It was noted by these later authors that, under specific conditions, BPL treatment abolishes all traces of DNA activity when evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).",

There is, undoubtedly, DNA greater than ca. 200 bps, but the amount is below the level of detection of the CGE method, and there may be some DNA approaching 1000 bps in length, which is sufficient to potentially encode for an oncogenic protein. Therefore, a mathematical (statistical) modeling approach was used to estimate the potential amount of long DNA sequences. Using this approach, the distribution of DNA lengths before BPL treatment was estimated, as was the relative number of breaks induced by the BPL treatment. The distribution of DNA lengths following BPL treatment was then evaluated by a mathematical model similar to that of Bose and Git [20] . The results of this evaluation provide an estimate of the relative amounts of DNA greater than a chosen length, e.g., 500 bps or 1000 bps, that were below the level of detection of the CGE methodology. The model indicated that, for each of the three production runs evaluated, >99.99% of the residual DNA is below 300 bps in length and that the amount of DNA >500 bps approaches zero.",

Reaction products from both the outer and semi-nested reactions were purified using QuickStep\u00d4 2 PCR purification kits (VH Bio Ltd, UK). Purified PCR products were subjected to capillary electrophoresis on an ABI PRISM \u00d2 31310 genetic Analyzer and evaluated using GeneScan software (Applied Biosystems). Three positive control samples, HCMV pol plasmid, HHV-6 pol plasmid and EBV positive Raji cell DNA were used at spike levels of 50 000, 5000 and 500 copies. A no template negative control consisting of water was included after every two samples and after the final sample. The MDCK e ATCC CCL-34 was used as a control for nonspecific amplification products. Degenerate PCR for polyomaviruses was conducted similarly using primers derived from sequences of the large T antigen as shown in Fig. 4 . Positive control plasmids containing T-antigen sequences of JCV and BPyV were used at 50 000 and 5000 copies. Negative controls were as described for the degenerate herpesvirus assay. Analysis of the induced BCLB-1 cells indicated a 44-fold increase in HHV-8 sequences in the induced cells compared to the uninduced cells after normalization for the amount of b-actin DNA in the samples. Examination of 200 cell profiles of duplicate treatments of uninduced and induced BCBL-1 cells indicated the presence of herpesvirus virions in 3% and 0.5% of the TPA plus sodium butyrate treated cells whereas, no virions were detected in the untreated BCBL-1 cells or in the duplicate samples of induced and uninduced MDCK-33016PF cells. For the PCR reactions all the controls met the appropriate validity criteria. The real time CCR for canine oral papillomavirus and canine papillomaviruses 1 and 2 were negative down to the limit of detection (LOD) of 10 2 copies per reaction, equivalent to 1 copy in 1 \u00c210 5 cells. Similarly the conventional PCR for adenoviruses was negative to the same LOD. In the degenerate PCR for herpesviruses all the positive controls were clearly positive in the semi-nested analysis at 500 copies per reaction. In addition EBV sequences were detectable with primer set 6 and HHV-6 sequences were detectable with primer set 5; emphasizing that some mismatches in the primer sequences are tolerated within these conserved regions of the viral genomes. The induced and uninduced test article MDCK-33016PF cells and the control MDCK cells did not give rise to amplified fragments in the expected size range of herpesvirus products. For the polyomavirus degenerate PCRs the positive controls had the expected specificities and all controls gave positive results at the 5000 copy level. No amplified products of the expected size for a polyomavirus were detected in the induced or uninduced test article cells or the control MDCK cells.",

If end titers were expected to be significantly below the detection limit of microtitrations ( 1.5 log 10 TCID50/mL), larger volumes (up to 10 mL undiluted sample) were inoculated in culture flasks to test for residual virus at lower detection limits. Starting and end titers were compared and used to calculate the log reduction for each virus.",

At this level a further contamination by aerosol or droplet infection from the human operator was assumed for all human viruses. The calculation was then continued through the entire manufacturing process, including fermentation, purification, and formulation of a final, trivalent vaccine.

The theoretical risk associated with tumorigenicity relates to the possibility of inoculation of a viable MDCK-33016PF cell into a recipient of the vaccine followed by the growth of that cell in the recipient. The risk of this occurrence is, for all practical purposes, zero. MDCK-33016PF cells are partly killed during the replication of influenza virus and multiple specific steps in the manufacturing process remove or inactivate remaining cells. These processes include centrifugation, filtration, chemical inactivation and membrane disruption (viral splitting). The filtration steps, BPL virus inactivating stages, and viral splitting activities have been specifically investigated to determine their ability to remove or inactivate cells and each operates through orthogonal mechanisms. Collectively, the evaluated steps have the capacity to reduce cellular concentration by !41 log 10 (validated data !35.6 log 10 ). Given that up to approximately 10 million cells are required to produce one dose of vaccine, the risk of an MDCK-33016PF cell being in one vial is less than w10 \u00c034 .",

Viruses from these families may also establish latent infections or, become integrated into chromosomal DNA following abortive replication. In addition, viruses might be introduced into the cells from the virus seed, through human contamination or via raw materials. These viral risks were countered by two independent approaches. First a rigorous analysis of the MDCK-33016PF cells was undertaken to exclude the presence of infectious oncogenic viruses or infectious oncogenic viral genomes; secondly the manufacturing process was shown to be capable of inactivating potential virus contaminants at very high levels.",

A more definitive analysis for the presence of oncogenic DNA viruses is provided by degenerate PCR capable of broad detection of herpesviruses and polyomaviruses. These methods have been shown to be capable of detecting new viruses [24] emphasizing their utility in this role. The possibility of detecting oncogenic herpesviruses is enhanced by induction procedures that can result in genome amplification and recrudescence from latency. None of the assays involving, degenerate PCRs for herpesviruses and polyomaviruses, broad PCR for adenoviruses and the specific PCRs for papillomaviruses, revealed the presence of oncogenic DNA virus sequences.",

Since these experiments were conducted, Khan and colleagues have formulated a specific algorithmic approach for the exclusion of retroviruses in vaccine cell substrates [30] ; the studies conducted here are in accord with that approach. The PERT assay for retroviruses is a highly sensitive method for the detection of this family of viruses and does not rely on specific genome information.

Compared to existing egg-derived vaccines, the MDCK cells used to produce vaccine virus from influenza virus strains isolated in eggs do not introduce new or higher virus-associated risk, as the host spectrum of MDCK cells is similar to that of embryonated eggs. Using a simple risk scoring algorithm to estimate and compare the risks of adventitious agents when different cell substrates are used for virus isolation and vaccine manufacturing, MDCK cells used to produce vaccines from egg-derived isolates gave either the same or lower risk scores than embryonated eggs used for isolation and production [31] .",

Burns reported in 1991 that DNA could be directly oncogenic in experiments using high levels of plasmid containing the activated HRAS gene [33] . More recently, scientists at the FDA have made important contributions by demonstrating the quantitative limits to direct DNA oncogenicity [34, 35] . In their initial studies, 12.5 mg of a plasmid capable of expressing both ras and myc were required to induce tumors in mice [35] . More recently, they have lowered this oncogenic level for a dual oncogene plasmid to 1 ng [36] . These recent data have reduced the safety margin estimate for 10 ng of high molecular weight DNA but methods to reduce the size or functional activity of DNA, like BPL treatment, can increase the safety factor (i.e. inverse of risk) by 10 7 [36] .",
