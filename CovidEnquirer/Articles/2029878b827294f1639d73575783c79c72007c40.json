The One Health (OH) approach to research ensures that human, animal, and environmental health questions are evaluated in an integrated and holistic manner to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the problem and potential solutions than would be possible with siloed approaches. However, the OH approach is complex, and there is limited guidance available for investigators regarding the practical design and implementation of OH research. In this paper we provide a framework to guide researchers through conceptualizing and planning an OH study. We discuss key steps in designing an OH study, including conceptualization of hypotheses and study aims, identification of collaborators for a multi-disciplinary research team, study design options, data sources and collection methods, and analytical methods. We illustrate these concepts through the presentation of a case study of health impacts associated with land application of biosolids. Finally, we discuss opportunities for applying an OH approach to identify solutions to current global health issues, and the need for cross-disciplinary funding sources to foster an OH approach to research.",

The One Health (OH) approach to research addresses questions at the intersections of human, animal, and environmental health by utilizing the expert knowledge of researchers, including public health practitioners and clinicians, from multiple disciplines and at local, national, and global levels. While the need for multidisciplinary research is not new, the concept of OH has gained momentum as researchers from human medicine, public health, veterinary medicine, urban planning, and environmental science increasingly focus on holistic, integrated approaches to complex questions that address human health in conjunction with animal and environmental health [1] .",

By looking at multiple dimensions of the problem through the lens of environmental, animal, and human health, researchers may discover influencing factors that they would not have otherwise seen, which can facilitate more informed intervention design. In 2015, the World Health Organization designated 11 diseases as high risk for severe outbreak, ten of which have a zoonotic reservoir or transmission vector [2] . An OH approach to studying these diseases may be able to provide more complete information about opportunities for outbreak prevention than a traditional one-dimensional approach. For example, a Lassa fever prevention intervention which targets the environmental (e.g. improved household sanitation) and animal (e.g. rodent removal) domains may show promise, but omission of the human domain (e.g. education of nurses on disposal of contaminated material in hospitals) may result in a missed opportunity to achieve optimum results. At worst, siloed approaches may lead to unforeseen detrimental effects. In the Lassa fever example, removal of rodent populations may result in increased malnutrition among humans if rodents were a significant direct or indirect (i.e. prey for larger food source animals) source of protein for families living in affected communities. The ultimate goal of OH research is to identify opportunities for health improvement and optimize risk mitigation simultaneously across all three domains [3] .",

In this phase, it may be helpful to draw upon the expertise of research collaborators and relevant literature to inform the development of a diagram or chart of these relationships. For example, a Directed Acyclic Graph could be used to visualize exposure-outcome pathways and identify important covariables and confounders [8] . Or, a logic model or similar multi-pathway visualization matrix may also be helpful for deciding where in the pathway to intervene and for brainstorming the potential impacts of the intervention on animal, human, and environmental health. For example, a graphing exercise may help the research team anticipate downstream factors of a vector control program that should be measured to both determine the program's effectiveness (e.g. reduced number of vector-borne illnesses) and to evaluate any adverse outcomes associated with the intervention (e.g. impact of mosquito fumigation on local flora and fauna or human respiratory illness associated with exposure to fumigation).

Researchers may look inside their own institutions or externally for relevant expertise. In the team-building phase, it is important to present the research question to a wide and varied audience to uncover perspectives far outside one's own field that may be unexpectedly relevant to the question at hand. Given the diversity of topics covered in the OH approach, study teams may benefit from involvement of, for example, epidemiologists, veterinarians, ecologists, urban planners, structural and environmental engineers, geologists, hydrologists, climatologists, geospatial scientists, botanists, parasitologists, and microbiologists, among others. Early involvement of specialists from each domain will encourage broader thinking in the planning process and will facilitate the aggregation of resources available in each domain, such as funding, staff, and data. Researchers may also consider involvement of community members who have on-the-ground experience with the issue in question, such as farmers, fisherman, park rangers, scuba divers, wildfire firefighters, plant workers, and community members who live near potential exposure sites. Involvement of community members is likely to enhance the research team's ability to collect new data and to understand the context of the data.",

The OH approach may draw from a range of study designs which are utilized in multiple disciplines, including, for example, prospective and retrospective cohort, case-control, genome-wide association, randomized control trial, case series, natural experiments, twin studies, risk assessment or risk analyses, experimental studies, and ecological studies. Due to the complexity of the OH research approach, the overall study design may be a combination of these. For example, a retrospective ecological evaluation of arboviral disease incidence in relation to deforestation patterns could be combined with a prospective natural experiment to assess changes in arboviral disease trends in reforested areas compared to those with continued deforestation. The integrated nature of the OH approach to research also lends itself to mixed data collection methodologies, including qualitative and quantitative human data, environmental samples, and animal behavior observational records. For example, a study of the impacts of groundwater contamination may combine serial readings from groundwater monitoring wells, geospatial modeling of contaminant plumes, evaluation of toxin concentration levels in fish, interviews with residents about perceived drinking water quality, aerial satellite imagery, and longitudinal surveys of residents or health registry data to evaluate health impacts associated with groundwater contamination.",

Power computation at an early phase may help avert decisions which would otherwise result in collection of insufficient data to adequately address the most important questions. Power may also be computed mid-study (interim power) to incorporate existing data and trends, and to ensure that the existing data collection plan is sufficient to address the OH questions in light of interim trends.",

Using these diagrams, the research team generated hypotheses about the possible contamination pathways and associations between biosolid use and human and environmental risk which were tested using simulation models, a methodology that transcends disciplines. In our example, model parameters were obtained from a variety of sources across all three domains of animal, human, and environmental health. Because the study evaluated human impact from exposure via contamination of environmental media, produce, and animal components, the research team was able to interpret results from multi-pathway models to assess total potential hazard to humans.
