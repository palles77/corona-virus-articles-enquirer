Microneutralization (MN) and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays are currently used to evaluate neutralizing antibody responses against human and avian influenza viruses, including H5N1. The MN assay is somewhat labor intensive, while HI is a surrogate for neutralization. Moreover, use of replication competent viruses in these assays requires biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) containment. Therefore, a neutralization assay that does not require BSL-3 facilities would be advantageous. Toward this goal, we generated a panel of pseudotypes expressing influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) and developed a pseudotype-based neutralization (PN) assay. Here we demonstrate that HA/NA pseudotypes mimic release and entry of influenza virus and that the PN assay exhibits good specificity and reveals quantitative difference in neutralizing antibody titers against different H5N1 clades and subclades. Using immune ferret sera, we demonstrated excellent correlation between the PN, MN, and HI assays. Thus, we conclude that the PN assay is a sensitive and quantifiable method to measure neutralizing antibodies against diverse clades and subclades of H5N1 influenza virus.",

As a result, an increasing number of avian to human transmissions have occurred which is often with high mortality [1, 2] . Presently, HPAI H5N1 transmissions have been limited to avian to human, however, continuous adaptation of the H5N1 virus or reassortment with seasonal human influenza A strains may result in new H5N1 strains capable of efficient human-to-human transmission. As a result, these strains could cause an influenza pandemic with significant levels of morbidity and mortality.",

Currently, the microneutralization (MN) and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays are used to estimate neutralizing antibody responses against HPAI H5N1 viruses. The microneutralization (MN) assay confirmed by western blot analysis is considered to be the gold standard for detecting anti-H5N1 specific neutralizing antibody response in humans [3] , however, the assay is somewhat labor-intensive and requires the use of various strains of replication competent H5N1 viruses under biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) containment, which limits the common use of these tests in many affected countries. Because it evaluates cytopathic effect (CPE) to reach an end-point titer, the MN assay, requires significant training to perform with consistent accuracy. The HI assay is based on the measurement of the ability of antibody to inhibit the hemmaglutination of erythocytes by influenza viruses, and serves as a surrogate of neutralization of influenza virus. Unfortunately, the conventional HI assay that uses chicken erythrocytes as the indicator cells used for seasonal influenza strains has been found to be poorly suited for use with avian H5N1 infection [4] . Therefore, a modified HI assay using horse erythrocytes has been developed [5] . In addition, the HI assay does not distinguish between infectious and non-infectious virus particles. Therefore, the development of a standardized, quantifiable assay to measure anti-H5N1 neutralizing antibody responses, which does not require BSL-3 containment is urgently needed for in serodiagnosis of human HPAI infections as well as for vaccine evaluation.",

These lentiviral pseudotypes have become useful tools in studies of viral entry and release, anti-viral drug screening, serodiagnosis, and for use in assessing the response to vaccines. Recently, the development of lentiviral pseudotypes expressing H5HA or H5HA and N1NA has been reported [14, 15] . These H5HA or H5HA and N1NA pseudotypes undergo a single-round of infection and cannot produce progeny viruses in the indicator cell lines. Thus, assays based on pseudotyped particles do not require BSL-3 facilities for production and testing. Pseudotype particles can also be engineered to contain reporter genes, such as green fluorescent proteins (GFP) and luciferase genes. Therefore, infectivity (transduction efficiency) of these pseudotypes can be readily assessed by measuring fluorescence that is indicative of the expression of the reporter gene.",

In addition, there is an excellent correlation in neutralization titers as measured by the PN and by the MN assays. Finally, we used sera from ferrets immunized with an H5N1 vaccine to demonstrate that the PN assay provides a sensitive and quantifiable method to measure neutralizing antibodies against diverse clades and subclades of H5N1 influenza virus.",

After transfection, culture supernatants containing H5HA and N1NA pseudotypes were harvested, concentrated, and then fractionated through a sucrose gradient. The H5HA, N1NA and HIV-1 gag proteins in each fraction were detected with specific antibodies. Fig. 1a shows that in all fractions except fraction with buoyant density at 1.06 H5HA and N1NA proteins were detected along with HIV-1 gag. The peak of H5HA, N1NA and HIV-1 gag were also detected in the same factions at buoyant density between 1.16 and 1.20. Thus, majority of H5HA and N1NA was co-migrated with HIV-1 gag protein in the sucrose gradient, indicating that both H5HA and N1NA were incorporated into the pseudotype particles. Fig. 1b is an electronmicrograph showing H5HA and N1NA pseudotypes being formed and released from the surface of the 293 T packaging cells. Fig. 1c shows the transduction efficiency measured by relative luciferase activity (RLA) in transduced MDCK target cells. As expected, the RLA in cells transduced with supernatants from cells transfected with pHR CMV-Luc and pCMVR 8.2 alone was similar to mock transduction.

After the bafilomycin A1 or NH 4 Cl pretreatment, cells were transduced with supernatants containing H5HA and N1NA pseudotypes or pseudotypes expressing CCR5-tropic HIV-1 envelope Ad8. The latter is known to enter the cell directly by passing through plasma membrane [24] . Fig. 1d and e shows RLA in cells with or without the pretreatment of NH 4 Cl and bafilomycin A1, respectively. Either pretreatment resulted in significant reduction in transduction efficiency of pseudotype particles expressing H5HA and N1NA but did not affect the transduction efficiency of pseudotypes expressing HIV-1 envelope.

Fig. 1f shows that treating 293 T cells with oseltamivir phosphate induced a marked dose-dependent decrease in the transduction efficiency of pseudotypes expressing H5HA and N1NA, but not pseudotypes expressing HIV-1 envelope or VSV-G. In contrast, treatment of Maji-CCR5 target cells with the same amount of oseltamivir phosphate did not reduce transduction efficiency of either the H5HA and N1NA pseudotypes or the HIV-1 envelope pseudotypes or VSV-G pseudotypes (Fig. 1g) . Thus, these results indicate that enzymetic activity of NA is required for pseudotype release, but not pseudotype entry. Likely, the enzymetic activity of NA removes the sialic/neuraminic receptor from the surface of packaging cells and from virus particles to help pseudotype release. Taken together the results of the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir study and the results of the bafilomycin A1 and NH 4 Cl studies strongly suggest that the mechanisms of cellular entry and release of pseudotypes expressing H5HA and N1NA are similar to those of wild type influenza A virus.",

In these studies we compared neutralization titers of sera from ferrets immunized with a monovalent split-virion inactivated H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1194/2004/NIBRG-14) clade 1 vaccine at a dose of 3.75 or 30 g HA with or without the adjuvant. Figure S3 for detailed information of scoring CPE. c % inhibition. Table 3 shows that neutralization titers measured by the PN, MN and HI assays appear to correlate very well. Moreover, the PN assay also appears to be more sensitive than the MN and HI assays for detecting neutralizing antibody responses against influenza viruses. For example, two of immune sera (#6283 and #6320) elicited with split-virion equivalent to 3.75 g HA alone and one of immune sera (#6278) elicited with split-virion equivalent to 30 g HA alone exhibited undetected neutralization titers when measured by both MN and HI assays. In contrast, when measured by PN assay low, but measurable, neutralization titers were detected. Thus, we conclude that overall there is a good correlation among neutralization titers measured by the HI, MN and PN assays. However, in immune sera with very low neutralization activity the PN assay exhibits greater sensitivity than the HI and MN assays.",

As described above, all of the H5HA and the H1HA pseudotypes also expressed a common N1 NA from the A/Thailand/1(KAN-1)/04 H5N1 strain. Table 4 shows that sera from clade 1 H5N1 vaccinated ferrets cross-neutralized at least one of the heterologous H5HA pseudotypes, but exhibited no neutralization activity against pseudotypes expressing H1HA and the A/Thailand/1(KAN-1)/04 NA. Moreover, serum samples from ferrets immunized with the low dose vaccine (3.75 g HA) showed low to undetectable neutralization titers against homologous H5 HA/NA pseudotypes (Table 3) . Sera from these animals also had low or undetectable neutralization titers against heterologous pseudotypes expressing H5HA from H5N1 clades 0, 1 or 2.3. Higher neutralization titers were seen against clades 0 and 1 than against subclade 2.3. In contrast, immune sera elicited with split-virion vaccine at a dose of 3.75 g HA with AF03 adjuvant exhibited much higher neutralization titers against homologous H5HA and N1NA pseudotypes (Table 3) . These sera also showed higher neutralization titers against heterologous pseudotypes expressing H5HA from H5N1 clades 0, 1, 2.1 and 2.3. The highest neutralization titers were against pseudotypes expressing H5N1 clade 1 HA with lower titers observed against pseudotypes expressing HA from H5N1 clades 2.1 and 2.3 and with the lowest neutralizing activity seen against pseudotypes expressing H5 HA from clade 0. Similarly, Table 3 shows that sera from ferrets immunized with AlOOH-adjuvanted split-virion vaccine at a dose of 30 g HA exhibited the highest neutralization titers against homologous H5HA and N1NA pseudotypes. These sera also exhibited the highest neutralization titers against heterologous pseudotypes expressing different clades and subclades of H5HA. Neutralization titers were higher against clade 1 than against clades 0, 2.1 and 2.3. After the challenge, not only did all sera from vaccinated ferrets exhibit much higher neutralization titers against all H5HA and N1NA pseudotypes, but also showed detectable neutralization activity against pseudotypes expressing H1HA and N1NA. From the results of these studies, we conclude that ferrets immunized with split-virion vaccines prepared from H5N1 clade 1 H5HA developed neutralizing antibody responses that strongly cross-reacted against HA/NA pseudotypes expressing HA from different sublineages of H5N1 clade 1. Sera from immunized ferrets also showed moderate cross-neutralization against H5 HA/N1 pseudotypes expressing HA from clades 0, 2.1 and 2.3. However, these sera did not cross-neutralize pseudotypes expressing H1HA and the N1NA from A/Thailand/1(KAN-1)/04 (H5N1).",

Using this pseudotype, these investigators tested the neutralization activity of sera from infected animals and humans and demonstrated positive correlation between pseudotype-based neutralization assay and a MN assay. Yang et al. [15] generated lentiviral pseudotypes coexpressing a clade 1 H5HA or a mutant form, as well as NA from H5N1 strains (A/Thailand/1(KAN-1)/04 and A/Vietnam/1203/04). They then used the HA/NA pseudotypes to measure amino acid residual specificity of H5HA recognized by monoclonal antibodies generated from mice vaccinated with wild type or triple-mutant HA. However, the H5N1 influenza virus has evolved into 10 different genetic clades. Among these, clade 2 has been shown to be the most diverse and has been subdivided into five subclades. Presently, the circulating HPAI H5N1 viruses isolated from humans fall into subclades 0, 1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 7 [27] . The HA of H5N1 clades 1 and 2 are distinguishable antigenically [28] . Thus, pseudotypes expressing H5HA from a single clade may fail to detect neutralization activity in sera infected with H5N1 viruses from other clades or subclades. Pseudotypes expressing H5HA alone treated with exogenous HA [14] demonstrate suboptimal transduction efficiency, which limits the comparison of antibody titers measured by PN assay versus those measured by conventional MN and HI assays.",

We also demonstrated that HA and NA pseudotypes mimic wild type of influenza virus in their mechanisms of cellular entry and release. Using immune mouse and ferret sera we developed a pseudotype-based neutralization (PN) assay and showed that this assay exhibited good specificity and that it can be used to measure quantitative differences in neutralization activity against different clades and subclades of H5N1 influenza viruses. We also demonstrated excellent correlation between neutralization titers measured by the MN and PN assays. Moreover, the PN assay was found to be somewhat more sensitive than the MN or HI assays, since it was able to detect low level specific antibody responses that were below the level of detection of the other assays. Finally, we used sera from ferrets immunized with adjuvanted and unadjuvanted split virion H5N1 vaccines to show the utility of the PN assay as a sensitive and quantifiable assay for measuring neutralizing antibody responses against diverse H5N1 clades and subclades.

Therefore, the PN assay does not require BSL-3 containment facilities. Secondly, unlike the HI assay the PN assay directly measures the effect of neutralizing antibody on blocking virus entry into the cell.
