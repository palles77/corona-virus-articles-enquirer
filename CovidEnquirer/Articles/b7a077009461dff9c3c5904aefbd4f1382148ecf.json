All children aged 7 years or younger, who presented to the ED during an 11-year period between January 1, 1993, and July 9, 2004, and who had a presenting complaint related to a respiratory illness or who had viral testing performed as part of their routine clinical care were included in this analysis. In the second part, a prospective validation study was performed to validate the use of the clinically collected viral cultures in the retrospective analysis. We chose to perform this validation because the viral tests collected during routine care were not from a systematically selected population known to have an infectious respiratory illness. Subjects in the prospective study consisted of patients presenting to the ED with a respiratory illness between December 7, 2003, and June 19, 2004 , who met a specific definition for an infectious respiratory illness. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from these patients and tested for respiratory viruses. By comparing the results of these tests to the historical time series, we were able to measure whether the historical time series was a representative sample of the viral distribution among children with infectious respiratory illnesses.",

Patients were recruited during a 6-month period from December 7, 2003, through June 19, 2004, for comparison with the patients who had routinely collected specimens during this time. Because of the large number of ED patients treated for respiratory illnesses during the winter, there was only a small overlap between the patients composing the validation group and those who were tested as part of their routine clinical care. The analysis was performed with these patients included and excluded from the study populations. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained from all patients in the validation group and tested for RSV, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, and adenovirus. A small number of specimens were not tested for all of the study viruses, because of insufficient volume and a brief shortage of cells for viral cultures in December. Rarely, an RSV test was read as indeterminate and was considered a negative test result in the analysis. 14 Routine clinical testing on patients included direct immunofluorescent antibody stains and viral culture. Direct immunofluorescent antibody assays used pooled antibodies for influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, RSV, and adenovirus (SimulFluor Respiratory Screen, Light Diagnostics, Chemicon International, Temecula, CA), or single virus-specific antibodies (Imagen Influenza Virus A and B, DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA; Bartels RSV DFA Kit, Trinity Biotech, Carlsbad, CA; ViraStat Parainfluenza Test, ZymeTx, Inc., Oklahoma City, OK; Adenovirus Antibody FITC Reagent, Light Diagnostics, Chemicon International).

Stepwise removal of the variables revealed that the effect of influenza virus depended on inclusion of RSV in the model. Thus, the effect of influenza is dominated by RSV and can only be uncovered when accounting for the variability of RSV in the model. The model with all covariates explains 81.6% of the deviance in the frequency of presentations for respiratory syndromes. We also examined different combinations of viral tests into a single predictor. Combining test results for RSV and influenza produced the best-fitting effect (adjusted RR 1.51; 95% CI 1.10 to 2.07).

The first is that tests were not performed to identify several respiratory viruses that may have contributed to the observed burden of respiratory illness, including rhinovirus, coronavirus, and human metapneumovirus. 19, 20 Although adding 1 or more of these viruses to our study might have changed the attributed variability, our findings of the influence of RSV and influenza virus are quite robust, and it is unlikely that their effect would be negated by the inclusion of the additional viruses in the model. Another potential concern is that biases in test ordering might make the routine viral test results unrepresentative of the patients who presented to the ED with respiratory syndromes. However, the results of prospective testing among ED patients with respiratory problems are closely correlated with the results obtained among the study population, strongly suggesting that the patients tested are in fact representative of the patients presenting with respiratory syndromes. Finally, our analytic methods may be limited by the presence of yearly seasonality in overall respiratory illness and viral prevalence. Although we have attempted to control for seasonal trends by including month as a categorical variable, it is difficult to know whether the correct adjustments were made for this effect.",

This is best demonstrated during the most recent respiratory virus season of 2003 to 2004, during which influenza activity began unusually early in October, peaked in late November to December, and then rapidly declined in January and February. 21 RSV followed a typical course with an increase in disease activity beginning in October and peaking in February before gradually declining. 22 Laboratory tests at our institution showed peak influenza and RSV activity in December and February, respectively, and presenting complaint-based respiratory syndrome surveillance demonstrated a bifid peak corresponding to this viral activity.",

Thus, to assess the predictive ability of these patterns of viral illness, we fit generalized linear models to the respiratory presenting complaints. 16 Because of frequent skewing in count data, a Poisson distribution was assumed instead of normality for modeling the respiratory count data. Overdispersion in the count data (extra variability not accounted for by Poisson regression) was also accounted for. 17 Because of the relatively low counts in positive viral tests, aggregation of data to 2-week intervals was used to reduce random noise in the response variable while maintaining a reasonable sample size for time-series analysis. The aggregated data were fit against the proportion of positive viral samples. The proportions for each virus were included in the Poisson models as covariates separately and in aggregate. Confounding by seasonal trends in respiratory illness was considered by including months as indicator variables. Positive serial correlation in time-series data (lack of independence between observations over time) may result in underestimation of the standard errors of regression coefficients. Thus, to control for the effect of time, we also included the counts from the previous time point as a predictor in the model. The model framework is as follows:where R i is the respiratory illness count for a 2-week time point i, V i is the proportion of positive samples for a given virus, M i are the dummy variables for month of year, and R i-1 is the respiratory illness count from the previous 2 weeks.Overall model fit for each of the Poisson regression models was calculated using an alternative R 2 calculation because traditional linear regression statistics are inappropriate for Poisson regression models. This method calculates the proportion of the deviance explained by the model. 18 Parameter estimates were transformed to rate ratios. A significant contribution of each effect to model fit was assessed by using 2-tailed 2 tests and \u2423\u03fd0.05 for rejecting the null hypothesis of no effect. All analyses were carried out using SAS statistical software (version 9.0, SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).Six months of viral test data from routinely collected specimens were validated against the prospectively collected data. Correlation was measured using the Pearson correlation coefficient on a pairwise comparison of percent viral test positivity over 2-week periods between the two datasets. To account for temporal autocorrelation, linear models were used to quantify the relationship between the 2 datasets where the historical time series was treated as the response variable. Seasonality was modeled through the inclusion of indicator variables for season. A normal distribution was assumed for the response variable after arcsine transformation of the proportional data to normality.",
