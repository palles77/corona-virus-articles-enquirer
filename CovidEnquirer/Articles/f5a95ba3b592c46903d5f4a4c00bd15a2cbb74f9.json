            "text": "Influenza causes seasonal infections worldwide that can lead to complications and deaths in every age group [1] . According to information from the WHO, between 330 million and 1.575 billion individuals suffer from influenza and influenza-like virus every year throughout the world, with deaths of between 0.5 and 1 million individuals [2] . In many countries, including Poland, for each age group, the rate of vaccination against influenza is still at a very low level, which generates high social costs, not infrequently family tragedies in the case of irreversible complications of influenza, or death of a loved one. The most effective and cheapest way to combat influenza is through vaccination [1] [2] [3] . Three pandemics caused by 3 different subtypes of the influenza virus occurred in the twentieth century [1] . The pandemic of 1918-1919, referred to as the Spanish flu, was caused by the A/H1N1/ virus; the pandemic 1957-1958, known as Asian flu, was caused by the A/H2N2/ (1-4 million of deaths); and the pandemic known as Hong Kong flu was caused by the A/H3N2/ (1-4 million of deaths) [2] . According to the present data, the 1918-1919 pandemic resulted in 50-100 million deaths [1] . People who had lived during the pandemic and who had survived, and remembered the spectre of death caused by influenza, did not challenge the validity of vaccination when the 1957-1958 Asian flu pandemic occurred and were eager to undergo vaccination, notwithstanding the lesser quality of vaccines at that time compared with the present [1, 4] . During the Spanish pandemic, the highest incidence was recorded in individuals aged 5-14 years, while the highest mortality rate was recorded in the population aged from 24-40 years [4] . Therefore, in order to avoid complications from influenza, and to ensure the appropriate development of children and young people, preventive measures, including regular vaccination against influenza, should be in place [5] . This does not mean that other age groups should be omitted from vaccination. The high variability of the influenza virus is a characteristic feature that has been known for many years [6] . In each successive seasonal epidemic, the circulation of influenza virus strains can be expected within a population. These strains are genetically and antigenically different from those which caused illness in the past or even in a number of recent epidemics, not only because of mutations, but also due to changes of reassortment resulting from the segmented genome [7] . This may in turn, have health and economic impacts associated with the occurrence of epidemic and pandemic influenza. Therefore, regular vaccination is one of the few steps that may be taken to protect people, especially in high-risk groups, from the potential, serious complications of influenza [1] .",

The reassortment of the 2 strains of viruses -A/H5N1/ (HPAI), which is very infectious, but does not have the ability of human to human transmission; and A(H1N1)pdm09, a pandemic virus which does have this ability -must be feared.

We must not forget that 1 million people throughout the world die from seasonal influenza and influenza-like viruses [2] . The global hysteria unleashed because of the purchase of pandemic flu vaccine did not fail to affect Poland. Statements were also made by individuals who had no substantive grounds for doing so. With regard to the issue of vaccination against the pandemic influenza virus A(H1N1)pdm09, the decision taken in Poland should be considered as appropriate when taking into account the type of restrictions imposed on Poland by pandemic vaccine manufacturers, who placed the entire burden of responsibility for vaccine safety onto the state, which is not the practice for seasonal vaccines. Furthermore, in accordance with manufacturers' requirements, the vaccine could not be made available in pharmacies.",

In effect, throughout the world many millions of doses of unused vaccine against pandemic influenza are wasted, representing many millions of Euros. Moreover, additional costs arise from the disposal of the vaccine purchased surplus to need, and it was a shame that these sizeable funds could not be devoted to other public health purposes instead. As we have stated and written many times, and what both then and now continues to give us cause for real concern, is the fact that confidence in the WHO has been undermined, the take-up of all vaccines has decreased, and that there will be a further reduction in the already low take-up of the influenza vaccine, particularly in Poland. Therefore, we deplore the fact that all those individuals who expressed themselves so actively in the press, radio and TV did not take action to increase the rate of vaccination against influenza, particularly since the ternary composition of the vaccine for the 2010/2011 season included the A/H1N1/pdm09 pandemic strain.",

The effectiveness of these drugs is dependent on several factors. In the case of seasonal influenza infection, the medication should be given after laboratory confirmation, preferably up to 36 hours from the onset of symptoms [1, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . However, in the event of pandemic influenza, it should be administered on the basis of clinical symptoms, without waiting for the laboratory confirmation of infection. The use of these medicines is indicated not solely for treatment of established infection, but also in prevention, including for post-exposure prophylaxis [1, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] .",
