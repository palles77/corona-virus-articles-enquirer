Of these phlorotannins (1-9), two eckol groups with a diphenyl ether linked dieckol (8) showed the most potent SARS-CoV 3CL pro trans/cis-cleavage inhibitory effects (IC 50 s = 2.7 and 68.1 lM, respectively). This is the first report of a (8) phlorotannin chemotype significantly blocking the cleavage of SARS-CoV 3CL pro in a cell-based assay with no toxicity. Furthermore, dieckol (8) exhibited a high association rate in the SPR sensorgram and formed extremely strong hydrogen bonds to the catalytic dyad (Cys145 and His41) of the SARS-CoV 3CL pro .",

            "text": "Brown algae have long been used traditionally as foodstuffs and folk medicines in Asian countries. Recently, a commercially available Ecklonia cava extract was approved as a new dietary ingredient (NDI) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2008 (FDA-1995-S-0039-0176). Marine algae have been identified as rich sources of structurally diverse bioactive compounds with great pharmaceutical and biomedical potential. Eckolina cava (Laminariaceae) is an edible brown alga that grows abundantly in the subtidal regions of Jeju Island, Korea. E. cava is used to produce food ingredients, animal feed, fertilizers, and folk gynecopathic medicines. 1 E. cava contains a variety of compounds, including carotenoids, fucoidan, and phlorotannins, that show different biological activities. 2, 3 The phlorotannin components, which are oligomeric polyphenols with phloroglucinol units, are responsible for the pharmacological activities of E. cava. 4 Ecklonia species have been used extensively as traditional medicines for the treatment of goiter, scrofula, urinary diseases, stomach ailments, hemorrhoids, boils, constipation, and postpartum women. 5 Previous studies have presented a wealth of evidence showing that E. cava exhibits antioxidant, 6 anticancer, 7 immunomodulatory, 8, 9 and tyrosinase inhibitory activity. 10 E. cava also exhibits anti-virus activities against HIV-1 reverse transcriptase 11 and influenza virus neuraminidase. 12 However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports of the phlorotannins from E. cava eliciting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 3C-like proteinase (3CL pro ) inhibitory activity.",

[13] [14] [15] Its 3CL pro , a chymotrypsin-like cysteine proteinase essential for viral replication, has been recognized as a key target for anti-SARS drug design. The active site of SARS-CoV 3CL pro contains a catalytic dyad composed of Cys145 and His41, where the cysteine residue (Cys145) acts as a nucleophile and the histidine residue (His41) acts as the general acid-base in the proteolytic process. 16 Until now, SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitors have been reported from both synthetic peptidyl compound libraries and natural product-derived libraries. 17 The synthetic inhibitory compounds include C 2 -symmetric diols, 18 quinolinecarboxylic acids, 19 and anilides. 20 The natural-derived inhibitors include betulinic acid, 21 indigo, 22 aloeemodin, 22 quinone-methide triterpenoids 23 and biflavonoids amentoflavones. 24 The aim of this present study was to investigate a SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitor isolated from E. cava. We characterized the anti-SARS-CoV 3CL pro effect of isolated phlorotannins from E. cava using cell-free cleavage and cell-based cleavage assays. To examine the trans-cleavage of SARS-CoV 3CL pro in the cell-free assay, the proteolytic activity of 3CL pro was tested against a fluorogenic substrate (Dabcyl-KTSAVLQSGFRKME-Edans) and analyzed with a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. The cis-cleavage of SARS-CoV 3CL pro was determined with a cell-based assay; the inframe construction of 3CL pro , the substrate (SAVLQSGFRK), and luciferase (Luc) was transfected into the Vero cells, and the ciscleavage activities of SARS-CoV 3CL pro were determined using a luciferase assay. We also assessed the effect of the inhibitor on the SARS-CoV 3CL pro interaction using a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis and a binding model.",

Preparation of SARS-CoV 3CL pro and effect of isolated phlorotannins on SARS-CoV 3CL pro trans-cleavage assay Because of the numerous functions and requisite roles of cysteine proteases in viral replication and pathogenesis, they may serve as attractive targets for antiviral drugs. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) depends on a chymotrpsin-like cysteine protease (3CL pro ) to process the translated polyproteins into functional viral proteins. This enzyme is a target for potential anti-SARS drugs. Ultimately, our goal is to develop a naturally derived SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitor for use as anti-SARS drug. Our first step toward this goal was to expressed and purified SARS-CoV 3CL pro from E. coli BL21 (DE3) CodonPlus-RIL cells as described in Section 2. The purified protease ran at approximately 33 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulface-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) with greater than 90% purity. The purified 3CL pro from Escherichia coli cells had a specific activity of 32.0 \u00b1 5.2 lM towards the Dabcyl-KTSAVLQSGFRKME-Edans substrate.",

First, we examined the effect of nine phlorotannins 1-9 on the cell-free SARS-CoV 3CL pro trans-cleavage assay. The percent inhibition at 200 lM concentrations of compounds 1-9 was initially determined, and the results are reported in Table 1 . As shown in Table 1 and Figure  2A , all of the phlorotannins investigated, except phloroglucinol (1), exhibited a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on 3CL pro hydrolysis with IC 50 values ranging from 2.7 to 164.7 lM against cell-free 3CL pro trans-cleavage. As the concentrations of the inhibitors were increased, the residual SARS-CoV 3CL pro activity decreased dramatically. All inhibitors exhibited a similar relationship between enzyme activity and enzyme concentration. As an example, the relevant data for dieckol (8) is illustrated in Figure 2B The inhibition activity was slightly affected by subtle changes in structure. Initially, we compared a closed-chain trimer of phloroglucinol (3, eckol) with an opened-chain trimer of phloroglucinol (2, triphloretol A), and we found that the activity of eckol (IC 50 = 8.8 lM) was 20-fold higher than that of the trimer itself (IC 50 = 164.7 lM). Replacement of the 3,5-dihydrophenoxy group by a dioxinodehydro group (4, IC 50 = 158.3 lM) led to weaker inhibition compared to 3; however it was still more active than 2. Similar to this relationship, substitution of the 3,5-dihydrophenyl group on the opened-chain trimer that formed a biaryl linkage tended to increase the activity (7, IC 50 = 22.5 lM vs 2, IC 50 = 164.7 lM). However, substitution of the 3,5-dihydrophenoxy group of eckol yielded the tetremeric phlorotannins 4-6 with reduced activities. When we compared a series of phloroeckols (5 and 6), we found that introduction a 3,5-dihydrophenoxy substituent at the 2C-position of the 3,5-dihydrophenoxy group (phloro-) increased the inhibitory activity $3-fold; 2-phloroeckol (5) had an IC 50 = 13.3 lM and 7-phloroeckol (6) had an IC 50 = 42.1 lM.",

The enzymatic activity was measured with a series of substrate concentrations and various inhibitor concentrations. The inhibition data were globally fit to all of the possible kinetic models. As shown in Figure 2C , the kinetic plots show that dieckol (8) has competitive inhibition profiles because the Lineweaver-Burk plot (1/V vs 1/[S]) is a series of straight lines with the same y-axis intercept for the SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitors. All of the isolated inhibitors exhibited the same mode of action for inhibition. The K i values in Table 1 were calculated from the Dixon plots, which are useful for determining the K i value of the inhibitor (see Supplementary data Fig. 4S ). The predominant inhibition mode shown by the naturally occurring viral enzyme inhibitors was noncompetitive. Interestingly, the inhibition of SARS-CoV 3CL pro by the phlorotannins isolated from E. cava was rarely competitive, encouraged us to further investigate this phenomenon with a more detailed biological study.

All of the tested phlorotannins, except 1-3, exhibited dose-dependent cell-based SARS-CoV 3CL pro ciscleavage inhibitory activities. In the cell-based cleavage assay, the isolated phlorotannins 4-9 inhibited the cis-cleavage activity of the SARS-CoV 3CL pro with IC 50 values ranging from 68 to 177 lM ( Fig. 3 and Table 2 ) in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, all of the phlorotannins were non-toxic to Vero cells with CC 50 values greater than 200 lM. Active phlorotannins were less effective when evaluated with the SARS-CoV 3CL pro cis-cleavage assay than when evaluated by the cell-free trans-cleavage assay. The explanation for this result may be that several of the compounds cannot permeate the cellular membranes to reach the intracellular SARS-CoV 3CL pro . The cell-based assay indicated that dieckol (8, IC 50 = 68.1 lM) is the most efficient at blocking the cleavage processing of the 3CL pro , which agreed with the cell-free cleavage FRET assay data. Dieckol (8) showed a strong correlation between the effects on the cell-free and cell-based cleavage of the SARS-CoV 3CL pro . In particular, dieckol (8) was more efficient at blocking the cleavage of 3CL pro than indigo, sinigrin, beta-sitosterol, and aloeemodin, which were previously reported plant-derived phenolic compounds. 22 Although diekcol (8) is considerably less effective than hesperetin (IC 50 = 8.3 lM), 22 it is the first report of a phlorotannin chemotype dieckol (8) that significantly blocks the cleavage of a SARS-CoV 3CL pro .",

SARS-CoV 3CL pro trans-cleavage assay As described, the inhibitory effect of each compound on SARS-CoV 3CL pro was measured using a FRET method. 26, 27 In this assay, the 14-mer fluorogenic peptide Dabcyl-KTSAVLQSGFRKME-Edans (Anygen Co., Republic of Korea) was used as a substrate, and the enzyme activity was determined by measuring the increase in fluorescence by continuously monitoring the reactions at 590/40 nm with excitation at 360 nm using a fluorescence plate reader (Flx800, BioTeck Instrument Inc., USA). The IC 50 values of the isolated compounds were measured in a reaction mixture containing 10 lg/ml of the 3CL pro (final concentration, 2.5 lg), the test compounds (from 0 to 200 lM), and 10 lM of the fluorogenic 14-mer peptide substrate in 20 mM Bis-Tris buffer (pH 7.5). To determine the enzyme activity, the experimental data was fit to a logistic curve with Eq. 1, a time-drive protocol was used and the initial velocity was recorded over a range of concentrations, and the data were analyzed using a nonlinear regression program [Sigma Plot (SPCC Inc., Chicago, IL)]:",

To study the kinetics of SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibition by isolated compounds 1-9, various concentrations of compounds 1-9 were added to 3CL pro in assay buffer containing the predetermined substrate. The K i values were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis by fitting different models of enzyme inhibition to the kinetic data using SigmaPlot Enzyme Kinetics Module 1.3 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The inhibition mechanism of the compounds was determined by comparing the statistical results, including the Akaike's information criterion values, of different inhibition models and selecting the one with the best fit. 28 ",

The transfected cells were incubated in Dulbeccos modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% bovine serum (FBS) for 4 h at 37\u00b0C under a 5% CO 2 atmosphere. Then, the media was removed and replaced by DMEM containing the tested compounds at different concentrations. After 5 h of incubation, the activity of luciferase in the cell lysate was measured using the dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, USA) and a Luminometer Centro XS 3 LB 960 (Berthold Technology, Inc.). Because the greater than 33 kDa protein fused to the N-terminus of luciferase remarkably decreased luciferase activity, 30 the detection of luciferase activity was considered a measure of the cis-cleavage by the SARS-CoV 3CL pro . 22 4.7. Real-time analysis of ligand interaction with SARS-CoV 3CL pro by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) SPR measurements were performed on a Reichert SPR SR7500 instrument kindly provided on loan from WooJung BSC Inc. The enzyme was dialyzed in PBS buffer prior to immobilization. The surface was activated with a 7 min injection of EDC/sulfo-NHS mixture at 200/50 mM concentration. The protein was diluted to 100 lg/mL with 20 mM acetate buffer (pH 5.0) and injected for 10 min. The active sites were quenched with 1 M ethanolamine buffer at pH 8.0 and washed with phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.2 (PBS). The binding surface was stabilized with 3-5 blank injections of PBS. PBS was used as a running and sample dilution buffer for all of the experiments. The tested inhibitors were first prepared as 20 mM stock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and further diluted into PBS immediately prior to the experiments. Analyte binding was analyzed using automated runs of the twofold dilution series and two 'zero concentration' injections. Regeneration steps were performed using 10 mM NaOH. The data was analyzed with the Scrubber2 software. Referenced and blanked binding dissociation curves were fit globally to a two-state binding kinetics model.",
