In the experimental model, diarrhea was induced in nine healthy calves by administering cold milk (below 4\u00b0C) twice a day for 2 days. The calves were randomly assigned to the isotonic saline (ISS), acetated Ringer's (AR) or acetated Ringer's with 5% dextrose (ARD) groups, with three calves assigned to each group. The calves received 80 ml/kg of their designated solution, at a flow rate of 20 ml/kg/hr. Infusion of ISS, AR and ARD were all found to be safe and effective in increasing plasma volume. Intravenous (IV) infusion of ISS resulted in the acidification secondary to dilution, while AR and ARD infusion inhibited acidification. In addition, prevention of catabolism was observed only with IV infusion of ARD. Sixteen calves with spontaneous diarrhea were enrolled in the clinical study. The calves were randomly assigned to the AR or ARD groups, with eight calves being assigned to each group. The calves received 100 ml/kg of their designated solution, at a flow rate of 25 ml/kg/hr. Intravenous infusion of AR and ARD was found to be effective in increasing plasma volume and inhibiting acidification. Only infusion of ARD prevented catabolism, but it also led to hyperglycemia. Our results suggest that a solution containing dextrose may be beneficial for wasting diarrheic calves.",

Calves can easily metabolize acetate ions, which have an alkalizing effect [12] in muscle [2, 18] . Naylor et al.

            "text": "Malabsorptive diarrhea in calves results in decreased absorption of not only electrolytes and water, but also carbohydrates, lipids and amino acids [8] . Diarrheic calves also become anorexic. Todd et al. [23] reported that lack of food intake for 30 hr caused hypoglycemia and an increase in beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) levels indicating lipid mobilization. Similarly, calves fed only electrolyte solutions developed significant increases in BHBA and nonesterified fatty acid concentrations, indicating that these calves had a profound negative energy balance [5] . The mean fat content of feces was higher in calves with diarrhea than in healthy calves, and the mean caloric uptake from milk decreased by 31% in diarrheic calves compared to that in healthy calves. Negative energy balance continues throughout the course of illness [25] . This suggests that diarrheic calves need more energy for maintenance. Normally, brain and red blood cells use glucose as an energy source. When stores of glucose are low, gluconeogenesis is activated. Therefore, maintenance of glycometabolism is important to prevent muscle catabolism and lipolysis. The addition of dextrose to IV fluid solutions is routinely used to provide energy [4] . The addition of dextrose to IV fluid solutions intraoperatively suppresses protein catabolism and the formation of ketone bodies in humans [19, 24] . For the same reason, the addition of dextrose to IV fluid solutions may be useful for the treatment of calves with wasting diseases, such as diarrhea.",

All calves had ad libitum access to starter, hay and water throughout the study. Three of the calves were used twice in this study after allowing a rest interval of more than 1 week. The calves were deemed healthy based on physical examination and hematologic analysis. All calves were clinically normal before the start of the experiment, as determined by vital signs, physical appearance, milk intake, and urine and feces production. Dryness and coolness of the mucous membranes, sinking of the eyes and eyelid skin tenting of approximately 0.5 sec were the main clinical signs observed following the induction of diarrhea. All calves became dehydrated, and metabolic acidosis was induced secondary to diarrhea caused by the following acidification procedure. The calves were primed with cold milk, which was prepared by adding 400 g of commercial milk replacement powder (Mo-toku milk 02 for calf, Scientific Feed Laboratory Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) to 3 l of cold water (below 4\u00b0C). The milk was administered twice a day for 2 days through a feeding tube [15] . Before the start of and at the end of the acidification procedure, base excess (BE), hemoglobin concentration (Hb) and BHBA were measured. A 14-gauge catheter (Surefrow Catheter SR-OT1464C, Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted into the right jugular vein of the conscious calves. The catheter was then connected to an ordinary drip tube that controlled the flow rate. The calves were randomly assigned to the ISS group (n=3; IV infusion of ISS), AR group (n=3; IV infusion of AR) or ARD group (n=3; IV infusion of ARD). The calves received 80 ml/kg of the designated solution, at a flow rate of 20 ml/kg/hr, resulting in a flow rate for the dextrose of 1.0 g/kg/hr. Initiation of fluid infusion was designated as time 0 (base). Venous blood samples were collected at base, as well as 0.5, 1, 4 and 24 hr after initiation of fluid therapy. Venous blood samples were anaerobically collected in a heparinized 1-ml syringe from the left jugular vein, and the tips of the syringes were capped after collection.",

The cholera toxin of Vibrio cholera and the heat labile toxin (LT) of E. coli cause secretory diarrhea [8] . In a clinical study, C. parvum was isolated from 13/16 diarrheic calves. Following infection, clinical signs peaked at 3 to 5 days and lasted for 4 to 17 days [6] . C. parvum damages the small intestinal villi, which results in failure of electrolyte and water absorption (malabsorptive diarrhea). Calves with diarrhea resulting in dehydration had increased D-lactate concentrations and a negative energy balance caused by anorexia and malabsorption of nutrients [20] . Hypoglycemia has been reported in diarrheic calves, which were found to be weak, lethargic or comatose [21] . Hypoglycemia, often occurring in combination with hyperlactatemia, was typically observed in the terminal stages of the disease [11] . Therefore, intravenous fluid therapy must supply sufficient sodium to normalize the extracellular fluid (ECF) volume, provide an alkalizing agent to correct the metabolic acidosis and provide energy because most calves that have diarrhea are in a state of negative energy balance [5] . In this study, we used an experimental model and a clinical study to evaluate whether dextrose administered intravenously to diarrheic calves was an effective treatment.",

However, at the end of fluid therapy, the rPV of the AR group was found to have increased significantly than that of the ARD group.

A possible explanation for the difference in rPV was the distribution of fluid between the plasma and interstitial compartments in the ARD group.

Intravenous infusion of both ISS and AR led to increased BHBA concentrations. After rehydration, the Na + /K + -ATPase pump and Cori cycle could be activated in calves with diarrhea; both use energy in the form of ATP. Consequently, ISS and AR without dextrose did not prevent exhaustion. On the contrary, in both the experimental model and the clinical study, we demonstrated that IV infusion of ARD prevented catabolism. This suggests that the addition of dextrose maintains glycometabolism and inhibits increases in BHBA caused by lipolysis. In the experimental model, ARD infusion induced a rapid and significant decrease in BHBA. In the clinical study, ARD infusion resulted in significant decreases in BHBA values at the end of fluid therapy. This suggests that exhaustion occurred more severely in the clinical study than it did in the experimental model. Several investigators have reported that the addition of dextrose to fluids maintains blood glucose and inhibits glyconeogenesis. As a result, the breakdown of skeletal muscle and formation of ketone bodies in patients undergoing surgery is controlled [13, 19, 24] . Therefore, ARD containing 5% dextrose may be useful for the treatment of wasting diseases like diarrhea. Infection with C. parvum has been shown to induce severe villous atrophy in calves [11] , leading to malabsorptive diarrhea. Absorption is impaired due to the loss of mature villous epithelial cells and their associated transporters as well as a decrease in total surface area [7] . For prevention of catabolism and maintenance of adequate nutrition, the addition of dextrose to IV fluid solutions may be more effective than the oral administration of dextrose.",
