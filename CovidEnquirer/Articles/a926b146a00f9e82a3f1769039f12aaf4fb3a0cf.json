            "text": "Carbocyclic nucleosides have been extensively targeted due to their potent antiviral and anti-cancer activities. 1 Naturally occurring deoxynucleotides are needed to synthesize viral DNA. Carbovir (\u00c0)-1 and related compounds are analogs of natural deoxynucleotides and compete for incorporation into the growing viral DNA chain. 2 Incorporation of dideoxynucleosides such as carbovir results in chain termination and disruption of the viral replication process. 3 In particular, carbovir (\u00c0)-1 has shown significant in vitro anti-HIV activity through its triphosphate analog by inhibiting HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. 2 Its congener, abacavir (\u00c0)-2, has a considerably improved toxicity profile and higher oral bioavailability. 4 Abacavir is metabolized to the triphosphate of carbovir by a unique mechanism that circumvents formation of carbovir itself. 5 Consequently, abacavir has in vitro activity and in vivo efficacy against HIV. It has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of HIV infection under the brand name Ziagen. 6 Due to the important activity of carbocyclic nucleosides, there is continued interest in the syntheses of new analogs. One approach has been to extend the 4 0 -carbon side chain. 7 Although the enantioselective syntheses of 5 0 -homocarbovir (\u00c0)-3a and 5 0 -homoabacavir (\u00c0)-3b have been reported 8 (Fig. 1) , only 5 0 -homocarbovir (AE)-3a 9 has been evaluated in antiviral assays and showed poor activity in limited testing. 9a To further investigate the activity profiles of (\u00c0)-3a as well as the previously untested (\u00c0)-3b, we developed a new synthetic route from an acylnitroso-derived hetero DielseAlder cycloadduct, which utilizes decarboxylative rearrangements of allyl 2,2,2-trifluroethylmalonates to install the 4 0hydroxyethyl side chain. The modification of a single step in the sequence allowed for access to the unprecedented epi-4 0 analogs (\u00fe)-4a and (\u00fe)-4b.",

            "text": "Our research group's continued interest in the syntheses of diverse carbocyclic nucleosides 10,11 has led to the development of a reliable method for the synthesis of cyclopentenol (\u00c0)-7. 12 We recently reported the Cp 2 TiCl-catalyzed reduction of Boc cycloadduct (AE)-6. 13 The reaction was performed on large scale (50 mmol) and an isolated yield of 79% was obtained after the resultant silylated alcohol was deprotected with a simple acidic work-up with 1 M HCl (Scheme 1). Kinetic enzymatic resolution of (AE)-7 was achieved with commercially available immobilized Candida antarctica B lipase to ultimately form the enantiopure alcohol (\u00c0)-7. 12 Cyclopentenol (\u00c0)-7 was coupled with 3-oxo-3-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)propanoic acid 8 to form allyl 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl malonate (\u00c0)-9 in high yield (Scheme 2). As previously reported, malonate (\u00c0)-9 underwent facile decarboxylative rearrangement in the presence of Pd(dba) 2 and dppe to provide homoallylic ester (\u00c0)-10 with complete diastereo-and regio-control. 14 Formation of the p-allyl palladium complex proceeded on the less hindered face and anti attack by the in situ generated nucleophilic alkoxy ethenolate species afforded the product with retention of configuration. Reduction of (\u00c0)-10 with 2 equiv of diisobutylaluminum hydride (DIBAL-H) yielded the desired alcohol (\u00c0)-11. 14 We then turned our attention to construction of the chloroguanine base. 2, 15 Upon deprotection of the Boc group with 12 M HCl, aminoalcohol (\u00c0)-11 underwent nucleophilic aromatic substitution with 2-amino-4,6-dichloropyrimidine to afford alcohol (\u00fe)-12 in 50% yield over two steps (Scheme 3). Azo coupling of (\u00fe)-12 with 4chlorobenzenediazonium chloride followed by reduction of the resulting aryl azo compound with Zn in acetic acid afforded triaminopyrimidine (\u00c0)-13. 2-Propanol was selected as the co-solvent over ethanol due to the formation of side products from reaction with ethanol. 16 Cyclization of (\u00c0)-13 with triethyl orthoformate in the presence of catalytic acid provided chloroguanine (\u00c0)-14. Careful monitoring of the reaction time was necessary to prevent substitution of the 6-Cl group with ethanol, which formed an inseparable byproduct. 17 Chloroguanine (\u00c0)-14 was refluxed in 0.33 M NaOH for 2 h to produce 5 0 -homocarbovir (\u00c0)-3a in 60% yield (Scheme 4). Alternatively, (\u00c0)-14 was stirred in 2-propanol at 70 C in the presence of excess cyclopropylamine to form 5 0homoabacavir (\u00c0)-3b in 80% yield.",

In a clean oven dried 15 mL sealed tube equipped with a Teflon screw cap, a solution of (\u00fe)-20 (30 mg, 0.107 mmol) in 0.33 M NaOH (1 mL) was stirred at 100 C for 2 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated, adsorbed on silica gel and purified by column chromatography (silica gel; eluted with 15% CH 3 OH/CH 2 Cl 2 ) to give 17 mg of (\u00fe)-4a as a white powder (60% purified by column chromatography (silica gel; eluted with 6e8% CH 3 OH/CH 2 Cl 2 ) to give 21 mg of (\u00fe)-4b as a clear oil (90% 39.3, 39.7, 42.9, 60.6, 61.6, 115.1, 129.2, 137.1, 143.6, 151.7 (12) . To an EtOH (6.5 mL) solution of (\u00c0)-11 (720 mg, 3.17 mmol) was added 12 M HCl (0.33 mL, 3.80 mmol) and the reaction was stirred at 80 C for 4 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated to a light brown oil. To a solution of the oil and 2amino-4,6-dichloropyrimidine (574 mg, 3.33 mmol) in n-BuOH (6.5 mL) was added triethylamine (1.10 mL, 7.92 mmol). The reaction was stirred in a sealed tube at 110 C for 4 days. The reaction mixture was concentrated to a solid. The crude material was adsorbed on silica gel, and purified by column chromatography (silica gel; eluted with 1e2% CH 3 OH/CH 2 Cl 2 to remove unreacted 2amino-4,6-dichloropyrimidine, then 5% CH 3 OH/CH 2 Cl 2 to elute product) to afford 375 mg of (\u00fe)-12 as a tan solid (50% 4.1.6.

To this solution was added a solution of sodium nitrite (68 mg, 0.981 mmol) in water (0.8 mL) and the mixture was allowed to stir at 0 C for 10 min. The resultant diazonium salt solution was added to a mixture of cyclopentene (\u00fe)-12 (200 mg, 0.785 mmol), acetic acid (4 mL), water (4 mL), and sodium acetate trihydrate (1.6 g). The reaction mixture was stirred overnight at rt. The yellow precipitate was filtered and washed with cold water until the eluting filtrate was pH 7. The solids were dried under vacuum to yield 260 mg of product (84%). A portion (180 mg) of the material was dissolved in water/i-PrOH (5 mL/5 mL) and Zn dust (296 mg, 4.53 mmol) was added. The mixture was stirred at 90 C for 4 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated to a solid. The crude material was adsorbed on silica gel and purified by column chromatography (silica gel; eluted with 2e5% CH 3 OH/CH 2 Cl 2 to remove p-chloroaniline and other impurities, then 6e7% CH 3 OH/CH 2 Cl 2 to elute product) to afford 93 mg of (\u00c0)-13 as a pink oil (76% 4.1.9. (\u00fe)-2-((1S,4R)-4-(2-Amino-6-chloropyrimidin-4-ylamino)cyclopent-2-enyl)ethanol (18). To an EtOH (1.6 mL) solution of (\u00fe)-17 (180 mg, 0.791 mmol) was added 12 M HCl (0.079 mL, 0.791 mmol) and the reaction was stirred at 80 C for 4 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated to a light brown oil. To a solution of the oil and 2amino-4,6-dichloropyrimidine (143 mg, 0.831 mmol) in n-BuOH (2 mL) was added triethylamine (0.275 mL, 1.98 mmol). The reaction was stirred in a sealed tube at 110 C for 4 days. The reaction mixture was concentrated to a solid. The crude material was adsorbed on silica gel and purified by column chromatography (silica gel; eluted with 1e3% CH 3 OH/CH 2 Cl 2 to remove unreacted 2amino-4,6-dichloropyrimidine, then 3e4% CH 3 OH/CH 2 Cl 2 to elute product) to afford 125 mg of (\u00fe)-18 as a tan oil (60% ",
