The most frequently detected viruses among children aged 6-15 years were enterovirus/rhinovirus and influenza virus A, whereas most non-influenza viruses were more frequently detected in younger children. Higher body temperature was more common for illnesses associated with influenza viruses than for those associated with non-influenza viruses, but other symptoms were largely similar across all infections. The seasonality pattern varied among different viruses, with influenza virus A being the predominant virus detected in winter, and enterovirus/rhinovirus being more commonly detected than influenza virus A in the other three seasons, except for 2009.

Although ARIs can be caused by a wide range of different respiratory viral pathogens, ascertainment of the exact causative agents is rarely clinically indicated, and is thus not routinely performed. Among the small proportion of patients needing hospitalization, significant disease burdens have been attributed to adenovirus (AdV) in children, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus A (IFVA) in all age groups, and rhinovirus (RhV) and parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV 3) in children and the elderly [2] . However, the full spectrum of disease burden among the majority of patients with ARIs presenting in community outpatient settings has remained largely elusive. Seasonal patterns of ARIs caused by influenza virus [3] and RSV [4] have been better described in some geographical areas, but those of most other respiratory viruses remain poorly understood.",

All consenting subjects completed a short data collection form, and had two sets of pooled nasal and throat swab specimens collected by a trained nurse. One specimen was stored immediately in viral transport medium for subsequent virological testing; the other specimen was tested on site with the QuickVue Influenza A + B rapid diagnostic test (Quidel, San Diego, CA, USA). Subjects with a positive rapid test result and their household contacts were further followed up [6] , but, in the present analysis, we also analysed laboratory results from the other specimen from all subjects, regardless of their rapid test result. Proxy written informed consent was obtained for all participants from their parents or legal guardians, with additional written consent being obtained from those aged 8-16 years. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Hong Kong University.

Logistic regression was used to examine the association of different symptoms with influenza or non-influenza virus infection. To assess the seasonal pattern, percentages of different positive specimens across different seasons were compared by use of the chi-square test or FE. Here, we defined winter as December to February, spring as March to May, summer as June to August, and autumn as September to November. Also, logistic regression was used to assess the association between virus detection and meteorological factors, including temperature, absolute humidity, and precipitation. All statistical analyses were performed with R version 2.15.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). . The detection rate was significantly different across the 4 years, with the highest rate being in 2009, which might due to the pandemic H1N1 IFVA. There was no difference in sex distribution across the years, whereas there was a significant difference in age group percentage across years, with a higher percentage of children in the older age group (6-15 years) than in the younger age group (<6 years) for the first 3 years (2007-2009) but not for 2010 (Table S1 ).",

Specifically, IFVA and IFVB were detected significantly more frequently in the older age group, whereas most of the other non-influenza viruses were more frequently detected in the younger age group, with the exception of CoV, which was detected at similar frequencies in the two age groups. We further stratified the analysis by separating 2009 from the other 3 years, to determine whether the occurrence of the pandemic H1N1 IFVA in 2009 had affected the seasonal pattern of other common respiratory viruses. On comparison with the other 3 years with usual seasonal influenza activities, the detection pattern of other respiratory viruses during 2009 was broadly similar, with most non-influenza viruses being more frequently detected in the younger age group. Important exceptions included CoV and IFVA, which were more frequently detected in the older age group, and IFVB and BoV, for which no significant difference was seen between the two age groups for 2009 (Table S2 ).

On comparison of infections with different viruses detected (BoV was excluded here, because there was no detection of BoV in the older age group), fever was reported significantly more often for IFVA (83.2% and 79.7%), IFVB (80.6% and 82.2%) and AdV (82.8% and 75.0%) than for the other viruses, in both age groups (\u03c7 2 , p < 0.001) ( Table 2 ). Cough was more frequent for MPV (100%), BoV (100%) and RSV (96.7%) in the younger age group, and for MPV (97.6%) and IFVA (85.5%) in the older age group (FE, p < 0.001). The presence of a runny nose was most frequent for EnV/RhV in the younger age group (FE, p 0.003), but was not significant in the older age group. Sputum was most frequently reported for RSV (72.2%) in the younger age group, and for MPV (81.0%) in the older age group (\u03c7 2 , p < 0.001). Results from logistic regression suggested that the occurrence of fever was associated with a significantly increased likelihood of influenza virus (IFVA and IFVB) infection vs. infection with other respiratory viruses (OR 4.78, 95% CI 2.96-7.74) in the younger age group. Cough, runny nose and sputum were also associated with an increased likelihood of influenza virus detection in the older age group (Table S2 ). Fig. 1 shows the percentages of all positive specimens attributable to each viral pathogen during different seasons in 2009 and other years. IFVA and EnV/RhV were generally the two most frequently detected pathogens in all seasons. IFVA was most frequently detected in winter, both for 2009 (57.3%, p < 0.001) and for the other years (31.3%, p < 0.005). In fact, in 2009, when the pandemic H1N1 IFVA was predominant, it was responsible for the vast majority of all positive specimens (30.2-57.3%) in different seasons. EnV/RhV was next most frequently detected virus over the whole year, particularly in spring and autumn. RSV was more frequently detected in nonwinter seasons (12.7%) during all years, but this was less marked in 2009. For other viral pathogens, the seasonal patterns were similar and not significantly different. For various meteorological factors, logistic regression results showed that influenza virus was negatively associated with temperature, whereas RSV was positively associated with temperature. EnV/ RhV was positively associated with precipitation, and none of the other viruses was significantly associated with any of the three meteorological factors (Table S3 ).",

The co-detection rate was also higher in the younger age group, which is consistent with other studies [11] . Co-detection of more than one respiratory virus has been frequently reported; however, the clinical significance of codetection is unclear, with previous studies giving conflicting results regarding whether co-infection is associated with an increase in the severity of related respiratory disease [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] .",

Despite the fact that most previous studies have indicated a predominantly winter and autumn seasonality for influenza virus and EnV/RhV [18, 19] , we found that both viruses were rather commonly detected over the whole year, with a significant predominance of IFVA in the winter for all of the study years. In 2009, when the H1N1 IFVA was predominant, it was responsible for the majority of positive specimens in all seasons. RSV was more frequently detected in non-winter seasons, and was less marked in 2009. Another study found that RSV activity peaked in July and August, and was positively associated with temperature [20] . The seasonality pattern of an autumn peak for CoV-NL63 infections reported by a previous study, however, could not be demonstrated in this study, as all CoVs were analysed together, without species identification [21] . Although the findings regarding associations with temperature or precipitation may help to shed some light on the observed seasonality patterns of different infections, their underlying mechanism remaines largely controversial [19, 22] .",

The substantial burden of respiratory infection caused by viruses other than influenza viruses shows the importance of improved surveillance and preventive efforts in the community setting. Further studies are also important to better characterize the burden of these non-influenza viruses from other perspectives, including morbidity and school absence among children. A better understanding of the seasonality patterns of these common respiratory viruses would also help to inform better disease surveillance, to inform proper healthcare action planning and decisions.",
