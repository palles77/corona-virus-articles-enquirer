            "text": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the most common chronic viral infection in the world. An estimated 2 billion people are infected, and more than 350 million are chronic carriers of the virus [1] . Due to an insufficient immune response, some individuals with HBV infection can develop chronic hepatitis, which can eventually result in liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). While the underlying mechanisms for HBV-induced chronic hepatitis remain unclear, several studies indicate that dendritic cell (DC) function is impaired in patients with chronic hepatitis B [2, 3] . DCs are potent antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that can present antigen to T cells and activate naive T cells. Multiple receptor molecules on the surface of DCs, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), participate in the recognition and uptake of pathogens, and can regulate the expression of co-stimulatory molecules [4] . In particular, DCspecific ICAM-3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) is an important CLR that is mainly expressed on the surface of mature and immature DCs [5] . DC-SIGN plays an important role in the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) [5] . Moreover, previous studies have shown that DC-SIGN is involved in the immune escape of multiple pathogenic microorganisms, including HIV-1, Ebola virus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), Dengue fever virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), SARS-coronavirus, mycobacterium tuberculosis, Helicobacter pylori, fungus, and some parasites [6, 7] . Unfortunately, the mechanisms behind immune escape mediated by DC-SIGN remain unclear. It may be that DC-SIGN directly recognizes mannose oligosaccharides found on the viral envelope of HBV. Through modifications to these mannose oligosaccharides on its viral envelope, HBV could potential evade the host immune system. Indeed, it has been shown that DC-SIGN does not recognize wild-type HBV but does recognize a high-mannose type HBV produced by the application of a class \u2160 \u03b1-mannosidase inhibitor, kifunensine [8, 9] . Moreover, in our previous studies, we found that the high-mannose type HBV could promote the maturation of DCs, increase IL-12 secretion, and effectively stimulate the proliferation of allogeneic lymphocytes, and that these effects were blocked by specific anti-DC-SIGN antibodies [10] . Therefore, demannosylation appears to be beneficial to HBV to escape DC-SIGN recognition and avoid the consequent immune elimination. Demannosylation of glycoproteins occurs through a family of mannosidases that trim mannan in the N-oligosaccharide. Human Class \u2160 \u03b1-mannosidases include the ER \u03b1-1, 2-mannosidase I (MAN1B1), and three Golgi \u03b1-1,2-mannosidases, namely \u03b1-mannosidase IA (MAN1A1), \u03b1-mannosidase IB (MAN1A2), and \u03b1-mannosidase IC (MAN1C1). Generally, MAN1B1 firstly trims \u03b1-1,2-mannose from Man9GlcNAc2-Asn, and then MAN1A1, MAN1A2, and MAN1C1 trim the residual \u03b1-1,2-mannose, to generate Man5GlcNAc2-Asn. These processes are dependent on the varying levels of the mannosidase subtypes in different cell types [11] . There are glycosylation sites on the surface of HBV envelope proteins, which could be glycosylated by the host [12] . Therefore, it is not surprising that HBV infection has previously been shown to upregulate the expression of ER degradation-enhancing \u03b1-mannosidases (EDEMs) in order to increase demannosylation [13] . However, few studies have investigated the effects of HBV on the expression of class \u2160 \u03b1-mannosidases.",

In turn, DC-SIGN can no longer recognize the HBV glycoprotein coat, allowing the virus to escape from immune attack.

Protein glycosylation has multiple functions, and sometimes assists in evading immune surveillance [21] . Viruses use the host cell glycosylation system to synthesize and modify their envelope proteoglycans, and thus, the structures of viral envelope glycoproteins can be affected by the glycosylation mechanisms in the host [22] . Indeed, previous studies have shown that applying low-doses of glucosidase inhibitors to host cells changes the phenotype of the viral envelope proteins [23] . This, in turn, can reduce viral infection and affect the virus assembly and/or particle release [23] . For example, the \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitor NB-DNJ was previously shown to prevent the HBV from correct folding and the release of viral envelope molecules, and thus, could dose-dependently reduce the virus level [9] . On the other hand, while the \u03b1-mannosidase I inhibitor the expression of \u03b1-1, 2-mannosidases, we measured the expression of MAN1A1, MAN1A2, MAN1B1, and MAN1C1 in hepatoma cells with or without HBV transfection. MAN1A1, MANA2, MAN1B1, and MAN1C1 protein levels in the HepG2.2.15 and N10 cell lines with stable HBV-transfection were higher than in HepG2 cells (Figure 1 ). To confirm whether HBV infection was the cause of the upregulation, AD38 cells, which express the HBV genome under the control of a tetracycline (Tet)-off promoter, were further investigated. The expression of HBV genes in the AD38 cell line was restricted in the presence of Tet. When Tet was absent, these cells produced 3.5 kb HBV pregenomic RNA and secreted virus-like particles into the supernatant. We found that \u03b1-1,2-mannosidase expression in the AD38 cells without Tet was higher than in cells with Tet ( Figure 1A and B) .",

Western blot was used to determine the expression of HBx ( Figure  3A ), HBp ( Figure 3B ), HBc ( Figure 3C) , HBs, preS2, and preS1 ( Figure 3D ); whereas ELISA was used to estimate the expression of HBe ( Figure 3E ). The kifunensine did not affect the production or secretion of HBV virus particles, it did increase its recognition by DC-SIGN, resulting in activation of the immune response [8, 9] . Moreover, in our previous studies, we found that demannosylation is beneficial to HBV to escape DC-SIGN recognition [10] . Therefore, the upregulation of host \u03b1-mannosidases by HBV, as observed in this study, appears to contribute to viral escape [10] . HBV contains three envelope proteins made up of the preS1, preS2, and S domains: the large (L, preS1/preS2/S), middle (M, preS2/S), and small (S) envelope proteins [24] . The L and S proteins can only be singly glycosylated (P39 and GP42 for the L protein, and P24 and GP27 for S protein). There is also a N-glycosylation site (NXS/T) at N146 of the S region. On the other hand, the M protein can be bi-glycosylated (at the GP33 and GP36 sites) [25] . We used plasmids encoding different HBV proteins, including the L, M, and S proteins, to transfect HepG2 cells. Surprisingly, we found that only the L, M, and S proteins could increase the expression of MAN1C1; however, such an effect was not found for the other HBV proteins. As all the L, M, and S proteins include the S domain, we hypothesized that it was this region that induced the increase of MAN1C1. Therefore, the S protein was used to represent the envelope protein in the consequent experiments.",

We examined whether the HBV envelope protein activated the PPAR\u03b3 pathway to increase the expression of MAN1C1 protein. However, we found that inhibition of the PPAR\u03b3 pathway with GW9662 did not affect the HBV envelope protein-induced upregulation of MAN1C1 expression. On the other hand, when the PPAR\u03b1 pathway was inhibited with MK886, the envelope protein could not upregulate MAN1C1 expression. Our results indicate that MAN1C1 expression is associated with the PPAR\u03b1 pathway, whereas previous studies have shown that MAN1C1 expression in endothelial cells is associated with the PPAR\u03b3 pathway [14] .
