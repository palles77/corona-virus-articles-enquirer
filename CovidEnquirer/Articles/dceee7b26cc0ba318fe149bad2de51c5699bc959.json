As a global society, we must contend with an array of hazards that may seem both limitless and daunting. Owing to the 24-hour news cycle and an increasingly globalized economy, we bear witness to a daily barrage of disasters. And while the vast majority of these events inflict no direct physical impact on our person, they tug at our conscience and challenge the notion that disaster risk reduction is possible. As individuals, however, the hazards we face are considerably limited on account of genetics, geographic location, spatial movements, personal habits, activities, finances, education, and a measure of pure chance.",

For instance, a landslide that terminates in a river may lead to a flood. The Great East Japan Earthquake, which occurred in 2011, caused secondary and tertiary hazards that together proved devastating. The initial earthquake caused a massive tsunami, which in turn flooded a coastal power plant, and thus resulted in a nuclear disaster. Hazard sequencing, described in the following sections, helps to determine these secondary, tertiary, or subsequent threats. Some hazards cannot be easily assigned to any one category, and this often leads to confusion in the hazard identification process. For instance, a tsunami is a water-based or hydrologic hazard, yet it is always the result of some other precipitating seismic or mass-movement hazard such as an earthquake, a volcano, or a landslide. Hazard risk managers can simplify the process by applying logical conventions to the identification process, such as identifying and categorizing hazards according to their generating forces. Such a convention is applied in this chapter.",

This communicates how often adverse events are likely to occur as a result of the hazard. Calculation of actual frequencies is detailed in chapter 3. \u2022 Magnitude and potential intensity of the hazard. Depending on the hazard, this measure may be a single figure or a range of possibilities. Estimates of magnitude and/or intensity help disaster managers determine a hazard's possible consequences and identify appropriate mitigation measures. \u2022 Location(s) of the hazard. The basic hazard map is highly informative for most hazards and thus sufficient to meet the needs of the risk analysis that follows. However, when there are individual areas or regions within the area of study that require special mention and, likewise, special consideration, this may be included as a separate comment or detail. This helps to ensure that those special areas are not overlooked in subsequent processes. \u2022 Estimated spatial extent of impact of the hazard. This information is also likely to be found on hazard maps. However, there may be special additional comments or facts for some hazards that need to be included separately from the visual representation provided by the map. \u2022 Duration of hazard event, emergency, or disaster. For hazards that have occurred frequently in the past, it is possible to give an accurate estimation of the hazard's duration based on previous response efforts. However, for disasters that rarely occur or have never occurred in the area of study, such as a nuclear accident or a specific type of hazardous material spill, estimations are often provided based upon the hazard description, community vulnerability, emergency response capacity, and anticipated external humanitarian response. This figure will generally be a rough estimate, measured in days rather than hours or minutes, but will be very useful in subsequent steps that analyze possible consequences. \u2022 Seasonal pattern or other time-based patterns of the hazard. This is simply a description of the time of year that a hazard is most likely to appear, if such a pattern exists. For instance, hurricane season in North America is from June through November, while cyclone season in the South Pacific is from November through April. Knowing seasonal patterns also allows disaster managers to analyze interactions between hazards that could occur simultaneously. \u2022 Speed of onset of the hazard event. Knowledge about a hazard's speed of onset helps planners in the preparedness and mitigation phases determine what actions are possible, impossible, or vital given the amount of lead-up time they are likely to have. Public disaster preparedness efforts and disaster communications systems are both influenced in this manner. Warning systems and evacuation plans must reflect the anticipated availability or lack of time within which action is possible. If responders can be readied before the disaster, the speed of response will be increased significantly. The increase in pre-disaster recognition of cyclonic storms has enabled a significant drop in the fatalities they cause, perhaps most significantly because of the days of pre-disaster action meteorological monitoring systems are now able to provide. \u2022 Availability of warnings for the hazard. This information is directly linked to a hazard's speed of onset, but remains independent in some ways. Each hazard has distinct characteristics that either do or do not lend themselves to prediction. Some fast-onset hazards such as volcanic eruptions can be predicted with some degree of confidence (although not always), while some hazards with slower onset times, such as biological terrorism or a pandemic virus, cannot be accurately predicted. Yet other hazards provide no advance warning, such as a chemical accident. Even if advance knowledge of a disaster is possible, the capabilities of the local warning system further determine the possibility of adequately informing the public about an impending disaster. Local warning systems are more than the physical alarms, sirens, or announcements; they are also the public's ability to receive, understand, and act upon the warnings they receive. All factors must be considered when determining warning availability. The risk statement may include both the available technology that could provide warnings of the hazards and the local system's current status of warnings for each specific hazard.",

When very large and explosive volcanic eruptions occur, ejecting tens to hundreds of cubic kilometers of magma onto the earth's surface, the ground below can subside or collapse into the emptied space. The resulting depression is called a caldera. These spaces can be more than 25 kilometers in diameter and several kilometers deep. \u2022 Cinder or scoria cones. Cinder (or scoria) cones are simple volcanic structures formed by rocks and congealed lava ejected from a single vent. As the gas-charged material is blown violently into the air, it breaks into small fragments that solidify and fall as cinders around the vent, forming a circular or oval cone. Most cinder cones have a bowl-shaped crater at the summit and rarely rise more than 1,000 feet above their surroundings. \u2022 Composite volcanoes and stratovolcanoes. Many of the earth's great mountains are composite volcanoes, also called stratovolcanoes. These structures typically present as very large, steepsided, symmetrical cones formed from alternating layers of lava flows, volcanic ash, cinders, blocks (rock fragments greater than 64 mm diameter that are ejected from a volcano in a solid form), and bombs (volcanic material ejected in a liquid state that cools to a solid form before falling to the ground). Composite volcanoes can rise as much as 8,000 feet above their bases, and most have a crater at the summit that contains a central vent or a clustered group of vents. The essential feature of a composite volcano is a conduit system through which magma from a reservoir deep in the earth's crust rises to the surface, exiting through the volcano's central crater and/ or side walls. The volcano is built up by the accumulation of material erupted through the conduit and increases in size as lava, cinders, ash, and so forth are added to its slopes. \u2022 Continental volcanoes. These volcanoes are located in unstable, mountainous belts that have thick roots of granite or granite-like rock. Magma is generated near the base of the mountain root and rises slowly or intermittently along fractures in the crust. \u2022 Island-arc volcanoes. When one plate thrusts under another, usually below the ocean's surface, volcanic activity appears several hundred miles forward of the subduction zone in the shape of the leading edge of the underlying plate. A chain of islands is often thrust up in an arc shape from the ocean floor. Examples include the Aleutian Islands, Taiwan, and Japan. Eruptions associated with these processes tend to be highly explosive. \u2022 Lava plateaus. In some shield volcano eruptions (see later in the list), basaltic lava pours out slowly from long fissures instead of central vents and floods the surrounding countryside, forming broad plateaus. Iceland is an example of this kind of volcano. \u2022 Lava domes. These structures form when lava that is thrust from a vent is too sticky to flow very far and forms a steep mound. Chillahuita in Chile is an example of a large lava dome. \u2022 Maars (tuff cones). These structures are shallow, flat-floored craters that likely have formed above vents as a result of a violent expansion of magmatic gas or steam. Maars range from 200 to 6,500 feet across and from 30 to 650 feet deep, and most are filled with water, forming natural lakes. Thousands of flows pour out in all directions over great distances from a central summit vent or a group of vents, building a broad, gently sloping cone with a profile much like that of a warrior's shield. The Hawaiian Islands are shield volcanoes.",

The great changes that occur within the earth that are associated with the movement of lava often affect the pressure built up between surface plates, causing minor earthquakes to occur. The explosive nature of the volcano can also cause the plates to shake. Although these events are not often associated with widespread damage, they can cause structural damage to the volcano or surrounding land, leading to rockfalls, landslides, and other hazards. \u2022 Rockfalls and landslides. As a volcano erupts, it often shakes and becomes unstable. Sections of the volcano may collapse inward or slough away completely. This results in the release of debris that becomes subject to the forces of gravity and moves in massive quantities, covering great distances. \u2022 Mudflows (lahars). Volcanic eruptions are often accompanied by the generation of large volumes of water. This water can come from a range of sources, including snow pack that accumulated on the volcano during periods of inactivity, cloudbursts resulting from the eruption, and water stored in a crater lake. The water, which mixes with ash from the eruption and soil from the mountainside, turns to a thick mud and rushes quickly down the slopes of the volcano, burying whole towns and cities as it moves. Lahars are second only to pyroclastic flows in terms of their devastating potential. (See figure 2.10.) Flash floods are also possible if the water generated does not mix with other materials before descending the slopes of the volcano. \u2022 Tsunamis. When a volcanic eruption causes major changes to the ocean floor or along ocean shores, a tsunami may be generated. The famous 1883 eruption of Krakatoa resulted in a tsunami up to 135 feet high when the volcanic structure collapsed into the ocean. More than 36,000 people living nearby were drowned. \u2022 Poisonous gases. Noxious gases, including carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and sulfur-related compounds, are often released in combination with a volcanic eruption, but they can also spontaneously release from a volcano that is not erupting. When these releases overcome a human or animal population, very few survive. Lake Nyos, located in a dormant volcano in Cameroon, released a cloud of carbon dioxide in 1986 that killed 1,700 people living in the valley that surrounded it. tHe HAZARDS A tsunami (pronounced \"soo-nah-mee\") is a series of waves generated by an undersea disturbance such as an earthquake. The word is Japanese in origin, represented by two characters: tsu (harbor) and nami (wave). Tsunamis are often incorrectly referred to as tidal waves. In truth, tides result from the gravitational influences of the moon, sun, and planets, a phenomenon that has absolutely nothing to do with the generation of tsunamis (although the height that a tsunami attains before striking a coastal area is influenced by the local tides at the time of impact).",

While all oceanic regions of the world can experience tsunamis, the countries positioned throughout the Pacific Rim face a much greater frequency of large, destructive tsunamis because of the high frequency of high-magnitude earthquakes along the seismically active \"Ring of Fire.\" (See figure 2.11.)",

Wave heights of more than 100 feet have been recorded. Far from shore, tsunamis are virtually undetectable to most ships in their path. As the waves approach the shallow coastal waters, their speed decreases significantly and they are compressed from behind. This causes the wave to grow higher and crash onto land-often resulting in great destruction, injuries, and death (NTHMP 2003) . Strange phenomena can precede a tsunami, such as the ocean receding for hundreds of feet and exposing the ocean floor. This has often resulted in the deaths of curious or bewildered individuals who have ventured out to explore or gather stranded fish, only to be drowned when the water suddenly returns. Most tsunami deaths are the result of drowning. Other associated risks include flooding, contamination of drinking water, destruction of crops, interruption of business, loss of infrastructure (roads, electrical lines, etc.), deposits of organic debris, and damaged gas lines.

Landslides are most often triggered by earthquakes and other seismic hazards, but can be generated by loss of vegetation (especially after fires), human modification, or excessive water saturation of the ground. They can move at very high speeds, or they may occur slowly over days, weeks, or even longer. Landslides can travel great distances and result in very large runoff zones, where the bulk of their devastating effects tends to occur. (See figure 2.12.) Response to landslide disasters can be difficult because the affected area is highly hazardous in the hours and days following the event. A series of landslides in Badakhshan Province, Afghanistan, in 2014 first buried approximately 1,500 people when more than 300 houses were destroyed in the initial slide. Then, when a second slide struck just hours later, another 600 who came to rescue those buried in the initial slide were buried. Locating and identifying remains can be difficult or impossible in larger events. In fact, in the Badakhshan Province landslide, the debris field is 40 meters (130 feet) thick, thus making excavation nearly impossible and leaving the government of Afghanistan no other choice but to declare the site a mass grave (Najafizada and Pearson 2014). \u2022 Rockfalls. These hazards involve the freefall, rolling, and tumbling of very loose material. They are usually the result of seismicity but can occur without external seismic pressures, especially on slopes exceeding 40\u00b0. Other common instigators of rockfalls are construction (most notably road construction through mountainous areas), ground freeze, and patterns of animal movement. \u2022 Debris flows. These hazards, also referred to as mudflows or mudslides, are less common than landslides but often much more destructive. Debris flows are dependent on the introduction of great amounts of water from prolonged rainfall, flash flooding, or very rapid snowmelt. The lubrication provided by the liquid content of the debris allows for much faster descent down the affected slope and, likewise, greater overall distances traveled from the source of the flow.",

Avalanches, or snowslides, are movements of debris composed of snow, ice, earth, rock, and any other material picked up as the mass progresses down the affected slopes. (See figure 2.13.) An avalanche occurs when the gravitational stress pulling downward on the snow exceeds the ability of the snow cover to resist it. Four factors are required for an avalanche to occur: (1) a steep slope, (2) deep snow cover, (3) a weak layer in the snow cover, and (4) a trigger. Common triggers are heavy alternating periods of snowfall, rain, and melting, or an external increase in pressure, such as from skiers, animals, or explosions. About 90 percent of all avalanches start on slopes of between 30 and 45\u00b0 (Colorado Avalanche Information Center n.d.). Failures on slopes of less than 20\u00b0 rarely occur, and snow rarely accumulates to a critical mass on slopes of 60\u00b0 or greater. It is estimated that more than one million avalanches occur each year worldwide. They typically follow the same paths from year to year, leaving scars along their courses. Trained experts thus can easily identify, with a high degree of accuracy, areas that are prone to this hazard. (See figure 2.14.)

Dam failures, which can occur because of poor maintenance or as a secondary disaster from other natural or man-made processes, often cause flooding downstream from the dam as it releases a torrent of retained water. The United States has surge preceding hurricanes, cyclones, and other major windstorms. Storm surges are often more dangerous than the wind-related impacts of the storm. Low-lying inland shores surrounding large lakes can also be negatively affected when water levels rise significantly, though the effect is not typically as pronounced as along ocean and sea coasts. \u2022 Alluvial fans. This type of landscape, often the result of previous periods of hydrologic activity, can become very dangerous during flash floods when unpredictable water drainage patterns emerge. Flooding of alluvial fans is particularly troublesome in the Middle East (Smith 1992 ).",

Experts can distinguish between a tornado and straight-line wind by observing the damages, given that debris associated with straight-line winds lie in the same direction, while tornado damage is much more scattered.

Once the fires have passed or have been extinguished and a major loss of vegetation has occurred, secondary hazards can occur, including mudslides, landslides, river silting, and flooding. (See figure 2.27.) Forecasters use the Haines Index, shown in exhibit 2.9, to indicate the potential for large fire growth. The Haines Index is a stability index especially designed for fire weather use. It is determined by combining the stability and moisture content of the lower atmosphere into a single number that correlates with large fire growth. Dry air affects fire behavior by lowering fuel moisture, which results in more fuel available for fire, and by increasing the probability of spotting-new, isolated fires caused by airborne sparks emitted by the primary fire or fires.

They are produced by cumulonimbus clouds and are usually accompanied by gusty winds, heavy rain, and occasionally hail. Three factors are required for a thunderstorm to develop. The first, which serves to fuel the storm, is moisture in the form of water vapor that must lie in the lowest atmospheric levels. Second, there must be a rapid cooling of air above these low, wet levels, decreasing in temperature with altitude, up to three miles. Finally, there must be a force strong enough to lift the low moist air to the higher, colder atmospheric layers-usually a cold front (the boundary where the cold air from one thunderstorm meets the air outside the storm, called an outflow boundary). As the moist air rises, it begins to cool, and after some time, the water vapor begins to condense into liquid drops. This process causes warming of the cloud mass, which in turn generates rising currents of air that can extend up to 10 miles in altitude. Thunderstorms are classified as non-severe and severe. Non-severe thunderstorms rarely last longer than two hours. A typical non-severe thunderstorm life cycle consists of three stages:",

The cloud extends upward to the tropopause, causing a characteristic flat (anvil) top to form.

This is known as the dewpoint. With fog, this cooling may happen for a variety of reasons, including the cooling and moistening of surface air by rain; infrared cooling of cloudless, humid air at night (also called radiation fog); and the passage of a warm, moist air mass over a cold surface (usually snow or ice), which produces so-called advection fog. The various types of fog are listed in table 2.5. The primary danger associated with fog is visibility reduction. Major destructive and often fatal highway pileups are often blamed on thick, rapidly developing fog. Aviation accidents also are commonly blamed on this hazard.

The total number of people with the disease is not a factor of epidemics; thus, for certain very rare diseases, a small number of people can constitute an epidemic, in which case it is often called an outbreak. (See figure 2.30.) Epidemics are often defined by their geographical range, which can include a community, a country, or even the entire globe (called a pandemic). Pathogens can normally be present without causing an epidemic, but a change in certain conditions (such as climatic variance or mutations) may make their spread more effective and/or their treatment more difficult. Epidemics can arise quickly or gradually, and can be halted quickly or persist for decades. The AIDS pandemic, for instance, which is controllable (but not yet curable) with proper medication, public education, and policy, persists a full 30 years after its discovery. The SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic, however, which struck twice in two consecutive years, was quickly controlled through the action of a coordinated international public health effort. Fears persist about the possible spread of avian influenza (H5N1) and other virulent influenza strains, because any mutation that results in more effective human-to-human transmission poses quite possibly the greatest threat to the human population. The World Health Organization has postulated scenarios where hundreds of millions of people succumb to the illness before it is brought under control, as based on increasing population densities, the ease of global travel, and limits of the public health and medical systems. The most recent pandemic influenza threat, which is the H1N1 strain (also referred to as swine flu), continues to be incredibly effective at passing through the human population, but has proven to be less deadly than even the regular \"annual\" flu. A coronavirus related to the SARS virus that causes MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), which is believe to be carried by camels and transmitted to humans, has infected hundreds of people in Saudi Arabia and, to a lesser degree, people in neighboring countries. The fatality rate is as high as 30 percent, but, at present, human-to-human transmission is not occurring, so the virus is considered controllable.",

The event also pushed for greater pandemic preparedness planning on a global scale, which has driven a change in the way many businesses and governments operate. The great importance placed on pandemic preparedness and control was illustrated in early 2014 when the Saudi Arabia Minister of Health was removed from office to send a message to the public that the government was taking the situation seriously.

Although emergency managers could ignore them because the possibility of their striking is so low, their consequences must be considered because they are so great. (See table 2.6.) In the history of the earth, about 120 extant large craters have resulted from large meteorites, including one whose diameter extends over 100 miles and is thought to be the cause of the extinction of the dinosaurs. Other large meteorites have exploded in the lower atmosphere before reaching ground, destroying everything below but causing no crater to form. The 1908 Tunguska meteorite flattened an entire forest more than 30 miles across. (See figure 2.32.) On February 15, 2013, a large meteorite exploded in an airburst over several cities in Russia. More than 3,600 buildings were damaged, mostly in the form of shattered glass and roof collapse. More than 1,200 people were injured, either from flying glass, falling roof material, or from looking at the blinding light of the explosion. The event received the name Chelyabinsk meteorite from the name of the first of the affected cities. This event was notable in that automobile dashboard cameras and security cameras provided a detailed account of the event for researchers (Barry and Kramer 2013) . Poisoning of large populations due to natural, nonpathogenic (e.g., Escherichia coli food poisoning) circumstances is rare, but it happens enough to merit mention as a potential catastrophic hazard. Disasters included in this category result from a poisonous material, such as a gas or a mineral, being introduced into the food supply, the water, or the air.

If reservoirs that populations depend on become contaminated and it is not quickly discovered, the contaminated water can quickly enter the public supply and cause a widespread public health disaster.

These systems of pipes, which contain highly pressurized and flammable gas, are vulnerable to a range of natural and man-made influences that could ultimately result in their failure. Breach of a gas line can result in fire, environmental pollution (often requiring evacuation of the area), injury, and death. Special expertise is required to respond to a break in a gas distribution line, and significant populations can be affected. The 1906 earthquake that struck San Francisco is an example of the risk posed by gas lines. In this event, ruptured gas lines started fires that quickly spread throughout the city during a time when response resources were strained. (See figure 2.38 .) The resulting fires greatly contributed to 700 deaths-the greatest single death toll of all earthquakes to strike the United States. Sabotage or vandalism of oil and gas distribution occurs in very poor countries where groups or individuals attempt to steal flowing gas by intentionally breaching the pipes. One such event that occurred along the Abule Egba pipeline in Lagos, Nigeria, on December 26, 2006, resulted in the deaths of hundreds (though exact numbers are not known; BBC 2006).

More than 80 percent of the world's mine fatalities occur in China, where mining activity is extensive. In 2004 alone, more than 6,000 miners died in China (Davis and Speigel 2005) , although unofficial statistics placed the annual average closer to 20,000 that year (BBC 2004) . Since that time, mining safety measures enacted by the government of China have reduced this annual death toll significantly, with only 1,049 miners reported killed in 2013 (Associated Press 2014). Mining accidents often receive significant media coverage, and subsequent public attention, due to the extraordinary nature of the rescue efforts that must take place to spare the lives of any accident survivors. A mine accident that occurred at the Quecreek Mine in Pennsylvania on July 24, 2002, trapped nine miners behind 50 to 60 million gallons of water. Their rescue was accomplished by a highly complex recovery operation in which a relief tunnel was made by boring through 250 feet of rock, allowing all nine to escape alive only four days later (Johnson, 2014) . In 2010, thirty-three Chilean miners became trapped 2,200 feet below the surface when the mine where they were working suffered a collapse. The ongoing rescue effort involved the drilling of a relief shaft wide enough to extract the miners-a task that required 69 days to perform. Food, water, oxygen, electricity, and communications equipment were supplied through tiny bore holes (CNN 2013). In May of 2014, after an explosion at a mine in Suma, Turkey, killed almost 300 miners, anger against what was considered government neglect of mine safety spurred violent protests (Brumfield et al. 2014 ",

Exposure to this risk, therefore, is extreme.

When large structures burn or collapse, however, the chance of a disaster occurring is great, no matter what country is involved.

Because of the graphic nature of the carnage resulting from explosives and the widespread fear historically associated with their use, these weapons are very effective as a terror-spreading device.",

            "text": "Probably the most significant factor that must be considered by any agency responding to a CHE is security. This includes security of relief workers as much as security of the affected population. Peacekeeping missions are often required to ensure the safety of IDPs and marginalized members of the population. Without the security offered by the peacekeepers, it is impossible for relief agencies to do their jobs, as the warring factions targeting the affected population will likely see relief agencies as hindering their cause and target them as well. Other times, relief workers merely get caught in the crossfire of battle. Either way, the results are tragic and occasionally result in aid workers retreating from the crisis. Exhibit 2.30 provides a list of select events where aid workers have been killed or injured during the response to CHEs. Figure 2 .42 illustrates the number of attacks on humanitarian aid workers from 2003 to 2013, and shows the impact of those attacks on the aid workers targeted. conclUSIon CONCLUSION There are many known hazards, whether natural, man-made, or intentional. It is likely that the list of man-made and intentional hazards will increase with technological innovation. Natural hazards are not likely to grow in number of categories, but their geographic range, strength of impacts, and number of events are all likely to increase as a result of the changing global climate. Most nations face only a select subset of the exhaustive list provided in this chapter, but constant re-evaluation is warranted in the face of increasing meteorological variability. Awareness of the hazards that affect a nation or region and a full understanding of the causes and consequences of that hazard \"portfolio\" are the first steps in the disaster reduction process known as disaster risk management.",

It is intended to maintain an established pause in conflict to allow UN and other peacemakers the time they need to negotiate a permanent dispute settlement or to assist in carrying out the terms of that negotiated settlement. There must be some degree of stability within the country or region in order for Chapter VI to be invoked. Chapter VI Peacekeeping is designed to support diplomatic endeavors to achieve or to maintain peace, and often involves the peacekeepers having to deal with and witness existing tension and violence without actually getting involved in any way as a participant. Peacekeeping forces require an invitation or, at the very least, full consent of all involved parties. Peacekeepers are required to remain impartial toward all of these parties. Chapter VI Peacekeeping forces may include unarmed observers, lightly armed units, police, and civilian technicians. Operations conducted by peacekeeping forces may include observing, recording, supervising, monitoring, occupying a buffer or neutral zone, and reporting on the implementation of the truce and any violations thereof. Typical peacekeeping missions include: \u2022 Observing and reporting any alleged violation of the peace agreement \u2022 Handling alleged cease-fire violations and/or alleged border incidents \u2022 Conducting regular liaison visits to units within their area of operation (AO) \u2022 Continuously checking forces within their AO and reporting any changes \u2022 Maintaining up-to-date information on the disposition of forces within their AO \u2022 Periodically visiting forward positions; reporting on the disposition of forces \u2022 Assisting civil authorities in supervision of elections, transfer of authority, partition of territory, and administration of civil functions",

Groups using terrorism as a means to carry out what they envision as a holy mission. This type of terrorism is especially dangerous because it is not constrained by national boundaries and often operates outside of normal civil systems. Examples include al Qaeda, Hamas, and Hezbollah. 3. State-sponsored terrorism. Groups, often working covertly, act as mercenaries. Their actions serve to inflict harm to enemy nations or to instigate conflict. Because of their government backing, these groups may be provided with steady and substantial funding. Examples of states that have been found to have sponsored terrorism include Iran, Libya, and Sudan. 4. Left-wing terrorism.

Civilians trying to flee war suffer much higher mortality and morbidity. Refugees who are able to escape to neighboring countries (see chapter 7) are usually placed into refugee camps in which conditions range from uncomfortable to squalid. While there, they are subject to outbreaks of communicable diseases, starvation, elevated stress, and violence. When the daily death rate reaches 1 per 10,000 people, refugee or IDP situations are classified as CHEs. This threshold is by no means absolute, and thus, depending on the circumstances, a situation may be called a CHE much earlier.The Crude Mortality Rate (CMR) is a population indicator that measures the number of deaths per 10,000 people per day. This metric is used because it helps to standardize the effect of the emergency in terms of numbers dying per day over specific population blocks. This enables events of different sizes to be compared in terms of the effect sustained by the individual. (Absolute numbers are often irrelevant if the compared countries' populations greatly differ, such as 1,000 deaths in Jamaica versus China.) Under normal circumstances, CMR rates in the developing world range from about 0.4 to 0.7 deaths per 10,000 people each day. During CHEs, these numbers can range from the baseline of one per day to 35 per day (as with Rwandan refugees in Zaire in 1994), and even higher. Mortality in CHEs is a factor of vulnerability to specific causes of death. In general, situations in which violence is the greatest cause of death show high mortality rates among grown men, while situations in which disease and famine are the greatest threat predominantly affect women, children, and the elderly. (See exhibit 2.31.)Under the provisions of the UN Charter, the United Nations is allowed to intervene in the event of a CHE. The role it takes on, as either a peacekeeper or a peace enforcer, depends on the decisions of the UN Security Council and the rules outlined in its Charter. These security operations may be active or simply observatory. Exhibit 2.32 provides more insight into the difference between UN Chapters VI and VII Peace Operations.",
