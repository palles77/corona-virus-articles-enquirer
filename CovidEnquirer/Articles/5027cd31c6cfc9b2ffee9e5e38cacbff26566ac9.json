A few small-scale human quercetin supplementation studies have produced conflicting results regarding quercetin's effects on upper respiratory tract infection rates, and little is known regarding the appropriate human dose. The purpose of this randomized, double-blinded, placebocontrolled trial was to measure the influence of two quercetin doses (500 and 1000 mg/day) compared to placebo on upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) rates in a large community group (N = 1002) of subjects varying widely in age (18-85 years). Subjects ingested supplements for 12 weeks and logged URTI symptoms on a daily basis using the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS). No significant group differences were measured for URTI outcomes for all subjects combined, or when analyzing separately by gender, body mass index, and age categories. Regression analysis revealed that the strongest interaction effect with group status was self-reported fitness level. A separate analysis of subjects 40 years of age and older rating themselves in the top half of the entire group for fitness level (N = 325) showed lower URTI severity (36% reduction, P = 0.020) and URTI total sick days (31% reduction, P = 0.048) for the Q-1000 group compared to placebo. In summary, for all subjects combined, quercetin supplementation over 12 weeks had no significant influence on URTI rates or symptomatology compared to placebo. A reduction in URTI total sick days and severity was noted in middle aged and older subjects ingesting 1000 mg quercetin/day for 12 weeks who rated themselves as physically fit.",

            "text": "Given the in vitro anti-pathogenic and immunomodulatory effects of quercetin, a series of studies have been conducted to determine whether quercetin supplementation offsets exerciseinduced immune perturbations and URTI risk. One such study investigated the effects of quercetin on infection rates in mice using a viral-challenge study design. The data from this study indicated that 12.5 mg/kg quercetin feedings for 7 days prior to inoculation with an LD50 dose of A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) influenza virus offset the exercise-induced increase in morbidity, symptom severity, and mortality [11] . However, this study did not examine measures of immune function, so it was unclear whether this effect was due to direct anti-viral activities or to augmentation of immune function by quercetin. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study with 40 cyclists, in which immune function was analyzed in parallel with incidence and severity of URTI, was conducted by our research team [12] . The results of this trial showed that supplementation with 1000 mg/day quercetin for 3 weeks significantly increased plasma quercetin levels and reduced self-reported incidence of URTI during the 2-week period following 3 days of exhaustive exercise. Immune dysfunction, inflammation, and oxidative stress, however, were not affected by quercetin, suggesting that quercetin may have exerted these effects via direct anti-viral activities, at least within the context of the study design.",

A large number of subjects were recruited to allow investigation of quercetin's potential influence on URTI rates in various subgroups differing in gender, age, body mass index, physical fitness, and recent exposure to stressful events. Because the in vitro anti-viral properties of quercetin have been shown to be potentiated by ascorbate [17] , and because unpublished data from Quercegen Pharma indicates that absorption of quercetin is enhanced by addition of vitamin C and niacin, the supplementation formula used in this study was a combination of quercetin (500 or 1000 mg/day), vitamin C (500 or 1000 mg/day), and niacin (20 or 40 mg/day).",

In the present study, however, a significant reduction in URTI duration and severity associated with quercetin supplementation was experienced only in subjects over 40 who rated themselves as physically fit. This was a surprising finding, because these older and fitter subjects were already at low risk for URTI [14, 15] .

Also, subjects rating themselves at high physical fitness levels in the current study not only exercised more frequently, but also ate more servings of fruit per day and had reduced BMI levels compared to subjects in the lower fitness tertiles; thus, the physical fitness rating has broader implications with regard to overall habits. Quercetin supplementation added to the beneficial influence of age and physical fitness level on reduced URTI symptomatology, and this synergism deserves further exploration.",

            "text": "Quercetin has been shown to exert strong anti-pathogenic effects against several causal agents of URTI in culture studies [8, 9] . However, in the present study, quercetin supplementation had no global effect on total number of URTI sick days or symptomatology. This finding may be explained by the potential reduction in quercetin's anti-viral activities due to metabolic biotransformation following ingestion. Quercetin is present in fruits and vegetables as water-soluble quercetin glycosides. Chen et al. [9] demonstrated that one such glycoside, quercetin-3-\u2424-galactoside, inhibits a protease essential for viral replication of SARS-CoV when studied in vitro. When quercetin glycosides are consumed, however, the sugar moiety is cleaved off in the small intestine, releasing the lipidsoluble aglycone form of quercetin [23] . Chiang et al. [8] used aglycone quercetin in their culture studies and found that it also exhibited strong anti-viral effects, inhibiting early viral replication of adenoviruses-3, 8, and 11 in a dose-responsive manner. However, aglycone quercetin is either methylated, sulphated, or glucuronidated during phase II metabolism in the liver, and it is in these conjugate forms that quercetin is predominately found in the blood compartment [23] . One study found that 3-methylquercetin exhibited strong anti-viral activity against polio virus [17] , but further work is needed to examine whether quercetin exerts antipathogenic activities in its other conjugate forms. Thus, although in vitro studies have pointed to the potential value of quercetin as an anti-viral agent, the affectivity of quercetin conjugates requires further study. Quercetin's in vivo role in augmenting immune function also appears limited, as we have reported in previous studies [12, 24] .",

These findings are consistent with published studies linking URTI risk to age, gender, and exposure to stressful life events [13, 14] but are counter to some studies linking URTI risk to obesity [16] . Several randomized trials and epidemiological studies have compared URTI incidence in groups across the continuum of self-selected physical activity and fitness levels, and in agreement with our data, reported 25-50% reductions among the most active and physically fit groups [25] [26] [27] . Limited data support a moderate reduction in URTI risk with higher fruit intake especially when combined with vegetables [28] .",

Contrary to our hypothesis, the strongest quercetin-URTI related effects were seen in a relatively low-risk group: older subjects who rated themselves as physically fit. Subjects in this group ingesting 1000 mg/day quercetin experienced a one-third reduction in total number of URTI sick days and URTI severity compared to placebo. Future work is needed to elucidate the potential connection between quercetin affectivity and exercise status.",
