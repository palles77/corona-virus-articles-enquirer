Using this method, immunoglobulin G (IgG)-producing immortalized B cell lines were generated from peripheral blood IgG \u00fe CD22 \u00fe B cells with an efficiency of up to 83%. Antibody can already be obtained from the culture supernatant after 3e4 weeks. Moreover, clonality analysis demonstrated monoclonality in 87% of the resulting immortalized B cell lines. Given the high immortalization efficiency and monoclonality rate, evidence is provided that no further subcloning is necessary. An important application of this B cell immortalization method is the characterization of (autoreactive) antibodies from patients with autoimmune disease. This could eventually lead to the identification of new autoantigens, disease markers or targets for therapy.",

EBV infects B cells via their CD21 receptor [1] and subsequently transforms them into continually dividing, lymphoblastoid cell lines that produce antibodies representing the humoral immune response in vivo. Antibodies can be generated against an infectious agent or tumour cells, rendering the resulting antibodies attractive for therapy. In addition, B cell immortalization can be a valuable tool for the production and characterization of autoreactive antibodies from patients with autoimmune diseases. This can provide more insight into the underlying mechanisms of humoral immune responses in autoimmunity and can lead to the identification of new autoantigens, disease markers or targets for therapy [2e4] . The major advantage of B cell immortalization, when compared to other antibodyproducing techniques [5e10], is the generation of fully human antibodies that truly reflect both the specificity and diversity of the human immune response, generated from the human B cell repertoire, without the need for specific immunization.",

The resulting immortalized B cell lines were mainly unstable immunoglobulin M (IgM) producing clones with low affinity. Various adjustments to the procedure have been tried since then, but immortalization and B cell growth rate remained inefficient. More recently, antibodies neutralizing SARS coronavirus and cytomegalovirus (CMV) were produced successfully by the introduction of the polyclonal B cell activator CpG2006 in the B cell immortalization process or by B cell activation prior to EBV infection, respectively [13, 14] . In our hands, these methods resulted in a low reproducibility. The current study was aimed at developing a B cell immortalization procedure with a high efficiency and reproducibility when seeding low B cell numbers per well, that could easily be adopted for the production of (autoreactive) antibodies from patients with autoimmune disease. Such a method can be especially advantageous when autoreactive B cells are not easily available, for example in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients or the synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Moreover, seeding low B cell numbers per well limits the bias towards the preferential outgrowth of fast growing immortalized B cells.",

Genomic DNA was isolated from immortalized antibody-producing and growth-positive B cells present in single wells. The variable region of the B cell receptor heavy chain (HC) locus was amplified from 100 ng DNA using the IdentiClone\u00d4 IGH Gene Clonality Assay (Invivoscribe Technologies) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. This standardized assay was extensively validated using Revised European/American Lymphoma (REAL) Classification [15] . Primers that target the conserved framework regions (FR) were used in combination with a FAMlabelled consensus primer targeting the conserved joining region (J) in order to amplify the variable region in which genetic rearrangements occur during B cell development. The B cell receptor genes are highly polymorphic and subject to diversity and mutations. To maximize identification of the clonal rearrangements, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed for each FR using VH familyspecific forward primers ( Table 1) . Analysis of the resulting fragments was accomplished using automatic capillary electrophoresis (ABI3730, Applied Biosystems). Polyclonal populations resulted in a Gaussian distribution of amplification products with different lengths, while a monoclonal population yielded a single amplification product. This spectratyping procedure can detect clonal populations with a sensitivity of 0.5e5%.",

No IgM \u00fe immortalized B cell lines were recovered after FACS sorting, although several IgM \u00fe wells could be found after magnetic selection. Consequently, IgG \u00fe CD22 \u00fe FACS sorting was proven to be the best choice for IgG \u00fe B cell isolation prior to B cell immortalization. This enrichment of IgG \u00fe B cells before immortalization was performed to select for IgG-producing immortalized B cell lines. Autoantibodies of the IgG isotype are mostly implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. For example, oligoclonal IgG bands (OCB) have been described in the CSF of patients with MS and are used as a diagnostic indicator [16, 17] . In several autoimmune diseases, including myasthenia gravis (MG) [18, 19] , systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and RA [20] , IgG responses against autoantigenic targets are present. Therefore, it is interesting to focus on IgG responses when examining humoral immunity in autoimmune diseases.",

            "text": "Variations in culture conditions were tested together with the immortalization experiments in donors 1 and 2 (Fig. 2b) . A mean Table 1 Sequences of VH and J gene-specific primers. immortalization efficiency of 55% was hereby obtained for the improved method, as indicated by the mean percentage of IgG-and growth-positive wells (Fig. 2b) . Variation in CpG2006 and IL-2 concentration revealed that the most efficient B cell stimulation and immortalization could be obtained with 1 mg/ml CpG2006, without the addition of IL-2 during EBV infection (data not shown). CpG2006 was used for B cell stimulation during immortalization as it was previously shown that this ligand of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) [21] increases immortalization efficiency when administered during EBV infection [13] and causes polyclonal B cell activation and proliferation [22e24] . Some studies revealed that CpG2006 suppresses viral infection as it protects against several viruses [25, 26] and induces the production of anti-viral cytokines and other proteins [27, 28] . Concerning EBV, CpG2006 has only been shown to suppress the initiation of lytic EBV infection via inhibition of lytic gene expression [28] . Such connection, however, has never been demonstrated for latent EBV infection during B cell immortalization in vitro. Moreover, we have shown a positive effect of CpG2006 on B cell activation and a higher immortalization efficiency when CpG2006 is administered to cells when immortalization is in progress (data not shown). In contrast to the increase that has been described in CpG2006 elicited B cell activation [29] or immortalization [30] by IL-2, we could not detect an amplification of B cell immortalization when IL-2 was administered during the B cell immortalization phase (data not shown). Since the IL-2 receptor is mainly present on activated B cells [31] , it is likely that IL-2 exerts a stimulating effect on B cell proliferation and growth rather than on B cell activation. This is also reflected in the higher immortalization efficiency when CpG2006 and IL-2 are combined for restimulation in comparison with the addition of CpG2006 or IL-2 alone (Fig. 2a) , although the difference was not statistically significant. Addition of CpG2006 increases the effect of IL-2 given that TLR9 expression is elevated after EBV infection and CpG2006 stimulation [32] , rendering the immortalized cells even more responsive to CpG2006. B cell spectratyping provides further insights into the clonality of the resulting immortalized B cells, which can be useful to evaluate the need for cloning of the B cell lines. A monoclonality rate of 87% was demonstrated, while the remaining 13% of the investigated B cell lines appeared to be biclonal (Fig. 2c) . This preferential generation of monoclonal immortalized B cell lines can be explained by the immortalization process itself. EBV-infected B cells undergo a proliferative crisis in which most of the cells die because of apoptosis. Surviving B cells become activated and eventually transform into lymphoblastoid immortalized cell lines [33] . Consequently, the outgrowth of multiple immortalized B cell lines is rare when starting with low B cell numbers per well. Nevertheless, the high monoclonality rate provides a major advantage for our B cell immortalization method in combination with the high immortalization efficiency. Subcloning using limiting dilution is no longer necessary, which considerably reduces the time span in which monoclonal antibodies can be produced.",

The same donors were used as in previous experiments with isolated IgG \u00fe CD22 \u00fe B cells. However, the largest proportion of the resulting B cell lines (72%) appeared to be IgM \u00fe . Only 23% of the immortalized B cell lines were IgG \u00fe (Fig. 2b) . This larger proportion of IgM-producing immortalized cells was reasonable, as most B cells in the peripheral blood belong to the na\u00efve B cell population [34] . Na\u00efve B cells also express the EBV receptor CD21 (unpublished results) and can be activated by CpG2006 to produce large amounts of IgM [23] . Moreover, the percentages of IgM \u00fe and IgG \u00fe immortalized B cell lines that were produced from total PBMC, namely 72% and 23%, resemble the proportion of na\u00efve and memory B cells present in the peripheral blood [35] . No significant difference could be observed when CpG2006, IL-2 or both were used during restimulation after B cell immortalization, although a trend towards a higher percentage of IgG \u00fe immortalized B cells was observed when both stimuli were added to the culture (23%) compared to a single stimulus (18%) (Fig. 2b) . When immortalizing total PBMC, 250 ng/ml cyclosporine A has to be added to suppress growth of (cytotoxic) T cells that would otherwise target EBVinfected B cells, causing immortalization failure. B cell spectratyping of the generated immortalized B cell lines resulted in 70% monoclonal B cell lines and 30% biclonal B cell lines (Fig. 2c) . This again emphasizes a high monoclonality rate when seeding low B cell numbers per well.",
