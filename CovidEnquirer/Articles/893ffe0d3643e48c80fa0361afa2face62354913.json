The Chinese first had isolated an avian influenza A (HSN) virus, however this 'bird flu', possibly from poultry, was soon ruled out. Then human metapneumoviruses (hMPV) was noticed but could not be verified in other laboratories. Simultaneously Chinese scientists found a chlamydia-like organism taken from patients during what later came to be known as the Guangdong outbreak, where death came within hours. But again this could not be confirmed in most laboratories outside of China. Finally, on April 16, 2003, a novel coronavirus, never before seen in human or animals was proclaimed by WHO officials to cause SARS. Up to this point human strains of coronavirus were only associated with mild disease and never known to kill so precipitously. Also, a much larger problem was that in some studies (3) coronavirus was present only in about half of the SARS cases, while in others only 40%, and began to look more like just another passenger virus than anything else. Besides this, antivirals such as ribavirin and oseltamivir (Tamiflu) were not working on SARS culture plates, nor were they very successful clinically either.",

Positive cell culture results show the presence of live virus which in the case of coronavirus were then used to infect monkeys at Erasmus University in Rotterdam, which came down with symptoms similar to SARS. Several problems in methodology and thought immediately surfaced. First, how did one know that this member of the coronavirus family, never seen before in humans, was actually a virus. There are many viral forms of bacteria, especially the mycobacteria, which simulate and look like viruses in every way and are also found in respiratory secretions, blood and stool (17) . Secondly, even if it was indeed a virus, how could one testify to the purity of the monkey inoculate (bacteria also grow in Vero Cell cultures). Last, if corona virus was indeed the cause of SARS why was it not found in all SARS patients.",

Atypical radiologic manifestations of TB, encountered in as many as one third of cases include such lower infiltrates. And lower lobe predominance is seen even more commonly in nontuberculous mycobacterial infection. In advanced SARS cases, perihi-lar enlargement, was noted, a hallmark of TB. In addition, the majority of the lesions contained an area of groundglass opacification with or without consolidation. Ground-glass findings are a predominant finding in high resolution CT (HRCT) of miliary tuberculosis and of 25 TB patients, Hong observed 23 with areas of ground-glass opacities, a sign of active infection (6).",

By Laissey's criteria, the bulk of Wong's findings seem like HRCT findings of a nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTMB) pulmonary infection (7), although there is considerable overlap between TB and the other mycobacteria in Laissey's study. Yet Wong's differential list of possible SARS causes does not for some reason mention mycobacterial disease, choosing instead: 'other causes of atypical pneumonia. ' Mangura et al. (8) reiterates that tuberculosis can easily simulate 'atypical pneumonia', and Steponaviciene (9) reminds that clinical symptoms of TB pneumonia are most similar to the atypical pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae.",
