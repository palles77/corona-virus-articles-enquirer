            "text": "For many years it was difficult to persuade pig farmers and their veterinarians that pig herds could become infected by windborne spread. This was in spite of the high breakdown rate of minimal disease herds with enzootic pneumonia many of which could not be explained in any other way (Goodwin, 1985) . The sequence of events that gradually began to change their view was the epidemic of foot-andmouth disease (FMD) in England in 1967-68, followed by the research carried out at the Animal Virus Research Laboratory at Pirbright, culminating in the astonishing spread of FMD from Brittany in France to southern England in 1981.",

Following that epidemic, intensive research was carried out on the factors influencing the airborne excretion, transmission and survival of FMD virus under experimental conditions. Pigs were found to be the biggest shedders, one pig being capable of excreting 400 million infectious units per day. Airborne spread is usually from pigs at source to cattle downwind Donaldson, 1993, pers. comm.). The most critical factor influencing airborne survival is relative humidity; high humidity favouring virus survival, low humidity causing inactivation. Spread of virus is most likely when the wind is constant with a low to moderate speed and less likely in gusty conditions. A flat terrain or an expanse of water favours long distance spread. A computerized prediction model was derived through the unusual collaboration of veterinary virologists and meteorologists (Gloster et al., 1981 . These workers retrospectively examined the spread of FMD in previous outbreaks and found that when the climatic conditions had been conducive it had taken a predictable course following the direction of the wind. Over water itappeared to have travelled long distances. Over land it had not travelled so far. Sellers and Gloster (1980) presented evidence that the virus had been carried 20 km in an outbreak in Northumbria in 1966.",

In 1984 it was noticed by Pensaert et al. (1986) that on routine serological testing there was an unexpected rise in antibody titres to TGE in pigs in Belgium which was not correlated with diarrhoea. A similar phenomenon was noted in France, the Netherlands and Denmark (van Nieuwstadt & Pol, 1989) and later in the UK (Brown & Cartwright, 1986) . The virus was shown to multiply in the lungs but not in the intestines. It was estimated that about 80 per cent of the herds in the UK became seropositive in a very short time. Only herds in remote locations of very low pig density escaped.",

The work of Gloster, Donaldson & Hough (1984) indicated that the virus had been carried on wind up to 9 km in the UK. The Danes have evidence that it travels further than this over land and further still over water. Aujeszky's disease was eradicated from Denmark at about the same time as it was eradicated from the UK but from 1985 an increasing number of outbreaks occurred in the southeast of Jutland and on neighbouring islands including the southern region of the island of Funen. Field observations pointed to windborne contamination from north-west Germany (Schleswig-Holstein) where the disease was actively spreading (Christensen & Soerensen, 1988; Andersen et al., 1989; Christensen et aL, 1989; Christensen et al., 1990a, b) . During the winter and spring of 1989-90 50 herds in Denmark within 35 km of the German border and on Danish islands off the coast of Germany broke down with Aujeszky's disease. The first outbreak on such an island, the island of Als, was 15 km from the German coast. The disease then broke out on the island of Fyn, 40 km from Als. In the winters of 1986-87 and 1987-88 there were outbreaks on the island of Funen which suggested even further windborne transmission over water and land, possibly up to 80 km. Using restriction fragment analysis, the Danes showed that the viruses in these outbreaks resembled German strains and not the strains that existed in Denmark prior to eradication. Epidemiological studies revealed no physical connections between these outbreaks and herds in Germany. In 1990, the Danes paid the Germans to set up a blanket vaccination zone in Germany along the Danish border. Vaccination still continues in this zone. Since 1990 there have been only two outbreaks in Denmark, in March and May 1991 (Mortensen, 1993, pers. comm.) .",

The syndrome was first observed in the USA in 1987 (Dial & Parsons, 1989 ) and although it spread rapidly through the pig-rearing areas of North America attempts to identify the causal agent failed. It was first recognized in Europe in Munster, Germany, in November 1990 (Leyk, 1991 and spread rapidly to the neighbouring Netherlands. The pig population of the Netherlands and the nearby regions of Germany and Belgium are ideal for aerosol spread. The herds are close together and in direct sight of one another, the pig population is high, the terrain is flat and the climate in winter is often damp, cool and overcast. By April 1991 it was estimated that 3000 premises had been affected in Germany, 1400 in the Netherlands, and 30 in Belgium (Done et al., 1992) .",

A new strain of influenza virus, designated 195852, which was first detected in the UK in January 1992 and which caused a similar syndrome to PRRS in some herds, also spread rapidly and seemed to overtake PRRS during the winter. This strain also infects people which complicates the epidemiology. There is no clear evidence that it spreads on wind and some workers dispute that it does, but pig farmers and veterinarians are now so convinced of windborne spread that it would be difficult to persuade them that it does not.",
