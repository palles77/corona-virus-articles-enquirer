Detailed clinical assessment of the nervous system of the pig is quite diffi cult.

Nonetheless, a detailed clinical examination and assessment of the nervous system will usually allow lesions to be localized and a diagnosis made.",

            "text": "A wide range of causes are involved and must be considered when investigating neurological signs in pigs. A number of infectious diseases, especially those caused by viruses and bacteria, produce neurological signs. Some virus infections, such as the Teschen's disease enterovirus, cause signs chiefl y involving the nervous system. The pestivirus that causes classical swine fever affects many body systems, including the central nervous system (CNS). Various serotypes of Streptococcus suis are frequently associated with neurological signs in infected pigs. Such signs are also caused in some cases by Haemophilus parasuis. Infection by this, the causal organism of Glasser's disease, produces a polyserositis affecting a number of body systems including the CNS. In some cases, bacteria produce toxins that directly (e.g. the neurotoxin in tetanus) or indirectly (e.g. the verotoxin in bowel oedema) affect the nervous system. Severe hypoglycaemia in neonatal piglets may cause fi tting in the terminal stages. Signs of fi tting are also caused by sudden water deprivation in older pigs. Liver disease in pigs is relatively uncommon, but in severe cases CNS signs may be caused by hepatic encephalopathy. Access to poisonous substances such as arsenic or selenium will cause neurological signs. Deficiencies of vital dietary ingredients such as pantothenic acid may also cause neurological signs.",

Infectious agents are usually brought into a pig unit by infected pigs and possibly by vehicles or people who have contact with an infected herd. In a recent UK outbreak of classical swine fever, the source of pestivirus was believed to be a meat sandwich discarded by an overseas lorry driver. Tetanus is more common in pigs living in outdoor units, where the risk of contact with soil containing the spores of Clostridium tetani is much greater than in indoor units. The incidence of tetanus was greater when pigs were routinely castrated, producing open wounds through which infection could enter the body.",
