The irradiation chamber was operated 208 with aerosolized virus particles flowing through the chamber and the bypass channel for 15 minutes 209 prior to sampling, in order to establish the desired RH value of ~55%. Sample collection initiated by 210 changing air flow from the bypass channel to the BioSampler using the set of three way valves. The 211 BioSampler was initially filled with 20 ml of HBSS ++ to capture the aerosol. During each sampling time, 212 which lasted for 30 minutes, the inside of the irradiation chamber was exposed to 222 nm far-UVC light 213 through the UVC semi-transparent plastic window. Variation of the far-UVC dose delivered to aerosol 214 particles was achieved by inserting additional UVC semi-transparent plastic films, identical to the 215 material used as the chamber window, between the lamps and the chamber window. The extra plastic 216 films uniformly reduced the power entering the chamber. The three test doses of 0.8, 1.3 and 2.0 217 mJ/cm 2 , were achieved by adding two, one, or no additional plastic films, respectively. Zero-dose 218 control studies were conducted with the excimer lamps turned off. Experiments at each dose were 219 repeated in triplicate. After the sampling period was completed the solution from the BioSampler was 220 used for the virus infectivity assay. 221 Virus infectivity assay. We measured viral infectivity with a focus forming assay that employs 222 standard fluorescent immunostaining techniques to detect infected host cells and infectious virus 223 particles 39 . Briefly, after running through the irradiation chamber for 30 minutes, 0.5 ml of virus 224 suspension collected from the BioSampler was overlaid on a monolayer of Madin-Darby Canine Kidney 225 (MDCK) epithelial cells routinely grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 226 2 mM L-alanyl-L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich Corp.

Infected cells were then fixed in 100% ice cold methanol at 4\u00b0C for 229 5 minutes and labeled with influenza A virus nucleoprotein antibody [C43] (Abcam ab128193, 230 Cambridge, MA) 1:200 in HBSS ++ containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich Corp.231 St. Louis, MO, USA) at room temperature for 30 minutes with gentle shaking. Cells were washed three 232 times in HBSS ++ and labeled with goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor-488 (Life Technologies, Grand Island, 233 NY) 1:800 in HBSS ++ containing 1% BSA at room temperature for 30 minutes with gentle shaking. 234 Following three washes in HBSS ++ , the cells were stained with Vectashield containing DAPI (4',6-235 diamidino-2-phenylindole) (Victor Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and observed with the 10x and 40x 236 objectives of an Olympus IX70 fluorescent microscope equipped with a Photometrics PVCAM high-237 resolution, high-efficiency digital camera. For each sample, at least three fields of view of merged DAPI 238 and Alexa-488 images were acquired. Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD) 239 was used to analyze the 10x images to measure the FFUUV as the ratio of cells infected with the virus 240 divided by the total number of cells. 241 Data analysis. The surviving fraction (S) of the virus was calculated by dividing the fraction of cells 242 that yielded positive virus growth at each UV dose (FFUUV) by the fraction at zero dose (FFUcontrols): 243 S=FFUUV/FFUcontrols. Survival values were calculated for each repeat experiment and natural log (ln) 244 transformed to bring the error distribution closer to normal 40 . Linear regression was performed using 245 these normalized ln[S] values as the dependent variable and UV dose (D, mJ/cm 2 ) as the independent 246variable. Using this approach, the virus survival (S) was fitted to first-order kinetics according to the",
