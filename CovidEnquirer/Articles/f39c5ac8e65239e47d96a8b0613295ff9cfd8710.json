The emergency department (ED) is an essential component of the health care system and subject to workflow challenges, which may hinder ED personnel adherence to guideline-based infection prevention practices. Methods: The purpose of this review was to examine published literature regarding adherence rates among ED personnel to selected infection control practices, including hand hygiene (HH) and aseptic technique during the placement of central venous catheters and urinary catheters. We also reviewed studies reporting rates of ED equipment contamination. PubMed was searched for studies that included adherence rates among ED personnel to HH during routine patient care, aseptic technique during the placement of central venous catheters and urinary catheters, and rates of equipment contamination. Results: In total, 853 studies was screened, and 589 abstracts were reviewed. The full texts of 36 papers were examined, and 23 articles were identified as meeting inclusion criteria. Eight studies used various scales to measure HH compliance, which ranged from 7.7% to 89.7%. Seven articles examined central venous catheters inserted in the ED or by emergency medicine residents. Detail of aseptic technique practices during urinary catheterization was lacking. Four papers described equipment contamination in the ED. Conclusion: Standardized methods and definitions of compliance monitoring are needed to compare results across settings.",

            "text": "Health care-associated infections (HAIs) are a significant public health concern. Despite being largely preventable, these infections are a significant contributor to patient mortality and morbidity and are expensive to health care systems. 1, 2 It is estimated that up to 70% of some types of HAIs are preventable through improved infection control practices among health care providers. 3 Whereas a large proportion of preventable HAIs can be attributed to invasive procedures and devices such as urinary and central venous catheters, 1 cross contamination may also occur through person-toperson spread after handling of contaminated equipment or other fomites. 4 The emergency department (ED) is an essential component of the health care system, and its potential impact continues to grow as more individuals seek care and are admitted to the hospital through the ED. 5 Invasive procedures such as central lines are placed with increased frequency in certain EDs, but adherence to best practices (eg maximum barrier precautions) varies. 6, 7 ED clinicians also face numerous workflow challenges that may foster the spread of infections including crowding, 8 frequent interruptions to care delivery, 9 use of nontraditional care areas such as hallways and conference rooms, 10 and close proximity of patients, who are often separated only by curtains. 11 Given that many of these barriers have been identified as infection prevention threats, 12, 13 it is critical to understand the infection prevention practices of ED providers and their potential role in the risk of HAIs.",

We selected these procedures because they are more likely to increase the risk of infection when compared with less invasive procedures such as peripheral intravenous catheter insertion. Articles were excluded if they concerned the contamination of cultures; described self-reported compliance; did not separate ED data from other areas under study; were review articles; and were commentaries, editorials, or discussions of the issue (ie, not data based).

A multimodal intervention was then implemented to improve HH in the previously studied ED, and the same team and observers again assessed adherence to HH prior to patient contact. 19, 21 HH rates improved among nurses (40.7%, 107/263) and physicians (50.5%, 101/200), for an overall rate of 44.9%, which represented a 30.6% improvement in practice.

In one large ED from a United States tertiary care hospital, 7% (5/69) of environmental surfaces (chairs, keyboards, telephones, and others) were positive for MRSA compared with no positive sites (0/63) in an outpatient clinic. 34 Another research team 35 took 63 samples of computer mice in an ED in Northern Ireland over a 1-year period and found only normal skin flora, with no MRSA. In a United States ED, Frazee et al 36 took surveillance cultures of ultrasonographic probes used in the ED; approximately two thirds (111/164) were contaminated with skin or environmental flora, 8 samples had heavy growth of skin or environmental flora, and 3.7% (6/164) grew organisms including methicillin-sensitive S aureus, Aspergillus, Acinetobacter spp, and mixed gram-negative rods.

            "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first literature review detailing adherence rates with common infection prevention practices in the ED setting. In this small but growing body of literature, there are several lessons to be learned and gaps to be filled. Whereas there were a number of papers that reported HH practices, there was a wide range in reported rates, from 7.7% to 89.7%. Unfortunately, it is not possible to draw conclusions from the data because the methods of observation varied widely. In one study, the definition of a HH indication was prior to patient contact; in another, prior to a \"dirty contact\"; and other studies adopted or adapted the WHO \"Five Moments of HH.\" 16 Because the WHO observational methods were first published in 2007 and are becoming the state of the art for HH observation, it is likely that future studies using direct observation to assess HH practices will be more standardized, making it possible for the first time to compare across sites. Even more promising are newer methods of electronic monitoring of HH, which avoid the problem of the \"Hawthorne effect\" and observer bias, are nonintrusive, and are much more likely to provide a realtime accurate picture of HH practices. 38 We were unable to find detailed information regarding aseptic practices during urinary catheterization, probably not surprising because of the private nature of the procedure. Despite this, data show that the ED is a common source of urinary catheterization and that guidelines for when a catheter is indicated are often not followed. Guidelines to prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infections have been consistently published for decades. 39 Nevertheless, in a survey of 415 US intensive care units, Conway et al 40 found that only a small proportion actually had policies consistent with these guidelines and concluded that little attention is currently being paid to the prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infections.",

Intervention studies included in our review consisted of guidelines and education, which targeted physicians, nurses, and/or residents. Whereas these interventions generally resulted in an overall reduction of urinary catheter utilization, they had little impact on urinary catheter appropriateness. Studies in other acute care settings found that interventions that have successfully improved adherence to catheter guidelines include reviews and reminders and empowering nurses to determine when catheters are indicated or should be removed. [41] [42] [43] Although this review was not designed to examine infectious outcomes related to ED catheters, we did find several studies that linked ED-placed central venous catheters to subsequent infection. Many of these studies are detailed in a recent systematic review, where authors conclude that ED-placed central venous catheters are a source of infection. 7 Notably, few studies included in this review detailed compliance with infection prevention protocols during ED central line insertion. Future research should examine the adoption of best practices aimed to prevent infection in the ED. Similarly, whereas several studies examined environmental or equipment contamination in the ED, future studies should focus on critical items likely to come in direct contact with patients. Such was the case in the study reporting contamination of ultrasonographic probes ready for patient use, 36 but studies of computer keyboards or other less critical items generally yield predictable results that add little new information.",

Nevertheless, several recommendations can be made. First, if infection prevention practices are to be observed or monitored, standardized methods and definitions are essential so that results can be compared across settings. Second, more efforts are needed to reduce unnecessary urinary catheterization in the ED (as well as in other clinical settings), and interventions to improve adherence to guidelines may include staff review and reminders regarding practice.
