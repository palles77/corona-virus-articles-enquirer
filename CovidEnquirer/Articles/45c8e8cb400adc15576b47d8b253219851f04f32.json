Necropsy examination revealed multifocal pulmonary consolidation and necrosis and fibrinohaemorrhagic enteritis. Microscopically, there was necrotic and purulent bronchopneumonia, myocarditis and non-purulent encephalitis. In the jejunum and ileum there was villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia with oocyst-like and schizont-like structures in the epithelia. Immunohistochemically, Neospora caninum antigen was detected in association with the intestinal protozoal structures, degenerative neurons and areas of necrosis in the lungs and heart. Polymerase chain reaction confirmed that the organism was N. caninum and not Toxoplasma gondii. The seroprevalence for N. caninum was 74.2% (49/66 animals) for the cattle and 57.1% (4/7 animals) for dogs on this farm. This report documents fatal systemic neosporosis and enteroepithelial stages of N. caninum in a naturally infected puppy. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first definition of intestinal neosporosis in a naturally infected dog as well as the first evidence of fatal canine neosporosis in Turkey.",

            "text": "Neospora caninum infection was first reported in dogs with skin lesions and systemic pathology in 1988 (McAllister et al., 1998) . Canine neosporosis must be distinguished from disease caused by morphologically similar protozoal agents such as Toxoplasma gondii and Hammondia hammondi (Lindsay and Dubey, 2000; Dubey, 2003; Dubey et al., 2006) . Dogs and coyotes are the only definitive hosts of N. caninum, shedding the oocysts following enteroepithelial schizogony and gametogony (McAllister et al., 1998; Lindsay et al., 1999) . Several reports describe the shedding of N. caninum oocysts in the faeces of naturally infected dogs (Lindsay and Dubey, 2000; Dubey, 2003; Gondim et al., 2005; Dubey and Schares, 2011) . Oocyst shedding is also reported in experimental studies; for example, puppies given calf brains and avian chorio-allantoic membranes containing N. caninum infective stages shed millions of oocysts for 2e3 days in their faeces (Cedillo et al., 2008; Munhoz et al., 2013) . Although it is likely that the enteroepithelial stages of N. caninum develop in the dog intestine, neither schizogony nor gametogony have yet been demonstrated in this tissue.",

It has also been shown that dogs given N. caninum tachyzoites and tissue cysts may shed millions of oocysts after 2e8 days. However, though it is highly likely that asexual and sexual developmental stages of neosporosis probably take place in the small intestines of dogs, to date there is no report confirming the presence of those stages (Hemphill et al., 2009 ). An attempt to demonstrate schizogony and gametogony of N. caninum in in-vitro cultured canine duodenal cells also failed (Hemphill et al., 2009) . In this duodenal cell culture model, Hemphill et al. (2009) inoculated N. caninum bradyzoites and tachyzoites onto the intestinal epithelium, but although the infective stages successfully entered the epithelial cells, particularly through the microvillus containing apical side, no stage conversion occurred during the 10 day incubation time. The authors concluded that this study should be repeated using an immortal duodenal cell line for prolonged times in order to observe stage conversion from tachyzoite to schizont.",

            "text": "T. gondii, which shows genetic and morphological resemblance to N. caninum, has been shown to have five different schizogony stages (AeE) in the cat intestine. Stages A, B and C are the initial proliferative stages (30e40 mm in size) and they have been considered as temporary stages, while D and E schizonts are smaller (8e12 mm) and are seen just before stage conversion to gametocytes (Dubey, 2010) . In the present case, schizogony stages observed in the ileal mucosa resembled type D and E schizonts of T. gondii. While schizonts were easily observed in the HE-stained slides, microgamonts were recognized only after IHC. However, macrogamonts of the parasite were not identified, even with PAS staining (Dubey, 2010) . Unfortunately, it was not possible to perform an ultrastructural examination in this case. In the intestinal mucosa of this puppy, intraepithelial schizonts showed strong immunoreactivity for N. caninum while the immunoreaction was relatively weak in microgametocytes and oocysts. This difference can be explained by the different structural proteins expressed by the different developmental stages of the parasite. The commercial N. caninum antibody may have different affinity for common antigens shared by tachyzoites, microgamonts and schizonts. A previous report demonstrated that the intestinal developmental stages (e.g. schizont and gametocyte) of T. gondii may cross-react with tachyzoite-specific primary antibody in immunoperoxidase tests (Taka et al., 1999) . Otherwise, the lack of labelling of interstitial macrophages and the epithelial localization of the protozoon is consistent with these stages not being tachyzoites (Dubey, 2010) .",
