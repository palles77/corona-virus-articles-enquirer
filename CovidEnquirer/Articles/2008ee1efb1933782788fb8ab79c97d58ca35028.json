These challenges will vary depending on many factors, including the nature and purpose of the population itself. Indeed, veterinarians may be tasked with developing health care programs for cat populations in a wide spectrum of settings-from facilities housing laboratory animals, to animal shelters, home-based rescue and foster providers, care-for-life cat sanctuaries, breeding catteries, or large multicat households. Regardless of the setting, a systematic approach to the health of the clowder is crucial for success.",

For example, a cat may be in proper physical condition and free from infectious or other physical disease, yet suffering from severe stress and anxiety. In this case, the patient cannot be assessed as healthy, because its behavioral (emotional) state is compromising its health and well-being. Thus physical health and behavioral health are both essential components of wellness, and preventive health care must actively address each of these.",

Even the best-designed facilities cannot favor good health in a multicat environment without thoughtful implementation of environmental wellness protocols. In small animal practice, environmental wellness is frequently not emphasized simply because many owners are accustomed to providing a reasonably healthy environment for their pets. In contrast, a structured program to address environmental wellness is essential in the More specific goals will vary depending upon the given population and its purpose. For example, in an animal shelter, specific goals of the wellness program might include decreasing the incidence and prevalence of infectious diseases in the shelter and following adoption, decreasing the incidence of problem behaviors in the shelter, decreasing the rate of return of cats to the shelter for problem behaviors, increasing the adoption rate, and so forth. In the context of a breeding colony, the goals might include increasing kitten birth weights, decreasing neonatal mortality, or improving socialization of kittens. By identifying and tracking measurable factors (often called performance targets in large animal medicine), it is possible to measure progress toward these goals. Once baseline data (such as disease rates) are established, it is possible to measure the impact of protocol changes on population health by evaluating these performance targets. Both medical records and a system for regular surveillance and reporting are required to accurately track and access trends in animal health. 41 ",

When individuals are ill, their health and well-being is always a priority; however, it should also immediately trigger the clinician to ask, \"Why is this individual sick? What is the cause of its illness, and how can I prevent this from affecting others?\" To optimize feline health, wellness programs must be carefully structured to address both the physical and behavioral health of the animals, which are intimately linked to their environment, making it crucial to systematically address environmental conditions as well.",

            "text": "The value of obtaining an accurate medical history on any cat entering a population is immeasurable, because it will often alert the clinician to the presence of potential problems. In a laboratory setting, obtaining cats from commercial purpose-bred colonies or institutional breeding colonies ensures that an accurate history will be available, maximizing the odds that only healthy cats will be added to the population. Likewise, private breeding catteries should always strive to obtain an accurate medical history on any cat that may be accepted into the cattery. The introduction of cats from random sources to closed populations of cats risks the health of the population and should be avoided whenever possible. 45 In contrast, by their very nature, animal shelters must frequently receive cats from multiple random sources, and it will not always be possible to obtain accurate histories. In some cases, cats are brought in by animal control officers or good Samaritans who have little if any information about them. Furthermore, some shelters provide a location (e.g., drop-off cages) where cats can be relinquished after business hours. This practice should be discouraged; however, if facilities elect to do this, every effort must be made to obtain a history through questionnaires that can be completed when the cat is left. The presence of staff to directly accept cats and obtain a history at the time of relinquishment is greatly preferred. 41 Even so, surrendering owners may or may not provide complete or accurate information, fearing that if they are honest about a pet's problems, the pet may be euthanized. Nonetheless, when available, a history can be extremely valuable, saving time and money as well as preventing unnecessary stress for cats and staff alike. Intake procedures should be in place to capture basic patient information, including both physical and behavioral data as well as the reason(s) for relinquishment. The importance of obtaining historical information cannot be overemphasized. In many cases, historical information may be used to expedite the disposition of the cat in the shelter.",

It is caused by infection of the skin, hair, and nails with microscopic fungal organisms that cause varying degrees of hair loss and dermatitis. The dermatophyte that causes the majority of cases in felines is Microsporum canis, which is responsible for greater than 96% of all cases. 82 If left untreated, most infections will spontaneously resolve within 12 to 14 weeks postinfection. However, during this time, the infected cat will infect the surrounding environment and other animals or humans in the area. Not all cats infected with dermatophytosis develop lesions, and some may become chronic carriers. Control of dermatophytosis is difficult, because the spores formed by M. canis can survive in the environment for up to18 months or longer and are extremely resistant to disinfectants and detergents. In addition, the presence of asymptomatic carriers makes it difficult to readily recognize all infected cats. For this reason, consideration should be given to culturing all cats prior to entry to a closed colony. In particular, Persian cats may be predisposed to dermatophyte infection and can be particularly difficult to clear once infected. In closed colony settings, dermatophyte testing by culture is highly recommended unless the source of the cat excludes the possibility of infection (e.g., specific pathogen-free [SPF] cats, purposebred laboratory cats). To screen cats using cultures, may take as long as 60 days following exposure for a cat to test positive. 62, 63 In the context of animal shelters, testing decisions are often influenced by the availability of resources. The AAFP's guidelines include recommendations specifically for shelters. They state that all cats should ideally be tested at the time of entry and again in 60 days in case of recent exposure. When cats test positive on screening tests (e.g., point-of-care enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] tests), the AAFP recommends that the results be confirmed by additional testing, including testing over an interval of time, because false positives can occur. However, such confirmatory testing requires substantial time and monetary investment and may not be feasible in many shelters. In recognition of this, the Association of Shelter Veterinarians established a policy statement on \"Management of Cats Who Test Positive for FeLV and FIV in an Animal Shelter,\" which states that the logistics and cost of holding and retesting unowned cats may be an ineffective use of resources. 5 In addition, it can be difficult to find homes for retroviruspositive cats, which in many instances translates into stressful, prolonged shelter stays. Such long-term confinement may compromise quality of life and may compound the emotional stress of caregivers who may later be faced with euthanizing cats that have been held for long periods awaiting confirmatory testing or adoption opportunities. For all of these reasons, many shelters elect to euthanize cats that test positive on retrovirus screening tests.",

However, given the limited resources of many shelters, the relatively low prevalence in healthy cats and the fact that transmission can be prevented by housing cats separately, it may not be cost effective for all shelters to screen every cat before selection for adoption. Each shelter should evaluate its own resources and determine their best use.

In contrast, rabies vaccination may be considered optional in most closed laboratory settings, because the risk of exposure should be absent and legal requirements may not apply. In animal shelters, vaccination against rabies is not generally recommended at the time of admission, simply because there is no benefit in terms of disease prevention or public health. 96 Vaccination on admission will not provide protection against an infection acquired prior to entry, nor will it limit concern if a cat with an unknown health history bites someone soon after admission. Rabies vaccination is recommended for cats prior to adoption when a veterinarian is available to administer it (or as otherwise legally prescribed by state laws). Alternatively, rabies vaccination may be administered as single modified live FVRCP vaccine will usually afford protection to cats that are at least 4 months of age. In contrast, killed products require a booster in 2 to 3 weeks to confer immunity, making their use largely ineffective in such environments. 96 To ensure rapid protection against panleukopenia, injectable FVRCP vaccines are preferred, but intranasal vaccines may offer advantages for feline respiratory disease, because they have been shown to rapidly induce local immunity at the site of exposure. Furthermore, intranasal vaccines may be better at overriding maternal antibody in young kittens. For this reason, they are often used to reduce the morbidity and severity of upper respiratory infection (URI) in preweaningage kittens. When intranasal vaccines are used in animal shelters, they should be used in combination with injectable FVRCP vaccines to ensure and optimize response against panleukopenia as well as the respiratory infections. 96 Ideally, all cats should receive a MLV FVRCP vaccine at least 1 week prior to entering a population. In the context of an animal shelter setting, this is seldom feasible. Vaccination immediately upon entry is the next best practice and can provide clinically significant protection for the majority of cats. If neither maternal antibody nor another cause of vaccine failure interferes, modified live vaccinations against panleukopenia will often confer protection against disease in only 5 days. 12 Intranasal vaccines against respiratory infections, including FHV and FCV, typically provide partial protection within 2 to 4 days. 18, 30 In animal shelters, all incoming cats and kittens 4 weeks of age and older that can be safely handled should receive an injectable MLV FVRCP vaccine immediately upon entry. A delay of even a day or two significantly compromises the vaccine's ability to provide timely protection. Even injured cats, those with medical conditions, and those that are pregnant or lactating should be vaccinated on entry, because vaccination will likely be effective and the small risk of adverse effects is outweighed by the high risk of disease exposure and infection in the shelter. 96 When vaccination of all cats on entry is not financially feasible, the next best practice is to vaccinate all those that are deemed adoptable at the time of entry or that are likely to be in the shelter long term. 41 Whenever possible, vaccinated cats should be separated from those that will remain unvaccinated (e.g., those that will be euthanized following a brief holding period) as soon as that determination can be made.",

In addition, kittens should be treated at 2-week intervals until 4 months of age.

Dry food is used for this method of feeding, because canned products left at room temperature are prone to spoiling. The major advantage of free choice feeding is that it is quick and easy: Caregivers simply need to ensure that fresh dry food is always available. Major disadvantages include the fact that cats that are not eating may remain unrecognized for several days, especially when more than one animal is fed together, and some cats may choose to continually overeat and become obese. Free choice feeding is an excellent method for cats that require frequent food consumption. These include kittens up to 5 to 6 months of age, queens in late gestation, and those that are nursing. Unlike dogs, who are competitive eaters by nature, free choice feeding may benefit cats that are group housed, because it ensures that there will be ample time for all members to eat, provided that dominant members of the colony do not block the access of subordinate cats. 49 Meal feeding using controlled portions of dry and/or canned food may be done as an alternative to or in conjunction with free choice feeding. When used alone, a minimum of two meals should be fed per day. 49 Meal feeding is ideal for any cat that requires controlled food intake and facilitates monitoring of appetite. Meal feeding also has the benefit of enhancing caregiver-cat bonding and provides a pleasant and predictable experience for cats when done on a regular daily schedule. Using a combination of free choice plus once daily meal feeding takes advantage of the positive aspects of both methods and works well for most cats in a population setting. Typically, dry food is available free choice, and a small meal of canned food is offered once daily. This combination approach accommodates the normal feeding behavior of cats by allowing them to eat several smaller meals throughout the day while allowing caregivers to monitor the cat's appetite at least for the canned food meal. As necessary for the individual cat, some may be fed additional meals of canned food to ensure adequate nutritional support.",

Body condition can be subjectively assessed by a process called body condition scoring, which involves assessing fat stores and, to a lesser extent, muscle mass. Fat cover is evaluated over the ribs, down the top line, tail base, and along the ventral abdomen and inguinal (groin) areas. Body condition score charts have been established on scales of 1 to 5 and 1 to 9. The author recommends use of the Purina body condition score chart which is based on a scale of 1 to 9 with 1 being emaciated and 9 being severely obese (see Figure 3 -3).",

Feline tooth resorption and gingivostomatitis are also common conditions of the feline oral cavity that can lead to chronic pain, affecting the cat's appetite and ability to self-groom, and negatively impacting quality of life. When painful dental disease is present, a plan for timely treatment should be identified and implemented. Preventive dental care may include tooth brushing, dental-friendly diets, and treats and chew toys in combination with periodic professional dental care. 33 These should be tailored to meet the needs of individuals in the population to optimize dental health.

Affiliative behaviors are those that facilitate close proximity or contact. Cats within groups commonly practice mutual grooming and allorubbing (e.g., rubbing heads and faces together). This may serve as a greeting or as an exchange of odor for recognition, familiarization, marking, or development of a communal scent. Cats of both genders and all ages may exhibit affiliative behaviors, and bonded housemates often spend a large proportion of their time in close proximity to one another. 8 Maternal behavior is the primary social pattern of the female cat, and cooperative nursing and kitten care are common. If allowed, queens form social groups along with their kittens and juvenile offspring. 24, 25 Tomcats typically reside within one group or roam between a few established groups. Within groups of cats, a social hierarchy or \"pecking order\" forms. 24, 90 Once established, this hierarchy helps to support peaceful co-existence of cats within a stable group, minimizing agonistic behaviors between members. Social hierarchy formation occurs within groups of cats that are sexually intact, as well as in those that are neutered.",

Within an established group, however, most social conflicts are not characterized by overt aggression. Instead, the main mode of conflict resolution is avoidance or deference (Figure 46-16) . 9,46,90 Deference behaviors include looking away, lowering the ears slightly, turning the head away, and leaning backward. Large numbers of cats peacefully co-exist together, using such strategies for avoidance provided ample space and resources are available for all members of the group. 10 Signs of social stress within groups of cats may manifest with overt aggression, increased spraying and turn their back, huddle, and avert their eyes from the gaze of other cats. Hiding is a normal and important coping behavior; however, when hiding is occurring with increased frequency or in response to stimuli that did not previously cause hiding, it should be recognized as a sign of stress. 46, 90 In group settings, the complexity of the social structure cannot be overestimated. The internal structure of social groups rarely represents a straightforward linear hierarchy, except in very small groups of less than four to five animals. 25 In larger groups of cats, there are usually one or two top-ranking individuals and one or two obvious subordinates, while the remaining cats share the middle space. 9, 44 Most cats within the group form affiliative or friendly relationships; however, some may fail to form such relationships and remain solitary. Colony members commonly display aggression toward C marking, or constant hiding. 46, 90 Lower-ranking cats may spend little time on the floor, remaining isolated on single perches or other locations where they may even eliminate, while higher-ranking cats remain more mobile, controlling access to food, water, and litter resources. 44 High-density housing conditions frequently result in such abnormal behaviors and are associated with increases in transmission of infectious diseases and reproductive failure as well. 50",

Current guidelines (European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals Used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes, ETS123) promulgated by the Council of Europe (http:// www.coe.int) for laboratory cats are similar, but proposed revisions call for substantially more floor space for cats, at 1.5 m 2 (16.7 ft 2 ) per adult cat with a height of at least 2 m (6.5 ft). 21,22 The revisions, which have not been approved to date, also call for the provision of shelves, a box-style bed, and a vertical scratching surface. Animal shelter facilities in the United States have traditionally been equipped with small perchless cages (e.g., 0.5 to 0.75 m or 1.5 to 2.5 ft long) that are poorly designed for housing cats. The Association of Shelter Veterinarians (http://www.sheltervet.org) recommends a minimum enclosure size of 1 m 2 (11 ft 2 ) for adult cats. 7 Commercially available cages are typically approximately 0.75 m (2.5 ft) deep (e.g., an arm-length deep so that they can be readily accessed); therefore a cage with a length of 1.2 m (4 ft) is required to provide this approximate square footage, and it will also allow for adequate separation of food, water, and litter ( Figure  46-21) . Similarly, the Cat Fanciers' Association (http:// www.cfa.org) recommends a minimum of 0.85 m 3 (30 ft 3 ) of space per cat for those weighing 2 kg or more. 16 Cubic measurements take into account the use of vertical space in addition to floor space, which is crucial for improving the quality of the environment. For example, a 0.85-m 3 (30- Larger enclosures also allow for better air circulation, which is an important consideration for control of feline housing for a single cat. Note the large 4-ft long cage, provision of a secure hiding place and perch with bed, separation of litter from resting and feeding areas, and appropriately sized litter box for this large cat.",

Studies indicate that employee satisfaction improves animal care and staff retention, both of which may positively impact population health and well-being. 95 For long-term housing of cats alternatives to traditional cage housing should be afforded. 41, 45, 46 At an absolute minimum, cats that are cage housed must be released each day and allowed an opportunity to exercise and explore in a secure enriched setting. For long-term housing, most cats will benefit from colony-style housing, provided there is sufficient space, easy access to feeding and elimination areas, an adequate number of comfortable hiding, and resting places and careful grouping and monitoring to ensure social compatibility among cats. Not every cat, however, will thrive in a group setting, and certain individuals will require enriched single housing, depending on their unique physical or behavioral needs. These may include cats that bully other cats or are otherwise incompatible and those with special medical needs. It is important to recognize that such singly housed cats will require more regular contact with their human caregivers and higher levels of mental and physical stimulation in order to maintain behavioral health during long-term confinement. Whenever possible, long-term housing of such individuals should be avoided. When cats are housed in amicable groups, it is easier to maintain proper behavioral welfare in the long term, because many of their social and emotional needs can be met by conspecifics.",

A subset of the bold, friendly personality type is the \"assertive\" or \"bully\" cat. 90 Bully cats constantly threaten other cats in a group setting in order to control access to food, litter, perches, or the attention of human caregivers. To maintain harmony, removing cats of this personality type from a colony is usually necessary. Reassignment is possible, but may prove difficult, necessitating single housing. Shy, timid cats sometimes have difficulty interacting successfully with more dominant members of a group or may fall victim to a bully, resulting in chronic stress and increased hiding. Placement of shy cats in smaller groups or with calm juvenile cats, where they will not be intimidated or harassed, is generally rewarding and often helps them to \"come out of their shells.\" 46, 90 Similarly, dominant cats will often accept calm, younger cats, as opposed to other adults by whom they may feel threatened.

            "text": "AGE Age is an important consideration regarding housing arrangements. 46 To ensure proper social and emotional development, kittens should be housed with their mother at least until they are weaned. Because it can be behaviorally beneficial, it is desirable for them to remain with her for a longer period of time when this is feasible. In fact, queens frequently do not fully wean their kittens until 12 to 14 weeks of age if left to their own devices. If older kittens are housed with their mother, it is important to provide a perch that allows her the option of periodically resting away from them if desired. Most queens will accept the kittens of another cat; therefore young orphan or singleton kittens should be housed with other lactating queens and/or kittens of similar age/size. In a shelter setting where there is a high turnover of cats, it may be beneficial to house young kittens up to 4 to 5 months of age in large cages or condos for biosecurity purposes. Juveniles and adults can be housed in colony rooms or runs but should be segregated by age (e.g., juveniles 5 to 12 months old, young adults, mature adults, geriatrics). Well-socialized juveniles tend to adapt quickly in a group setting with other cats of similar ages and exhibit healthy activity and play behavior. In contrast, mature adults and geriatric cats often have little tolerance for the high energy and playful antics of many younger cats, which can cause them substantial stress. For this reason, adult cats should be kept separate from juvenile cats, and aging or geriatric cats separate from other age groups. In animal shelters, compatible cats that enter the shelter together should be housed together regardless of age, whenever possible.",

Housing cats in runs is ideal for this purpose (Figure 46-25) . A well-equipped, 1.2-\u00d7 1.8-m (4-\u00d7 6-ft) run can comfortably house two to three adult cats depending on their familiarity and compatibility, or up to four juveniles (e.g., 6 to 12 months old). Juveniles tend to accept a slightly higher housing density than adults. Likewise, previously bonded housemates and families will generally peacefully co-exist at a higher density than will unfamiliar cats. When runs are used, they must have a top panel and should be at least 1.8 m (6 ft) high to allow caregivers easy access for cleaning and care. If chain-link is used, 2.5-cm (1-inch) mesh is ideal, but larger mesh can be used. Existing dog kennel runs can be converted into areas for cat housing. This is an important and practical consideration in animal shelters, because many shelters have experienced a decrease in dog intake, while the need for improved cat housing is great. Cats and dogs should never be co-housed in the same area; thus conversion should result in an exclusive cat housing area.",

These signs usually subside once a new social hierarchy and territorial limits (usually favored resting places) are established. In some cases, arrangement of incompatible cats, even within visible distance of one another, may create substantial anxiety, necessitating rearrangement (Figure 46-26) . In the case of animal shelters, where population interchange is high, it is generally not feasible to maintain consistent groupings of cats. This underscores the absolute necessity of careful selection and compatibility matching, as well as maintaining a variety of housing styles. Even in modestly populated, carefully introduced, environmentally enriched colonies, behavior problems may occur. For this reason, some facilities elect to use an \"all in-all out\" approach to avoid repeated introductions of new cats into stable groups. In animal shelters, bonded pairs and family groupings of cats frequently enter the shelter together and are usually perfect choices for co-housing. 46 Because cats do have strong preferences for new roommates, caregivers must expect to find many that are incompatible as roommates. If only one or two cats are responsible for social destabilization of a group, they can acknowledging that many factors influence the spatial needs of cats, including the overall quality of the environment as well as the relationships of the individual animals. 59 In sanctuary and laboratory situations where cats are housed for months to years in stable colonies, larger groupings of cats may be feasible, provided ample space is available. 46 Housing arrangements can also be created in which individual enclosures are maintained within a colony room. In this case, cats could be allowed to wander and interact freely in the colony room by day but be confined to their respective enclosures at night, for pair-housing of two adult cats. Note the multiple separate areas for resting, perching, hiding, feeding, eliminating, scratching, and playing. B, Cats enjoy the increased behavioral options provided by run-style housing.",

Open single perches should be separated by at least 0.6 m (2 ft) or staggered at different heights to ensure adequate separation, while larger perches should be available for cats who choose to rest together in close proximity. Many cats enjoy hammock-style perches or semienclosed box-style perches where they can hide. If there are not enough comfortable, desirable resting and hiding places, cats may choose to lie in litter boxes. Comfortable bedding (that is either disposable or can be easily laundered) should be provided. Not only do cats demonstrate preferences for resting on soft surfaces, they experience longer periods of normal deep sleep with soft bedding. 23 The environmental temperature should be kept comfortable and constant, and living quarters should be well ventilated, without drafts. By changing location within the colony (e.g., from the cooler surface of the floor to a sunny window), cats should be able to choose the environmental condition they prefer (Figure 46-27) . 46 In colony rooms, installation of stairs, shelves, and walkways are ideal for increasing the use of vertical space (Figure 46-28) . In larger rooms, installation of freestanding towers provides additional living and activity space and contributes to functionally reducing overcrowding (Figure 46-29) . Depending on the setting, it may not be desirable for cats to access areas above the level of an arm's reach so that cleaning is easy and cats can be easily retrieved from the highest perches if needed. Colony room design should also ensure that cats cannot easily escape. In some cases, constructing a foyer at the entrance to the room will be necessary to minimize the risk of escape when the room is entered (Figure 46-30) . In addition, ceilings should be constructed of solid surfaces, because cats can easily dislodge the usually be reassigned to another colony, because it is often the social grouping, not the individual, that is the problem. If a cat shows persistent incompatibility with other cats, he or she should be housed singly. Studies indicate that cats that fight at the time of initial introduction are nearly 40 times more likely to continue fighting in the following weeks and months. 61 If overt fighting occurs, cats should be permanently separated.

To the inexperienced observer, such signs may appear subtle (Figure 46 -43) . It is often the absence of normal behaviors (such as engaging in grooming or exercise) or subtle social signals (such as covert guarding of resources or dominant staring) that signify problems. Careful observers will note these behaviors and respond accordingly to ensure that stress or conflicts do not persist. When cats are well adjusted and housing arrangements meet their behavioral needs, they display a wide variety of normal behaviors, including a good appetite and activity level, sociability, grooming, appropriate play behavior, and restful sleeping (Figure 46-44) . 44, 46 Ultimately, the success of adaptation of cats to a new environment will depend on both the quality of the environment and the adaptive capacity of the individual. Although most adapt to new environments with time, some never adjust and remain stressed indefinitely, ultimately resulting in decline of physical as well as emotional health. When cats fail to adjust to their environment and remain markedly stressed and fearful despite appropriate behavioral care, every effort must be made to prevent long-term stays. Depending on the circumstances, transfer to another colony room, foster care, a shelter will result in saving more lives. To the contrary, euthanasia rates are highly correlated to intake rates, regardless of the number of animals that a facility houses.

Moving animals through the system efficiently is the foundation of effective population management. To move animals through the shelter more quickly, delays in decision making and the completion of procedures (e.g., intake processing, transfer from holding to adoption areas, spay/neuter surgery) must be eliminated or minimized whenever possible. In openadmission shelters, even delays of 1 to 2 days can have a dramatic effect on the shelter's daily census, particularly for shelters handling thousands of animals per year. This, in turn, affects the ability to provide adequate care. It is important to recognize that effective population management does not change the final disposition of an animal. It does mean that determinations are made as soon as possible, which serves both the individual animal as well as the population as a whole.",

High population density increases opportunities for introduction of infectious disease while increasing the contact rate among members of a group. Both the number of asymptomatic carriers of disease, such as those with upper respiratory infection, as well as susceptible cats in a given group are likely to increase, enhancing the odds of disease transmission among group members through both direct contact as well as fomites. In addition, crowding also increases the magnitude of many environmental stressors (e.g., noise levels, air contaminants) and compromises animal husbandry, all of which induce unnecessary stress and further inflate the risk of disease in the population. Indeed, crowding is one of the most potent stressors recognized in housed animals. 77 Although adequate space for animals is essential, it is crucial to recognize that crowding is not solely dependent on the amount of available space. It is also a function of the organization's ability to provide proper care that maintains animal health and well-being. Every organization has a limit to the number of animals for which it can provide proper care. When more animals are housed than can be properly cared for within the organization's capacity, caregivers become overwhelmed, and animal care is further compromised. 7, 54, 88 In animal shelters, crowding may also negatively impact adoption rates, because potential adopters often find crowded environments to be overwhelming and uninviting. If disease spread results as a consequence of the environmental conditions, animal adoptions may be further disrupted. Although unexpected shelter intake may occasionally result in temporary crowding, a good wellness program dictates that protocols must be in place to alleviate crowding and maintain a modestly populated environment for the health and protection of the animals and staff. 41 Regardless of the setting, facilities must limit the number of animals housed to the number for which they can provide proper space and care.",

            "text": "Quarantine involves the holding of healthy-appearing animals. It is most useful when animals enter a closed population to ensure that they are not incubating disease when they are introduced into the general population. Quarantine areas, with rigid biosecurity procedures in place, should be used to segregate healthy animals for observation. The use of such areas not only allows apparently healthy animals to be observed for developing signs of infectious disease, but it also allows time for response to vaccination in a highly biosecure environment where exposure risks are minimized. The use of quarantine is a mainstay of effective infectious disease control programs and is intended to prevent the introduction of disease into a population. It should be used whenever it is feasible to implement effectively, such as in a laboratory setting, a private cattery, or a low-volume, limited-admission sanctuary setting. However, quarantine practices are not effective in most animal shelters, because the high volume and turnover of animals precludes proper implementation of a true quarantine where an \"all in-all out\" system is used. 41 Instead, incoming animals are usually added to the \"quarantine group\" on a daily basis, effectively defeating the purpose of true quarantine and simply prolonging the animal's stay. This is especially concerning given the fact that a cat's length of stay in a shelter is a major risk factor for development of upper respiratory infection. 26 For this reason, the use of quarantine is not recommended in most shelter settings. Instead, high biosecurity areas are recommended for housing the most susceptible animals (e.g., kittens less than 4 to 5 months of age). On the other hand, quarantine is warranted when a serious disease is discovered in a shelter population. If healthyappearing animals are exposed during a serious outbreak, quarantine procedures should be used to stop the movement of animals and prevent further spread of disease. If possible, temporary closure to admittance is also recommended. Quarantine may also be required in bite cases to ensure compliance with state rabies laws. 41 The particular population setting will guide the clinician's determination regarding implementation and length of quarantine, if any. A 14-day quarantine is sufficient to determine that cats are not incubating many common infectious diseases, including feline panleukopenia. However, other diseases, including feline leukemia virus and dermatophytosis, can have longer incubation periods and will therefore require a longer quarantine period. 63, 82 In breeding colonies, early weaning and quarantine have been advocated to prevent infection of kittens with feline coronavirus. 1 Pregnant queens are isolated, and Product selection should take into consideration the conditions present in a given environment (e.g., the type of surface and the presence of organic matter) and the compound's activity against the pathogens for which the animals are at greatest risk. The nonenveloped viruses, panleukopenia and feline calicivirus, are of particular concern. It is important to note that despite product label claims to the contrary, multiple independent studies have consistently shown that quaternary ammonium disinfectants do not reliably inactivate these important feline pathogens. 31, 34, 56 In addition to selecting effective agents, ensuring adequate contact time followed by thorough drying of surfaces is essential for achieving proper disinfection.",

In animal shelters, it is important to consider that length of stay is associated with an increased risk of feline upper respiratory disease and that vaccination against core diseases often rapidly confers immunity. For these reasons, holding periods should be minimized whenever possible. In some cases, holding times will be influenced by legally required holding periods prescribed by state laws that allow owners a chance to reclaim lost pets. Legal holding periods are usually not required for owner-relinquished pets and preweaning-age animals, but a brief medical hold (e.g., 1 to 2 days) for evaluation and triage is usually warranted. Regardless, management practices that reduce length of stay are generally best for population health in a shelter setting.",

In populations where upper respiratory infection is problematic, having two isolation areas for cats with respiratory infections is ideal: one area for those cats with moderate to severe signs that will require more intensive monitoring and treatment, and a separate area for those cats with only mild clinical signs and those that have been treated and are nearly recovered. 43 When mildly symptomatic cats can be housed separately from those that are very ill, staff compliance with isolation procedures are often improved.

            "text": "When applying these standard recommendations to a particular setting, there are some practical considerations that should be taken into account. 41 First, even when ventilation systems provide 10 to 15 room air changes per hour, airflow may be restricted inside of cages or other enclosures within the room. In other words, the body of the room may be well ventilated, yet inside the cages, the air may remain relatively stagnant. In this case, ventilation may be improved by altering the housing design or arrangement; for example, the use of flow-through cages, runs, free-range rooms, or outdoor access may result in improved air quality. When considering the recommendations for 100% fresh, nonrecycled air with separate ventilation systems in various areas of the facility, consideration should be given to the fact that respiratory pathogens in cats are not aerosolized because of the cats' small tidal volume. 36 Although droplet transmission is possible, droplet spray does not extend more than 4 feet, and most transmission of respiratory disease in cats is through direct contact with infected cats, carriers, or fomites. 94 Although this recommendation seems prudent to consider, especially for isolation areas, it is very expensive to install and operate this type of ventilation system throughout a facility, especially in very cold or very hot climates. If air quality remains good and the facility maintains effective comprehensive wellness protocols, it may not be necessary for animal health. 41 More research is needed on the impact of such air exchange, but in the meantime, the author recommends consulting with an HVAC specialist to establish effective and efficient settings to suit the specific needs of the given population. In addition to ensuring good ventilation, it is imperative to use other strategies for maintaining good air quality, including regular maintenance of filters, control of dust and dander through routine vacuuming and periodic deep cleaning, and the use of dust-free litter. 52",

For example, neonatal kittens are more susceptible to hypothermia and generally require warmer temperatures than healthy adult cats. The location of the cats may also be a consideration. For example, enclosures located closer to floor level are often a few degrees cooler than those at higher levels. The exact temperature setting may also vary somewhat based on the season of the year. For instance, power companies typically recommend keeping the temperature between 25\u00b0 C and 26\u00b0 C (78\u00b0 F and 79\u00b0 F) during hot weather to conserve electricity and reduce power bills. 41 Laboratory guidelines recommend 30% to 70% humidity for cats. 54 Higher humidity (e.g., 70%) may be advantageous in areas housing cats with respiratory disease because moist air may be beneficial to the respiratory passages, whereas lower humidity (e.g., 40% to 50%) may be beneficial in other areas in order to reduce survival of infectious agents in the environment. Although the range considered acceptable is large, a given room should have a relatively constant humidity (i.e., it should not have large fluctuations). Hosing or even mopping a room usually results in temporary spikes in humidity, but these will be short lived in a well-ventilated room. 41 Adequate ventilation is crucial for good air quality. This is especially important for cats, because good air quality is essential for control of upper respiratory disease. Ten to fifteen air changes per hour is the standard recommendation for an animal room, but more or less airflow may be acceptable or necessary depending on the housing density. 54 Theoretically, the best case scenario, and what is typical in laboratory animal settings, is for the HVAC system to allow for 100% fresh (e.g., nonrecycled) air in each room so that the air entering a given room is exhausted out of the building and not recirculated to another room. Maintaining separate ventilation systems for various rooms or areas of a facility ensure both the physical and behavioral health of cats, as well as a healthy environment. A proactive, holistic approach coupled with compassion is required. When these are combined with careful attention to the unique needs and stress responses of cats, the result will be \"healthy, happy cats.\" be necessary to remove cats during their application and only return them to the environment once it is thoroughly dried and ventilated. If rodent control is necessary, the use of rodenticide baits should be avoided, because cats can be exposed even if the bait is not within their reach. Rodents that have ingested the poisonous bait may enter an animal enclosure and, if the animal ingests the rodent, the poison will affect that animal. Humane live traps can be used to capture rodents for removal from a facility. Food containers should be kept tightly sealed, and clutter should be minimized to discourage pests in the environment.",

Ammonium Compounds \u2022 Numerous products containing quaternary ammonium compounds are available, many of which contain detergents.

Cats that lick quaternary ammonium compounds may develop ulcers of the tongue that can be severe. The use of products containing phenolic compounds (e.g., products such as Lysol [Reckitt Benckiser, Parsippany, NJ]) or pine oils (e.g., products such as Pine-Sol, The Chlorox Company, Oakland, Calif.) should not be used in areas housing cats.
