Using mathematical modeling and time-series incidence data describing the trajectory of the outbreak among passengers and crew members, we characterize how the transmission potential varied over the course of the outbreak. Our estimate of the mean reproduction number in the confined setting reached values as high as ~11, which is higher than mean estimates reported from community-level transmission dynamics in China and Singapore (approximate range: 1.1-7). Our findings suggest that R t decreased substantially compared to values during the early phase after the Japanese government implemented an enhanced quarantine control. Most recent estimates of R t reached values largely below the epidemic threshold, indicating that a secondary outbreak of the novel coronavirus was unlikely to occur aboard the Diamond Princess Ship.",

The overall mean reproduction number in the confined setting reached values as high as ~11, which is higher than mean estimates reported from community-level transmission dynamics in China and Singapore in the range 1.1-7 [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . However, following the implementation of the quarantine period, the overall R t decreased substantially compared to values estimated during the early stage, but it exhibited fluctuations around the epidemic threshold, which likely prolonged the outbreak.",

Importantly, only those passengers and crew who tested positive for the novel coronavirus were permitted to disembark the Diamond Princess Ship, with more than 80 percentage of the passengers and crews still on board as of February 18, 2020.Our latest overall estimate of R t at 0.35 (95%CrI: 0.02, 2.19) with only 2% of R t estimates lying above the epidemic threshold of 1.0 suggested a low probability of observing a subsequent outbreak aboard the Diamond Princess Ship.Our findings indicate that the passenger-to-passenger transmission type dominated the transmission dynamics aboard the Diamond Princess Ship. The rapid increase in the overall R t from day 12 (January 31, 2020) to day 19 (February 7, 2020) is greatly influenced by the increase in passenger-to-passenger transmission, and this time period covers the time lag between February 1, 2020 when the index COVID-19 case was reported and February 5, 2020 when the Japanese government requested the passengers to stay inside their cabin after the detection of a cluster of COVID-19 positive cases[3,   17]. Upon the implementation of the quarantine orders, the overall R t and R t for passengers aboard the Diamond Princess Ship declined thereafter, while R t among crew maintained a steady level and only started to decline on day 25 of the outbreak 13, 2020). This is consistent with the fact that passengers staying inside their cabins led to a substantial decline in passenger-to-passenger transmission type except for their interaction with cabin mates. Indeed, the proportion of secondary infections inside the cabins increased from 7% (1/15) on February 6, 43% (3/7) on February 10, 2020 to 100% (1/1) on February 14, 2020 [3]. Thus, a high proportion of the symptomatic cases after the quarantine gradually shifted from largely passenger cases to crew cases. Indeed, despite their potential risk of acquiring the infection, crews had to continue to work to deliver services to isolated passengers. The distribution of the median Re by transmission type suggests that other transmission types likely contributed to this outbreak to some extent(Figure 3). Because one quarantine officer, one nurse, and one administrative officer contracted COVID-19 aboard the Diamond Princess Ship, the infection risk continued to be significant inside the Diamond Princess Ship.",

Although the high proportion of unavailable data (34% (103/300)) likely influenced a downward bias in estimates of transmission potential, our estimates still point to the high transmission potential of COVID-19 inside confined settings. Second, it is possible that reporting delays could have influenced our latest estimates of the effective reproduction number. In fact, the US government recently sent a chartered flight to transport the American passengers on board the Diamond Princess Ship, and after the disembarkation process, a total of 14 American passengers tested positive for the disease [18] on February 16, 2020. This event also contributes to a downward bias in R although the number of cases does not exceed the peak of the outbreak, further supporting the potent transmissibility of COVID-19 in confined settings. Our most recent estimate of the effective reproduction number of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic on board the Diamond Princess Ship was largely below the epidemic threshold of 1.0, which suggested a very low probability of observing secondary outbreaks of the disease in the Diamond Princess Ship.",
