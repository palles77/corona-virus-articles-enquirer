To address their individual roles in ER to Golgi transport, we used stage specific in vitro transport assays to synchronize movement of cargo to and from pre-Golgi intermediates, and GDP-and GTP-restricted forms of Sarl and ARF1 proteins to control coat recruitment.

COPI is recruited onto pre-Golgi intermediates where it initiates segregation of the anterograde transported protein vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) from the retrograde transported protein p58, a protein which actively recycles between the ER and pre-Golgi intermediates. We propose that sequential coupling between COPII and COPI coats is essential to coordinate and direct bi-directional vesicular traffic between the ER and pre-Golgi intermediates involved in transport of protein to the Golgi complex. N 'EWLY synthesized proteins are transported from the ER through the early secretory pathway via coated vesicular carriers. Two distinct protein complexes are now recognized to mediate vesicle budding from the ER and Golgi compartments. These include COPI or \"coatomer\" and COPII (for reviews see Nuoffer and Balch, 1994; Barlowe, 1995) .

A role for COPI coats in ER to Golgi transport in mammalian cells was demonstrated by the ability of antibodies against the 13-COP subunit to inhibit export from the ER in vitro (Peter et al., 1993) , and the requirement for a 19 S 13-COP and Sec23 containing protein complex(es) in transport of protein from the ER to pre-Golgi intermediates (Peter et al., 1993) . These results demonstrated that COPI plays a necessary, but not sufficient role in the appearance of pre-Golgi intermediates composed of clusters of vesicles and small tubules (referred to as vesicular-tubular clusters or VTCs 1) (Peter et al., 1993) . A similar block in ER to Golgi transport was observed in vivo after microinjection of [3-COP antibodies (Pepperkok et al., 1993) . However, in this case, cargo was found to principally accumulate in pre-Golgi intermediates which had tubular connections with the ER (Pepperkok et al., 1993) . Genetic studies in mammalian cells have also demonstrated that ER to Golgi transport requires the function of t-COP (Guo et al., 1994) . Consistent with these biochemical and genetic requirements for COPI in ER to Golgi transport, morphological analyses have demonstrated that COPI coats are principally associated with pre-Golgi structures. They are localized to VTCs and the more tubular/fenestrated elements found at the cis face of the Golgi stack (the cis-Golgi network or CGN [Mellman and Simon, 1992] ) (Oprins et al., 1993; Pepperkok et al., 1993; Pind et al., 1994) .",

In contrast, deletion of Sec26p, the yeast [3-COP homologue, dramatically reduces the number of vesicles, and leads to exaggeration and tubularization of the ER (Duden et al., 1994) . These proteins, along with ARFlp and ARF2p (Stearns et al., 1990) , are required for ER to Golgi transport in vivo in yeast.

These proteins, when recruited by activation of the small GTPase Sarlp , represent the minimal set of cytosolic proteins required for vesicle budding from yeast ER Barlowe et al., 1994) . The GTPase cycle of Sarlp involves components of the COPII coat. Sec23p is the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) (Yoshihisa et al., 1993) whereas a membrane-associated protein, Sec12p is the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) d'Enfert et al., 1991; Nakano et al., 1988) . GEF function is required for vesicle budding Kuge et al., 1994) and GTP hydrolysis is required to promote vesicle fusion after budding (Barlowe et al., 1994) . These results suggest a cycle in which the GAP component of the assembled coat complex on budded vesicles triggers coat destabilization by accelerating the intrinsic rate of hydrolysis of Sarlp. While the specific GAP activity for ARF1 is currently unknown, COPI-coated vesicles released from Golgi membranes contain bound ARF1 and can be isolated in the presence of GTP (Orci et al., 1993b; Ostermann et al., 1993) . Therefore, COPI uncoating has been suggested to be coupled to later steps in vesicle targeting or fusion (Elazar et al., 1994) .",

            "text": "The requirement for COPII and COPI coats is puzzling. Both coats have been demonstrated to be involved in vesicle budding (Barlowe et al., 1994; Ostermann et al., 1993) yet, as summarized above, both COPII and COPI appear to function in ER to Golgi transport. Such a strong similarity in coat complex function clearly raises the question of their individual roles. To address this question, we now demonstrate that COPI and COPII are recruited separately and independently. To establish the relationship between this observation and their unique roles in transport, we used temperature blocks to synchronize the movement of cargo to and from pre-Golgi intermediates. In addition, we used mutants of ARF1 and Sarl proteins which are restricted to GDP-or GTP-bound forms to selectively control COPI and COPII assembly and disassembly. We find that both coats are required to transport the same cargo molecule, in this case vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G), from the ER to the Golgi stack. COPII, but not COPI is required for vesicle budding and export of VSV-G from the ER leading to the build-up of pre-Golgi VTCs. COPII coats are lost rapidly following vesicle budding from the ER. In contrast, COPI is essential for the accumulation of ER-derived cargo in pre-Golgi intermediates (VTC). We find that efficient retrograde transport of p58, a marker for pre-Golgi elements Saraste and Svensson, 1991) , and segregation from VSV-G occurs from VTCs. Segregation is mediated by COPI, but not COPII. p58 is efficiently returned to the ER by COPI where it accumulates in the absence of COPII function. These results demonstrate a key role for COPI in retrograde transport in mammalian cells. Collectively, these resuits suggest that COPII is responsible for mobilization of cargo from the ER in a reaction which is coupled to the segregation of anterograde and retrograde transported proteins from pre-Golgi elements via COPI. This segregation event appears to be essential to assure the proper anterograde transport of cargo to the Golgi stack. nized with the carboxyl-terminal 16 amino acids of VSV-G (Indiana serotype) coupled to KLH .

COPI recruitment was measured using quantitative immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody (M3A5) specific for 13-COP (Allan and Kreis, 1986; Pepperkok et al., 1993) . COPII recruitment was measured using an antibody specific for yeast Sec23p (Hicke and Schekman, 1989; Hicke et al., 1992) , which cross-reacts with a mammalian homologue localized to the transitional region of the cell (Orci et al., 1991a; Peter et al., 1993) . As shown in Fig. 1 A (compare a to e), both COPI and COPII coat complexes were efficiently recruited to membranes in the presence of GTP',/S, a nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP. This reagent prolongs the activation of both ARF1 and Sarlp GTPases, which regulate the binding of COPI and COPII, respectively. Whereas COPI recruitment was detected in the presence of nanomolar concentrations of GTP~/S ( Fig. 1 B, open circles), no enhancement of COPII binding was observed. COPII binding required the addition of at least 1 ~M GTP'yS as evidence by the first detectable increase in the level of Sec23 bound to membranes at this concentration ( Fig. 1 B, closed circles) . For both coat complexes, binding was saturable ( Fig. 1 B) and was membrane dependent (not shown). In contrast to GTP-yS, additi6n of A1F 4 , a reagent which stabilizes ARF1 in its GTP-bound form and promotes COPI recruitment to Golgi membranes (Finazzi et al., 1994) , specifically enhanced the recruitment of COPI, but not COP/I, coats to total microsoreal membranes ( Fig. 1 B, inset) .",

When both mutant GTPases were added to the same cocktail, the levels of recruitment observed were similar to those observed when incubated separately ( Fig. 1 A, compare d to b and c). Such results demonstrate that the Sarl-and ARFl-activated mutants do not, in a dominant fashion, negatively influence the recruitment of the reciprocal coat.

Incubation of tsO45 infected cells at the restrictive temperature (39.5\u00b0C) results in the complete retention of VSV-G in the ER (Fig. 4 a) . Transfer of cells to the permissive temperature (32\u00b0C) results in the synchronous export of tsO45 VSV-G to the Golgi Plutner et al., 1992) . Cytosol and ATP-dependent transport of VSV-G from the ER to the Golgi was quantitated by following the processing of VSV-G to cis/medial-Golgi associated, endoglycosidase H (endo H)-resistant forms (Schwaninger et al., 1991; Davidson and Balch, 1993) . As shown in Fig. 2 A, addition of increasing concentrations of the activated (GTP-restricted) myr-ARFl(Q71L) and Sarla(H79G) mutants strongly inhibited the transport of VSV-G to the Golgi stack. No inhibition was observed in the case of the nonmyristoylated ARFl(Q71L) mutant attesting to the specificity of the observed inhibition, nor was inhibition observed by incubation in the presence of a 10-fold excess of wild-type Sarla (Kuge et al., 1994 ; not shown).

For example, in Fig. 2 B (g-i), transport was inhibited by 44% with A R F 1 ( Q 7 1 L ) and 36% with S a r l ( H 7 9 G ) when added separately. Transport was inhibited nearly 100% by incubation in the presence of both mutants (Fig.  2 B, i) . Thus, at low concentrations of the A R F 1 -and Sarl-activated mutants, each protein separately interferes with different steps in the overall pathway, a result consistent with their independent effects on COPI or COPII recruitment, respectively. However, when either wild-type Sarl or wild-type A R F 1 function becomes limiting due to displacement by the actions of their respective mutant, retention of coat components interferes in a dominant, synergistic fashion with the overall functionality of the E R to Golgi transport machinery. The combined data provide evidence that COPII and COPI may be involved in sequential events along the same pathway.",

To examine this possibility, we con-ducted a two stage in vitro transport reaction taking advantage of the fact that Ca z\u00f7 is required at a late step preceding fusion of VTCs to the Golgi stack, but not for vesicle budding from the E R Pind et al., 1994) . In these experiments, semi-intact NRK cells, cytosol, and ATP were incubated in the absence of Ca 2+ (by addition of EGTA) for 60 min to accumulate VSV-G in clusters of 60-70 nm vesicular carriers and small tubular elements (referred to as EGTA-VTCs) which are largely indistinguishable from normal VTCs Pind et al., 1994) (Fig. 3, stage 1 ). Subsequently, cells were pelleted and resuspended in a cocktail which was supplemented with Ca 2+, and incubated for an additional 90 min to promote transport of VSV-G to the Golgi stack (Fig. 3, stage 2) . Addition of GTP~/S, or activated ARF1 and Sarl mutants in the first stage of the two-stage incubation, significantly blocked transport during subsequent incubation in stage 2 in their absence (Fig. 3, a-d) . In contrast, addition of either GTP-yS or the activated mutants to stage 2 after accumulation in EGTA-VTCs had little or no effect on transport in the presence of Ca 2+ (Fig. 3, e-h) . Since E G T A per se does not interfere with COPI recruitment (see below), these results provide strong evidence that the activated forms of Sarl or ARF1 do not inhibit transport by blocking acceptor (Golgi) function, rather their sites of action are on earlier steps in the transport of VSV-G from the ER through pre-Golgi intermediates.",

Since these sequential steps are not evident in our biochemical assay, we followed VSV-G transport from the ER to the Golgi stack morphologically using indirect immunofluorescence. We took advantage of the fact that incubation of cells at reduced temperature (16\u00b0C) results in the accumulation of anterograde transported proteins such as VSV-G and recycling proteins such as p58 (a frequently used marker for pre-Golgi intermediates [Saraste et al., 1987; Saraste and Svensson, 1991] ) in numerous pre-Golgi VTCs which reside adjacent to budding sites of the ER scattered throughout the peripheral cytoplasm and adjacent to the cis face of the peri-nuclear Golgi stack Lotti et al., 1992; Oprins et al., 1993; Plutner et al., 1992) . These structures show no continuity with the ER and lack ER marker proteins such as calnexin (Saraste and Svensson, 1991; not shown) . While incubation at 32\u00b0C results in movement of protein to and from pre-Golgi intermediates and the Golgi stack in a rapid and highly dynamic fashion, incubation in vitro at 16\u00b0C allows us to isolate the first step in delivery of cargo to VTCs from other steps of the early secretory pathway.",

In vitro, we found that VSV-G and p58 first appeared in VTCs at 30-60 min and continued to accumulate in pre-Golgi VTCs for up to 4 h (not shown), reflecting the reduced kinetics of transport in permeabilized cells (~2-3fold) (Davidson and Balch, 1993; Plutner et al., 1992) . In the presence of cytosol, VSV-G accumulated in 16\u00b0C-VTCs as indicated by the strong overlap in the distribution of VSV-G and p58 (Fig. 4, c and d, arrowheads) . Transport of VSV-G to VTCs was ATP (not shown) and cytosol dependent (Fig. 4 , compare e to c). In the absence of cytosol, the distribution of p58, which at the beginning of the transport reaction can be readily detected in the perinuclear cis-Golgi region (Fig. 4 b, arrowhead) Schwaninger et al., 1992) , redistributed to a more diffuse ER-like pattern (Fig. 4 , compare f to d). In this particular case, the absence of cytosolic COPI may lead to some retrograde fusion of Golgi compartments to the ER similar to the effects of brefeldin A (BFA) in vivo (for a review see Lippincott-Schwartz, 1993) .",

ARFI(T31N) did not, however, block ER export when examined using indirect immunofluorescence, although accumulation of VSV-G in 16\u00b0C-VTCs was inefficient ( Fig. 6 d, arrowheads) compared to the nonmyristoylated ARFI(T31N) control (Fig. 6 , compare d to c). This result was similar to the effects of BFA on the accumulation of VSV-G in punctate VTCs in vivo at 16\u00b0C (Fig. 6 , e [minus BFA] and f [plus BFA]). A number of lines of evidence suggest that both BFA and the ARF1 GDP-restricted mutant function by preventing COPI coat assembly Elazar et al., 1994; Lippincott-Schwartz, 1993) .

However, when transport was initiated by incubation at 32\u00b0C in the presence of cytosol and ATP, VSV-G was rapidly transported to the Golgi stack as indicated by the short lag period (~5 min) (Fig. 8 A,~ closed circles) compared to the much longer lag (15-20 min) required for export from the E R (Fig. 8 A, open circles) in the same experiment Plutner et al., 1992) .

Accumulation of VSV-G and p58 in 16\u00b0C-VTCs before preparation of semi-intact cells allows us to focus not only on the anterograde transport of VSV-G from this step to the Golgi stack, but, in addition, the retrograde transport of p58 to the E R as noted previously (Fig. 4 j) . Before incubation in vitro, the distribution of VSV-G and p58 nearly completely overlapped in VTCs which appeared as scattered punctate elements distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 9, a [VSV-G] and b [p58] ). Incubation in vitro for 30 min at 32\u00b0C led to the delivery of VSV-G to perinuclear Golgi elements (Fig. 9 c) which overlapped with the distribution of a-l,2-mannosidase II (Man II) (not shown). During incubation, overlap between p58 and VSV-G in the peripheral cytoplasm was markedly decreased ( c and d) suggesting that segregation of p58 and VSV-G was in progress. Addition of the activated ARF1(Q71L) mutant resulted in complete stabilization of the overlap of VSV-G and p58 during the 30-min incubation at 32\u00b0C in the presence of cytosol and ATP (Fig. 9, ",

This observation was confirmed using immunoelectron microscopy where VSV-G could be readily detected in VTCs (Fig. 5, g and h) , but not the Golgi stack (not shown), While the activated ARF1 mutant prevented the export of both p58 and VSV-G from 16\u00b0C-VTCs, the Sarl GDPrestricted mutant did not interfere with the exit of p58 from these pre-Golgi intermediates and led to its redistribution to the ER (Fig. 9, compare j to b) . These results reinforce the observation that retrograde transport is COPII independent. In contrast, VSV-G was principally retained in numerous punctate sites in the presence of the Sarl-GDP restricted mutant (Fig. 9 i) , consistent with the effects of this mutant on inhibiting processing to the endo H-resistant form (Fig. 8 B, J0 , but suggesting that COPII function in regards to anterograde transport was incomplete. Incubation in the presence of the activated Sar1(H79G) also resulted in the retention of VSV-G in VTCs (Fig. 9 g) as indicated by their vesicular-tubular structure using immunoelectron microscopy (Fig. 5 , e and f). Although segregation of p58 from VSV-G was readily detected (Fig. 9 , g [VSV-G] and h [p58]), distribution of p58 in VTCs was not inhibited to the same extent observed during incubation in the presence of the Sarl-GDP mutant (Fig. 9 , compare h [Sarl-GTP] to i [Sarl-GDP] ). This would be expected if p58 was recycled to the ER, but re-exported to VTCs through the recruitment and stabilization of COPII coats by the GTP-restricted mutant.",

When VSV-G was accumulated in 16\u00b0C-VTCs in vitro, its distribution was found to overlap with the distribution of B-COP in punctate intermediates scattered throughout the peripheral cytoplasm (Fig. 10, a and b) . In contrast, Sec23 was largely absent from punctate VSV-G containing VTCs and distributed principally in a weak ER/ nuclear envelope reticular-staining pattern (Fig. 10, c and  d) . When cells containing VSV-G in 16\u00b0C-VTCs were incubated in vitro at 32\u00b0C in the presence of activated Sar1(H79G) mutant, we noted a striking recruitment of Sec23 to punctate elements which overlapped with the distribution with VSV-G (Fig. 10, g and h) . Under these conditions, colocalization with p58 was completely lost (Fig. 9,  g and h) . These findings support our previous observations that the addition of Sarl(H79G) strongly promoted the binding of Sec23 to microsomes (Fig. 1) and inhibited transport from 16\u00b0C-VTCs to the Golgi stack (Fig. 8 B and Fig. 9 g) .

No accumulation of Sec23 was detected under these circumstances (not shown). The recruitment of [3-COP to VTCs and to the pre-Golgi region in the presence of ARF1-GTP confirms our previous observation that addition of activated ARF1 strongly promotes the binding of [3-COP to microsomes (Fig. 1 A) . Since the accumulation of Sec23 on 16\u00b0C-VTCs cannot be observed unless the Sarlp GTPase activity is blocked (either by activated Sat1 or GTPyS [not shown]), these results suggest that under normal transport conditions, COPII coats are rapidly lost following vesicle budding, but that VTCs still retain Sarl/COPII receptors. This result is consistent with the fact that incubation of semi-intact cells at 32\u00b0C in the presence of GTPyS without preincubation at reduced temperature also leads to a strong overlap in the distribution of [3-COP and Sec23 (not shown).",

While the ARF1-GTP led to striking recruitment of COPI to the Golgi region ( Fig. 11 d) , as observed in the presence of ARF1-GTP alone to 16\u00b0C-VTCs ( Fig. 10 f) , this result was not observed in the presence of Sarl-GDP alone (Fig.  11 b) . Thus, the GTP-restricted form of ARF1 stabilizes pre-existing VTCs while Sarl-GDP prevented COPII vesicle formation and export of VSV-G from the ER. These results establish that COPII temporally precedes COPI function in ER to Golgi transport.",

Therefore, we examined whether COPI binding could still be detected during the generation of EGTA-VTCs and whether p58 segregation can occur in the absence of Ca 2+. We noted using indirect immunofluorescence that VTCs which have accumulated VSV-G in the presence of EGTA were largely deficient in p58 staining (not shown), suggesting that recycling had occurred.

Second, while COPII appears to be the fundamental basis for vesicular export from the ER, COPI coats are critical for stabilization of pre-Golgi intermediates and recycling of p58. Third, it is evident that VTCs generated from ER-derived vesicles are very dynamic structures which undergo continuous maturation during the transport of cargo to the Golgi complex. They play a critical function in the secretory pathway as they are the first site of segregation of retrograde transported protein, an event which appears to be coupled to the anterograde transport of cargo (Fig. 13 ).",

We have now demonstrated that the principle mechanism of export of VSV-G is also via a GTP-dependent recruitment of COPII vesicle coats (Fig. 13) . A similar mechanism promotes the export of the recycling protein p58 from the ER and is the basis for the formation of pre-Golgi intermediates (Fig. 13) . These conclusions are derived from previous studies (Kuge et al., 1994) and current studies which demonstrate that the Sarl(T39N) GDPrestricted mutant prevents COPII recruitment, blocks vesicle budding and cargo mobilization from the ER, and prevents VTC build-up. The requirement for COPII in budding is also consistent with the effect of the activated Sar1(H79G) mutant which led to the accumulation of p58 and VSV-G in pre-Golgi clusters containing numerous 60nm vesicles. Since VSV-G is concentrated in the presence of GTP~/S , presumably reflecting COPIIcoated vesicles, and in vesicles or VTCs which accumulate in the presence of activated ARF1 and Sarl mutants (Bannykh, S., and W. E. Balch, manuscript in preparation) , it is now apparent that COPII coats participate either directly or indirectly in the sorting and concentration of cargo . Interestingly, the EMP24 protein, a component of ER-derived COPII-coated vesicles, was recently demonstrated to cause a defect in transport of selected proteins from the ER to the Golgi (Schimmoller et al., 1995) . Hence, at least one component of COPII vesicles appears to be required for sorting. It remains to be determined if such molecular sorting events regulate the actual recruitment of COPII components during ER budding. were preincubated for 2 h at reduced temperature (16\u00b0C) to accumulate VSV-G in VTCs before permeabilization as described in Materials and Methods.

However, it is now clear that the receptor(s) for Sarl/COPII components remain to be segregated from VSV-G in 16\u00b0C-VTCs which accumulate at reduced temperature. This conclusion is based on the observation that the addition of the activated Sarl(H79G) mutant led to extensive recruitment of Sec23 to these intermediates after a shift to 32\u00b0C.

Therefore, it is likely that a receptor or docking protein for Sarlp is exported from the ER in yeast as well. The lack of COPII colocalization with the exported cargo in VTCs highlights the role of the coat component Sec23 as a Sarl GAP (Yoshihisa et al., 1993) which must rapidly promote Sarl hydrolysis and loss of COPII coats after vesicle budding.",

            "text": "While COPII appears to be the principle coat responsible for export of cargo from the ER, the inability to recruit COPI coats had a significant effect on the appearance of VSV-G in pre-Golgi intermediates. What, then, is the role of COPI in this step? Previous biochemical studies exploring the role of COPI in ER to Golgi transport in vitro led to the suggestion that it is involved in ER budding (Peter et al., 1993) . In these experiments, an antibody specific to 13-COP largely prevented mobilization of VSV-G from the ER to punctate p58 containing VTCs (Peter et al., 1993) . When the antibody was microinjected into living cells, VSV-G accumulated in VTCs which had extended tubular linkages to the ER (Pepperkok et al., 1993) . In the latter case, it was concluded that membrane synthesis continued, but that budding was blocked (Pepperkok et al., 1993) . The current studies have allowed us to focus on the above events and to now clarify these observations. We found that by blocking the recruitment of COPI in vivo by BFA, or in vitro by the ARF1-GDP restricted mutant, we markedly suppressed the appearance of VTCs. Since vesicle formation via COPII would be expected to be normal under these conditions, it is now apparent that these vesicles were not detected previously using indirect immunofluorescence due to their failure to efficiently accumulate into compact VTCs (Peter et al., 1993) . In addition, we cannot presently rule out the possibility that in the absence of COPI, ER-derived vesicles may be unstable and fuse back to the ER via an uncoupled mechanism, similar to the effects of BFA on the Golgi stack in vivo (Lippincott-Schwartz, 1993) and in vitro (Elazar et al., 1994) . A partial reduction in COPI function induced by microinjection of 13-COP specific antibody may also contribute to the instability of VTCs and account for the BFA-like tubular connections connecting VTCs to the ER in vivo (Pepperkok et al., 1993) . Thus, while COPI is not critical for export from the ER, it plays an essential role in post-ER events. Insight from the current studies now clarifies our previous observation that while purified coatomer complex failed to support ER export, a 19 S cytosolic fraction which contained both COPI and COPII (as judged by the presence of Sec23 and [3-COP) (Peter et al., 1993) , efficiently supported ER export in vitro. In this case, the combined action of COPII and COPI components functioned in concert to promote vesicle budding and intermediate stability.",

While COPI is absent from yeast vesicles generated using purified Sarl and COPII components (Barlowe et al., 1994) , yeast ER-derived vesicular carriers generated in vitro in the presence of cytosol are significantly enriched in COPI after ffactionation through a number of density gradients and therefore COPI is apparently a component of these vesicles. One interpretation of these results is that COPI recruitment follows budding from the ER in both yeast and mammalian ceils (Fig. 13) . Genetic studies reinforce this concept. A null mutant lacking [3-COP (Sec26) displays an ER to Golgi transport block leading to the accumulation of ER membranes (Duden et al., 1994) . In this case, recruitment of COPI after budding may also be required to stabilize yeast intermediates in vivo. Since we observed a modest synergism in the effects of the Sarl and ARF1 mutants on transport, we suggest there is a close temporal coupling in the exchange of coats after budding (Fig. 13) . The purpose of this sequential recruitment may be to set the stage for subsequent recycling of components from pre-Golgi intermediates to the ER (see below).",

In mammalian cells, both Sec23 (Orci et al., 1991a) and Secl3 (Shaywitz et al., 1994) are localized to ER transitional elements. 13-COP is also localized to VTCs adjacent to budding sites in vivo and in vitro Oprins et al., 1993; Pepperkok et al., 1993; . Such a close overlap is particularly exaggerated in the presence of GTP~/S where both COPI and COPII can be found in the same punctate VTCs. An important issue which still remains to be resolved is whether both COPII and COPI coats can occupy the same vesicle or tubule within VTCs. Related to this issue was the surprising observation that anterograde transport from 16\u00b0C-VTCs is sensitive to Sarl mutants despite the fact that these structures are not in continuity with the ER Saraste and Svensson, 1991) . Although we cannot rule out the possibility that COPII mediates a second round of vesicle budding from VTCs, we feel that inhibition by Sarl mutants is likely to reflect their interference with a requirement for sorting of retrograde transported proteins such as COPII receptors from pre-Golgi intermediates. This sorting step is incomplete at reduced temperature, but is required for normal maturation of VTCs. We suggest that 16\u00b0C-VTCs are intermediates in transition between a COPII-and COPI-dependent state, reflecting the possible need for segregation of recycling components by COPI (see below) to insure further anterograde transport of specific cargo through the secretory pathway.",

In contrast, inhibiting COPII function by the Sarl-GDP-restricted mutant, a condition which maintains normal COPI function, did not affect retrograde transport of p58. The combined results provide evidence for the first time that COPI is involved in the retrograde recycling of p58 from pre-Golgi intermediates to the ER (Fig. 13 ). This conclusion is in agreement with the proposed role of COPI in retrograde transport in yeast (Cosson and Letourneur, 1994; Letourneur et al., 1995) . Both p58 and its human homologue p53 (Schindler et al., 1993) carry di-lysine ER retrieval motifs at their cytoplasmic carboxyl-termini which bind COPI in vitro (Cosson and Letourner, 1994) . p58 and other di-lysine motif containing proteins present in ER-derived vesicles and newly formed VTCs may be responsible for the recruitment of COPI to membranes after vesicle release from the ER. Thus, a key event in the functional maturation of VTCs may be the segregation of p58 and in particular, Sarl/COPII receptors, which need to be recycled for reuse in subsequent rounds of vesicle budding from the ER. Such a sequential, coupled requirement for coat assembly mediated by the Sarl and ARF1 GTPases would confer vectorial progression linking recycling to anterograde transport. Sequential coupling mechanisms are also found for different classes of GTP-binding proteins, those involved in protein synthesis. Both Ef-Tu and Ef-G are required to assure the proper selection and incorporation of amino acids into newly synthesized proteins. Sequential coupling mechanisms may therefore serve as a general paradigm for the interaction of multiple GTPases to confer vectorial progression in a variety of complex cellular processes.",

            "text": "Given the dynamic character of the pre-Golgi intermediates, we would like to suggest that previous morphological/biochemical descriptions represent different steps in their formation and maturation. Each of these steps is likely to involve specific membrane-associated and cytosolic factors. These may be differentially rate-limiting in cells of diverse origin and under different incubation conditions. However, one fact evident from the present studies is the apparent similarity of pre-Golgi elements to endosomes involved in the segregation and recycling of proteins derived from the cell surface. Endosomes are dynamic structures, of variable morphology and function to segregate proteins to different cellular destinations following input from the plasma membrane. Given this analogy, we propose that the term \"exosome\" may provide a more useful designation for pre-Golgi intermediates (Beckers et al., 1990; Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1989) . It demarks their biochemical role in recycling and emphasizes the importance of segregation for anterograde transport of cargo through the secretory pathway.

Semi-intact cells were incubated (40 ~1 final volume) at 32\u00b0C for 90 min in the presence of the indicated concentration of the nonmyristoylated (open circles) or myristoylated (closed circles) ARF1(T31N-GDP). The fraction of VSV-G processed to endo H-resistant forms was determined as described in Materials and Methods. Transport from 16\u00b0C-VTCs to the Golgi stack is sensitive to GTPyS, AIF4-, and Sarla and ARF1 trans dominant mutants. (A) (Open circles) After infection at the restrictive temperature (4.5 h), semi-intact cells were pulse-labeled at 39.5\u00b0C, transferred to ice, perforated, and incubated in vitro at 32\u00b0C for the indicated time. The fraction of VSV-G processed to endo H-resistant forms was determined as described in Materials and Methods. (closed circles) After infection at the restrictive temperature (4.5 h), cells were pulse-labeled at 39.5\u00b0C, and then rapidly equilibrated to 16\u00b0C and incubated for a total time of 2 h to mobilize VSV-G to 16\u00b0C-VTCs before preparation of semi-intact cells as described in Materials and Methods. Semi-intact cells were subsequently incubated in vitro for the indicated time at 32\u00b0C (closed circles). The fraction of VSV-G processed to endo H-resistant forms was determined as described in Materials and Methods. (B) Semi-intact cells prepared from cells preincubated in vivo for 2 h at 16\u00b0C were subsequently incubated (40 ixl final volume) at 32\u00b0C for 30 min in vitro in a cocktail supplemented with the indicated inhibitors: (a) none, (b) 10 mM KF, 30 IxM A1C13, (c) 100 txM GTPyS, (d) 2.7 /~g ARFl(Q71L-GTP), (e) 1 Ixg Sarl(H79G-GTP), and (f) 1 Ixg Sarl(T39N-GDP). The results are reported as fraction of total VSV-G processed to endo H-resistant forms as described in Materials and Methods.",
