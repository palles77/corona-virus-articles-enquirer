In a large multisite study of 2638 children hospitalized with CAP, 89% had radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Standard-of-care testing identified a viral infection in 66% of patients, a bacterial infection in 8% of patients, and both a viral and bacterial infection in 7% of patients (Jain et al., 2015) . The current Pediatric CAP Guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)/Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS) recommend blood culture and viral testing for hospitalized patients with moderate to severe community-acquired or complicated pneumonia in order to identify a pathogen(s). Recommended empiric treatment include a thirdgeneration cephalosporin for any patient with evidence of empyema, with the addition of vancomycin or clindamycin if there are clinical, laboratory, or imaging characteristics consistent with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (Bradley et al., 2011) (MRSA) infection.",

Patient demographics for the remaining cohort demonstrated an average age of 4.16 years and 53% male gender (Table 1 ). The average length of hospital stay was 14 days, reflecting the fact that CFPNGS tended to be requested only in cases of complicated pneumonia. In total, 10 of the 15 children were diagnosed with complicated CAP (pneumonia with pleural effusion or empyema), and 9 required admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Nine children were treated with thoracoscopy for parapneumonic effusion or empyema, and 6 children required surgical intervention with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery.

            "text": "1.89-to 4.08-fold (Grijalva et al., 2010) . Although there is an increase in staphylococcal pneumonia, there may be a decrease in MRSA (Hult\u00e9n et al., 2018) . Prior to the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and the emergence of community-acquired MRSA, many physicians felt confident in the management of CAP based on a presumed diagnosis of pneumococcal or streptococcal pneumonia in children admitted with CAP. However, given the changing epidemiological landscape of pediatric CAP, many physicians are now less confident in the diagnosis of fully susceptible S. pneumoniae in the absence of a positive culture. Therefore, empiric antibiotic coverage has broadened to include both S. aureus and multidrug-resistant pneumococcus. A consensus guideline provided recommendations for the treatment of children with severe CAP (or complicated CAP), but a paucity of strong prospective data did not support a high level of evidence to tailor treatment for hospitalized children with culture-negative CAP (Fontela et al., 2017) . Lastly, the high prevalence in CAP patients who had antibiotic exposure (53% in our cohort) prior to relevant culture samples, including blood cultures, further reduces the sensitivity of cultures for pathogen detection using conventional methods. The use of CFPNGS has helped address this issue by identifying the infectious etiology in children, even when standard microbiologic cultures are negative. However, the lack of rigorous data regarding sensitivity and specificity of CFPNGS has left clinicians with minimal information in determining who would benefit from CFPNGS. Similar to previous studies (Lin et al., 2013; Krenke et al., 2016) , we found the yield of blood cultures and pleural effusion cultures to be low, possibly secondary to antibiotic pretreatment. It is interesting to note that there was not complete concordance between CFPNGS and traditional culture/viral PCR (see Table 2 ). This is an important challenge for the application of a novel technology. Since this CFPNGS test does not detect RNA viruses, there was not concordance with CFPNGS and respiratory PCR testing. Also, local sampling in traditional ETT cultures could explain why only 1 of 3 respiratory cultures were in agreement with the CFPNGS since the respiratory sample was collected from the upper airway and may not represent infection in the lung. Based upon the detection of an organism (often Streptococcus pneumoniae) consistent with the clinical presentation and with the site of infection in an area of high blood flow (the lung) leading to increased shedding of pathogen DNA into the blood, it seems reasonable to suggest that CFPNGS may better reflect the nature of a pulmonary infection than a sample obtained from the upper airway. Further rigorous studies are required to delineate the accuracy of CFPNGS versus traditional cultures. CFPNGS may also present a challenge for infectious disease specialists as organisms that are not common pathogens, such as Parvimonas micra and Veillonella dispar, are identified in critically ill patients in combination with other potentially pathogenic bacteria or in isolation. Does this CFPNGS signal suggest co-infection, bacterial presence in another part of the body (e.g., oral flora from a patient with gingivitis), or pathogenicity that is perhaps more common than we had previously thought? As this technology becomes more broadly accepted, many of these questions will have to be carefully examined.",

First, the study is limited in scope given the small patient numbers and the uncontrolled nature of the decision to consult the infectious diseases service and to have the consultant order the CFPNGS test, although these data reflect a real-world experience. Children with CAP selected for CFPNGS evaluation represented a more severely ill patient population, as demonstrated by a high rate of PICU admission, prolonged hospitalization, and the predominance of complicated CAP with empyema and/or parapneumonic effusion. The average time to CFPNGS result was 4 days, although it is possible that this time may decrease as efficiencies in transport, processing, and analysis improve. Overall, these data suggest that CFPNGS in conjunction with standard culture techniques may significantly increase diagnostic yield and facilitate antibiotic selection in severe CAP.",
