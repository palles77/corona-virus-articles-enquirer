Transcriptome sequencing of three test groups in the grouper was performed using the Illumina MiSeq platform. The three test groups were a control group, which was injected with PBS buffer; a high-susceptible (HS) group, which died shortly after the SGIV injection; and a high-resistance (HR) group, which survived the SGIV injection. In total, 38,253 unigenes were generated. When the HS group was compared with the control group, 885 unigenes were upregulated and 487 unigenes were downregulated. When the HR and control groups were compared, 1114 unigenes were upregulated and 420 were downregulated, and when the HR and HS groups were compared, 1010 unigenes were upregulated and 375 were downregulated. In the KEGG analysis, two immune-related pathways, the p53 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor pathways, were detected with highly significant enrichment. In addition, 7465 microsatellites and 22,1569 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified from our transcriptome data. The results suggested several pathways that are associated with traits of disease susceptibility or disease resistance, and provided extensive information about novel gene sequences, gene expression profiles, and genetic markers. This may contribute to vaccine research and a breeding program against SGIV infection in grouper.",

Moreover, because of its high nutritional properties and appealing taste, the grouper possesses a high market value in China. However, in recent years, along with the fast development of intensive large-scale aquaculture, the incidence of disease outbreaks has increased dramatically. Bacterial and viral infectious diseases have caused serious damage to the grouper aquaculture industry. Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV), a novel member of the Iridovirus pathogens, can cause > 90% mortality in cultured grouper . Moreover, surviving groupers harboring these pathogens can transmit them to other fish horizontally in the same water environment, leading to more serious economic losses in grouper aquaculture. To date, the molecular mechanisms of SGIV pathogenesis and virus-host interactions are still largely unknown, which has been preventing the development of effective anti-viral strategies.",

In recent years, due to high-intensive farming and climate change, bacterial and viral infections have spread more easily and widely, especially members of the Iridoviridae. SGIV, a member of the Iridoviruses, often leads to a highly lethal and serious systemic disease in groupers, causing tremendous economic losses (Qin et al., 2001; Gibson-Kueh et al., 2003) . Therefore, an investigation on the molecular response to SGIV infection and SGIV disease-resistant is required to develop methods of prevention such as vaccines and disease-resistant breeding. In the present study, we performed a transcriptome analysis of the main immune tissue (spleen, liver, and head kidney) in control and SGIV susceptible and resistant Fig. 5 .

And it is hard to show the downregulated or upregulated information in one figure. For instance, the A gene was included in both the DEGs of CG vs HS group, and the CG vs HR group, and it was upregulated in the HS group when comparing with CG and HS, while downregulated in the HR group when comparing the CG and HR. Hence, we only show the group information of enriched DEGs with colors: Green, DGSs existing in only one pairwise comparison group; Red, DEGs existing in any two pairwise comparison groups; Yellow, DGSs existing in all three pairwise comparison groups.

We identified 38,253 unigenes and observed the DEGs related to immune responses.

The p53 pathway is an important signal pathway that regulates the growth and development of cells, and also plays a role in modulating the cell cycle, cellular senescence, and apoptosis. In the immune system, apoptosis is essential for the maintenance of homeostasis. Several studies have shown that apoptotic cell death occurs in a wide range of viral infections (Clarke and Tyler, 2009; Kinpara et al., 2013) , and this virus-induced apoptosis is thought to be related to the activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase, NF-\u03baB, and p53 pathways (Huang et al., 2011a,b; Kinpara et al., 2013) . In our previous study, we found that SGIV could induce typical apoptosis in teleost cells (Huang et al., 2011a,b) . In the present study, the p53 pathway was enriched significantly in the two SGIV challenged groups, while the c-Jun N-terminal kinase and NF-\u03baB pathways were not. We speculate that the p53 pathway may play a more important role in the SGIV-induced apoptosis than the other two pathways. However, the molecular mechanism of SGIV-induced apoptosis is still ambiguous, our DEG data associated with the p53 pathway may provide a reference for further research.",

Following antigen infection, an increase of NF-\u03baB expression may elicit an inflammatory response, while the PPARs could be responsible for regulating the host inflammatory responses and maintaining the immune homeostasis (Kelly et al., 2004) . In mammalian macrophages, a high expression level of the PPAR-\u03b3 gene was detected and its expression was dramatically upregulated during inflammatory responses and induced by IL-4 and other immune-regulatory molecules (Ricote et al., 1998a (Ricote et al., , 1998b Daynes and Jones, 2002) . Furthermore, PPAR-\u03b3 could also directly inhibit the activity of other pro-inflammatory transcription factors, such as the activator protein-1 and NF-\u03baB, in a ligand-dependent way, and thereby negatively regulate inflammatory responses (Ricote et al., 1998a (Ricote et al., , 1998b . In endothelial cells and hepatocytes, levels of inflammatory targets, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and serum amyloid A, were increased in the absence of PPAR-\u03b1, and the response to inflammatory stimuli was prolonged (Devchand et al., 1996; Ziouzenkova et al., 2003; Han et al., 2006) .

In Atlantic salmon, researchers found that the diversity of PPAR-\u03b3 alleles influenced susceptibility to disease (Sundvold et al., 2010) . In orange-spotted grouper, studies indicated that PPAR-\u03b3 transcript expression showed a significant increase following Vibrio challenge (Luo et al., 2015) . However, the potential role of teleost PPARs in the immune defense system is still not clear. The data of our study may provide references for further research of PPAR pathways in fish.",

Three transcriptome databases, a control group, and groups highly susceptible or resistant to SGIV, were obtained and analyzed. In total, 38,254 unigenes were generated. By comparing the unigene expression profile of the control group, 885 unigenes were found to be upregulated and 487 unigenes were downregulated in the HS group, and 1114 unigenes were upregulated and 420 unigenes were downregulated in the HR group. When the HR and HS groups were compared, there were 1010 upregulated and 375 downregulated genes in the HR group. In the GO enrichment analysis; the most prevalent categories of the three pairwise comparison groups were biological processes, and the top three clusters of the various categories were single-organism processes, cellular processes, and metabolic processes. In KEGG analysis, two immune-related pathways, the p53 and PPAR pathways, had highly significant enrichment. In addition, 7465 microsatellites and 72,853 candidate SNPs were identified from our transcriptome data. The results of this study suggested several pathways that were associated with traits of disease susceptibility or disease resistance, as well as offering extensive information about novel gene sequences, gene expression profiles, and genetic markers. This research may contribute to vaccine research data and to resistant breeding programs against SGIV infection in grouper.",
