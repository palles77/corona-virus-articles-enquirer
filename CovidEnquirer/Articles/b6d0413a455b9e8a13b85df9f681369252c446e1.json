            "text": "The criteria of zero Ebola cases defined by the World Health Organization did not explicitly account for the sexual transmission and led to multiple recrudescent events in West Africa from 2015 to 2016, partly indeed caused by sexual transmission from survivors. We devised a statistical model to compute the probability of the end of an Ebola virus disease epidemic, accounting for sexual transmission and underascertainment of cases. Analyzing the empirical data in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the performance of the proposed model was compared with the existing criteria comprising a fixed waiting time of 42 days since the last case testing negative or burial. We showed that the waiting time can vary depending on the sexual behaviors of survivors and their adherence to refraining from unprotected sex is likely one of the key factors in determining the absence of additional cases after declaration. If the proportional weight of sexual transmission among all secondary transmission events was substantial, ascertaining the end could even require waiting 1 year from the purported last case. While our proposed method offers an objectively interpretable probability of the end of an epidemic, it highlights that the computation requires a good knowledge of sexual contact.",

Non-specific symptoms include fever, sore throat, muscular pain and headaches, as well as gastrointestinal symptoms including vomiting and diarrhoea, and a rash. EVD has an estimated case fatality risk among confirmed cases of 60-70% ( WHO Ebola Response Team, 2014 ) . From December 2013 to March 2016, the largest ever observed Ebola epidemic occurred, with more than 28,616 confirmed, probable and suspected cases and 11,310 eventual deaths in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in West Africa ( World Health Organization (WHO), 2016a,b ). The major mode of transmission of Ebola virus is direct personal contact with blood, feces, vomit, semen or other bodily fluids. Once patients have recovered, the viral RNA is no longer detectable via ordinary blood testing, but the virus remains detectable in the semen of survivors even 9 months after the onset of illness ( Deen et al., 2017 ) . Virological and epidemiological studies demonstrated the substantial potential for sexual transmission of Ebola virus from convalescent survivors, po- * Corresponding author.",

The definition suggested waiting for 42 days, which is derived from double the observed maximum incubation period, from the time at which the last Ebola confirmed case tested negative for the second time or the time of burial. In that definition of \"zero Ebola\", the sexual transmission was not explicitly taken into account as an important factor in sustaining Ebola transmissions. After 42 days, the country was advised to maintain heightened surveillance for 90 days, anticipating recurrent cases ( WHO, 2016a ) . Declaring the end of the epidemic results in downgrading the strengthened health system which involved screening for contact tracing and the maintenance of human resources and laboratory facilities for the immediate testing of blood samples ( Elston et al., 2015; Brolin Ribacke et al., 2016 ) . International travel and trade are considerably damaged during an epidemic ( Rhymer and Speare, 2016 ; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2016 ), and thus determining the appropriate time to announce the end of an epidemic has important implications for a country's legal, economic and healthcare sectors.",

Using the computed probability, authors suggested that the objective determination of the end of a MERS outbreak was attainable if the probability yields less than the threshold value.

Lee and Nishiura (2017) systematically searched the underlying mechanisms of recrudescence, identifying that many recrudescent cases were suspected to have been caused by sexual contact with survivors, implying that accounting for sexual transmission would be essential in making policy decisions on the end of an epidemic. Because sexual transmission was later identified as the cause of recrudescent events, diagnosis of infected individuals has become more challenging than before due to its potential for discrimination ( WHO, 2016b ). Thus, not only the existence of sexual transmission but also under-ascertainment of convalescent cases are key factors in determining the end of an EVD epidemic.",

Then, the total number of ascertained cases was calculated by the sum of diagnosed cases and undiagnosed cases. We examined how influential the imperfect diagnosis would be on the declaration of the end of an epidemic by varying 100 \u00d7 q by setting 50% as the default and varying it from 10% to 90% as part of the sensitivity analysis ( Houlihan et al., 2017 ) . To examine the impact of under-ascertainment on the end of an epidemic, we recalculated the total number of cases using q and the observed epidemic curve, estimating the undiagnosed cases as (1 \u2212q )/ q times the observed epidemic curve. Although the simple use of (1 \u2212q )/ q could potentially inflate the actual number of cases, and whereas the issue could be overcome by using a latent variable model that separates the observation process from unobservable transmission process, we did not employ the latent modeling, because its explicit incorporation requires us to implement additional formulation that influences the derivation of Eq. (5) . In addition, the Eq. (5) requires the reproduction number R f as an input, but R t varies with time. We examined the impact of using different R f estimates on the probability of declaring the end of an outbreak.

We converted the risk of recrudescence into the number of Ebola deaths by assuming that one epidemic induced 10,0 0 0 deaths as approximated by the 2014-16 epidemic, and thus, 1% risk of recrudescence is assumed to be equivalent to 100 deaths. To convert the number of deaths into the number of life years lost due to Ebola, we calculated the average age of fatal cases and subtracted the average age from the life expectancy at birth.

This effect is particularly visible if the extent of sexual transmission is substantial ( Fig. 2 B , D and F). For example, in Sierra Leone, the waiting period between the last case and declaring the end of the epidemic was 28 weeks without any interventions to avoid unprotected sex (i.e., u = 0). However, this time period can be reduced by 14 weeks if 80% of people avoid risky sexual contact ( Fig. 2 E) . This indicates that the length of time that must elapse before declaring the end of an Ebola epidemic is highly dependent on sexual behavior. Fig. 3 examines the extent of the impact of under-ascertainment on the declaration of the end of an epidemic. As the extent of under-ascertainment is magnified by the factor of 0.1, 0.5 and 0.9, a country has to endure considerably longer waiting times to ensure that an epidemic is over (e.g. it was 19 weeks since the last case in Guinea with p = 0.0012 and q = 0.5, but it can vary from week 14 to 33 with q = 0.1 and 0.9). However, with an ascertainment rate of 10%, the impact was less than that observed with a weight of p = 0.1 (with 10% of secondary transmission events attributed to sexual transmission) in Fig. 2 .",

The sensitivity of the waiting time to R f varied by country due to different epidemic curves, e.g., in Liberia, there were a greater number of recent cases before the purported last case than in the other two countries, and thus, there was more variation in the week in which the end of the epidemic was declared. Fig. 4 B,D and F compare our suggested week of declaration of the end of an epidemic against those adhering to the WHO criteria for all possible opportunities for declaration. In observation, declarations of the end were made twice in Guinea and Sierra Leone and four times in Liberia. Guinea declared the end of the epidemic 6 weeks after the first purported last case being buried, and subsequently, declared 28 weeks after the first purported last case testing negative twice. Liberia declared 6, 23, 42 and 63 weeks after the first purported last case testing negative twice for all possible declarations. Sierra Leone declared in weeks 6 and 25 after the first purported last case testing negative twice. Considering Week 0 of the epidemic to have commenced on 15 September 2014, the first purported last case was buried in Week 27 in Liberia and tested negative twice in Weeks 61 and 53 in Guinea and Sierra Leone, respectively. For the first declaration in all three countries, our method proposed longer waiting periods than the 42-day wait recommended by the WHO criteria. However, during the later opportunities for declaration, our method proposed earlier declaration times than those based on the WHO criteria due to the low chance of secondary transmission.",

As long as 5% threshold was used, the ICER indicated that the proposed method is regarded as cost effective. When 1% threshold was used, and when the number of weeks was counted from the 2nd or later purposed last cases, our analysis indicated that a large cost would be required due to too conservative decision making. Fig. 6 summarizes the results from cost-effectiveness analysis. It appeared that 50% of realizations led to declaration from week 55 to 65. The cost required to save one life year was 30 0 0 US Dollars using the threshold 5%, indicating that the use of our modeling method would be regarded as cost effective, according to the standard in industrialized countries.

Motivated by a critical need to develop new science-based criteria to assist local communities with deciding when to declare the end of an epidemic, the present study employed a mathematical model ( Nishiura 2016 ) to compute the probability of the endpoint of an epidemic. In addition to comparing the modeling results with those derived from the WHO criteria, we examined how influential relatively unknown parameters are to determining the week in which the end of an epidemic can be declared.

            "text": "Our findings convey two main messages. First, the proportion of sexual transmissions among all secondary cases during the convalescent period plays a critical role in determining the risk of recrudescence of Ebola. As a result of the long persistence of the virus in semen among male survivors, we have shown that ascertaining the end of an epidemic may require up to 1 year from the purported last case. This finding should not be taken too negatively. As we have shown even with the long waiting time, refraining from unprotected sexual contact can substantially shorten the waiting time. It is striking that the adherence to refraining from unprotected sex or sexual abstinence is likely one of the key factors in determining the absence of additional cases after declaration. In future studies, the importance of sexual transmission should lead to the incorporation of heterogeneous sexual contact patterns into the modeling and decision-making process to allow for precise determination of the end of an Ebola epidemic. Moreover, despite the difficulty to statistically estimate the infectiousness during the late stage of infection ( Weitz and Dushoff, 2015 ) , an The proportion of sexual transmissions among all secondary transmissions was randomly sampled from a triangular distribution with median 0.0012 with the range from 0 to 1. A. Weeks to declare the end of Ebola epidemic since the last case testing negative twice or buried as a function of the threshold risk of observing at least 1 additional case at 5% or 1%. B.

Summary of sensitivity analyses of weeks since the last case and incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) to univariate changes in parameter values. Panels A, C and E show the timing of declaration of the end of Ebola epidemic obtained through the sensitivity analysis according to the threshold value 5% (black bar) or 1% (grey bar) in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, respectively. For each bar, single parameter is varied to take either minimum or maximum in the assumed range ( Table 1 ) . \"0.WHO\" shows the waiting time by applying the 6 weeks (42-day) criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO). \"1.base\" is our baseline combination of parameters in Table 1 . Weeks corresponding to \"2. n = 2\" represent the weeks since the secondly purported cases before second declaration ( n = 2). In addition, the proportion of sexual transmissions among all secondary cases ( p ), the mean duration of virus RNA positive period ( m ), the proportion of diagnosed cases among all cases ( q ), the proportion who refrained from unprotected sexual contact ( u ) and the reproduction number ( R f ) were varied in the shown ranges. The parameter u is also varied while p is maintained to be a large value, 0.1 in \"13. u = 0.4(0.1)\" and \"14. u = 0.8(0.1)\". Panels B, D and F show the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) calculated as US dollars per life-year in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, respectively, compared to the application of WHO criteria with the fixed 42-day waiting period. In some cases, the time at which our proposed model suggest as the end of Ebola epidemic is earlier than the waiting time adhering to the WHO (i.e. 6 weeks). In such an instance, ICER can take a negative value, and was not calculated (i.e. not calculable). explicit estimate of the proportion of sexual transmissions among all secondary cases will be called for. The evidence of additional zoonotic sources was not reported except for a single transmission from the natural reservoir by human-to-human transmission through the genetic surveillance for the sequenced 2014 samples in Sierra Leone ( Gire et al., 2014 ) . Thus, the risk of emergence from sexual contact is far greater than the baseline risk of observing Ebola virus disease in humans transmitted from animals, given an epidemic in humans.",

As the number of recent cases increases in a country, so does the time period before declaration of the end of the epidemic. Furthermore, the length of the waiting time can also vary depending on the ascertainment rate, which is seldom observable in real time.

Through random simulations, the proposed method was tightly validated. However, our study indicated that the computation of objective probability requires a good knowledge of sexual transmission. This finding underscores the need to conduct sexual behavior surveys during and after the Ebola virus disease epidemic ( Kond\u00e9 et al., 2017; Soka et al., 2016 ) . In addition to the frequency of sexual contact and the use of condoms, it should be noted that sexual partnership structures can also vary by country and could influence the end of an epidemic. This aspect needs to be explored more in future studies to attain a more precise identification of the end of an Ebola epidemic. Moreover, the proposed method can be applied to other infectious diseases by accounting for all routes of transmission. Using this approach only via a direct transmission, Nishiura and colleagues have investigated the end of an Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak in South Korea. In many infectious diseases, asymptomatic infection plays a critical role in determining the end of epidemic. For example, Zika virus infection involves 80% of asymptomatic infections ( Haby et al., 2018 ) . To objectively determine the end of outbreak, the generation time, i.e. the time from infection in a primary case to infection of the secondary case, or the serial interval needs to be mathematically derived by employing an explicitly structured mathematical model that accounts for all important routes of transmission and asymptomatic infection ( Inaba and Nishiura, 2008 ) .",

First, the extent of sexual transmission was dealt with as a constant value throughout the course of the epidemic, but it may in fact vary during this time, potentially as a result of public health interventions. Second, while our model underscored the need to explore the importance of sexual transmission, we had to discard gender information in the dataset. It may be preferable to obtain summary data detailing gender and age (to identify sexually active people) in the future. Third, implemented control measures were not taken into account. In some cases, if contact was traced, secondary cases may not easily be produced even through the sexual route. Fourth, we did not incorporate the latent case model to separate observation process from unobservable transmission dynamics model. This simplification has introduced two critical issues to our results, i.e., (i) zero observed case did not lead to non-zero actual cases by the simple use of correction factor (1 \u2212q )/ q , and (ii) potentially inflated numbers were converted to integers. However, the formulation using the latent model would require a different effort of formulation which can even change Eq. (5) , and this subject is our ongoing future study.",
