Cox proportional hazards models and inverse-weighted estimates of the probability of treatment were used to adjust for treatment selection bias. The outcomes were incident end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events, and hospitalized heart failure. Results: Of a total of 6165 patients with diabetes weaning from dialysis-requiring AKI identified, 5635 (91.4%) patients were DPP4i nonusers and 530 (8.6%) patients were DPP4i users. Compared with DPP4i nonusers, DPP4i users had a lower risk of ESRD (hazard ratio, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.70-0.94; P\u00bc.04) and allcause mortality (hazard ratio, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.23-0.34; P<.001) after adjustments for CKD, advanced CKD, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker use. In contrast, the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events and hospitalized heart failure did not differ significantly between groups. Conclusion: Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor users had a lower risk of ESRD and mortality than did nonusers among patients with diabetes after weaning from dialysis-requiring AKI. Therefore, a prospective study of AKI to CKD transitions after episodes of AKI is needed to optimally target DPP4i interventions.",

Variables used in the propensity scoreematching analysis are included in the analysis if the P value was less than .10. Then each patient was weighted by the inverse probability of receiving the treatment that they actually received; the weight was calculated on the basis of the propensity scoreematched value. Weights for DPP4i users were the inverse of the propensity score, and weights for DPP4i nonusers were the inverse of 1 e propensity score. The process of IPTW generates 2 new pseudo-cohorts. This process enabled us to preserve the sample size in the pseudo-cohorts close to the original cohorts, albeit not strictly equivalent. 17, 18 After weighting, we assessed the balance of baseline characteristics among the treatment groups by using the chi-square test for categorical variables and the Student t test for continuous variables. 19 ",

To assess the potential heterogeneity of DPP4i treatment, the DPP4i effects on all-cause mortality, ESRD, MACEs, and hospitalized heart failure (hHF) were further analyzed using the post-IPTW cohort. We formally tested the firstorder interactions using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models by entering interaction terms between DPP4i use and subgroup variables. Interactions between DPP4i use and clinically relevant variables, including other oral antidiabetic agents (ie, metformin, sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione, insulin, meglitinide, and a-glucosidase inhibitors), were tested.

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors may prevent inflammation and fibrosis of the heart and kidney by decreasing the oxidative stress response of heart and kidney tissues. 31 Experimental studies using various diabetic models suggest that incretins protect the vascular endothelium from injury by binding to glucagon-like peptide 1 receptors, thereby ameliorating oxidative stress and the local inflammatory response, which reduces albuminuria and inhibits glomerular sclerosis. 32 The renal effects of DPP4is might be explained indirectly by glucose-independent mechanisms such as an improvement in blood pressure control 33 via down-regulation of the sodium/hydrogen antiporter 3 in the proximal tubule. 34 Vildagliptin, a DPP4i, was reported to decrease apoptosis, as evidenced by a 2fold decrease in B cell lymphoma-2eassociated X protein/B cell lymphoma-2 messenger RNA expression and significantly decreased messenger RNA expression of the proinflammatory marker C-X-C motif chemokine 10 in the ischemia-reperfusion injury animal model. 35 Macrophage phenotype switching from M1 to M2 subtype facilitates renal repair after AKI. 36 In an animal study, sitagliptinmediated inhibition of early atherosclerosis was due to M2 polarization during monocyte differentiation via stromal cell-derived factor 1/C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 signaling, 37,38 which facilitated kidney repair. Renal recovery in AKI is compromised by perturbations of the cell cycle with arrest in the G2 phase and production of proinflammatory and profibrotic signals. 29 It has been suggested that DPP4is may improve oxygen supply and mitigate the inflammatory response after ischemia-reperfusion injury by improving recovery of sublethally injured cells. Furthermore, in the immune system, DPP4 acts as a marker of T-cell activation in which it functions as a costimulatory molecule. 39 Kidney injury After adjustment for age, sex, chronic kidney disease, advanced chronic kidney disease, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker use. c Hospitalization for a primary diagnosis of heart failure.",

A recent meta-analysis reported that DPP4is decreased the risk of all-cause mortality in patients with CKD. 55 Furthermore, Mogensen et al 56 illustrated a lower mortality rate in the Danish population with diabetes taking incretin-based drugs. Recent observational data also confirm that DPP4is may improve cardiac and all-cause mortality in patients with DM with hHF 57 and even in patients with preexisting heart failure. 58 We further found that DPP4is may decreased the risk of MACE-related mortality and severe sepsis (Supplemental Table 1 , available online at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org). The use of DPP4is could explain the decreased risk of mortality in our study. One study found that the use of sitagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes after recent acute MI was not associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events, 59 and another study noted that DPP4is improved long-term survival in patients with diabetes after first acute MI. 60 Diabetes and infectious causes of death are linked to inflammation, and it has become increasingly appreciated that CKD is characterized by a state of chronic inflammation. 61 There is a wealth of evidence indicating that disorders of both innate and adaptive immune systems contribute to an increased rate of infections in the course of CKD and diabetes. 62 Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibition may have pleiotropic effects, modulating the immune 64 and hepatitis C virus. 65 The DPP4i sitagliptin reduced the lipopolysaccharideinduced inflammatory response, which was mediated by the nuclear factor kB signaling pathway. Although it is an animal study, it may hint that DPP4is may have a function in cardiac remodeling attributed to sepsisinduced inflammation. 66 Although no concomitant effect on incident ESRD has been described, our study found that DPP4is combined with insulin or meglitinide therapy increased the risk of mortality in patients with diabetes after AKI. The concept is in line with the observation that meglitinide or other antidiabetic agenteinduced hypoglycemia eventually contributed to cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. 67, 68 A recent study also reported that meglitinide combined with insulin will increase hypoglycemia in patients with advanced CKD. 68 Accordingly, DPP4is will augment the long-term effects of insulin on subsequent heart failure in posteAKI-D care.",

Second, our data, derived from a current nationwide population-based cohort, enabled tracing of nearly all the AKI episodes associated with DPP4i use.

First, given the impossibility of treatment randomization in this retrospective and observational study, the influence of potential confounding factors not evaluated herein may have biased the results. For example, laboratory data (eg, hemoglobin A 1c level) were not available in the NHIRD claims data. However, we used surrogate indicators to adjust for patients' baseline diabetes severity, such as the number of outpatient visits. We further added the frequency of hemoglobin A 1c measurements to the final model and found similar results (Supplemental Result 1, available online at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org). High blood pressure is a well-known key for progression of kidney disease and death, but there were no blood pressure data in the NHIRD. We used joint modeling of multiple diseases to capture the effect of hypertension to investigate geographic variations in risk. 69 Recent studies reported that congestive heart failure, 70, 71 atrial fibrillation, 72 and peripheral artery disease 73 are highly related to hypertension and could be used as proxies for hypertension. Although we do not have any variable directly reflecting hypertension, we could assume that we have controlled the effect of hypertension because we have included the above-mentioned 3 diseases as proxies for hypertension and added them to the final model (Supplemental Result 2, available online at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org). To further avoid potential residual confounding due to inadequate adjustment for unevaluated biases, we used the IPTW model to balance every clinical characteristic between the 2 groups. In addition, we matched patients using the propensity score analysis with propensity score and reanalyzed mortality by using propensity scoreeadjusted logistic regression. Consistent with our IPTW analysis, the propensity scoreematching analysis revealed that the use of DPP4is mitigates mortality in patients with diabetes after weaning from AKI-D (Supplemental Table 2 , available online at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org).",

We categorized patients with CKD with concomitant erythropoiesis-stimulating agents prescription as those with \"advanced CKD.\" 9 More than 75% patients with advanced CKD are found to be anemic. 74 Therefore, patients with such prescription are highly likely to have advanced CKD. We adjusted preadmission CKD, advanced CKD, postdischarge CKD, and advanced CKD, and found that in patients with advanced CKD, the use of DPP4is after discharge was independently associated with decreased mortality. Most importantly, these factors exhibited a severity-dependent risk to mortality. Finally, a future study will clarify the mechanisms underlying the differences in incident ESRD for different DPP4is.
