Autologous HSCT is based on the reinjection of 93 recipients' own immune system ensuing intensive chemotherapy for diseases such as 94 multiple myeloma or aggressive lymphoma. Upon HSCT, recipients experience a phase of 95 profound immune suppression with loss of protective immunity against most infectious 96 agents followed by gradual immune recovery.[2,4] Infections are among the most frequent 97 complications after HSCT, and consequently, key players for recipients' outcome.[2] Indeed, 98 infections are the second cause of death for both autologous and allogeneic HSCT beyond 99 day 100 post-transplant.[5] Re-immunization of HSCT recipients against vaccine-preventable 100 infections is an important post-transplant intervention for reducing morbi-mortality.[6] 101 Consistently, vaccination schedules have been proposed by various expert committees, 102 based on epidemiology of vaccine-preventable diseases and the relatively few data available 103 on efficacy, safety and effectiveness of vaccines in the HSCT setting.[6-11] Studies have 104 brought evidence of immune responsiveness to vaccines after HSCT, referred to as vaccine 105 efficacy. The reference method for assessing vaccine efficacy is the measurement of serum 106 antibody titres. Nonetheless, antibody titres do not correlate accurately with clinical 107 protection, in addition to the issue of durability of protection.[12] Given the complexity and 108 heterogeneity of HSCT recipients, it is unlikely that a single biomarker is sufficient to assess 109 vaccine-induced protection. A panel of validated operational biomarkers may bring enough 110 information to achieve such a goal. Moreover, immune recovery is a highly dynamic process, is unlikely that all recipients fit into a single pattern of re-immunization. The various 112 pre-and post-transplant factors influencing immune recovery and immunization response 113 might consequently be included in more personalized post-transplant vaccination schedules. 114 Rationale. The VaccHemInf project aims to assess the efficacy of recommended vaccines in 115 adult healthy volunteers and patients undergoing autologous or allogeneic HSCT, challenging 116 the antibody titre reference method by a panel of immune functional assays measuring at 117 different time points cellular immune responsiveness to standardized antigens and vaccines. 118 Our hypothesis is that many pre-and post-transplant factors are involved in the vaccine 119 response, which may be altered durably after HSCT. Consequently, a panel of immune 120 functional assays may best predict vaccine efficacy at the individual level. 121 Objectives. We have assigned two objectives to the VaccHemInf project: (i) to assess efficacy 122 of 5 major vaccines (pneumococcus, hepatitis B virus [HBV], Haemophilus Influenzae type b, 123 tetanus and diphtheria) administrated after HSCT using the antibody titre reference method 124 in a \"real-life\" setting, in correlation with multiple variables related to haematological 125 characteristics, treatment management, pattern of post-transplant immune recovery and 126 transplant-related complications; (ii) to evaluate innovative ex vivo immune functional 127 assays testing biomarkers aiming at measuring vaccine-specific response. This part of the 128 VaccHemInf project is named FIGHT (Fonctionnalit\u00e9 Immunitaire apr\u00e8s Greffe de cellules 129 souches H\u00e9matopo\u00ef\u00e9Tiques). The FIGHT new immune biomarkers aiming at monitoring 130 vaccine efficacy have yet to be compared with the antibody titre reference assay. 131 Deliverables. The assigned agenda is to measure sequentially the functional innate and 132 adaptive immune response to 5 vaccines and to identify transplant-related factors 133 associated with low or no immunization. \"Mapping\" the recipients of HSCT on an 134 immunological scale would allow predicting vaccine efficacy, and ultimately establish a design. The VaccHemInf project is a single-centre prospective, consecutive cohort of 139 adult HSCT recipients transplanted at the Haematology department of a 5,362-bed tertiary-140 care university hospital (Lyon, France). During the past five years, the 114-bed Haematology 141 department carried out an average of 102 [range, 90-110] and 81 [range, 88-73] autologous 142 and allogeneic HSCT yearly, respectively. 143 Setting. Upon referent haematologist's agreement, eligible adult (autologous or allogeneic) 144 HSCT recipients will be referred to the vaccination centre dedicated to immunocompromised 145 patients hosted by the Infectious Diseases department of Lyon's university hospital for 146 inclusion in the VaccHemInf cohort. The recruitment period will be of 24 months and 147 recipient overall follow-up will cover a period of 48 months. For the purpose of FIGHT, 30 148",

Immune reconstitution after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) 46 is a complex and dynamic process, varying from a state of nearly complete 47 immunosuppression to an expected full immune recovery. Specific vaccination guidelines 48 recommend re-immunization after HSCT but data regarding vaccine efficacy in this unique 49 population are scarce. New immune functional assays could enable prediction of vaccine 50 response in the setting of HSCT. 51 Methods and analysis. A prospective, longitudinal single-centre cohort study of autologous 52 and allogeneic HSCT recipients was designed in order to determine the vaccine response to 5 53 vaccine targets (pneumococcus, hepatitis B virus, Haemophilus Influenzae type b, tetanus 54 and diphtheria) and to correlate it to immune function parameters. A workflow was set up 55 to study serological response to vaccines and to describe the functional immune status of 56 100 HSCT recipients (50 autologous and 50 allogeneic) before and 3, 12 and 24 months after 57 primary immunization. At each time point, 'basic' immune status recording (serology, 58 immunophenotyping of lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry) will be assessed. The 59 immune response will furthermore be evaluated before and 3 months after primary 60 vaccination by two ex vivo immune functional assays assessing: (i) tumor necrosis factor 61 alpha, interferon gamma production and host mRNA expression upon whole-blood 62 stimulation by lipopolysaccharide or Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B; and (ii) T 63 lymphocyte proliferation in response to a standard mitogen (phytohaemagglutinin) or to 64 recall antigens. Reference intervals will be determined from a cohort of 30 healthy 65 volunteers. This translational study will provide data describing vaccine response, immune 66 functionality of HSCT recipients over time and will allow mapping HSCT recipients with 67 regard to their immune function.",

Nonetheless, antibody titres do not correlate accurately with 112 clinical protection, in addition to the issue of durability of protection.[14] Given the 113 complexity and heterogeneity of HSCT recipients, it is unlikely that a single biomarker is 114 sufficient to assess vaccine-induced protection. A panel of validated operational biomarkers 115 may bring enough information to achieve such a goal. Moreover, immune recovery is a 116 highly dynamic process, and it is unlikely that all recipients fit into a single pattern of re-117 immunization: on the one hand, some HSCT recipients, according to their functional immune 118 status, might require delayed initiation of their re-immunization schedule and/or higher 119 amounts of vaccine antigens (i.e. multiple vaccine doses) to improve response to 120 vaccination. On the other hand, some HSCT recipients with rapid and good-quality immune 121 reconstitution might benefit from an earlier implementation of the vaccination schedule. 122 The various pre-and post-transplant factors influencing immune recovery and immunization 123 response might consequently be included in more personalized post-transplant vaccination 124 schedules. 125 Rationale. The VaccHemInf project aims to assess the efficacy of recommended vaccines in 126 adult healthy volunteers and patients undergoing autologous or allogeneic HSCT, challenging 127 the antibody titre reference method by a panel of immune functional assays measuring at 128 different time points cellular immune responsiveness to standardized antigens and vaccines. 129 Our hypothesis is that many pre-and post-transplant factors are involved in the vaccine 130 response, which may be altered durably after HSCT. Consequently, a panel of immune 131 functional assays may best predict vaccine efficacy at the individual level.132 Objectives. We have assigned two objectives to the VaccHemInf project: (i) to assess efficacy 133 of 5 major vaccines (pneumococcus, hepatitis B virus [HBV], Haemophilus Influenzae type b,",

The VaccHemInf project is a single-centre prospective, consecutive cohort of 150 adult HSCT recipients transplanted at the Haematology department of a 5,362-bed tertiary-151 care university hospital (Lyon, France). During the past five years, the 114-bed Haematology 152 department carried out an average of 102 [range, 90-110] and 81 [range, 88-73] autologous 153 and allogeneic HSCT yearly, respectively. 154 Setting. Upon referent haematologist's agreement, eligible adult (autologous or allogeneic) 155 HSCT recipients will be referred to the vaccination centre dedicated to immunocompromised 156 patients hosted by the Infectious Diseases department of Lyon's university hospital for 157 inclusion in the VaccHemInf cohort. The recruitment period will be of 24 months and 158 recipient overall follow-up will cover a period of 48 months.

The Milieu Interieur consortium has set up preliminary reference 357 ranges of a healthy immune response and its natural variance.[41] Similarly, in order to map 358 the immune disorders, the 30 healthy donors of the VaccHemInf study will provide a 359 reference panel essential for the evaluation of the \"in-range\" or \"out-range\" scale.
