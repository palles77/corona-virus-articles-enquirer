To examine the seriousness of the high-density problem, this study aims to survey the health and safety performance of apartment buildings in a densely populated city, Hong Kong, using a simplified assessment scheme. An assessment scheme based on a hierarchy of building performance indicators concerning the quality of: (a) architectural design, (b) building services design, (c) the surrounding environment, (d) operations and maintenance, and (e) management approaches was developed. One hundred forty (140) apartment buildings were surveyed and assessed through site inspections, desk searches, and interviews. A performance analysis was conducted to examine and compare the overall health and safety performance of the buildings. We found that there were considerable variations in health and safety conditions across buildings, even though they are located within a single district. Most of the variations in building health and safety conditions were attributed to differences in building management systems rather than building design. Enhancing strategic management approaches (e.g. a better delineation of owners' rights and duties) appears to be the most critical factor that underperformers should consider in order to improve their buildings.",

To accommodate this huge population in such a tiny place, a highly compact living environment characterized by high-rise apartment buildings has resulted. Recently, with the removal of airport height restrictions in urban areas, residential buildings have been built taller than ever before. It is very common to find new residential buildings that are over 50 storeys. 1 While this gives Hong Kong a unique skyscraper identity, such a compact environment poses important questions for the concept of sustainability, in particular for the objective of promoting the social, economic, and environmental quality of human settlement development in Agenda 21 of the United Nations.",

With regard to environmental protection, this can also help reduce urban sprawl and enhance land use efficiency. However, on the negative side, a high-density setting presents a serious threat to the health and safety status of residents. Gove et al. [1] showed that overcrowding has led not only to social incoherence, but also to mental and physical health problems. The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 also made the public aware of the vulnerability of densely populated areas to communicable diseases [2] . Apart from health problems, older apartment buildings often lack proper building management and maintenance, possibly due to fragmented ownership and a lack of resources [3] . This poses tremendous safety hazards (e.g. fire and falling objects) to residents and passersby.",

Health and safety were chosen as our focus because they are the most fundamental aspects that a dwelling should fulfil, and yet they usually cannot be easily observed and evaluated by occupants and the public. 2 Moreover, health and safety problems have a stronger spillover effect in a high-density setting than a low-density one-a building with poor health and safety conditions not only adversely affects its own occupants, but also jeopardizes those living and working in the neighborhood. 3 Our study, therefore, contributes to the revelation of hidden building information to the community, which, in turn, helps build a more sustainable city. Utilizing Ho et al.'s [5] simple assessment framework, we surveyed 140 buildings within a short period of time at a relatively low cost. We also extended Ho et al.'s [5] health assessment framework to building safety. 4 To make the survey results more comprehensible to the public, we translated technical performance details into indices (e.g. a health index and a safety index) for building classification. 5 With these indices, the public and building owners can easily know the health and safety performance of buildings.",

Bearing this in mind, we based the principles of our survey design on the assessment model proposed by Ho et al. [5] , which is simple, and yet theoretically sound.

First, the items to be surveyed should be flexible enough to embrace most settings of private apartment buildings in a city (e.g. buildings of different designs). Second, for the sake of practicality, the items to be surveyed should be easily obtainable. Site inspections were confined to common areas and the external environment to where assessors could have access. These common areas are usually the most problematic in terms of management and maintenance due to the co-ownership nature of these areas [9] . As for the interior of individual dwelling units, the assessments were based largely on the information available in floor layout plans. Third, only measurable and verifiable items would be assessed, while subjective items should be avoided as much as possible. If subjective judgment (e.g. hygienic condition and visual structural condition) was unavoidable, assessors would be given clear guidelines, with judgments referenced to sample photos of different grades or scores to ensure consistency.",

These factors should be dealt with in the design stage.

All participants were allowed to ask questions to iron out any ambiguities. This procedure was indispensable, as respondents should have a common understanding of the questions before the results could be analyzed in a meaningful way. The respondents' weightings of the different factors were extracted from a pairwise comparison of the relative importance of all pairs of factors at the same level as the hierarchy (as shown in Table 1 ) using the AHP computer package Expert Choice 2000, second edition.

After this interactive interview process, if a respondent's answers still failed to reach the consistency ratio suggested by Saaty, his/her responses would be discarded from the respective level in the hierarchy. Despite the high cost associated with this method of information collection, it greatly improved the reliability of the factor weightings, which is one of the most crucial aspects of the assessment framework.

The best practice is determined with reference to the highest standards available now or in the near future, including those recommended by the government, professional institutes, and relevant international guidelines. For example, while there is no statutory requirement for building owners in Hong Kong to carry out regular fire drills, the Fire Services Department and Home Affairs Department advise them to conduct fire drills at least once a year. Such a recommendation constitutes a best practice, the fulfillment of which will be rewarded with a rating of 1 in the respective building factor. The rating of intermediate cases is made by linear interpolation. Take the headroom of a flat (a building factor under architecture) as an example. The rating is zero if headroom is below 2.5 m, which is the minimum required by the current regulation. Headroom above 3.1 m is the best scenario with a rating equal to one.

An on-site assessment starts with an initial quick inspection of a building's exterior prior to the internal inspection of the building. This sequence was justified by Hoxley [13] , who stressed that anything missed during the initial inspection of the exterior could be re-inspected relatively easily, but it may not be so easy to re-inspect the interior when any problem is raised during the subsequent external inspection.

Non-intrusive tests, such as hammer tapping, were conducted to aid in the identification of defects during the course of inspection. After the internal building inspection, they walked around the building's podium, if any, and surveyed the external facades of the building at safe and accessible positions. With the aid of binoculars, 6 the assessors scanned through each building elevation carefully, covering every square metre. Finally, the commercial portion, external works, and surroundings of the building were evaluated, with particular attention being paid to the existence of special hazards to residents.",

In this survey, we shortlisted buildings from the Yau Ma Tei-Tsim Sha Tsui-Mongkok District (YTM), which is located on the southern part of the Kowloon Peninsula. The reasons for choosing YTM were twofold. First, building plans in YTM are more readily available than those in other districts due to the recent digitalization of the building plans by the government. Second, there is a wide variety of residential buildings in YTM (e.g. post-war traditional Chinese lowrise buildings, single block buildings in congested sites, buildings with very large footprint areas, and relatively new building developments). Such a wide range of building types, ages, and management structures enabled us to obtain a diversified sample to carry out further analysis.",

Then, buildings were sampled from each zone according to development scale, building age, and management structure. This reduced potential bias towards a particular type of building. For housing estates that consist of multiple identical blocks of buildings, only one building from each estate was sampled for assessment because building performance within an estate should be very similar in terms of its design and management.

The median BHHI and BSCI scores were 44% and 56%, respectively. 8 Specifically, the BHHI ranged from 24% to 60%, whereas the BSCI ranged from 35% to 74%. Since the indices are building-specific, the health/safety performance of one building can be compared to the others. A practical use of these results is to let stakeholders know whether a building outperforms or underperforms the median building in the sample. Homebuyers can use the information to ascertain how good a building performs before they make their decisions. It is likely that property values will be affected after the publication of the BHHI and BSCI. Building owners can also make use of the performance information to facilitate their maintenance or refurbishment decisions. In multi-ownership apartment buildings, one of the key obstacles in reaching collective decisions to carry out improvement works is that owners have different, if not conflicting, views on whether or not to make improvements. Sometimes, even though a building is obviously dilapidated, some owners may still not wish to face up to ''reality'' and commit to changes. If the BHHI and BSCI results indicated that the performance of their buildings lags behind that of similar buildings, their intolerant attitudes may change, as they do not want to be losers in the value league. The weighted arithmetic mean was adopted to combine individual ratings into a single index because it is the most commonly used functional form for score aggregation in building performance assessment schemes. This form is predominately used in most of the pronounced schemes, such as the building research establishment environmental assessment method, the leadership in energy and environmental design and GBTool. Although So and Wong [14] counter-proposed using the weighted geometric mean for index aggregation, their viewpoints were not substantiated, neither theoretically nor empirically. 8 Note that the BHHI and BSCI have different objectives (i.e., health and safety), so their scores should not be compared.",

Fig. 4 summarized the results in Venn diagrams. We see that 82% of variations in the BHHI are purely attributable to management factors, suggesting that management factors dominate design factors in differentiating healthy buildings from the relatively less healthy ones. Variations due to their co-movements were very low and insignificant, only, 4%. For the BSCI, pure design factors contributed 18% to the total variation, while pure management factors contributed 45%. Similar to its health counterpart, pure management factors are more influential than pure design factors in affecting the variations in safety performance. In other words, most of the variations in building health and safety conditions were attributed to differences in building management rather than building design. This should be encouraging to owners of underperforming buildings because management factors are alterable during the occupancy stage, and they can improve health and safety performance by enhancing management. However, as opposed to the BHHI's results, the co-movement of design and management factors occupies quite a significant share, being responsible for 37% of the variations in the BSCI. A possible reason for such a strong co-movement is that design and management factors are driven by some common factors, notably building age. 10 Further insight can be gained by looking at the results of Level 2 categories using radar diagrams, which allows for a performance comparison to be made for each category across different buildings. In Fig. 5 , the best, average, and worst scenarios for architecture, building services, external environment, operations and maintenance, and management approaches are shown. The spread of performance in management approaches is the largest among all categorical scores for both the BHHI (from 0% to 100%) and BSCI (from 0% to 66%). This suggested that enhancing management approaches, such as delineating owners' duties, implementing facility management practices, and enhancing the level of emergency preparedness, is the most critical item that underperformers should consider in order to improve their buildings. The differences in performance of other Level 2 categories can be observed similarly for the BHHI and BSCI, respectively. For instance, there are also considerable spreads in the performance of building services (2267% for the BHHI; 26280% for BSCI) and operation and maintenance (5266%; 29292% for BSCI), while architecture and external environment have the smallest spreads, as the sampled buildings are situated in a small geographical area.",

We found that most of the variations in building health and safety conditions were attributed to differences in building management systems rather than building designs.

It is envisaged that further research can be conducted to investigate the relationship between building performance and extraneous factors, such as building age, management structure, and scale of development. Although the assessment scheme is currently designed for apartment buildings in Hong Kong, it can be easily modified and adapted to suit the technological, cultural, and social settings of other places. 10 Generally speaking, an older building is poorer in structural and other physical conditions due to the natural deterioration of the building's fabrics and services, so a lower management score resulted. On the other hand, the design component also tends to be age-related because the regulatory requirements are upgrades over time and the awarding of a lower design score to these buildings.",
