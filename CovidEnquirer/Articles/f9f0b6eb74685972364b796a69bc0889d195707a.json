Coronavirus envelope spike protein S is a class I viral fusion protein which is characterized by the existence of two heptad repeat regions (HR1 and HR2) (forming a complex called fusion core). Here we report that by using in vitro bio-engineering techniques, SARS-CoV HR1 and HR2 bind to each other and form a typical 6-helix bundle. The HR2, either as a synthetic peptide or as a GSTfusion polypeptide, is a potent inhibitor of virus entry. The results do show that SARS-CoV follows the general fusion mechanism of class I viruses and this lays the ground for identification of virus fusion/entry inhibitors for this devastating emerging virus.",

            "text": "It is generally believed that the envelope protein undergoes a series of conformational changes during the virus fusion process [13, [20] [21] [22] . The HR1 and HR2 regions are believed to be important modules/domains in this process and show different conformations in different fusion states [13] . Under the current model, there are at least three conformational states of the envelope fusion protein [13] . They are pre-fusion native state, prehairpin intermediate state, and post-fusion hairpin state. During these state transitions, the HR1 and HR2 are exposed in an intermediate conformational state but bind to each other to form coiled coil structure in an anti-parallel mode in the post-fusion state. Therefore, the in vitro introduced HR peptides compete with the endogenous HR counterparts in the intermediate state, preventing the transition into the formation of HR1/ HR2 coiled coil bundle, the post-fusion state [13] . This coiled coil bundle conformation is believed to be important for bringing two lipid membranes (cellular and viral) into proximity with each other allowing the membrane fusion for virus entry. Membrane fusion is the key step for enveloped virus infection. The HR1/ HR2 coiled coil bundle is called the virus fusion core [13] . In this structure, as shown by several crystal structures of fusion cores, including HIV, hRSV, influenza virus A, and Ebola virus [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] , three HR1 bind each other to form a trimeric core whereas three HR2 surround this core. As both HR1 and HR2 are structurally a helical in this fusion core, this structure is also called 6-helix coiled coil bundle [13] .",

The HR1 was expressed as an N-terminal his-tagged protein As the basic amino acid cluster required for S1/S2 cleavage is not present it is unlikely that SARS-CoV S protein would be processed further into S1 and S2. However, the positions of the putative S1 and S2 are indicated for the convenience to compare with other coronaviruses. \"SS\" represents signal sequence and \"TM\" for transmembrane domain. In the lower panel, likelihood of HR1 and HR2 predicted by LearnCoil-VMF program [30] is shown. in pET30a vector (Novagen) and HR2 (two versions) was expressed as a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion protein.

As our previous work has shown that the extra amino acids in the 30a expressed protein in hRSV had no effect on the binding to HR2 [31] we carried out all the binding experiments with this 30a-HR1 preparation. GST-removed HR2-38 and HR2-44 were both soluble proteins in PBS. When equal molars of 30a-HR1 and HR2-38 were mixed a unique complex peak could be detected by gel filtration and the peak molecular weight was estimated approximately as 60 kDa (Fig. 2A) . Both 30a-HR1and HR2 were detected in the peak on SDS-PAGE ( Fig. 2A) . This matches the calculation of 3\u00c2 30a-HR1 and 3\u00c2 HR2-38, implying the formation of 6-helix bundle complex. We also tested the GST pull-down experiments and showed the tight binding of 30a-HR1 to GST-HR2-38 (data not shown).",

Despite our extensive experiments, using both the synthetic and bio-engineered HR1s, we did not see any virus-infection inhibition effect from HR1 (data not shown). This might reflect the difference between HR1 and HR2 in the virus entry inhibition as observed in some paramyxoviruses [31, 32, [34] [35] [36] . The mechanism underlying this difference needs to be further investigated in the future. It is noteworthy that, in a recent study on MHV, only HR2 inhibition has been observed [12] .",

In this study, we have shown that the putative HR1 and HR2 of SARS-CoV bind to each other and form a 6-a-helix bundle (trimer of HR1/HR2 dimer), a characteristics of class I viral fusion proteins. The importance of the HR regions in MHV fusion has been demonstrated with site-directed mutagenesis study by Luo and Weiss [10, 11] . As the receptor for SARS-CoV has been identified recently [37] , receptor-induced conformational changes of S protein should be pursued in the near future, esp. the conformations of HR1 and HR2 fusion core in different stages during the fusion process.",

This and our present result on SARS virus are the first evidence for a 6-helix bundle formation of HR1 and HR2 and the HR2 fusion inhibitor derived from Family Coronaviridae, implying that coronavirus adopts a similar fusion or entry mechanism to other RNA viruses [13] . Taking the fact into account that SARS is an acute disease, this kind of peptide inhibitors might act better than that in chronic infection HIV because the therapeutic peptide can be used through intranasal route. The conformational changes of the S protein are very likely to be crucial for coronavirus entry [20] [21] [22] and so this provides a most plausible target for drug design. The strong inhibition of the peptide in the GST (25 kDa) fusion form indicates that there is significant space for HR2 to interact with HR1 in the intermediate state of the S protein during the process of virus fusion. This has also been observed in our previous work on Newcastle disease virus and hRSV, members of Family Paramyxoviridae [31, 32] . Our results do provide a drug lead for SARS-CoV and its potential clinical application should be rigorously pursued in the near future. A clear crystal structure of this fusion core of SARS-CoV would also make a great deal of contribution to our understanding of coronavirus fusion and fusion inhibitor discovery.",
