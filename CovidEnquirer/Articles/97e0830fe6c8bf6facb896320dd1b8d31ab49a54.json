The spread of this novel virus can eventually become an international emergency. During the early outbreak phase in Wuhan, one of the most important public health tasks is to prevent the spread of the virus to other cities. Therefore, full-scale border control measures to prevent the spread of virus have been discussed in many nearby countries. At the same time, lockdown in Wuhan cityu (border control from leaving out) has been imposed. The challenge is that many people have traveled from Wuhan to other cities before the border control. Thus, it is difficult to forecast the number of imported cases at different cities and estimate their risk on outbreak emergence.",

During the early phase of the outbreak, it poses a severe threat to many other regions due to frequent transportation services linking Wuhan to the other cities. About 2 weeks later after 31 December, using the number of cases detected outside China, it has been inferred that more than a thousand individuals (with an estimated mean 1723) had had an onset of symptoms by January 12, 2020 [6] . This number, which was estimated based on certain assumptions, was about 40 times higher than the reported number by January 12, 2020 . Given that most of the members of the coronavirus family cause mild flu-like symptoms during infection and most people have not yet received nation-wide alert about the novel virus during that period, it could be possible that the confirmed case number among actual infected cases is very low, probably similar to influenza reporting rate, which is only about 1% [7] .",

If outbreaks also occur in other cities, the prevention of nCoV becomes even more difficult in China or at the global level. From disease control perspective, the major questions here are whether we can i) estimate the waiting time for nCoV to spread to other cities in China; and ii) evaluate the impacts of disease control by cessation of population movement (e.g., lockdown measures) on the outbreak spreading. The importance of prediction of infectious diseases based on transportation network information has already been highlighted previously [8, 9] . Studies have been done to estimate the probability of emergence and the arrival time of the emergence [10] . In addition, the required condition for a virus to spread to other cities is through secondary infections from the imported cases. In our study, imported case was defined as an infected individual migrating from other cities to a particular city. In order to evaluate the infectious disease control measures during the spreading of the virus, it is important to know how many secondary cases has been caused by the imported cases. Thus, there is a need to estimate the probability of emergence and the arrival time of the emergence through estimating the number of secondary infections caused from imported cases using transportation data.",

During the early stage of the outbreak without any control measures (no mask wearing, isolation, or contact tracing, etc.), the cumulative number of secondary infections generated by imported cases through transportation was estimated ( Figure 1A) . We obtain the critical threshold number of cases = 7.27 in a city, representing the outbreak will occur with 50% chance if the cumulative number of secondary infections is over that critical value.

Ideally, complete cessation of population movement between cities or isolation of every susceptible case from the source city can reduce transmission events. . We can thus recalculate the cumulative number of secondary infections under different levels of border control. To achieve the gain time of control for transportation of a particular city, we calculate critical time given the control such that the cumulative number of secondary cases generated by the imported cases is greater than critical threshold number . Finally, subtraction of the critical time without control from the critical time with control returns gain of the control system. To make an extra 30 days gain, under the low \" (1.4), the control measures have to reduce 87% of the secondary infections generated by the imported cases ( Figure 6A ). Under the higher \" (2.92), the effect on reducing the chance of outbreak emergence is low until the border control can reduce more than 95% of the secondary infections ( Figure 6B ). Under the mild \" condition, we set \" = 1.68 with generation time 8.4 days, and found that the border control effect is similar but a little bit weaker than that in the lower \" scenario. This allows us to calculate how much extra time a connected region through mobility can gain and gives an indicator what scale of border control is necessary.

Since \" is not known, and can be different using different approaches [16] , here we use \" = 1.4 for Wuhan and we set \" for other locations a low number 1.1. This number was used because the nation-wide alert has already been received at different cities after 31 December, 2019. The control measures and self awareness make the initial infection to occur less easily. We have learnt from the previous SARS outbreak that it is crucial to implement rapid infection control measures to limit the impact of epidemics, both in terms of preventing more casualties and shortening of the epidemic period. The other important lesson is that a timely public alert against a new spreading epidemic is also most essential [17] .",

They strongly recommend to strengthen cross-boarder screening system to prevent infectious disease outbreak due to imported cases as China has increased number of imported cases over the years. Besides, [19] studied the effectiveness of border screening for influenza detection among airline passengers in New Zealand. Here the model we constructed is easy to understand and simple to use when transportation data is available. The framework can be extended to multiple infected sources to one single target city. Hence, the model proposed in the current study could help to prevent infectious diseases caused by imported cases from different parts of China moving to neighbouring territories and countries including Hong Kong, Taiwan, Vietnam and so on.",

However, the effect is difficult to measure given that it is not easy to make a comparative study. But a lesson we learnt from the previous SARS outbreak is that it is crucial to estimate the transmission potential of a new emerging disease as soon as possible and to establish whether additional, more stringent control measures are required [17] . Recent studies have shown the importance of modeling in infectious disease control [20] . We have evaluated the impact of these control measures under different levels of infectious disease control scenarios. To make an extra 30 days gain, the control measures have to reduce 87% of secondary infections generated by the imported cases. This gives an indicator whether certain control or prevention measures, such as wearing masks, quarantine, etc., are necessary.",
