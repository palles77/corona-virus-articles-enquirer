            "text": "To solve some complicated function optimization problems, an artificial infectious disease optimization algorithm based on the SEIQR epidemic model is constructed, it is called as the SEIQR algorithm, or SEIQRA in short. The algorithm supposes that some human individuals exist in an ecosystem; each individual is characterized by a number of features; an infectious disease (SARS) exists in the ecosystem and spreads among individuals, the disease attacks only a part of features of an individual. Each infected individual may pass through such states as susceptibility (S), exposure (E), infection (I), quarantine (Q) and recovery (R). State S, E, I, Q and R can automatically and dynamically divide all people in the ecosystem into five classes, it provides the diversity for SEIQRA; that people can be attacked by the infectious disease and then transfer it to other people can cause information exchange among people, information exchange can make a person to transit from one state to another; state transitions can be transformed into operators of SEIQRA; the algorithm has 13 legal state transitions, which corresponds to 13 operators; the transmission rules of the infectious disease among people is just the logic to control state transitions of individuals among S, E, I, Q and R, it is just the synergy of SEIQRA, the synergy can be transformed into the logic structure of the algorithm. The 13 operators in the algorithm provide a native opportunity to integrate many operations with different purposes; these operations include average, differential, expansion, chevy, reflection and crossover. The 13 operators are executed equi-probably; a stable heart rhythm of the algorithm is realized. Because the infectious disease can only attack a small part of organs of a person when it spreads among people, the part variables iteration strategy (PVI) can be ingeniously applied, thus enabling the algorithm to possess of high performance of computation, high suitability for solving some kinds of complicated optimization problems, especially high dimensional optimization problems. Results show that SEIQRA has characteristics of strong search capability and global convergence, and has a high convergence speed for some complicated functions optimization problems.",

Usually susceptible individuals can be infected with infectious diseases by directly contacting with infected individuals, body fluids and excreta of infected individuals, or materials polluted by infected individuals; infectious diseases can spread through air, water, food, skin contact, soil, blood, and etc [1] . In nature, there exist a large number of infectious viruses, humans, animals and plants are subjected to their threat all the time. Behind almost every infectious disease, a sad story is always implied. Ebola, outbreak in early 2014, and still raging in Africa, has made thousands of Africans died [2] [3] [4] ; in early 2002, outbreak of SARS had made tens of thousands of Chinese people died, more Chinese people disabled [5] [6] [7] [8] ; H7N9 [9] [10] [11] [12] or H5N6 [13] [14] , which visits southern regions of China every year, makes a lot of poultry slaughtered.",

Because only a small part of variables of an alternative solution during iteration take part in computation, a populationbased intelligence algorithm applying PVI may consume a little of CPU time, its efficiency of computation may be high comparatively, consequently it is suitable to solve some high dimensional optimization problems.",

Individuals in the SEIQR epidemic model are automatically and dynamically divided into 5 classes, namely class S, E, I, Q and R, individuals in each class can be considered into a subclass of population, and then diversity is realized naturally. (4) Evolution. Each individual in the ecosystem has instincts to survive, which makes itself to grow better or become stronger. (5) Integration. There are 13 operators in the proposed algorithm, thus it provides a good opportunity to integrate some cores of some optimization algorithms together. (6) Heart rhythm. 13 legal state transitions can lead the corresponding 13 operators to execute equi-probably; the curve of a state transition is very similar to that of a person's heart rhythm.

            "text": "To make clear that the setting of parameters in SEIQRA gives influence on its evolving process when it solves the Bump and Michalewicz function, a deep investigation is made into the important parameters such as L, E 0 , N, T, \u03c4 and \u03bb. Table 6 describes the relationship among average best objective function value, parameter L and average CPU time; Fig. 6 shows that relation of objective function value with CPU time when L takes different values. Table 6 and Fig. 6 show that when L is valued differently, for the Bump function there is little difference in CPU time, for the Michalewicz function there is great difference in CPU time for some Ls; but when L 41, there is little difference in precision of average optimum objective function values. Therefore, for SEIQRA, L \u00bc2-10 is more appropriate, we suggest L \u00bc6 is the best setting based on comprehensive consideration of precision of objective function value and CPU time. Table 7 describes the relationship among parameter E 0 , average best objective function value and average CPU time. It shows that for the Bump function, when E 0 \u00bc0.008-0.2, the precision is relatively high, but CPU time increases moderately; when E 0 40.2, CPU time varies greatly, but the precision decreases greatly also; especially when E 0 \u00bc1, it is unable to obtain the optimum solution; for the Michalewicz function, when E 0 \u00bc0.001-0.1, the precision is relatively high, but CPU time varies greatly; when E 0 40.1, CPU time varies greatly, but the precision decreases greatly also; especially when E 0 \u00bc1, it is unable to obtain the optimum solution. Therefore, when E 0 \u00bc0.008-0.1, SEIQRA performs best. When E 0 \u00bc0.008-0.1, it means that there are at most only 0.8%-10% variables to be involved in computation, but the CPU time consumed by SEIQRA is lower than that when E 0 takes other values, 7 , which is logarithmic scales on vertical and horizontal axis, shows the relation of IPI (objective function value can be transformed into IPI value with formula (13)) with CPU time when E 0 takes different values. From Fig. 7 we can see that when E 0 increases from 0.0001 to 1, the ascending rate of IPI value, which corresponds to the descending rate of objective function value, increases greatly, but the precision of objective function value decreases moderately; from which we can find that the most suitable value for E 0 is E 0 \u00bc0.06. Table 8 describes the relation among parameter N, average best objective function value and average CPU time consumed by SEIQRA; Fig. 8 shows the relation of objective function value with CPU time when N takes different values. From Table 8 and Fig. 8 , we can see that for average objective function value, when N increases, the precision of the average objective function value increases a little; for average CPU time, when N increases, the average CPU time increases greatly. Therefore, N \u00bc 150-350 is the most suitable setting, we suggest N \u00bc200 is the suitable setting based on comprehensive consideration of precision of objective function value and CPU time.",

From Tables 9-11 and Figs. 9-11 we can see that for different vaccination cycles, latency periods and immunity periods, average objective function value and average CPU Time do not change greatly.

In order to increase precision of optimal objective function value, each setting of parameters should be made reasonably and allow SEIQRA to run many times. Table 12 shows that relation among n (the number of variables of optimization problem (1)), average best objective function value and average CPU time. From Table 12 we can see that when n increases, the consumed CPU time increases greatly, but the precision of objective function value decreases a little also. Fig. 12 describes the convergence graphs when n takes different values.

With the help of the famous statistical Table 20 , where hvalue \u00bc 1 indicates that the performances of SEIQRA is statistically different with 99% certainty, h-value \u00bc \u00c01 represents that the compared algorithm are significantly better than SEIQRA, and hvalue \u00bc0 denotes that the results of the two considered algorithms are not significantly different.

Fig. 19 illustrates a comparison of the convergence rate between \"REINIT is not invoked\" and \"REINIT is invoked\" when SEIQRA solves basic benchmark function F3. From Fig. 19 we can see that the convergence rate when REINIT is not invoked is faster than that when REINIT is invoked; as time lapses, triggering of REINIT become more and more frequent, much time is consumed for triggering REINIT. Conclusively, REINIT has two effects of the pros and cons, it can enhance the exploration and exploitation ability of SEIQRA, but it may consume much CPU time. Therefore, we suggest that if an optimization problem can be solved without REINIT, REINIT should be prohibited; if sticky states always occur when SEIQRA solves an optimization problem, REINIT should be invoked.",

Wide adaptability: if an operator can solve one type of optimization problems, then synergy of many operators can solve many types of optimization problems. Because SEIQRA has 13 operators, it has wider adaptability to solve different types of optimization problems. 4. A small part of variables being involved in each iteration: Since a virus attacks only a small part of individual features every time, when individuals in different states exchange their feature information, there is just a small portion of features used in computation, even so, the individual's IPI can still be well improved. Owing to the substantial reduction of features in calculation, when solving complicated optimization problems, especially high-dimensional optimization problems, SEIQRA can converge significantly and rapidly. 5. The stable setting of parameters: Although SEIQRA uses more parameters to control its running, the setting of its parameters is stable. 6. Multiple operations: Because SEIQRA possesses of 13 operators, it provides opportunities to contain many operations simultaneously. 7.

It shows that triggered times of these state transitions vary stochastically with time, but the average triggered times are stable for each state transition because the average triggered times approximate to level for all state transitions. Because each state transition corresponds to an operator, these ecological operators are triggered evenly.(2) The heart rhythm of SEIQRA. SEIQRA possesses of 5 states which divide a population into 5 classes dynamically and automatically. The number of individuals in each class varies with time. The dynamic change of the number of individuals in 5 classes can be thought as the heart beating of SEIQRA, or the heart rhythm of SEIQRA.Fig. 14describes that the relationship of the number of individuals staying at state S, E, I, Q and R with CPU time when SEIQRA solves F1. It shows that the number of individuals staying at state S, E, I, Q and R vary stochastically with time, but the average number of individuals staying at each state is also stable because the average number of individuals staying at each state approximates to level.Conclusively, the stability of the heart rhythm of SEIQRA can result in equi-probably triggering of the ecological operators S-S, S-E, S-R, E-E, E-I, E-R, I-I, I-Q, I-R, Q-Q, Q-R, R-R and R-S, because each state transition is equivalent to a triggering of the corresponding operator.",
