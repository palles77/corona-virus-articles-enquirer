PURPOSE: To investigate the ocular manifestations of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and to monitor the possible ocular complications arising from the treatment regimen with high-dose systemic corticosteroid drugs. DESIGN: Prospective, observational cohort case series. METHODS: Ninety eyes from 45 patients with the diagnosis of SARS during an epidemic outbreak in Hong Kong were analyzed. Relevant medical and ophthalmic histories were taken. Ophthalmic examinations, including best-corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, slitlamp, and indirect ophthalmoscopy examination, were performed at baseline and at 2-month and 3-month follow-up. SETTING: Faculty practice in university hospital. RESULTS: Only two patients had mild elevated intraocular pressure at baseline and at subsequent follow-up. There was no loss of visual acuity, cataract progression, or increased cup-disk ratio. Fundus examinations were unremarkable in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our study did not demonstrate any ocular manifestations in patients with SARS. The treatment regimen of high-dose corticosteroid also did not show any significant ocular complications. Routine ocular screening of patients with SARS for diagnosis or for complications might not be indicated. (Am J Ophthalmol 2004; 137:773-774.",

No significant elevation in IOP or other corticosteroid-related ocular complications was observed in the short-term follow-up. Coronavirus-associated atypical pneumonia is extremely infectious, and the transmission appears to be through direct contact or contact with respiratory droplets in close vicinity to an infected person. Health care workers are particularly at risk for infection, as reflected by the numbers of those involved. Among the total number of 8,422 cases worldwide, 1,725 (20%) were health care workers. 2 With the unremarkable ophthalmologic findings of this study, routine ocular screening in patients with SARS for diagnosis or for complications may not be worthwhile. P ATIENTS WITH DISORDERS OF THE CONE PHOTORECEPtors often have debilitating photophobia, over and above their decreased visual acuity. This prevents them from optimal visual functioning in the daytime and even in ordinary indoor illumination. Patients often need to wear a baseball cap or visor in addition to light-absorbing glasses and still find it difficult to function. Several investigators have reported improvement in effective vision in cone disorders by using red or grade 3 gray-tinted contact lenses, but these reports have generally been of only one or two ",

DESIGN: Retrospective interventional case series. METHODS: Twenty-three patients with achromatopsia or an acquired cone disorder with complaints of severe photophobia were fit with absorptive red soft contact lenses to alleviate photophobia and improve their ability to use their remaining vision more effectively RESULTS: The contact lenses immediately resolved the aversion to light, with dramatic improvement in visual function in all patients (determined by observation of the patient and by patient report). It allowed eight patients to become eligible to drive. CONCLUSIONS: Red contact lenses successfully alleviate photophobia in patients with cone disorders.
