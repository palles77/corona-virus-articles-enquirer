An indirect search for a protein structure to be used as a template for 3D modelling has been performed on the basis of the genomic organisation similarity generally exhibited by coronaviruses. The crystal structure of Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin B appeared to be structurally adaptable to human and canine coronavirus spike protein sequences and it was successfully used to model the two subunits of SARS coronavirus spike glycoprotein. The overall shape and the surface hydrophobicity of the two subunits in the obtained models suggest the localisation of the most relevant regions for their activity.",

The spike glycoprotein is translated as a large polypeptide that is subsequently cleaved by virus-encoded or host-encoded proteases to produce, like in other coronavirus, two functional subunits, S1 and S2 [9] . It has also been shown that S1 is the peripheral fragment and S2 is the membrane-spanning fragment [10] . Both chimeric S proteins appeared to cause cell fusion when expressed individually, suggesting that they were biologically fully active [9] . The spike is believed to be type I transmembrane protein, with N-terminal ectodomains and C-terminal hydrophobic anchor, and with an unusual cysteine-rich domain that bridges the putative junction of the anchor and the cytoplasmic tail [9] . The type I glycoprotein S of coronavirus, whose trimers constitute the typical viral spikes [10] , is assembled into virions through non-covalent interactions with the M protein. In the SARS spike glycoprotein, the S2 domain can be easily identified by sequence alignment of other coronavirus proteins. As far as the remaining part of the S protein is concerned, the same procedure does not yield any information, suggesting that SARS_CoV has developed a new type of S1 domain which is not conserved among the other members of the S1 family.",

The genomic regions codifying for the spike glycoprotein were identified from these sequences by using ORFfinder search [11] . The corresponding aminoacid sequences were aligned and, with the use of ClustalW v. 1.7 [12] , 99-100% pairwise sequence identities were obtained. Then, a consensus sequence obtained from this alignment was used to find a subset of homologous S glycoprotein sequences of other coronaviruses using Psi-Blast v. 2.1 [11] . Some of these sequences were chosen for secondary structure prediction and fold recognition studies, using PsiPred v.2.1 [13] and GenTHREADER [14] [17] classification of names and numbers was made. Model building of S1 and S2 subunits of SARS S glycoprotein was carried out with the ClustalW [12] alignment between the target sequence and that of the template structure. Models were subsequently optimised according to secondary structure predictions. Substitution of aminoacid residues and modelling of insertions and deletions in the target structure were performed using SwissPDBViewer software [18] . The 3D models were optimised by a 900 step minimisation run with AMBER [19] and finally validated with the PROCHECK v. 3.5.4 procedure [20] . Surface accessibility of the potential glycosylation site, mutation distribution, and localisation of CD13 binding regions were analysed by using MOLMOL software [21] . With the same software possible disulphide bridge formations were investigated by considering a threshold distance of 10 A A between Ca atoms of cysteine couples, after the prediction of the bonding/non-bonding state of all the cysteine present in S1 and S2 sequences [22] . The hydropathy profile of the protein was calculated according to Kyte and Doolittle plots [23] and hydrophilic/hydrophobic potentials were calculated with GRID [24] , using a grid resolution of 1 A A and the standard \"OH2\" and \"DRY\" probes.",

Among all the aligned S glycoprotein sequences, one of human coronavirus (SwissProt Accession Number SP36334) and one of canine coronavirus (SwissProt Accession Number SP36300) were chosen for fold recognition studies using GenTHREADER v2.1 [14] . The GenTHREADER results for human and canine CoV S proteins indicated two pdb entries, i.e., 1G9D of neurotoxin B of Clostridium botulinum and 1G5G of the Tetanus toxin, as possible templates for structure predictions. After sequence alignment of SARS S protein (SwissProt Accession Number P59594) with the corresponding ones from human and canine coronaviruses, model building of S1 and S2 subunits was obtained by using the latter two pdb files and shuffled PsiPred runs [13] , with subsequent manual optimisation to enhance the overlapping between the predicted and observed secondary structure elements.",

In this molecular moiety six hydrophobic residues, i.e., Phe 187, Phe 253, Phe 334, Trp 340, Trp 423, and Tyr 677, contribute to an extensive hydrophobic cluster formation, where long-range interactions can contribute to the S1 structure stability. This feature, not present in the used template structure, should also be of fundamental relevance in the S1 folding process [25] and could represent a suitable target for anti-viral drugs.",

Seven of these mutations are in the S1 subunit; the ones in position 77 and 244 are both localised in a helices, while the others, 239, 311, 344, 501, and 577, are in loop regions. It is interesting to note that, apart from 244 and 501 residue positions, all the other ones are located in well-exposed regions of the protein surface. High surface exposure is exhibited also by the sites of the remaining three mutations, i.e., 778, 794, and 1148 located in domains I and II of the S2 subunit.",
