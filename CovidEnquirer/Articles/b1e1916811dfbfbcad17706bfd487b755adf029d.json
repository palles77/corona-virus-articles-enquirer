In addition, there is little agreement across global vaccine development funders on which epidemic infectious disease investments should be prioritised, which stems from an absence of global research and development portfolio strategy and coordination. 4 In response to the 2014 Ebola epidemic in west Africa, WHO prioritised 11 pathogens that are most likely to cause severe outbreaks in the near future: 4 Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever, chikungunya, Ebola, Lassa, Marburg, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Nipah, Rift Valley fever, severe acute respiratory syn drome, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome, and Zika.

This information has previously neither been collated systematically nor has its actual development status been confirmed. Moreover, evidence on the cost of pharmaceutical research and development has been made available since at least the 1950s; however, this has been limited to mainly chemical drug products. Whereas publications by Di Masi and colleagues have provided the foundations on which numerous analyses or critiques of pharmaceutical research and development costs have since been conducted, evidence on vaccine-specific research and development costs for epidemic infectious diseases has been limited. The handful of articles published to date are either descriptive, based on expert opinions with limited data inputs to validate those claims, or focusing on single pathogens or only on clinical research and development phases. Recent studies have attempted to overcome several of the above limitations, focusing their analyses on poverty diseases or epidemic infectious diseases, as well as differentiating more systematically between costs associated with incremental versus breakthrough innovations.",

Moreover, our study attempts to overcome some of the limitations identified in previous vaccine research and development cost analyses in several ways. First, we consider probability of success distributions drawn from multiple published estimates, acknowledging uncertainties in research and development which cannot be explained by single sources. Second, we draw our cost data from both historically incurred and projected cost estimates in infectious disease vaccine research and development, as reported by vaccine developers who are active specifically in the field of epidemic infectious diseases. This gives us confidence that the baseline cost estimates informing our models can provide a more accurate reflection of total investments needed for vaccine development. Third, our collected data suggest that costs associated with new technologies may not differ from costs associated with well-established technologies-a finding that is contradictory to prevailing assumptions made in extant literature. Our analysis suggests that it is indirect costs, and variations in costs associated with different levels of experience of the organisations developing these products, that drive cost estimates in upward directions.",

We combined these with selfreported cost data to simulate costs adjusted for probability of success for advancing vaccines from preclinical testing through to phase 2a, within a Monte Carlo framework.

The survey asked recipients to: validate the current status of development of a prefilled list of vaccine candidates that our team had collated via literature searches, grant database searches and clinical trial registries searches over the past 12 months prior to survey launch, including information on disease, phase of develop ment, vaccine technology type, and product development partners; clarify current sources of funding, development costs incurred and future funding needs for bringing the vaccines through phase 2 and potentially phase 3 in response to potential disease outbreaks, including stockpile estimates for phase 3 trials and for emergency use (the latter not reported in the paper); specify main drivers of R&D costs and technical success to date and identify potential drivers of future costs and technical risks for bringing vaccine candidates through late phases of clinical development.

Given the relevance of vaccine developer licensure track record and a large variation in selfreported costs not explained by regression or clustering analyses (appendix), we incorporated this uncertainty into a Monte Carlo simulation. Specifically, we defined cost distributions for lower and upper bounds by dividing our sample into two groups: a lower bound group associated with costs reported by product developers with no vaccine licensure track record; and an upper bound group associated with costs reported by product developers with previous licensure experience. For each group, we constructed discrete cost distributions by research and development phase, assigning equal probabilities to the respective self reported cost estimates. In addition to costs, we constructed triangular distri butions for probability of success by research and development phase. Triangular distributions were chosen since they are commonly used to define ranges of values for uncertain variables where available data is either scarce or heterogeneous enough to not clearly dictate the appropriate range and frequency of the possible values of variables. 37 They are characterised by minimum, maximum, and modal, or most likely, values that collectively define the boundaries and shape of the distribution triangles (appendix). To move from single vaccine candidate costs to portfolio costs accounting for probability of success, we ran the simulation 10 000 times, each time randomly drawing from the following: cost distributions-for each group and research and development phase, each iteration randomly selected one cost estimate from the respective distribution; probability of success distributions-for each research and development phase, each iteration randomly drew a probability of success estimate from the respective distribution.",

In a scenario in which low costs were associated with high probability of success distributions, the same numbers of vaccine candidates would need to be supported as per the high probability of success and high cost scenario to achieve minimum phase 2a outcomes per epidemic infectious disease, but the overall portfolio cost would reduce to US$1\u20226 billion ($715 million-2\u20229 billion range). In contrast, in a scenario where high costs were associated with low probability of success distributions, the same numbers of vaccine candidates would need to be funded as per the low probability of success and low cost scenario to successfully advance at least one vaccine through to end of phase 2a successfully.

Our analysis identifies several disease areas for which the upstream vaccine research and development pipeline today is insufficient, and highlights the need for entry of new vaccine candidates into preclinical development if the chances of minimum vaccine research and development preparedness targets are to be increased. Moreover, we demonstrate that higher vaccine research and development costs, and in particular clinical research and development costs, are likely to be associated with greater industrial sector affiliation and previous licensure experience of vaccine developers. If this experience were assumed to translate to higher probability of success, investing in these projects could progress more epidemic infectious disease vaccines through to end of phase 2a.",

First, the process of vaccine development might differ substantially from that of drug development, with implications for scale and intensity of resource use and associated costs by research and development phase. 34 Second, the complexity of the platform technologies used to develop vaccines might influence research and development costs. 3, 20, 35, 36 The literature assumes that new technologies with no licensure trackrecord will induce higher research and development costs than wellestablished technologies. Third, the complexity of the pathogen against which vaccines are developed might affect research and development costs, 3,20,35,36 with vaccines against pathogens for which licensed vaccines already exist assumed to cost less. The handful of articles published on vaccine research and development costs to date are either too descriptive or based on expert opinions with little data input to validate those claims, 16, 28, 35 focusing on single pathogens 15 or only on clinical research and development phases. 15, 28 Studies 3,36 -one drawing on source data and assumptions from the other-have attempted to overcome several of the above limitations, focusing their analyses on either poverty diseases or epidemic infectious diseases, which are both characterised by poor commercial potential, as well as differentiating more systematically between costs associated with incremental versus breakthrough innovations. 3, 36 Our study attempts to overcome some of the limitations identified in previous vaccine research and development cost analyses and tries to deviate from recent studies focused on epidemic infectious disease vaccine research and development in several ways. First, although we draw our probability of success estimates from published evidence specific to vaccine research and development, 3,6,12-16 we consider probability of success distributions instead of point estimates, acknowledging uncertainties in research and development that cannot be attributed to specific explanatory factors, as our regression analyses have shown. Second, we draw our cost data from both historically incurred and projected cost estimates in infectious disease vaccine research and development, as reported by vaccine developers who are active specifically in the field of epidemic infectious diseases. This gives us confidence that the baseline cost estimates informing our models can provide a more accurate reflection of total investments needed for epidemic infectious disease vaccine development.",

This may be because of the compounding complexities of certain pathogens that make it difficult to disassociate pathogen specific from technologyspecific cost drivers, unless one has access to more granular cost data. However, a more plausible explanation perhaps is that cost variations are strongly associated with business models, rather than the technologies themselves, by which the various vaccine developers in epidemic infectious diseases are operating in the industry or nonindustry sector. 35 Our statistical analysis suggests that platform technologies are not a substantial explanatory factor for average vaccine development project costs, even if we control for the assumption that the data may be nested with respect to the individual pathogens. Instead, it is indirect costs and variations in costs associated with different levels of experience in the organisations developing these products that drive cost estimates upward.",

This implies a certain price for innovation that vaccine developers are willing to accept in order to engage in research and development, which may differ across sectors and organisations operating with different business models and internal cost structures. 39 However, in practice, project costs in areas of relatively low commercial potential are more likely to be established by payer-developer negotiations around risk and benefit sharing, which balances payer constraints with the developers' appetite for financial risk exposure. Coupled with unexpected circumstances, such as unforeseen regulatory requirements, or technological spillovers from other research and development activities, such factors may well drive realised vaccine research and develop ment expenditures either way, downwards or upwards, compared with the estimates provided in this study.",

This may also suggest that, in practice, transition probability of success between development phases is also likely to vary between organisations not only for technical reasons but also because of access to finance bottlenecks. It would be a plausible assumption to make that those organisations with previous licensure experience (and marketed vaccines) also have better access to finance, and are therefore, for financial reasons, likely to face higher probability of success in the vaccine research and development programmes (as captured by our high probability of success to high cost scenario).",

Our data sample was not sufficiently large to confidently label observations as smaller versus larger industry actors, nor was the composition of the partnerships developing these vaccines clearcut between sectors, subsectors, or geographical regions. These variables, in addition to the definitional challenges of what constitutes smaller or larger industry actors, suggest that more research would be needed to understand, and to report with greater certainty, any significant differences in costs associated with size, sectoral affiliation, and geographical location of vaccine developers.",

This assumption might not be the case if historical probability of success for phase 3 in the literature is considered. 6 However, unique clinical trial designs and speedy launches of these might be required to mitigate against waning disease outbreaks, 40 which might require different thresholds for clinical and regulatory success during public health emergencies. Moreover, as experience with Ebola and other recent epidemic infectious disease outbreaks has shown, interest of funders in supporting vaccine research and development in response to outbreaks withers together with the waning of epi demics. Any additional phase 2b-3 ready vaccine candidate would not only require an additional multimillion invest ment just in case, but also a substantial new investment in phase 2b-3 testing and emergency response. Whether more than one phase 2b-3ready vaccine candidates can be supported for a particular epidemic infectious disease is therefore also an issue for consideration by funders and decision makers in the epidemic infectious disease vaccine research and development space.",
