Four porphyrins with NO donors were synthesized, and the cancer cell-oriented accumulation and NO release from the porphyrins were found. The porphyrins with NO donor had more effective killing of BEL-7402 liver cancer cells than L-02 liver normal cells.",

Their potential use as pharmacological tools for the study of the physiological roles mediated by mGlu1 receptors is discussed. Iodine-catalyzed one-pot synthesis and antimalarial activity evaluation of symmetrically and asymmetrically substituted 3,6-diphenyl [1, 2, 4, 5] COT (Tpl2 in mice) is a serine/threonine MAP3 kinase that regulates production of TNF-a and other pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1b via theERK/ MAP kinase pathway. As TNF-a and IL-1b are clinically validated targets for therapeutic intervention in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), blocking COT provides a potential avenue for amelioration of disease. Herein we describe identification of a cellular active selective small molecule inhibitor of COT kinase. Comparative QSAR modelling was performed on 2-phenylindole-3-carbaldehydes to find more active antimitotic agents. Stepwise regression, FA-MLR, PVRA and PLS techniques were adopted for QSAR study.",
