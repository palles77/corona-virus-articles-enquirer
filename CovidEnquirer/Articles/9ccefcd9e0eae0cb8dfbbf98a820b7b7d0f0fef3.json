In South Korea, PGAR is prevalent in piglets naturally infected with PEDV. Piglets naturally co-infected with PEDV and PGAR appeared to have severe and prolonged diarrhea that was distinct from that commonly observed. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of PGAR co-infection on PEDV pathogenicity in piglets. Thirty-six colostrum-deprived, one-day old, Large White-Duroc crossbred pigs were randomly divided into four equal groups: PEDV, PEDV/PGAR, PGAR, and control groups. The piglets were euthanized at 1, 2, or 3 days post-inoculation (DPI) to measure the villous height:crypt depth (VH:CD) ratio and to collect fecal samples for RT-PCR and virus isolation. No significant differences in mean VH:CD ratio and clinical symptoms (diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and anorexia) were observed between the PEDV/PGAR-infected and PEDV-infected groups of piglets at 1, 2 and 3 DPI; however, at 2 and 3 DPI, PGAR was detected in all fecal samples by RT-PCR and virus isolation. These findings failed to detect any interaction between PEDV and porcine rotavirus in the small intestines of piglets, suggesting that concurrent infection of PGAR may not synergistically enhance intestinal villous atrophy of piglets with PEDV disease. We propose that the severe diarrhea exhibited in PEDV and PGAR co-infected piglets may be more associated with the immunity level of the host rather than to any synergistic effect of PGAR on PEDV enteritis.",

In some Korean pig herds, PEDV-induced diarrhea in neonatal piglets with PGAR co-infection seemed to be more severe and prolonged when compared to commonly observed diarrhea. Gross and histological findings also showed that the piglets diagnosed with PEDV and PGAR co-infection had more severe atrophic enteritis than those diagnosed with PEDV infection or PGAR infection (personal observation, D.S. Song). PGAR can predispose the host to developing concurrent enterotoxigenic Esherichia coli, Clostridium perfrigens, and coccidian infections, which can increase the severity of the diarrhea (Paul and Stevenson, 1999) . It was therefore speculated that concurrent infection of PGAR might affect PEDV pathogenicity in neonatal piglets. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of PGAR co-infection on PEDV pathogenicity by subjecting piglets experimentally co-infected by PEDV and PGAR to evaluation of clinical signs (severity in diarrhea, dehydration, and dehydration) and histological morphometric analysis (villous height: crypt depth) in mid-jejunum where PEDV lesions were evident.",

PEDV strain DR13 (P4) was a virulent strain that caused watery diarrhea in one-day old piglets within 1 day after oral inoculation in a preliminary study. For PGAR strain Gottfried, the virus showed less virulence compared to the PEDV strain DR13 by causing mild to moderate diarrhea in one-day old piglets between 2 and 3 day after oral infection. Piglets infected with PGAR showed mild to moderate villous atrophy in mid-jejunum as well as in distal/ ileal intestines at 2 and 3 day after infection.

The piglets were acquired from pregnant sows that had not been vaccinated with any PEDV or porcine rotavirus before parturition. Of the three treatment groups, 27 piglets were inoculated orally with either 3 ml of virus stock of the PEDV strain Dr13 (10 5 tissue culture infective doses 50% [TCID 50 ]/ml), 3 ml of virus stock of the PGAR strain Gottfried (10 4 TCID 50 /ml), or with 3 ml of both PEDV and GAR at a 1:1 ratio. For the PEDV/PGAR group, the piglets were infected orally with PEDV at 12 h after inoculation with PGAR so that PEDV would replicate in intestinal epithelial cells with an established PGAR infection and at the time, PGAR group piglets were inoculated with PGAR. The experiment was designed in this way to evaluate the potential effect of a secondary PGAR infection on the intestinal villous atrophy induced by a primary PEDV infection. Nine control piglets were similarly treated with uninfected cell culture medium. All piglets were maintained in stainless steel isolates (three per isolator), and fed a commercial sterile milk substitute. Animals were examined three times daily for clinical signs. Three piglets from each group were euthanized by electrocution at 1, 2, and 3 days post-inoculation (DPI) for tissue collection and analysis. All piglets were sedated with an intravenous injection of sodium pentobarbital, and euthanized by electrocution, as described previously (Anonymous, 2001) . Complete necropsies were performed on all the pigs, and all organs were grossly and histologically examined. Three intestinal samples (from a 15 cm sample of the intermediate jejunal zone) were collected and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for histological morphometric analysis.",

However, rotaviruses infect different regions of the intestines depending on the difference in the virulence of each virus strain, and the infected regions include the middle jejunum as well as the distal jejunum or ileum (Bridger, 1994; Hall et al., 1993) . The piglets with PGAR Gottfried strain infection also showed marked villous atrophy in the middle jejunal intestine at 3 DPI (Fig. 1) . We guess that the PGAR Gottfried strain could affect replication and distribution of PEDV in villous epithelial cells of the middle intestines of the pigs co-infected with PEDV. The severity of intestinal villous atrophy by PEDV may depend on the type of virus strain used to inoculate the piglets. The PEDV strain DR13 (P4) was virulent enough to cause watery diarrhea in piglets within 24 h after oral infection. However, the DR13 strain was not as virulent as the one described in previous reports, where the VH:CD ratio of experimentally PEDV-infected piglets decreased to less than 3 at 3 DPI (Jung et al., 2006b,c) . Virulence and inoculum dose of the PEDV DR13 strain were considered to be appropriate at evaluation of severity of villous atrophy (VH:CD ratio). In our study, equivalent doses of the two viruses (3 \u00b7 10 5 TCID 50 /pig for PEDV and 3 \u00b7 10 4 TCID 50 /pig for PGAR in the study) were not used. A difference in the inoculum dose between these two viruses could affect the outcome. However, the effects were considered to be minor to get the same results, because the inoculum dose (3 \u00b7 10 4 TCID 50 ) of PGAR showed enough clinical symptoms and villous atrophy in PGAR only-infected group.",

Piglets naturally co-infected with PEDV and PGAR seem to have severe and prolonged diarrhea that is distinct from that commonly observed (personal observation, D.S. Song). PGAR infection is known to be associated with host immune and environmental factors (Paul and Stevenson, 1999) . Rotavirus diarrhea is more prolonged and severe in immuno-compromised animals and humans (Eiden et al., 1985; Liakopoulou et al., 2005; Paul and Stevenson, 1999) . Considering that there was no interaction between PEDV and PGAR in the present study, we speculate that the severe diarrhea observed in PEDV and PGAR coinfected piglets may be more a consequence of the immunity level of the host rather than the result of any synergistic effect of PGAR on PEDV-induced enteritis. A previous study using a virulent PEDV strain demonstrated that immunosuppression due to the transplacental infection with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) probably potentiates PEDV pathogenicity in piglets by causing more severe intestinal villous atrophy compared to PEDV only-infected pigs (Jung et al., 2006a) . The piglets co-infected with PCV2 and PEDV and piglets infected with PEDV alone were histologically different with respect to their VH:CD ratios at 2 and 3 PID (Jung et al., 2006b) .",
