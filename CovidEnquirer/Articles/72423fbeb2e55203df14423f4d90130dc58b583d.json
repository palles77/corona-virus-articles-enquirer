The former binds to sialic acids on target cells to initiate virus infection and the latter cleaves sialic acids to allow virus release. 1 The haemagglutinins of human infl uenza viruses preferentially bind to \u03b12-6 sialic acid receptors whereas the haemagglutinins of avian infl uenza viruses bind to \u03b12-3 sialic acid receptors. 2 The functional balance of haemagglutinin and neuraminidase activities has roles in viral pathogenicity, replication effi ciency, and transmissibility. 3 Infl uenza A viruses are classifi ed into various subtypes on the basis of the antigenicity of their haemagglutinin and neuraminidase. In addition to subtypes H1, H2, and H3 of seasonal infl uenza A viruses, subtypes H5, H7, H9, and H10 have been reported to cause infections in human beings. 1,4 Infl uenza A H6N1 virus has been isolated from migrating birds and domestic poultry in many continents. [5] [6] [7] [8] It is thought to be of low pathogenicity for avian species and has caused outbreaks in poultry with slight morbidity and mortality. 8, 9 Infection with H6N1 has been prevalent in domestic chickens in Taiwan since 1972. 9 The virus circulating among Taiwan poultry is of a genetically unique lineage, diff erent from that circulating in Hong Kong and southeast China, and has shown the potential for crossspecies infection of mammals. 9 Human infection with the wild infl uenza A H6 subtype has not been reported in the scientifi c literature. In our study, we detected a human case of infection with the H6N1 virus. We report the clinical presentation, contact and environmental investigations of the infected patient, and assess the origin and genetic characteristics of the isolated virus.",

The unsubtyped infl uenza A virus was analysed with conventional RT-PCR using universal primer sets. 12 The clinical specimen of the patient was tested later using real-time RT-PCR assay for H6 subtyping, which was confi rmed on the basis of the haemagglutinin sequence of the H6N1 virus isolated in this study. The primers and probe sequences were H6-1578F (TGGTGTGTATCAAATTCTTG), H6-1706R (GCATTGCATTGARCCAT), and H6-1620P (FAM-TATAGTACGGTATCGAGCAGTCTRGT-BHQ). The clinical specimen of the patient was tested for other respiratory viruses, using 13 multiplex real-time RT-PCR/PCR reactions that were set up to detect 23 human respiratory viruses: adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, coronaviruses (229E, OC43, NL63, HKU1, MERS-CoV), metapneumovirus, parainfl uenza type 1-4, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, varicella zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, human herpes virus 6 and 7, bocavirus, parvovirus, enterovirus, and rhinovirus.

We report HI titres as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum that inhibited virusinduced haemagglutination. Sera that tested negative at a dilution of 1:10 were recorded as a titre of less than 10.",

The PB1 gene of TW02/13 shared greatest nucleotide identity (95\u00b77%) with the older A/ chicken/Taiwan/PF3/02 H6N1 (appendix). Phylogenetic analyses of the eight gene segments showed that TW02/13 belonged to an H6N1 lineage that has circulated in chickens in Taiwan since 1997. This lineage comprises all H6N1 viruses isolated in Taiwan and is separated from the viruses in Hong Kong and other regions, suggesting that all segments of TW02/13 originated from viruses in chickens in Taiwan (fi gure 3 and appendix). Gene segment constellations of human TW02/13 isolate and chicken A2837/13 viruses were analysed and are summarised in fi gure 4 based on the phylogenetic topologies of the eight gene segments from viruses of this lineage. The PB2, PA, NP, NA, M, and NS segments of TW02/13 and A2837/13 were all descended from A/chicken/Taiwan/A342/05 H6N1 (A342/05). The PB1 gene of TW02/13 was evolutionarily related to A2837/13 and could be traced back to the older A/chicken/Taiwan/PF3/02 H6N1 (PF3/02). The HA gene of TW02/13 and A2837/13 clustered with A/chicken/Taiwan/0204/05 (0204/05), apart from A342/05 and PF3/02. The incongruent relation between various segments of these phylogenetic topologies suggested that TW02/13 was generated from complex interclade reassortments among A/chicken/Taiwan/ A342/05 H6N1, A/chicken/Taiwan/PF3/02 H6N1, and A/chicken/Taiwan/0204/05 H6N1-like viruses in poultry in Taiwan (fi gure 4) .

The other important signatures, Q226L substitution in haemagglutinin and E627K and D701Q in the PB2 protein, were not detected in TW02/13. PB1-F2 of TW02/13 was truncated and comprised 57 aminoacids. A 14-aminoacid deletion in the stalk region of neuraminidase was noted at position 41-52 and 68-69 of TW02/13, compared with that of A/ chicken/Taiwan/ns2/99 H6N1. For the antiviral drugrelated markers, TW02/13 encoded NA-275H, suggesting susceptibility to oseltamivir. In the M2 protein, TW02/13 carried a S31N substitution, conferring resistance to adamantanes. The C-terminal region of the NS1 protein of TW02 contains the sequence EPEV, which has been linked to high pathogenesis in a mouse model. 20 The actual signifi cance of each potential virulence mutation described was based on animal studies, and the pathogenesis of this infl uenza virus in humans remains unknown.",

The G228S substitution has been reported to contribute to the specifi city of haemagglutinin for the human \u03b12-6 sialic acid receptor, thereby enabling the replication and transmission of the virus within and among human beings. 25 Notably, most of the H6N1 viruses isolated in Taiwan after 2005 exhibited the G228S substitution and all haemagglutinin sequences of H6N1 with the G228S substitution in the NCBI database were obtained from isolates in Taiwan, suggesting that a unique H6N1 lineage with the humanadapted G228S substitution has become endemic and predominant in poultry in Taiwan 9 Deletion in the neuraminidase stalk seemed to be associated with adaptation and virulence of aquatic viruses in chickens; 26 it should be carefully monitored and assessed for a possible relation between NA deletion and human adaptation. These viruses continue to evolve and accumulate changes, increasing the potential risk of avian-to-human transmission. Regarding the origin of human H6N1 TW02/13 virus, Yuan and colleagues 27 analysed our submitted sequences and speculated that the virus was derived from the reassortment of H5N2 and H6N1 viruses. However, the six internal genes of Taiwan chicken H5N2 virus have been shown to originate from the Taiwan chicken H6N1 viruses. 28 Therefore, we propose that the human H6N1 virus was probably generated through interclade reassortment among H6N1 viruses. Previous studies have shown that the H6N1 virus has the potential to serve as a scaff old virus, which provides internal gene segments to reassortants. 28-30 H6N1, H9N2, and H5N1 viruses in southeast China might exchange their gene segments. 29 The H5N2 strains circulating in Taiwan have six segments originating from the H6N1 strain. 28 It was of concern that if the reassortment happened between the H6N1 virus and other infl uenza viruses, it would increase the genetic diversity and allow the emergence of new pathogenic infl uenza strains that might infect human beings. Our study has some limitations. First, because serological data of all contacts were not obtained, asymptomatic infection with seroconversion could not be excluded. Second, none of the causative pathogens for the close contacts were identifi ed. All the contacts had recovered from their infection episodes by the time the investigation was launched and the causative pathogens were not isolated from their throat swabs.",

The occurrence of a human case of H6N1 infection shows the unpredictability of infl uenza viruses in human populations. Further epidemical and laboratory investigations are warranted to elucidate the potential threat posed by the emerging virus. Our report highlights the need for infl uenza pandemic preparedness, including intensive surveillance for ever evolving avian infl uenza viruses.",

Red arrows represent possible evolutionary pathways for PF3/02 virus, green arrows for 0204/05 virus, and blue arrows for A342/05 virus. The red lines show that gene segments possess diff erent mutations. For example, the TW02/13 virus was generated through reassortments among PF3/02 virus, providing the PB1 segment; 0204/05 virus, providing the HA segment; and A342/05 virus, providing the PB2, PA, NP, NA, M, and NS segments. PF3/02=A/chicken/Taiwan/ PF3/02. 0204/05=A/chicken/Taiwan/0204/05. A342/05=A/chicken/antiviral resistance, and pathogenesis are analysed and listed in table 2. The haemagglutinin cleavage site of TW02/13 did not contain additional basic aminoacids (PQIATR/G), suggesting low pathogenicity in poultry species. Analysis of the receptor binding site of the haemagglutinin protein showed a G228S substitution (H3 numbering) that is also evident in some avian H6N1 viruses in Taiwan. Based on the phylogenetic topology of HA genes, these G228S-carrying viruses formed a clade (designated as 228S in fi gure 3). The H6N1 viruses isolated from chickens in Taiwan after 2005 had the G228S substitution, suggesting that the 228S clade viruses have become endemic and predominant in",

The results of our search showed that human beings with infl uenza A H6N1 virus infection in nature has not been reported. For genetic analysis of the human H6N1 virus (A/Taiwan/2/2013), we did a BLAST search of each H6N1 gene segment on the US National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database on May 30, 2013. Our search showed that the sequences of the human H6N1 virus were closest to those of viruses isolated from chickens in Taiwan. We selected 45 of 205 H6N1 viruses with full-length sequences in the NCBI database of viruses with closer relation to that of A/Taiwan/2/2013, and some reference strains for phylogenetic analyses. To understand the geographical and temporal distribution of the G228S substitution of haemagglutinin in subtype H6 viruses, a total of 1539 HA sequences of H6 subtype in the NCBI database were included for analysis and 30 sequences contained the G228S substitution. Two of 30 viruses with G228S belonged to the H6N6 subtype and were isolated from a pig and duck in China in 2006 and 2010, and the other 28 viruses were H6N1 subtype isolated from chickens (n=27) and a duck (n=1) in Taiwan from 2000 to 2010.",

We also noted that the virus carried a human adaptation marker, G228S, in its haemagglutinin and a unique group of H6N1 viruses with G228S have circulated persistently in poultry in Taiwan since 2000.",
