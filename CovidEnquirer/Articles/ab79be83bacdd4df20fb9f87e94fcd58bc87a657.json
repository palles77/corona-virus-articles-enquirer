The structure of the mRNA for topoisomerase gene 60 in bacteriophage T4 has a more dramatic effect on protein synthesis (22) .

The base-pairs in A-form helices are tilted with respect to the helix axis and displaced from it by about 4 A; this causes the minor groove in RNA to be wide and shallow, and the major groove to be very narrow and deep (Fig. 3) . In crystals, the A-form RNA helix has 11 bp per turn, as opposed to 10 bp per turn of B-form DNA helix. In both RNA and DNA, the helices wind tighter in aqueous solution. The helical repeat of RNA in solution is reported (34) as 11.3 bp per turn or as 11.6 bp (34a), as compared to 10.6 bp per turn for DNA (35-37). Although there are local variations in conformation depending on base sequence, RNA duplex regions are, in general, in standard A-form geometry. Unusual sequences may adopt other conformations.

Thermodynamic studies of hairpins with loop sequences (U),, (C),, or (A), (n ranging from 3 to 9) showed that loops containing four or five nucleotides are the most stable (42 Fig. 4) . U, and G, form a reverse wobble U*G pair (shown in Fig. 5 ) with the guanosine in the syn conformation. This leaves a loop of only two unpaired nucleotides: u6 and C,. The u6 base stacks on the sugar of C,, and the C, base stacks on the Us base. The C, amino proton is close to a 3' phosphate oxygen of Us, implying the formation of a base-phosphate hydrogen bond. The presence of this hydrogen bond is consistent with the 1.4 kcal/mol destabilization of the loop (in 10 mM buffer, pH 6.5, at 25\u00b0C) when the cytidine at position 7 is changed to uridine. NMR studies of the U, mutant show little change in loop conformation. G, is still syn, and most of the chemical shifts are the same as in the original molecule. The destabilization can be explained by the replacement of the favorable contact between the C, amino and a 3' phosphate oxygen of U, by an unfavorable interaction of the U, keto with the phosphate oxygen. The loop is also destabilized by switching the closing base-pair from C4.Gg to G4Cg (45); N M R studies have not yet been done to try to understand this effect.",

The five stacked nucleotides are followed by a turn in the sugar-phosphate backbone created by a change in the phosphodiester torsion angles between G, and U, . The turn structure is stabilized by a hydrogen bond between the imino proton of U, , and a 3' phosphate oxygen of A, , , as well as stacking between the phosphate of G, and the base of U33.

A hairpin that occurs in wheat germ 5-S rRNA containing a loop of 12 nucleotides has been studied by NMR (49, 50) . A-form stacking does continue into the loop from the stem, but, unlike the anticodon loop, the stacking continues for several nucleotides along the 5' strand.

The structures of the tRNA anticodon loop and the UUCG loop suggest that the specific loop sequences adopt conformations that are more stable because they contain more hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions-particularly interactions with the sugar-phosphate backbone. It has been suggested (51) that loop nucleotides stacked in A-form geometry along the 3' strand are a common feature of RNA hairpins. The examples discussed here show that there is a range of loop structures. The anticodon loop contains nucleotides stacked along the 3' strand, but the hairpin from 5-S rRNA has nucleotides stacked along the 5' strand. In the three small hairpin loops-UUCG, UCU, and UUU-the backbone angles of each loop nucleotide differ significantly from A-form geometry. The conformations of the nucleotides in these small loops suggest that these nucleotides are not very accessible for base-pairing with other regions of RNA. Five of the nucleotides in the anticodon loop, on the other hand, are stacked in normal A-form geometry which facilitates pairing with other nucleotides.",

Determining the conformation of these loops in RNA is important for understanding how these nucleotides interact with other elements of secondary structure to form tertiary interactions and for understanding how proteins bind to bulge loops. The chemical reactivity of bulge loops in 164 rRNA (54) has been studied. A bulge loop containing six nucleotides appears to exist without breaking the base-pairs on either side, since these pairs are protected from chemical modification. Some of the nucleotides within the bulge loop were also protected from modification, which suggests either that the loop nucleotides form a structure involving stacking and hydrogen bonding, or that the nucleotides form tertiary interactions. Bulge loops can affect the long-range structure of nucleic acid helices by creating a bend in the double helix. Bending has been detected by the altered mobility in nondenaturing gel electrophoresis for both RNA and DNA helices containing bulge loops (55-57). Bulge loops in DNA or RNA helices containing five adenosines were found to alter the gel mobility more than bulge loops containing five thymidines or uridines (34,55), which shows that the structure of the bend depends on the identity of the bulge nucleotides. The bending was also shown to be affected by the base-pairs surrounding the bulge loop. One of the assumptions made when studying RNA secondary structure is that the structure is independent of the surrounding conformations. For example, a short region of duplex RNA is assumed to be the same whether it occurs next to a hairpin or next to a junction. Several studies suggest that bulge nucleotides affect the structure of the duplex surrounding them for several base-pairs. Thermodynamic studies showed that the free energies of bulge loops containing adenosines were 2 kcal/mol more stable (at 37\u00b0C) for the sequences GCG(A),GCGACGCCGCA than for GCG(A),GUCA-GACCGCA. Helices containing dangling nucleotides were more destabilized by bulge loops than were helices without dangling nucleotides (58) . Nuclease V, (EC 3.1.22.3 or 3.1.27.8) cutting in duplex regions containing bulges and intercalated ethidium showed that ethidium intercalation into a double helix is affected for several base-pairs around a bulge nucleotide (59) . A distortion in the duplex region near an adenosine bulge (in boldface) in the sequence d [CGCGAAATTTACGCG] , was observed by NMR. The presence of a phosphate resonance in the downfield region of the spectrum indicated an unusual backbone conformation. The downfield resonance was assigned to the 5' phosphate of the guanosine one nucleotide removed from the bulge (60).",

The distortion in the helix backbone is presumably caused by the difference in the width of a mismatch pair (C1'-Cl' distance) versus that of Watson-Crick base-pairs. The difference in width could also explain why G-U mismatches are slightly less stable when they are in the middle of a Watson-Crick region of a helix than at the end (61) and why many of the mismatches in proposed rRNA secondary structures are found at helix termini (43, 63) .

Coaxial stacking between helical regions in the 1 6 4 rRNA has been proposed on the basis of phylogenetic comparison (75) . One criterion for deciding whether two helical regions stack is that their combined length in basepairs is conserved between different organisms, although the lengths of individual helices are not conserved. It has also been suggested (76) that the helical regions separated by the fewest unpaired nucleotides will stack coaxially. Both of these methods for predicting coaxial stacking predict more coaxially stacked helical regions than are found in a 16-S rRNA model based on chemical crosslinking (77). Experimental studies must be done to determine which factors, such as the number of stems and unpaired nucleotides in the junction, govern the stacking of different helices. In addition to stacking helical regions together, junction regions act as hinges that orient the different helical regions in space. The four-stem junction in tRNAs adopt an L shape and the four-stem DNA junction adopts an X shape. The conformations of more RNA junctions should be characterized in order to learn the various shapes that junctions can adopt.",

In practice, organisms whose primary sequences differ by 20-40% give the best results with phylogenetic comparison (86). Sequences that are too dissimilar are difficult to align, and sequences that are too similar do not have enough compensatory base changes to establish the existence of helical regions.

One reason is that the calculated energies are based on incomplete experimental data and thus have significant uncertainties. Another reason is that biological RNA molecules begin folding as they are synthesized; they could become kinetically trapped in a structure that is not the structure of lowest energy. Furthermore, tertiary interactions may stabilize a secondary structure that is not calculated to have the lowest free energy. The most fundamental reason for calculating alternate secondary structures is that biological RNA molecules may not form a single secondary structure, but may instead have several structures in equilibrium.

Errors in this assumption can be accounted for by predicting tertiary interactions for several secondary structures. Unfortunately, free energies have not been measured for most tertiary structures. The free energy of pseudoknot formation has been determined for a very limited set of molecules (99) , but the free energies of other tertiary interactions, such as loop-loop pairing, base-triples, or intercalation, have not been determined.",

The algorithm predicts stem-loops due to pseudoknots as well as those due to normal hairpins. The biggest limitation of this algorithm is that it only predicts a single structure. The free-energy contribution of the base-pairs in a pseudoknot were assumed to be the same as in a hairpin stem; the free-energy contribution of the two loops of the pseudoknot was empirically determined so that known pseudoknots were predicted.

Oligonucleotides used for NMR studies of nonexchangeable protons are designed to adopt structures found in larger RNA molecules. Lower-resolution studies such as chemical modification can be done to check that the structure adopted by the oligonucleotide is similar to the structure within the larger RNA molecule. Scalar coupling constants, also called spin-spin splittings, can be measured for two nuclei separated by two, three, or sometimes four bonds. For a three-bond splitting, for example, H-C-C-H, the value of the coupling constant depends on the torsion angle for rotation around the central bond. Coupling constants are related to torsion angles by Karplus-type equations (142); these relationships have been determined for the sugar-phosphate backbone in RNA by studies of model compounds (143) . Coupling constants can be measured between ribose protons as well as between protons and phosphorus atoms. These coupling constants can be used to determine four of the seven torsion angles that completely define the conformation of a nucleotide unit (Fig. 6 ). Information about two of the three remaining torsion angles can be estimated from phosphorus chemical shift information as described below, and the remaining torsion angle can be determined from the intranucleotide NOEs.

Phosphorus chemical shifts have been correlated with the two phosphodiester torsion angles 0-P-0 (145). Normally, both phosphodiester torsion angles are in the gauche conformation. Both theory (146) and experiment (14, 148) suggest that ifeither of the two angles changes to the trans conformation, the phosphorus resonance moves to the downfield region of the spectrum.

Since each nucleotide has seven degrees of freedom, 84 independent constraints suffice to define the structure completely. Although there are more than 84 N M R constraints, the fact that they are not all independent may result in an underdefined structure. The structure generated from these constraints by the distancegeometry algorithm was compared to the starting structure. The results showed that areas of the structure where many interproton distances were used (the sugars and the bases) were well defined. However, the phosphate backbone was not very well defined. The root-mean-square deviation for the generated base hydrogen atoms was 0.43 A, whereas the deviation was 1.99 8, for the phosphorus atoms.

Intermolecular contacts include base-pairing and backbone interactions. Backbone interactions occur between regions of RNA already base-paired. Although these interactions are not well-characterized, they probably involve the backbone of one helical region interacting with the groove of another helical region. These interactions include basesugar, base-phosphate, sugar-sugar, and sugar-phosphate hydrogen bonds.",

The enthalpy changes during formation of anticodon loop complexes are similar to that of duplex formation, but the entropy of formation is significantly more favorable for the anticodons than for the duplexes (217). The favorable entropy change for the codon-anticodon interaction is probably due to the stacked conformation of the nucleotides within the anticodon loop. Often, the nucleotides in small hairpin loops are not stacked in A-form geometry, presumably making base-paired complexes with these loops much less stable than complexes with anticodon loops.",

As previously discussed, the intron is capable of binding an RNA duplex through backbone interactions (116) . A separate study showed the importance of the 2' hydroxyl when the intron binds a single-stranded oligonucleotide (219). A single-stranded RNA oligonucleotide base-pairs to the intron, forming a complex lo4 times (6 kal/mol) more stable than would be expected for RNA duplex formation; however, the stability of a complex between the intron and a DNA oligonucleotide is only as stable as the formation of short RNA-DNA duplexes. This suggests that either the 2' hydroxyl groups of the oligonucleotide form specific interactions with the intron or that the intron forms interactions with the sugar or phosphate groups along the backbone of an A-form duplex.",

This suggestion is supported by a chemical crosslink that forms in the M 1 RNA-tRNA complex between base-paired regions of the M 1 RNA and the precursor tRNA (159) . As previously noted (159), there is striking sequence and secondary structure homology between the region of the M 1 RNA that crosslinks to the tRNA and the region of the 234 rRNA which was found to bind tRNA by chemical footprinting (83). Complexes stabilized by backbone interactions may be a general feature of catalytic RNA-substrate complexes since these interactions are weak and allow dissociation of the enzyme-substrate complex after the reaction.",

The stability of these hybrids is believed to play a role in transcription termination (220). The combination of a stable hairpin forma-tion in the nascent RNA followed by a repeating dA sequence in the DNA leads to termination. The explanation for this is that the stable hairpin causes the polymerase to pause and disrupts part of the hybrid duplex (221). The polymerase complex is held together by the remaining hybrid duplex. Since rU*dA hybrid duplexes are much less stable than other hybrids (222, 223) , the polymerase falls off and transcription terminates.",

            "text": "(68). It is not known what determines whether internal loops are open or whether they close by forming non-Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding. The effect that internal loops, particularly asymmetrical ones, have on the helical backbone of RNA has not been determined. Chemical modification of two asymmetrical internal loops in the S8 protein binding site of 164 rRNA suggests that one is open and the other is closed by the formation of mismatch hydrogen bonding (69). The accessi-bility of all of the nucleotides in a loop to either chemical or enzymatic modification is good evidence that the loop remains open. Uridines in the second loop were protected from modification, suggesting the formation of hydrogen bonds in a U-U mismatch (Fig. 5); the U-U pair, together with the accessibility of three adenosines in this loop to chemical modification, suggests that the loop closes with the three adenosines looped out of the helix.NMR studies have been done on a symmetrical internal loop of Escherichia coli 5-S rRNA, known as loop E (70). The chemical shift and exchange behavior of the imino protons assigned to nucleotides in the loop indicate that the loop does not close by forming hydrogen bonds in G -G or G-A(Fig. 5) mismatchpairs. An open conformation was also found for a symmetrical internal loop similar to loop E of Xenopus Zueuis 5-S rRNA by NMR studies(30). This internal loop(Fig. 7)has the potential to close by the formation of hydrogen bonds in G*A mismatches, but the imino proton spectrum indicates that the nucleotides in the loop are not involved in hydrogen bonding. NMR studies on the nonexchangeable protons showed that the bases within this open loop stack extensively with only minor distortions from A-form geometry.A uridine was added to this internal loop to make the sequence identical to that within loop E of X.

Models have been built for 1 6 3 rRNA (71, 77, 127-129), 5-S rRNA (log), the 3' end of turnip yellow mosaic virus RNA (130), and the self-splicing intron of Tetrahymena (76).

Model builders first assume that helical regions adopt standard A-form geometry; this is supported by NMR experiments on RNA in solution as well as the known crystal structures of RNAs. Only loop regions of RNA are now left with any degrees of freedom. The conformations of loop regions are varied without bringing atoms closer than van der Waals contact, so that regions of secondary structure satisfy the crosslinking and tertiary pairing constraints.
