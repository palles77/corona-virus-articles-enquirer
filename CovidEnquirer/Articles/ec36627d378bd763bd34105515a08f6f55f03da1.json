Plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) e concentration was 10 pg/ml (RI, <40 pg/mL; sample obtained at the time of ionized hypercalcemia), whereas plasma PTH-related protein (PTHrP) f concentration was equivocally increased (14.25 pg/mL; 1.5 pmol/L; RI, <9.5 pg/mL). Plasma PTHrP concentrations >20.9 pg/mL are considered suggestive of malignancy. Thoracic and abdominal imaging identified only nonspecific changes consistent with tissue mineralization, and neoplastic disease hence was considered unlikely. Thoracic radiography disclosed a diffuse bronchial pattern with mild bronchial mineralization. Abdominal radiography identified loss of serosal detail, consistent with lack of intra-abdominal fat; both kidneys appeared slightly enlarged. Abdominal ultrasound examination confirmed slight bilateral renomegaly (both kidneys measuring 4 cm in length), with hyperechoic speckled cortices and bilateral medullary rim sign. Bilateral pyelectasia (1-2 mm) was present, and attributed to IV fluid therapy. Fineneedle aspirates of the kidneys obtained under ultrasound guidance to investigate the possibility of renal lymphoma did not identify any lymphocytes or microorganisms. Because vitamin D toxicosis was a differential diagnosis for hypercalcemia in this patient (usually associated with mildly increased serum inorganic phosphorus concentration), plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was measured, yielding a value of 22.8 ng/mL; 57 nmol/L (RI, 26.0-68.1 ng/mL). Granulomatous diseases are thought to cause hypercal-cemia through synthesis of vitamin D analogs, 1 and could have explained the increased serum CK activity in this patient. However, a serum Toxoplasma gondii microagglutination test, a serum cryptococcal latex agglutination test, a feline coronavirus antibody titer, and a Baermann flotation for feline lungworm (Aelurostrongylus spp.) all were negative. Serum cortisol concentration was 6.8 lg/dL (188.0 nmol/L), probably ruling out glucocorticoid-deficient hypoadrenocorticism as a cause of the hypercalcemia. Looking for other explanations for the decreased and somewhat waxing and waning mentation, the possibility of a portosystemic vascular anomaly (PSVA) was explored. Plasma ammonia concentration was moderately increased (211 lg/dL; 124 lmol/L; RI, 0-102 lg/dL), whereas serum concentrations of pre-and postprandial bile acids were within normal limits, as were results of biochemical liver function tests in combination with an ultrasonographically normal appearance of the liver. These results suggested that a PSVA was highly unlikely. The hyperammonemia was considered unlikely to be of clinical relevance, because a direct association with the more clinically relevant findings in this patient (ie, marked hypercalcemia and widespread mineralization) was not apparent.",

Multinucleated regenerative myofibers were interspersed with atrophic, degenerate, and calcified fibers. Lakes of calcified debris forming nodules at the lingual margins were present, as was multifocal gastric mucosal calcification. Radial cortical calcification, centered on tubular basement membranes, was demonstrated in the kidneys, providing an explanation for the granular casts. Multifocal basement membrane calcification of small airways and blood vessels also was observed, and the adrenal glands had focal calcification.

An extended staining panel conducted on 8 lm cryosections included hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid Schiff, modified Gomori trichrome, oil red O, and Alizarin red (Fig 2) . There were prominent dystrophic features within the triceps and quadriceps muscles, consisting of marked fiber size variation, numerous internalized nuclei, basophilic regenerating fibers, increased endomysial and perimysial connective tissue, and Gomori trichrome stains). Periodic acid Schiff stain identified small amounts of fine granular glycogen in most fibers, with some fibers devoid of glycogen. Alizarin red stain identified deposits of calcium salts in the walls of blood vessels, in the endomysium and within a few muscle fibers. Oil red O stain identified accumulation of lipid droplets (red specks) in the cytoplasm of some fibers. Scale bars = 100 lm. and large areas of infiltrating mononuclear cells (probably macrophages).

[13] [14] [15] [16] The calcification in these human and veterinary patients has occurred primarily within the intima of blood vessel walls, resulting in ischemia and necrosis with subsequent mineralization. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] In our patient, subintimal calcification was noted in larger blood vessels as well as in blood vessels in the musculature, including the myocardium, with associated ischemia, necrosis, and calcification. However, calcium deposits also were demonstrated within the myoplasma (best visualized with the Alizarin red stain, Fig 2) . This pathology is unusual in humans, and when present usually is preceded by calcification of the skin. 12, 17 To our knowledge, extensive calcification of the striated musculature has not been demonstrated previously in either cats or dogs without preexisting muscular disease, [13] [14] [15] 18, 19 but a recent case series described systemic calcification in 5 horses, all of which exhibited muscle calcification and increased serum CK activities. 20 The reason for calcification in these patients was unclear, but the authors speculated that they were 'sensitized' by an increased Ca 9 P product (2 horses) or hyperphosphatemia (5 horses), and subsequently challenged by steroids, plasma administration, trauma, an inflammatory condition, or some combination of these factors, resulting in systemic calcification. Interestingly, all of these horses had decreased (2 horses) or normal (3 horses) calcium concentrations, and only 2 had an increased Ca 9 P product. A recent report described idiopathic calciphylaxis in a 10-week-old male domestic shorthair kitten, 21 but this kitten differed from our patient by predominantly presenting for severe cutaneous lesions and experiencing full recovery with symptomatic treatment. Furthermore, apart from assumed age-related hyperphosphatemia, the kitten's laboratory test results were unremarkable, including a normal Ca 9 P product. The cutaneous calcification was hypothesized to represent an inherited disorder. Unlike our patient, this kitten did not have any apparent reason for generalized mineralization, possibly explaining why the calcification was limited to the skin. Our patient suffered from systemic calcification involving muscle and visceral organs, presumptively a consequence of the markedly increased Ca 9 P product. The potentially deleterious consequences of an increased Ca 9 P product emphasize the importance of monitoring the Ca 9 P product in hypercalcemic patients, and suggest that every effort should be made to decrease it (and thereby probably the risk of mineralization) as soon as possible.",

On the basis of the clinical presentation and thorough ante-and postmortem investigations, we conclude that the markedly increased Ca 9 P product in this patient accounted for the mineralization, with the extensive muscle fiber calcification explaining the markedly increased serum CK activity. We consider the patient's decreased mentation to be a result of the systemic effects of the severe tissue mineralization, which did not resolve within a matter of days 15, 22 despite transient normocalcemia. Pain is one of the initial signs of calciphylaxis in humans, 23 and the cat may have responded to painful sensation with decreased mentation, although the cat did not appear painful when handled. The hypercalcemia itself also may have contributed to this patient's decreased mentation. Human patients with hypercalcemia related to primary hyperparathyroidism can present with headaches, fatigue, nausea, and mental disturbances, including coma. 24 These signs have been found to correlate with the degree of hypercalcemia rather than plasma PTH concentration, with clinical improvement corresponding to decreasing calcium concentration despite persistently high PTH concentration. 24 The lack of clinical improvement in our patient at the time of normocalcemia, however, does not support hypercalcemia as the sole cause of obtundation. Hyperammonemia contributing to the patient's decreased mentation was considered unlikely, but could not be eliminated. Because mammalian muscle produces ammonia, 25 ",
