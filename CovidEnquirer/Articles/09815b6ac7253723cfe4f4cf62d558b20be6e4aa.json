            "text": "Background: A stochastic discrete event simulation model was developed to assess the effectiveness of passenger screening for Pandemic Influenza (PI) at U.S. airport foreign entry. Methods: International passengers arriving at 18 U.S. airports from Asia, Europe, South America, and Canada were assigned to one of three states: not infected, infected with PI, infected with other respiratory illness. Passengers passed through layered screening then exited the model. 80% screening effectiveness was assumed for symptomatic passengers; 6% asymptomatic passengers. Results: In the first 100 days of a global pandemic, U.S. airport screening would evaluate over 17 M passengers with 800 K secondary screenings. 11,570 PI infected passengers (majority asymptomatic) would enter the U.S. undetected from all 18 airports. Foreign airport departure screening significantly decreased the false negative (infected/undetected) passengers. U.S. attack rates: no screening (26.9%e30.9%); screening (26.4%e30.6%); however airport screening results in 800 Ke1.8 M less U.S. PI cases; 16 Ke35 K less deaths (2% fatality rate). Antiviral medications for travel contact prophylaxis (10 contacts/PI passenger) were high e 8.8 M. False positives from all 18 airports: 100e200/day. Conclusions: Foreign shore exit screening greatly reduces numbers of PI infected passengers. U.S. airport screening identifies 50% infected individuals; efficacy is limited by the asymptomatic PI infected. Screening will not significantly delay arrival of PI via international air transport, but will reduce the rate of new US cases and subsequent deaths. \u00aa a v a i l a b l e a t w w w . s c i e n c e d i r e c t . c o m j o u r n a l h o m e p a g e : w w w . e l s e v i e r h e a l t h . c o m / j o u r n a l s / t m i d Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease (2009) 7, 181e191",

A stochastic discrete event simulation was created to assess screening efficacy, identify cost effective processes, and minimize passenger delays. Discrete event simulations involve probability distributions of a chronological sequence of events and are utilized to improve customer service queues. Diagnostic and treatment options for infected arriving passengers and prophylaxis of plane and traveling companions were also integrated into the simulation. The overall goal of airport screening of internationally arriving passengers is to minimize the peak of pandemic illness (flatten the epidemic curve) within the country, thereby decreasing surge demands on the medical care system and allowing additional time for vaccine development and distribution. In a pandemic with a global world economy, entry of disease into countries is inevitable, but cost effective control measures are certainly possible. The integrated discrete event simulation model is adaptable to other nations with international air terminals and unique flight schedules.",

Ro value assumptions for other regions as follows: Europe Z 2.4, Latin America Z 2.1, Canada and U.S. Z 2.0. Ro values were derived from Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Global Quarantine and Migration, scenarios and Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study (MIDAS) calculations. 1 The integrated stochastic discrete event passenger process simulation involved probabilities of infected states of passengers over time (not infected, infected with PI, infected with other respiratory illness), number and originating location of international air flights arriving to the 18 U.S. airport ports of entry, and screening process decision points (Fig. 2) . Additional detailed methodology on the simulation is available. 2 The arriving international passenger screening process for U.S. airports utilized in this study is detailed in Fig. 3 . The time period of 100 days from the initial start of the global pandemic was chosen for greatest efficacy of screening; once the epidemic has been significantly established within a country, continuing to supply extensive resources to screen international travelers for a relatively low number of newly arriving cases will not significantly affect the epidemic curve within a country.",

The graph is bimodal, a majority of the passengers in the first peak are from Asia where the pandemic initiates; a majority of passengers in the second peak originate in Europe. The second peak is larger as many more international flights to the United States originate in Europe.

More infected passengers (includes true positives and the highest number of false negatives) are introduced into the system e (peak day 45e1600 arrive), even if only 50% of the predicted infected population of passengers carrying virus elect air travel, attempting compliance with isolation and quarantine guidelines.

In scenario 3, screening effectiveness at embarkation point is relatively low (<50%), resulting in more infected passengers enroute, despite 50% compliance with isolation and quarantine guidelines with a decreased number of potentially infected electing not to fly. Even though screening efficacy is lower at the point of U.S. entry in scenario 3, more infected passenger board planes for travel to the U.S. and the distribution of true positives is similar.",

In pandemic influenza, the infected/undetected e false negatives (FN) e are of greatest concern as they are not isolated and treated, thereby spreading infection upon arrival. Also their travel companions and airplane contacts during the confined 8e12 h long transcontinental air flight are not identified for prophylaxis and quarantine. The ability to identify FN passengers is realistically low (only 6%) in our model as passengers would have to voluntarily selfidentify themselves as having a known high risk exposure after commencing travel. Fig. 6 depicts the false negatives by scenario with a similar bimodal peak to the total number of PI infected arriving international passengers. The significantly reduced <50% detection ability (low sensitivity) in scenario 3 results in a higher number of false negative passengers. The high 80% detection rates for symptomatic individuals in scenarios 1 and 2 result in similar curves, with scenario 2 having more individuals due to a higher prevalence (100% of passengers that could be infected with PI or other respiratory illness) embarking for transcontinental air travel. The false negative passenger numbers predicted were transferred to the EpiCast simulation model to identify impact of untreated and not isolated passengers on the diffusion of the epidemic within the U.S. The impact of screening of arriving international travelers at U.S. airports by scenario is detailed in Table 1 . The impact of a 45-day delay in the epidemic due to early and accurate airport screening, allowing an effective vaccine to be developed and distributed, is also depicted. In scenario 1, with high (80% symptomatic) detection rates and 50% compliance with isolation and quarantine restrictions for international travelers, the U.S. attack rate is reduced from 30.7% to 30.4% e this represents an estimated 867,000 fewer people becoming ill in the U.S. population and 17,000 fewer deaths, assuming a 2% case-fatality rate. With the possibility of a 45-day delay in this scenario allowing for development of an effective vaccine, there are 1.3 million fewer cases and 25,800 fewer deaths in 100 days of the epidemic.",

Scenario 2 with high (80%) detection rates and no passenger compliance with isolation and quarantine subsequently showed the highest prophylaxis requirement e 25 million week long antiviral courses at 30 contacts per identified infected passenger and 8.8 million week long courses at 10 travel contacts. Along with personal protective equipment including N95 masks, professional healthcare workers in the airport screening environment, especially those obtaining respiratory specimens, should be on antiviral prophylaxis; 8000 week long courses are estimated for prophylactic coverage of 736 individuals staffing 18 airports for 12 weeks (Fig. 9) . Prioritization of these healthcare workers for receiving an effective pandemic vaccine may minimize the need for antiviral prophylaxis.",

Inhalation of as few as three infective particles can transmit infection and young children are most likely to be infected and spread disease. 5 Actual data on the risk of influenza transmission in airplanes is sparse and primarily provided by several outbreaks. In 1979, an airplane undergoing ventilation system repairs was grounded on the tarmac and 54 passengers were confined for several hours with the doors closed and no ventilation. 6 A 72% influenza attack rate occurred from 1 infected passenger and the secondary attack rate in families of passengers within 2 weeks was estimated to be 20%. Although this case involved older airplane ventilation technology, the high transmission rate was attributed to the 3 h delay while an inoperative ventilation system underwent repair with passengers confined and doors closed. In today's congested air travel system, several hours of tarmac delays occur with varying procedures that decrease cabin ventilation by not operating fuel consuming jet engines. In October 2008, of 554,325 total U.S. carrier flights for the month, of those that were finally cancelled or diverted, three had tarmac delays of over 4 h and 9 of more than 3 h. 7 An air travel outbreak of Influenza A was reported among military members at a U.S. Naval Air Station in 1989. Passenger transmission occurred on the ground and aboard two DC 9 aircrafts with a 37% attack rate among a 114 person air squadron. 8 In 1999 with more modern aircraft, 20 passengers were infected with influenza like illness on a 3 h flight in a 75-seat passenger jet in Australia. 9 Although 9 cases were clustered within 3 rows of the index case that coughed and sneezed throughout the flight, cases were noted in the first and last rows of the passenger compartment and in a passenger that circulated selling raffle tickets. With the 2003 SARS coronavirus, a passenger with fever and cough on a 737e300 with nearly completely full capacity of 120 people during a 3 h flight probably infected 22 individuals, 8 were seated within three rows of the patient, but cases were diffused throughout the plane including two flight attendants. 10 The number of secondary cases may have involved over 300 individuals.",

Tuberculosis exposure evaluation of passengers with active disease in flights over 8 h is recommended to include the two adjacent rows front and back of the suspected case. 11, 12 Droplet transmission requiring close contact is commonly cited for influenza, but more diffusing airborne transmission of smaller virus particles is certainly possible, especially in closely confined spaces, hence the requirement for N95 masks for healthcare workers. Modern commercial airliners with ceiling to floor air flow patterns create very strong counter rotating air currents in cross-section along the rows and minimize air flow in a longitudinal direction within the plane. 13 This results in 20e30 Air Changes per Hour (ACH) e typical indoor environment is 5 ACH e with High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filtered air that removes 99.97% of particles. The recirculated air has a very low humidity of 10e20%, which is conducive to highly efficient influenza virus transmission. 14 Advanced Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) models have delineated transmission of infectious respiratory particles across an entire airplane row within 16 s of a sneeze or cough due to the strong cross-sectional counter rotating air flows. 15 CFD modeling of airborne transmission on a longitudinal axis throughout the airplane is much more difficult as significant variations in local airflows result in local contaminant spread. 16 Infected passenger locations and seating patterns have little impact on longitudinal contamination, specifically; longitudinal patterns in business and economy are similar, while first class is highly variable due to different seating designs resulting in asymmetric flow patterns. Galleys have a major effect on longitudinal flow. Although respiratory transmission is most common, influenza can exist on surfaces for 24e48 h and the low humidity (10e20%) is generally beneficial for viral growth. 18, 19 Data on potential influenza transmission from surface contact, especially in small multiple use airplane lavatories, is minimal. 20 Careful epidemiologic investigations to understand the frequency and relative importance of different modes of transmission for specific pathogens utilizing advanced multiplexing PCR assay techniques are necessary. 21 Aircrews are at greater risk for influenza like illness than the general population. Brazilian aircrews had a 33% attack rate in influenza unvaccinated individuals (compared to 10% of the general population) and vaccinated aircrew members had 40% fewer episodes of influenza like illness. 17 The risk of influenza to flight attendants in close passenger contact is most likely elevated; in the reported outbreaks, several flight attendants were infected. Pilots on large transcontinental planes have a dedicated separate cockpit air supply and usually minimal passenger contact. To maintain their operational status and minimize potential for spreading influenza to their native country, select international airline crews may be candidates for early receipt of pandemic influenza vaccine.",
