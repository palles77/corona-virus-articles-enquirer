Microbiol., Leukocytes were harvested from the peripheral blood, mesenteric lymph node and small intestinal lamina propria from groups of three piglets before, and 1,2 and 3 weeks after infection with virulent transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) at 2 weeks of age. The donor piglets developed clinical signs of transmissible gastroenteritis which persisted for up to 3 days, and they developed peak serum titres of TGEV-neutralizing antibodies 2 weeks post-infection. The leukocytes were cultured in the presence of pokeweed mitogen (PWM), various dilutions of purified TGEV, or control media for 3 or 5 days, and the culture supernatants were tested for antiviral activity in MDBK cells challenged with vesicular stomatitis virus. The antiviral activity was characterized as porcine interferon (IFN)or porcine IFN-r on the basis of its stability at pH 2.0 and neutralization by anti-human IFN-a antibodies. Viability of the leukocytes in culture, determined by trypan blue exclusion, was highest for the peripheral blood leukocytes and lowest for the mesenteric lymph node leukocytes. There were no consistent differences in antiviral activity between cultures incubated for 3 or 5 days. Porcine IFN-c~ was found in the supernatants of the leukocyte cultures stimulated with TGEV antigen, harvested before or after infection of the donor piglets with TGEV. Porcine IFN-z was demonstrated in the supernatants of the leukocyte cultures stimulated with PWM, more frequently when the leukocytes were harvested post-infection. This was the first demonstration of IFN induction in vitro in leukocytes from porcine gut-associated lymphoid tissue.",

La Bonnardirre and Laude ( 1981, 1983 ) demonstrated high levels of interferon (IFN) early in experimental TGE in the blood and intestine of newborn piglets, and they suggested that the IFN might have arisen from the enterocytes in the small intestine. In subsequent studies however, La Bonnardirre et al. ( 1986 ) identified the IFN as leukocytic IFN or porcine IFN-ol, but the tissue source of the IFN was not determined. It is well established that porcine IFN-o~ can be induced in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) by a variety of viruses (reviewed by Weingartl and Derbyshire, 1990) and in the case of TGEV it was shown by Charley and Laude ( 1988 ) that IFN induction was associated with an interaction of the viral transmembrane E 1 or M glycoprotein with the PBL cell membrane. In a recent study, Charley and Lavenant (1990) characterized the blood mononuclear cells which produced porcine IFN-a in response to induction with TGEV as non-phagocytic, non-adherent, non-T, non-B, CD4 + MHC-class-II-positive cells.",

Porcine IFN-a induced in the LP would be highly accessible to the cryptal enterocytes, in which it might induce an antiviral state and hence contribute to recovery from the infection. Weingartl and Derbyshire (1991) demonstrated the antiviral activity of porcine IFN-a against TGEV in porcine intestinal explant and intestinal epithelial cell cultures. An indirect antiviral activity of porcine IFN-a induced in the LP might be mediated by activation of NK cells among the intraepithelial lymphocytes, which may contribute to resistance against TGE (Cepica and Derbyshire, 1984b) . Conversely, porcine IFN-a induced in LP leukocytes could contribute to the pathogenesis of TGE by reducing the replacement rate of enterocytes, since it is well recognized that IFN may have an antiproliferative effect (Tamm et al., 1987 ) , and Laude and La Bonnadi6re (1984) described a cytocidal effect of porcine IFN-a on porcine renal epithelial cells.",

However, the donor piglets mounted a strong immune response as indicated by the appearance of high levels of circulating TGEV antibodies, and studies elsewhere have demonstrated sensitized T-lymphocytes in the LP (Frederick and Bohl, 1976) and MLN (Shimizu and Shimizu, 1979a; of pigs infected with TGEV. It is possible that small amounts of porcine IFN-z in these culture supernatants may have been undetectable in the presence of an excess of porcine IFN-a, or that the latter may have inhibited the proliferative response of sensitized T-lymphocytes upon exposure to antigen which is necessary for IFN-z production. For the induction of porcine IFN-z with TGEV antigen it would be prudent to exclude the highly interferonogenic M glycoprotein of the virus, and use purified S glycoprotein for in vitro stimulation, Our findings demonstrated the ability of GALT lymphocytes to produce porcine IFN-r in response to stimulation with PWM. The titres produced were relatively low, and higher levels might have been induced with phytohaemagglutinin, which is more frequently used for IFN-z induction since it is a more potent T-cell mitogen (Kristensen et al., 1982 ) . We used PWM because we were also attempting to stimulate antibody production in the leukocyte cultures (Naidoo, 1990) , and PWM is mitogenic for B-cells as well as T-cells (Kristensen et al., 1982) . It was of interest that more cultures responded to porcine IFN-z induction with PWM when the leukocytes were harvested from piglets which had been infected with TGEV. The peak responses to PWM were in cultures containing leukocytes harvested 2 weeks post-infection, which corresponded to the peak antibody response to the infection. also found peak blastogenic responses to TGEV antigen with lymphocytes from the blood and MLN harvested between 6 and 14 days after exposure of the donors to virulent virus. In the present study, the increased responsiveness of the leukocytes to PWM after infection may have been due to a relative increase in the number of T-lymphocytes in response to the infection.",
