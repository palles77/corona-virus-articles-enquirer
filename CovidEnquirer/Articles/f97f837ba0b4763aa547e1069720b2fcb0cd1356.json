This surveillance has mostly taken the form of ad hoc surveys, or has focused on adverse reactions to vaccines and other pharmaceuticals. Most of these activities have not included an ongoing measurement of the population using comparable methods, so strictly do not meet our current understanding of disease surveillance. A notably exception is surveillance for rabies, for which passive surveillance systems exist (for example, see Blanton et al., 2006; Tenzin et al., 2010 Tenzin et al., , 2011 .",

This research program was initiated using data from the Veterinary Medical Database (VMDB). The VMDB was established in North America in 1964 by the National Cancer Institute to collect, store, and retrieve veterinary clinical information (Hayes et al., 1997; Priester, 1977) . It contains a standardized abstract of every animal examined at participating veterinary teaching hospitals in the United States and Canada. At the time of initiation of this study, 24 veterinary teaching hospitals in the United States and Canada had contributed data (Ward et al., 2002) . Results showed a clear trend in increasing diagnoses of canine leptospirosis, suggesting this to be a re-emerging zoonosis. However, because the VMDB is a secondary data source, data analysis was limited to those covariates recorded in the VMDB, and results might be subject to diagnostic bias and might not necessarily represent the target population. For spatial analyses (Ward, 2002a) , research was limited to the location of the hospitals reporting the cases. Later, data generated within a specific veterinary teaching hospital data management system was integrated (using a geographic information system) with data generated from a state veterinary laboratory accession management system to conduct more focused research on spatial distribution and risk factors (Ward et al., 2004a,b) . This allowed recommendations to be made to reduce the impact of this epidemic of leptospirosis. However, integrating databases and data cleaning, error checking and validation consumed a considerable amount of time, and the system could not identify new trends in near-real time. A critical gap identified was database integration and analytical methodologies that could be applied routinely.",

(2006a) developed a surveillance system that utilized electronic medical records from a large corporate small animal general practice in the United States, in which each of more than 400 hospital locations in this system used the same computerized medical record system. Records of dogs receiving a range of vaccines (including for Bordetella, coronavirus, multivalent distemper-adenovirus-parainfluenza-parvovirus-leptospirosis, Giardia and rabies) were extracted and searched for adverse reactions. Using the collective data recording of these hospitals, 4678 adverse events were identified during a 2-year period, representing 3,439,576 doses of vaccine administered to 1,226,159 dogs. The use of veterinary practice databases to complement spontaneous reporting systems for vaccine safety is one example of recent advances in companion animal disease surveillance (Moore et al., 2006b) . This system has also been used as a research tool to identify space-time clusters of adverse events associated with canine rabies vaccine (Moore et al., 2005) .",

A goal of such a system is improved veterinary care, and it could be also used to develop evidence-based veterinary practices. Data derived from a surveillance system could provide fundamental information regarding disease incidence, prevalence, transmission, and risk factors. Such an enhanced understanding of disease epidemiology would enable practitioners to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments and intervention programmes. Such a system could also facilitate industry-supported pharmaco-epidemiological studies and post-market surveillance, which would enable the development of safer and more effective veterinary products.",

In January 2010, Virbac Animal Health in Australia launched Disease Watch-Dog, a prospective national disease surveillance project, to capture data on communicable disease cases and outbreaks, with the ultimate aim of the reduction and control infectious diseases in cats and dogs. This project is unique as it involves a growing number of participants, and as well as gathering data, encourages participation by providing benefits to registrants including real-time maps of disease occurrences and outbreaks, material for improved communication between veterinarians and clients, and empowerment of staff. From January to mid-November, an estimated 31% of veterinary clinics Australia-wide have joined the project, with >1300 cases of disease reported. While the project is still in its infancy, the analysis of initial data is demonstrating some important findings with respect to disease distributions in space and time and risk factors, and there is considerable potential to gather vital information that could lead to targeted vaccination and treatment efforts which could be the key to the control of various diseases. In this paper we report details of this surveillance tool and illustrate its utility with a case study of canine parvovirus (CPV) occurrence and distribution during a 9-month period in the state of New South Wales. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the feasibility of surveillance in pet animal populations, and to highlight the value of spatial analysis of such surveillance data.",

A new facility to search by radius around a suburb, providing more relevant information on the diseases in the user's area and allowing improved mapping. This facility could also be useful for research studies to identify risk factors for disease occurrence. 3. A feature to allow multiple diseases to be displayed by assigning different colors to each disease, so that multiple diseases can be shown simultaneously. More information on diseases in a suburb can be obtained by the user simply by clicking on a colored flag placed at the suburb location. Displaying multiple diseases allows practices and their clients to visualize which diseases are prevalent in their specific area. 4. Tick paralysis data has been added to Disease Watch-Dog. Tick paralysis is an acute, progressive ascending motor paralysis. It is caused by a salivary neurotoxin produced by some species of ticks. In Australia Ixodes holocyclus is the principle cause of cases of tick paralysis in domestic animals. This tick species can be found on native animals along the east coast of Australia. Reported distribution of tick paralysis has previously been mostly anecdotal. Inclusion of tick paralysis in Disease WatchDog allows for the first time the spatial and temporal distribution of this important disease to be monitored in Australia. Recording tick paralysis cases will enable veterinarians to alert clients to the dangers of ticks in specific areas, and also whether tick paralysis is seasonal in their area and the importance of tick prevention and awareness. 5. Two more infectious diseases were added to the Disease WatchDog list; the distribution of FeLV and feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) can now be monitored. These diseases were chosen as the next additions because of their apparent lower prevalence, but higher mortality.",

Although CPV first appeared in the late 1970s as a pandemic (Johnson and Spradbrow, 1979; Walker et al., 1980) and other epidemics have been reported (Sabine et al., 1984) , the spatial distribution, seasonality and risk factors for CPV are not well understood. In a questionnaire survey of veterinary practitioners in Australia and New Zealand seeking details of their experience with CPV infections in 1980, Sabine et al. (1982) found that explosive outbreaks of disease had occurred in most parts of Australia in that year. No obvious pattern of spread over the continent could be detected. An overall mortality rate of 16% was estimated. In a serological survey, Smith et al. (1980) found that CPV was generally a disease of dogs less than 6 months of age. The current analysis focuses on the spatial distribution of this disease, as a case study of the application of the Disease WatchDog surveillance system. Data extracted from Disease WatchDog included date of diagnosis and the residential postcode. For the purposes of demonstration, data selected was restricted to reported cases occurring between 1 January and 30 September, 2010 in the state of New South Wales.",

However, it was assumed that during the 9-month study period the distribution of the population of dogs would have remained stable across postcodes.

For example, in the United States the system for rabies surveillance is well-developed and based on the reporting of cases (usually accompanied by submission of diagnostic samples) to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. However, even in this system, the focus is cases in wildlife, rather than companion animals (for example, in 2005 approximately 92% of the cases were in wildlife, and 8% were in domestic animals; Blanton et al., 2006) . Other studies have used a surveillance-like design. For example, Biggeri et al. (2006) used a 2-stage sampling design, with first stage transects, to study the risk of dog parasitic infections in the city of Naples, Italy, during 2004-2005. This system focused on zoonotic parasitic diseases, including infections with Trichuris, Isospora, Toxascaris, Ancylostoma and Toxocara. However, the study apparently was driven by a research goal and not as an ongoing effort, thus, not strictly matching the definition of surveillance. Other initiatives have used existing hospital management systems as a secondary data source for monitoring diseases in companion animal populations. For example, Moore et al. (2005) used databases complied by Banfield, The Pet Hospital corporation in the United States to describe several diseases. Development of a disease surveillance system for companion animal disease as a primary objective apparently has not been successfully undertaken previously.",

Disease WatchDog is unique in its flexibility and ability to be modified in response to suggestions by those who use the system.

            "text": "The Blue Ribbon Panel also identified four fundamental principles relevant to the design of a companion animal surveillance system: syndromic versus disease-specific surveillance; the ability to leverage existing systems; predefined response protocols; and integration with other health surveillance systems. Syndromic surveillance involves collection of information on clinical syndromestwo or more characteristic clinical signs. Disease Watchdog is based on the diagnosis and reporting of specific disease, rather than syndromes. Expansion of Disease WatchDog to include syndromes (for example, vomiting and diarrhea) could be implemented with comparative ease. However, such a modification would need to be driven by the endusers, which are primarily veterinary practices. In the case of CPV, a substantial proportion (64%) of cases was diagnosed using the Snap ELISA. In this situation, reporting cases based on syndrome might not provide additional benefit to the end-user. In contrast, cases of tick paralysis are generally diagnosed based on clinical signs (for exam-ple, between 1 and 30 September the 138 reported cases of tick paralysis were diagnosed based on clinical presentation (29%), tick found (70%) or tick crater only found (1%)). Tick paralysis was added to Disease WatchDog in September 2010 in response to requests from end-users of the system. For an applied surveillance system such as Disease WatchDog, the usefulness of syndromic surveillance needs to be assessed in partnership with the enduser. Acute CPV enteritis can reportedly occur in dogs of any breed, age, or sex. However, puppies between 6 weeks and 6 months of age appear to be more susceptible (Goddard and Leisewitz, 2010 ). In the current study the median (interquartile range) age of reported cases was 16 (8-24) months. This finding was unexpected, based on previous statements regarding the age pre-disposition for CPV. Of those cases with reported vaccination status, only 27% of cases were vaccinated. This might, in part, explain a higher age of cases than expected. However, the common belief amongst veterinarians that CPV is a disease of puppies may need revision, following further research using data generated by Disease WatchDog. Some breeds -mostly large breeds such as Rottweiler, Doberman Pinscher, Labrador retriever and German shepherd dog -have been reported to be more at risk for severe CPV enteritis (Goddard and Leisewitz, 2010) . None of these breeds were commonly reported to be cases in the current study. However, the proportion of a breed in a population -and the proportion that are presented at veterinary clinics -needs to be taken into account before breed predisposition can be determined. Goddard and Leisewitz (2010) state that the risk of CPV in sexually intact males is twice that of sexually intact females. In the current study more reported cases were male than female, but the difference was small (56% versus 44%). Half of all cases were reported between 7 March and 18 June, which represents the autumn months. Generally CPV is considered to peak in summer (Goddard and Leisewitz, 2010) . As more data is accumulated in Disease WatchDog, a more accurate description of seasonality can be made. Many clusters of CPV were identified during the short 9-month study period in New South Wales. Such a spatial distribution of cases is likely to indicate that local factors are important, generating local epidemics. Follow-up studies, using larger datasets, might be able to identify some of these factors. Based on preliminary analysis, apparently vaccination practice is unlikely to explain most of these clusters.",

            "text": "There are three specific design elements for a companion animal surveillance system (Stone and Hautala, 2008) : target population; data collection, analysis and standards; and mechanisms for dissemination of results. The system must have a clearly defined target population. This is necessary so that the disease frequency estimated can be referred to a defined population. In Disease WatchDog, the target population is comprised of veterinary practices that report disease cases. This is a subset (currently nearly onethird) of all practices in Australia, the reference population. 'All practices in Australia' is a well-defined population, since practices need to be licensed by the relevant state or territory authority where they operate. A current gap in Disease Watchdog is that the population of dogs and cats (and their demographics -such as age, breed and gender distributions) -is unknown. Such data -when available -is for specific locations only (Toribio et al., 2010) . This information could potentially be collected within the Disease WatchDog system, for example by having contributors annually describe their practice caseload during the previous 12 months, or by estimating the likely population at-risk based on the proportions of cases reported, and potentially informed by known covariates (for example human population size and socioeconomic status) within the practice area. Variable Disease Watch-Dog adoption proportions for different Australian Statescurrently ranging from 20% in Victoria to 40% in New South Wales -means that inferring the impact of disease in different areas needs to be done with caution.",

A current barrier to disease surveillance is an inability to rapidly and validly integrate different surveillance systems. The barrier is usually a lack of consistency in the scale (spatial, temporal) at which data is recorded, a lack of standard case definitions (e.g. method of diagnosis, method of measurement) and differences in which auxiliary data is recorded (e.g. animal data such as age, gender, breed and population demographic data -the 'population at-risk'). Identifying key surveillance systems and key individuals, an agreement on standards that should be used could be reached. An analogy is the recent development of the REFLECT statement: methods and processes of creating reporting Fig. 5 . The distribution of spatio-temporal clusters of cases of canine parvovirus reported in the Disease WatchDog surveillance system between January and September 2010 in New South Wales, Australia. Clusters were detected using the scan statistic permutation test, with spatial scanning windows up to 20 km radius and temporal scanning windows up to 28 days in length. guidelines for randomized control trials for livestock and food safety (O'Connor et al., 2010) .",

There is a lack of consistency regarding which tools should be applied routinely, and also a lack of knowledge of the performance of the different tools applied to different types of surveillance data. As above, agreement is needed in order to correctly evaluate the results of analysis of surveillance data. To our knowledge, results of the analysis of the spatial distribution of CPV cases have not been published in the peer-reviewed literature. A likely barrier is the lack of large, good quality surveillance datasets. Disease Watch-Dog fills that gap: in New South Wales alone, 552 cases were reported during just 9 months. Considering the lack of knowledge of spatial distribution of CPV and the lack of knowledge of the population at-risk within each postcode, we used the permutation model. The model does not require any assumptions to be made with respect to how the population at-risk is characterized. The only assumption is that the population at-risk remains relatively stabile during the study period. As more analyses are undertaken of the spatial distribution of diseases in pet populations, analytical approaches are likely to be refined.",
