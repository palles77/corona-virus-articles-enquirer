In the United States, CAP is the most frequent cause of death resulting from infectious diseases and is the eighth leading cause of death overall. The mortality rate of patients treated on an outpatient basis is <1%; for those who require admission to the hospital, it averages 12% but increases to 30% to 40% for those with severe CAP who require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). The overall rate of CAP ranges from 8 to 15 per 1000 persons per year; the highest rates are at the extremes of age. More cases occur during the winter months. The economic cost exceeds $17 billion a year.",

CAP occurs when there is a defect in host defenses, exposure to a particularly virulent microorganism, or an overwhelming inoculum. Other routes for pathogens to the lung are hematogenous spread, direct spread from a contiguous focus, and macroaspiration. There are several predisposing conditions (Box 26-1).",

CA-MRSA is more virulent than the traditional nosocomial MRSA strains, and strains of CA-MRSA tend to be more susceptible to antimicrobial agents than hospital-acquired MRSA strains. The majority of CA-MRSA strains contain a novel type IV staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCCmec) gene and also carry the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) genes, which produce toxins that create lytic pores in cell membranes of neutrophils, inducing release of chemotactic factors that promote inflammation and tissue destruction.

The advantages of not Mortality prediction tools can also help guide clinicians in determining the requirement of hospitalization. The pneumonia prediction rule, developed over 10 years ago, offers important insights into the risk of mortality. This technique uses a combination of demographic variables, comorbidities, physical observations, and laboratory and radiographic variables to assign patients to one of five classes. Those belonging to pneumonia severity index (PSI) class 1 or 2 have a low risk of mortality (<1%) and can be treated as outpatients. Those in PSI class 3 have a slightly higher risk of mortality (<5%) and may require a brief observational stay in a hospital. Those in PSI class 4 or 5 have the highest mortality risk (8% to 40%) and will require hospitalization; those in PSI class 5 should be admitted to an ICU. Though the PORT prediction rule is effective in determining mortality risk, it is not the most practical approach in the clinical setting as it is partly based on laboratory evaluations that can be time-consuming.",

Pseudomonas is an uncommon cause of CAP but should be considered with the following risk factors: history of bronchiectasis or advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with frequent use of antimicrobials or steroids.

Although methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus are still the minority, the excess mortality of inappropriate antibiotic therapy would suggest that empirical coverage should be considered when CA-MRSA is a concern. The best indicator of S. aureus is the presence of gram-positive cocci in clusters in a tracheal aspirate or adequate sputum sample (see Figure 26 -2).

Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and inactivated or live-attenuated influenza vaccine should be considered for all patients according to recent recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Chemoprophylaxis (i.e., oseltamivir or zanamivir), can be used as an adjunct to influenza vaccination. Clinicians should also intervene to modify some of the associated risk factors for pneumonia in adults. Because smoking is a significant risk factor for CAP, smoking cessation should be attempted; this is particularly important and relevant when patients are hospitalized for pneumonia. In addition, stabilization of underlying conditions (e.g., congestive heart failure, diabetes) and promotion of appropriate nutrition may help to reduce the risk of CAP and thereby promote longer and healthier lives.",

If Pseudomonas is a consideration (risk factors include bronchiectasis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with frequent antimicrobial or steroid use):\u2022 An antipneumococcal, antipseudomonal \u03b2-lactam (piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, imipenem, meropenem) plus either ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin (750-mg dose) \u2022 The above \u03b2-lactam plus an aminoglycoside and azithromycin \u2022 The above \u03b2-lactam plus an aminoglycoside and an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone (for patients allergic to penicillin, substitute aztreonam for above \u03b2-lactam) 2. If community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is a consideration, add linezolid or vancomycin. for example, an appropriate culture reveals the isolation of penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae, therapy can be specified by selecting a narrow-spectrum agent (such as penicillin or amoxicillin). This will hopefully reduce the selective pressure for resistance. This information is often available at the time of switch from parenteral to oral therapy and may be used to direct specific antimicrobial choices. ",
