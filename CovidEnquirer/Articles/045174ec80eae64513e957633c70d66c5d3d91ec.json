            "text": "Since the emergence of HIV/AIDS in the 1980s, social scientists and sociologists of health and illness have been exploring the metaphorical framing of this infectious disease in its social context. Many have focused on the militaristic language used to report and explain this illness, a type of language that has permeated discourses of immunology, bacteriology and infection for at least a century. In this article, we examine how language and metaphor were used in the UK media's coverage of another previously unknown and severe infectious disease: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). SARS offers an opportunity to explore the cultural framing of a less extraordinary epidemic disease. It therefore provides an analytical counter-weight to the very extensive body of interpretation that has developed around HIV/AIDS. By analysing the total reporting on SARS of five major national newspapers during the epidemic of spring 2003, we investigate how the reporting of SARS in the UK press was framed, and how this related to media, public and governmental responses to the disease. We found that, surprisingly, militaristic language was largely absent, as was the judgemental discourse of plague. Rather, the main conceptual metaphor used was SARS as a killer. SARS as a killer was a single unified entity, not an army or force. We provide some tentative explanations for this shift in linguistic framing by relating it to local political concerns, media cultures, and spatial factors. r",

This new disease, given the name Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), inspired a major response from the international public health community, as well as from the local governments affected. Although the transmission of SARS was successfully halted in only a few months, it was initially uncertain whether the disease would be controlled, and from the outset SARS was identified and responded to as an exemplary problem of 'emerging infectious disease' to be addressed in a globalized context where medicine, national and international public health, politics and commerce interconnect.",

Most strikingly, coverage of SARS avoided the use of war and plague metaphors, which normally dominate 'control of disease' discourse, instead relying on a combination of killer and control metaphors. This article tries to establish whether the new medical and political configuration of disease features that characterised SARS contributed to new cultural patterns in the reporting of this disease (see Fox & Swazey, 2004) .",

What appeared to be initial outbreaks in Hong Kong and Vietnam led to the WHO initiating an international alert through its new Global Outbreak and Response Network (GOARN), sending in teams to assist local public health services, and organising an international scientific effort to learn about the new disease-which rapidly identified a coronavirus as the biological agent responsible. The vast majority of the 8096 cases and 774 deaths from SARS were in China, but the disease spread to a number of other locations, notably Toronto (251 cases), Singapore (238 cases) and Taiwan (346 cases). After a period of rapid diffusion, outbreaks were contained through a combination of surveillance, quarantine methods and travel bans, beginning with Vietnam (where the end of local transmission was declared on 28 April). Case numbers peaked in May 2003. By 5 July, the last paths of transmission had been broken, and only a small number of individuals were still recovering from the disease.",

This interest in metaphor illustrates the impact of the 'linguistic turn', the emergence of 'cognitive linguistics' (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980; Turner, 2001) , and the influence of critics, notably Susan Sontag, who have emphasised the interdependence of language and stigma in disease since the 1970s. Perhaps the most significant factor, however, is the character of the AIDS epidemic, by far the most widely discussed disease in social and cultural studies. The attention given to the cultural and linguistic framing of AIDS has been a direct response to the stigmatisation faced by those infected, and to the heated debates over the disease in the 1980s and 1990s. The significance of metaphor within this process has been widely analysed with some striking results, for example showing that negative AIDS metaphors can be correlated with the outcome of AIDS-related litigation in the US (Drass, Gregware, & Musheno, 1997; Rollins, 2002) .",

Moreover, to a unique extent, the AIDS epidemic has been marked by the active contestation of language and metaphor.

            "text": "Alongside this work on HIV/AIDS, a broader critique of language in medicine, especially the reliance on particular dominant conceptual metaphors, has developed. Military metaphors have become a particular target in the two decades since they were powerfully anatomised by the critic and writer Susan Sontag (1978 Sontag ( , 1989 in her essays on cancer, tuberculosis and AIDS (Annas, 1995; Patton, 1990: 59-60; Montgomery, 1991; Arrigo, 1999; Worboys, 2000; Gradmann, 2000 , see also Clow, 2001) . During this time, military metaphors have remained abundant. Even the 'war on cancer' that the American president Richard Nixon declared in the 1970s continues (Cox News Service, 2002; Lerner, 2003) . Yet, such militaristic metaphors have drawbacks. Among sufferers, they promote shame and guilt (Sontag, 1978) . Among policymakers and public health officials, '[m]ilitary thinking concentrates on the physical, sees control as central, and encourages the expenditure of massive resources to achieve dominance' (Annas, 1995: 746) . They can even arguably make it easier to 'sacrifice people and their rights' (Ross, 1986: 18) . The consequences of this type of discourse can also be seen in comparable non-medical contexts, such as the disastrous UK response to the foot and mouth epidemic in 2001 (Nerlich, 2004) . One result of these concerns about military metaphors has been a series of calls to replace them with more attractive alternative metaphors. Annas proposes an 'ecological framework'; Sontag suggests a more absolute stripping away of metaphor altogether. What Sherwin described as 'choosing politically liberating metaphors' has become a widespread and urgent concern (Sherwin, 2001: 343; Treichler, 1992) .",

Largely arriving on the back of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, it is oriented towards the rich and controversial language usages elicited by that disease. AIDS' predominance in studies of metaphor is by no means exclusive: cancer, heart disease, tuberculosis and cholera have all been closely studied, if largely from patient narratives (Seale, 2001; Nations & Monte, 1996; Weiss, 1997; Gibbs & Franks, 2002 ). Yet little attention has been given to the wider social framing of diseases which have not attracted dramatic metaphorisation, particularly fast-moving, new infectious diseases, such as SARS. Only a few studies have emerged on Ebola, SARS and similar diseases (Unger, 1998; Washer, 2004 ). Sontag's suggestion that 'diseases understood to be simply epidemic have become less useful as metaphors' (1989: 72, emphasis added) may explain the neglect of such diseases by some researchers. However, given the narrow empirical basis of current arguments about language and policy, it is important to examine what effects metaphors have had in framing such diseases, and whether they present the same problems identified in HIV/AIDS or in broader critiques of militarism within medicine.",

The first stories appeared in The Mirror, The Guardian and The Daily Mail on 17 March, five days after the WHO issued its first alert.

Instead, the qualitative method standard in linguistic metaphor studies was used, with adaptations to deal with the size of the corpus. This was based on two complete readings of the total corpus by separate researchers. On the first reading, qualitative research software was used to mark-up metaphors and repetitive tropes and outline a map of linguistic patterns and frequency. The second read through took the form of a structured reading of articles, with pieces from all newspapers read in sequence in seven-day blocs to establish chronological patterns and linguistic developments through the development of the corpus.",

For example, in the killer metaphors discussed below, a metaphor system is developed that exploits various well-known features of 'killers' (they stalk, they strike, they are mysterious, they are criminals) and are through them linked to other metaphors, such as SARS IS A CRIMINAL (it has to be detected, traced, hunted down, etc.) and SARS IS A MYSTERIOUS ENTITY.

Newspapers equivocated between presenting SARS as a major danger and dismissing it as a panic. Conscious and unconscious issues of language choice ran throughout this. The rumbling debate about the significance of SARS in part took the form of constant questioning about the appropriate epidemiological terminology for the outbreak: was it an epidemic, a pandemic, or neither?

It is significant that Vietnam had a major early success in controlling the epidemic using a quarantine-based approach. Indeed, conflict of any kind was limited: pressure groups were largely absent; there was no significant scientific debate about SARS in the public sphere, with few rival theories in the West to challenge the WHO laboratory network's conclusions.

What makes this lack of war metaphors most striking is the coincidence between SARS and the Iraq war. Stories about SARS largely lacked connections to this war, or the 'war on terror'.

With things it could or did not kill, SARS was framed as a physical assault: it 'slams' shares, 'hurt' businesses, 'hammered' corporations, 'knocked' profits, 'damaged' states, and 'gripped' cities. Above all, SARS hit. 1 It was 'hitting' regions, countries, companies, airlines, stock-markets, or the economy generally. Tourism was 'the world's punchbag'; airlines were 'SARS-battered'. As a result, SARS had an impactthe second most common term after hit. The same fight metaphors appeared regularly in descriptions of SARS' physical impact on individuals. SARS is 'attacking their lungs', people are 'struck down', and 'fighting to survive'. SARS is here conceptualised as a physical force. This metaphor is based on the 'force schema' (an image schema that involves physical or metaphorical causal interaction), one of the many image schemas that, according to Lakoff and Johnson (1980: 40) , provide the embodied bases for conceptual metaphors.",

Comparable concerns about news value are manifest in the use of mystery metaphors (mysterious pneumonia', 'elusive virus', or 'mystery bug'), particularly in early broadsheet reports. Newspapers also used various common natural disaster metaphors to interpret SARS's progress on a global or regional scale. The most ubiquitous was SARS IS A FIRE ('burns out'). Others included earthquakes ('the disease's epicentre'), and, more rarely, volcanoes (SARS 'erupted') and storms ('eye of SARS storm'). SARS was thus linked to historical images of the stalking mysterious killer, to exemplars of modernity, the jet-set age and globalisation, and to generic natural disasters.

This can be seen in the changes to the framing of responsibility that occurred when the disease seemed closer. The dominant Killer metaphor gave SARS an 'active' role. It was a free agent responsible for its actions; those it infects were passive, blameless victims. This pattern of responsibility differs from the emphasis on individual culpability apparent in the blame and stigma linked with AIDS, syphilis and some other diseases. However, where people infected with SARS threatened to bring the disease into the country an alternative metaphor system-DISEASE IS A POSSESSION-was often used, particularly in the tabloid press. In this metaphorical schema, people catch, carry, pick up, get, have, bring, acquire or contract disease, which is a burden they have got, and can give or pass on to others, unless they are relieved of it or have it taken away. It emphasises individual culpability in disease. In the SARS coverage, it blended with similarly valenced grammatical forms, in which the sick person became the active agent in their illness (person X becomes or falls ill; is or becomes infected with or by Y). A good example is The Daily Mail report on the 'First Briton to get 'flu' killer bug in the UK': a person who 'contracts' SARS, and 'becomes infected', although the virus remains a 'killer' (14/4/03). Other newspapers used headlines such as: 'Fifth Briton Brings Home Deadly Virus', and 'Nurses In Alert' ''Not Likely'' To Have SARS'. Thus, when SARS became an immediate threat the 'victim' became a 'carrier' or 'case': a danger, rather than an object of compassion.",

Early in the epidemic, it was rare to find references to SARS having a centre, heart, or core. Without knowledge of its origins, and with doubts about events in China, SARS had borders but no obvious middle for much of March and April. It was from the outset a disease of many places. In this lay its threat. The most obvious symptom of this was the lack of a localising name, such as West Nile Fever or Lyme Disease. SARS was virtually never framed as Hong Kong syndrome or Guangdong flu.

In contrast to suggestions that SARS was quickly identified and defused by 'othering' through identification as a Chinese disease (Washer, 2004), we found that in the broader sample we analysed SARS was only weakly identified as a problem of a definable 'other'.

Framing responses to SARS in a discourse of bureaucratic control drew on a long tradition in which public health as 'medical police' is a function of the civil state similar to the other kinds of 'policing' it carries out (Jordanova, 1980; Porter, 1999) . Ideas of police ran throughout the limited repertoire of traditional public health techniques used to halt SARS. Quarantines of the infected and their contacts, and surveillance of travellers were the two most important methods used against SARS, with travel bans imposed by some countries. 4 The relationship to policing was clear: governments promised 'to hold victims', 'detain SARS sufferers', identify 'those suspected of harbouring the virus'.

Two systems were particularly important. A Killer metaphor system was commonly used to discuss the nature of SARS, its local and human impact, and individual responses. The institutional and national impact of SARS and the responses it elicited were largely framed through a bureaucratic discourse of management and a balance metaphor-dyad of controlled/uncontrolled. Struggle metaphors were also heavily used to describe the human and economic impacts of SARS; a range of other metaphors and analogical frames appeared occasionally. Overall, these metaphors and historical framings were limited, fragmented and somewhat hackneyed. They are a marked contrast to the richness of writing and reporting required to explain more novel scientific, medical or natural events such as clones or invasive species (see Nerlich, Clarke, & Dingwall, 1999; Larson, Nerlich, & Wallis, forthcoming) .",

For example, AIDS as sin was employed to describe cause (divine judgement), attitude to sufferer (sinner), and individual and public policy responses (repentance, abstinence, moral education). By contrast, the metaphor system we have described shares some characteristics with patterns identified in coverage of Ebola and other analyses of SARS (Unger, 1998; Washer, 2004) . Unger has identified a shift in Ebola coverage from a 'mutation-contagion' package, the content of which includes the story aspects we found most closely related to the Killer metaphor system, to a 'containment' package, which has parallels to the bureaucratic control discourse we discuss. However, where Unger and Washer interpret this as a single news discourse that frightens then reassures, we find that the two metaphor systems co-exist in parallel, serving quite separate needs and prompted by different sources and intentions (see also Joffe & Haarhoff, 2002) .",

            "text": "There has been some debate over the degree to which metaphors of disease tend to be contradictory (Weiss, 1997; Gibbs & Franks, 2002) . In this case, the conflict is clear, but is the result of the structural context rather than psychology. The existence of different metaphor systems used in the description of specific aspects of SARS can be understood as intimately related to tensions between public concerns and anxieties surrounding the disease entity, the habitual pressures on the media to convey the news values of stories, and the limits on political and public health options and governments' willingness to act. Several aspects of this relationship are particularly clear from the analysis above. News values are most obvious in the prominence of the 'SARS Killer' metaphor system and the alternate disaster metaphors, and in the striking shift to DIS-EASE IS A POSSESSION metaphors when SARS seemed most threatening. More suggestive and surprising is the media's avoidance of overt marginalisation, where feedback from AIDS coverage may be having an effect. The relationship between governmental responses and the media coverage is at one level more direct, as is apparent from journalist's reiteration of bureaucratic control metaphors employed initially in government and WHO briefings. However, it also may be fundamentally related to the striking lack of militaristic metaphors. This seems to contradict research into the use of 'media templates' or the use of standard narrative and metaphorical conventions that structure the media reporting of medical issues (see Kitzinger, 2000; Miller, Kitzinger, Williams, & Beharrell, 1998; Seale, 2003) and therefore needs some explanation.",

            "text": "The glaring absence from SARS coverage was the militaristic metaphors that have long been seen as prime features of discourses of bioscience and disease. The immediate context of war in Iraq may have played a part in this, pushing commentators to create distinctive discursive systems for the two stories. However, three aspects of the development of SARS as a political issue made it particularly unsuitable for framing as a war. First, the international response to SARS lacked a 'general' as SARS' rapid transmission to several countries meant it was not 'owned' by any single originating nation. The closest thing to a leader was the WHO. However, it faced tight limits as an advisory and coordinating institution, and the difficulties it experienced in negotiating access to China made it essential for it to avoid claiming authority over affected countries. Consistently, the WHO presented itself as 'working with' or 'supporting' national authorities in a 'collaborative effort' and 'partnership'. This also meant that there was no point at which war on SARS was declared. Second, in the UK, SARS was largely a distant, international story. The UK government needed to avoid panic, not call on national solidarity or quash dissentboth areas where militaristic metaphors can help. Third, the effort against SARS did not promise to end in a clear victory. Framing SARS as a problem of control reflected a general uncertainty which AIDS has fostered about the effect that governments can have on epidemic diseases. The aspiration to contain, rather than eradicate, SARS, lacks the optimism of the war on cancer of the 1960s and 1970s. SARS is unlikely to represent a milestone in some discursive retreat from the war metaphoric. War will no doubt continue to dominate the discourses of the intimate aspects of human disease encounters. Nevertheless, the neglect of war metaphors in the coverage of SARS indicates that they are more flexible than some arguments for their cognitive and cultural dominance imply. It also suggests they are rather less 'dead' than has been argued by those, such as Richard Gwyn, who have taken their ubiquity to imply a loss of 'metaphoric currency' (Gwyn, 2002: 131) . SARS does, of course, make clear that alternative framings are possible. However, as the prominence of an equally bloody Killer metaphor suggests, they are unlikely to take the appealing forms some have sought.",

SARS highlights the role of international organisations in driving news agendas on some kinds of international issues. In the current geopolitical situation, few if any such institutions can claim a genuine directorial role or possess any significant resources of their own, in the manner of national governments. They function as advisory, regulatory, coordinating bodies, and rely on the unenforceable goodwill of national governments to achieve their goals. This in turn affects the metaphorical framing of international 'problems' and induces the bureaucratic, managerial approach which can be seen in the SARS discourse in place of more energetic war metaphor systems. Understanding this shift in metaphorical framing, away from the well-entrenched metaphor system of war and plague, might not only signal a shift in the perception and policing of an emergent disease, but can also contribute to an emerging shift in the theorising of metaphor itself, away from seeing it purely as a rhetorical or cognitive device towards seeing it as a cultural and political one. As Bono has suggested: 'such cultural [scientific] metaphors adapt themselves to a larger ecology of contesting social and cultural values, interests and ideologies ' (1990: 81) .",
