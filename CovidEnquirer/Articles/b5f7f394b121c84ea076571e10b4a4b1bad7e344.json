In addition, the prevalence of HIV, advances in transplantation, and therapies for cancer and many autoimmune conditions have resulted in unprecedented rates of immunosuppression (8) . In 1980, when smallpox was eradicated, HIV had not yet manifested a high global burden of disease. Similarly, bone marrow transplantation was in its infancy, and heart-lung transplantations had not yet occurred. The fact that the proportion of unvaccinated and immunosuppressed persons in the population is increasing has not yet been adequately considered in estimations of the effect of reemergent smallpox.",

For vaccinated cohorts, immunity wanes over time, and the highest protection is present during the first 5 years after vaccination, possibly waning to zero within 5-10 years (9) . Furthermore, immunosenescence is a predictable, exponential decline in immune function that occurs after 50 years of age (10) and reduces the body's ability to fight infection and respond to vaccines (11) . This phenomenon further adds to immunosuppression in countries with an aging population. The aim of this study was to estimate the effect of reemerging smallpox in New York, New York, USA, and Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, 2 large cities with different vaccination histories for which estimates could be made on the population's immunologic status.",

For Sydney, we estimated the proportion of persons vaccinated by estimating those born before 1980 in the following groups: healthcare workers in Sydney in 2015 (34) , members of the defense forces, and migrants (>30% in the Sydney population) (35), who might have been vaccinated in their country of origin (\u224880,000 persons). We estimated that, in Sydney, at most 30% of the total population born before 1980 (persons 35-69 years of age) had been vaccinated. On the basis of a mathematical model (36) that estimated waning immunity against severe smallpox as 1.41% per year after vaccination, we calculated the age-specific residual protection for vaccinated persons 40-69 years of age by multiplying that percentage by the number of years from vaccination and subtracting it from 100% starting protection. In our model, we used the heterogeneous age-specific contact rates from the European mixing patterns study (37) . We assumed that persons would greatly reduce their social contacts after becoming symptomatic with smallpox (38) . To account for this change in social contact, we modified the normal contact matrix, multiplying the matrix by a factor (0 < x < 1) to reduce the number of contacts per day (39) . Because of the lack of studies quantifying this reduction, we assumed x to be 0.5, as in a previous study (39) . Considering severe smallpox types are more substantially prostrating, we applied the reduced contact matrix to hemorrhagic and flat smallpox infections from the first day of illness. For ordinary smallpox, we assumed the behavior change started on the second day and for vaccine-modified smallpox, on the third day.",

However, the consideration of population immunosuppression, from medical conditions to iatrogenic factors, strongly affects disease transmission and deaths in both cities. This large population subset must be considered when modeling the impact of any infectious disease outbreak. We estimated conservatively that almost 1 in 5 persons in New York and 1 in 6 persons in Sydney (and higher for the 60-64-year age group) are living with some degree of immunosuppression. Although New York has higher rates of immunosuppression for the 25-84-year age groups, Sydney has higher rates than New York for the youngest (0-19 years) and the oldest (>85) populations.",

For Sydney, even an assumption of higher immunity does not affect the infection or death rates greatly because of the low vaccine coverage before 1980. However, residual immunity becomes more influential if we use more optimistic assumptions of waning immunity. Note that persons who have been vaccinated would mount a more robust and rapid response to revaccination in the event of an outbreak and might be better protected after postexposure vaccination. Obtaining a vaccination history and checking for a consistent scar are necessary parts of outbreak management.",

Immunosuppression should continue to be an absolute contraindication for vaccination of persons who are not true contacts. Ensuring that persons with immunosuppression (including healthcare workers) avoid contact with persons with smallpox (if possible) should be a priority. Smallpox would always be more pathogenic than vaccinia virus, so any patient with a bona fide exposure to smallpox should be vaccinated with a fully potent vaccinia strain, such as ACAM2000 (44) . If such patient develops a serious complication, such as eczema vaccinatum or progressive vaccinia, the patient can be treated with ST-246 (Siga Technologies, New York, NY, USA) (45) . Our study is subject to some limitations. We used an underestimate of immunosuppression; other conditions causing immunosuppression, such as diabetes, were not considered. We also used conservative estimates for the increased risk for infection in immunosuppressed persons and grouped persons with severe and moderate immunosuppression into single categories because of the absence of more specific data to categorize them further by degree of immunosuppression. The contact matrix we used was estimated in a study conducted in the United Kingdom in 2006, which might not necessarily reflect New York or Sydney social contact patterns (37) . Furthermore, contacts with symptomatic infectious patients will probably drop to near zero once an outbreak has been confirmed and patients are well isolated, assuming adequate health system capacity for isolation and treatment of smallpox patients. The data in the model on age-specific rates of smallpox were obtained from hospitalized patients (9) , which might overestimate the rates of severe disease in the model outputs.",

The response to severe acute respiratory syndrome, with its rapid control despite the lack of a vaccine or antiviral agent, showed that patient isolation can be very successful (47) .
