The catalytic mechanism is similar to that of the serine-type peptidases in that a nucleophile and a proton donor/general base are required, and the proton donor in all cysteine peptidases in which it has been identified is a histidine residue, as in the majority of serine-type peptidases. In some families only the dyad of Cys and His seems to be essential for catalysis, whereas in others there is evidence that a third residue is required to orientate the imidazolium ring of the His (a role analogous to that of the essential aspartate in some serine peptidases). The catalytic mechanisms of cysteine peptidases are described fully in Chapter 405.",

            "text": "Clan CA contains over 20 families (see Table 404 .1). Almost all of these have been brought into the clan on the basis of structures that are known from crystallographic data to be similar. The other families are assigned to clan CA because they contain similar sequence motifs around the catalytic residues (Figures 404.2\u00c0404.7) . Besides Cys158 and His292 of the catalytic dyad, two other residues are important for catalysis in papain and its relatives (numbering as in MEROPS database). These are a Gln152 that helps in the formation of the 'oxyanion hole', an electrophilic center that stabilizes the tetrahedral intermediate, and Asn308 (sometimes Asp in families C12, C28 and C39), which is thought to orientate the imidazolium ring of the catalytic His (Chapter 405). The order of these residues in the sequence is Gln, Cys, His, Asn/Asp, and in mature papain, the numbering is Gln19, Cys25, His159 and Asn175. In family C19, asparagine serves the same function as Gln152. No equivalent of Gln152 has been identified in the foot-and-mouth disease virus L-endopeptidase. The catalytic cysteine is usually followed by an aromatic, hydrophobic amino acid, but glycine occupies this position in some peptidases of family C2 and all those of family C12. Figure 404 .8 shows secondary structure diagrams of example peptidases from the clan. All the examples shown are \u03b1/\u03b2 proteins, and all have the nucleophilic Cys at the start of a helix and the catalytic His at the start of a \u03b2-sheet.",

Cathepsins B and H (Chapters 406 and 408) both possess endopeptidase activity, but arguably are more important for their exopeptidase activities. Cathepsin B acts as a peptidyldipeptidase, releasing C-terminal dipeptides, and this activity is attributable to the existence of an extended loop that forms a cap to the active-site cleft, and carries a pair of His residues that are thought to bind the C-terminal carboxylate of the substrate (Figure 404.9) .

Most members of family C1 have propeptides homologous to that of papain, but the propeptide of cathepsin B is much shorter and very different in sequence. However, the propeptides of both cathepsin B and papain are thought to act in the same way in the proenzymes, blocking the active site by being bound in the reverse orientation to a substrate, as can be seen from the structure of procathepsin B (Figure 404 .10). Papain-like propeptides may be identified from the presence of the ERFNIN motif, in which some of the following residues (numbered according to the papain propeptide) are conserved: Glu64, Arg68, Phe72, Asn75, Asn83, Phe96, Asp98 and Glu103. The papain propeptide is homologous to proteins CTLA-2\u03b1 and CTLA-2\u03b2 of activated T cells, which have been shown to be cysteine endopeptidase inhibitors [3] .

The calcium-binding domain is homologous to calciumbinding domains in other proteins. The functions of heavy chain domains I and III are unknown.

Homologs are also known from members of a wide variety of bacterial phyla, but homologs are absent from archaea. The only bacterial homolog that has been characterized is the Tpr peptidase from Porphyromonas gingivalis, which is so dissimilar in sequence to other members of the family that it had been considered a member of a separate family, and is now the only representative in subfamily C2B. The absence of homologs from archaea and many bacteria with completely sequenced genomes, implies that horizontal gene transfer has occurred, probably from a protist or fungus to a bacterium (see the evolutionary tree in the MEROPS database). Aspergillus palB protein and a hypothetical protein from Caenorhabditis are unusual among peptidases in clan CA in that the catalytic Cys is followed by Ser rather than a hydrophobic residue (see the alignment in MEROPS). Both the Aspergillus and Caenorhabditis proteins are multidomain, but show only limited sequence similarity to domains I and III of human calpain. Neither protein possesses the calcium-binding domain IV. A non-peptidase homolog is known from Trypanosoma brucei in which the catalytic Cys has been replaced by Ser.",

            "text": "There are several families in clan CA in which the peptidases release ubiquitin from conjugated proteins. Ubiquitin is a 76 amino acid protein that is attached to other proteins as a signal for intracellular translocation or degradation (usually mediated by the proteasome). Ubiquitin is attached through the carboxyl group of its C-terminal glycine residue either to the N-terminus of another polypeptide or to the \u03b1-amino group of a lysine residue, which forms an isopeptide bond (Chapters 460\u00c0462). Ubiquitin may also be attached to another molecule of ubiquitin, and proteins targeted for degradation may be polyubiquitinated. In order for ubiquitin to be recycled there is a need for peptidases to liberate the free ubiquitin by hydrolysis of the C-terminal glycyl bond. Peptidases that release ubiquitin from conjugates are known as 'ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases' or 'deubiquitinylating enzymes'. Because release of ubiquitin may involve cleavage of an isopeptide bond, ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases are not classified as peptidases in Enzyme Nomenclature but as thiolester hydrolases. There are at least eight families of deubiquitinylating enzymes in clan CA, and there are enzymes in other, unrelated, families, including the metallopeptidase AMSH (family M67) which is a component of the 26S proteasome (Chapter 817). There are over 100 different deubiquitinylating enzymes in humans, which implies a sophisticated network controlling translocation and degradation of proteins which is only just being understood.",

The catalytic Cys is at the start of one of the helices, and the catalytic His is the start of a \u03b2 strand. A difference from papain is that the first strand of the \u03b2-barrel precedes the helix bearing the catalytic cysteine in the sequence, whereas in papain the helix precedes all the strands of the \u03b2-barrel.

These are also intracellular peptidases, but are able to release ubiquitin from much larger peptides that have been polyubiquitinated (Chapters 463\u00c0473). Because ubiquitination is also essential for the assembly of multimeric proteins, there is a need to remove the ubiquitin molecules from polyubiquitinated subunits, which is presumably one of the functions of peptidases of family C19. Peptidases in family C19 have more complicated structures than those in C12, and many are multidomain proteins. There is also a much greater variety, with Saccharomyces possessing at least 19 homologs, and even greater numbers in mammals. The tertiary structure of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 7 has been solved and a catalytic triad consisting of Cys, His and Asp was identified (Figure 404.13; also see later Figure 404 .35). The Asp is equivalent to the Asn152 of papain. The side chain of an asparagine stabilizes the oxyanion hole and is equivalent of Gln19 in papain.

The tertiary structure has been solved [21] . Family C85 includes the DUBA deubiquitinylating peptidase, which has been shown to cleave the lysine-63-linked polyubiquitin chains on tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3 [22] . However, no tertiary structure has been solved for any member of the family, and the active site residues are predictions only [15] . Ataxin-3 (Chapter 479) is yet another deubiquitinating enzyme and a member of family C86. The nuclear magnetic resonance solution structure of the domain containing the active site of ataxin-3, known as the Josephin domain, has been determined [23] , and shows the characteristics of a cysteine peptidase in clan CA. Family C88 includes OTU1 peptidase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Chapter 478) which preferentially cleaves longer polyubiquitin chains with Lys48 linkages.

Ubiquitin-fold modifier-1 (Ufm1) is another ubiquitinlike protein, and like ubiquitin attaches to proteins via the C-terminal glycine. The physiological relevance for tagging proteins with Ufm1 is unknown, but tagged proteins are not degraded. Peptidases in family C78, which includes UfSP1 peptidase (Chapter 481), release Ufm1 from conjugates and process the Ufm1 precursor by removing a C-terminal dipeptide [27] . Once again, resolution of the tertiary structure has confirmed the relationship to papain [28] and the family C78 is included in clan CA. The aspartic acid that is the third member of the catalytic triad unusually is N-terminal of the histidine, whereas in most papain-like proteins follows the histidine. The residue stabilizing the oxyanion hole is a tyrosine (whereas it is glutamine in papain). In both these respects, members of family C78 resemble members of the family C54. Family C54 includes the yeast peptidase Aut2 that is responsible for the removal of a C-terminal arginine residue from the Apg8 (or Aut7) protein. The Apg8FG protein, as the processed substrate is known, is then able to form a conjugate with an unidentified protein via the newly exposed C-terminal Gly and the conjugate binds tightly to membranes permitting the formation of the double-membrane vesicles required for the transport of material from the cytoplasm to an autophagic vesicle. Homologs are known from human, mouse, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans and Arabidopsis thaliana. Inhibition by N-ethylmaleimide and site-directed mutagenesis of Cys159 (see Alignment C54 in MEROPS) has shown that yeast peptidase Aut2 is a cysteine peptidase (Chapter 482), but other catalytic residues have not been determined. The tertiary structure of human autophagin-1 has been solved [29, 30] , and shows an catalytic triad consisting of Cys74, Asp278 and His280 that is unusual amongst papain-like proteins, in which the third member of the catalytic triad follows the histidine in the sequence (see Figure 404 .14). Families C54 and C78 are unique in having the third member (in both families an aspartic acid) preceding the histidine.

When the crystal structure of the nsP2 (nonstructural protein 2) from Sindbis virus (a member of family C9) was determined, the fold was quite unlike that of papain, and the family was assigned to its own clan (CN, see below). Consequently, many families of peptidases from RNA viruses that had been included in clan CA have been removed, because until a tertiary structure has been solved it will not be possible from sequence alone to determine if any of these families belongs to clan CA or clan CN.

Formerly termed clan CB, this has the catalytic dyad in the order His, Cys in the sequence. A comparison of sequence motifs led Bazan and Fletterick [45] to suggest that the polyprotein processing cysteine endopeptidases of several single, positive-stranded RNA viruses were structurally related to chymotrypsin, and this was confirmed when the crystal structures of picornains 3C from human hepatitis A virus (Chapter 541) (Figure 404 .20) and human rhinovirus type 14 (Chapter 537) were found to share the two \u03b2-barrel fold of chymotrypsin. There now seems no doubt that these peptidases have evolved from a common ancestor with chymotrypsin. The catalytic His of picornain 3C (in family C3) is equivalent in position to His57 of chymotrypsin, and the Cys replaces Ser195 (see the representation of two-dimensional structures for clan PA, see Figure 559 .2). In rhinovirus picornain 2A a His, Asp, Cys catalytic triad is seen [46] , but the Asp is replaced by Glu in some other members of family C3. The viral endopeptidases and chymotrypsin clearly belong in the same clan, and because the clan contains both cysteine-type and serine-type peptidases it has been named clan PA. The clan is divided into subclan PA(S), for the serine peptidases, and subclan PA(C) for the cysteine peptidases. Families C4, C24, C30, C37 and C38 also contain endopeptidases from RNA viruses that are predicted to have the chymotrypsin fold, and are placed in subclan PA(C) together with family C3.",

In subclan PA(C) the active site Cys is followed by Gly (like the Ser in chymotrypsin) whereas in clan CA the catalytic Cys is generally followed by a large hydrophobic residue. As regards function, the endopeptidases of subclan PA(C) tend to be general processing enzymes, cleaving several bonds in the polyprotein, whereas those in clan CA generally perform only a single cleavage. There is also a difference in P1 substrate specificity: in subclan PA(C) cleavage is commonly at a GlnkGly bond, whereas in clan CA cleavage usually occurs at a GlykGly bond. The subclan PA (C) endopeptidase is usually positioned between the helicase and the RNA polymerase in the polyprotein, whereas the clan CA enzyme usually precedes both the helicase and the RNA polymerase. Taken together with other indications that the positive-stranded RNA viruses are evolutionarily related, the similar locations of the subclan PA (C) endopeptidases in the genomes is entirely consistent with a common evolutionary origin of all of the peptidases in the subclan. The high rate of mutation of RNA viruses, lacking proofreading in the replication of the genome, could rapidly have obscured sequence relationships between the sequences.",

The Ulp1 endopeptidase is responsible for the release of the Smt3 proteins. Smt3 and the animal equivalent SUMO-1 (also known as sentrin) are proteins that target other proteins for export from the nucleus via the nuclear pore complex protein RANBP2. Smt3 and SUMO-1 are distantly related to ubiquitin, and like ubiquitin possess C-terminal glycine residues that can be linked in isopeptide bonds. Unlike ubiquitin, Smt3 and SUMO-1 do not target proteins for degradation, and do not form homopolymers, because the lysine essential to that process is not present. The Ulp1 endopeptidase releases Smt3 from its precursor by removing three C-terminal residues to expose the -Gly-Gly C-terminus; the mammalian equivalent, SENP1-endopeptidase, removes four C-terminal residues. Ulp1 endopeptidase can also release Smt3 from targeted proteins. The enzyme is normally localized to the periphery of the nucleus, but is found within the nucleus during mitotic anaphase. Family C55 is that of the YopJ endopeptidase from Yersinia (Chapter 69). The YopJ protein contributes to the disease process by causing host macrophages to undergo apoptosis and suppressing the action of cytokines such as TNF\u03b1 and NF-\u03baB. YopJ is thought to act by cleaving the Bid protein, which then induces apoptosis by translocating to the mitochondrion, causing the release of cytochrome c and the activation of caspases 9, 3 and 7 [79] . YopJ is an outer membrane protein that is encoded on a plasmid.",

The Hedgehog proteins are formed of two structural domains, and the only peptidase activity is an autolytic reaction that separates the two domains. The reaction is cleavage of a conserved Gly258kCys259 bond, and a cholesterol moiety is simultaneously attached to the new C-terminal glycyl residue of the N-terminal domain. The 18-kDa Nterminal domain is structurally related to a zinc D-Ala-D-Ala carboxypeptidase in clan MD; it is not known to have any peptidase activity but has a function in the embryological development of dorsal-ventral patterning. Mutational studies have shown that residues Cys258 and His329 in the 25-kDa C-terminal domain are essential for the autolytic cleavage [86] . The reaction is not inhibited by any standard peptidase inhibitors, but requires DTT in vitro. The cleavage mechanism is believed to be similar to that of the activation of prohistidine decarboxylase [87] , involving activation of Cys258 by His329 for a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl of Gly257. There is a motif around the cleavage site that is similar to that found at the N-terminal splice junction of self-splicing proteins (Chapter 76), and splicing may involve a thioester intermediate [88] . The crystal structure of the Sonic hedgehog C-terminal domain (Figure 404 .32) shows that it consists of two tandem intein-like repeats [89] , and family C46 is now included in a clan of mixed catalytic types, PD, along with the three intein families (see Chapter 76) [90] .",

The active site is at the end of the barrel. The fold is similar to that of the ykuD transpeptidase from Bacillus subtilis [91] . Members of the clan are involved in hydrolysis of bacterial cell wall peptides. Family C60 includes peptidases known as sortases (Chapter 551) from Gram-positive bacteria, and sortase A from Staphylococcus aureus cleaves proteins at a Leu-Pro-Xaa-ThrkGly motif, and then catalyzes the formation of an amide bond between the newly exposed C-terminal Thr and the cross-linking pentapeptide of the bacterial cell wall [91] . The proteins that are attached in this way to the exterior of the cell wall can be virulence factors, and inhibition of sortases has been shown to decrease virulence. Surprisingly, given a lack of structural relationship to members of clan CA, sortases are inhibited by E-64. The evolutionary tree shows a deep divergence within the family, which is divided into two subfamilies. Subfamily C60A includes sortase A, whereas C60B includes sortase B. Sortase B, also from Staphylococcus aureus, recognizes a different cleavage motif to that of sortase A [92] . The only other family in clan CL is C82.

Most of the cleavages are performed by hepacivirin (Chapter 688), which is a serine-type endopeptidase with a trypsin-like fold. Cleavage of the NS2/3 site at a LeukAla bond is mediated by the second virally encoded endopeptidase, endopeptidase 2, often termed the 'NS2-3 endopeptidase', not because of the cleavage site but because the endopeptidase consists of the NS2 protein and one-third of the NS3 protein (Chapter 554). Endopeptidase 2 is included in family C18. Site-directed mutagenesis had identified His952 and Cys993 as the catalytic dyad [95] . However, evidence that the NS2-3 endopeptidase is zinc dependent, including inhibition by EDTA and increased activity with the addition of zinc [96] , had cast doubt on the identification of the catalytic type. The tertiary structure has been determined, and shows a fold unrelated to that of any other peptidase, hence family C18 is the only family in clan CM (see Figure 404 .34). The active peptidase is a homodimer, and each monomer comprises an N-terminal, helical subdomain, a C-terminal subdomain with a \u03b2-sheet and an extended linker region. The active site His and Glu are situated in the N-terminal domain and the Cys in the Cterminal domain. An active site is only formed in the dimer, when the His and Glu from one monomer oppose the Cys from the other, thus the NS2 dimer has two active sites [97] . The formation of an active site between different subunits in a dimer is unusual amongst peptidases, but does happen with retropepsins (see Chapter 44) and has been proposed for the Pyrococcus furiosus protease 1 (see Chapter 549). The tertiary structure of the NS2 dimer also revealed the presence of a structural zinc ion, which explains the metal-dependence.",

The catalytic dyad has been identified by site-specific mutagenesis [98] , and the nsP2 endopeptidase is a bifunctional molecule with the peptidase unit at the C-terminus and an N-terminal unit that is probably involved in RNA-binding during replication. The N-terminal domain is homologous to a similarly located domain in the cucumber green mottle mosaic tobamovirus. The crystal structure of the nsP2 endopeptidase from Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus has been solved, and shows a fold unrelated to that of any other peptidase [99] (see Figure 404 .35). Hence C9 is the only family in clan CN. Until the structure was solved, it had been expected that members of family C9 would have a fold similar to that of papain.",

This is an enzyme that is expressed during sporulation, and is responsible for degradation of bacterial cell wall components. Because the enzyme is cytoplasmic and is synthesized without signal and propeptides, it is presumably acting at a late stage in cell wall component turnover. There are a number of homologs of the Bacillus endopeptidase, but similarity is restricted to a C-terminal domain of 110 residues. These include nlpC lipoprotein from Escherichia coli, invasion-associated protein p60 from Listeria species, a starch-degrading enzyme from Clostridium acetobutylicum, and a phosphatase-associated protein from Bacillus subtilis. There are single conserved Cys and His residues). The crystal structures of several members of the family have been solved, and the fold has been described as 'papain-like' but primitive [101] . However, unlike papain where the catalytic Cys is at the N-terminus of a helix, in the structures from family C40 the active site Cys is at the C-terminus of a helix, which means the sequence must run in the opposite direction to that in papain (see Figure 404 . 38) . No similarity between the structures can be detected using the DALI algorithm [102] . The structural resemblances are therefore assumed to be derived from convergent rather than divergent evolution, and proteins in C40 are assigned to the clan CO.
