Faecal suspensions of approximately 1/10 dilution, prepared for the ELISA in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with 0.05% Tween 20, were further diluted 1/2 in PBS, then mixed with an equal volume of 10% washed sheep erythrocyte suspension. The final faecal dilution was thus 1/40. The mixture was left to settle overnight at 4\u00b0C for the absorption of non-specific haemagglutinating activity from the samples. This procedure was adopted for working convenience, and shorter absorptions (e.g. 10 min at 37\u00b0C) have also been found satisfactory. Serial doubling dilutions of the supernatant were made in round bottom 96-well microtitration plates. Equal volumes (50 or 30 pl) of 1% red cells coupled to antibody were added to all wells, and the haemagglutination reaction was read after 1--2 h at room temperature. Non-specific haemagglutination was monitored by the use of red cells coupled to rotavirus-negative antibody. This was either the pre-inoculation egg antibody or, where the monoclonal antibody was used as the detecting antibody, normal mouse IgG.",

Repeat tests by PAGE were negative but the finding by electron microscopy of very small numbers of rotavirus particles in one of the two samples indicated that the low level of virus in this case was not detectable in the present gel system. Rotavirus particles were not identified in the second sample and the reason for the discrepancy was not clear. One sample positive in both serological tests was consistently negative by PAGE, but insufficient material was available for further analysis. Four samples were negative by ELISA and RPHA but clearly positive by PAGE. Three of the genome profiles obtained were very weak and repeat tests, in which bands could not be detected, would have been scored as negative.

Chasey, unpublished observations) often taken as the standard method by which alternative assays are calibrated. Since PAGE depends on the identification of a characteristic and distinctive rotavirus electropherotype, false-positive results are unlikely. This feature, and the non-dependence on antigenicity, also enables the test to detect atypical rotavirus groups which, although uncommon in cattle, may become increasingly important (Chasey and Davies, 1984) . Unlike the immunoassays, however, this use of PAGE cannot be extended to other important agents involved in the neonatal diarrhoea syndrome, such as bovine coronavirus. The present results indicate that PAGE and RPHA have a similar sensitivity for the detection of rotavirus in faecal samples, although neither test appears to detect reliably all positive samples when low levels of virus are present. If used for screening to establish patterns of infection in groups of calves it is likely that either test would give satisfactory results.",

The test protocol is simple and rapid, and can be applied to small numbers of samples or larger batches according to demand. The major limitation of RPHA is the presence of non-specific haemagglutinating factors in a number of bovine faeces samples, although the problem in this study was not as severe as reported in previous work (Bradburne et al., 1979) . In most cases non-specific factors can be eliminated by one or more adsorptions of the samples with normal sheep red blood cells. Further improvements may be achieved by the inclusion of serum (rotavirus-antibody-free) or detergents (Tween 20) in the test diluent (Cranage et al., 1985) . RPHA has also been applied to bovine enteric coronavirus (Sato et al., 1984) and it should therefore be possible to establish a simple and sensitive testing protocol using RPHA for the two major enteric viral pathogens of young calves.",
