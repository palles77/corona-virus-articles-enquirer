Indeed, we agree that a \"preparedness for knowledge\" is essential for effective actions, especially in the case of an emerging disease such as Ebola, about which many gaps in knowledge still persist [1] . We also agree that, despite the relevant efforts and investments in resource allocation that have characterized the past two decades, adequate public health and clinical response to emerging diseases remain very challenging.",

Climate change offers new environmental niches for pathogens and vectors, while the increased global interconnectedness enhances the risk of importation of severe emerging diseases, as recently occurred for Ebola and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome caused by a novel human coronavirus. In the meanwhile, Multi Drug Resistant Organisms continues to be reported in nosocomial settings, West Nile Virus and Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever virus are spreading in new geographic areas and cases of autochthonous malaria in new areas are described. In order to comply with these new challenges, preparedness activities are continuously needed, and these actions should rely, as properly suggested by Prof. Wiwanitkit, on development of new diagnostic tools, organization of multidisciplinary international collaborations, and establishment of effective isolation measures. The response to SARS epidemic was a clear example of how a networked health system can respond to a new unknown infectious threat to human health. The causative agent was identified and a reliable diagnostic was developed, thanks to a strong international collaboration, and isolation measures were strictly applied. These measures allowed the rapid control of the outbreak in the few subsequent months [7] .",

A surveillance approach based on syndromes, the scrupulous application of standard and transmissionbased precautions, the accessibility to advanced diagnostic expertise and resources, the availability of adequate infrastructures and logistics for effective isolation, the constitution of strong international links and networks, all these actions could be undertaken independently by the next disease that will emerge. These preparedness measures do not have an \"optimal duration\", as Prof. Wiwanitkit asks for, but should represent a living continuous process, at least in leading institutions dedicated to the research on and the care of infectious diseases.",
