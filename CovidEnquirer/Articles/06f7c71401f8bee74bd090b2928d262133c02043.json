Sequence comparisons were made from 1.2-to 8.9-kb segments on the 3\u0408 end of the genome. FECV/FIPV pairs from the same catteries or shelters were 97.3\u00b199.5% related but were genetically distinct from FIPV and FECV strains obtained from cats living in geographically distinct environments. The high genetic similarity between FECVs and FIPVs from the same environment strongly suggested a common ancestry. Based on the presence of deletion mutations in the FIPVs and not in the FECVs, it was concluded that FIPVs evolved as mutants of FECVs. The mutations are deletions in the FIPVs and not insertions in the FECVs since similar sequences are present in other strains that have segregated earlier from a common ancestor. Therefore, the order of descent is from FECV to FIPV. Mutations unique to FIPVs were found in open reading frames (ORFs) 3c in 4 of 6 isolates and/or 7b in 3 of 6 isolates. When the study was extended to include 7 additional FIPV isolates, 11/13 of the FIPVs sequenced were found to have mutated 3c ORFs.",

            "text": "Seroepidemiologic studies of FIP were first conducted using FIPV-infected tissues as antigen substrates in an indirect immunofluorescent antibody assay (Pedersen, 1976) . Virtually all normal cats in households experiencing FIP deaths were found to be seropositive, suggesting that FIP was an infrequent disease manifestation of a common infection. However, when FIPV was isolated from naturally infected animals and experimentally transmitted to laboratory cats, it caused fatal FIP rather than inapparent disease . To further complicate the picture, an antigenically indistinguishable feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) was also isolated from catteries where FIP occurred . The FECV-induced antibodies strongly cross-reacted with FIPV but caused only an inapparent or mild transient enteritis. It was postulated, therefore, that FIPV might be a relatively common and highly pathogenic mutant of the more ubiquitous FECV (Pedersen et al., 1984) (Pedersen and Floyd, 1985) . The validity of this mutational theory was questioned when so-called prototypic tissue culture-adapted strains of FIPV (strain WSU 79-1146) and FECV (strain WSU 79-1683) were genetically compared. The latter was found to have a major deletion in the 7b gene (Vennema et al., 1992b) , opposite to what would have been expected if FIPV had mutated from FECV. The mutational origin of FIPV from FECV was given new credence following genomic comparisons of 1.2-kb fragments obtained from nine additional FECV and FIPV isolates (Herrewegh et al., 1995) . All of these isolates had intact 7b genes, indicating that the 7b gene deletion seen in FECV 79-1683 was associated with cell culture adaptation. Furthermore, while geographically disparate isolates were genetically different, FECV UCD and FIPV UCD3 isolated from cats originating from the same facility were found to be highly related, thus supporting a common origin for FECVs and FIPVs.",

FIPV UCD3 had a major in-frame deletion of 123 nucleotides in the S gene compared to FECV UCD and other strains. This was confirmed by sequencing several overlapping PCR fragments. Deletions of one and two single codons were found in the S genes of FIPV UCD3 and UCD8, compared to their respective FECVs, FECV UCD and RM (Fig. 2 ). Furthermore, FIPV UCD3 had a deletion of 100 nucleotides in the 3c gene (see below). The occurrence of deletion mutations in FIPVs and not FECVs of each pair confirmed the hypothesis that FIPVs arose from FECVs. The deleted sequences are still present in other strains. Based on phylogenetic analysis these strains diverged from a common ancestor before the epide- or with an acronym corresponding to the encoded protein; S for spike, E for envelope, M for membrane, and N for nucleocapsid protein gene, respectively.

(C) Extent of sequence information obtained for the listed feline coronavirus strains. (D) Scale representing kilobases. miologically related FIPV/FECV isolates segregated. Therefore, the mutations are deletions in the FIPV genomes and not insertions in the FECV genomes. The search for biotype-specific genotypic markers in the 3\u0408 one-third of the genomes of the FIPVs UCD8 and UCD3 compared to the FECVs RM and UCD, respectively, resulted in the identification of only two consistent amino acid changes, both located in the S gene (mutations 3 and 6, Fig. 2 ). The same changes were not found in the S gene of FIPV UCD9, which indicated that there was not one single consistent point mutation in the major structural protein genes in the 3\u0408 one-third of the genome that could be directly linked to transition to the FIPV biotype. Mutation 3 (Fig.  2 ) was a threonine to alanine substitution which abolished a potential N-glycosylation site in FIPV UCD3 and UCD8. In FIPV strains UCD1, TN406, and KU2, this glycosylation site was conserved (Motokawa et al., 1996) . Mutation 6 was an aspartic acid to glycine substitution. The glycine residue was also present in FIPV strains UCD1, TN406, and KU2 (Motokawa et al., 1996) . In FIPV UCD4 and UCD5 an alanine residue was found in this position (Fig. 2B ). The region in which mutation 6 can be found is highly conserved among coronaviruses, in particular of serogroup 1, but also to some extent in mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), representing the other two serogroups. In most cases the central part of this region contains two acidic residues, one of which is mutated in all FIPV strains, except for FIPV UCD9.",

Two nucleotide differences resulted in two amino acid changes. The C-terminal sequence \u03eaNQHYKTEL of FECV RM was changed to \u03eaNQHHRTEL in all three FIPV strains (Fig. 3) . However, the most significant genetic differences between corresponding FECVs and FIPVs were found in ORF 3c. FIPV UCD3 was found to have a deletion of 100 nucleotides in ORF 3c, while FIPV UCD9 had two deletions of 35 and 25 nucleotides, compared to FECV UCD and FECV RM, respectively (Fig 4) . FIPV UCD8 and UCD10, both derived from FECV RM, did not have deletions in ORF 3c. Seven additional FIPV isolates also showed mutations in ORF 3c (Fig. 4C) . FIPV UCD1 had a deletion of 25 nucleotides. FIPV TN406 had a deletion of 62 nucleotides covering the 3\u0408 end of the 3b gene and the 5\u0408 end of the 3c gene. The deletion resulted in readthrough of the ORFs 3b and 3c. FIPV UCD2 had a small deletion of 4 nucleotides. In addition this strain had mutations that affected the intergenic sequence upstream involved in mRNA synthesis of the 3c gene. The intergenic sequence was also mutated in both type II feline coronaviruses FIPV 79-1146 and FIPV UCD6. FIPV UCD4, UCD5, UCD6, and 79-1146 had nonsense mutations, resulting in early termination. Animal-passaged FIPV UCD4 also exhibited several overlapping deletion mutations in ORF 3c. Remarkably, the smallest of the deletions in FIPV UCD4 was identical to the 35-nucleo- tide deletion in FIPV UCD9. The 25-nucleotide deletion in FIPV UCD1 was the same as the deletion found in FIPV UCD9 and overlapped with the 100-nucleotide deletion in FIPV UCD3.

The tissue-and feces-derived viral RNAs were partially sequenced and the sequences of pairs FECV 6-49/FIPV 6-51 and FECV 6-49/FIPV 6-53 were compared. The genetic homology between this FECV and the FIPVs was 98.7 and 97.3% and was significantly higher than that between unrelated feline coronaviruses ( Table 2 ). The 7b ORFs were intact and colinear in all of three strains. However, there were specific mutations in the 3c ORFs of the FIPVs but not in the FECV (Fig. 5) . Deletions were present in the 3c ORFs of FIPV 6-51 and 6-53. Both deletions resulted in a shift to a different reading frame like those of other FIPV strains (see above). Remarkably, the deletions in FIPV 6-51 and 6-53 were distinct, demonstrating that these two FIPVs were independently derived from FECV and not spread horizontally. These FIPVs, from two diseased siblings, were both related to a fecal isolate from a healthy littermate (cat 6-49).",

FIPV UCD8 occurred in the same closed group of cats into which FECV RM had been inadvertently introduced and FIPV UCD9 and UCD10 were obtained directly from cats experimentally infected with FECV RM. The origin of FIPVs as mutations of FECV is also supported by epidemiologic studies; FECV infection is rampant in multiple cat households, while FIP is sporadic (Foley et al., 1997) .

Their high mutability has led to a large number of strains of each species, with each strain differing in cell tropism and disease potential (Compton et al., 1993) . As an example, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of swine, a virus closely related to FECV, spontaneously mutated in the 1980s, giving rise to the porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), which has displaced TGEV in many areas (Laude et al., 1993) . The TGEV to PRCV mutation involves deletions in the S gene and point mutations and/or deletions in gene 3 (Rasschaert et al., 1990) (Wesley et al., 1991) . Even though PRCV is a relatively new virus, numerous different strains of PRCV have evolved in a decade or less (Vaughn et al., 1994) . Most, if not all, PRCV strains appear to be independently derived from TGEV. Recombinations between various strains of coronaviruses have also been documented. New pathogenic variants of MHV have arisen from recombination in vitro and in vivo between MHV 2 and MHV A59 (Keck et al., 1988a,b) . New strains of IBV have apparently developed from recombination between field and attenuated live vaccine viruses (Kusters et al., 1990) . Recombinations have also occurred between different species of coronaviruses. Serotype II feline coronaviruses have apparently resulted from recombination in the field between serotype I feline coronaviruses and canine coronaviruses (Vennema, manuscript in preparation) .",

In the tissue culture-adapted serotype II strain, FECV 79-1683 ORF 7b is mutated by deletion, while the same gene in the highly virulent FIPV 79-1146 strain is intact (Vennema et al., 1992b) . However, the non-tissue culture-adapted strain FECV UCD had an intact ORF 7b (Herrewegh et al., 1995) . The same was true for the additional FECV strains sequenced for the present study. Sequencing of attenuated derivatives of virulent FIPV strains showed a good correlation between deletions in the 7b gene and attenuation of virulence (Herrewegh et al., 1995) . This latter observation indicates that the 7b protein is important for virulence. If this is true than this virulence associated with an intact 7b gene must be supressed somehow in the non-tissue cultureadapted FECVs.

Only a half-dozen cases of FIP occurred among several thousand specificpathogen-free cats that were inadvertently infected with FECV-RM (Hickman et al., 1995) . The incidence of FIP, however, was 10% among a small group of chronically FIV-infected cats that were experimentally infected with the same strain of FECV (Poland et al., 1996) . The incidence of FIP among large pedigreed catteries and shelters averages 5% and greater (Pedersen, 1995; Postorino-Reeves, 1995; Foley et al., 1997) . Assuming that most cats that are experimentally infected with FIPV will ultimately die from FIP, it can be concluded that the FIP incidence rate is an approximation of the actual FECV to FIPV mutation rate. The actual rate of mutation may be affected by at least three different factors: (1) the level of FECV replication (the greater the more chance for mutations to occur) (Poland et al., 1996) , (2) the acquired or inherited resistance of the particular breed, bloodline, or individual cat to the mutant virus (Foley and Pedersen, 1995; Poland et al., 1996) , and (3) the strain of FECV and the ease with which it can be mutated.",

The first pair, FECV UCD/ FIPV UCD3, was recognized as being genetically related by (Herrewegh et al., 1995) . FECV UCD and FIPV UCD3 (Pedersen and Floyd, 1985) originated from the same experimental cattery but at different times. The second pair, FECV RM/FIPV UCD8 was isolated from a single closed specific-pathogen-free cat population that had been inadvertently infected with FECV and subsequently suffered sporadic cases of FIP (Hickman et al., 1995) . The isolates were obtained an estimated 2 years after the initial introduction of FECV into the colony. Two new strains, designated FIPV UCD9 and UCD10, occurred when chronically feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)-infected cats were experimentally infected with FECV RM, at 8 and 10 weeks after inoculation, respectively (Poland et al., 1996) . This resulted in a third (FECV RM/FIPV UCD9) and fourth (FECV RM/FIPV UCD10) pair. Pairs 5 and 6 were isolated at the same time from littermate kittens in a shelter in Davis, California, and designated FECV 6-49/FIPV 6-51 and FECV 6-49/FIPV 6-53.",

Figure 1B demonstrates the overlapping PCR fragments, designated by letter, that were used to sequence this portion of the genome. The coronavirus strains that were included in this study, and the PCR fragments sequenced for each, are presented schematically in Fig. 1C . The entire 3\u0408 one-third of the genome of two independent FECV isolates, FECV UCD and FECV RM, was sequenced, as well as identical segments of their respective FIPVs, FIPV UCD3 and FIPV UCD8. FIPV UCD9 and UCD10, both derived from FECV RM, were sequenced for 4.5 kb, downstream of the S gene and starting with fragment C. Several fragments of the S gene were also sequenced for these two strains.

Primers were derived from the sequence of FIPV 79-1146 (de Groot et al., 1988) (Vennema et al., 1991) . Primers derived from the spike gene of FIPV 79-1146 did not work with type I FECVs/FIPVs. A set of overlapping fragments of the spike gene of FIPV UCD3 was obtained as described previously . This sequence was used to design primers for the spike genes of other type I FECVs/FIPVs. PCR fragments were cloned using TA-cloning kits (Invitrogen or Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid DNA was sequenced using the Sequenase 2.0 kit (U.S. Biochemicals) with [ 32 P]dATP (Amersham) and standard or reverse M13 sequence primers, PCR primers, or internal primers. Sequences from FECV/FIPV pairs 5 and 6 were obtained by direct automated sequencing of PCR products. Sequence data were analyzed using the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group sequence analysis software package (Devereux et al., 1984) (Program Manual for the Wisconsin Package, Version 8, 1994).",

(A) Graphical representation of the alignment of the spike protein amino acid sequences of FECV RM/FIPV UCD8 and FECV UCD/FIPV UCD3 using the program GAPSHOW. Mismatches are indicated by a vertical line, and deletions by an interrupted vertical line. Mutations listed in B are numbered from left to right and indicated by open arrows for deletions and filled arrows for amino acid changes occurring in both pairs. (B) Multiple sequence alignments surrounding numbered mutations in A. Mutations 1, 2, 4, and 5 are deletion mutations in either one of the FIPV strains. Mutations 3 and 6 are identical changes occurring in both pairs. Note that mutations 3 and 4 (and 2 also) involve potential N-linked glycosylation sites. Amino acids are listed in single-letter code.",

(B) Of the three FIPV strains derived from FECV RM, two have an intact ORF 3c. FIPV UCD9 has deletions of 35 and 25 nucleotides. (C) Additional FIPV strains without known FECV predecessor contain nonsense and or deletion mutations. FIPV UCD1 and UCD4 contain deletions of 25 and 35 nucleotides, respectively. FIPV TN406 has a deletion of 62 nucleotides covering the 3\u0408 end of the 3b gene and the 5\u0408 end of the 3c gene. The deletion resulted in readthrough of ORFs 3b and 3c. FIPV UCD2 has a small deletion of 4 nucleotides. FIPV UCD4, UCD5, UCD6 and 79-1146 all have nonsense mutations. Note that the 35-nucleotide deletions in UCD9 and UCD4 are in the same position. The same is true for the 25-nucleotide deletions in FIPV UCD9 and UCD1 which overlapped with the 100nucleotide deletion in UCD3. The nonsense mutations in FIPV UCD5 and UCD6 are the same. Deletions are indicated with large triangles pointing up; nonsense mutations are indicated with small triangles pointing left.",
