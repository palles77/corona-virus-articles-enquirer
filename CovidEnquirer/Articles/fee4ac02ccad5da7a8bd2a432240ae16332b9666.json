This system enriches nucleic acids of target viruses in clinical/field samples by using a library of biotinylated RNAs with sequences complementary to the target viruses. The enriched nucleic acids are amplified by PCR and subjected to next generation sequencing to identify the target viruses. In many samples, SureSelect target enrichment method increased efficiencies for detection of the viruses listed in the biotinylated RNA library. Furthermore, this method enabled us to determine nearly full-length genome sequence of porcine parainfluenza virus 1 and greatly increased Breadth, a value indicating the ratio of the mapping consensus length in the reference genome, in pig samples. Our data showed usefulness of SureSelect target enrichment system for comprehensive analysis of genomic information of various viruses in field samples.",

The data that infectious diarrhea causes death of more than 50% of the calf less than 1 month of age illuminate importance of control of infectious diseases for productivity of domestic animals [5, 22] . Delayed fattening of pigs due to influenza A (H1N1) virus infection [2] ; a decrease in the milk yield of cattle by bovine viral diarrhea virus, Akabane virus, and bovine coronavirus [1, 7, 18, 19] ; and a decline of reproductive performance of cattle under the influence of Akabane virus [18] also represent examples of ill effects of infectious diseases for productivity of domestic animals. The regulations of the International Epizootic Office limit the movement of domestic animals near farms that are affected by certain infectious diseases. Once an outbreak of an internationally important infectious disease, e.g., foot-and-mouth disease, occurs, the products of susceptible livestock are subject to export restrictions, causing severe economic damage in the affected county. Rapid detection of the infectious agents and prompt responding to the infection would minimize the economic losses.",

Host-derived nucleic acids represent the majority of the nucleic acids in most of clinical/field samples and presence of low levels of nucleic acids of infectious agents often makes their detection and identification difficult. To efficiently detect viral genomes in various animal samples, the target enrichment method called SureSelect (Agilent Technologies) has been developed. SureSelect selectively captures the nucleic acids of target viruses by using streptavidin bead-bound biotinylated RNAs complementary to the target viruses. The captured viral nucleic acids are then amplified by PCR and subjected to next generation sequencing, leading to identification of target viruses in the sample. We tested usefulness of the SureSelect system for detection of various virus genomes present in field samples of cattle, pigs, and goats in Japan.",

First, we generated the DNA library of obtained ds DNA samples by randomly fragmenting the dsDNA, and subsequent addition of adapter sequence, to which the index primer anneals. Then, the DNA samples were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, CA, USA). Next, the adapter-attached library was amplified using the Sure-Select QXT Primer Mix. The PCR was conducted as follows: 68 C for 2 min, at 98 C for 2 min, followed by 8 cycles of 98 C for 30 s, 57 C for 30 s, and 72 C for 1 min; with a final extension at 72 C for 5 min. Immediately after the reaction, the DNA sample was purified using Agencourt AMPure XP. The adapter-attached DNA library was hybridized to the virus capture library designed for this study, and nucleic acids of the target viruses were enriched. Specifically, a sample was mixed with the SureSelect QXT Fast Blocker Mix and was incubated at 95 C for 5 min and 65 C for 10 min using a thermal cycler. After holding the sample at 65 C for 1 min in the thermal cycler, we added SureSelect QXT Fast Hybridization Buffer to the sample and performed 60 cycles of incubation at 65 C for 1 min and 37 C for 3 s. Immediately after the reaction, SureSelect RNase Block solution was added to the sample, and the captured DNA was purified by using Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin T1 beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific K.K. Yokohama, Japan). Then, the DNA library, which was attached to streptavidin beads, was amplified by PCR after addition of the index primer, dNTP mix, Herculase \u2161 Reaction Buffer, and Herculase 2 Fusion DNA polymerase. The PCR cycling conditions were as follows: an initial denaturation at 98 C for 2 min; followed by 20 cycles of 98 C for 30 s, 58 C for 30 s, and 72 C for 1 min; and a final extension at 72 C for 5 min. After PCR, streptavidin beads were removed from the sample by using a magnet stand, and the PCR products, which were not associated with the beads, were further purified with Agencourt AMPure XP. The obtained purified product was subjected to NGS analysis. We call the NGS data analysis of the library on the basis on this method postcapture sequencing.",

Both library sets took into consideration of various viral pathogens of domestic animals in Japan. Based on the literature search on PubMed.gov and the master list from International Virus Classification Committee (ICTV), we added other viruses that are at risk of disease outbreaks. Unclassified viruses that are not listed in the ICTV classification table were also selected from the NCBI Virus database. Viruses possibly related to cattle, pigs and goats were also added from Virus-Host-DB (http://www.genome.jp/virushostdb/). The capture library set of the bovine-related viruses included four species of single-stranded (ss) DNA viruses, 28 species of dsDNA viruses, 17 species of dsRNA viruses, 35 species of ssRNA (\u00c0) viruses, 36 species of ssRNA (\u00fe) viruses, and three species of ssRNA viruses encoding a reverse transcriptase. The capture library set of bovineswine-caprineerelated viruses included 48 species of ssDNA viruses, 81 species of dsDNA viruses, 416 species of dsRNA viruses, 156 species of ssRNA (\u00c0) viruses, 135 species of ssRNA (\u00fe) viruses, 14 species of ssRNA viruses encoding a reverse transcriptase, and 15 species of unclassified viruses. The entire regions of these viral genomes were used to capture target viral nucleic acids, except for herpesvirus, for which we screened the samples for the polymerase gene and eight functionally conserved genes; these genes were used for phylogenetic analysis of the a, b, g Herpesvirinae (HEP1e12) [3] . The virus genomes used for the capture libraries are shown in Supplementary Material. Table 1 shows the number of reads and contigs obtained from analysis of each precapture sequencing and postcapture sequencing. Contigs of each sample were subjected to a local BLAST search using a virus database obtained from NCBI. Contigs with E value* <1E-100 were reused for BLASTn search on NCBI, and the results with the highest score are shown in Table 2 . (*E value means \"Expected value\" where a hit between an entry and a query sequence happens by chance.). We defined E values less than 1E-100 as positive. The viral genomes that were positive in the postcapture sequencing are shown in Tables 2A and 3. Table 3 also shows the names, accession numbers and lengths of genomes used for the mapping. The number of reads mapped to each reference sequence is shown as a total read count. The ratio of the consensus length of the mapped reads to the total length of the reference sequence is indicated as Breadth (%) in Table 3 . High Breadth means a value indicating the ratio of the mapping consensus length in the reference genome.",

Because the availability of reads of the target virus is depended on the relative amount of the target viral genome to other nucleic acids of host and other agents in a given sample, sample pretreatments that eliminate the host genome have been carried out to obtain the target viral sequence [13, 17] . Without these pretreatment, determining the whole or partial genome sequence of the target virus would be difficult. Hence, the target enrichment system represents an important method for detection of target viral genomes in a mixture of nucleic acids derived from both host and infectious agents.

The result of BLAST analysis of contigs obtained from SureSelect enrichment method for bovine-related viruses was slightly inferior to that of the conventional method for BPV and BKV, whereas the target enrichment method was better than conventional method for contigs of BhuV-1, BEV and BAstV. The results of comparison using BLAST against the BPV TCH 6 strain (KM 589358), which was included in the bovine-related capture library, and the contig obtained from the postcapture sequencing analysis showed that homology to BPV manifested 86% Query cover and 68% Ident. Similar analysis of BKV revealed 83% query cover and 69% Ident. These results indicated that SureSelect target enrichment method could detect viruses that had over 69% homology with the reference. CPV and DPV were detectable only in precapture sequencing because those viruses were not included in the bovine-related capture library, whereas only postcapture sequencing analysis detected BHnV-1, which was present in the bovine-related capture library.

Almost all viruses detected by precapture sequencing were also detected by postcapture sequencing in both pig samples. One exception was human picobirnavirus in pig sample 1; precapture sequencing, but not postcapture sequencing, detected this virus. We included four strains of picobirnavirus in the capture library for bovine-swinecaprineerelated viruses. A BLAST search showed that one contig in precapture sequencing had homology to human picobirnavirus, whereas this contig showed little homology to any of four strains of picobirnavirus in the capture library; those showing the most homology were in agreement on only 20 bases. As SureSelect could detect sequences showing homology over 69% to the reference (see above), SureSelect is suitable to detect many emerging mutated viruses. However, picobirnavirus is known for its diversity of sequences [18] ; hence, for successful detection of virus species with high diverse sequences, inclusion of sequences of as many strains as possible in the capture library would be helpful. The SureSelect target enrichment system substantially increased the number of reads mapped to porcine parainfluenza virus strain 1438-1, allowing to reveal 98.9% and 99.8% of the whole genome sequence (KT749882.1) of the virus, in pig sample 1 and 2, respectively (Fig. 2) .
