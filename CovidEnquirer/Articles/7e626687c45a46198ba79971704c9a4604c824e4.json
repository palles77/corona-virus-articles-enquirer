Objectives: We have evaluated the performance of two novel reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCRs) targeting specifically hemagglutinin and neuraminidase of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus in combination with a conserved matrix PCR. In addition, we investigated the performance of a novel discrimination RT-PCR for detection of the H275Y resistance mutation in the neuraminidase gene. Study design: Clinical performance of both subtype specific RT-PCR assays was evaluated through analysis of 684 throat swaps collected from individuals meeting the WHO case definition for the novel pandemic influenza virus. Analytical performance was analyzed through testing of 10-fold serial dilutions of RNA derived from the first Dutch sequenced and cultured confirmed case of novel pandemic influenza infection. Specificity and discriminative capacities of the H275Y discrimination assay were performed by testing wild type and recombinant H275Y pandemic influenza. Results: 121 throat swaps collected from April 2009 to July 2009 were positive by at least two out of three RT-PCRs, and negative for the seasonal H3/H1 subtype specific RT-PCR assays. 117 of these were tested positive for all three (Ct-values from 15.1 to 36.8). No oseltamivir resistance was detected. Conclusions: We present a sensitive and specific approach for detection of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 and a rapid RT-PCR assay detecting a primary oseltamivir resistance mutation which can be incorporated easily into clinical virology algorithms.",

            "text": "The world have been stockpiling antiviral drugs for the treatment of infected patients and to minimize further spread of the virus during the first pandemic phase, the period when no appropriate vaccine against the pandemic influenza strain is available. 2 Rapid detection of the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 variants, distinguishing these strains from circulating epidemic strains and identification of antiviral resistant variants is important for pandemic surveillance and patient management. Currently, the pandemic influenza variant is naturally resistant to amantadine and rimantidine, but is still susceptible to the neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza). 3 Since the beginning of the seasonal influenza epidemic of 2007-2008, resistance of influenza A/H1N1 viruses to the antiviral drug oseltamivir has been a cause of concern. Of the circulating viruses that year, 16% were found to be oseltamivir resistant and early data from the southern hemisphere suggested up to 100% oseltamivir resistance for the 2008-2009 epidemic. 4 All of these viruses were found to be resistant by a histidine to tyrosine substitution in the viral neuraminidase at position 275 (residue 274 in the N2 gene). The same resistance mutation was found in viruses isolated from influenza A/H5N1 infected patients treated with oseltamivir. 5 As a consequence of massive use of NAIs during the pandemic, appearances of influenza viruses resistant to these drugs are to be expected. 6, 7 The gold standards for antiviral resistance screening are phenotypic resistance assays, 8 but these are time consuming and would include viral culturing of a pandemic strain. To date, NAIs resistance patterns of the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus are unknown. However, potential resistance patterns may occur in a similar way, since a structural comparison between the neuraminidase of the epidemic and pandemic influenza A/H1N1 show great similarities between the active sites of both enzymes. 3 A single nucleotide mutation (cytosine to thymine) at position 823 of the pandemic neuraminidase gene can result in a histidine to tyrosine substitution at position 275. Pyrosequencing, 9 a method to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), has become a well accepted method for sensitive screening of SNP resistant mutations as such. However, as a result of extensive washing procedures with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) generated amplicons this technique may lead to false positive results. RT-PCR can be used for SNP analysis as well, by designing primers and probes that discrimination between wild type and mutant sequences. Excellent discrimination properties are achieved by incorporation of locked-nucleic acid (LNA) bases in these probes that increase melting temperatures, thus allowing the probe to be shorter with increased discriminative capacities. 10 ",

For the influenza A matrix, pandemic H1 and N1 RT-PCRs the following amplification conditions were used: UNG reaction at 50 \u2022 C for 2 min, cDNA reaction at 60 \u2022 C for 30 min and PCR amplification at 95 \u2022 C for 5 min, followed by 45 cycles at 95 \u2022 C for 20 s, 62 \u2022 C for 1 min.

Currently, no vaccines are available and antiviral drugs are the only line of defense. Recently, a pandemic influenza sequence was uploaded to the influenza sequence database that encoded for a H275Y variant (Genbank accession no. GQ365445). It is still unclear whether this virus is oseltamivir resistant and can be transmitted, but since the global spread of oseltamivir resistance in the seasonal influenza A/H1N1 virus population, focus on this mutation is needed. We have evaluated a novel RT-PCR assay for sub-typing the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus. Both RT-PCRs are sensitive, specific and can be incorporated directly into existing influenza detection and sub-typing algorithms. For validation of the H275Y discrimination assay, virus isolates were chosen that were derived from pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 infected patients before oseltamivir treatment. These patients respond well to oseltamivir treatment in general, 16 therefore we assume that no H275Y minor variants were present in these samples. Taken these samples as a baseline, up to 5% for the H275Y oseltamivir resistant mutants could be detected in mixed virus populations using the H275Y discrimination assay (see Fig. 2 ). A drawback of genotypic screening for antiviral resistance mutations by RT-PCR is the potential appearances of unwanted mismatches in the primer and probe regions, due to antigenic drift. For diagnostic purposes, the discrimination RT-PCR assays should therefore be performed in parallel with influenza RT-PCR assays targeting more conserved regions of the influenza viral genome.",
