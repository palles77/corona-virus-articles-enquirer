Although once considered the melting pot of the world for welcoming an influx of diversity, the United States generally prohibits HIV-infected individuals from entering the country. U.S. immigration law imposes travel and immigration regulations prohibiting individuals infected with HIV from entering the country without special waivers and permanent records of the travelers' HIV status inside their passports. With approximately 1.6 million people living with HIV in Latin America (United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, 2007), these restrictions have an impact on HIV-infected Hispanics attempting to travel or immigrate to the United States. In essence, these persons with HIV may believe that the message being sent to them is ''Lo siento pero usted no est a bienvenido'' (''I am sorry but you are not welcome'').",

However in November 2007 , China announced that it would be reversing its HIV travel restrictions. Rather than reversing the U.S. travel ban, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposed changes to the regulations. These changes will still restrict travel of HIV-infected persons (U.S. Department of Homeland Security [USDHS], 2007) . The Association of Nurses in AIDS Care (ANAC), along with many other organizations, announced opposition to the proposed regulations and argued that existing requirements violate human rights (ANAC, 2007) . Additionally, the proposed regulations fail to streamline the travel restrictions as promised by President Bush during his 2006 World AIDS Day speech. This column presents a brief overview of U.S. travel policies and immigration laws related to HIV by (a) describing current immigration law as it relates to HIV status, (b) reporting on the proposed DHS changes to current HIV travel and immigration policies, and (c) using common scenarios to discuss application of current laws for HIV-infected Hispanics who wish to travel or immigrate to the United States.",

The DHS also considers whether the alien might transmit HIV or incur any costs to the U.S. government. In instances in which admission would bring a public benefit, waivers are granted for 30 days or less to attend a scientific, professional, or academic conference; receive medical treatment; visit close family members; or conduct business.

This is a new provision that concerns many HIV advocacy groups because it could be interpreted that use of the waiver program forever bans the ability to apply for a green card.

Although changes in the U.S. ban on HIV-infected persons were promised in 2006, the new proposed regulations do not remove restrictions. The U.S. travel ban for HIV-infected persons remains a controversial issue. Although supporters of the travel restrictions see them as safeguards to the spread of epidemic diseases in America, HIV advocates note that the travel ban serves no scientific, medical, or public health benefit. The travel ban is a violation of human rights to privacy, freedom of movement, and freedom from discrimination and is a policy that the United States shares with only a handful of nondemocratic countries. At this time it is not known whether the restrictions will change; thus, it is important for practitioners to keep current and to be knowledgeable so that they may advise their clients about current U.S. travel and immigration regulations and the impact of these regulations on HIV-infected persons.",
