In the early 2000s, severe acute respiratory syndrome rapidly spread around the world because travelers infected with the virus traveled on airplane to distant countries [3] . Moreover, importation of measles cases along air travel had caused an outbreak of the disease, which was once eliminated from the United States [4] .",

We measured the overall incidence of importable infectious disease in Korea, which was found to range between 0.46 (cholera) and 35.60 (malaria) cases per 100,000 population per year. Although the incidence of endemic transmission decreased during the surveillance period, we observed a gradual increase in the proportion and absolute number of imported cases. Our findings are consistent with the pattern described in other countries with increased international travel volume, resulting in the emergence or reemergence of once disappeared infectious pathogens. There have been concerns about possible exchange of infectious diseases between continents mainly produced by the increased volume of international travels [8] . From 1997 through 2006, data on travelrelated dengue analyzed by GeoSentinel Surveillance Network suggested an overall annual incidence from 50 to 159 cases per 1000 ill returned travelers [9] . A study conducted in Spain reported the incidence of imported cases of malaria from 2.4 cases per 100,000 in 1989 to 3.5 cases in 2005 [10] . During late 2000s, there was nearly 600% increase in the number of travelers returning from Africa to Romania and an associated increase in the number of imported malaria cases has been recently recognized [11] . In the United States with high immunization coverage, imported cases of measles represent an important continuing source of transmission [4] .",

It has been argued that the recent spread and increase of dengue in subtropical countries probably have resulted from international travels [6, 18] . There had been no documentation of Dengue endemicity in Korea. From 2006 to 2010, among 290 case-patients of Dengue had a history of international travel [6] . Destination were: Philippines (34.1%) contributed the largest number of cases, followed by visitors to Indonesia, India, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Bangladesh, China, East Timor, Maldives, Palau, Sri Lanka, Brazil, and Nigeria. In Korea, the surveillance system of dengue was established in 2001 and clinical diagnostic criteria have not been changed since then; therefore, we could hardly attribute such an increase to the changed diagnostic criteria since 2001. However, we do speculate whether surveillance awareness in primary healthcare physicians is one of the major contributions.",

First, the data we used was from administrative data, and thus we did not have access to laboratory information or patient's travel histories. Identification of subtypes of shigellosis, malaria, and dengue are essential in both clinical settings as well as in public health, because prevention and control measures vary according to the different subtypes of such diseases. Moreover, identification of travel history in individual case-patient may provide baseline data on quarantine measures in Korea. Second, several correlates were not controlled in this study, and the exact temporal sequence with adjustment for relevant factors should be addressed. The outbreak of infectious diseases in exporting country may potentially affect the number of imported infection to Korea, which has not been accounted in our study. Thirdly, because we did not have precise case definitions in six different infectious diseases, the quality of these data are limited. The NNDSS data lack specific definition and diagnostic criteria for cases of the six infectious diseases reported to the government; and our results should therefore be interpreted cautiously.",

The reports on international spread of diseases including antibiotic resistant bacteria are growing, and it is important to know the global patterns of transmission from public health stand point. Although the ecological design of this study limit the strength of the evidence, the design is appropriate for assessing the impact of volume of traffic and the transmission of infection. Nevertheless, our results indicate that the decision to make importable infectious disease notifiable in Korea was warranted and that increased vigilance focused on these new surveillance data is needed.",
