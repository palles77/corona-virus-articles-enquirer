            "text": "Infections may be hazardous to the health of the mother, the course of pregnancy, and the unborn child. They can lead to premature labor or premature rupture of membranes and thereby increase the risk for spontaneous abortion and prematurity. Furthermore, certain germs can pass to the unborn child and harm it directly. Therefore, an anti-infective treatment which should be both effective and safe for the mother and the unborn child is often required. The use of penicillins and older cephalosporins is well documented and considered to be safe. Consequently, they are the drug of choice during pregnancy. In selected cases of bacterial resistance or intolerance to first-line antibiotics, other anti-infective agents might be recommended. Especially for life-threatening infections, a therapy with not so well-tried agents might be needed. The potential benefit of treatment in such cases most often outbalances the potential risk for the unborn child.",

Macrolides are primarily applied in the treatment of infections with Gram-positive germs, but are also effective against Haemophilus influenzae and intracellular pathogens such as chlamydia. Macrolides offer an alternative for patients with penicillin allergy. Erythromycin is the oldest medication of this group. Its resorption can be delayed in the third trimester. Gastrointestinal side effects can lead to lower than therapeutic plasma concentrations, resulting in treatment failure (Larsen 1998) . Only 5-20% of the maternal erythromycin concentration is obtained in the fetus. Therefore, erythromycin is not a sufficiently reliable drug for fetal or amniotic infections.",

            "text": "Erythromycin has always been considered a safe and effective antibiotic during pregnancy. Data on several thousand first trimester exposures do not support an association between erythromycin and congenital malformations (e.g. Czeizel 1999a ). However, an analysis of the data from the Swedish Birth Registry showed a weakly significant increase in malformations in 1,844 children whose mothers took erythromycin in early pregnancy compared to offspring whose mothers used phenoxymethylpenicillin (K\u00e4ll\u00e9n 2005a ). This was based on an increased rate of cardiovascular malformations, especially ventricular and atrial septal defects. An update of the Swedish data verified an association between the use of erythromycin during early pregnancy and cardiovascular defects (K\u00e4ll\u00e9n 2014 ). An increased incidence of pyloric stenosis was discussed by the same author (K\u00e4ll\u00e9n 2005a) . This observation after intrauterine exposure in the first trimester is biologically not plausible; but it should be mentioned that a link has been suggested between a neonatal treatment with erythromycin during the first two weeks and the development of pylorus stenosis (e.g. Mahon 2001) . Other studies have failed to find a higher rate of septum defects, pyloric stenosis or other malformations (Bahat Dinur 2013 , Lin 2013 , Rom\u00f8ren 2012 , Malm 2008 , Cooper 2002 , Louik 2002 . In summary, the experiences argue against an increased embryo-and fetotoxic risk for erythromycin.",

Under discussion were also enamel defects leading to an increased risk of caries, inhibition of the growth of the long bones, specifically the fibula and further, cataracts due to depositions into the lens.

Prior to this, they are antibiotics of second choice. Doxycycline should be preferred in such cases. Inadvertent use of tetracyclines, even after the fifteenth week, is not an indication for termination of pregnancy (Chapter 1.15).

An increased risk for preterm birth and low birth weight has also been observed after exposure to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Santos 2011 , Yang 2011 . A Danish cohort study based on a prescription register found a doubling of the hazard of miscarriage after trimethoprim exposure in the first trimester (Andersen 2013b ). Based on the same prescription register, an increased risk of heart and limb defects was observed after preconceptional exposure (during the 12 weeks before conception) to trimethoprim (Andersen 2013c) . Beside methodological problems, such an association seems unlikely because a short-term therapy with trimethoprim does not usually lead to a relevant folic acid deficiency as a possible cause for birth defects. Trimethoprim and sulfonamides are not drugs of first choice, but they exhibit no established teratogens. According to current knowledge the teratogenic risk of a trimethoprim and sulfonamide therapy is negligible. Actually, there are no sufficiently convincing arguments to support the recommendation of an additional folic acid administration during an antibiotic therapy with the discussed medications, see Chapter 2.18.8 for additional discussion concerning folic acid usage.",

Czeizel 2001d , Ben David 1995 , although in a number of studies, some of them with methodological faults, weakly significant findings were noted for craniosysnostosis, ophthalmic malformations, oral clefts, and cardiovascular defects (Crider 2009 , K\u00e4ll\u00e9n 2005b , K\u00e4ll\u00e9n 2003 . A case-control study observed an increased risk of craniosynostosis after intrauterine exposure to nitrosatable drugs (Gardner 1998) .",

It is used as an intravenous injectable and as a reserve antibiotic in severe infections such as osteomyelitis. Fosfomycin tromethamine is an orally taken salt of fosfomycin used for the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs. Some authors also recommend the oral use during pregnancy (e.g. Falagas 2010 , Bayrak 2007 . These studies, however, are primarily focused on the effectiveness of fosfomycin tromethamine, not on the risk for the newborn. Overall, the experience argues against a teratogenic and fetotoxic potential in humans. Nitroimidazoles are effective bactericidal agents against anaerobes and protozoa. They are converted into metabolites that impede intracellular bacterial DNA synthesis. The main representative of the nitroimidazoles is metronidazole. Metronidazole is now being recommended by some investigators for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancies at high risk for preterm delivery, as a strategy to decrease this risk (review by Joesoef 1999) . Others, however, failed to notice an improvement in the incidence of prematurity ( Shennan 2006 , Andrews 2003 , Klebanoff 2001 . After oral and intravenous administration, concentrations as high as those in the mother are reached in the embryo/fetus. Significant systemic absorption occurs after vaginal application, exposing the fetus as well. The pharmacokinetic profile of metronidazole did not change at the different time points assessed during pregnancy, and did not differ from nonpregnant patients (Wang 2011) .",

This is useful when treating pseudomembranous enterocolitis with vancomycin. However, in this situation metronidazole (Section 2.6.10) should be considered as an alternative, as vancomycin therapy is more expensive, and to prevent the selection for vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Vancomycin crosses the placenta reaching the fetus in relevant quantities (Laiprasert 2007) . It has not shown teratogenic effects in animal studies. Experience with treatment in human pregnancy is limited to a Recommendation. Aminoglycosides should only be used parenterally in life-threatening infections with difficult Gram-negative pathogens and when firstchoice antibiotics fail. The serum levels need to be monitored regularly during the treatment. A risk-based termination of pregnancy or invasive diagnostic are not required (Chapter 1.15). If the parenteral therapy had been extensive, renal function should be monitored in the neonate and an auditory test should be performed. If local or oral application of aminoglycosides is indicated, they can be given because systemic absorption is minimal by these routes.",

There are slight differences in the recommendations of the different organizations in the world, such as the WHO (2010a), the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (IUATLD), and several national organizations (e.g. Blumberg 2003) . Treatment considerations depend on disease status and drug resistance. First-line drugs for the treatment of TB during pregnancy are isoniazid (+pyridoxine), rifampicin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide. These standard medications have not shown teratogenic or fetotoxic effects in humans (e.g. Bothamley 2001) . As far as we know today, TB drugs reach the fetus in relevant quantities. An increasing development of resistance makes it harder to choose the right medication in pregnancy.

Although INH can cross the placenta, it does not appear to be teratogenic, even when given during the first trimester. The older literature contains case reports of different malformations and neurological damages in prenatally exposed children. INH intake, lack of pyridoxine, co-medication, and even the TB disease itself was blamed. Newer publications did not confirm a teratogenic risk (e.g. Taylor 2013 . In summary, experiences speak against a major risk. INH increases pyridoxine metabolism, which may be responsible for CNS toxicity. To prevent a possible vitamin B6 deficiency, INH should be given during pregnancy in combination with pyridoxine.",

The drugs of this group that had been introduced first, namely clotrimazole and miconazole, are most thoroughly investigated for use in pregnancy. Regarding clotrimazole, there are extensive studies about the treatment of vaginal yeast infections that do not indicate an embryotoxic potential (e.g. Czeizel 1999b , King 1998 . Also, there is no suggestion that there is an increase in miscarriages. Czeizel (2004a) noted a decrease in prematurity when vaginosis was treated locally with clotrimazole. Experiences with several thousand pregnant women are available for miconazole (e.g. Czeizel 2004b , McNellis 1977 . A suggestion by the Hungarian Malformation Registry about a link between vaginal therapy with miconazole plus metronidazole during the second and third gestational month, and an increase in syndactyly and hexadactyly, has not been substantiated by other studies (Kazy 2005a ).",

Newer lipid formulations of amphotericin B such as liposomal amphotericin B are characterized by a markedly better tolerance and less nephrotoxicity. Amphotericin passes the placenta.

Severe hookworm and other helminth infections during pregnancy may cause anemia, reduced birth weight and increased perinatal mortality. A routine application of anthelmintics during the second and third trimester for women in areas endemic for hookworm infection has been suggested, with the argument that this may improve maternal anemia, birth weight, and neonatal mortility (e.g. WHO 2013c, Christian 2004 ). However, a randomized placebo-controlled study showed no advantage for newborns whose pregnant mothers had received albendazole or praziquantel .

ART in pregnancy has become an integral part in the prophylaxis of HIV transmission after data revealed the protective effect of perinatal prophylaxis, with the nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) zidovudine that could prevent a possible vertical transmission during the last trimester and labor (Connor 1994) . National and international guidelines recommend a standard therapy for both nonpregnant and pregnant HIV-infected women take a combination of at least three antiretroviral medications (EACS 2013 , OARAC 2012 , WHO 2010c . This highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) typically consists of two NRTIs and either a protease inhibitor (PI), or a non-nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). The intention is that the suppression of the plasma HIV load (HIV-RNA) should be as close to <50 copies/mL at least by the end of the pregnancy.

Neural tube defects, in particular (Suarez 2004 , Shaw 1998 ), but also kidney, heart and abdominal wall defects (Abe 2003 , Chambers 1998 , have been reported in association with febrile infections in early pregnancy, even though the overall malformation risk is absent or only mildly increased. Moretti (2005) performed a meta-analysis about the risk of neural tube defects and hyperthermia. They included 15 studies with 1,719 cases and found a significant correlation (OR 1.9; 95%; CI 1.61-2.29), both in the nine case-control studies and the six cohort studies. Lowering fever in pregnant women seems to reduce the risk (Suarez 2004) . It has been debated if the use of sauna, electric blankets, or other factors that bring about a short-term increase in body temperature could lead to similar effects as high fever (Suarez 2004) . In Finland, where this issue had been investigated repeatedly, visits to saunas occur frequently during pregnancy and is considered safe. The use of electric blankets and heated water beds has not shown, in other investigations, that they are linked to an increased malformation risk.",
