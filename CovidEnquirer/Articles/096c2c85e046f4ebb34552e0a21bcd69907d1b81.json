            "text": "Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is defined as the transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells originating from bone marrow cord or peripheral blood from a donor to a recipient in case of an allogeneic transplantation or from the same patient in case of an autologous transplantation. 1 Stem Cells are harvested in vitro and returned to the individual as part of the transplantation procedure. The goal of HSCT is to achieve engraftment of the administered cells, thus resulting in the recipient's lymphohematopoietic system derived from the HCT graft. The ultimate goal of many HCT protocols is to achieve optimal graft-versus-tumor (GVT) activity in patients with malignant disease. 2 From the time of the first Hematopoietic Stem Cell transplant that was reported by JM Goldman in the late '70's, 3 bone marrow transplantation has been used as a treatment of choice in allogeneic transplantation and has shown an improvement in the outcome of a wide array of disorders including leukemia, lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), myeloproliferative disorders, congenital immunodeficiencies, enzyme deficiencies, bone marrow (BM) failure syndromes and hemoglobinopathies. 4 However, significant morbidity and mortality is associated with allogeneic HCT due to regimen-related toxicity (RRT), 5 infection, 6 and graft versus host disease (GVHD), 7 a recommendation regarding transplantation for the individual ABSTrACT Background: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) involves the infusion of hematopoietic stem cells from a suitable donor to a patient who has undergone chemotherapy. Stem Cell transplantation is used for the treatment for a wide variety of diseases, including leukemia and lymphoma. Purpose: This study highlights prevention strategies of infectious diseases among HSCT donors and recipients in our institute as guided by International guidelines. We aim to highlight the strategy for extensive screening of HIV, Hepatitis B and C, CMV infection and syphilis cases in all the stem cell units stored in our facility Methods: We searched the institutional database to identify cases of infectious diseases among HSC transplants. Extensive donor evaluation was conducted through screening and laboratory infectious disease testing for HIV, Hepatitis B and C, CMV infection and syphilis. results: Between 1996 and 2014, 263 consecutive adult HSCT were performed. An approximate equal number of autologous and allogeneic HSC collections were undertaken. The median age for autologous donors was 35 years, whereas that of allogeneic donors is 25 years. Of the 263 stem cell donors, we found 18 patients (autologous) and 2 donors (allogeneic) to be infected. We did not find any of the donors infected with HIV by the serology as well as the NAT testing protocol Conclusion: Donor screening and testing is the most critical parameter in stem cell transplantation in order to ensure the safety of the product to be transplanted.

National laws of a particular country take precedence over international laws. Thus, concerns pertaining to the likelihood of the disorder within the potential donor population is highly dependent upon the donor's geographic location. Severity is related to the consequences of the disorder and ease of managing these consequences. We have included pathogenic conditions of highly pertinent disorders 21-23 which include HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human T-cell leukemia viruses type I and II (HTLV-I and HTLV-II), and West Nile virus. [24] [25] [26] The donor screening regime includes physical examination of the donor, history of previous donation and review of medical records. This screening must be done preceding donation. 2 ml of the donor plasma was stored in Stem Cell Collection due to the possibility of the development of new risk assessment. This is a critical aspect because discovery of new risk findings necessitates that the potential donor might require further evaluation or deferral. 27 Potential Donors first undergo an HLA matching analysis. The HLA match is done between all the siblings of the donor to find a perfect 6 out of 6 match. Only a perfect match is allowed to donate as part of the directed donation regime. The selected donor's medical history is compiled which includes a complete BMT work up such as Infectious disease screening, complete hematology analysis, blood grouping analysis, biochemistry analysis, microbiology analysis and X ray investigation. Physical examination of the donor is also undertaken with the aim to detect stigmata associated with transfusion transmissible disease. Only those donors that have undergone all the required tests and have no significant findings that can defer Stem Cell donation are allowed to donate. The documentation for the Donor selection is completed. The incidence of low or almost negligible prevalence of Infectious disease is due to the stringent criteria adopted prior to collection of the stem cell sample. We, however do not perform any infectious disease screening of the patient post transplantation.",

In our facility, the BMT workup including infectious disease screening is done 7 days prior to collection of the Stem Cell unit. We perform the NAT testing for HIV, HCV, and HBV on the donor samples so retesting of the donor sample is not required. All samples for PBSC are stored transiently until they are transplanted back to the patient.

There is an almost equal number of autologous and allogeneic units that have been collected of which around 49% are allogeneic donors. We analyzed the data from the infectious disease screening and ascertained that 7.6% of units stored were from donors who were tested positive during the infectious disease screening. We analyzed the infected donors in each of the infectious diseases such as HIV, Hepatitis, CMV-IgM and Syphilis. We did not find any of the donors infected with HIV as per the NAT testing protocol.
