            "text": "Programmed frameshifting is one of the translational recoding mechanisms that read the genetic code in alternative ways. This process is generally programmed by signals at defined locations in a specific mRNA. In this study, we report the identification of hepta-and octo-uridine stretches as sole signals for programmed +1 and \u00c01 ribosomal frameshifting during translation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) ORF 3a variants. SARS-CoV ORF 3a encodes a minor structural protein of 274 amino acids. Over the course of cloning and expression of the gene, a mixed population of clones with six, seven, eight and nine T stretches located 14 nt downstream of the initiation codon was found. In vitro and in vivo expression of clones with six, seven and eight Ts, respectively, showed the detection of the full-length 3a protein. Mutagenesis studies led to the identification of the hepta-and octo-uridine stretches as slippery sequences for efficient frameshifting. Interestingly, no stimulatory elements were found in the sequences upstream or downstream of the slippage site. When the hepta-and octo-uridine stretches were used to replace the original slippery sequence of the SARS-CoV ORF 1a and 1b, efficient frameshift events were observed. Furthermore, the efficiencies of frameshifting mediated by the hepta-and octouridine stretches were not affected by mutations introduced into a downstream stem-loop structure that totally abolish the frameshift event mediated by the original slippery sequence of ORF 1a and 1b. Taken together, this study identifies the hepta-and octo-uridine stretches that function as sole elements for efficient +1 and \u00c01 ribosomal frameshift events.",

            "text": "In all organisms, accurate transfer of genetic information is critical for maintaining their genetic traits. During translation, universal decoding rules would be prevailing and guarantee correct decoding of the genetic code. However, cells do evolve various translational recoding mechanisms to interpret the genetic code in alternative ways. Programmed ribosomal frameshifting is one of these recoding mechanisms. This mechanistically diverse process is well characterized in retrotransposons (1,2), bacteria (3) (4) (5) , insects (6) , animals (7) and animal viruses (8) (9) (10) (11) . Generally, the ribosome can shift its frame during translation elongation either in the forward (3 0 ) or backward (5 0 ) direction, causing +1 or \u00c01 frameshifting. A \u00c01 frameshift event takes place in most cases, such as the gag-pol gene of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (12) , the 1a/ 1b gene of coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (9) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (8, 13) . Examples of +1 frameshifting include GAG3 and POL3 (GAG3-POL3) genes of the retrotransposon Ty3 of yeast (2) , the mammalian ornithine decarboxylase antizyme (7) and the thymidine kinase (TK) gene of herpes simplex virus (HSV) (14) .",

The 1ab polyprotein is translated by a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism, and is a fusion product of ORF 1a and 1b. Through sequence alignment and comparison, a conserved slippery sequence (U UUA AAC) was identified in the 1a/1b region as the slippage site. Evidence provided by Baranov et al. (8) confirmed that a \u00c01 frameshift event did occur during translation of the region. More recently, an atypical RNA pseudoknot and an upstream attenuation signal were shown to regulate this \u00c01 ribosomal frameshift event (8, 16) .

Over the course of cloning and expression of the gene, a mixed population of clones with six, seven, eight and nine T stretches located 14 nt downstream of the initiation codon was found. The existence of these ORF 3a variants was confirmed recently in SARS patients (21) . To examine the expression of 3a variants, full-length clones covering the 3a and 3b regions with six (pSARS-3a/6T), seven (pSARS-3a/ 7T) and eight (pSARS-3a/8T) Ts were constructed (Figure 1a) . In vitro expression of pSARS-3a/6T in the transcription coupled translation reticulocyte lysate system showed the detection of a dominant product of $31 kDa, representing the full-length 3a protein (Figure 1b, lane 1) . In addition, a minor band (3a*) of $27 kDa was expressed, which represents the initiated product from an internal AUG (22) . Interestingly, the 31 kDa full-length 3a protein was also detected when constructs pSARS-3a/7T and pSARS-3a/8T were expressed in the same in vitro expression system (Figure 1b, lanes 2 and 3). The efficiencies of the 31 kDa 3a protein expressed from these two constructs are $32 and 20%, respectively, compared with that expressed from pSARS-3a/6T ( Figure 1b, lanes 1-3) .

Five constructs (pEGFP-3aD1 to pEGFP-3aD5), containing deletions of various regions in ORF 3a, were constructed and expressed in Cos-7 cells (Figure 3a) . The results obtained showed that these deletions did not have significant effects on the expression of the frameshifting product (Figure 3c, lanes 2-7) , suggesting that stimulatory elements may not exist in the surrounding sequences. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the hepta-uridine stretch alone may function as an efficient frameshift signal.",

A Flag tag and a TAA termination codon were added at the 5 0 and 3 0 ends of the clone, respectively (Figure 4a ).

Replacement of the original slippage site (T TTA AAC) with eight Ts in pF-S1ab/8T produced two products similar to the two proteins produced from the construct with the original slippage site (Figure 4c, lane 3) . In construct pF-S1ab/7T, the original slippery sequence was replaced by seven Ts, resulting in the fusion of ORF 1a and 1b (Figure 4a ). The termination product therefore contains both the 1a and 1b regions and is similar to the frameshifting product expressed from pF-S1ab and pF-S1ab/8T (Figure 4a ). The putative +1 frameshifting product was expected to terminate at the original TAA codon for ORF 1a, which is equivalent to the 1a termination product expressed from pF-S1ab and pF-S1ab/8T (Figure 4a ).

At 18 h posttransfection, cells were harvested and lysates prepared. Polypeptides were separated on SDS-12% polyacrylamide and analyzed by western blot with anti-Flag antibodies.

Numbers on the left indicate molecular masses in kilodaltons. destabilizing stem II by mutagenesis significantly reduces the frameshifting efficiency occurred at the SARS-CoV 1a and 1b region. Mutations of stem II were then carried out based on pF-S1ab, pF-S1ab/7T and pF-S1ab/8T, giving rise to constructs pF-S1abM, pF-S1ab/7TM and pF-S1ab/8TM, respectively (Figure 5a ). The wild type and mutant constructs were then expressed in Cos-7 cells. Expression of pF-S1ab showed, once again, the detection of the 1a termination and 1ab frameshifting products (Figure 5b, lane 1) . Expression of pF-S1abM showed the detection of a similar amount of the 1a termination product (Figure 5b, lane 2) . However, the 50 kDa frameshifting product was not observed (Figure 5b , lane 2). These results confirm that mutations introduced into stem II abolish the frameshift event. Intriguingly, when pF-S1ab/8T and pF-S1ab/8TM were expressed in Cos-7 cells, equal amounts of termination and frameshifting products were detected from wild type and mutant constructs (Figure 5b, lanes 3-5) . Similar results were also obtained when pF-S1ab/7T and pF-S1ab/7TM were expressed (Figure 5b, lanes 6 and 7) . These results demonstrate that mutation of a downstream stimulator does not affect the frameshifting efficiencies mediated by the seven and eight U stretches, and reinforce the conclusion that hepta-and octo-uridine stretches are sole elements required for efficient frameshifting.",

Expression of clones with six, seven and eight Ts in an in vitro expression system, bacteria and in intact cells showed detection of the full-length 3a protein. To study the mechanisms that control the expression of the full-length 3a protein from clones with seven and eight Ts, site-directed mutagenesis was carried out based on the construct with seven Ts (TTT TTT TA). The results showed that mutation of any T in the TTT TTT TA significantly reduced the expression of the full-length 3a protein. However, mutation of the nucleotide A immediately downstream of the seven T stretch did not affect the 3a expression, suggesting that the full-length 3a protein is expressed by a +1/\u00c02 frameshifting mechanism and the UUU UUU U is the slippage site. Attempts were subsequently made to identify upstream and downstream regulatory elements by deletion analysis. Neither downstream stem-loop structures and pseudoknots, nor upstream sequences with stimulatory function were identified, suggesting that the hepta-and octo-uridine stretches could function as sole elements for efficient ribosomal frameshifting. This possibility was further confirmed by insertion of seven Ts into the coding region of luciferase gene and by replacement of the slippery sequence of SARS-CoV ORF 1a and 1b with seven and eight Ts. Moreover, mutations introduced into stem II of the SARS-CoV ORF 1b region totally abolished frameshifting mediated by the original slippery sequence of SARS-CoV ORF 1a and 1b, but did not affect frameshifting mediated by the seven or eight U stretches. Taken together, this study demonstrates that the hepta-and octo-uridine stretches are sole elements for efficient programmed ribosomal frameshift events.",

            "text": "Expression of the full-length 3a protein from the construct with seven Ts (with a single-nucleotide insertion) requires +1/\u00c02 frameshifting at the slippage site (UUU UUU U). At present, we do not know exactly whether +1 or \u00c02 frameshifting occurs. Attempts were made to purify the frameshifting products from various expression systems and to determine the precise sequence across the slippage site, but without success. Generally, +1 frameshifting is considered the main event taking place at the slippage site since the phenylalanine tRNA GAA could form perfect pairing in the +1 frame with UUU, but only one base pairing could form in the \u00c02 frame with GAU. Another interesting question is whether the putative +1 frameshifting at the seven U stretch requires ribosomal slippage at both P and A sites. Mutations introduced into the slippery sequence in pF-3a/M1, M2, M3 and M4 would make imperfect pairs at the P site if +1 frameshifting occurs, resulting in the decrease of the frameshifting efficiency. In mutant pF-3a/M5, M6 and M7, perfect base pairs were maintained at the P site in the event of +1 frameshifting. As the expression of the full-length 3a protein was significantly reduced when these mutant constructs were expressed, it suggests that re-pairing at the A site was not successful, resulting in the reduction of the frameshifting efficiency. Based on these observations, it would be reasonable to conclude that a double slippage mechanism is responsible for this frameshift event, and exact base pairing is required. At present, however, we cannot rule out the possibility that a slippage-independent mechanism, such as GAG3-POL3 genes of yeast Ty3 that Figure 6 .

Interestingly, considerably less amounts of the fulllength product in all three expression systems were detected from this construct than that from the construct with seven Ts. It suggests that +1 frameshifting is much more efficient than \u00c01 frameshifting at this position. However, when the original slippery sequence of SARS-CoV ORF 1a and 1b was replaced by seven and eight U stretches, very similar or even higher frameshifting efficiency was consistently observed from the construct with eight Ts. Mutations that destroyed the downstream stimulatory structure did not alter/reverse the frameshifting efficiency of the two constructs, suggesting that either additional sequences located in the region or long range RNA interaction may favor \u00c01 frameshifting.",

            "text": "In addition to the slippery sequence, the majority of the known frameshifting signals also contain a stimulatory element. In some cases, a secondary structure or tertiary interaction, such as a pseudoknot structure downstream of the slippage site, could significantly increase the frameshifting efficiency. In other cases, sequence specific elements, such as the Shine-Dalgarno (24, 25) or sequences partially complementary with yeast 18S rRNA (26) , are required. Furthermore, space between the slippage site and the stimulatory element, especially the downstream secondary structure, also plays a critical regulatory role in the frameshifting efficiency (24) . Although certain stem-loop structures and potential pseudoknot interaction downstream of the slippage site in ORF 3a variants may be formed, deletion of sequence within 100 nt downstream of the U stretch showed that these potential structural elements did not affect the seven U stretch-mediated frameshifting, indicating that either long-range RNA interaction may play a role or stimulatory elements may be dispensable for these frameshifting events. However, the fact that frameshifting was still efficient in other ORF context, such as the luciferase gene, argues against the first possibility. This conclusion was reinforced by the observation that mutation of stem II in the SARS-CoV 1a/1b region totally abolished the frameshift event mediated by the original slippery sequence of ORF 1a and 1b, but rendered no effect on the frameshift event mediated either by the seven Us or the eight Us. Previously, a G-rich sequence was reported to induce net +1 frameshift in HSV TK gene (14) . In this case, the frameshifting efficiency was not augmented by downstream structures and ribosomal pausing (14) . A recent report also showed that ribosomal pausing had little correlation with the frameshifting efficiency (27) .",

Examples include the expression of dnaX in Thermus thermophilus (28) and bacterial IS elements (29) .
