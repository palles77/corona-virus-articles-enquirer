Because of the failure of these polysaccharide vaccines, protein conjugate H. influenzae vaccines were introduced, and have proved to be much more effective. Vaccines conjugated with at least four different carrier proteins have been developed: PRP-T, Hb-OC, PRP-OMP, and PRP-D. Of these, PRP-T seems to be the one which is most immunogenic and has become the most widely used vaccine. PRP-D is no longer used in children because of poor immunogencity. H. influenzae type B (Hib) vaccines may be administered separately or in combination with other vaccines.",

Vaccination is the single most effective tool for preventing communicable disease, highlighted by the achievements of the smallpox and poliomyelitis eradication programs and the rise in infections for which no effective vaccine is available: human immunodeficiency virus, malaria, worms, and tuberculosis. World Health Organization initiatives target acute respiratory diseases in infancy and early childhood with novel immunization approaches. Effective vaccines are needed urgently for viral respiratory diseases, but progress has been disappointingly slow. Vaccine candidates often show reduced efficacy in infancy, in partially immune adults, the immunocompromised, and the elderly. However, several promising vaccines are in clinical trial, and it is likely that vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza will be licensed within the next 5-10 years. Mucosally delivered influenza vaccine is now available, and novel adjuvants offer the prospect of better immunogenicity. Ideally, multivalent mucosal vaccines will be developed that provide protection against a spectrum of respiratory infections in specific target age groups.",

A particular problem is that cross-species transmission of avian influenza (e.g., H5N1 or the 1918 Spanish influenza strains) is not prevented by these vaccines. An important priority is therefore to develop new methods of vaccination that extend the specificity of vaccines, giving at least some protection against newly emerging strains of influenza. Inactivated vaccines have been in use for more than 60 years, but tend to be associated with local side effects (Table 1) . Live attenuated vaccines offer significant advantages, particularly when applied mucosally. They can be highly immunogenic, inducing good serum antibody levels, mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA), and T cell responses. Cold-adapted live influenza vaccines have been widely evaluated in the US and Japan since 1975. Development continues, and a recent live attenuated, cold-adapted influenza virus vaccine was found to be 93% effective against influenza A (H3N2) in healthy children. For example, FluMist (MedImmune) is available for intranasal use in healthy persons aged 5-49 years.

Currently, methods of achieving full attenuation without the possibility of reversion to virulence are being tested, including deletion or insertion of entire genes. It is not clear whether genetically modified live viruses will be acceptable to the regulatory authorities and the public. Purified RSV glycoproteins have also been tested as vaccine candidates, and shown to induce neutralizing antibodies. They are effective in cotton rats and do not appear to enhance pulmonary pathology. Clinical trials have been performed with the F protein (PFP-1), purified by immunoaffinity chromatography from RSV-infected cell lysates. This was tested in seropositive children, inducing an eightfold increase in serum-neutralizing antibodies and a reduced risk of subsequent infection. Further studies in seronegative infants showed that multiple immunizations were required to achieve high antibody titers. A more highly purified preparation (PFP-2) has been tested in children suffering from bronchopulmonary dysplasia and shown to be safe. It is not yet clear if it is effective. Formalin-inactivated parainfluenza vaccine is also nonprotective against infection. Live-attenuated PIV-3 and cold-adapted PIV-3 vaccine candidates are undergoing testing.

A range of animal models has been used for testing, as no single model seems ideal. One particular concern is the possibility of enhancing disease (in a manner similar to that seen with formalin-inactivated RSV and feline peritonitis due to a coronavirus infection of cats), an effect already seen in murine models of SARS. Since SARS has now disappeared, it now seems unlikely that the opportunity will arise to test vaccine efficacy. humans. Initial reports came from Asia where H5N1 IAV was found to cause disease in chickens, big wild animals, and pet cats. Among 129 confirmed cases of H5N1 IAV infected humans, 60 were fatal by the time of writing (October 2005). Infections have been reported in the Netherlands (H7N7), the USA (H7N2), Hong Kong (H9N2), Canada (H7N3), and Egypt (H10N7), leading to fever, cough, and/or conjunctivitis progressing to respiratory failure and death in some infected persons.

The progressive and sustained elevation in pulmonary vascular resistance leads to right heart insufficiency. After the onset of symptoms, the clinical course is unremitting with progressive right heart failure until death. Until the last decade, conventional therapy was limited to digoxin, diuretics, calcium channel blockers, and warfarin anticoagulation. Median survival was 3.5 years. However, therapies now include prostacyclin and analogs delivered intravenously, subcutaneously or by inhalation, endothelin receptor blockers (bosentan), phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (sildenafil), and continuous inhalation of nitric oxide gas. Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease is a form of pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with significant venous involvement. It is usually idiopathic but may be associated with malignant disease or treatment, congenital heart disease, and autoimmune disease. Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease is difficult to treat and pulmonary edema may be exacerbated by vasodilators. Early lung transplantation is the current treatment.",

In 1901, Dr A Ayerza described a syndrome of chronic cyanosis, dyspnea and polycythemia associated with pulmonary artery sclerosis. The etiology of the disease was obscure and obscured further by attributing it to syphilis. Brenner, in 1935, observed the disease to be a manifestation of right heart failure secondary to pulmonary disease. The introduction of cardiac catheterization allowed not only direct measurement of pulmonary pressures but also investigation of the functional state of the pulmonary vascular bed.
