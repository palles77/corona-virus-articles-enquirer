The combined effect of neighborhood geometry (e.g., re-entrant corners, wind incident angle, passage angle, and building separation) on wind flow at the pedestrian level is an active field of research. This study investigates the influence of the wind incident angle and passage width on the wind flow characteristics at the re-entrant corners of cross-shaped high-rise buildings. This study also examines the influence of stagnant zones and wake regions on ventilation potential and wind comfort around the case study arrangements at various wind incident directions. An investigation was performed from 16 wind directions using the standard ke\u03b5 turbulence model with revised closure coefficients. A wind tunnel experiment was conducted to validate the results, which revealed that wind circulation at re-entrant corners was substantially affected by the building orientations and separation. The wind catchment effect within the re-entrant corners and the sheltering effect of buildings at various wind incident directions and building separations are also discussed. Unstable vortices were formed in oblique wind directions; these vortices facilitate contaminant dispersion and wind comfort at re-entrant corners and near buildings.",

Wind flow modeling in urban areas has recently received considerable attention due to an increase in urbanization and high-rise buildings, which directly affect wind flow patterns and urban environments [4] . Urban air quality is a major concern [1] . Dense areas have formed due to the blockage effect from high-rise buildings [5] . Outdoor wind comfort analyses are currently included in building design processes [6] . The majority of building design authorities worldwide recommend an outdoor wind comfort analysis prior to new building construction [6, 7] . To estimate the wind-flow patterns around high-rise buildings within canopies and at the pedestrian level, various numerical techniques have been employed [8, 9] . Due to advancements in modeling techniques, building parameters such as building orientations and separation are analyzed based on the wind flow patterns in the respective area during the design stage. These parameters directly affect the wind flow patterns in the respective area, which alter the surrounding wind environment.",

For example, Stathopoulos [10] examined all existing outdoor comfort criteria, especially wind speed, air temperature, and relative humidity, to ensure thermal comfort around various buildings. Blocken et al. [11] provided a comprehensive review of pedestrian-level wind environment assessments from 1960 onwards. With advancements in computational power, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) marked a breakthrough in wind engineering [12] . Blocken [8, 12] discussed the detailed contributions of CFD in wind engineering over the last 50 years and provided guidelines for accurate CFD simulation. In addition to wind assessments, few researchers, such as Yang et al. [13] who described an approach to establishing a total comfort index, have focused on comfort criteria. Stathopoulos et al. [14] proposed pedestrian-level wind comfort criteria and discussed a knowledge-based approach to building design. Blocken et al. [15] proposed a modification to existing pedestrian-level wind assessment criteria. The majority of previous studies have been limited to wind flow analysis around conventional buildings. For irregularly shaped buildings, previous studies have been limited to wind load and pollution dispersion within the re-entrant bay [16, 17] . Chow et al. [18] investigated wind flow through a re-entrant bay at a building's midlevel. In a similar manner, Cheng et al. [19] examined pollution dispersion and flow through a re-entrant bay. Cook [20] provided an overview of wind flow in the re-entrant corner and bay of various arrangements; however, he did not provide details on wind flow patterns. In addition to wind comfort analysis, this study examines the influence of various wind incident directions and building separations on wind flow within the re-entrant corners of cross-shaped residential building blocks.",

            "text": "This study analyzed common cross-shaped residential building blocks, which are referred to as 'harmony blocks', in Hong Kong (Fig. 1) . A 'harmony block' is a cross-shaped type of high-rise building block with 18 residential flats per floor. According to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, buildings taller than 50 m are referred to as high-rises [21] . Currently, harmony blocks are a mainstream, standard design for public rental housing in Hong Kong. Hong Kong is a densely populated city of more than 7 million people [22] . Compared with other Asian cities, Hong Kong has a unique urban morphology and humid weather. In 2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus spread in Hong Kong, which caused nearly 300 deaths. An investigation found that fatalities occurred in a high-rise cluster of buildings name \"Amoy Garden\". More than 200 casualties were reported above the ninth floor of the buildings, whereas no casualties were reported below the ninth floor. After the investigation, medical professionals reported that the SARS virus may have originated in the 16th-floor bathroom of an infected unit and spread throughout the air-flow path of the building re-entrant bay to other units [23] . Mao et al. [24] recently discussed pollution dispersion and the transmission of infection among congested high-rise buildings in various locations. These incidents highlighted the importance of the orientations of re-entrant corners and bay for proper air ventilation. Studies have suggested that stagnant air reduces pollution dispersion and increases discomfort around buildings, which increases the risk of SARS-like events. Based on this brief review, the influence of wind incident directions on wind circulation within the re-entrant corners has not been established. Appropriate layout pattern and building orientation is very important for proper wind circulation and outdoor wind comfort [25, 26] . In this study, a detailed investigation of wind circulation at the re-entrants corners of cross-shaped buildings from various wind directions at the pedestrian level was performed. This study determines the optimum arrangement for a comfortable outdoor environment based on the wind circulation at the re-entrant corners. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses a wind tunnel experiment, the numerical setup of the case study buildings, and the revised closure coefficients. The results of the case study building arrangements are presented in Section 3. Section 3 also details influence of the wind incident directions and passage width (building separation) on wind circulation and wind comfort. Section 4 presents the study's conclusions.",

This study examines three building separations of 0.054 m, 0.107 m and 0.142 m (15 m, 30 m and 40 m, respectively, in full scale). The case study buildings are residential building blocks. Additional building separations (30 m and 40 m) were considered for greening and other recreational activities. However, this study only conducts a wind flow analysis. In three cases of building separation, the aspect ratio (H/W) was greater than two. The influence of various aspect ratios and flow regimes of the street canyon on flow parameters is well documented in Refs. [29, 30] . An aspect ratio (H/W) > 2 is considered to be a deep street canyon [30] . In this study, however, buildings were distinctly arranged; in all cases, H/W > 2. Fig. 4 shows all four scenarios, which are also listed in Table 1 . Configuration 1 consists of eight building blocks, and configurations 2, 3 and 4 contain seven building blocks, five building blocks and three building blocks, respectively. The number of building blocks was reduced to investigate the blockage effect on wind circulation for various wind incident directions.

The amplification factor, which is based on the building scale, is defined in Ref. [14] . Ng [6] applied the normalized wind speed to evaluate the wind environment at the pedestrian level and proposed pedestrian-level wind assessment guidelines for a case study area in Hong Kong. Ng [6] indicated that a wind speed of 1.0e1.5 m/s is required at the pedestrian level (height of 2 m) for a comfortable environment around buildings. In Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Observatory provides the mean wind speed and direction. An annual mean wind speed of 3.1 m/s at a height of 90 m and a prevailing wind direction of east-southeast are observed throughout the year (Hong Kong Observatory). According to the Hong Kong Observatory, the mean wind speed is 6e8 m/s at a height of 500 m [6] . Therefore, a normalized wind speed (NWS) range of approximately 0.25e0.3 is required for a comfortable environment in relation to this height [6] . Ng [6] indicated a wind speed ratio of 0.3 in open spaces in Hong Kong. This study considered the wind assessment criteria discussed by Ng [6] to evaluate a pedestrian-level wind environment. The reference wind velocity within the wind tunnel was set to 10 m/s at a height of 1.8 m for the wind tunnel. A neutral boundary layer profile that was characterized by the power law exponent of 0.15 was constructed [31] . The roughness length was set to 0.013 m in the experiment and simulation [31] . The wind velocity at the pedestrian level was normalized using the reference wind speed. Based on the Ng [6] study, three NWS limits were defined for the wind flow assessment in this study. Table 2 lists the three NWS regions that were defined for the case study analysis. This study evaluated pedestrian-level wind flow regions around the case study arrangements and within the re-entrant corners using the criteria listed in Table 2 .

In addition, Janssen et al.

Therefore, RANS steady analysis is preferred to transient analysis for wind flow assessment due to the high computational cost of transient analysis [33, 34] .

Instead of developing novel models, certain researchers have attempted to modify the closure coefficients of the original SKE turbulence model. For instance, Richards et al.

Although these coefficients differ in numerous aspects the purpose of the modifications was to reduce uncertainties in the quantities of interest. For additional details regarding the different models and closure coefficients, please refer to [46] . The majority of recently modified closure coefficients have been developed to serve specific needs and particular flow conditions.

The sand grain-based roughness modification (k s -type) was employed for the ground surface [50] , of which the parameters k s \u00bc 0.18 and C s \u00bc 0.7 were determined using the roughness length z 0 \u00bc 0.013 m. The building surface was considered to be smooth. Symmetry boundary conditions were imposed on the upper and lateral surfaces of the domain. The zero gradient condition was applied at the outlet. Various wind incident directions were set with the ICEM CFD tool using the advance multiblocking structured grid generation technique for symmetrical objects. The block rotation tool was employed to rotate the inner block (Block 1) prior to grid generation. After establishing the required orientation, the multiblock-structured grid was generated for all blocks (for additional details, refer to ref. [51] ). Three block orientations were applied to cover all wind incident directions. The grids were generated stepwise; initially, each orientation building arrangement was set at the required orientation, after which the multiblock and grids were generated. Fig. 7(b) shows the grid arrangement, and Fig. 7(c) shows the positions for the wind incident directions of 0 , 90 , 180 , and 270 . Fig. 7(d) shows the grid positions for 22.5 , 67.5 , 112.4 , 157.5 , and 247.5 . Fig. 7 (e) shows the grid positions for 45 , 135 , 225 , and 315 . According to Snyder [52] , a Reynolds number greater than 4000 is required to achieve Reynolds number (Re) independency. In this study, Reynolds number independency was achieved with a Re of 1.1 \u00c2 10 5 , according to the building width (H) and wind velocity at z \u00bc H, which is considerably larger than 4000. To maintain high accuracy, 3D steady RANS equations were solved with double precision using the simulation code Fluent. Among CFD simulation codes, Fluent is commonly employed in building physics for wind flow analysis [8, 32] . A second-ordered discretization scheme for all convection and diffusion terms, and the SIMPLE algorithm was employed for pressureevelocity coupling. Convergence was carefully monitored, and a solution was obtained at a convergence level of 10 \u00c04 for continuity and TKE terms and at a convergence level of 10 \u00c06 for all other terms.",

The finer grid had 3,212,879 hexahedral cells. Grid sensitivity analysis was performed in two steps. In Step 1, the NWS (U/U r ) of the basic grid was compared against the coarse and fine grids (Fig. 8 ). Fig. 8 shows that a smaller difference in NWS was obtained for basic and fine grids than basic and coarse grids. The figure also shows that the performance with the basic grid was superior in terms of accuracy and computational cost. In Step 2, the grid convergence index (GCI) (Eq. (5)), which is based on the Richardson extrapolation [54] proposed by Roache [55] , was calculated to ensure grid accuracy. Table 4 lists the major GCI parameters.

At C7, the NWS was high due to the venturi effect of P1; in a similar manner, the high NWS at C4 was due to the aerodynamic effect of the building corners. The NWS from C9 to C16 decreased compared with C1 to C8 due to the building wake and drag losses. At a \u00bc 0 , the re-entrant corners at the leeward side were inherently covered within the wake region of the buildings; therefore, the magnitude of the NWS in these corners was reduced.

Five prevailing wind directions were considered for Configuration 1. Table 9 indicates that the low wind area decreased as the wind incident angle increased from 0 to 45 and subsequently increased from 45 to 90 .

In Case 1-1-45 , the NWS at all passages was similar due to the equal wind incident angle with respect to the passages. In Case 2-1-67.5 , Passages 1 and 4 faced less wind due to a greater wind angle (67.5 ), whereas Passages 2 and 3 had more wind due to a lower (22.5 ) wind angle. Table 9 reveals that the acceptable NWS range area increased in Case 3 of Configuration 1; however, a high wind speed area also increased compared with Cases 1 and 2. The flow pattern, vortex formation and wake area caused by upstream building drag was redistributed in each wind incident direction. With variations in these parameters, the wind speed regions L, A and H also varied. In Case 1-1-45 and Case 2-1- 67.5 , a smaller low wind speed area was observed.

The findings revealed the importance of the wind incident direction for wind circulation within the reentrant corners of closely constructed high-rise buildings. Based on the aforementioned analysis, significant variations in normalized wind speed at re-entrant corners were observed in various building arrangements. Four building configurations (square-, U-, L-and I-shape) were investigated from various wind incident directions and with different levels of building separation or aspect ratios. The results indicated that wind circulation within the reentrant corners were significantly affected by the wind incident direction and building separations. On the windward side, the difference in the normalized wind speed in the various configurations was reduced due to similar wind incident conditions and flow patterns. However, a major difference was observed on the downstream side due to variations in flow patterns, blockage effect, and building arrangements. At wind incident angles that range from 0 to 90 , a 40% increase in normalized wind speed was observed for the square-shaped building arrangement. Similarly, in U-shaped building arrangements, wind incident angles that ranged from 0 to 180 yielded a 46.6% increase in normalized wind speed. In L-and I-shaped arrangements, increments of 50.36% and 45%, respectively, in normalized wind speed were recorded on the leeward sides of buildings. The aforementioned analysis illustrates that the L-shaped building configuration exhibited the highest wind circulation at the re-entrant corners, which directly improved the ventilation potential compared with other building configurations.",

At an oblique wind angle, the swirl flow at the corners increased, and building interference and the sheltering effect decreased. The stagnation point at the leeward side of the building and the wind catchment effect at the re-entrant corners also contributed to the low normalized wind speed. At a wind incident angle of 45 e67.5 , the wind catchment effect decreased due to an increase in swirl flow at the corners. Fresh air rarely entered the reentrant corners on the leeward sides of the buildings at a perpendicular wind direction. By changing the aspect ratio, wind circulation can be improved on the leeward sides of buildings, as shown in Case 3 (l \u00bc 2.84) for all configurations. In addition, the vortex region shifted outward and diminished with variations in the wind incident angle. An unstable vortex was observed at an oblique wind direction in the re-entrant corners. Previous studies have indicated that an unstable vortex increased wind circulation, which provides suitable conditions for the dispersion of contaminants. At a low aspect ratio, the wind circulation improved within the re-entrant corner, which indicates that the flow rate within the re-entrant corners can be improved with an extensive building separation or suitable building orientations.",

As previously mentioned, each sensor represented a specific area. Among square-, U-, L-, and Ishaped building arrangements, the square-shaped building arrangement yielded a higher average acceptable wind speed area at lower aspect ratios. However, higher wind speed area was infrequently observed. High wind speeds around building is required for contaminant dispersion. Regarding both acceptable and high wind speed areas, U-and L-shaped arrangements produced superior results (Tables 14 and 15 ). In U-and L-shaped arrangements, the L-shaped arrangement produced superior results regarding high wind speed areas at low aspect ratios, which was attributed to unrestricted air movement caused by open sides and low building drag. In an I-shaped arrangement, no major difference was obtained in average acceptable wind speed areas at a low aspect ratio (3.76). However, a small difference was observed at the aspect ratio 2.84 in I-and L-shaped arrangements.",

Of the three cases, the acceptable wind area for a lower aspect ratio was larger than the acceptable wind area for a higher aspect ratio. This was found to be suitable for pedestrian wind comfort. A high wind thrust inside deep, narrow passages or in building corners is common, especially during winter in subtropical regions. The findings indicated that the wind velocity distributions at lower aspect ratio were stable, which is suitable for winter. However, a high wind speed is required in summer to diminish thermal stress. The results revealed that the difference between both sides (nearand far-field) of the normalized wind speed was high at a high aspect ratio. However, for a lower aspect ratio, the difference decreased due to the reduced venturi effect. Wind-dominant conditions were observed around the buildings and within the re- entrant corners, which can be achieved via proper building separation and oblique prevailing wind directions. This study was limited to a wind flow analysis using a steady RANS approach. Numerical errors can be reduced by selected more advanced numerical techniques, such as LES and a hybrid unsteady RANS/LES approach. Future studies will focus on the turbulence parameters, pollution dispersion at the re-entrant corners, and the influence of vegetation on the wind environment from various wind incident directions. 60  33  29  5  7  68  68  27  25  5  5  63  63  32  32  45  4  4  63  65  33  31  3  5  62  63  35  32  2  5  60  60  38  35  67.5  6  8  60  63  33  29  3  5  65  67  32  28  3  3  63  70  33  27  90  13  13  50  54  38  33  8  7  62  65  30  28  8  8  60  63  32 ",
