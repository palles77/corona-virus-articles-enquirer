The main bulk of total passenger growth occurred in emerging markets such as the Middle East and Asia-Pacific, while the more mature North American and European markets were clearly lagging behind. This significant structural change is expected to flatten out over time and projected growth rates up to 2036 are less divergent. Still, it has already resulted in Asia-Pacific taking the lead in terms of aircraft takeoffs. Fig. 5 .1 details the total of 2.8 million departures in January 2016. The effect of this development on airport demand is obvious. Moreover, it is interesting to note that in 2013 just 55 airports handled 50% of global passenger traffic. This high degree of concentration was also reflected in the fact that only AMS, CDG, DXB, FRA, and LHR offered more than 80 long-haul destinations, while 26 others offered somewhere between 40 and 80 (ADL, 2014) . This, in turn, results in a comparatively high share of transfer passengers at primary and secondary hubs as discussed in Chapter 1, The nature of airports.",

Most academic research, for example, indicates improved performance of capital/hub airports (Lin and Hong, 2006; Assaf, 2011; Perelman and Serebrisky, 2012) . Table 5 .2 summarizes major site-specific factors and indicates their relevance for local traffic volumes and/or their resulting (positive or negative) impact on airports. Two prominent and rather topical examples included in Table 5 .2 are the effects of political instability or even terrorist incidents in Turkey and North Africa.

Cost levels appear to be significantly different, driven by different price levels and/or capital spending for expansion of existing or new capacity. (Chapter 8 will investigate the effects of investment spending). The analysis of unit revenue consequentially reveals a very analogous picture for income from airside charges but also commercial revenue (Fig. 5.6 ).

In contrast to these peak values, the lowest shares have been seen at large European airports in excess of 30 million passengers a year in 2012 and for Asia-Pacific airports handling between 10 mppa and 30 mppa in 2013. At these airports, nonaeronautical revenue comprises 39% of total revenue on average during the periods under consideration. It is worth noting that the share of nonaeronautical income at European airports came down from 48% in 2010, accounting for 41% in 2012, and 40% in 2013 on average (ACI Europe, 2012 . At Asia-Pacific, Middle East, and North American airports, however, significantly higher shares in excess of 45% have been generated. The gradual erosion of commercial revenues across Europe is attributed to competition from online retail (\"Amazonation\") and off-site parking options/ ride-hailing apps (mainly Uber and Lyft) as well as changing consumer behavior in a mature market (Davitt, 2015; Steer Davies Gleave, SDG, 2017; Vogel, B. and Cross, 2017) . Together, they make up for roughly one-half of the nonaeronautical revenue across Europe and on global average. Notwithstanding, from a historical perspective, it was the European region driving toward commercialization and a whole new look at airports-and eventually privatization. This is why specifically European airports had frequently been referred to as \"shopping mall plus runway.\" Recent data gives evidence, however, that duty-free and travel retail is increasingly under pressure despite rising passenger numbers. More and more airport operators around the world are facing this dilemma, indicating that the heydays may be over (Butterworth-Hayes, 2017; Beltran, 2018; Rozario, 2017) .",

The objective of its annual review is to identify infrastructure-related charges associated with the turnaround of eight commonly used aircraft types, carrying a typical passenger load on international flights. (Ground handling is not included.) The index is computed by converting the aggregated charges for the different aircrafts in local currency to a single unit of currency, the SDR (cf. Fig. 4 .10) and relate it to passengers. The highest value represents the most expensive airport, which is then indexed to 100 while all others are expressed relative to this. According to LeighFisher, the sample includes virtually all airports handling more than 10 million international passengers p.a. and is intending to represent different approaches to pricing in varying public or private sector environments under diverse regulatory regimes. In addition to this bias toward larger and European airports, another limitation of the \"Charges Review\" is that Johannesburg is the only African sample airport. For the Middle East, only Dubai is covered in 2014 and 2015, while 2012 and 2013 also include Jeddah.

Despite the limitations of the sample and although not fully compatible with ACI's data, this is generally confirming the different regional cost and price levels observed in this (and earlier) chapters. Fig. 5 .10 shows that airports also need to generate income from all sorts of commercial activities, as aeronautical revenue is frequently subject to some kind of economic regulation (limiting airside charges) and not sufficient to cover the airports' total costs (opex 1 capex). This makes it arguable whether or not users pay the full infrastructure cost, as suggested long ago by ICAO (2012 ICAO ( , 2013 . Still, airline associations and representatives request for tighter regulation as discussed later in Chapter 10, Regulatory regime. On the medium-term average, the percentage of aeronautical revenue in relation to total costs is only sufficient to cover the operating expenses but not the capital costs in terms of interest charges and depreciation of assets-above all airside infrastructure such as runways and terminal facilities. Exceptions are Middle East airports, where aeronautical revenue is not even sufficient to make up for operating expenditure, and African airports, where the total cost (including capital cost) is being excelled (102%). This appears to be a rare exception, related to the very high 69% share of aeronautical income in contrast to undersized revenue from commercial activities as displayed in Fig. 5 .7. In general, however, growing commercial revenue appears to be a prerequisite for the airports' ability to modernize and expand to accommodate future traffic volumes.",

Frequently dependent on one or few LCCs, such publicly-also partially EU-funded airport infrastructures-turned out to be not sustainable and poor value for money (European Court of Auditors, ECA, 2014).",

Extreme pressure was exerted on smaller airports owned by cities or regional governments as, for example, German Zweibruecken (ZXW) and Altenburg\u00c0Nobitz (AOC) or Charleroi (CRL) in Belgium. In these cases, the EC concluded that they had received state aid which was not compatible with EU rules and needed to be recovered.Public authorities are allowed to grant support where justified, particularly for improving accessibility of a region and/or significantly contributing to its the uncertainties regarding aviation remain. It is questionable whether the United Kingdom will continue to enjoy the privileges of the Single Aviation Market in terms of future traffic rights and an envisioned transition agreement to buy more time is nowhere in sight. Airbus published its risk assessment in June 2018 and is reconsidering its local engagement and investment, due to British government's slow progress in areas such as customs, border controls, trade agreements, and access to European regulators. It concluded that any form of Brexit-be it harder or softer-will be damaging to the country. This view is being shared by aerospace manufacturers and airlines alike. Manufacturers are concerned about the security of their supply chains, while airlines are worried if they can continue flying their routes (Osborne and Flottau, 2018a,b) . The meaning of a no-deal scenario for market access and airline ownership and control is hardly more than speculation-the same holds true regarding the implications for airports. As of July 2018, the EC maintains that most flights will cease since the UK certificates issued to EU airlines would no longer be valid, neither would EU-issued licenses for UK-based airlines (Saeed, 2018) .",

The analysis of empirical airport data taken from ACI's economic surveys for FYs 2012\u00c015 reveals distinct differences across regions in terms of unit cost and revenue as well as passenger-and landing-related revenue per PAX and aircraft-related revenue per ATM.These effects are resulting from a mixture of various factors. Among them are the consequences of international traffic flows for airport demand as well as sitespecific circumstances, including aviation policy. Diverse economic and market conditions resulting in different price/cost levels add to that.Due to their importance for the economic development of a region, airports have frequently been subject to political activities. Therefore, the chapter feature is on potential effects of aviation policy on regional airports. It is focusing on the EC's (2014) guidelines on state aid and their amendment as of May 2017.
