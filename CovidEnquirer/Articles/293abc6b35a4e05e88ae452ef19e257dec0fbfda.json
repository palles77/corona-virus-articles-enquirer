The glycoproteins produced by eucaryotic cells can have either N-linked oligosaccharides or O-linked oligosaccharides, and frequently both types of structures are found on the same protein (10) . In addition, the number of oligosaccharide chains attached to the protein can vary from only one to many chains. In the N-linked types (described in more detail below), the carbohydrate is attached to the amide nitrogen of asparagine residues that occur in the tripeptide sequences, Asn-X-Ser (Thr)(ll). However, this sequon is not sufficient for glycosylation to occur since many -Asn-X-Ser(Thr)-sequences that are found in pro teins are not glycosylated. It appears that the conformation of the protein around this sequence and perhaps its exposure are critical factors in addition of carbohydrate. On the other hand, in the more common types of O-linked structures such as the mucins, the oligosac charides are attached by O-glycosidic bonds that usually involve GalNAc linked to the OH groups of serine or threonine residues, but there is no known amino acid sequence necessary for glycosylation (12) .",

These sugars may be present in various configurations and combinations and are linked to a ceramide that is made up of fatty acid and sphingosine. These compounds are of considerable importance to medicine since certain gangliosides have been shown to be receptors for diphtheria and cholera toxins, while some cerebrosides are involved in bacterial attachment to animal cells. Since a number of current reviews have covered these compounds in detail, they will not be considered here (13, 14) . A more recently de scribed type of glycolipid is the glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) type, in which a glycan of mannose and GlcNAc (and sometimes other sugars such as galactose) is attached to the membrane phospholipid phosphati dylinositol. These GPI molecules appear to be important in anchoring many proteins to the membrane (15, 16) , and some of the inhibitors of Nlinked oligosaccharide assembly also affect the synthesis of the glycan portion of these anchors. They will be considered in more detail in a later section.",

One obvious way to do this would be to obtain the particular glycoprotein without its carbohydrate and then compare the biological and biochemical prop erties of the unglycosylated form with those of the normal glycoprotein. There are a number of ways to produce glycoproteins without their associated carbohydrate, especially in the case of the N-linked glycopro teins. For example, one can remove the N-linked oligosaccharides with endoglycosidases, such as endoglucosaminidase H (Endo H), which cleaves \"high-mannose\" oligosaccharides between the two internal GlcNAc residues (18) , or peptide glycosidase F, which hydrolyzes most N-linked oligosaccharides at the GlcNAc to asparagine bond (19) . The problem with this approach is that many N-linked oligosaccharides are resistant to cleavage by these enzymes when the protein is in its native state. Therefore, it is necessary to denature the protein in order to obtain complete removal of the N-linked oligosaccharides, making this method untenable for functional studies. Another problem with this approach is that removing the carbohydrate after the protein has been synthesized and has achieved its proper conformation may be quite different physiologically than having the protein synthesized in the cell in the absence of carbohydrate.",

            "text": "A third alternative for preventing glycosylation is to use site-directed mutagenesis to modify the Asn-X-Ser sequon(s) that is glycosylated to one that is a \"non-acceptor\" sequon (23, 24) . The beauty of this method is that one can modify one glycosylation site at a time (assuming that there is more than one) and determine how an alteration at that site affects function. Or one can modify any number of these sites at the same time and compare the various proteins. Two potential obstacles are (1) the gene coding for the protein of interest must be available and (2) one must make the assumption that the change in the amino acid sequence does not itself affect protein conformation. This methodol ogy has provided some valuable insights into the role of asparaginelinked glycosylation. However, if all N-linked oligosaccharide sequons are modified, then the same problem of improper folding or solubility that one finds with tunicamycin would also apply here. Another possi bility is to modify glycosylation rather than prevent it, so that the resulting N-linked glycoprotein contains an altered oligosaccharide structure. One can then determine if and how this alteration affects the biological activity of a given glycoprotein. There are several ways to modify N-linked oligosaccharide structures. For example, the protein of interest can be produced in a mutant cell line that has a defect in one of the biosynthetic enzymes. Cell lines that are missing various glycosyltransferases or processing glycosidases have been isolated, and several excellent reviews have described the various mutants and the techniques for their utilization (25, 26) . In this case also, one must have the gene for the glycoprotein of interest in order to introduce it into the mutant cell line for synthesis of the appropriate protein.",

Such inhibitors and their sites of action are the main topics of this chapter. One disadvantage on the use of such inhibitors in in vivo studies is that all N-linked glycoproteins are affected, and therefore it may be difficult to relate changes in physiology to an effect on the specific glycoprotein of interest. In fact, one criticism that can be levied at the use of inhibitors in most biological systems (and also as chemotherapeutic agents) is that absolute specific ity is seldom if ever achieved. Of course in the above case, if the altered glycoprotein can be isolated from the inhibited (or mutated) cell and its activity compared with the normal protein, either in vitro or in another system, then this criticism can be overcome.",

However, removal of the outermost al,3-linked glucose is quite rapid (\u00a3 1/2 = 5 min ) as compared with cleavage of the innermost glucose (t 1/2 = 20-30 min). Although glucosidase II also can catalyze the cleavage of aryl-a-glucosides such as p-nitrophenyl-a-glucopyranoside, it appears to be fairly specific for al,3-linked glucoses since its activity is inhibited by the al,3-linked glucose disaccharide nigerose, but not by other \u03b1-linked glucose disaccharides (i.e., kojibiose, maltose, isomaltose, or trehalose) (64) . Glucosidase II from pig kidney was re ported to have a subunit molecular mass of 100 kDa and to be a highmannose glycoprotein (65) , whereas the enzyme from mung beans was composed of two identical glycoprotein subunits of 110 kDa, also with high mannose oligosaccharides (some of which probably also contain some glucose residues) (64) . In some animal systems, however, the glucosidase II had quite different subunit molecular weights of around 65 kDa (56, 66) . The localization of the enzyme has also been studied and may vary, depending on the tissue, from being concentrated in rough ER (RER) and smooth ER (SER) in pig hepatocytes (67) to post-Golgi apparatus structures in pig kidney tubular cells (65) .",

Early studies on the processing pathway indicated that there were two or three \"neutral\" \u03b1-mannosidase activities involved in trimming the N-linked oligosaccharide, and these activities were distinct from those of the lysosomal \u03b1-mannosidase (69) . As a result of increasing interest in this area of research, a number of new \u03b1-mannosidase activi ties have been described and current work is aimed at trying to under stand how these various enzymes function in the removal of \u03b1-linked mannoses from eucaryotic cell glycoproteins. In fact, one of the im portant reasons for having a number of specific mannosidase inhibitors (see Section V) is to be able to use them to distinguish among various mannosidase activities, as well as to determine what happens to pro cessing and function of a given glycoprotein when a specific a-mannosidase is inhibited. A well-written review deals with the various amannosidases (70), so these enzymes will be only briefly covered here.",

The characterization of these glycolipids has involved compositional analyses using GC-MS in combination with specific chemical treatments and sequential digestion with exoglycosidases, analysis of glycosidic linkages by methylation analyses, and gel filtra tion and TLC of intact glycans and their degradation products (96) .

Nevertheless, the steps in biosynthesis are proposed to occur as outlined in Fig. 5 . The sequence begins with the transfer of a GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to phosphatidylinositol to form GlcNAc-PI, which then undergoes deacetylation to form GlcN-PI (99) . These reactions have been demonstrated in vivo by labeling studies with 3 H-glucosamine and in cell-free extracts incubated with UDP-GlcNAc. Three mannose residues are then added to the GlcN-PI and these mannoses are all proposed to be derived from dolichyl-P-mannose, rather than from GDP-mannose (see Section IX for experimental evidence). None of these enzymes has been purified and virtually nothing is known about how other sugars such as Gal or GlcNAc are added. In addition, it is not clear when in the biosynthetic pathway the fatty acids are added to the PI, although there is now evidence that the GlcN-PI must be acylated to serve as an acceptor for the first mannose (100) . Once the mannose units have been added, phosphatidylethanolamine serves as a donor of ethanolamine-P, which becomes attached via a phosphodiester bond to the 6 position of the terminal mannose. The signal for GPI addition to the nascent protein resides in a short hydrophobic carboxy-terminal peptide that is removed and replaced by the GPI anchor (101) . This addition of protein to the GPI apparantly occurs on internal membranes, but the details of these biosynthetic steps are not known at this time.",

            "text": "Tunicamycin has been used in many cell culture systems to try and assess the role of N-linked glycosylation in the function of various glycoproteins. Probably the best test of whether tunicamycin is really effective in preventing glycosylation in cell culture is to determine whether it blocks the in vivo incorporation of labeled glucosamine into dolichyl-PP-GlcNAc or the incorporation of [2-3 H]mannose into lipidlinked oligosaccharides. To do this, one can incubate cell cultures in the presence of various concentrations of tunicamycin (usually 0.1 to 10 \u03bcg/ml) for 30 min to 1 hr and then add the labeled glucosamine or mannose to these cells. After an appropriate period of labeling (deter mined experimentally for each cell type), the cell pellet is extracted with CHC1 3 :CH 3 0H:H 2 0 (1:1:1) and then CHC1 3 :CH 3 0H:H 2 0 (10:10:3) to obtain the lipid-linked monosaccharides and the lipid-linked oligo saccharides (116) . One important point here is that the effective concen tration of inhibitor may vary widely depending on the cell system being used, and the optimum concentration needs to be determined in each case. In fact, it has been demonstrated that tunicamycin-resistant mu tants can be isolated and these mutant cells have amplified levels of the GlcNAc-l-P transferase (117) . Thus, it seems reasonable to assume that the level of this enzyme, and therefore the susceptibility of the cell to tunicamycin, may vary from cell to cell or from tissue to tissue.",

For this reason, any effects on glycoprotein function should be thoroughly examined to be certain that they result from the absence of carbohy drate, rather than from the loss of certain proteins. For example, in some of the various studies, at tunicamycin concentrations of 0.1 to 10 \u03bc-g/ml, [ 3 H] leucine incorporation into protein was inhibited from 10 to 60%, while glycosylation was inhibited from 70 to 90%. But again, the important point is that some cell types are much more sensitive to inhibitors than are other cell types. Perhaps one control for some of these studies would be to use other inhibitors (i.e., cycloheximide or puromycin) that are known to block protein synthesis but do not affect carbohydrate synthesis or addition, or some other inhibitors that mod ify the structure of the carbohydrate chain, and compare the effects of these compounds with those of tunicamycin on the function of the particular glycoprotein.",

Thus, no effect of this inhibitor on the secretion of procolla gen from chick embryo cells, secretion of a number of serum proteins from rat hepatocytes, interferon secretion by leukocytes or L cells, secretion of the enzyme /3-iV-acetylhexosaminidase by fibroblasts, and so on was observed (120) .

One rather strange and interesting result that emerged from these studies was the observation that tunicamycin inhibited IgM secretion in hybridoma cells, but did not affect the secretion of IgG. These results led the authors to hypothesize that the differential effects of this inhibi tor were due to factors intrinsic to the respective heavy-chain polypep tides themselves, rather than to some property of the cells (122) .

In general, with all of these receptors, tunicamycin significantly decreased the number of receptor molecules at the cell surface, but did not change the total number of receptors in the cells or the binding affinity of those receptors that were present in the plasma membrane. In some of these studies, the effects of tuni camycin were reversible, and in one study with the insulin receptor, it appeared that the nonglycosylated receptor could become glycosylated after removal of the drug (127) . That would suggest that in some cases, proteins might be glycosylated post-translationally.

That is, the carbo hydrate may protect or somehow prevent the degradative enzymes from attacking glycosylated proteins. Such has been suggested to be the case for fibronectin, acetylcholine receptor, influenza viral hemagglutinin, and various immunoglobulins, just to cite a few examples (129) . In fact, in the influenza system, it was observed that when viral replication was examined in the presence of tunicamycin, the viral envelope glyco proteins could not be detected. However, when a protease inhibitor, such as TCPK or leupeptin, was added to the cells along with the tunicamycin, the viral proteins in their nonglycosylated form could be detected (130) . These studies and others cited above all indicate that the influence of the N-linked oligosaccharides on the protein in question depends on its amino acid sequence, which in turn determines folding and conformation. Thus, the carbohydrate may play a much greater role in affecting or maintaining the conformation of some proteins than that of others.",

With one strain of VSV (called the San Juan strain), tunicamycin prevented viral replication by more than 90% when the virus was grown at either 38 or 30\u00b0C. However, with another strain (called the Orsay strain), the drug inhibited viral replication by 90% when the virus was grown at 37\u00b0C, but there was only 30 to 50% inhibition at 30\u00b0C. Furthermore, when this virus was grown in tunicamycin at 30\u00b0C, the nonglycosylated viral envelope protein (G protein) was detected at the host cell surface, indicating that it was synthesized and targeted in the normal fashion. However, at 37\u00b0C, this protein could not be detected at the cell surface. Finally, studies on the physical properties of these various nonglycosylated proteins also indicated that these proteins differed markedely in their solubility in detergents such as Triton X-114 at the different temperatures (131) . The probable explana tion for such results is that the carbohydrate has a significant role in providing a conformation that has increased solubility as well as stability.",

Thus, in some cases, they may be identical to the various tunicamycin homologs discussed earlier. For example, the streptoviridin components have shorter chain fatty acids than the tunicamycins, as evidenced by the fact that their molecular weights range from 790 to 814, whereas those of tunicamycins are from 802 to 858 (22, 132) . On the other hand, HPLC comparison of the mycospocidin components with those from the tuni camycin complex showed a number of identical components (133) . The corynetoxins are an interesting group of tunicamycin-related com pounds that appear to be involved in or responsible for ryegrass toxicity. In this case, the developing seed heads of annual ryegrass may be invaded by a nematode which then causes a gall to be produced. Some of the nematodes carry the bacterium Corynebacterium rathayi, which produces the tunicamycin analog corynetoxin.

The structure of amphomycin is presented in Fig. 7A . In cell-free extracts of aorta tissue, amphomycin blocked the formation of dolichyl-P-mannose from GDP-mannose, but it did not affect the transfer of mannose to lipid-linked oligosaccharides from either dolichyl-P-mannose or GDP-mannose (37, 38) . Thus, when microsomes were incubated with GDP-[ 14 C]mannose in the presence of enough amphomycin to completely inhibit the formation of dolichyl-P-[ 14 C]mannose, these extracts accumulated 14 C-Man 5 (GlcNAc) 2 -PPdolichol, but they were not able to elongate this lipid to larger sized oligosaccharide-lipids. On the other hand, when dolichyl-P-[ 14 C]mannose was used as the substrate with these extracts, mannose was transferred to oligosaccharide-lipids that contained six or more mannose residues. These studies suggested that the first five mannose residues in the lipid-linked oligosaccharides were donated from GDP-mannose, whereas the next four mannoses came from dolichyl-P-mannose (37) . Similar results were obtained with oviduct tissue (140) and embryonic liver (141) . The isolation of a CHO mutant cell line missing the dolichyl-P-mannose synthase clearly established that doli- chyl-P-mannose was the mannosyl donor for the last four mannose residues (36) .",

Instead, such cells produce a truncated lipid-linked oligosaccharide that is a Man 5 (GlcNAc) 2 -PP-dolichol (i.e., Manal,2Manal,2Manal,3[Manal,6] Man/31,4GlcNAc/31,4GlcNAc-) and then glucosylate this intermediate to produce a Glc 3 Man 5 (GlcNAc) 2 -PP-dolichol (159) (160) (161) . It appears that under glucose starvation conditions, the cells are not able to synthesize dolichyl-P-mannose, but the reason for this lesion is not clear because these cells still do make dolichyl-P-glucose and appear to glucosylate the oligosaccharides. In several cell lines, the effect of glucose starva tion was seen within 20 min after the removal of glucose, as long as the cells were at low to moderate density, but at high density no effect was seen (162) . The glucose starvation phenomenon could be overcome by the addition of glucose, but not the addition of galactose, glutamine, pyruvate, inositol, or glycerol. In rat hepatoma cells that were starved for glucose, a lower molecular weight form of a r acid glycoprotein was produced and this decrease in molecular weight was due not only to the truncated oligosaccharides, but also to fewer oligosaccharide chains on the protein (163) .",

When this compound is given to various animal cells, it causes a similar situation to that seen with glucose starvartion; i.e., cells are unable to produce dolichyl-P-mannose, although they still synthesize dolichyl-PP-GlcNAc and dolichyl-P-glucose. These cells form a Glc 3 Man 5 (GlcNAc) 2 -PP-dolichol and transfer this oligosaccharide to protein (164) . On the other hand, in thyroid slices incubated with CCCP, Man 9 . 8 (GlcNAc) 2 -PP-dolichol intermediates were produced, and a decrease in N-linked glycosylation was observed (165) . In this study, other inhibi tors of respiration such as N 2 or antimycin A caused the same effects. Since some uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation have been reported to disrupt the recycling of the glucose transporter, these compounds may limit the entry of glucose into the cells, thus mimicking the glucose starvation effect. The puzzle here is the same as that mentioned earlier; i.e., Why is the formation of dolichyl-P-mannose inhibited, but not that of dolichyl-P-glucose? Perhaps it could have something to do with the postulation that the dolichyl-P-mannose synthase is a regulatory en zyme and the protein itself undergoes phosphorylation under some conditions.",

Based on some preliminary cell fractionation studies, it was suggested that the presence of glucose on the oligosaccharides of certain glycoproteins might retard the move ment of these glycoproteins from the ER to the Golgi apparatus (175) . Similar results were obtained with fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells when the effect of castanospermine on the LDL receptor was examined. In this case, there was a significant decrease in the binding and endocytosis of LDL when arterial smooth muscle cells were upregulated to produce LDL receptors in the presence of castanospermine. The reason for this decreased binding was shown to be due to a reduced number of receptors at the cell surface rather than to a change in the affinity of receptor for its ligand. Furthermore, the total number of LDL recep tors in the cell did not change in the presence of castanospermine, indicating that this drug did not inhibit the synthesis of the receptor, nor did it affect its degradation. Cell fractionation studies designed to isolate various membrane fractions demonstrated a shift in the distri bution of LDL receptors within the cell compartments and indicated a decrease in receptors at the cell surface and a corresponding increase in receptors in the ER-Golgi membrane fractions (176) .",

One of these compounds is the pyrrolidine alkaloid mentioned earlier and referred to as 2,5-dihydroxymethyl-3,4-dihydroxypyrrolidine (DMDP), which has been found in several plants of the Leguminosae family. In cell culture, DMDP gives the same type of oligosaccharide structure, i.e., Glc 3 Man 7 _ 9 (GlcNAc) 2 , as does castanospermine, although it is much less active as an inhibitor (i.e., higher concentrations are required) (174) . Nevertheless, it is an interesting inhibitor because it demonstrates that a six-membered ring structure is not absolutely required for inhibitory activity, and knowledge of such structures helps us to define the particular structural requirements that are necessary for such biological activity. Along these lines, two other structures that are also interesting glucosidase inhibitors, partly because they are unusual and partly because they show more selectivity than those described thus far, are shown in Fig. 9 .",

Since the time when many of the studies on deoxymannojirimycin were done, several other neutral \u03b1-mannosidases that have different specificities and are enzymes distinct from mannosidase I or mannosidase II have been identified. Some of these enzymes have been found to be resistant to inhibition by deoxymannojirimycin, but there are not enough mannosi dase inhibitors yet known to be able to specifically inhibit some of these activities. In addition, most of these other enzymes have not yet been purified, so they have not been tested against the various processing inhibitors. In animal cells, deoxymannojirimycin inhibited the Golgi mannosidase IA/B and caused the accumulation of glycoproteins hav ing high-mannose oligosaccharides, mostly of the Man 8 . 9 (GlcNAc) 2 structure (191) . This inhibitor, however, did not prevent the secretion of IgD or IgM in cell culture, although the glucose analog deoxynojiri mycin did (192) . Thus the presence of glucose on the oligosaccharides does have a significant effect on the intracellular transport of at least some glycoproteins, but the presence of high-mannose oligosaccharides rather than the normal complex chains does not appear to be a problem in terms of protein secretion. Deoxymannojirimycin was also without effect on the formation and appearance of the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus, the hemagglutinin of influenza virus, and the HLA A,B, and C antigens, as well as on a r aeid glycoprotein and a r protease inhibitor (192) .",

The initial oligosaccharides of the trans ferrin receptor were high-mannose structures because of the presence of deoxymannojirimycin during their synthesis, but during the chase, a small percentage of the recycled receptor underwent processing and attained complex types of oligosaccharide structures, indicating that some of the endocytosed glycoprotein was recycled through the cis-Golgi compartments (193) .

This compound, whose structure is shown in Fig. 10 , is called mannonolactam amidrazone. This compound was found to be a more general mannosidase inhibitor than any of the other currently known com pounds and those shown in Fig. 10 . Thus, the amidrazone not only inhibits the Golgi mannosidase I (IC 50 = 4 \u03bc\u039c) and mannosidase II (IC 50 = 90-100 nM), but also is the first compound that has been found to be a potent inhibitor of the soluble or ER \u03b1-mannosidase (IC 50 = 1 \u03bc\u039c). In addition, the amidrazone also inhibited both the aryl-amannosidase and the aryl-/3-mannosidase, although it was much more effective on the enzyme recognizing the \u03b1-linkage (IC 50 = 400 \u03b7 M for jack bean \u03b1-mannosidase compared with 150 \u03bc\u039c for /^-mannosidase). In cell culture studies, the amidrazone completely prevented the forma tion of complex types of oligosaccharides and instead caused the forma tion of oligosaccharides having Man 9 (GlcNAc) 2 and Man 8 (GlcNAc) 2 structures. It is hypothesized that the reason that this compound is so effective against all of these mannosidases is that it is the first monosaccharide analog that mimics the true half-chair conformation of the cationic intermediate that is believed to be involved in the cataly sis of the \u03b1-mannose glycosidic bond. This compound should serve as a useful model to synthesize other more specific mannosidase inhibitors.",

The initial interest in this compound was due to the fact that it is found in plants that are toxic to grazing animals. In Australia, the major plant having this alkaloid is called Swainsona canescens (200) , while in the United States, various plants of the genus Astragalus contain swainsonine (201, 202) . These plants present a major hazard to the livestock industry and cause severe neurological and skeletal problems in animals that feed on them. Early studies on the inhibition of aryl-a-mannosidases by swainsonine sug gested that its potent inhibitory activity (IC 50 = 1 \u03c7 10\" 7 M) resulted from the structural similarity of the protonated form of swainsonine to that of the mannosyl cation, since the glycosyl ion intermediate is probably formed during natural hydrolysis by glycosidases (203) .",

That swainsonine is actually the causative agent of these symptoms was indicated by feeding pigs either the whole toxic plant (i.e., Astragalus) or swainsonine and showing that both sets of animals exhibited the same symptoms (205) . In these animals, liver Golgi mannosidase II activity was significantly decreased, but strangely enough, a number of lysosomal hydrolases such as amannosidase, \u03b1-fucosidase, and ^-hexosaminidase increased in activ ity. In addition, the activity of various hydrolases in the plasma was also elevated. In sheep fed locoweed, various high-mannose oligosaccharides were found in the urine and the two major oligosaccharides were identi fied as Man 4 (GlcNAc) 2 and Man 6 (GlcNAc) 6 (206) . The relative abun dance of the various oligosaccharides changed over the course of the feeding, but when the feeding was discontinued, the amount of urinary oligosaccharides declined rapidly and reached a baseline within about 12 days. Similar types of high-mannose oligosaccharides also accumu lated in rats and guinea pigs fed swainsonine, but there were some differences in the structures, especially the presence of one or two GlcNAc residues at and near the reducing terminus (207) . These differ ences probably reflect the presence or absence of an endoglucosaminidase in some of these animals.",

            "text": "Swainsonine was the first compound that was shown to inhibit glyco protein processing (186) . In the initial studies, swainsonine was added to the culture medium of MDCK cells and was found to cause a great decrease in the amount of [2-3 H]mannose incorported into complex types of glycoproteins and a corresponding increase in incorporation of labeled sugar into oligosaccharides that were sensitive to digestion by endoglucosaminidase H. In influenza-virus-infected MDCK cells, swainsonine caused the viral hemagglutinin, an N-linked glycoprotein with several complex chains, to migrate more rapidly on SDS gels, and these changes were shown to be due to changes in the structure of the N-linked oligosaccharides (208) . Later studies with purified processing enzymes showed that the site of action of swainsonine was the Golgi mannosidase II and that this alkaloid was inactive toward the pro cessing mannosidase I (188) . In keeping with this site of action, this indolizidine alkaloid also caused the formation of hybrid types of struc tures when it was placed in the culture medium of cells producing various glycoproteins such as the VSV G protein (209) , fibronectin (210) , and BHK cell surface glycoproteins (211) . Swainsonine has been used with a number of cell culture systems to try and determine the role of specific oligosaccharide structures in glycoprotein function. In most of these studies, swainsonine was found to have little effect on the glycoprotein in question, indicating that a partial complex oligosac charide (i.e., hybrid chain) is sufficient for functional activity, at least in tissue culture. For example, swainsonine did not impair the synthesis or export of thyroglobulin in porcine thyroid cells (212) , nor did it affect surfactant glycoprotein A in Type II epithelial cells (213) , H2-DK histocompatability antigen in macrophages (214) , or von Willebrand protein in epithelial cells (215) . It also did not affect the targeting or function of various membrane receptors, including insulin receptor (216) , epidermal growth factor receptor (217) , or the receptor for asialoglycoproteins (218) . The inhibitor did, however, block the receptormediated uptake of mannose-terminated glycoproteins by macro phages. This blockage appeared to be due to the formation of hybrid types of glycoproteins on the macrophage surface, which then reacted with and bound the mannose receptors (219) . Swainsonine proved to be useful in demonstrating the sequence of addition of the various sugars in the N-linked oligosaccharide assembly pathway. Thus, when fucosylation (220) and sulfation (221) of the influenza viral hemaggluti nin was examined in cells grown in the presence of swainsonine or castanospermine, it was found that the hemagglutinin did contain [ 3 H]fucose and [ 35 S]sulfate when the virus was raised in the presence of swainsonine, but not when virus was produced in the presence of castanospermine (or deoxymannojirimycin). These studies suggest that the fucosyltransferase and the sulfotransferase recognize the GlcNAc-Man 5 (GlcNAc) 2 structure as the appropriate acceptor sub strate.",

The substitution of the ring oxygen by a nitrogen apparantly renders the compound metabolically inert but does not prevent the recognition of the compound by glycosidases or perhaps by other carbohydrate recognizing enzymes. Presumably the hydroxyl groups in these inhibitors have the same chirality as the sugar that is a substrate for the glycosidase to be inhibited. Interestingly enough, these inhibitors do not necessarily need to have a six-membered ring structure to mimic the catalytic intermediate that is involved in the substrate recognition or hydrolytic step. In fact, swainsonine best fits as a mannose analog when it is in a staggered or half-chair conformation (203) , and other pyrrolidine or pyrrolizidine ring structures may also assume similar conformations. Molecular modeling studies with these compounds will help to under stand the mechanism of inhibition by some of these compounds. Such modeling studies have been done with some of the mannosidase inhibi tors compared with the mannopyranosyl cation as the active intermedi ate of jack bean mannosidase (230) . However, the synthesis or isolation of other and different inhibitors of these enzymes will add to this infor mation.",

However, these inhibitors did not affect mannose incorporation into dolichyl-P-mannose, nor did they block mannose incorporation from GDP-[ 14 C]mannose into lipid-linked saccharides in cell-free extracts prepared from MDCK cells or from porcine aorta. These results could be explained by one of the following postulations: (a) limitation in the amount of dolichyl-P available to serve as a carrier of the sugars or (b) feedback inhibition in the synthesis of lipid-linked saccharides caused by the accumulation of lipid-linked oligosaccharide resulting from lack of acceptor protein. However, since the synthesis of dolichyl-P-mannose was not inhibited, the feedback mechanism seemed more likely (232) .",

At 1 mM concentrations, this analog strongly inhibits glycosylation but this inhibition is blocked by adding asparagine, further strengthening the idea that the analog is incorporated. However, the erythro-analog was not an inhibitor of glycosylation (238) . Interestingly enough, when the above two amino acid analogs (i.e., \u03b2-hydroxynorvaline and threo\u03b2-fluoroasparagine) were used to inhibit protein synthesis, they also inhibited the incorporation of radioactive mannose into lipid-linked oligosaccharides as demonstrated with cycloheximide and puromycin (232) .

Fur thermore, such inhibitors should also have a potent effect on the gly cosylation of asparagine-linked glycoproteins.

However, mevalonate incorporation into these lipids is unaffected, as expected. Mevalonate, in fact, when added to inhibited cells, can overcome the inhibition with respect to N-linked glycosylation, presumably because it allows dolichyl-P to be formed (239) . On the other hand, in mouse L cells, hydroxycholesterol also affected the synthesis of dolichol and cholesterol, but in this system, there were conditions that gave great fluctuations in cholesterol synthesis but only slight effects on dolichyl-P formation. The authors postulated that there were other points in the pathway that must control the levels of these two lipids (i.e., cholesterol and dolichol) (240) . Cholestyramineis a compound that when fed to animals causes an increase in the activity of HMG CoA reductase and a great stimulation in the incorporation of acetate into cholesterol. However, it did not increase the incorporation of acetate into dolichyl-P (241). On the other hand, feeding animals a diet high in cholesterol would be expected to suppress cholesterol synthesis at the level of the HMG CoA reductase. However, this treatment caused a significant increase in the incorporation of mevalonate into dolichol and dolichol-linked oligosaccharides as well as increased activity of some of the glycosyltransferases that are required for glycoprotein synthesis (242) . The explanation for these data is not clear, but perhaps inhibiting the cholesterol branch of the polyprenol pathway results in the accumula tion of certain intermediates that are key players in other branches of the biosynthetic pathway.",

Compactin, and a number of chemically synthe sized derivatives of this structure (i.e., mevinolin), have been studied extensively because of their enormous chemotherapeutic potential in lowering serum cholesterol levels. In one study, when rat hepatocytes were cultured in compactin for 24 hr, the synthesis of dolichyl-P was decreased by 75-90%, suggesting that dolichyl-P was mainly synthe sized by the de novo pathway and that the CTP-mediated phosphoryla tion of dolichol was of limited use. However, another study (244) indi cated that the dolichol kinase and the dolichyl-P phosphatase played key roles in regulating the cellular levels of dolichyl-P. When com pactin, at concentrations of 1-5 \u03bc\u039c, was fed to sea urchin embryos, it induced abnormal gastrulation. This effect appeared to be due to an inhibition in dolichyl-P formation because these embryos also showed a decreased capacity to synthesize lipid-linked oligosaccharides and glycoproteins. Furthermore the inhibitory effect of compactin on devel opment could be overcome by supplementing the embryos with dolichyl-P, but the addition of cholesterol or coenzyme Q could not overcome the inhibition (245) . Similar results were obtained with mouse embryos, in which compactin and an oxygenated sterol arrested development at the 32-cell stage and left the blastomeres decompacted. Here also, Nglycosylation was effected and this affect could be overcome by adding mevalonate (246) .",

While the signals that direct these proteins to specific sites are known in some cases (e.g., the mannose-6-phosphate receptor for lyso somal targeting has been elegantly described (247) ), in other cases the signals are just beginning to become known.

Most of these pertubants are ionophores that affect the concentrations of vari ous ions in some cellular compartments and may also affect the internal pH of these compartments.

Within 5 min of addition of this compound, most stacked cisternae were converted to vesicles that were scattered throughout the centrosphere region, and by 30 min, the Golgi complexes were completely disassembled. Over the next few hours, the number of vesi cles in the Golgi area decreased concomitantly with an expansion of a predominantly smooth endoplasmic reticulum that consisted of a net work of dilated tubules in continuity with regular RER cisternae, annulate lamellae, and the nuclear envelope. By electron microscopy, viral glycoproteins appeared to accumulate on these membranes and immature virions budded preferentially into the cisternal space. These findings suggest that brefeldin blocks the intracellular transport of newly synthesized cellular and viral proteins immediately distal to the distinct compartment of the ER. The effects of brefeldin were completely reversible and, within a short time after removal of the drug, Golgi cisternae bergan to reappear (256) .",

These studies are consistent with in vivo studies that showed that the earliest detectable effect of brefeldin was the displacement from the Golgi stacks of a 110-kDa protein (258, 259) , and this protein was found to be identical to one of the major coat protein subunits (COPS) of Golgi non-clathrin-coated vesicles, \u03b2-COP (260) . Thus, a simple explanation for the effect of this interesting and very useful compound is that it acts by blocking the budding of coated transport vesicles.

Since the glycan portion of the molecule is essential to this anchoring mechanism, inhibitors of glycan formation should be of considerable interest for determining the role of this anchoring mechanism, as well as for understanding the function of the anchored proteins. As discussed in a previous section, the manno syl residues of the anchor are donated via dolichyl-P-mannose, so inhibi tors that block the formation of this glycolipid should affect anchor formation. Thus, amphomycin was effective in cell-free experiments to demonstrate that the mannosyl donor for the three mannose units of the glycan portion of the anchor was indeed dolichyl-P-mannose (261) . The sugar analog, 2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose, which was previously shown to inhibit dolichyl-P-mannose formation and lipid-linked oligosaccha rides (154) , also altered the synthesis of the GPI-anchored protein alka line phosphatase in JEG-3 cells and caused the accumulation of a proform of the enzyme. This proform was gradually processed into a secretory form by proteolytic removal of the carboxy-terminal hy drophobic peptide (262) . Thus, both of these studies indicated that inhibition of the synthesis of dolichyl-P-mannose can block proteinanchor assembly.",

When mannosamine was included in the growth medium of MDCK cells, it blocked the incorporation of glycosylphosphatidylinositol into GPI-anchored pro teins. Thus, in polarized MDCK cell cultures, this amino-sugar markedely reduced the appearance at the cell surface of a recombinant GPI-anchored protein and converted this apically oriented membrane protein to an unpolarized secretory protein. It also blocked the surface appearance of other endogenous GPI-anchored proteins.

This amino-sugar inhibited the incorpora tion of mannose into GPI intermediates in a dose-dependent and revers ible manner. Mannosamine was shown to be incorporated into the glycan as mannosamine and probably mostly in the second mannose position. Thus, it appears to block further addition of mannose because the next mannose is attached to the 2-hydroxyl of this second mannose. Various smaller sized intermediates were detected in cells incubated in the presence of this drug. As a result, ethanolamine-P could not be added, nor could the protein be transferred to this anchor. This inhibi tion was specific for mannosamine, and other amino-sugars such as galactosamine and trehalosamine were not inhibitory (264) .

For example, in terms of the biosynthesis of the N-linked oligosaccharides, inhibi tors of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide pathway, such as amphomycin, have helped to establish that the mannosyl donor for the last four mannose residues of the Glc 3 Man 9 (GlcNAc) 2 -PP-dolichol was dolichyl-P-mannose, rather than GDP-mannose. Other inhibitors of this path way, such as tunicamycin, have provided evidence to suggest that the carbohydrate portion of the asparagine-linked glycoproteins may play a number of different roles, including enhancing the stability of the glycoprotein, affecting the conformation of the protein, providing a recognition signal for targeting the protein to specific sites in the cell or to uptake from the circulation, providing a receptor molecule for cell-cell adhesion or interactions and so on.

Swainsonine, which is somewhat more specific, still inhibits mannosidase II and lysosomal \u03b1-mannosidase. Can we find, or synthesize, more specific inhibitors that act only on one enzyme? Of course, the answer to that question is not known at this time since the mechanism of catalysis has not been demonstrated for most of these enzymes. However, even if some of these enzymes share a common catalytic mechanism, it should still be possible to narrow the site of action of these inhibitors to groups of similarly acting enzymes. Since there are now several inhibitors that appear to distinguish between glucosidase I and glucosidase II, these two enzymes must differ in their catalytic mechanism or in their active site.

Most of the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of N-linked oligosaccharides or membrane anchors appear to be present in cells in relatively low abundance, and therefore even the purification of these enzymes to homogeneity is difficult.

While this is a viable and logical way to develop new inhibitors, it does have one major shortcoming, which is that this approach cannot provide completely new and novel structures that could lead to even better inhibitors than those that we already have available. In that respect, perhaps we need to take a lesson from nature since evolution has had millions of years to develop all sorts of unusual chemical structures. It is unlikely that penicillin, streptomycin, or bleomycin, to name a few, could have been chemically synthesized de novo without first hav ing been isolated and characterized from natural sources.
