Previous light and electron microscopic studies in rats,5,9 rabbits,6 dogs5 and monkeys' injected with perfluorochemical emulsions have also documented PFCcontaining macrophages in the RES without damage to tissue architecture. The PFC content of liver and spleen decreased over time and organ weights normalized; correspondingly fewer macrophages were observed as this clearance took place. In this study, the clearance of PFC's from organs is similar to that reported by Lutz,2 using a single 10 gm/kg PFC dose. However, the rate of clearance appears more prolonged here than in studies using an exchange transfusion model.5 The more rapid clearance of FDC from all organs, observed here and in previous studies,5 reflects the difference in elimination rate constants for the two PFCS.~ Only slight PFC accumulation was noted in the lung and the small numbers of foamy macrophages observed there also decreased over time. PFC's are eliminated from the body primarily by expiration through the lungs.' In this study, although, some PFC was detected in the lungs, no structural damage due to PFC transport was observed.",
