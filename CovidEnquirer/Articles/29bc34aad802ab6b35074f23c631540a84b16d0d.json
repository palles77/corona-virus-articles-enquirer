The COVID-19 emerged in December 2009 in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread to other regions and countries. The variation in transmission patterns and disease spread in regard to time or among different locations, partially reflecting the public health intervention effects, remains to be quantified. As most transmissibility-related epidemic parameters are unknown, we sought, with minimal assumptions, to estimate real-time transmissibility and forecast new cases using dynamic modelling.",

We quantified the instantaneous transmission rate and relative reproduction number (R t ) of COVID-19, and evaluated whether public health intervention affected the case transmissibility in each province.

Discussions260Here we described transmission dynamic patterns of the COVID-19 out-261 break using time-serial data in Wuhan and 29 provinces in China from Jan-262 uary 20 to February 13, 2020. The instantaneous R t declined from the range 263 was an initial growth from January 21 to 27, 2020 with R t up to 4 followed 273 by a decline in a short period. The increase in R t was in accordance with 274 the increase in transmission, but at a slower rate. There was a dramatically 275 declining trend in the ratio for the transmission rate from January 23 to 28.276 Since January 23, 2020, the Chinese government banned travels into and from 277 Wuhan by air, rail and road access to halt the spread of cases from Wuhan 278 to other cities. Also, almost all provinces initiated the highest level of public 279 health emergency responses during January 23 and 25 including tracking and 280 isolating close contacts with COVID-19 patients, self-quarantine, etc. We 281 speculate that, based on the coincidence of a series of intervention effects, 282 the decline in R t could be due to a series of intervention measures to reduce 283 the transmission rate implemented since January 23, 2020. Wuhan, the reproduction number R t showed a trend of decline in 285 general from 4.9 to 1 on February 2, 2020, although a slight shift upward 286 on January 27 and 28.

Several studies have estimated the basic reproduction number R 0 in a range of 2.2 to 4.0 in Wuhan[2, 3, 11, 12], highly contagious compared to SARS[13, 23, 24,25, 26, 27,28]. One study[13]    estimated R t in 830 cases in Wuhan from December 24 and January 23 and found that R t decreased from 8 to 2.52. The trend is similar to what we observed; however, with the interaction involved, we estimated R t declined and approached the critical threshold at 1 on February 2, 2020.The difference in transmission rates among different provinces highlights the importance of its contact patterns and control measures, given no re-quired immunity obtained in the early outbreak phase[4, 18]. As of January 20, underlying cases imported from Wuhan were the highest in Guangdong, Henan, Beijing and Sichuan. Beijing and Sichuan had the lowest transmission rates (ranging from 0.58 to 0.65), and Heilongjiang, Jilin and Tianjin had the lowest underlying cases but high transmission rates (0.83 to 0.98). This could be related to the extent of efforts in each province to reduce the mentation of control measures results in a 2.6-fold increase in mean epidemic size[16].

Studies, for example, used serial interval estimates based on previous estimations of SARS-Cov[2, 3, 12]. It would be desirable to estimate them from the model itself.The likelihood-based method modelling presented here can be used for this purpose in real-time estimations of epidemiological parameters, with minimal assumptions. We assumed secondary cases are generated according to a Poisson distribution[22, 34]. Our method relies on the inference of transmission among the underlying statistical distribution of the infected cases during the infectious period. It can be used to provide statistical expectations for new case predictions. Large time-series data permit us to estimate the rates on a daily basis. Thus, for the calculations in this study, we choose to use a minimal statistical approach for emerging infectious diseases which is more appropriate and generalizable.Our study is not without limitations. First, our results are based on the diagnosis cases reported by the CDC in China. Underreporting is likely to occur which was not accounted for in our analysis. Among all cases reported until February 11, only 13.8% cases were reported prior January 20, 2020 and among them, 77.6% were among the Hubei province[35]. Since we are most interested in the temporal trend after January 20, the underreporting might not vary greatly with time since then. Second, as there is a series of interventions implemented during subsequent periods, we were not able to distinguish which intervention could be the main driver based on current dramatically up to 14840 in Wuhan and Hubei from February 12, which makes our prediction challenging. Thus we did not provide the predicted cases for Wuhan and Hubei province after February 13, 2020.In summary, we provide transmission dynamic patterns of the COVID-19 outbreak using time-serial data from January 20 to February 13, 2020 in China. The declining trend of R t , as well as ratio for transmission rates, indicate the effects of public health intervention implemented by the government beginning on January 23, 2020. Model prediction results suggested that COVID-19 would be contained in provinces around 19 to 24 February,",
