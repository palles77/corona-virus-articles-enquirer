            "text": "The DSM-III, DSM-IV, DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10 have judiciously minimized discussion of etiologies to distance clinical psychiatry from Freudian psychoanalysis. With this goal mostly achieved, discussion of etiological factors should be reintroduced into the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V). A research agenda for the DSM-V advocated the \"development of a pathophysiologically based classification system\". The author critically reviews the neuroevolutionary literature on stress-induced and fear circuitry disorders and related amygdala-driven, species-atypical fear behaviors of clinical severity in adult humans. Over 30 empirically testable/ falsifiable predictions are presented. It is noted that in DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10, the classification of stress and fear circuitry disorders is neither mode-of-acquisition-based nor brain-evolution-based. For example, snake phobia (innate) and dog phobia (overconsolidational) are clustered together. Similarly, research on blood-injection-injury-type-specific phobia clusters two fears different in their innateness: 1) an arguably ontogenetic memory-trace-overconsolidation-based fear (hospital phobia) and 2) a hardwired (innate) fear of the sight of one's blood or a sharp object penetrating one's skin. Genetic architecture-charting of fear-circuitry-related traits has been challenging. Various, non-phenotype-based architectures can serve as targets for research. In this article, the author will propose one such alternative genetic architecture. This article was inspired by the following: A) Nesse's \"Smoke-Detector Principle\", B) the increasing suspicion that the \"smooth\" rather than \"lumpy\" distribution of complex psychiatric phenotypes (including fear-circuitry disorders) may in some cases be accounted for by oligogenic (and not necessarily polygenic) transmission, and C) insights from the initial sequence of the chimpanzee genome and comparison with the human genome by the Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium published in late 2005. Neuroevolutionary insights relevant to fear circuitry symptoms that primarily emerge overconsolidationally (especially Combat related Posttraumatic Stress Disorder) are presented. Also introduced is a humanevolution-based principle for clustering innate fear traits. The \"Neuroevolutionary Time-depth Principle\" of innate fears proposed in this article may be useful in the development of a neuroevolution-based taxonomic re-clustering of stress-triggered and fear-circuitry disorders in DSM-V. Four broad clusters of evolved fear circuits are proposed based on their time-depths: 1) Mesozoic (mammalian-wide) circuits hardwired by wildtype alleles driven to fixation by Mesozoic selective sweeps; 2) Cenozoic (simian-wide) circuits relevant to many specific phobias; 3) mid Paleolithic and upper Paleolithic (Homo sapiens-specific) circuits (arguably resulting mostly from mate-choice-driven stabilizing selection); 4) Neolithic circuits (arguably mostly related to stabilizing selection driven by gene-culture co-evolution). More importantly, the author presents evolutionary perspectives on warzone-related PTSD, Combat-Stress Reaction, Combat-related Stress, Operational-Stress, and other deploymentstress-induced symptoms. The Neuroevolutionary Time-depth Principle presented in this article may help explain the dissimilar stress-resilience levels following different types of acute threat to survival of oneself or one's progency (aka DSM-III and DSM-V PTSD Criterion-A events). PTSD rates following exposure to lethal inter-group violence (combat, warzone exposure or intentionally caused disasters such as terrorism) are usually 5-10 times higher than rates following large-scale natural disasters such as forest fires, floods, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, and earthquakes. The author predicts that both intentionally-caused large-scale bioevent-disasters, as well as natural bioevents such as SARS and avian flu pandemics will be an exception and are likely to be followed by PTSD rates approaching those that follow warzone exposure. During bioevents, Amygdala-driven and locus-coeruleus-driven epidemic pseudosomatic symptoms may be an order of magnitude more common than infection-caused cytokine-driven symptoms. Implications for the red cross and FEMA are discussed. It is also argued that hospital phobia as well as dog phobia, bird phobia and bat phobia require re-taxonomization in DSM-V in a new \"overconsolidational disorders\" category anchored around PTSD. The overconsolidational spectrum category may be conceptualized as straddling the fear circuitry spectrum disorders and the affective spectrum disorders categories, and may be a category for which Pitman's secondary prevention propranolol regimen may be specifically indicated as a \"morning after pill\" intervention. Predictions are presented regarding obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (e.g., female-pattern hoarding vs. male-pattern hoarding) and \"culture-bound\" acute anxiety symptoms (taijin-kyofusho, koro, shuk yang, shook yong, suo yang, rokjoo, jinjinia-bemar, karoshi, gwarosa, Voodoo death). Also discussed are insights relevant to pseudoneurological symptoms and to the forthcoming Dissociative-Conversive disorders category in DSM-V, including what the author terms fright-triggered acute pseudo-localized symptoms (i.e., pseudoparalysis, pseudocerebellar imbalance, psychogenic blindness, pseudoseizures, and epidemic sociogenic illness). Speculations based on studies of the human abnormal-spindle-like, microcephaly-associated (ASPM) gene, the microcephaly primary autosomal recessive (MCPH) gene, and the forkhead box p2 (FOXP2) gene are made and incorporated into what is termed \"The pre-FOXP2 Hypothesis of Blood-Injection-Injury Phobia.\" Finally, the author argues for a non-reductionistic fusion of \"distal (evolutionary) neurobiology\" with clinical \"proximal neurobiology,\" utilizing neurological heuristics. It is noted that the value of re-clustering fear traits based on behavioral ethology, human-phylogenomics-derived endophenotypes and on ontogenomics (gene-environment interactions) can be confirmed or disconfirmed using epidemiological or twin studies and psychiatric genomics.

Introduction: the three goals of this articles Pitman and Delahanty (2005) have recently emphasized the importance of conceptually driven approaches to stress and fear circuitry disorders research. This conceptually driven article has three main purposes. The first and most important purpose is to present testable predictions which can be falsified in existing databases or in future studies. The second purpose of this article is to attempt to tackle some remaining language barriers between anxiety disorder researchers and evolutionary neurobiologists. The third purpose of this article is to look at the field's conventional wisdom from a new angle, and to propose useful concepts based on research from seemingly distant scientific disciplines. The article's title was inspired by Nesse and Williams' \"Smoke-Detector Principle\" of anxiety, which introduced into psychiatry a highly useful concept based on principles of financial cost-benefit analysis in economics and principles of signal detection analysis in psychophysics.",

            "text": "The author reviews the relevant literature, and presents over 30 empirically testable and falsifiable predictions based on hypothesized neuroevolutionary factors in the etiology of fearcircuitry-related traits. Neuroevolutionary psychiatry, like its sister specialty evolutionary psychology, is not a belief system but a research program, and each behavioral trait must be tested before neuroevolutionary etiologies are accepted Tooby, 1999, 1992) . The null hypothesis is always that a particular anxiety-related trait is not an evolved limbic circuit, but rather an evolutionary design compromise, an evolutionary by-product, a \"spandrel\" or a stochastic manifestation of genetic drift. Regarding the testability of clinical evolutionary hypotheses, also see Nesse (1999) . For clinical reviews, see Nesse (2001a) , McGuire and Troisi (2000) and McGuire et al. (1992) . It should be noted that, unlike neuroevolutionary psychiatry, evolutionary psychology defines itself as a non-clinical field and claims limited use for clinical care or for psychiatric genetics (Tooby and Cosmides, 2005; Tooby, 1999, 1992) . By definition, evolutionary psychology focuses on universal human traits which are species-typical in humans and thus have low heritability (Tooby and Cosmides, 2005; Tooby, 1999, 1992) . In contrast, neuroevolutionary psychiatry, the focus of this article, attempts to offer clinically useful predictions relevant to the research agenda for the DSM-V. Neuroevolutionary psychiatry may also be useful to psychiatric genetics and for research on the human-clade phylogenomicsontogenomics (gene-environment) interface. The overarching hypothesis relevant to clinical anxiety disorders presented herein is that some vanishingly rare brain-expressed allele variants that previously had little survival value (or were deleterious) increased by two or three orders of magnitude during the mid-upper Paleolithic and Neolithic EEA due to new recurring selective pressures that had little effect on earlier hominins or on non-human simians. Several authorities have previously made related observations with regard to non-psychiatric physiological conditions (OMIM, 2004; Hollox et al., 2001; Harvey et al., 1998; Holden and Mace, 1997; Cavalli-Sforza et al., 1994) .",

            "text": "The second purpose of this article is to tackle a few remaining language barriers between anxiety disorder researchers and evolutionary neurobiologists. One terminological barrier may be the lack of clarity among physicians of the technical definition of words such as \"maladapted,\" \"adapted,\" and \"adaptation\" in the evolutionary biology literature. These terms originated with Darwin, and are used in the evolution literature to refer to \"evolved traits.\" In contrast, most clinicians use the colloquial ontological meaning of these terms (which are approximately synonymous with \"maladjusted,\" \"well-adjusted,\" and \"adjustment,\" respectively). To minimize confusion, the author uses the terms \"evolved fear circuits\" in lieu of \"fear adaptations,\" and \"non-fitness-enhancing\" in lieu of \"maladaptive.\" Another source of confusion is that the paleoanthropological terminology has been in flux until very recently. The terminology used in this article is the new consensus terminology (Dawkins, 2004; Wood and Richmond, 2000) ( Table 1) . Some speculations about how to incorporate the neuroevolutionary \"why\" and \"when\" questions into fear circuitry disorders research to produce a comprehensive (who, what, when, where, why, how) investigational approach are presented in Table 2 . The four time-depths cited in this article (12,000 years ago [YA] , 70,000 YA, 20 million years ago [Mya] and 140 Mya) are based on research recently reviewed by Dawkins (2004) . 1.3.

Fear of high elevations was the first mammalian-wide (Mesozoic-era) hardwired fear-circuit empirically documented by Gibson and Walk (1960) . Gibson and Walk's \"visual cliff experiment\" demonstrated that both human toddlers and day-old goats will not walk on a transparent solid surface that gives the impression of walking off a cliff. Clinical studies have similarly supported the innateness of the fear of heights (Poulton et al., 1998; Menzies and Clarke, 1993) . Mammalian-wide hardwired fears, such as fear of heights, are naturally of less interest to anxiety disorders researchers. These are generally considered to be \"normal fears\" and probably have been wired by alleles driven to fixation.

Simian-wide prepotentiated fears were first empirically documented in two experiments by Cook and Mineka (1989) . In the first experiment, they examined whether observer rhesus monkeys would acquire fear responses to evolutionarily relevant stimuli (toy snakes) as compared to evolutionarily neutral stimuli (artificial flowers) after a single viewing of a videotape showing model conspecifics behaving fearfully. Laboratory-reared rhesus monkeys were used to control for prior ontogenetic experiences. Novel stimuli were used for evolutionarily relevant and evolutionarily neutral conditioned stimuli. In the first study, \"snake observer monkeys\" acquired fear of toy snakes simply through observational conditioning. By contrast, \"flower observer monkeys\" watching exactly the same fear performance toward brightly colored artificial flowers did not acquire a fear of flowers. In the second experiment, observational conditioning resulted in rhesus monkeys acquiring a fear of a toy crocodile but not of a toy rabbit. In both studies, this differential conditioning of fear to evolutionarily relevant objects (toy snake and toy crocodile) was maintained beyond a single laboratory session (Cook and Mineka, 1989) . The authors concluded that differences in the associability of evolutionarily relevant and evolutionarily neutral stimuli derive primarily from phylogenetic rather than ontogenetic factors. Cook and Mineka conclude that simians, both human and non-human, may have a phylogenetically prepotentiated predisposition to acquire instantaneously fears of certain objects or situations that may once have posed a life threat to early simian ancestors. They have cogently argued that this predisposition is derived from the selective advantage that those simian ancestors who had rapidly acquired fears of such objects or situations would have had over conspecifics who had not. The scarcity of simians for behavioral research is the main impediment to further enlarging the science base in this field. Buss et al. (Buss, 1999; Buss et al., 1998) list 30 examples of neuroevolutionary-relevant findings that have been empirically derived and widely replicated. Some of these include superior color vision and superior spatial location memory in females, and superior ability to detect, track and predict animate motion in males. Most of these studies were done in non-clinical settings using college students and few involve psychopathology. This is partly because such studies usually require large samples and reliable self-report.",

In a 1988 paper in Science which used this differentiation (Daly and Wilson, 1988 ) the authors provided evidence that a toddler's fear of \"mother's new boyfriend\" is most likely an evolved fitness-enhancing fear circuit. Evolutionary psychologists Daly and Wilson reviewed studies of \"family homicides,\" since they do not depend on self-report. They found that \"19% of Detroit victims in 1972 were related to their killers by marriage compared to only 6% by blood, and 10% of Miami victims in 1980 were marital relatives of their killers compared to 1.8% blood relatives\" (Daly and Wilson, 1988) . In the Detroit study they reported, \"Coresidents related to the killer by blood, whether spouses or not, were more than 11 times more likely to be slain than coresiding genetic relatives\" (Daly and Wilson, 1988) . It is unclear how frequently public policy implications of this research are implemented. To this author, Daly and Wilson's landmark studies suggest that \"intrafamily child abuse\" is actually a misnomer and that the term \"stepchild abuse\" is a better description of the data. Daly and Wilson also note that, \"presently available data do not reveal whether stepmother or stepfather households entail greater risks\" (Daly and Wilson, 1988) , and that there is insufficient exploration of emotional abuse and neglect of stepchildren by abusive stepmothers. Abusive stepmothers are anecdotally reported in most ethnocultural groups studied. Unfortunately, transcultural and ethnic studies rarely provide quantitative data. Among the foraging Ache of Paraguay, \"of 67 children raised by a mother and stepfather after the natural father's death: 43% had died, of various causes, before their 15th birthdays, as compared to just 19% of those raised by two surviving parents\" (Daly and Wilson, 1988) . It is unfortunate that many clinical studies do not use the standard anthropological rule of differentiating between step-child abuse and offspring abuse, because such differentiation may clarify some contradictory findings regarding early abuse and subsequent PTSD. Throughout the mammalian class, intense fear of non-kin adult male conspecifics is widely documented in unweaned mammals. Among chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans, a non-kin adult male conspecific is a common perpetrator of infanticide (and of \"toddlericide\") when encountering an unrelated female of reproductive age caring for an unweaned infant or toddler. (The observation that some toddlers also fear adult males who are blood relatives may be another example of Nesse's Smoke-Detector Principle, described below.) In other words, a survival enhancing Type-1 error (Brugger, personal communication).",

These studies have been lucidly reviewed elsewhere (Hettema et al., 2003 (Hettema et al., , 2001 Kendler et al., 2001 Kendler et al., , 1992 Neale et al., 1994) . Irrational fears examined by Kendler et al. (2002) include, among others, fear of open spaces, crowds, new people, public speaking, public bathrooms, eating in public, spiders, bugs, mice, snakes, bats, other animals, tunnels, other closed spaces, bridges, airplanes, other high places, blood, needles/injection, dentist/hospitals, and diseases (Kendler et al., 2002) . In their seminal paper \"The etiology of phobias,\" which reported results from over 7500 twins, Kendler et al. (2002) conclude that overall, their results \"\u2026are more consistent with nonassociative models of phobia acquisition than with traditional etiologic theories involving conditioning or social transmission. \" Kendler et al. (2002) also note that \"\u2026a growing body of data from both retrospective and prospective studies that suggest that most phobias are acquired nonassociatively (i.e., without the involvement of learning). This theory suggests that the liability to phobias is innate, having arisen from evolutionary selection\u2026\" (Kendler et al., 2002) . Neuroevolutionary psychiatry assumes that both common allele variants and subtype-specific allele variants contribute to irrational fears and phobias. Population genetics and twin studies of irrational fears and phobias conclusively demonstrate that these are polygenic or, at best, oligogenic. The study of Kendler et al. (2001) in which they conducted in-person interviews with both members of 1198 male-male twin pairs (707 monozygotic and 491 dizygotic) is the most relevant in the context of this article. The only two phobias in which Kendler et al. (2001) found that family environment may have an impact on risk are agoraphobia and social phobia.",

The CSAC study included the whole-genome shotgun sequencing of the chimpanzee genome, and more importantly, the genome-wide comparison of recent chimpanzee and human segmental duplications. No CSAC data specifically relevant to stress resilience and to fear-circuitry-related traits are published as of late 2005, but such data are expected to emerge at a rapid pace. It is arguably axiomatic that the vast majority of genomic differences between the two extant hominids (Pan and Homo) are in brain-expressed regions of the genome. Neuroevolutionary psychiatry may thus be one of the medical subspecialties that will benefit the most from the sequencing of the P. troglodytes genome by the CSAC (2005). To date, numerous important general insights into human genomic neuroevolution emerged from the CSAC (2005). For example, as expected, little evidence was found to suggest that the addition of novel gene loci was a major mechanism in human brain evolution. Also, as expected, Alu elements (short interspersed repeats [SINEs]) have been threefold more active in humans since the Homo/Pan divergence. Also, some indirect support was given to the exon-deletion \"less is more hypothesis\" which posits that some loss-offunction mutations or deletions may have been responsible for the tripling of brain size which marked the transition from Australopiths to H. ergaster circa 200 Mya (conceivably by a failure of a suppressor gene which, in the Australopiths, stopped the division of cortical progenitor cells after probably 100 cell divisions and allowed a several fold increase in cortical progenitor cell divisions). Finally, paleogenomics gene-expression studies from the CSAC provide insights into pitfalls which gene-expression studies of postmortem brain tissue in PTSD may encounter .",

Elevated gene dosage of harm-avoidance genes common to all irrational fear and phobia subtypes (and all anxiety disorders?): too much of a good thing DSM-V is likely to conceptualize fear circuitry disorders as dimensional/continuous rather than categorical. In this context, it is arguable that the genome-wide comparison of recent chimpanzee and human segmental duplications by the CSAC is especially relevant (CSAC, 2005) . It is axiomatic that the underlying genetic transmission of stress-triggered and fear circuitry disorders is either polygenic or, as it increasingly seems, oligogenic. The CSAC data suggest that gene dosage is an important factor in conceptualizing continuous behavioral traits. Examination of the 33% of human-duplicated segments which are human-specific found that, compared to P. troglodytes, it is humans who typically have the increased gene dosage. Five million indels (insertion/deletion events) and numerous large segmental duplication events (4-5 megabases per million years) have been found to have occurred in genus Homo since the Homo/Pan divergence 5Mya (CSAC, 2005) .

Until very recently, Richard G. Klein's hypothesis (Klein and Edgar, 2002) that hominin neuroevolution since the Homo/Pan divergence was strongly punctuated by mutations of relatively large effect would have been objected to by some authors who have maintained that the division of a nearly continuous (albeit punctuated) process such as human evolution into epochs is completely arbitrary. Thus, it is important in the context of the time-depth principle that the Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium data (CSAC, 2005) provide strong support for Richard Klein's conclusion that post-Homo/Pan divergence neuroevolution was strongly punctuated by brain-expressed mutations of moderate or large effect in the human lineage, thus providing indirect support for the deconstruction of the \"ancestral fears environment\" into four somewhat distinct subgroups, as conceptualized here by the Neuroevolutionary Time-depth Principle. For example (consistent with Klein's hypothesis), the CSAC study has found that 73% of the affected base pairs since Homo/Pan divergence are in indels larger than 80 bp (insertable transposable elements, microsatellites, and deletions). Commenting on the CSAC data, Li and Saunders (2005) state that Given the short time since the human-chimpanzee split, it is likely that a few mutations of large effect are responsible for part of the current physical-phenotypic-differences that separate humans from chimpanzees and the great apes.",

For example, the ASPM and MCPH genes have been strongly implicated in primary microcephaly in extant humans. These are increasingly considered to be a reversal of a string of advantageous loss-of-function brain-expressed mutations of large effect which occurred circa 2Mya and via a selective sweep, replaced the Pliocene Australopiths with the early Paleolithic Ergasts (Kouprina et al., 2004; Evans et al., 2005; Mekel-Bobrov et al., 2005) . Unsurprisingly, Australopith brain size (around 400 cm 3 ) is identical to that of extant microcephalic humans. Of special interest in the context of this article are the forkhead box p2 (FOXP2) gene mutations (Nokelainen and Flint, 2002) , likely to belong among the major advantageous brain-expressed mutations of large effect responsible for the sudden appearance of the (speech enabled) neurally modern H. sapiens circa 70Kya and thus ushered in the upper Paleolithic. Also of great importance in the context of this article is that the technologies developed by MCPH, ASPM, FOXP2 and other CSAC studies (2005) are also suitable for identifying foot-prints (signatures) of positive selection in brain-expressed genome regions that occurred in the upper Paleolithic and even in the Neolithic (e.g., those leading, via recent stabilizing selections, to fear-circuitryrelated balanced polymorphisms). This has been demonstrated by the studies of Kouprina et al. (2004) , Evans et al. (2005) , and Mekel-Bobrov et al. (2005) . Due to the ongoing thawing of the Siberian, North Russian and Scandinavian permafrost, large quantities of perfectly preserved H. sapiens DNA (and of H. sapiens RNA and H. sapiens enzymes) from possibly hundreds of individuals are likely to be found. Molecular archeogenomic data relevant to fear circuitry disorders in general are likely to emerge and may also confirm or disconfirm (with near forensic certainty) the neuroevolutionary time-depth assignments proposed here for various evolved fear circuitry traits. For example, the techniques developed in the Evans et al. (2005) MCPH study demonstrating that one variant emerged circa 37Kya can be applied to studying genomic mechanisms involved in the group of fear circuitry traits which are posited here to be of upper Paleolithic timedepth (such as compulsive hoarding and social phobia), and to genomic mechanisms involved in PTSD resilience.",

Similar inconsistencies exist in all phobia subtypes. Table 4 lists some examples. This conceptually driven article aims to produce useful cross-fertilization by interfacing research from seemingly distant scientific disciplines and different domains of knowledge. It is partly inspired by Nesse's (2001b Nesse's ( , 2005 \"Smoke-Detector Principle\" of anxiety which draws from principles of financial cost-benefit analysis in economics and principles of signal detection analysis in psychophysics (Nesse, 2005 (Nesse, , 1999 Nesse and Williams, 1994) . Nesse and Williams have pointed out that fire alarms are set to produce many false positives and no false negatives because most people would rather walk down flights of stairs numerous times for a false alarm (false positive) than have a less sensitive alarm (false negative) since consequences may be grave (death by thirddegree burns or by suffocation). In an attempt to obtain a similar conceptual gain by incorporating unfamiliar concepts into anxiety disorders research, the author has coined the term the \"Neuroevolutionary Time-depth Principle.\" The principle proposed here re-clusters most DSM-IV-TR (APA, 2000) fearrelated traits into four broad brain-evolution-based clusters: Mesozoic, Cenozoic, Paleolithic and Neolithic. A putative brain-evolution-based genetic architecture is outlined below as a possible target for future research (Table 3) . This re-clustering of fear-circuitry-related traits is based on the Neuroevolutionary Time-depth Principle which takes into account factors such as the relative role of natural disasters and non-conspecific anthropophagic predators, versus the role of human conspecific (thus mostly non-anthropophagic) predators in driving selection of fear-circuitry-related allele variants (and possibly of relevant gene dosages) in the human genome.",

Extensive research documents that, during simian evolution, a series of retina-expressed mutations that transformed some of the retina's rods into cones spread, resulting in the emergence of bi-chromatic and eventually trichromatic vision. The selective sweep of these retina-expressed alleles in simians is assumed to have been driven to fixation by a switch from being insectivores to being furgvores (fruit eaters).

Furthermore, simians' forest-canopy ecological niche provided good longdistance visibility. Entering enclosed spaces diminished visibility and specifically deprived simians of their color vision advantage. It is of note that, although the human clade diverged from ancestral chimpanzees circa 5Mya, the primary escape behavior of hominins continued to be arboreal for another 2.5 million years (Dawkins, 2004) .

Evolutionarily, there is no reason to expect lactate-triggered attacks to be specific to one narrow psychiatric phenotype such as panic disorder. Some speculations based on behavioral ethology may be useful in this context. Arguably, for the obligatory-terrestrial (arborealityimpaired) large mammals (e.g., zebra, antelope, eland, wildebeest, and gazelle), whose survival is dependent on outrunning large carnivores, tolerating high lactate levels from extended periods of anaerobic metabolism is critical for enabling high terrestrial speed. Neuroevolutionary reasoning thus predicts that, unlike simians, non-domesticated ungulate herbivores (such as those listed above) are less sensitive to high lactate levels. This is an easily testable/falsifiable prediction. On the other hand, in simians (including humans), metabolically costly musculature for high terrestrial speed was arguably not fitness-enhancing for two reasons: 1) their ability to invoke the simian-specific arboreal flight response (a trait which, to the best of author's knowledge, has not been documented in ungulates) and 2) the larger, metabolically more costly brain of simians. Thus, during simian evolution, high lactate levels may have been a reliable signal of impending muscle exhaustion. More speculatively, with regard to other factors triggering acute anxiety and panic attacks in some individuals, it may be of interest that the East African Highlands are the indigenous ecological niche of both Coffea arabica (Ethiopia) and Coffea robusta (Kenya) as well as of H. sapiens. Arguably, the alleles for responding favorably to caffeine are thus the wild-type alleles and caffeine-sensitive individuals may possess recently mutated (possibly Neolithic) minor allele variants.

The mid Paleolithic is the period during which anatomically and mitochondrially modern humans evolved into neurally modern and articulated speech-enabled humans, presumably because of a selective sweep by several brainexpressed mutations of moderate or large effect (Klein and Edgar, 2002) . One of these is probably the mutation that produced the modern FOXP2 locus, which has recently been shown to exist in a different form in P. troglodytes (CSAC, 2005) . Furthermore, analysis of the FOXP2 DNA sequence indicates that it has very low sequence diversity in extant humans suggesting a relatively recent selective sweep that took place after the appearance of H. sapiens circa 200 Kya (Hill and Walsh, 2005) . Mutations in the FOXP2 have been identified as the cause of a syndrome which exists in a single threegeneration pedigree in which a severe speech and language disorder is transmitted as an autosomal dominant monogenic trait. This language impairment is part of a broader syndrome which includes impairment in speech comprehension, articulation, a praxic deficit that involves non-linguistic mandibular movements (brain size, however, is normal). Studies of FOXP2 locus indicate that this disorder is a consequence of haploinsufficiency during embryological development and that the phenotype results from a reduction in gene dosage (Nokelainen and Flint, 2002) . The emerging consensus in paleoanthropology is that this monogenic linguistic and articulation impairment existed not only in H. neaderthalis from which H. sapiens diverged circa 450Kya, but also in mid Paleolithic archaic H. sapiens (200 Kya to 70Kya). The paleoanthropological consensus is that the mid Paleolithic archaic H. sapiens was restricted to using sign language and probably had great difficulties understanding future tense and past tense. The mid Paleolithic archaic H. sapiens was fully anatomically modern, strongly suggesting that they possessed the modern wild-type ASPM and microcephalin genes. However, since speech emerged rather abruptly circa 70 Kya, it is likely that the advantageous FOXP2 mutation was among those which enabled the transition from the mid Paleolithic to the upper Paleolithic. As we have argued elsewhere (Bracha, 2004; Bracha et al., 2005a) , fear-induced fainting is highly likely to be part of the extensive sign language that humans needed during the mid Paleolithic in order to survive inter-group conflict. As we have previously argued, during mid Paleolithic periods of inter-group bloodshed, fearinduced faints served the function of visually (non-verbally, \"non-FOXP2-ally\") signaling to raiding conspecifics that one does not present a danger, thus increasing the odds of survival for a fainting-prone non-combatant. This hypothesis is the only one to the author's knowledge that can explain the age and sex pattern of bloodletting/injury fears (and of its overlapping conditions known under a wide variety of names: psychogenic fainting, the emotion-triggered \"common faint,\" efferentvasovagal fainting, neurogenic fainting, neurally mediated syncope, pseudocardiogenic fainting and neurovascular fainting). A large, landmark epidemiological study of blood injection injury fears (1920 subjects in the Baltimore ECA study) found an overall female-to-male ratio of 2.4:1 (Bienvenu and Eaton, 1998) . The hypothesis that the anthropogenomic origins of blood-injection-injury fears are not earlier than the mid Paleolithic are also consistent with the extensive evidence of widespread habitual nutritional intra-hominin anthropophagi (human cannibalism) which was practiced by early Paleolithic Ergasts. Thus, fainting at the sight of bloodshed-related stimuli is unlikely to be of greater time-depth than the mid Paleolithic. Arguably, the archaic H. sapiens male, which emerged only 200 Kya, was the first predator for whom some humans (primarily young women) were more valuable alive than dead. Others have made similar observations with regard to peritraumatic dissociation (Perry et al., 1995) . Finally, as many authorities have noted, evolution is \"blind,\" and not forwardlooking (Cosmides and Tooby, 1992) . In this context, human brain evolution could not \"anticipate\" a future environment in which having a sharp object penetrate one's skin or seeing one's blood could be anything but dangerous. Epidemiological data in support of the mid Paleolithic threat hypothesis of bloodletting-related fears are accumulating (Bracha, Bienvenu, and Eaton, submitted for publication).",

In the immediate aftermath of intentionally caused disasters, such as terrorism against civilians, epidemics of pseudocardiological fear-induced fainting are to be expected (Bracha et al., 2005a,c) . 2. One of the \"phobia subtype-specific\" loci involved in bloodletting/injury fears may carry a developmentally sensitive gene (existing in a stable polymorphism) in which the expression mechanism is gradually suppressed by pleiotropic androgens such as dehydroxyepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) and testosterone. This is likely to manifest as a decrease in gene penetrance following puberty in males (and possibly following menopause in females). The pleiotropic adrenalcortical androgen DHEA-S is especially intriguing as a possible pre-blood-drawing intervention for bloodletting fears, because, unlike testosterone which decreases, DHEA-S normally increases during extreme fear (Morgan et al., 2004) . A testable hypothesis is that a brief DHEA-S course prior to blood drawing may be beneficial for susceptible individuals.",

The heritability of obsessive-compulsive traits such as compulsive checking is demonstrated by twin studies (Jonnal et al., 2000) . Evolutionarily, compulsive entry-barrier checking most likely became a fitness-enhancing trait when humans began establishing semi-permanent settlements in the upper Paleolithic. Among upper Paleolithic humans, fear of a surprise attack by a predator, either conspecific or non-conspecific, was nearly constant. Similarly, compulsive checking of stoves is likely a conserved hearth checking behavior. Finally, some comorbidities between severe checking behaviors and paranoid traits (but not other psychotic symptoms) would be predicted by neuroevolutionary reasoning. This is another testable prediction. 7.4 . Compulsive washing, compulsive cleaning and obsessive fear of contamination Fears of contamination are also intuitively understood as the pathological tail of an evolved fitness-enhancing fear circuit. Evolutionarily, \"fear of public bathrooms,\" which in some studies is lumped with Generalized Social Phobia, may be better classified as part of OCD as fear of contamination. Although no research data are available, arguably, these patients experience intense disgust rather than \"fear\" in proximity to humanexcrement-related stimuli (disgust circuits may be quite different from fear circuits). Human excrement unquestionably became a major factor contributing to epidemics beginning in the upper Paleolithic. An experimentally testable prediction, which follows from the above neuroevolutionary reasoning, is that, since infections are less easily transmitted from animals to humans, patients with \"fear of public bathrooms\" will be much less disturbed by the sight/odor of excrement of other species (e.g., rabbits or dogs) than the sight/odor of human excrement. A possible objection to the hypothesis that compulsive grooming/cleaning is of upper Paleolithic time-depth is that paw licking in some inbred domesticated canids suggests that these compulsive behaviors have a mammalian time-depth. However, the prevalence of compulsive behaviors in dogs is much lower than in humans. It is thus possible that cleanliness has been intentionally selected into the dog genome by human breeders only in the last few hundred years. Furthermore, little known paleo-archaeological research on upper Paleolithic garbage pits (middens) may be relevant in this regard (for recent reviews, see Tattersall, 1998; Brothwell and Brothwell, 1998) . Paleo-archaeological research strongly suggests that the domestication of wolves into dogs occurred when orphaned wolf pups began scavenging animal bones from upper Paleolithic middens and consequently became imprinted on humans (Brothwell and Brothwell, 1998) . The trait of paw licking may have been selected into the genome of some dogs because of the 15,000-year-long exposure to human middens. Arguably, pups with stronger grooming habits better survived the continuous exposure to infectious human waste. A falsifiable prediction which follows from the above reasoning is that paw licking and other over-grooming behaviors will not be found in undomesticated canids such as hyenas, jackals or wolves.",

            "text": "Until the beginning of the upper Paleolithic, human foragers could only own what they could carry (on either side of their skin, i.e., as subcutaneous fat or on their person). In contrast, in the upper Paleolithic, humans became increasingly settled and food hoarding has long been understood as a behavioral trait that evolved in response to upper Paleolithic nutritional stress. The author posits that a much-neglected factor in the evolution of compulsive hoarding was upper Paleolithic warfare. Human inter-group warfare was nearly constant beginning in the upper Paleolithic (see Keeley, 1996; LeBlanc and Register, 2003 for comprehensive reviews). Evidence for hoarding of non-food items in the upper Paleolithic is extensive. In particular, inordinately large hoards of unused stone axes (which served as both tools and weapons) have been documented (Tattersall, 1998 pp. 139) . Also see LeBlanc and Register (2003) for a review. The paleoanthropological data lead to the prediction that extant males with compulsive hoarding traits will primarily hoard tools and/or weapons. It is especially noteworthy that, unlike most fear-circuitry-driven behaviors, hoarding is more common in males than in females (the only other anxiety disorder with this unique sex ratio is severe clinical social phobia, as briefly discussed below). In the groundbreaking Johns-Hopkins study of 126 subjects with OCD, nearly 30% of the subjects had hoarding symptoms, and hoarding was twice as prevalent in males than females (Samuels et al., 2002) . Importantly, Samuels et al. (2002) suggest that hoarding appears to be transmitted in some OCD families and may differentiate a clinical subgroup of OCD (a conclusion consistent with a growing literature supporting the heterogenous nature of OCD). The unusual male to female ratio (2:1) reported by the Johns-Hopkins group is consistent with neuroevolutionary theory. Hoarding by upper Paleolithic males (presumably of tools and weapons) was arguably more fitness-enhancing than hoarding by females (presumably mostly of food items) since, in the Paleolithic, food storages were vulnerable to rodents, insects, or spoilage (i.e., to fungi and bacteria), or to theft by hostile conspecifics. Weapons, on the other hand, could have been used to protect food storages as well as for obtaining food by raiding neighboring groups during periods of nutritional stress (Keeley, 1997) . A very different pattern of non-food-item hoarding is neuroevolutionarily predicted in extant females. It is posited that an important fitness-enhancing trait among upper Paleolithic females was hoarding of two survival-enhancing items: first, leather foot-coverings for extended forest foraging (boots/ shoes), and second, leather containers for transporting gathered foods (bags). It may be of interest that, during foraging as well as during long-distance migrations, Paleolithic females are believed to have carried two under-arm leather bags: one containing fat/protein-rich foods and the second carrying the unweaned infant. This under-arm positioning of bags facilitated breastfeeding while mobile and easy access to the above high-energy foods. Since leather deteriorates rapidly in the ground, at present, there are no paleo-archaeological data in support of this speculation. However, ongoing paleo-archaeological digs in the Northern Eurasian permafrost (where leather remains intact) may be able to test this and related predictions. More importantly, the predicted sex differences in hoarding patterns discussed above are easily testable in extant humans. Two intriguing (and clinically important) studies by Freeman et al. (1994 Freeman et al. ( , 2003 demonstrate that hoarding patterns can be studied even in severely ill clinical populations. Unfortunately, their data do not inform the issue at hand since all the subjects were combat-exposed veterans. Further research on hoarding patterns using random samples and warzone-unexposed OCD patients is needed. Finally, on a highly speculative note, evolutionary reasoning predicts that both the malepattern hoarding (tools/weapons) and the female-pattern hoarding (shoes/under-arm bags) will be most pronounced in individuals whose geographic ancestry is in regions where foraging (a.k.a. hunting/fishing/gathering) subsistence ended most recently (northern Eurasia, the British Isles, and Japan). One of several epidemiological testable predictions that follows from the above is that significantly higher national consumption of the above hunting/gathering linked consumer goods would be found in high-per-capita-income world regions in which foraging subsistence ended first (e.g., Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Singapore) compared to world regions with similarly highper-capita income in which foraging subsistence ended last (e.g., Japan and Scandinavia). The above hypothesis can also be tested in clinical populations. Elsewhere (also see below) we have argued that, for other evolutionary reasons, acute pseudoneurological manifestations of anxiety will have a higher prevalence in the above world regions in which hunting/gathering subsistence ended first (Bracha et al., 2005c) .",

Nevertheless, moderate heritability of social anxiety traits was demonstrated in the same study . A conceptually driven landmark genomic study has documented an association between social anxiety traits and an (balanced) allele-variant polymorphism in the Beta-1 adrenergic receptor (Stein et al., 2004) . Evolutionary factors contributing to social anxiety traits are cogently articulated elsewhere (Stein, 1998; Stein and Bouwer, 1997; Stein et al., 1996) . Several authorities have argued that, during parts of the human EEA, being stared at by a large group of strangers was frequently associated with potential threat to life. Stated differently, for upper Paleolithic H. sapiens, situations in which an individual was simultaneously scrutinized by a large group of nonsmiling, non-kin conspecifics were more likely than not to be followed by negative consequences. This neuroevolutionary hypothesis can be tested empirically in patients with socialphobia-related traits (e.g., by comparing autonomic nervous system response and neuroendocrine response during visual scrutiny by a large group of non-kin versus a comparably sized group of blood relatives). Previous studies and the DSM-IV-TR cluster together two innate fears of arguably different time-depths as \"social-anxiety-related traits\": 1) a generalized fear of \"new people\"an innate upper Paleolithic \u223c 70,000 y/o fear of non-blood-related conspecifics and 2) fear of public bathroomsan innate Neolithic \u223c 12,000 y/o fear of fecal contamination. Arguably, this clustering is unhelpful in charting the genetic architecture of social-anxiety-related traits. Finally, it may be of note that, with regard to the sex ratio of anxiety disorders, men are generally believed to under-report symptoms of most phobic and anxiety disorders in both epidemiological and clinical studies. Male under-reporting may partly account for the typical sex ratio of anxiety disorders. In contrast, objectively severe social anxiety (severe enough to require hospitalization) presents primarily in males (DSM-IV-TR, 2000, p. 453). In this regard, the sex ratio of severe social phobia (as well as of severe OCD) stands out among anxiety disorders. The high prevalence of clinically significant social anxiety among males is consistent with neuroevolutionary predictions since, in the mid-upper Paleolithic EEA, visual scrutiny by a large group of strangers was more likely to result in loss of life for a male than for a female. Goodall's (1986) research on the patterns of behavior of the chimpanzees of Gombe leads us to predict that, especially in males, symptom severity during meeting \"new people\" will often manifest only when the \"new people\" encountered include three or more men. This prediction can be easily confirmed or disconfirmed in clinical samples.",

            "text": "It may not be immediately obvious that the Neolithic timedepth (circa 480 generations) is of sufficient evolutionary duration for the establishment of allele variant polymorphism via a stabilizing selection. However, the now classic molecular genetic studies of the hereditary persistence of intestinal lactase (HPIL) minor allele variant (i.e., the allele for digesting lactose past age four) are illuminating in this regard. A mutation causing inactivation of the transcriptioncontroller-gene (TCG) that originally suppressed transcription of lactase mRNA at age four permitted consumption of large amounts of fresh milk. This lactase messenger RNA TCG mutation spread (from a Paleolithic single ancestral copy) only in the Neolithic and was probably driven by the domestication of ovine, bovine and other ungulate herbivores. The TCG mutation facilitated the emergence of pastoralism and the subsequent Neolithic expansion into previously uninhabited ecologically harsh regions of Asia (Cavalli-Sforza et al., 1994) . A similar pattern has been documented in Europe during Neolithic expansion into the previously uninhabited Scandinavia. These studies of HPIL have shown that as little as 60 generations were sufficient for the single loss-of-function mutation (which disabled the lactase mRNA transcription-controller-gene) to increase over 90-fold (OMIM, 2004; Hollox et al., 2001; Harvey et al., 1998; Holden and Mace, 1997; Cavalli-Sforza et al., 1994) . Prior to the Neolithic domestication of ungulate herbivores, a trait enabling humans to digest fresh milk past the age of four would have allowed foraging-capable individuals to compete with their unweaned blood relatives for human breast milk during periods of nutritional stress. Competition with unweaned blood relatives for breast milk would have reduced the Paleolithic milk-digesters' inclusive fitness. It is of note that the allele enabling adult humans to digest milk remains the minor allele variant in the global stable polymorphism. (Thus, the majority of extant humans cannot digest milk past age four and obtain calcium primarily from powdered fish bones.) Another relevant insight from the research on HPIL is that alleles over time often rapidly change back and forth between being harmful, then helpful, then harmful again. The allele for digesting milk in adulthood, which first turned helpful in the Neolithic expansion, turned harmful again when humans began living past their reproductive years and became vulnerable to atherosclerosis (Harvey et al., 1998) . Even more relevant in the context of this article is the landmark study by Mekel-Bobrov et al. (2005) cited above which provides evidence that important brain-expressed genes such as the ASPM can also undergo rapid evolution well within the Neolithic time-depth (5800 years).",

There has been almost no previous discussion of neuroevolutionary factors in the etiology of the pseudoneurological (pseudo-localized) symptoms which appear during and in the immediate aftermath of inescapable stress. As others and we have pointed out elsewhere, in light of the increasing threat of terrorist attacks against civilians, more attention is warranted to acute pseudoneurological (pseudolocalized) symptoms. Additionally, more attention is warranted to epidemic sociogenic symptoms (previously known as mass hysteria) which emerge in the immediate aftermath of largescale disasters, especially intentionally caused disasters (Bracha et al., 2005c; Bartholomew and Wessely, 2002; Wessely, 2000) . We have recently proposed that a firm-wired fear circuitry response resembling a severe handicap, such as pseudoparalysis (limping), pseudo-cerebellar symptoms (staggering, astasia abasia), psychogenic loss of sight, or falling to the ground with convulsion-like paroxysms (psychogenic nonepileptic attacks, pseudo-seizures), was selected into some genotypes, specifically during the Neolithic, resulting in a balanced (stable) allele variant polymorphism (Bracha et al., 2005c; Cavalli-Sforza et al., 1994) . During Neolithic periods of warfare, acute pseudoneurological symptoms may have provided a non-verbal message to predatory conspecifics (often raiders from a tribe that spoke a different language) that one is unlikely to be an immediate threat because one is severely injured or severely diseased (even, possibly infectious with an agent that the raiders immune system has not previously encountered?) (Bracha et al., 2005a) . This is consistent with the age and sex pattern of conversive disorders (Boss, 1997 (Keeley, 1996, p. 196) . Also see Keeley (1997) and Ferguson (1997) . The hypothesis that pseudoneurological symptoms are of recent (Neolithic) time-depth is also evinced by the observation that the predisposing alleles were not driven to fixation but rather remained species-atypical. It is especially of note that the molecular phylogenomic techniques developed in Mekel-Bobrov et al.'s (2005) study on the mid-Neolithic (5800 YA) adaptive evolution of ASPM can easily be applied to the Neolithic Time-depth hypothesis regarding the genetic factors contributing to the spectrum of symptoms still often conceptualized in Freudian terms and presently known by the psychoanalytic term \"conversion disorder\", in DSM-IV-TR (APA, 2000). Elsewhere, Bracha et al. (2005c) present six falsifiable predictions and possible taxonomic implications for the forthcoming DSM-V (Kupfer et al., 2002) and for the next edition of the International Classification of Disease (ICD, 2005) . For a discussion of other anxiety disorders which are posited to be of Neolithic time-depth, see section below titled: Towards a science-based DSM-V reconceptualization of anxiety disorders which DSM-IV-TR currently labels as 'culture-bound'.",

(2005e) have argued, based on Perry et al.'s (1995) paper on dissociative symptoms, that the evolutionary hypothesis presented above for pseudoneurological syndromes is highly consistent with dissociation and conversion constituting a continuous spectrum as in the ICD-10 (and hopefully in the DSM-V). We have argued that some psychogenic dissociative symptoms can be conceptualized as the less severe and therefore more common variant phenotype of the Dissociative-Conversive Spectrum. Dissociative symptoms are increasingly believed to be a manifestation of various hyperglutamatergic states. These hyper-glutamatergic states are most often stress-induced, but as we argued elsewhere (Bracha and Chronicle, 2006) , some may be occassionally of other etiologies, such as supra physiological glutamate levels in the diet. Furthermore, extensive research by the West-Haven V. A. (Chambers et al., 1999; Anand et al., 2000; Morgan et al., 2003) strongly suggests that dissociative symptoms may respond to glutamate release inhibitors such as lamotrigine. A clinically relevant testable prediction that follows from the continuity between dissociation and conversion is that various forms of pseudoneurological conversive symptoms may also respond to lamotrigine or other glutamate release inhibitors, especially when used at higher doses. Finally, if conversion and dissociation represent a severity continuum or variant phenotypes, it is likely that dissociative traits can be traced to fear circuits of the same time-depth as the pseudo-localized (conversive) symptoms (i.e., Neolithic time-depth).",

            "text": "A widely replicated but neurobiologically unexplained finding is that different types of Criterion-A adversities (currently known as \"events\") have very dissimilar rates of subsequent PTSD. For example, in the NCS (Kessler et al., 1995 , resilience following fires was found to be high and no significant sex differences were found (PTSD developed in 4% of exposed males and 5% of exposed females). In contrast, the NCS found much lower resilience to combat and to physical abuse, (subsequent PTSD was found to be 39% and 22%, respectively). Research has not yet fully explained why fires are five to ten times less likely to result in PTSD than physical abuse or combat. The lower rates of PTSD following fires require explanation since, of the above three Criterion-A adversities, it is arguably death in a fire (loss of life by third-degree burns or by suffocation) that is the most dreaded. Table 5 below presents some speculations regarding the much lower subsequent rate of PTSD following natural adversities (e.g., forest fires). As very briefly summarized in Table 5 , there may be a direct positive correlation between neuroevolutionary time-depths and the degree of stress resilience. It is posited that adversities such as forest fires, for which the human genome had at least 140,000,000years to evolve, are less likely to result in PTSD than adversities for which the human genome has had a much shorter time to evolve. There are several valid critiques of this hypothesis, such as the subjective nature of self-report, but this hypothesis is falsifiable and these valid critiques are amenable to research. Another testable hypothesis is that, although death by drowning in a flood is arguably more dreaded than death by being shot, PTSD rates in the aftermath of floods of unprecedented size, such as those following hurricane Katrina, will be lower than those seen after warzone exposure. These rates may be more in line with those following forest fires (in the single digits).",

            "text": "Until recently, it was widely assumed that, throughout human prehistory, practically all demic expansions (population migrations) were driven exclusively by the search for new material resources. However, Cavalli-Sforza et al. (1994) have demonstrated that nutritional-stress-driven Neolithic demic expansion progressed on average at a rate of only 1 km per generation. The well documented, sudden long-distance Neolithic demic migrations (e.g., across deserts, through icy mountain passes or to distant islands) are harder to explain merely as a search for material resources. For example, as Jared Diamond (2005) points out in his extensive discussion of the Polynesian Neolithic expansion, \"the thought of a several-day canoe voyage across open ocean [is] intolerable to me, something that only a desperate need to save my life could induce me to undertake\" (p. 130). Based on recent reviews (LeBlanc and Register, 2003; Keeley, 1996; Diamond, 2005) , it is posited here that adversity reminders played a major role in the long-distance Neolithic expansion. Individuals with highly overconsolidated trauma-memory purposely migrated longdistances in search not only of safety but also of visually dissimilar landscapes which triggered fewer trauma reminders (avoidance coping). Similar PTSD-based factors may have also played a role in some earlier documented long distance migrations e.g., across the Alps, the Khyber Pass (Oppenheimer, 2003) and across Wallace's Line (the Java, Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa, Flores crossing). 9. 3 . Suboptimal dosages of harm-avoidance-related genes, and subsequent self selected warzone exposure A second major contribution by Nesse and Marks has been to point out numerous modern (non-EEA) threats to life that are insufficiently anxiogenic (e.g., guns, reckless driving, or crossing busy streets). The time-depth of such threats is extremely short, usually less than a few hundred years. These authors have coined the term \"hypophobias\" (Marks and Nesse, 1997) . There may be some implications of the hypophobia concept to combat-related PTSD. Low-harm-avoidance indivi-duals are over-represented among those who enlist into a fulltime-active-duty warfighter career. Stein et al.'s (2002) twin study has demonstrated that exposure to assaultative trauma is not random, and that additive genetic effects explained part of the variance in exposure to assaultative trauma. Stein et al.' s twin studies are also consistent with the earlier twin studies in military veterans by Lyons et al. (1993) as well as the twin studies by True et al. (1993) which demonstrated low heritability of combat-related PTSD (i.e., compared to most specific phobias, panic disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and autism). True et al. found that:",

Arguably, these are the patients for whom a brief \"therapeutic forgetting\" protocol can be beneficial (and eventually specifically indicated, in lieu of the current, more lengthy psychological interventions). 9. 4 . 21st century warfare versus firm-wired limbic circuits for Neolithic warfare patterns 21st century warfighters are expected to endure warzone exposure usually lasting 6 to 12 months. Such chronic activation of a warrior's locus coeruleus to amygdala circuit did not exist during the EEA since actual combat during the EEA usually lasted only hours or at most a few days. For winning war parties, operational-combat stress were probably followed immediately by several days of high-vagal-tone recuperative behaviors consisting of resting, sleeping, feasting, and other forms of prehistoric male recreation. Bio-anthropological studies have documented this very specific pattern of prehistoric inter-group warfare in the Neolithic and upper Paleolithic. These patterns have been confirmed by several paleogenomic and gene-flow studies of male lineages through the Y-chromosome and of female lineages and female migration patterns through mitochondrial DNA (Underhill et al., 2001; Seielstad et al., 1998) . These studies have also found that, in contrast to the total war patterns of the 20th century CE (and the urban warfare characterizing the early years of the 21st century), inter-group warfare in the upper Paleolithic and Neolithic EEA almost exclusively involved raiding parties of young, mate-less post-pubertal males primarily in search of reproductive resources (LeBlanc and Register, 2003; Larsen, 1999; Maschner and Reedy-Maschner, 1998; Wilkinson, 1997) . One may speculate that, when estimating the risk/ reward odds of initiating armed conflict, the limbic circuits of extant war planners may be firm-wired to perceive organized inter-group violence as it took place during the upper Paleolithic and Neolithic EEA (i.e., a raiding party for a lowrisk attack against an unsuspecting settlement).",

However, as we have argued elsewhere (Bracha et al., 2005a; Bracha, 2004 ) based on the last decade of work on PTSD's proximal-neurobiology, it may be helpful for neurocardiologists to re-conceptualize the simultaneous bradycardia and vasodilatation which are the defining features of fainting during real or perceived inescapable threat as akin to a protective \"self-administered propranolol-prazosin combination\" or (more physiologically accurately) \"self-administered clonidine.\" From the neuroevolutionary psychiatry viewpoint, a rapid switch from tachycardic effroi (fright) to bradycardic faint may prevent progression from traumatic fear to PTSD by diminishing overconsolidational amygdala-driven hippocampal \"searing\" of fear traces. Several landmark studies (Vaiva et al., 2003 (Vaiva et al., , 2000 Pitman et al., 2002; Shalev, 2002) have demonstrated that prolonged episodes of fear-triggered (\"peritraumatic\") tachycardia and of peritraumatic effroi (fright) are both strong predictors of subsequent PTSD. Enhanced CNS noradrenergic post-synaptic responsiveness has been clearly shown to contribute to the pathophysiology of chronic PTSD (Southwick et al., 1993) . This is consistent with the landmark study (Raskind et al., 2003) demonstrating the striking effectiveness of prazosin, a postsynaptic NE alpha-1 receptor antagonist, in the treatment of nightmares in veterans with CR-PTSD. The above is also consistent with the lower number of LC neurons we reported in a recent post-mortem study of three American WWII veterans with warzone-related PTSD compared to four control veterans (Bracha et al., 2005d) . Arguably, prolonged combat-related LC overactivity may lead to what may be termed \"overuse-driven LC neuronal loss.\" The overuse-driven LC neuronal loss may eventually result in upregulation of the denervated post-synaptic noradrenergic (NE) alpha-1 receptors, e.g., in the LC-tobasolateral-nucleus-of-the-amygdala (LC-BLNA) pathway. Arguably, the evolved trait of fright-triggered efferent vasovagal faints during overwhelming inescapable stress (discussed above) may have been evolutionarily conserved as a protective fitness-enhancing trait (shutting down LC firing/sparing the LC/ diminishing NE-driven overconsolidation/preventing upregulation of the denervated post-synaptic NE alpha-1 receptors and thus preventing the enhanced noradrenergic post-synaptic responsiveness in the LC-BLNA pathways and related LC efferents).",

            "text": "It may not be immediately obvious, but neuroevolutionary principles may also need to be considered during the preparation for bioevents such as zoonoses-triggered pandemics e.g. avian influenza pandemics and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Strong affection for domesticated fowl and domesticated pigs evolved in humans for over 12,000 years. In contrast, the agricultural practices likely to create conditions favorable to re-assortment-triggered genomic shift, and to pandemics in general, only appeared with the emergence of cities and societies with very high population density, mostly in the last 4000years. Thus it is posited that epizoonoses and zoonotic pandemics can be conceptualized as human-caused (rather than natural) disasters. The author predicts that both intentionally-caused large-scale bioeventdisasters, as well as natural bioevents such as SARS and avian flu pandemics, will be an exception and are likely to be followed by PTSD rates approaching those that follow warzone exposure. During bioevents, amygdala-locus coeruleus-driven epidemic pseudosomatic symptoms may be an order of magnitude more common than infection-caused cytokinedriven symptoms. For the above two reasons, it is critical that during pandemics and especially intentionally-caused bioevents, rapid telephone screening be conducted for acute limbic-triggered pseudosomatic symptoms as well as for predictors of PTSD (Criterion-A2, tachycardia, etc.) (Bracha & Bienvenu, 2005; Bracha & Burkle, unpublished) . 10 . Red Cross and FEMA Implications. \"Seeking Safety in Numbers\" is a non-survival-enhancing hardwired fear-based decision likely to occur during bioevent disasters Neurally modern humans are hardwired to seek the company of other humans when experiencing hypervigilant fear. As we argued elsewhere (e.g., Bracha, 2004) , unless immediately managed, hypervigilant fear is rapidly followed by an urge to flee (as part of the hardwired hypervigilance, flight, fright, faint, acute stress sequence). The \"flight response\" is hardwired and thus makes common sense both to bioevent victims and to federal emergency management leaders. Consequently, current emergency management practices, including those of the Red Cross and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), are almost set in stone and designed to help disaster victims flee to centralized shelters, rather than shelter themselves in-place (at home). A forceful national effort is warranted to change these engrained disaster-response practices.",

            "text": "What is termed here \"foraging-circuit-driven traits\" is a construct akin to novelty-seeking traits and the construct of hypophobia discussed earlier. During human toddlerhood (although surprisingly little research is available), being electrocuted is arguably the most severe Criterion-A experience possible. Two major risk factors for chronic PTSD, severe pain (Jehel et al., 2003) and extreme fright (Vaiva et al., 2000 (Vaiva et al., , 2003 are simultaneously inflicted on a toddler when he or she is electrecuted. A question relevant to the evolutionary context at hand is why preverbal toddlers insert thin metal objects (e.g., screwdrivers, nails or knitting needles) into electric sockets in the first place. The mode of acquisition of inserting thin straight metal objects into electric sockets is presently unclear. These objects do not share stimulus properties with electric cords, thus observer conditioning is unlikely. However, ample chimpanzeesocioecology research on P. troglodytes feeding habits has found that chimpanzees engaged in \"termite fishing\" by inserting thin straight branches into entry points in termite mounds. Interestingly, this behavior can arguably be better defined as \"foraging for termites\" since it is mostly observed in female chimpanzees and sub-adult chimpanzees including subadult males who are still unable to participate in the hunt for small mammals (e.g., Colobus monkeys which are the main prey of adult male P. troglodytes). The mode of acquisition of termite foraging behavior is intensely debated, and arguably, is at the very least, prepotentiated. Insertion of metal objects into electric sockets by a still-undermyelinated human brain may be a result of activation of the evolved firm-wired termite-foraging circuits. There is a wide consensus among paleoanthropologists that, along with larvae, termites were a source of fat and high quality protein for early hominins (Brothwell and Brothwell, 1998) . The termite-hunting-circuit hypothesis of preverbalelectrocution trauma is safely testable in human toddlers.",

Bienvenu and Eaton's (1998) findings are consistent with the prediction that \"hospital phobia\" is a PTSD-like overconsolidational fear. Arguably, the heritability of blood-injection-injury phobia (narrowly defined as fear of blood, injection or injury) may be underestimated by the misclassification of hospital avoidance, which is posited here to be mostly overconsolidational.

            "text": "More research is also needed on \"dental phobia\" since the available data are inconclusive (Poulton et al., 1997) . Dental phobia most probably a heterogeneous category consisting of 1) an innate fear of sharp objects in close proximity to one's head and neck, 2) innate fear of drowning (choking on saliva) and 3) probably most commonly, a non-innate overconsolidational fear following a very painful dental procedure (Bracha, Vega and Vega, submitted for publication). Important recent research by Jehel et al. (2003) on survivors of a bomb attack in a Paris subway in December 1996 is relevant in this regard. As Jehel et al. (2003) have demonstrated, physical pain/injury during the Criterion-A adversity is a previously neglected risk factor for subsequent overconsolidational disorders such as PTSD. Bracha, Vega and Vega (submitted for publication) have argued that problem with using the term \"phobia\" in a dental-care context is as follows: by definition, phobias involve a fear that is \"excessive or unreasonable,\" which the individual recognizes as such, and in which the anxiety, panic attacks and phobic avoidance are not better accounted for by another disorder, including PTSD. More research is needed, however most individuals with dental \"phobia\" do not recognize their symptoms as \"excessive or unreasonable\" and, in that sense, resemble individuals with PTSD. Our review of the dental-care literature suggests that true (innate) dental phobias (akin to unreasonable fear at the sight of blood or a syringe) probably account for a smaller percentage of cases, and that the vast majority of dental-care anxiety (DA) cases stem from aversive dental experiences. Research has documented that individuals who reported having experienced painful dental treatments and perceived a lack of control in the dental situation were approximately 14 times more likely to also report higher dental fear, and approximately 16 times more likely to report being less willing to return to the dental treatment. Therefore, this psychological condition may be better conceptualized as Posttraumatic Dental-care Anxiety (PTDA), and should be classified as part of the overconsolidational disorders spectrum in the forthcoming DSM-V. 13 .

The second prediction is that Pitman's propranolol anti-overconsolidation regimen (Pitman et al., 2002; Pitman and Delahantly, 2005; Vaiva et al., 2003) will be an effective and useful addition to the standard emergency management protocol for individuals presenting with these three animal injuries. The second falsifiable prediction is based on the finding of Jehel et al. (2003) (discussed above). It is predicted that painful injury will be a key risk factor for subsequent dog, bird or bat phobia. Anecdotally, facial injury from a flock of bats or birds is often seen in rural emergency departments. If dog phobia, bird phobia and bat phobia are noninnate as posited here, these fears can be clustered in a new \"overconsolidational disorders\" category in the DSM-V discussed above with regard to PTSD.",

A clinical imperative for such a reconceptualization is that a failure by primary care clinicians to assume a standard DSM diagnosis of these patients results in a failure to make a referral to psychiatric science-based interventions. Such patients are left to seek non-science-based and often harmful \"alternative medicine.\" A re-conceptualization is also important because cross-cultural and ethnocultural research suffers from the use of unhelpful terms such as \"race\" rather than \"geographic ancestry\" (Bamshad, 2005 ). Geographic ancestry (as self-reported) can easily tackle methodological problems resulting, for example, from the lumping (in research settings) of individuals of Puerto Rican, Cuban, Mexican, south American, Central American and European-Spanish ancestry as \"Hispan-ic.\" Another example of a problematic social construct is \"Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders\" used widely in cross-cultural and ethnocultural research. The construct of \"Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders\" clusters Pacific Islanders (e.g., Samoans) with Americans of North Asian geographical ancestry (Japanese/Koreans). This clustering is scientifically incorrect. As Bamshad (2005) has recently argued, at least in the U.S. and in other countries with high admixture, \"geographic ancestry\" (e.g., self-reported using three-generation checklists or triangular graphs) needs to replace self-reported \"race,\" since geographic ancestry is a much better proxy of relevant allele frequencies and probably also of a person's culture.",

Suzuki et al. from Japan have recently criticized the conceptualization of taijin-kyofusho in DSM-IV-TR (Suzuki et al., 2003) . Suzuki et al. (2003) state that there was \"an erroneous introduction of taijin-kyofusho to the West.\" Furthermore, these authors state, \"the three subtypes of taijin kyofusho are not culturally distinctive phobias in Japan\" and that \"at this stage, the notion that taijin kyofusho is a culturebound syndrome cannot be held.\" Suzuki et al.'s conclusions are consistent with our suggestion that taijin-kyofusho is one of a dozen or so DSM-IV-TR terms that should not be carried over in DSM-V. Instead, taijin-kyofusho may be more coherently conceptualized as comorbidity of any two of the following evolutionarily driven anxiety traits which may be equally prevalent in the West and in Japan. These are three mostly innate and well understood disorders for which science-based treatments are available: Generalized Social Phobia, Body Dysmorphic Disorder, and an obsessive preoccupation with one's personal cleanliness and body odor as part of OCD. 16 . \"Koro,\" \"shuk yang,\" \"shook yong,\" \"suo yang,\" \"rok-joo,\" and \"jinjinia bemar\"",

All consist of an intense acute fear that the external genitalia (in males) or nipples (in females) will retract into the body and potentially cause death. The author posits that these six syndromes are essentially identical to either panic attacks or other well-understood acute anxiety states in which the evolutionarily hardwired sympathetic (Fives F's) evolved acute fear response includes a fitness-enhancing and protective retraction of the external genitalia as part of the freeze-flightfight-fright response. In women, the manifestations include a retraction of the nipples and blanching of the areola, which may be understood as fear-induced cutaneous vasoconstriction. Arguably, the reason why these signs of acute anxiety are usually reported from peri-equatorial countries may simply be that minimal clothing makes them more easily observable. Maintaining the description of these syndromes as \"culture-bound\" may prevent science-based treatment and may be stigmatizing. 17 . \"Karoshi\", \"gwarosa\" and \"Voodoo death\" (a fearinduced malignant syncope?)",

The traditional Japanese diagnosis of karoshi is a medically unexplained sudden cardiac death in a young otherwise healthy male after a public humiliation by a powerful authority figure (karoshi is often translated as \"job stress death\"). Voodoo death is another medically unexplained fear-triggered cardiac death usually reported in young, otherwise healthy males. It is still widely observed in countries with extremely high levels of lethal violence such as Haiti. The author posits that both karoshi and Voodoo death may be identical to FIMS. FIMS (efferent vasovagal syncope of malignant severity) is the most common indication for insertion of a pacemaker in young adults in the US. Malignant (lethal) vasovagal syncope has been perplexing to cardiologists who consider its etiology \"puzzling\" and a \"riddle\" (Benditt et al., 2004; Van Dijk, 2004) , but as we have argued in two recent articles (Bracha et al., 2005a; Bracha, 2004) , reflex vasovagal syncope of malignant severity may simply represent the extreme pathological tail of heart rate variability described above as a key component of fear-induced fainting. FIMS is arguably the best physiological explanation not only for karoshi and for Voodoo death, but also for the historical and ethnographic reports of healthy individuals being \"stricken dead\" by a verbal threat. 18 .

            "text": "The widely held view of agoraphobia is that it is invariably a post-panic-attack fear overconsolidation. If so, \"phobia\" is an inappropriate suffix that warrants reconsideration in DSM-V. Horwath and Weissman (2000) have argued that the National Comorbidity Study (NCS) data and the reanalysis of ECA data are both consistent with Klein's conditioned-avoidance hypothesis of agoraphobia (Klein, 1981) . In its updated version (Kent et al., 2005; Gorman, 2004) , this hypothesis posits an overconsolidation-based avoidance mostly secondary to previous spontaneous orbitofronto-amygdala-circuit-driven panic attacks (Kent et al., 2005) . It is noteworthy that agoraphobia and social phobia are the only two phobias in which found that family environment may have an impact on risk. Nevertheless, moderate heritability of agoraphobia was demonstrated in the same study . The small subgroup of agoraphobia that has no history of panic attacks has been more difficult to explain (even when taking into account the likelihood of poor self-report). In the context of this article, the existence of a primary agoraphobia (with no panic attacks) is predicted by evolutionary reasoning. It is tempting to speculate that primary agoraphobia may be traced back to the fact that humans (medium sized and relatively slow mammals) were partially arboreal until about 3Mya. Thus, early hominins arguably relied on arboreality as their primary escape response (the flight segment of their freeze, flight, fight, fright sequence). Numerous theorists (e.g., Tooby and Cosmides, 1990a; Morgan et al., 2004) have argued that expanding beyond the forested highland indigenous niche and moving into almost treeless wide-open savannahs increased the vulnerability of humans to predation by faster-moving carnivores, primarily large felines, and thus made fear of wide-open (treeless?) spaces a fitness-enhancing trait. A falsifiable prediction is that patients with primary agoraphobia would be less anxious in a virtual reality landscape which is not entirely treeless. Arguably, the anxiolytic effect of nearby tall trees (and affection for tree houses among prepubertal extant H. sapiens) may be a manifestation of these still partly conserved circuits, and may thus be over-represented among first-degree relatives of primary agoraphobia probands (this prediction is testable).",

            "text": "The severity of anxiety symptoms addressed by neuroevolutionary psychiatry is harder to explain as stochastics or spandrels. \"Neuroevolutionary psychiatry\" (as this term is defined in this article) attempts to offer clinically useful predictions relevant to the research agenda for the DSM-V and be useful to psychiatric genetics. It is axiomatic that \"the human ability to unlearn things one has never learned\" (that are innate) is commonly observed. Thus, the common social science critique that innate fears, e.g., of snakes, can often be successfully extinguished by exposure does not contradict their evolutionary-based etiology. As discussed in Introduction, evolutionary psychology focuses on universal human traits which are species-typical in humans and thus have low heritability (Tooby and Cosmides, 2005; Tooby, 1999, 1992) . Nevertheless, a brief discussion of and defense of the sister specialty (evolutionary psychology) may be warranted. The critique that evolutionary psychology is just a collection of untestable Lamarckian Rudyard-Kiplingian \"just so stories\" was raised in a widely cited theoretical paper written a quarter-century ago by two highly influential non-paleoanthropologists, Gould and Lewontin (1979) . Interestingly, the \"just so stories\" critique was also made about Darwin's work. While neuroevolutionary hypotheses of stress and fear circuitry disorders are still speculative, they are empirically falsifiable in numerous ways as proposed in this article. It should be noted that Gould and Lewontin (1979) write with a dualistic Cartesian mind-body dichotomy probably because their expertise is in insect and dinosaur evolution where gene-culture co-evolution does not occur. For complete lucid rebuttals of Gould and Lewontin's \"just so stories\" critique, see reviews by Wakefield (1992) , Buss et al. (1998) and Tooby and Cosmides (1990b) and recent syntheses of the newer research by Dawkins (2004) . Finally, a statistical language to express causation has yet to emerge (Pearl, 2000) , and research into etiological factors in psychiatric disorders traditionally begun as a \"just so story.\" The author is in full agreement with Gould and Lewontin (1979) that, at present, an unknown percentage of differences which appear on the surface to be evolved behavioral traits (including some of the hypotheses presented in this article) will be found to be evolutionary design compromises or reflect random genetic drift. However, hidden among the brain expressed genomic differences are at least a significant percentage of functionally relevent DNA (most likely in Introns) that underlie the brainexpressed phenotypic differences between clinically symptomatic and non-clinically symptomatic humans. Gould and Lewontin's other claim that \"behaviors do not leave fossils\" may also be challenged by a wide range of emerging techniques, such as the study of fear-circuitry-related infradian fluctuations (e.g., of NE Beta-receptor activity, or vagal nucleus ambiguus firing) as reflected in human mineralized tissue (Bracha et al., 2004b; Takeda et al., 2002; Larsen, 1999) . More importantly, the \"behaviors do not leave fossils\" claim also is not supported by molecular-phylogenetic studies of human lineages via chromosome-Y and mitochondrial DNA (Underhill et al., 2001; Seielstad et al., 1998) . Finally, if we fully adhere to Gould and Lewontin's forensic criteria of level of evidence, Darwin's 19th century theory of common ancestry for the Homo and Pan lineages was a \"just so story,\" only proven as fact on September 1, 2005 with the publication of the paper Initial Sequence of the Chimpanzee Genome and Comparison with the Human Genome completed by the Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium (CSAC, 2005) .",

This non-reductionistic clinically oriented approach emphasizes the importance of clinically treating those behavioral traits that evolved for Cenozoic, Paleolithic, or Neolithic environments, and which have outlived their usefulness in extant human adults. While evolutionary factors of anxiety traits are the sole focus of this article, the \"frontal release phenomena\" heuristic of clinical neuropsychiatry deserves mention since it may be helpful for a constructive fusion of distal (evolutionary) neurobiology with \"clinical proximal neurobiology.\" Kent et al. (2005) emphasize the importance of \"appropriate top-down governance by frontal cortical regions over a hypersensitive amygdala-centered fear neurocircuitry.\" The frontal release phenomena heuristic may help explain why some archaic fears are inversely correlated with age, between childhood and early adulthood, as the topdown governance of the frontal cortex over the amygdala increases. Additionally, the frontal release-sign heuristic may similarly explain why there is a positive correlation between late-life frontal lobe dysfunction (e.g., Alzheimer's disease) and the resurfacing of fears that evolved for earlier segments of the human EEA, and which may have outlived their usefulness in extant H. sapien adults.",

            "text": "Objections to evolutionary reconceptualizations for DSM-V are to be expected Some initial ideology driven objections to any mention of evolutionary etiological factors in DSM-V are to be expected. First and foremost, for the severest psychiatric illnesses, neuroevolutionary perspectives are clinically unhelpful (schizophrenia is the best example). In contrast, it is axiomatic that a mild degree of fear is helpful and that one can have \"too much of a good thing\" (too high a gene dosage?). Therefore, a prudent strategy in the research agenda for DSM-V may be to focus initially on evolutionary factors in fear circuitry disorders. A second objection may stem from the sometimes overlapping language between neuroevolutionary psychiatry and psychoanalytic theory which understandably makes psychiatric researchers uneasy. However, there are obvious fundamental differences between psychoanalytic theory and neuroevolutionary psychiatry. For example, psychoanalysis focused on ontogeny while neuroevolutionary psychiatry presents hominin-phylogeneticbased hypotheses and eventually may be able to focus on phylogenomics-ontogenomics interactions (a.k.a. gene-environment interactions) at the molecular level. To some degree, hominin phylogenomics can be seen as the basic science of evolutionary psychiatry. As Table 2 (above) attempts to demonstrate, phylogenomics may fit well into the spectrum of investigational methods into the etiology of fear circuitry disorders.",

At this stage, the data in support of re-clustering fear traits neuroevolutionarily or phylogenomically are still very limited and the hypotheses presented in this article are highly speculative. Epidemiological and twin studies are needed to test whether clustering fear-related traits by neuroevolutionary timedepth may be one of the useful non-phenotype-based approaches to anxiety disorders in the research agenda for the forthcoming DSM-V. As noted earlier, discussion of etiological factors in DSM-III (APA, 1980), DSM-IV (APA, 1994), DSM-IV-TR (APA, 2000) and ICD-10 (WHO, 1992) has been judiciously minimized. In contrast, the research agenda for the forthcoming DSM-V has specifically highlighted the need for a more etiologically based classification (Kupfer et al., 2002; Charney et al., 2002) . Furthermore, as several authorities have noted (Kupfer et al., 2002) , examination of the usefulness of adding an Axis VI reflecting evolutionary factors can be a part of the research agenda for the forthcoming DSM-V. Early theorists such as Bowlby (1975) and MacLean (1985) unfortunately focused on human-species-typical (and thus non-clinical), \"basic\" fear circuits which are phenotypically expressed almost exclusively in undermyelinated humans (infants and toddlers). These are the circuits that MacLean labeled \"paleo-mammalian,\" and which in this article are termed Mesozoic. In contrast, the neuroevolutionary synthesis and reclustering of fear-circuitry-related traits proposed here attempt to go beyond Bowlby's (1975) and MacLean's (1985) writings by focusing exclusively on fear circuits which are speciesspecific in humans (and much more importantly humanspecies-atypical, and thus clinically relevant) as well as phenotypically expressed in adult clinical populations. Over 30 empirically falsifiable predictions relevant to the DSM-V research agenda on fear circuitry disorders are presented. In addition to discussing fears which are primarily innate, the author presents a dozen evolution-based testable predictions relevant to research on overconsolidational fears, especially warzone-related PTSD. Finally, to the best of the author's knowledge, the Neuroevolutionary Time-depth Principle (Neuroevolutionary-TDP) introduced in this review is the first to tackle the question of why extant humans are consistently found to have a much higher resilience following exposure to natural disasters than following personal engagement in lethal fighting (combat), being personally present when conspecifics engage in lethal fighting (warzone exposure) or being personally present during intentionally caused disasters such as terrorism.",
