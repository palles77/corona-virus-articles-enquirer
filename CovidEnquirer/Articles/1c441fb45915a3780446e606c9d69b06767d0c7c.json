proteins can interact with this chaperone to obtain the conformation that is required for exit from the ER into the Golgi apparatus[ Thus\\ an unusual glucosyltransferase that is localized in the ER functions to transfer a glucose from UDP!glucose to high mannose chains on denatured\\ but not on native\\ glycoproteins[ 050 Once this glucose has been added\\ calnexin can recognize and assist this protein in its proper folding and transfer to the Golgi[ 051 As a result\\ a glycoprotein that has had all of its three glucose residues removed by glucosidase I and II but has failed to fold into the proper conformation can be reglucosylated by this novel enzyme\\ and this signal then allows the protein another opportunity to interact with calnexin and fold properly[ This mechanism\\ involving the removal of glucoses by the glucosidases and reglucosylation by the glucosyltransferase\\ is postulated to be part of a unique {{glycoprotein!speci_c folding and quality control mechanism|| in the ER that allows this organelle to control and pass properly folded glycoproteins on to the next step in transport and processing[ Glucosidase II has a fairly high pH optimum of about 5[4 to 6[9\\ but also hydrolyzes p!nitrophenyl!
