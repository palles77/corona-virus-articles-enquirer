This Letter describes SAR of the tertiary carbinamine derived inhibitors of BACE1 revealed during the optimization of the unstable lead toward potent and stable heterocycle linked compounds. The incorporation of a flap interaction with the target enzyme was not critical for potency. A trend observed during this optimization was that the pK a of the amine derived aspartate ligand needed to be at least close to that of the assay medium for BACE1 inhibition.",

Jeffrey Conn, Craig W. Lindsley* This Letter describes a chemical lead optimization campaign directed around VU0119498, a pan G q mAChR M 1 , M 3 , M 5 PAM, which previously afforded the first selective M 5 PAM. An iterative library synthesis approach delivered a novel chemotype with selective M 1 PAM activity (no activity at M 2 -M 5 @ 30 lM), and comparable M 1 potency (EC 50 = 830 nM) to the prototypical M 1 PAM, BQCA. The syntheses and SAR of new series of b-amyloid binding agents are reported. The effort to optimize signal-to-background ratios for these ligands are described. Compounds 8, 21 and 30 displayed desirable lipophilicity and pharmacokinetic properties. Compounds 8 and 21 were evaluated with in vitro autoradiographic studies and in vivo in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. It is shown that it was possible to increase the signal-to-background ratios compared to PIB 1, as demonstrated by compounds 8 and 21.
