Marked elevation of liver enzyme activity was present and ultrasound examination was suggestive of cholecystitis and hepatitis. Neutrophilic cholangitis was confirmed on histopathology of liver biopsies. Bile culture identified a monomicrobial infection with Providencia rettgeri, which was resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents. The cat was treated with oral pradofloxacin for 4 weeks and remained well 4 months later.",

Enteric pathogens have been implicated in the pathogenesis of disease in both cats and people, [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] and recent literature in humans suggests high rates of antimicrobial resistance. [6] [7] [8] [9] Providencia rettgeri is an unusual pathogen in humans, mostly associated with urinary tract infections, [10] [11] [12] and has been reported as the cause of a urinary tract infection in a dog. 13 Other Providencia species have been reported in association with diarrhoea and skin disease in dogs. 14, 15 To our knowledge, this is the first report of a Providencia species causing clinical disease in a cat. A 15- year-old male neutered domestic shorthair cat was presented after a generalised seizure was observed at home. A second seizure was observed after admission to hospital. Occasional vomiting and soft faecal consistency had been present over the previous week. The cat had indoor and outdoor access, and was fed a commercial, complete and balanced cat food.",

Endoscopic ileal biopsies were attempted but were unsuccessful. Prednisolone (Pred-X) was initiated (1.5 mg/kg PO q12h) with an improved appetite and a mild increase in weight noted, although the cat's body condition score remained suboptimal at 3/9.",

Differential diagnoses for the seizures included hypertensive encephalopathy, an ischaemic or haemorrhagic infarct, structural intracranial disease and metabolic causes. The retinal detachment was presumed to be secondary to hypertension at this stage, with IRIS stage 1 chronic kidney disease suspected. 16 This was based on inadequately concentrated urine and failure to identify other metabolic causes of hypertension such as diabetes mellitus or hyperthyroidism.

Current literature suggests an association with inflammatory bowel disease and pancreatitis, 3 but it is not yet clear if there is a causative role between these conditions or the association represents concurrent disease in this population. An association with nephritis was also identified by Callahan-Clark et al, 2 but the clinical significance of this association is not yet known. Clinical signs of neutrophilic cholangitis are nonspecific and can include fever and lethargy, vomiting, anorexia and weight loss. 1,20,21 Clinicopathological abnormalities are variable, but most cats have some degree of elevations in liver enzyme activity and bilirubin. 1,2,21 Variable sensitivity is reported for aspartate transaminase and ALT, but these enzymes appear the most sensitive in the identification of neutrophilic cholangitis, 1,2,21 and there was a marked increase in ALT activity in the current case.",

Bile culture is recommended to identify a causative agent and yields higher positive culture rates than culture of hepatic tissue (36% vs 16%). 4 The same study reported an increase in positive bile cultures to 64% when cholecystitis was present. 4 Causative organisms are usually enteric opportunistic pathogens. 1, 4, 22, 23 The variable antimicrobial sensitivity of this group of organisms highlights the need for culture and sensitivity information.

While the polymicrobial nature of infection in many patients was a factor, 29% of patients had multidrug resistant bacteria isolated. In the same study, metronidazole was not found to be effective in 18/19 cases where it was commenced and, as a result, was not recommended as a first-line therapy. This may also have implications in veterinary medicine where metronidazole is commonly a first-line therapy for anaerobic infection, and where the success in culturing anaerobes may be affected by transport or processing delays where a remote laboratory is used.",
