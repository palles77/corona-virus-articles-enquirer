            "text": "The mechanism of oxidative decarboxylation of phenylsulfinylacetic acids (PSAA) by oxo(salen)Cr(V) + ion in the presence of ligand oxides has been studied spectrophotometrically in acetonitrile medium. Addition of ligand oxides (LO) causes a red shift in the k max values of oxo(salen) complexes and an increase in absorbance with the concentration of LO along with a clear isobestic point. The reaction shows first-order dependence on oxo(salen)-chromium(V) + ion and fractional-order dependence on PSAA and ligand oxide. Michaelis-Menten kinetics without kinetic saturation was observed for the reaction. The order of reactivity among the ligand oxides is picoline N-oxide > pyridine N-oxide > triphenylphosphine oxide. The low catalytic activity of TPPO was rationalized. Both electron-withdrawing and electrondonating substituents in the phenyl ring of PSAA facilitate the reaction rate. The Hammett plots are non-linear upward type with negative q value for electron-donating substituents, (q \u00c0 = \u00c00.740 to \u00c04.10) and positive q value for electron-withdrawing substituents (q + = +0.057 to +0.886). Non-linear Hammett plot is explained by two possible mechanistic scenarios, electrophilic and nucleophilic attack of oxo(salen)chromium(V) + -LO adduct on PSAA as the substituent in PSAA is changed from electrondonating to electron-withdrawing. The linearity in the log k vs. E ox plot confirms single-electron transfer (SET) mechanism for PSAAs with electron-donating substituents.",

Because of the easy preparation, reasonable stabilities, biological activities etc., salen ligand [salen = 1,6-bis(2-hydroxyphenyl)-2,5-diazahexa-1,5-diene], its derivatives and their associated metal complexes are widely used as potential catalysts in oxo transfer reactions [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] and many other processes [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . They also mimic enzymatic reactions [12, 13] . Further, the applications of N-oxide derivatives have received considerable attention due to their usefulness as synthetic intermediates and biological importance. Pyridine N-oxide derivatives represent a new class of anti-HIV compounds and oxide part of the pyridine moiety proved to be indispensable for anti-coronavirus activity. The potential and virus specificity of the pyridine N-oxides were shown to vary depending on the nature and location of the substituents in the molecule [14] . Heterocyclic N-oxides are used as protecting groups, auxiliary agents, oxidants, ligands in metal complexes and catalysts [15] besides bio-reductive drugs [16] . Hence the study of the role and action of N-oxides on the activity of metallo-enzymes are of biological importance.",

Although, a large number of reports on the reactivity of oxo metal complexes with nitrogen bases as additives [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] have appeared in the literature only little interest has been paid by using ligand oxides as additives in these reactions. Even in majority of cases where ligand oxides are used as additive, no effect is observed in epoxidation [28] and sulfoxidation reactions [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . Further, there was no detailed mechanistic study on the oxidation of phenylsulfinylacetic acid (PSAA) except our recent publications on the proximal effects of nitrogen bases with oxo(salen)Cr(V) + ion [34] and Cr(VI) oxidation of PSAA [35] mediated by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide [36] , oxalic acid [37] and picolinic acid [38] , though PSAA is a versatile synthetic agent used for the synthesis of antibiotics [39] and various organic compounds [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] . Out of our much interest on the oxidation studies of sulfur compounds especially with PSAA in the presence of additives and a significant effect observed with ligand oxides, detailed kinetic investigation on the reactions between PSAAs and oxo(salen)chromium(V) complexes in the presence of triphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO), pyridine N-oxide (PyO) and picoline N-oxide (PicNO) has been carried out. The following scheme (Scheme 1) summarises the work described in this paper.",

The concentration of oxo(salen)Cr(V) + ion was maintained at 5 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 M unless or otherwise specified and the concentration of substrate, PSAA was maintained in the range of 0.05 M to 0.4 M.

The observed trend of constant k 1 with varying [oxo(salen)Cr(V) + ] is contradictory with that observed for the reactions in the absence of ligand oxides and in the presence of nitrogen bases [34] where decrease in k 1 with concentration is noted. This indicates that oxo(salen) dimer formation is prevented by ligand oxides. From the Supporting information Table S1 it is inferred that the rate of the reaction is influenced by the nature of the substituents in the salen ligand. Electron-withdrawing chloro substituent in 5,5 0 -positions of oxo(salen) complex increases the rate constant of the reaction while electron-releasing methyl substituent in the 5,5 0 -positions slightly reduces the reaction rate except with TPPO (where rate acceleration is observed) when compared to that of the unsubstituted oxo(salen) complex.

The overall rate constants calculated for the reactions in the presence of ligand oxides are tabulated in Table 3 . The kinetic data in the table indicate that the reactions in the presence of ligand oxides are highly sensitive to the nature of the substituents in the aryl moiety of PSAA and in the phenolic part of the salen ligand. Both electron-withdrawing and electrondonating substituents in the phenyl ring of PSAA increase the rate of the reaction. In order to confirm the extent of charge separation in the transition state, the rate constant values were analyzed in terms of Hammett r values. V-shaped Hammett plots with a minimum for unsubstituted PSAA are seen with all ligand oxides and oxo(salen) complexes. The Hammett plots are found to have positive q value for electron-withdrawing substituents (q + = 0.057 to 0.886) and negative q value for electron-releasing substituents (q \u00c0 = \u00c00.740 to \u00c04.10). The representative Hammett plots are shown in Fig. 4 . Regarding the substituent effect in salen complex, the electron-withdrawing chloro substituent in the 5,5 0 positions of the salen ligand (Ic) enhances the rate enormously while the electron-donating methyl substituent (Ib) decreases the rate which is slightly lower than the unsubstituted oxo(salen) complex (Ia).

Strong binding of LOs with the complex during adduct formation is confirmed from the larger binding constant values (Table 2 ) and smaller Michaelis-Menten constants observed with LOs (Table S3 ). In many salen mediated oxidation reactions, the LO-salen adduct formed during the course of the reaction has been proposed as the active oxidizing species and it is proved to be a more powerful oxidant than the salen complex itself. The catalytic activity shown by the added ligand oxides is 2-70 times (Table S4 ) greater than that in its absence. This confirms the involvement of oxo(salen)Cr(V) + -LO adduct as the active reactive species in the present reaction series also. Ligand oxides are reported to co-ordinate with the Cr centre through the oxygen atom in the apical centre to complete the octahedral co-ordination which weakens the Cr@O bond, increasing the bond length by donating electron density into the Cr@O anti bonding orbital [53, 54] . The rate enhancement observed in the presence of N-oxides is in line with the increase in rate observed in the sulfoxidation [55, 56] and epoxidation reactions by oxo (salen)Cr(V) + [57] [58] [59] [60] and oxo(salen)Mn(V) [61] complexes.

            "text": "From the kinetic data in Tables 3, S1 and S2 it is shown that the reactivity is more pronounced in the presence of added PyO and PicNO while it is not so with added TPPO. This is a striking contrast to the order of catalysis observed with LOs in the oxygenation of organic sulfides and sulfoxides by oxo(salen)Cr(V) + ion [55, 56] where highest reactivity is observed with TPPO. The low binding constant values and least reactivity observed with TPPO among the LOs in this reaction series may be attributed not only to the steric hindrance created by TPPO during the binding with chromium centre [70] but also due to decrease in electron density on the oxygen atom of TPPO as a result of the presence of three electron-withdrawing phenyl groups. These effects decelerate the formation of oxo(salen)-TPPO reactive adduct species. Earlier studies [28, 45] revealed that TPPO adduct with oxo(salen)Cr(V) + ions are less stable than PyO adduct. In the computational assessment of donor ligand effect on the product distribution in the manganese (salen) catalyzed epoxidation of olefins, Jacobsen et al. [71] have shown that PyO forms a stronger bond with the transition metal centre than TPPO. Gilheany et al. [17] reported that bulky ligands are less effective donor ligands and their rate of donor ligation is lower than expected. The binding constant values in Table 2 reveal that the PyO forms stronger adduct with oxo(salen)Cr(V) + ions. The unusual high binding constants of PyO has been attributed to the dual nature of the N-oxide group which acts both as an electrondonor and an electron-acceptor [72, 73] .",

From the fractional-order dependence on PSAA and the observed high Michaelis-Menten constants, it is assumed that in the second step of the mechanism PSAA binds in a weak manner with C 1 to form a ternary complex (C 2 /C 3 ) in a reversible step. The spectral evidence for the formation of C 2 /C 3 is the change in the absorbance and k max value (Table 1) of the oxo(salen) complex-LO adduct by the addition of PSAA. From the density functional theory (DFT) it was calculated that the co-ordination of donor ligands with oxo(salen)Cr(V) + ions lowers the energy of activation [12, 13] during the addition of alkene to oxo (salen)Cr(V) + which explains the increase in rate noted in the epoxidation reactions with donor ligand as additive.",

The metal centre, which is positioned above the plane of the four basal hetero atoms in oxo salen [45] , moves into the plane and the salen ligand is slightly distorted towards a step like transoid conformation when donor ligand is coordinated [74] which favors the attack of a substrate. Bahraoui et al. [75] have shown experimentally that axial coordination of N-oxide ligand to the oxo(salen)-manganese (V) complex raises the catalytic activity and the oxygen transfer dramatically. Thus it is proposed that one of the reasons for the observed significant rate acceleration in the presence of ligand oxides is the favorable condition for the binding of PSAA with oxo oxygen of the salen moiety.",

Because of the competition between the rate of complex formation by electron-releasing groups and its rate of decomposition by electron-withdrawing groups, V-shaped Hammett plots are seen in the oxidation of benzaldehydes by quinolinium chlorochromate [76] . V-shaped Hammett plots observed in manganese(V) oxo (corrolazine) [77] and manganese V (imido)(corrole) [82] complexes were rationalized based upon a change in mechanism that hinges the complexes to function as either an electrophile or nucleophile.

The observed negative reaction constant (q \u00c0 ) indicates the accumulation of positive charge at the sulfur centre while the magnitude of q \u00c0 indicates the extent of charge development on the sulfur centre in the transition state. The appreciably high q \u00c0 values obtained indicate that electron-releasing substituents in PSAA create more positive charge on the sulfur atom and thus increase the nucleophilicity of PSAA. Another reason for the high q value may be due to significant increase in electrophilic character of the ligand oxide coordinated octahedral oxo(salen)chromium (V) + adduct. Also the DFT studies on sulfoxidation by oxo(salen)Cr (V) + ions made by Venkataramanan et al. [56] indicated an increase in negative charge over chromium atom in the transition state. A negative q value was already reported for a series of sulfoxidation reactions with oxo(salen)Cr(V) + ion [55] . An interesting observation noted in the present study is that the log k ov values are linearly related with the oxidation potential of various substituted PSAAs when electron-donating groups are present, while linearity is not observed with electron-withdrawing substituents. The plots of log k ov vs. E ox are shown in Fig. 5 .",

The observed linear plots of log k ov vs. E ox along with negative q value obtained in the Hammett correlation for electron-releasing substituents give direct evidence for the electrophilic attack of the oxo complex on PSAA involving single-electron transfer from the sulfur atom to the oxidant species. This step involves the formation of sulfur cation radical and this would be the slow rate determining step. Such type of sulfur cation radical formation in a rate determining step is firmly established in literature. Sulfur cation radical then undergoes several fast steps including oxygen transfer (OT) from the oxo function of the complex to PSAA and decarboxylation from PSAA moiety by a, b-cleavage leading to the formation of the products, methyl phenyl sulfone and CO 2 for PSAAs having electronreleasing groups. It is pertinent to mention here that on the basis of the observed linear correlation of log k 2 and E red , SET mechanism has been proposed for the sulfoxidation of PTAA [33] and sulfides [31, 68] by oxo(salen)Mn(V) complexes, and oxidation of anilines by oxo(salen)Cr(V) + [47] and oxo(salen)iron(IV) [23] complexes.",

In such cases, the hexa coordinated oxo(salen)-LO adducts which behave as electrophiles with PSAAs containing electron-donating substituents now act as nucleophiles and facilitate the formation of intermediate C 3 in a slow reversible rate determining step which then undergoes decarboxylation and decomposition to give [(salen)Cr(III)-LO] + , CO 2 and sulfone as the products in a fast step. Such type of sulfonium ion formation between oxo(salen)Cr(V) + ion and sulfur compounds in a slow step has been advocated earlier in many sulfoxidation reactions of sulfides and sulfoxides [55, 56, 87] .",
