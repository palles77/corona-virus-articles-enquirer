These emergency incidents are affecting many people and causing MCIs. This can disrupt the health sector programs and essential services in the community. 2 Many lives could be saved if the affected communities were better prepared, with an organized scalable response system and emergency plans. Riyadh is not an exception and might be vulnerable to different types of MCIs. Riyadh is the capital of Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and also its largest city with over 7 million populations that accounts for more than 22% of the population of the whole country. There are 11 governmental hospitals with more than 100 beds capacity in Riyadh. It is considered a strategic and economic requirement to make our hospitals and health facilities, including the private sector, prepared to emergency situations. 3 In Saudi Arabia most hospitals in Jeddah faced a critical situation in 2009 due to floods. This raised many questions in the Ministry of Health (MOH) and higher authorities about the preparedness of hospitals not in Jeddah area only, but also in the entire Kingdom. The role and importance of hospitals during disasters is essential to save as many lives as possible. 4 Emergency preparedness in the hospitals is a key success factor for any effective emergency and MCI management practices. In fact, hospitals play a significant role in health care infrastructure in a community. 5 Recently, Saudi Arabia has become a typical region for natural hazards (floods, storms, earthquake, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), landslides, and so forth) and/or human-made hazards (fires, explosives, structural collapse, transportation event, and so forth) that markedly could affect a large number of people. The MOH realized that making hospitals and health facilities safe from disasters is an essential strategic and economic requirement. The failure of hospitals to face disasters and MCIs and save lives cost KSA too high as compared to the cost of making hospitals safe and well prepared to face MCI. 6 The aim of this work was to investigate the hospital disaster preparedness (HDP) in 13 major Riyadh private hospitals in case of MCIs. Although there are controversies on the difference between disasters and MCI, the present study focused on having many casualties as sudden casualties of trauma only in urban healthcare system. Since there are no Saudi national standards for disaster management, this study was carried out as a part of MOH supervising the private hospitals to assess the current situation. This research was carried out as part of Master of Public Health (MPH) requirements and sponsored by the MOH. This study endeavored to establish a better knowledge about the capabilities of private hospitals in Riyadh to respond to MCIs that might occur.",

This was confirmed when it was noticed that exercises and drills for the HDP were not performed in most hospitals in the last year and may be ever. Hospitals need a well-documented and tested plan in order to respond effectively and efficiently to disasters. A disaster plan is not an aim by itself and having one does not mean that the hospital is prepared when MCI occurs. 9, 10 The results of the present work showed that most of the plans in the studied hospitals were set its disaster risk profile of the hospital and objective in relation to motor vehicle accidents and floods and is not adequately cover the \"all hazards\" process and \"whole health\" approach as recommended by the WHO. 11 The HDP might need to be reconstructed and reviewed in order to include response to internal disasters such as fire, collapse of hospital, flooding and external disasters such as terrorist attack, storms, earthquake, landslides, explosives, structural collapse, transportation event and so forth). 12 According to Adini et al 13 the national healthcare systems in a country were required to prepare an effective response model to manage emergencies due to MCIs. Planning for disaster preparedness should be envisioned as a process rather than a production of a solid plan. To guarantee proper emergency preparedness necessitates a structured methodology to put EDP. This plan will enable an objective assessment of the level of readiness to respond during MCIs.",

However, they admitted of the possibility of man-made catastrophe, or terrorism attack as a cause of MCIs. One of the raised worry of the private hospitals' administrations was the cost and bills for management of victims from MCIs. They proposed that there should be a clear written agreement, or memorandum between MOH and private hospitals on the hospital bills for patients received during MCIs. Such agreement will protect the patients send to private hospitals during disasters from facing huge hospital bills and high fees in the private sector and will also keep the 6 Abosuliman et al 15 reported that the disaster preparedness in Saudi Arabia is a key success factor for any effective disaster management practices. The authors stressed on the top 5 areas for future attention: training of response teams, identification and coordination of the organizational responsibilities, community awareness, and preparedness. Their results showed that the disaster mitigation was found to be very important for the representatives of public authorities. They found that the population acknowledged the risk of natural and human-initiated disasters, and were generally responsive to disaster threats, but lacked communitybased organization. They concluded that continually training disaster responders with best practices and preparedness is paramount to successful disaster crisis prevention and management.",
