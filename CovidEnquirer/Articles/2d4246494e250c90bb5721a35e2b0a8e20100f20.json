These viral species all can cause liver inflammation (hepatitis), but share no gene similarity. The codon usage of human hepatitis A virus (HAV) is suboptimal for replication in its host, a characteristic it shares with taxonomically related rodent, simian, and bat hepatitis A virus species. We found this codon usage to be strikingly similar to that of Triatoma virus that infects blood-sucking kissing bugs. The codon usage of that virus is well adapted to its insect host. The codon usage of HAV is also similar to other invertebrate viruses of various taxonomic families. An evolutionary ancestor of HAV and related virus species is hypothesized to be an insect virus that underwent a host jump to infect mammals. The similarity between HAV and invertebrate viruses goes beyond codon usage, as they also share amino acid composition characteristics, while not sharing direct sequence homology. In contrast, hepatitis C virus and hepatitis E virus are highly similar in codon usage preference, nucleotide composition, and amino acid composition, and share these characteristics with Human pegivirus A, West Nile virus, and Zika virus. We present evidence that these observations are only partly explained by differences in nucleotide composition of the complete viral codon regions.",

In lack of the cap assembly that is common in other RNA virus species, translation of HAV is initiated by a secondary structure formed by the 5\u2032-untranscribed region of the RNA genome, which functions as a ribosome entry site (McKnight & Lemon, 2018; Vaughan et al., 2014) . Of note is that the codon use of HAV is quite distinct from that of its host, a property that is also reflected by its low GC content (37%); as a consequence, this virus is slow to replicate in human cells. The virus is transmitted via the fecal-oral route, and the relative high stability of unenveloped virus particles in the environment enables transmission via fecally contaminated food and water. Yearly, approximately 1.5 million clinical cases of HAV occur globally, although at least ten times as many new undocumented infections may occur, as suggested by serological evidence (reviewed in Vaughan et al., 2014 ). The infection is mostly self-limiting and results in lifelong immunity.",

For HAV, three genotypes that infect humans (I, II and II, each with subtypes A and B) are recognized, and these belong to a single serotype. Three more genotypes are specific to the simian host (Costa-Mattioli et al., 2003) , while a previously described genotype VII is reclassified as IIB. A substitution rate of 9.76 \u00d7 10 -4 substitutions per site per year (ssy) was calculated, based on complete VP1 sequences from French genotype IA isolates (Moratorio et al., 2007) , but this may be an overestimate, as an analysis of complete genome sequences from multiple countries produced an estimate of 1.00 \u00d7 10 -4 ssy (Kulkarni, Walimbe, Cherian, & Arankalle, 2009 ). Thus, the range is likely to be around one in ten thousand substitutions per site per year, or roughly one or two substitutions per viral genome per year. This reflects the slow evolutionary rate of this virus. A last common ancestor of human HAV and the simian genotypes was estimated to have existed between 1,250 and 3,500 years ago (Kulkarni et al., 2009 ).",

Separate phylogenetic trees were produced for the three viral species, with 134 HAV genomes, 2,542 HCV genomes, and 557 HEV genomes, as shown in Figure 1 . All trees were drawn to scale, to illustrate the much lower genomic diversity of HAV compared with the other two species. The trees for HCV and HEV were collapsed at 90% identity for graphical representation. The HAV branches remained un-collapsed, since the shown branches per genotype all have a similarity >90%. The genomic diversity of HEV is higher than that of HAV but lower than that of HCV, as illustrated by the branch lengths of the trees. The produced HAV tree is in good agreement with previously published data (Vaughan et al., 2014) , although we did not include simian serotypes IV to VI. Our HCV tree that was based on 2,542 genomes is also mostly in agreement with previous publications that used smaller datasets. A neighbor joining (NJ) tree based on 162 genome sequences (Jackowiak et al., 2014) already identified a relationship between genotype 1 (Gt1) and Gt4, which is also visible in Figure 1 ; these two genotypes have evolved later than the other genotypes (Preciado et al., 2014) . The relationship between Gt2 and Gt7 was also noted before. However, our data produced a better resolution of genotypes than the NJ tree published by Jackowiak and colleagues. An ML tree based on 129 genome sequences (Smith et al., 2014) also did not fully resolve the branch of Gt1 and Gt4 with respect to the other genotypes. It is unclear on what data the tree shown in a review article (Preciado et al., 2014) was based, in which Gt1 and Gt4 were separated. In our tree, the branch leading to Gt1 and Gt4 is placed between Gt3 and Gt6/Gt8. Upon closer investigation of HCV genomes for which a subtype was specified in their Genbank annotation, only a few annotations did not match the current nomenclature, all of which were given a genotype before standardization of the nomenclature (Tokita et al., 1996) . This illustrates that historical Genbank annotations must be interpreted with caution. The six genotypes of HEV are also well resolved in Figure 1 , but the subtypes within these genotypes are not.",

Costafreda and coworkers have shown that selection for deoptimized HAV codons was related to transcription efficiency, antigenicity of capsid protein, plaque size, and survival rates of virions (Costafreda et al., 2014) . However, it is hard to envisage how this situation might have evolved when an ancestor of HAV had a codon usage that was better adapted to the mammalian host. In general, the direction of virus evolution would be toward more efficient, not toward less efficient translation and replication in a given host, as it would result in more (or more rapid) virion production. Moreover, if the selective pressure would mostly apply to optimal folding of the capsid protein, only that coding region of the genome would depend on using deoptimized codons, but the virus proteome is consistently using codons that human cells do not prefer, over its complete ORF length This is shown in Appendix Figure A2 . We consider the most likely explanation for the current codon usage of HAV that it is a remnant of an ancestor virus that replicated in a host with a codon usage preference different to that of humans.",

That ancestor might have been an insect virus that underwent a host jump to bats, after it was passed on to rodents and eventually simians and humans. The jump from insect to bat may have occurred in the blood (in case a blood-sucking insect was the source) or in the gut of insectivorous bats. A candidate for this putative common ancestor has not been identified, as no invertebrate virus is yet described with sequence similarity to HAV, but its existence can be hypothesized. In contrast, HEV and HCV seem to have a common ancestor not related to that of HAV and form a different group of (human) ssRNA ( ",

We consider it possible that a blood-sucking insect such as triatomes, which feeds on mammals, may have been the source for a virus crossing host species. Alternatively, a host jump may have taken place in the gut of insectivorous bats. More speculative is the possibility that in a long evolutionary past all these virus species may have originated from bacteriophages that propagated in Gram-negative AT-rich bacteria, with which they still share codon preference and amino acid frequency.
