In their review article, the authors briefly summarize the significance of the antibody-dependent enhancement of infection in different viral diseases and discuss role of these types of antibodies as the obstacles for vaccine development. Findings which indicate that complement-mediated antibody-dependent enhancement (C-ADE) is present also in HIV-infected patients, are summarized. Previous results of the authors, suggesting that C-ADE plays a very important role in the progression of HIV infection are described. Data reflecting that enhancing antibodies may develop even in vaccinated animals and human volunteers, and may be responsible for the paradoxical results obtained in some subgroups of vaccinees are discussed. Finally, based on their hypothesis, the authors offer some suggestions for the future development of vaccines.",

Both phase III trials of gp120 vaccines [1, 2] aiming to raise sterilizing, antibody-mediated immu-nity, failed in 2003. There was no difference in the frequency of the breakthrough infection between the vaccine and placebo arms. A further trial of an other type of vaccine (V520 of Merck), using a different strategy, was prematurely stopped in September 2007 [3] . The Merck vaccine relies exclusively on the stimulation of cellular immune response. Although, it is well known that antibodies are important to prevent infections and eventually all successful vaccines raise antibody-mediated protection, T-cell vaccines are hoped to control the level of HIV in the body of vaccinees for a long time and thereby prevent progression to AIDS [4] . Unfortunately, this was not the case in any of the trials finished until now. Not only the vaccines did not provide any protection against HIV-1 infection, but also there was no difference between the vaccine and placebo arms as regards the progression of HIV disease in breakthrough infection [3, 5, 6] .",

That is, instead of containing or eliminating the virus, these antibodies facilitate its production in the body of infected persons. These enhancing antibodies counteract the effect of the neutralizing antibodies and the relative powers of the ''good guys'' versus ''bad guys'', that is, the balance between enhancing and neutralizing antibodies, are decisive for the progression of HIV disease. Further, we assume that all types of HIV vaccines may raise enhancing antibodies as well, and these antibodies can reduce the efficacy of the vaccines. At least in HIV infection, enhancing antibodies mostly exert their effect through activation of the complement system. Therefore, the balance of enhancing/neutralizing antibodies can be correctly measured only in the presence of fresh HIV seronegative human serum containing human complement.",

In certain instances, however, the presence of specific antibodies can be beneficial to the virus. This paradoxical process is known as the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral infection. In ADE, virus-specific antibodies enhance the entry of the virus into, and in some cases, its replication within T cells, monocytes/macrophages and granulocytic cells, through interactions with Fc and/or complement receptors. A significant, 4 log-fold or even greater increase in the in vitro production of several viruses was observed following exposure to low-affinity antibodies [7] . ADE of infection has been described for numerous viruses belonging to different families and orders as reviewed [8, 9] . Common properties of these viruses include (a) replication (partially or exclusively) in macrophages; (b) induction of the abundant production of antibodies that poorly neutralize even the homologous virus; and (c) they cause persistent infection commonly characterized by prolonged viremia.",

Accordingly, it was found that DV produced more severe clinical manifestations in older individuals with subneutralizing levels of antibodies (induced by previous DV infections), than in individuals who had never been exposed to the virus [12] .

Recently, ADE was implicated in the pathogenesis of atypical morbilli virus infection observed after immunization with formalininactivated vaccine [23] , and was suggested as a concern in developing a vaccine for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) as well [24] .",

Their presence in the blood of HIV-infected patients, as well as in HIV-or SIV-infected experimental animals was confirmed by several groups. Two types of enhancing antibodies were described approximately at the same time, in the late eighties. Robinson et al. [25] found that sera from HIV-infected individuals enhance in vitro HIV infection of the CR2 (complement receptor type 2)-bearing T lymphoblastoid cell line MT2. The same authors demonstrated this enhancement to be dependent on antibodies and mediated by complement, and coined its name 'complement-mediated antibody-dependent enhancement (C-ADE)' [26] . Gras and Dormont [27] could reproduce the same phenomenon in peripheral blood lymphocytes. According to further studies [28] , C-ADE of HIV-1 infection is characterized by increased synthesis of protein and RNA, as well as enhanced release of infective viruses.",

As summarized recently by Robinson [38] , binding of the antibody to gp41 initiates the complement cascade, leading to deposition of the complement component C3d,g on the virion. Opsonized virions subsequently bind to complement receptor type 2 (CD21). Ultimately, the engagement of CD21 and CD4 receptors by opsonized virions leads to an increased rate of HIV spread through the tissue culture and to a ten-fold increase in the release of reverse transcriptase (RT) into the culture medium, as well as to an increase of the level of HIV genomic RNA. Most importantly, C-ADE leads to an almost 100-fold increase in the number of the infective progeny virus synthesized, compared with infections by HIV-1 alone. C-ADE of HIV-1 infection requires CD4, but the binding of C1q to C1q-R of virions may also increase C-ADE [39] . According to recent studies by Robinson [38] , the CXCR4 coreceptor is also required -in addition to CD4 and complement receptors -for enhanced entry of HIV into MT2 cells.",

We used a method described first in [44] in all of our studies to measure C-ADE. Briefly, serum samples from patients were heat-treated (56 \u2022 C, 30 min) and diluted at 1:64 with culture medium. Test serum dilutions were mixed with identical volumes of fresh pooled sera from HIV-seronegative healthy persons; HIV-1 IIIB (100 TCID 50 ) was added and incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 1 h. Then, the mixture was added to and incubated together with 5 \u00d7 10 5 MT-4 cells without a change for 4 days at 37 \u2022 C. Growth of HIV in the cultures was monitored on days 3 and 4 with reverse transcriptase (RT) assay. The results were measured as count per minute, and expressed finally as an index (enhancement/neutralization index = E/N I) value. This E/N index is a ratio between virus growth in the presence and in the absence of test serum. Samples with an E/N I below 0.5 (i.e. two-fold decrease in virus production) were considered neutralizing, whereas samples with an E/N I over 2.0 (i.e. two-fold increase in virus production) were considered enhancing. The method has two major benefits: (1) it uses almost physiological complement concentration (25% in the infecting mixture) and (2) virus production is measured by RT assay, which measures only infective viruses.",

Recent, elegant studies by Mitchell et al. [37] and Robinson [38] help to resolve this apparently paradoxical situation. According to Mitchell et al. [37] , the primary antigenic domain of gp41, responsible for the C-ADE of HIV and SIV, is a conservative sequence, which is critical for the gp41-gp120 interaction.

While a substantial proportion of the samples obtained at the beginning of HAART enhanced virus production in the presence of complement and neutralization was rare, sera obtained from 20/28 patients after 19.0 (10.5-24.0) months of HAART treatment neutralized HIV even in the presence of complement (Fig. 4) .

The comparison of cultures inoculated with mixtures of HIV and purified IgG (prepared from serum pools taken before and during HAART) also revealed markedly decreased E/NI values [47] . In sharp contrast to these findings, clinical usefulness of measuring CEAs was challenged by Montefiori's group [48, 49] . They did not find any difference in the frequency of neutralizing or enhancing antibodies (measured in the presence of complement) in patients in different stages of HIV disease. Additionally, long-term non-progressor state was similarly not associated with the lack of enhancing antibodies. The main difference between their method and our procedure was the final concentration of human complement in the mixtures added to target cells. While complement concentration was 25% in our experiments, Montefiori's group [48, 49] used a concentration of 2.5%. It seems reasonable to suppose that the closer are the experimental conditions to in vivo conditions, the higher is the pathological relevance of the measurement.",

As it was detailed above, enhancing antibodies appear earlier after HIV infection than neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, the balance of ''good'' and ''bad'' antibodies changes during the progression of HIV disease, and ''bad'', enhancing antibodies become predominant in the advanced stage. This issue was addressed by the elegant study of Subbramanian et al. [43] . These authors measured in parallel the concentrations of virus-neutralizing antibodies (NAs), NA in the presence of complement (C-NA), as well as those of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity-mediating (ADCC) antibodies and infection-enhancing antibodies in the presence or absence of complement (C-ADE versus FcR-ADE). Antibodies that may control HIV progression (NA, C-NA or ADCC) were found mainly in asymptomatic patients, whereas in AIDS stage, the balance shifted towards infection-enhancing (FcR-ADE or C-ADE) antibodies.",

Similarly, it seems plausible that, similarly to natural infections, they may abrogate the beneficial effect of neutralizing or ADCC-mediating antibodies. Certain data from the SIV-monkey model and HIV vaccine trials indicate that this may indeed occur. Antibodies to the putative SIV infection-enhancing domain diminish the beneficial effects of an SIV gp160 vaccine in Rhesus macaques [42] . Verrier et al. [50] demonstrated that in hyperimmunized Rhesus macaques, whole virus particle-based HIV-1 vaccines can play a facilitator role in the transmission of the virus and/or the evolution of the disease. In a recent passive immunization study, SIV immunoglobulin decreased plasma viremia and delayed disease progression in four monkeys out of six; however, the remaining two animals in the group had higher viral loads in their peripheral blood cells than any other of the 12 control animals, and progressed more rapidly than the controls [51] . In another, recent experiment conducted on Rhesus macaques immunized with a recombinant Varicella-Zoster Virus vaccine expressing HIV gp160, those that received the vaccine raised high amounts of nonneutralizing antibodies and manifested increased levels of SIV replication, more rapid CD4 depletion, and accelerated progression to AIDS, compared with controls. This observation indicates that candidate AIDS vaccines may not simply be either efficacious or neutral; they may also have the potential to be harmful [52] .",

            "text": "It seems highly probable that enhancing antibodies may develop in human volunteers immunized with candidate HIV vaccines. For example, complement-dependent enhancing antibodies were detected in two trials: in 11 of 19 volunteers [53] , and in 6/24 subjects [54] vaccinated with high dose (640 g) of a HIV-1 gp160 candidate vaccine. Indirect evidence indicates that enhancing type antibodies could have developed during recent phase III vaccine trials as well. Gilbert et al. [55] have recently reported on the correlation between immunological responses to the recombinant gp120 vaccine and the incidence of HIV-1 infection in a phase 3 vaccine trial. They found that vaccinees who developed low antibody responses had a slightly, but significantly higher chance of becoming infected, than placebo recipients. In Caucasian recipients, this odds ratio was as high as 2.20 (1.29-3.74; p = 0.004), and 2.00 (1.22-3.29; p = 0.006) for MN CD4 blocking and for GNE8 V2-binding antibodies, respectively. On the other hand, even the high antibody response appeared to fail to protect vaccinees against HIV-1 infection. The authors put forward two alternative explanations of their findings: (a) the vaccine induced an immune response that enhanced susceptibility to HIV-1 infection in low responders and (b) differing antibody responses to rgp120 merely identified the diverse capabilities of vaccinees to resist HIV-1 infection [55] . In the discussion of their paper, they weighed the relative plausibility of the two explanations, but could not decide. In accordance with the Editorial Comment by Graham and Mascola [56] , we would like to discuss the possibility, corroborated by the abundance of literature data summarized above, that antibody-mediated enhancement may develop and can diminish or abrogate the beneficial effects of the vaccine or can even be harmful for vaccinated volunteers. We believe that this risk should be seriously considered during the future development of vaccines.",

With this approach, it may be possible to develop preventive vaccines with strong neutralizing and weak ADE inducing characteristics. (3) Based on literature data referred to above--indicating that a neutralization assay performed in the presence of complement exhibit much stronger correlations to disease progression than the traditional test, we propose using an alternative to the traditional method for measuring neutralizing antibodies, in order to find an effective vaccine. It is reasonable to assume that measurement of the balance between neutralizing and enhancing antibodies in the presence of complement may reflect also the proportion of protective and antiprotective antibodies present in vaccinees. This method can be easily adapted to animal experiments. Therefore, it may prove useful as early as during the selection of candidate vaccines by eliminating potentially harmful vaccines.
