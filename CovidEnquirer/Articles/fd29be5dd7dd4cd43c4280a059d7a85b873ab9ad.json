It is the different types of damage caused which result in the symptoms of disease which allow diagnosis and implementation of appropriate treatment and control measures. The impact on the host of microbial damage depends very much on the tissue involved. Damage to muscle in the shoulder or stomach wall, for instance, may not be serious, but in the heart the very existence of the host depends on a strong muscle contraction continuing to occur every second or so, and here the effect of minor functional changes may be catastrophic. The central nervous system (CNS) is particularly vulnerable even to slight damage. The passage of nerve impulses requires normal function in the neuronal cell membrane, and viruses especially have important effects on cell membranes. Also a degree of cellular or tissue oedema that is tolerable in most tissues may have serious consequences if it occurs in the brain, enclosed in that more or less rigid box, the skull. Therefore, encephalitis and meningitis tend to cause more severe illness than might be expected from the histological changes themselves. Oedema is a serious matter also in the lung. Oedema fluid or inflammatory cell exudates appear first in the space between the alveolar capillary and the alveolar wall, decreasing the efficiency of gaseous exchanges. Respiratory function is more drastically impaired when fluid or cells accumulate in the alveolar air space. The effect of tissue damage is much less in the case of organs, such as the liver, pancreas or kidney, which have considerable functional reserves. More than two-thirds of the liver must be removed before there are signs of liver dysfunction.",

The resulting circulatory changes may lead to anoxia or necrosis in the tissues supplied by these vessels. Here too, the site of vascular lesions may be critical, effects on organs such as the brain or heart having a greater impact on the host, as discussed above. Rickettsiae characteristically grow in vascular endothelium and this is an important mechanism of disease production. By a combination of direct and immunopathological factors, there is endothelial swelling, thrombosis, infarcts, haemorrhage and tissue anoxia. This is especially notable in the skin and forms the basis for the striking rashes in typhus and the spotted fevers. These skin rashes, although important for the physician, are less important for the patient than similar lesions in the CNS or heart. It is damage to cerebral vessels that accounts for the cerebral disturbances in typhus; involvement of pulmonary vessels causes pneumonitis, and involvement of myocardial vessels causes myocardial oedema. For example, in Q fever, rickettsiae sometimes localise in the endocardium, and this causes serious complications.",

Sometimes it is fairly well established that an infectious agent can at least be one of the causes of the disease, but in most instances it is no more than a hypothesis, with little or no good evidence. For conditions as common and as serious as multiple sclerosis, cancer and rheumatoid arthritis, it would be of immense importance if a microorganism were incriminated, since this would give the opportunity to prevent the disease by vaccination or treat it with anti-microbials. For example, Borna disease (BD) has classically been described as a chronic, progressive meningoencephalomyelitis, causing both neurological and behavioural symptoms in horses and sheep. Experimental infection of tree shrews (Tupaia glis) with BD virus however results in very little overt disease, but afterwards the male is no longer able to enact the ritual courtship behaviour, which (as students well know) is an essential preliminary to mating in all primates. Thus it can be said that infection with BD virus renders the male psychologically sterile. Presumably the virus in some way alters the functioning of neurons concerned in this particular pathway. All other behavioural and physiological aspects appear normal. BD virus is not known to occur in man, but speculation about an analogous human situation is fuelled by the finding of BD virus-specific antibodies in patients with psychiatric/behavioural disorders. Since the aetiology of such diseases raises interesting problems in pathogenesis, the present state of affairs is summarised in Table 8 .1, which includes some of the human diseases whose infectious origin is probable, possible, conceivable or inconceivable.",

It was not too difficult to (Continued) prove and accept that the encephalitis that occasionally occurs during or immediately after measles was due to measles virus. But it was hard to accept that a very rare type of encephalitis (subacute sclerosing panencephalitis or SSPE), occurring up to 10 years after apparently complete recovery from measles, was also due to measles virus and this was only established after the eventual isolation of a mutant form of measles virus from brain cells. 'Slow' infections, in which the first signs of disease appear a long time after infection, are now an accepted part of our outlook. The disease Kuru occurred in New Guinea and was transmitted from person to person by ritual cannibalism. The incubation period in man appears to be 12\u00c015 years, and the disease was caused by an infectious proteinaceous agent known as a prion that grew in the brain. This was established when the same disease appeared in monkeys several years after the injection of material from the brain of Kuru patients. A similar agent termed the scrapie agent infects sheep, cattle, mice and other animals and also has an incubation period representing a large portion of the lifespan of the host. In both Kuru and SSPE, the agent was eventually shown to be present in the brains of patients. If in a slow infection, the microorganism that initiated the pathological process is no longer present by the time the disease becomes manifest, then the problem of establishing a causal relationship will be much greater. This may possibly turn out to be true for diseases like multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Liver cancer in humans and certain leukaemias in mice, cats, humans and cattle can be caused by slowtype virus infections. Cancer or leukaemia appears as a late and occasional sequel to infection. The virus, its antigens or fragments of its nucleic acid are often detectable in malignant cells.",

Its nature and severity will depend on infecting dose and route, and on the host's age, sex, nutritional status, genetic background and so on (see Chapter 11). Many infections are asymptomatic in more than 90% of individuals, clinically characterised disease occurring in only an occasional unfortunate host, as 'the tip of the iceberg'. Asymptomatically infected individuals who may continue to shed pathogen are important because they are not identified, move normally in the community, and play an important part in transmission. This chapter deals with demonstrable cell and tissue damage or dysfunction in infectious diseases. But one of the earliest indications of illness is malaise, or 'not feeling very well'. This is distinct from fever or a specific complaint such as a sore throat and, although it is difficult to define and impossible to measure, we all know the feeling. It can precede the onset of more specific signs and symptoms, or accompany them. Sometimes it is the only indication that an infection is taking place but almost nothing is known of the basis for this feeling. 'Toxins', of course, have been invoked and the early response to pyrogens before body temperature has actually risen and may play a part. Interferons may have something to do with it because pure preparations of human \u03b1or \u03b2-interferons cause malaise and often headaches, and muscle aches after injection into normal individuals. Soluble mediators of immune and inflammatory responses, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1; see Glossary) or other cytokines doubtless also play a part. Several cytokines induce release of prostaglandin E2 which, in addition to its effect on fever, reduces the pain threshold in neurons, and this could account for aches and pains.",

            "text": "Before giving an account of the mechanisms by which pathogens induce damage in the host, it is important to remember that many infectious agents cause little or no damage. Indeed, it is of some advantage to the microorganism to cause minimal host damage, as discussed in Chapter 1. Many virus infections fall into this category. Thus, although infection with rabies or measles viruses nearly always causes disease, there are many enterovirus, reovirus and myxovirus infections that are typically asymptomatic. Even viruses that are named for their common association with disease (poliomyelitis, influenza, Japanese encephalitis) may also be associated with infections in which an antibody response is the only sign of the presence of the pathogen, and tissue damage is too slight to cause detectable illness. There is a tendency for persistent viruses to cause no more than minor or delayed cellular damage during their persistence in the body, even if the same virus has a more cytopathic effect during an acute infection, e.g. adenoviruses and herpes simplex (see Chapter 10). A few viruses are remarkable because they cause no pathological changes at all in the cell, even during a productive infection in which infectious virus particles are produced. For instance, mouse cells infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) (see Glossary) or murine leukaemia virus show no pathological changes. The recently identified Torque Tenoviruses (TTVs) are ubiquitous in the human population and appear to establish persistent infections; however, no concrete association with any disease has been demonstrated. Throughout the life of the animal, virus and viral antigens are produced in the cerebellum, liver, retina, etc. without discernible effect on cell function. But sometimes there are important functional changes in infected cells which lead to a pathological result. For example, the virus infects growth-hormone-producing cells in the anterior pituitary. Although the cells appear perfectly healthy, the output of growth hormone is reduced, and as a result of this, suckling mice fail to gain weight normally and are runted.",

            "text": "As discussed previously, there are many millions of commensal bacteria which make up the microbiota, which serve important functions for their host. Of course, these bacteria are not typically involved in causing damage. Bacteria such as meningococci and pneumococci, whose names imply pathogenicity, spend most of their time as harmless inhabitants of the normal human nasopharynx: only occasionally do they have the opportunity to invade tissues and give rise to meningitis or pneumonia. However, when bacteria invade tissues, they almost inevitably cause some damage, and this is also true for fungi and protozoa. Some of the damage may not be severe in nature. For example, Treponema pallidum produces no toxins, does not cause fever and attaches to cells in vitro without harmful effects. Leprosy and tubercle bacilli eventually damage and kill the macrophages in which they replicate, but pathological changes are to a large extent caused by indirect mechanisms (see below). In patients with untreated lepromatous leprosy, the bacteria in the skin invade blood vessels, and large numbers of bacteria, many of them free, may be found in the blood. In spite of the continued presence of up to 10 5 bacteria/ml of blood, there are no signs or symptoms of septicaemia or toxaemia. Mycobacterium leprae can be regarded as a very successful parasite that induces very little host response in these patients, even when the bloodstream is invaded.",

            "text": "Cell and tissue damages are sometimes due to the direct local action of the microorganism. However, in many cases it is not clear how the death of cells results from virus infection. Virus infections result in a shutdown of RNA synthesis (transcription), protein synthesis (translation) and DNA synthesis in the host cell, but often these are too slow to account for the death of the cell. After all, cells like neurons never synthesise DNA, and the half-life of most proteins and even RNAs is at least several hours. A possible alternative mechanism is the alteration of the differential permeability of the plasma membrane. This is important as the cell has a high internal K 1 concentration and low Na 1 concentration, while the reverse is true of body fluids. Viruses do alter membrane permeability, but the unresolved question is whether or not this is responsible for the death of the cell or whether it is merely an after effect.",

This is the natural process by which the body controls cell numbers and rids itself of superfluous or redundant cells during development. Cells do not disintegrate but round up and are then removed by phagocytes. Apoptosis in virus infections can be regarded as a host strategy for destroying infected cells. The chromatin condenses round the edge of the nucleus and a cellular endonuclease cleaves the DNA into 180\u00c0200 base pair fragments. The cell membrane forms blebs but stays intact while the cell as a whole breaks up into smaller bodies. The suicide process is more controlled, almost more dignified, than mere disintegration and necrosis. In the latter there is early loss of membrane integrity, spillage of cell contents and random break-up of DNA.",

The first are inclusion bodies, parts of the cell with altered staining behaviour which develop during infection. They often represent either cell organelles or virus factories in which viral proteins and/or nucleic acids are being synthesised and assembled. Herpes group viruses form intranuclear inclusions, rabies and poxviruses intracytoplasmic inclusions, and measles virus both intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusions. The second characteristic morphological change caused by viruses is the formation of multinucleate giant cells. This occurs, for instance, when HIV 'fusion' proteins (gp120\u00c0gp41) present on the surface of an infected cell attach to CD4 receptors in the plasma membranes of neighbouring cells; membranes then fuse and multinucleate cells are formed. This fusion mimics the fusion event that occurs when an enveloped virus binds to the surface of an uninfected cell and the virus membrane and cellular membranes fuse, so allowing entry of the virus genome and proteins to the cell. This cell\u00c0cell fusion can also be observed following infection with paramyxovirus (measles, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)) and certain herpes viruses.",

Here the direct damage is of such a magnitude that the susceptible host dies a mere 6 h after infection. If Rift Valley Fever virus, an arthropod-borne virus infecting cattle, sheep and man in Africa, is injected in very large doses intravenously into mice, the injected virus rapidly infects nearly all hepatic cells. Hepatic cells show nuclear inclusions within an hour and necrosis by four hours. As the single cycle of growth in hepatic cells is completed, massive liver necrosis takes place, and mice die only 6 h after initial infection. The host defences in the form of local lymph nodes, local tissue phagocytes, etc. are completely overcome by the intravenous route of injection, and by the inability of Kupffer cells to prevent infection of hepatic cells. Direct damage by the replicating virus destroys hepatic cells long before immune or interferon responses have an opportunity to control the infection. The experimental situation is artificial, but it illustrates direct and lethal damage to host tissues after all host defence mechanisms have been overwhelmed.",

This action, however, is confined to the infected cell, and toxic microbial products are not liberated to damage other cells. Mycoplasma (see Table A .3) can grow in special cell-free media, but in the infected individual they generally multiply while attached to the surface of host cells. As studied in culture and on the respiratory epithelium, they 'burrow' down between cells, inhibit the beat of cilia and cause cell necrosis and detachment. The mechanism is not clear. If a complete lawn of mycoplasma covers the surface of the host cell, some effect on the health of the cell is to be expected, but it is possible that toxic materials are produced or are present on the surface of the mycoplasma. Intracellular bacterial pathogens generally damage the cells in which they replicate (see Chapter 4). Listeria, Brucella and Mycobacteria are specialists at intracellular growth, and the infected phagocyte is slowly destroyed as increasing numbers of bacteria are produced in it. Bacteria such as staphylococci and streptococci grow primarily in extracellular fluids but can also invade and proliferate in epithelial and endothelial cells. They are also ingested by phagocytic cells, and virulent strains of bacteria in particular have the ability to destroy the phagocyte in which they find themselves or can avoid killing and proliferate within the phagocytes, as described in Chapter 4. Many bacteria cause extensive tissue damage by the liberation of toxins into extracellular fluids. Various toxins have been identified and characterised. Most act locally, but a few cause pathological changes after spreading systemically through the body.",

This view is too embracing, because it includes proteins of doubtful significance in disease and also too restrictive, because it excludes non-protein toxic complexes such as endotoxin. Another suggestion is that toxin must include all naturally occurring substances (of plant, animal, bacterial or whatever origin) which, when introduced into a foreign host, are adverse to the well-being or life of the victim. This, too, is unsatisfactory because some substances \u00c0 potent toxins within the scope of this definition \u00c0 are being used in some contexts as therapeutic agents!

A good example is the \u03b1-toxin of C. perfringens, the organism most commonly associated with gas gangrene. It is strictly anaerobic and occurs as a normal inhabitant in the large intestines of man and animals; its spores are ubiquitous in soil, dust and air. C. perfringens does not multiply in healthy tissues but grows rapidly when it reaches devitalised and therefore anaerobic tissues. This could be after contamination of a natural wound with soil or dust, particularly on battlefields or in automobile accidents, or after contamination of a surgical operation site with clostridia from the patient's own bowels or skin. After abortions, particularly in the old days before antibiotics, intestinal clostridia often gained access to necrotic or devitalised tissues in the uterus and set up life-threatening infections. Invasion of the blood was common and soon resulted in death, the clostridia localising and growing in internal organs such as the liver after death. C. perfringens has various enzymes that enable it to break down connective tissue materials, including collagen and hyaluronidase, thereby facilitating spread of the infection along tissue planes. Most of these enzymes are toxic to host cells and tissues, but \u03b1-toxin is easily the most important one. It is dermonecrotic, haemolytic (a feature seen mainly in tissues close to the focus of infection but sometimes responsible for large-scale intravascular haemolysis in infected patients), causes turbidity in lipoprotein-rich solutions and is lethal. While it is still true that these activities are all due to one molecular species, they are not (as was once thought) different expressions of the one enzymic activity.",

It is of undoubted importance in gas gangrene. Toxoid prepared by formalin-treated toxin will protect sheep against infection caused by C. perfringens. The main basis of toxicity is the consequence of the ability of the \u03b1-toxin, in sublytic doses, to cause profound metabolic changes arising from release of phospholipid derivatives. The activation of the arachidonic acid cascade results in the production of leukotrienes (increasing vascular permeability), prostaglandins and thromboxanes (causing inflammation, muscle contraction and platelet aggregation). This toxin also upregulates expression of endothelial leucocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and neutrophil chemoattractant-activator IL-8, thereby impairing delivery of phagocytes to the site of infection. Clostridial illness can be mild or very severe according to the extent of bacterial spread, and the quantity of toxins that are formed and absorbed. Since the bacteria grow and produce their toxins only in devitalised tissues, the most important form of treatment is to remove such tissues. Clostridia are strictly anaerobic and exposure of the patient to hyperbaric oxygen (pure oxygen at 2\u00c03 atmospheres in a pressure chamber) has been found useful in addition to chemotherapy.",

They constitute the largest group of bacterial pore-forming toxins and are widespread among Gram-negative pathogens. In general, the role of RTXs in disease is not clear but three examples are given where RTXs are important. Escherichia coli \u03b1-haemolysin, regarded as the prototype of this group, is important in extraintestinal infections caused by this organism; the toxin is active against a broad range of mammalian cells. Leukotoxin from Pasteurella haemolytica exhibits narrow target cell and host specificities; it specifically kills ruminant leucocytes and is important in bovine pneumonic pasteurellosis. The third example is the 'invasive' adenylate cyclase toxin of Bordetella pertussis. This toxin is unique among this group in that it is a large bifunctional toxin: it has both haemolytic (Hly) and adenylate cyclase (AC) activities, hence the designations AC-Hly, AC toxin, CyaA, and is known to be important in the early stages of respiratory tract colonisation. Strictly it is the haemolysin part of the molecule which belongs to the RTX family and its main function appears to be in translocation of the AC moiety into the cell where cAMP levels are elevated with ensuing pathophysiological sequelae.",

Like streptolysin O and staphylococcal \u03b4-toxin, it is secreted as a water-soluble protein and undergoes self-induced oligomerisation on cell membranes to form heptameric pores. Recently, the receptor for \u03b1-toxin was identified as a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 (ADAM-10) molecule, which upon binding relocate to calveolin-enriched lipid rafts which lead to clustering of signal molecules. Ultimately the interaction leads to upregulation of ADAM-10 metalloprotease activity leading to the cleavage of E-cadherin and disruption of epithelial barrier function.

S binds first to cell receptors, several of which have been recently identified (important in defining target cell specificity), followed by F which acts synergistically with S to create functional pores in the target membrane. There are at least six class S proteins and five class F proteins which can give rise to ca. 30 biologically active combinations, a fact which could be highly significant in that some strains produce more than one binary leukocidin. Although various S\u00c0F combinations exhibit different target cell specificities, most are active against PMNs. For example, Panton\u00c0Valentine leukocidin is highly active against human PMNs binding to the human complement receptor C5aR and causes release of leukotriene B4, IL-8, histamine and tissue degradative enzymes, which likely accounts for some of the respiratory tissue damage and severe symptoms associated with necrotising pneumonia.

The toxins are superantigens by virtue of their ability to bind to major histocompatibility (MHC) class II molecules, outside the antigen-binding grove. They are presented as unprocessed proteins to certain T lymphocytes expressing specific T-cell receptor (TCR) motifs located in the variable domain of the \u03b2-chain (V\u03b2) of the TCR (see Chapters 6 and 7). Nanogram to picogram quantities of superantigen will stimulate up to 20% of all T cells, compared with only 0.001\u00c00.00001% T cells stimulated by conventional presentation of antigen to TCR. As a consequence of this huge proliferation of T cells and expression/release of aberrantly high levels of cytokines and other mediators, many biological systems are affected causing lethality/shock. This represents an important interference with a coordinated immune response, and the widespread polyclonal activation and cytokine release can be regarded as a microbial strategy, a 'diversion' of host immune defences. Ironically, the superantigen not only expands the circulating T-cell population but also reacts with developing T cells in the thymus, causing the same subpopulation to decline (see Chapter 7). It seems probable that these effects on immune cells represent a more important biological function of these toxins than the one responsible for the characteristics of disease; the latter may be no more than an 'accidental' phenomenon. For example, it may be that superantigens' main role is to subvert the T-cell response in localised infections leading to immune avoidance and persistence. It turns out that similar molecules are formed by Yersinia, mycoplasma and by certain retroviruses (e.g. the Mls antigen of mouse mammary tumour virus). It has been shown experimentally (or proposed) that immune stimulation, cytokine release, induction of capillary leak, shock and lethality are related to the superantigenicity This represents a much more complex route to an intracellular target. As described in the text it involves interaction of CTB subunits (shaded part of molecule) with ganglioside receptor GM1 (vertical arrow), receptor-mediated endocytosis, retrograde transport of the endosome to the TGN, through the Golgi to the ER, and anterograde transport of liberated CTA1 from ER in vesicles directed to the basolateral membrane, the intracellular location of adenyl cyclase. This mechanism is operative at least for several other toxins. of these proteins. However, there are other biological activities of these toxins which are not mediated by their superantigenicity. Some of these activities are common to all, and others specific to certain members of this group. The red skin rash elicited by the streptococcal toxins (which gave rise to the original nomenclature 'erythrogenic' toxins) is regarded as a secondary hypersensitive effect, but pyrogenicity is the result of direct action on the hypothalamus as well as release of IL-1 and TNF-\u03b1 from macrophages. Staphylococci cause food poisoning on a worldwide scale but particularly in countries such as France which consume large quantities of unpasteurised cheese. Infection rates are under-reported, probably because it is normally a self-limiting gastrointestinal disease. Onset of disease is rapid after consumption of food contaminated with a subgroup of the superantigen family (enterotoxins) which have emetic activity (capacity to induce vomiting). The main features of the disease are diarrhoea and severe vomiting, the latter being due to enterotoxin stimulation of the vagus nerve.",

EF-1-GTP interacts with aminoacyl-tRNA; this complex is docked into site A, EF-l-GTP becomes EF-1-GDP and is recycled as shown. After peptidyl transfer, EF-2-GTP catalyses transfer of the extended peptide to site P, and is itself autocatalytically converted to EF-2-GDP. DTA and PEA each ADP-ribosylates diphthamide (a modified histidine) in EF-2-GTP, which can no longer translocate the newly elongated peptide from the A site to the P site.

TSST-1 is isolated only from menstrual cases of TSS: this toxin has the ability to cross the vaginal mucosal barrier whereas the other SEs do not.

C. diphtheriae organisms multiply on the epithelial surfaces of the body (nose, throat, skin) but do not penetrate deeply into underlying tissues. The infection on the body surface causes necrosis of mucosal cells with an inflammatory exudate and the formation of a thick 'membrane' (hence the name C. diphtheriae: Gr., diphthera 5 membrane) and if the infection spreads into the larynx there may be respiratory obstruction.

However, in Chapter 2, the importance of gut invasiveness in Shigella infections was emphasised. While it is not at all clear how ShT can be involved in the watery diarrhoea phase of dysentery, it is perceived as exacerbating the bloody diarrhoea phase rather than initiating it. In contrast there is now evidence that ShLTs are important in haemorrhagic colitis (HC) and haemolytic urea syndrome (HUS) caused by ShLT-producing strains of enterohaemorrhagic (EHEC) E. coli: EHEC has the capacity to progress disease beyond a watery diarrhoea stage to HC and HUS; the latter is characterised by renal failure, thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia. This virulence attribute is due to possession of one or more of a family of ShLTs. As in dysentery, the role of ShLT in the causation of watery diarrhoea is controversial and indeed it may not be absolutely necessary. Importantly, the normal reservoir for EHEC is not humans but the terminal rectum of the cow, where it colonises without causing clinical symptoms of disease. This suggests that the potent effects of ShLT made by EHEC causing infections of humans are unlikely to be the main purpose of their expression and that there is likely to be another less pathological role in its main niche. This may involve promotion of colonisation through subtle effects on the local bovine gut epithelium.",

V. cholerae colonises the upper small intestine by adhering to epithelial cells. Water and electrolytes are lost through the intact epithelial cells into the small intestine.

Anuria develops, and the collapsed, lethargic patient may die in L FIGURE 8.11 Mode of action of CT, E. coli LT toxins and pertussigen (PT). There are five main features in this diagram. 1. The production of cAMP by adenyl cyclase. Cyclic AMP is an important second messenger involved in the intracellular amplification of many cellular responses to external signals including hormones. The nature of the physiological response reflects the differentiation of the cell responding to the stimulus. For, example, in gut cells the response would be altered ion transport and hence fluid secretion; in muscle cells it would be glycogen breakdown in response to the call for more energy. The production of cAMP is controlled both positively (a) and negatively (b) at two levels. Interaction of hormone and receptor releases the heterotrimeric (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) G-protein regulator complex which, upon binding GTP, dissociates into \u03b1-GTP and \u03b2\u03b3. The \u03b1-subunit may be stimulatory (\u03b1 s ) and activate adenyl cyclase (as in (a)) or inhibitory (\u03b1 i ) and inhibit adenyl cyclase (as in (b)); adenyl cyclase is not shown structurally in the diagram. In gut cells the receptor would be on the nonluminal basolateral side enabling enterocytes to respond to stimuli from the circulation. 2. The second level of control involves endogenous GTPase properties of both \u03b1 s and \u03b1 i subunits of the G-protein regulator: \u03b1 s -GDP and \u03b1 i -GDP are inactive. 3. The level of cAMP may be affected by physiological stimuli or by perturbation of the normal regulatory cycle as illustrated, by CT and LTs in enterocytes (a) or PT in a pancreatic B cell (b). 4. CTA1 ADP-ribosylates \u03b1 s -GTP which promotes continued dissociation of the heterotrimer and also inactivates the endogenous GTPase activity. Hence stimulation of the cyclase continues. LTs act in a similar manner. 5. PTS1 ADP-ribosylates the \u03b1 i -GDP\u03b2\u03b3-heterotrimer which can no longer associate with the receptor or lose GDP to undergo another cycle of GTP activation; active cyclase can no longer be turned off. In pancreatic cells this results in loss of inhibition of insulin secretion.",

The infection is particularly severe in children who easily develop low levels of plasma potassium. However, on a global scale this greatly feared disease, cholera, is only responsible for less than 1% of the total deaths due to diarrhoea. The genome of V. cholerae contains genetic elements which are important in V. cholerae virulence: CTX\u03c6 (the genome of a filamentous bacteriophage) which encodes the CT, and a large pathogenicity island VPI (for V. cholerae pathogenicity island). VPI is the integrated genome of another large filamentous bacteriophage (VPI\u03c6) and encodes the toxin coregulated type IV gilus (Tcp). Of the numerous colonisation factors known to be produced by V. cholerae, only Tcp has been proven to be important in human disease. Tcp is a remarkable entity; its subunit TcpA is a coat protein of VPI\u03c6, but it also acts as a receptor for CTX\u03c6 and mediates interbacterial adherence. Thus, as a result of sequential infection by two 'pathophages', V. cholerae acquires the ability to colonise the human gut and secrete classical CT, which is a potent enterotoxin. The integration into the chromosome of these phage genomes brings their expression under the control of regulatory genes in the the cell membrane followed by C2I. The latter is internalised and upsets the equilibrium between polymerisation and depolymerisation of actin. ADP-ribosylation of actin inhibits its polymerisation and turns G-actin into a capping protein which binds to the fast-growing (concave) ends of actin filaments. Capping of the concave ends increases the critical concentration for actin polymerisation. Since the slow-growing (pointed) ends of actin filaments are free, depolymerisation of actin occurs at these ends. Released actin is substrate for the toxin and will be withdrawn from the tread-milling pool of actin by ADP-ribosylation, i.e. trapped. Both reactions will finally induce the breakdown of the microfilament network.

The causative agent, B. pertussis, is transmitted aerially from the respiratory tract of an infected individual to that of a susceptible host. The organism attaches via several adhesins \u00c0 filamentous haemagglutinin, fimbriae and the 69 kDa outer-membrane protein, pertactin \u00c0 to the mucosal surface between cilia, and multiplies there during the incubation period of the disease, which is commonly around seven days. The infection then manifests as a slight fever and catarrh which is often indistinguishable from a common cold. However, 1\u00c02 weeks later bouts of uncontrollable coughing begin. It is this paroxysmal coughing, along with the notorious 'whoop' as the child attempts to draw breath, which characterises the disease. The paroxysmal coughing stage often lasts for several weeks and no treatment is fully effective in controlling the symptoms. The only proven means of controlling whooping cough is vaccination but, in the United Kingdom at least, sporadic reports of vaccineinduced brain damage in infants has diminished public acceptance of the vaccine. However, it should be noted that permanent encephalopathy (brain damage) is a recognised though rare consequence of whooping cough infection.",

The site of infection may be a contaminated splinter just as well as an automobile or battle injury. It also reaches the CNS by travelling up other peripheral nerves following blood-borne dissemination of the toxin through the body. The B part of the toxin binds to dissialogangliosides (GD2 and GD1b) on the neuronal membrane and movement of the protein across that membrane into the neuron is promoted by the presence of a translocation domain. The motor nerves in the brainstem are short and therefore the cranial nerves are among the first to be affected, causing spasms of eye muscles and jaw (lockjaw). There is also an increase in tonus of muscles round the site of infection, followed by tonic spasms. In generalised tetanus there is interference with respiratory movements, and without skilled treatment the mortality rate is about 50%.

LPS causes the release of vasoactive substances, activates the alternative pathway of the complement cascade and also activates factor XII (Hageman factor), the first step of the coagulation cascade, which sometimes results in disseminated intravascular coagulation. Many, perhaps nearly all, of the actions of LPS are due to the stimulation of cytokine release from macrophages and other cells. There is an effect on the circulation, leading ultimately to vascular collapse. The vascular regions most affected differ from species to species; in man and sheep the main changes are found in the lungs. LPS has powerful immunological actions, which is surely no accident; as well as activating the complement system, it induces IL-1 production and is a potent B-cell mitogen. Man is one of the most sensitive of all species to the pyrogenic action of endotoxin. A dose of 2 ng/kg of body weight injected intravenously into man causes the release of the endogenous pyrogen IL-1 and TNF from macrophages, which act on the hypothalamus to give an elevation of body temperature within an hour. It is possible that the pyrogenic action of LPS helps to generate fever in Gram-negative bacterial infections, but LPS is not the only bacterial factor capable of inducing a febrile response.

It is for this reason that considerable effort in recent years has gone into the development of antilipid A antibodies for use as therapeutic agents to combat shock in such situations; the success rate is only partial and the expense enormous. It may be feasible to develop synthetic derivatives which would neutralise the biological activity of lipid A. However, the characteristics of the O-antigen polysaccharide are sometimes important in determining virulence: certain chemotypes are important in resisting phagocytosis.",

But remember that microbes that replicate inside host cells are less likely to form powerful toxins because they cannot afford to damage at too early a stage the cell in which they are multiplying. Thus, toxins are not prominent products in intracellular infections due to Mycobacteria, Brucella, Rickettsiae, Mycoplasma or Chlamydia, and viruses do not form toxins.",

It is therefore not unreasonable to ask how many of the well-known toxins are actually useful to the microbe as well as being important in causing disease in the host (Table 8 .4).

            "text": "In infectious diseases there is nearly always a certain amount of direct microbial damage to host tissues, as discussed above. Host cells are destroyed or blood vessels injured as a direct result of the action of microbes or their toxins. Blood vessel injuries account for much of the disease picture in rickettsial infections (see above). Inflammatory materials are liberated from necrotic cells, whatever the cause of the necrosis. Also many bacteria themselves liberate inflammatory products and certain viruses cause living infected cells to release inflammatory mediators. Therefore it is not always clear how much of the inflammation is directly microbial rather than host in origin. For instance, peptidoglycan of Haemophilus influenzae type b causes acute inflammation when introduced into the cerebrospinal fluid of adult rats. Probably much of this is caused by inflammatory mediators from the host; TNF-\u03b1 is detectable in cerebrospinal fluid of most cases of purulent bacterial meningitis in humans and there are raised concentrations in the serum of patients with Plasmodium falciparum malaria. But inevitably the host (see Chapter 3) generates inflammatory and other tissue responses, and these responses sometimes account for the greater part of the tissue changes. Pathological changes can then be regarded as occurring indirectly as a result of these responses to the infection. Inflammation causes redness, swelling, pain and sometimes loss of function of the affected part (see Chapter 6) and is generally a major cause of the signs and symptoms of disease. Indirect damage attributable to the host immune response is discussed separately below. In most diseases direct and indirect types of damage both make a contribution to pathological changes, but in a given disease one or the other may predominate. In a staphylococcal abscess the bacteria produce inflammatory materials, but they also kill infiltrating polymorphs whose lysosomal enzymes are thereby liberated and induce further inflammation. This type of indirect non-immunological damage is sometimes important in streptococcal infections. Virulent streptococci produce various toxins that damage phagocytes and also bear on their surfaces substances that impede phagocytosis (see Chapter 4). Nevertheless, with the help of antibody, all streptococci are eventually phagocytosed and killed and the infection terminated. Unlike the staphylococci, however, killed group A streptococci pose a digestive problem for phagocytic cells. The peptidoglycan component of the streptococcal cell wall is very resistant to digestion by lysosomal enzymes. Hence macrophages laden with indigestible streptococcal cell walls tend to accumulate in sites of infection. Lysosomal enzymes, including collagenase, leak from these macrophages, causing local destruction of collagen fibres and the connective tissue matrix. Macrophages secrete many other substances, some of which may contribute to cell and tissue damage. Many macrophages eventually die or form giant cells, sometimes giving rise to granulomatous lesions. In this way, persistent streptococcal materials sometimes cause chronic inflammatory lesions in the infected host. An additional immunopathological contribution to the lesions is to be expected if the host is sensitised to peptidoglycan components. Other pathogenic microorganisms that are digested with difficulty by phagocytes include Listeria, Shigella, Candida albicans and, of course, Mycobacteria, but the importance of this in the pathogenesis of disease is not generally clear.",

Such changes caused by the immune response are classed as immunopathological. Sometimes they are very severe, leading to serious disease or death, but at other times they play a minimal part in the pathogenesis of disease. With the possible exception of certain vertically transmitted virus infections and the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (prion diseases), there are signs of an immune response in all infections. Therefore it is to be expected that there will nearly always be some contribution of the immune response to pathological changes. Often the immunological contribution is small, but sometimes it forms a major part of the disease. For instance, in tuberculosis (TB) the pathological picture is dominated by the operation of a strong and persistent cell-mediated immunity (CMI) response to the invading bacillus. In the classical tubercle a central zone of bacilli with large mononuclear and giant cells, often with some necrosis, is surrounded by fibroblasts and lymphocytes. Mononuclear infiltrations, giant cells and granulomatous lesions are characteristic pathological features of TB. When macrophages are killed by intracellular mycobacteria, the lysosomal enzymes and other materials released from the degenerating cell contribute to chronic inflammation as in the case of the streptococcal lesions referred to above.",

The reaction takes place mostly at the body surfaces, resulting in the release of histamine, eosinophil and neutrophil chemotactic factors, leukotrienes and heparin from mast cells, and the activation of serotonin and plasma kinins. If the antigen\u00c0antibody interaction takes place on a large enough scale in the tissue, the histamine that is released can give rise to anaphylactic shock, the exact features depending on the sensitivity and particular reaction of the species of animal to histamine. Guinea pigs suffer from bronchospasm and asphyxia, and in man there are similar symptoms, sometimes with a fall in blood pressure and shock. This type of immunopathology, although accounting for anaphylactic reactions to horse serum or to penicillin, is not important in infectious diseases. When the antigen\u00c0IgE antibody interaction takes place at the body surface, there are local inflammatory events, giving rise to urticaria in the skin, and hay fever or asthma in the respiratory tract. This local type of anaphylaxis may play a part in the pathogenesis of virus infections of the upper respiratory tract (e.g. common cold, RSV infections of infants), or in skin rashes in infectious diseases. Type 1 reactions are common in helminth infections perhaps because IgE antibodies have an important role in protection against these parasites. The IgE antigen reaction, by causing inflammation, summons up from the blood anti-microbial forces such as polymorphs, antibodies and complement components. A dramatic Type 1 reaction can follow rupture of a hydatid cyst of Echinococcus granulosus (the dog tapeworm). Slow leakage of worm antigens means that mast cells are sensitised with specific IgE antibody, and the sudden release of antigen can cause life-threatening anaphylaxis. When the larvae of Ascaris lumbricoides pass through the lung on their journey from blood to intestine, they can give rise to IgE-mediated respiratory symptoms, with infiltration of eosinophils.",

If there is a large excess of antibody, each antigen molecule is covered with antibody and is removed rapidly by reticuloendothelial cells, which have receptors for the Fc portion of the antibody molecule (see Chapter 4). When equal amounts of antigen and antibody combine, lattice structures are produced, and these form large aggregates whose size ensures that they are also rapidly removed by reticuloendothelial cells. If, however, complexes are formed in antigen excess, the poorly coated antigen molecules are not removed by reticuloendothelial cells. They continue to circulate in the blood and have the opportunity to localise in small blood vessels elsewhere in the body. Complexes are deposited in the glomeruli of the kidneys, the choroid plexuses, joints and ciliary body of the eye. Factors may include local high blood pressure and turbulent flow (glomeruli), or the filtering function of the vessels involved (choroid plexus, ciliary body). In the glomeruli the complexes pass through the endothelial windows (Figure 8 .16) and come to lie beneath the basement membrane. The smallest-sized complexes pass through the basement membrane and seem to enter the urine. This is probably the normal mechanism of disposal of such complexes from the body. Immune complexes are formed in many, perhaps most, acute infectious diseases. Microbial antigens commonly circulate in the blood in viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoal, rickettsial, etc. infections. When the immune response has been generated and the first trickle of specific antibody enters the blood, immune complexes are formed in antigen excess. This is generally a transitional stage soon giving rise to antibody excess, as more and more antibody enters the blood and the infection is terminated. Sometimes the localisation of immune complexes and complement in kidney glomeruli 5 is associated with a local inflammatory response after complement activation. There is an infiltration of neutrophils, swelling of the glomerular basement membrane, loss of albumin, even red blood cells, in the urine and the patient has acute glomerulonephritis. This is seen following streptococcal infections, mainly in children (see below). As complexes cease to be formed the changes are reversed, and complete recovery is the rule.

Mesangial cells (macrophages of the kidneys) one of whose functions is to deal with such materials, enlarge, multiply and extend into the subepithelial space. If these changes are gradual there are no inflammatory changes, but the structure of the basement membrane alters, allowing proteins to leak through into the urine.

Antibodies formed against an unknown component of the streptococcus react with circulating streptococcal antigen, perhaps also with a circulating host antigen, and immune complexes are deposited in glomeruli. Streptococcal antibodies cross-reacting with the glomerular basement membrane or with streptococcal antigen trapped in the basement membrane may contribute to the picture. Deposition of complexes continues after the infection is terminated, and glomerulonephritis develops a week or two later. The streptococcal infection may be of the throat or skin, and Streptococcus pyogenes types 12 and 49 are frequently involved. Glomerulonephritis is also an important consequence of Lyme disease in dogs, caused by the tick-borne pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi.

The CMI response to infection dominates the pathological picture in TB, with mononuclear infiltration, degeneration of parasitised macrophages and the formation of giant cells as central features. These features of the tissue response result in the formation of granulomas (see Glossary) which reflect chronic infection and accompanying inflammation. There is a ding-dong battle as the host attempts to contain and control infection with a microorganism that is hard to eliminate. The granulomas represent chronic CMI responses to antigens released locally. Various other chronic microbial and parasitic diseases have granulomas as characteristic pathological features. These include chlamydial (lymphogranuloma inguinale), bacterial (syphilis, leprosy, actinomycosis) and fungal infections (coccidiomycosis). Antigens that are disposed of with difficulty in the body are more likely to be important inducers of granulomas.

After 7\u00c010 days, however, the mouse develops severe meningitis with submeningeal and subependymal oedema, and 6 Chagas' disease, common in Brazil, affects 12 million people and is transmitted by blood-sucking insects. After spreading through the body during the acute infection, the parasitaemia falls to a low level and there is no clinical disease. Years later a poorly understood chronic disease appears, involving heart and intestinal tract, which contain only small numbers of the parasite but show a loss of autonomic ganglion cells. An autoimmune mechanism is possible, because a monoclonal antibody to T. cruzi has been obtained that cross-reacts with mammalian neurons. dies. The illness can be completely prevented by adequate immunosuppression, and the lesions are attributable to the mouse's own vigorous CD8 1 T-cell response to infected cells. These cells present processed LCM viral peptides on their surface in conjunction with MHC class I proteins, and sensitised CD8 1 T cells, after entering the cerebrospinal fluid and encountering the infected cells, generate the inflammatory response and interference with normal neural function that cause the disease. The same cells destroy infected tissue cells in vitro, but tissue destruction is not a feature of the neurological disease. In this disease the CD8 1 T cells probably act by liberating inflammatory cytokines. It may be noted that the brain is uniquely vulnerable to inflammation and oedema, as pointed out earlier in this chapter. The infected mouse shows the same type of lesions in scattered foci of infection in the liver and elsewhere, but they are not a cause of sickness or death. LCM infection of mice is a classical example of immunopathology in which death itself is entirely due to the cell-mediated immune response of the infected individual. This response, although apparently irrelevant and harmful, is nevertheless an 'attempt' to do the right thing. It has been shown that immune T cells effectively inhibit LCM viral growth in infected organs. However, a response that in most extraneural sites would be useful and appropriate turns out to be self-destructive when it takes place in the CNS.",

For example, neural cells as well as immune cells have receptors for interleukins, and lymphocytes and macrophages secrete pituitary growth hormone. Work on Mycobacterium bovis grew out of observations from the turn of the century that stress appears to increase the death rate in children with TB. In one type of experiment, mice were stressed by being kept in a restraining device where movement was virtually impossible. This resulted in the reduction of expression of MHC class II antigens on macrophages, which correlated with increased susceptibility to infection. Similarly stressing mice infected with influenza virus caused several immunosuppressive events including reduction of inflammatory cells in the lung and decreased production of IL-2. Suppression of antibody responses is found in people suffering a type of stress familiar to students\u00c0examinations! The best responses to hepatitis B vaccine in students immunised on the third day of their examinations were found in those who reported the least stress.

Destruction of the liver also leads to a decrease in the rate of formation of the blood coagulation factor, prothrombin, and infected human beings or monkeys show prolonged coagulation and bleeding times. Haemorrhagic phenomena are therefore characteristic of severe yellow fever, including haemorrhage into the stomach and intestine. In the stomach the appearance of blood is altered by acid, and the vomiting of altered blood gave yellow fever another of its names, 'black vomit disease'. Haemorrhagic phenomena in infectious diseases can be due to direct microbial damage to blood vessels, as in certain rickettsial infections or in the virus infection responsible for haemorrhagic disease of deer. They may also be due to immunological damage to vessels as in the Arthus response or immune complex vasculitis, to any type of severe inflammation, and to the indirect mechanism illustrated above.

Sometimes the host cell is transformed by the virus and converted into a tumour cell, the virus either introducing a transforming gene into the cell, activating expression of a pre-existing cellular gene or inactivating the cell's own fail-safe tumour suppressor gene. DNA viruses require the cell to provide the nucleotides etc. required for new virus genomes and so have evolved proteins, which are necessary for virus replication, to drive the cell into S phase, where such 'building blocks' are produced. In the normal life cycle of these viruses, the cell will die as the virus completes its life cycle; however, in abortive infections where cell lysis occurs, these cells can continue to proliferate and transformation is often therefore an 'accidental' consequence of infection. The transforming genes of retroviruses are known as viral onc (vONC) genes. These vONC genes themselves originate from cellular oncogenes (cONC) which were taken up (transduced) into the genome of infecting viruses during infection. cONC are essential genes expressed within the host cell, where they play a role in normal growth and differentiation, often coding for recognised growth factors (e.g. human platelet-derived growth factor). The expression of these cellular genes is normally very tightly controlled; however, following transduction by a retrovirus they come under the control of the highly active virus promoter (LTR) and are expressed in infected cells. Additionally these transduced genes can be mutated within the virus-forming chimeric proteins with virus proteins, the net effect of this is to remove post-translational control of the activity of these proteins resulting in not only overexpression but constitutive activation.",

Although some infections generate antimicrobial responses such as interferon production and macrophage activation which would make a second infection less likely, co-infections are most common when local defences have been damaged by the first invader. The pathological results may be much more severe because there is a second infectious agent present. This can be considered as another mechanism of pathogenicity. Classical instances involve the respiratory tract. The destruction of ciliated epithelium in the lung by viruses such as influenza or measles allows normally non-pathogenic resident bacteria of the nose and throat, such as the pneumococcus or H. influenzae, to invade the lung and cause secondary pneumonia. If these bacteria enter the lung under normal circumstances, they are destroyed by alveolar macrophages or removed by the mucociliary escalator. In at least one instance the initial virus infection appears to act by interfering with the function of alveolar macrophages. Mice infected with parainfluenza 1 (Sendai) virus show greatly increased susceptibility to infection with H. influenzae, and this is largely due to the fact that alveolar macrophages infected with virus show a poor ability to phagocytose and kill the bacteria. Specialised respiratory pathogens such as influenza, measles, parainfluenza or rhinoviruses damage the nasopharyngeal mucosa and can lead in the same way to secondary bacterial infection, with nasal catarrh, sinusitis, otitis media or mastoiditis.

If the appropriate protease is in short supply or lacking completely, virions are formed but they are not infectious.

Diarrhoea is also a common affliction of travellers from developed countries, and business deals, athletic successes and holiday pleasures can be forfeited on the toilet seats of foreign lands. The most reliable prophylaxis is to 'cook it, peel it, or forget it'. Most attacks of diarrhoea are selflimiting. Diarrhoea means the passage of liquid faeces, 8 or faeces that take the shape of the receptacle rather than have their own shape. This could arise because of increased rate of propulsion by intestinal muscles, giving less time for reabsorption of water in the large bowel, or because there was an increase in the amount of fluid held or produced in the intestine. In many types of infectious diarrhoea, the exact mechanism is not known. Diarrhoea, on the one hand, can be regarded as a microbial device for promoting the shedding and spreading of the infection in the community, or, on the other hand, as a host device to hasten expulsion of the infectious agent. Diarrhoea is a superb mechanism for the dissemination of infected faeces and there is no doubt that strains of microbes are selected for their diarrhoea-producing powers.

            "text": "Before attempting to explain the pathophysiology of diarrhoeal disease, the normal structure and function of gut will be considered. The main function of the gut is the active inward transport of ions and nutrient solutes which is followed by the passive movement of water. The driving force is the Na 1 /K 1 ATPase situated in the basolateral membrane of enterocytes on the villus (), which maintains a low intracellular (Na 1 ), thus creating the electrochemical gradient favourable for Na 1 entry and a high regional (Na 1 ) in the intercellular spaces; C1 2 follows Na 1 . A similar situation exists in crypt cells: Na 1 /K 1 ATPase drives secretion. The key difference is the location of the carrier systems responsible for the facilitated entry of the actively transported species. In villus cells the carriers are present in the brush border, whereas in crypt cells they are located in the basal membrane: this is responsible for the vectorial aspects of ion/fluid traffic in villus/crypt assemblies. However, it is clear that several factors in addition to enterocytes are involved in regulating fluid transport in the gut; these include the enteric nervous system and the anatomy of the microcirculation. The latter plays a profoundly important role in the uptake of fluid. This is illustrated in Figure 8 .17, which shows the existence of zones of graded osmotic potential. At the tips of villi in adult human gut, osmolalities range from 700 to 800 mOsm/kg H 2 O, which would generate huge osmotic forces. Thus, current perceptions are that enterocytes are responsible for generating this gradient and the blood supply acts as a countercurrent multiplier which amplifies the gradient in a manner analogous to the loops of Henle in the kidney. The hypertonic zone has been demonstrated directly in whole villi of infant mice in terms of the changing morphology of erythrocytes: in the lower regions of villi they show characteristic discoid morphology, whereas in the upper region they are crenated, indicating a hyperosmotic environment. The hypertonicity is dissipated if the blood flow is too slow and washed out if too fast. It is the villus unit rather than enterocytes by themselves that is responsible for fluid uptake. Another consequence of the microcirculatory anatomy is that villus tip regions are relatively hypoxic.

            "text": "Diarrhoeal disease can result from interference with almost anyone, or a combination of these systems. The range of intestinal pathogens and the types of disease they cause is illustrated in Tables 8.7 and 8.8. Non-invasive pathogens like V. cholerae and enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) secrete toxins which perturb the ion transport systems. Invasive nonhistotoxic pathogens, such as some Salmonella strains (see Chapter 2) and rotavirus, invade villus tip cells which are then shed into the intestinal lumen. Invasive histotoxic pathogens, such as some strains of Salmonella (see Chapter 2), cause rapid toxin-mediated Movement of sodium into VR creates a concentration gradient between VR and AV, causing absorption of water from AV and surrounding tissue. This results in a progressive increase in the osmolarity of incoming blood moving into the tip region through to VR. Tip osmolarity is about three times higher than normal. Hyperosmolarity has been demonstrated in man and can be inferred in mice from the morphology of erythrocytes which changes during ascent of the same vessel from base to tip regions of villi. The intensity of shading indicates a vertical increase in osmolarity. The left crypt represents normal physiological secretion and the right crypt hypersecretion. ENS, the enteric nervous system, is depicted schematically and not anatomically. detachment of epithelial cells. Experimental rotavirus infections have been studied in great detail allowing us to delineate intermediate stages between initial infection, through clinical diarrhoea to recovery from infection. Campylobacter jejuni does not figure in our treatment so far despite the fact that C. jejuni and related species are the most common bacterial cause of diarrhoea in many industrialised countries. It is known that motility and adherence are critical stages of infection which then lead to cytoskeletal rearrangement, host cell death, and then tight junction disruption and cytokine induction which results in loss of epithelial cell function. This then leads to a disrupted barrier, poor absorptive functions and ultimately the symptoms of disease. The clinical picture of the pathogenesis of C. jejuni infection may be summarised as follows. In developing countries the most common clinical presentation is mild watery diarrhoea, whereas in developed countries disease often manifests as a severe inflammatory diarrhoea. No evidence has yet been found to suggest that the watery type and severe bloody type of diarrhoeas can be explained in terms of a C. jejuni equivalent of the ETEC and EHEC mechanisms described above. Current thinking proposes that the different disease patterns reflect the immunological status of the host. Those with full immunity experience no clinical disease, whereas those with no pre-immunity experience the full-blown bloody diarrhoea and those with partial immunity, watery diarrhoea. The incubation period can range from 1\u00c07 days and acute diarrhoea can last for 1\u00c02 days with abdominal pain which may persist after diarrhoea has stopped. Diarrhoeal stools often contain fresh blood, mucus and an inflammatory exudate with leucocytes; bacteremia may also occur though it is rarely reported. Infected mucosae may be oedematous and hyperaemic with petechial haemorrhages. The disease, even its severe form, tends to be self-limiting, despite the fact that organisms may be isolated for several weeks after resolution of the symptoms. We do, however, know that there is a strong correlation between infection with C. jejuni and Guillain\u00c0Barr\u00e9 syndrome which is the most notable complication of C. jejuni infection. Guillain\u00c0Barr\u00e9 syndrome is a peripheral neuropathy, and one possible cause may be an autoimmune phenomenon arising from molecular mimicry between the polysaccharide side chains of C. jejuni and neural gangliosides. 9 Rotaviruses are known to invade intestinal epithelial cells and cause diarrhoea in man, foals, dogs, pigs, mice, etc. Extensive multiplication takes place and very large amounts of virus (10 11 particles/g) are shed in faeces. The conventional wisdom is that tips of villi especially are affected, leading to reduced absorption of fluid from the lumen. In addition, destruction of enterocytes leads to a loss in lactase resulting in an accumulation of lactose in the gut causing an osmotic flux of fluid into the intestine. A major study of rotavirus-induced There are more than 1,000 serotypes of Salmonella, distinct from Salmonella typhi and Salmonella paratyphi. They are primarily parasites of animals, ranging from pythons to elephants, and their importance for man is their great tendency to colonise domestic animals. Pigs and poultry are commonly affected, and human disease follows the consumption of contaminated meat or eggs. b Other campylobacters cause sepsis, abortion and enteritis in animals. diarrhoea in neonatal mice provides a different model of this important disease of children.",

            "text": "The main features of this model are summarised in Figure 8 .18. Oral infection of the gut induces ischaemia in villi, followed by hypoxia, enterocyte damage, and shortening of villi. The perception is that it is the induction of ischaemia and not viral replication per se that results in these changes. It is during rapid resynthesis of the atrophied villi that maximum progression. This represents a schematic summary of the text on diarrhoeal disease. diarrhoea occurs due to the transient accumulation of excess NaCl in dividing cells. Unusually for viruses, an enterotoxin has been isolated which is the product of one of the viral genes (NSP4). Administration of NSP4 alone has been shown to cause a dose-dependent diarrhoea. NSP4 has been shown to block the apical sodium glucose symporter in rabbits, contributing to the Na imbalance. Prolongation of diarrhoea is seen to be due to the hyperaemic state of the newly reconstructed villi which reduces the hypertonicity of villi. Resolution of the diarrhoea occurs when microcirculation is restored to normal with concomitant restoration of hypertonic tip zones in villi. The preceding description of the self-limiting diarrhoea induced by rotavirus in neonatal mice is that of a basic response probably applicable to many diarrhoeas, since the features of the post-peak phase have often been reported or can be inferred in other infections. However, the observed pathology will be different according to age, host species, or the inducing pathogen. For example, in rotavirus-infected lambs, villus atrophy and crypt hypertrophy occur (the latter indicative of crypt cell division) but as in mice, infected lambs are not lactose intolerant. In rotavirus-infected swine piglets, crypt hypertrophy occurs but villus atrophy is severe, the animals are lactose intolerant and mortality is high; a similar situation exists for the coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus of swine. The latter has often been used as the model for infantile diarrhoea but the question is whether human infants are more like piglets or lambs. Clinical studies have shown that recovery from mild, acute gastroenteritis of rotavirus origin occurs within two weeks irrespective of the carbohydrate ingested. Clearly, the severity of disease and the clinical outcome will depend on the extent of 'vertical' villus/crypt involvement and the regions of intestine infected. When villus erosion is severe, then lactose may cause an 'osmotic' purge or be fermented by intestinal bacteria to short-chain fatty acids which stimulate secretion in the colon. Astroviruses, Norwalk virus, caliciviruses and certain adenoviruses all cause gastroenteritic disease by infecting enterocytes. However, parvoviruses cause severe intestinal disease in dogs by virtue of their predilection for the mitotically active crypt cells which is the cause of the nearcomplete erosion of villi similar to that seen after exposure to sublethal doses of irradiation.",
