HRVs are the single major cause of the common cold in populations of all ages. 1,2 Although rhinovirus infection is self-limiting, complications still occur in patients with asthma, congestive heart failure, bronchiectasis, and cystic fibrosis. 1 To date, no agent has been approved by the FDA for treatment of rhinovirus infection. In addition, the large number (>100) of known HRV serotypes makes vaccine development difficult. 3 Clinical treatments are directed toward relief of the most prominent symptoms of each clinical syndrome. Previous work on anti-rhinoviral therapeutic agents focused principally on capsid-binding anti-picornaviral compounds 4 and HRV 3C protease (3C pro ) inhibitors. 5, 6 HRV 3C pro is essential for virus replication, specifically catalyzing the cleavage of glutamine-glycine peptide bonds in a 230 kDa viral polyprotein produced by cellular translation of the viral RNA genome. HRV 3C pro belongs to the cysteine protease family, showing structural similarity to trypsin proteases, but sharing minimal homology with common mammalian enzymes. 7,8 Because of the importance of the enzyme in viral replication, and the high conservation of enzyme active site components in all known HRV serotypes, potent and selective HRV 3C pro inhibitors could be potential broad-spectrum anti-rhinoviral therapeutic agents. [9] [10] [11] As part of an effort to develop HRV 3C pro inhibitors, peptidomimetic approaches have been widely employed based on active site structure and cleavage specificity. To date, one peptidomimetic analog, rupintrivir (AG7088) (1), shown in Figure 1 , is the only HRV 3C Pro inhibitor that has advanced to the stage of human clinical trials. Phase II clinical trials of rupintrivir showed that intranasal delivery reduced the mean total daily symptom score by 33%. 12 Recently, several efforts to develop orally bioavailable anti-rhinoviral agents have been reported; these include a rupintrivir analog, 2, 13 with an improved pharmacokinetic profile, and the non-peptidic inhibitors 3 and 4. 14-16",

A series of compounds was synthesized by esterification of various carboxylic acids and hydroxy-heteroaromatic groups. Initial replacement of the pyridine moiety with various heteroaromatic rings was performed with retention of the 2-furoyl group. Commercially available hydroxy-heteroaromatic rings were esterified with 2-furoyl chloride in pyridine and CH 2 Cl 2 (7-18). Compound 19 was prepared from 4-hydroxyquinolinone (39) in two steps (Scheme 2). The structure and inhibitory activities of furan-2-carboxylate analogs (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) are shown in Table  1 . As a second series of analogs, with 5-halopyridyl esters, we used 5-chloro (or -bromo)-3-pyridinol for esterification with diverse carboxylic acid moieties. Compounds 20-29 were prepared with commercially available carboxylic acids. Compound 30 was synthesized by arylation of the -N-H group of the imidazole ring of 28, in a reaction with 4-trifluoromethylphenyl boronic acid followed by pyridine, with use of cupric acetate and 4-\u00c5 molecular sieves in CH 2 Cl 2 . 24 The synthesis of the 2-substituted oxazole-carboxylic acids of compounds 31-35 is outlined in Scheme 3. Briefly, acylation of 2-amino diethyl malonate (40a-e) using various acid chlorides followed by dehydrative cyclization employing trifluoroacetic anhydride or trichloroacetyl chloride under microwave conditions at 160\u00b0C for 5-10 min afforded the oxazoles 41a-e, 25 which were subjected to basic hydrolysis to yield the corresponding oxazole-carboxylic acids 42a-e. The structures and activities of the 5-chloro/bromopyridyl ester analogs are shown in Table 2 .",

In a rigid receptor structure, random orientations of ligand conformations were subjected to simulated annealing molecular dynamics. Final minimized poses of docked ligand were sorted by CHARMm energy (interaction energy plus ligand strain). Mass spectrometry and HPLC studies have already revealed the inhibition mechanism of heteroaromatic esters acting in the active site of SARS 3CL pro,20,22 Such esters initially bind competitively and strongly to the active site, being recognized by S1 pocket. The carbonyl carbon is then attacked by the nucleophilic Cys residue, and become covalently connected with the protease prior to eventual release. Thus in our study, possible prehydrolysis-binding complex models of 7 was generated (Fig. 2) . The lone pair electron of nitrogen moiety of 5-bromopyridine in 7 occupies the S1 binding pocket, forming a hydrogen bond with N e2 of His161 (3.1 \u00c5). The bromo group occupies S1 pocket near the protein surface and, notably, a hydrogen bond with the -NH of Gly166 (3.0 \u00c5) was observed, explaining the importance of the presence of a halogen group on the pyridine ring. The ester carbonyl oxygen forms a hydrogen bond with the -NH of Gly164 (2.5 \u00c5).

            "text": "To search for effective moieties other than the 2-furoyl group, a series of 5-halo-pyridinyl esters from various carboxylic acids was synthesized and tested. This R 2 carboxylic acids were expected to provide site specificity at S2 hydrophobic pocket and affect the covalently connected binding mode at the active site. Most compounds showed moderate-to-good inhibitory effects at 1 lM except for 29 and 31 (Table 2) . Compounds with thiophen-2carbonyl (20) , benzoyl (21) , phenylpropanoyl groups (36), and cinnamoyl (37) showed lower activities than did the 2-furoyl analogs (7 and 11) . Substitution of the 5 position of the furan ring with aromatic groups allowed retention of good activity (22) (23) (24) (25) . The steric effect of the additional aromatic groups could stabilize the postreaction state by p-stacking interaction with His40 22 rather than tight binding to S2 pocket. The 2-naphthoyl (26), 1-naphthoyl (27) , and imidazole (28) groups were useful building blocks, showing potent inhibitory activities (IC 50 of 290 nM for 28). However, arylation of the imidazole ring of 28 showed twofold decrease in activity (30), which could be caused by unfavorable constraint compared to furan ring.",

In the case of 3-methylisooxazole derivative, 29, the replaced position of furan oxygen by carbon atom resulted in the loss of activity significantly. However, oxazole derivatives (31-35) demonstrated a broad range of inhibitory activities depending on substitutions at the 2 position of the oxazole group. A cinnamyloxazole analog, 34, showed the highest activity among these compounds with 87% inhibition at 1 lM and an IC 50 value of 690 nM. Lower electron density of oxazol ring may result in weaker binding affinity than furan or imidazol moiety, but additional hydrophobic phenyl group in a proper position connected to 2oxazolic position with two carbon chain (34) significantly enhanced the inhibitory activity compared to the compounds with shorter chains or bulky aromatic groups (31-33, 35).",
