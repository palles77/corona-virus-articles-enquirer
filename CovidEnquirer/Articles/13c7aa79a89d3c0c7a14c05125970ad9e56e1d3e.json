The complete nucleotide sequence of the \"P\" gene has been obtained and is found to contain two open reading frames, neither of which is large enough to encode the P protein. We have shown that the P and V proteins are translated from two mRNAs that differ by the presence of two nontemplated G residues in the P mRNA. These two additional nucleotides convert the two open reading frames to one of 392 amino acids. The P and V proteins are amino coterminal and have 164 amino acids in common. The unique C terminus of V consists of a cysteine-rich region that resembles a cysteine-rich metal binding domain. An open reading frame that contains this cysteine-rich region exists in all other paramyxovirus \"P\" gene sequences examined, which suggests that it may have important biological significance.",

            "text": "In recent years the catalog of mechanisms identified as having a role in the processing or modification of the initial RNA transcripts to yield mature mRNAs has increased markedly. In eukaryotic cells the most common process found is splicing of the primary RNA transcript (Padgett et al., 1986) . Less common variations on this splicing theme are alternative splicing, such that exons are excluded from some, but not all, of the mature mRNA, giving rise to sequence diversity in the encoded proteins (for review, see Breitbart et al., 1987) , and trans splicing, in which two independently transcribed RNAs are ligated to form the mature mRNA (Konarska et al., 1985; Solnick, 1985; Murphy et al., 1986; Sutton and Boothroyd, 1986; Krause and Hirsh, 1987; Koller et al., 1987) . Mechanisms of RNA transcript modification other than splicing include the phenomenon of RNA-editing in mitochondrial transcripts from trypanosomes, which is characterized by the presence in the mature mRNA of uridine residues that are not encoded in the gene (Benne et al., 1986; Feagin et al., 1987 Feagin et al., , 1988 Shaw et al., 1988) . In addition, a process related to RNA-editing is thought to occur in primary transcripts of the mammalian apolipoprotein-B gene, as two discrete mRNAs have been found, one of which has a U residue in place of a templated C (Powell et al., 1987; Chen et al., 1987) .",

            "text": "In animal virus infected cells, many examples of spliced and alternatively spliced viral mRNAs have been identified. In addition, an unusual cotranslational modification has been identified in vaccinia virus late transcripts that possess a poly(A) leader at the 5' end not encoded by the virus genome (Bertholet et al., 1987; Schwer et al., 1987) . The 5' poly(A) region is thought to be added by the vaccinia polymerase \"stuttering\" at a series of T residues on the template DNA (Schwer and Stunnenberg, 1988) . In many virus systems, in addition to modification of the primary RNA transcripts, the maximum protein coding potential on an mRNA is exploited by the use of alternative translation strategies that also have a potential role in the regulation of viral gene expression. Such mechanisms include translation from overlapping reading frames as observed for the coat, lysis, and synthetase proteins of bacteriophage MS2 (Atkins et al., 1979) and the adenovirus E1B proteins (Bos et al., 1981) ; ribosomal frameshifting that occurs to yield the gag-pol fusion proteins of Rous sarcoma virus, human immunodeficiency virus, or mouse mammary tumour virus (Jacks and Varmus, 1985; Jacks et al., 1987; Varmus, 1988) , and that also occurs in the polymerase encoding region of infectious bronchitis virus (Boursnell et al., 1987; Brierley et al., 1987) ; and the use of suppressor tRNAs to overcome translation termination during translation of the gag-pol fusion protein in Moloney murine leukemia virus (Yoshinaka et al., 1985) and the nsP4 protein of Sindbis virus (Strauss et al., 1983 )~ In negative strand RNA viruses, several of the processes discussed above are involved in the regulation of viral gene expression. For instance, in influenza A and B viruses, both spliced and unspliced mRNAs that are translated to yield polypeptides from overlapping reading frames have been identified (Lamb and Lai, 1980; Briedis and Lamb, 1982) , and influenza A viruses also provide an example of alternatively spliced mRNAs (Lamb et al., 1981) . Translation from overlapping reading frames on functionally bicistronic mRNAs has been shown to be the mechanism used to yield the NA and NB glycoproteins of influenza B virus (Shaw et al., 1983) and the P and C proteins of the paramyxoviruses Sendal virus and parainfluenza virus 3 and the morbillivirus, measles virus (Giorgi et al., 1983; Gupta and Kingsbury, 1985; Curran et al., 1986; Luk et al., 1986; Galinski et al., 1986; Spriggs and Collins, 1986; Bellini et al., 1985) .",

The nucleotide sequence of clone P203-1 is presented in Figure 1 in the mRNA sense. It is 1298 nucleotides in length and contains an untranslated region of 60 nucleotides preceding the first AUG codon at nucleotides 61-63. Primer extension nucleotide sequencing on mRNA isolated from SV5infected cells indicated that nucleotide 1 is the 5' terminal nucleotide of the mRNA (data not shown). At the 3' end after nucleotide 1298 in the different clones, there is a stretch of A residues of variable length. The open reading frame following the first AUG codon (reading frame 0) is capable of encoding a protein of 222 amino acids. In the +1 reading frame there is an overlapping open reading frame of 250 amino acids, as illustrated schematically in Figure 2 . Although either reading frame could encode protein V (Mr \"~ 24,000), neither of the open reading frames is apparently large enough to encode P, a protein of M r ~-44,000 (Paterson et al., 1984) , assuming the electrophoretic mobility of P is not aberrant. Examination of the predicted amino acid sequences indicates a region from residues 190-218 (29 amino acids) in the 0 reading frame that contains 7 cysteine residues, whereas the +1 reading frame only contains 1 cysteine at residue 357. Conversely, the +1 reading frame contains 6 methionine residues, whereas the 0 reading frame contains only one methionine, in addition to the initiation methionine.",

            "text": "To define the regions of the nucleotide s e q u e n c e encoding the P and V proteins, we used the approach of making synthetic m R N A transcripts, translating the RNAs in vitro, and immunoprecipitating the products. The complete coding regions of clone P203-1 (nucleotides 44-1285) and a fragment containing the 3' two-thirds of the gene were subcloned into the transcription vector pGEM-2 such that they were under the control of the T7 R N A polymerase promoter. A series of mRNA-sense runoff transcripts were prepared as described in Experimental Procedures, translated in vitro using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and immunoprecipitated using the group I, II, and III monoclonal an-tibodies. The results obtained from such an assay are shown in Figure 4A and summarized in schematic form in Figure 4B . Interestingly, although the P protein could be translated in vitro using poly(A)-containing mRNAs isolated from SV5 infected cells ( Figure 4A , indicated as x in lanes IV), we were unable to detect the synthesis of the P protein when in vitro runoff transcripts were used to program the cell-free translation system. However, protein V was translated from both synthetic RNAs and mRNA was isolated from infected cells ( Figure 4A , indicated as +). Originally we thought it likely that frameshifting might be involved in the synthesis of P. However, because there is no detectable synthesis of the P protein when T7 runoff transcripts are used to program the rabbit reticulocyte lysate, whereas P is translated efficiently in vitro when poly(A) containing mRNA from infected cells is used, it would seem unlikely that ribosomal frameshifting is involved in the generation of the P protein. In addition to protein V, other in vitro synthesized proteins were observed, particularly during translation of the 3' two-thirds of the gene. The apparent size of the additional proteins is consistent with initiation of protein synthesis occurring at internal AUG codons in the +1 open reading frame: methionines 183 ( Figure 4A , closed circle), 233 ( Figure 4A , 1--*), and 277 ( Figure 4A, 2~) . From the sizes of the different protein products derived from the various runoff transcripts, it was possible to map unambiguously the regions on the open reading frames that were recognized by the monoclonal antibodies. In this way, monoclonal antibodies from group I were found to recognize the N-terminal region of the 0 open reading frame, group II antibodies to recognize a region from the N terminus of the +1 open reading frame, and group ill antibodies to recognize a C-terminal region of the +1 open reading frame.",

With each fragment, two nuclease $1 protected labeled fragments were detected, the full-length fragment used as a probe corresponding to a colinear mRNA transcript, and a smaller fragment present in 10%-20% abundance (data not shown). These data suggest that a second mRNA species exists that is derived from the P and V gene on the SV5 virion RNA and that it has a nuclease $1 sensitive site approximately between nucleotides 530 and 560. To define the location of this site more accurately, two shorter DNA fragments were used for the nuclease $1 analysis.

Although the simplest explanation of the nuclease $1 mapping data was that the P mRNA was a noncolinear transcript of the P and V gene containing an 18 nucleotide interrupted region, our retrospective explanation for the data is that nuclease $1 recognized a two nucleotide mismatch. The 3' break point maps precisely to the 4 G region in the V cDNA clone, while the 5' site did not. In addition to the inherent inaccuracies in measuring the precise size of DNA fragments, it is noted that the region 5' to the 4 G residues at nucleotides 548-551 is AT-rich and it may have been sensitive to digestion by the nuclease $1 (Hansen et al., 1981) .

With the aid of the computer program FOLD (Intelligenetics Inc., Palo Alto, CA), the most stable secondary structure that can be predicted for nucleotides 520-620 of the P and V gene is one with an energy of \u2022G = -53.7 kcal/mol and has the four templated C residues (nucleotides 548-551) immediately after a base-paired stem region (Figure 9 ). The Klenow fragment of E. coil DNA polymerase often yields artifactual sequencing bands at a run of several G residues when directly sequencing double-stranded DNA using the dideoxy chain-terminating method. As shown in Figure 9 the sequence of nucleotides 548-551 in the V clone (4 G residues) is easier to interpret than nucleotides 548-553 in the P clone (6 G residues). These artifactual bands can be eliminated when the sequencing is performed with a modified form of T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase TM) in conjunction with dlTP instead of dGTP, unless there is a strong secondary structure in the template strand and then the artifacts are exacerbated (Tabor, 1987) . When this was done for the P clone DNA ( Left: The SV5 virion RNA sequence from nucleotides 520-620 of the P/V gene was examined for regions of strong secondary structure with the aid of the computer program FOLD (Inteiligenetics Inc., Pals Alto, CA).

In the Sequenase reactions (T7) dlTP was used in place of the usual dGTP.

            "text": "We have obtained the nucleotide sequence of the paramyxovirus SV5 P and V gene and have determined the strategy by which both proteins are expressed by a single gene. The P and V proteins are translated from two independent mRNAs that are synthesized in SV5 infected cells and are found to differ by the presence in the P mRNA of two additional nucleotides. A comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the P and V cDNAs and the SV5 genomic vRNA showed that the two additional G residues present in the P mRNA are not templated by the SV5 virion RNA (Figure 7 ). It could be argued that the vRNA sequencing might not detect a minor vRNA species of less than 5% abundance. However, there is no biological evidence for the involvement of more than one virus genome in the SV5 infectious cycle. Using a combination of in vitro translation of T7 runoff transcripts, immunoprecipitation of the in vitro synthesized proteins using monoclonal antibodies, oligonuc!eotide-directed mutagenesis, and metabolic labeling of SV5 infected cell proteins using specific amino acids ([35S]methionine or [35S]cysteine), we have shown that P and V are amino coterminal proteins that have different C-termini. The results presented here confirm earlier observations that the P and V proteins of SV5 have tryptic peptides in common (Paterson et al., 1984) . Thus SV5 differs from many paramyxoviruses and morbilliviruses that use functionally bicistronic mRNAs to synthesize the P protein, and a second protein known as C from overlapping reading frames (Giorgi et al., 1983; Galinski, et al., 1986; Bellini et al., 1985; Barrett et al., 1985) . Early peptide mapping data obtained for the P and \"C-like\" proteins of two other paramyxoviruses, Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and mumps virus, suggested that both proteins are encoded by the same reading frame (Collins et al., 1982; Herrler and Compans, 1982) . Recently the NDV and mumps virus P genes have been sequenced and found to contain one open reading frame (Sato et al., 1987; McGinnes et al., 1988; Takeuchi et al., 1988) from which it has been suggested that both the P and \"C-like\" proteins are derived, with the \"C-like\" protein arising from initiation at an internal AUG codon (McGinnes et al., 1988) . SV5 is therefore seemingly unique among paramyxoviruses in having two mRNAs transcribed from the P gene. The RNA-dependent RNA poiymerase of negative strand RNA viruses functions as part of a transcriptase complex composed of the template vRNA in tight association with the nucleoprotein (NP), and the P and L proteins, which are thought to be responsible for the polymerase activity (Buetti and Choppin, 1977; Hamaguchi et al., 1983) . Transcription of the virus-specific mRNAs by the transcriptase complex is believed to occur entirely in the cytoplasm of infected cells and is independent of host-cell mRNA synthesis.",

            "text": "The mechanism responsible for the addition of the untemplated G residues present in the P mRNA is unknown, nor is it known whether it is a cotranscriptional or posttranscriptional process. However, the virus-encoded RNA polymerase of negative strand RNA viruses is also responsible for the polyadenylation of virus-specific mRNAs, a process that is thought to occur by a \"slippage\" or \"stuttering\" mechanism involving the reiterative copying by the polymerase of a stretch of U residues located at the end of each gene. As the nontemplated G residues are added to the P transcript at a position where the template vRNA has a run of four C residues, it is possible that the SV5 polymerase \"stutters\" while copying this region of the genome and thus adds the nontemplated nucleotides. It is interesting that immediately upstream of the four C residues on the $V5 genomic RNA is the sequence The published nucleotide sequences of the P genes of several paramyxoviruses and the morbilivirus, measles virus, were translated in all three reading frames. In each case of a reading frame overlapping that for the P protein a cysteine-rich region was identified and is listed in the single letter amino acid code. Only the region of significant conservation of sequence is shown with its corresponding nucleotide number; the N-terminal region of the open reading frame is omitted. The star at the end of the amino acid sequence represents a translation termination codon. The boxes identify positions where three or more amino acids have been conserved in all six viruses, A dash indicates that a gap was placed in the alignment, and the star above the sequences shows the seven conserved cysteine residues. Sources for the P gene nucleotide sequences are as follows: SV5, this publication; mumps virus, Takeuchi et al., 1988; NDV, Sato et al., 1987; Sendai virus, Shioda et al., 1983 and Giorgi et al., 1983;  parainfluenza virus 3 (PI-3), Galinski et al., 1986, and Luk et al., 1986; measles virus, Bellini et al., 1985. 3'-AAAAUUCU-5' (Figure 9 ), which resembles the putative polyadenylation signal found at the end of SV5 genes and in fact is identical to the sequence at the end of the SV5 HN gene (Hiebert et al., 1985) , making this an attractive model for the mechanism by which the nontemplated Gs are added. However, it cannot be ruled out that the nontemplated G residues in the P mRNA are added as a consequence of some form of RNA-editing analogous to that found in mitochondrial transcripts in trypanosomes (Benne et al., 1986; Feagin et al., 1987 Feagin et al., , 1988 Shaw et al., 1988) or the mammalian apolipoprotein-B mRNA (Powell et al., 1987; Chen et al., 1987) . While screening the SV5 cDNA library for a P cDNA, 22 clones were sequenced across the region described above and only clones with either four or six G residues were found. This would suggest that whatever the mechanism involved in the addition of the nontemplated G residues, it is extremely specific. With the aid of the computer algorithm FOLD, a region of secondary structure was predicted for this part of the template RNA and it is therefore possible that this could play a role in either the mechanism itself or its regulation (Figure 9 ).",

            "text": "An examination of the predicted amino acid sequences of the P and V proteins reveals several interesting features. As mentioned above, the P and V proteins are amino coterminal and have their first 164 residues in common (Figure 1 ). An unusual feature of the shared region is the large number of proline residues; 17 prolines in 164 amino acids (Figure 1) . However, the most striking characteristic observed in either protein is the C-terminal portion of protein V, which consists of a cysteine-rich region bearing a remarkable resemblance to cysteine-rich regions found in the adenovirus E1A protein (for review see Moran and Matthews, 1987) , the yeast transcription factor GAL4 (Johnston and Dover, 1987) , and proteins belonging to the steroid hormone receptor superfamily (for review see Evans, 1988) . In these proteins and others possessing a similar domain it is thought that the binding of metal ions by the cysteine-rich region plays an important role in either the binding of nucleic acid by the protein, mediat-ing protein-protein interactions, or stabilizing oligomeric forms of a protein, as in the Tat protein of human immunodeficiency virus (Frankel et al., 1988) . Because of the significance of the cysteine-rich regions in other proteins, it was of interest to determine whether the sequence identified here in protein V had been conserved among other paramyxovirus P genes. Consequently, we compared the cysteine-rich region from protein V with the protein sequences predicted in all three reading frames from the nucleotide sequence of the P genes from mumps virus, NDV, Sendai virus, parainfluenza virus 3, and measles virus (Takeuchi et al., 1988; Sato et al., 1987; McGinnes et al., 1988; Shioda et al., 1983; Giorgio et al., 1983; Galinski et al., 1986; Luk et al., 1986; Bellini et al., 1985) . As shown in Figure 10 , a highly conserved cysteine-rich region was identified in an open reading frame in all the different paramyxovirus P gene sequences examined. Interestingly, the cysteine-rich region is more conserved between the different paramyxoviruses than is the amino acid sequence of the P protein encoded by the same nucleotides but translated in another reading frame (data not shown). As the P protein is part of the paramyxovirus transcriptase complex, the conservation of the cysteine-rich region must have important biological significance. It will be important to determine whether a protein containing this cysteine-rich region is synthesized in cells infected with other paramyxoviruses in addition to the already identified P or P and C proteins derived from the \"P\" gene.",
