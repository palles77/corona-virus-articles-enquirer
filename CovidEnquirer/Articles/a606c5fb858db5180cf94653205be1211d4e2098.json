            "text": "I nfectious diseases lead to about 14 million human deaths annually. These maladies are caused by six types of pathogens: extracellular bacteria, intracellular bacteria, viruses, parasites, fungi and prions. Bacteria are microscopic, single-celled, prokaryotic organisms. Extracellular bacteria do not have to enter host cells to reproduce, whereas intracellular bacteria do. Viruses are submicroscopic, acellular particles that consist of a protein coat surrounding an RNA or DNA genome. To propagate, a virus must enter a host cell and exploit its protein synthesis machinery. Parasites are eukaryotic organisms that take advantage of a host for habitat and nutrition at some point in their life cycles. Parasites often damage a host but kill it only slowly. Parasites may be tiny, single-celled protozoans; large, multicellular helminth worms; or arthropod ectoparasites. Fungi are eukaryotic organisms that can exist comfortably outside a host but will invade and colonize that host if given the opportunity. Fungi may be single-celled or multicellular. Prions are infectious proteins that cause neurological disease by altering normal proteins in the brain of the infected host.",

What follows is a biological \"horse race\" in which the pathogen tries to replicate and expand its niche, while the immune system tries to eliminate the pathogen (or at least confine it). Only if the replication of the pathogen results in detectable clinical damage does the host experience \"disease.\" Microbial toxins released by a pathogen can cause disease even in the absence of widespread colonization. Immunopathic damage may occur if host tissues are unintentionally injured by the immune response as it strives to destroy a pathogen. As detailed in Sections A-G that follow, the innate and adaptive effector mechanisms best suited to countering a particular pathogen are determined by the invader's lifestyle and mode of replication.

The first obstacles encountered by an invader are the intact skin and mucosae. Pathogens are prevented from gaining a firm foothold on the skin by the toughness and routine shedding of the keratin layers protecting the epidermis, and also by having to compete with commensal microorganisms. Pathogens ingested into the gut or inhaled into the respiratory tract are trapped by mucus or succumb to microbicidal molecules in the body secretions or to the low pH and hydrolases of the gut. However, a breach of the skin or mucosae may allow a pathogen access to subepithelial tissues. Barrier penetration may also occur in individuals whose immune systems have been compromised by either disease or therapeutic immunosuppression. These lapses in immune defense may allow opportunistic pathogens, which are normally harmless to a healthy individual, to cause disease. In contrast, invasive pathogens can enter the body even when surface defenses are intact. Invasive organisms assaulting the mucosae frequently gain access via the M cells of the FAE or by binding to host cell surface molecules that initiate receptor-mediated internalization.",

Coating of the pathogen by C3b or MBL facilitates its elimination by the alternative or lectin complement cascades, respectively. At a cellular level, general innate defense is mediated by the PRRs of resident DCs, neutrophils and other granulocytes, macrophages, NK cells, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and NKT cells. These PRRs include TLRs, NLRs, RLRs, CLRs, scavenger receptors, and cell-bound collectins, as well as the antigen recognition receptors of NK, NKT and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. In addition, soluble collectins in the extracellular matrix that have bound to pathogens or their products may activate complement or stimulate phagocytosis. NOTE: Although patients go to hospitals to be cured, about 5% of them will acquire an infection after admission, and about 5% of these individuals will die of these infections. Indeed, in the USA and Europe, nosocomial (hospital-acquired) infections are the sixth leading cause of death. In both jurisdictions, billions are spent every year to deal with this problem, even though an estimated one-third of these infections are preventable. Gram-negative bacteria are often the culprits, and pneumonia is the most common life-threatening clinical consequence. Infections of the bloodstream, urinary tract, and surgical sites are also frequent. Individuals who are immunosuppressed are particularly vulnerable to hospital-acquired infections and may succumb to organisms that would otherwise be successfully repelled. Such individuals include cancer patients treated with chemotherapy or radiation, and transplant patients taking medications designed to suppress their immune systems and prevent transplant rejection.",

Viral PAMPs (such as those derived from influenza virus), parasite PAMPs (such as those derived from Schistosoma mansoni or Plasmodia falciparum), or fungal PAMPs (such as those derived from Candida albicans) may also induce NLRP3 formation. The PAMPs in these cases include bacterial toxins, viral ssRNA or dsRNA, fungal cell wall components, or parasite egg antigens. NLRC4 inflammasomes also respond to PAMPs from Salmonella, Legionella or Pseudomonas species. NLRP1 inflammasomes are activated by a toxin of Bacillus anthracis and have been implicated in combatting some herpesvirus infections.",

In contrast, damage to a host caused by an endotoxin is always immunopathic. The LPS of Gram-negative bacteria activates macrophages and induces them to release pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly TNF and IL-1.

Polysaccharides present in bacterial cell walls make perfect Ti antigens for B cell activation ( Fig. 13-1, #1) , while other bacterial components supplying Td antigens induce primarily a Th2 response that provides T help for antibacterial B cells (#2). Neutralizing IgM antibodies dominate in the vascular system, while smaller IgG antibodies protect the tissues. These antibodies neutralize bacteria by physically preventing them from attaching to host cell surfaces (#3). Even though they do not need to enter host cells for replication, most extracellular bacteria try to adhere to host cells to avoid being swept off or out of the host by skin sloughing or movement of the intestinal contents. Antibodies can also serve as opsonins, coating the bacterium such that it is engulfed by phagocytic leukocytes expressing FcRs (#4). Once captured inside the phagocyte, extracellular bacteria are usually very vulnerable to killing via pH changes, defensins, and the ROIs and RNIs associated with the phagosomal respiratory burst. Antibodies made against bacterial exotoxins are called antitoxins. Antitoxins neutralize a toxin by preventing it from binding to the cells it would otherwise damage (#5).

Any Th0 cell interacting with such a DC is then directed to undergo Th17 cell differentiation.

The inner layer of a granuloma contains macrophages and CD4 + T cells, whereas the exterior layer is composed of CD8 + T cells. Eventually, the granuloma exterior becomes calcified and fibrotic, and cells in the center undergo necrosis. In some cases, all the pathogens trapped in the dying cells are killed, and the infection is resolved. In other cases, a few pathogens remain viable but dormant within the granuloma, causing it to persist. Granuloma persistence is an overt sign that the disease is becoming chronic. If the granuloma breaks down, the trapped pathogens are released back into the body to resume replication. Should the host be immunosuppressed and unable to marshal the T cells and macrophages necessary to fight this fresh assault, the pathogen may reach the blood. As the bacteria travel in the circulation, they can infect organs throughout the body and even precipitate death. Cytokines play a critical role in granuloma formation. IL-17 production by Th17 cells is required for Th1 effector recruitment and the stimulation of IL-12 production by macrophages. Sustained IFN\u03b3 production by Th1 cells and CTLs is needed to maintain macrophage hyperactivation. TNF production by hyperactivated macrophages is crucial not only for early chemokine synthesis (to recruit leukocytes to the incipient granuloma) but also for aggregating these cells and establishing the \"wall\" around the invaders. IL-4 and IL-10 secreted by Th2 cells late in an adaptive response control granuloma formation, damping it down as the bacterial threat is contained. Recent work has shown that TLR signaling also influences granuloma formation and thus the The importance of the Th1 response to defense against intracellular pathogens is clearly illustrated in human immunity to Mycobacterium leprae infection. Individuals who are predisposed to mounting Th2 responses (i.e., their Th cells preferentially secrete IL-4 and IL-10) and are infected with M. leprae suffer from a devastating form of leprosy known as lepromatous leprosy. The DCs in the epidermis and dermis of these patients exhibit reduced expression of the costimulatory molecule B7, which further compromises the effectiveness of the T cell response. In contrast, individuals who usually mount Th1 responses (i.e., their Th cells preferentially secrete IFN\u03b3) and are infected with M. leprae present with tuberculoid leprosy, which is generally a less severe form of the disease. The cell-mediated immunity favored by a Th1 response is clearly more effective against this intracellular pathogen than the Th2 response that promotes humoral immunity.",

A heterodimer of TLR1/TLR2 forms a PRR that recognizes a lipoprotein of M. leprae. Engagement of this TLR1/TLR2 complex normally results in leukocyte production of IL-2, IL-12, TNF and IFN\u03b3, which influence nearby DCs to induce Th1 differentiation. In the absence of normal TLR1/TLR2 signaling, however, the leukocytes tend to produce IL-10, which induces DCs to promote Th2 differentiation.

For example, M. leprae infects the Schwann cells of the human peripheral nervous system. Other intracellular bacteria deliberately enter phagocytes but then inactivate them or take steps to escape phagosomal killing. For example, L. monocytogenes accesses mouse phagocytes via host FcRs and CRs but then synthesizes a protein called listeriolysin O (LLO) that induces pore formation in the phagolysosomal membrane. The bacterium escapes through the pore into the relative safety of the cytoplasm. B. pertussis expresses a surface receptor that binds to a glycoprotein found primarily on phagocytes, promoting deliberate engulfment of the bacterium. Once inside the phagocyte, B. pertussis neutralizes the respiratory burst and inhibits other bactericidal activities, allowing the pathogen to persist within the host cell. When M. tuberculosis finds itself being engulfed in a macrophage phagosome, it recruits to the phagosome a host protein called TACO that inhibits the fusion of the phagosome to lysosomes. M. tuberculosis also produces NH 4 + , which reverses the acidification of phagolysosomes and promotes fusion with harmless endosomes. In addition, M. tuberculosis infection interferes with the expression of host genes needed for microbicidal action and macrophage hyperactivation. As a result of all these measures, Mycobacteria can survive within host phagosomes for long periods. Certain Salmonella species produce molecules that decrease the recruitment of NADPH oxidase to the phagolysosome, inhibiting ROI and RNI generation.

Replication of the viral genome and synthesis of viral mRNAs follow, which may be carried out by host or viral enzymes, depending on the virus. However, all viruses lack protein synthesis machinery and rely on the host cell for viral protein translation and progeny virion assembly. Progeny virions released from an infected cell attack neighboring host cells and initiate new replicative cycles that lead to widespread dissemination of the virus. Progeny virions that reach the blood are free to spread systemically. Examples of diseases caused by viruses are given in Table 13 -5. Viruses cause disease both directly and indirectly. Viruses frequently kill or at least inactivate host cells, depriving the host of these cells' normal functions such that clinical symptoms appear. As well, the immune response to the viral infection frequently damages host tissues and induces inflammation, causing immunopathic disease. Clinicians classify diseases caused by viruses as either acute or chronic. When a host is initially infected with a virus, the host experiences acute disease in that the illness may be mild or severe (depending on the degree of pathogenicity or virulence of the virus) but is only short term in duration. An effective immune response removes the virus completely from the body. However, sometimes viruses are not completely eliminated during the acute infection and remain in the body to establish persistent infections. The ongoing low levels of viral replication associated with these persistent infections cause long-term or recurrent illnesses that are considered chronic diseases. In some cases, a host will experience no chronic disease symptoms at all if his/her cell-mediated immune response is effective enough to block the assembly of new virus particles.

With the appropriate T cell help, these B cells are activated and generate plasma cells and memory B cells that are usually vital for complete resolution of the infection. Late in the primary response, neutralizing antibodies are released into the circulation and block further spread of the virus. As well, in a subsequent attack, the virus will have a harder time infecting the host because the circulating neutralizing antibodies rapidly bind to the virus and bar its access to host cell receptors. Antiviral antibodies may also initiate classical complement activation. The formation of the MAC on the surface of an enveloped virus or an infected host cell kills it, and the complement components that are produced during the cascade may opsonize extracellular virions and promote their uptake by phagocytosis ( Fig. 13-3, #6) . The antiviral antibodies themselves may also serve as opsonins. Finally, antibodies that have recognized viral antigens on infected host cell surfaces may engage FcRs on phagocytes and other leukocytes (particularly NK cells) and provoke ADCC.

When a virus adopts a latent state, it persists in the host cell in a defective form that renders it non-infectious for a period of time. In most cases, latency involves the inactivation of viral gene transcription needed for productive infection and the subsequent expression of new viral transcripts required for latency. Reversal from latency back to productive infection requires some type of reactivation of the productive infection genes that can occur only when the host's immune system has weakened. Different viruses achieve latency in different ways. HIV integrates a cDNA copy of its RNA genome into the DNA of its host cell in such a way that there is limited transcription of viral genes. The DNA genomes of VZV and HSV do not integrate into the host DNA but instead form a complex with host nucleosomal proteins that block transcription of productive infection genes. A similar latency mechanism operates in cases of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) infection. However, the latency of these viruses is associated with the development of tumors in the host: B cell lymphomas and nasopharyngeal carcinomas in the case of EBV, and the AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma in the case of KSHV.",

This mechanism is most effective in long-lived hosts (like humans) that can sustain multiple re-infections, and is particularly important if the virus lacks the ability to become latent. The rapid modification of viral antigens through random mutations is known as antigenic drift. For example, like all RNA viruses, influenza virus cannot proofread its RNA genome during replication and thus sustains a high rate of mutation. The hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) proteins, which are the only two viral proteins present on the surface of the influenza virion, are thus subtly different from viral generation to generation. These minor virus variants often replicate preferentially in the host, because they are not neutralized by antibodies raised against earlier strains. New influenza strains created by antigenic drift are responsible for localized influenza outbreaks. HIV is another virus that undergoes very rapid antigenic drift, even within a single infected individual. In this case, the mutations arise due to the highly error-prone reverse transcriptase involved in the replication of the HIV genome.",

CMV and VSV infect cells that normally have very low MHC class I expression. CMV also expresses a protein that induces deglycosylation and degradation of newly synthesized MHC class I chains. A different CMV protein associates with mature peptide-MHC class I structures that do make it to the cell surface and blocks recognition by CD8 + T cells. EBV produces viral proteins that resist proteolysis, meaning that peptides capable of fitting into the MHC binding groove are not easily generated. EBV also downregulates the expression of the TAP antigen transporter and so reduces peptide loading. Herpesviruses express small proteins that interfere with peptide binding to TAP on the cytosolic side of the ER. Other viruses express proteins that allow the peptide to bind to TAP but then trap the complex on the luminal side of the ER. HIV produces a multifunctional protein called Nef that is able to bind simultaneously to host clathrin proteins and the cytoplasmic tails of MHC class I molecules on the surface of the host cell. This Nef-mediated physical connection between MHC class I and clathrin forces the internalization and lysosomal degradation of the MHC class I molecule. The antigenic drift that routinely generates a new influenza virus every year is usually responsible for 3-5 million cases of severe illness worldwide and 250,000-500,000 deaths. In contrast, antigenic shifts are responsible for much more serious pandemics, as exemplified by three widespread influenza outbreaks in 1918 (H1N1), 1957 (H2N2), and 1968 (H3N2) that caused tens of millions of deaths around the globe. In this century, a global pandemic of H1N1 influenza began in April 2009. Although the exact series of genetic re-assortment events that led to the emergence of the 2009 H1N1 subtype remains undefined, it is clear that a progeny virus emerged with a hemagglutinin protein to which much of the human population was immunologically na\u00efve. This antigenic shift combined with modern air travel allowed the novel influenza virus subtype to spread very rapidly and efficiently around the world. The potential severity of the situation caused the World Health Organization to issue a global alert, stating that the event was a \"Public Health Emergency of International Concern.\" Fortunately, the mortality associated with this outbreak was far less than in previous pandemics, with global fatalities estimated in the tens of thousands rather than millions. Significantly, older individuals who had survived one or more of the 20th century pandemics appeared to be immune or at least somewhat resistant to the 2009 H1N1 virus. The mechanism mediating this type of cross-subtype protection after an antigenic shift is not well understood. Some immunologists believe that previous infection with the 1918 virus (for example) may have invoked some degree of long-lived protection based on immune responses to more highly conserved proteins in the virus core, such as the viral nucleoprotein or matrix protein. This hypothesis remains under investigation.",

Other viruses express proteins that bind to MHC class II molecules and target them for proteasomal degradation. Still other viruses interfere with MHC class II presentation after the MHC molecule has entered the endocytic system. For example, a CMV protein competes with invariant chain for binding to MHC class II, and certain HPV proteins and the HIV Nef protein disrupt the acidification of the endosomal compartments necessary for peptide generation.

Viruses therefore seek to inhibit the production or action of these molecules, or their receptors. Some pox viruses alter the local cytokine milieu and make it less favorable to the cellular co operation that underpins an immune response. Both KSHV and adenovirus express proteins that inhibit IFN-inducible gene transcription, whereas certain poxviruses express a protein that blocks IL-1 production. Herpesviruses downregulate cytokine receptor expression, and CMV disrupts the transcription of chemokine genes. Vaccinia virus secretes IFN receptor homologs that intercept IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 molecules. Poxviruses synthesize a chemokine homolog that binds to chemokine receptors on host cells but blocks the chemotaxis of lymphocytes, macrophages and neutrophils. Inhibition of IL-12 production is a major goal of many viruses since this cytokine is crucial for Th1 differentiation and thus the antiviral cell-mediated immune response.",

Some miRNAs inhibit the expression by infected host cells of viral proteins that furnish immunodominant epitopes. Without presentation of these viral epitopes, CTLs cannot recognize infected host cells and do not kill them, allowing the virus to persist. Similarly, other miRNAs block the expression of the NK activatory ligand MICB by an infected host cell. In the absence of the MICB molecules needed to bind to the NK activatory receptor NKG2D, the NK cell may not receive sufficient activatory signaling to overcome NK inhibitory signaling; the infected host cell is spared. Still other viral miRNAs regulate the activities of innate and adaptive leukocytes by inducing or suppressing host cell expression of various cytokines and chemokines. For example, viral miRNAs may block host cell production of the chemokines IL-8, MCP-1 and/or CXCL11, preventing the recruitment of neutrophils, macrophages and activated T cells that could eliminate the threat. Other viral miRNAs block the expression of molecules that repress IL-10 synthesis, promoting the production of this immunosuppressive cytokine. Similarly, viral miRNAs that inhibit the expression of molecules blocking IL-6 expression have the effect of promoting regulatory T cell differentiation and thus the downregulation of antiviral T cell responses. Over 200 immunomodulatory viral miRNAs have been identified to date and more are emerging daily.",

These scourges claim millions of lives every year, particularly in developing countries. Some protozoans replicate extracellularly, whereas others replicate intracellularly. Helminth worms reproduce inside a host's body but outside its cells, or outside the host entirely in a location (like a water source) where access to a host is easy. Growth and maturation of the worm then occur within the host, often causing severe and long-term damage to tissues and organs. Some ectoparasites complete their entire life cycle on the host surface, whereas others attach only to feed and then detach.

For example, humans naturally resistant to S. mansonii express high levels of Th2 cytokines, whereas individuals susceptible to this worm exhibit increased concentrations of Th1 cytokines. The antihelminth Th2 response involves IgE, mast cells, basophils and eosinophils, a combination that does not contribute significantly to defense against any other type of pathogen. Activated CD4 + T cells are also critical for antihelminth defense because these cells differentiate into effectors supplying the Th2 cytokines and CD40L contacts required for isotype switching to IgE by B cells (Fig. 13-5, #1) . The antiparasite IgE antibodies synthesized by the B cells enter the circulation and \"arm\" mast cells and basophils by binding to cell surface Fc\u03b5RI. When a worm antigen engages the cell-bound IgE, the degranulation of the mast cells and basophils is triggered in close proximity to the parasite (#2). Histamine released by the mast cells and basophils causes the contraction of host intestinal and bronchial smooth muscles such that the parasite is shaken loose from its grip on the mucosal surface and expelled from the body. Histamine and other proteins synthesized by mast cells and basophils are also directly toxic to some helminth parasites. In addition, the vasodilation and increased vascular permeability induced by histamine allow an influx of leukocytes and circulating antibodies into the area. Circulating IgE directed against worm surface molecules may bind directly to the pathogen, attracting the attention of eosinophils expressing Fc\u03b5RI molecules. The binding of the worm-bound IgE to eosinophil Fc\u03b5Rs triggers eosinophil degranulation and the release of substances that work directly and indirectly to kill the worm (#3). Some molecules degrade the skin of the worm, allowing neutrophils and other leukocytes to penetrate into its underlying tissues. These cells may also degranulate and release additional toxic proteins and peptides that kill the worm. Other molecules contained in eosinophil granules stimulate mast cells to degranulate.",

Dimorphic fungi adopt a unicellular form at one stage in their life cycle and a multicellular form at another stage. Conidia are haploid, non-motile fungal spores that are formed under unfavorable nutrient conditions. All fungal cells have a cell wall like bacteria but also a cell membrane like mammalian cells. Although many fungi live most of their lives in the soil, some live commensally on the topologically external surfaces of the human body. Some fungi are dermatophytes, filamentous fungi that infect only the skin, hair and nails. Most fungal species are not harmful to healthy humans, but when a fungus succeeds in invading the body, it usually heads for the vascular system of the target tissue. Invasion of blood vessels by a growing fungus can choke off the blood supply to the host's organs.",

All these procedures call for or result in suppression of the patient's immune system, so that fungi which would normally not succeed in establishing an infection are able to do so; that is, the patients contract opportunistic infections. In particular, species of Aspergillus, Candida and Cryptococcus fungi have become prominent threats to immunocompromised individuals. Patients may also present with infections by one of the Mucormycotina group of filamentous fungi, which launch life-threatening attacks on the brain and sinuses. Diseases caused by fungal infections are generally called mycoses, and examples of several are given in Table 13 -11. NOTE: A rising concern among clinical immunologists studying fungal infections is the projected impact of global warming. With climate change will come two potential threats to the currently balanced relationship between most fungi and their mammalian hosts. First, a warmer environment will allow new fungal species to survive in previously hostile geographic areas, increasing the number of threats faced by vulnerable individuals. Second, some researchers believe that the planet is warming faster than mammals can evolve to maintain the usual difference between their own body temperature and the generally lower temperature of their surroundings. Normally, this temperature differential contributes to the resistance of healthy mammals to most fungi. As a result, global warming may open up new colonization opportunities for fungal pathogens.",

TLR2, TLR4, DC-SIGN, Dectin-1, Dectin-2, CR3, MBL and MR all recognize PAMPs supplied by molecules in fungal cell walls or on the fungal cell surface. These PAMPs include fungal \u03b2-glucans, chitins, mannans and oligomannosides. In particular, Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 are CLRs specialized for the recognition of fungal PAMPs. Dectin-1 binds to cell wall \u03b2-glucans, whereas Dectin-2 recognizes mannose structures common to the hyphal forms (only) of many fungi. Dectin-1 contains its own ITAM in its cytoplasmic tail, whereas Dectin-2 pairs with the FcR\u03b3 signaling chain to transduce intracellular signaling. This signaling results in host cell production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and leukotrienes instrumental in removing the invader. Dectin-1 is widely expressed on DCs, monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils and some T cells. Dectin-2 expression is more restricted, being limited to monocytes and macrophages. The importance of Dectin-1 has been highlighted by recent studies of a family in Holland, some members of which lack Dectin-1 expression and suffer from recurrent fungal infections. Individuals with deficits in the expression of other C-lectin receptors are also unusually susceptible. Attack by a fungus often induces a host to assemble the NLRP3 inflammasome that drives IL-1 and IL-18 production. Host cell-derived DAMPs associated with fungal infections include the S100 proteins that bind to RAGE, a PRR introduced in Chapter 3. As was true for protozoan parasites, animals lacking expression of the TLR signaling adaptor protein MyD88 are very vulnerable to fungal infections. Neutrophils and macrophages activated by PRR engagement carry out vigorous phagocytosis and produce powerful antifungal defensins that induce osmotic imbalance in the fungal cells ( Fig. 13-6, #1) . Fungal cells may also trigger their own engulfment by some cell types that are not normally phagocytic, including epithelial and endothelial cells. As well as defensins, activated neutrophils and macrophages secrete copious quantities of chemokines along with IL-1, IL-12 and TNF, which are directly toxic to fungal cells. \u03b3\u03b4 T cells appear to play a significant role in antifungal defense at the mucosae (#2), a hypothesis based on the fact that mice engineered to lack \u03b3\u03b4 T cells show increased susceptibility to yeast infections. Activated NK cells stimulated by the presence of IL-12 contribute to fungal cell killing via TNF secretion (rather than by natural cytotoxicity) (#3). IFN\u03b3 produced by NK cells contributes to macrophage hyperactivation that can eventually lead to granuloma formation.",

DCs whose MRs and Dectin-1 molecules are engaged by fungal PAMPs are stimulated to produce IL-23 and IL-10, which initiate the generation of Th17 effectors.

Other fungi take alternative steps to obscure their PAMPs. For example, C. albicans expresses a protein that covers the \u03b2-glucan molecules in its cell wall, preventing recognition by phagocytes bearing Dectin-1. Similarly, Histoplasma capsulatum hides its \u03b2-glucan under a layer of \u03b1-glucan, which does not bind to Dectin-1. Aspergillus fumigatus covers its spores in proteins such as melanin that block recognition of the conidial surface by innate leukocytes. In contrast, Pneumocystis jiroveci simply changes the expression of its major surface glycoproteins, confounding both PRR and antibody recognition. Lastly, the cell walls and membranes of some fungi simply lack PAMPs and other structures that might trigger PRR-mediated recognition, forestalling both phagocytosis and the binding of complement components. NOTE: There is a fine balance that must be maintained during inflammatory responses to fungi to ensure host health. Acute inflammation is helpful in getting rid of the invader, but chronic inflammation that fails to clear the pathogen appears to encourage fungal persistence. Severe fungal infections can occur in patients who have started to recover function of their immune systems after immunosuppression has been used to allow transplantation, or after AIDS has been brought under control by anti-HIV drug therapy. These individuals sometimes show clinical signs of a disease labeled immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) . As the immune system starts to reconstitute itself, it mounts an excessive inflammatory response to an opportunistic pathogen such as a fungus that has taken hold during the immunosuppression. Rather than resolving the infection, this inflammation disrupts immune system regulation and compromises fungal clearance, paradoxically making the condition worse.",

In a similar vein, Cryptococcus neoformans forms very large polyploid \"titan cells\" that are encased in a thick polysaccharide capsule. The sheer size of these cells and the composition of their capsule provide a formidable barrier to phagocytosis. C. neoformans also secretes a small protein called App1 that is induced under conditions of low glucose, such as are routinely found in the lung (the primary site of attack of this pathogen). App1 interacts with CR2 and CR3 in such a way as to block macrophage phagocytosis of any fungal cells opsonized by C3d or iC3b, respectively. Even when fungal cells are engulfed by phagocytes, many of these pathogens have ways of enzymatically detoxifying the NO produced by phagocyte iNOS activity. C. albicans secretes an unknown inhibitory factor to accomplish this task, whereas C. neoformans and Blastomyces dermatitidis establish inhibitory intercellular contacts with macrophages. H. capsulatum neutralizes phagosomal killing by secreting factors that alter the phagolysosomal environment and render it non-acidic. Other fungi appear to alter intracellular endosomal trafficking such that phagosome maturation is impaired. C. neoformans has perfected a novel route that allows it to escape from macrophage phagosomes, and indeed the whole leukocyte, without damage to either cell. The fungal cell secretes molecules that weaken the membrane of a macrophage phagosome, which then fuses with the macrophage plasma membrane. The contents of the phagosome, including the fungal cell, are then expelled from the macrophage into the extracellular milieu by exocytosis.

As defined in Chapter 6, the varying nucleotide sequences of alleles of the same gene are known as polymorphisms. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are alleles that differ from the cognate gene by one nucleotide. It is estimated that there are \u223c10 million SNPs in the human genome. An SNP may affect the rate of transcription or translation of the resulting protein product, its amino acid sequence, its stability and half-life, its interaction with receptors, and/or its function. For example, a particular TLR4 SNP is associated with an increased risk of endotoxic shock following infection by Gramnegative bacteria, while a certain TLR2 SNP renders individuals highly susceptible to endotoxic shock following infection by Gram-positive bacteria. A database of defined human SNPs is maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP so that medical scientists can easily access this growing resource.",
