The fluorescence (Ex/Em=320 nm/420 nm) of each sample is quantified every 8 min for up to 120 min by a 96-well microplate fluorescence reader. Change in relative fluorescence units over time is converted to the amount of 4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (MCA) released per minute using a standard curve generated by measuring the endpoint fluorescence (Ex/Em =320/420 nm) of known concentrations of a MCA standard solution ranging from 0 to 250 pmol/well of MCA. One mU of ACE2 activity is defined as the release of 1 pmol of MCA from the substrate per min.",

Equilibrated plasma samples were further spiked with stable isotope-labeled internal standards for each AP at a concentration of 200 pg/ml. The samples then underwent C-18-based solid-phase-extraction and were subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis using a reversedphase analytical column operating in line with a Xevo TQ-S triple quadruple mass spectrometer (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA). Internal standards were used to correct for peptide recovery of the sample preparation procedure for each AP in each individual sample. Analyte concentrations were reported in pg/ml and were calculated considering the corresponding response factors determined in appropriate calibration curves in original sample matrix, on condition that integrated signals exceeded a signal-to-noise ratio of 10.
