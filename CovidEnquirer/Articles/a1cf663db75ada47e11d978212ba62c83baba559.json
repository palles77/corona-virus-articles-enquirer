            "text": "Twenty-seven strains of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were isolated from dead or diseased chickens at different chicken farms in South China during 2004-2008, of which the S1 gene was sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene sequences of the isolated 27 strains together with 29 strains published in Genbank revealed that all IBV strains except for one isolated and one published were clustered into six distinct genotypes I-VI. 26 isolated strains belong to genotypes I, II, and III, forming a big phylogenetic branch without new predominant strains, whereas all five vaccine strains belong to genotype V that is evolutionarily distant from genotypes I, II, and III. The study of the protease cleavage motif within the S1 protein found 12 different cleavage motifs, of which 3 motifs are shared by both isolated and published strains, 2 motifs unique to isolated strains, and 7 motifs unique to published strains, further bolstering the notion of no new predominant strains. Alignment analysis of the S1 amino acid sequences indicated that the amino acid substitutions, insertions, and deletions are polymorphic and diverse, showing no sign of predominant genetic changes among the isolated strains. Taken together, there was no predominant new strain circulating in South China during 2004-2008. Nonetheless, circulating IBV strains have been continuously evolving with genetic compositions distant from vaccine strains; this explains why there have been constant but infrequent outbreaks in commercial flocks in South China during 2004-2008. Furthermore, in order to safe guard against the sudden emergence of new predominant strains, continuing surveillance of IBV strains circulating in the field is of extreme importance. \u00df",

            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a member of the Coronaviridae (order Nidovirales, genus Coronavirus) family, is a highly infectious and contagious pathogen of domestic fowl, replicating primarily in the respiratory tract but also in some epithelial cells of the gut, kidney, and oviduct (Cavanagh, 2001; Cavanagh and Naqi, 2003; Cook et al., 2001) . IBV genome consists of a single-stranded sense RNA encoding four structural proteins, envelope (E) glycoprotein, integral membrane (M) glycoprotein, phosphorylated nucleocapsid (N) protein, and spike (S) glycoprotein (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997; Stern and Sefton, 1982) . S glycoprotein is posttranslationally cleaved into amino-terminal S1 (535 amino acids; 90-kDa) and carboxyl-terminal S2 (627 amino acids; 84-kDa) subunits by cellular proteases (Cavanagh et al., 1986b) ; S1 forms a receptor-binding site whereas S2 anchors S1 to the viral membrane. The protease cleavage site is usually associated with one or more pairs of basic amino acids (e.g., Arg-Arg-Ser-Arg-Arg) . S1 protein involves in infectivity, contains virusneutralizing epitopes, serotype-specific sequences, and hemagglutinin activity (Cavanagh, 1983; Cavanagh and Davis, 1986; Cavanagh et al., 1986a; Karaca et al., 1992; Koch et al., 1990) , and plays a major role in the tissue tropism and the induction of protective immunity (Cavanagh et al., 1988 . As the most variable protein, S1 protein sequences from different strains vary significantly, usually by between 2 and 25% at the amino acid level (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997) . Various serotypes are believed to be generated by nucleotide insertions, deletions, point mutations, and/or RNA recombinations in S1 subunit (Jia et al., 1995; Kusters et al., 1987; Wang et al., 1993 Wang et al., , 1994 . The mutations in the N-terminal amino acids of S1 subunit directly lead to emergence of new serotypes and change of tissue tropism (Casais et al., 2003; Cavanagh et al., 1986a; Stern and Sefton, 1982) . Certain studies indicated that IBV immunity was serotype-specific, small differences in S1 contributing to poor cross-protection (Cavanagh and Davis, 1986; Cavanagh et al., 1997; Gelb et al., 1997; Wang et al., 1994) and vaccine failures (Jia et al., 1996) , while some groups reported that crossprotection could be provided by appropriate vaccine programmes against genetically or antigenically unrelated IBVs (Gelb et al., 2005; Cook et al., 1999) . S1 gene sequence was reported as a good predictor of challenge of immunity in chickens (Ladman et al., 2006) , the genetic analyses of IBV strains have been mainly focused on the S1 gene (Cavanagh et al., 1986b McFarlane and Verma, 2008) .",

Vaccines based on Massachusetts (Mass) serotype strains such as H120 and H52 have been used for many years worldwide (Hofstad, 1981) . Moreover, various live or inactivated vaccines based on Mass serotype strains have been used for control of IBV infections in China. Vaccines have been generally effective, but new strains continue to emerge and cause clinical disease and production problems in vaccinated flocks (Bijlenga et al., 2004; Gelb et al., 2005; Nix et al., 2000) . For example, based on neutralization test and the immune protection test, A2 strain is closely related to 4/ 91 serotype, spreading over Europe since its first isolation in UK in 1991 (Capua et al., 1999; Cavanagh et al., 2005; Cook et al., 1996; Gough et al., 1992; Liu et al., 2009b; Meulemans et al., 2001; Parsons et al., 1992; Xu et al., 2007; Zhao and Qin, 2002) . QXIBV, a new IBV variant reported in China in 2004 , had become widespread in several countries in Europe (Terregino et al., 2008; Worthington et al., 2008) . In recent years, nephropathogenic IBV strains had been circulating in China (Bing et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2006) . However, the natures of circulating IBV strains in South China were not clear.",

All IBV strains except for the isolated TC07-2 strain and the reference DE/072/92 strain were clustered into six distinct genetic groups or genotypes (I-VI) (Fig. 1) . Genotype I was comprised of 10 isolated IBV strains and 5 published IBV strains from China, designated as A2-like group for the inclusion of A2 strain; genotype II of 2 isolated and 4 published IBV strains, designated as 4/91 group for the inclusion of 4/91 strain; genotype III of 14 isolated and 5 published strains; genotype IV of 2 published IBV strains; genotype V of 8 published IBV strains; and genotype VI of 4 published IBV strains. There are four noteworthy features of the constructed phylogenetic tree. First, all isolated IBV strains except for TC07-2 strain belong to genotypes I, II and III, forming a large evolutionary branch. Furthermore, the isolated IBV strains grouped in genotype I were most from 2007(5/10), and most of the isolated IBV strains from 2008(6/7) were grouped into genotype III, showing that there were no predominant new strains circulating in the fields of South China during 2004-2008. Second, 2 published IBV strains from Taiwan formed a unique genotype (i.e., genotype IV), implying that the evolution process in Taiwan is an isolated one. Third, all 5 known vaccine strains (i.e., H52, H120, M41, Ma5 and W93) were clustered into genotype V that is evolutionarily distant from genotypes I, II and III; this may explain why the isolated IBV strains survived the vaccination by the vaccine strains. Finally, 3 classical American and 1 Japanese strains formed genotype VI, and the isolated TC07-2 and published DE/072/92 strains showed the greatest evolutionary distances to all six major genotypes, but their significances are not clear. The results strongly suggest that different genotypes of IBVs were cocirculating in chicken flocks in South China.",

A motif at the cleavage site of the IBV S protein was generally comprised of RRXRR/S (X for any amino acid). Cleavage site motifs of the 27 isolated and 29 published IBV strains are listed in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. The 27 isolated strains contain 5 cleavage site motifs while the 29 published strains have 10 cleavage site motifs. The cleavage site motifs have the following four noteworthy features. First, in light of a total of 12 cleavage site motifs identified, the protease cleavage site motifs in S proteins are polymorphic. Second, 3 cleavage site motifs (RRFRR, HRRRR and RRSRR) are shared by both the isolated and published strains, where the shared motifs represented the majority of the strains (22/27 for isolated strains; 22/29 for published strains), and the majority of motifs have the recognized motif sequence RRXRR/S (14/ 27 for isolated strains; 21/29 for published strains). Third, 2 new motifs (RRSKR and HRRKR) emerged in the isolated strains, and in the meanwhile 7 motifs (HRSRR, RRHRR, RRLRR, HRPRR, RRIRR, HRFRR and RRFKR) identified in the published strains were not found in the isolated strains, indicating that the cleavage site motifs were undergoing a continuous evolution process. Finally, individual strains with high similarities in the phylogenetic tree usually share the same motifs, e.g., the lower branch of genotype I (RRFRR), the top branch of genotype III (RRSKR), the bottom branch of genotype III (RRFRR), and the genotype V (RRFRR). However, individual strains within one genotype have multiple motifs, e.g., genotype I having three motifs (RRFRR, HRRRR, and HRPRR), genotype II having 4 motifs (RRFRR, RRSRR, RRLRR, and HRFRR), and genotype III having 4 motifs (RRFRR, HRRRR, RRSKR, and RRHRR); indicating that the contribution of the cleavage site motif to one strain's genotype is limited.",

Our survey included only broilers because most of chicken flocks in poultry industry in South China were broilers. The inclusion of only broilers in our survey did not mena that IBV was not associated with disease problems in laying and breeding chickens in South China; instead, we believe that our survey of broilers was indicative for all chickens including laying and breeding chickens. Our data showed that all 27 isolated IBV strains from South China during 2004-2008 were evolutionarily distant from the vaccine strains used for current vaccinations, explaining at least partially why vaccination failed in occasions where new IBV strains emerged and caused persistent but infrequent outbreaks. Our data also demonstrated that no new predominant IBV strains were being emerged during 2004-2008, but the continuing evolution of the escaped IBV strains makes the emergence of a new predominant strain as a matter of time, mandating of our efforts in carrying out continuing surveilance of emerging new IBV strains in order to prevent possible epidemic or pandemic outbreaks of IBV infections in commercial flocks.",

For S1 gene, no field isolate showed more than 84% (data not shown) similarity of nucleotide sequence to vaccine strains (genotype V), and no field isolate was clustered to vaccine strains in phylogenetic tree. Therefore, we could reasonably rule out that any field isolate was a reisolation of vaccine virus. Nonetheless, the fact that NN04 and LZ07 were grouped with 4/91 in Group II in Fig. 1 was intriguing because it was possible they might be originated from the leak of 4/91 strain from experiments done in China even though no vaccine based on 4/91 strain was licensed in China. This possibility was highly unlikely because their S1 amino acid sequences were very different. As shown in Table 4 , amino acids from 52 to 55 and from 71 to 76 were VFNG and YES. . .. . ...YNI for 4/91, STNK and FNYTNGN.DV-GYNN for NN04, and STNY and KDV. . .. . ...YNQ for LZ07.",

            "text": "QXIBV was first isolated in China in 1996 (reported in Chinese), associated with proventriculitis. In 2004, this virus was reported associated predominantly with various forms of renal pathology in China . The QX-like IBV strains more recently have been widely detected in many European countries, becoming a dominant genotype in some European countries, and are causing severe losses to both the layer and broiler industry (Worthington et al., 2004; . In addition, QX-like strains have been reported associated with false layers, swollen kidneys. In the present study, 6 field isolates were clustered to QXIBV in a branch (Fig. 1) , of which, 4 show typical nephritis symptoms and 2 show typical respiratory clinical signs. In Worthington et al. (2008) , the European QX-like IBV strains have been detected in flocks of broilers, broiler breeders and commercial layers. Of these flocks, 86% had respiratory signs, 22% had wet litter or enteric problems, 14% had increased mortality, 2% had swollen kidneys and 2% had arthritis. In 60% of the layers there was a reduction of egg production and quality. In the phylogenetic tree analysis with QX-like IBV strains from both Europe and China (data not shown), it is of interest that the QX-like IBV strains disclosed in Worthington et al. (2008) were clustered into a different branch than the one formed by the isolates from China, indicating that the QX-like IBV strains have undergone divergent evolution paths in Europe and China.",

Furthermore, the present study challenges the feasibility of inclusion of new variant strains for vaccine preparation for better protection against IBV infection because it is unpredictable of which new variant strains will emerge. Finally, the present study revealed that there were no new predominant IBV strains circulating in the fields in South China yet, but it is reasonable to expect that such predominant IBV strains will eventually emerge under the increased immune pressures due to increased vaccination of commercial flocks. Therefore, this study manifests the importance of continuing surveillance of new IBV strains in order to better prepare for next epidemic or pandemic outbreaks of IBV infections in commercial flocks.",
