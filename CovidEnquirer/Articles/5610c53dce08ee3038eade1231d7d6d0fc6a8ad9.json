The multiple components ran true upon reelectrophoresis, and there were no technical artifacts. Their resolution did not depend on a particular method for the preparation or disruption of the virion. The Cl-C6 components of pH gradient electrophoresis and the classical VPl-VP3 polypeptides were examined with regard to (i) their migration in normal and pH gradient reelectrophoresis and (ii) their kinetics of leucine incorporation in emetine-stopped pulses. It is concluded that Cl and C2 were both derived from VPI, C3 and C4 from VP2, and C5 and C6 from VP3.",

The eluate was concentrated, resubmitted to the original protein extraction procedure, and reelectrophoresed in the normal system; the results were similar to those shown in Fig. 2A and identical to those of controls in which the first electrophoresis was omitted. Thus, pretreatment of the SDS complexes of poliovirion polypeptides at pH 11, either in free solution or in an acrylamide gel, failed to produce detectable alterations in their migration patterns. The experiments to be presented below, in which single components were resolved by pH gradient electrophoresis and rerun in the same system, allow the same conclusion. In addition, (i) incipient resolution of VP2 and VP3 into doublets was also achieved by electrophoresis at a lower pH, including the normal (pH 7.2) technique, and (ii) nonviral test proteins failed to yield multiple components in pH gradient electrophoresis (Vrijsen and Boeye, 1978) . It is concluded that pH gradient eiectrophoresis does not cause the observed multiplicity of the poliovirus capsid polypeptides but merely resolves preexisting components. In summary, fine resolution of the poliovirus capsid polypeptides was achieved by pH gradient electrophoresis and the results were independent of (i) the virus purification or (ii) protein extraction procedures, (iii) the state of maturation (procapsid or mature virion), and (iv) the serotype (type 1 or 2).",

This shows the stability of the protein-SDS complexes throughout the extraction procedure and the absence of conversion to the doublet partner; (ii) material taken from the left, center, or right of peak Cl migrated identically upon reelectrophoresis (results partly shown in Figs. BA-BB), thus showing the original Cl peak to contain a single molecular species. This also held true for peaks C5 (Figs. BD-8F) and C6 (Figs. 8F-8G); (iii) material collected between two of the original peaks again yielded two peaks (Figs. BB, 8D, and 8F); (iv) C3 and C4 were not resolved, but the presence of two kinds of molecules was demonstrated by the progressive shift to the right upon reelectrophoresis of successive fractions (Figs. BC-8D ). This single-slice reelectrophoresis experiment allows two conclusions: (i) No interconversion among doublet partners could be demonstrated, and (ii) at least those components which could be clearly resolved in the primary radioactivity profile (i.e., Cl, C5, and CS) ran true upon reelectrophoresis. DISCUSSION The improved resolution of poliovirus capsid polypeptides by pH gradient electrophoresis reported by Vrijsen and Boeye (1978) was confirmed and shown to be independent of the serotype and of the methods used for virus purification and protein extraction. It is therefore unlikely that the multiple components observed were preparative artifacts, as have been observed with proteins of coronaviruses (Sturman, 1977) . The possibility that they were formed by partial degradation of the protein during electrophoresis was also examined and rejected.",

The pattern was not entirely constant, however, as neighboring components sometimes failed to separate (e.g., C3-C4 in Fig. 80 ; C5-C6 in Fig. 4) ; on the other hand, the results occasionally suggested further resolution of a single component (e.g., C3 in Figs. 4 and 5D-5F). Due to these and other technical difficulties, no single experiment yielded all of the information being sought, and a clear picture emerged only by juxtaposition of the results. According to this picture, Cl and C2 formed a doublet corresponding to VPl, C3 and C4 a second doublet corresponding to VP2, and C5 and C6 a third doublet corresponding to VP3. With regard to the Cl-C2 doublet, for example, this correspondence means (i) that the molecules which migrate as either Cl or C2 in pH gradient electrophoresis will migrate as VP1 in normal SDS-PAGE, and (ii) that Cl and C2 in emetine-stopped pulses are labeled equally and according to the same kinetics as VPl. Thus, although we demonstrated a higher number of electrophoretie components, our findings are still basically in agreement with the accepted VPl-2-3-4 scheme for the composition of the poliovirus capsid.",

Even so, the question may be asked whether the two electrophoretic components in each doublet could not be different dodecyl sulfate complexes of the same polypeptide. Therefore, we looked for possible interconversion to the doublet partner upon isolation of single components and exact recreation of the conditions under which the protein-detergent complexes were originally formed (extraction of capsid protein).

Such differences may conceivably originate in the accumulation of mutants as a result of serial passages (Phillips and Fennell, 1973) . To prevent any such accumulation, however, each virus population examined in this work was grown from a single plaque by only four passages, and a mutational origin of the observed multiplicity can therefore be excluded.",

Since the capsid proteins are carved out of a common precursor by successive cleavages (Summers and Maizel, 1968; Jacobson and Baltimore, 1968) , microheterogeneity may result from multiplicity of the cleavage sites. Ambiguity of cleavage was already invoked to explain differences in the migration velocity of homologous polypeptides of different poliovirus strains (Cooper et al., 1970) or the appearance of doublets (Beckman et al., 1976) . However, no direct proof of ambiguity was offered and the case rests on the unproven assumption that differences in migration velocity in SDS-PAGE necessarily reflect differences in molecular weight.",
