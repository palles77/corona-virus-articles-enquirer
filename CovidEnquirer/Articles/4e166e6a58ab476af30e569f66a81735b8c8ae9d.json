Inflammatory diarrheas produce a severer form of acute diarrhea and require additional medical and laboratory evaluation. In contrast, noninflammatory diarrheas generally are milder in immunocompetent hosts, although severe fluid loss with attendant morbidity and mortality can occur, especially in malnourished individuals. 66 Inflammatory diarrheas are caused primarily by invasive or toxin-producing organisms, including Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium dificile, enterohemorrhagic In addition to these agents, food-borne outbreaks of noninflammatory diarrhea may be caused by preformed toxins of Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus and by in vivo production of Clostridium perfringens toxins. These organisms or their toxins primarily affect the small intestine rather than the colon. In contrast to invasive or toxigenic inflammatory diarrheal agents, these organisms may adhere to the small intestine but fail to produce significant disruption of normal mucosal architecture. Noninflammatory diarrheas can present with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramping. Diarrhea is watery, but blood and polymorphonuclear leukocytes generally are absent from the stool.",

Cases that are protracted or severe (producing dehydration and weakness), especially when accompanied by overt fecal blood, do come to the attention of physicians and often require diagnostic laboratory evaluation. In this setting, diagnostic laboratory tests are an important adjunct for identifying the offending pathogen or for ruling out more serious or potentially treatable conditions.z, 6, 16, 39, 48 A systematic approach to the evaluation of diarrheal disease before submission of specimens for laboratory evaluation includes documenting disease characteristics (nature of onset, frequency, duration, and qualitative description of stool), obtaining an adequate patient or family history (patient characteristics, activities, diet, medication, travel history, family and community contacts, and hospitalizations), and conducting a thorough physical examination.8* l6 Tala1 and described a more detailed systematic approach to diagnose common causes of diarrhea. Aranda-Michel and Giannella6 suggested that laboratory diagnostic tests should be reserved for patients with inflammatory bloody diarrhea with fever greater than 38.3\"C and for immunocompromised patients. The reader is referred to detailed consensus guidelines published by the American College of Gastroenterology and the Infectious Diseases Society of America that outline the application of diagnostic methods for identifymg enteric infections that require specific therapy or that are responsive to control meas u r e~?~, 51 Factors leading to the development of such guidelines include the increasing array of enteric pathogens associated with diarrheal illness and the need to develop cost-effective approaches when targeting patient evaluation and management. Briefly, laboratory approaches recommended in these guidelines to improve cost-effectiveness of stool culture include selective testing for the most likely pathogen; discouraging the submission of stool specimens from patients who have been hospitalized for greater than 3 days, unless overriding circumstances prevail (exceptions include hospital outbreaks, advanced age, comorbid disease, neutropenia, and HIV infection); specific examination for C. diflcile or its toxins in appropriate settings for patients who have been hospitalized for greater than 3 days; and use of screening tests, such as fecal leukocytes or fecal lactoferrin, for possible inflammatory or invasive diarrhea.

Cary-Blair transport medium should be used when transporting or anticipating a delay of more than 2 hours in processing the specimen for culture.sg Intestinal parasites usually are detected and identified with direct microscopy of fresh or formalin-preserved and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-preserved stool specimen^.^^ Many viruses, including rotaviruses, adenoviruses, astroviruses, caliciviruses, Norwalk virus, and other small, round viruses can be detected with electron microscopy, but stool specimens must be collected as close to the onset of the disease as possible, generally within the first 48 to 72 The stool should be examined for color, volume, consistency, and presence of blood and leukocytes. A simple, rapid, and useful test for acute infectious diarrhea is microscopic examination for fecal leukocytes in stool. Loeffler 's methylene blue and Gram stain may be used for direct microscopic examination of fecal specimens for the presence of fecal leukocytes. Fecal leukocytes may be observed after mixing equal amounts of methylene blue and fecal suspension on a slide and examining using a light microscope at 400 times Fecal leukocyte evaluation is considered positive if 3 or more leukocytes are seen per high-power field in 4 or more field^.^^,^^ A positive examination indicates an inflammatory condition in the colon, not necessarily associated with an infection. Fecal leukocytes generally are observed in patients with salmonellosis, shigellosis, campylobacteriosis, EIEC, EHEC, staphylococcal enterocolitis, Entamoeba histolytica, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and pseudomembranous colitis, among others.69, 72 Gram-stained smears of stool may be useful in determining the presence of fecal leukocytes but offer some disadvantages. Slides can be difficult to interpret, smear thickness and staining are difficult to standardize, cells deteriorate quickly, and specimens must be examined within minutes of collection to be accurate. Because the sensitivity of direct microscopic examination is 60% to 70%, the absence of fecal leukocytes does not exclude enteric pathogens. 93 Detection of lactoferrin is an indirect measure of the presence of leukocytes, from which it is released, and may offer advantages of increased sensitivity and rapidity of test perf~rmance.~~ A commercially available latex agglutination test (Leuko-Test, TechLab Inc, Blacksburg, VA) for the detection of elevated levels of fecal la~toferrin~~, 56 shows promise as a screening test for inflammatory diarrhea. This assay can measure elevated levels of lactoferrin released from deteriorated or damaged leukocytes in stool specimens, an advantage over the traditional fecal leutocyte assay. Yong et alloo showed that the fecal lactoferrin test was more sensitive (75%) than methylene blue microscopy (40%) for the detection of leukocytes in C. dijjicile-associated disease.",

The organism is isolated easily using common enteric media (BA and MAC) but does not grow well on thiosulfate citrate bile salt (TCBS) agar. I ? shigelloides is identified based on positive reactions with ornithine decarboxylase, lysine decarboxylase, and arginine dihydrolase tests.74",

ETEC and EPEC are important causes of diarrhea in infants, and ETEC is a primary cause of traveler's diarrhea.z2, 2s, Children less than 2 years old have a much higher risk of acquiring traveler's diarrhea. Diarrheagenic E. coli can produce watery, cholera-like diarrhea (ETEC), dysentery-like symptoms (EIEC), and grossly bloody diarrhea (EHEC). E. coli 0157H7, one of the common EHEC serotypes, was described first in 1982 and produces a Shiga-like toxin that causes sporadic cases and outbreaks of hemorrhagic colitis.= The organism is associated with severe hemolytic-uremic syndrome, especially in children (see articles by Ramaswamy and Jacobson, page 611, and Tarr and Neill, page 735). One of the major distinguishing cultural characteristics of this serotype is that about 80% of isolates do not ferment D-sorbitol. The medium of choice for isolation of this organism is sorbitol-MacConkey (SMAC) agar. Agar or broth medium containing the substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-~-~-glucuronide (MUG) can be used for detection of glucuronidase produced by E. coli. About 92% of E. coli 0157H7 isolates lack the enzyme P-glucuronidase and do not produce a fluorescent product when observed with long-wave UV light. Latex agglutination can be used as a rapid test for E. coli serogroup 0157 detection in primary cultures. The MUG assay, sorbitol-fermentation testing, and agglutination in E. coli 0157 antiserum are useful tests for screening for cytotoxigenic strains of 0157.6s Methods for the recovery and detection of other pathogenic E. coli are not routinely available.",

Culture of stool for C. diflcile using selective agar techniques has long been a mainstay in detecting the presence of the organism. George et alM was the first to describe a selective medium (cycloserine-cefoxitin-fructose agar [CCFA]) for recovery of C. dificile from stool; this formulation is in common use today. Direct detection of a C. dificile-associated antigen, glutamate dehydrogenase, in stool is another approach in documenting presence of the organism. Direct detection of C. dificile toxins responsible for clinical disease has become more popular because neither the culture method nor the marker antigen test distinguishes toxigenic from nontoxigenic strains, and cultures require at least 48 C. dificile produces 2 protein exotoxins, toxin A and toxin B, that are responsible for clinical disease: toxin A is an enterotoxin that causes fluid secretion, mucosal injury, and inflammation, whereas toxin B is a potent cytotoxin primarily mediating damage to colonic m~c o s a . '~ Because C. dificile disease is a treatable condition that must be differentiated from other causes of infectious and noninfectious diarrheal disease, considerable efforts have been made to develop rapid, sensitive, and specific tests for the detection of C. dificile toxins and the common antigen. Many EIA kits detecting toxin A, toxin B, or both are commercially available and vary considerably in sensitivity (34% to 100%) and specificity (88% to 100%). EIA and LA kits are available for detection of C. dificile glutamate dehydrogenase, although positive results do not differentiate toxigenic from nontoxigenic (i.e., colonizing) strains. Negative results with simultaneously performed glutamate dehydrogenase and toxin A tests reliably rule out the possibility of C. dificile-associated disease (negative predictive value, 99.6%).\" Despite availability and rapidity of EIA C. dificile antigen and toxin tests, the cytotoxin B tissue culture assay is the most specific test for detection of toxigenic C. diflcile.",
