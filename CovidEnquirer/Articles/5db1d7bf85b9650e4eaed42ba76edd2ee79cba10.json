Each of these units is labeled, and regulated as a drug, following FDA regulations. While today virtually all of these blood components from whole blood donation are from volunteer donors, the FDA would permit paying these donors, but requires that the component's label be marked conspicuously with the words \"PAID DONOR\" as opposed to \"VOLUNTEER DONOR.\" Whole blood donation is permitted no more often than once every eight weeks (to prevent development of iron defi ciency in the donor).",

            "text": "Most of the plasma separated from red blood cell units is not needed for direct transfusion to patients, and so it is provided as \"Recovered Plasma\" to large multi-national for-profi t companies that pool and fractionate it into plasma derivatives. The major source of plasma for plasma derivative manufacture, however, is \"Source Plasma\" collected by plasmapheresis (not whole blood collection). In the US, as well as many other countries, this Source Plasma is collected from donors who are paid (i.e. not volunteer), and the units of Source Plasma are labeled \"Paid Donor.\" Plasmapheresis today is an automated procedure in which blood is removed from a donor, and the red cells are returned but the plasma is retained outside the body. Donors may undergo this procedure as often as twice a week. Source Plasma from tens of thousands of donations is pooled by the plasma fractionators who then, utilizing a series of complex processes, chemically and physically separate the plasma into lots of several plasma derivatives, including albumin, gamma globulin, and sometimes Factor VIII and Factor IX concentrates (used in developing parts of the world to treat patients with hemophilia A and B respectively), as well as alpha 1 anti-trypsin. Currently, the process of plasma fractionation includes several purifying and sterilizing steps which render these derivatives essentially safe, even though the source material is from pools of plasma from thousands of paid donors (each donation is, though, still tested for hepatitis B and C, as well as HIV). Prior to the availability of HIV and hepatitis C testing, and prior to the addition of sterilizing steps in plasma fractionation in the 1980s, large numbers of patients with hemophilia were regularly exposed to hepatitis C and HIV, which resulted in a number of national scandals and law suits (see p. 208; Negligence, human error, and failed oversight). Today in the US most patients with hemophilia A and B are treated with synthetic preparations of Factor VIII and Factor IX (respectively), which are viewed as essentially virally safe but also much more expensive. The sterilizing steps used in plasma fractionation are not suited to the single blood components used for direct transfusion, since these processes would damage red blood cells, platelets, and whole plasma, such that these components would not be effi cacious. are discarded, not used). This has not been accomplished throughout sub Saharan Africa. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that HIV-contaminated blood still accounts for 5 percent of HIV infections throughout the region (Heyns et al., 2005) .",

In 1940 the process of fractionation for breaking down plasma into albumin and gamma globulin was discovered, and these products soon were available for clinical use. World War II created an immediate demand for blood, and around this time the American Red Cross started using the vacuum bottle to collect and store donated blood. Whole blood donations were tested for ABO and Rh type, as well as syphilis. Meanwhile, the United States Government set up a nationwide program for collecting blood, and the \"Plasma for Britain\" program to aid the British war effort. During the war, albumin was used to treat shock, the Coombs test was discovered, and acid citrate dextrose (ACD) solution came into use to prolong shelf-life -thereby making more blood available for transfusion.",

The American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) was established in 1947, with a mission to promote safe blood-banking and improve public and professional education. Fueled by advances in medical care, like open-heart surgery and trauma care, there was steady increase in the demand for blood during the 1950s. In 1970, component therapy came into medical practice -fi rst with red blood cells and plasma, and later with platelets and cryoprecipitated antihemophilic factor (AHF) for transfusion. Today, blood is transfused to a patient essentially only as one of the components of whole blood -i.e. red cells, platelets, or plasma -while whole blood is rarely transfused as such. This approach is benefi cial in two respects: it is clinically better for the individual patient to receive only the component needed (and not be exposed to potential adverse effects of the other, unrelated component), and it also permits several patients to benefi t from each unit of donated whole blood. In addition, the optimal storage conditions are different for the different blood components -red cells are refrigerated, plasma is frozen, and platelets are agitated at room temperature. Up to four different components may be derived from one unit of blood, but nowadays rarely more than three are prepared.",

Multiple units of platelets can be collected as frequently as every two weeks by a procedure called platelet pheresis. Two or three units of plasma can be collected at a time by plasmapheresis, even more frequently.

            "text": "Most infectious agents transmissible by transfusion have been around for many years, so in general it is prior donor activity that determines whether a unit of blood is infected or not. Occasionally a new microbe, like the human immunodefi ciency virus (HIV) or Babesia microti, is introduced. And, while West Nile Virus may have been in Africa for some time, it was fi rst identifi ed only recently in the United States. Regardless whether it is an ancient or new agent, similar human activities are likely to underpin their entry into and transmission along the medical blood supply. They include intravenous drug use with needlesharing, high-risk or multiple partner sexual activity, exposure to insect vectors, travel, population migration, and medical negligence, and each may be infl uenced by economic, political, and social conditions. These subjects are discussed elsewhere in this volume, so this chapter will focus on their specifi c impact on blood safety. By far the greatest challenge to blood safety today is in the developing world, primarily in sub Saharan Africa and parts of Asia, as a consequence of inadequate resources and dated technology in the health sector. The result has been epidemics of transfusion-related HIV, hepatitis, and other infectious diseases. Failing to test all donated blood for infectious agents is thought to have caused up to 16 million HBV infections, 5 million HCV infections, and 160,000 cases of HIV worldwide (Heyns et al., 2005) . In 1975, a World Health Assembly (WHA) resolution called for countries to adopt nationally coordinated, voluntary blood transfusion services. So far, fewer than 30 percent of the signatory states have done so. In contrast, developed nations have made a deliberate policy to ignore cost in order to emphasize safety. The result has been steady increases in transfusion safety and cost. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has been regulating blood-banking for several decades. However, around 1990 the FDA also started applying the regulations for pharmaceutical manufacture to blood-banking. Also, in its mission to protect the public health, it is not permitted to consider cost when promulgating rules and conducting oversight -so, even though proven not to be cost-effective, the FDA approved, on an interim basis, p-24 antigen testing for HIV. The FDA at the time was looking ahead to when a more effective NAT test would be available. Still, one study estimated it costs about $2 million to prevent one case of transfusion-related HIV (Heyns et al., 2005) . Currently, NAT is routinely performed to detect HIV-1, hepatitis C Virus (HCV), and West Nile virus. Figure  7 .1 illustrates the steady rise in the price of blood-banking services, due in part to increased testing. It should also be noted that in earlier years blood centers traditionally had underpriced the cost of providing red cells for transfusion.",

            "text": "Relatively low-cost, low-technology public health strategies continue to be the fi rst-line and most important defenses to protect blood safety. They include establishing an altruistic system for blood donation, effective public education, rigorous professional training, and continuous epidemiological surveillance and consistent front-line screening (not testing) of prospective donors before they give blood. While the array of accurate laboratory screening tests continues to grow, it is probably fair to predict that there never will be a fully effective laboratory test for every infectious agent that can be transmitted via blood transfusion. The environment of infectious microbes is always changing, as is the ecology of human activities that can spread them. It is therefore realistic to expect that the next infectious agent will be present in asymptomatic blood donors before there is a test for it. Other sources of risk include the donor that is infectious but not yet positive by available testing; an infection that is immuno-silent; lab error; and the eruption of a new infectious agent or new variant of a known agent. With this reality in mind, continuous epidemiological surveillance to uncover changing disease patterns and a willingness to be creative, diligent, and rapid in adapting to new challenges are the keys to maintaining public health. In addition, as we learned from the outset of the AIDS epidemic, public health measures will have to adapt to ethical and legal parameters of pluralistic societies. The challenges to maintaining suffi cient blood supplies for life-saving medical needs are constantly changing while demand is always increasing. Not long ago, there were concerns related to discriminating against vulnerable and stigmatized groups. Today, a concern is rejecting people that have traveled to or lived in Western Europe. 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 The United States has a fully voluntary system. Most collection centers in the United States stopped paying for blood in the late 1960s, and with that came a clear reduction in transmission of hepatitis by transfusion. In the early 1970s in the United States there was a risk of approximately 6-8 percent of contracting some form of hepatitis from a transfusion. The risk now of becoming infected with hepatitis B is about 1 in 250,000, and the risk of acquiring hepatitis C is less than 1 in 3300 units transfused. This remarkable improvement in reducing post-transfusion hepatitis may be considered a marker for overall blood safety that occurred from the mid-1960s onward with the US national shift to voluntary blood donation. To appreciate the role of voluntary donation in this improvement, it is helpful to note that at about this time Australia Antigen testing (HBsAg Assay) for hepatitis B was introduced. However, the Australian Antigen test does not detect hepatitis C (previously called Non A/Non B), and HCV transmission declined over these years. It seems reasonable to conclude that voluntary donation works. After 1970, only a very few institutions in the United States continued to pay certain blood donors, and the last few stopped the practice in the past 15 years. Since 2004, we believe that all blood components transfused in the US come from volunteer sources.",

To some, this policy is controversial. Educational materials provided in advance contain clear and specifi c instructions that list the exclusions for giving blood, such as recent travel to a geographic location where malaria is endemic, or residence in Europe where variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (vCJD) is present (see below). Upon entering the blood collection center, prospective donors are given written materials with information on the risks and symptoms associated with infectious diseases transmitted by blood transfusion. They are asked questions and then given a form to sign indicating they have read and understood the material, and have provided accurate personal information. Questions also are asked about donor safety, such as a medical history of heart disease, current fever, or other sign of infectious disease.

For example, in response to the newly emerging AIDS epidemic of the early 1980s, blood collection centers began asking men about sexual contact with other men. Even though a virus had not yet been isolated and determined to cause AIDS, population-based data were showing the new disease to be behaving like hepatitis B, which already was well known to be caused by a virus and spread by sexual activity, by sharing intravenous needles during recreational drug use, and by blood transfusion. In general, the public health approach is to continue an effective screening measure until population-based data points conclusively in another direction. It is rare to discontinue the strict application of a screening protocol until there is convincing data over a sustained period of time.

Accordingly, as experience developed, with millions of blood donations being tested, information regarding the false-positive rate became available and the test was modifi ed over the next few years to improve its specifi city. Still, the screening questions were not changed until solid epidemiological information became available. To do this, donors with positive test results were interviewed and specifi c criteria for Western Blot positivity began to be developed by looking at individuals who had been considered Western Blot-positive but had no risk factors for disease.

During the fi ve-hour surgical procedure at a Rome hospital to repair his wounds, the Pope was given six pints of blood. On 20 June 1981, he was hospitalized with a high fever and infl ammation of the right lung. The Pope was tested and found to be infected with cytomegalovirus (CMV), a herpes-type virus that can be transmitted by sexual contact and blood transfusion. He had acquired CMV from the blood administered during surgery. At the time, neither Italian law nor standard medical practice required the transfused units to be tested for CMV (Catholic News Service, 2005) . A number of years later, fi ltering the white blood cells' blood components came into common use, which reduces the risk of CMV from transfusion. Pope John Paul's experience illustrates the link between human behavior and transfusion risk. There are a number of infectious agents associated with human high-risk sexual behavior and injecting drug use that are of special concern for safety of the blood supply. The fi rst to be identifi ed was syphilis, for which testing began just after World War II, at a time when the rate of syphilis infection was much higher in the general population. Then and now, however, the risk of acquiring syphilis via blood transfusion, if present at all, is exceedingly small -in fact, in the United States there have been no recorded cases transmitted by transfusion in many years, and only one report in the literature (in the 1970s) of a poorly documented case of syphilis transmitted by transfusion. Moreover, the spirochete that causes syphilis is fragile and becomes inactive during the fi rst few days of refrigerated blood storage. The same cannot be said for hepatitis B, HIV, HTLV, and CMV, however, as these infections are spread sexually and can also be transmitted by transfusion.",

Epidemics related to high-risk sexual activity, such as sex work and trading sex for drugs, are discussed in Chapter 2, and epidemics related to intravenous drug use are discussed in Chapter 3. Both types of behavior are known to impact the safety of the blood supply, especially when donors are paid. Blood is an ideal medium for harboring, growing, and transmitting the agents that are spread by these behaviors, such as HIV, the hepatitis B and C viruses, HTLV, CMV, and others. To combat this problem, the Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has called for expanded drug abuse prevention, harm reduction, and public education. They believe that \"National Societies, with their unique combination of volunteer support and community membership alongside their status as auxiliaries to the public authorities in the humanitarian fi eld, have a special contribution to make to the best approach to the challenges at the national and community level\" (Kopketzky, 2005) . For more than two decades international attention has been on the AIDS epidemic, where HIV, like the hepatitis B virus, is known to spread by sexual contact and IVDU. Of note is that fi ve countries in the former Soviet Union and Asia that have combined populations of almost 2 billion are seeing HIV epidemics of more than 50,000 registered cases per country (Wolfe and Malinowska-Sempruch, 2007) . These epidemics are associated with high-risk human sexual activity and injection drug use, and these nations also have limited safety controls on blood banking. Even with improved laboratory screening, the front-line defense in these states, as in developed nations, is effective public health screening. The US guidelines that relate most directly to uncovering high-risk sexual activity and IVDU also exclude any individual with AIDS or a positive HIV test.

Similarly, while Chagas' disease is endemic in Mexico, Central and South America, and millions of people from these countries travel annually to America, the reported incidence of Chagas' disease due to blood transfusion in the United States is very, very low (Chamberland et al., 1998) . Nevertheless, concern is real because blood is an extraordinarily effective vehicle for transmitting infectious agents (Chamberland et al., 1998) . Since a fully effective laboratory test for every blood-transmissible infectious disease in the world is not on the horizon, the current fi rst line of defense will have to remain effective health screening and public education before individuals give blood. It also is hopeful to note that new laboratory tests to screen human blood are being developed. As noted already, in the wake of improved screening tests for infections transmissible by transfusion, we are seeing a greater emphasis on developing screens for parasites (e.g. Chagas' disease and malaria) that can infect the blood supply. Even with these population shifts, the blood supply in developed nations remains remarkably safe, as illustrated in Table 7 .5, which shows the low rate of transfusion-related infection due to malaria and to T. cruzi infections not endemic in the United States, as well as babesiosis, which is endemic in the US.

In the United States, potential donors are screened by questionnaire and asked to refrain from giving blood until one year after visiting a malarial area, three years after completing treatment for malaria, or three years after living in an area where it is endemic.

CJD can affect humans in three ways: sporadic CJD, which has no known risk factors and accounts for 85 percent of CJD cases; hereditary CJD, which occurs in individuals with a family history of the disease and tests positive for specifi c genetic mutations; and acquired CJD, which is transmitted by exposure to brain or nervous system tissue. Acquired CJD accounts for less than 1 percent of CJD cases, and has occurred most in individuals that received repeated injections of human pituitary gland growth hormone. This preparation was prepared from pools of pituitary glands from a number of cadavers. Through the 1950s it was used to treat congenital dwarfi sm, although this practice was subsequently supplanted by a synthetic growth hormone preparation. CJD also has been transmitted to patients who have undergone brain surgery, including transplant of the dura mater -the covering of the brain and spinal cord. This material was harvested from human cadavers and then used in some brain operations. The dura mater had been stored in a vat along with dura mater from other cadavers that had contaminated material. Affected individuals may take decades to develop symptoms, and then progress rapidly to dementia, severe loss of coordination, and death. While the cause of CJD remains uncertain, the suspicion now is that it occurs in response to abnormal changes in the shape of brain prions. Currently, there is no screening test for the disease, and while blood transfusions have never been shown to transmit CJD, as a precaution the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prohibits blood donation by individuals who may be at risk. These include potential donors who have received injections of human-derived pituitary hormone, those with a family history of CJD, or those who have had surgeries that involved transplanted dura mater. Similar to CJD, and an issue with regard to travel, is variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (vCJD). It also is a rare, degenerative and very similar fatal disorder of the central nervous system, thought to occur after humans have eaten beef contaminated with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or \"mad cow\" disease). In 1996 the fi rst cases of vCJD were reported in the United Kingdom, and there soon was concern on the part of blood banks and public health offi cials that it could contaminate the blood supply. To date the problem has remained quite rare, with only cases in the United Kingdom (UK) and a few in France and Italy. There has been one case in the United States, but it was in a person who had lived in the UK during the period of greatest risk. So far there have recently been two cases, both in the UK and presumed to have been transmitted via blood transfusion. The USFDA policy seeks to strike a reasonable balance between guarding against the risk of spreading vCJD through blood-banking, and preserving the supply of blood products for medical use. Currently, the policy relates to travel and residence in Europe, and recommends the following individuals be deferred indefi nitely:",

There has been much discussion about the development of a test for vCJD that could be used to screen blood donors, but there has been little real progress. In order to be sensitive enough to identify virtually all potentially infectious donations, almost all screening tests will have a false-positive rate. To deal with this it is necessary to have a suitable confi rmatory test prior to beginning donor screening. The rationale is that, with the risk of transmission by transfusion being so small, it would be unacceptable to be in a situation of notifying a fair number of volunteer blood donors that they have a test result suggesting they may later develop a fatal disease for which there is no treatment, and when there is uncertainty about the meaning of the test result.",

Today, it infects as many as 18 million people worldwide. Once established in the body the infection is lifelong, and several thousand South and Central Americans die annually of heart and digestive problems caused by the parasite. Up to 20 percent of infected people never exhibit symptoms. Over the years, Chagas' disease has often been transmitted by transfusion in South America. Prior to the availability of a test, and since, there has been no treatment for Chagas' disease. Earlier, gentian violet was added directly to units of blood prior to transfusing them. More recently, testing for Chagas' disease has become routine in much of South America. While the infection remains rare outside of South and Central America, it has come to be considered a threat to the blood supply because of global travel and migration, especially from South America to North America. To date, there have been only seven cases of transfusion-transmitted Chagas' disease reported in North America (two of them in Canada), but it is estimated that several million people from countries where Chagas' disease is present now reside in the United States, and 100,000 or more may be infected with T. cruzi (Kirchoff et al., 1987) . In several investigational studies of US blood donors with confi rmed sensitive tests, so far there has been only a handful of cases of blood donors with confi rmed positive tests, but not all have been tracked to donors from countries where Chagas' disease is endemic. As a precaution, the American Association of Blood Banks' guidelines prohibit blood donation from anyone who has had Chagas' disease. Laboratory and screening tests are now under development. It is expected that, when approved, such testing will be implemented routinely on all donations.",

Occasionally babesiosis is misdiagnosed as malaria, but when correctly diagnosed appropriate antibiotic therapy is effective. There are no useful tests available for screening blood donors, although testing strategies are being discussed.

There is one interesting case of an individual thought to have been positive for both Lyme disease and babesiosis whose blood donation transmitted only babesiosis but not Lyme disease (Cable et al., 1993; McQuiston et al., 2000) . While transfusion-related cases have not been reported, public health agencies and the AABB are monitoring this disease because of the remote chance that it could affect transfusion safety.

Like Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis is occurring in a context of widening suburban sprawl in North America, Europe, and Japan. Once in the bloodstream, the bacteria invade and kill white blood cells. There are two types of ehrlichiosis: human granulocytic (HGE) and human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME). The threat to the blood supply appears to be primarily from HGE. From 1986 to 1997, there were only 449 cases of HGE reported in the United States. Symptoms include relatively mild and self-limited fever, headache, and malaise. However, 10-20 percent of people with HGE go on to suffer encephalitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and opportunistic infections, and up to 5 percent of infections may be fatal. Treatment with antibiotics such as tetracylines is effective. The incidence of HGE is not well understood among blood donors, with perhaps only one presumptive case in a blood recipient. Preliminary studies indicate that HGE can survive in refrigerated blood for up to 18 days (Walker and Dumler, 1997; Leiby et al., 2002) .",

Most cases identifi ed have been in Asia, but there have been outbreaks elsewhere, including the United States and Canada. To date, there has been no evidence of SARS transmission through blood transfusion. However, the potential exists, because the virus associated with SARS is present in the blood of people who are sick. If it were possible for the virus to be present in blood before an individual becomes ill and for that person to donate blood, then that individual potentially could introduce the virus into the blood supply. To prevent this from occurring, blood collection facilities ask potential donors orally or in writing about recent travel to a SARS-affected country, a history of SARS infection, or possible exposure to SARS. Because the risk of contracting SARS through a blood transfusion theoretically exists during periods of SARS epidemics anywhere in the world, anyone who has traveled to a SARS-infected area or who has had close contact with a person with SARS or someone suspected of having SARS is asked to refrain from donating blood for at least 14 days after arriving in the United States. \"Close contact\" is defi ned as having cared for, lived with, or had direct contact with the respiratory secretions and/or body fl uids of a person known to have, or to have had, SARS. Anyone who has been ill with SARS or suspected SARS should refrain from donating blood for 28 days from the last date of treatment and symptoms. In addition, all donors are asked to call the blood center after donating if they then become ill. If this call occurs prior to the blood being transfused, the unit(s) can be intercepted and destroyed. As long as a donor is and remains well, no other measures are necessary.",

While each blood donor is handled separately from the others, a staff person evaluating the donor's history can turn the donor and the form over to another staff person, and then to the venipuncture technician to collect the blood and the tubes for testing. As a check, a second staff person is tasked to ask the donor to provide his name again so it can be checked with the paperwork before collecting the unit. If this check is not performed correctly, one donor's identifying information can become associated with another donor's unit of blood. While the donated unit will have all of the test results associated with it, if the donor subsequently calls back (this is an infrequent event) saying that he has developed a fever or has just learned of recent prior exposure to hepatitis, the wrong unit of blood will be recalled, and the one that should be recalled could be transfused. 2. A more ominous error would be a mix-up between the \"whole blood number,\" with its associated bar code of one unit of blood, with the numbering on the tubes for testing from another donation. The bar code and number are manually placed on each of three or four tubes for testing, and on the unit of blood itself. If a staff person is interrupted during the placing of these bar codes on tubes and bags, or if the wrong tubes are picked up for fi lling just before or after collection of the unit of blood, then the test results will be associated with the wrong unit for transfusion. If one donor's test results are positive, the unit could still be labeled as acceptable due to clear test results from the other donor, and transfused. Since 80 percent of blood donations are from repeat donors and the blood type on prior donations is checked before labeling the current donation, the blood center most probably will know an error has occurred, will investigate, and will prevent the labeling and release of all potentially affected units if the blood types on the two donors are different (e.g. one is A positive and another is O negative). Finding such a discrepancy is a very rare event, due to the emphasis on training collection staff about the importance of donor identity and proper handling of blood samples and unit labeling. In addition, hospitals are required to re-check the ABO and Rh type of each unit of labeled blood they receive from a blood center before issuing it for transfusion to a patient. The consequence of adhering to strict procedures is that fi nding such a discrepancy at the hospital is a very, very rare event. Nevertheless, the practice of continuing this last check at the hospitals continues. If a test tube or unit does not have a proper number with bar code on it, it is not tested and not used, and the donation is discarded.",

At the time it was widely known that the AIDS epidemic in the United States had been associated with blood transfusion, especially among people with hemophilia. Meanwhile, Canada was not fully self-suffi cient in its supply of blood products and, in particular, did not have adequate supplies of Factor VIII concentrate (the plasma derivative) for people with hemophilia. The Canadian Red Cross was faced with the diffi cult problem of weighing the risk of importing potentially tainted blood products against that of putting hemophiliacs at risk because of insuffi cient supplies of clotting agent. The Canadian Red Cross chose to continue importing US supplies.

In 1988, the Canadian Hemophilia Society requested compensation for victims. They were ignored. The victims persisted. In 1993, the Federal Government appointed a Commission of Inquiry, headed by Justice Horace Krever, to investigate the spread of HIV and hepatitis C through the blood-banking system. They concluded that Red Cross and Government oversight had led to failure to act in a timely manner to prevent the spread of HIV and hepatitis through the blood supply, that the system had been under-funded, and that Canada lacked a strong national blood policy with clear lines of responsibility across organizations and agencies involved in the entire process of blood-banking. Victims and families were awarded compensation. The Commission also concluded that donated blood is a national public resource, and safety is paramount. A national independent board was established, national standards were promulgated, and in 1998 the Red Cross was replaced by the new Canadian Blood Services to manage the blood-banking system. In 2004, federal, provincial, and territorial governments announced the country's fi rst national standards to govern the handling of blood and blood products from \"vein-to-vein.\" In May 2005, the Canadian Red Cross apologized and pleaded guilty to distributing tainted blood products. Dr Roger Perrault, the National Medical Director of the Canadian Red Cross at the time of the scandal, three other physicians, and Armour Pharmaceuticals (located in the United States) were put on trial for criminal negligence. That proceeding continues. It is estimated that perhaps 20,000 people were infected with hepatitis C, and about 1000 with HIV.",

In France, perhaps 4000 individuals were infected. Three French offi cials were charged: the former Premier, Laurent Fabius; his superior at the time, the Social Affairs Minister Georgina Dufoix; and the Health Minister responsible for oversight, Edmond Herv\u00e9. At the core of the charge of negligence was that the three had delayed introducing the US blood-screening test into France until a rival French product was ready to go on the market. Herv\u00e9 was convicted of negligence for HIV acquired by two recipients of the products, but the court failed to hand down punishment. Still, at least there was public recognition of offi cial responsibility (BBC News, 1999) . In Japan, more than 1400 hemophiliacs were exposed to HIV and at least 500 died as a result. The scandal raised a national outcry about whether the Japanese Government's health bureaucracy was too tied to the pharmaceutical industry, and thereby put profi ts over people.

No one could have predicted the enormous challenges created by the AIDS pandemic, and no doubt new challenges will arise in the years ahead. One such relatively new concern is terrorism (see Chapter 12). Offi cials in the United States are concerned about the possibility that terrorists could obtain access to the smallpox virus and use it against the public. Before 1972, vaccinia, the live virus used in smallpox vaccinations, was routinely administered to Americans. Smallpox can be highly infectious -for example, a scab at the inoculation site can contain infectious virus, so it is possible for a scab that spontaneously separates from the skin to inadvertently infect close contacts that touch the vaccination site or dressing. Another area of concern is blood-banking. In response to this potential threat, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has been working with state and local governments to strengthen preparedness. Part of the strategy is to expand the national stockpile of smallpox vaccine, which is highly effective when administered shortly after exposure. To make certain the virus is not transmitted through a blood transfusion, potential donors will be asked at blood collection facilities about a history of vaccination or close contact with anyone who has been vaccinated. A vaccine recipient who has had no complications may donate after the vaccination scab has spontaneously separated, or 21 days after vaccination, whichever is the later. Individuals who receive a smallpox vaccination may be asked to refrain from donating for an interval of two months if a scab was pulled off or knocked off (i.e. did not spontaneously separate), and to refrain for 14 symptom-free days if there has been a complication or contact with a vaccine recipient that developed skin lesions or other complications. If smallpox vaccinations were to be administered rapidly to a large section of the population, this would have a substantial negative effect on the blood supply, particularly platelets. The current FDA recommendation is for individuals to refrain from donating blood for one month after smallpox vaccination.",

There are different approaches to pathogen inactivation of red cells, platelets, and plasma; since the functionality of red cells, platelets, and plasma proteins are different in their fragility, the function of each must be preserved to be effective. These approaches involve exposing each single blood component to a chemical, sometimes along with UV light, such that viruses, bacteria, and parasites would be inactivated and no longer infectious. These processes require addition of inactivating chemicals to the blood, then washing out these chemicals so the patient is not exposed to the chemical. To perform this inactivation on each component would be expensive and require very large laboratories, and would generate huge volumes of hazardous waste (the wash solution). Due to the increasing safety of blood for transfusion that has occurred in the last 20 years, it is questioned whether this (now) small incremental (theoretic) improvement in safety is worth the huge expense (and risk to staff in handling all these chemicals).
