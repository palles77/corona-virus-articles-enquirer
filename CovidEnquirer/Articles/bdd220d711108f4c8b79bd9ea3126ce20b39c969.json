The objective of this study was to determine whether Bartonella species seroprevalence or titer magnitude varies among cats with uveitis, cats without ocular diseases recorded and healthy cats, while controlling for age and risk of flea exposure based on state of residence. There was no difference in seroprevalence rates or titer magnitude between cats with uveitis and cats with non-ocular diseases. Healthy cats were more likely to be seropositive for Bartonella species than cats with uveitis. The median Bartonella species titer was 1:64 for all groups, although healthy cats were more likely to have higher titers than cats with uveitis and cats with non-ocular disease. The results suggest that serum antibody tests alone cannot be used to document clinical uveitis associated with Bartonella species infection.",

Exogenous uveitis is the result of an external influence on the eye, such as trauma or surgery, and can generally be diagnosed based upon history and ophthalmic examination. Some causes of endogenous uveitis, such as primary intraocular neoplasia or cataract, also can be diagnosed by ophthalmic examination. However, infectious or immune-mediated causes are not so easily identified because of the lack of adequate diagnostic tests. In these cases, a diagnosis of idiopathic uveitis is made. The infectious agents commonly associated with endogenous uveitis include feline infectious peritonitis virus (Peiffer and Wilcock 1991) , feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) (English et al 1990) , feline leukemia virus (FeLV) (Brightman et al 1991) , Toxoplasma gondii (Lappin et al 1992) , feline herpesvirus type 1 (FHV-1) (Maggs et al 1999) , and systemic mycoses (Gerding et al 1994 , Medleau et al 1995 . However, it is likely that other infectious agents can also cause intraocular inflammation.",

In another report, serum and aqueous humor were collected from client-owned cats with uveitis and cats without uveitis within a humane society . Aqueous humor was tested for anti-Bartonella species IgM and IgG and the results compared to those from the serum to determine whether intraocular production of antibodies against Bartonella species was occurring. In addition, aqueous humor was assayed for DNA from Bartonella species using a conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Cats with uveitis and cats without uveitis had B henselae DNA amplified from the aqueous humor but only cats with uveitis had intraocular production of antibodies against B henselae. In another study, the authors documented serum antibody production against Bartonella species via Western blot immunoassays in cats with uveitis (Ketring et al 2004) .",

Therefore, cats were classified as having 'high' or 'low' flea risk based upon state of origin (Jameson et al 1995) . Cats from the following geographic areas (states) were categorized as having low risk of flea exposure: Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming. Cats from all other states were considered to have a high risk of flea exposure. Relationships between B henselae serological status (positive or negative) and clinical presentations were first assessed by Fisher's exact test. Additionally, logistic regression was used to assess the influence of serological status, age, and risk of flea exposure on clinical presentation. Cats were grouped into five age classes of approximately equal sample sizes (<2, 2 to <5, 5 to <8, 8 to <11, and !11 years of age). Relationships between B henselae titer magnitude and clinical manifestations were assessed by determining median titers for each group and evaluated with Wilcoxon's rank sum test.

Samples were submitted by multiple veterinary clinicians (both board certified ophthalmologists and general practitioners) and the motivation to submit sera for testing differed among groups. Thus one of the major weaknesses of this study is the lack of a consistent ophthalmic examination among cases. It is possible that the eyes of some cats in the control groups were not extensively examined and may have had uveitis. This difference between groups may be heightened as cats in group 1 were presented for ophthalmic disease and were examined by a board certified ophthalmologist, whereas those in groups 2 and 3 were not. In addition, the complete medical record was not available; therefore, the ophthalmic findings could not be used to accurately classify cats as having anterior uveitis, posterior uveitis, or panuveitis. Due to the association between flea infestation and B henselae, cats in this study were classified into high or low flea risk categories by geographic location (state) and it was shown that presence of Bartonella species antibodies was associated with high flea risk. However, knowledge of the physical presence of fleas would have been more accurate as flea prevalence can vary within states and can also be dependent upon the housing status of individual cats (indoor vs outdoor). Lastly, because there is serological cross-reactivity between B henselae and other Bartonella species, results of the antibody test in this study cannot be used to document specific exposure to B henselae. However, in most studies that have used culture or genetic sequencing to evaluate the Bartonella species causing feline infection in the United States, B henselae is the most common (Guptill et al 2004 , Lappin et al 2006 . Although most people that are exposed to B henselae are subclinically infected, cat scratch disease occurs in a small percentage. Cat scratch disease was estimated at 9.3 cases per 100,000 people per year in the United States (Jackson et al 1993) . Approximately 5e10% of people with cat scratch disease are reported to have ocular manifestations such as Parinaud's oculoglandular syndrome, optic neuritis, vitritis, retinitis or anterior uveitis (Ormerod and Dailey 1999, Wade et al 2000) . It is not known why some people develop ocular bartonellosis and others do not. It may relate to the host response to the organism (Resto-Ruiz et al 2003) . However, it also may relate to the strain of B henselae as it appears that some strains are more pathogenic than others (Woestyn et al 2004) . Co-infection with other agents may also play a role in some cases. However, cats experimentally coinfected with T gondii, B henselae, and FHV-1 did not develop ocular bartonellosis (Powell et al 2002) .",

Due to the high prevalence of serum antibodies in naturally exposed cats, it is difficult to determine how many cats develop clinical disease due to Bartonella species and it is difficult to confirm the diagnosis in individual cats. For example, in one study of clinically ill cats in North Carolina, multiple clinical syndromes were assessed for association with the presence of Bartonella species antibodies. No association was demonstrated for most abnormalities, including ocular disease (Breitschwerdt et al 2005) . These results indicate that, as with other causative agents of uveitis (eg, T gondii, coronaviruses, FHV-1), the presence of serum antibodies to B henselae does not correlate with the precise cause of the intraocular inflammation in individual cats (Peiffer and Wilcock 1991) . Confirmation of B henselae as the cause of uveitis has been attempted by locating the organism's DNA within the eye by PCR and by detecting local antibody production within the eye . As Bartonella species is an intraerythrocytic bacterium and most cats with uveitis have some degree of at least microscopic hyphema, the detection of B henselae DNA in aqueous humor does not prove ocular infection. In addition, the organism in erythrocytes could enter the eye via hemorrhage induced during anterior chamber paracentesis. Detection of local antibody production within the eye can be used as an indirect method of diagnosing local tissue infection and has been previously used with T gondii (Lappin et al 1992) , FHV-1 (Maggs et al 1999) , and B henselae . Further studies of this type are needed on greater numbers of cats with and without uveitis in order to determine if an epidemiologic association between B henselae and anterior uveitis exists. It is also possible that comparison of serum and aqueous humor B henselae antigen recognition patterns between cats with uveitis and those without ocular disease could identify improved diagnostic parameters (Freeland et al 1999) .",

Although there was overlap in the magnitude of serum titers and the median serum titers were identical (1:64) in all three groups, the healthy cats were more likely to have higher titers than cats with uveitis. These results suggest that Bartonella species antibody titer magnitude is unlikely to correlate with the presence of disease. Previous studies have found an increasing proportion of cats seropositive for Bartonella species with increasing age which may be related to an increased chance of exposure over time (Chomel et al 1995 , Guptill et al 2004 . In this study, the likelihood of being seropositive for Bartonella species decreased with increasing age. It is unclear why there are differences between these studies; they may merely be due to sample selection.
