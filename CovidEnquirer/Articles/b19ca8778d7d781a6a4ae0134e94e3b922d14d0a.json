Arsenic produces steroidogenic dysfunction in male rats and mice, which leads to infertility [5] [6] [7] [8] . Chronic arsenic exposure may have contributed to male infertility in Comarca Lagunera, Mexico [9] , impacted erectile function in a Taiwanese cohort [10] , and reduced semen quality in a Chinese cohort of reproductive age [11] . Oxidative stress reflects an imbalance between the systemic manifestation of reactive oxygen species and a biological system's ability to readily detoxify reactive intermediates and repair the resulting damage. Some reactive oxidative species C act as cellular messengers in redox signaling. Thus, oxidative stress can cause disruptions in normal mechanisms of cellular signaling. Disturbances in the normal redox state of cells can cause toxic effects through the production of peroxides and free radicals that damage all components of the cell, including proteins, lipids, and DNA. In humans, oxidative stress is thought to be involved in the development of cancer and Parkinson's disease. Chemically, oxidative stress is associated with increased production of oxidizing species or a significant decrease in the effectiveness of antioxidant defenses, such as glutathione. Oxidative injury is an important arsenic toxicity mechanism, which can be mediated by excess production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Furthermore, inorganic arsenic produces toxicity by binding protein thiol groups and non-protein thiols such as glutathione (GSH) [17] . Arsenic also regulates the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), glutathione reductase (GR), and catalase [18] . Proanthocyanidins are phenolic compounds found in fruits, vegetables, wine, tea, nuts, and seeds [19] [20] . Grape seed extract from Vitis species (grapevines) is a rich source of plant flavonoids and proanthocyanidin oligomers [21] [22] . Grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) is primarily composed of dimers, trimers, and highly polymerized oligomers of monomeric catechins [23] [24] , and has a protective effect on oxidant-induced extracellular matrix production [25] . There are no reports on the effects of GSPE on reproductive toxicity induced by arsenic in vivo.",

            "text": "Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) is a transcription factor that is encoded in humans by the NFE2L2 gene. Nrf2 is a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) protein that regulates the expression of antioxidant proteins that protect against oxidative damage triggered by injury and inflammation [26] . Several drugs that stimulate the Nrf2 pathway are being studied for treatment of diseases that are caused by oxidative stress. Under normal or unstressed conditions, Nrf2 is kept in the cytoplasm by a cluster of proteins, including Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) and Cullin3, which degrade Nrf2 by ubiquitination [27] [28] . Cullin3 ubiquitinates Nrf2 [28] , while Keap1 is a substrate adaptor that allows Cullin3 and Nrf2 to associate. Under oxidative stress, Nrf2 is not degraded, but instead travels to the nucleus, where it binds to DNA promoter regions and initiates transcription of antioxidative genes. When Nrf2 is ubiquitinated, it is transported to the proteasome, where it is degraded and its components are recycled. Under normal conditions, Nrf2 has a half-life of only 20 min. Oxidative stress or electrophilic stress disrupts critical cysteine residues in Keap1, preventing ubiquitination/ degradation by Keap1-Cul3. When Nrf2 is not ubiquitinated, it accumulates in the cytoplasm and translocates into the nucleus. In the nucleus, Nrf2 forms a heterodimer with a small Maf protein and binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE) in the upstream promoter region of many antioxidative genes, and thus initiates their transcription [29] . We hypothesized that GSPE would protect against arsenic-induced reproductive toxicity by counteracting oxidative injury via regulation of the Nrf2 pathway.",

SOD activity was determined by a hydroxylamine assay that was developed from a xanthine oxidase assay using chemical colorimetry. After the reaction, the absorbance at 560 nm was monitored using a spectrophotometer. The total antioxidative capacity (T-AOC) of the tissue homogenates was measured with a T-AOC analysis kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China). This kit utilized antioxidants in the samples to reduce Fe 3+ to Fe 2+ , which was chelated with porphyrin to produce a purple complex that was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 550 nm. The T-AOC of the samples was determined by comparison with the control standard. 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine in the testis tissue was assayed using a commercial enzymelinked immunosorbent assay kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Results were normalized to the total amount of protein as measured by bicinchoninic acid (BCA).",

Our study suggested that exposure to arsenic reduced the quality of sperm in mice, and substantial pathological changes were clearly observed in the testis after 5 weeks of exposure to ATO. The MDA and 8-OHdG levels in the group treated with ATO were higher than the corresponding levels in the control group, while the activity of GSH was reduced. This result showed that arsenic induced significant oxidative damage in the testis.

Few reports have focused on the relationship between GSPE and the Nrf2 signaling pathway. It has been suggested that activation of the transcription factor Nrf2 elicits a cellular defense system that detoxifies drugs and environmental pollutants [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] , and the components of this system include glutamate-cysteine ligase [composed of the glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC) and the glutamate-cysteine ligase regulatory subunit (GCLM)], GST, NQO1, and HO1. This study showed that GSPE administration increased the mRNA expression levels of Nrf2, GST, HO1, and NQO1 in comparison with the control group, which suggested that GSPE activated Nrf2 signaling. Furthermore, GSPE significantly decreased MDA and 8-OHdG levels, and increased GSH activity. Based on these measured parameters and coordinated mRNA expression of Nrf2 signaling pathway components after GPSE exposure, our findings in mice suggest that GSPE activates Nrf2 signaling, which alleviates oxidative stress damage in the testis, and thus counteracts arsenic-induced reproductive toxicity. Future research should be performed with mice lacking the Nrf2 gene to validate the role of Nrf2 signaling in the effects of GSPE on arsenic-induced reproductive toxicity.",
