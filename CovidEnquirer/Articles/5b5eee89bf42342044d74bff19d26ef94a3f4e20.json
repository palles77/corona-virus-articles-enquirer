            "text": "The burden of diseases caused by food-borne pathogens remains largely unknown. Importantly data indicating trends in food-borne infectious intestinal disease is limited to a few industrialised countries, and even fewer pathogens. It has been predicted that the importance of diarrhoeal disease, mainly due to contaminated food and water, as a cause of death will decline worldwide. Evidence for such a downward trend is limited. This prediction presumes that improvements in the production and retail of microbiologically safe food will be sustained in the developed world and, moreover, will be rolled out to those countries of the developing world increasingly producing food for a global market. In this review evidence is presented to indicate that the microbiological safety of food remains a dynamic situation heavily influenced by multiple factors along the food chain from farm to fork. Sustaining food safety standards will depend on constant vigilance maintained by monitoring and surveillance but, with the rising importance of other food-related issues, such as food security, obesity and climate change, competition for resources in the future to enable this may be fierce. In addition the pathogen populations relevant to food safety are not static. Food is an excellent vehicle by which many pathogens (bacteria, viruses/prions and parasites) can reach an appropriate colonisation site in a new host. Although food production practices change, the well-recognised food-borne pathogens, such as Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli, seem able to evolve to exploit novel opportunities, for example fresh produce, and even generate new public health challenges, for example antimicrobial resistance. In addition, previously unknown food-borne pathogens, many of which are zoonotic, are constantly emerging. Current understanding of the trends in food-borne diseases for bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens has been reviewed. The bacterial pathogens are exemplified by those well-recognized by policy makers; i.e. Salmonella, Campylobacter, E. coli and Listeria monocytogenes. Antimicrobial resistance in several bacterial food-borne pathogens (Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella and Vibrio spp., methicillin resistant Staphylcoccus aureas, E. coli and Enterococci) has been discussed as a separate topic because of its relative importance to policy issues. Awareness and surveillance of viral food-borne pathogens is generally poor but emphasis is placed on Norovirus, Hepatitis A, rotaviruses and newly emerging viruses such as SARS. Many foodborne parasitic pathogens are known (for example Ascaris, Cryptosporidia and Trichinella) but few of these are effectively monitored in foods, livestock and wildlife and their epidemiology through the food-chain is poorly understood. The lessons learned and future challenges in each topic are debated. It is clear that one overall challenge is the generation and maintenance of constructive dialogue and collaboration between public health, veterinary and food safety experts, bringing together multidisciplinary skills and multi-pathogen expertise. Such collaboration is essential to monitor changing trends in the well-recognised diseases and detect emerging pathogens. It will also be necessary understand the multiple interactions these pathogens have with their environments during transmission along the food chain in order to develop effective prevention and control strategies.",

In contrast, resources for emerging foodborne diseases have tended to be allocated in an incident driven manner, i.e. in response to the extent of perceived emerging health threat (for example BSE). In an attempt to reduce disease burden, the monitoring of food-borne diseases and pathogens in the food chain has been implemented and a farm-to-fork approach has been adopted encouraging all sectors of the food production chain to improve hygiene and actively incorporate structured approaches to food safety, such as HACCP principles. Underlying such industry-based changes has been an enormous research effort leading to the generation of improved methods for the diagnosis of intestinal disease and the detection of food-borne pathogens. Over the last 20 years this research has also used modern technology to generate genome sequences, identify pathogenic mechanisms, provide evidence-based risk assessments for policy development and even develop some effective intervention strategies such as vaccines for food-producing animals or post-harvest treatments. With all this input, a substantial downwards trend in food-borne disease, should be expected. However, evidence from disease surveillance for such a positive impact remains sparse.",

Comprehensive diagnostic studies of intestinal infectious diseases (see for example Tompkins et al., 1999) , indicate that between 50 and 60% of all causative agents are unidentified. In addition, gastrointestinal illnesses caused by toxin producing bacteria, such as Bacillus cereus, are almost certainly underestimated due to lack of diagnostic tools. The only certainty is that the list of agents of infectious intestinal disease will continue to grow as new microbes are recognised and as food processing and eating habits change. Before 1960 the major causes of gastrointestinal disease were recognised as Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Clostridium botulinum and Staphylococcus aureus. During the 1960s Clostridium perfringens, and B. cereus were added and then in the 1970s, rotavirus and norovirus. In the 1980s and 1990s there was a flurry of additions including Campylobacter, Yersinia, Listeria monocytogenes, new strains of Escherichia coli such as O157:H7, Cryptosporidia and Cyclospora. It seems highly probable that new food-borne pathogens will be discovered in the 21st century. Many of these will be zoonotic in origin given that such pathogens are twice as likely to cause new and emerging diseases than non-zoonotic agents. In addition, already known pathogens can evolve thereby adding to the public health risks. For example zoonotic food-borne bacteria are increasingly becoming resistant to antimicrobials.",

These improvements have been implemented by international standards and legislation, and are considered to have had an impact on diarrhoeal incidence as reflected in trends reported worldwide (http://www.who.int/whr/2008/whr08_en.pdf). A continued decline in diarrhoeal disease as a cause of death, particularly in the young, is a prediction of the WHO. Such a prediction presumes that the situation regarding food safety will not only be maintained but will be rolled out into those areas of the world increasingly responsible for global food production. However, regardless of the improvements in production, processing and monitoring along the food-chain, few food-borne pathogens, if any, appear to have been successfully contained. Even with the extensive campaign undertaken towards the control of BSE, this disease is still being detected in cattle (www. oie.int/eng/info/en_esbru.htm).

The effectiveness of such a strategy for the success of this agent is remarkable. Intervention against S. enteritidis PT4 in the form of hygiene interventions, including the culling of infected flocks using a \"topdown\" approach and vaccination, first of breeder flocks and then of layers. This significantly reduced egg-associated infections during the late 1990s in several European countries but from 2000 there has been further increase in salmonellosis, this time with non-PT4 strains, including PT1, PT14B and PT21. Outbreak data, coupled with extensive laboratory investigations, has suggested that at least some of these strains are once again associated with egg contamination.

It is tempting to consider that interventions introduced to prevent and control campylobacteriosis have had an effect. Certainly since the early 1980s enormous effort has gone into identifying and controlling the sources of infection. This effort has been largely focussed on the poultry industry as Campylobacter contamination of poultry meat from colonised chickens is considered the major source. National strategic plans have been adopted in several countries targeted at the on-farm, processing and kitchen hygiene levels. However, there are no available consistent interventions to prevent or reduce poultry infection on the farm and the implementation of available post-harvest interventions, such as use of hyper-chlorinated water washes, has been limited (for example in Europe, by legislation). To date a few, mainly Scandinavian (particularly Iceland and Norway), countries have managed to substantially reduce poultry flock prevalence, which has allowed the separation and post-harvest treatment of broiler meat from positive flocks to be economically viable. In New Zealand the focus has been on postharvest interventions mainly by the introduction of hyper-chlorinated water washes and targets for carcass contamination. Surveillance in these countries suggests that such major strategic efforts can be effective, but only in part. The reason for this is unclear but may indicate that other sources are also important.",

This is susceptible to point mutations and genomic instability and can readily take up foreign DNA. This results in an enormously diverse population of types regardless of which typing system is used. Nevertheless, it is now clear that some stable clones of C. jejuni have persisted over time and distance (Manning et al., 2001) , and such clones may provide insight on changing trends.

Such outbreaks increased dramatically and became widespread in the following years. It has been estimated that in the United States, E. coli O157:H7 causes 73,000 illnesses and 250 deaths annually. The first recognized community outbreak of O157:H7 in Europe occurred in the United Kingdom in the summer of 1985 and further outbreaks and sporadic cases have been reported throughout Europe ever since. In England and Wales, 33% of outbreaks are food-borne (Gillespie et al., 2005) . In the early outbreaks the sources were most often found to be contaminated beef meat, often minced, and the organism is widespread in the guts of asymptomatic cattle. As a reflection of the seriousness of such outbreaks, extensive legislation, new food handling practices and food-producer education have been introduced and implemented over the last 20 years. Despite these, large outbreaks still occur mainly due to producer incompetence; most recently an outbreak among schoolchildren in south Wales in 2005 involved 157 cases, with the death of a five year old school boy (http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/6983113.stm). Professor Pennington, who chaired the subsequent enquiry, stated \"The requirements for food hygiene that were in place at the time of the Outbreak should have been sufficient to prevent it.\" (http://wales.gov. uk/ecoliinquiry/?lang=en). So it seems that even though lessons have been learnt, and processes changed accordingly, outbreaks cannot be avoided. Also, importantly, risk factor studies indicate a shift from contaminated meat products towards environmental transmission in some countries, such as via contact with farm animals or gardening (Coia et al., 1998) . This could constitute major future challenges for public health interventions of this potentially serious disease.",

MRSA has recently also become a zoonotic issue following detection in various companion and foodproducing animals, including horses, dogs, cats, pigs, cattle, chickens, rabbits, seals, and birds. A particular MRSA strain, so-called NT (\"nontypeable\" by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis) MRSA or sequence type (ST) 398 (by MLST), has increasingly been isolated from pigs and pig farmers. Currently an EU-wide baseline study of the prevalence of MRSA in breeder pigs is ongoing to better understand the epidemiology of this emerging strain in Europe. A recent Dutch study showed that MRSA can be detected at very low concentrations (<10 cfu/g) in unheated meats from various domestic animals and fowl. This survey indicated that the overall prevalence of MRSA was 11.9% of 2217 retail samples of raw meat, with highest prevalence in poultry meat. For all meat types, the MRSA strains were predominantly (85%) of the NT ST398 type (de Boer et al., 2009) . Thus, other livestock may be a significant source of MRSA. Nevertheless, it is currently unclear to what degree the MRSA types in animals, and in particular the emerging clone ST398, are food safety, or even public health, risks.",

This is acknowledged by various international organizations, such as the WHO, OIE, FAO, and the EC, as well as professional associations and national authorities. Such prudence will not only safeguard the efficacy of antimicrobial drugs in veterinary medicine, but importantly, will prevent the emergence and spread of undesirable resistance phenotypes in pathogens and commensal bacteria transmissible between animals and humans, including via food. In particular the use of antimicrobial agents for growth promotion should not be allowed because it enhances the development and spread of antimicrobial resistance. Consequently the EU banned the use of all growth promoters from 1st January 2006. Outside the EU, the situation differs. For instance Norway does not allow use of antimicrobial agents for growth promotion, whereas the policy in United States remains liberal. An appropriate regulatory system for the approval and licensing of antimicrobial agents is an important aspect of the prudent use of antimicrobials. Antimicrobials should be available on prescription-only. Interestingly, profit by the veterinarian from the sale of antimicrobial agents, seems to negatively impact on prescribing practices (Grave and Wegener, 2006) , therefore regulatory systems should prevent practitioners receiving payment for prescribing antimicrobials in order to prevent misuse and overuse of antimicrobial agents.",

Before initiating antimicrobial therapy, the practitioner should ascertain that such therapy is justified. Empirical use of antimicrobials should be avoided whenever possible and antimicrobials should be preferably prescribed on the basis of laboratory diagnosis and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. When antimicrobial therapy is initiated, it is important to choose the appropriate antimicrobial product and administration route. Ideally, only diseased animals should be treated, and the treatment should be as individual as possible. However, in the case of poultry and farmed fish this is not practical, and mass-treatment is accepted following a relevant diagnosis. Metaphylaxis, where clinically healthy animals are treated along with their diseased \"neighbours\", should be avoided. Prophylaxis should be minimised. Local treatment should be preferred to systemic treatment when the infection is localized and accessible to topical products. Consideration should be given to the potential public health consequences of resistance to the antimicrobial in question. In general, narrow-spectrum (and older) antimicrobials, if appropriate and available, should be preferred to broad-spectrum drugs. Furthermore, veterinarians should only prescribe antimicrobial formulations that are approved for the species and the indication concerned.

            "text": "\u25cb Viruses do not grow in food: Viruses need living cells to replicate, and almost all food-borne viruses are strictly human pathogens. This means that the transmission via food reflects faecal contamination, with the persistence of viruses on or in the product, but no replication. Zoonotic viruses such as hepatitis E or tick-borne encephalitis virus may also be present without fecal contamination in animal products such as pig liver or cow's milk, but again will not replicate without living cells. Given the numerous reports of norovirus outbreaks in association with bivalve molluscan shellfish, the possibility of virus replication has been considered, but there is no evidence. \u25cb Most food-borne viruses are (very) infectious, spreading rapidly from one individual to the next: For the most common food-borne viruses, only a few infectious particles (10-100) may result in a high probability of infection, whereas very high loads of viruses may be shed in stool samples of infected individuals (10 6-7 per gram of stool or more). Therefore, unless the initial cases in a food-borne transmission are detected, the event may present as a person-to-person outbreak that will not be attributed to food as a source of the infection. \u25cb There is no systematic surveillance for food-borne viral disease: There is a range of clinical syndromes associated with different foodborne viruses. Noroviruses, astroviruses, and rotaviruses for instance cause acute gastro-enteritis with vomiting and diarrhoea, whereas hepatitis A and E viruses may cause hepatitis that can be recognized by the development of abdominal pains and jaundice (Table 1) . Enteroviruses may cause a range of clinical syndromes, varying from diarrhoea to meningitis and rash illnesses. Most countries have some level of reporting of food-borne illness outbreaks, but few of these systems include viral food-borne illness. Case-based surveillance exists for hepatitis A and enteroviruses, but is not usually focused on detecting food-borne transmission as a source of the infection. As a result, national statistics on food-borne viral disease are not easily available and, where present, likely to reflect significant under-reporting. In the UK, for each case recorded in the national surveillance system, an estimated 136 cases are present in the community (O'Brien, 2008) . Food-borne transmission has been documented for viruses belonging to at least 11 known families. Noroviruses and hepatitis A food-borne illnesses have most frequently been documented, but several other viruses have also been identified as food-borne (Table 1 ) Koopmans and Duizer, 2004) . All these viruses are capable of infecting a host following oral ingestion, and need to be able to pass the stomach and those proximal parts of the small intestine with contents that are rich in digestive enzymes and bile salts. Therefore, the viruses associated with food-borne transmission are typically non-enveloped particles that are stable outside the host and consequently should remain infectious in the environment or on food. However, Nipah virus and tick-borne encephalitis viruses, for instance, have lipid envelopes and, therefore, probably have a reduced stability. Nevertheless, these viruses have been associated with foodborne infection (Luby et al., 2006; Kr\u00edz et al., 2009) .",

Further details for each combination are given below.",

            "text": "\u25cb Noroviruses and hepatitis A in bivalve molluscan shellfish: Outbreaks of norovirus illness and hepatitis A following consumption of bivalve molluscan shellfish have been extensively documented (i.e. Le Guyader et al., 2006) . The consensus is that the consumption of shellfish is associated world-wide with an increased risk of viral infection. Although there is no systematic surveillance data for shellfish harvesting areas, where this is done, virus contamination is found with a high frequency due to regular sewage contamination. Often multiple viruses are present in contaminated shellfish, adding the extra risk to consumption of simultaneous ingestion and infection with two related viruses possibly resulting in the mixing of viral genes to generate new, recombinant viruses. This is a process for which the outcome, in terms of pathogenicity and behaviour of the progeny viruses, is unpredictable and therefore, from a virological point of view, highly undesirable. The clinical impacts of noroviruses and hepatitis A are quite different: noroviruses illness can be prevalent but cause relatively mild gastro-enteritis whereas hepatitis caused by hepatitis A virus is less common but can have serious consequences. In addition, for hepatitis A virus the risk is increasing as improved hygiene levels mean fewer, asymptomatic childhood infections occur and the proportion of immune individuals in the population is declining. Consequently the potential for outbreaks and illness is increasing in unvaccinated individuals. Prevention through vaccination is recommended for food-handlers (Atreya, 2004) . \u25cb Noroviruses and hepatitis A in fresh produce: Noroviruses and hepatitis A virus are also well documented in fresh produce, with large outbreaks (often international) reported related to the consumption of contaminated berries and green onions (Le Guyader et al., 2004; Wheeler et al., 2005) . The suspected source of contamination in these cases is presumed to be polluted irrigation water. Although this is plausible, conclusive evidence is lacking and there is remarkably little knowledge of the exact growing conditions for these products produced for the international market. \u25cb Noroviruses and hepatitis A in prepared foods: Arguably the majority of food-borne viral illness results from the contamination of foods by food-handlers shedding viruses. Any contaminated food items, not treated in a manner that will inactivate the viruses after handling (e.g. by cooking), are potential sources of infection. The evidence for such modes of transmission is extensive; often associating outbreaks with clear breaches of hygiene codes. Unsurprisingly a risk factor analysis for norovirus gastro-enteritis in a large community-based study in The Netherlands found a correlation between the increasing rate of infection and decreasing kitchen hygiene (de Wit et al., 2003) . The study also estimated that 10-15% of noroviruses cases were attributable to food contamination. Whether this reflects the attributable risk elsewhere is currently unknown. \u25cb Rotaviruses in water used for food preparation: Group A rotaviruses are the most common cause of hospitalization for diarrhoeal disease in infants and are globally responsible for a significant number of deaths, particularly in non-industrialized countries. While the burden of rotavirus illness has been extensively mapped across the world, very little attention has been paid to identifying the potential modes of transmission other than person-to-person spread. Given the young age at which rotaviruses have the greatest impact, the use of powdered milk reconstituted with poor quality water, seems a likely source. Evidence for this has been difficult to obtain. Bottle-feeding has been identified as a risk factor for rotavirus infection in young children (Duffy et al., 1986) , but this could also be explained by the lack of immune protection acquired from breast-feeding, rather than the consumption of contaminated milk. \u25cb Emerging viruses in selected commodities: Outbreaks associated with food-borne transmission of newly emerging viruses are a low probability event but have a potentially high impact. The examples of SARS and avian influenza, and the relatively uncontrolled foodborne transmission of less dangerous viruses, illustrate that, should a novel pathogen with efficient food-borne transmission arise, we are likely to be ill prepared to handle such an event.",

Such detection largely depends on molecular techniques, because culture is either difficult (hepatitis A) or even impossible (noroviruses). Such methods are confounded by challenges like viral evolution leading to the requirement for new PCR primers, focal sources like food handlers, or relatively low concentrations of target. Nevertheless, significant progress has been achieved in some foods such as shellfish and for outbreak investigations. However, the results can lead to confusion because virus-positive foods may comply with regulations based on the testing of coliforms. Thus foods may pass regulatory requirements on the basis of bacterial content but still constitute a public health risk because of the presence of pathogenic viruses. Moreover, results from food testing and patient testing may be discordant due to the presence of multiple strains and PCR-based detection may be disputed because it does not provide information about the viability of the target organism. Clearly, future guidance is needed on the use of molecular-based virus detection methods.",

There is now ample documentation that these criteria are insufficient to protect from viral food-borne infections, and that the burden of food-borne viral illness is significant. It is important to understand the fundamental differences between viral and bacterial pathogens in order to design improved strategies capable of controlling both classes of pathogens. Strategies to prevent viral food-borne disease should focus on primary prevention of contamination of food early in the food chain, for example, by regulating the standards for irrigation water.

It is certainly lower than in developing countries, because of the accompanying features of poverty i.e. lack of sanitation and control measures, malnutrition, illiteracy and overcrowding. Nevertheless, most food-borne parasites have a worldwide distribution. Even in developed countries estimating the risk of food contamination is often difficult due to the lack of awareness of (public) health professionals and research in this field. The relatively mild or non-specific symptoms, long incubation periods, and unavailable or inadequate laboratory methods, which are typical for parasitic diseases, contribute to under diagnosis of infection. Therefore, accurate data on the incidence, sources and transmission routes of human parasitic infection and illness is scarce and often based on infrequentlyrecognized outbreaks.",

The emergence of such environmental reservoirs probably resulted in the first autochthonous human case diagnosed in 2008. However, little is known about human risk factors because of the long incubation time (5-15 years) but raw vegetables and fruit contaminated with eggs of this parasite are often proposed as one of the transmission routes to humans (Kern et al., 2004) .",

Traditionally, intrinsic parasitic food-borne infections are controlled at the end of the meat production chain, e.g. the monitoring of individual swine carcasses to control and prevent trichinellosis in humans. It has been shown that these measures are inefficient and largely ineffective in industrialised animal husbandry systems (Pozio, 1998) . Modern food production requires a risk-based approach in which several critical control points are monitored. Parasite-free farming implies strict indoor housing of animals including pest control, proper feed preparation and storage, and general hygienic measures. Such an approach is effective to prevent Trichinella infections in swine and might also be effective to prevent other food-borne infections such as Toxoplasma. However, the current trend is for more extensive (outdoor) livestock rearing to comply with increasing public demand for management practices to improve animal welfare. Such free-ranging livestock, in close contact with both the environment and wildlife, constitutes an emerging risk for parasitic infections (Van der Giessen et al., 2007) .",

One control strategy under consideration is interference with the often complex life cycle of the parasite. For example, Toxoplasma gondii is a ubiquitous parasite using almost all warm-blooded vertebrates as hosts, including humans. Humans can become infected by ingestion of oocysts, excreted by cats, via contaminated soil or water, or foods. A second means of transmission is the ingestion of tissue cysts present in raw or undercooked meat or meat products from so-called intermediate hosts (e.g. sheep and cattle). Even vertical transmission can occur, from mother to child, when women become infected during pregnancy. However, cats are the only definitive hosts for Toxoplasma, responsible for shedding oocysts into the environment. Effective vaccination and/or treatment of cats in order to prevent shedding of oocysts would break the cycle and reduce environmental contamination.",

Each category has its unique challenges but surprisingly many common factors have become apparent. Over millennia, all food-borne pathogens have developed efficient and effective strategies, which exploit, wholly or in part, food as a vehicle to transfer from one human host gut to another, or from an animal to a human. The mechanisms involved are complex and varied but all are able to survive intervening periods in the environment, and then avoid the human innate gut defenses to colonize and multiply rapidly before enabling effective dispersal, frequently through fluid feces, back into the environment to progress again through the cycle. Each of these pathogens occupies a unique ecological niche in this foodrelated cycle.",

For parasitic infections estimation of the disease burden is often complicated by a lack of reliable data, as a result of under-diagnosis and the lack of monitoring programmes. So far, DALYs estimations for parasitic infections in the Netherlands are only available for toxoplasmosis, cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis. Nevertheless, it has been shown that the disease burden of congenital toxoplasmosis alone (around 620 DALYs per year) is similar to that of Salmonella spp. (670 DALYs per year)(Havelaar et al., 2007) while the disease burden for Giardia lamblia (364 DALYs) is comparable to those for rota-and corona-viruses. The disease burden of cryptosporidiosis is considerably lower (123 DALYs) (http://rivm.openrepository.com/rivm/bitstream/10029/ 16471/1/330081001.pdf). It should be noted that the information on the clinical presentation and the attribution for the calculation of DALY's in The Netherlands is still uncertain for all three parasites, nevertheless, these numbers demonstrate that parasitic infections are equally important to major food-borne bacterial and viral infections. Obviously, not all cases are related to food, as there are other routes of transmission. Unfortunately, the source of infection is rarely identified because of delays in diagnosis. Therefore, the attribution of the different potential sources to human infections is poorly understood. For acute Toxoplasma infection in pregnant women, a European casecontrol study to identify risk factors has shown that the majority of infections were food-borne. Between 30% and 63% of the infections were attributed to the consumption of undercooked or cured meat, whereas only 6% to 17% were attributed to soil contact",
