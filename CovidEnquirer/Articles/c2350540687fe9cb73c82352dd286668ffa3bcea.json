PIP-binding motifs of cellular proteins do not exist in viral proteins. Moleculardocking simulations revealed a putative site of PIP binding to poliovirus (PV) 3C protein that was validated using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The PIP-binding site was located on a highly dynamic a helix, which also functions in RNA binding. Broad PIP-binding activity was observed in solution using a fluorescence polarization assay or in the context of a lipid bilayer using an on-chip, fluorescence assay. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the 3C protein-membrane interface revealed PIP clustering and perhaps PIP-dependent conformations. PIP clustering was mediated by interaction with residues that interact with the RNA phosphodiester backbone. We conclude that 3C binding to membranes will be determined by PIP abundance. We suggest that the duality of function observed for 3C may extend to RNA-binding proteins of other viruses.",

Before 2010, conventional wisdom was that an interaction between a viral protein and a cellular protein associated with viral-induced membranes accomplished this task. Interactions between viral proteins would then recruit the full complement of the genome-replication machinery. In 2010, Altan-Bonnet and colleagues discovered that a picornavirus induced the synthesis of the phosphoinositide, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P), and showed that PI4P tracked with sites of genome replication (Hsu et al., 2010) . This observation inspired the hypothesis that a cellular lipid rather than a cellular protein might be the lure used to recruit viral proteins (Hsu et al., 2010) .",

Proteins destined for a specific cellular membrane will encode a PIP-binding determinant specific for one or a few PIPs. The most extensively characterized PIP-binding determinant is from phospholipase C (PLC), the so-called pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. This PH domain interacts with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P 2 ) specifically (Harlan et al., 1994) . In addition to sorting, PH and related domains can be used to maintain an enzymatic activity in a latent state until the PH domain is engaged by the appropriate PIP, thus restricting enzyme activation to the appropriate subcellular compartment (Balla, 2013; van Meer et al., 2008) .

The retroviral matrix protein (MA) binds to PI(4,5)P 2 , which acts as a switch, promoting interaction with membrane and virus assembly (Chukkapalli et al., 2010; Saad et al., 2006) . Ebola virus virion protein, VP40, also links PI(4,5) P 2 binding to virus assembly (Johnson et al., 2016) .

The results from computation were validated empirically by using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The PIP-binding site overlaps the well-established RNA-binding site of PV 3C (Amero et al., 2008) . We characterized the PIP-binding specificity of 3C in a soluble system as well as in the context of a lipid bilayer. Both approaches revealed broad, yet specific, binding to a combination of mono-, bis-, or tris-phosphorylated phosphoinositides. Binding of PV 3C to PIPs and RNA was mutually exclusive. Allatom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of 3C interacting with PI4P-or PI(4,5)P 2 -containing membranes revealed PIP clustering and a multivalent interaction with 3C. The conformation of 3C on the membrane was modulated by the nature of the bound PIP, perhaps regulating 3C function. This model for the interaction of PV 3C with a lipid bilayer suggests that the localization of 3C domain-containing proteins is driven by PIP abundance rather than the specificity of the PIP-binding domain. The versatile use of an RNA-binding surface of a PV protein for PIP binding as well may suggest a similar duality of function in related RNA-binding proteins of other RNA viruses.",

Once excited by plane-polarized light, the unbound form of the fluorescent ligand depolarizes the emitted light due to its small size and rapid rotation. In contrast, the bound form of the fluorescent ligand has a larger molecular volume, which reduces the rotation such that the emitted light remains in the same plane as that used for excitation for a longer period of time ( Figure 3A ). This approach was validated by using the PLC-d1 PH domain as a positive control, which showed PI(4,5)P 2 binding specificity, as expected ( Figure S1 ) (Harlan et al., 1994) .",

Reported affinities of 3C for RNA are in the low micromolar range , which is on par with that for PIPs. Therefore, it is likely that RNA-and PIP-binding activities of 3C will compete. To test this possibility directly, we used the FP assay to ask if the polarization of a 3C-RNA (3 0 -fluorescently labeled RNA) could be displaced by water-soluble dibutyl-PI(4,5)P 2 ( Figure 3G ). We observed a concentrationdependent reduction in polarization ( Figure 3H ), which required PIP binding for displacement as dibutyl-PI exhibited no effect on RNA binding ( Figure 3H ). We also performed an NMR-based competition experiment. Because dibutyl-PI(4,5)P 2 caused precipitation during the NMR experiment, dibutyl-PI4P was used instead. We monitored residues that were implicated in PIP (A) Two clusters were identified by docking dibutyl-PI4P (red spheres) on 3C surface (gray ribbon). The major cluster (94% of the trials) encompasses residues K12, R13, and R84; the minor cluster (6% of the trials) encompasses residues K108 and R143. One hundred docking runs were performed. The crystal structure of 3C (PDB: 1L1N) was obtained from the PDB (Mosimann et al., 1997) . The structure of the PI4P ligand was prepared by modifying the structure of PI(4,5)P 2 , extracted from the NMR complex structure of HIV-1 matrix protein bound to PI(4,5)P 2 (Saad et al., 2006) . Phosphates on the inositol head group are depicted as red spheres; basic residues in the major and minor clusters are depicted as sticks. (B) Multiple-sequence alignment of enteroviral 3C proteins shows that the majority of the residues predicted by docking (K12, R13, R84, and R143) and/or the basic charge are conserved; K108 is not conserved (colored in blue).

To address this question, we employed a pH-modulation assay to monitor protein binding to a planar-supported lipid bilayer (SLB) in a microfluidic device (Jung et al., 2009; Shengjuler et al., 2017) . The SLB is a stable model membrane system, and the composition of the membrane can be easily tailored to probe interactions of specific lipids with proteins. The SLB used here employed three lipids, the structures of which are illustrated in Figure 4A . A pH-sensitive dye, ortho-sulforhodamine B-POPE (oSRB-POPE), is embedded into the SLB and used to probe protein binding by detecting changes in the local electric field ( Figure 4B ). Upon binding of 3C, which is positively charged at the experimental pH, the interfacial potential increases and more hydroxide ions are recruited locally. As a result, the fluorescence signal decreases (Figures 4B and S2) .",

We performed experiments in the presence of Mg 2+ divalent cations to better mimic the cellular environment. 3C did not bind to pure POPC membranes ( Figure 4C ). The addition of PI4P to the POPC membrane revealed the capacity of 3C to bind to this mono-phosphorylated PIP ( Figure 4C ). The value for the K D,app was 2.4 \u00b1 0.2 mM ( Table 1 ). The higher affinity of PI4P in the setting of the membrane may be a reflection of PIP clustering. In addition to PI4P, 3C bound to POPC membranes containing PI3P and PI(4,5)P 2 , all with essentially the same affinity (Table 1) . PIP binding to 3C in the context of a membrane also required the phosphates because PI binding was weak (Table 1) . Worth noting, PI binding did occur when compared with POPC alone; however, we were unable to produce a complete binding isotherm because of the extremely high concentration of protein required. The presence of PI will produce a net negative charge on the membrane, so the interaction with the basic surface of 3C makes sense. To test the possibility that negative charge alone can promote binding of 3C to the membrane, we performed an experiment in a membrane containing 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-snglycero-3-phospho-L-serine (POPS). The presence of POPS will also produce a net negative charge on the membrane. The affinity of 3C for the POPS-containing membrane was on par with that observed for the PI-containing membrane (Table 1) .",

The simulation was run for 400 ns, and the last 300 ns of the trajectory was used for analysis. A run time of 400 ns is likely insufficient to obtain a converged simulation, so the orientations and cluster sizes observed here may represent only a snapshot on a path to the fully equilibrated state. The major findings of the simulation are illustrated in Figure 5 . Binding yields low polarization value due to its small size and rapid rotation. In contrast, the bound form yields a higher polarization value due to the overall size of the complex and its slow rotation. (B) PIP-binding specificity of 3C. 3C binds to both bis-and tris-phosphorylated PIP species. Error bars represent the SEM (n = 3). (C-F) WT 3C and 3C variants (C): K12L (D), R13L (E), and R84L (F) bind to PI(4,5)P 2 with varying affinities.

(G) The principles of the FP-based competition assay. 3C-RNA (fluorescently labeled 11-mer) complex is pre-formed, which yields a high polarization value. As the unlabeled dibutyl-PI(4,5)P 2 competes out the bound RNA, the mP value decreases. (H) FP-based competition experiments. The unlabeled PI(4,5)P 2 efficiently competes out the bound RNA, suggesting that these interactions are mutually exclusive. The competition experiment with PI competitor is used to show that binding to 3C is required for RNA displacement. Error bars represent the SEM (n = 3). (I) NMR-based competition experiments. 3C only (black); 3C-RNA complex (blue); 3C-PI4P complex (red). Changes in the direction of K12, R13, and R84 resonances (green arrow) in 2D space suggest that RNA and PIP interactions are mutually exclusive. of 3C induced clustering of at least five PIP molecules in the bilayer, independent of the nature of the PIP used ( Figures 5A  and 5B ). Although the same residues of 3C were used to interact with both PIPs, the orientation of 3C differed slightly when bound to PI4P compared with that bound to PI(4,5)P 2 (Figures 5A and 5B). For reference, residues of the protease active site have been indicated by black spheres. The orientation of the active site in Figure 5A is clearly different than observed in Figure 5B . This analysis expanded the number of residues interacting with PIP head groups to include residues in regions observed by NMR, for example D32, K156, and R176 (Figures 5A and 5B). Interestingly, the contribution of D32 to 3C-PIP interface was mediated by two Na 1+ ions in the case of PI4P ( Figure 5A ), and one Na 1+ ion in the case of PI(4,5)P 2 ( Figure 5B ). A surface representation of 3C interacting with PIPs in the context of the membrane showed that 3C is propelled above the membrane by the head groups ( Figures 5C and 5D ). The N terminus of 3C was an exception. Rotation of 3C to bring the N terminus into view showed that the N terminus has a more substantive interaction with the outer leaflet of the bilayer, albeit of a non-specific nature ( Figures 5E and 5F ). The conformation and interaction of the N terminus with membrane was also influenced by the PIP present ( Figures 5E and 5F ). The residues involved in the dominant membrane contacts belong to the few segments that contain K12, R13, R84, and adjacent residues ( Figure S3 ). If clustering actually occurs, then the apparent dissociation constant should be sensitive to the mole fraction of PI4P or PI(4,5)P 2 present. As shown in Figure S4 for PI4P, our data are consistent with a large reduction in apparent binding affinity when the mole fraction of PI4P is reduced.",

            "text": "For the N-terminal residues of 3C to exhibit such conformational flexibility and diverse interactions with membranes, the solution behavior would have to be more dynamic than predicted by the crystal structure (Mosimann et al., 1997) . To evaluate the solution behavior of 3C, we performed small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments. Figure 6A shows the scaled scattering profiles of 3C at concentrations ranging from 3.2 to 13.0 mg/mL. The overlap of the scaled curves at the low ends of scattering angles was consistent with the protein remaining monomeric over this concentration range in agreement with the NMR and dynamic light scattering studies (Chan et al., 2016) . The scattering data at the low-angle end showed a linear correlation, satisfying the Guinier approximation (qR g < 1.3), from which we determined a radius of gyration (R g ) of 17.26 \u00c5 ( Figure 6A ). The R g derived from the Guinier approximation was in good agreement with that estimated from the pair-distance distribution function P(r) calculated by GNOM (real-space R g = 17.72 \u00c5 , reciprocal-space R g = 17.76 \u00b1 0.13 \u00c5 ) ( Figure 6B ). From the calculated P(r), the maximum particle dimension of the protein was estimated to be 65 \u00c5 ( Figure 6B ). The asymmetric shape of the distribution function suggested the presence of a tail in the solution structure of 3C. The values of R g and D max from SAXS data also suggested that the protein exists as a monomer in solution. Furthermore, the estimated molecular mass of 22.2 \u00b1 0.9 kDa (derived from Porod volume) or 20.5 \u00b1 1.1 kDa (derived from SAXS MoW calculation) was in very good agreement with the calculated molecular mass of a monomer (19.6 kDa).",

As shown in Figure 6C , both structures agreed well with the experimental data. However, the calculated curve from the average MD structure showed a slightly better fitting to the SAXS data relative to the crystal structure (c = 1.57 for crystal structure versus c = 1.47 for MD structure). Next, we built the ab initio low-resolution SAXS model using DAMMIN and DAMMIF programs; ten independent models from each program were generated and averaged. The models were highly similar; the average values of the normalized spatial discrepancy (NSD), which represents the similarity among the models, were 0.563 \u00b1 0.010 and 0.698 \u00b1 0.064 for DAMMIN and DAMMIF (B) Schematic diagram illustrating the principles of the SLB-binding experiment. In the absence of 3C, the fluorescent probe is in its ''on state'' (left). Upon binding to the membrane, the interfacial potential is increased, causing the fluorescent probe to switch to its ''off state'' (right). The pH-response curve of the fluorescent probe in a bilayer containing 92 mol% POPC, 7.5 mol% PI4P, and 0.5 mol% oSRB-POPE is shown. (C) 3C binding to PI4P-containing SLBs. Change in fluorescence intensity was observed as a function of 3C concentration, which was normalized to a reference channel. Shown is a hyperbolic fit of the dataset. The apparent dissociation constant for 3C-PI4P interaction is 2.4 \u00b1 0.2 mM. 3C was unable to bind to pure POPC membranes. Error bars represent the SEM (n = 3). models, respectively. Superimposing the average MD structure onto the SAXS model showed a very good agreement between these two models with an NSD of 0.66. The crystal structure showed less agreement with the SAXS model with an NSD of 0.92. The reconstructed low-resolution SAXS model clearly revealed the presence of an extended and highly dynamic N-terminal helix of 3C, the volume of which exceeded the volume of a helix that is 14 residues in length ( Figure 6D ). Worth noting, the amphipathic nature of this helix ( Figure S5 ) may also contribute to the alternative conformations observed on membranes (Figures 5E and 5F) .",

It is known that the RNAdependent RNA polymerase domain, 3D, of enteroviruses binds to PI4P, although it is not clear where on the protein this binding occurs (Hsu et al., 2010) . Because the 3CD protein accumulates to a much higher level in PV-infected cells than 3D, and 3CD has been implicated in formation and/or function of the genome-replication organelle (Oh et al., 2009) , we used the available structural information for these proteins (Marcotte et al., 2007; Mosimann et al., 1997; Moustafa et al., 2015; Thompson and Peersen, 2004) to screen for PI4P-binding sites by using a molecular-docking algorithm (Goodsell et al., 1996; Morris et al., 1998) . The observation of a putative PI4P-binding site on 3C was unexpected but exciting, as it was now very possible that trafficking of PV proteins to the site of genome replication might be facilitated by the use of new structural classes of PI4P-binding domains (Figure 1 ). Our focus on 3C was motivated by the arsenal of structural and computational resources available to study PV 3C that would facilitate identification and characterization of the PI4P-binding site, including a near-complete backbone NMR resonance assignment (Amero et al., 2008) .",

Titration of PI4P into a solution containing 3C caused CSPs that were consistent with the major PI4P-binding site observed computationally ( Figure 2A) . However, the CSPs also included other residues ( Figure 2B ), in particular residues known to contribute to the RNA-binding activity of 3C (Amero et al., 2008) . PIP binding was indeed competitive with RNA binding (Figures 3H and 3I) . For a small molecule such as PI4P to cause so many CSPs or to compete with a substantially larger RNA, either multiple molecules of PI4P bind to the protein or a single molecule of PI4P induces a large change in the conformation and/or dynamics of the protein. Analysis of NMR spectra were inconsistent with large-scale changes in conformation or dynamics as most of the resonance positions and intensities were not affected by PI4P binding (Figure 2 ). MD simulations were consistent with multiple PIPs binding to PV 3C along the shallow cleft used for RNA binding ( Figure 5 ). While the negative charge of the phospholipid head group contributed to PIP binding, the display of the charge on the inositol ring contributed to high-affinity binding (Table 1 ). In this regard, neither the location of the phosphate on the inositol ring nor the number of phosphates on the inositol ring mattered for 3C binding (Table 1) , although the nature of the PIP influenced the conformation of 3C bound to membrane observed computationally ( Figure 5 ). MD simulations indicated that one contributor to the PIP-dependent conformation is the flexibility of the N terminus (compare Figures 5E and 5F ). Such conformational flexibility of the 3C N terminus was also observed in solution using SAXS ( Figure 6 ).",

            "text": "The PIP-binding site structure, corresponding specificity, and extreme capacity to cluster PIPs differs substantially from known cellular PIP-binding domains. Most cellular PIP-binding domains contain a solvent-accessible, basic cavity to which a PIP binds (Lemmon, 2008) . In certain cases, spatial restriction within the cavity enables stereospecificity to the interaction with a PIP head group. Even though the putative PIP-binding sites on 3C are enriched in basic residues, the surface is shallow by comparison with cellular PIP-binding domains. While cellular PIP-binding proteins are known to bind more than one PIP or a single PIP in combination with another anionic phospholipid, the maximum number is usually two PIPs (Moravcevic et al., 2012; Yamamoto et al., 2016) . The expanded specificity does not represent mere sloppiness, but permits regulation by the simultaneous presence of multiple PIPs, which has been referred to as coincidence detection (Moravcevic et al., 2012) . The broad specificity of the 3C PIP-binding site is unprecedented in mammalian systems but broad specificity may be more common in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Yu et al., 2004) . This circumstance may not cause a problem for the virus because PI4P synthesis is induced immediately upon infection, and the levels of other PIPs in the cell exist at a much lower level (van Meer et al., 2008) . Much of the apparent affinity of 3C for the PIP-containing membrane derives from the multivalent nature of the interaction ( Figure 5 ). Clustering of PIPs has been suggested by MD of cellular PIP-binding proteins bound to membranes; however, binding of two PIPs is most common (Yamamoto et al., 2016) . Binding of five PIPs to the same protein seems extraordinary ( Figure 5 ). Whether or not the virus requires substantial PIP clustering and whether or not such substantial PIP clustering causes a biological response are questions that need to be addressed in the future. One class of PIP-binding proteins uses an unstructured basic domain to bind to a leaflet of the bilayer and sequester PIPs (McLaughlin et al., 2002) . Among the best-characterized members of this class of proteins is MARCKS, myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (McLaughlin et al., 2002) . PIP sequestration causes an increase in PIP concentration, which may serve to increase signaling intensity when acted upon by effectors such as phospholipases. The process of sequestration can be tuned down or turned off by the presence of Ca 2+ (McLaughlin et al., 2002) . Similarly, 3C bound to a membrane should sequester PIPs. Indeed, 3C binding to membranes at any significant level could act as a phosphoinositide sink, given the presence of contact sites to connect all of the intracellular membranes (Helle et al., 2013; Raiborg et al., 2016) . The ability of a virus to sequester phosphoinositides could have a profound, debilitating effect on the cell.",

The role of viral matrix proteins is to bridge the genome or some genome-containing ribonucleoprotein complex to the membrane used to envelope the virus as it buds from the cell. Both of these viral proteins appear to bind specifically to PI(4,5)P 2 . PIP binding signals to the protein that it has reached the destination for assembly. In the case of MA, PIP binding triggers the exposure and insertion of its myristoylated N terminus into the plasma membrane (Saad et al., 2006) . In the case of VP40, PIP binding promotes oligomerization (Johnson et al., 2016) . Both HIV MA and Ebola VP40 assemble into oligomers, which cluster PIPs, but not to the same extreme as predicted for 3C (Johnson et al., 2016; Saad et al., 2006) . Both of these matrix proteins bind RNA. In the case of Ebola VP40, there is no evidence to suggest that RNA competes with PIP binding (Gomis-Ruth et al., 2003) . However, competition may exist for HIV MA (Chukkapalli et al., 2010) .",

The motif used has been referred to as the basic amino acid PIP2 pincer (BAAPP) domain (Cho et al., 2015) . This motif is nothing more than two basic amino acids flanking a series of hydrophobic residues displayed on a helix, which presumably penetrates into the bilayer. The BAAPP motif can be found in amphipathic a helices of cellular and viral proteins; however, the function is not known. Indeed, such a motif might exist in the N terminus of 3C ( Figure S5 ). In the case of 3C, we propose that this helix just augments membrane binding without any specificity (Figures 5E and 5F ). How the BAAPP domain confers specificity is not known. It is worth noting that NS5A is an RNA-binding protein. The organization described for 3C, amphipathic a helix followed by an (A and B) All-atom molecular dynamics simulations of (A) 3C binding to a PI4P-containing membrane, or (B) to a PI(4,5)P 2 -containing membrane. Snapshots of selected simulations show that 3C interacts with five, clustered PI4P or PI(4,5)P 2 molecules. PI4P and PI(4,5)P 2 are shown as dark gray sticks with phosphates colored orange (phosphorus) and red (oxygen). 3C is shown as a light gray ribbon; residue side chains are colored as follows: light blue (positive side chains) and red (negative side chains) sticks. Also shown are: sodium ions as magenta spheres; the amino and C termini as blue and red spheres, respectively; 3C protease active-site residues as black spheres. Specific interactions are as follows, with number in parentheses referring to head group in panel: (1) R13 and R84; (2) D32, mediated by sodium ions; (3) D32 for PI4P in (A) mediated by sodium, or R176 for PI(4,5)P 2 in (B); (4) K156 and R176; and (5) a-amino group of G1 for PI4P in (A), or K12 and R13 for PI(4,5)P 2 in (B). (C and D) Surface representations of 3C (light gray) with PI4P-containing membrane in (C) or PI(4,5)P 2 -containing membrane in (D) (blue, red and dark gray sticks); PC (light gray lines). Charged interactions between 3C and the respective ligands are shown as blue (positive) or red (negative) spheres to correspondingly colored sticks. (E and F) Same as (C) and (D) rotated 90 counterclockwise about the vertical access of the page to reveal the amino terminus (blue) interacting with the membrane (light gray lines). PI4P-containing membrane was composed of 244 PC and 20 PI4P lipids; PI(4,5)P 2 -containing membrane was composed of 244 PC and 20 PI(4,5)P 2 lipids. All lipids were equally distributed on each monolayer of the membrane. The simulation was conducted at 310K for 400 ns; the last 300 ns of the trajectories were used for analysis.",

Prominent members of the coronavirus family include severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS CoV). PV 3C, NoV 3CL (also known as NS6) and SARS/MERS CoV 3CL (also known as nsp5) share a chymotrypsin-like fold (Anand et al., 2002; Hilgenfeld, 2014; Mosimann et al., 1997; Zeitler et al., 2006) . The protease active sites are quite similar. Structurally, NoV 3CL is extremely close to PV 3C, with clear conservation of residues corresponding to: K12, R13, D32, K156, and R176. Residues of SARS/MERS CoV 3CL are not so highly conserved, but the surface of this protein corresponding to the PIP-binding surface of PV 3C is clearly basic. There is one report of RNA binding by NoV 3CL (Viswanathan et al., 2013) but none for the CoV proteins. The possibility that members of other virus families of medical importance encode a PIP-binding protein, such as that of PV 3C, suggests that this activity may represent a target with broad-spectrum therapeutic potential. Empirical studies of the NoV and CoV 3CL proteins will be required to assess this possibility.",

Although R13 was nearby, a role for this residue in PIP binding was not suggested ( Figure 1A) . Removal of the positive charge from K12 had no impact on PIP binding, removal from R84 increased PIP-binding affinity, but removal from R13 weakened PIP-bind-ing affinity (Figures 3C-3F) . A role for R13 and R84 in PIP binding was supported by NMR experiments, but the evidence for K12 was weak ( Figure 2B ). So, while the molecular-docking simulation pointed us in the right direction, the molecular details of the putative interaction were not correct. The inaccuracy may have been caused by our attempt to dock a single PI4P instead of multiple PIPs. The 3C-membrane-binding simulation (Figures 5A and 5B) produced results that were consistent with both the NMR and mutagenesis experiments. K12 has either no or a minor role in binding PI4P ( Figure 5A ) or PI(4,5)P 2 ( Figure 5B ). R13 interacts directly with one ( Figure 5A ) or two ( Figure 5B ) PIP phosphates. R84 is near the Na + ions at the interface. We do not understand the structural basis for the enhancement of binding conferred by the R84L substitution. However, given the apposition of position 84 to the bilayer, Leu may penetrate the bilayer and interact with the acyl chains of the phospholipids. Structural and/or computational studies in the future will hopefully fill this gap.",

Although the same collection of 3C residues appear to be involved in interactions with both PI4P and PI(4,5)P 2 , the architecture of the interface is different ( Figure 5 ). It is possible that these apparent states are interconvertible and just reflect the short duration of the simulated trajectory. However, it is possible that different PIPs stabilize different states. For the K-Ras4A protein, it is known that POPS stabilizes a different conformation of this protein than PI(4,5)P 2 (Li and Buck, 2017) . During infection, 3C functions primarily in the context of a larger precursor, 3CD. 3CD is known to have many functions before, during and after genome replication ( were applied for the low-concentration data. The inset shows the linear fitting of the Guinier plot from which radius of gyration (R g ) was determined. (B) The transformed scattering profile calculated by GNOM from the pair-distance-distribution function, P (r) , which is shown in the inset. The maximum particle dimension and the R g obtained from P (r) are indicated. The estimated R g from GNOM is in good agreement with that obtained from Guinier fitting. (C) The calculated scattering profiles of the crystal structure of poliovirus 3C monomer (cyan) (Mosimann et al., 1997) and the average MD structure (black) (Moustafa et al., 2015) fitted to the experimental SAXS data (gray). Both structures fit well; however, the average MD structure showed slightly better fitting compared to the crystal structure as indicated by its lower c value. (D) The reconstructed SAXS filtered model calculated by DAMMIN is shown as an orange transparent surface with the crystal structure superimposed. The SAXS model clearly shows an extended N terminus compared to the crystal structure. The calculated scattering profile of the SAXS model (orange) fitted to the experimental data (gray) is also shown. phospholipid composition of the membrane to which 3CD is bound would be an elegant explanation of the regulation of the many activities of this protein. Deliberate interrogation of this hypothesis is warranted.",

The outcome is a new structural class of PIP-binding proteins with the capacity for multivalent binding to any mono-, bis-, or tris-phosphorylated PIP, but with a unique conformational state determined by the nature of the bound PIP. It is likely that a similar mechanism exists in NoVs and CoVs, suggesting a role for PIPs in the biology of these viruses even though empirical support of this possibility is needed.",

Next, the AutoDockTools (ADT) was used to complete the preparation of the target protein by merging the non-polar hydrogen atoms, adding Kollman charges, and creating the PDBQT files for the docking runs. The structure of the PI4P ligand was prepared by modifying the structure of PI(4,5)P 2 , extracted from the NMR complex structure of HIV-1 matrix protein bound to PI(4,5)P 2 (PDB: 2H3Z), in Chimera (Saad et al., 2006) . The ligand was subjected to quick energy minimizations (100 steps) in Chimera after adding hydrogen atoms and Gasteiger-Marsili atomic partial charges; ADT was then used to prepare the ligand PDBQT file, the flexible ligand has 20 active torsions. For the target protein, the affinity grid field was generated using the auxiliary program AutoGrid. The grid size was set to 49 x 49 x 49 points for the 3C protein with a grid spacing of 1 \u00c5 . The grid size extended at least 15 \u00c5 beyond the size of the protein in all dimensions. The docking was performed using Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm (LGA). For the target protein-ligand pair, 100 docking runs were performed with a population of 150 individuals, maximum number of 25,000,000 energy evaluations, and maximum number of 27,000 generations. The default parameters of mutation rate (0.02), crossover rate (0.80), and GA's selection window (10 generations) were used. All other parameters were kept at their default values: translation step (2.0 \u00c5 ), quaternion step (50.0), and torsion step (50.0). The 100 docking solutions resulted from the run were grouped into clusters such that the ligand root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) within each cluster were below 2.0 \u00c5 . The clusters were also ranked by the value of the lowest energy solution within each cluster.",

Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,400 x g at 4 C for 10 min and washed with a buffer containing 10 mM Tris and 1 mM EDTA at pH 8.0 and then recentrifuged. The cell pellet was resuspended in Buffer A [20 mM HEPES, 10% glycerol, 5 mM imidazole, 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol (BME), 1 mM EDTA, 500 mM NaCl, 1.4 mg/mL pepstatin A, 1.0 mg/mL leupeptin, at pH 7.5] at a 5 mL Buffer A per 1-gram cell pellet ratio. The cell suspension was homogenized by Dounce homogenizer and lysed by passing through a French press twice at a pressure of 1,000 psi. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) was added to the cell lysate at a final concentration of 1 mM. The suspension was clarified by centrifugation at 75,000 x g at 4 C for 30 min. Polyethylenimine (PEI) was added gradually to a final concentration of 0.25% (w/v) at 4 C while stirring to precipitate the contaminating nucleic acids. The PEI-containing suspension was clarified by centrifugation at 75,000 x g at 4 C for 30 min. Ammonium sulfate was gradually added to 60% saturation at 4 C while stirring to precipitate the protein and get rid of the PEI. The solution was centrifuged at 75,000 x g at 4 C for 30 min to collect the protein pellet. The pellet was resuspended in Buffer B [20 mM HEPES, 20% glycerol, 1 mM BME, 500 mM NaCl, at pH 7.5] containing 5 mM imidazole. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic (Ni-NTA) resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) was equilibrated with 10 column volumes (c.v.) of Buffer B containing 5 mM imidazole at 1 mL/min using a peristaltic pump. The protein load was passed through the equilibrated Ni-NTA resin at 1 mL/min. To remove contaminants, the loaded resin was washed with 50 c.v. and 4 c.v. of Buffer B containing 5 mM and 50 mM imidazole, respectively. Finally, 3C was eluted into multiple fractions with Buffer B containing 500 mM imidazole. The purity of the 3C fractions was evaluated by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE (12.5%) gel. Pure and concentrated fractions were pooled and dialyzed against Buffer C [20 mM HEPES, 20% glycerol, 1 mM BME, 1 mM EDTA, 250 mM NaCl, at pH 7.5] overnight at 4 C by using a 6-8,000 MWCO dialysis membrane (Spectrum Laboratories). Dialyzed 3C sample was centrifuged at 75,000 x g at 4 C for 30 min to remove any aggregates from the solution. The protein concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm ( 3 max = 0.008945 mM -1 $cm -1 ) with NanoDrop 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). The ionic strength of the dialyzed protein solution was confirmed with a conductivity meter. Agarose gel electrophoresis was run to check for any contaminating nucleic acids. To assess the homogeneity of the protein sample, dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments of the purified 3C (2.0 mg/mL) were performed with Viscotek 802 DLS (Malvern Instruments Ltd.) at 20 C. Flash frozen aliquots were stored at -80 C until ready to use. The ProtParam tool (ExPASy Bioinformatics Resource Portal) was used to calculate the physical/chemical parameters of the protein.",

The cell pellet was lysed and the His6-SUMO-PLCd1 PH domain was purified via nickel affinity chromatography as described for 3C. Note that BME concentration was increased to 2 mM for each step to avoid oxidation of the cysteine residues within the PLCd1 PH domain. During the overnight dialysis at 4 C, ULP1 (SUMO protease) was added at 1 mg ULP1 per 1 mg protein to cleave off the His6-SUMO from the PLCd1 PH domain containing an authentic N-terminus. We observed that PLCd1 PH domain itself binds to the nickel resin, accordingly we were unable to use a 2 nd nickel column to remove the His6-SUMO. Taking advantage of the differences in isoelectric points of PLCd1 PH domain (pI = 8.4) and the His6-SUMO (pI = 5.7), we used Q-Sepharose (anion exchange) resin to separate the two. After the dialysis and the cleavage were complete, the resulting solution was diluted 10-fold with Buffer D [20 mM HEPES, 20% glycerol, 2 mM BME, 1 mM EDTA, at pH 7.5] to bring down the NaCl concentration to 50 mM. Q-Sepharose resin, at a bed volume assuming 30 mg/mL binding capacity, was equilibrated with 10 c.v. of Buffer D containing 50 mM NaCl. The protein solution was passed through the equilibrated Q-Sepharose resin at 1 mL/min. The flow-through contained the PLCd1 PH domain. The resulting flow-through was concentrated $30-fold with Vivaspin-20 (3,000 MWCO) centrifugal concentrators (Sartorius Stedium Biotech).
