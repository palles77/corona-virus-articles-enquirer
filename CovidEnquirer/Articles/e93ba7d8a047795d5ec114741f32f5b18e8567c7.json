However, we hypothesized that including metrics of antibody profiles that integrate previous exposure history would further improve predictions of the risk of seroconversion. Therefore, we examined the association between the risk of seroconversion with age at baseline sampling, pre-existing, homologous titer to outcome strains (the ith strain), titer to the i-1th strain, and summary metrics .

Antibody profiles can be generated by characterizing immune responses to multiple antigenically variant strains, but how these profiles vary across individuals and determine future responses is unclear. We used hemagglutination inhibition titers from 21 H3N2 strains to construct 777 paired antibody profiles from people aged 2 to 86, and developed novel metrics to capture features of these profiles. Total antibody titer per potential influenza exposure increases in early life, then decreases in middle age. Increased titers to one or more strains were seen in 97.8% of participants, suggesting widespread influenza exposure. While titer changes were seen to all strains, recently circulating strains exhibited the greatest variation. Higher pre-existing, homologous titers reduced the risk of seroconversion to recent strains. After adjusting for homologous titer, we also found an increased frequency of seroconversion among those with higher immunity to older previously exposed strains. Our results suggest that a comprehensive quantitative description of immunity encompassing past exposures could lead to improved correlates of risk of influenza.",

Through the process of antigenic drift, antigenically novel strains replace previously circulating viruses every few influenza seasons (2) . As a result, people can be infected multiple times over a lifetime (3) . Each of these infections leaves a mark on a person's immune system, and the accumulation of antibody responses over a life course leads to complex individual antibody profiles reflecting both recent and past exposures (3) (4) (5) (6) . A growing body of evidence suggests that the order and timing of influenza exposures shape the immune response in ways that may affect morbidity and mortality (3, 7) , particularly when encountering novel (i.e. pandemic or potentially pandemic) strains (8) , yet a comprehensive quantitative description of how past exposure to multiple strains shapes infection risk remains elusive.",

Exceptions do exist, and studies of multi-strain dynamics after immunological challenge date back to at least 1941 (16) . However, historically, few analytical approaches were available with which to interpret these complex data. In recent years there has been increasing interest in measuring and interpreting the breadth and strength of antigenic profiles across a diverse set of influenza strains (4, 7) . It is believed to provide a more nuanced picture of the humoral immune response to influenza than measuring titers to single strains (i.e. homologous titers), while the quantitative role of past exposures in determining risk of future infections and subsequent immune responses is still unclear.",

We measured immune responses to multiple chronologically ordered H3N2 influenza strains (referred to as antibody profiles) that represent the history of H3N2 circulation in humans since its emergence in 1968. We aim to determine how those profiles vary across individuals and between study visits, and to test if there exist features of these antibody profiles that are more predictive of the risk of seroconversion to recently circulating strains than homologous titers only.",

We described individual antibody profiles from these serological data, and introduced multiple novel metrics to summarize each individual's profile and facilitate comparisons of profiles across age and time.

We developed several metrics aimed at summarizing the information in individuals', often complex, antibody profiles (Fig. 3 ). We estimated: the area under the curve (AUC) for each antibody profile (i.e. the integral of an individual's measured log titers); the width (W z ) of an individual's antibody titer above a threshold \u202b\u0756\u202c (i.e. the proportion of the profile above that threshold; W 40 for protective threshold and W 10 for detectable threshold); and the average titer year (ATY) of each antibody profile (i.e. the average of strain isolation years weighted by their titer) (see Methods). We hypothesized that these features of antibody profiles captured biologically relevant properties of the immune response to H3N2; in particular, overall levels of antibody mediated immunity (for AUC), the breadth of antibody mediated immune response (for W 40 and W 10 ) and temporal center of mass of H3N2 immunity (for ATY). In most analyses, we use normalized versions of these metrics (i.e. nAUC, nW 40 , nW 10 , nATY) to adjust for differences between individuals in the number of possibly exposed strains given their ages (i.e. individuals could not have been exposed to prebirth strains) (see Methods.

Our empirical observations are more in line with the latter hypothesis; baseline nATY moved away from birth year at a rate of 0.50 years for every additional year of life (0.45 years at follow-up) (Fig. 3 , J and K).",

However, we found that antibody titers to non-recent strains overwhelmingly increased (Figs. 2F and 4B), inconsistent with random variation (fig. S8C) suggesting that most increases, even those to non-recent strains, can be attributed to exposure to circulating strains. Though titer to nonrecent strains in general increased between the two samples, the shape of each person's antibody profile was highly consistent between visits (median Pearson's correlation 0.90; IQR, 0.82 to 0.94). This result is similar to previously described results from 5 landscapes for 69 individuals (7) , suggesting that individuals maintain patterns of relative titer across historical strains, even while acquiring antibodies due to new exposures.",

The observed decrease in nAUC and nW 40 among people aged 40 to 50 and age-independent changes in these metrics (Fig. 3 D and H) could suggest low HAI antibody among this age group, which could be due to high non-specific immune responses [e.g. antibodies against HA stalk and neuraminidase (NA) and cellular immune responses; (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) ].

One plausible hypothesis is that a subset of people tend to have a more vigorous titer response across strains (e.g. individual heterogeneity in immune responses). This is supported by our data that positive association can still be detected when using titer to an older strain, instead of the summary metric of antibody profiles, as the proxy of immunity to non-recent strains (fig. S14). Another plausible hypothesis is that non-HAI immunity that was acquired from previous infections (e.g. antibody to HA stalk and NA and cellular immune responses) could blunt the production of strain-specific antibody upon exposure to circulating strains (18) (19) (20) (21) , thus reducing the HAI titers to the circulating strains and increasing the probability of seroconversion. High antibody to non-recent strains could indicate individuals who have not experienced infection in recent times [e.g. low strain-specific antibody to currently circulating strains due to temporary protection from last infection; (23, 26, 27) ]. Homologous HAI titers may reflect the combined binding ability of antibody targeting the tested antigen as well as antibody targeting previously encountered epitopes, and high antibody titers to non-recent strains may indicate particular distributions of these two that are less protective.",

We found accumulation of immunity to H3N2 during the first twenty years of life, followed by reductions among 40-50 years old. These age patterns in antibody profiles are likely to be driven by continual exposure to influenza; our study suggested nearly universal exposures during a four-year interval. Meanwhile, antibody profiles were found to provide more information than homologous titers in predicting temporal changes in influenza immunity. In particular, higher immunity to older strains was found associated with increased risk of seroconversion to the currently circulating strains, which mechanism remains unclear.",
