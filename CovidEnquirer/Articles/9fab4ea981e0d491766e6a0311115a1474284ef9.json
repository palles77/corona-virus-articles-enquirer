            "text": "Fathead minnow nidovirus (FHMNV) is a serious baitfish-pathogenic virus in North America. Studies to trace the spread of the virus and determine its host range are hampered by the absence of reliable diagnostic assays. In this study, a one-step, reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay was developed that targets a region in the FHMNV spike protein gene. The assay was optimized, and the best results were obtained at 8 mM of Mg 2+ with an incubation time of 40 min at 63 \u2022 C in the presence of calcein. The analytical sensitivity of the RT-LAMP method was estimated to be as low as 5 viral copies and was 1000-fold more sensitive than the conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the developed RT-LAMP assay versus the RT-PCR assay was 100% and 95.7%, respectively. A quantitative RT-LAMP of FHMNV with a high correlation coefficient (r 2 = 0.9926) was also developed and the result of quantitation of viral copies in tissue samples of infected fish showed that the viral loads of the infected fish tissue samples reached up to 4.7 \u00d7 10 10 copies per mg. It is anticipated that the developed RT-LAMP and quantitative RT-LAMP methods will be instrumental for diagnosis and surveillance of FHMNV.",

The isolated virus, originally believed to belong to the family Rhabdoviridae, measured 130-180 nm in length and 31-47 nm in diameter. Additional phylogenetic analyses based on the complete genome proved that the fathead minnow virus isolate is a species within the genus Bafinivirus, subfamily Torovirinae, family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales and was named the fathead minnow nidovirus (FHMNV, Batts et al., 2012) . The detection of FHMNV and the marked pathology it causes raised concerns about potential losses in the multi-billion dollar baitfish industry and the potential for transmitting this deadly infectious agent to other water bodies, thereby threatening other native fish species.",

To develop an RT-LAMP assay specific to FHMNV, the spike glycoprotein gene, which has been shown to be comparatively variable among other genes within nidovirus genomes (Nga et al., 2011; Lauber et al., 2012) , was chosen as the target gene for this assay. Three pairs of RT-LAMP primers, including a pair of loop primers, were designed as described by Nagamine et al. (2002) . The spike protein gene from the FHMNV genome (Gen-Bank accession number GU002364) was submitted to the website (http://primerexplorer.jp/elamp4.0.0/index.html) and a set of RT-LAMP primers was generated by the Primer Explorer software, version 4.0 (Table 1 and Fig. 1 ).",

In all cases, total RNA isolated from cells infected with WBV (EPC cells), HCoV-229E (HuH-7 cells) and CavV (C6/36 cells), respectively, was used as template. The cells were infected with the appropriate virus at a multiplicity of infection of 3 TCID 50 per cell and total RNA was isolated at 48 h p.i. Additionally, the specificity of the FHMNV LAMP assay was tested against three fish pathogenic rhabdoviruses isolated from infected cells: infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (genus Novirhabdovirus), viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus genotype IVb (genus Novirhabdovirus), and the spring viremia of carp virus (genus Vesiculorhabdovirus). Additional fish pathogenic viruses used for specificity testing included the infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (genus Aquabirnavirus) isolated from infected cells and the genomic DNA of alloherpesvirus epizootic epitheliotropic disease virus (EEDV, salmonids herpesvirus 3), recovered from lake trout infected with EEDV. DNA and RNA of these viruses were used as template of the RT-LAMP using the primers designed for the detection of FHMNV under the predetermined conditions described above.",

The best results in terms of obtaining clear bands and maximizing amplification products were obtained when the Mg 2+ concentration was at 8 mM ( Fig. 2A) . Therefore, we considered the optimal Mg 2+ concentration to be 8 mM and further optimization experiments were performed at that concentration. The optimum temperature for RT-LAMP was found to be 63 \u2022 C, at which clear bands and maximum amplification products were obtained (Fig. 2B ). Using the optimized Mg 2+ concentration and incubation temperature, amplified products could be observed as early as 20 min after starting the reaction. An additional 10-20 min of reaction time, however, produced better amplification results (Fig. 2C ).

We plan to regularly validate and, if needed, further improve the specificity of the assay when novel closely related nidoviruses are discovered. The developed assay is estimated to detect as little as five copies, which is considered very sensitive. These results are in line with previously described LAMP assays developed for a number of viruses, such as the severe acute The amplification plots of qRT-LAMP of serial 10-fold dilution plasmids. Copies of pCR \u00ae 2.1-FHMNV plasmids: 5.4 \u00d7 10 7 , 5.4 \u00d7 10 6 , 5.4 \u00d7 10 5 , 5.4 \u00d7 10 4 , 5.4 \u00d7 10 3 and 5.4 \u00d7 10 2 (from left to right).

            "text": "respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Hong et al., 2004) , noroviruses (Yoda et al., 2007; Suzuki et al., 2011) , human astrovirus (Wei et al., 2013) , and influenza A virus (H7N9, Ge et al., 2013) . On the other hand, the analytical sensitivities of the RT-LAMP method and RT-PCR were 1.6 fg and 1.6 pg of RNA extracted from FHMNV-infected EPC cells, respectively. This suggests a 1000-fold higher analytical sensitivity of the RT-LAMP assay than that of the RT-PCR assay. This finding is in agreement with the reports of Chen et al. (2011) for the Scylla serrata reovirus; Arunrut et al. (2011) for the Laem-Singh virus; and Wang et al. (2013) for the hepatitis delta virus genotype I, which reveals that RT-LAMP is more sensitive than the conventional RT-PCR for these viruses. This increased sensitivity makes the RT-LAMP a better choice than the conventional RT-PCR for the detection of FHMNV, particularly when virus titers are very low. A standard curve was constructed using serial 10-fold dilutions of the pCR \u00ae 2.1-FHMNV plasmid with reference to the Ct value. Based on the standard curve, an equation was calculated using regression analysis comparing the Ct value to the standard copy number. In the range of 10 7 -10 2 plasmid copies, the correlation coefficient was high (r 2 = 0.9926), which indicates that the qRT-LAMP is appropriate as a quantitation tool. However, when numbers of plasmid decrease to less than 100 copies, the correlation coefficient declines significantly (r 2 = 0.9437, data not shown). Previous reports also demonstrated that it is difficult to determine the exact correlation of virus quantity and Ct value at very low concentrations of template (Suzuki et al., 2011; Wei et al., 2013) .In conclusion, we report the development of an RT-LAMP assay for the detection of FHMNV from cell culture and fish tissues. This novel assay has the advantage of being rapid, sensitive, and specific. Moreover, the qRT-LAMP established in this study provides a lowcost quantitation method for FHMNV.",
