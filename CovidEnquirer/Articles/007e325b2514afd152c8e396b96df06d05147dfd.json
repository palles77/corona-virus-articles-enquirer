In the N95 mode, only particles with a diameter of 0.04 mm are counted. One N100 mask (8233) and two N95 masks (1860s and 9210) (3M, St Paul, Minnesota, USA) were tested.

The three masks tested were chosen because they have been found previously to fit the greatest number of staff.

It is possible that this is because our subjects had smaller or different-shaped faces to the population used when the masks were designed. Similar testing carried out in North America, however, also showed a high failure rate. 1 In conclusion, the user seal check appears to be limited in its use as a surrogate for mask fit testing. If inadequate time is available to test staff using a full protocol, consideration could be given to using a shortened protocol such as that described by Sreenath et al. 5 The best strategy at present is to test staff routinely, prior to the outbreak of a respiratory epidemic. )   1860s  84  69  75  40  19  9210  93  55  71  24  31  8233  91  70  73  45  18 ",
