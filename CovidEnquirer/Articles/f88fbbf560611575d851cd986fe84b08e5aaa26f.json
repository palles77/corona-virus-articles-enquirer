C. parvum oocysts were identified by using the Ziehl-Neelsen modified technique in 109 (19.7%) bovines ranging from 3 days old to adults. Positive animals were found in 19 (63.3%) farms. As much as 44.4% of calves aged 3-4 days were infected, but infection rates peaked at 6-15 days of age (76.7%). Nevertheless, prevalence was also high in weanling calves aged 1.5-4 months (14%), fattening calves and heifers 4-24 months old (7.7%) and adults (17.8%). Diarrhoea was recorded in 78.6% of suckling and 29.4% of weanling calves infected by C. parvum, but it was only found to be statistically associated with infection in suckling calves (P < 0.01). All calves shedding moderate or many oocysts had diarrhoea, whereas asymptomatic infection was always correlated with few oocysts in faeces. Cryptosporidial infections were always asymptomatic in bovines older than 4 months. Giardia cysts were identified in 65 bovines (11.7%) from 16 (53.3%) of the farms surveyed. Infection rates were significantly higher in suckling (14.1%) and weanling calves (38%) than in bovines older than 4 months (2.2%) (P < 0.001). Diarrhoea was recorded in 45.5% of suckling and 10.9% of weanling calves infected by Giardia, but it was not found to be statistically associated with infection.

Since neonatal enteric infections have a negative effect on the performance of the calves during the first month of life, the economic significance of cryptosporidiosis is remarkable. Furthermore, C. parvum is a potential zoonotic pathogen, as it is considered to be the species infecting humans. In fact, numerous cases of zoonotic transmission have been documented from epidemiological studies, involving direct transmission from pets and farm animals as well as water-borne outbreaks (O'Donoghue, 1995) .",

However, recent works confirm that this protozoan is more common than currently believed in large animals, especially in cattle (Xiao, 1994) . Additionally, high levels of infection in young calves are considered to be clinically significant. Continuous or intermittent diarrhoea, weight loss and growth retardation because of maldigestion and malabsorption have been associated with giardiasis in cattle and subclinical infections are thought to increase requirements for some nutrients (Kirkpatrick, 1989) . On the other hand, like cryptosporidiosis, Giardia infection in large animals may have epidemiological implications for human health. The zoonotic potential of Giardia has been controversial for long and there is some epidemiological evidence of giardiasis of zoonotic origin mainly based on studies of water-borne outbreaks in humans (Kasprzak and Pawlowski, 1989) . Although no irrefutable evidence for such transmission outside the laboratory has been recorded, at present, most authors recognize that at least some isolates of Giardia are not host-specific and that humans and a variety of others animals share the parasite, regarding giardiasis as a zoonosis (Thompson et al., 1993) .",

Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected in bovines ranging from 3 days old to adults, although infection rates were significantly highest in suckling calves. The high percentage of suckling calves shedding oocysts at the age of 3-4 days (44.4%) indicates that most of them are infected immediately after birth. The short prepatent period of Cryptosporidium infection found here is similar to that previously reported (Xiao and Herd, 1994a) and consistent with the life cycle of the parasite (Fayer et al., 1990) . It may also indicate heavy environmental contamination in the calving area (Angus, 1990) . Nevertheless, the percentage of calves shedding oocysts peaked at 6-15 days of age (76.7%) whereas the rate decreased to 40% in calves aged 1 month. These results are similar to those of previous workers concluding that cryptosporidiosis in calves is generally established during the initial 2 weeks of life (Anderson, 1981; Henriksen and Krogh, 1985, Hiepe et al., 1988; Ongerth and Stibbs, 1989; Gather et al., 1994) .",

However, results of the current study show that infection is also common in calves after weaning and even in adults. Although, in agreement with results by Henriksen and Krogh (1985) , infection intensities were always light and asymptomatic in animals older than 4 months. Recent surveys have recorded infection rates ranging from 62.4% to 71.7% in asymptomatic adult cattle, even higher than that detected in our study (Lorenzo-Lorenzo et al., 1993 , Scott et al., 1995 and some authors have considered that asymptomatic adult carriers are responsible for the diarrhoea in calves born during early calvings. Contamination is then amplified by the infection of first new-born calves (Aurich et al., 1990) . This opinion is consistent with the recent report, although not confirmed in cattle, of a periparturient rise in the excretion of Cryptosporidium oocysts in sheep .",

(1995) reported that as much as 47% of the calves positive for Giardia cysts had diarrhoea, but it could not be attributed only to giardiasis since neither bacterial nor viral infections were checked. We found that 45.5% of suckling and 10.9% of weanling calves infected by Giardia had diarrhoea, although no statistically significant association between infection and occurrence of diarrhoea was detected, as the parasite was more frequent in non-diarrhoeic than in diarrhoeic calves. Some of the infected calves had additional parasites that could be involved in the aetiology of the clinical symptoms, such as Cryptosporidium parvum and Eimeria spp. Only two diarrhoeic suckling calves had a monoinfection by Giardia, but the role of the parasite in the aetiology of the diarrhoea is unknown since microbial infections were not excluded.",
