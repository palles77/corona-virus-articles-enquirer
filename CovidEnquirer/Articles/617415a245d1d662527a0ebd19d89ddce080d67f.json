This paper evaluates the economic effects of visa restrictions on tourism as a result of the 1989 Tian'an Men Square Incident and the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games by using an innovative combination of econometric and computable general equilibrium (CGE) models. The results show that both events generated economic losses. The unexpected negative economic impact of the Beijing Olympics seems attributable to visa restrictions. Suggestions for the alleviation of the negative impact of visa regulations are provided.",

The September 11, 2001 terrorist attack on America, the Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami in 2004, the 2008 financial crisis, and the Olympic Games are examples of one-off events (Jennings, 2010; Lagadec, 2004) . Such events are normally highly visible with economic, social and political consequences (Decker et al., 2005) . In this paper, only crises and special events are examined.

The economic consequences of inbound tourism during a one-off event may be attributed to factors such as exchange rate changes, bad weather, inflation, and social instability. Many studies have evaluated the economic influences of tourism due to such one-off events as foot and mouth disease (Irvine & Anderson, 2005) , terrorist attacks (Arana & Leon, 2008; Eugenio-Martin et al., 2005; Pizam & Smith, 2000) , economic crises (Okumus, Altinay, & Arasli, 2005; Smeral, 2010; Song & Lin, 2010) and sporting events (Giesecke & Madden, 2011; Li, Blake, & Cooper, 2011) . Researchers have also identified the factors that may influence the demand for tourism and have evaluated their economic consequences. For example, Li et al. (2011) studied the total effects of visa control and the torch relay incidents on tourism due to the Beijing Olympics; however, they did not capture the separate impact of each of these two factors. Song, Gartner and Tasci (2012) evaluated the economic consequences of visa restrictions as a result of the 1989 Tian'an Men Square Incident and the 2008 Beijing Olympics, but they did not evaluate the effect of the events themselves. Page, Song and Wu (2012) examined the simultaneous influences of the 2008 economic crisis and swine flu on inbound tourism to the UK using an innovative method that separated the effects of the two events that happened during the period of the assessment.",

            "text": "There are two levels of economic evaluation of one-off events. The first is to analyse their economic consequences in terms of a change in tourism demand, especially a decrease or increase in the number of tourists and in their spending. The second is to evaluate the economic impact of these consequences, which is the economic impact of a change in tourism demand. It can be shown in terms of a decrease or increase in Gross Domestic Product (GDP), prices, employment and household welfare. However, the differences between these two levels of assessment have not been clarified in the literature. This paper evaluates the economic influences of one-off events which are attributed to the event itself and visa restrictions. The two events include one crisis (the 1989 Tian'an Men Square Incident) and one special event (the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games). This study makes a dual contribution. It evaluates the economic consequences of inbound tourism demand as a result of the events themselves and of visa restrictions imposed during the events. This study also innovatively combines two approachesthe econometric and computable general equilibrium (CGE) models in the impact assessment. The estimation results of the econometric models, especially the estimates of the demand elasticities, are used as inputs of the CGE models. The published impact studies have only either used econometric models or CGE models to evaluate the economic consequences of tourism. The CGE studies have mainly used the crude tourism demand estimates and elasticities from other secondary sources, which might not be directly related to the destination under consideration. As a result, the calibrated CGE models were often criticized for their unreliable results. This study, therefore, attempts to overcome these challenges by combining the strengths of both econometric and CGE approaches, and to obtain more robust and reliable results in addition to a separate evaluation of the effects created by the events and visa restrictions.",

A special event, however, is expected to attract more inbound tourists. Politicians perceive special events as an opportunity to showcase their country, and to over-estimate the positive consequences of the event while under-estimating its potential risks (Moran, 2001) . Policy makers tend to be risk averse and thus sensitive to possible losses due to security risks during an event (Jennings, 2010) . One way of reducing the potential security risk is to impose visa restrictions on potential tourists to the country during the event. The main purpose of the visa regulation is to ''control the movement of modern and masterless men'' (Song et al., 2012, p. 398) . Visas, which control the movement of a population, are an effective and straightforward means of preventing the entry of potential terrorists (Torpey, 1998) .",

Concerning of security and visa regulations, some foreign tourists cancelled or delayed their travel bookings from Chinese travel companies during the Beijing Olympics (Premo, 2008) . Figure 1 shows the monthly growth rates of inbound tourists and their expenditure in China in 2008. Both growth rates started to decrease in February and became negative from April onward. However, the growth started to reduce again in October. Before and during the Olympics, the government cancelled or refused to renew many visas, such as multiple visas and demanded that visa applicants provide detailed supporting documents such as hotel and airline booking confirmations (Li et al., 2011) . The government's concern for security inevitably damaged China's tourism industry. For example, the occupancy rate of large hotels was below 70% and lower than 50% for small hotels (Branigan, 2008) . The Olympics itself, however, seemed to have slowed down the decline in both tourist arrivals and receipts.",

Pizam and Smith (2000) identified major terrorism attacks between 1985 and 1998 and found that more than three-quarters of the crises examined significantly reduced tourism demand. By comparing the responses of French, American and German tourists to two crises, it was found that the foot and mouth disease affected French tourists the most while the September 11 attack mostly affected Germans in terms of arrivals and receipts (Eugenio-Martin et al., 2005) . The findings of Kuo, Chen, Tseng, Ju and Huang (2008) reflected that tourism demand in Asian countries was more negatively affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome than by avian flu. Some researchers have also explored the impact of crises on the whole economy. Dwyer, Forsyth, Spurr and Vanho (2006) indicated that the world tourism crises, including the Iraq War and severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003, caused a net decrease in real GDP by $62.418 million in Australia.",

Blake, Durbarry, Eugenio-Martin, Gooroochurn, Hay, Lennon, Sinclair, Sugiyarto and Yeoman (2006) suggested that econometric models should not be considered as substitutes for CGE methods, but the former can complement the latter. The output of the econometric models (the change of tourism demand) can be used as the input of the CGE models. Furthermore, the accuracy of these parameters is important and may affect the results of the CGE models. Therefore, reliable estimates of these feeder parameters by the econometric models are the key to insure the reliability of the CGE models. However, since the demand elasticities are generally unavailable in many destinations, studies that used the CGE approach always adapt these parameters from other CGE studies, which may not always corresponding to the destinations under study. This study, therefore, improve the reliability of the CGE models by incorporating the demand elasticities obtained from the econometric models.",

Although most studies claim to have evaluated the economic impact of crises or special events on tourism, most of these studies only captured the economic impacts by using one of the two categories of methods. The first category is econometric models which evaluate tourism effects of demand. Particularly, the econometric models were used to evaluate the changes in either tourist arrivals or their expenditure, caused by an event. The second category is CGE and I-O modelling which evaluates the economic impact of tourism demand. Specifically, the changes in economic indicators such as GDP, employment, imports and exports caused by a change in tourism expenditure as a result of an event are captured. Most studies confuse the direct tourism effects with the total economic impacts. The tourism effects are the changes in either tourist arrivals or expenditure caused by the event; the latter pertains to the economic changes brought about by the changes in tourist arrivals or receipts within the economy.",

Econometric models can estimate the changes in tourism demand caused by one-off events, which the CGE and I-O models cannot do. Econometric models have been used to assess the economic gains and losses of tourism caused by one-off events such as financial crises (Lim & McAleer, 2005; Smeral, 2010; Song & Lin, 2010) , terrorist attacks and activities (Goodrich, 2001; Pizam & Fleischer, 2002) , diseases (Kuo et al., 2008) , and the Olympics (Athanasopoulos & Hyndman, 2008) . One of the advantages of the econometric models is that the causal relationships between the dependent variable (tourism demand) and the explanatory variables (its influencing factors) can be evaluated (Song & Li, 2008) . These influencing factors include but are not restricted to tourists' income, tourism prices, exchange rates, transportation costs, and the one-off events (Song & Li, 2008; Wang, 2009) . Another advantage of the econometric models is that they can measure the change in tourism demand as a result of one-off events based on long-run relations between tourism demand and its influencing factors (Blake, Gillham, & Sinclair, 2006) . The influences of one-off events on tourism demand are normally accounted for by the use of dummy variables in the demand model (Wang, 2009) . The results of the econometric models are very useful for tourism policy formulations especially when the influencing factors change or when a one-off event occurs . However, the policy implications may be restricted to tourism policy makers only since the wider economic impact of tourism at macroeconomic and industry levels cannot be evaluated by the econometric models.",

For example, if the foot and mouth disease decreased the inbound tourism demand in the UK, there would be a flow of the value of labour and capital use from tourism to non-tourism sectors, such as the primary sector. The increase in the supply of labour and capital would decrease the costs in primary sectors and then reduce the prices of their products, such as agricultural products, which would decrease the retail price of food. As food is central to the catering sector, the decrease in food prices would decrease catering prices. This is just a simple example and the real economic feedback effects are more complex as changes in economic sectors affect each other. Most studies using CGE or I-O models to evaluate the impact of one-off events on tourism/economy are based on secondary data and simulations. None of the studies are based on more accurate estimates of the economic losses/gains from the econometric models. This paper fills in this gap by combining the two methods.",

The outer part suggests that the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 1989 Tian'an Men Square Incident affected tourism and the economy through two channelsthe event itself and visa control. An event can have either positive or negative influences on the demand for tourism. Organized special events normally bring positive effects by enhancing awareness, building new images and attracting additional tourists. Crises, however, bring negative effects to the destination. Both types of events can jointly affect the industry and the economy as a whole. Visa restrictions generally have negative economic influences on the destination economy. When considering these two factors (the event itself and associated visa restriction), the overall impact can either be negative or positive. This framework is applied to both types of events using the same modelling approach. The inner part depicts the connection of the two modelling methods in the assessment-the econometric and CGE models. The input of the econometric models includes economic variables such as tourists' income, tourism price, the substitute prices and the dummy variables, which capture the tourism influence of the one-off events, especially the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 1989 Tian'an Men Square Incident. The outputs (results) of the econometric models are the tourism impacts of one-off events which are the inputs of the CGE models. The econometric models provide the key parameter-price Figure 2 . A Framework of this Research elasticity for the CGE models. The outputs (results) of the CGE models are the economic impacts. These refer to the welfare losses/gains at the macroeconomic level and to the economic indicators such as the values of labour and capital, imports and exports and prices at the industry level. This research presents the economic impact of the Beijing Olympics and the Tian'an Men Square Incident on tourism and its related sectors by considering the events themselves and the visa restrictions in force at the time. Song et al. (2012) identified the input parameters, which are the price elasticities of tourism demand by international tourists. The effects of the two events on the demand for tourism in China in terms of both arrivals and receipts form the basis of the CGE modelling exercise in the following section. The econometric models used by Song et al. (2012) are known as the autoregressive distributed lag model. The Tian'an Men Square Incident, the 2008 Olympics, visa restrictions, severe acute respiratory syndrome and the 2008 financial crisis were accounted for by dummy variables. Table 1 presents the price elasticities of inbound tourism demand to China and Beijing from various source markets.",

At the macroeconomic level, instead of evaluating the economic impact in terms of GDP, which has been used in most studies, this paper uses equivalent variation (EV) to measure the welfare impacts of the economic losses/gains due to the two one-off events in monetary terms. EV is defined here as ''the amount of extra income that, at unchanged prices, would allow consumers to reach the utility that they actually reach as a result of a policy change, or other exogenous shock'' (Fane & Ahammad, 2003, p. 176) . EV is ''the amount of income that would have to be given to (or taken away from) the economy before the policy change (or an external shock) to leave the economy as well off as the economy would be after the policy change'' (Andriamananjara et al., 2004, p. 17) . Besides, EV is the economic indicator that is more frequently used to measure welfare in CGE modelling in the literature (see Ahmed, 2008; Fane & Ahammad, 2003; Margaret & Mabugu, 2008; Ye, Lee, & Chen, 2006) . Maximising gross state product at the state level or GDP at the national level is second best to maximising the economic welfare. GDP includes increased income earned by non-resident owners of capital, non-resident labour and the government through taxes while welfare can measure the wellbeing of local residents (Abelson, 2011) . In this case, EV might have more policy implications than GDP as policy strategies on a one-off event should depend largely on the effect of welfare on local residents. Table 2 shows that both the events themselves and the associated visa restrictions related to the 1989 Tian'an Men Square Incident and the 2008 Beijing Olympics reduced China's inbound tourist arrivals and decreased China's tourism receipts from the ten origin countries under consideration. Visa restrictions were responsible for larger losses to tourism receipts, which were $-88.232 million as a result of the 1989 Incident and $-963.860 million as a result of the 2008 Olympics.",

            "text": "Economic impacts of China's inbound tourism caused by the 2008 Olympics and the 1989 Incident are depicted in Tables 3 and 4. The input of CGE models-the economic consequences of tourism receipts were generated from the econometric models and the key output of CGE models at macroeconomic level are the welfare losses as a result of the events themselves and visa restrictions, respectively. The rest of Table 3 gives the results of CGE models. The economic loss of tourism receipts caused by the 1989 Tian'an Men Square Incident brought relatively small welfare losses, i.e., $2.111 million as a result of the Incident and $2.847 million as a result of visa restrictions (see Table 3 ). The welfare losses caused by the 2008 Beijing Olympics were much greater. One would expect a crisis to cause a larger welfare loss than a special event, which supposedly should bring welfare gains by attracting more tourists. However, this is not what we have found, for several possible reasons. Notes: (a) Korea and Malaysia are omitted from the 1989 dummies because data before 1994 are not available for them. Therefore, loss of tourist arrivals, i.e. (1), is calculated by adding the differences in tourist arrivals from eight countries when the 1989 dummy (D89) equals to 1 and 0; (b) Gain/loss of tourist arrivals for the Beijing Olympics in 2008, i.e. (1), is calculated by adding the differences in tourist arrivals from ten countries ( (2) and (3) are adjusted to 2008 price levels. First, the scale of inbound tourism in China in 1989 was much smaller than that in 2008 and thus the decrease in inbound tourism demand in 1989 was likely to be small. Second, the negative welfare change due to the Olympics itself could be explained by the crowding out effect superseding positive tourism effects. Most policy makers have overlooked the crowding out effect. However, it can play a dominant role. The crowding out of inbound tourism means that inbound tourists either cancel their trips or change their plans of visiting an event host country to avoid traffic jams, long queues, noises, security concerns and increased prices (Li & Blake, 2009 ). Third, visa restrictions during the Olympics caused the largest welfare loss ($-963.86 ). This welfare loss occurred when inbound tourists could not come to China because they had not been able to obtain a visa. Fourth, every unit change in real tourism consumption would reduce welfare for the 2008 event more than it would for the 1989 event. Welfare loss per change in real tourism consumption (6) is around 0.20 for the 2008 Olympics, which is almost seven times higher than it was for the 1989 Incident (about 0.03). One reason might be that when one unit of tourism spending flows into tourism-related sectors, such as hotel, and further money then flows along the supply chain, for example food processing and agriculture, employees in these sectors earn extra income from tourists' spending. Since the income level in 2008 is higher than that in 1989, the extra income received per unit of tourism spending is higher in 2008 than that in 1989.",

This occurred because of a small decrease in the price of inbound tourism consumption (4), which slightly offset the decrease in real tourism spending. When tourism demand decreases because of a one-off event, the supply may remain unchanged, which then leads to a decrease in equilibrium price. The smallest percentage of price decrease in inbound tourism (\u00c00.009) is due to the 2008 Olympics. This may be because between 2002, when Beijing was chosen to host the Games, and the Games themselves in 2008, there was sufficient time to adjust the supply to meet the demand while the 1989 Incident happened suddenly without leaving sufficient time for the supply to be adjusted.",

Primary industries include the agricultural sector; secondary industries include manufacturing sectors such as food production, coal mining and chemical manufacturing; the tertiary industry consists of service providers such as transportation, accommodation, catering and entertainment. In general, the economic effects at the industry level caused by visa restrictions were larger than the impacts generated by the events themselves (see Table 4 ). The industry results show that both events have reduced changes in the value of labour and capital uses, percentage change in price index and output of tertiary industry in 1989 and 2008 since tourism-related sectors belong to the tertiary industry which suffered from the economic loss of tourism demand.",

When inbound tourism demand decreases and tourism supply and production increase correspondingly, the result is a flow of production factors, for example labour and capital, from tourism to non-tourism related sectors. CGE modelling captures the allocation effects, which have been observed in the literature (Blake, 2005; Li et al., 2010 Li et al., , 2011 Madden, 2002) . It can also be observed that primary industry experienced a smaller increase in 2008 than it did in 1989, although the economic loss in 2008 was larger. This might be because of the industry structure of the two years. The proportion of primary industry in GDP composition decreased steadily from about 30% in the late 1980s to about 10% in 2010 according to the China Statistical Yearbook.",

However, visa restrictions reduced the number of inbound tourists by 270.381 thousand and tourism receipts by $294.185 million. Due to lack of data, the economic consequences of Beijing's inbound tourism receipts are not calculated for the 1989 Tian'an Men Square Incident. Table 5 is calculated based on Table 5 . Table 6 shows that the event itself had an opposite effect from visa restrictions. Visa restrictions caused a welfare loss of $73.957 million brought by a $282.130 million decrease in real tourism consumption. This means that every $100 decrease in real tourism consumption caused a $26.2 million decrease in welfare (6). The percentage of price of inbound tourism consumption decreased by 0.328. However, unlike the negative impacts in China, the event itself generated a small welfare gain of only $21.421 million which was stimulated by an increase of $80.975 million in real tourism consumption. Although congestion, overpriced hotel rooms, traffic jams and security concerns may have crowded out some potential inbound tourists to Beijing, the Olympics At the industry level, visa restrictions reduced the value of labour and capital use and the percentage of output in tertiary industry (Table 7 ). Like the industry-level impact of China's inbound tourism, allocation effects explain the flow of labour and capital into the primary and secondary industries. A decrease in inbound tourism demand as a result of visa restrictions led to a decreased price index for all industries. As to the industry impacts contributed by the event itself, the Olympics brought a small stimulus to tourism sectors. The tertiary industry benefited from employment and capital use and output growth, while the primary and secondary industries were crowded out with a decrease in these indicators. The price index was bid up by a small increase in inbound tourism demand because of the Olympics.",

This study uses econometric modelling and CGE modelling. Combining the strengths of both methods is rare in the tourism literature but could generate more reliable results and more useful policy recommendations. The autoregressive distributed lag model, which considers the time path of the tourist decision-making process, is used to evaluate changes in the number of tourists in the course of a one-off event. The tourism effects are taken as the model input for the CGE models which then evaluate the economic impact of inbound tourism in terms of the change in welfare at the macroeconomic level and changes in labour and capital use, percentage changes in price index and output at the industry level. CGE models take into account all economic agentsproduction sectors, factors, household, government, and international trade-and are able to capture their feedback effects.",

During a one-off event, priority is normally given to security risks, so the number of visas has to be limited. Although the findings of this paper show that the use of visa restrictions could cause a large welfare loss, this study does not suggest granting visas freely. In order to mitigate the economic risk of smaller number of inbound tourists and the accompanying loss of revenue, governments can use public spending to subsidise the tourism sectors if they suffer, and use marketing strategies to promote one-off events during and after the events by improving tourists' negative perceptions of a destination. If visa restrictions are relaxed, then governments must engage in direct actions, such as quickly moving armed forces, managing tourist flows, and extensively adopting technologies of social control, such as security cameras (Jennings & Lodge, 2011) .",
