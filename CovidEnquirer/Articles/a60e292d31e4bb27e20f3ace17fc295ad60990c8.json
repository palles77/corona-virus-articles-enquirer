Business travelers were more likely to be men, had short times to departure and shorter trip durations, and commonly refused influenza, meningococcal, and hepatitis B vaccines. Most business travelers indicated that employers suggested the pre-travel health consultation, whereas non-occupational travelers sought consultations because of travel health concerns. Conclusions: Sub-groups of occupational travelers have characteristic profiles, with business travelers being particularly distinct. Employers play a role in encouraging business travelers to seek pretravel consultations. Such consultations, even if scheduled immediately before travel, can identify vaccination gaps and increase coverage.",

Many infections associated with occupational travel can be prevented by simple preventative measures, such as vaccines, medications, and health advice.",

Anyone born in the 50 US states or US Virgin Islands was considered ''US born.'' Health care providers verified the information provided by the traveler and also recorded the patient's previous vaccination status, vaccinations and chemoprophylaxis that were recommended, and health education that was provided. If a recommended vaccination was not given, the provider was prompted to give a reason for non-vaccination, including the following: vaccine was not available, insufficient time for completion before departure, patient declined, referral to primary care provider for administration, or medical contraindication. For rabies vaccine, clinicians were prompted to provide a reason if the vaccine was not recommended for those traveling for longer than 1 month (defined as 28 days).",

For this analysis, MMR, influenza, varicella and tetanus vaccines were defined as generally recommended for all travelers before departure if they were not already immune. The proportion of travelers vaccinated for hepatitis A, hepatitis B ,and typhoid was assessed for specific groups going to endemic countries (high-and intermediate-risk countries for hepatitis A and B; highrisk countries for typhoid) based on the most current CDC recommendations available at the time of the consultation. 9,10 The proportion of travelers vaccinated for polio, rabies, meningococcal disease, JE, and YF was assessed for specific groups of at-risk travelers who met criteria (eg, destination country with risk, season with risk, duration of stay, or indicated for the itinerary) for recommended vaccination; a more extensive description of travelers who were considered at risk is available elsewhere. 11 For all vaccines, if the clinician indicated existing immunity or if the traveler received at least the first dose of a vaccine series at the pre-travel consultation, the traveler was considered, for this analysis, vaccinated for that disease. To analyze reasons for nonvaccination, we excluded those who were previously immune, were vaccinated at the clinic visit, or for whom information was not known.",

For leisure and VFR travelers, the proportion with immunity was at least 80% for tetanus, YF, and typhoid. Clinicians reported that 78% of business travelers had pre-existing immunity for MMR (28% of those who had pre-existing immunity were born before 1957) and an additional 11% received vaccination at the pretravel consultation. Thirty-eight percent of business travelers had pre-existing immunity to influenza, and an additional of 29% received vaccinations with the pre-travel visit.

Like our investigation, other studies have also found that business travelers are predominantly men. 14, 15 Within the occupational category, missionary and nonmedical service workers sought pre-travel advice at least a month ahead of their travel date. In contrast, only half of business travelers sought pre-travel advice within 2 weeks of travel; a finding also noted in previous research. 16 The need for business travel can occur suddenly, leading to shorter preparation time 17 ; however, business travelers may know about their trip further in advance than the timing of their pre-travel health appointment may indicate. In fact, the US Department of Commerce Office of Trade and Tourism found that people reporting travel for business and convention purposes planned their trip a median of 30 days in advance, and airline reservations were made a median of 21 days in advance. 2 It is not known from our analysis how far in advance travelers planned their itineraries or if there was a delay in seeking pre-travel health consultations after plans were finalized.",

In support of this, we found that GTEN clinicians reported insufficient time for some business travelers to complete the series of JE, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and rabies vaccines. Travelers would benefit from having their pre-travel health consultations as soon as travel is booked to complete or follow accelerated vaccine schedules. Many companies make pre-travel health consultations mandatory during the airline ticket-issuing process. 16 Alternatively, if general business travel is anticipated, travelers should consider pre-emptive vaccination to ensure full coverage before last-minute travel. 17 Although GTEN does not collect information on risk perception, last minute travelers believe that their disease risk is lower. 18 Travelers should also consider the placement of their international worksites; because many facilities are located outside of cities, travelers and clinicians need to consider both urban and peri-urban exposures to mosquitoes, and thus mosquito-borne illnesses. Pre-travel health consultations sought well in advance ensures that proper risk assessments and guidance can be acted upon for each traveler's destination.",

Both leisure travelers and VFRs had significantly longer stays of 14 and 30 days, respectively. All travelers, but especially short-term travelers, may not fully recognize the illness and injury risks associated with international travel. 4, 16 Business travelers often do not consider unexpected risks, such as those associated with unanticipated medical treatment or casual sexual activity. 19 In addition, business travelers often travel multiple times a year. 2 We did not collect information on the number of trips taken each year by the travelers; however, each trip can contribute to the risk of a travel-related illness. Clinicians seeing travelers should consider this cumulative risk assessment when advising business travelers and consider interventions, such as vaccinations, an investment for future trips. 7 The pre-travel health consultations described here increased the vaccination coverage for all of the vaccines and provided malaria prescriptions for most travelers, although several gaps still remain. Of particular interest, many business (49%), leisure (44%), and VFR (61%) travelers declined influenza vaccine. Despite high morbidity and mortality rates associated with influenza, a significant proportion of the US population chooses not to get vaccinated against the disease. 20 According to CDC estimates, only 42.8% of all people older than 2 years, and 48.4% of people with high-risk indications between the ages of 18 and 64 years were vaccinated against influenza in the 2010 to 2011 season. 21 A GeoSentinel analysis of returned ill travelers found that business travel was associated with influenza. 22 Further, a study of Swiss business travelers found that only 27% had their annual influenza vaccination. 23 In addition to reducing the risk of decreased productivity due to illness, increasing influenza vaccination coverage in travelers can prevent the translocation of disease back to coworkers in the United States. It is beneficial for employers to emphasize the importance of vaccination, especially influenza vaccine.",

Although we were unable to elucidate whether travelers in our data set have employersponsored insurance or the employer was paying directly for the appointment and/or medications and vaccines, employers played a role in directing the travelers to the clinics. It is the traveler's responsibility to obtain pre-travel health advice, but employers also have a responsibility to ensure the well-being of their employees during and after business-related travel. This employer responsibility is not only to the travelers themselves, but also to employees who remain behind in the United States. Infections and injuries in business travelers not only negatively affect the travelers themselves but also have negative consequences for the business. Illness may disrupt business activities during or after travel, cause loss of time and productivity, and increase medical costs. 24 One study found higher rates of medical claims for almost all diseases categories after international travel by business travelers compared with their non-traveling colleagues; many claims were related to infectious diseases. 25 History has shown that diseases such as SARS, hepatitis A, measles, and tuberculosis have all been transmitted by individuals traveling for business and other occupational travelers [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] ; and infections such as these may be transmitted to non-traveling employees or the traveler's community. It should be noted that occupational travelers and especially business travelers are more likely to visit Asia than VFRs or leisure travelers so the groups have different destination patterns and infectious disease risks. Although employers may shoulder the costs of the pre-travel health consultations, the costs of ill employees may be higher. 31 To prevent illness in travelers and the translocation of disease to employees in the United States, employers can increase the proportion of travelers seeking timely pre-travel care by developing corporate health strategies, providing travel-related health education to improve risk perceptions, planning trips ahead of time when possible, and allowing time for health consultations for travelers with short time to departures.",

GTEN data, although geographically distributed, may not be representative of the general traveling population, or business travelers in particular; however, our findings are consistent with those of other studies. We focused only on travelers who listed a single purpose of travel and therefore did not explore further those who listed multiple purposes of travel. In addition, purpose of travel was self-selected by travelers, and we focused specifically on those who chose business or other occupational or service as their purpose for travel. There was no additional information, such as whether the traveler received compensation, to support that these travelers were unquestionably occupational or non-occupational. We also recognize that our category of occupational travelers includes a number of sub-groups, which is the reason that we performed sub-analyses. Finally, because sub-national destination data were not available, we could only assess the suitability of malaria chemoprophylaxis recommendations in those traveling to countries where malaria was a risk throughout. Further, GTEN does not systematically collect information on patients who did not receive a prescription for malaria chemoprophylaxis; however, analysis of text fields provided limited information. Despite these limitations, our study is, to our knowledge, the largest analysis of detailed pre-travel health consultations prior to business and occupational-related travel, including data on over 9000 occupational travelers. In this era of large multinational corporations and outsourcing, our findings are of interest to businesses, and particularly to health care workers charged with caring for individuals whose work assignment involves international travel.",

Business travelers have a distinct profile when compared with other occupational and non-occupational travelers. Employers play a role in encouraging business travelers to seek pre-travel health consultations. Such consultations, even if scheduled immediately before travel, can be an opportunity to identify vaccination gaps and to increase coverage to lessen the likelihood of illness among travelers and importation of pathogens into home and work communities.",
