But the pattern of the decrease in food intake (a decrease in either meal size and meal number or both) during spontaneous viral infection has not been previously characterized. We observed the onset of anorexia and an abnormal feeding pattern during an opportunistic SDA viral infection in our rat colony. We thus studied seven male rats. Before the viral infection there was a positive association between food intake and meal number ( P < .05). After infection food intake decreased by 68%. This occurred via a significant decrease in meal size (by 69%) ( P < .05); and a nonsignificant decrease in meal number (P = .71). This pattern of decreased food intake is similar to that occurring during indomethacin-induced ulcerative ileitis, where we previously measured an increase in plasma tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)a. Anorexia in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide administration, which is also linked to plasma TNF-a, is however, caused only via a decrease in meal number. The differences in the decrease in the feeding pattern between the SDA viral and a bacterial infection suggest that factors other than TNF-a alone play a significant role in the mechanism of anorexia during a viral infection.

In a chronic disease such as cancer, the chronicity of anorexia leads to malnutrition, body weight loss and eventually cachexia [2] . The mechanism(s) of anorexia is multifactorial and includes both peripheral and central factors [3] , which await further identification.",

Under normal conditions, the constancy of daily food intake is maintained via a reciprocal change in meal size and meal number. This suggests that meal size and meal number be regulated independently via closely coordinated systems [4 \u00b16 ]. Under pathological conditions, a reduction of food intake occurs via a reduction of either meal size or meal number or both, thus providing insights into the etiology and the possible mechanisms of the pathogenesis of eating behavior [6] . An Automated Computerized Rat Eater Meter (ACREM; [7] ), which measures individual meal size and meal number as well as food intake for prolonged periods, provides us with the ability to characterize the biological manifestations associated with feeding behavior including anorexia.",

Our data showed that anorexia during the SDA viral infection occurred predominantly via a decrease in meal size. Meal number did not decrease significantly, and did not simultaneously increase in a compensatory manner, in an attempt to maintain constancy of food intake, so consequently, food intake decreased, which was associated with body weight loss.",

The average decrease in food intake per rat was about 6.4 g/day. This calculates to an average decrease of 21.2 kcal/day/rat. For maintenance, a rat needs approximately 110 kcal/kg 0.75 / day [12] , which corresponds to 40.6 kcal/day for the average rat in this study which weighed 265 g. The rats started out eating an average of 17 g/day, which equals 37.3 kcal/day. The difference is probably attributable to errors inherent in averaging both the animal weights and food intake. Over the 10-day period of decreased intake, this was reduced by 21.2 kcal/day to an average intake of 16 kcal/day. Since they require about 40 kcal/day and they were taking in 16 kcal/ day, there was a net loss of 24 kcal/day. Conversion of protein, fats, and carbohydrates produces an average gain of approximately 6.4 kcal/g [13] . This roughly corresponds to an average weight loss of about 3.75 g/day or 37.5 g/rat over the 10-day period of decreased intake. It appears that the average rat lost approximately 30 g; the difference being attributable to averaging variable of animals, imprecision in the calculations, and other factors that make this only an estimation. It would appear that the entire loss of body weight could be accounted for by the decrease in food intake, although other unmeasured factors (such as changes in metabolic requirements) were not examined.",

This decrease in meal size correlated negatively with plasma TNF-a [18] . Even when considering difference in gender and rat strain, the changes in food intake and feeding pattern between the SDA viral infection and the indomethacininduced ulcerative ileitis model is similar. These changes have not been previously observed in the other rat models in both genders (e.g., in MCA sarcoma-bearing female Fischer-344 rat model, food intake decreases only via a decrease in meal number; [35] ). Thus, the similarity in pattern of decreased food intake during the SDA viral infection and that during indomethacin-induced ulcerative ileitis, suggests a mechanistic link between viral infection, TNF-a, and anorexia. Furthermore, data that an infection with the influenza virus is associated with increased TNF-a activity in lung lavage fluid of male Swiss \u00b1 Webster mice [11] , and the manifestation of severe anorexia even in IL-1bdeficient mice [10] , suggest a significant and limited role of TNF-a and IL-1b in anorexia during a viral infection, respectively.",
