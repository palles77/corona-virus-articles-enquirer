            "text": "Background: The airborne spreading of enteric viruses can occur through the aerosol and droplets produced by toilet flushing. These can contaminate the surrounding environment, but few data exist to estimate the risk of exposure and infection. For this reason environmental monitoring of air and selected surfaces was carried out in 2 toilets of an office building and in 3 toilets of a hospital before and after cleaning operations. Methods: To reveal the presence of norovirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus, human rotavirus, and Torque teno virus and to quantify human adenovirus and bacteria counts, molecular and cultural methods were used. Results: On the whole, viruses were detected on 78% of surfaces and in 81% of aerosol. Among the researched viruses, only human adenovirus and Torque teno virus were found in both surface and air samples. In several cases the same adenovirus strain was concurrently found in all matrices. Bacterial counts were unrelated to viral presence and cleaning did not seem to substantially reduce contamination. Conclusions: The data collected in our study confirm that toilets are an important source of viral contamination, mainly in health care settings, where disinfection can have a crucial role in preventing virus spread.",

Evidence for the role of air and surfaces for viral transmission can be drawn from studies regarding air and fomite contamination, studies of the transfer and survival of viruses, from experimental trials in human volunteers, from epidemiologic data, and from disinfection studies. 3 Hygiene and disinfection intervention studies have demonstrated that proper cleaning of hands and efficient disinfection of fomites decreases surface contamination and may interrupt the spread of disease caused by norovirus, rotavirus, and coronavirus. 4 The role of airborne viral spreading is not well defined because of the difficulties in identifying this transmission route for single cases or outbreaks. Nevertheless, person-to-person transmission could also be due to environmental contamination by suspended or settled aerosol droplets. For example, during the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic transmission was believed to occur primarily by direct physical contact with ill persons or by large-droplet spread; however, several clusters of infection were difficult to explain by these routes and many health care workers were infected despite compliance with World Health Organization infection control guidelines. 5, 6 The role of aerosol and surface contamination in the transmission of viral infection in hospitals is generally recognized, 7, 8 but its sources and dimensions are not deeply studied because of the difficulties in measuring environmental virus contamination and its relation to specific clinical cases. 9, 10 In addition to respiratory droplets, toilets should be considered as a possible source of indoor air and surface viral contamination. In fact, consistent microbial contamination of the indoor environment typically occurs after a toilet flush, and this can be an important source of diffusion, not only for enteric viruses, but also for respiratory ones, which are also often eliminated by the fecal route. A toilet flush generates a large number of droplets of different dimensions: the largest droplets settle rapidly on the surrounding surfaces, whereas the smallest can be inhaled or remain airborne for a long time. 11, 12 Despite the long-standing evidence of toilet flush as an important source of infective aerosol, a systematic study of toilet flush contamination as it affects risk assessment has not yet been completed, especially regarding viral contamination. Nevertheless, from the perspective of risk management, the quantitative assessment of this putative method of exposure would be of utmost importance to select control measures and define the points where they can be successfully applied. To this aim, environmental monitoring was carried out in toilets of a hospital unit (nephrology) and of an office building. Aerosol and surface samples were collected and analyzed for total bacterial count (TVBC), assessing hygienic conditions and the effectiveness of cleaning procedures, and the presence of human viruses. These were chosen taking into account the results of our previous study 9 and to represent different mechanisms of diffusion: norovirus, genogroups I and II (NoV GI and GII) and human rotavirus (HRV) for the fecaleoral route, rhinovirus (RV) and TTV for the respiratory route, and human adenovirus (HAdV) and enterovirus (EV) for both.",

Among the hospital toilets, 1 was dedicated to health care personnel and the other 4 were adjacent to patient rooms (3 from 2-bed rooms and 1 from a 4-bed room). For each toilet, at least 5 replicate sampling campaigns were conducted. In each campaign, 2 sets of samples were collected: 1 before and 1 after the application of a cleaning procedure. In each toilet and for each set of samples, 1 aerosol and 4 surface samples were collected. The surfaces were chosen to reflect the potential for hand contamination: the toilet seat and its cover, the flushing handle/ button, and the internal door handle. In addition to air and surfaces, the water inside each toilet was also sampled as the possible source of the environment contamination. In total, 172 surfaces (108 and 64 for hospital and offices, respectively), 43 air (27 and 16 for hospital and offices, respectively), and 19 water (4 and 15 for hospital and offices, respectively) samples were collected.",

A very important source of contamination from toilets seems to be droplets coming from toilet flush and settling on surfaces, as demonstrated by the high correspondence between the HAdV strains found in water and on surfaces.

HAdV showed the highest dissemination, thus confirming its possible role as an indicator of viral contamination of air and surfaces, as already proposed for water. 21 On the contrary, for TTV, a marked difference was observed between the hospital and offices; it is possible that in health care settings this virus is more widely spread due to the greater presence of people with impaired immune response. 22 On the other hand, as we previously observed, but in contrast with other studies, 8 the other viruses we investigated were almost absent: only 1 sample was found to be positive for NoV GII and no NoV GI, EV, RV, or HRV were detected. A possible explanation of this observation can be the different epidemiologic diffusion of these agents. In fact, both HAdV and TTV are normally eliminated by feces even in the absence of clinical disease and are very common in the population, as demonstrated by sewage monitoring, 23 whereas the circulation of the other viruses we searched is more limited, more often linked to clinical cases, and dependent on alternative mechanisms of transmission based on the oralefecal route. During virologic monitoring, an epidemiologic surveillance of symptomatic infections, based on the observation of fever and diarrhea, did not show evident cases of simultaneous presence of target viruses in environment and patients samples (data not shown).",

This poses a problem particularly when virologic monitoring is used to verify the efficacy of disinfection procedures. Studies on HAdV survival in comparison with DNA persistence following chemical disinfection 9 showed a difference of 1 log due to PCR detection of DNA originating from inactive virus. Moreover, when comparing the results of the virologic analysis of surfaces before and after disinfection, the HAdV positivity and titers seem to increase even if not significantly, whereas the values of TVBC decrease, mainly in the hospital. The reason for this contradiction seems to be the interference of dirtiness on PCR enzymes, as demonstrated by our experiments on artificially contaminated surfaces, as well as previous studies. 27 Thus, before using molecular assays to verify the efficiency of disinfection measures, the sensitivity of analytical tests should be carefully evaluated in the presence of different concentrations of organic substances. From these data, we can conclude that molecular data on surfaces before disinfection are affected by underestimation due to interference by organic substances on PCR and data obtained after disinfection are affected by overestimation due to the detection of noninfective DNA. Thus, the validity of TVBC abatement for predicting virus removal should be assessed through further investigation.",
