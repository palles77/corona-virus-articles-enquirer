            "text": "The major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC class I) peptide tetramer is a sensitive and valuable tool to evaluate antigenspecific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) of many animal species. To date, no chicken MHC class I peptide tetramer has been reported. In this report, we describe construction and functional evaluation of a chicken MHC-I (BF2*15)/peptide tetramer. To construct the chicken MHC class I peptide tetramer, genes of the chicken MHC-I a chain (BF2*15) and b2 microglobulin (Chb2m) were synthesized by RT-PCR from the total RNA of PBMCs and the signal sequences were deleted. The BF2*15 was then fused with the BirA substrate peptide (BSP) sequence at the C terminus. Next, the synthesized PCR products of BF2*15 and Chb2m were cloned into the expression vector pET-28a (+) and expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). Highly purified BF2*15-BSP heavy chain and Chb2m were obtained by a Ni 2+ NTA column affinity purification, yielding approximately 1.6 mg of BF2*15-BSP and 2.4 mg of Chb2m per 1 g of the pelleted bacteria. The purified BF2*15-BSP heavy chain and Chb2m were refolded with synthetic peptide originated from infectious bronchitis virus nucleoprotein (IBV N 71-78 ) in refolding buffer to generate the monomer of BF2*15/peptide complex. The monomer was then biotinylated and tetramerized using PE-labeled streptavidin. Upon functional evaluation of the construct by using flowcytometry, we observed that 3.65% of CTLs were specific to IBV nucleoprotein. This demonstrates that the CTL response of IBV-infected chicks could effectively be evaluated using the prepared MHC-I BF2*15/ peptide tetramer. #",

            "text": "The classical MHC class I is a membrane surface protein found on virtually all cells in the body, and its main function is to bind antigenic peptides and present them on the surface of virally infected or tumor cells (Kindt et al., 2007) . CTLs recognize antigenic peptides, in the context of MHC class I molecules on the cell surface, viatheir TCR and, upon recognition, lyse these target cells. Therefore, it is important to quantitatively measure antigen-specific T-cells accurately and promptly. Until the development of MHC-I tetramer technology, the main techniques for functional and quantitative measurement of antigen-specific T-cells were limiting dilution assay (LDA), enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT), and intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) in conjunction with flow cytometry (Taswell, 1981; Jung, 1993; Scheibenbogen et al., 1997 Scheibenbogen et al., , 2000 . www.elsevier.com/locate/vetimm Available online at www.sciencedirect.com Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 122 (2008) 1-7 Altman et al. (1996) first described the use of HLA (human leucocyte antigen)-peptide tetrameric complexes to directly visualize antigen-specific CTLs by flow cytometry. This technique is not dependent on proliferation of the cells and therefore allows the direct quantification of antigen-specific CTLs without in vitro manipulation (Meidenbauer et al., 2003) . To date, this technique has been applied successfully to study cellmediated immunity on human (HLA), mouse (H-2, mouse MHC), macaque (MAMU, macaque MHC), chimpanzee (PATR, chimpanzee MHC), horse (ELA, equine leucocyte antigen), and pig (SLA, swine leucocyte antigen) (Dunbar et al., 1998; Donahoe et al., 2000; Kalergis et al., 2000; Oleksiewicz et al., 2002; Skinner et al., 2000; Meidenbauer et al., 2003; Mealey et al., 2005) .",

Within a 44 kb DNA segment, there are two loci-encoding class I heavy chains named BF1 and BF2. The BF2 locus is dominantly expressed, whereas the BF1 locus is less expressed and has a lower mRNA transcript (Kaufman et al., 1999; Miller et al., 2004) .

The full-length BF2*15 and Chb2m cDNA were cloned by RT-PCR. Oligonucleotide primers were designed according to the entire coding region of BF2*15 and Chb2m cDNA sequences reported in GenBank (accession numbers: L28958 and M84767); the sequences of forward and reverse primers of the BF2*15 and Chb2m were as follows: BF2*15 forward: 5 0 -TGC AGC GGT GCG AGG CGA T-3 0 , BF2*15 reverse: 5 0 -TTA TTT CAC AGG AAG CAG TGC-3 0 ; Chb2m forward: 5 0 -ACA GCG GAG CCA TGG GGA A-3 0 , Chb2m reverse: 5 0 -ATC CCG GGC ACA GCT CAG A-3 0 . Reverse transcription reaction was conducted at 42 8C for 2 h using AMV Reverse Transcriptase XL (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). PCR amplifications were performed using the LA-Taq DNA polymerase system (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) under the following conditions: starting at 95 8C for 5 min for denaturation, followed by 35 cycles at 94 8C for 1 min, at 60 8C for 1 min, at 72 8C for 1 min, and then at 72 8C for 10 min for extension. The PCR products were inserted into the pMD18-T vector (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The positive clones with the correct sequence were named as pMD-BF2*15 and pMD-Chb2m. The signal peptides of BF2*15 and Chb2m genes were predicted with SignalP (Bendtsen et al., 2004) and the sequence of the signal peptide in the BF2*15 gene was deleted. In addition, a 15-amino acid residue substrate peptide for BirA-dependent biotinylation was fused to the COOH terminus of BF2*15 through the EcoRI and HindIII site adapters with the forward primer 5 0 -GGA ATT CAT GGG GCC GTG CGG GG-3 0 and the reverse primer 5 0 -GCG CAA GCT TTT AAC GAT GAT TCC ACA CCA TTT TCT GTG CAT CCA GAA TAT GAT GCA GGATGG AGG GGT TGC TCC CGG G-3 0 , using the pMD-BF2*15 plasmid as the template. The signal peptide of the Chb2m gene was also deleted using EcoRI and HindIII site adapters with the forward primer 5 0 -GGA ATT CAT GGG GAA GGC GGC GGC-3 0 and the reverse primer 5 0 -GCG CAA GCT TTT AGA ACT CGG GAT CCC A-3 0 , using the pMD-Cb2m plasmid as the template. The amplified DNAs were digested with EcoRI and HindIII, and ligated into prokaryotic expression vector, pET-28a (+) (Novagen, Madison, WI) at the EcoRI/HindIII site. Clones with the correct inserts were identified using PCR and restriction analysis of vectors carrying the recombinant DNA. Finally, the nucleotide sequences of the selected clones were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The positive clones were named as pET-BF2*15-BSP and pET-Chb2m.",

After biotinylation, the sample was run over a gel filtration column to purify the BF2*15/peptide fraction.

Then the two subunits refolded to form a BF2*15/peptide monomeric complex by dilution method in the presence of an antigenic peptide IBV N 71-78 . We adopted a procedure established by John Altman (NIH Tetramer Facility, www.niaid.nih.gov/ reposit/tetramer/index.html) into our protocol. The MHC complexes, in the refolding buffer, were directly concentrated instead of dialysing. This approach allows us to reuse the flowthrough, which contains most of the peptide, for a second (or even third) refolding. The monomeric complex was tetramerized by binding to fluorescently labeled streptavidin to generate BF2*15/ peptide tetramer. The results of flow cytometer analysis demonstrate that the prepared BF2*15-peptide tetramer can be used for detection of IBV nucleoprotein-specific CTLs in chicks.",

When the T-cells interact with the target cells, the T-cells recognize both the antigen displayed in cleft and MHC molecules. So, in this experiment, the positive signal detected in the two-color flow cytometry assay was enough to illustrate the peptide-specific CTL. However, it could be better to understand the peptide-specific CTL if there are two more controls, that is, to use the chickens with different MHC types and chickens infected with a different virus.",

Besides its potential use in the study of the overall evaluation of the T cell immune response, this tetramer can also be used to track the kinetics of the IBV-specific CTL response. Also, the BF2 tetramer can be used for the evaluation on CTL response specific to other chicken viruses by replacing the peptide in the peptide-binding groove of BF2 during refolding procedure. Additionally, few BF2-restricted T cell epitopes have been identified, thus far. The prepared BF2*15-peptide tetramer can be used as an effective tool for mapping the BF2-restricted T cell epitopes. Once more BF2restricted T cell epitopes have been mapped, this BF2*15-peptide tetramer can be more effectively used to investigate the CTL response to viral infection in the chicken.",
