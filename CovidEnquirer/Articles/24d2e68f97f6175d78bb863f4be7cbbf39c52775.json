S SHATTUCK coercion, political warfare, or sharp power. It relies on a hybrid approach with more of a transactional aspect. Beijing mostly offers carrots for countries to switch, but it does not shy away from using the stick when necessary. Since 2016, seven countriesthe Republic of Kiribati, Solomon Islands, Dominican Republic, Burkina Faso, Republic of El Salvador, Republic of Panama, and Democratic Republic of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe-have shifted ties from Taipei to Beijing. This is an \"either or\" choice; neither the ROC nor PRC permit countries to maintain diplomatic relations with both of them simultaneously. 3 The moves by these seven countries may not seem unusual as nearly every member of the United Nations has switched its diplomatic ties from the ROC to PRC since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949. Only 14 countries (plus the Holy See) maintain formal relations with the ROC, 4 while 180 countries have such ties with the PRC. What makes the recent round of switches different is that China is actively targeting, pressuring, and enticing Taiwan's remaining diplomatic allies as a way to coerce Tsai's government into accepting the \"1992 Consensus\" or adopting a more pro-China policy.",

With Beijing ending the truce and the seven switches taking place, the Tsai administration has accused China of engaging in \"checkbook\" or \"dollar\" diplomacy, in which Beijing dangles carrots to lure countries away from Taiwan. After the Solomon Islands switched to China in September 2019, an article in the People's Daily threatened that if Tsai were re-elected in January 2020, Taiwan would find itself without any diplomatic allies, \"As long as the DPP is in power, sooner or later Taiwan will have zero diplomatic allies left.\" 5 By threatening to take away the rest of its 3 The \"One China Policy\" has its roots in the Cold War when Chiang Kai-shek adamantly asserted that he would not \"coexist with bandits,\" meaning Mao Zedong's China.

One problem for this aspect of Beijing's strategy is that Taiwanese appear not to see formal diplomatic relations as an important issue. In September 2019, after Kiribati and the Solomon Islands terminated relations with Taiwan, the Taiwan Public Opinion Foundation released poll results stating that 53 percent of Taiwanese do not worry about losing diplomatic allies, while 43 percent find it worrying. 7 It is entirely possible that Taiwan could lose many, perhaps all, of its diplomatic allies during Tsai's second term-though the Kingdom of Eswatini has expressed its continued support for Taiwan, and the Holy See would have a hard time explaining such a switch due to China's poor record on human rights and exploitation, harassment, and violence against Chinese Catholics and adherents to other religions , particularly the Uyghurs interned in Xinjiang. The other 13 countries in the Pacific and Latin America and the Caribbean are more likely to succumb. 8 Should Taiwan accept this fate as inevitable? Should it follow the Tsai administration's recent affirmation that Taiwan would not resume Taiwan's prior and troubled practice of \"checkbook diplomacy\"? What can Taiwan do? Should the United States help Taiwan to maintain its remaining ranks of diplomatic allies? In the face of China's squeeze on Taiwan's international space, should Taiwan downplay formal diplomatic ties and emphasize its strong informal ties with major countries, such as the United States and Japan? This article seeks to provide a brief history of Taiwan's loss of diplomatic allies during and after the Cold War, followed by Taiwan's current dilemma. It will conclude with a likely future scenario and recommendations for the United States for combatting China's strategy to finish the \"race to zero.\"",

The United Kingdom-a close ally of the United States, but also the colonial power in vulnerable Hong Kong-did so in 1950. The trend continued throughout the 1950s and 1960s, and accelerated in the 1970s. The United Nations voted to accept the PRC and expel the ROC as the holder of the Chinese \"seat\" in 1971, which opened the floodgates for Taiwan's derecognition.

Only by recognizing this political foundation that embodies the one-China policy can institutional communication between the two sides continue.\" 9 Ma has continued to insist that his acceptance of the Consensus was key for Beijing to accommodate his administration and adopt the \"diplomatic truce.\" 10 During Ma's tenure, Beijing reportedly \"rejected overtures from several of Taiwan's diplomatic partners to establish formal ties with China.\" 11 Throughout the 2020 presidential campaign between KMT candidate and Kaohsiung Mayor Han Kuoyu and President Tsai, Ma spoke out against Tsai's prioritizing relations with the United States over developing cross-Strait relations.

After Tsai's victory, but before her inauguration, China permitted the Gambia to establish ties with the PRC-three years after it severed ties with the ROC. This move was the first indicator that poaching diplomatic allies would be part of Beijing's toughened line on relations with the new Tsai government. In her inaugural address, Tsai did not acknowledge or accept the \"1992 Consensus,\" but she did acknowledge that a meeting between representatives of Taipei and Beijing occurred in 1992. Tsai said that the meeting \"was done in a spirit of mutual understanding and a political attitude of seeking common ground while setting aside differences. I respect this historical fact.\" The closest that she came to mentioning the Consensus \"text\" was when she said, \"There was joint acknowledgement of setting aside differences to seek common ground. This is a historical fact.\" 13 These statements were not enough to satisfy Beijing, which views Tsai as a stealth agent of Taiwan independence (even though her first term in office has demonstrated a commitment to moderation and stability in cross-Strait relations).

For example, the United States sells Taiwan arms on a regular basis to defend itselfsomething much more important than the aggregate effect of Taiwan's formal relations. Other global powers continue to voice support for Taiwan in the international arena, engage in trade relations with Taiwan, and conduct a variety of people-to-people exchanges-essentially treating it as a state. Like the much larger group of states that do not have formal relations with Taiwan, the remaining 15 diplomatic partners do not recognize \"Taiwan\" as a state. Even the 15 maintain diplomatic relations not with \"Taiwan,\" but with the \"Republic of China.\" This makes diplomatic ties an ambiguous basis for a claim to statehood. If there is a state, it sure is Taiwan. As Taiwanese identity continues to strengthen as the younger generations who have no direct connection to Mainland China come of age, there is less of a domestic mandate for the \"Republic of China.\" Even President Tsai has begun referring to herself as the President of Taiwan (ROC)-when it is normally President of the Republic of China (Taiwan), Republic of China in Taiwan, or Republic of China Taiwan-thus putting \"Taiwan\" at the forefront. The KMT has criticized her for this practice; one KMT legislator said this might be considered treason. Whenever this criticism is levied, Tsai responds, \"I was elected by the 23 million people of this country, so it is not inappropriate to call myself president of Taiwan,\" and that when appropriate she would put \"ROC\" first. 25 Thus, formal diplomatic ties add relatively little to the legitimacy of any claim of Taiwan to statehood. Notably, the Taiwanese public does not seem gravely concerned: 53 percent do not worry about the issue, while 43 percent find it worrying. 26 The loss of ties might cost Taiwan little or nothing because Taiwan might respond SHATTUCK switching strategies. When the \"Republic of China\" loses all of its diplomatic allies, 27 then there is an argument for Taiwan no longer using the term and for \"Taiwan\" to be the prevailing country identifier. Beijing could be pushing Taiwan in this direction. As it poaches the remaining 15 diplomatic allies, Beijing might create the very thing is does not want to occur. As Jacques deLisle notes, Beijing should recognize that squeezing Taipei too hard-reducing its diplomatic partners to zero or near zero-could be counterproductive because it would be seen, plausibly and rightly, as a serious threat to Taiwan's security in an international order where the capacity to engage in formal international relations matters, legally and politically. Thus cornered, Taiwan might push back in any of several ways that would not serve Beijing's interests, including by simply switching to a strategy-one consistent with international law and international political reality-that drops a focus on diplomatic ties in favor of stressing Taiwan's impressively broad and deep informal relations with many countries. 28",

The bill calls for the State Department to consider, in certain cases as appropriate and in alignment with United States interests, increasing its economic, security, and diplomatic engagement with nations that have demonstrably strengthened, enhanced, or upgraded relations with Taiwan; and consider, in certain cases as appropriate and in alignment with United States interests, reducing its economic, security, and diplomatic engagement with nations that take serious or significant actions to undermine Taiwan. 41 In addition, rewarding or punishing countries depending on their relationships with Taiwan, the bill also calls for beginning negotiations for a U.S.-Taiwan free trade agreement, supporting Taiwan's inclusion in international organizations, and generally increasing U.S. support for Taiwan. The 2019 version of the bill passed the Senate with unanimous consent in October and is awaiting action in the House.",

SHATTUCK pursued consistently. Although consistent with U.S. interests in demonstrating opposition to China's efforts to expand its influence, especially in the Western Pacific, the Caribbean, and other regions that matter for U.S. security, attempting to deter diplomatic switches from Taiwan in some cases could jeopardize important U.S. interests in targeted countries-interests that often have nothing to do with Taiwan. The TAIPEI Act contains limiting language that recognizes such risks: \"in certain cases as appropriate and in alignment with United States interests.\" Implementing such policies might be ineffective or counterproductive. The introduction of the TAIPEI Act did not stop countries from switching, and the eventual passage of the bill likely will not either. Countries will make their independent assessment on whether Taiwan or China is more important to them. Attempts to pressure countries not to switch diplomatic relations could push countries making the switch to Beijing further into China's orbit. Holding back U.S. foreign aid, security assistance, or the like may provide an opening for Beijing to increase its influence in these countries by filling the gap.",

The first-ever Pacific Islands Dialogue, held in October 2019, is a possible model, although it would need to be expanded beyond a one-day event.

This help will be attractive to states that are wary of China's \"debt trap\" diplomacy. The United States has taken initial steps in this direction with the passage of the Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development (BUILD) Act of 2018, which calls for the United States \"to facilitate market-based private sector development and economic growth in less developed countries through the provision of credit, capital, and other financial support.\" 42 A smaller-scale version of China's BRI, the BUILD Act could have the secondary effect of reducing the likelihood that some of Taiwan's remaining diplomatic allies will sever formal relations with Taiwan to secure development funds from China. Adopting and implementing these policies will probably not stop Beijing's quest to squeeze Taiwan's by poaching all of its diplomatic allies. China has the capacity and the will to outspend and out-pressure Taiwan-and the United Statesin a competition over whether countries have diplomatic ties with Beijing or with Taipei. Nonetheless, working to foster closer relations between Taiwan and other states, and to maintain Taiwan's existing diplomatic relations, may give Taiwan some breathing room and serve American interests as well.",

They voiced the same concerns during the assembly meetings. When St. Lucia's representative spoke up for Taiwan, the Chinese delegation lodged a protest and cited UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 which states, \"[The UN] decides to restore all its rights to the People's Republic of China and to recognize the representatives of its Government as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations, and to expel forthwith the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek from the place which they unlawfully occupy at the United Nations and in all the organizations related to it.\" 21 Citing this resolution is Beijing's modus operandi for shutting down conversation about Taiwan's participation in UN-related organizations and activities. Beijing also works to install Chinese nationals in leadership positions at UN-affiliated and other major international organizations, and they can use their posts to block Taiwan's participation. Since 2015, Liu Fang has been the Secretary General of ICAO. Ren Minghui serves as Assistant Director-General for Communicable Diseases at the WHO. 22 Meng Hongwei was the President of Interpol, until he was arrested on corruption charges during a trip to the PRC. meeting (March 2019); and the World Meteorological Organization's 18 th World Meteorological Conference (June 2019). There are also other instances where Taiwan or Taiwanese individuals pulled out of an event due to a name change or other pressure from SHATTUCK Countries with which Taiwan has strong informal relations also have pushed for Taiwan's participation in international organizations.The United States consistently backs Taiwan's participation, and Congress has directed the Department of State to issue reports on progress in achieving that goal. In September 2019, 41 members of Congress sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo regarding Taiwan's exclusion from ICAO. Such letters have become common as Beijing keeps Taiwan out of these meetings. Similar action has been taken by members of the European Union Parliament, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, etc. In April 2019, the foreign ministers of the Group of 7 (G7) issued a communique urging Taiwan's participation in ICAO. In 2019, former NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen wrote an op-ed calling for Taiwan's participation in the ICAO's 40 th general assembly. 23 Similar support has come with the recent outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus.
