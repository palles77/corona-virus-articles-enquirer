The virus replicates in vitro in several porcine cell culture types (Bohl, 1981 ) . However, viral isolation in cell cultures from field outbreaks is not always successful (Dulac et al., 1975 ) . In contrast to virulent infection, peroral vaccination of sows, using attenuated virus, resulted in poor immunity ( Saif and Bohl, 1979; Bohl, 1981) . In the latter cases, it was not clear whether or not virus attached to target cells. In this paper, we report the results of experiments on TGEV attachment in vitro using four virus strains and two cell culture types.

The results shown in Table I suggest that the attachment of TGEV is partially thermodependent. Differences in attachment rate between strains were also observed. The TGEV strain Purdue-ll5 attached to the cells much faster than the others. Although both the TGEV strains Purdue-115 and 188-SG were established as high passage strains (115 and 188 passages, respectively), the attachment rates of these strains were different (Fig. 1 ) . The attachment rates of D-52 and 188-SG were found to be similar, however. Differences betweeen these two strains have been described (Aynaud et al., 1985) , 188-SG having higher resistance to acidity and digestive enzymes and smaller plaques in ST cells. It is evident that these two characteristics are not related to attachment rate. No explanation is available for the difference in virus attachment rate between strains. Interference with infectious virus attachment by varying numbers of defective particles which are present in the different virus inocula is unlikely. Although the infectious virus titre of the 188-SG strain is lower (by 1 log, Aynaud et al., 1985) , the intensity of virus-antibody reaction in ELISA is similar for the three virus strains (unpublished data), suggesting a 10-fold greater number of defective particles for the 188-SG strain compared to the others. The incubation of ~ 50-100 P.F.U. with 3 X 106 cells in a well ( for plaque formation ) would have rendered such an interference insignificant.",

Also, the field TGEV strain Gep-II, which was unable to multiply in cell cultures even in the presence of DEAE-dextran, was able to attach to the cells, thereby inhibiting the subsequent attachment of labelled virus. A higher synthesis of viral RNA was observed for the three virus strains in ST cells than in RPD cells (Nguyen, 1986) .",

It is interesting to note that the difference in attachment site between virus strains which has been dem-onstrated for other viruses, e.g., reovirus (Weiner et al., 1980) , was not observed in the case of TGEV. Moreover, until now only one antigenic determinant of TGEV has been reported (Bohl, 1981 ) and the present study suggests that this also applies to the attachment determinant. Studies of foot and mouth disease virus showed that attachment and antigenicity determinants are different (Meloen et al., 1983 ) . It is likely that TGEV possesses the same characteristic as neutralizing polyclonal antibodies from infected swine were unable to inhibit virus attachment .",

In agreement with Sturman and Holmes (1983) , who demonstrated that the coronavirus receptors/cell ratio was low ( ~ 700), our results suggest that the ratio of TGEV attachment sites per cell could not be high, in contrast to many other viruses, for which the host cell possesses as many as 5 \u00d7 105 attachment sites (Armstrong et al., 1984) .",

Our results on TGEV have identified another coronavirus member with this characteristic. The effects of DEAE-dextran (polycation, enhancer), dextran sulfate (polyanion, inhibitory) and dextran ( amorphous, no effect) are compatible with the explanation for the mechanism of action by electric charges of these molecules, but if the activity of polycations and polyanions relies only on their electric charges, contradictions can be seen in our results. Among polycations used, DEAE-dextran had an enhancing effect whereas others (PLL, PLO, protamine sulfate) were inhibitory. Such contradictions might be explained by the size of molecules used, since the effect of these molecules on cell uptake depends upon size as well as charge (Ryser, 1967) . Differences between strains in the level of enhancement or inhibition of virus infectivity by polyanions and polycations (Figs. 3, 4 and 5) might be explained by differences in their rate of attachment to the cells. The most important observation was the one-way effect of these molecules on virus attachment with all the strains studied. This again leads to the conclusion that there is no difference in the nature of attachment sites between TGEV strains.",
