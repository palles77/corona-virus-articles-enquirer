By June 2009, less than 2 months after the initial recognition of this virus, community level transmission of the virus had been documented in two continents which, according to previously adopted guidelines, led the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare phase 6, also termed the pandemic phase [1, 2] . At that time, great uncertainty still existed about the evolution of the pandemic. Analysis of initial information from Mexico indicated that morbidity and mortality were high in identified cases [3] . It was felt that time was of the essence, since any delay in the decision to manufacture pandemic vaccine would result in delayed availability. Based on experience in past pandemics, such a delay could potentially result in millions of deaths. Accordingly, on advice from international and national organizations, influenza vaccine production was moved from seasonal trivalent vaccine to monovalent pandemic vaccine [4] . In addition, it was recognized that there was a need to make sufficient supply of vaccine not only for developed countries but also for those in the developing world [5] .",

As the pandemic progressed, it became clear that morbidity and mortality were different from that expected based on previous patterns. Individuals over age 50, the ones who most frequently die from influenza had some degree of immunity to the virus and were relatively protected [7] . The rest of the population especially children and young adults experienced high morbidity. A small proportion was hospitalized; some of these individuals died but others survived following intensive care and 0264-410X/$ -see front matter \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.06.113 antiviral therapy. Pregnant women were at particular risk, estimated to be four times higher than in other adults [8] . The fortunate fact that the pandemic turned out to be milder than anticipated has led many individuals, especially in Europe, to question the initial decision to declare the pandemic and manufacture doses of vaccine for much of the world's population. Some have even gone so far as to question the integrity of those individuals and institutions making these decisions. For example, the quasi-governmental Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe conducted hearings and stated that \"the seriousness of the pandemic was vastly overrated by WHO at the outset\" [9] . By contrast, despite the large effort on the part of manufacturers, there was a scarcity of vaccine in the developing world which could have been catastrophic in the event of a more severe pandemic. Mexico, despite being the country where the outbreak was initially identified, had difficulty in obtaining vaccine for its population and, in January, 2010 was provided with 5 million bridging doses by Canada from that country's vaccine supplies [10] .",

The first event, in 2003, was the rapid spread globally of the coronavirus causing SARS [12] . Case fatality was often high and the economic and societal impact was major. SARS left behind a sensitization to the health impact of an emerging infection and the value of measures to control transmission. The SARS outbreaks were followed by the return in 2003 of the highly pathogenic avian A (H5N1) in humans, initially in South East Asia [13, 14] . The case fatality, sometimes as high as 80%, jolted the biomedical world. Since all influenza pandemics of the 20th century were of avian origin, the possibility that this virus could mutate or reassort with other influenza viruses and become easily transmissible among humans raised the specter of an influenza pandemic even more serious than 1918. These events, created a supposition that the next pandemic would be of avian origin and would be severe [15] .",

In terms of prophylaxis and control of infection and disease, three pillars were identified: vaccines, antivirals and nonpharmaceutical interventions, with vaccines ideally the first line of defense [16] . Studies of the H5N1 virus vaccine demonstrated that the addition of an adjuvant allowed use of less viral antigen with improved immunogenicity which would, in turn, allow more vaccine to be made available [17, 18] . In Europe regulatory filing was undertaken of \"mock-up\" dossiers for adjuvanted vaccines, which could apply to any pandemic virus [19] .

Overall, of great concern was the possibility that the world would not have vaccines or antivirals during an early period of devastating spread, resulting in social disruption. The new international health regulations (IHR) had provided guidance on handling international reporting and border closure during such a public health emergency [20] . Pandemic phases were designated to guide actions that countries should take in pandemic preparation. The first phases were designed on the assumption, based on the experience with A (H5N1) virus, that the pandemic influenza virus would gradually adapt itself to be able to transmit from human to human. Discussion of changes in the original phases had been underway for several years, in particular because of episodes of unsustained human to human transmission of H5N1, after initial transmission from poultry to humans. The new classification (Table 1) , finally released in early 2009, made phase 4 the critical one as this was the phase which recognized that there was sustained human to human transmission of \"an animal or human-animal influenza reassortant\" [1] . It was at this point when decisions to move to pandemic vaccine production would need to be made. Because of the anticipated delay of at least 6 months from the identification of the pandemic to the availability of vaccine, it was felt that the decision as to whether or not to proceed to large scale pandemic vaccine production needed to be made early before global spread had been documented [6] . Given the short incubation period for influenza and rapid doubling time, waiting until it was absolutely certain that there was a severe global pandemic would have removed prevention by vaccination as a real option to mitigate the burden.",

Although there was gradual recognition of the need to assess the severity to help countries determine what measures to adopt, it was felt that it might vary globally based on local conditions so that, by spring 2009, no specific agreed formula had been developed.

As a result of documented spread of the new virus, on 25 April 2009, an Emergency Committee of 15 members appointed by WHO as stipulated by the IHR, followed the existing procedure guidelines and advised the WHO director-general to declare that a \"public health emergency of international concern\" existed [22] . This involved various actions under the regulations and included intensified surveillance. WHO declared phase 4 on 27 April 2009, recognizing sustained human to human transmission of the A (H1N1) virus. By June 11, 2009 , it was obvious that transmission was widespread, and phase 6 was announced [2] . By this time, many manufacturers had begun large scale vaccine production and many countries had signed contracts to obtain these vaccines for their citizens. At this point, it was realized that most illnesses were not severe, and in the communiqu\u00e9 accompanying the announcement, it was described as \"moderate in severity\". Many, remembering past pandemics still were concerned about a potential change in illness characteristics.",

Approaches varied, the most aggressive being in the UK with use of antivirals drug initially for prophylaxis, especially to control school outbreaks, and then for treatment; antivirals were dispensed to those with appropriate symptoms following a call to a toll-free number [23] . The value of the antivirals, particularly in treatment, is still being evaluated.

However, the bulk of vaccines available globally can be broadly divided into adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted inactivated preparations; the viral antigen might be split or subunit. As discussed above, due to the poor immunogenicity of the A (H5N1) virus, had this pandemic been caused by that virus, all vaccines would have had to be adjuvanted. However, since the swine origin-A (H1N1) virus was distantly related to viruses that had circulated previously in humans, it was decided in the US and some other countries to take a calculated risk and rely on unadjuvanted vaccines. In the United States, this had an advantage from the regulatory standpoint as the vaccines would represent only a strain change, so that approval could be facilitated. However, the decision in the US to use unadjuvanted vaccines which required much higher antigen content inherently reduced the amount of vaccine antigen which would be available for non-manufacturing and developing countries [6] . Because of prior experience with adjuvanted influenza vaccines and because of the mock-up regulatory dossiers, adjuvanted H1N1 vaccines were produced for much of the world. With the adjuvant MF-59, 7.5 mcg of antigen was sufficient and with adjuvant AS-03, only 3.8 mcg per dose was needed to produce a satisfactory immunologic response; in contrast, 15 mcg per dose was required in the US vaccine. The use of adjuvanted vaccine was supported by WHO because this would result in a larger number of vaccine doses being available for the rest of the world [25] .",

In fact, there was considerable media attention at that time on the occasional deaths in H1N1 infected individuals.

In many cases, underlying conditions existed to explain the severe outcomes, but in a significant proportion, varying with age, there were none. Pregnancy was a major risk factor, as seen in past pandemics, but morbid obesity was a new predictor of severe outcome. The outbreaks moved through communities rapidly.

Hospitalization numbers were similar to those seen in a major seasonal outbreak, but the age distribution was different, with children and younger adults experiencing most of these events. In contrast, mortality was lower than seen in seasonal outbreaks, mainly because of the relative sparing of older individuals, who typically experience 90% of the deaths [27, 28] . However, because the deaths were mainly in younger individuals, the impact on life expectancy was particularly high; the estimate, for the US during the period May-December, 2009, was that there were between 334,000 and 1,973,000 years of life lost [29] .

One concern is that had the pandemic been more severe, the use of unadjuvanted vaccine by the US and consequence antigen \"overuse\" could have resulted in needless deaths due to lack of vaccine availability in the developing world. The lack of a preapproval dossier system for pandemic vaccines in the US perhaps fostered this situation. Another concern is the perception in some quarters that the response to the 2009 pandemic was an overreaction that cost governments money for vaccines and antivirals at a point when, because of the global recession, resources were particularly limited. It is important that there be recognition that there was a high level of uncertainty regarding the severity and potential time course of a pandemic at the point when decisions on vaccine purchases had to be made. If the pandemic had not been as mild as the 2009 pandemic, millions of lives could have been at risk if a \"wait and see\" approach had been taken. This seems to have been understood in countries where communication between the government, the press and the public were good. In these countries the focus of discussion has been on ways to increase speed and timing of vaccine availability, real issues which can be addressed.
