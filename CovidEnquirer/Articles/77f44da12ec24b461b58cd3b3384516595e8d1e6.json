The location of the substituents was facilitated by the analysis of the spectra of tridebromodragmacidin (12) .

Spectral data, especially 'H-and 13C-NMR data, were in good accordance with those reported for P-carboline and indole, thus supporting the proposed structure (35). Isoeudistomin U (36), from the same source, comprises indole and dihydro-a-carboline moieties. This structure was proposed on the basis of HMBC and NOE measurements (e.g., an NOE response of H-3 to irradiation at H-2') and by comparison of I3C-NMR chemical shifts : C-9a at 6 158.6 and at 6 159.2 pprn for 36 and 32, respectively. It is the personal opinion of the authors, however, that the structure of isoeudistomin U should be reconsidered based upon the following arguments: from a chemical standpoint, a dihydro a-carboline substituted as in 36 should not be stable and would readily be oxidized to the fully aromatic compound. The information extracted from the HMBC experiment may be explained by changing chemical shift assignments; for example, the carbon signal at 6 20.3 ppm could be reassigned to the C-6 of a 3,4-dihydro P-carboline unit. The most puzzling data concern the above-mentioned NOE between H-2' and H-3; the published value (12%) is much too high for a molecule of this size at 400 MHz! An artifactual observation must not be excluded.",

Its 'H-and 13C-NMR spectra displayed signals for 18 protons and 16 carbons as a consequence of the symmetry of the molecule. These spectra showed the presence of a dimethylallyl group, as in roquefortine (56). The fused indoline moiety with amide functions (IR,v 1660 cm-'; 13C-NMR, 6 166.1 ppm) was hydrolytically degraded (6N HCl, llO\u00b0C, 4h) to L-tryptophan. Consequently, carbons C-15a and C-7a with their exchangeable protons (Na2C03,CH30D) were given the S absolute configuration. Irradiation of the methyl groups of the isoprenyl moiety induced NOES at the protons on the C-5a and C-13a positions, thus proving the B/C and E/F cis ring junctions. A fruns relative position between the proton at C-15a (C-7a) and that of C-5a (C-13a) was evidenced by the high-field absorption of the 15a proton (6 3.8 ppm), which experiences the anisotropic effect of an aromatic ring, A(G). Determination of the absolute configuration of the stereocenters was confirmed by comparison of the physical data (NMR, a, CD) of the natural product (and derivatives) with those of synthetic analogues of known stereochemistry (34). A diketopiperazine metabolite isolated at the same time from Penicillium nigricans was given the name nigrifortine (35). The published structure is identical to that of amauromine, and the spectroscopic data for the two compounds are similar. Therefore, the compounds are most probably one and the same product. ",

Converting 61 into amauromine (55) (38) while preserving the inverted prenyl group was realized by the combined use of TiC14 and LiAlH4.",

Treatment of 154 with ammonium acetate yielded arcyriarubin-A. Maleic anhydrides are also converted into maleimides under mild conditions, using a mixture of methanol and hexamethyldisilazane (103) .

The absolute configuration (S for C-3 and C-lla of the disulfide bridge) was determined by X-ray diffraction analysis, including sulfur anomalous diffusion, and was found to be opposite the configurations observed in gliotoxin (186) and sporidesmin (187); this was also proved by circular dichroism Chetracin-A (193) is a metabolite from Chaetomium abuense Lodha and C. retardatum Carter & Khan exhibiting strong cytotoxic activity (140). Its absolute configuration and the conformation of the tetrasulfide bridge were established by X-ray crystallography. Despite the symmetrical nature of the molecule, it formed a triacetate (194) instead of a tetraacetate on treatment with AczO and pyridine, which can be explained by steric hindrance of the C-ll'a-hydroxyl group and by hydrogen bonding between ll'a-OH and the carbonyl group located at the C-1' carbon. This effect might also be responsible for the incomplete acetylations of melinacidin IV (190) and the verticillins under identical conditions. Ditryptophenaline (195) is a metabolite from Aspergillus flauus (strains MIT-M25, -26, and -27) and did not exhibit any significant biological activities (141). Its symmetrical structure was established from spectroscopic data and X-ray diffraction studies. Formally, 195 is derived from the coupling of tryptophan, phenylalanine, and a methyl unit, followed by oxidative dimerization. Its absolute configuration was not determined. 1% were isolated from the culture of Chaetomium gfobosum Kinze ex.

The 'H-NMR data for 198 (149) displayed signals for two methylene groups as triplets (6 3.60 and 3.92 ppm), suggesting the presence of a 1,2disubstituted ethane function as a spacer. The location of methoxyl groups at C-4 (6 149.9 pprn) and C-8 (6 146.0 ppm) was deduced from a comparison of the 'Hand 13C-NMR data for 198 with those of P-carbolines (199 and 200).

The 'H-NMR spectrum showed a doublet of doublets at 6 5.55 ppm, assigned to a methine, a supplementary methoxyl group (6 3.51 ppm), and signals for two contiguous methylenes. The near superimposition of the aromatic parts of the I3C-NMR spectra of 201 and 198 led to the conclusion that the structural differences between the compounds belonged to the spacer chain.

The combination of negative FABMS experiments and of 'H-and 13C-NMR techniques demonstrated that fascaplysin A (38) and homofascaplysin A (39) had the same dehydroluffariellolide diacid anion with a one-to-one anion-to-cation ratio. Spectral analysis of the alkaloid part of 39 allowed identification of acetonyl substitution (CH2-CO-CH3 carbons at 6 51.0, 204.6, and 30.5 ppm, respectively) at C-13 (6 78.2 ppm). Despite the fact that 39 was found to be optically active and that acetone was not used in the isolation process, the authors did not completely exclude the possibility of 39 being an isolation artifact. The chemical shifts of H-6 and, H-7 in homofascaplysin B (41) and homofascaplysin C (42) were diagnostic of the of these molecules (e.g.,6 9.01 (H-6) and 8.69 (H-7) ppm in 37 vs. 8.3 (H-6) and 7.67 (H-7) ppm in 42). Formyl (42) and a-ketoester (41) functions on the C-13 position were deduced from spectroscopic data, including comparison of NMR data with those for 37. A plausible biogenetic pathway to fascaplysin (37) involves condensation of tryptophan with tryptamine. The total synthesis of 37 was based upon an acid-catalyzed cyclization followed by oxidation of an intermediate (43) (24). A starting diindole derivative (44) was readily prepared from indole by two routes (Scheme 3). Exposure of 44 to trifluoroacetic acid afforded a mixture (1O:l) of cyclized products [(45) and (a)] which was dehydrogenated to the fully aromatic pentacycle (43). As anticipated, peracetic-acid-mediated oxidation of 43 provided fascaplysin (37) in a 65% overall yield. Fascaplysin (37) and homofascaplysin A (39) showed reverse transcriptase inhibition activity at the pg/ml level. E.

Oneand two-dimensional NMR experiments (NOE, COLOC) (69) and singlecrystal X-ray analysis of 75 (70) demonstrated that K-252a (79, K-252b (76), and staurosporine had a double-branched N-furanose moiety, whereas K-252d (78) had an a-L-rhamnose unit and a free indole NH position.

The location of the methoxy substituents was determined by treatment of 208 with acetic anhydride which afforded 5acetoxycanthin-6-one (211) and 4,8-dimethoxy-l-vinyl-~-carboline (213) (155) (Scheme 23) .The close resemblance of spectroscopic data for 208 and 210 suggested similar structures (156). The main difference between the NMR spectra of the aromatic regions of 210 and those of 208 concerned the C-4 position of the canthin-5,6-dione moiety in 210, in which the hydrogen was replaced by another methoxyl group (6 3.89 ppm). The cleavage reaction with acetic anhydride also proved the assignment. The 'H-NMR spectrum of picrasidine-N (209) showed that the methoxyl group at 6 64.7 ppm was located on the indole nitrogen. The compound was degraded into 4,9dimethoxy-1-vinyl-P-carboline (213), thus supporting structure 209 (157). ",
