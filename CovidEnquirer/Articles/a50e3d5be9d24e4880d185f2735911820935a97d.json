The herds were cross-classified by 49 veterinary clinics and 9 ecological regions and in a multiple membership relation to the veterinary clinics, resulting in a 3level cross-classified and multiple membership data structure. The model was formulated in a mixed-effects Poisson model framework with normally distributed random effects, and was fitted to the data by Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation. Important fixed effects included whether the calf was a twin, calf gender, assistance at calving, cow age, average temperature the first week after calving, the percentage of the herd that had already calved, whether calf shelters were provided, whether cow-calf pairs were moved to a nursery area, and whether any animals were purchased into the herd at or near the time of calving. The analysis demonstrated a greater variation among herds than among both ecological regions and veterinary clinics. Further, a simulation study for a setting similar to the real data gave evidence that the used approach provides valid estimates.",

            "text": "Researchers in veterinary epidemiology are often interested in modelling hierarchical data with a time-to-event response variable. Hierarchical time-to-event models, also referred to as hierarchical survival or frailty models, can be used with nested data structures (e.g. animals nested within herds and herds located in different ecological regions) commonly found in veterinary science. One potential limitation of nested frailty models typically used for hierarchical survival data, however, is that they are designed to be used with perfectly hierarchical survival data, but in reality not all data structures found in the veterinary sciences are perfectly hierarchical. If in the previous example (some) herds are serviced by multiple veterinary clinics, an imperfect hierarchical data structure is present where the lower level units (herds) are members of multiple higher level units (clinics) simultaneously. This structure is called a multiple membership data structure (Browne et al., 2001) . In addition, different classifications may not be hierarchically nested in each other; in our example, herds serviced by a given clinic could be located in different ecological regions. This would mean that clinics are not hierarchically nested within regions, and the two factors should instead be viewed as (partially) cross-classified. In summary, the structure described corresponds to a 3-level cross-classified and multiple membership data structure (Browne et al., 2001) .",

A few studies in veterinary epidemiology have used the CMM model with different response variables. Browne et al.

For instance, Meyers and Beretvas (2006) and Luo and Kwok (2009) showed that ignoring one of the cross-classified factors in linear models results in biased estimation in the variance components and in the standard error of the regression coefficients. Results from Goldstein et al. (2007) demonstrated that using traditional models that ignore the multiple membership in the analysis when it is present underestimate the variance at the multiple membership level. In addition, models that take into account the multiple membership structure give a better fit than models that ignore such structures. Recently, a simulation study conducted by Chung and Beretvas (2012) showed that ignoring multiple membership structure causes bias in the estimates of the regression coefficients and the variance component at the multiple membership level.",

Calves with invalid values or missing information were excluded from the analysis. This eliminated about 5% of observations including 74 cases of mortality. This strategy resulted in 23,409 calves, with 897 of these calves experiencing the event of interest. The event was defined as a case of calf mortality that happened at least 1 h after birth; the event time was defined as the time from calving to death (recorded in days), and for those calves that died on the same day of birth the event time was set at 0.5. Calves that were sold during the follow-up period or survived until the end of the follow-up period were considered right censored observations. Because the observation period ended at the same time for all calves (June 30th), but all calves were born at different times during the calving season, we recognized the need for an analysis technique that accounted for different follow up times across the study population.",

(2005) , the likelihood function of Cox models with normal random effects (i.e., lognormal frailties) is proportional to the likelihood function of such random effects Poisson models. In detail, Cox models with normal random effects can be estimated as generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) with a binary Poisson count response and a specific offset. The approach requires each observation in the data to be split into a multiple records based on the complete set of failure times in the dataset, and the offset equals the logarithm of the length of each time interval. The baseline hazard is modelled as a smooth function of time, in our case a 4th order polynomial as suggested by Rabe-Hesketh and Skrondal (2012) .",

A liberal p-value of 0.20 was chosen to determine potential important explanatory variables. Using lowess smoothing graphs, functional forms of continuous variables were evaluated by plotting the variable in question against martingale residuals, and if necessary appropriate transformation was performed or a quadratic term was added to the model. The second step of the model building consisted in a stepwise backward selection for the standard Cox model with p < 0.10 as inclusion criterion since a hierarchical Cox model was impractical and very time consuming. All two-way interactions between predictors retained in the model were evaluated and tested for statistical significance; interactions that turned out significant and biologically meaningful were kept in the model. During the selection process, the non-significant predictors were rechecked for confounding and a change of 20% or more in the parameter estimate was used as a criterion for identifying confounders. The proportional hazards assumption was evaluated for model predictors individually and globally by a statistical test based on the scaled Schoenfeld residuals (Dohoo et al., 2009) . To account for non-proportional hazards for some predictors, the dataset was split at events, and an interaction term between the predictor in question and the logarithm of time was added to the model. The assumption of independent censoring was checked by sensitivity analysis comparing the change of positive and negative correlation scenarios between censoring and new mortality events.

The age distribution of calf deaths was also similar to what was expected based on other reports.

In this study, there was a substantial increase in the mortality rate for calves born after the half-way point in each herd. Clement et al.

This study like ours found an increased calf mortality rate for calves born under cold conditions. Because the other study was limited to a single research herd, they also had access to local precipitation data which were not consistently available in the present analysis. Azzam et al.

In our study, herd owners that moved calves out of the calving area and to a nursery pasture within 48 h had lower calf losses. This practice removes cow-calf pairs from the contaminated environment and prevents crowding in the calving area by dispersing newborn calves soon after birth (Radostits and Acres, 1980) . The use of calf shelters which are not accessible to cows and heifers (Radostits and Acres, 1980; Olson, 1986) was also associated with decreased calf mortality. Schumann et al. (1990) reported that increasing the nursery shelter area helped to protect against calf diarrhoea, but did not differentiate between shelters accessible to both cows and calves and shelters accessible to just calves.",

The simulation study therefore supported our findings of relatively small variance components for veterinary clinics and regions in the real data. In addition, simulation study II showed that the estimation of between-clinic variance was improved in a more pronounced multiple membership structure and with larger variance components. Both simulation studies demonstrated difficulties with estimation of the between-ecoregion variance and its standard error, and this can probably attributed to the small number of ecologic regions.",
