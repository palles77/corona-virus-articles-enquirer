This process begins with literature review and needs assessment, enabling the development of instructional objectives specifying what is to be achieved in the training, which, in turn, provides input for designing, delivering and evaluating the effectiveness of the training programme. [6] [7] [8] As Fig. 1 shows, the approach is a closed-loop system. Information resulting from evaluation of training effectiveness is used to determine whether or not the training met its previously defined aims and objectives. This information provides feedback to modify future training system features by reassessing training needs, revising course objectives or altering the delivery methods. The emergency training approach is evolving continually, with results from previous programmes being used to continuously improve future training programmes. 7 Thus, the purpose of this research was to describe the training process, evaluate the effectiveness of the training, and develop a participatory emergency training approach for rural public health personnel.",

Previous research showed that the various training methods were recommended by educators because different participants learned by different training methods, and 'methods of active training' could usually give better results in the training process. [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] The results of this research suggested that the emergency preparedness training not only resulted in encouraging effectiveness, but also created a scientific and effective training approach. The training process, content, trainers, logistics and services were recognized by participants and trainers. For example, more than 90% of participants thought that the training methods were excellent or very good, especially the case studies and role-playing exercises. All results demonstrated that the emergency preparedness training programme satisfactorily met the anticipated aims and objectives, and rural public health personnel could improve their knowledge and performance while changing their attitudes and behavioural intentions. This is similar to results found by Qureshi et al. 12 and Potter et al. 26 The limitations of this study should be noted. First, the analysis was limited to the personnel that were primarily engaged in disease monitoring and controlling, and laboratory and environmental health work in 84 CDCs. Second, approximately 35 trainees had participated in a follow-up survey of the control and response to avian influenza in 2007, and the follow-up results could be influenced because this most likely increased their emergency preparedness skills. Third, evaluations were based on changes over time without the use of a horizontal comparison group. Finally, the composite variable/evaluation index used may overestimate the effectiveness of training to some extent, because changes in these composite variable/evaluation indexes were affected by many factors, including emergency preparedness training. Thus, it was not possible to fully determine which changes were due to the emergency preparedness training programme and which were due to other factors. However, the fact that demographic and capability factors remained constant throughout the study provided support that the changes presented above were due to the training programme. . Data are shown as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. All comparisons were performed by one-way analysis of variance.
