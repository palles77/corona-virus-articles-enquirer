All these viruses are categorised within the same genus of the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae within the family Coronaviridae.

This weeklong holiday accounts for the largest mass movement of people worldwide each year. Consequently, over time more patients are expected to emerge across China and perhaps the world. We found that the characteristics of patients outside of Wuhan differed from those initially reported in patients in Wuhan. 10 We describe the clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of patients in Zhejiang province infected with SARS-Cov-2 to provide an insight into the prevention and treatment of covid-19 across China and elsewhere.",

Since the outbreak of covid-19, strict precautionary measures have been implemented in Zhejiang province, including the creation of fever clinics that exclusively receive patients with suspected SARS-Cov-2 infection, defined as presenting with a fever or any respiratory symptoms, including dry cough, and especially in those with a history of travel to Wuhan or exposure to infected people within two weeks before the onset of illness since January 2020. Case definitions of confirmed human infection with SARS-Cov-2 are in accordance with the interim guidance from the World Health Organization. 1 Only patients with a laboratory confirmed infection were enrolled in this study. We collected data on 62 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection in seven designated tertiary hospitals in Zhejiang province (see supplementary file for further details). Information was collected on dates of illness onset, visits to clinical facilities, and hospital admissions. Epidemiological data were collected through brief interviews with each patient. Several investigators interviewed each patient to collect exposure histories during the two weeks before illness onset, including the dates and times of close contact (gathering, living, or working together) with individuals from Wuhan with confirmed or suspected SARS-Cov-2 infection. The incubation period was defined as the time from exposure to the onset of illness, which was estimated among patients who could provide the exact date of close contact with individuals from Wuhan with confirmed or suspected SARS-Cov-2 infection. We also investigated the possibility of familial clusters-that is, index patients who travelled to Wuhan and then infected others in their families.",

Further containment proposals should be implemented by the Chinese government, such as preventing people from Wuhan having contact with those elsewhere, banning gatherings of more than 100 people, conducting daily public-wide educational campaigns on precautionary measures against exposure to SARS-Cov-2, encouraging people to cancel traditional family gatherings such as during the Chinese lunar new year, and extending the Chinese lunar new year holiday to prevent large scale spread.",

Thirdly, at the time of study submission, most patients had not been discharged, so we are unable to estimate either the case fatality rate or the predictors of fatality.
