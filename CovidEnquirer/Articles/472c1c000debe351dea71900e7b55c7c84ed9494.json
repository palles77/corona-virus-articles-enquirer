Methods: cross-sectional study, from January 2011 to December 2012. The secretions of nasopharyngeal aspirates were analyzed in children younger than 21 years with acute respiratory infections. Patients were treated at the Grupo em Defesa da Crian\u00e7a Com C\u00e2ncer (Grendacc) and University Hospital (HU), Jundia\u00ed, SP. The rapid test was used for detection of influenza virus (Kit Biotrin, Inc. Ireland), and real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction (FTD, Respiratory pathogens, multiplex Fast Trade Kit, Malta) for detection of influenza virus (H1N1, B), rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human parechovirus, bocavirus, metapneumovirus, and human coronavirus. The prevalence of viral infection was estimated and association tests were used ( 2 or Fisher's exact test). Results: 104 samples of nasopharyngeal aspirate and blood were analyzed. The median age was 12 \u00b1 5.2 years, 51% males, 68% whites, 32% had repeated ARIs, 32% prior antibiotic use, 19.8% cough, and 8% contact with ARIs. A total of 94.3% were in good general status. Acute lymphocytic leukemia (42.3%) was the most prevalent neoplasia. Respiratory viruses were detected in 50 samples: rhinoviruses (23.1%), respiratory syncytial virus AB (8.7%), and coronavirus (6.8%). Codetection occurred in 19% of cases with 2 viruses and in 3% of those with 3 viruses, and was more \u0b1d Please cite this article as: Benites EC, Cabrini DP, Silva AC, Silva JC, Catalan DT, Berezin EN, et al.

            "text": "In both developed and developing countries, respiratory diseases contribute to the high proportion of morbidity and mortality in childhood. It is estimated that 25% to 33% of deaths observed in children younger than five years are caused by acute respiratory infections (ARIs) and their complications. 1 In Brazil, the expectation of new cases of childhood cancer is 9,300 cases per year in children younger than 15 years. Among these, the most common are acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and central nervous system (CNS) tumor, followed by Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). 2 The very presence of the disease may be a factor of immunosuppression, especially in ALL and lymphomas. Conversely, treatment with chemotherapy interferes with patients' immune response capacity; 3 infection is the most common complication associated with cancer and its treatment, representing the main cause of death rather than the cancer itself. 2 Acute viral respiratory infections are the most common causes of febrile episodes in children younger than five years, even in children treated with antineoplastic drugs. 4, 5 Many studies, concepts, and protocols are well established for the management of fever episodes in children with cancer. However, there are still doubts regarding the true incidence and the role of viral agents in respiratory infections in these patients. 6---10 Few studies have been published on this subject in the past; little attention has been given in the literature to new viruses such as human coronavirus (hCoV) and metapneumovirus (hMPV A/B) in immunocompromised pediatric patients. 10, 11 This study aimed to determine the frequency of infection caused by respiratory viruses in patients younger than 21 years with cancer and acute respiratory infection, and to identify whether there is a subgroup that has severe ARI.",
