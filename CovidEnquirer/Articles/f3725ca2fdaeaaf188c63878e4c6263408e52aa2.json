The 5-year survival rate is only approximately 50% in most centers, and 2 major limiting factors for the outcome of lung transplantation are the frequent occurrence of infectious complications and rejection of the transplanted organ [1] . Standard immunosuppression, to prevent graft rejection, consists of a combination of 3 immunosuppressive drugs that subvert B and T cells [2] [3] [4] . Currently, there is a lack of an easy-to-use marker that accurately predicts the net effect of the combined immunosuppression. Such a biomarker would be an important tool in the management of patients with compromised immune function to identify overor underimmunosuppression and evaluate the risk of infectious complications and acute rejections.",

Post-transplantation immunosuppression included prednisone 0.3 mg/kg/d and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 2 g/d. The patients then received either oral Cyclosporine (CSA; 1-2 mg/kg), adjusted to maintain a serum level of 300-350 ng/mL, or Tacrolimus (TAC; 0.075 mg/kg) given orally divided in 2 doses daily, adjusted to maintain a serum level of 14-16 ng/mL. The choice between CSA and TAC was made based on clinical presentation. Patients previously treated with TAC and patients with cystic fibrosis were given TAC. There was also a preference for TAC if the recipient was younger. The dosage of immunosuppression was gradually lowered during FU. Further changes in immunosuppressive therapy were based on clinical presentation. Four patients, who either underwent retransplantation or had previous immunosuppressive treatment due to autoimmune conditions, were given nonstandard immunosuppression therapy based on previous exposure to immunosuppressive drugs.",

CMV-seronegative recipients were considered to have viremia if CMV-DNA was detected, whereas recipients seropositive for CMV prior to transplantation where considered to have CMV viremia only if the level was above 3.0 log10 (1000) copies/mL. To distinguish milder infections from more severe infectious events, a subgroup of events requiring initial intravenous antimicrobial (antibacterial, antiviral, or antifungal) therapy were defined as severe. Acute rejection was defined as either a lung biopsy showing rejection of ISHLT grade 1A or higher [26] or, in the absence of a biopsy, physical (increased need for oxygen) and radiological findings (progressive infiltrate without signs of infection) consistent with acute rejection followed by a prompt response to high-dose (1 g/d for 3 consecutive days) corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolone).",

At 3 months post-LTx, the mean TTV-DNA level peaked and then gradually declined, reflecting the gradual moderation of immunosuppressive therapy. Interestingly, the TTV-DNA level was lower in patients who received Cyclosporine treatment, possibly mirroring a different immune modulatory mechanism for Cyclosporine compared with Tacrolimus. G\u00f6rzer et al. [16] previously suggested that this might be due to Cyclosporine being less efficient as an immunosuppressant. However, we found no association between type of immunosuppressive regimen and acute rejection or other events that would indicate a difference in net immunosuppressive effect. Recently, TTV-DNA has been associated with chronic lung allograft dysfunction after lung transplantation [29] , but in our study this was not included as an outcome.",

There is some evidence that TTV replication is dependent on the type of induction therapy that appears to reflect changes in lymphocyte concentration; however, the duration is brief, after which the levels of TTV recover [30] . In the present study, TTV viral load was determined in serum samples, whereas plasma was used in previous studies [16, 31] .

Here it was shown that the real-time PCR method was adequate as compared with the ddPCR method, which is considered a more reliable method for accurate quantification [32] . Nonetheless, real-time PCR is prone to interlaboratory differences, and utilization of ddPCR for quantification has been suggested to circumvent this problem, facilitating direct comparison of results between centers [33, 34] . Digital droplet PCR depends on partitioning of each master mix followed by end point PCR. Quantitation is determined using Poisson statistics to generate a result that is not dependent on a relation to a standard curve and should therefore exhibit lower variability between laboratories. However, the ddPCR assays still depend on amplification of a specific target sequence, and depending on the design of the primer and probe, the targeted sequence can vary. Recent work has shown that viral DNA in plasma samples is to a large extent free and not associated with viral particles and is also subjected to various degrees of degradation, influencing the results, depending on the amplicon length determined by the PCR-assay design [35] . Thus, standardization of the entire assay including primer and probe design, use of international standards, and assessment of the commutability of reference material is needed before a direct comparison of interlaboratory results can be made with absolute confidence, even with the use of ddPCR [36, 37] .",

TTV-DNA levels in serum starting pre-lung transplantation (LTx) were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Individual TTV levels are indicated by dots. EBV-DNA levels in whole blood post-LTx were determined by real-time PCR, and individual EBV levels are indicated by dots. Patients receiving either Tacrolimus treatment (n = 19) or Cyclosporine treatment (n = 79) are indicated by red and blue dots, respectively. The mean levels of TTV and EBV in Tacrolimus-treated patients are indicated by red lines in their respective graphs. The mean levels of TTV and EBV in Cyclosporine-treated patients are indicated by blue lines in their respective graphs. Infectious events and acute rejections are indicated by black dots. Statistical calculations were done using Mann-Whitney U (P values are indicated by * <.05, ** <.01, and *** <.001). ++ The levels of EBV-DNA pre-LTx were determined in serum samples.

TTV and EBV levels were added as time-varying covariates to provide the most accurate statistical model possible. No significant associations were found in a univariable analysis (",
