A novel member of the Coronaviridae family has been identified as the causative agent of this pulmonary disease. 1 Thus far, treatment of SARS cases has been largely empirical and has usually included an antiviral agent such as ribavirin or a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and steroids. It is however unclear whether any of these treatments were able to alter the ultimate outcome of the disease. 2, 3 During the SARS epidemic, Chen and colleagues included inhalation of NO gas in the treatment of a number of SARS patients. Medicinal NO gas, a gaseous blend of nitric oxide (0.8%) and nitrogen (99.2%), was given for three days or longer, initially at 30 ppm and then at 20 and 10 ppm on the second and third day (unpublished data). Their findings suggest not only an immediate improvement of oxygenation but also a lasting effect on the disease itself after termination of inhalation of NO.",

Two NO donor compounds, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP, Sigma, Belgium) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP, Sigma, Belgium), were added to confluent African Green monkey (Vero E6) cells.

Three days after infection, the number of viable cells was quantified by a tetrazolium-based colorimetric method, in which the reduction of the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxy-phenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) dye (CellTiter 96 AQ ueous One Solution kit, Promega, The Netherlands) by cellular dehydrogenases to an insoluble coloured formazan was measured in a spectrophotometer (Multiskan EX, Thermo Labsystems, Belgium) at 492 nm. 8, 9 The selectivity index was determined as the ratio of the concentration of the compound that reduced cell viability to 50% (CC 50 or 50% cytotoxic concentration) to the concentration of the compound needed to inhibit the viral cytopathic effect to 50% of the control value (IC 50 or 50% inhibitory concentration).",

The NO concentration released by 222 M SNAP is between 30-55 M NO. No protective effect below the CC 50 could be demonstrated for SNP. The difference in activity between these two NO donor compounds might be explained by a different mechanism of releasing NO. SNAP is a direct donor of NO and generates NO in aqueous solutions through hydrolysis, while SNP only releases NO after reaction with a reducing agent. [10] [11] [12] No protective effect could be obtained with N-acetylpenicillamine (NAP), which is the non-nitrosylated form of SNAP and does not release NO in solution ( Figure 1 ). These results illustrate that the protective effect of SNAP is a consequence of NO release and not of a potential solitary antiviral effect of the N-acetyl-penicillamine moiety.",
