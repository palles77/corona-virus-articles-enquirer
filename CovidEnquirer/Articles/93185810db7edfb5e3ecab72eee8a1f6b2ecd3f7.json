By following [5, 8, 16, 17] , in [2] [3] [4] various preference orderings have been fully classified according to their agreement with the most well-known numerical models; both for \"complete\" (i.e. defined on well structured and closed supports) and \"partial\" assessments (i.e. defined only among some of the quantities involved).

Consequently, we immediately obtain an executable ASP-specification able to discriminate between the different uncertainty orderings.

In this frame of mind, an interesting problem is that of finding an extension of a preference relation so as to take into account any further event extraneous to the initial assessment. This should be achieved in a way that the initial ordering and its extension satisfy the same axioms. Hence, first, the initial (partial) preference relation is classified by identifying its characterizing rules Then, by exploiting the same approach the extension sought for is determined.",

We will not enter into the details of the motivations for such classification, the reader is referred to [2] [3] [4] . The domain of discernment will be represented by a finite set of events \u00a3 = {Ei,... ^E^}, Among them, (p and Q. will denote the impossible and the sure event, respectively. The events in S are seen as the relevant propositions on which the subject of the analysis can, or wants, to express his/her opinion. Hence, usually S does not represent a full model, i.e. it does not comprehend all elementary situations and all of their combinations. For this reason, a crucial component of partial assessments is the knowledge of the logical relationships holding among the events ^^^'s. Usual relationships are those of incompatibility, implication, combination and equivalence. Anyhow, any logical constraint can be potentially expressed. Such constraints are usually represented as a set C of clauses among the Ei^s and such clauses are intended to be always verified. Taking into account C, the family 8 spans a minimal Boolean algebra As containing S itself. Note that As is only implicitly defined via S and C and it is not a part of the assessment. Anyway, As will be referenced as a supporting structure. More formally, we have: Definition 1. Let \u00a3^ be a set of events and C a collection of constraints on S. As is the minimal algebra {A, V, A,\"\", (/), Q) satisfying C and such that S <^ A.",

We start by defining in ASP the predicates prec(\u2022,\u2022), precneq(\u2022,\u2022), and equiv(-,-), to render the relators =: <(, -<, and ~, resp. Moreover, the fact of \"being an event\" (i.e. a member oiS) is stated through the monadic predicate event(-).^ Auxiliary predicates/functions are used to render set-theoretical construes, such as fl, U, and C, whose implementations rely on user-defined C-libraries. The characterization of potential legal answer sets is done by asserting properties of prec(-,-), precneq(-,-), and equiv(-,-), as follows: Having in mind (B') of Sec. 1, this clause is of immediate reading: the fact failsBl is true (i.e. belongs to the answer set) whenever there exist events falsifying (B'). All other axioms have been treated similarly. When smodels is fed with such program and a description of an input preference relation (i.e., a collection of facts of the forms prec(-,-), precneq(\u2022,\u2022), and equiv(-,-)), different outcomes may be obtained: a) If no answer set is produced, then the input weak preference structure violates some basic requirement, such as axioms (A1')-(A3'). b) Otherwise, if an answer set is generated, there exists a numerical (partial) model representing the input weak preference structure. Moreover, the presence in the answer set of a fact of the form faiIsC (say failsLl, for example), witnesses that the corresponding axiom ((L') in the case) is violated by the given preference order. Consequently, the given order (as well as its extensions) is not compatible with the uncertainty framework ruled by C (in the case of failsLl, the given order cannot be represented by a partial Lower probability). prec(B,A) . precneq(C,D). precneq(E,C). precneq(E,D). precneq(F,A). equiv(AuE,AuC). Due to events' meaning, such order seems reasonable. If it is given as input to smodels, the answer set found includes the facts failsBl and failsWC. This means that the given preference relation agrees with the basic axioms, however it cannot be managed by using neither a Probability nor a Belief function. Nevertheless, one can use comparative Lower probabilities or comparative Plausibilities. D",

Unfortunately, not all the available ASP-solvers offer the direct computation of Cn as a built-in feature (DLV, for instance does, while smodels does not, cf. [18] ). In general, a simple inspection of the answer sets generated by smodels allows one to detect the minimal extension of the preference relation which is mandatory for each total order. We designed a simple post-processor which filters smodels' output and produces the imposed extension of =: <(. Example 2. Consider the weak preference structure of Example 1 and the new event S = The real state of having SARS subject to these restrictions: ScF and FflEcS. Since in Example 1 we discovered that the initial preference relation satisfies axiom (PL'), we want to impose such axiom and compute the extension of the initial order. Once filtered smodels' output, we obtained the following result:'^ precneq(S,AuC) precneq(S,AuE) precneq(S,D) precneq(S,A) precneq(S,17) prec(0,S) prec(S,F) ... showing that, apart from obvious relations induced by monotonicity, no significative constraint involving S can be inferred. Since S and E can be freely compared, this result suggests that either further investigation about relevance of the clinical test or a revision of the initial preference relation, should be performed. D The availability of automated tools able to extend preference orders, whenever new knowledge (new events) is acquired, directly suggests applications in expert systems and decision-support tools. In automated diagnosis, planning, or problem solving, to mention some examples, one could easily imagine scenarios where knowledge is not entirely available from the beginning. We could outline how a rudimental inference process could develop, by identifying the basic steps an automated agent should perform: 0) Acquisition of an initial collection of observations (events) about the object of the analysis, together with a (qualitative) partial preference assessment; 1) Detection of which is the most adequate (i.e., the most discriminant) uncertainty framework, through a \"preference classification phase\" (cf. Sec. 3); 2) Whenever new knowledge becomes available, refine agent's description of the real world by performing order extension (which substantially corresponds to knowledge inference. Cf. Sec. 4). The results of step 2) could be then exploited to guide further investigations on the real world, in order to obtain new information. Then, step 2) will be repeated and the process will continue until further pieces of knowledge are obtainable or an enough accurate degree of believe is achieved. ^ We list here only the portion of the extension involving the new event S.",

The implementation of what could be thought as a kernel of an inference engine sprouted almost naturally. Certainly, our research is at an initial stage and the implementation we reported on is just a prototype. Next step in this research would consist in validating the proposed approach by means of a number of benchmarks aimed at testing our prototype on the ground of real applications. Results of this activity will help in consolidating the prototype. In this context, a further goal consists in completing our approach so as to handle comparative Probabilities too. Since no axiomatic characterization of comparative Probabilities is known (up to our knowledge), this aim should be achieved through integration with efficient linear optimization tools (such as the column generation techniques). More in general, we envisage the design of a full-blown automated system which integrates different (in someway complementary) techniques and methods for uncertainty management; comprehending mixed numerical/qualitative assessments and conditional frameworks.",
