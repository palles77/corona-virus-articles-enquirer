However, despite the introduction of DICOM radiation therapy (RT) objects since 1999, the RT community has not yet to take advantage of the power and infrastructure of imaging informatics. Law presents an ePR model of DICOM-based radiation therapy information system, where seven RT DICOM objects are included, as a first attempt at such a development to utilize these concepts.",
