Virions are enveloped and spherical (coronaviruses), or disc, kidney, or rod shaped (toroviruses). Each particle is surrounded by a fringe or \"corona\" representing the bulbous distal ends of embedded envelope glycoproteins. Prior to 2003 members of this family were believed to cause only mild respiratory illness in humans, other coronaviruses then known being largely of importance only to the livestock industry. But the emergence of severe acute respiratory virus (SARS-CoV) that year stimulated major research into these viruses, to the effect that many new coronaviruses have since been discovered, some with zoonotic potential of causing serious outbreaks of disease in humans. The more recent emergence of MERS-CoV is exemplary.",

The specificity of binding is important for the host spectrum of individual coronaviruses. Soon after the virus was isolated, the 5' receptor for SARS-CoV was identified as angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a cellular protein expressed on the surface of cells of the lungs, heart, kidney, and small intestine as well as other tissues. Other proteins, such as CD209L (L-SIGN), DC-SIGN, and LSECtin, can support the entry of SARS-CoV into cells, but cannot by themselves confer susceptibility to a cell lacking ACE2. Receptors of other coronaviruses have also been identified. For instance, the receptor for murine hepatitis virus (MHV) is a murine biliary glycoprotein belonging to the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family in the Ig superfamily (CEACAM1). Individual strains of MHV may exhibit different preferences for viral entry. For example, only the MHV-3 strain infects T and B cells, with subsequent lymphopenia. Although most strains of coronavirus exhibit strict species specificity, like other RNA viruses, coronaviruses can readily mutate under selective pressure during passage in vitro or in vivo in response to environmental conditions, and an S protein with extended host range is thus selected. These variants can efficiently use human CEA as receptors for infection of human cells. Such a mechanism may account for the development of cross-species infection, exemplified in the outbreak of the SARS epidemic.",

After cleavage, these proteins assemble to form the active RNA polymerase which transcribes full-length complementary (negative-sense) RNA. This, in turn, is transcribed not only into full-length genomic RNA, but also a nested set of 3\u2032-coterminal overlapping subgenomic mRNAs described above. Each species of viral mRNA differs in length but shares a common 3\u2032-end and a 70 nucleotide 5\u2032-leader sequence. Only the unique sequence not shared with the next smallest mRNA in the nested set is translated to yield viral protein. Due to the large size of the genome, genetic recombination occurs at high frequency between the genomes of different but related coronaviruses.

The S protein forms trimers before it is exported out of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and then interacts with M and E proteins to migrate to the site of virus assembly. In infected cells, the M protein is localized mostly in the virus-budding compartment, while at a later stage of viral replication, N protein is transported to the site of virus assembly. SARS-CoV expresses another structural protein, 3a, that is not only associated with intracellular and plasma membranes, but is also secreted and induces apoptosis.

Highly neurovirulent, moderately neurovirulent, and attenuated strains cause different clinical manifestations involving different patterns of infection of neurons, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and astrocytes. Demyelination can occur, which is mostly immune-mediated; irradiated or congenitally immunodeficient mice do not develop demyelination after infection, but when these mice, which lack T and B cells, are reconstituted with virus-specific T cells, demyelination rapidly develops.

This was followed after a further three or more days by the lower respiratory tract phase, comprising dry cough, dyspnea, and increasing respiratory distress sometimes requiring mechanical ventilation. Most patients showed lymphopenia (70 to 95%), with a substantial drop in both CD4 and CD8 T cells. Asymptomatic or mild illness was uncommon, as illustrated by studies of exposed health-care workers in which less than 1% of those without a SARS-like illness had serological evidence of infection. However, in the year following the epidemic of 2003, only a few SARS patients were found and these had mild disease. SARS-CoV infected both upper airway and alveolar epithelial cells, resulting in lung injury. Virus or viral products were also detected in other organs, such as the kidney, liver, and small intestine, as well as in stools. Although the lung is recognized as the organ most severely affected by SARS-CoV, the exact mechanism of lung injury is controversial. Levels of infectious virus diminished as the clinical disease worsened, suggesting that lung injury was due to an immunopathological mechanism. Similar to mice with MHV-mediated demyelination, large numbers of macrophages were detected in infected lung. However, this conclusion derived from samples of live patients-from nasopharyngeal aspirates, not from the lungs or other organs (Fig. 31.4) . In common with other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV infected macrophages and dendritic cells, but the replication cycle is not completed in these cells. Several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1, RANTES and MCP-2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 are expressed by infected dendritic cells; many of these molecules were also expressed at elevated levels in the serum of infected patients.",

Specific IgG and IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV were detected approximately two weeks postinfection, reaching a peak 60 days post-infection and remained at high levels for at least 180 days post-infection. High titers of neutralizing antibodies and SARS-CoV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes were detected in patients who had recovered from SARS, with high levels correlating well with a favorable outcome. This suggests that both humoral and cellular immune responses are crucial for the clearance of infection by SARS-CoV. Ksiazek, T.G., et al., 2003.

Clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural April 2014. Am. J. Pathol. 186, 652-658. An important unresolved issue is how SARS-CoV caused such severe disease in humans. SARS-CoV infects several species of animals, including mice, ferrets, hamsters, cats, and cynomolgus macaques, but these animals develop either mild or subclinical disease. This may be due to the fact that these animals have already experienced subclinical infection with a coronavirus from the same group as SARS-CoV. Consistent with this, the clinical course of SARS-CoV in patients in Guangzhou, China, was mild in the year following the outbreak of severe cases of SARS.",

Sequences of several distinct SARS-like coronaviruses have been amplified from horseshoe bats from Hong Kong and several provinces in China, and 30% to 85% of this species of bat had antibodies to a SARS-like coronavirus. Initially, SARS-CoV was thought to originate in civet cats, but these were later found to act as intermediary hosts providing a source of transmission to humans. Multiple serological studies demonstrated that SARS-CoV had not circulated to any significant extent in humans prior to the outbreak in 2002 and 2003. Some persons working in wild animal markets in China had serological evidence of a SARS-CoV-like infection acquired before the 2003 outbreak, but reported no SARS-like respiratory illness.",
