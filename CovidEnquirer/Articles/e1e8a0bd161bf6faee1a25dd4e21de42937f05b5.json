Conditional ablation of lymphotoxin-b receptor (LTbR) expression in LN FRCs and their mesenchymal progenitors in developing LNs revealed that LTbRsignaling in these cells was not essential for the formation of LNs. Although T cell zone reticular cells had lost podoplanin expression, they still formed a functional conduit system and showed enhanced expression of myofibroblastic markers. However, essential immune functions of FRCs, including homeostatic chemokine and interleukin-7 expression, were impaired. These changes in T cell zone reticular cell function were associated with increased susceptibility to viral infection. Thus, myofibroblasic FRC precursors are able to generate the basic T cell zone infrastructure, whereas LTbR-dependent maturation of FRCs guarantees full immunocompetence and hence optimal LN function during infection.",

These specialized niches are generated and maintained by different sets of vascular and mesenchymal stromal cells (Randall et al., 2008; Turley et al., 2010) . The mesenchymal stromal cell network of the LN T cell zone is formed by fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) which are characterized by the expression of podoplanin (PDPN), and extracellular matrix proteins such as ERTR-7 and collagen-I (Malhotra et al., 2012) . Furthermore, FRCs regulate immune homeostasis and reactivity through the production of homeostatic chemokines, the immune-regulatory cytokine interleukin-7 (IL-7) (Link et al., 2007) , and small molecules such as nitric oxide (Lukacs-Kornek et al., 2011; Siegert et al., 2011) . However, although LN FRCs are phenotypically well-characterized (Katakai et al., 2004; Malhotra et al., 2012) , their development from mesenchymal precursors has remained elusive.",

Lymphotoxin-b receptor (LTbR) and receptor activator of NF-kB ligand (RANKL)-mediated interaction of LTi cells with mesenchymal stromal cells in the LN or PP anlage is thought to be critical for their further development (van de Pavert and Mebius, 2010; Randall et al., 2008) . Indeed, mice lacking LTi cells fail to generate both LNs and PPs (Eberl et al., 2004; Boos et al., 2007) and molecules of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family expressed by LTi cells provide essential signals for the developing SLOs (De Togni et al., 1994; Koni et al., 1997; Kong et al., 1999) . LTbR engagement on stromal cells appears to be particularly important because the expression of IL-7, C-C motif chemokine 19 (CCL19), and CCL21 generates a positive feedback loop that attracts and activates further LTi cells (Honda et al., 2001; Ohl et al., 2003) . Mesenchymal stromal cells interacting with LTi cells during prenatal stages of SLO development are commonly referred to as lymphoid tissue organizer (LTo) cells and have been described as intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1)and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1)-expressing cells that appear around embryonic day (E) 16 in the murine LN anlage (Cupedo et al., 2004c; White et al., 2007) . Gene-expression analysis revealed that these cells provide molecules involved in LN organogenesis including LTbR, RANKL, CCL19, CCL21, CXCL13, and IL-7 (Cupedo et al., 2004c; B\u00e9 n\u00e9 zech et al., 2010) . However, neither global gene ablation of LTbRligands (De Togni et al., 1994; Koni et al., 1997) or the LTbR itself (F\u00fc tterer et al., 1998) , nor LTbR expression on mesenchymal stromal cells of the LN anlage (Cupedo et al., 2004c; White et al., 2007; B\u00e9 n\u00e9 zech et al., 2010) has allowed for the determination of the developmental window of LTbR-dependent mesenchymal LTo cell stimulation that is critical for LN or PP development.",

Here, we report the generation of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-transgenic mouse model that utilizes the Ccl19 promoter to target the Cre recombinase specifically to mesenchymal stromal cells of the developing LN and to FRCs and FRC-like cells in adult LNs and PPs, respectively. Surprisingly, ablation of the LTbR on Ccl19-cre + mesenchymal stromal cells did not abrogate LN development. Moreover, although the maturation of LN FRCs from myofibroblastic precursors was blocked in Ccl19-cre 3 Ltbr fl/fl mice, the basic infrastructure of the adult LN with T and B cell zone segregation and a functional conduit system was established. However, Ccl19-cre 3 Ltbr fl/fl mice were immunodeficient because myofibroblastic FRC precursors were devoid of essential immune-stimulatory properties such as production of homeostatic chemokines and IL-7. Moreover, conditionally FRC-deficient animals showed an impaired resistance to viral infection, indicating that LTbRmediated FRC maturation is critical for the maintenance of immunocompentence.",

However, neither of these markers is truly FRC-specific. For example, PDPN is expressed on different stromal cell populations (Malhotra et al., 2012) and hence Pdpn-cre transgenes target both PDPN + CD31 \u00c0 FRCs and PDPN + CD31 + lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) (Onder et al., 2011) . Here, we utilized the Ccl19 promoter to direct Cre recombinase expression to LN FRCs. To silence the Ccl21 gene, which is in close proximity to the Ccl19 locus, the murine Ccl21 gene was replaced by the human CD8 gene in the BAC construct. Crossing of transgenic lines with R26-eyfp reporter mice (Srinivas et al., 2001) facilitated screening for founders with exclusive transgene expression in nonhematopoietic cells ( Figure 1A ; see also Figures S1A and S1B available online). Because two out of seven founder lines showed identical stromal cell-specific transgene expression, all further analyses were performed with founder line 1 designated as Ccl19-cre. Staining of CD45 \u00c0 LN cells with antibodies against PDPN and CD31 revealed a normal LN stromal cell composition in Ccl19-cre 3 R26-eyfp mice ( Figure 1B) . Importantly, FRC specificity was high with 80%-90% of the EYFP signal being directed to the PDPN + CD31 \u00c0 fraction ( Figures 1C and 1D ). In situ analysis using Figure S1 .",

Ccl19-cre transgene activity was highest in the DN cell population (Figures S1C and S1D) with EYFP + cells being dispersed in all compartments of the white pulp (Figure S1E) . High densities of transgene-positive cells could be detected in the area of the marginal zone ( Figure S1F ) and around central arterioles ( Figure S1G ). In contrast, transgene activity in PP stromal cells was high in PDPN + CD31 \u00c0 cells and moderate in DN cells with around 80% and 20% of all EYFP + cells, respectively (Figures S1H and S1I). Because PDPN + CD31 \u00c0 cells in PPs are still undefined, we have referred to them as FRC-like cells.

We found that Ccl19-cre + stromal cells were highly abundant in the E16.5 inguinal LN anlage (Figures 2A; Figure S2A ). Furthermore, the E16.5 inguinal LN anlage had attracted CD4 + LTi cells, which most likely deliver the necessary LTa 1 b 2 for stimulation of the LTbR on mesenchymal stromal organizer cells. The number of Ccl19-cre + stromal cells grew approximately 3-fold until E18.5, whereas the CD4 + LTi cell population expanded only modestly ( Figure 2B ; Figure S2B ). To assess whether Cre-recombinase expression reflected the kinetics of Ccl19 expression in developing LNs, we determined both Crerecombinase and Ccl19 mRNA production in neonatal and week 2 and six LN homogenates by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Endogenous Ccl19 expression ( Figure 2C ) correlated well with Cre expression ( Figure 2D ) driven by the Ccl19 promoter on the BAC transgene. In contrast, Ltbr expression fluctuated with the highest expression being measureable in the neonatal LN ( Figure 2E ). Confocal microscopic analysis revealed that Ccl19-cre transgene expression was highly abundant in neonatal inguinal LNs ( Figure 2F , left panels). 3D reconstruction of high-resolution analyses indicated that Ccl19-cre-expressing stromal cells in the developing LN had formed a dense network ( Figure 2F , right panels) reminiscent of the FRC network in the adult LN. Whereas Ccl19-cre + stromal cells expressed low amounts of PDPN, the mesenchymal markers smooth muscle actin (SMA) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-b (PDGFRb) were highly expressed (Figure 2G) , indicating that the Ccl19-cre transgene targets mesenchymal stromal cells in developing LNs.",

            "text": "The differentiation of adult stromal cell subpopulations is thought to depend on LTbR signaling (Randall et al., 2008; van de Pavert and Mebius, 2010) . Because lymphocytes are rare in neonatal LNs and LTbR-dependent stimulation of mesenchymal stromal cells is mainly provided by LTi cells (Cupedo et al., 2004b; White et al., 2007) , it is most likely that Ccl19-cre + mesenchymal stromal cell in neonatal LNs received LTbR signals from LTi cells. Interestingly, deletion of the LTbR on Ccl19-cre + mesenchymal stromal cells did not abrogate LN formation (Figure 2H) . Furthermore, formation of a stromal cell network in neonatal LNs was not affected by mesenchymal stromal cellspecific LTbR-ablation ( Figure 2H , right panels). Likewise, expression of SMA and PDGFRb ( Figure 2I ) was not altered by the selective LTbR-ablation. Gross pathological examination of adult Ccl19-cre 3 Ltbr fl/fl mice (4-6 weeks) after injection of Evan's Blue revealed that all LNs were present (data not shown). In contrast, Ccl19-cre-dependent ablation of the LTbR in PPs led to significantly reduced PP numbers ( Figure S2C ). Taken together, these data indicate that Ccl19-cre expression in PP mesenchymal stromal cells occurs in a developmental window of critical LTbR-sensitivity. Conversely, Ccl19-cre-expressing mesenchymal stromal cells in developing LNs do not require LTbR signals to facilitate LN formation.",

The mesoscopic imaging analysis revealed that LNs of Ccl19-cre 3 Ltbr fl/fl mice had developed clearly distinguishable B cell follicles and a HEV network ( Figure 3A ). Quantification of the 3D data showed that conditionally LTbR-deficient LNs were approximately 25%-30% smaller than control LNs (Figure 3B) and exhibited a comparable reduction in B cell follicle size ( Figure 3C ), HEV length ( Figure 3D ), and complexity of the HEV network ( Figure 3E ). The OPT-based finding that LNs with FRC-specific LTbR-deficiency were still able to establish the basic LN infrastructure was supported by confocal microscopy, which showed that LNs had generated clearly distinguishable T and B cell zones ( Figure 3F ). The global reduction of LN size without specific impairment of substructures was reflected by the comparable reduction of various hematopoietic cell populations ( Figure 3G ). Thus, FRC-specific ablation of LTbR-signaling did not affect the formation of the basic LN structure with clear T and B cell zone segregation.",

Flow cytometric analysis revealed a loss of PDPN + CD31 \u00c0 cells that coincided with a significant increase of PDPN \u00c0 CD31 \u00c0 cells ( Figure 4A ). Importantly, the remaining PDPN + CD31 \u00c0 cells had lost LTbR expression ( Figures 4B and 4C ). Confocal microscopic analysis confirmed the substantial reduction of PDPN expression in Ccl19-cre 3 Ltbr fl/fl LNs ( Figure 4D ). However, ERTR7 protein production and the formation of the fibroblastic reticular network was not affected by FRC-specific LTbR ablation ( Figure 4D ). Moreover, the fibroblastic network still generated ERTR7-ensheathed collagen bundles ( Figure 4E ), i.e., the conduit system, which rapidly drained small molecules through the T cell zone, both in the presence and absence of LTbR on T cell zone reticular cells ( Figure 4F ). T cell zone reticular cells both in the LN parenchyma and surrounding HEVs had lost CCL21 positivity in Ccl19- cre 3 Ltbr fl/fl LNs, whereas vascular endothelial cells in HEVs still produced this chemokine ( Figure 4G ). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of whole LN homogenates confirmed the substantial loss of Ccl21 mRNA expression in conditionally LTbR-deficient LNs ( Figure 4H ). Moreover, Ccl19-cre 3 Ltbr fl/fl LNs produced significantly less Ccl19 ( Figure 4I ) and Il7 ( Figure 4J ) mRNA but almost normal amounts of the B cell zone chemokine Cxcl13 ( Figure 4K ). Taken together, these data show that Ccl19 promoter-dependent LTbR-ablation profoundly altered the LN stromal cell composition and abolished expression of molecules in T cell zone reticular cells, which are considered part of the molecular signature of FRCs.",

Moreover, upregulation of EYFP was accompanied by a pronounced increase in PDPN expression ( Figure S3D ). Crossing of Ccl19-cre 3 Ltbr fl/fl mice with R26-eyfp reporter mice confirmed that genetically labeled (i.e., EYFP + ) FRCs emerge from DN precursors in a LTbR gene dose-dependent fashion ( Figures 5A and 5B ). LTbR-dependent FRC maturation was associated not only with the upregulation of PDPN ( Figure 5A ) but also with a substantial increase in ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression ( Figure 5C ). Likewise, EYFP + PDPN lo cells from Ccl19-cre 3 R26-eyfp LNs expressed moderate amounts of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 ( Figure S3E ). To further characterize the phenotypical changes associated with LTbRdependent FRC differentiation, we first determined the expression of myofibroblast and pericyte markers in LN stromal cell preparations. As shown in Figure 5D , abortion of FRC maturation was associated with increased Acta2, Cnn1, and Pdgfrb mRNA expression, whereas Pdgfra and Cspg4 mRNA expression was not affected. Confocal microscopy confirmed upregulation of SMA in myofibroblastic FRC precursors surrounding HEVs (Figure 5E ) and in the T cell zone network ( Figure 5F , arrowheads). Likewise, PDGFRb was upregulated in FRC precursors in both locations ( Figure 5G ), whereas perivascularly expressed calponin-1 was specifically upregulated in myofibroblastic cells in the T cell zone network ( Figure 5H ). In contrast, the expression of the pericyte marker NG2 around small blood vessels was not affected by the selective LTbR-deficiency ( Figure 5I ). Thus, myofibroblastic FRC precursors require LTbR stimulation to acquire the characteristic mature phenotype with the expression of homeostatic and immune-regulatory molecules. ",

            "text": "To determine the functional consequences of FRC-specific LTbR-deficiency on intranodal T cell migration, we utilized intravital 2-photon microscopy. Adoptive transfer of C57BL/6 T cells into Ccl19-cre 3 Ltbr fl/fl mice or control mice revealed a significant reduction of T cell speed in the T cell zone parenchyma under conditions of selective LTbR-ablation, with an average speed close to Ccr7 \u00c0/\u00c0 T cells ( Figure 6A ). In contrast, T cell speed around HEVs was not affected by the absence of mature FRCs ( Figure 6A ). Because T cell motility within the T cell zone parenchyma is partially dependent on CCR7-mediated signals (Worbs et al., 2007;  Figure 6A ), we assessed whether LTbR-dependent FRC maturation with upregulation of CCR7 ligands impacts on dendritic cell (DC)-CD8 + T cell interaction. To this end, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-specific CD8 + T cells expressing a T cell receptor recognizing the H2-K b -binding S598 epitope were adoptively transferred into Ccl19-cre 3 Ltbr fl/fl or LTbR-competent control mice. Subsequent subcutaneous injection of S598-pulsed DCs revealed that the conditional LTbR ablation did not lead to a reduction of DC-mediated T cell activation (Figures S4A and S4B ). Next, we assessed whether the conditional LTbR-deficiency affects global immune responsiveness in Ccl19-cre 3 Ltbr fl/fl mice by using systemic infection with the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) WE strain, which is controlled in a CD8 + T cell and perforin-dependent manner (K\u00e4 gi et al., 1994) . Conditionally LTbR-deficient mice failed to reduce viral titers in LNs and to clear the virus from peripheral organs such as the kidney by day 8 postinfection ( Figure S4C ). Furthermore, Ccl19-cre 3 Ltbr fl/fl mice showed significantly reduced antiviral T cell responses in LNs ( Figure S4D ), indicating a globally reduced capacity to cope with viral infections when LN FRCs fail to generate an immune-stimulatory environment. However, under conditions of systemic LCMV distribution, other factors than deficient LN Immunity Lymphotoxin-b Receptor-Dependent FRC Maturation FRC maturation, such as the lack of PPs, could have contributed to the observed immunodeficiency in Ccl19-cre 3 Ltbr fl/fl mice. Therefore, we resorted to an infection system with exclusive replication in a tissue-draining LN. Following intranasal application, the murine coronavirus MHV establishes an infection in the dendritic cells (Cervantes-Barragan et al., 2012b) and both CD8 + and CD4 + T cells (Bergmann et al., 2006) . To assess the impact of the relative deficiency of CCR7 ligands in LN stromal cells of Ccl19-cre 3 Ltbr fl/fl mice, we compared conditionally LTbR-deficient mice with plt/plt mice, which lack the expression of CCR7 ligands specifically in secondary lymphoid organs (Gunn et al., 1999) . We found that mice with FRC-specific LTbR deficiency showed a more dramatic weight loss compared to plt/plt mice ( Figure 6B ) and exhibited higher viral titers in the CNS at day 10 postinfection ( Figure 6C ). The failure of both Ccl19-cre 3 Ltbr fl/fl and plt/plt mice to clear the virus from the CNS and hence to prevent weight loss is most likely due to the strongly impaired antiviral T cell response in this vulnerable organ ( Figure 6D ). Interestingly, recruitment of fully activated IFN-g-secreting effector T cells (Figures 6E and 6F ) was reduced in Ccl19-cre 3 Ltbr fl/fl compared to plt/plt mice indicating that the impaired antiviral immunity in Ccl19-cre 3 Ltbr fl/fl mice can only be partially explained by the lack of CCL19 and CCL21 within the CNS-draining LN. Taken together, these data indicate that LTbR-mediated maturation of LN FRCs is critical for the generation of protective antiviral T cell responses.",

These precursors develop into the mesenchymal LTo cell defined by intermediate to high ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression and the concomitant upregulation of essential molecules involved in LN organogenesis, including CCL19 (B\u00e9 n\u00e9 zech et al., 2010) Notably, LTbR and the tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) are highly expressed on both the mesenchymal precursor and the mesenchymal LTo cell (B\u00e9 n\u00e9 zech et al., 2010) whereby LTbR signaling in the mesenchymal precursor is critical for the transition to the ICAM-1 + VCAM-1 + mesenchymal LTo cells (White et al., 2007) . However, ablation of LTbR signaling in mesenchymal stromal cells in the developing LN, i.e., ICAM-1 + VCAM-1 + stromal cells expressing CCL19 in our model, did not prohibit the formation of LNs and the transition of the mesenchymal stromal cells of the prenatal LN into myofibroblastic FRC precursors (pre-FRCs) in postnatal LNs. Importantly, progression toward the immune-stimulatory, mature FRC was strictly dependent on LTbR signaling. Thus, our data together with previous studies (White et al., 2007; B\u00e9 n\u00e9 zech et al., 2010) indicate that LN mesenchymal stromal cell development is characterized by two distinct developmental windows of critical LTbR signaling, i.e., initially during the transition of the mesenchymal precursor to the mesenchymal LTo cells and as a final maturation stimulus for T cell zone FRCs.",

Again, LTbR-mediated stimulation of mesenchymal LTo cells triggers production of homeostatic cytokines and IL-7, which are essential for PP development (Adachi et al., 1998; Finke et al., 2002) . The results of our study indicate that CCL19 expression in developing PP mesenchymal stromal cells occurs during a critical phase of LTbR sensitivity. In contrast, LTbR signaling in Ccl19-Cre + mesenchymal stromal cells in LN anlagen was not mandatory for LN development. However, the presence of the LTbR on endothelial cells appears to be essential during early stages of LN formation . Future studies utilizing the Ccl19-Cre model and other stromal cell-specific Cre-driver mice will provide a comprehensive characterization of the critical LTbR-sensitive stage during LTo development in LNs and PPs.",

Our analysis indicates that the basic infrastructure of the LN including the conduit system and the HEV network is generated by myofibroblastic FRC-precursors in an LTbRindependent fashion. It remains to be determined whether other receptors involved in lymphoid organogenesis such as RANKL or TNFR1 compensate for the lack of LTbR. Clearly, LTbR-signaling was necessary for the maturation of FRCs from PDPN-negative myofibroblastic precursors and the optimal support of antiviral immunity provided by the adaptive immune system. Following exposure to inflammatory stimuli, FRCs respond with an activation program that leads to upregulation of molecules involved in innate and adaptive immune responses (Vega et al., 2006; Malhotra et al., 2012) . Hence, it is likely the LTbR-mediated stimulation of pre-FRCs serves as a critical switch for global immune responsiveness by unleashing the full immune-stimulatory capacity of the mature FRC.",

MHV titers were determined by standard plaque assay by using L929 cells. Analysis of MHV-specific CD8 T cell responses was performed by using PE-conjugated MHV S598/H-2K b tetramers (Sanquin, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) as described (Cervantes-Barrag\u00e1 n et al., 2012a). For peptide-specific cytokine production, 10 6 lymphocyte-enriched CNS cells were restimulated with S598 or M133 peptides and IFN-g secretion was determined by flow cytometry as described (Cervantes-Barrag\u00e1 n et al., 2012a) . LCMV infection and assessment of viral titers and antiviral T cell responses were done as described previously (Cervantes-Barrag\u00e1 n et al., 2012b).",
