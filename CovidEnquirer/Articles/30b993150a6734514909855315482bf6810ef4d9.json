Chronic exposure to endotoxins can induce and exacerbate airway symptoms and diseases. However, the release and degradation of airborne endotoxins from bioaerosol by microwave (MW) irradiation have not yet been reported. This study investigated the distribution and fate of airborne endotoxins during MW irradiation process, as well as the kinetics and thermodynamics of the degradation of airborne endotoxins. Results showed that MW irradiation induced cell lysis, thus considerably increasing the proportion of cells with ruptured membranes. Furthermore, MW irradiation changed the distribution of airborne endotoxins, sharply decreased the concentration of bound endotoxins from 230 EU/m 3 to 68 EU/m 3 , and increased the concentration of free endotoxins from 21 EU/m 3 to 122 EU/m 3 . These results indicated that MW irradiation released endotoxins from cells into the atmosphere. MW irradiation likely degraded endotoxins by exerting thermal effects, which achieved a total endotoxin removal efficiency of as high as 35%. Endotoxin degradation was a first-order reaction and required the activation energy of 26.3 kJ/mol. Fig. 7. Thermodynamic of airborne endotoxin degradation.

These results suggest that the embeded endotoxins can be released into environments after the death of bacteria or cells. Airborne endotoxins are present in the air in two main forms. The first corresponds to pure LPS molecules (free endotoxins). The second form corresponds to LPSs associated with other cell wall components or an intact bacterial cell (bound endotoxins) [17] . Chronic exposure to endotoxins can induce and exacerbate airway symptoms [18] , such as asthma, coughing, and respiratory diseases (e.g. toxic pneumonitis, airway obstructions) [19, 20] .

The endotoxins degradation tests were conducted under a continuous flow operation (Support information, Fig. S3 ). Both the kinetic and thermodynamic of airborne endotoxin degradation were studied in this study. The kinetic of endotoxins degradation was conducted at a constant temperature of 100\u00b0C. The residual concentration of airborne endotoxin were detected according to the above method (Section 2.2). The thermodynamic tests were conducted under different temperatures (40-200\u00b0C) given the same irradiation time (20 s) and initial airborne endotoxin concentration (251 EU/m 3 ). Each test for airborne endotoxin concentration was repeated thrice. Fig. 1 shows the survial airborne E. coli under various operating conditions during MW irradiation. A control experiment without MW irradiation showed no antibacterial effect (Support information, Fig.  S4 ), indicating that MW has a role in inactivation. MW irradiation exhibited a rapid reduction of airborne E. coli, and the highest removal efficiency (E, calculated by Eq. (2)) could reached 4.1-log reduction in 20 s (Fig. 1A) . Previous studies on MW application in waterborne microbe disinfection showed that several minutes were often required to achieve satisfactory inactivation performance [31, 32] . In this study, the fast inactivation performance under short exposure time compared with previous reports on waterborne cases, which adds to the data on the potential suitability of MW as an anti-bioaerosol technology. Increasing the irradiation time (Fig. 1A ) and input energy density (Fig. 1B) of MW can promote the inactivation of airborne bacteria. The experimental data in Fig. 1 demonstrated a linear decrease in survival logarithmic E. coli concentrations with irradiation time. These results suggested that the inactivation reactions of airborne E. coli. followed the first-order kinetics. Such microbial inactivation rate laws or kinetic models were often reported in previous studies [33] .",

High temperatures can cause denaturation and cell membrane damage [34] , as well as alter enzymatic activities by disrupting weak bonds in active protein forms [35] . Moreover, MW irradiation exerts nonthermal effects on cell viability by interfering with cell signaling pathways, generating current within cells [36] , and producing reactive oxygen species such as % OH [37] . Our previous studies indicated that a significant difference between MW irradiation and sole thermal treatment (Support information, Fig. S6 ). These results indicated that the two kinds of mechanisms played certain roles in airborne inactivation, but non-thermal effects should be the primary inactivation mechanism for airborne bacteria at temperatures around 100\u00b0C. Fig. 2 shows the fluorescence of cells stained with AO/EB before and after MW irradiation. Green fluorescence, which is emitted by AO dye ( Fig. 2A and B) , represents intact cells. The intensity of green fluorescence decreased (Fig. 2E) after MW irradiation because a great proportion of E. coli cells were inactivated by MW irradiation. However, the intensity of orange fluorescence ( Fig. 2C and D) , which represents injuried cells, significantly increased (Fig. 2F ). This result indicated that MW exposure significantly increased the proportion of cells with ruptured membranes. Similar finding was observed by Wu et al. [8] that the microwave-irradiated P. fluorescens cells apparently had damaged membrane envelope as observed in the SEM images. Previous researches showed that MW can alter enzymatic activities by disrupting weak bonds in active protein forms [38] , and produce reactive oxygen species (such as % OH) [37] , which was used to damage membrane envelope. The SEM images of E. coli cells before and after MW irradiation (Fig. 3) confirmed that the cells were damaged and ruptured after MW irradiation. Given that E. coli is a Gram-negative bacterium, which possess a thinner membrane layer than Gram-positive bacterium, its cell membrane is easily damaged. The results obtained in this study provided evidence that airborne bacterial cells are lysed during MW irradiation, suggesting that cell membrane damage is a crucial mechanism of bacterial inactivation through MW irradiation. Similar results were reported by Woo et al [39] . It was found that untreated E. coli cells had a smooth surface, while most of the microwave-radiated cells exhibited severe destruction. The surfaces of the microwave-heated cells were damaged and had become rough and swollen.",

Previous studies suggest that the LAL assay does not totally cover the bound endotoxin [41] , since lipid A is unable to activate the enzymes necessary for triggering the LAL reaction when the LPS molecule is still embedded in the cell membrane [17] . Although ultrasonic extraction technique was used to break up cells and release free LPS into the reaction medium in this study, the LAL method would underestimate the actual amount of endotoxins in air samples. Because the free LPS can agglutinate and form structures with higher molecular weight in aqueous solutions [42] , which can not be detected by LAL assay. Rylander et al. reported that the toxicity of inhaled endotoxin is high when the endotoxins are bound [43] . Therefore, the actual potential risk of endotoxins may be more significant than the experimental data. The effects of limitation on measured results still need further studies in future. Fig. 5 compares the airborne endotoxin concentrations under different temperatures. The results showed that MW irradiation at 40\u00b0C could not degrade airborne endotoxins, because the energy of a MW photon is about 10 \u22125 eV (2.45 GHz), which is much lower than the covalent bonds energy of CeC (3.82 eV) and CeH (4.51 eV). However, MW irradiation at 100\u00b0C and sole thermal heating conditions presented remarkable and similar degradation performance. This result suggested that thermal effect was likely to be the dominant mechanism for airborne endotoxins degradation. The present study proved that MW irradiation likely degrades endotoxins by exerting thermal effects, which is an effective alternative method for airborne endotoxins removal.",

From the curve, the slope of the decline was determined by the least-squares method. By using the value of the slope, the rate constant of bacterial destruction (k) was calculated by the Eq. (3). Fig. 6 shows that endotoxin concentration and reaction time are linearly related. This result indicated that the endotoxin degradation followed a first-order reaction, which has a rate law in which the sum of the exponents is equal to 1. Recall that an integrated rate law gives the relationship between endotoxin concentration and time. Eq. (4) predicts that the concentration of airborne endotoxin will decrease in a smooth exponential curve over time. Knowing the rate constant for the decay of airborne endotoxin enables engineers to design reactors to achieve the desired inactivation efficiency. The degradation rate constants for airborne endotoxin was calcluated as 0.008 s \u22121 . This result implies that the rate of bioaerosol inactivation is very high, whereas the endotoxin degradation rate is much slower. Some other literatures reported the degradation of endotoxins in water phase using AOPs (O 3 /H 2 O 2 and UV/H 2 O 2 ) [21] and photocatalysis [33] technologies.
