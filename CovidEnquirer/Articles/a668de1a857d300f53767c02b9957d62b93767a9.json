            "text": "Background: Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) cause common colds, and the recently discovered HRV-C is increasingly associated with lower respiratory illness among populations such as children and asthmatic patients. Objective: To determine how HRV-C is associated with respiratory illness and to evaluate changes in prevalence and species over 2 decades. Methods: A prospective study of children younger than 5 years was performed at the Vanderbilt Vaccine Clinic over a 21-year period. Nasal-wash specimens from children presenting with upper or lower respiratory illness at acute care visits were tested for HRV and HRV-positives genotyped. Demographic and clinical features were compared between children with or without HRV, and with different HRV species. Results: HRV was detected in 190 of 527 (36%) specimens from a population of 2009 children from 1982 through 2003. Of these, 36% were HRV-C. Age (P 5 .039) and month of illness (P < .001) were associated with HRV infection and HRV species. HRV-C was significantly associated with lower respiratory illness, compared with HRV-A (P 5 .014). HRV-A and HRV-C prevalence fluctuated throughout the 21-year period; HRV-C was more prevalent during winter (P 5 .058). Conclusions: HRV-C is not a new virus but has been significantly associated with childhood lower respiratory illness in this population for several decades. Temporal changes in virus prevalence occur, and season may predict virus species. Our findings have implications for diagnostic, preventive, and treatment strategies due to the variation in disease season and severity based on species of HRV infection.

Since its discovery in 1956, approximately 150 serotypes have been identified. [1] [2] [3] Although the common cold is often clinically benign, HRV infections can be severe in certain populations such as infants, children with wheezing or asthma, and older adults. HRV is associated with both upper respiratory illness (URI) and lower respiratory illness (LRI), including pneumonia, 4 bronchiolitis, 5 and asthma. 6 HRV is associated with the hospitalization of 5 of 1000 US children younger than 5 years and 18 of 1000 US children younger than 6 months. 7 HRV-associated wheezing during infancy predicts the development of subsequent childhood asthma. 6, 8 HRV infection also triggers many wheezing and asthma exacerbations. 7, 9 Especially in the spring and fall seasons, HRV-associated asthma exacerbations 10 cause missed school, hospitalizations, economic loss, and suffering in those affected.",

[18] [19] [20] [21] [22] However, most of these studies were limited to 1 or 2 seasons, and thus did not account for random variation by year, which may influence a given seasonal trend.

Diagnoses were grouped into LRI (bronchiolitis, pneumonia, croup, and asthma) and URI (coryza, pharyngitis, and acute otitis media). 28 Nasal-wash samples collected from children with URI or LRI were cultured for virus. 29 Samples that were culture negative for parainfluenza virus (PIV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, adenovirus, and samples that were culture positive for HRV were tested in our study. Samples that were culture positive for other viruses were not retested for HRV. All samples that were culture negative for PIV, RSV, adenovirus, influenza, as well as those associated with LRI were tested in our study. A random sample of available culture-negative URI specimens was drawn and tested alongside the LRI samples. Culture-negative URI specimens were randomly drawn from each quarter of each year on the basis of the number of samples available for a given quarter to yield approximately 25% of all specimens in each quarter. Of the 1735 URI culture-negative samples available, we tested 407. Thus, there were a total of 527 specimens with aliquots available for testing in our study (either culture-negative or HRV culture-positive), 190 from patients diagnosed with LRI and 407 from patients diagnosed with URI. On average, there were 24 (SE 62.33) samples each year available for testing. Figure E1 (in the Online Repository available at www.jacionline.org) depicts the number of samples tested by year. Data from children who were infected with human metapneumovirus (HMPV), PIV, RSV, influenza, or adenovirus were previously published [23] [24] [25] [26] 30 and were analyzed in this study by using our models for comparison with HRV.",

            "text": "We also found that when examining both age and season HRV-C demonstrated different trends than did HRV overall. One possible explanation is that viral interference alters seasonal peaks and prevalence between HRV-C and other HRV species. 39 It has been suggested that HRV may interfere with several other respiratory viruses, such as adenovirus, influenza virus A, PIV, HMPV, and coronavirus, based on the fact these viruses are significantly less likely to occur when coinfected with HRV. 40 Wisdom et al 39 found that though 10.7% of singly infected patients had RSV, only 2.4% had RSV when coinfected with HRV-C. In one of our previous studies of young hospitalized children, HRV-C codetection was 10% compared with 23% for HRV-A (P 5 .037). 41 Another explanation may be that HRV-C is more likely to be communicable in winter months. A recent study on guinea pigs suggested that influenza B was more transmissible (both with and without contact) at colder temperatures. 42 Although it is unknown why HRV-C peaks in the winter, recent work from Japan also supports this trend. During the 2008-2009 season, researchers found that HRV-C was most common in December. 15 In our study population because we observed a marginally significant trend over a 20-year period, it is likely that in Nashville the HRV-C burden is higher in the winter months. This suggests that rapid viral detection, particularly in winter months when HRV-C, RSV, and influenza all peak, could modify treatment.",

Although this result did not reach statistical significance and has a large data spread, it may be biologically relevant. Because of the experimental design, children with moderate or severe asthma were excluded from the original study, limiting the power to analyze the relationship between asthma and HRV. We had only 10 samples from patients with mild asthma that were positive for HRV; more data are needed to obtain a precise estimate of the true relative risk of asthma among those with different HRV species.",

            "text": "One limitation of the study was that we did not retest specimens that were positive for other viruses for HRV, thus likely underestimating HRV prevalence. In addition, we did not test specimens for bacterial coinfections, which may complicate acute respiratory viral infections. 43 Another limitation was that study viruses other than coronaviruses 30 and HMPV 25 were identified by viral culture or rapid antigen tests, which are less sensitive than RT-PCR used to detect HRV. Thus, we could not directly compare HRV results with those previously obtained for some other viruses. Furthermore, rates of medical visits may have differed over time and among families in Nashville during the 21-year period. Breast-feeding rates were low in the study population, which limited power to detect any effect on infection; some studies show that breast-feeding may protect children from respiratory tract infections. 44 , 45 We also did not test healthy children for HRV, which has been shown to be present in asymptomatic individuals. 46, 47 Strengths of our analysis include the prospective nature of the data and specimen collection, the use of molecular viral diagnostics with cloning and sequencing for HRV typing, and more than 2 decades of year-round recruitment. The demographics of children enrolled in this study were similar to those in the United States, 48 and so our results should be largely applicable to the rest of the country. We did have slightly more black children in this study compared with the general makeup of the United States (34% vs 13% black in the United States 48 ). However, race may not be a consistent risk factor for HRV infection. In a previous study from Nashville, Tennessee, HRV was associated more often with black children, 17 the opposite of the trend we found. Phylogenetic tree of HRV species depicting HRV species and URI (red circle) or LRI (blue square) diagnosis. Grouping URI and LRI diagnoses suggests that HRV species is associated with certain clinical phenotypes (or respiratory disease severity). Novel sequences are designated by ''VU'' followed by the sample number, and sequences matching published HRV strains are marked as HRV followed by the strain number.",

The temporal variation in virus detection we observed over 2 decades confirms that season is strongly linked with the likelihood of HRV infection and that HRV-C peaks during a different season than do other HRV species. These data suggest that HRV species can contribute to the severity of disease and asthma exacerbations in children and that certain HRV species are more common at different times of year. Further studies are required to better understand the pathogenesis of HRV species and their role in LRI and asthma to optimally target future diagnostic, preventive, and treatment strategies for specific HRV species and strains.",
