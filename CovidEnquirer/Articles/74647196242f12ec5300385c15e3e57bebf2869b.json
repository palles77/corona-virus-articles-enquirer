            "text": "Different mechanisms of action have been proposed for this molecule, and the most likely scenario is that it works in different ways in different viruses. 2 The first mechanism that has been suggested is the interference in the de novo synthesis of the guanosine derivatives (in particular guanosine triphosphate [GTP] ). Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase catalyses the formation of xanthine monophosphate from inosine monophosphate to subsequently continue the synthesis pathway of the guanosine derivatives. Ribavirin monophosphate is capable of competitively and potently inhibiting this enzyme, reducing the reserves of these nucleotides (or nucleosides) to half in the treated cells. Antiviral activity parallel to the depletion of GTP reserves has been demonstrated in studies with the yellow fever virus and paramyxovirus, such as the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Secondly, an immunomodulatory activity has been suggested, indicating that ribavirin may increase the activity of T lymphocytes, and, in particular, Th lymphocytes. This hypothesis was based on the observation that during the treatment with ribavirin in patients infected with HCV, it could reduce cytolysis without modifying the circulating viral load. Therefore, it would not have an exclusively antiviral effect. The observation that the L-enantiomer of ribavirin (levovirin) does not present direct antiviral activity, being capable of also producing an induction of the Th1 response in the murine model, supported this hypothesis. However, it has not been possible to recognise the immunomodulatory effect in vivo, and, even in mathematical models designed for this, it is concluded that the effect is based on direct antiviral activity. Another mechanism that has been proposed is that of direct inhibition of the polymerase. The main intracellular metabolite of ribavirin is ribavirin triphosphate (RTP). In this way, it could be a competitive inhibitor of other similar nitrogenous bases, such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or GTP. This effect has been observed in studies conducted with the influenza virus, reovirus and vesicular stomatitis virus. Some RNA viruses contain a structure with 7-methylguanosine, which is essential for the stability of RNA and which is synthesised in three different catalytic processes. In other viruses, the translation process is measured by a molecule known as eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). The ribavirin molecule could interact with the enzymes responsible for capping (RNA cap synthesis) or bind to eIF4E, preventing the start of translation. This mechanism could be responsible for the antiviral activity observed in some viruses (Lassa fever, SARS). Lastly, a mechanism of mutagenesis has been proposed. Given the structural similarity, the incorporation of ribavirin in the RNA chain would be possible and would produce mutant viruses during replication. However, this would not only alter the \"original\" chain, replacing GTP with RTP, but also the binding to the complementary bases cytidine and thymidine (or uracil) has the same efficacy. This is due to the spatial arrangement and the flexibility in the rotation of a carboxamide group. The mutagenic effect of ribavirin has been demonstrated in studies with poliovirus, hand-foot-and-mouth disease, West Nile virus and hantavirus.",

Shah and Chemaly 7 carried out a review of the literature regarding the works performed on adult transplant recipients with RSV infection and published between 1980 and 2010. They evaluated 26 studies, both prospective and retrospective (randomised and observational clinical trials), in which the main variable was mortality attributed to RSV or disease progression. The use of ribavirin in any form (aerosolised, oral or intravenous) appeared in these works. The overall conclusion is that the use of ribavirin (whether or not it was associated with immunoglobulins) reduced progression to disease of the lower respiratory tracts and reduced mortality. Inhaled ribavirin was useful, but it was especially more effective when associated with immunoglobulin, although its diffusion in the consolidated parenchyma could be reduced. The cost was the main drawback of this therapy (approximately $50,000 per patient).",

However, despite this fact, it can be concluded that treatment with intravenous or oral ribavirin is recommended at any time of the disease (with it being more effective in the first six days of the disease). Initially, a phase I casecontrol study of the clinical and diagnostic aspects of Lassa fever in untreated patients was designed (30 clinical and laboratory variables were collected which were analysed subsequently), and, once these variables were collected, a randomised trial was conducted with 70 patients (39 with oral ribavirin and 31 with plasma; pregnant women were included without being randomised in the latter group), without knowing at this time the results of the analysis of the variables collected.

Although it is true that it refers to its use in a clinical trial, what it describes is the onset of an adverse effect which is associated with recovery (\"shivering/chills\") and what seems to be related to the speed of administration of the drug (<1 min). These side effects disappeared after correcting the speed of infusion. Some studies have been conducted to evaluate ribavirin as post-exposure prophylaxis, but they have not provided conclusive results. 40, 41 Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever There is only one randomised clinical trial which evaluates the use of ribavirin for Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, conducted between 2004 and 2007 with 136 patients. 42 In a baseline form, there were no differences in gender, age, incubation period (around five days), clinical or analytical characteristics. The administration of ribavirin was done before confirming the diagnosis, meaning that the time to administration of it was around four days. No differences were found in terms of mortality, analytical recovery or length of hospital stay. Subsequently, two meta-analyses evaluated the usefulness of ribavirin for Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever. The first is from 2010 43 and reviews 21 works. The conclusion that the authors draw is that ribavirin in the clinical trial was not superior to not using ribavirin, but in the joint evaluation of all the results, mortality was reduced (RR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.35-0.90; 955 participants). What was not found was a difference in duration of the hospital admission. The second meta-analysis is from 2011, 44 and also includes the only randomised clinical trial, but only seven more works, which are observational with control group, are introduced. No benefit of ribavirin with the aggregated data is found either. Both meta-analyses underline the risk of bias in all the works, whether it be selection, external validity or attrition bias.",

Clearance of viraemia was even obtained in patients who died (in this phase of the disease the virus is detected in up to 80% of cases). Given that there is a treatment which has proven to be effective if administered in the first seven days of the disease (convalescent serum), studies which used ribavirin were conducted in advanced stages of the disease, which would justify the poor outcomes. It is probably not possible to conduct new studies in this regard, since there is also a vaccine which has proven to be effective at reducing the incidence of the disease. 47 There are practically no reported cases of the Machupo virus treated with ribavirin (Bolivian haemorrhagic fever): only two isolated cases in which intravenous ribavirin was administered and they recovered. 48 The same applies to cases of Sabia virus.
