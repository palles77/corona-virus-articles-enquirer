Although the initial SARS epidemic was contained, sporadic outbreaks of the disease still occur, suggesting a continuous need for a vaccine against this virus. We therefore explored exosome-based vaccines containing the spike S proteins of SARS-CoV. S-containing exosomes were obtained by replacing the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the S protein by those of VSV-G. The immunogenicity and efficacy of the S-containing exosomes were tested in mice and compared to an adenoviral vector vaccine expressing the S protein. Both, S-containing exosomes and the adenoviral vector vaccine induced neutralizing antibody titers. After priming with the SARS-S exosomal vaccine and boosting with the adenoviral vector the neutralizing antibody titers exceeded those observed in the convalescent serum of a SARS patient. Both approaches were effective in a SARS-Sexpressing tumor challenge model and thus warrant further investigation.",

Within few months after the first outbreak reported in the Guangdong province of China, the SARS-CoV rapidly spread out via international travelers and became a serious problem of public health worldwide. To date several isolated SARS-CoV infections are still occurring mainly in Asia although the major outbreak has been contained since 2003. This indicates that the SARS-CoV infection still represents a threat for the public health. In the absence of an effective therapy against SARS, the development of an effective vaccine is still needed.",

Cellular components of the exosomes such as heat shock proteins were reported to enhance the immunogenicity and efficacy of exosome-based cancer vaccines (Chen et al., 2006) . We therefore analyzed, whether the exosomal vaccine approach could also be exploited for the development of vaccines against enveloped viruses, such as the SARS coronavirus. To incorporate the S protein of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-S) into exosomes the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of SARS-S were replaced by those of the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus. This chimeric protein (S GTM ) was efficiently expressed on the cell surface, allowed entry of pseudotyped retroviral vectors, and was incorporated into exosomes. S GTM -containing exosomes were tested for their immunogenicity in mouse models as a novel protein vaccine against the SARS-CoV. Given the immunostimulatory properties of VSV-G (Marsac et al., 2002; Kuate et al., 2006) , we also explored the immunogenicity of exosomes generated from cells coexpressing SARS-S and VSV-G.",

To further confirm cell surface expression, 293T cells transfected with S expression plasmids were stained with a SARS-convalescent serum without disrupting the cellular membrane.

In addition, it could be beneficial if receptor induced conformational changes of the hybrid S protein also mimic those of the parental S protein. To test whether the S GTM protein is functionally active, SIV, HIV, and MLV-based vectors were pseudotyped with either the wild-type or the hybrid S protein. Vector titers were determined on ACE2-transfected 293T cells, which were more susceptible for vector transduction than VeroE6 cells (data not shown). Infectious SIV, HIV and MLV vectors were obtained using the hybrid S protein (S GTM ). Titers in the absence of a viral surface protein were below 5 GFU/ml. Incorporation of S GTM into vector particles (Fig. 3A ) seemed to correlate with the titers obtained for SIV, HIV-1, or MLV vectors (Fig. 3B) , while similar titers were obtained for all three vectors after pseudotyping with VSV-G.

Since we previously observed that incorporation of VSV-G into immunodeficiency virus-like particles enhanced immune responses to HIV-1 Gag (Kuate et al., 2006) , we also coexpressed VSV-G and S GTM in 293T cells and purified the released exosomes by ultracentrifugation. Both exosome preparations contained similar amounts of S GTM (Fig. 4C , left panel). The preparation of exosomes from cells coexpressing VSV-G and SARS-S (G + S GTM ) contained both proteins (Fig 4C, right panel) . In this Western blot analysis, both proteins were detected using an antibody recognizing the cytoplasmic domain of VSV-G. The ratio of the band intensities of the S GTM and VSV-G proteins therefore indicates that in the vaccine preparation VSV-G is present at molar excess (Fig. 4C, right panel) . These exosomebased vaccines were compared to an adenoviral vector expressing S GTM , since adenoviral vector vaccines were shown to induce strong immune responses to a broad spectrum of antigens encoded by the adenoviral vector. The adenoviral S GTM vector was constructed using a modified pAd-Easy system (He et al., 1998; Kuate et al., 2004) . The adenoviral vector was purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation and expression of S GTM was confirmed by Western blot analysis (data not shown).

Fusing heterologous proteins to Fig. 6 . Neutralization assay. (A) Sera from mice immunized with the indicated vaccines were diluted serially into serum-free DMEM medium and incubated with S-pseudotyped MLV vectors. The cocktail was added in triplicates to 293T cells transiently expressing the ACE2 receptor. Two days later, GFP-positive cells were counted under fluorescence microscope and the highest dilution that led to >90% inhibition of the vector infectivity compared to control infection was taken as the neutralizing antibody titer (closed symbols). The log 2 of the titers is given. Control infections for the specificity of the neutralizing antibodies were performed using MLV-based vectors containing the amphotropic MLV Env (open symbols). (B) Comparison of the neutralization activity of antisera from immunized mice and that of a convalescent SARS patient. The inhibition of S-pseudotyped MLV vectors incubated with different dilutions of a control serum (C-Serum), a serum from a SARS-recovered patient (P-Serum), or sera of mice immunized as indicated was determined. The log 2 of the serum dilution is given on the x-axis. (C) Virus neutralization assay. Vero cells were infected in triplicates with the wild-type SARS-CoV, incubated with different dilutions of antisera from the indicated experimental animal groups, and monitored 3 to 5 days latter for formation of cytopathic effects. The neutralizing antibody titer is presented as the highest dilution of the antisera that prevent cytopathic effects in 66% of the wells. membrane spanning and cytoplasmic domains of VSV-G targeted the heterologous protein to the cell surface and allowed efficient incorporation into viral vector particles (Owens and Rose, 1993; Jin and Wright, 2003) . This was now also observed for the ectodomain of SARS-CoV-S. The S GTM fusion protein was expressed at higher levels at the cell surface compared to the wild-type protein. In comparison to S GTM , incorporation of wild-type S into viral particles was severely reduced. S GTM was not only incorporated into viral particles but was also functionally active as it allowed transduction of ACE2expressing cells with pseudotyped retroviral and lentiviral vectors. This indicates that SARS-S-mediated fusion of the viral membrane with the cellular membrane is not disturbed by the heterologous transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains and suggests that neutralizing epitopes of SARS-S are maintained in S GTM .",

Although exosomes are constitutively secreted from several cell types as a consequence of fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane , the lack of detection of these proteins in S wt or mock-derived vesicles suggests that S GTM either induces exosome formation or enhances incorporation of HSP90 and CD82 into the exosomes.

In this respect, they mirror virosomal vaccines that are made by reconstitution of purified viral membrane proteins into liposomes. They differ from virosomal vaccines by the fact that exosomes do not only contain the viral protein, but also a wide array of cellular proteins, some of which have been shown to support induction of immune responses. Although exosomal vaccines have been primarily raised interest due to the fact that they allow cross presentation leading to the induction of CD8+ T cell responses, the multimeric presentation of viral surface proteins in their natural confirmation might also efficiently trigger viral surface protein-specific B cell receptors, particularly if cellular components of the exosome provide additional stimulatory signals. Since this could also favor the induction of neutralizing antibodies, we explored the potential of S GTMcontaining exosomes as a novel vaccine approach against SARS coronavirus infections. Two injections of S GTMcontaining xenogenic exosomes without adjuvants were sufficient to induce neutralizing antibody titers. After priming with the SARS-S exosomal vaccine and boosting with an adenoviral vector the neutralizing antibody titers exceeded those of a SARS-convalescent patient serum (Fig. 5C) . In previous immunization studies using soluble S proteins, several immunizations in the presence of adjuvant were necessary to generate reasonable neutralizing antibody titers (Keng et al., 2005) .",

This indicates that the fusion activity of VSV-G is required for its immunostimulatory properties and suggests that VSV-G-mediated shuttling of VLP-associated antigens into particular cellular compartments can dramatically enhance humoral immune responses. However, incorporation of VSV-G into S GTM -containing exosomes did not lead to a significant increase in binding or neutralizing antibodies against SARS-S. Since S GTM itself is fusion-competent, the enhancing effect of fusion-competent VSV-G might be masked. Alternatively, the immunostimulatory properties of VSV-G might differ depending on the type of co-administered antigen. After fusion of the exosomal membrane with the endosomal membrane, the large ectodomain of the membrane anchored S GTM should be in the lumen of the endosome, while HIV-1 capsid proteins localized within the VLP should reach the cytoplasm. Although VSV-G and S GTM contain the same cytoplasmic domain directing intracellular trafficking we cannot formally exclude the possibility that VSV-G and S GTM are localized on different exosomes, which might also explain the poor enhancing effect of VSV-G on SARS-S antibody titers.",

A single injection of the S GTM -expressing adenoviral vector induced neutralizing antibodies and reduced the growth of SARS-Sexpressing tumor cells confirming the immunogenicity of adenoviral vector vaccines. Whether the release of S GTMcontaining exosomes in vivo contributes to the strong immune responses observed remains to be determined. Immune responses to the adenoviral vector particle limit repeated application of adenoviral vector vaccines (Bangari and Mittal, 2006; Barouch et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2003) .

A single injection of the S GTM -expressing adenoviral vector inhibited tumor growth to a similar extent as the primeboost regimens. However, only transient suppression of the tumor growth was observed. This growth pattern was previously described for ovalbumin-immunized mice challenged with B16 cells stably expressing ovalbumin (MO4) (Bonifaz et al., 2004) . Selection of tumor cells not expressing SARS-S and their subsequent outgrowth might explain this observation.",

Since S GTM -containing exosomes and S GTM -expressing adenoviral vectors induce neutralizing antibody titers that exceed those observed in the convalescent serum of a SARS patient if combined in prime-boost regimen and since humoral immunity alone could control coronavirus replication in a murine model , both approaches warrant further investigation.",
