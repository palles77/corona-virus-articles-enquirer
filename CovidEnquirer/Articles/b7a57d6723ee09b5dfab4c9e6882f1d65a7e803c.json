Previously we showed that GL inhibits Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in vitro by interfering with an early step of the EBV replication cycle (possibly attachment/penetration). Here we tested the effects of 15 GL derivatives against EBV infection by scoring the numbers of cell expressing viral antigens and quantifying EBV DNA copy numbers in superinfected Raji cells. The derivatives were made either by transformation of GL on carboxyl and hydroxyl groups or by conjugation of amino acid residues into the carbohydrate part. We identified seven compounds active against EBV and all showed dose-dependent inhibition as determined by both assays. Among these active compounds, the introduction of amino acid residues into the GL carbohydrate part enhanced the antiviral activity in three of the seven active compounds. However, when Glu(OH)-OMe was substituted by Glu(OMe)-OMe, its antiviral activity was completely abolished. Introduction of potassium or ammonium salt to GL reduced the antiviral activity with no significant effect on cytotoxicity. The \u2423-isomer (18\u2423-GL) of 18\u2424-GL was as potent as the \u2424-form, but its sodium salt lost antiviral activity. The metabolic product of GL, 18\u2424-glycyrrhetinic acid (18\u2424-GA or GA), was 7.5-fold more active against EBV than its parental compound GL but, concomitantly, exhibited increased cytotoxicity resulting in a decreased therapeutic index.",

The molecular target of all nucleoside analogs is the virus-encoded DNA polymerase. Recently, we have reported that GL is active in a dose-dependent fashion against EBV replication in superinfected Raji cells (Lin, 2003) . Our results also indicated that GL interferes with an early step of the EBV replication cycle (possibly adsorption and/or penetration) (Lin, 2003) . Thus, GL represents a new class of anti-EBV compounds with a mode of action different from that of the nucleoside analogs that inhibit the viral DNA polymerase. In the present studies we extend our previous findings after a search for more potent compounds against EBV. We tested the antiviral activity of 15 GL derivatives synthesized in the laboratory. Here we report the identification of seven active compounds against EBV infection in vitro and elucidate their structure-activity relationships.",

Without drug treatment, approximately 95% of infected cells became positive for viral antigens (Fig. 1, panel A) . In the presence of drugs, a dose-dependent inhibition of the expression of viral antigens was observed (Fig. 1, panels B, C, D, and E) . The concentration of drug required to inhibit EBV antigen expression by 50% (EC 50 ) was determined from the plot of drug concentrations against % of viral antigen-positive cells, assuming no-drug control as 100. Fig. 2A shows graphical quantitation for compound (XV). The EC 50 determined from the graph was approximately 42 M. As shown in Table 1 , seven GL derivatives were active against EBV infection with EC 50 ranging from 42 to 175 M. All these active compounds exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition manner. The parental compound GL was used as a positive drug control. In addition, GA, the metabolite of GL was also tested in parallel with the derivatives. It is interesting to note that GA was the most effective compound to block EBV infection with an EC 50 of 5 M, which was 7.6-fold lower than for GL (38 M). However, GA was approximately 60-fold more toxic (CC 50 = 75 M) than GL (CC 50 = 4500 M).",

Superinfection of Raji cells with P3HR-1 virus results in shut-down of host cell DNA synthesis and stimulation of viral DNA replication and lytic antigen synthesis and production of virus. We have previously shown that the percentage of EA-and VCA-positive cells is directly proportional to the amount of EBV DNA in the cells (Lin, 2003) . Furthermore, we have also demonstrated that GL blocks EBV replication at an early step of the viral replication cycle. However, GL has no effects on EBV DNA in the spontaneously virus-producing cell line P3HR-1 and the latently infected nonvirus-producing Raji cells (Lin, 2003) . The lack of effect of GL in P3HR-1 and Raji cells, which are already infected, is consistent with our proposed mechanism of GL action, i.e., inhibition of virus attachment/penetration. Thus, superinfection of Raji cells represents a useful system for evaluation of compounds that block early steps in the EBV replication cycle.",

            "text": "The molecular mechanism underlying the GL inhibition of viral attachment is not well understood. A complement protein called C3d is a breakdown product of complement C3. Receptors for C3d, called type 2 complement receptors (CR2 or CD21), are expressed on mature B lymphocytes. When B lymphocytes recognize an antigen by their antigen receptors and simultaneously recognize C3d bound to the antigen by the complement receptor, the B cells are activated. The major EBV outer envelope glycoprotein gp350/220 is the CD21 ligand (Nemerow et al., 1987; Tanner et al., 1987) . CD21 is the only B-lymphocyte surface protein that binds to gp350/220 (Nemerow et al., 1989) , which mediates virus attachment to the EBV/C3dg receptor (CR2) of human B lymphocytes. A recent study indicated that complement C3 is a GL-binding protein (Kawakami et al., 2003) . Synthetic peptides corresponding to two regions in gp350/220, which have a similar amino acid sequence with the complement C3dg protein, were used to identify a receptor binding epitope. A peptide corresponding to the N terminus of gp350/220, EDPGFFNVEI, bound to purified CR2 and to CR2 positive but not CR2 negative B and T lymphoblastoid cell lines (Nemerow et al., 1989) . This peptide sequence EDPGFFNVEI is similar to the peptide sequence EDPGKQLYNVEA, through which the C3d component of complement binds to CD21 (Nemerow et al., 1989) . Synthetic peptides containing the LYNVEA C3d sequence block C3d binding to CD21 (Lambris et al., 1985) , whereas peptides containing the EDPGFFNVEA sequence block EBV infection (Nemerow et al., 1989 (Nemerow et al., , 1990 . Taken together these studies open the possibility that the inhibitory effect of GL could be in part due to the blockade of EBV receptor. The anti-EBV activity of glycopeptides (XII), (XIII), and (XV) could be attributed to the similarity of their amino acid residues with the peptide sequence EDPGKQLYNVA of C3d component of complement that binds to CD21. Ascertaining this possibility would require further study and is currently under investigation.",

Raji cells were superinfected with 10 units of EA-inducing virus in the absence and presence of various concentrations of compound (XV). Cells were fixed with cold methanol 24 h after infection and processed for EA/VCA staining using NPC patients' serum. After immunofluorescent staining (panels A-E), the same slides were counterstained with DAPI (panels a-e). Panel A, superinfected cells without drug; panel B, superinfected cells with 20 M of compound (XV); panel C, superinfected cells with 50 M of compound (XV); panel D, superinfected cells with 70 M of compound (XV); panel E, superinfected cells with 90 M of compound (XV).",
