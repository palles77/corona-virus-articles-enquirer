To find out the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon, we analyzed the transcription profile stimulated by IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 in Huh-7 cells and found that the transcription of a subset of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) including BclG, XAF1, TRAIL and TAP1 was enhanced when IFN-\u03b1 and \u03b3 were both present. Promoter analysis of BclG revealed that IRF-1 and STAT1 were both required in this process. Enhanced IRF-1/DNA complex formation was observed in interferon co-treatment group by gel shift analysis. Furthermore, IRF-1 activation was found to be generally required in this cluster of ISGs. STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation was elevated by IFN combination treatment, however, only the hyper-transactivation of GAS but not ISRE was observed. In conclusion, hyper-activation of IRF-1 and elevated STAT1 dimer formation may be two general switches which contribute to a much more robust antiviral symphony against virus replication when type I and type II IFNs are co-administered.",

Interferons are categorized into two major classes, i.e. type I (predominantly IFN-\u03b1 and \u03b2) and type II (IFN-\u03b3) interferon. These two classes of interferon bind to different pairs of receptors on the cell membrane but have overlapping route of signaling downstream [1] . Type I interferon preferentially triggers the formation of the ISG factor 3 (ISGF3) complex composed of phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 together with IRF-9 which binds to IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE) within promoters of certain ISGs. Type II interferon induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and results in the formation of STAT1 homodimers which bind to IFN-\u03b3 activated site (GAS) elements [2] . In addition, type II interferon can potently induce the expression of IRF-1, which has been shown to stimulate various genes with anti-viral, anti-proliferative or immuno-modulatory activities [3] .",

This is consistent with the lower levels of heptocellular necrosis and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and decreased titers of MHV-2 virus load [12] . It was also the case in an in vitro HCV replicon system in which IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b2 is co-administered with IFN-\u03b3 [13, 14] . Furthermore, an IFN-\u03b3 priming IFN-\u03b1 boost protocol in a clinical trial successfully invoked the response against HCV in six of the nineteen patients who all failed in a previous 6-month IFN-\u03b1 mono-therapy [15] .",

A small cluster of genes were identified whose expression was enhanced after co-treatment including BclG (Bcl-2 family protein G), XAF1 (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis associated factor-1), TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand) and TAP1 (transporter 1). Subsequent promoter analysis of BclG showed that IRF-1 (interferon regulatory factor 1) and STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1) were both essential for full enhancement of gene expression. Moreover, enhanced IRF-1/DNA complex formation was also observed in EMSA analysis. Knock down of IRF-1 expression by specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) not only suppressed the enhancement of BclG but also other members of this cluster suggesting the general role of IRF-1 in this process. STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation was enhanced, while only the activation of GAS (IFN-gamma-activated site) but not ISRE (interferon-stimulated response element) was observed. Taken together, we postulate that IRF-1 hyper-activation and elevated STAT1 dimer formation associate with enhanced expression of a subset of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) which may lead to even greater antiviral activity.",

Subsequent real-time PCR confirmed that, at least, the transcription of BclG long form, TAP1, XAF1 and TRAIL was indeed enhanced ( Table 2) . BclG is a novel member of Bcl-2 family with Bcl-2 homology domains and is pro-apoptotic when over-expressed. BclG encodes two proteins by alternative splicing; the long form of BclG is expressed widely in various tissues whereas the short form is restricted in testis [16] . Since this gene had not been reported to be an ISG at the time of analysis, it was selected as a prototype for further examination. We cloned \u2212 1000 to +146 region of BclG promoter and inserted it into pGL3-Basic. In silico analysis of this region identified an IFN-gamma-activated site (GAS) and an Interferon regulatory factor element (IRF-E) close together between \u2212 204 and \u2212139 (http: //mbs.cbrc.jp/research/db/TFSEARCH. html).

Truncation of 5\u2032 proximal sequence did not alleviate but increased the synergism until the GAS element was deleted (BclG4, Fig. 1B) . However, we could still detect about three fold induction in co-treatment suggesting that another factor is involved in \u2212 139 to + 146 region. Further internal deletions on the downstream sequence until \u2212 20 did not alter the expression pattern (Fig. 1D) , deletion of CRE also had no effect. We therefore focused on the GAS and IRF-E elements. Deletions of GAS or IRF-E both significantly altered the responsiveness to IFN-\u03b1/\u03b3 treatment. Double deletion led to complete unresponsiveness to either cytokine (Fig. 1E ). Since the GAS and IRF-E are very close with only 20 bp in between, we changed the intervening sequence into other two random sequences, however, no significant difference was observed (Fig. 1F) . Thus, we conclude that IRF-E and GAS are both important for synergistic activation of BclG transcription.",

IFN-\u03b1 did not significantly alter the reporter expression, whereas IFN-\u03b3 could slightly increase luciferase activity which supported the idea that other factors (e.g. STAT1) may be involved in the activation of BclG transcription in IFN\u03b3 treatment. Co-expression of IRF-1 also abolished the enhanced reporter expression after IFN co-treatment which confirmed the critical role of IRF-1 in this process. To further verify that IRF-1 is the nuclear factor associated with IRF-E, we performed EMSA analysis by using IRF-E corresponding to \u2212 132 to \u2212 109 of BclG promoter as the probe. As shown in Fig.  2D , IFN-\u03b1/\u03b3 co-treatment led to an enhanced band shift (arrow A) compared with IFN-\u03b3 treatment.

Although IFN-\u03b3 treatment did not result in a significant increase of BclG protein, co-treatment clearly up-regulated its expression (Fig. 3) . The different induction profiles in protein and mRNA level are presumably caused by the half-life of BclG and possibly by the different degradation efficiency in various stimulation contexts. As to IRF-1 level, minimal expression was observed in untreated or IFN-\u03b1 treated cells, but after IFN-\u03b3 treatment, an obvious induction was seen as described in previous reports [18] . In contrast to the enhanced binding activity in EMSA experiment, no significant increase of IRF-1 was observed in IFN-\u03b1/\u03b3 cotreatment which is still not well understood.

These data strongly support the idea that IRF-1 activation is a general switch leading to enhanced gene expression in a subset of ISGs. Interestingly, a previous report has shown that IRF-1 is required for TRAIL induction by both retinoic acid and IFN-\u03b3 [19] . As to TAP1, a GAS and IRF-E arrangement in its promoter similar to that of BclG has been indicated and that both elements were crucial for its induction after IFN-\u03b3 treatment [20] .",

Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 could be detected in either IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b3 mono-treatment although with differing intensities, in accordance with published data, STAT1 hyper-phosphorylation was readily observed after co-treatment (Fig. 6A) .

IFN-\u03b3 treatment led to a lagged ISRE activation compared with IFN-\u03b1, however, the combined cytokines did not enhance ISRE activity (Fig. 6B) suggesting that interferon stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) complex formation was not elevated. In the GAS assay, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b3 co-treatment resulted in about two fold activation compared with IFN-\u03b3 treatment which suggested increased STAT1 homo-dimer formation (Fig. 6C ).",

As to IRF-1, it is dramatically upregulated upon some virus infection or IFN stimulation [18] . Other observations suggest that IRF-1 functions as a regulator of cellular response to IFNs by affecting a set of ISGs [18] . Interestingly, in this study, the DNA binding activity of IRF-1 was shown to be enhanced after IFN-\u03b1/\u03b3 co-treatment. Further analysis supports the general role of IRF-1 in regulating this cluster of genes. Indeed, basal expression level of IRF-1 was found to be significantly lower in cells harboring the replicon [26] indicating that IRF-1 could greatly hamper the replication of HCV, and a variant clone of HCV replicon could block the DNA binding activity of IRF-1 and suppress the expression of some IRF-1 dependent ISGs [27] .",

            "text": "Intriguingly, based on previous reports, BclG, XAF1 and TRAIL are all thought to be associated with apoptosis [16, [28] [29] [30] . BclG can be conjugated with MNSF, a 14.5 kDa protein with 36% identity with ubiquitin, the post-translational modification of BclG might be implicated in T-cell activation [17] . In our preliminary study, BclG long form did not show significant pro-apoptotic effect, nor was there any direct anti-HCV activity at least in Huh-7 cells (data not shown). Given that its molecular function is still not well defined, BclG merits further investigations in anti-viral or pro-apoptotic activities. TRAIL, a member of the TNF family, has selective apoptosis activity in cancer cells while normal cells are largely insensitive [19] . TRAIL\u2212/\u2212 mice display no overt phenotype but an increased susceptibility to tumor initiation and metastasis [28] . X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis associated factor-1 (XAF1) was shown to be associated with XIAP; expression of XAF1 triggers a redistribution of XIAP from cytosol to the nucleus and antagonizes XIAP activities [29] . XAF1 protein induction is observed predominantly in melanoma cell lines sensitive to pro-apoptotic effects of IFN\u03b2. Cells constitutively expressing XAF1 were more sensitive to TRAIL induced apoptosis [30] . The similar expression kinetics and co-operative proapoptotic activity indicated that this cluster of enhanced genes is finely regulated to fulfill a specific task, e.g. immunosurveillance of cancer cells as reported [31] . However, their roles in control of virus replication cannot be excluded. Indeed, it has been proposed that a novel antiviral function of type I IFN is the selective induction of apoptosis in virally infected cells [32] [33] [34] . On the other hand, viruses also encode various genes that can antagonize the pro-apoptotic signaling. For example, NS5A protein of HCV is well known for its anti-apoptotic activity although the exact mechanism is still controversial [35, 36] ; EBV (Epstein-Barr virus)-encoded poly(A) RNAs (EBERs) exhibit striking resistance of IFN-\u03b1 induced apoptosis in Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines [37] .",
