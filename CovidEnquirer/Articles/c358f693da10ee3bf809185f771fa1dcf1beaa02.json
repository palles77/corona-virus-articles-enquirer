The method consists of adsorption of the virus onto mouse erythrocytes at 4 \u00b0 C, removal of unadsorbed material and elution of adsorbed viral material at 37\u00b0C. The eluate is then used in a haemagglutination test. Specificity of the reaction is checked by a blocking assay. No non-specific reactions have been observed. The sensitivity of the test appeared to be better than that of the electron microscope, at least when crude faecal extracts are used. By ultracentrifugation of the eluates the sensitivity of the assay can be further improved.",

Apparently the inoculum used contained a small amount of rotavirus which was not detected by immunofluorescence. Other factors that may have been of influence are the difference in age of the calves used and a possible strain difference.",
