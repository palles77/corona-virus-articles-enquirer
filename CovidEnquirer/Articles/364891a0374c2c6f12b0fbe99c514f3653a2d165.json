In this Review, we discuss the potential threat of bioterrorism, agents that could be exploited, and recent developments in technologies and policy for detecting and controlling epidemics that have been initiated intentionally. The local and international response to infectious disease epidemics, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome and west African Ebola virus epidemic, revealed serious shortcomings which bioterrorists might exploit when intentionally initiating an epidemic. Development of new vaccines and antimicrobial therapies remains a priority, including the need to expedite clinical trials using new methodologies. Better means to protect health-care workers operating in dangerous environments are also needed, particularly in areas with poor infrastructure. New and improved approaches should be developed for surveillance, early detection, response, effective isolation of patients, control of the movement of potentially infected people, and risk communication. Access to dangerous pathogens should be appropriately regulated, without reducing progress in the development of countermeasures. We conclude that preparedness for intentional outbreaks has the important added value of strengthening preparedness for natural epidemics, and vice versa. This is the second in a Series of three papers about terrorism and health in collaboration with The Lancet Psychiatry",

To date, 180 countries are signatories to the convention. Unfortunately, terrorist groups or rogue governments are unlikely to feel bound by international agreements. The potential for bioterrorism is of particular concern, since it can cause disease, death, and panic-in great disproportion to the resources expended. 1 There have been a few well documented cases of bioterrorism. In 1984, a religious sect in the USA deliberately contaminated restaurant salad bars with Salmonella typhimurium, intending to disrupt local elections. 2 The attack resulted in several hundred cases of salmonellosis and no deaths. The anthrax letters incident in 2001 in the USA resulted in 11 cases of inhalation anthrax, with five deaths, and another 11 cases of cutaneous disease. 3 Extensive circumstantial evidence strongly suggests that the perpetrator was a civilian employee of the US military. However, no evidence of a clear motive was found. Thousands of workers received prophylactic or post-exposure therapy, and affected buildings were decontaminated at huge expense. 4, 5 In 1993, a cult in Japan carried out an attack using anthrax spores with no physical casualties, 6 but later, evidence of post-traumatic stress syndromes was found in victims of the attack. 7 The perpetrators were apparently planning to use other agents such as Q fever bacteria, botulinum toxin, and Ebola viruses, 8 but they were detained before they could implement further attacks.",

            "text": "Following the breakup of the former Soviet Union, there was concern that loss of control of their biological weapons programme could allow terrorist groups to gain access to both the weapons and scientific expertise. Additionally, in the past few years, developments in the field of microbial genetics have heightened concern about the possible abuse of new technologies. Since there are so many unknowns, it is extremely difficult to assess the risks and threats of bioterrorism. 9, 10 The most likely perpetrators could be disgruntled individuals, terrorist organisations, or rogue countries that are believed to support international terrorism. Whereas individual attackers are unlikely to cause mass casualties, terrorist organisations could pose a substantial threat if they gain access to sophisticated biological weapons, materials, or scientific expertise. Although regulations and safeguards for securing dangerous pathogens in research laboratories now exist in most countries, the scope of these regulations and the extent of the safeguards vary. 11 Rogue countries have the necessary capabilities for a bioterrorist attack but might be restrained by the threat of the response of a unified global community. Knowledge gained from legitimate research that could also be applied to bioterrorism 12 is considered dual-use. As a result, the regulation of legitimate research on infectious diseases has increased. There will always be a risk of the \"insider threat\", 12,13 which typically involves a single individual, so it is important to assure that new regulations truly increase security and have minimal negative effect on legitimate research. The cost of regulations applied to research on infectious diseases, in terms of missed opportunities for international collaboration, exchange of pathogens, and sharing of novel agents, is often intangible and overlooked. It is essential to promote healthy organisational cultures to enhance both safety and security in laboratories. 14",

A bioterrorist attack has a lot in common with naturally occurring public health emergencies resulting from infectious diseases. However, there are some important differences. Since it is a deliberate act to cause harm, there are the obvious security considerations. The resulting outbreak differs in some important ways from naturally occurring epidemics-for instance, it is more likely to be a point source outbreak initiated by simultaneous exposure to many people. The infectious agent used is likely to be uncommon and possibly not endemic to the region, might have been modified genetically to make it resistant to current medications and vaccines, and produced in a way that enhances its transmission or virulence. Therefore, early clinical symptoms and signs after infection with a bioterrorist agent might be unusual, complicating both recognition and management of the disease. These factors could create greater public panic.",

Some of the greatest advances in the past decade have been in the speed and reduced cost of sequencing capabilities. 35, 36 Highly sensitive and specific PCR-based systems, coupled with modern sample preparation technologies, have enabled sequencing technologies to become less costly, more portable, and multiplexed. With fieldable patient-side diagnostics and sequencing outputs directly connected via cloud-based networks, 37 health-care providers globally can make decisions more rapidly and respond more quickly for individual care or outbreak detection. A rapid, cartridge-based assay for Francisella tularensis has been developed for use at point of care. 38 A system that uses a sensitive microsphere technology to detect both antibodies and antigens is now available to diagnose infections with Ebola virus and Lassa virus. 39 Although diagnostic ELISA tests are available for anthrax antibodies, 40,41 a compact system (GeneXpert) that includes both sample processing and PCR amplification can produce a result in about 90 minutes. 42 A rapid and sensitive method to detect smallpox virus has been developed for use at point of care, based on antibody immuno column for analytical processes (ABICAP) immunofiltration, that produces results in about 45 minutes. 43 However, diagnostic electron microscopy is also still considered a fast and efficient method 44 to identify smallpox and other viral agents. Ebola virus was rapidly sequenced during the outbreak in Sierra Leone to link sporadic cases with the transmission chains. 35 Advanced proteomics are also being developed as reference assays 45 and a new method for simultaneous immunodetection of anthrax, plague, and tularaemia from blood cultures has recently been reported, 46 using multiplexed suspension arrays.

            "text": "Effective global surveillance of infectious diseases is essential to control both intentional and naturally occurring epidemics. 48 Surveillance data can be used to monitor the progress of an outbreak, and for risk communication. To obtain information rapidly, the ongoing collection of health-related data (termed syndromic surveillance) has been introduced, to monitor patterns of symptoms and signs that are suggestive of an outbreak. [49] [50] [51] [52] Although it was hoped that syndromic surveillance would be a more sensitive method for early detection of an epidemic, frequent reports of unusual increases in incidence of non-specific illnesses can desensitise and paralyse the system. 53 In fact, early detection will depend largely on alert, prepared clinicians. For example, when the 2001 anthrax attacks occurred, an astute clinician identified the index case. 34 Emergency room and community physicians should be updated regularly on the clinical signs and symptoms associated with the most common bioterrorist agents. 54 The syndromic surveillance system would be more useful after suspicious or confirmed cases have been reported by physicians. A focused analysis of the surveillance data against non-specific, background disease rates could detect changes and provide information about the dynamics of the disease. Special legislation might then be necessary, to gain access to medical records. 55 The internet facilitates other potential forms of surveillance and communication about infectious diseases. 56, 57 One such system is ProMed, which was established by the user community and has proven effective in connecting clinicians and scientists around the world; it has already served as an early warning system 58 Standard contact and airborne precautions should be taken. 65 Supportive therapy and antibiotics can be provided for secondary infections. There is some evidence of the potential efficacy of thiosemicarbazones. Cidofovir has shown in vitro efficacy against variola, and has shown efficacy against other diseases caused by human orthopoxviruses, notably diseases caused by vaccinia viruses. It has also shown efficacy in animal models of orthopoxvirus infections. Since 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved drugs and biologic agents developed under the Animal Rule. This rule allows for approval of a drug that cannot be tested for efficacy in humans, but is effective in animals and safe in humans. The first drug approved under this rule was the monoclonal antibody raxibacumab for treatment of inhalation anthrax. Tecovirimat is a drug that inhibits all orthopoxviruses tested in vitro. It was found to be highly effective in treating monkeypox and rabbitpox in animals and is considered safe in humans. 66 Tecovirimat is being considered by the FDA for approval for use in humans to treat smallpox under the Animal Rule.",

Canada has established the Global Public Health Intelligence Network for worldwide monitoring of threats to public health. 61 A major benefit of a less formal global collaboration is the development of networks of trust among knowledgeable scientists and clinicians, who are considered early warning posts for both natural and intentional outbreaks. 62 The One Health initiative encourages collaboration between health professionals and is as important for bioterrorism preparedness as it is for management of emerging infectious disease and the global spread of antimicrobial resistance. 63",

Although supportive care serves as the basis of management for all agents, treatments for some of the relevant diseases have substantially progressed. The management of inhalation anthrax has advanced since the 2001 attack, 64, 70, 71 with improvements in critical care, and in treatment of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome, severe sepsis, and septic shock. Pleural effusions are routinely drained and there are more options for antimicrobial therapy. Antibiotics are still recommended for 60 days after exposure or diagnosis, together with the anthrax vaccine. If the vaccine is given concurrently with antibiotic treatment, the period of treatment could be shortened. Antibiotics for treatment of other bacterial infection are usually given for shorter periods, since the causative agents do not sequester spores. Tularaemia is treated with ciprofloxacin or doxycycline. 72 For smallpox, antivirals such as cidofovir or a related acyclic nucleoside phosphonate analogue appear to be more effective than post-exposure vaccines in preventing mortality, according to experiments in non-human primates infected with monkeypox virus. 73 This suggests that antivirals might play an important role when preparing for a smallpox outbreak. For viral haemorrhagic fevers, ribavirin might have some efficacy in post-exposure prophylaxis. A small-molecule antiviral drug, GS-5734, has been developed that appears to be effective in treating Ebola virus infection. 74",

In regions with poor infrastructure, it might be necessary to consider treating patients in their homes.

However, since a bioterrorist incident is likely to be caused by biological agents not covered by routine immunisation, pre-exposure prophylaxis is generally confined to vaccines for military forces, health-care workers, and emergency response personnel. To the majority of the population, only postexposure prophylaxis is relevant. Post-exposure prophylaxis for an intentional outbreak would include both those people known to be exposed during the incident and those people who were infected by others. The prophylaxis itself might consist of both vaccines and antimicrobials. When using live, attenuated vaccines, the relatively large proportion of the population who has some form of immunodeficiency has to be taken into account. 81, 82 Monoclonal antibody preparations are now being considered for prophylaxis in select, high risk groups. 83 Table 2 summarises pharmacological prophylaxis for Tier 1 pathogens. Currently, the vaccines that would most likely be used for pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis are the smallpox and anthrax vaccines. Since routine vaccination against smallpox was stopped in the 1980s, less than 50% of the world's population has been vaccinated, and antibody titres usually decline markedly after 5 to 10 years. 84 Residual cellbased immunity can persist for many years. 85, 86 Postexposure prophylaxis involves ring vaccination, which requires intensive tracing and vaccination of primary contacts, followed by vaccination of secondary contacts, 86 and finally, vaccination of all people in a defined affected region. For post-exposure prophylaxis of those directly exposed during the incident, vaccination can be effective if given within 3 to 4 days of exposure. 87 Since it might take that amount of time to detect the first cases after exposure, the vaccine will generally only be effective for secondary and subsequent contacts. Immune-boosting adjuvants 88 and toll-like receptor agonists have the potential to improve the immune response to post-exposure vaccination. 89 Serious side-effects are relatively rare 90,91 but can affect com pliance. 92 In those cases, lower doses of vaccine might be administered, to provide adequate protection with fewer side-effects. 93 Newer smallpox vaccines are in development, 94 including those that could immunise people who have atopic dermatitis. 95 Because it is produced in small quantities by collecting antiserum from immunised humans, there might be a shortage of vaccinia immune globulin, used to treat people who would have serious side-effects with the vaccine. One possible solution to this shortage would be to use antibodies against other poxviruses, such as cowpox and monkeypox, 96 because of their cross-protective properties.",

The protective, antigen specific memory B cells persist for many years after vaccination and are associated with humoral immunity. 99 Serum IgG response to the vaccine has been 100% after the fourth dose. 101 For post-exposure prophylaxis in unvaccinated people, the vaccine should be administered as a three-dose subcutaneous series (at 0, 2, and 4 weeks), in conjunction with a 60-day course of appropriate antimicrobial drugs. It has been given to thousands of US military personnel, and notable adverse events have been rare. 102 The anthrax vaccine is not recommended for pregnant women, although one study 103 with women in the US military, inadvertently vaccinated during pregnancy, did not show evidence of an increase in birth defects. In this study, 4418 women received the vaccine in the first trimester and 423 in the second and third trimeseter. More effective anthrax vaccines that require fewer doses are constantly being tested, 104, 105 such as the NEAT protein anthrax vaccine, 106 a dual purpose influenza vaccine that protects against anthrax, 107 and a combined anthrax-plague vaccine. 108 Apart from the 17D yellow fever live attenuated vaccine and the Junin virus vaccine, no vaccines for haemorrhagic fevers have been licensed. Since the west African Ebola virus epidemic, new Ebola virus vaccines that have been long under development are being used successfully in the 2018 epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 109 Essentially no other licensed vaccines are available for other Tier 1 select agents. The previously licensed, formalin-inactivated, whole-bacilli plague vaccine has not proven effective against primary pneumonic plague in non-human primate models, 110 Series US military. The vaccine has not been used widely for preexposure prophylaxis and has no place in post-exposure prophylaxis. New vaccines against tularaemia are under development 113, 114 including one that might provide crossprotection between plague and tularaemia. 115 The investigational pentavalent (ABCDE) botulinum toxoid vaccine was provided by the CDC for laboratory workers at high risk of exposure to botulinum toxin and it has also been given to military members that are at risk. The botulinum toxoid vaccine produces effective immunity after several months and has no value for postexposure prophylaxis because of the short latent period of the toxins. This vaccine was discontinued in 2012, 116 because of declines in immunogenicity and adverse events. New recombinant botulism vaccines are being developed, in addition to vaccines against glanders and Rift Valley fever. [117] [118] [119] Efforts are ongoing to greatly shorten the time required to develop and produce new vaccines and other immune approaches. Improved technologies are important for rapid scale-up and production of new treatment regimens, particularly following an attack with a contagious agent.",

Imported cases of Ebola virus disease were identified in the USA and Spain.

Effective preparedness is, in itself, a deterrent to bioterrorism, since it reduces the incentive to use biological weapons by making a country or region a hard target. It is also the cornerstone of consistent and effective responses to naturally occurring epidemics. The abuse of biological agents can be further reduced or discouraged with reliable intelligence and an effective response if it does occur. National and regional resources and capabilities will vary, but all will require infrastructures that are capable of recognising and dealing with a variety of biological agents. 138 The needs of specific populations, such as the paediatric population, pregnant women, 139 elderly people, and people with immunological disorders, must also be addressed. 140 Funding for biodefence is crucial to adequate preparation and response to bioterrorist threats. 141 International preparedness for bioterrorism has the dual benefit of strengthening the infrastructure for responding to naturally occurring epidemics of highly pathogenic organisms. Lessons from the 2014 west African Ebola virus epidemic show that health-care providers must always be watchful for unusual presentations of disease, and new and improved approaches must be developed for early detection and response. Health-care providers need more effective means of isolating infected patients, and better methods to control the movement of potentially infected people outside of the affected areas. Personal protective equipment should be inexpensive and effective, and available to use with minimal training and under harsh environments. Protection of health-care workers against infection remains particularly prob lematic, and should be a focus of research and development. The Ebola virus epidemic has highlighted the importance of improving the logistics of moving human and material resources in areas with relatively poor infrastructure. Risk communication and public education before and during an outbreak need to be improved. More clinical trials should be fast-tracked during development of new vaccines and antiviral drugs. Preparedness for a low-risk, high-impact event that is bioterrorism should be monitored constantly, tested in tabletop exercises, 142, 143 and integrated into the routine functioning of the health system. Here it would serve the dual purpose of ensuring that countries are prepared to meet the challenges of controlling epidemics of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases.",
