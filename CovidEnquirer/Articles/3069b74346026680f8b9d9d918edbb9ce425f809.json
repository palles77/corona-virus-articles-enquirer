In vitro, the crude H. cordata polysaccharides (CHCP) exhibited potent anti-complementary activity through both the classical and alternative pathways by acting on components C3 and C4 of the complement system without interfering with the coagulation system. This study was to investigate the preventive effects of CHCP on acute lung injury (ALI) induced by hemorrhagic shock plus lipopolysaccharide (LPS) instillation (two-hit) and LPS-induced fever in rats. CHCP significantly attenuated pulmonary injury in the \"two-hit\" ALI model by reducing pulmonary edema and protein exudation in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). In addition, it reduced the deposit of complement activation products in the lung and improved oxidantantioxidant imbalance. Moreover, CHCP administration inhibited fever in rats, reduced the number of leukocytes and restored serum complement levels. The inhibition on the inappropriate activation of complement system by CHCP may play an important role in its beneficial effects on inflammatory diseases. The anti-complementary polysaccharides are likely to be among the key substances for the heatclearing function of H. cordata.",

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the most severe form of ALI 9 . Complement activation is an early step in ALI 3 through both the classical pathway and the alternative pathway 10 . The loss of endothelial integrity in the process of ALI/ARDS also causes injured pulmonary cells to release some tissue factors or enzymes, which would lead to the initiation of complement cascade 10, 11 . A cycle of complement activation and lung injury is consequently formed. Hence, the application of complement inhibitors should be a novel treatment strategy for infectious fever and ALI.",

(Saururaceae) is commonly used for the treatment of pulmonary symptoms (including lung abscess, dyspnea, phlegm and cough), as well as infectious diseases, anaphylaxis, cancer and viral infection [14] [15] [16] [17] . A Chinese multiherb remedy with H. cordata as the principal ingredient had been used for the treatment and prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 18 and was found to have significant anti-complementary activity 19 . Our previous study indicated that the crude H. cordata polysaccharides (CHCP) 20 and flavonoids 21 were the major anti-complementary principles of this plant. Some anti-complementary polysaccharides showed potent effects on complement-associated diseases in vivo 22, 23 . The presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a prototypical endotoxin, in blood can cause the immediate activation of the complement cascade. We had reported that CHCP could ameliorate LPS-induced ALI in mice and reduce the complement activation products deposited in the lung tissue 20 . However, it is still unclear whether this effect was a direct result of CHCP's anti-complementary activity in vivo. Herein, the beneficial effect of CHCP on ALI was further evaluated using a \"two-hit\" ALI rat model induced by hemorrhagic shock plus LPS instillation, which is more susceptive to lung injury 24 . Specifically, the in vivo anti-complementary activity of CHCP was also assessed. Besides pulmonary infections, fever is another typical indication for heat-clearing traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Therefore this paper investigated in vivo the anti-pyretic effects and anti-complementary activity of CHCP on a febrile rat model induced by LPS.",

The rats were randomly divided into six groups: Sham, ALI model and prednisone (70 mg/kg) groups, as well as CHCP groups of 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg. All animals were anesthetized with 1 g/kg urethane (i.p.). The right common carotid artery was cannulated with a 24-gauge Angiocath indwelling needle filled with 0.4% heparin for the monitor of mean arterial pressure (MAP), blood sampling and resuscitation. The heparinization was performed by injecting 0.1 mL 0.4% heparin through the angiocath to prevent clotting. Hemorrhagic shock was initiated by blood withdrawal, leading to a reduction of the MAP to 4075 mmHg in 20 min. This blood pressure was maintained by further blood withdrawal if MAP was higher than 45 mmHg and by infusion of 0.5 mL normal saline (NS) if the MAP was less than 35 mmHg. After a hypotensive period of 60 min, rats were resuscitated by transfusion of the withdrawn blood in 1 h. Then, either LPS (1 mg/kg in 200 \u03bcL NS) or NS alone was administered intratracheally (i.t.). CHCP (100 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg, dissolved in saline) was given intragastrically (i.g.) at 30 min before the LPS instillation. The rats of the positive control group received a single dose of prednisone 70 mg/kg i.p. Sham animals underwent the same surgical procedures but without the hypotensive process, and received intratracheal instillation of NS. Serum samples of all animals were obtained from the right carotid artery at 0, 2 and 4 h after the administration of LPS.

In this study, both CHCP, the complement inhibitor, and aspirin, the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, significantly decreased the body temperature and leukocytes in peripheral blood of the LPS-induced fever rats. Remarkably, only CHCP (100 and 200 mg/kg) but not aspirin could inhibit the decreased complement level of the fever rats, indicating the characteristic effect of CHCP on complement system in vivo.",

These results further confirmed that the anti-complementary polysaccharides should be the key material basis of the beneficial effects of CHCP on ALI and fever. Composed of large amount of monosaccharides through glucosidic bonds, polysaccharides are too complex to accurately control the quality by one specific analytical method. Multiple methods were used to comprehensively characterize the structure of CHCP, including contents of carbohydrate and uronic acid, molecular weight, and monosaccharide composition.",

The anti-complementary polysaccharides were shown to play an important role in the heat-clearing effect of H. cordata. Moreover, CHCP has no interference with the coagulation system. CHCP could be a promising natural complement inhibitor to be applied in the treatment of complementassociated diseases. ",
