In this study, we mutated the two sites, expressed four resulting mutants in Escherichia coli and characterized. All mutants showed undetectable activity in trans-cleavage assay. In addition, we introduced a 31-mer peptide containing an auto-cleavage site to the N-terminal of the proteases and found the peptide could be cleaved efficiently by 3CLsc itself, but, among the four mutants, only the mutant Cys 145 fi Ser showed residual activity as detected by the auto-cleavage assay. The data supported the proposition unequivocally that SARS-CoV 3CL pro was a member of serine proteases involving His 41 and Cys 145 residues at the active site. The auto-cleavage assay also provided a sensitive and reliable compensation to the traditional trans-cleavage assay.",

The pathogen of SARS was identified as a novel coronavirus (CoV), which belongs to Coronaviridae family [1, 2] . Coronavirus is a kind of positive-stranded RNA virus characterized with an exceptionally large genome size (up to 31 kb) known to date. SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) replicase gene encodes two overlapping large proteins, polyprotein 1a (pp1a, $450 kDa) and polyprotein 1ab (pp1ab, $750 kDa), which mediate the functions needed for transcription and replication of the virus. pp1a and pp1ab are cleaved extensively by the specific proteases to release functional proteins and peptides. One of the proteases encoded by the virus cleaves at least 11 conservative sites on pp1ab and plays a main role in proteolytic processing [3] . It is named main protease (M pro ) and also called 3C-like protease (3CL pro ). Ascribing to its pivotal role in virus life circle, SARS-CoV 3CL pro has been suggested as a promising target for antiviral drug design [3] .",

There is a controversy about the coronavirus main proteases whether they all belong to the class of serine proteases because they have an ''additional'' domain at C-terminal. In previous studies, replacements of Cys with Ser in some of CoV main proteases produced inactive enzymes as detected by trans-cleavage assay [4, 5] . There were a few reports that Cys-to-Ser mutants showed residual activities either in a cis-cleavage assay [6] or in a trans-cleavage assay with an extremely high enzyme concentration [7] .

As shown in Fig. 2B , the activity of 3CL pro has a great dependence on enzyme concentration because the active form of enzyme was suggested to be a dimer. We had increased the concentration of the mutants up to 15 lM, but still no activity was detected. Even higher enzyme concentration could not be used because it will cause aggregation and precipitation at room temperature within a few hours. The great difference in trans-cleavage assay between 3CLsm and the mutant enzymes strongly supports a crucial catalytic function of His 41 and Cys 145 , and is consistent with the published data of other 3CL/3C proteases [8] .",

Therefore, the N 31 -tag was introduced to four mutants. After expression, three of the mutants, H 41 A, H 41 W, and C 145 A, yielded a higher apparent molecular mass than that of 3CLsc (see Fig. 3 ). It suggested that the three mutants did not show enzyme activity. The results could serve as a negative control; it excluded the possibility that proteolytic process was caused by the expression system. The cleavage should be performed by SARS-CoV 3CL pro itself. Interestingly, for C 145 S mutant, there were two bands visualized in SDS-PAGE (see Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 6) . The apparent molecular mass showed that the upper band retained the N 31 -tag and the lower one did not. It suggested that substitution Cys 145 with Ser in SARS-CoV 3CL pro produced an enzyme with a very low activity, despite the fact that the mutant did not show activity in trans-cleavage assay.",

We synthesized the peptide P440 (TSAVLP fl SGFRK) in which the Gln was replaced by Pro and performed trans-cleavage assay at 10 lM 3CLsm. No enzyme activity was detectable within 24 h. We also introduced LP dipeptide to the N 31 -tag at N-terminal and tested auto-cleavage assay.

[4] , Comparing with our data, those two 3CL proteases (C 145 S) probably also have residual activities in a cis-cleavage assay. Huang et al. [7] reported the very low cleavage activity of Cys-to-Ser mutant of 3CL protease in a peptide-based assay by using a synthetic pnitroanilide compound (colorimetric substrate) and three synthetic peptides (S10, S06, and S09), in which the activity for substrate S09 was too low to be determined. It should be noted that the enzyme concentration used in their assay was extremely high (76.9 lM; about 2.6 mg/ml). Under such a high concentration of enzyme, unexpected non-specific side reactions could not be completely excluded. In addition, in case of the synthetic colorimetric substrate, it might not involve the specificities contributed by downstream subsites. And Shi et al.
