            "text": "The advent of mass international tourism since the 1970s stimulated rapid growth for inbound and stopover tourism in Southeast Asia (SE Asia). Tourism represents one of the most lucrative economic segments for most SE Asian countries. The tourism industry is a major source of foreign currency earnings, creating millions of service industry jobs throughout the region. Increased per capita earnings within Eastern and SE Asia combined with the reduction of tourism prices in real terms within Asia are key factors in accelerating SE Asia's development as one of the world's fastest growing regional tourism destinations. SE Asia's tourism industry was spared the most severe initial repercussions of September 11, the 2001 attack against the United States and the launch of the USled global \"War on Terror\" against Islamic political movements. During the 6 months following September 11, 2001, international tourism experienced a decline predicated on safety threats to long-haul air travel. SE Asian tourism remained relatively buoyant throughout most of 2002 partially due to the perceived isolation of SE Asia from the Afghan and Middle East trouble spots. Equally relevant is the fact that most travel to SE Asia originates from within or near the region (Koldowski, 2003) .",

The world's deadliest terrorist attack in recent history specifically targeting tourists placed SE Asia at the epicenter of the War on Terror. The convicted perpetrators were members of the radical Islamic group Jemal Islamyia with affiliated cells throughout Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, and the Philippines. The Sari Club bombing had a devastating impact on tourism to Bali and throughout Indonesia, causing collateral damage to the security perception of many neighboring SE Asian countries. Although Islamic organizations have been active in SE Asia for many years, the Bali attack exacerbated fear of Islamic violence in SE Asia. The governments of many tourist generating countries including Japan, United States, United Kingdom, and Australia issued cautionary travel advisories which encompassed Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines. The combination of negative media coverage and negative government travel advisories was perceived as a major threat to the viability of the tourism industries in the region.",

Airlines, multinational hotel chains, cruise and tour operators servicing multiple destinations, and global financial institutions were far more amenable to regional destination marketing than the private sector during the 1990s. The major regional travel industry association PATA was, until the 1990s, primarily oriented towards America. The relocation of its headquarters from San Francisco to Bangkok in 1998 represented the realization of its organizational evolution from an America-centric association in its early years to an Asia-centric organization by the mid-1990s. PATA took over the role of regional SE Asian tourism marketing abandoned by ASEAN during the 1990s (Chuck and Lurie, 2001) . Although IATA's global headquarters remained in Switzerland, it maintained a high-profile presence in Asia (interview: Concil, 2003) . By 1997, SE Asian tourism growth was increasingly sourced from within Asia. During the 1990s Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan (the so-called Tiger Economies) had become significant SE Asia source markets. The Asian economic collapse resulted in a 2-year hiatus to this growth. The emergence of India and the People's Republic of China as rapidly growing tourism generating markets promised long-term tourism growth for SE Asian tourism destinations. The quantum growth of mass Chinese outbound tourism exacerbated competitive pressures largely due to the PRC government policy of limiting approved destinations for Chinese nationals. The criteria for a country to become an approved destination for Chinese citizens included operational and political elements. Murray Bailey's report on the Chinese outbound market commissioned by PATA in 2001 provides a detailed guide to the growth forecasts and the specific qualifications for approved destination status (Bailey, 2001) .",

Simultaneously the governments of many economically significant source markets including the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan issued travel advisories recommending their citizens defer travel to several SE Asian countries. From the perspective of these governments, most of which had citizens who were victims of the Bali attack, enhanced caution was not only deemed justified but their own societies demanded it. SE Asian countries, including Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand, publicly criticized these negative travel advisories and treated them as a diplomatic affront. Although government travel advisories have been issued since the September 11, 2001, attack their global media profile and public visibility has been substantially enhanced. Outspoken former Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohammed, Indonesian President Megawati Sukarnoputri, and Philippine Tourism Secretary Richard Gordon (who would be elected as PATA Chairman in mid-2003) were scathing in their condemnation of negative Western and Japanese government travel advisories. The Australian government was the most frequent target of criticism partially due to Australia's position as a country that assiduously courted inclusion within Asia while being perceived as a hostile mouthpiece of the United States (Wilks, 2003) .",

With few exceptions, prior to the Bali bombing it was almost axiomatic that commercial travel insurance coverage for passengers was linked to the wording of government travel advisories. Most insurance providers automatically excluded coverage for loss or injury from such acts as \"politically motivated violence, civil disobedience, war or terrorism.\" The insurance industry's term for this exclusion was \"the general exemption.\" After September 11 there was growing consumer and stakeholder pressure placed on insurers to provide coverage for unforeseen events (exemplified by the September 11 attack) and some insurers relaxed their adherence to the general exemption to provide coverage on a case-by-case basis. The high number of fatalities in the Bali bombing placed the spotlight on insurance companies. There was intense media pressure applied on travel insurers to assist victims of the bombing. Since the Bali attack several major travel insurers gradually abandoned the general exemption and either provided coverage on an individual basis or factored in terrorism as optional premium coverage. Concurrently there has been an erosion of the linkage between government travel advisories and insurance coverage. Until the September 11, 2001, attack it was a common (though not universal) practice for insurers to deny regular travel insurance coverage for travelers visiting destinations for which governments had issued an advisory to defer travel. The increased incidence of governments issuing negative travel advisories since the advent of the \"war on terrorism\" has led insurers to treat them less seriously as a commercially valid assessment of tourist risk and determine their coverage based on independent statistical risk assessments.",

In April 2003, during a period in which SARS was already exerting a significant impact on tourism in SE Asia, the annual PATA conference was held in Bali. Although venues for PATA's annual conferences are determined at least 3 years in advance, the 2003 conference was a most propitious opportunity for the Asia/Pacific travel industry to express solidarity with their Indonesian and Balinese colleagues. PATA prepared a crisis-management manual for the use of its members and affiliates (Winning Edge, 2003) . In July 2003 following the SARS scare, PATA launched their major tourism market recovery campaign, Project Phoenix, which included several major elements. It involved the Tourism Ministries of most SE Asian countries, media organizations (notably CNN), airlines, hoteliers, and major tour operators. The campaign's message was intended to reassure travelers that SE Asia was clear of SARS and welcoming visitors. The positive messages were reinforced by a series of pull marketing incentive programs designed to lure tourists. Project Phoenix included broad regional promotion of SE Asia combined with destination-specific promotion. Effectively, Project Phoenix was a private sector initiative involving a high level of public sector support from the tourism ministries of the major SE Asian tourism destinations.",

Singapore's inbound tourism numbers in 2000 with 7.69 million arrivals represent an all-time record. By comparison, Singapore's inbound tourism level was only 6 million arrivals in 1992. However, it must be noted that tourism in Singapore is dominated by short stays and a high proportion of stopover tourism. The average length of stay in 2001 according to the Singapore Tourism Board was only 3.19 days. Although not counted in tourism statistics, transit passengers remaining at the airport or passing through Singapore en route to other destinations may contribute financially to Singapore, but not to its hotel revenues (Singapore Tourist Board Statistics, 2004).",

According to Joan Henderson, tourism to Singapore in 2001 contributed US$5.3 billion or approximately 10% of Singapore's GDP. Consequently, tourism's contribution to Singapore's economy and employment creation is significant by world standards. Singapore's tourism experienced a minor downturn of 2.2% in 2001 compared with 2000, primarily due to the global downturn in long haul flights following September 11, 2001, which affected inbound tourism during the final quarter of 2001. Most of Singapore's major markets remained stable during that year with the only notable downturn from Japan, the United States, and Taiwan. Singapore was largely perceived as relatively immune from the threat of Islamic terrorism and geographically removed from the epicenter of America's \"war on terrorism\" being fought in Afghanistan during 2001 and early 2002 (Henderson, 2003) .",

Singapore became a classical collateral victim of the Bali terrorist incident. As discussed earlier in this chapter, the Bali attack focused world attention on the potential threat of Islamic terrorism in SE Asia. This was not a new phenomenon; but the scale of the Bali attack, the fact that the majority of victims were tourists from Western countries, and the intense media coverage of the incident had regional implications. In Singapore, days after Bali, the US, British, and Australian intelligence services claimed to identify a Jemayal Islamiya/Al Qaeda plot to attack several Western diplomatic legations in Singapore. Several suspects were arrested by Singapore police and documents and videotapes were produced to support these allegations. The foreign ministries of several of Singapore's main source markets including Australia, United Kingdom, United States, and Japan issued travel advisories to defer nonessential travel to Singapore. Although this level of warning remained in force relatively briefly, the advisories aroused outrage throughout Singapore, especially in its tourism industry. Singapore was not the only SE Asian country subjected to negative travel advisories following the Bali bombing. However, the very concept of a highly regulated and ordered society such as Singapore being defined as a tourism security risk was considered by the political and business elite of Singapore as a diplomatic insult and a loss of face.",

According to the Singapore Ministry of Tourism, a Chinese doctor visiting Hong Kong in late February unwittingly infected several hotel guests, including a number of Singaporeans who carried the disease home to Singapore. At its zenith, by late May, a total of 238 people in Singapore were diagnosed with the virus, of whom 33 died. A further 930 people were placed under preventive quarantine. As Joan Henderson correctly observes, the crisis surrounding SARS was one of fear rather than of substance. This is not to suggest the very real concern generated by SARS, especially among those unfortunate enough to have contracted the condition. In global epidemiological terms, the SARS outbreak in Singapore was relatively minor compared to the 1980s Hong Kong Flu. The overwhelming media coverage of SARS accompanied by the widespread dissemination of World Health Organization warnings in the media and government travel advisories created a global impression that Singapore was a latter day leper colony. The psychological fear of a looming pandemic quickly descended on neighboring countries. Travelers were instilled with dread about visiting or transiting Singapore or even flying in aircraft that might travel in the general direction of Singapore (Henderson, 2003a) .",

The primary message communicated, of Singapore being SARS-free, incorporated a range of inducements and discounts designed to encourage travel agents to sell and promote Singapore to their clients. Travelers visiting Singapore were made aware of an extensive range of discounted and value-added deals on tours, hotel accommodation, access to attractions, etc. Promotions targeted at the travel industry in specific source markets incorporated the Singapore Roars campaign as part of a cooperative marketing exercise with campaigns to visit Malaysia, Thailand, Hong Kong, and the Philippines. This strategy was part of a broader ASEAN and PATA approach to tourism recovery. The Singapore Roars campaign marked the first occasion for Singapore's tourism industry in which a destination-specific recovery campaign was conducted in conjunction with a broader regional tourism recovery campaign. The significant downturn of tourism to most of SE Asia irrespective of the prevalence or even presence of SARS was a common factor prompting a cooperative approach. Operational and budgetary benefits derived from sharing the costs between government and private sector stakeholders communicating a common regional message to the trade and consumers in key source markets were persuasive reasons to cooperate.",

A consortium of 270 private tour operators, hoteliers, attractions, shopping outlets, and airlines contributed marketing funds and offered a range of special deals to expand incentive arrangements designed to reactivate tourism demand for Singapore. By November 2003, it was clear statistically that the recovery process was achieving success. November 2003 arrival figures for Singapore were 7.3% up on the preceding year. However, it must be recalled that November 2002 figures were historically low due primarily to the impact of the Bali incident on SE Asian regional tourism. The impact of SARS was pronounced on the annualized figures for Singapore's inbound tourism, which suffered a 19.04% drop in 2003 compared to 2002 or 6.127 million tourists in 2003 compared to 7.293 million in 2002 (Singapore Tourist Board Statistics, 2003 . The relative speed and success of Singapore's recovery exemplify the best elements of a professionally managed restoration marketing campaign. Singapore Roars was coordinated and centralized by the Singapore Tourism Board involving a high level of cooperation with national carrier Singapore Airlines, the private sector of Singapore's tourism industry, especially hoteliers, major attractions, and inbound tour operators. Singapore's advantage in this achievement is largely due to the fact that it is a highly regulated and compact city-state and there is universal recognition in Singapore that tourism is a strategically and economically significant industry.",

The Balinese regional tourism authority produced a Tourism Security and Safety: From Theory to Practice highly professional promotional film that illustrated the distinction between negative perception and the actual experience of travelers in 2003.

According to Australian, British, American, and Japanese travel industry professionals invited by the Indonesian government to assist in the recovery, the greatest barrier to implementing a recovery was the ineptitude and incompetence of the Indonesian government and the Indonesian Ministry of Tourism. The Indonesian government ignored professional advice and implemented policies counterproductive to an effective tourism recovery campaign. The Indonesian government compounded its problems from the very beginning of the Bali crisis by its failure to show due concern for the welfare of the victims and launching into attacks verging on the paranoia against governments that had issued negative travel advisories after the bombing. Indonesian government attacks against the Australian government were especially vituperative. Considering that Australians accounted for almost half the victims of the Sari Club attack, the Indonesian response to the advisories demonstrated insensitivity at best, and at worst a petulant abandonment of diplomacy. The attitude toward Australia, in particular, was colored by wider strains in bilateral relations including Timor's struggle for independence from Indonesia in 1999 and Australia's prominent military and diplomatic involvement as a guarantor of this process.",

The primary basis of his criticism was that the reputation of the entire country was under attack because of activities that took place in one particular locality.

Gordon's demand for specificity in both media coverage and government travel advisories resonated with the governments and tourism officials in many other countries in SE Asia that shared similar problems after the Bali bombing.

In effect, the more citizens Filipinos could identify as visiting because of their individual promotion, the cheaper the home visit would be. The expatriate program was designed as an attractive bonus/incentive scheme for the many Filipino citizens working abroad on low incomes with families in the Philippines. Provided they could identify a given number of tourists, the home visit for the expatriate would be free of charge. As Filipino nationals traditionally represented 5% of the inbound tourist market during the 1990s, the bonus scheme was a potentially effective program to bolster inbound tourism numbers.

The alliance works on both restoring the image and marketability of tourism destinations and regions concurrently to sellers and distributors of tourism product and to consumers. Source markets Markets that are the main sources from where tourists are attracted to the destination or region. This is usually determined by country of origin and measured by counting the citizenship of tourist arrivals. Government travel advisories Assessments determined by ministries of foreign governments that focus on the security and safety of destinations. These are designed to inform citizens of the issuing country of the likely threats that citizens of that country may encounter if visiting a given destination. In most instances advisories are graded in accordance with a perceived level of threat. General exemption Insurance companies frequently deny cover to insured travelers who incur loss, injury, or death resulting from politically motivated violence. In insurance parlance, denial of such coverage is labeled as \"the general exemption.\" The general exemption is currently undergoing review as a result of consumer pressure. Regional marketing In the context of this chapter, regional marketing involves the coordinated promotion and marketing of a group of countries to a commonly targeted source market or set of source markets. PATA and ASEAN employed regional marketing of several SE Asian destinations to specific source markets including China, Japan, Australia, Europe, and the United States with the aim of encouraging tourists to visit more than one of the destinations in a single trip.
