The virus categorized as invasive is capable of infection and showing pathogenicity (Mcfadden, 2006) . The host cells possess the ability to evolve and carry out various network of defensive measures against the pathogens but some microbial pathogens have the ability to neutralize the defensive measures of the host cells, rendering them useless (Mcfadden, 2006) . It is a challenging and puzzling job to identifying the complex host responses that occur when a viral infection is encountered by the living host. It requires finding and categorizing the various host factors which could be involved actively in the cycle of virus infection. Moreover, there is also a need to categorize the identified host responses into a qualitative and a quantitative category through viral pathogenesis (Zheng et al., 2012) .",

Some of the traditional techniques used to discover many of the well-known viruses consist of electron microscopy, inoculation studies, cell culture, and serology (Storch, 2007) . These techniques have a lot of limitations such as the fact that viruses, because of being so small in size, cannot be cultured in a laboratory but rather have to be characterized by utilizing molecular methods. However, there have been numerous technological advances in the field of virology. This advancement in technology has set the precedent for metagenomics, a study of a collection of microbial populations called the microbiome. It is a culture-independent study which analyzes the content of the nucleotide sequence in the sample (Petrosino et al., 2009) . The study of the viral microbiome, also known as the virome, is conducted on different samples of biological and environmental applications on humans, animals, water, soil, and plants (Breitbart et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2006; Finkbeiner et al., 2008; Schoenfeld et al., 2008; Fierer et al., 2007) .",

Mass spectrometry is one of the most core and emergent part of the most important discoveries made in the field of virology. The virus\u00c0host cell has formed a complex evolutionary relation because of their dynamic interactions that work to either sponsoring virus replication or help the host to carry out its defense against the pathogens invading the host cell and the body. The viral cell promotes multiple proteome changes which makes the understanding of the virus at a molecular level, a difficult task requiring both breadth and an in-depth analysis of the infection. Mass spectrometry is the solution to bridge the gap between experimental dichotomies. Its use in unbiased system analysis and hypothesis-run studies has fastened the pace of discoveries in the area of virus pathogenicity and defense of the host (Greco et al., 2014) .",

It is used to study the proteins and the proteome and its structure which is very important when studying the evolution of viral proteins when viruses replicate within the host cell (Jorba et al., 2008) . It uses a dual epitope tag for continued immunoaffinity isolations and it has been used in cells infected by viruses. This technique was used to isolate the vaccinia virus called A56 as well as K2 proteins. This was done by using a streptavidin and a calmodulin-attaching TAP system. The virus and the proteins were separated as they localized on to the surface of the cell and were then needed for interaction with the entry fused complex (Moss, 2007) . 2. Co-immunoprecipitation\u00c0based mass spectrometry: This technique is used to identify the components that bind to a target protein. Co-immunoprecipitation is performed either in a single-step process or as a component of tandem purification. To obtain the target from the solution, an antibody which targets a known member of the complex is attached to a bead and then incubated with lysate. This antibody which is used for co-immunoprecipitation recognizes the protein of our interest or tagged protein which has been made by genetically fusing a tag with our protein of concern.",

This tag can then further on be used for a tandem purification or a multi-or single-step purification (Schaffer et al., 2010) . The technique was used to define the protein localization in Caenorhabditis elegans. In this experimental design, several tags were constructed and used in C. elegans. The reason behind this was that the functional effect of adding a single tag is not usually known and, therefore, different tags are attached at the C or the N terminus. The functionality of the tagged protein can be determined if it is able to extract the phenotype of a null mutant. Moreover, it is common to use green fluorescent protein\u00c0tagged proteins to govern protein localization in C. elegans and this can also be conducted as a single-step process of purification (Zhang et al., 2007) . 3. HLA peptidome scanning chip\u00c0based mass spectrometry approach: This technique is used to look for peptides associated with disease as well as mutant or differently expressed proteins in a host cell after a viral infection. An example of the use of this technique is in the defense mechanisms employed by the cytotoxic T lymphocytes within the human body against the intracellular pathogens that attack the body. HLA class 1 associated immunopeptides by mass spectrometry has become a very important tool to increase our understanding of the T-cell responses against the pathogens, for example, HIV-1 (Ternette et al., 2015) .",

The potential of this combination of metagenomics and metatranscriptomics can be observed by looking into the Franzosa study (Franzosa et al., 2014) which states that a fraction of almost 59% of the microbial transcripts are differentially regulated relative to their genomic abundances. Furthermore, it depicted the quantity of gene families, with many that were less abundant at the metagenomics level turning out to be quite active at the level of metatranscriptomics and vice versa (Franzosa et al., 2014) . It can be concluded that performing one of the two techniques alone could lead to underestimations or overestimations of the functional relevance of the genes which are encoded in the metagenomes. The author also adds that the functional diversity at the level of transcription displays a subject-specific metagenome regulation pattern which is measured by the function of the top 10 gene families in the specific analyzed individual (Franzosa et al., 2014) .",

Therefore there is a room for improvement and exploration for the development of target-based biochemical assays. Cell-based assays are used to pinpoint the target compounds used against the viral proteins. Since viruses have limited coding capacities, the screening can provide straightforward evidence whether a specific compound hampers the viral replication process by targeting the viral proteins.
