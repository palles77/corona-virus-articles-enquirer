To identify other antigens with serodiagnostic potential, immunoblot studies following sodium dodecyl sulphatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were carried out. Sera from pigs experimentally infected with Brucella suis and naturally infected feral pigs, sera from pigs from a farm with a known history of Yersinia enterocolitica 0:9 infection, Brucella Complement Fixation Test (CFT) reactor pigs (aetiology unknown) and pigs from consistently Brucella CFT negative farms were examined. Although B. suis infected pigs recognized a total of nine B. melitensis antigens, individual pigs rarely recognized more than three antigens in the range. A 62 kDa antigen was recognized by the majority (73%) of the Brucella infected pigs, but only by 10 to 23% of pigs from the other groups. This antigen was shown to be the Brucella homologue of the ubiquitous 65 kDa heat shock protein (HSP-65) family by immunoblot studies with 14 monoclonal antibodies to the Mycobacterium leprae HSP-65. Only four of these monoclones (Y 1.2, ML-30, D7C and IIIC8) identified the B. melitensis 62 kDa protein suggesting that unshared, potentially Brucella specific, regions exist.",

            "text": "Since 1988 there has been a marked increase in the number of pigs failing export tests for brucellosis in Great Britain. Wrathall et al. (1993) confirmed the Brucella free status of British pigs by showing that serological reactions observed in these tests were due not to Brucella infection but to infection with Yersinia enterocolitica serotype 0:9. The serological cross-reaction between Yersinia enterocolitica 0:9 and the Brucella A antigen is well known (Ahvonen et al., 1969; Corbel and Cullen, 1970; Mittal and Tizard, 1979a) and Corbel et al. (1984) showed that infection with Y. enterocolitica 0:9 can produce serological reactions to Brucella. Furthermore, studies with monoclonal antibodies have shown that the O-chain of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of these organisms is identical (Bundle et al., 1984; Palmer and Douglas, 1989) . This antigen has been characterized as a polymer of 4,6-dideoxy-4formamido-D-mannopyranosyl residues linked by a 1-2 bonds ( Bundle et al., 1989) . Since Brucella LPS forms the basis for the complement fixation (CFT) and serum agglutination tests (SAT) currently used for the diagnosis of brucellosis, pigs infected with Y. enterocolitica 0:9 will tend to fail these tests. To differentiate between these infections Corbel and Cullen (1970) and Mittal and Tizard (1979b) developed methods to quantify antibodies to the flagellar antigens of Y. enterocolitica 0:9, whilst Schoenerer et al. (1990) developed an enzyme linked immunoassay, using Yersinia plasmid encoded outer membrane proteins, to detect Yersinia infection. The former approach involves laborious absorption procedures, but most importantly neither test specifically detects Brucella infection nor excludes the possibility of dual infection. In addition, cross-reactions caused by other organisms (Corbel et al., 1984) may be wrongly attributed to brucellosis.",

Previous immunoblot and immunoprecipitation studies with sera from B. ovis infected rams (Chin and Pang-Turner, 1990 ) and dogs infected with B. canis (Carmichael et al., 1989) have identified antigens in cytoplasmic extracts of Brucella which may be of diagnostic potential. In this study, sera from pigs infected with B. suis or Y. enterocolitica 0:9 and control animals were examined by immunoblot analysis after sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of whole B. melitensis, to characterize the range of antigens recognized by the humoral response in porcine brucellosis. Lysozyme digests of digestion buffer insoluble material were also examined as Sowa et al. ( 1991 ) have shown the presence of additional group 2 and 3 outer membrane proteins (OMP) in such extracts. A rough strain of Brucella melitensis was used as immunoblot antigen to prevent smearing profiles due to lipopolysaccharide. The use of this antigen is discussed later.",

Although a similar range of antigens was identified by B. suis infected pigs, individual sera rarely identified more than three antigens and, in contrast to the results obtained with infected sheep, there was little consistency in the profiles obtained. This relatively weak serological response in B. suis infected pigs parallels the results obtained in traditional serological tests where the detection of 80-90% of infected pigs is considered optimal (Deyoe, 1987) . For diagnostic use in individual animals a single protein antigen should detect brucellosis, specifically, in a high proportion of pigs. However, to differentiate brucellosis from infection with known cross-reacting organisms (Corbel, 1985) in countries with no B. suis infection a test of lower sensitivity but high specificity, ie a herd test, may be acceptable.",

            "text": "The antigen recognized most frequently by B. suis infected pigs (the 62 kDa protein) was identified by 73% of these animals (Table 1 ). This antigen is distinct from the outer membrane proteins: group 1 (88-94 kDa), group 2 (3840 kDa), group 3 (25-30 kDa) , and the 15 kDa or 8 kDa proteins identified by Dubray and Bezard (1980) and Gomez-Miguel and Moriyon (1986) . Previous studies have shown that serum from B. ovis infected sheep (Chin and Pang-Turner, 1990 ) and B. canis infected dogs (Carmichael et al., 1989) also recognize a significantly immunogenic antigen in the range 63-68 kDa. The experiment reported here with monoclonals to the M. leprae HSP-65 demonstrates that the 62 kDa protein is the Brucella homologue of the mycobacterial antigen. This family of proteins is immunodominant in infections due to Mycobacteria (Thole and Van der Zee, 1990) and Legionella (Sampson et al., 1986; Plikaytis et al., 1987) and the results reported here confirm its immunodominance in porcine brucellosis. In addition, this group of proteins is known to be cross-reactive, demonstrating sequence homology and serological cross-reactions with a wide range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms (Hoiby, 1975; Shinnick et al., 1988; Thole et al., 1988; Waldinger et al., 1988; Sampson et al., 1990) . It is therefore not surprising that the immunodominant 62 kDa protein was also recognized by some sera from pigs infected with Y. enterocolitica 0:9, CFT reactor and CFT negative groups of pigs. Indeed, two Yersinia sera and one serum from the CFT negative group identified the protein strongly. This implies that antibodies are raised to conserved regions of this antigen during infection with other unidentified organisms, and confirms the cross-reactive nature of the HSP-62 in Brucella.",

Yamaguchi et al. (1990) identified an HSP-65 homologue in Yersinia and demonstrated cross-reactivity with a wide range of organisms, although these workers did not examine Brucella. The absence of antibody to the 62 kDa Brucella protein could be due to growth of the Yersinia inocutum under controlled non-stress conditions. This explanation seems unlikely as HSP' s are produced constitutively and account for approximately 1% of the total protein in E. coli grown at 37\u00b0C (Thole and Van der Zee, 1990) . Alternatively, the epitopes recognized by the humoral response to the HSP-65 family during infection may be more specific than the results with cross-reactive monoclonals imply. This may be due to suppression of the response to broadly crossreacting epitopes (Cooper et al., 1984) .

Recent studies would appear to support this since the deduced amino acid sequence of the HSP-65 homologue of B. abortus (Roop et al., 1992) shows regions of variability when compared to other published HSP-65 homologue sequences. Indeed, studies with the mycobacterial HSP-65 have shown an M. leprae specific epitope in the most variable region (amino acids 420-480) (Anderson et al., 1988) , and work with the HSP-60 of Y. enterocolitica has demonstrated an epitope specific for this organism (Yamaguchi et al., 1990) .

To develop a specific test for brucellosis based on this immunodominant antigen the epitopes which confer specificity must be defined. Specificity may be introduced by the use of specific monoclonals in a competition assay. Indeed, Levis et al. (1986) developed a highly specific enzyme-linked immunoassay for lepromatous and borderline lepromatous leprosy patients based on competition with the monoclonal IVD8 for HSP-65. Unfortunately this test detected only 32% of these patients. The use of monoclonals to more immunodominant specific regions, or a panel of specific monoclonals could improve this sensitivity. Therefore, although the Brucella HSP-65 homologue carries crossreacting epitopes, its immunodominance and the potential existence of both genus and species specific epitopes show potential as a candidate for a differential serological test for brucellosis in pigs and other animals. It is essential that fragments of recombinant Brucella HSP-62 or synthetic peptides are evaluated to identify the B-cell epitopes recognized specifically by Brucella infected pigs.",
