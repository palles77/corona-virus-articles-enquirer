            "text": "Background: Previous studies have suggested a role played by respiratory viruses in the exacerbation of cystic fibrosis (CF). However, the impact of respiratory viruses could have been underestimated because of the low detection rate by conventional laboratory methods. Methods: Children with CF had nasal swabs and sputum samples obtained on a routine basis and when they developed respiratory exacerbations. Nucleic Acid Sequence Based Amplification (NASBA) was used to detect respiratory viruses from nasal swabs. The definition of a respiratory exacerbation was when the symptom score totalled to 4 or more, or if the peak expiratory flow fell by more than 50 l/min from the child's usual best value, or if the parent subjectively felt that the child was developing a cold. Results: 71 patients had 165 reported episodes of respiratory exacerbations. 138 exacerbation samples were obtained of which 63 (46%) were positive for respiratory viruses. In contrast, 23 of 136 asymptomatic nasal swabs (16.9%) were positive for respiratory viruses. There was significantly more viruses being detected during respiratory exacerbations, in particular influenza A, influenza B and rhinovirus (p b 0.05).",

This study also showed that viral respiratory exacerbations in CF could be independent from bacterial infections. Conclusions: Respiratory viruses are associated with exacerbations in CF and upper respiratory symptoms are strong predictors for their presence. 'Real-time' NASBA has a rapid turn-around time and has the potential to aid clinical decision making, such as the use of anti-virals and administration of antibiotics.",

            "text": "Life expectancy for Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients has increased dramatically over the last 40 years [1] . However, progressive pulmonary damage with eventual respiratory failure is still the major cause of morbidity and mortality in CF [2] and bacterial infection is generally thought to be the major cause of clinical deterioration [3] . Recently, evidence from literature shows that respiratory viruses lead to pulmonary exacerbation and disease progression [4] [5] [6] [7] and an increase in bacterial adherence to the CF airways [8, 9] from in vitro studies. This results in prolonged hospitalizations [10] of CF patients infected by viruses but their true impact on CF may yet have been underestimated by previous studies for a number of reasons: Firstly, respiratory viruses may trigger bacterial infections [11] [12] [13] and so the presence of bacteria does not necessarily exclude viral infections. Secondly, many previous studies used tissue culture and immunofluorescence techniques which are relatively insensitive methods for viral detection, but these were the techniques used in most published studies in CF [6, 7, 11, 14] .",

The panel of respiratory viruses studied included influenza A, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIV) types 1 to 4, rhinovirus and coronavirus. The sequences of primers and molecular beacons used in 'real-time' NASBA assays are shown in Table 1 . Analysis of results was undertaken using the NucliSens\u00ae Easy Q Analyser (BioM\u00e9rieux Ltd) isothermically at 41\u00b0C and results were available within 120 min. The NASBA assays have been found to be highly sensitive with the Tissue Culture Infective Dose being between 1 to 1 in 10 \u2212 5 virus input (TCID 50 ) and 100 to 0.1 copies of synthetic RNA. The assays are also specific with no background signal detected with a cross-reacting panel including a range of respiratory viruses and a lysis buffer negative control. The cutoff threshold for a positive result was defined as 20% above the negative control wild-type signal [22] .",

Each patient above the age of 5 years was also provided with a mini-Wright Peak Flow Meter and was asked to record their best of three readings every morning and evening. The definition of a respiratory exacerbation was when the symptom score totalled to 4 or more, or if peak expiratory flow fell by more than 50 l/min from the child's usual best value, or if the parent subjectively felt that the child was developing a cold [25] . Under these circumstances, the parents or patients were encouraged to contact the investigators to have a nasal swab taken.",

RSV is a relatively labile virus and the amount of virus in a small-volume nasal swab specimen may be a lot less than that in a sample obtained by aspiration.

Although the CF patients had more respiratory illnesses than sibling controls (3.7 versus 1.7/year), there were no differences in virus identification rates (1.7/year). All their viruses were identified by seroconversions; none were detected by viral cultures. From a total of 1028 (689 acute episodes versus 339 asymptomatic episodes) serum samples, 105 infections (10.2%) were identified. 42 of the 105 infections were identified from asymptomatic periods. Therefore their viral detection rates were 9.1% during acute episodes and 12.3% during asymptomatic episodes, compared to our detection rates of 46% and 18.4%, respectively. Our study also show that rhinoviruses played a major role in exacerbations of CF but in contrast, Wang et al. [7] failed to detect any rhinoviruses.

Therefore, the criteria used in this study to define a respiratory exacerbation are poor predictors of bacterial infection. The introduction of additional antibiotics in these situations may be difficult to decide. In addition, Ramsey et al. [6] have shown that CF patients colonised with S. aureus did not have an increased risk of viral infection and those colonised with P. aeruginosa were protected from viral infections. Hence, the high proportion of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa found in this study may part explain the lack of association between viruses and bacteria.",

Firstly, it is developed specifically for RNA target amplification and is particularly suited for the detection of RNA viruses because there is no need for a separate reverse transcription step, unlike PCR. Secondly, the selection criteria for NASBA primers are less stringent, allowing easier primer design in selected less-conserved regions of the gene [41] . Thirdly, it is a continuous isothermic process that does not require a thermocycler [42, 43] . Hence a constant temperature throughout the amplification reaction allows NASBA to amplify the targeted RNA or DNA exponentially at each step of the reaction. The NASBA reaction is also more efficient than PCR methods that are restricted to binary increases per cycle. Fourthly, background DNA does not interfere with the NASBA reaction, as single-stranded RNA sequences are specifically targeted, unlike PCR where background DNA may cause false positive results [44] . The closed-tube format of NASBA assay greatly reduces the risk of contamination and thus of false positive results. Finally, the detection of PCR products requires gel electrophoresis, which necessitates the transfer of resolved nucleic acid to an agarose gel. This is very labour intensive and time-consuming and is not as well suited for diagnostic use compares to 'real-time' NASBA.",

It may provide guidance to clinicians regarding anti-viral administration, thus avoiding the inappropriate use of antibiotics and further support the importance of patient segregation. At the moment, NASBA largely remains as a research tool and for now, clinicians will have to use a matter of judgement and clinical accruement to diagnose viral infection as many currently available diagnostic tools still take days or weeks to provide definitive results. Hopefully, one day NASBA may become widely available to allow respiratory viral testing to become part of the routine investigation during pulmonary exacerbations of CF. In addition, NASBA may also become a very important screening tool for exacerbations in other respiratory illnesses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and bronchiectasis.",
