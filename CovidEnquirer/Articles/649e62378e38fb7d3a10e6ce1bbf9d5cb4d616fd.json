Both YFP-STIM1 (D76A) and YFP-STIM1 (L74P) transfected cells had increased basal Ca 21 concentrations compared with wild-type YFP-STIM1 and reduced peak and integral responses to CPA-induced SERCA inhibition (see Fig E3, B and C) . However, in contrast to the EF-hand mutant YFP-STIM1 (D76A), YFP-STIM1 (L74P) did not demonstrate reduced SOCE after CPA washout and Ca 21 restoration, suggesting that the previously reported desensitization of SOCE observed with the YFP-STIM1 (D76A) mutant does not occur with the YFP-STIM1 (L74P) mutant form. Therefore the L74P mutation appears to result in a distinct molecular phenotype compared with the loss of function observed in immunodeficient patients and the constitutive activation observed in patients with myopathy.",

Clinical immunologic investigations were consistent with abnormal NK cell and T-lymphocyte function that might be expected to be associated with ongoing clinical immunodeficiency. However, despite severely abnormal SOCE, this was not the case in these patients. Missense mutations affecting the EF-hand can have very different clinical phenotypes with respect to the immune system, muscle, sweating, and enamel formation. This has important implications for clinical evaluation, as well as understanding the biological functions of STIM1.",

The abilities of NECs to take up antigen, express MHC class II and costimulatory molecules, and stimulate antigen-specific activation and proliferation of CD4 1 T cells were investigated by using a human mucosal specimen (see the Methods section in this article's Online Repository at www. jacionline.org).",

Then the ability of MNECs to present the antigen ovalbumin (OVA) to naive T cells was demonstrated. MNECs from sensitized mice displayed an enhanced MHC class II expression on coculture with OT-II T cells compared with naive cells (Fig 1, A) . The total number of OT-II CD4 1 T cells in the same cocultures was increased. A tendency toward an increase in CD4 1 T-cell counts was also seen when sensitized T cells were used as reporter cells (Fig 1, B) . Analysis of T-cell activation revealed a pronounced increase in the total number (see Fig E3, A, in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org) and fraction (Fig 1, C) of activated CD69 1 OT-II cells, as well as sensitized T cells, when using sensitized MNECs as APCs. Notably, sensitized MNECs exhibited significantly increased activating capacity, even without added OVA, which was supposedly partially due to the remaining OVA in the MNECs from the sensitization process. In line with this, MNECs from sensitized mice augmented the absolute number (see Fig E3, B) and fraction (Fig 1, D) of CD44 1 OT-II cells, as well as sensitized T cells, in a dose-dependent manner. A tendency toward an increased IFN-g release was simultaneously seen when sensitized MNECs were used as APCs (Fig 1, E) . Finally, sensitized MNECs were unable to affect the (Fig 1, C) and CD44 1 /CD4 1 (Fig 1, D) T cells after coculture with OVA-stimulated MNECs. E, INF-g release in cocultures (24 hours).

Thus activation of T-cell receptor (TCR) transgenic OT-II T cells by OVA requires antigen processing. The marked activation and proliferation of OT-II CD4 1 T cells when cocultured with OVA-stimulated MNECs from sensitized animals demonstrates the antigen-processing and antigen-presenting capacity of MNECs. An experiment in which splenic cells from sensitized animals containing OVA-specific CD4 1 T cells were cocultured in the same manner was used to mimic a more natural process. This resulted in a T-cell response with IFN-g release, demonstrating the T cell-activating capacity of NECs.",

This could not be addressed in a human setting. HNECs from sensitized patients with AR demonstrated an allergenspecific increased capacity to activate CD4 1 autologous T cells, further corroborating the mouse data (Fig 2) . This recall response, which was dependent on the presence of memory T cells, was likely to result in a T H 2 response reflected in the detection of IL-13 (Fig 2, E) .",

            "text": "Professional APCs are believed to mainly present and activate T cells in the lymph nodes. NECs are local, and their numbers in the mucosa far outnumber those of local dendritic cells, making their ability to present allergen and activate T cells an important asset in the first line of defense (Fig 2, F and G) . Increased expression of MHC class II in murine type II alveolar ECs has been demonstrated after Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, further supporting the importance of NECs in the microbial response. 5 Several viruses, such as human coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome, have evolved mechanisms to inhibit MHC class II pathways in ECs. 6 Bet v 1 pollen allergen has further been demonstrated to bind and enter ECs within minutes after exposure in patients with AR, even during the nonsymptomatic winter season. 7 In summary, for the first time, we have demonstrated the role of antigen-presenting NECs in patients with allergic airway disease. Previous information in the field is scarce, even though it has been shown that intestinal ECs can stimulate CD4 1 T cells in vitro to proliferate and secrete cytokines. 1 Furthermore, the importance of a local rapid response that enables antigen presentation and CD4 1 T-cell activation was recently demonstrated in an mouse inflammatory bowel disease model in which MHC class II-deficient mice were unable to induce and reinstate tolerance when fed with Helicobacter hepaticus and IL-10 receptor-blocking antibodies. 8 We demonstrated that MHC class II in NECs can be loaded with exogenous antigens (Fig 2, A and B , and see Video E1), that NECs stimulate allergen-specific CD4 1 T-cell responses in mice and human subjects (Figs 1 and 2), and that HNECs from patients with AR can amplify the allergic response contributing to the ongoing allergic CD4 1 T cell-mediated inflammation, with the latter likely contributing to the high number of activated CD4 1 T cells found in nasal mucosa of patients with AR. 9 Hence this is the first time that local immune activity within the nasal mucosa has been directly linked to a rapid and efficient allergen-induced T-cell activation.",

E5 Cells were fixed for 15 minutes in 4% formaldehyde, washed with PBS, and subsequently incubated with 10% normal donkey serum for 30 minutes to block nonspecific binding.

Stained cells were maintained in ProLong Gold antifade reagent with 49-6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI; Invitrogen). For laser confocal microscopy, a Nikon Eclipse TE 300 microscope (PerkinElmer, Waltham, Mass) equipped with a solid-state laser (blue, 405 nm; green, 488 nm; and red, 568 nm) and connected to a Hamamatsu ORCA ER camera (Hammamatsu, Hammamatsu City, Japan) was used.

In brief, specific antibodies labeled with spectrally encoded beads were applied to the samples and standards. After incubation, the beads were washed and mixed with specific biotinylated detector antibodies. Subsequently, excess biotinylated antibodies were removed by using a washing step, followed by addition of streptavidin-R-phycoerythrin to conjugate and label the detector antibodies. By monitoring the spectral properties of the beads and the amount of associated streptavidin-R-phycoerythrin fluorescence with the Bio-Plex System (Bio-Rad Laboratories), cytokine concentrations could be determined. The minimum detectable concentration was 0.12 pg/mL (IL-13) and 0.31 pg/mL (IL-5).",
