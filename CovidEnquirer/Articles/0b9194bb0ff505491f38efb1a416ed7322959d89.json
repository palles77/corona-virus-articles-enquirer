At 4 d of age, 112 calves had accelerometers attached to their hind leg and were housed in pens with ACFS. Calves were examined daily for signs of illness or injury. Of the 112 calves monitored, 18 were diagnosed with NCD; activities of calves with NCD were then compared with those of 18 healthy controls (calves that had no symptoms of NCD, other illnesses, or injury). Feeding (milk consumption and the number of rewarded and unrewarded visits to the feeder) and lying behavior during the 5 d leading up to calves displaying clinical signs of NCD were analyzed. Calves with NCD performed fewer unrewarded visits and consumed less milk than healthy calves during the 2-and 4-d periods before diagnosis with NCD, respectively. Calves with NCD tended to perform fewer lying bouts than healthy calves over the 5-d period before diagnosis with NCD. At 3 wk of age, a subset of 51 healthy calves were allocated to 1 of 5 treatment groups: (1) sham handling (SHAM, n = 10), (2) cautery disbudding (DB, n = 11), (3) administration of local anesthetic (LA) and DB (LA+DB, n = 11), 4) administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and DB (NSAID+DB, n = 9), and (5) administration of LA, NSAID and DB (LA+NSAID+DB, n = 10). Feeding and lying behavior were recorded continuously for 24 h pre-and postdisbudding. We found no effect of treatment on the number of rewarded or unrewarded visits to the feeder and milk volume consumed 24 h before administration of treatments. During the 24-h postdisbudding period, SHAM calves performed more unrewarded visits than DB, LA+DB, and NSAID+DB calves, but the number of unrewarded visits did not differ between SHAM and LA+NSAID+DB calves. During the first hour of the posttreatment period we noted a difference in lying times among treatments, with DB and NSAID+DB calves spending less time lying than SHAM calves and lying times being similar between SHAM, LA+DB, and LA+NSAID+DB calves. The ACFS and accelerometers have the potential to automatically gather valuable information regarding health status and pain in calves. Therefore, it may be advantageous to combine both of these measures (ACFS and accelerometers) when evaluating NCD on farm or pain in calves in future research.",

Once an animal displays clinical signs of NCD, much of the associated tissue damage to the intestinal submuscosa has already 8209 occurred (Schroeder et al., 2012) ; therefore, early detection of NCD would enable calves to be promptly treated and moved to sick pens thereby reducing tissue damage and risk of disease transmission to other calves. Previous studies using ACFS and accelerometers have reported changes in feeding (Svensson and Jensen, 2007; Borderas et al., 2009; Lowe et al., 2016) and lying behavior (Swartz et al., 2017) in response to NCD and respiratory disease. However, those studies predominantly focused on changes in behavior once calves became clinically ill or the time period just prior (Svensson and Jensen, 2007; Borderas et al., 2009) , or calves that were diagnosed with respiratory disease (Swartz et al., 2017) . To our knowledge, no studies have measured changes in feeding in conjunction with lying behavior in calves before diagnosis with NCD. It would be valuable to measure changes in feeding and lying behavior concurrently, several days before calves become clinically ill, to assess if information collected from ACFS and accelerometers could be used for early detection of NCD on-farm.",

Disbudding is often performed without pain relief; however, studies have shown that this procedure causes behavioral changes indicative of pain (reviewed by Stafford and Mellor, 2011) . For example, calves spent less time feeding and more time lying after being cautery disbudded than sham-handled controls (Graf and Senn, 1999; Faulkner and Weary, 2000) . Therefore, a need exists to evaluate different pain-mitigation strategies to alleviate the pain caused by disbudding; to do this, however, laborintensive behavioral studies are often needed. It would be useful if automated measures of feeding and lying behavior were sensitive enough to detect behavioral changes in calves in response to a painful procedure such as disbudding. Automated measures of feeding and lying behavior could then be used as a research tool to evaluate different pain-mitigation strategies for painful husbandry procedures in calves.",

A standard operating procedure developed in conjunction with a veterinarian was used. Health checks assessed calves for the presence of diarrhea, high rectal temperatures (39.5\u00b0C or higher), signs of dehydration (sunken eyes, or poor skin elasticity-assessed using the skin tent test), coat condition (shiny and smooth vs. dry and rough), position of the ears (erect vs. droopy), gut fill (full vs. empty stomachs), signs of navel ill (inflammation, swelling, or discharge from the navel), nasal or ocular discharge, swelling, abscesses, and injury. Trained staff were also asked to comment if calves were coughing, had crackly breaths, or were breathing fast. In the present study, calves were diagnosed as having NCD when they presented with diarrhea and high rectal temperatures (39.5\u00b0C or higher). A calf was considered to have diarrhea if it was observed passing feces with a loose to watery consistency and strong odor. For calves suspected of having diarrhea due to the presence of loose fecal matter on the top of the tail or hind legs, a fecal sample was taken to evaluate fecal consistency and to confirm whether or not that particular calf was diarrheic. Only data collected from calves diagnosed as having NCD were considered as sick calves for further analysis. Once calves exhibited signs of NCD, blood and fecal samples were collected for analysis to verify etiology of the disease. It is possible that any of the calves could have been experiencing subclinical disease during the course of the study, but it was beyond the scope of this study to test all animals for the presence of subclinical diseases; hence, animals were categorized as sick or healthy based on clinical signs of illness only. Calf BW was recorded weekly.",

Inc.). The residuals from the log-transformed mixed model analysis showed good consistency with the normality assumptions of the model. For the calf health component of our study, data from calves that were identified with NCD were used (see description above). Each calf with NCD was matched with a healthy control from the same pen taking into account sex, breed, birth date, and birth weight. Healthy controls never presented with any symptoms of NCD or other signs of illness or injury during the study period. Day 0 was the day that calves showed signs of NCD and the equivalent day was used for d 0 for control calves. We were interested in behavioral changes leading up to signs of NCD; therefore, we focused on the 5 d before appearance of NCD. Milk consumption, blood chemistry and hematology data were log-transformed to meet the assumptions of the analysis. Milk consumption and lying (lying times and frequency of lying bouts) behavior data were analyzed using the mixed model procedure of SAS. The model included the fixed effects of treatment (health status: NCD and healthy), day, treatment by day interaction, and the random effects of pen and calf.

Similarly, Svensson and Jensen (2007) found that the number of unrewarded visits was a more sensitive measure of sickness in calves than the number of rewarded visits. Borderas et al. (2009) suggested that the effect of disease on feeding behavior would vary according to feeding motivation, as milk intake and frequency of visits to the feeder were more dramatically decreased in sick calves being fed a high (ad libitum or 12 L/d) rather than a low (4 L/d) milk allowance. In the present study, calves received a milk allowance of 6 L/d, which is closer to the low than the high milk allowance provided in the Borderas et al. (2009) study; hence, more dramatic changes in feeding behavior may have been observed if a higher milk allowance was provided to calves in the present study. Therefore, milk allowance fed to calves needs to be taken into consideration when using behavioral data from ACFS as an indication of NCD in calves.",

However, on the day calves were diagnosed as having NCD in the present study their lying times were reduced.

This difference was predominantly due to the number of unrewarded visits as disbudding treatment did not affect the number of rewarded visits. Calves experiencing the SHAM treatment performed more unrewarded visits during the 24-h posttreatment period than DB, LA+DB, and NSAID+DB calves. The greater number of unrewarded visits suggests that even though there was no difference in the amount of milk consumed among treatments, calves that were not disbudded were more motivated to visit the ACFS than calves disbudded with LA or NSAID or without pain relief. Fewer unrewarded visits to the ACFS by disbudded calves could reflect a lack of appetite in these animals due to the pain or distress caused by disbudding. Indeed, calves spent less time feeding after cautery disbudding (Graf and Senn, 1999) and amputation dehorning (Sutherland et al., 2013) . It is also possible that disbudding caused the calves in the present study to become head shy and, hence, more hesitant to place their heads in the ACFS due to the potential risk of knocking their head in the confined space. Another possibility is that experiencing a painful husbandry procedure caused a change in the emotional state of the animals, which may in turn have affected their motivation to feed (Neave et al., 2013) . Interestingly, calves given local anesthetic and an NSAID before disbudding in the present study per-formed a similar number of unrewarded visits as SHAM calves, which suggests that the combination of LA and an NSAID was the most effective pain-mitigation strategy evaluated in the present study. These results are in accordance with previous studies showing that the physiological and behavioral response to disbudding is markedly reduced when calves are given a combination of LA and an NSAID before disbudding Heinrich et al., 2010) .",

Therefore, it is possible that if milk consumption had been recorded for a longer period of time in the present study, treatment differences may have been detected. Furthermore, milk allowance is an important factor to consider when using total milk consumption as an indicator of stress (e.g., pain or disease). Borderas et al. (2009) found that sick calves consumed less milk at an ACFS when provided with a high milk allowance in comparison to healthy calves, but total milk consumption was not affected when they were provided with a low milk allowance. Calves provided only a low milk allowance are more likely to be motivated to feed. In the present study, calves were given access to 6 L/d, whereas calves given ad libitum access to milk will drink up to 10 kg/d (Jasper and Weary, 2002) . Therefore, providing calves with a higher milk allowance is likely to increase the sensitivity of feeding behavior as a measure of stress (e.g., pain and disease) in calves.",

Moreover, calves given only an NSAID before disbudding showed similar lying times to calves disbudded without pain relief, which corresponds to the mechanism of action of NSAID; giving an NSAID (e.g., ketoprofen) reduces the inflammation-related pain associated with amputation dehorning in cattle, but not the initial pain caused by dehorning (McMeekan et al., 1998) .These results suggest that lying behavior mea-sured using accelerometer data loggers maybe sensitive enough to assess pain in calves in response to an acute painful procedure such as cautery disbudding.",
