Although specific attention is focused on these tissues in inhalation studies, treatment-related effects sometimes occur in the nose following exposure to chemicals administered by other routes, such as gavage dosing. Because of the varied anatomic features of the nasal passages and the encasement of the nose within the bones of the maxilla, special attention to collection, fixation, trimming, and sectioning is required to obtain uniform sections. Optimal decalcification, rinsing, and processing are critical for obtaining well-stained sections of the nose for histopathological evaluation. Anatomical landmarks for trimming and careful embedding must be used to consistently obtain the desired sections. These landmarks are illustrated and described in Section 2. Typically, three or four levels of the nose, three levels of the larynx, and one section of the trachea are examined. This chapter provides a brief outline of the morphology of the nose, larynx, and trachea and descriptions of spontaneous and treatment related lesions observed in these tissues in toxicity and carcinogenicity studies.",

Proliferation of the mesenchyme at the margins of the placode produces a depression (the nasal pit), which deepens to form the primary nasal cavity. The first microvilli on respiratory epithelium appear around day 14, and by day 18, cilia are evident. The olfactory epithelium develops from ectoderm of the olfactory placode in the roof of the nasal passages. Primitive neuroepithelial cells become neuroblasts and then esthesioneurocytes, which are thought to differentiate into sustentacular cells and olfactory neurons. By day 18 of gestation, the olfactory epithelium exhibits clear differentiation of sensory and sustentacular cells and resembles that in the adult rat.",

The endoderm lining the laryngotracheal tube gives rise to the epithelium and glands of the larynx and trachea. Cilia develop in tracheal epithelial cells approximately 2 days later than in the nasal cavity, and secretory cells appear on days 19\u00c020.

The nasal passages consist of two major compartments separated by a septum with three well-developed sets of turbinates, the nasoturbinates, maxilloturbinates, and ethmoid turbinates (Figure 22 .1), that project into the lumen of each compartment (Harkema et al., 2006) . The septal window in the caudoventral portion of the nasal cavity provides a direct connection between the left and right nasal passages and the nasopharyngeal duct. The septal window is the point of convergence for both air and mucus streams. There are four main routes for inspiratory airflow through the dorsal, middle, ventral, and lateral meatuses (Figure 22 .1) (Morgan et al., 1989) . Nasal airflow pattern is one of numerous factors influencing the distribution of nasal lesions in toxicology studies (Morgan and Monticello, 1990) . The lateral meatus has a characteristic medially curved profile ventrally and a curved lateral recess dorsally, which reflect its anatomical association with the roots of the incisor teeth.",

Nasal lesions tend to be site specific due to airflow, regional deposition of inhaled toxicants and chemicals, and regional tissue sensitivity or susceptibility to these agents (Morgan and Monticello, 1990) . In toxicologic studies, it is essential to sample and evaluate the nasal cavity in relation to the regional differences. Three sections are routinely examined microscopically in studies sponsored by the National Toxicology Program. However, modifications in the number of levels sectioned may be necessary, depending on the degree of detail needed for a particular study (Mery et al., 1994) . Specific palatal landmarks are used to obtain the necessary sections ( Figure 22 .2). Level I is trimmed immediately posterior to the upper incisor teeth; Level II, through the level of the incisive papilla anterior to the first palatial ridge; Level III, through the middle of the second molar teeth. Using these landmarks, some variation will still be observed. A difference of millimeters at a particular level will alter the amount and shape of nasoturbinates and teeth, the location of ducts and accessory glands, and the types of epithelium in the section.",

These cell types are unevenly distributed along the mucosal surface and rest on a basal lamina of reticular and collagen fibrils (Figure 22 .6). The epithelium has a wide range of site-specific characteristics, including differences in epithelial height, density of ciliated cells and goblet cells, and enzyme activity. Along the nasal septum, the respiratory epithelial cells are evenly distributed from proximal to caudal sites; the epithelium is highly ciliated, and contains numerous goblet cells (Figure 22 .7). In contrast, the epithelium lining the lateral meatuses and tips of the turbinates (transitional epithelium) is nonciliated, sparsely ciliated, or have short microvilli (Figure 22 .8).",

The sensory neurons are bipolar, and interposed between the sustentacular cells. The nuclei and perikaryon of the olfactory neurons are in the middle third of the epithelial layer. An apical dendritic process extends above the surface of each epithelial cell to form a bulbous swelling, the olfactory vesicle. The olfactory vesicle has 10\u00c015 basal bodies that give rise to long, nonmotile, sensory cilia that are approximately 50 microns in length and 0.1\u00c00.3 microns in diameter (Harkema et al., 2006; Jenkins et al., 2009; Menco, 1997; Naguro and Iwashita, 1992) . These cilia intertwine with each other and with surface microvilli to provide an extensive surface area for reception of odorants. An axon originates from the base of each olfactory neuron and passes through the basal lamina to join axons from adjacent neuronal cells to form nonmyelinated nerve fascicles and bundles in the lamina propria.

Mucus in the anteriodorsal portion of the nose of the rat flows as a counter-current system with respect to the inspired air. The counter-current exchange system maintains a concentration gradient between the two fluids in order to maximize movement from one fluid to the other. The complex mucus streams converge on the nasopharyngeal duct to pass into the pharynx and are subsequently swallowed along with any trapped materials. In addition to clearing particulate material from the upper respiratory tract, as the medium in which olfactory molecules are dissolved, mucus prevents excessive transudation of fluid from tissues into the lumen and inward osmotic passage of water condensed on the surface during expiration, and facilitates the sense of smell.",

There are specialized organs in the nasal cavity concerned with olfaction including the olfactory neuroepithelium, vomeronasal organ, septal olfactory organ, and olfactory nerves (fila olfactoria). The septal olfactory organ is a functioning part of the chemosensory system and primarily has an alerting function, providing information relevant to odor stimulus assessment. The vomeronasal organ may also play an important role in the sucking reflex in the young and reproduction in the adult through recognition of pheromones and affecting release of hormones from the pituitary. Unlike the respiratory epithelium, the olfactory epithelium has high levels of cytochrome P-450 enzymes, which are considered important in metabolism and removal of odorants. The high metabolic capacity of submucosal glands may contribute to the development of some chemically induced lesions in the olfactory epithelium. Submucosal glands of the maxillary sinus also have extensive metabolic capacity and are specific target cells for some chemicals that require metabolism to proximate carcinogens.",

The extrinsic laryngeal muscles position and stabilize the larynx. The intrinsic muscles regulate tension in the vocal folds, and open and close the entrance to the trachea. During inspiration, the epiglottis is closely opposed to the soft palate, leaving the entrance to the larynx open. As air passes through the larynx, the vocal folds vibrate producing sound waves.

As a spontaneous change, hyaline droplet accumulation is particularly common at the junction of respiratory and olfactory epithelia, but frequently occurs at several sites or throughout the nasal mucosa (especially ventrally) with inhalation exposure to a variety of compounds and chemicals. The significance of exposurerelated exacerbation of this change in inhalation studies is uncertain, but is thought to be a nonspecific, adaptive or protective response to chronic inhalation exposure to chemical irritants and frequently accompanies epithelial hyperplasia.

These lesions are infrequently observed in untreated control rats or rats raised under barrier conditions, and if observed, are most likely associated with physical (foreign bodies) or infectious (bacterial or fungal) agents. Necrosis of the respiratory and glandular epithelia (Figure 22 .20) may occur with or without exfoliation; it may result in erosion or ulceration. Necrosis may extend to the turbinate bone when severe. Erosions are characterized by exfoliation of the superficial epithelium only (Figure 22 .21). Ulceration is characterized by complete loss of the epithelium and basement membrane with Repeated or prolonged damage to the respiratory epithelium may result in reparative, proliferative, or adaptive changes. During the early reparative response, the adjacent undamaged epithelium rapidly proliferates and migrates to form a thin cell layer to partially or completely cover the affected area. The lost or damaged epithelium may be replaced by a single layer of flattened to low cuboidal regenerating cells (Figure 22 .23) or, in cases of continued injury, with two or more layers of seemingly undifferentiated polyhedral cells. These foci of regenerating cells may progress to squamous metaplasia with persistent or repeated injury (Figure 22 .24). In mild cases of squamous metaplasia, the cells are nonkeratinized and may be difficult to distinguish from undifferentiated regenerating cells. More advanced squamous metaplasia is characterized by three or more layers of well-differentiated squamous epithelial cells with relatively prominent cell boundaries, intercellular bridges, and moderately abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm; some advanced lesions may have variable amounts of keratinization.",

Exposure to highly irritant agents may elicit an early suppurative response, which may persist. With suppurative inflammation, there are considerably more neutrophils, many of which are degenerate. Cellular debris from damaged tissue and degenerate and dead neutrophils, fibrin and protein exudation may be evident. Chronic inflammation signifies a persistent response to injury. There may be a predominance of mononuclear inflammatory cells (macrophages, lymphocytes mostly), with fewer neutrophils, as the response to injury progresses. Evidence of tissue destruction may still be evident, as are attempts at healing, including proliferation of connective tissue (fibrosis) and endothelial cells (neovascularization). Prolonged severe, necrotizing injury with inability of the tissue to repair may elicit chronic active inflammation in which macrophages are still the predominant cell type; however, neutrophils still comprise a large proportion of the inflammatory cells. Granulomatous inflammation occurs in response to inhaled foreign bodies, some infectious agents, or exposure to inhaled agents that are resistant to degradation and clearance. The inflammatory cell infiltrate is predominantly activated macrophages, some of which are epithelioid and multinucleated, accompanied by lymphocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils.

The growth features and morphological appearance are similar to those of squamous cell carcinomas at other sites. These neoplasms may be welldifferentiated or poorly differentiated, and are usually highly invasive; they may efface the surrounding nasal tissue and bones (Figure 22 .51). On occasion, they may extend dorsally to invade the brain. Well-differentiated squamous cell carcinomas generally consist of mature, keratinized squamous epithelium that may or may not have distinct intercellular bridges (Figure 22 .51). Maturation of the cells within the neoplastic epithelium is dysplastic and disorganized. Poorly-differentiated squamous cell carcinomas will generally have marked cellular and nuclear pleomorphism and atypia, increased numbers of abnormal mitotic figures, and the cells lack intercellular bridges. Both histologic types (well-differentiated and poorly differentiated) often contain variable amounts of fibrous tissue. b. Hyperplasia and Hyperplasia with Atypia (Atypical Hyperplasia, Basal Cell Hyperplasia, Dysplasia) Hyperplasia of the transitional respiratory epithelium lining the lateral walls and lateral aspects of the naso-and maxilloturbinates has a slightly different appearance. In response to injury, 3 or more cell layers of flat epithelial cells, that in some areas may appear squamoidsquamous, replace the normal 1-2 layers of cuboidal, pseudostratified epithelium in these sites (Figure 22 .52). Under these conditions, the transitional Olfactory epithelial hyperplasia must be distinguished from respiratory epithelial metaplasia in the olfactory epithelium which is a common adaptive response to injury following inhalation of toxicants. This lesion is also occasionally observed in aged rats as a focal spontaneous change. Respiratory epithelial metaplasia is restricted to the olfactory epithelium of the dorsal meatuses of the Level II section and the ethmoid turbinates, and is characterized by replacement of the olfactory epithelial cells by tall columnar epithelial cells that are morphologically similar to those of the nasal respiratory epithelium (Figure 22.35) .",

Mucociliary function is a sensitive indicator of nasal toxicity; treatment-induced upper airway lesions may be associated with areas of ciliostasis. Local cellular susceptibility may result from cell-specific metabolism. The transitional, respiratory and olfactory epithelia possess cytochrome P-450 and other metabolic and biotransformational enzyme systems that are important for metabolism and detoxification of inhaled toxicants. Cytochrome P-450 enzymes are present at higher levels in the olfactory epithelium than in the transitional and respiratory epithelia.

Ulceration may be severe on the tips of the more anterior turbinates, resulting in severe degeneration, necrosis or even loss of these structures.

In both epithelial types, the degree of irritation, sensitivity of the mucosa to the irritant, and integrity of the mucociliary apparatus generally determine the course of the toxic response to inhaled chemicals and particles. The transitional epithelium may be especially sensitive. The increased sensitivity may be due in part to its anterior location in the nasal passage, to the thinner mucous blanket covering this epithelium, or to the paucity of ciliated cells in this region, which results in a more slowly moving mucous blanket. Exposure to irritants such as ozone will cause proliferative and metaplastic responses in the transitional epithelium at concentrations that have little effect on the squamous, respiratory, or olfactory epithelia. The lesions may be superficial, or involve the full thickness of the epithelium extending to the lamina propria. If the irritant is relatively mild and the exposure is of short duration, goblet cell metaplasia and mucous secretion may be the only response. A purely serous inflammation is often seen in the nasal cavity in response to mild irritants; microscopically, the serous exudate contains few or no inflammatory cells. Highly irritant chemicals will elicit a more varied and extensive response in the epithelium and associated glands. This may include epithelial cell vacuolation and loss of cilia, or more severe forms of degeneration, inflammation, epithelial necrosis and ulceration, and necrosis, atrophy, or hyperostosis of the turbinates. During the reparative response, a single layer of flattened regenerating cells or, with continued injury, two or more layers of undifferentiated polyhedral cells, may replace the ciliated and secretory cells. These lesions may progress to hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia and hyperkeratosis, with persistent injury. Hyperplasia, particularly when atypical, may be an indication of incipient neoplasia.

Regeneration follows and may be accompanied by epithelial and basal cell hyperplasia and, frequently, respiratory epithelial and squamous metaplasia. These epithelial responses may involve the submucosal (Bowman's) glands. These glands are often a prime target because the P-450 metabolizing enzyme content in these cells may produce metabolites that are toxic to the glandular epithelium. Atrophy and/or loss of the nerve bundles in the lamina propria is a common finding. The regenerative or hyperplastic epithelium is often quite disorganized, which may simply be due to a lack of structural support normally maintained by the sustentacular cells. Respiratory epithelial metaplasia is a unique but common response to irritants. In addition to the epithelium of the ethmoid turbinates, this change is often found in the olfactory epithelium that lines the dorsal meatus in the Level II section of the nasal cavity.

Formaldehyde targets the respiratory epithelium causing dose dependent epithelial degeneration, respiratory cell hypertrophy, squamous metaplasia, cell proliferation and nasal tumors in the rat (Monticello et al., 1996) . The toxic effects of endogenous and exogenous formaldehyde on the nasal cavity have been reported (Schroeter et al., 2014) . At 2 ppm formaldehyde, pathways associated with cellular stress, thiol transport/ reduction, inflammation and cellular proliferation were upregulated, whereas, at 6 ppm and greater, pathways associated with cell cycle, DNA repair and apoptosis, ERBB, EGFR, WNT, TGF-beta, Hedgehog and Notch signaling were enriched. Formaldehyde exposure also altered miRNA expression in the nose (Andersen et al., 2010) . Based on gene expression and toxicokinetic data, along with histological examination for cell proliferation, the authors suggested that there are dose/duration transitions for the formaldehyde-induced toxicity and carcinogenicity in the nasal tissues.",

One of the major challenges for immunolocalization of the proteins in nasal epithelium is the tissue processing. The typical decalcification processes using either 5\u00c010% formic acid or 10% hydrogen chloride may degrade the native protein structure within the nasal epithelium, and immunohistochemical localization of proteins in these decalcified tissues is typically not successful. Gentler decalcification methods such as 14% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) at pH 7\u00c07.6 for 2\u00c03 weeks, RapidCal \u00c1 Immuno (BBC biochemical, Mount Vernon, WA) for 2 h, or Immunocal (Decal Chemical Corporation, Congers, NY) for 6 days are preferred for rat nasal immunohistochemical studies. In spite of these gentler decalcification processes, independent optimization of the immunohistochemical parameters is still often necessary for successful localization of proteins in nasal tissues (Harris et al., 2013) . Alternatively, dissection of the respective nasal epithelium from various regions allows for direct measurement of the CYP enzymes and metabolic intermediates of nasal toxins (Dunston et al., 2013) .",

Naphthalene is metabolized within the nasal epithelium by CYP enzymes to an unstable 1,2-epoxide that undergoes further epoxidation and/or glutathione conjugation. Upon saturation of the CYP metabolic pathway, tissue injury occurs. Parenteral administration of naphthalene causes diffuse cytotoxicity of the nasal olfactory mucosa whereas with inhalation exposure, tissue injury is confined to dorsal medial meatus. Measuring the CYP enzymes and naphthalene metabolites within the nasal epithelium from the dorsal medial meatus and the ethmoturbinates from the distal regions demonstrated that the differential susceptibility of parenteral versus inhalation exposure was due to the differences in extent of naphthalene distribution within the tissues (Lee et al., 2005) .",
