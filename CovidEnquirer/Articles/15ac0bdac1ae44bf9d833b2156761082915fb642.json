In December 2015, the NxTAG respiratory pathogen panel (NxTAG RPP) was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration. We compared the clinical performance of this new assay with that of the xTAG respiratory viral panel (xTAG RVP) FAST v2 using 142 clinical samples and 12 external quality assessment samples. Discordant results were resolved by using a laboratory-developed respiratory viral panel. The NxTAG RPP achieved 100% concordant negative results and 86.6% concordant positive results. It detected one coronavirus 229E and eight influenza A/H3N2 viruses that were missed by the xTAG RVP FAST v2. On the other hand, the NxTAG RPP missed one enterovirus/rhinovirus and one metapneumovirus that were detected by FAST v2. Both panels correctly identified all the pathogens in the 12 external quality assessment samples. Overall, the NxTAG RPP demonstrated good diagnostic performance. Of note, it was better able to subtype the influenza A/H3N2 viruses compared with the xTAG RVP FAST v2.

Both the NxTAG RPP and xTAG RVP FAST v2 have the same number of viral targets, including influenza A virus (A/H3N2, A/H1N1, and A/H1N1/2009 strains), influenza B virus, parainfluenza virus types 1 to 4 (PIV 1-4), enterovirus/rhinovirus, coronaviruses (OC43, NL63, 229E, and HKU1), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B, metapneumovirus, adenovirus, and bocavirus. The NxTAG RPP has two additional atypical bacterial targets, namely Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. Recent studies have compared the performance of the new NxTAG RPP with that of other respiratory panels such as the BioFire FilmArray RVP [3, 4] , RespiFinder-22 [5] , Anyplex II RV16 [6] , and xTAG RVP FAST v2 [7] . Overall, these reports demonstrated that the NxTAG RPP is at least comparable to, if not better than, some of the comparators. Here, we assessed the clinical performance of the This study was approved by the local institutional ethics board (National Healthcare Group Domain-Specific Review Board A, reference: 2016/00044) and was performed between May and December 2015. Here, 142 de-identified clinical respiratory samples submitted to the Molecular Diagnosis Centre of the Singapore National University Hospital were included (see Table 1 for the list of viral pathogens included). Additionally, 12 external quality assessment (EQA) samples from the College of American Pathologists (CAP) infectious disease respiratory panel, received in year 2015, were tested ( Table 2) .

In brief, the extracted nucleic acid (10 \u00b5L) was used for target amplification by multiplex reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). The PCR product (2 \u00b5L) was hybridized to a bead mix; next, reporter dye was added in a new reaction vessel, which was sealed and incubated. The amplification and hybridization/incubation were performed on the Applied Biosystems Veriti thermal cycler (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wohlen, Switzerland), as per the manufacturer's recommendations. Signal acquisition was performed on the MAGPIX instrument (Luminex Corp). After testing, the extracted nucleic acids were immediately frozen at -80\u00b0C until further testing. Residual frozen archival samples were retrieved and tested with the NxTAG RPP, a closed-tube nucleic acid assay containing premixed lyophilized reagents for target amplification, PCR product hybridization/incubation, and detection. All procedures were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. The extracted nucleic acid (35 \u00b5L) was added to resuspend the preplated lyophilized bead reagents in the vessel.

Notably, the seasonal influenza A/H1N1 virus was not detected in our local population, and was not included in this study. This strain appears to have been completely replaced by the pandemic influenza A/ H1N1/2009 virus since 2009/2010 [8] . Overall, both assays showed comparable sensitivity and specificity for all viral targets, except for the influenza A/H3N2 virus. Notably, the xTAG RVP FAST v2 showed poor performance in influenza A/H3N2 subtyping, which may be due to primer mismatches. To the best of our knowledge, only one study has compared the performance of the NxTAG RPP with that of the xTAG RVP FAST v2; however, missed detection of influenza A/H3N2 was not reported [7] . It is unclear whether the missed detection by the xTAG RVP FAST v2 was related to the variant H3N2 virus reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta) recently [9, 10] . Nonetheless, the inability to simultaneously detect and subtype these H3N2 viruses is a major hindrance for clinical laboratories to return test results within established turn-around-time. The influenza A/H3N2 virus is a clinically significant respiratory pathogen. Therefore, the ability to rapidly provide subtype information is important during an outbreak or in epidemiologic investigations. By contrast, the influenza A/H3N2 primers in the NxTAG RPP have been updated to detect these untypable strains. Our study suggests that existing xTAG RVP FAST v2 users should switch to the NxTAG RPP, which has better sensitivity for influenza A/H3N2, without a significant drop in sensitivity for the other respiratory viral targets.",

However, the inability of both Luminex assays to distinguish enterovirus from rhinovirus infections in patients lowers their overall clinical utility. This distinction is clinically important, particularly for septic workups in neonates and other vulnerable/immunocompromised patients, as enteroviruses can disseminate to cause systemic infection and involve multiple organs, whereas rhinoviruses generally do not [11] . The RVP assay can detect multiple viral targets simultaneously. Our study revealed nine cases of co-infections.

Such low detection rates of these viruses have been observed elsewhere [12, 13] . Additionally, we were unable to evaluate the performance of the bacterial panel in the NxTAG RPP, as the additional bacterial targets were not detectable by the xTAG RVP FAST v2 or the laboratory-developed RVP. Furthermore, we detected only a single case of M. pneumoniae with the NxTAG RPP.",

However, the need to manipulate post-amplification products presents an inherent risk for laboratory contamination. Moreover, the need to remove the seal from the vessel during the detection presents another potential source of sample cross-contamination, leading to false-positives. Besides cross-contamination, high background noise (Fig. 1) is another source of false-positives, which is commonly associated with the Luminex bead-based suspension array technology due to suboptimal hybridization conditions involving temperature divergences or operator variations. In contrast, the NxTAG RPP is a closed-tube, one-step system, which abolishes the need for post-amplification product manipulation and removal of the seal. The hands-on time is significantly reduced with the simplified workflow, alleviating process variations and giving a turnaround time of < 4 hr for 48 samples. Overall, the streamlined workflow minimizes cross-contamination and background noise. However, initially, where the extracted nucleic acid is used to resuspend the preplated lyophilized bead reagents, the repeat pipetting can cause possible cross-over contamination. Finally, the NxTAG RPP can process between 1 and 96 samples per run, without wasting additional consumables or reagents. This flexible throughput can cater to the needs of laboratories with different and/or variable volume demands.",
