            "text": "National evidence-based guidelines for preventing healthcare-associated infections (HCAI) in National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in England were commissioned by the Department of Health (DH) and developed during 1998-2000 by a nurse-led multi-professional team of researchers and specialist clinicians. Following extensive consultation, they were published in January 2001. 1 These guidelines describe the precautions healthcare workers should take in three areas: standard principles for preventing HCAI, which include hospital environmental hygiene, hand hygiene, the use of personal protective equipment, and the safe use and disposal of sharps; preventing infections associated with the use of short-term indwelling urethral catheters; and preventing infections associated with central venous catheters. The evidence for these guidelines was identified by multiple systematic reviews of experimental and nonexperimental research and expert opinion as reflected in systematically identified professional, national and international guidelines, which were formally assessed by a validated appraisal process. In 2003, we developed complementary national guidelines for preventing HCAI in primary and community care on behalf of the National Collaborating Centre for Nursing and Supportive Care (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence). 2 A cardinal feature of evidence-based guidelines is that they are subject to timely review in order that new research evidence and technological advances can be identified, appraised and, if shown to be effective in preventing HCAI, incorporated into amended guidelines. Periodically updating the evidence base and guideline recommendations is essential in order to maintain their validity and authority. Consequently, the DH commissioned a review of new evidence published following the last systematic reviews. We have now updated the evidence base for making infection prevention and control recommendations. A critical assessment of the updated evidence indicated that the original epic guidelines published in 2001 remain robust, relevant and appropriate but that adjustments need to be",

We are also indebted to the Infection Control Nurses Association and the Hospital Infection Society for their input into the S2 R.J. Pratt et al. made to some guideline recommendations following a synopsis of the evidence underpinning the guidelines. These updated national guidelines (epic2) provide comprehensive recommendations for preventing HCAI in hospitals and other acute care settings based on the best currently available evidence. Because this is not always the best possible evidence, we have included a suggested agenda for further research in each section of the guidelines. National evidence-based guidelines are broad principles of best practice which need to be integrated into local practice guidelines. To monitor implementation, we have suggested key audit criteria for each section of recommendations. Clinically effective infection prevention and control practice is an essential feature of protecting patients. By incorporating these guidelines into routine daily clinical practice, patient safety can be enhanced and the risk of patients acquiring an infection during episodes of healthcare in NHS hospitals in England can be minimised.",

This concern was addressed by the Infection Control Nurses Association and the Association of Domestic Managers, resulting in the adoption and publication by the Department of Health of quality standards for hospital cleanliness 12, 13 and more recently the NHS Healthcare Cleaning Manual. 14 In addition, existing regulations, 15-17 specialist advice, 18, 19 and clinical governance guidance, 20 all provide a framework within which hospital environmental hygiene can be improved and monitored. The NHS Code of Practice on the Prevention and Control of Healthcare Associated infection came into effect in October 2006. 21 The purpose of this Code of Practice is to help NHS bodies plan and implement strategies for the prevention and control of HCAI. It sets out criteria by which managers of NHS organisations and other healthcare providers should ensure that patients are cared for in a clean environment, where the risk of HCAI is kept as low as possible.

Knowledge deficits may hinder the application of cleaning practices and monitoring and evaluation was indicated. This is further reinforced by an observational study which noted that lapses in adhering to the cleaning protocol were linked with an increase in environmental contamination with isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii. 24 A second systematic review of four cohort studies comparing the use of detergents and disinfectants on microbial contaminated hospital environmental surfaces suggested that a lack of effectiveness was, in many instances due inadequate strengths of disinfectants, probably resulting from a lack of knowledge. 33 ",

Cross-transmission, the transfer of microorganisms between humans, which occurs directly via hands, or indirectly via an environmental source, such as a commode or wash-bowl, occurs all the time in hospitals. It is the antecedent factor to crossinfection that can result in severe clinical outcomes. Overviews of epidemiological evidence conclude that hand-mediated cross-transmission is a major contributing factor in the current infection threats to hospital in-patients. 1 Crosstransmission via hands has been identified as contributing to hospitals outbreaks involving both meticillin-sensitive and meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA/MSSA), multiresistant Gram-negative microorganisms, such as Acinetobacter spp and vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE). 1 Hand-mediated cross-transmission from resident flora (microorganisms that are present on the hands most of the time) and transient flora (microorganisms that are acquired during healthcare activity and without hand hygiene can be deposited directly on to vulnerable patients) presents a direct clinical threat to patients. When these microorganisms are cross transmitted onto susceptible sites, such as surgical wounds, endo-tracheal tubes during pulmonary ventilation, intravascular cannulation sites, enteral feeding systems or urinary catheter drainage systems, etc., serious lifethreatening infections can arise. Even the crosstransmission to non-vulnerable sites can still leave a patient colonised with more pathogenic and resistant hospital microorganisms which may, if opportunity arises, result in a healthcare associated infection at sometime in the future. epic2: Guidelines for Preventing Healthcare-Associated Infections in NHS Hospitals S15 Current evidence-based guidelines conclude that in both outbreak and non-outbreak situations contaminated hands are responsible for crosstransmission of microorganisms and that effective and effective hand decontamination can significantly reduce both cross-transmission and crossinfection rates for the majority of HCAI in all healthcare settings. 1 A recent case control study, conducted during an outbreak of Klebsiella pneumoniae in a neonatal intensive care unit, demonstrated an association between being cared for by a nurse with positive hand cultures for the outbreak strain and infants developing infection or colonisation. 37 Descriptive studies of the dynamics of bacterial hand contamination demonstrate an association between patient care activities that involve direct patient contact and hand contamination. 38, 39 In an observational study of hand contamination during routine patient care in a large teaching hospital, high levels of hand contamination were associated with direct patient contact, respiratory care and handling body fluids. 38 A further descriptive study of healthcare workers' hand contamination during routine neonatal care demonstrated that hands become increasingly contaminated and that gloves do not fully protect healthcare workers' hands from becoming contaminated. 39 The association between hand decontamination and reductions in infection have been confirmed by two additional clinically-based trials 40, 41 and two descriptive studies. 42, 43 A NRCT introducing the use of alcohol-based hand gel to a long term elderly care facility, demonstrated a reduction of 30% in HCAI over a period of 34 months when compared with the control unit. 40 A further NRCT, demonstrated a 45% reduction in respiratory illness in the post-intervention period following the introduction of a hand washing programme. 41 One descriptive study conducted over a four year period during which alcohol-based handrub was introduced for routine hand hygiene demonstrated a reduction in HCAI from 16.9% to 9.9%. 42 A second study that compared rates of HCAI caused by MRSA, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) in the three years prior to the introduction of alcohol-based handrub showed reductions of 21% in MRSA and 41% decrease in VRE. Rates of C. difficile remained unchanged throughout the intervention period. 43 Current national and international guidance consistently identify that effective hand decontamination results in significant reductions in the carriage of potential pathogens on the hands and logically decreases the incidence of preventable HCAI leading to a reduction in patient morbidity and mortality. 1, 44 When must you decontaminate your hands in relation to patient care? Decontamination refers to a process for the physical removal of blood, body fluids, and the removal or destruction of microorganisms from the hands, 44 Current national and international guidance suggests that in deciding when it is necessary to decontaminate hands prior to patient contact, four key factors need to be considered: 1, 44 \u2022 the level of the anticipated contact with patients or objects; \u2022 the extent of the contamination that may occur with that contact; \u2022 the patient care activities being performed;",

Current national and international guidelines 1,44 consider the effectiveness of various preparations for the decontamination of hands using liquid soap and water, antiseptic handwash agents, and alcohol-based handrubs. Overall there is no compelling evidence to favour the general use of antiseptic handwashing agents over soap, or one antiseptic agent over another. 1, 44 Systematic reviews conducted to underpin guidelines for community and primary care and update the 2001 epic guidance 2,3 identified nineteen studies comparing hand hygiene preparations including alcohol-based handrubs and gels, antiseptic hand washes and liquid soap. Five randomised controlled trials (RCT) were conducted in clinical settings and compared the use of alcohol-based preparations with other agents. [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] Four RCTs demonstrated alcohol-based preparations to be a more effective hand hygiene agent than non-medicated soap and antiseptic handwashing agents, [45] [46] [47] [48] while a fifth study found no statistical difference between the use of alcoholbased preparations and antiseptic soap. 49 A clinical crossover trial conducted over 11 months within a neonatal intensive care unit demonstrated no statistical difference between infection rates during the hand washing and handrub phases of the trial. 50 Three clinically based, quasi-experimental studies [51] [52] [53] and nine controlled laboratory experiments 54-62 also demonstrated an association between reductions in microbiological flora and the use of alcohol-based preparations. These studies underpin a growing trend to adopt the use of alcohol-based handrubs and gels in clinical practice. However, two of the above laboratory studies highlight the need for continued evaluation of the use of alcohol-based handrubs within the clinical environment to ensure staff adherence to guidelines and effective hand decontamination. 61, 62 The first study, using European Union (EU) reference standards raises the possibility that alcohol-based gels may not be as effective as handrubs for short durations of use. 61 The second laboratory study, comparing 14 different hand hygiene agents used for a 'clinically realistic' 10 second hand hygiene episode, suggests that some alcohol-based handrubs may lose efficacy after 10 consecutive uses. 62 One clinically-based quasiexperimental study compared the use of 4% chlorhexidine gluconate and 1% triclosan antiseptic handwash preparations in reducing MRSA hand carriage in a specialist surgical ward. 63 Both preparations effectively reduced total hand bacterial counts but 1% triclosan was more effective at eliminating MRSA.",

In a case control study, conducted during an outbreak of Klebsiella pneumoniae in a neonatal intensive care unit, investigators suggest an association between being cared for by a nurse who wore false nails and had positive hand cultures for the outbreak strain, and infants developing infection or colonisation. 37 Systematic reviews conducted to underpin guidelines for community and primary care and update the 2001 epic guidance 2,3 identified one RCT comparing different durations of handwashing and handrubbing on bacterial reduction that found no significant differences between the two study groups. 45 In addition a laboratory study conducted following a period of clinical observation of hand hygiene technique identified that practitioners on average applied a product for 11.6 seconds and concluded that some alcohol-based handrubs become less effective following 10 consecutive hand hygiene episodes. The authors suggest that periodic decontamination of hands, using liquid soap and water, is advisable throughout a shift. 62 Two small-scale laboratory studies investigating methods of hand drying were identified. One found no statistically significant differences between the four methods studied 66 and the other suggests that warm air drying, when the hands are not rubbed simultaneously, may be more effective at reducing the numbers of bacteria on the hands following hand washing than the use of paper towels. 67 Due to the methodological limitations of the above studies, recommendations continue to be based on existing expert opinion that the duration of hand decontamination, the exposure of all aspects of the hands and wrists to the preparation being used, the use of vigorous rubbing to create friction, thorough rinsing in the case of handwashing, and ensuring that hands are completely dry are key factors in effective hand hygiene and the maintenance of skin integrity. 1 Does hand decontamination damage skin? Expert opinion concludes that skin damage is generally associated with the detergent base of the preparation and/or poor handwashing technique. 1 However, the frequent use of hand hygiene agents may cause damage to the skin and alter normal hand flora. Excoriated hands are associated with increased colonisation of potentially pathogenic microorganisms and increase the risk of infection. 1, 44 In addition, the irritant and drying effects of hand preparations have been identified as one of the reasons why healthcare practitioners fail to adhere to hand hygiene guidelines. 1, 44 Systematic reviews conducted to underpin guidelines for community and primary care and update the 2001 epic guidance 2,3 identified ten studies of which four were RCT conducted in clinical settings. 46, 47, 50, 68 They compared the use of alcohol-based preparations with liquid soap and water using self-assessment of skin condition by nurses. In these studies a greater level of irritation was associated with the use of soap.

Importantly, the study noted variation in performance of the same type of glove produced by different manufacturers and propose a test and rating system to assist healthcare workers. ",

Non-disposable protective clothing should be sent for laundering. When is a facemask, respiratory protection and eye protection necessary? Healthcare workers (and sometimes patients) may use standard surgical facemasks to prevent respiratory droplets from the mouth and nose being expelled into the environment. Facemasks are also used, often in conjunction with eye protection, to protect the mucous membranes of the wearer from exposure to blood and/or body fluids when splashing may occur. Our previous systematic review failed to reveal any robust experimental studies that demonstrated that healthcare workers wearing surgical facemasks protected patients from HCAI during routine ward procedures, such as wound dressing or invasive medical procedures. 1 Facemasks are also used to protect the wearer from inhaling minute airborne respiratory particles. As surgical facemasks are not effective in filtering out such small respiratory particles, specialised respiratory protective equipment is recommended for the care of patients with certain respiratory diseases, e.g. active multiple drugresistant pulmonary tuberculosis, 105 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), pandemic influenza. The filtration efficiency of these masks (sometimes called 'respirators') will protect the wearer from inhaling small respiratory particles but to be effective, they must fit closely to the face to minimise leakage around the mask. 1, 106, 107 Although the advice to use particulate filter masks is based on expert opinion, there is evidence from one study that staff exposed to patients with SARS acquired the infection when they did not use particulate filter masks. 108 Another study demonstrated a lack of knowledge about guidance on using particulate respirator masks among staff caring for patients with SARS and suggests that focused training on the use of personal protective equipment and the transmission risk of SARS is required. 109 Our previous systematic review indicated that different protective eyewear offered protection against physical splashing of infected substances into the eyes (although not on all occasions) but that compliance was poor. 1 Expert opinion recommends that face and eye protection reduce the risk of occupational exposure of healthcare workers to splashes of blood, body fluids, secretion or excretions. 1 ",

This should be a part of induction programmes for new staff and on-going in-service education. A national blended e-learning programme on preventing HCAI is available for all healthcare workers. 36 The incidence of sharps injuries has led to the development of needlestick-prevention devices in many different product groups. 121 They are designed to minimise the risk of operator injury during needle use as well as so-called \"downstream\" injuries that occur after disposal, often involving the housekeeping or portering staff responsible for the collection of sharps disposal units.",

This was primarily due to the lack of well-designed, controlled intervention studies. More recent studies have shown significant reductions in injuries associated with the use of safety devices in cannulation, 122,123 phlebotomy 124-126 and injections. 127 It would seem to be logical that where needlefree or other protective devices are used, there should be a resulting reduction in sharps injuries. A review of needlestick injuries in Scotland suggested that 56% of injuries would 'probably' or 'definitely' have been prevented if a safety device had been used. 128 However, some studies identify a range of barriers to the expected reduction in injuries, including staff resistance to using new devices, complexity of device operation or improper use, and poor training. 1 A comprehensive report and product review conducted in the United States of America (USA) provides background information and guidance on the need for and use of needlestick-prevention devices but also gives advice on establishing and evaluating a epic2: Guidelines for Preventing Healthcare-Associated Infections in NHS Hospitals S23",

Some of the devices available are more expensive than standard devices, may not be compatible with existing equipment, and may be associated with an increase in bloodstream infection rates. 129 In the USA, the Occupational Safety Health Administration (OSHA) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) suggest that a thorough evaluation of any device is essential before purchasing decisions are made. 117, 130 Similarly in the United Kingdom, the National Health Service Purchasing and Supply Agency identifies that meaningful evaluations are paramount in assessing user acceptability and clinical applicability of any needle safety devices. 131 The evaluation should ensure that the safety feature works effectively and reliably, that the device is acceptable to health care practitioners and that it does not adversely affect patient care. Hazard analysis critical control points (HACCP) has been used for many years in the food industry to identify and control hazards in food production. It is a systems approach involving a seven stage process starting with the development of a flowchart describing the process, identifying areas (critical control points) where a hazard may occur and then establishing monitoring and control procedures. Clinical governance introduced audit and quality improvement into the NHS. Winning Ways recommended the use of HACCP in preventing HCAIs and the introduction of HACCP is particularly suitable for hospital environmental hygiene. 132 Within the catering industry there are several good examples of cleaning and disinfection HACCP flowcharts, which could be adapted for acute care settings. However all processes need to be defined locally in order to address the particular hazards within the organisation and the people responsible for monitoring them. 133 In adapting these guidelines into local protocols, one should also consider the use of HACCP.

Most bacteria causing infection associated with catheterisation gain access to the urinary tract either extraluminally or intraluminally. Extraluminal contamination may occur as the catheter is inserted, by contamination of the catheter from the health care worker's hands or from the patient's own colonic or perineal flora. Extraluminal contamination is also thought to occur by microorganisms ascending from the perineum. Intraluminal contamination occurs by reflux of bacteria from a contaminated urine drainage bag. Bacteria quickly develop into colonies known as biofilms which adhere to the catheter surface and drainage bag. A biofilm forms when bacteria attach to a surface and subsequently encase themselves in an exopolymeric material. Such bacteria are morphologically and physiologically different from free-living planktonic bacteria. Bacteria in biofilms have considerable survival advantages over free-living microorganisms, being extremely resistant to antibiotic therapy.",

The longer a catheter is in place, the greater the danger There is consistent evidence that a significant number of healthcare-associated infections in hospital are related to urinary catheterisation. 115, [134] [135] [136] The risk of infection is associated with the method and duration of catheterisation, the quality of catheter care and host susceptibility. Urinary catheterisation is a frequent intervention during clinical care in hospital affecting a significant number of patients at any one time. The highest incidence of infection is associated with indwelling urethral catheterisation. 137 The per day risk of the development of bacteriuria appears comparable throughout catheterisation (3-6 percent) but the cumulative risk increases with duration of catheterisation. [137] [138] [139] Consequently, around 50 percent of hospitalised patients catheterised longer than 7-10 days contract bacteriuria. 137 Although frequently asymptomatic, 20-30 percent of patients with catheter-associated bacteriuria will develop symptoms of CAUTI. 137 Many of these infections are serious and lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Of patients with a CAUTI, 1-4 percent develops bacteraemia and, of these, 13-30 die. 137, 140 Duration of catheterisation is strongly associated with risk of infection, i.e., the longer the catheter is in place, the higher the incidence of urinary tract infection. 137, 140 Advice from best practice emphasises the importance of documenting all procedures involving the catheter or drainage system in the patient's records and providing patients with adequate information in relation to the need for catheterisation and details of the insertion, maintenance and removal of their catheter. 115, 141 There is some evidence to suggest that computer management systems improve documentation and in so doing reduce the length of time catheters are in situ. 142 ",

            "text": "Is one catheter better than another? Current evidence-based guidelines 1 identified three experimental studies that compared the use of latex with silicone catheters. [143] [144] [145] No significant difference in the incidence of bacteriuria was found. Four studies compared the use of silver coated (silver alloy or silver oxide) catheters with silicone, hydrogel or Teflon latex. [146] [147] [148] [149] A systematic review and meta-analysis of these and other studies found that silver alloy (but not silver oxide) catheters were associated with a lower incidence of bacteriuria. 140, 150 New evidence related to the efficacy of using urinary catheters coated or impregnated with antiseptic or antimicrobial agents has emerged since our original review in 2000. Two subsequent reviews, 2,3 together with the current update review undertaken by us, have identified four systematic reviews and one meta-analysis that have examined this issue. [150] [151] [152] [153] [154] In general, all of these five studies suggest antiseptic impregnated or antimicrobial-coated urinary catheters can significantly prevent or delay the onset of CAUTI when compared to standard untreated urinary catheters. The consensus in these five reviews of evidence however, is that the individual studies reviewed are generally of poor quality; for instance in one case only 8 studies out of 117 met the inclusion criteria and in another, of the six reports describing 7 trials included, only one scored 5 in the quality assessment the other five scored only 1. 150, 154 Studies investigating a wide range of coated or impregnated catheters are explored in the new evidence including: catheters coated or impregnated with: silver alloy 150,151,154-161 ; silver oxide 150 ; gendine 162 ; gentamicin 163 and silver-hydrogel [164] [165] [166] ; minocycline 167 ; rifampicin 167 ; chlorhexidine-silver sulfadiazine 166 ; chlorhexidine-sulfadiazine-triclosan 166 ; nitrofurazone 166 ; and nitrofuroxone. 168 New evidence suggests that catheters coated with silver alloy are clinically effective in reducing the incidence of CAUTI, but many studies are of poor methodological quality. Consequently there remains inconclusive evidence to recommend their use in preference to other types of catheter at this time. Despite their unit cost, there is a suggestion that these devices might be a cost-effective option if overall numbers of infections are significantly reduced through their use. The few studies that have explored the cost benefit/ effectiveness of using these devices have, however, also been inconclusive. 157, 159, 161, 165 Evidence from best practice indicates that the incidence of CAUTI in patients catheterised for a short time (up to one week) is not influenced by any particular type of catheter material. 136, 169 However, many practitioners have strong preferences for one type of catheter over another. This preference is often based on clinical experience, patient assessment, and which materials induce the least allergic response. Smaller gauge catheters with a 10 ml balloon minimise urethral trauma, mucosal irritation and residual urine in the bladder, all factors that predispose to CAUTI. 135, 170 However, in adults that have recently undergone urological surgery, larger gauge catheters may be indicated to allow for the passage of blood clots.",

Maintaining a sterile, continuously closed urinary drainage system is central to the prevention of CAUTI. 115, 134, 135, 173, 175, 176 The risk of infection reduces from 97 percent with an open system to 8-15 percent when a sterile closed system is employed. 136, 174, 177 Breaches in the closed system such as unnecessary emptying of the urinary drainage bag or taking a urine sample, will increase the risk of catheter-related infection and should be avoided. 115, 136, 178 Hands must be decontaminated and clean, non-sterile gloves worn before manipulation. A systematic review suggests that sealed (e.g., taped, pre-sealed) drainage systems contribute to preventing bacteriuria. 153 There is limited evidence as to how often catheter bags should be changed. One study showed higher rates of symptomatic and asymptomatic CAUTI were associated with a three day urinary drainage bag change regimen when compared to no routine change regimen. 179 Best practice suggests changing only when necessary, i.e., according to either the manufacturers' recommendations or the patient's clinical need. 115, 134 Reflux of urine is associated with infection and consequently, drainage bags should be positioned in a way that prevents back-flow of urine. 115, 135 It is also recommended that urinary drainage bags should be hung on an appropriate stand that prevents contact with the floor. 136 A number of studies have investigated the addition of disinfectants and antimicrobials to drainage bags as a way of preventing CAUTI. 140 Three acceptable studies from our original systematic review demonstrated no reduction in the incidence of bacteriuria following the addition of hydrogen peroxide or chlorhexidine to urinary drainage bags. 1, [180] [181] [182] A systematic review supports these findings in that it suggests that adding bacterial solutions to drainage bags has no effect on catheter associated infection. 153 ",

Expert opinion [134] [135] [136] and another systematic review 140 support the view that vigorous meatal cleansing is not necessary and may increase the risk of infection and that daily routine bathing or showering is all that is needed to maintain meatal hygiene.",

            "text": "Background and context to the Guidelines Bloodstream infections associated with the insertion and maintenance of central venous access devices (CVAD) are among the most dangerous complications of healthcare that can occur, worsening the severity of the patient's underlying ill health, prolonging the period of hospitalisation and increasing the cost of care. [201] [202] [203] [204] Approximately 3 in every 1000 patients admitted to hospital in the UK acquires a bloodstream infection, and nearly one third of these infections are related to central venous access devices. 205 Catheter related blood stream infection (CR-BSI) involves the presence of systemic infection and evidence implicating the CVAD as its source, i.e., the isolation of the same microorganism from blood cultures as that shown to be significantly colonising the CVAD of a patient with clinical features of bacteraemia. Catheter colonization refers to a significant growth of microorganisms on either the endoluminal or the external catheter surface beneath the skin in the absence of systemic infection. [206] [207] [208] The microorganisms that colonise catheter hubs and the skin adjacent to the insertion site are the source of most CR-BSI. Coagulase-negative staphylococci, particularly Staphylococcus epidermidis, are the most frequently implicated microorganisms associated with CR-BSI. Other microorganisms commonly involved include Staphylococcus aureus, Candida species and enterococci. 208 CR-BSI is generally caused either by skin microorganisms at the insertion site that contaminate the catheter during insertion and migrate along the cutaneous catheter track, or microorganisms from the hands of healthcare workers that contaminate and colonise the catheter hub during care interventions. 206 Infusate contamination or haematogenous seeding from site of infection elsewhere in the body is more rarely implicated as a cause of CR-BSI.

We concluded that the development processes were valid and that the guidelines were evidence-based, categorised to the strength of the evidence examined, reflective of current concepts of best practice, and acknowledged as the most authoritative reference guidelines currently available. They were subsequently used by us as the principal source of evidence for updating the first version of the epic guidelines. 1 In preparing the epic2 guidance, we conducted a final updating systematic review which is described in Section 4.14.",

HICPAC examined several randomised controlled trials and other studies which suggested that multi-lumen catheters were associated with a higher risk of infection than were single lumen catheters. 208, [216] [217] [218] [219] [220] However, other studies examined by HICPAC failed to demonstrate a difference in the rates of CR-BSI. 221, 222 HICPAC noted that multi-lumen catheter insertion sites may be particularly prone to infection because of increased trauma at the insertion site or because multiple ports increase the frequency of CVAD manipulation. 218,219 HICPAC also noted that although patients with multi-lumen catheters tend to be more ill than those without such catheters, the infection risk observed with these catheters may have been independent of the patient's underlying disease severity. 220 Two additional studies were identified from our systematic reviews. A systematic review and quantitative meta-analysis focused on determining the risk of CR-BSI and catheter colonisation in multilumen catheters compared with single-lumen catheters. 223 Reviewers reported that although CR-BSI was more common in patients with multilumen when compared with single-lumen catheters, when confined to high quality studies that control for patient differences, there is no significant difference in rates of CR-BSI. This analysis suggests that multilumen catheters are not a significant risk factor for increased CR-BSI or local catheter colonisation compared with single-lumen CVAD.",

As authors were only able to analyze a limited number of trials, further large RCTs of adequate power and rigour are needed to confirm these findings. In the meantime, it may be reasonable for patients who need a CVAD to choose a singlelumen catheter whenever there is no indication for a multi-lumen catheter. Tunnelled and totally implantable ports Surgically implanted (tunnelled) CVAD, e.g., Hickman \u00ae catheters, are commonly used to provide vascular access (and stable anchorage) to patients requiring long-term intravenous therapy. Alternatively, totally implantable intravascular devices, e.g., Port-A-Cath, \u00ae are also tunnelled under the skin but have a subcutaneous port or reservoir with a self-sealing septum that is accessible by needle puncture through intact skin.",

[236] [237] [238] [239] [240] [241] [242] [243] [244] [245] [246] Additional evidence was obtained from studies of efficacy of tunnelling to reduce CR-infections in patients with short-term CVAD. One randomised controlled trial demonstrated that subcutaneous tunnelling of short-term CVAD inserted into the internal jugular vein reduced the risk for CR-BSI. 247 In a later randomised controlled trial, the same investigators failed to show a statistically significant difference in the risk for CR-BSI for subcutaneously tunnelled femoral vein catheters. 248 An additional meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials focused on the efficacy of tunnelling short-term CVAD to prevent CRinfections. 249 Data synthesis demonstrated that tunnelling decreased catheter colonisation by 39% and decreased CR-BSI by 44% in comparison with non-tunnelled placement. The majority of the benefit in the decreased rate of catheter-sepsis came from one trial of CVAD inserted at the internal jugular site. The reduction in risk was not significant when pooled with data from five subclavian catheter trials. Tunnelling was not associated with increased risk of mechanical complications from placement or technical difficulties during placement; these outcomes were not rigorously evaluated. This meta-analysis concluded that tunnelling decreased CRinfections. However, a synthesis of the evidence in this meta-analysis does not support routine subcutaneous tunnelling of short-term subclavian venous catheters and this cannot be recommended unless efficacy is evaluated at different placement sites and relative to other interventions.",

[266] [267] [268] [269] [270] [271] Thus, in adult patients, a subclavian site is preferred for infection control purposes, although other factors, e.g., the potential for mechanical complications, risk for subclavian vein stenosis, and catheter-operator skill, should be considered when deciding where to place the catheter. HICPAC cited a meta-analysis of 8 studies and guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) indicate that the use of bedside ultrasound for the placement of CVAD substantially reduced mechanical complications compared with the standard landmark placement technique. 272, 273 Consequently, the use of ultrasound may indirectly reduce the risk of infection by facilitating mechanically uncomplicated subclavian placement.",

Investigators concluded that PICC used in high-risk hospitalised patients are associated with a rate of CR-BSI similar to conventional CVAD placed in the internal jugular or subclavian veins (2 to 5 per 1,000 catheter-days). This rate is much higher than with PICC used exclusively in the outpatient setting (approximately 0.4 per 1,000 catheterdays). They question whether the growing trend in many hospital haematology and oncology services to switch from the use of cuffed and tunnelled CVAD to PICC is justified, particularly since PICC are more vulnerable to thrombosis and dislodgment, and are less useful for drawing blood specimens. Moreover, PICC are not advisable in patients with renal failure and impending need for dialysis, in whom preservation of upper-extremity veins is needed for fistula or graft implantation.

Although this is considered adequate for preventing infections associated with the insertion of short peripheral venous catheters, it is recognised that central venous catheterisation carries a significantly greater risk of infection. However, the level of barrier precautions needed to prevent infection during CVAD insertion was controversial at the time of the development of the HICPAC guidelines. 208 Studies examined by HICPAC concluded that if maximal sterile barrier precautions (MSB) were used during CVAD insertion, catheter contamination and subsequent CR-infections could be significantly minimised. 264, [277] [278] [279] One of these studies was a prospective randomised trial that tested the efficacy of maximal sterile barriers to reduce infections associated with long-term nontunnelled subclavian silicone catheters. 279 When MSB were compared with routine procedures, they significantly decreased the risk of CR-BSI. 279 MSB involve wearing sterile gloves and gown, a cap, mask and using a large sterile drape during insertion of the catheter as opposed to routine infection prevention procedures that involve wearing only sterile gloves and the use of a small drape. However, there is no specific evidence that wearing a facemask or cap during catheter insertion is important in preventing CR-BSI.",

Their search identified 95 articles discussing the prevention of CVAD-related infections. The majority of these articles were review articles or consensus statements. Only three primary research studies comparing infection outcomes using MSB with less stringent barrier techniques were identified and included in the review. Authors identified no additional unpublished or ongoing primary studies. All three studies included in the review concluded that the use of MSB resulted in a reduction in catheterrelated infections. The studies differed notably in their patient populations, research designs, and healthcare settings. Study authors concluded that using MSB has been found to decrease transmission of microorganisms, to delay colonization, and to reduce the rate of hospital-acquired infections. They suggest that biological plausibility and the available evidence support using MSB during routine insertion of a CVAD to minimise the risk of infection. They recommend that given the lack of adverse patient reactions, the relatively low cost of MSB, and the high cost of CR-BSI, it is probable that MSB will prove to be a cost-effective or even a cost-saving intervention.

            "text": "Appropriate preparation of the insertion site will reduce the risk of catheter-related infection Microorganisms that colonise catheter hubs and the skin surrounding the CVAD insertion site are the cause of most CR-BSIs. 206, 260, 284 The risk of infection increases with the density of microorganisms around the insertion site. Skin cleansing/ antisepsis of the insertion site is therefore one of the most important measures for preventing CRinfection. 208 An important prospective randomised trial of agents used for cutaneous antisepsis demonstrated that 2% aqueous chlorhexidine was superior to either 10% povidone-iodine or 70% alcohol for preventing central venous and arterial CR-infections. 285 An additional study has since confirmed the superior efficacy of 2% aqueous chlorhexidine compared to povidone iodine in substantially reducing central venous catheter colonisation. 286 Direct comparisons of aqueous versus alcoholic solutions of chlorhexidine have not been undertaken in relation to cutaneous antisepsis for preventing CR-infections. However, an alcoholic solution of chlorhexidine combines the benefits of rapid action and excellent residual activity. 287 The application of organic solvents, such as acetone or ether, to 'defat' (remove skin lipids) the skin before catheter insertion and during routine dressing changes had been a standard component of many hyperalimentation protocols. However, there was no evidence available to HICPAC to show that the use of these agents provided any protection against CR-infection and their use could greatly increase local inflammation and patient discomfort. 208 Several studies were examined that focused on the application of antimicrobial ointments to the catheter site at the time of catheter insertion, or during routine dressing changes, to reduce microbial contamination of catheter insertion sites. 284 Reported efficacy in preventing CRinfections by this practice yielded contradictory findings. [288] [289] [290] [291] [292] [293] There was also concern that the use of polyantibiotic ointments that were not fungicidal could significantly increase the rate of colonisation of the catheter by Candida species. 292, 294 Systematic Review Evidence A meta-analysis published in 2004 assessed studies that compared the risk for CR-BSI following insertion-site skin care with either any type of chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) solution versus povidone iodine (PI) solution. 295 This analysis indicated that the use of CHG rather than PI can reduce the risk for CR-BSI by approximately 49% (risk ratio, 0.51 [CI, 0.27 to 0.97]) in hospitalised patients who require short-term catheterisation, i.e., for every 1000 catheter sites disinfected with CHG rather than PI, 71 episodes of catheter colonization and 11 episodes of CR-BSI would be prevented. In this analysis, several types of CHG solutions were used in the individual trials, including 0.5 percent or 1 percent CHG alcohol solution and 0.5 percent or 2 percent CHG aqueous solution. All of these solutions provided a concentration of CHG that is higher than the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for most nosocomial bacteria and yeasts. Subset analysis of aqueous and non-aqueous solutions showed similar effect sizes, but only the subset analysis of the five studies that used alcoholic CHG solution produced a statistically significant reduction in CR-BSI. Because few studies used CHG aqueous solution, the lack of a significant difference seen for this solution compared with PI solution may be a result of inadequate statistical power.",

            "text": "A Cochrane Review of gauze and tape versus transparent polyurethane dressings for CVAD concluded that there was no evidence demonstrating any difference in the incidence of CR-related infections between any of the dressing types compared in this review. 298 Each of these comparisons was based on no more than 2 studies and all of these studies reported data from a small patient sample. Therefore it is probable that the findings of no difference between dressing types is due to the lack of adequate data. They further concluded that because there is a high level of uncertainty regarding the risk of infection associated with the CVAD dressings included in this review, at this stage it appears that the choice of dressing for CVAD can be based on patient preference. CVAD Use an appropriate antiseptic agent for disinfecting the catheter insertion site during dressing changes HICPAC described compelling evidence that aqueous chlorhexidine 2% was superior to either 10% povidone iodine or 70% alcohol in lowering CR-BSI rates when used for skin antisepsis prior to CVAD insertion. 209, 285 They made no recommendation for the use of any disinfectant agent for cleaning the insertion site during dressing changes. Studies focused on the use of antimicrobial ointment applied under the dressing to the catheter insertion site to prevent CVAD-related infection do not clearly demonstrate efficacy. 289, 294 Systematic Review Evidence A recent meta-analysis assessed studies that compared the risk for CR-BSI following insertionsite skin care with either any type of chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) solution versus povidone iodine (PI) solution. 295 This analysis indicated that the use of CHG rather than PI can reduce the risk for CR-BSI by approximately 49% (risk ratio, 0.51 [CI, 0.27 to 0.97]) in hospitalised patients who require short-term catheterisation, i.e., for every 1000 catheter sites disinfected with CHG rather than PI, 71 episodes of catheter colonization and 11 episodes of CR-BSI would be prevented. In this analysis, several types of CHG solutions were used in the individual trials, including 0.5 percent or 1 percent CHG alcohol solution and 0.5 percent or 2 percent CHG aqueous solution. All of these solutions provided a concentration of CHG that is higher than the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for most nosocomial bacteria and yeasts. Subset analysis of aqueous and non-aqueous solutions showed similar effect sizes, but only the subset analysis of the five studies that used alcoholic CHG solution produced a statistically significant reduction in CR-BSI. Because few studies used CHG aqueous solution, the lack of a significant difference seen for this solution compared with PI solution may be a result of inadequate statistical power.",

They considered evidence that showed duration of catheterisation to be a risk factor for infection and which advocated routine replacement of CVAD at specified intervals as a measure to reduce infection. 222, 265, 299, 300 Other studies, however, suggested that the daily risk of infection remains constant and showed that routine replacement of CVAD, without a clinical indication, does not reduce the rate of catheter colonisation or the rate of CR-BSI. 301, 302 Conclusions from a systematic review agree that exchanging catheters by any method every three days was not beneficial in reducing infections, compared with catheter replacement on an as-needed basis. 303",

Guide wire insertion has been the accepted technique for replacing a malfunctioning catheter (or exchanging a pulmonary artery catheter for a CVAD when invasive monitoring was no longer needed) as they are associated with less discomfort and a significantly lower rate of mechanical complications than those percutaneously inserted at a new site. Studies of the risks for infection associated with guide wire insertions examined by HICPAC yielded conflicting results. One prospective study showed a significantly higher rate of CR-BSI associated with catheters replaced over a guide wire compared with catheters inserted percutaneously. 301 However, three prospective studies (two randomised) showed no significant difference in infection rates between catheters inserted percutaneously and those inserted over a guide wire. 302, 304, 305 Since these studies suggest that the insertion of the new catheter at a new site does not alter the rate of infectious complications per day but does increase the incidence of mechanical complications, guide wire exchange is recommended. Most studies examined by HICPAC concluded that, in cases where the catheter being removed is known to be infected, guidewire exchange is contraindicated. 302, [304] [305] [306] [307] A systematic review concluded that, compared with new site replacement, guidewire exchange was associated with a trend toward a higher rate of subsequent catheter colonisation, regardless of whether patients had a suspected infection at the time of replacement. Guidewire exchange was also associated with trends toward a higher rate of catheter exit-site infection and CR-BSI. However, guidewire exchange was associated with fewer mechanical complications relative to new-site replacement. 303 Methods are available and techniques have been described which allow a diagnosis of CR-BSI to be made without the need for catheter removal. 308 Such approaches could be used prior to the replacement of a new catheter over a guide wire in order to reduce the subsequent risk of CRinfection. 308 ",

[310] [311] [312] [313] [314] [315] [316] In a relatively recent overview, additional evidence from a prospective cohort study suggested that frequent catheter hub manipulation increases the risk for microbial contamination. 260, 317 During prolonged catherisation, catheter hubs are accessed more frequently, increasing the likeli-epic2: Guidelines for Preventing Healthcare-Associated Infections in NHS Hospitals hood of a CR-BSI emanating from a colonised catheter hub rather than the insertion site. 316 Consequently, the reviewer commented that hubs and sampling ports should be disinfected before they are accessed and noted that both povidoneiodine and chlorhexidine are effective. 250, 318, 319 Systematic Review Evidence In a recent randomized prospective clinical trial conducted in England, the microbial contamination rate of luers of CVAD with either PosiFlow \u00ae needleless connectors or standard caps attached was investigated. 320 The efficacy of: chlorhexidine gluconate 0.5% w/v in industrial methylated spirit (IMS) BP 70% w/w spray (Hydrex DS \u00ae ); Sterile isopropyl alcohol (IPA) 70% w/w spray (Spiriclens \u00ae ); and 10% (w/v) aqueous povidone-iodine (Betadine \u00ae ) was assessed for the disinfection of intravenous connections. Patients were designated to receive chlorhexidine/alcohol, isopropyl alcohol or povidone-iodine for pre-CVAD insertion skin preparation and disinfection of the connections. After 72 h in situ the microbial contamination rate of 580 luers, 306 with standard caps and 274 with needleless connectors attached, was determined. The microbial contamination rate of the external compression seals of 274 needleless connectors was also assessed to compare the efficacy of the three disinfectants. The internal surfaces of 55 out of 306 (18%) luers with standard caps were contaminated with microorganisms, whilst only 18 out of 274 (6.6%) luers with needleless connectors were contaminated (p < 0.0001). Of those needleless connectors disinfected with isopropyl alcohol, 69.2% were externally contaminated with microorganisms compared with 30.8% disinfected with chlorhexidine/alcohol (p < 0.0001) and 41.6% with povidone-iodine (p < 0.0001). These results suggest that the use of needleless connectors may reduce the microbial contamination rate of CVAD luers compared with the standard cap. Furthermore, disinfection of needleless connectors with either chlorhexidine/alcohol or povidone-iodine significantly reduced external microbial contamination. Both these strategies may reduce the risk of catheter-related infections acquired via the intraluminal route.",

Evidence reviewed by HICPAC demonstrated the effectiveness of this type of prophylaxis in neutropenic patients with long-term CVAD. 209 However, they found no evidence that routinely using this procedure in all patients with CVAD reduced the risk of CR-BSI and may lead to an increase in antimicrobial resistant microorganisms. CVAD 321 Patients with cancer often need to be given drugs and other treatments intravenously, so are frequently fitted with long-term tunnelled CVAD. Infections sometimes occur. Clinical trial evidence shows it may be useful to give prophylactic antibiotics prior to inserting a tunnelled CVAD or to flush the catheter with combined vancomycin and heparin, but microbial resistance may occur unless this practice is limited to highrisk patients. CVAD Maintaining CVAD patency and preventing catheter thrombosis may help prevent infections Indwelling central venous and pulmonary artery catheters are thrombogenic. Thrombus forms on these catheters in the first few hours following placement and may serve as a nidus for microbial colonization of intravascular catheters. 322, 323 Thrombosis of large vessels occurs after long-term catheterisation in 35 to 65% of patients. [324] [325] [326] [327] [328] Prophylactic heparin and warfarin have been widely used to prevent catheter thrombus formation and catheter related complications, such as deep venous thrombosis (DVT). 209, 329 Two types of heparin can be used: unfractionated (standard) heparin and low molecular weight heparins. Although more expensive, low molecular weight heparins have a longer duration of action than unfractionated heparin and are generally administered by subcutaneous injection once daily. The standard prophylactic regimen of low molecular weight heparins are at least as effective and as safe as unfractionated heparin in preventing venous thrombo-embolism and does not require laboratory monitoring. 330 ",

Preparation requires wetting hands under tepid running water before applying the recommended amount of liquid soap or an antimicrobial preparation. The handwash solution must come into contact with all of the surfaces of the hand. The hands must be rubbed together vigorously for a minimum of 10-15 seconds, paying particular attention to the tips of the fingers, the thumbs and the areas between the fingers. Hands should be rinsed thoroughly prior to drying with good quality paper towels. SP12 When decontaminating hands using an Class D alcohol-based handrub, hands should be free of dirt and organic material. The handrub solution must come into contact with all surfaces of the hand. The hands must be rubbed together vigorously, paying particular attention to the tips of the fingers, the thumbs and the areas between the fingers, until the solution has evaporated and the hands are dry. SP13 Clinical staff should be aware of the Class D potentially damaging effects of hand decontamination products.

SP28 Plastic aprons/gowns should be worn Class D/H&S as single-use items, for one procedure or episode of patient care, and then discarded and disposed of as clinical waste. Non-disposable protective clothing should be sent for laundering. SP29 Full-body fluid-repellent gowns must Class D/H&S be worn where there is a risk of extensive splashing of blood, body fluids, secretions or excretions, with the exception of perspiration, onto the skin or clothing of healthcare personnel (for example when assisting with childbirth).
