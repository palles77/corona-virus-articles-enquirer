            "text": "Masked palm civets are highly susceptible to infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Infected animals become less aggressive and develop pyrexia, lethargy and diarrhoea. The present study describes the spectrum of histopathological changes in the lung, spleen, lymph node, liver, small intestine, kidney and cerebrum of civets infected experimentally with SARS-CoV. In-situ hybridization (ISH) with probes specific for the RNA polymerase gene demonstrated viral RNA in the lung, small intestine and cerebrum only. In-situ labelling was employed in order to demonstrate cellular apoptosis in the cerebrum, but there was no evidence of apoptosis within the myocardium. These results indicate that SARS-CoV causes multi-organ pathology in civets, similar to that observed in human SARS patients. These parallels suggest that civets may be used as an animal model of this infection to gain insight into the pathogenesis of SARS and for evaluation of candidate vaccines and antiviral drugs.",

SARS is an acute pulmonary syndrome characterized by atypical pneumonia, progressive respiratory failure and death in up to 10% of infected individuals (Poon et al., 2004) . Although the SARS epidemic has subsided, many authorities, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), have warned of the possible re-emergence of this highly infectious disease. It is therefore imperative that effective measures to prevent and treat the disease are developed and evaluated. To achieve this goal, animal models will play an essential role in studying the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infection and in developing effective vaccines and therapeutics. A wide range of animal species has been confirmed to be susceptible to experimental infection with SARS-CoV, including rodents (mice and hamsters), carnivores (ferrets and cats) and non-human primates (Wang et al., 2006) . Adult mice infected with SARS-CoV via the respiratory tract show no clinical signs of disease and only mild respiratory tract inflammation . Aged mice, hamsters and ferrets do show signs of clinical disease such as weight loss and ruffled fur but do not develop lung pathology (Martina et al., 2003; Roberts et al., 2005a,b) . Two groups of investigators have studied SARS-CoV infection in African green monkeys and common marmosets McAuliffe et al., 2004; Greenough et al., 2005) . Others have evaluated cynomolgus monkeys and rhesus macaques as potential models, but clinical disease is inconsistently induced in these latter species McAuliffe et al., 2004; Rowe et al., 2004) .",

By contrast, all cynomolgus monkeys and rhesus macaques inoculated in this manner developed interstitial pneumonia of variable severity but no other tissue changes . This pulmonary pathology was similar in nature to that seen in SARS patients, but the lesions were less severe than in infected humans. Therefore, there remains a requirement for an animal model of human SARS that closer approximates the tissue pathology that occurs in the human disease.",

This report prompted us to examine the feasibility of using civets as a better animal model for SARS. In a preliminary infection study, two groups of civets were inoculated with two different strains of SARS-CoV. Strain GZ01 was isolated during the early stages of the SARS epidemic and strain BJ01 was isolated during the middle phase of the epidemic (Wu et al., 2005) . Both strains were shown capable of infecting civets and inducing clinical signs including pyrexia, lethargy and loss of aggression (Wu et al., 2005) . The aim of the present study was to extend these observations by characterizing the tissue pathology in the infected civets and determining the distribution of viral RNA in tissues from those animals. In addition, analysis of cellular apoptosis in selected tissues was also conducted in an attempt to understand the pathogenesis of this viral infection in civets and to further determine the suitability of this species to model the human disease.",

SARS-CoV isolates were propagated in Vero E6 cells for two additional passages to generate virus stocks with titres of 1 \u00c2 10 6 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID 50 )/ml. Ten one-yearold masked palm civets were housed in individual biosafety isolators and were divided into two groups (n \u00bc 5 per group). Animals in groups A and B were inoculated with 3 ml of virus solution containing 3 \u00c2 10 6 TCID 50 of BJ01 and GZ01 isolates, respectively, with 2 ml instilled into the trachea and 1 ml given intranasally. A control civet was mock-infected in an identical fashion with 3 ml of Vero E6 cell culture supernatant. All work with infectious virus was performed inside a biosafety cabinet, in an approved animal biosafety level 3 laboratory. Serology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis were conducted to confirm that the civets had not been previously exposed to SARS-CoV. Animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the animal ethics guidelines and approved protocols issued by the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.",

In one study it was shown that SARS-CoV genome sequences from civets underwent rapid evolution before transmission to humans, suggesting that civets were a relatively new host to those viruses, rather than a natural reservoir host that had adapted to SARS-CoV (Song et al., 2005) . In another study it was shown that while approximately 80% of civets in one market in Guangzhou had serological evidence of infection by SARS-CoV, animals on farms were largely free from infection. This suggested that infection of civets was associated with trading activities under conditions of overcrowding and mixing of various animal species, which provided an environment for efficient interspecies transmission (Tu et al., 2004) . Furthermore, it has been shown that the S proteins of SARS-CoV isolated from human patients in the early stage of the outbreaks bound to and utilized the civet ACE2 receptor molecule, but S proteins of the civet isolates used human ACE2 markedly less efficiently (Li et al., 2005b) . These findings provide evidence that civets have served as an efficient amplification host for SARS-CoV and that the SARS-CoV has undergone rapid evolution after transmission to the human population.",

These lesions were similar to those described for SARS-CoV-infected macaques Kuiken et al., 2003; Qin et al., 2005) , but were milder than in humans with SARS (Ding et al., 2003; Franks et al., 2003; Nicholls et al., 2003; Tse et al., 2004) . The observed follicular depletion in lymph nodes and atrophy of splenic white pulp also occur in human SARS (Zhao et al., 2003) .",

This distribution is again similar to that observed in human SARS patients (Ding et al., 2004; To et al., 2004; Nicholls et al., 2006) . There is currently little information available regarding the distribution of SARS-CoV RNA in other experimental animals with the exception of detection of viral RNA in bronchiolar epithelial cells of mice at 2 dpi . In-situ apoptosis analysis revealed that for two civets, glial cells and neurons in the cerebrum displayed apoptosis at 3 and 13 dpi, respectively. This finding suggests that SARS-CoV may cause direct damage to those cells, providing useful information for future study of disease pathogenesis. The same set of probes and methods were applied to SARS-CoV infected monkey tissues obtained from previous studies, but no positive results were obtained, suggesting that civets and monkeys respond differently to SARS-CoV infection.",
