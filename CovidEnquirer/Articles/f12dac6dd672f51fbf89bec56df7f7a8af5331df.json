According to the World Health Organization (WHO), between 25 April and 11 October 2009, 399,232 confirmed cases of H1N1 influenza virus and 4,735 deaths occurred throughout the world. 5 Brazil reported 1,528 deaths up to 10 November 2009. 6 Swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus infection can cause severe acute respiratory failure (ARF), requiring admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) in 15-30% of previously healthy young to middle-aged people. 3, 4, 7, 8 Death may occur when co-infections or lung injury prevail over the immune response, resulting in a progressive worsening of lung function (low compliance and oxygenation). Early diagnosis and a complete understanding of the pathological features of the H1N1 virus are important to help to improve treatment and the prognosis of this lethal disease. Analysis of the lung tissue from an open lung biopsy (OLB) of these severe cases can help in understanding the pathogenesis of this severe and sometimes fatal development. Until now, no reports of OLB findings used to guide the treatment of patients with H1N1 pneumonitis have been published, although according to many authors OLB is safe and diagnostically useful in patients with ARF, enabling appropriate therapy. [9] [10] [11] [12] The pathogenesis of ARF associated with swine-origin influenza virus (S-OIV) infection in humans is unknown. The influenza virus triggers pulmonary inflammation owing to an infiltration of inflammatory cells and an immune response. Bronchial epithelial cells are the primary target and the principal host for the virus. 13, 14 Normally, influenza viruses are recognized and destroyed by innate immune mechanisms which involve macrophages, interferon (IFN) a, b and other cytokines, natural killer (NK) cells and complement. When influenza viruses escape from these early defense mechanisms, they are captured and eliminated by adaptive immune mechanisms, where T and B cells and their antigen-specific effectors (cytotoxic T lymphocytes, cytokines such as IFNc and antibodies) target the virus. Additionally, antigen-specific memory cells (T and B cells) are involved in the prevention of the subsequent viral infection. 14 Thus, pathological findings obtained by an OLB, coupled to ultrastructural and immunologic analysis, may have an impact on decisions about changes in treatment strategies employed for these critically ill patients, and also provide a greater understanding of the pathophysiology of S-OIV infection. The objective of this study was to analyze pathologically and ultrastructurally S-OIV lung infection and the pulmonary immune response in a series of five cases with OLB.",

Nasal swabs for RT-PCR for H1N1 were collected from all patients. The OLBs indicated by the clinicians were carried out after receiving consent from the families. These patients had a severe evolution of the virus and more information about the physiopathology of the disease was required in order to provide adequate treatment. If no improvement of the respiratory status was seen in the patients with ARF after $5 days (defined as no decrease of the Lung Injury Score) an OLB was indicated. 15 Lung tissue sections (4 mm thick), prepared from 10% formalin-fixed, routinely processed, paraffin-embedded blocks, were stained with hematoxylin-eosin. The following methods of histochemical staining were carried out: Grocott's methenamine silver stain, Brown-Brenn, and Ziehl-Neelsen. The following pathological changes were analyzed: a) necrotizing bronchiolitis, b) alveolar collapse, c) dilatation of the airspaces, d) hyaline membrane, e) fibroplasia, f) squamous metaplasia, g) multinucleated cells, h) alveolar hemorrhage, i) acute inflammatory exudates, j) atypical pneumocytes. Pathological changes were graded, using two sections, according to a five-point semiquantitative severity-based scoring system as: 0 = normal lung parenchyma, 1 = changes in 1-25%, 2 = changes in 26-50%, 3 = changes in 51-75%, and 4 = changes in 76-100% of examined tissue. This semiquantitative analysis is currently routinely used in most studies of the department of pathology of the University of S\u00e3 o Paulo Medical School. 16, 17 For immunohistochemistry, the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex and streptavidin-biotin enzyme complex immunostaining methods were used with antibodies against: lymphocytes CD4 (clone: MO834, dilution 1:1000), CD8 (clone: M7103, dilution 120), CD20 (clone: M755, dilution 140), macrophages-histiocytes CD68 (clone: M814, dilution 130), mouse monoclonal antibodies from DAKO, Carpinteria, CA, USA; S100 (clone: Z311, dilution 11000) rabbit polyclonal antibodies from DAKO; CD1a (clone: MCA1657, dilution 1: 200) mouse monoclonal antibodies from Serotec, Oxford, UK; natural killer, NK (clone: MS136P, dilution 11000) mouse monoclonal antibodies from Neomarkers, Fremont, CA, USA; interleukin 4 (IL-4) (dilution 140), IL-10 (dilution 140) goat polyclonal antibodies from R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA; IFNc (clone: MAB285, dilution 130), mouse monoclonal antibodies from R&D Systems; tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) (clone: AF210NA, dilution 140) all mouse monoclonal antibodies from R&D Systems; inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (dilution 1500) polyclonal rabbit from Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA, USA.",

Ultrathin sections obtained from selected areas were double-stained and examined in a Philips TECNAI 10 electron microscope at 80 kV. For each electron microscopy image (15/case), the following structural changes were analyzed: a) cytoplasmic swelling, b) degenerative changes, c) sloughing of necrotizing alveolar epithelial cell type I (AECI) and II (AECII), d) denudation of the epithelial basement membrane, e) hyaline membranes, f) alveolar septal collapse, g) viral particles such as tubuloreticular structures (TRS) and cylindrical confronting cisternae (CCC), h) multinucleated AECII. Ultrastructural findings were graded according to a five-point semiquantitative severity-based scoring system as: 0 = normal lung parenchyma, 1 = changes in 1-25%, 2 = changes in 26-50%, 3 = changes in 51-75%, and 4 = changes in 76-100% of examined tissue. 16, 17 ",

They were transferred to the ICU for tracheal intubation and ventilation (range 8-25 days; median 17) and diagnosed as having ARF. 15 All the patients received 75 mg twice a day by nasal enteral tube of olsetamivir (range 4-14 days; median 10) and intravenous steroids (range 9-20 days; median 12). After obtaining these results the dose was changed from 75 mg twice a day to 150 mg twice a day through a nasal enteral tube, in accordance with the Brazilian guidelines. The presence of the H1N1 virus was confirmed in all five patients (Table 1) by nasal swab or lung tissue positivity of RT-PCR according to guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 19 Other microbiological investigations, including the isolation of other viruses, were negative. During the evolution of disease in the patients in the ICU, Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from a blood culture (patients 2 and 3) and Klebsiella spp were identified in tracheal aspirate specimens (patient 1). Patients 1, 2 and 4 are alive, but patients 3 and 5 died of respiratory failure, with concurrent congestive heart failure, hepatic encephalopathy, and acute renal failure. Table 2) . Pulmonary specimens from patients 3 and 5 presented more intense changes at optical microscopy. The membranous and respiratory bronchioles were extensively compromised by epithelial necrosis, squamous metaplasia, and obliteration by fibroplasia ( Figure 1A -F). The parenchyma was modified by extensive alveolar collapse, dilatation of the airspaces, alveolar hemorrhage, and sparse hyaline membrane formation ( Figure 1G -I). There was interstitial thickening, with mild to moderate fibroplasia ( Figure 1I ), but a disproportionately sparse infiltrate of inflammatory cells, mainly histiocytes, including multinucleated forms, lymphocytes and megakaryocytes ( Figure 1J-K) .",

Most of our patients were young to middle-aged and had previously been healthy. Increased risk for severe S-OIV illness is found in young children, 10-19 age groups, patients older than 65 years, pregnant women, obese people and those with comorbidities. 1, 7, 20 Fifteen to thirty per cent of patients with H1N1 infection required ICU admission. Mortality among the patients who required mechanical ventilation was around 58%. 7 In our case series the OLB findings showed that the lung damage was most likely due to infection by the influenza virus. The main pathological finding revealed necrotizing bronchiolitis and DAD, respiratory epithelial cells probably being the primary target of the infection. The extensive destruction of the respiratory and AECs and dysfunction in the immune and adaptative immune response led to DAD. As previously reported, possible mechanisms of damage include direct injury to the respiratory and alveolar epithelium exposing the basement membrane and leading to alveolar collapse by loss of surfactant, 13,14,21 with a secondary cytokine storm. 22 This is followed by exudation of macromolecules from the circulation, which finally form hyaline membranes. Activation of the cytokines is part of the immune reaction aiming to eradicate the virus. In this study, the systemic IFNc and TNFa cytokine activation probably resulted in reactive hemophagocytic syndrome in the bronchiole-associated lymphoid tissue and possibly also mediated the epithelial necrosis. 23 A mild inflammatory infiltration is most often seen in viral pneumonias; this has been explained by a cytokine-mediated blockade of lymphocytopoiesis and also by blockade of release from the bone marrow. 24 In our cases, expression in the lung of IFNc by small mononucleated cells and TNFa by macrophages and AECs was low. This finding may be supported by Kim and colleagues, 25 Conversely, we found a very strong expression of IL-4, IL-10 and iNOS by macrophages. The sparse inflammatory and immune reaction found in our samples, which involves targetting of the virus by NK cells, lymphocytes T and B cells, CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte cells, as well as CD1a and S100 cells, may be due to a combination of lymphoid tissue necrosis and apoptosis and exhaustion of lymphoid proliferation in response to the cytokine overdrive. In addition, the high IL-10 expression associated with its anti-inflammatory action may explain the low degree of inflammation observed in our cases. Taken together, our results suggest that in S-OIV infection, altered innate and adaptative immune responses may lead to incomplete virus eradication in the primary target of the infection and, consequently, imbalance between inflammation and reparation, resulting in bronchiolar obliteration and DAD.",

Table 3 -Semiquantitative analysis of electron microscopy. In our current series, pulmonary ultrastructural analysis was important to obtain an understanding of the pathophysiology of this new disease. First, we demonstrated apoptosis and necrosis in the bronchiolar epithelium together with viral-like particles, thus suggesting the bronchiolar epithelium as the primary target of the virus infection. Second, we documented the submicroscopic pattern of a clastogenic DAD in S-OIV infection. Third, we found indirect evidence of virus infection in alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial cells represented by the TRS and CCC. These submicroscopic structures were demonstrated ultrastructurally in the lung tissue of all the patients and their presence suggests an inactivation of the virus by oseltamivir treatment or an altered innate immune response of these patients. They appeared mainly in respiratory cells and AECs and have previously been described in a variety of cell types. 28, 29 Usually, they occur in endothelial cells and lymphocytes from patients with autoimmune diseases and viral infections. 30 Patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome present TRS and CCC in these same cells. 31 The mechanism of TRS and CCC production in vivo is not definitely established. Nevertheless, clinical and experimental studies have shown that the presence of both structures in these diseases is directly associated with the increase of IFNa and IFNb but not with IFNc. 29 One theory to explain the nature and pathogenesis of TRS and CCC suggests that these structures are incomplete viral particles. 30 In our study, these viral-like particles were noted mainly in the respiratory epithelial cells, but not in the other cell types within the lung. These observations reinforce the hypothesis that the primary target cells for S-IOV infection are probably the bronchiolar epithelium. The atypical morphology of the bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells was probably related to viral cytopathic effects or reactive changes. In fact, the presence of multinucleated epithelial cells is not exclusive to S-IOV, and is seen in pneumonia caused by the family of Paramyxoviridae, including parainfluenza viruses, measles, mumps, respiratory syncytial virus and, perhaps, metapneumovirus. 31 Although multinucleated cells were seen in our cases, these probably reflect non-specific secondary changes.",
