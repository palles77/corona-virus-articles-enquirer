            "text": "The ecological success of social insects is based on division of labour, not only between queens 20 and workers, but also among workers. Whether a worker tends the brood or forages is strongly 21 influenced by age, fertility and nutritional status, with brood carers being younger, more fecund 22 and corpulent. Here, we experimentally disentangle behaviour from age and fertility 23 in Temnothorax longispinosus ant workers and analyse how these parameters are linked to 24 whole-body gene expression. Our transcriptome analysis reveals four times more genes 25 associated with behaviour than with age and only few fertility-associated genes. Brood carers 26 exhibited an upregulation of genes involved in lipid biosynthesis, whereas foragers invested in 27 metabolism. Additional simulations revealed that the experimental disassociation of co-varying 28 factors reduces transcriptomic noise, potentially explaining discrepancies between 29 transcriptomic studies on worker behaviour in other social insects. Our study highlights the 30 influence of nutritional status on task choice in ant workers.",

            "text": "Division of labour can be found on all levels of biological organization and has arisen 38 independently during several of the major transitions in evolution, for example during the 39 transition from single cell to multicellular organisms or from solitary to social life [1] . The 40 primary driver for the repeated evolution of division of labour is that it allows cells or group 41 members to specialize on few tasks, thus increase in efficiency and allowing for anatomic or 42 physiological adaptations [2] [3] [4] [5] . 43 The mechanistic underpinnings regulating specialization are complex and intensively 44 investigated on different levels of biological organisation. A highly developed example of 45 division of labour is found in the societies of ants, bees, wasps and termites. In these colonies 46 of social insects, reproduction is monopolized by a single or very few individuals, the queens 47 (and kings in termites), whereas the majority of the colony membersthe workers -remain 48 functionally sterile. All other colony chores are distributed among the workers, which specialize 49 on specific tasks such as brood care, nest defence and foraging [3] . 50 Whether a worker stays inside the nest and cares for the brood or leaves the nest and 51 forages is strongly influenced by age and physiology with brood carers being younger [3], more 52 corpulent [6-14] and more fertile [15, 16] than foragers. Due to high external mortality outside 53 the nest [17], this age-and physiology-based non-reproductive division of labour is beneficial, 54 because it ensures that young workers with longest residual life span, the largest amount of 55 stored resources and the highest reproductive potential stay inside the safety of the nest. 56 Although age and physiology are important regulators of worker task choice in many 57 social insects, few common mechanisms linking age and physiology to behaviour have been 58 found. For example, the switch from brood care to foraging is at least partly regulated by an 59 interaction between age and stable lipid loss [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] 18, 19] . Information on the nutritional status 60 are transported to and in the brain via Target of rapamycin (TOR) and Insulin/Insulin-like 61 signalling (IIS) pathways [12, [20] [21] [22] [23] .

In other 70 social insects, this linkage between JH, Vg and behaviour is similar [23,38-40], absent [41] or 71 reversed [42-44]. Moreover, Vg underwent multiple duplications in ants with different 72 orthologs taking over specific functions in the regulation of fertility and behaviour [31,45-49]. 73 In honey bees, the foraging gene is highly expressed in the optical lobes and mushroom bodies 74 of forager' brains [50,51], causing an elevated sucrose responsiveness and the onset of foraging 75 behaviour [52,53]. The expression of foraging in other social insects is either positively [54-76 56] or negatively [57-59] linked to foraging behaviour and additionally influenced by age [60], 77 social structure [30], body size [54,58] and time of the day [61]. The manganese transporter 78 malvolio is upregulated in foragers, which induces precocious foraging behaviour by increasing 79 sucrose responsiveness in honey bees [62]. Similar to Vg, malvolio underwent duplication and 80 subfunctionalization in multiple social and subsocial insects, which raises the question as to 81 whether the role of malvolio in honey bees can be extended to other insects [63]. The 82 neuromodulators tyramine and its precursor octopamine promote the onset of foraging, are 83 involved into the rewarding system in honey bee foragers and increase gustatory responsiveness 84 [28,64-66], but their role in other species is unknown.",

Gene expression of T. longispinosus brood carers was largely represented by 330 lipid transport and lipid biosynthesis (energy storage; Figure 3). Nutritional status, with 331 corpulent brood carers and food deprived foragers, is one of the most widespread and consistent 332 factors mediating worker behaviour [10,19], and influences gene expression in honey bees 333 [12,18,22,25,26,28] and wasps [29]. In ants however, despite the broad correlative evidence for 334 brood carers harbouring more lipid storages than foragers [6-9,14,94,95], clear transcriptomic 335 signatures of nutritional status have so far not been found [30,31]. Only a single study identified 336 lipid storage and fatty acid metabolism to be enriched functions of genes differentially 337 expressed between brood carers and foragers [96]. In that study however, transcriptomes of 338 young brood carers and old foragers were compared. As lipid storages in experimentally hive-339 restricted bees are reduced with age and age-dependent reduction in lipid storages has been 340 found in Drosophila males [12,97], it remained unclear whether observed nutrition linked gene 341 expression is associated with behaviour or with age. Interestingly, we found an increased 342 investment into lipid biosynthesis in brood carers independent from age. In honey bees, reverted 343 brood carers do not refill their lipid storages [19] and future research should therefore test 344whether old workers in ants, which return to brood caring duties are able to regain lipid storages.345Among the genes upregulated in brood carers, we found multiple fat body expressed 346 copies of egg yolk precursor and storage protein Vg (Vg-like A, MVg2, MVg3; Kohlmeier et al.",

However, this Vg copy was not differentially 354 expressed in our study (see Kohlmeier et al. in subm. for a Vg phylogeny).

For example, among the overexpressed genes was Insulin-like growth 364 factor-binding protein complex acid labile chain, which is involved in binding of Insulin-like 365 growth factor (IGF) and part of the IIS pathway [98]. Despite the clear transcriptomic signatures 366 of nutritional status and metabolism, multiple candidate genes that are part of the cross-talk 367 between IIS and TOR (i.e. malvolio, foraging, Tyramine) were not differentially expressed.

As age and fertility additionally influence gene expression[22,28,67,68], studies that did not experimentally control for age and physiology when comparing gene expression between brood carers and foragers [e.g. 28,31,46,56,57,69-73] might have produced results driven not only by behaviour, but also by age and fertility. Such confounded transcriptomic analyses are not a problem specific to research on insect behaviour but occur across study systems and contexts.For instance, the degree of tissue heterogeneity, i.e. different numbers of cell types present in a tissue, potentially confounds studies comparing gene expression of different tissues [73]. Thus, confounding factors are an important and partly neglected problem when investigating the transcriptomic underpinnings and mechanisms of different traits in general and non-",

In respect to expression changes with age, we detected investment in muscles in young workers, and no evidence for age-dependant expression of typical longevity genes. We thus provide evidence that experimentally controlling for confounding factors such as age or behaviour will increase resolution and decrease transcriptomic noise in future RNAseq studies.",
