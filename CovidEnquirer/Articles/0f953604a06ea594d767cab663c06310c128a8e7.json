            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a serious infectious threat to public health. To create a novel trial vaccine and evaluate its potency, we attempted to generate a SARS inactivated vaccine using SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) strain F69 treated with formaldehyde and mixed with Al(OH) 3 . Three doses of the vaccine were used to challenge three groups of BALB/c mice. We found that the mice exhibited specific IgM on day 4 and IgG on day 8. The peak titers of IgG were at day 47 in low-dose group (1:19,200) and high-dose group (1:38,400) whereas in middle-dose group (1:19,200), the peak was at day 40. On day 63, the IgG levels reached a plateau. Neutralization assay demonstrated that the antisera could protect Vero-E6 cells from SARS-CoV's infection. Analysis of the antibody specificity revealed that the mouse antisera contained a mixture of antibodies specifically against the structure proteins of SARS-CoV. Furthermore, the mouse antisera conferred higher amount of antibodies against protein N, polypeptide S4 and S2 than those of proteins M and 3CL. These findings suggest that the inactivated SARS-CoV could preserve its antigenicity and the inactivated vaccine can stimulate mice to produce high levels of antibodies with neutralization activity. Results also suggest that polypeptides originating from protein N or S might be a potential target for the generation of a recombinant SARS vaccine.",

Recent studies reported that the DNA vaccines targeting protein S or N could induce several events including the production of specific Abs and/or the activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and protective immunity in mice [11] [12] [13] . A highly attenuated modified vaccinia virus Ankara containing the gene encoding full-length SARS-CoV S was also proved to be able to induce protective immunity in mice [14] . Here, we showed for the first time that the Abs specific to proteins N, S4 and S2 are stronger than other structureprotein specific Abs induced by inactivated vaccine. Sui et al. [15] recently reported a potent neutralization McAb, the epitope of which was located within the N-terminal 261-672 amino acids of protein S. In accordance with their observations, we found that the level of S2-specific Ab predominated in mice sera. From these results and other antigenicity analysis of SARS-CoV structure protein, we propose that protein S and/or N may be a potential subunit for an effective vaccine.",
