This application allows the identification of phylogenetic clusters and genotypes from assembled genomes in FASTA format. Since its release in 2019, we have produced a number of typing tools for emergent viruses that have caused large outbreaks, such as Zika and Yellow Fever Virus in Brazil. Here, we present The Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool that can accurately identify novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) sequences isolated in China and around the world. The tool can accept up to 2,000 sequences per submission and the analysis of a new whole genome sequence will take approximately one minute. The tool has been tested and validated with hundreds of whole genomes from ten coronavirus species, and correctly classified all of the SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) and all of the available public data for 2019-nCoV. The tool also allows tracking of new viral mutations as the outbreak expands globally, which may help to accelerate the development of novel diagnostics, drugs and vaccines.",

            "text": "This coronavirus outbreak has been unprecedented; so too is the way that the scientific community has responded to it. They have openly and rapidly shared genomic and clinical data as never seen before allowing research results to be released almost instantaneously. This has helped the understanding of the transmission dynamics, the development of rapid diagnostic and has informed public health response. Here, we present a new contribution that can speed up this communal effort. The Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool is a free-of-charge web-based bioinformatics pipeline that can accurately and quickly identify, assemble and classify coronaviruses genomes. The tool also identifies changes at nucleotides, coding regions and proteins using a novel dynamic aligner to allow tracking new viral mutations (Figure 1 ). To this reference dataset, we added 47 whole genomes of the current Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) outbreak that originated in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The 2019-nCoV sequences were downloaded from the GISAID database (https://www.gisaid.org) together with annotation of its original location, collection date and originating and submitting laboratory. The 2019-nCoV data generators are properly acknowledged in the acknowledgements section of this paper and detailed information is provided in Supplementary Table 1. The 431 reference WGS were aligned with MUSCLE (Edgar 2004) . The alignment was manually edited until a codon alignment was attained in all coding sequences (CDS). A Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree, 1000 bootstrap replicates was constructed in PhyML (Guidon & Gascuel 2003; Lemoine et al., 2018) and a Bayesian tree using MrBayes (Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003) were constructed. The trees were visualized in Figtree (Rambaut 2018). We selected 25 reference sequences that represent the diversity of each well-defined phylogenetic cluster (with bootstrap support of 100% and posterior probability of 1). We identified five well supported phylogenetic clusters with more than two sequences of SARSr-CoV and used them to set up our automated phylogenetic classification tool. Cluster 1 included SARS strains from the 2002 and 2003 Asian outbreaks. In our tool, we named this cluster SARS-CoV Outbreak 2000s but may rename it as SARS-A if a new proposed naming system for SARSr-Cov is adopted in the near future (Rambaut 2020). Cluster 2 (provisionally named as SARS related CoV) includes 7 sequences from bats which did not cause large human outbreaks. Cluster 3 (named as Bat SARS-CoV HKU3) includes three WGS sampled from Rhinolophus sinicus (i.e. Chinese rufous horseshoe bats). Cluster 4 (Bat SARS-CoV ZXC21/ZC45) includes two SARSr-CoV sampled from Rhinolophus sinicus bats in Zhoushan, China. Cluster 5 (provisionally named as Wuhan 2019-nCoV, which may be renamed as SARS-B) includes one public sequence from the outbreak in Wuhan, China. We identified this cluster with many sequences from GISAID but kept only this one as this is the only GenBank sequence, accession number MN908947, which was kindly shared by Prof. Yong-Zhen Zhang and colleagues in the virological.org website. Detailed information about the phylogenetic reference datasets are available in Supplementary Table 2. The phylogenetic reference dataset was used to create an automated Coronavirus Typing Tool using the Genome Detective framework (Vilsker et al., 2019 . To determine the accuracy of this tool, each of the 431 test WGS was considered for evaluation (i.e. 384 reference sequences from VIPR and 47 public 2019-nCoV sequences). The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of our method was calculated for both species assignment and phylogenetic clustering of SARSr-CoV. Sensitivity was computed by the formula Classifying query sequences in an automated fashion involves two steps. The first step enables virus species assignments and the second, which is restricted to SARSr-CoV, includes phylogenetic analysis. The first classification analysis subjects a query sequence to BLAST and AGA analysi. AGA is a novel alignment method for nucleic acid sequences against annotated genomes from NCBI RefSeq Virus Database. AGA (Deforche 2017) expands the optimal alignment algorithms of Smith-Waterman (Smith & Waterman 1981) and Gotoh (Gotoh 1982) based on an induction state with additional parameters. The result is a more accurate aligner, as it takes into account both nucleotide and protein scores and identifies all of the polymorphisms at nucleotide and amino acid levels. In the second step, a query sequence is aligned against the phylogenetic reference dataset using -add alignment option in the MAFFT software (Katoh & Standley 2013) . In addition, a Neighbor Joining phylogenetic tree is constructed using the HKY distance metric with gamma among-site rate variation with 1,000 bootstrap replicates using PAUP* (Swofford) . The query sequence is assigned to a particular phylogenetic cluster if it clusters monophyletically with that clade or a subset of it with bootstrap support >70%. If the bootstrap support is <70%, the genotype is reported to be unassigned.",

In addition, we classified with very high specificity, sensitivity and accuracy (i.e. 100%) all of the 112 SARS outbreak WGS of 2002 and 2003. We also achieved perfect classification (i.e. specificity, sensitivity and accuracy of 100%) for all of Beta coronavirus, Human_coronavirus_HKU1, MERS-CoV, Rousettus_bat_coronavirus_HKU9 and Tylonycteris_bat_coronavirus_HKU4 at species level.

In total, 94.8% (73/77) of the amino acids were identical; the four amino acid differences were located at positions 55 (T55S), 56 (V56F), 69 (69deletion) and 70 (G70R). The spike protein (protein S), which can be associated with virulence, was 76.2% identical to the reference strain of SARSr-CoV (Supplementary Table 4A ). Interestingly there were four amino acid insertions at position 237 (A237_F238insHRSY, genome NT position 22202_22203insCATAGAAGTTAT)), which is just upstream from a cleavage site. The most diverse coding regions were the CDS Sars8a and Sars8b. In these two regions, only 30% of the amino acids were identical. Sars8b protein was truncated early and its CDS had four stop codons (Supplementary Table 4sA ).",

These two differences were located on positions: 22551G>T & 26016G>T), which caused three amino acid mutations (E2 glycoprotein Protein mutation: V354F (22551G>T) , sars3a protein mutations: G250V (26016G>T) and sars3b protein mutations: V110F (26016G>T)) (Detailed in Supplementary  Table 4C -II). The analysis of a WGS in FASTA format takes approximately 60 seconds.",

Moreover, it can easily be updated to add new phylogenetic clusters if new outbreaks arise or if the classification nomenclature changes.

A user can submit up to 1Gb of NGS data or 2,000 assembled genomic sequences. For each assembled genomic sequence, the tool identifies the virus species, constructs a phylogenetic tree and identifies phylogenetic clusters, which includes the novel coronavirus identified in Wuhan China in 2019 (2019-nCoV). The tool identifies changes at nucleotides, coding regions and proteins using a novel dynamic aligner and display all of the mutations in detailed tables and reports.SYSTEMS AND METHODSA reference dataset of previously published coronavirus whole genome sequences (WGS) was compiled from the Virus Pathogen Resource (VIPR) database(www.viprbrc.org). This dataset consisted of 386 whole genome sequences (WGS) of nine important coronavirus species. These included 132 sequences of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome related Coronavirus (SARSr-CoV), 121 sequences of Beta coronavirus, 97 sequences of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome related Coronavirus (MERSr-CoV), 19 sequences of Human Coronavirus HKU1, 9 sequences of Murine Hepatitis Virus, 4 of Rousettus Bat Coronavirus HKU9, 3 of Rat Coronavirus and one WGS of Tylonycteris Bat Coronavirus HKU4, Zaria_bat_coronavirus and Longquan Rl Rat coronavirus).",
