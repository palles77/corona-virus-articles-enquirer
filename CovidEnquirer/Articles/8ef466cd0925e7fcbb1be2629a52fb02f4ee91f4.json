            "text": "In association with the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), anti-inflammatory response syndrome is commonly manifested in patients with trauma, burn injury, and after major surgery. These patients are increasingly susceptible to infection with various pathogens due to the excessive release of anti-inflammatory cytokines from anti-inflammatory effector cells. Recently, CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) found in the sera of mice with pancreatitis was identified as an active molecule for SIRS-associated anti-inflammatory response manifestation. Also, the inhibitory activity of glycyrrhizin (GL) on CCL2 production was reported. Therefore, the effect of GL on SIRS-associated anti-inflammatory response manifestation was investigated in a murine SIRS model. Without any stimulation, splenic T cells from mice 5 days after SIRS induction produced cytokines associated with anti-inflammatory response manifestation. However, these cytokines were not produced by splenic T cells from SIRS mice previously treated with GL. In dual-chamber transwells, IL-4-producing cells were generated from normal T cells cultured with peripheral blood polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) from SIRS mice. However, IL-4-producing cells were not generated from normal T cells in transwell cultures performed with PMN from GL-treated SIRS mice. CCL2 was produced by PMN from SIRS mice, while this chemokine was not demonstrated in cultures of PMN from SIRS mice treated with GL. These results indicate that GL has the capacity to suppress SIRS-associated anti-inflammatory response manifestation through the inhibition of CCL2 production by PMN.",

            "text": "The systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) frequently develops in patients with polytrauma, severe burn injury, and after major surgery [1] . SIRS is a systemic inflammatory reaction developed from local inflammatory responses against injured tissues or a local infection [1] . Infections demonstrated in patients with SIRS are classi-fied as sepsis [1] . Severe SIRS is accompanied by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), ultimately leading to multiple organ failure (MOF), resulting in death [1] . Therefore, the clinical course of patients with polytrauma, severe burn injury, and after major surgery appears strongly associated with the manifestations of SIRS [2] [3] [4] [5] . The overwhelming systemic pro-inflammatory reaction caused by SIRS leads to an overactive anti-inflammatory response [6] . Anti-inflammatory response appears to regulate the inflammatory responses during SIRS [6] . Anti-inflammatory response appeared in association with SIRS is defined as impaired HLA-DR expression (less than 30% as compared to healthy controls) and an increase in the plasma concentration of Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13) [7] [8] [9] . The susceptibility of patients with SIRS-associated anti-inflammatory response to infections increases greatly due to Th2 cytokine-associated immunosuppression [7] [8] [9] . Previously, we have demonstrated how SIRS decreases the host's anti-bacterial resistance [10] . Mice with severe pancreatitis (a murine model of representative SIRS) were susceptible to sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) [11] . In addition, CC chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) in the circulation has been shown to contribute to the increased susceptibility of these mice to CLP-induced sepsis [12] .",

In Japan, GL has been used clinically for more than 20 years in patients with chronic hepatitis [13, 14] . GL has an antiviral activity against human cytomegalovirus [15] , herpes simplex virus type 2 [16] , influenza virus [17] , HIV [18] [19] [20] , and coronavirus [21] . Recently, GL has been described as an inhibitor of CCL2 production in cultures of human monocytes infected with M-tropic HIV [22] . Therefore, in this study the regulatory effect of GL on SIRS-associated anti-inflammatory response manifestation was investigated in a mouse model of SIRS. In this study, we chose to use the term ''SIRS'' for the SIRS-like syndrome in mice, although the strict definition of SIRS as applied in humans cannot be applied in animals. The results show that GL down-regulates SIRS-associated anti-inflammatory response manifestations through the inhibition of CCL2 production by polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN).",

Recombinant murine TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, and CCL2 were obtained from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). T cells were prepared from the spleens of normal or SIRS mice through the use of T cell enrichment columns (R&D Systems), as previously described [23] . The purity of these cells was greater than 96%, as described previously [23] . As previously described, PMN were isolated from whole peripheral blood using Ficoll-Hypaque and dextran sedimentations [24] . Briefly, peripheral blood was withdrawn from the heart of mice with a heparinized syringe. The peripheral blood was centrifuged with Ficoll-Hypaque, and precipitates were obtained as a PMN rich fraction. Then, precipitates were suspended in 1% dextran (T-500, Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ) and kept for 1 h at room temperature to allow the sedimentation of residual erythrocytes. The resulting PMN fraction was further treated with erythrocyte-lysing kits (R&D Systems) to eliminate small amounts of erythrocytes. The purity of the PMNs obtained was routinely more than 93%, when analyzed by flow cytometry with FITCconjugated anti-Gr-1 mAb and Write-Giemsa/ALP stainings. Monocytes were not contained in these PMN preparations, when analyzed using PE-conjugated anti-F4/80 mAb (specific for mouse macrophages/monocytes) and a FACScan flow cytometer. For cultivation, various cell preparations were resuspended in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin and 100 lg/ml streptomycin) (culture medium).",

            "text": "As a regulatory mechanism of SIRS, anti-inflammatory response usually appears in response to SIRS development [6] . However, some of the important host defenses against infections are depressed by anti-inflammatory response through the excessive production of IL-4 and IL-10 [7] [8] [9] . Therefore, severe infections are frequently observed in individuals with anti-inflammatory response [7] [8] [9] . Our previous study showed that anti-inflammatory response manifests in SIRS mice in response to CCL2 produced by PMN from SIRS mice [30] . Recently, we have demonstrated that GL has an ability to inhibit CCL2 production by human peripheral blood monocytes infected with HIV [22] . In this study, the effect of GL on SIRS-associated anti-inflammatory response manifestation was investigated in a murine SIRS model. Anti-inflammatory effector cells (splenic T cells acquired the ability to produce IL-4 and IL-10) were generated in mice 5 days after SIRS induction. At this time, IFN-c production by these T cells was not demonstrated. The production of IL-4 and IL-10 by T cells from SIRS mice was reduced by treatment with GL. However, the production of IFN-c by T cells from SIRS mice was not influenced by treatment with GL (data not shown). In dual-chamber transwells, T cells from non-SIRS mice (normal T cells) converted to IL-4-producing cells after cultivation with PMN from SIRS mice. However, normal T cells did not convert to IL-4-producing cells when the same transwell cultures were performed with PMN from SIRS mice treated with GL. Similarly, T cells from normal mice (lower chamber) cultured with normal mouse PMN (upper chamber) did not produce IL-10 into their culture fluids, while normal T cells cultured with SIRS mouse PMN acquired an ability to produce IL-10. However, IL-10 was not produced by normal T cells cultured with PMN from GL-treated SIRS mice. Also, IFN-c was not detected in culture fluids of transwell-cultured T cells from normal mice (lower chamber) and SIRS mouse PMN (upper chamber). PMN from SIRS mice produced CCL2, but the same cell preparations from GL-treated SIRS mice did not.",

In the results, T cells stimulated with CCL2 produced 600 pg/ml of IL-4 into their culture fluids. Similarly, IL-4 was produced by the same T cells after cultivation with GL.

Typical SIRS indicators, such as multiple organ failure (amylase, GPT, and GOT) and inflammation (TNF-a, IL-1b), were found in the sera of mice with pancreatitis. These mice also had a decrease in body temperature (<36\u00b0C) and white blood cell count (<2000/mm 3 ). When SIRS mice were treated with GL (10 mg/kg, i.p.) 1 h after SIRS induction, these SIRS indicators were unchanged.

Previously, we had reported that the anti-HIV activity of GL was mediated, in part, by inhibiting CCL2 production during HIV infection [22] . However, the precise molecular mechanism of this inhibitory effect remains unclear. Several studies have indicated that the enhancer region of the CCL2 gene is inhibited by glucocorticoids [31] , progesterone [32] , and estrogen [33] . This enhancer region is a part of nuclear factor-jB (NF-jB). These reports suggest that the inhibition of CCL2 gene expression by these hormones might be mediated through the inhibition of NF-jB binding to the CCL2 gene. Since GL is a conjugate of a molecule of glycyrrhetinic acid (a steroid like structure) and two molecules of glucuronic acid, GL may inhibit NF-jB binding to the CCL2 gene through its influence on hormone receptors. Further studies are required to clarify the molecular mechanism for inhibiting CCL2 production by GL.",

The first population of M/ recruited follows activation by the engagement of Toll-like receptors [34] or the binding of IFN receptors [35] . These classically activated M/ display a strong potential to eradicate infections with Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium avium complex, Salmonella typhimurium, Trypanosoma cruzi, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and influenza virus [38] . In addition, classically activated M/ have been characterized as the major effector cells on host resistance against CLPinduced infections [39] . This indicates that classically activated M/ induction is a key to controlling infections. On the other hand, it has become recognized that M/ can be activated by an alternative pathway involving IL-4 and IL-13 [37] . These alternatively activated M/ have been implicated in performing various immunosuppressive roles [38, 40] . Since IL-4 is able to suppress transcriptional activation of IFN-c-and LPS-responsive genes in M/ [40] , classically activated M/ are not generated in circumstances where alternatively activated M/ predominate. This may explain why patients with anti-inflammatory response that appeared in association with SIRS are susceptible to various opportunistic infections.",
