The benefit of citrus was dismissed as unproven despite the fact that its regular consumption to prevent scurvy had been used by some cultures since antiquity and the English military had recommended citrus for scurvy for more than 50 years. In 1747, Scottish physician James Lind chose 12 sailors suffering from scurvy for a clinical trial. Those treated with citrus fruit quickly recovered. In Lind's day, it was not known that vitamin C was necessary for the maintenance of healthy connective tissue. Today, people around the world are spending billions of dollars annually on vitamins and supplements despite limited scientific evidence that regular supplementation is useful for the prevention of disease. A recent article concluded that \"\u03b2-carotene, vitamin E, and possibly high doses of vitamin A sup ple ments are harmful\" and that \"other antioxidants . . . are ineffective for preventing mortality or morbidity.\" 1 How and when are vitamins and supplements useful?",
