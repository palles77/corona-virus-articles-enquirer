Groups 1-4 received 100, 200, 400 and 800 mg/L of sodium new houttuyfonate (SNH) with IB vaccine H120 respectively. Group 5 received PBS and H120 and group 6 IL-2 and H120. The chickens were inoculated at 7 and 14 days of age. On 0, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35 post first vaccination, the dynamic changes of peripheral lymphocyte proliferation, cytokine assays and serum antibody titers were assayed respectively by MTT method, ELISA and hemagglutination inhibition assay (HI). The results showed that sodium new houttuyfonate significantly raised IB antibody titer in the chickens and also markedly promoted lymphocyte proliferation. The serum levels of IFN-c and IL-4 in groups 1-4 were higher than those in groups 5 and 6. Hence, the immunologic enhancement of SNH was slightly superior to that of IL-2 adjuvant. Following challenge with IBV, chickens inoculated with SNH showed fewer and less severe clinical signs, lower death rate and less kidney pathology, as compared to those of the control groups. It indicated that SNH could enhance immune responses and increase protection against virulent IBV challenge in chickens.",

Infectious bronchitis (IB) is an acute and highly contagious respiratory disease of chickens, and is still a major health problem in the chicken industry. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), an enveloped coronavirus containing an unsegmented, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome, is one of the primary causes of respiratory disease in domestic fowl. Infection with IBV reduces the performance of broilers and causes drops in egg production and egg quality (Bijlenga et al., 2004; Cavanagh and Naqi, 2003; Cavanagh, 2003) . There are problems with vaccines against infectious bronchitis applied in the field. Live attenuated vaccine may spread to unvaccinated flocks (Farsang et al., 2002) ; inactivated vaccine does not elicit an immune response against coronavirus (Yang et al., 2004; Stohlman et al., 1992) , and severe side effects and long-lasting local response may occurs after inoculation.",

HI tests are mostly used to monitor antibody levels induced by IBV live attenuated vaccine. Therefore, the HI titer was considered the key factor in the appraisal of the vaccine adjuvant in this study. Although the maternal antibody IBV titers influence the results, the final result indicated no influence. The co-administration of antigen and SNH increased HI titers, and the titers of the SNH groups were significantly higher than those of the PBS or IL groups, which confirmed that SNH could improve antibody formation.
