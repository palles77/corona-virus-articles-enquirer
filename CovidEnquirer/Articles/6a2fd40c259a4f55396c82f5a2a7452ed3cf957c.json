Results: 110 pilgrims from South Senegal were included. The duration of stay in Touba was 3 days. 41.8% and 14.5% pilgrims reported respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. Most individuals having the onset of symptoms during their stay in Touba, or soon after returning. The acquisition of rhinoviruses, coronaviruses and adenovirus was 13.0, 16.7 and 4.6% respectively and that of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae was 3.7% and 26.9%.",

Further study including larger numbers of pilgrims are needed to investigate potential risk factors for respiratory and gastrointestinal infections at the Grand Magal.",

About 4-5 million Mourid participate to the celebration each year, coming from across Senegal and the surrounding countries, as well as from countries outside Africa, making this event the largest Muslim religious mass gathering in West-Africa. The two central events of the Magal are visits to the Great Mosque of Touba, which involves a partial circumambulation of the mosque, and to the mausoleum of Cheikh Ahmadou Bamba. Pilgrims also visit the mausoleums of several other important Mouride leaders who were descendants of the Cheikh. The Mosque area is a secluded place surrounded by walls, within the city. The access to the Mosque area is allowed to everyone (including tourists) but flows are regulated by security staffs. In addition, pilgrims visit places in Touba that are associated with the holy life of the Cheikh, including the \"Well of Mercy,\" a spring which sacred water is reputed to be able to heal all sorts of illnesses and misfortune. A visit to the central library of Touba which contains the writings of the Cheikh and other influential Mouride theologians, and to the Mouride University are among the other places visited by pilgrims. Finally, pilgrims visit their personal Mouride spiritual guides, or Marabouts who receive their followers in their personal residence in the city. Recitation of the Koran and spiritual introspection complete these religious activities. During the Grand Magal period, in addition to the religious celebrations, intense cultural activity takes place including conferences, seminaries, and debates between representatives of various Muslims communities from Senegal and from the diaspora. Recitation of poems by Ahmadou Bamba, and collective hymn-singing sessions are organized at night, in the streets, under large open tents. Informally, pilgrims also visit Touba's large temporary marketplace, one of the biggest in the country where a wide range of products can be found with prices lower than those of any other market in Senegal.",

Villages are divided in concessions where individuals from a same family live in close contact. The population in the villages was 991 (510 Ndiop and 481 Dielmo) in 2017, including about 50% Mourides, part of whom did not travel to Touba because of limited financial resources. All pilgrims participating to the 2017 Magal in these villages were invited to participate in our study and were identified by the nurses in charge of the primary health care centers in both villages. At inclusion, the pilgrims were questioned using a standardized questionnaire. This questionnaire addressed demographics, chronic medical conditions and vaccination status against influenza. In Touba, pilgrims were housed in different concrete houses; three groups in three family houses and others in different Marabout houses. Health issues occurring during and after the Magal, were recorded by a nurse who travelled with the group of pilgrims. Housing location in Touba and use of preventive measures (face mask, disposable handkerchiefs, hand washing with soap hand disinfectant) were investigated by questionnaires during the stay in Touba. The consumption of antibiotics was also documented through post-travel questionnaires. Influenza like illness (ILI) was defined as the association of cough, sore throat and fever [2] . Diarrhea was defined by at least three loose or liquid stools per day.",

The Grand Magal pilgrimage in Touba Senegal qualifies for the WHO mass gathering definition [15] . This is the first report addressing the morbidity in a cohort of pilgrims at the Grand Magal. Publications about Grand Magal associated diseases are scarce. A cholera outbreak involving 12,135 patients in the Grand Magal area occurred in 2004-2006, with a total of 29,556 cases reported over an 18-month in the country [16] . In 2018, a dengue outbreak was associated to the Grand Magal [17, 18] . As described in the introduction, our group provided overall figures of syndromic surveillance data during the 2015 Grand Magal. The most frequent reasons for consultation were trauma, followed by fatigue and heatstroke. Infectious diseases were also prevalent with, notably, a high rate of febrile systemic illnesses and malaria, diarrheal diseases, and respiratory tract infections [1] . In our study, the population was characterized by the young age of participants with 26.4% children and only few elderly pilgrims, in marked contrast with the characteristics of Hajj pilgrims [19] . Indeed, the Grand Magal is a familial event and many adult pilgrims travel with their children. As a consequence of the young age of participants, the prevalence of chronic conditions was low, as opposed to Hajj pilgrims [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Also, in comparison with the Hajj pilgrimage, where pilgrims stay in Saudi Arabia for around 3 weeks [19] , we note that the duration of stay in Touba during the Grand Magal is shorter (3 days) ( Table 5) .",

            "text": "The vaccination rate against influenza was dramatically low. The use of face masks was rare, while 2/3 of pilgrims declared using hand sanitizer. The overall prevalence of respiratory symptoms was high, affecting 42% participants and a 4.8 fold increase was observed following the participation to the Grand Magal. This result is in line with studies conducted at the Hajj, where 50-93% pilgrims presented respiratory symptoms [24] . Gastrointestinal symptoms were less frequent, affecting 15% individuals, but three times more frequent after participation in the Grand Magal. Overall, these symptoms were relatively mild leading to a low proportion of antibiotic consumption (12.5% ill pilgrims) and no pilgrim was hospitalized. However, 91.3% and 43.8% of pilgrims still had respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, respectively when they returned home, which can be a source of infection for their family members. Acquisition of respiratory viruses and H. influenzae at the Grand Magal was common, as observed in the setting of the Hajj pilgrimage [24] . We found no evidence for increased transmission of respiratory infections between individuals from a same concession or from a same housing location in Touba which suggests that respiratory infections may have resulted from contacts with the overall population in Touba in overcrowding areas, in and around the Mosque rather than from intra-familiar or intra-domiciliar transmission. Our survey has several limitations, including its small sample size and the fact that most pilgrims came from a single village. Also, the short time between inclusion and post-Magal questionnaire administration and testing makes it difficult to establish a formal link between symptoms and pathogen acquisition and pilgrimage participation. Another limitation is that we did not investigate Mycobacterium tuberculosis prevalence in our study. However, given the long incubation time of tuberculosis and the short duration of stay of pilgrims in Touba, PCRbased detection of M. tuberculosis in relation to the event would not have been feasible. Finally, the proportion of participant who provided paired samples of stool specimen was low. Further study including larger numbers of pilgrims are needed to investigate potential risk factors for respiratory and gastrointestinal infections at the Grand Magal. Nevertheless, this preliminary study confirms that Grand Magal pilgrims are likely to be exposed to communicable disease risk, as observed in other pilgrimage settings, despite the relatively short duration of the event.",
