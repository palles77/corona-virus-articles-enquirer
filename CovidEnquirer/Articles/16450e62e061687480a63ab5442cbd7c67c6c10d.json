Materials and methods: The clinical and imaging data of 11 cases diagnosed as H7N9 subtype of human avian influenza were collected from 4 cities in the southern region of the Yangtze River, China. The chest imaging manifestations were analyzed by the assigned expert group. The analyzed cases include 7 males and 4 females aged from 20 to 84 years, with a mean of 55.6 years. The clinical symptoms were mainly fever (100%, 11/11) and cough (72.7%, 8/11). Results: Segmental or lobar ground-glass opacity (GGO) or consolidation was shown in 8 cases (72.7% or 8/11). Air bronchogram was found in 7 cases (63.6% or 7/11). The lesions developed into multiple or diffuse in both lungs rapidly at the progressive stage. The reticulation shadows were shown after some lesions absorbed at the stable stage. Conclusions: The characteristic imaging demonstrations of H7N9 subtype of human avian influenza are segmental or lobar exudative lesions at lungs at the initial stage, which rapidly progress into bilateral distribution at lungs at the progressive stage.",

The clinical findings of the 11 patients from our group that had been confirmatively diagnosed as infection of H7N9 subtype of avian influenza virus reveal that rapid progress is characteristic of this disease.

We believe that the pathological mechanism of infection of H7N9 subtype of avian influenza virus may resemble to other viral pneumonia and is based on alveolar exudation. The lesions can develop into either multiple or diffuse at both lungs with rapid progress at the progressive stage, or reticulation when the abnormalities improve later into the later stage (after 20 days) [5, 6] . According to the evolution process by radiology, infection of H7N9 subtype of avian influenza virus can be divided into three stages. The initial stage is the first 3 days after onset. The progressive stage is the period of d 3-15 after onset. Period since d 15 after onset is defined as the stable stage. The stable stage is protracted for some cases due to the remaining viral infection in addition with bacterial infections. Pleural effusions are rarely seen and lymph node enlargement is not significant.",

Bacterial pneumonia usually shows lobar consolidation and increased WBC clinically, which can recover quickly by antibiotic therapy. The imaging findings of H7N9 subtype infection of avian influenza virus resemble to those of H5N1 subtype infection of avian influenza virus, both of which have pulmonary segment or lobar exudative lesions as the predominant imaging findings except that multifocal consolidations have a predilection at lower lobes in cases of H5N1 subtype infection of avian influenza virus [11] .
