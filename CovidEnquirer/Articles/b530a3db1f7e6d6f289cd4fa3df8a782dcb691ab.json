We aimed to determine the contribution of common pathogens to pneumonia adjusting for rates of asymptomatic detection to inform future diagnosis, treatment and preventive strategies. Methods a case-control study was conducted among children <18 years in Perth, Western australia. cases were children hospitalised with radiologically confirmed pneumonia; controls were healthy children identified from outpatient and local immunisation clinics. nasopharyngeal swabs were collected and tested for 14 respiratory viruses and 6 bacterial species by Polymerase chain reaction (Pcr). For each pathogen, adjusted odds ratio (aOr; 95% ci) was calculated using multivariate logistic regression and population-attributable fraction (95% ci) for pneumonia was estimated. Results From May 2015 to October 2017, 230 cases and 230 controls were enrolled. at least one respiratory virus was identified in 57% of cases and 29% of controls (aOr: 4.7; 95% ci: 2.8 to 7.8). at least one bacterial species was detected in 72% of cases and 80% of controls (aOr: 0.7; 95% ci: 0.4 to 1.2). respiratory syncytial virus (rSV) detection was most strongly associated with pneumonia (aOr: 58.4; 95% ci: 15.6 to 217.5). Mycoplasma pneumoniae was the only bacteria associated with pneumonia (aOr: 14.5; 95% ci: 2.2 to 94.8). We estimated that rSV, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), influenza, adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were responsible for 20.2% (95% ci: 14.6 to 25.5), 9.8% (5.6% to 13.7%), 6.2% (2.5% to 9.7%), 4% (1.1% to 7.1%) and 7.2% (3.5% to 10.8%) of hospitalisations for childhood pneumonia, respectively. Conclusions respiratory viruses, particularly rSV and HMPV, are major contributors to pneumonia in australian children.",

These sensitive techniques have enabled detection of viruses in up to 92% of respiratory specimens of children with pneumonia.

The proportion of children with pneumonia in whom RSV was detected was consistent with that reported in previous studies. 8-10 19 28 In contrast, few control children in our study were RSV positive (3%), also consistent with the published literature. 11 14 20 30 Another member from the paramyxoviridae family, HMPV, was detected in 10% of cases but infrequently detected in healthy controls. The high adjusted OR for the detection of RSV and HMPV in children with pneumonia strongly implicates these viruses as probable pneumonia-causing pathogens. RSV is well established as a major cause of lower respiratory tract infection. 31 This study adds to the growing evidence that HMPV is also an important respiratory pathogen in young children. 9 11 20 32 33 Children with pneumonia were also more likely to have influenza detected. Influenza is well documented to cause severe and occasionally fatal respiratory infection. 34 All influenza-positive cases and controls were unvaccinated. Low influenza vaccination has been reported among children with influenza-confirmed pneumonia previously. 35 Consistent with a protective effect, improved uptake of seasonal influenza vaccine in children is likely to reduce hospitalisations for pneumonia. RV was detected in similar proportions of children with (15%) and without (21%) pneumonia. Previous studies also detected RV in both children with pneumonia 9 11 27 28 as well as in apparently asymptomatic children. 14 36 The latter raises doubt about the contribution of RV in pneumonia. 37 Our finding is in line with other case-control studies that also failed to show the significant contribution of RV in acute respiratory infections in children. 9 11 38 While RV, particularly RV-C, has been associated with childhood wheezing and asthma, 39 its role in childhood pneumonia is not established. We had insufficient numbers to determine any specific RV types to be more prevalent among cases than controls; a study among Burundian children with lower respiratory tract symptoms associated RV-A with pneumonia and RV-C with wheezing. 40 However, recently, using advanced molecular techniques such as transcriptomic analysis, a robust immune response had been measured in symptomatic children with detectable RV, substantially higher than in asymptomatic RV-positive children, 41 suggesting the role of RV in acute respiratory infection needs more exploration.",

            "text": "M. pneumoniae was detected with similar frequency among cases to that reported in previous pneumonia studies and particularly prevalent among school-aged children and adolescents. 8 10 11 Unlike other studies, 42 M. pneumoniae was identified infrequently in the nasopharynx of our control subjects. 11 M. pneumoniae most frequently causes non-severe atypical pneumonia. Detection of M. pneumoniae in the nasopharynx is reported in asymptomatic children, making it further difficult to interpret their clinical role in pneumonia. Moreover, there are conflicting and inconclusive reports on appropriate treatment for M. pneumoniae. Recent reviews and meta-analysis concluded that there is insufficient evidence on the efficacy of single or combination of multiple antibiotic for lower respiratory tract infections in children associated with M. pneumoniae. [43] [44] [45] S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis were detected with similar frequency in children with and without pneumonia. However, high vaccine coverage has almost eliminated pathogenic vaccine-type strains of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae in this population. 6 23 While there were no differences overall, S. pneumoniae was detected more frequently among infants with pneumonia than in control infants, suggesting S. pneumoniae may remain as an important cause of pneumonia in early life. While our results suggest a lesser contribution of bacteria to childhood pneumonia than viruses, we caution that we have not disproved an important role for bacteria. It is plausible, for example, that secondary bacterial infection plays an important role in many cases of viral pneumonia. 34 A major strength of our study was the contemporaneous enrolment of children without pneumonia who were frequency-matched by age to pneumonia cases throughout the study period, which addressed methodological limitations in previous case-control studies in developed settings during post pneumococcal vaccination era. 9 11 However, our study has some limitations. To detect respiratory viruses and bacteria, we collected biological specimens from the upper respiratory tract (nasopharynx). The diagnosis of probable infectious agents associated with the lower respiratory tract illness such as pneumonia in children is often based on minimally invasive nasopharyngeal aspirates or nose/throat swabs. 9 46 Testing of specimens from usually sterile sites (including blood and pleural fluid for culture or PCR) is available in our setting but was not mandated by our protocol. It is to be noted that while detecting a pathogen in the upper respiratory tract is not conclusive of its causal association with disease; however, testing control children without pneumonia enabled us to have a better estimation on contribution to pneumonia at the population level. Our ability to identify respiratory pathogens associated with pneumonia was limited by the sensitivity of testing the specimens from nasopharynx for infection in the lower airways. Differences between pathogen detection in the upper and lower tract have been shown previously 47 ; it is plausible that in some cases with detectable virus, shedding of virus from the nasopharynx might be insignificant, or that shedding might be waning by the time children are hospitalised with pneumonia. Because of the sensitivity of our testing methods is likely incomplete, we expect that these estimates of the contribution of viruses to pneumonia represent minimum estimates. We used qualitative PCR assays in this study; determination of pathogen density through quantitative assays may permit distinction of causative from coincidental infection in particular cases of pneumonia. 48 We did not collect but data on radiographic details, for example, lobar consolidation or intestinal infiltrate, of enrolled cases would be useful to assess if radiographic pattern is associated with pathogen (bacterial or viral or both) detected in nasopharynx.",

Australia has well-established health infrastructure with high rates of vaccine coverage. The findings of our study are expected to be generalisable to similar developed settings but not necessarily to resource-poor settings countries with high crowding, different social mixing patterns and low vaccine coverage. Nonetheless, we note that our data are comparable to data from case-control studies from both high-income and middle-and low-income countries. 15 20 30 This is the most comprehensive study that described contribution of respiratory pathogens to childhood pneumonia in Australia to date and one of few case-control studies on childhood pneumonia from high-income settings in the PCV era. We found that respiratory viruses are a major contributor to childhood pneumonia. RSV appeared to account for a substantial proportion of viral pneumonia and should continue to be a focus for the development of preventative and treatment strategies. The burden of HMPV pneumonia may have been underappreciated before now. Data from this study could serve as baseline characteristics to assess the effectiveness of viral vaccines after their availability. Future studies should aim to develop a precise diagnostic tool that reliably distinguish viral from bacterial pneumonia to allow for targeted antiviral therapies and the more judicious use of antibiotics in treating childhood pneumonia.",
