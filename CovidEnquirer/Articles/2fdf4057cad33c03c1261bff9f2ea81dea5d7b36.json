The possibility of dual infection is unlikely as individual piglets were maintained in isolation and as neither control nor pcvinoculated piglets had clinical signs or intestinal lesions of transmissible gastroenteritis. The close similarity between pneumonia caused by each corona- virus is not surprising given the similarity of pcv to TGEV and suggests pneumonia in each group had a similar pathogenesis. In the lung, replication of rev and TGEV in non-ciliated cuboidal bronchiolar cells which are most numerous in terminal airways (Baskerville 1970 ) accounts for pneumonia involving small calibre bronchioles and adjacent parenchyma. Previous studies of the lungs of TGEV-infected piglets found virus in bronchial and bronchiolar cells (Underdahl et al 1974) and in pneumocytes (Underdahl et a11974, Mocsari and Horvath 1980) . Alveolar macrophages were proposed as a target cell population following infection in vitro by cell adapted but not wild-type TGEV strains (Laude et al 1984) . In the present study no virus was detected in alveolar epithelium. Degeneration of these cells was either the result of a low concentration of virus in affected cells, unproductive infection or inadvertent destruction by the acute inflammatory process in terminal airways.",

Unlike that study, however, in this study r-ev was isolated from small intestine suggesting a limited capacity by this isolate to replicate in enterocytes. Immunocytochemistry confirmed the presence of antigen-positive enterocytes. The paucity of these cells explains the absence of villous atrophy and the low titre of virus in gut compared with TGEV. In many respects PCV behaved like a stable, low pathogenicity strain of TGEV. Non-enteropathogenic TGEV strains retaining their capacity to infect respiratory tract tissues were produced in attempts to find a safe, effective vaccine to transmissible gastroenteritis (Furuuchi et al 1979) . Belgian isolates of r-ev do not, however, possess the characteristics of vaccinal strains of TGEV (Jestin et al 1987) .",

Fixation time in formalin was not critical for our PAP method and we have successfully stained TGEV-infected porcine gut fixed in a variety of solutions (periodate-lysineparaformaldehyde-dichromate, formal sublimate, acetone and Carnoy's), Given that the pneumonia caused by pcv is nondescript with no morphological hallmarks other than the occasional syncytial bronchiolar cell to facilitate aetiological diagnosis, the PAP method may have an application when rev is suspected of playing a role in field investigations of porcine pneumonia.
