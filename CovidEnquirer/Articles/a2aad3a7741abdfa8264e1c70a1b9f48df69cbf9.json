The isolation procedure entailed anion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, affinity chromatography an Affi-gel blue gel, cation exchange chromatography on SP-Sepharose, and gel filtration by fast protein liquid chromatography on Superdex 75. Although the antifungal peptide was unadsorbed on DEAE-cellulose, it was adsorbed on both Affi-gel blue gel and SP-Sepharose. The antifungal peptide exerted antifungal activity against Mycosphaerella arachidicola with an IC 50 value of 1.8 M. It was also active against Fusarium oxysporum with an IC 50 value of 2.2 M. It had no inhibitory effect on HIV-1 reverse transcriptase when tested up to 100 M. Proliferation of L1210 mouse leukemia cells and MBL2 lymphoma cells was inhibited by the antifungal peptide with an IC 50 of 10 M and 40 M, respectively.",

The assay makes use of the ability of reverse transcriptase to synthesize DNA, starting from the template/primer hybrid poly (A) oligo (dT) 15. The digoxigenin-and biotin-labeled nucleotides in an optimized ratio are incorporated into one of the same DNA molecule, which is freshly synthesized by the reverse transcriptase (RT). The detection and quantification of synthesized DNA as a parameter for RT activity follows a sandwich ELISA protocol. Biotin-labeled DNA binds to the surface of microtiter plate modules that have been precoated with streptavidin. Next, an antibody to digoxigenin conjugated to peroxidase binds to the digoxigenin-labeled DNA. Finally, the peroxidase substrate is added. The peroxidase enzyme catalyzes cleavage of the substrate, producing a colored reaction product. The absorbance of the samples at 405 nm, which is directly correlated to the level of RT activity, can be measured with a microtiter plate (ELISA) reader. A fixed amount (4-6 ng) of recombinant HIV-1 reverse transcriptase was used. The inhibitory activity of the isolated peptide was calculated as percent inhibition as compared to a control without the peptide Ng and Wang 2001) .
