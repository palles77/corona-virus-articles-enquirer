In our previous study, immunization of mice with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) spike (S) DNA vaccine could induce both humoral and cellular immunity in response to a pool of entire overlapping S peptides. Identification of functional dominant epitopes in SARS CoV S protein for T cells is crucial for further understanding of cellular immune responses elicited by SARS CoV S DNA vaccine. In present study, mice were immunized with SARS CoV S DNA vaccine. Subsequently, a pool of 17-19 mers overlapped SARS CoV S peptides, which served as immunogens, were scanned to identify the specific epitopes for T cells. Two H-2 d restricted CD4 + T epitopes, N60 (S435-444) and P152 (S1111-1127), and two H-2 d restricted CD8 + T cell epitopes, N50 (S365-374) and P141 (S1031-1047) were identified by three different methods, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), enzyme linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT) and fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS). The dominant CD4 + T cell epitope (N60) and CD8 + T cell epitope (N50) located in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS CoV S protein, which mediated virus combining and fusing to susceptible cells. Importantly, our novel finding is that mice primed with SARS S DNA vaccine and boosted with T cell epitopes (N50 and N60) could promote antigen specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cell immune responses. Our study provides valuable information for the design of vaccine for SARS study.",

SARS CoV consists of four major structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and nucleacapsid (N). S protein is a large type I transmembrane glycoprotein responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion [4, 5] . The angiotension converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) on the susceptible cell surface is served as a receptor for SARS CoV. And a small 193 amino acid fragment on SARS CoV residue (S318-510) was characterized as a minimal functional receptor-binding domain (RBD) [6, 7] . Moreover, CD209L (L-SIGN) is another receptor for SARS CoV [8] .",

Whole SARS CoV particles inactivated by formaldehyde, UV light or \u2424-propiolactone could induce neutralizing antibodies in animals, and these vaccines were being tested in clinic trials in China [16] . Yang et al. reported that a candidate DNA vaccine encoding the full-length S protein induced neutralizing antibodies, which could protect mice from SARS CoV challenge [17] . After immunization with SARS CoV DNA vaccine, cellular immunity was induced by the evidence of high frequencies of IFN-\u2425 producing effector/memory CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in mice [18] . Additionally, adenovirus, attenuated para-influenza virus and modified attenuated modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vaccines encoding SARS CoV S protein were used to immunize animals. Results indicated that these vaccines could elicit high titers of neutralizing antibodies [19] [20] [21] .",

Injection of animals with epitope vaccines could effectively elicit humoral and cellular immunity with less side effects [32] . It has been reported that vaccination with cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitope could protect against human metapneumovirus infection in mouse study [33] . At present, prime-boost strategy has been shown to generate high levels of memory T cells in animal models. Several reports have highlighted the power of prime-boost strategies in eliciting protective cellular immunity against a variety of pathogens [34] . In SARS vaccine studies, different prime-boost immune strategies have been compared by use of several different SARS vaccine candidates, such as DNA vaccine, adenovirus vaccine, inactive virus vaccine and recombined S proteins [35, 36] . Generally, DNA vaccine appears to be more effective at priming than boosting immune responses. It is well known that SARS is a kind of pulmonary infection and lung is the portal of entry for SARS CoV infections. In the case of pulmonary infections, there is evidence that vaccines need to elicit mucosal immunity or effector memory T cell pools in the lung [37] . After priming with DNA vaccine, BALB/c mice were boosted with N50 and N60 plus CPG ODN, which dramatically increased the frequencies of antigen specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, especially in the lung. Therefore, DNA prime-peptide boost regimen could be an effective strategy in eliciting SARS specific immunity. Recently, it has been reported that injection of SARS CoV S protein into mice would result in an acute lung failure in vivo through the pathway of ACE-2 to which RBD served as the receptor [38] . These two dominant epitopes (N50 and N60) were just located in the region of RBD. Thus, inoculation of animals with these two epitopes based vaccine seemed to be more effective than SARS CoV S protein or RBD based vaccines.",
