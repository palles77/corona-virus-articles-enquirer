In order to determine whether T lineage lymphocytes are required for infection, young adult athymic nude (nulnu) mice and euthymic littermates were infected with MTLV and tested for virus shedding. Although euthymic littermates regularly shed virus, in the nude mice only about 20% of isolation attempts up to 100 days postinfection were positive. Blind passage yielded an additional three isolations out of 14 samples (21%). In addition, unlike many other herpesviruses, the virus did not replicate in a number of epithelial and fibroblastic cell lines that were tested. These data confirm that the virus is preferentially T lymphotropic and suggest that infection may require T lineage lymphocytes.",

All nude mice and littermate controls were negative for MTLV by virus isolation at the outset of the experiment (before inoculation). After inoculation, all the inoculated mice became infected with the virus. Ability to recover virus was not correlated with input virus dose. Virus could as readily be recovered from mice that had received 40 IDS0 as from those that had received 200 IDso. The infected mice remained healthy throughout the observation period (over 100 days), and no overt disease was attributable to MTLV infection in the nude mice. In the euthymic controls, all virus isolation attempts were positive through 100 days postinfection, with most of the inoculated pups developing macroscopic thymic necrosis (mean, 92%). In the athymic nude mice, by contrast, although virus was recovered at least once from each nude mouse (Table l) , only 5 of 27 primary isolation attempts from Day 6 through Day 98 were positive, giving an isolation rate of 18.5%. In positive isolations, fewer inoculated pups showed thymic necrosis (mean, 14.2%) than pups that received swab fluids from controls (Table 1) .",

Although nude mice lack mature functional T lymphocytes, early T lineage precursors are present in the nude mouse (6, 8, 10); under certain conditions, these cells in the nude mouse can also differentiate extrathymically into mature T lymphocytes (7 1). In addition, several reports indicate that a small number of apparently matu\"e (bearing the T lymphocyte marker Thy 1) T lineage lymphocytes are present in nude mice throughout their lives (6, 10). A small population of this type could be persistently infected and responsible for the low level of virus shedding observed. This population reportedly increases with age or intercurrent infection (111. Infection with the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a common murine pathogen endemic in many nude mouse colonies, has also been reported to induce extrathymic T cell differentiation in nude mice (11) . Some of our preliminary results (data not shown) suggest that nude mice older at primary infection, or nude mice that have been infected with MHV, appear more likely to shed MTLV. Alternatively, there could be a secondary cell type (such as the macrophage) in which virus can persist at low levels even in the absence of T lymphocytes. Macrophage infection by another T lymphocytolytic virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-l), has been documented (13). Our preliminary attempts to isolate MTLV from adherent peritoneal macrophages of persistently infected euthymic mice have been negative so far. However, low levels of infected cells might not be detected. Specific molecular probes, such as genomic DNA probes or monoclonal antibodies, are not presently available for this virus. We are in the process of producing specific high-titer antisera and other probes in order to test the presence of MTLV in various lymphoid and hematopoietic tissues and in nerve cells.",

Our attempts to infect a variety of epithelial and fibroblastic cell cultures that support the replication of many other viruses have been uniformly negative. For infection, subconfluent monolayers of cells were incubated for 90 min with DME-10 containing 500-2000 IDS0 MTLV and polybrene (30 pg/ml), then fed (DME supplemented with 5010 fetal bovine serum), incubated, and tested for MTLV by infectivity assay at 5-7 days and at 2 weeks. Cells tested included AR42J rat glandular epithelium, BALB CL.7 mouse fibroblast, BALB 3T3 fibroblast, Cl271 mouse mammary tumor, J774A.l mouse macrophage, NCTC 1469 mouse liver, SC-l feral mouse embryo, TCMK-1 mouse kidney, 32 Ill A rat hepatoma, A549 human lung carcinoma, HEp-2 human epidermoid carcinoma, MDCK canine kidney epithelium, Vero African green monkey kidney, WISH diploid human amniotic epithelium, 324K human kidney, and primary cultures of African green monkey kidney, cynomolgous monkey kidney, rabbit kidney, and rhesus monkey kidney. Replicate cultures, observed up to a month for cytolysis or focus formation, remained negative throughout. Additional cultures cocultivated with primary MTLV-infected thymocytes (5 X 105/ml, harvested Day 5 postinfection) also remained uninfected. These results suggest that MTLV is unable to productively infect many cell lines that support the cytolytic replication of many viruses including other lymphotropic herpesviruses. Taken together, these lines of evidence appear to implicate the T lineage lymphocyte as the primary target of both acute and persistent MTLV infection. ",
