In an effort to expand the number of possible ways to uniquely and ef\u00aeciently encode unnatural amino acids, we have devised a general strategy to select tRNAs with the ability to suppress four-base codons from a library of tRNAs with randomized 8 or 9 nt anticodon loops. Our selectants included both known and novel suppressible four-base codons and resulted in a set of very ef\u00aecient, noncross-reactive tRNA/four-base codon pairs for AGGA, UAGA, CCCU and CUAG. The most ef\u00aecient four-base codon suppressors had Watson-Crick complementary anticodons, and the sequences of the anticodon loops outside of the anticodons varied with the anticodon. Additionally, four-base codon reporter libraries were used to identify``shifty'' sites at which 1 frameshifting is most favorable in the absence of suppressor tRNAs in Escherichia coli. We intend to use these tRNAs to explore the limits of unnatural polypeptide biosynthesis, both in vitro and eventually in vivo. In addition, this selection strategy is being extended to identify novel \u00aeve-and six-base codon suppressors.",

However, it has also become clear that frame maintenance during translation is not absolute (Atkins et al., 1991; Kurland, 1992; Parker, 1989) . In addition to the inherent accuracy limits of the ribosome in maintaining frame, shifts can be promoted by mutant tRNAs and can occur with high frequency at``programmed'' sites in mRNA. Frameshifts can be stimulated by such elements as upstream rRNAbinding motifs, stem-loop structures and underused codons. Indeed, these programmed shifts can be critical to protein production, e.g. the gag-pol polyprotein of Rous Sarcoma virus, the Ty1 and Ty3 elements of yeast, the dnaX gene of DNA Pol III tau and gamma units, and the self-regulating RF2 protein in Escherichia coli .",

Shortly thereafter, Yourno & Tanemura (1970) showed that protein from a suppressed frameshift was of wild-type sequence, and Riddle & Carbon (1973) showed that the external frameshift suppressor sufD in Salmonella is tRNA Gly with a four-base anticodon CCCC instead of the wild-type CCC. (Note that we adopt the convention herein of writing both codon and anticodon sequences in the 5 H to 3 H direction.) These experiments conclusively demonstrated that certain tRNAs with extended anticodons can read non-triplet codons. Most of the known four-base codon suppressors have subsequently been isolated from Salmonella or yeast and are largely single-base insertion mutants of tRNA Pro , tRNA Gly or tRNA Lys reading CCCX, GGGX or AAAX, where it is not always known which X can be read. The known four-base codon suppressors tend to act with ef\u00aeciencies from very poor to approaching 20 % (Atkins et al., 1991) .",

This result indicates that Watson-Crick pairing at the fourth codon nucleotide is even less strictly enforced than at the third`w obble'' position for normal codons. However, the identity of the N:N pair does affect suppression ef\u00aeciency, and canonical pairings in the fourth position gave the strongest suppression (Gaber & Culbertson, 1984) .

While the canonical pairs tended to suppress well, some non-canonical pairs were also ef\u00aecient. For example, the best pair arose from a CCUA anticodon and a UAGA codon; also, the GCUA tRNA preferred UAGA and UAGG to its canonical UAGC. The ability to read a four-base codon versus a three-base codon for these extended-anticodon tRNAs was also assessed, by using tRNAs that decode four-base codons whose \u00aerst three bases encode a stop codon. In this case there is no competitive translation with a canonical tRNA. In general, four-base decoding predominated when a fourth Watson-Crick pair was possible and was less likely to predominate otherwise. The authors proposed that this is a consequence of mRNAinduced stabilization of a tRNA conformation that favors four-base decoding, possible only when a fourth canonical base-pair is present (Curran & Yarus, 1987) .",

For example in Salmonella, mutant tRNA Pro with a GGGG anticodon is methylated in such a way (underlined G37) that pairing with the mRNA cytosine is obstructed. Apparently, the tRNA Pro with cmo 5 UGG anticodon, which typically reads CCA, CCG and CCU, can read CCC in the absence of its normal cognate tRNA GGG , but favors slippage since there are only two canonical base-pairs.",

In an RF1-de\u00aecient E. coli strain, UCUA suppressed the UAGA codon with up to 26 % ef\u00aeciency with little decoding in the 0 or \u00c01 frames (Moore et al., 2000) . This pair was also fairly ef\u00aecient in the Curran & Yarus study, and differences between the results of independent experiments are likely due, in part, to the extent of aminoacylation and maturation with different tRNA scaffolds. It is clear that decoding four-base codons with complementary anticodons is generally favorable, but the rules that govern the comparative suppression ef\u00aeciencies for different four-base codons remain unclear.",

Atkins and co-workers established the generality of``leakiness'' in frame maintenance by measuring the weak activity from insertion and deletion mutants of the gene for b-galactosidase induced by the acridine derivative ICR-191D. Sixteen mutants varied in activity by 100-fold, with the strongest 0.06 % of wild-type (Atkins et al., 1972) . This, and studies of immunoprecipitated truncation products of b-galactosidase (Manley, 1978) place the average frequency of frameshift in the range of 5 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 per translocation event. However, factors such as ribosomal mutation (rpsL and ram), streptomycin treatment, amino acid starvation and``hungry'' codons greatly increase the frequency of frame errors (Atkins et al., 1972; Weiss & Gallant, 1983; Weiss et al., 1988a) . For example, in E. coli, tandem repeat of AGG, a rare arginine codon read by a minor tRNA, results in 1 frameshift up to 50 % of the time (Spanjaard & van Duin, 1988) .",

Two types of libraries were generated: four-base codon reporters and tRNA suppressors (Figure 1 ). The reporter system involved replacement of a conserved (S70) or permissive (S124) codon in the gene for b-lactamase with four random nucleotides. These libraries, which each contain 4 4 256 unique members, bear an insertion mutation at the site of interest, producing an inactive enzyme as a result of the frame alteration that renders transformed bacteria incapable of survival on ampicillin. To our surprise, however, approximately 0.5 % of the members of these reporter libraries survived on moderate to high concentrations of ampicillin (100-2000 mg ml \u00c01 ). Invariably, sequencing of these clones showed that the b-lactamase genes contained only three nucleotides at the sites of interest, corresponding to Ser and Cys at the conserved S70 site and corresponding to all amino acids except Cys, Met, Pro, Trp and Tyr at the permissive S124 site (although this is probably largely due to undersampling of three-base sequence space, since the amount of contamination was small). Presumably, these``deletion'' mutants, which occur at rates much higher than the 10 \u00c06 upper-limit estimated for deletion in vivo (Cupples et al., 1990) , are the result of inef\u00aeciency in the coupling and capping reactions employed during synthesis of the oligonucleotides used to generate the libraries.",

Analogously, to examine how ef\u00aeciently AGGA could be suppressed by 9-nt anticodon loop tRNAs, the AGGA reporter at S124 was crossed against tRNA Ser (N9) and selected at 20 and 300 mg ml \u00c01 ampicillin. At 300 mg ml \u00c01 ampicillin, the consensus sequence was BNKUCCUAH, where K G or U and H A or C or U (Table 6) . However, at 20 mg ml \u00c01 , the consensus sequence degenerated to NNNUCCUAN. In a single case out of 38 clones, CUUCCUAUU, the extra nucleotide in the loop was on the 3 H side of the anticodon (UCCU). At both levels of ampicillin selection, tRNAs with 8 nt anticodon loops were among the selectants, presumably as a result of``deletion'' from inef\u00aecient capping during oligonucleotide synthesis seen in the reporter libraries. These deletions dominate the selection at higher ampicillin levels, indicating that suppression of four-base codons (or at least AGGA) is more robust with tRNAs bearing 8 nt anticodon loops rather than 9-nt loops, overall.",

Convenient arbitrary units were de\u00aened to normalize the activity for the number of cells assayed and to subtract out the effects of the slow background hydrolysis of nitroce\u00aen (see Materials and Methods). Spontaneous frameshift-ing at of the four-base codons at S124 was no more than twice the background hydrolysis by TOP10 E. coli (0.8-1.7 units versus 0.9 unit), which was comparable to readthrough of the amber stop codon (1.2 units, Figure 2 ). Suppression of the four-base codons was in the range of 17 to 240 units, or 2.5-35 % of wild-type (AGT or b-lactamase on pBR322). However, in this assay, the very-ef\u00aecient supD suppressor of the amber stop codon exhibited virtually the same b-lactamase activity as observed in cells with AGT (Ser) at the S124 site. This may indicate that it is possible to saturate the amount of b-lactamase that is exported to the periplasm in this system.

Among those ef\u00aecient suppressors identi\u00aeed in this study, it is clear that there is no sequence pattern that generally underlies ef\u00aecient four-base suppression. For example, CUAG is completely non-repetitive, and GGGG, AAAA and UUUU are not among the best suppressors. However, the most ef\u00aeciently suppressed four-base codons correspond to three-base codons (plus one 3 H nucleotide) with low usage and low tRNA abundance in E. coli (Table 9 ). For example, AGG is the least used codon in the E. coli genome (Inokuchi & Yamao, 1995) . Nevertheless, the best suppressors do not simply correspond to the least represented tRNAs or codons, since we found no robust suppressors of highly underrepresented codons AGAN, AUAN or CGAN. Also, among randomly selected codons that vary in usage from overrepresented (AAUG and UUCU) to moderate representation (ACGC) to underrepresented (GGAU and CGGA), and that lack any evident sequence pattern, weak to moderate suppressors could be found (Table 9 ). Of course, the procedure employed here selects for growth on ampicillin and therefore requires both an ef\u00aecient four-base codon/tRNA interaction and a lack of toxicity to the cell. We cannot rule out the possibility of ef\u00aecient but toxic suppressors of highly represented four-base codons.",

However, CUAG is apparently a completely novel ef\u00aeciently suppressed four-base codon, consistent with the fact that CTAG is underrepresented in the bacterial genome (Burge et al., 1992) . These suppressors acted with ef\u00aeciencies of 2.5-35 % of the maximum activity detectable with a nitroce\u00aen-based assay (AGU or supD/UAG), which is consistent with activities from the most ef\u00aecient natural and engineered suppressors known. Also, fairly ef\u00aecient suppressors for the four-base codons CUAC, CCAU, UCAA, CCUU and CUCU were found (Tables 1 and 4 ). Examination of the anticodon loop sequences shows that the best tRNAs for each codon have a canonical anticodon, but the rest of the loop does not necessarily converge on the sequence consensus observed in E. coli tRNAs. For example, the tRNA that suppresses CUAG has G33 and G37 instead of U33 and A37, and the tRNA that suppresses CCCU has a U37. (See Figure 1 for numbering of nucleotides in the 8 nt and 9 nt anticodon loops.) Presumably, these mutations adjust the loop conformation to allow maximally favorable interaction between the codon and anticodon, which is quite possibly different from the most favorable conformation for a three-base anticodon. These data support a model in which the extended-codon tRNA directly reads all four bases of the codon (as opposed to a slippage model), since (1) the most ef\u00aecient suppressors invariably had Watson-Crick complementarity at all four bases of the codon, (2) the suppression at S70 required insertion of a serine or cysteine residue, demonstrating that the modi\u00aeed tRNA Ser was delivering the amino acid, and (3) there is no special pattern underlying the suppressed codons, as might be expected if slippage were occurring.",

This approach gives us some idea about the tolerance of the E. coli translational apparatus to variation in the tRNAs for suppression of fourbase codons (presumably combined with tRNA maturation and aminoacylation differences, which are probably minimal here). Figure 3 shows the consensus sequences for tRNAs able to suppress AGGA at various levels of ampicillin compared with the known E. coli tRNAs. The best suppressors of this codon maintain the universal U33 and highly favored A37 seen in E. coli tRNAs. At the 300 mg ml \u00c01 ampicillin level, U33 or C33 and A37 are favored, but G is present in some clones at both sites. When much weaker suppressors were selected (20 mg ml \u00c01 ampicillin), no base is conserved at position 33 and, though A37 is favored, G37 and U37 are seen. This calls into question the necessity of the U33 to make the sharp turn seen in the X-ray crystal structure of tRNA Phe (Holbrook et al., 1978; Sussman & Kim, 1976) . Even the 33.5 position corresponding to AGGA is not entirely conserved in these weak suppressors, though U33.5 is still strongly favored. Some 5 % of the clones selected at 300 mg ml \u00c01 and 19 % at 20 mg ml \u00c01 have the possibility of an A:U or U:A pair at the 32:38 site, which would formally extend the anticodon stem by one pair and leave a 6 nt loop.

At 300 mg ml \u00c01 ampicillin, U38 is favored, while either pyrimidine is favored at 20 mg ml \u00c01 . This differs both from the E. coli preference for A38 and lack of preference in 8 nt tRNAs. U33 is strongly preferred at both ampicillin concentrations, much more so than in the 8 nt anticodon loops. Also, while there is degeneracy at the 32 position, the stronger suppressors do not have A32, possibly to avoid 32:38 pairing with the favored U38. At 300 mg ml \u00c01 ampicillin, three of the nine clones have the possibility of a weak G32:U38 wobble pair (resulting in a 7 nt anticodon loop and extended anticodon stem), but none can canonically pair. However, among the weaker suppressors, two of 37 clones can have a U:A or A:U pair and \u00aeve can have a G:C pair. Particularly in the latter case, it is possible that the 7 nt anticodon loop with an extended anticodon stem is the active conformation suppressing the four-base codon. Indeed, recent work by Auf\u00aenger & Westhof (1999) suggests structural conservation at the 32:38 position in all tRNAs and excludes G:C pairs, perhaps lending credence to the view that this pair is part of the stem, not the loop, in these cases.",

Suppression is at S124 and listed in ampicillin concentration of mg ml \u00c01 . or four-base) to ensure protein sequence integrity. It is helpful in this regard that all of the useful four-base codons are based on rare natural codons. This greatly reduces the potential need to silently mutate related codons in the gene of interest (i.e. if one employed AGGA suppression in a gene containing AGG codons) to avoid missense or frameshift suppression at other sites. Moreover, that these codons are extremely rare and that the suppressors are not toxic to E. coli suggests that there is not a notable problem with suppression of three or four-base codons by these tRNAs genome-wide. Equally important is the fact that the suppressor tRNAs do not interact with other codons. Selection with the best suppressor tRNAs from the library of all four-base codons resulted in, at worst, limited sets of highly related codons. For example, no other codon was selected even at very low ampicillin concentration with the tRNA that suppressed CUAG (Table 7 ). In the cases of UAGA and AGGA, suppression of other UAGN or AGGN codons at more moderate levels of ampicillin (though still at least \u00aevefold lower than in the canonical case) probably places a practical limit on the use of similar four-base codons in a single transcript. For example, AGGA and AGGU are probably suf\u00aeciently cross-reactive that they should be avoided in a single transcript, whereas AGGA, CUAG and UAGA and CCCU are likely to be simultaneously useful.",

These codons were selected at the 200 or 300 mg ml \u00c01 level at S124, but not 1000 mg ml \u00c01 . Since all of the codons selected at the 300 mg ml \u00c01 level at S124 are present at that level or above at S70, it is likely that these codons can generally be suppressed at any site. The local context of the codon probably affects overall suppression ef\u00aeciency, a concept that has been demonstrated many times for frameshift and stop-codon suppression (Ayer & Yarus, 1986; Belcourt & Farabaugh, 1990; Bossi & Ruth, 1980; Tate et al., 1996) . However, there are no conspicuous sequences\u00afanking the S70 site, such as repeated rare codons, upstream Shine-Delgarno sequence or stable downstream mRNA structure. Interestingly, amber stop codons (UAG) are often suppressed most ef\u00aeciently when followed by an A, as the S70 site is here, though the reason for this is not clear (Ayer & Yarus, 1986; Bossi & Ruth, 1980) .",

However, the actual amount of tolerance for errors is dif\u00aecult to appreciate. It is estimated that DNA replication \u00aedelity is between 10 \u00c08 and 10 \u00c011 per base in vivo, but transcriptional and translational \u00aedelity is closer to 10 \u00c04 per codon (Parker, 1989) . Manley (1978) demonstrated that a measured 5 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 frameshift error rate corresponds to approximately 30 % of incipient translations of a given protein resulting in some sort of abortive synthesis, due in large part to the relative prevalence of stop codons in the non-coding frames. Especially for genes that are transcribed at very low levels, this appears to be a signi\u00aecant energetic waste that is tolerated by the cell, and one must wonder if it is not being exploited as a subtle, stochastic mechanism of regulation or is an evolutionary artifact.",

For example, we found ef\u00aecient missense suppressors of a variety of codons corresponding to a wide variety of amino acids. While it is true that these tended to correspond to underrepresented codons (Table 9) , even the least used codon must appear in the largely transcribed E. coli genome hundreds to thousands of times. Hong et al. (1998) found that a glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase mutant that inserted glutamic acid for glutamine less than 5 % of the time resulted in a 40 % increase in doubling time of the bacteria. However, none of the missense suppressors found here had demonstrably toxic effects, and were selected at levels comparable to about 15 % suppression ef\u00aeciency as measured with the nitroce\u00aen assay for our four-base suppressors. Moreover, at many of these same rare codons, very ef\u00aecient suppressors of four-base codons could be maintained without deleterious effects on cell growth, and in at least one case (UUCU) a moderately ef\u00aecient suppressor was found for an overrepresented codon.

Some of these correspond to codons used widely throughout the genome (AAA accounts for 3.84 % of codons in E. coli). A number of these sequences have been exploited by nature at programmed frameshift sites. For example, E. coli RF2 is produced when a UGA stop codon is averted by slippage on a CUUU site, which was seen here. In the yeast Ty1 element, slippage occurs on CUUA to generate the TYB protein, a pol analog (Farabaugh, 1996) . In the case of the RF2 site, engineered alteration of the CUU to UUA, CUA, GUA, GUG or AUA caused drastic decreases in shifting, but alteration to GUU, UUU, CCC or CCU retained higher levels. While only UUUU was found in our selection, the other sites except for CCUU clearly retain the internal tandem-repeat motif (Curran, 1993; Weiss et al., 1987) .",

The selected codons differ from this list in three ways: (i) the identities of N are anomalous; (ii) AAGN, CCCN and CCUN were not found; and (iii) CGGN and CGAU were found. The potential advantage of additionally repairing the third base would explain AAAA, UUUU and CUUU but not AGGC, GGGA, UUUC or the other CUUN, which largely do not even follow wobble rules. It is unlikely that AAGN, CCUN and CCCN were simply not in the library, since the sequence space is small (256) and more than 70 clones were sequenced including duplicates of most sequences. Probably, CCUN and CCCN did not appear due to lack of tolerance for Pro at S124, as CCN codes for Pro, and perhaps the central wobble re-pair in AAGN is especially unfavorable. Shiftiness at CGGN and CGAU is not explained by this hypothesis, especially since no re-pairing is possible with CGAU, but it is of note that both of these codons are highly underrepresented in E. coli. It seems likely that the full explanation of inherent shiftiness at a given codon is a combination of the ability of the tRNA to re-pair in the new frame, the abundance of the tRNA and the context of the codon generally.",

Cells bearing the speci\u00aec members of the S124(N4) library and controls, speci\u00aecally, S124 mutants UAG, AGGA, CCCU, CUAG, UAGA and wild-type pBR322, were assayed for b-lactamase activity in the presence and absence of the corresponding tRNAs. Cells were grown in 2YT to A 600 between 0.5 and 1.5 (mid to late-log phase), washed with 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7) containing 10 % (w/v) DMSO, and assayed with 1 mM nitroce\u00aen (Oxoid). To measure the low read-through activities of the TAG and four-base codons alone, 5 ml of cells from culture was concentrated into 1 ml assays and observed at 486 nm at 20, 30 and 40 minutes. For higher activities from suppression with tRNAs, 50-250 ml of culture was added directly to the assays and the A 486 nm was observed every 30 seconds to one minute for 15 to 30 minutes. Since the concentration of nitroce\u00aen is far above the K M of 110 mM (Sigal et al., 1984) and far less than 10 % of the substrate was consumed, the rate of substrate turnover is proportional to the concentration of b-lactamase contributed by the cells, and therefore the amount of enzyme from coding, readthrough or suppression.
