The interactions that occur when the respiratory epithelium encounters these viral and bacterial pathogens are poorly understood. We used Agilent bovine gene microarray chips containing 44,000 transcripts to elucidate bovine bronchial epithelial cell (BBEC) responses following in vitro exposure to BHV-1 alone, M. haemolytica alone, or both BHV-1 and M. haemolytica. Microarray analysis revealed differential regulation (>2-fold) of 978 transcripts by BHV-1 alone, 2040 transcripts by M. haemolytica alone, and 2189 genes by BHV-1 and M. haemolytica in combination. M. haemolytica treatment produced significantly greater inductions (>10-fold) of several inflammation associated genes, such as CXCL2, IL-6, IL-1\u2423, e-selectin, and IL-8, than to BHV-1 alone. Functional analysis of the microarray data revealed a significant upregulation of genes involved in important biological processes such as inflammation (TNF-\u2423, IL-8, Tlr-2, IL-1, CXCL2, CSF2), vascular functions (VEGF, EDN2) and leukocyte migration (ICAM1, IL-16) during a co-infection with BHV-1 and M. haemolytica compared to either pathogen alone. This study provides evidence to support that lung epithelial cells are a source of mediators that may promote inflammatory changes observed during bovine respiratory disease.",

The main bacterial pathogen of BRD is Mannheimia haemolytica, which produces a potent leukotoxin that is its principal virulence factor (Fedorova and Highlander, 1997; Highlander et al., 2000) . In its most severe manifestation, infection with M. haemolytica can cause fibrinous pleuropneumonia (Car et al., 1991; Hodgson et al., 2005; Loneragan et al., 2001; Ohmann and Babiuk, 1985; Yates, 1982) . It is clear that in cattle, as in humans and other mammalian species, active viral infection dramatically increases susceptibility to bacterial pneumonia. This has been demonstrated experimentally in cattle infected with any one of several bovine respiratory viruses such as bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1) and bovine respiratory syncitial virus (BRSV), which renders them highly susceptible to challenge with M. haemolytica Yates, 1982) . In marked contrast, far greater numbers of M. haemolytica cells are required to cause pneumonia in the absence of viral infection, even when the bacterial cells are inoculated into a bronchus (Ohmann and Babiuk, 1985; Yates, 1982) . These observations indicate that viral infection impairs host defense mechanisms against M. haemolytica, or amplifies undesirable aspects of the host response to this bacterial pathogen.",

However, it infects other cell types including bovine epithelial cells (Babiuk et al., 1996; Thaker et al., 1994) . Thus, one might infer that the effects of BHV-1 on resistance to bacterial pneumonia are indirect and may result in part from epithelial cells releasing chemical mediators during viral infection (Babiuk et al., 1996; Brown and Shin, 1990; Leite et al., 2004a,b; Raz et al., 1993) . These mediators in turn can alter the activity of bovine neutrophils and mononuclear phagocytes. For example, we demonstrated previously that exposure of leukocytes to BHV-1 virus -induced cytokines, alters leukocyte expression (or activation) of \u2424-integrins in ways that increase their susceptibility to M. haemolytica leukotoxin (LKT) and their adhesion to epithelial cells in vitro (Rivera et al., 2009; Leite et al., 2004a,b) .",

Less attention has been paid to the interplay among viral and bacterial pathogens and respiratory epithelial cells. Recent reports from our laboratory and others (Gershwin et al., 2005; Hodgson et al., 2005; Rivera et al., 2009; Leite et al., 2004a,b; Raz et al., 1993; Wilson et al., 2005) provide evidence for viral and bacterial pathogen interactions with bovine respiratory epithelial cells. These findings suggest that BHV-1 infection of respiratory epithelial cells results in the release of mediators that attract leukocytes, and with subsequent exposure to M. haemolytica LKT, intensify the inflammatory process that characterizes BRD.",

Such infections may be associated with gene expression profiles that promote pathogenesis of disease while the host counters by enhancing expression of genes that mediate protection mechanisms. The balance between these two responses governs the clinical outcome of the infection. Understanding the complex nature of factors contributing to tissue injury requires investigating multiple factors at a given point of time.

(A) Identification of differentially expressed features at each treatment by annotation screening (p < 0.05 and fold change \u2265 2.0). (B) There were 978, 2040, and 2189 differentially expressed transcripts identified for BHV-1, MH, and BHV-1 + MH, respectively. Three hundred and nineteen transcripts were differentially regulated by all treatments (p < 0.05, and fold change \u2265 2.0).",

(A) This heat map depicts a qualitative assessment of the similarities of the gene expression of the top 50 of the 319 differentially expressed genes in response to the 3 treatments. Red indicates up-regulation while green indicates down-regulation of selected genes. (B) Multivariate pairwise correlation analysis of the BBE cell gene expression patterns elicited by BHV-1, MH, and BHV-1 + MH.This analysis provides a more quantitative examination of similarities in expression patterns of the differentially expressed genes by determining the correlation between gene expression (as fold change) and significance (p < 0.05) profiles of the genes differentially regulated by all treatments. This analysis indicates that the responses elicited by MH are highly correlated with gene expression patterns for BHV-1 + MH.",
