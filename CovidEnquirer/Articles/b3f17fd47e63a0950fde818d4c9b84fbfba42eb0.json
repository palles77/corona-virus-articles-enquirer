The cat was pyrexic (39.6 C) with pale mucous membranes, a grade II/VI murmur over the left cardiac apex, moderate enlargement of both popliteal lymph nodes and mild enlargement of both mandibular lymph nodes. Marked pitting oedema was present in the left hind limb between the pes and stifle with a focal swelling around the fourth digit. Multiple raised, erythematous plaques (2e4 mm diameter) were present in the plantar interdigital skin surrounding the fourth digit, with a haemorrhagic discharge oozing from these lesions (Fig 1) .

Due to concerns that the limb lesion was a precipitating factor in the haemolytic anaemia and that haemorrhage from the lesion would exacerbate the anaemia, a decision was made to amputate the fourth digit to obtain a representative excisional biopsy. Abdominal ultrasonography prior to surgery was unremarkable. The fourth digit of the left pes was amputated; histopathology revealed multiple dilated lymphatics, many containing spindle-shaped cells that stained positively for factor VIII (Fig 3) . Plump aggregates of abnormal cells were present within the lymphatic channels extending to the surgical margins (Fig 4) . The histopathological diagnosis was lymphangiosarcoma. Review of the previously obtained skin biopsies confirmed the same lesions, hence the preliminary histopathological diagnosis of granulomatous lymphangitis was considered a mis-diagnosis. Ciprofloxacin Skin, dermis, case 1. Immunohistochemistry for factor VIII-related antigen (brown reaction product) confirms the endothelial origin of the cells lining the vessels and those forming the intraluminal projections. Haematoxylin and eosin, \u00c220 objective. and doxycycline treatment continued and prednisolone (10 mg q 12 h PO) was added to the therapy.

The cat was euthanased. Necropsy and histopathological examination confirmed the original diagnosis of lymphangiosarcoma and identified its spread to involve the soft tissues of the neck, thorax and parietal pleura. Thrombosis of the distal left jugular vein, extensive cutaneous and subcutaneous haemorrhage and oedema in the skin over the left thorax and ventral neck, and a bilateral serosanguineous chylous pleural effusion were all associated with the infiltration of the lymphangiosarcoma. Mild concentric left ventricular cardiac hypertrophy of unknown significance and aetiology was also identified at necropsy.",

In humans, chronic lymphoedema can cause lymphangiosarcoma. StewarteTreves syndrome, an aggressive form of lymphangiosarcoma, can develop in post-mastectomy patients (Chung et al 2000) and others with primary or secondary lymphoedema. In domestic species, this is extremely rare with only one report of primary lymphoedema in a dog leading to the induction of lymphangiosarcoma (Webb et al 2004) .",

Radiography initially showed diffuse thickening of the soft tissues of the distal limb due to lymphoedema. Subtle, circumferential, cortical lysis gave the periosteal surface a scalloped appearance; the lesion initially affected one metacarpal bone but progressed to involve three. Periosteal new bone reaction and medullary cavity lysis were not present, and the fourth metacarpal was apparently spared. Unfortunately, histopathology was not performed on the bone lesions. We speculate that the lysis was secondary to the effects of increased pressure on the periosteal surface of the bones from chronic lymphoedema, as chronic pressure is known to induce bone resorption and remodelling (Park et al 1996) .",

Serological tests for feline immunodeficiency virus, feline leukaemia virus and feline coronavirus were negative. Mycoplasma haemofelis was not detected on smears and although polymerase chain reaction testing was not performed, there was no response to symptomatic treatment. Non-infectious causes of haemolytic anaemia include primary immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia (IMHA), toxic causes, microangiopathy and congenital enzyme abnormalities, with primary IMHA being very rare in the cat (Cowell 1997) . Secondary IMHA can occur as a paraneoplastic condition and although the exact incidence is unknown, paraneoplastic IMHA is relatively common in humans and animals (Bergman 2001) . We speculate the IMHA in case 1 was most likely secondary to the underlying neoplastic condition. IMHA has not been previously reported in cats with lymphangiosarcoma.",

In case 1, the lesion was initially misdiagnosed as granulomatous lymphangitis; this may reflect the subtleties of the neoplastic characteristics in this tumour. Lymphangiosarcoma is characterised by poorly defined proliferation of spindle cells forming vascular clefts or cavernous spaces (Hinrichs et al 1999, Galeotti et al 2004) , features present in both cases. The identification of factor VIII-related antigen and vimentin with immunohistochemistry confirmed the cells were of endothelial origin (Fox et al 2005) . Cytological atypia, abnormal vessel formation and inappropriate proliferation and behaviour assisted in the differentiation of neoplasia (lymphangiosarcoma and haemangiosarcoma) from normal vascular endothelial cells. The absence of significant amounts of blood within the abnormal vascular channels was used to discriminate between lymphangiosarcoma and haemangiosarcoma in these cases. Recently new markers (lymphatic vessel endothelial receptor-1 (LYVE-1), podoplanin and PROX-1)) have been developed which are capable of distinguishing neoplastic endothelial cells from normal blood and lymphatic endothelium (Galeotti et al 2004) . LYVE-1 has been used to successfully diagnose lymphangiosarcoma in cats (Galeotti et al 2004) . Use of these newer markers may improve the ability to detect lymphangiosarcoma in cats in the future.",

No signs of metastasis were detected at initial presentation; however, both cats developed signs of disease progression within weeks. No curative treatments are currently available for dogs or humans affected by the condition, with the majority surviving only a few months after diagnosis (Williams 2005) . Surgical excision in case 2 did not seem to significantly alter the progression of disease, with euthanasia occurring secondary to extensive spread of the neoplasm within 3 weeks. The previously reported cat with lymphangiosarcoma of the left forelimb lived for 10 months after amputation before widespread metastases led to euthanasia (Walsh and Scott 1984) ; however, all other reported cases had much shorter survival times. Had amputation been performed more promptly in case 2, survival time may have increased. The benzopyrone drug rutin was used in case 2 with the aim of reducing lymphoedema by promoting proteolysis, stimulating macrophages and enhancing the absorption of protein fragments (Mertens et al 2005) . It was not effective.",
