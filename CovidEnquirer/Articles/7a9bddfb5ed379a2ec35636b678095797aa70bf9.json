There are four established serotypes of human rotaviruses, but all share a common group antigen. In recent years, viruses that have rotavirus morphology but do not have the group antigen have been discovered and have been referred to as pararotaviruses, novel rotaviruses, or non-group-A rotaviruses (conventional rotaviruses are now classified as group-A rotaviruses). The vast majority of rotavirus gastroenteritis, however, appears to be caused by the conventional types. Transmission of the viruses is thought to be primarily by the fecal-oral route, although transmission through food and water has been suggested. Both virusspecific IgA and virus antigen have been detected in pharyngeal secretions (7) , which suggests that transmission may occur via a respiratory route as well. The maximal viral shedding in stools occurs from 2 to 5 days after the onset of diarrhea (7) .",

The viruses in this group include, in addition to Norwalk virus, Snow Mountain virus, Hawaii virus, MC virus, and Taunton virus. All of these viruses cause similar clinical symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea in approximately 70% of patients. Epidemics occur year round but are most frequent in the winter and early spring. For this reason, Norwalk virus outbreaks were once referred to as \"winter vomiting disease.\" The course of the disease is usually 1 to 3 days but may last more than 3 days in some people. Hospitalization is rarely required, except for patients with se-vere dehydration or other debilitating diseases. In approximately 30% of patients, symptoms may include headache, fever, and abdominal pains or cramps. Norwalk virus infection may also be asymptomatic. Peak virus content in stools occurs during the onset of illness and is below detectable levels 3 days later (11) .

All of the tests use human immune serum as the source of virus-specific antibody and virus-positive stool as a control. Unfortunately, these requirements restrict use of these tests to the few laboratories possessing the reagents. Monoclonal antibodies reactive with astroviruses by ELISA have been prepared (4), but their efficacy in detecting virus in stools has not yet been established. A polyclonal ELISA reagent has been described for calicivirus antigen detection (22) , but its utility in clinical diagnosis requires further evaluation.",

A similar lack of protection was found in a study of Gambian children.

The investigators concluded that the degree of protection was similar to that obtained with the bovine rotavirus vaccine. It has been noted in this study and others that the rhesus rotavirus vaccine may cause side effects similar to natural rotavirus infection and therefore must be given at 100-to 1,000-fold lower infective doses than the bovine vaccine. This has led Vesikari et al (24) to conclude that the bovine strain may be overattenuated and the rhesus rotavirus vaccine too underattenuated for use in humans.",

Clearly, a successful rotavirus vaccine needs to be effective with the population groups at greatest risk for developing severe rotavirus illness, i.e., infants and young children in developing countries. As to the present vaccine situation, sufficient reports are available to conclude that the bovine RIT 4237 and the rhesus rotavirus vaccines are effective in preventing severe rotavirus diarrhea (but not necessarily infection) in developed, temperate zone countries but that no vaccine has as yet been shown to be effective in developing countries.",
