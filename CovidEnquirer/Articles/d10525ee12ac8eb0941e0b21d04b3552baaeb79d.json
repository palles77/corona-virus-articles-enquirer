The innermost layer is composed of the core-shell proteinVP2 that encloses 62 the replication intermediates, composed of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase VP1, and 63 the guanylyl-methyl transferase, VP3. The intermediate layer is formed by VP6 that 64 surrounds the VP2 layer to form double-layered particles (DLPs). Finally, the addition of the 65 glycoprotein VP7 and the spike protein VP4 onto the DLPs forms the infectious triple-layered 66 particles (TLPs) (1, 2). 67 The replication of rotavirus occurs in cytoplasmic non-membranous electron-dense 68 inclusions termed viroplasms composed of NSP2, NSP5, VP1, VP2, VP6 and host 69 components (1, 3).

It has been shown that the 74 cytoplasm oriented-terminus of NSP4 associates with VP4 (8), and binds the VP6 on DLPs 75 acting as a receptor for these particles to mediate their budding into the ER (9, 10). Moreover, 76 NSP4 has been shown to also interact with VP7 through its N-terminus oriented to the ER 77 lumen (11, 12). It has been proposed that these interactions drive the incorporation of the 78 outer layer proteins into the transitory lipid envelope that DLPs acquire during ER membrane 79 budding; this envelope is removed in the lumen of the ER by an unknown process in which 80 NSP4 is eliminated while VP4 and VP7 are assembled to produce the final infectious TLPs 81 All rights reserved.

Although the precise mechanism of the final steps of rotavirus assembly is not well 82 understood, it has been found that VP7 structure forms trimers on the surface of the virion in 83 a calcium-dependent process (15)(16)(17)(18). 84 Due to the high complexity of rotavirus replication, many of the cellular factors and 85 molecular mechanisms involved in this process are poorly characterized. However, it has 86 been recently reported that the coatomer protein I (COPI)/Arf1 machinery is essential for 87 virus replication since knocking-down by RNA interference (RNAi) the expression of some 88 of the proteins that integrate such machinery reduces virus replication (19, 20). Also, 89 brefeldin A (BFA), an inhibitor of the COPI/Arf1-mediated vesicular transport, significantly 90 impairs the rotavirus progeny yield (21). COPI is a protein complex formed by seven subunits 91 (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b2\u00b4, \u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b3 and \u03b6-COP) that mediates the retrograde transport of vesicles from the Golgi 92 apparatus to the ER (22-24). Besides its canonical functions in the secretory pathway, the 93 COPI/Arf1 machinery also may participate in the maturation of early endosomes and in 94 recycling proteins to the plasma membrane (25, 26), as well as in the maturation of 95 phagosomes (27, 28) and peroxisomes (29). Furthermore, multiple reports suggest that the 96 COPI/Arf1 machinery is also involved in transport events involved in the maturation and 97 function of lipid droplets (LDs) (30-32).",

This 24 reduction in virus yield was related to a block in virus assembly since in the presence of either 25 BFA or GCA the assembly of infectious mature triple-layered virions was significantly 26 prevented and only doubled layered-particles were detected. We report that the catalytic 27 activity of GBF1, but not the activation of Arf1, is essential for the assembly of the outer 28 capsid of rotavirus. We show that both BFA and GCA, as well as interfering with the 29 synthesis of GBF1, alter the electrophoretic mobility of glycoproteins VP7 and NSP4 and 30 block the trimerization of the virus surface VP7, a step required for its incorporation into 31 virus particles. Although a post-translational modification of VP7 (other than glycosylation) 32 could be related to the lack of trimerization, we found that NSP4 might also be involved in 33 this process, since knocking-down its expression reduces VP7 trimerizarion.

We 129 also showed that this restriction in the assembly of TLPs is the result of a damage in VP7 130 trimerization required for its assembly into DLPs. We provide evidence suggesting that an 131 altered post-translational modification (different from glycosylation) of either VP7 or NSP4 132 in GBF1-inactivated cells is responsible for the defective formation of VP7 trimers. 133 Altogether, our findings suggest that GBF1 activity is essential for the rotavirus outer capsid 134 assembly by allowing the correct processing of VP7 and/or NSP4, possibly through a 135 mechanism independent of Arf1. was then added to cells in the presence of the inhibitors for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Then, the virus 144 inoculum was removed, and fresh media containing the inhibitors were added; 12 h post 145 infection (hpi), cells were harvested, and the viral yield was determined. We found that 146 treatment with BFA (at a concentration of 0.5 \u03bcg/ml or higher) reduced by more than 100-147 fold the viral yield ( Fig 1A) ; this observation is in agreement with a previous report (21).",

Since no infectious virus was 377 produced under those conditions, it was also proposed that the altered oligosaccharide 378 processing of VP7 was responsible for the defective assembly of viral particles. Our results 379 indicate that, at least for VP7, the altered electrophoretic mobility is independent of its The observation that silencing the expression of GBF1 induced changes in the mobility of 388 both VP7 and NSP4 suggests that the activity of this cellular factor is essential for the correct 389 processing of both proteins. Taking into consideration that GBF1 functions at the ER-Golgi 390 interface and that rotaviruses mature in the ER, it seems likely that Golgi-ER transport is the 391 relevant process required for the correct maturation of rotavirus infectious particles. 392 However, considering that LDs have been proposed to play a significant role in the 393 replication cycle of rotaviruses, it remains possible that the protein transport between the ER 394 membrane and LDs is needed for the correct processing of both VP7 (glycosylation 395 independent) and NSP4. However, an unknown function of GBF1 cannot be discarded.
