In fact, we now know where the frameshift occurs. We also know a great deal about what information is present in RNA for aligning the different reading frames. In addition, we know how the different reading frames are aligned and we have some insight into how the frameshift is accomplished; i.e. how the fidelity of translation is maintained during the repositioning of the ribosome on the mRNA.",

The gag gene encodes the structural proteins of the virus and the pol gene encodes the replication enzymes, reverse transcriptase and integrase. The replication enzymes are usually synthesized at a 5-10% level of the Gag proteins. The pro gene, which encodes the viral protease, can be expressed in the same reading frame as gag and pol or in a separate reading frame overlapping gag and/or pol. For example, in mammalian type C retroviruses, the pro and pol genes are expressed through suppression of the termination codon at the end of gag by a glutamine tRNA10; and thus, the same reading frame is maintained in translation of gag and pol. This means of expressing the Gag-Pol fusion protein is designated as in-frame readthrough ( Fig. 1) . In other retroviruses, the genes downstream of gag occur in different reading frames. Expression of the Gag-Pro-Poi fusion protein in some of these retroviruses requires a single frameshift event in the -1 direction to align the different reading frames, whereas expression in others requires two such events, one between gag and pro and the other between pro and pot (Fig. 1) .",

The site of the frameshift is the 3' base at the end of the heptanucleotide signal (designated with an arrow in Fig. 2 ). This was demonstrated by sequencing the transframe protein or peptide, synthesized either in vivo8 or in vitro (Refs 15 and 18, and S. H. Nam, T. D. Copeland, M. Hatanaka and S. Oroszlan, unpublished), through the frameshift site (see Fig. 2 ). The data show, for example, that leucine and isoleucine are generated from the UUAUA sequence in RSV (where UUA is the 3' terminal codon of the frameshift signal)Is; and isoleucine is read in the -1 frame by AUA and leucine in the 0 frame by either UU (if the frames are aligned by two out of three base reading) or UUA (if the frames are aligned by overlapping reading). Similarly, asparagine and proline are generated from the AACCA sequence in the pro--pol HTLV-1 overlapping reading frame (where AAC is the 3' terminal codon of the frameshift signal); and proline is read in the -1 frame by CCA and asparagine in the 0 frame by either AA or AAC.

As noted, mutagenesis studies show that only the seven nucleotide stretch is required at the frameshift sitelS,]~ for the shift to occur. This conclusion is supported by other studies in which efficient frameshifting is maintained when the codon immedi- ately upstream (in the -1 frame) and that immediately downstream (in the 0 frame) of the heptanucleotide frameshift signal in coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus 0BV) are replaced with nonsense codons (i.e. the frameshift window consists of only a seven nucleotide stretch; S. lnglis, pets. commun.). The second type of information which has an important role in frameshifting is RNA secondary structure. Stem-loop structures occur just downstream of the gag--pol and of the gag-pro and pro-pol retroviral frameshift sitesTj3,~s,~a,~9 as well as just down-stream of the frameshift site in IBV20. 21 . In RSV, disruption of base pairings within the stem by generating specific stem-destabilizing mutations results in a decrease in frameshifting, while restoring these base pairings by generating specific stem-restabilizing mutations rescues frameshifting~5. Deletion of certain bases further downstream of the stem-loop structure in IBV also inhibits frameshifting suggesting that many of these downstream bases interact with the stem-loop resulting in a tertiary structure known as a pseudoknot2L The occurrence and role of pseudoknots in retroviruses and in Fig. 3 . Location of the stem-loop structure relative to the frameshift site is also important since altering the distance between these two elements by as few as three nucleotides in either direction inhibits frameshifting2L Furthermore, the stem-loop structures are thermodynamically highly stable and their involvement in frameshifting is statistically relevant relative to other such configurations which may occur within several hundred nucleotides upstream or downstream of the frameshift site 24. It seems, therefore, that the ribosomal frameshift event requires a carefully positioned downstream stemloop structure for efficient frameshifting which may function to pause translation long enough for the shift to occur.

Since the sequence of the transframe peptide shows that the shift has to occur at the codon of which this is the third base, this suggests that the alignment must occur by doublet decoding. However, as sound as this argument may seem, the sequence of a transframe peptide generated from a frameshift signal containing a mutation in the 3' base demonstrates that the alignment occurs by overlapping reading. A single base change at the 3' end of the frameshift signal results in two new amino acids in the transframe protein. That is, alteration of the RSV UUAUA sequence, which codes for leucine (UUA) in the 0 frame and isoleucine (AUA) in the -1 frame, to UUUUA (where U represents the altered base which occurs at the 3' end of the frameshift signal) results in the occurrence of phenylalanine (UUU) and leucine (UUA) in the transframe proteinls (see Fig. 2 ). This observation demonstrates that the base at the 3' end of the frameshift signal must be read twice; once in the 0 frame and once in the -1 frame 8. Thus, alignment of the different reading frames occurs by overlapping reading of the 3' nucleotide at the end of the frameshift signal (Fig. 2) .",

We do not know precisely the means by which the frameshift is carried out, but the simultaneous-slippage model proposed by Jacks et al.,s provides the best explanation of the frameshift event at present. In this model, the peptidyl-tRNA located in the P-site and the aminoacyl-tRNA located in the A-site are proposed to slip simultaneously by one base in the 5' direction resulting in both tRNAs misreading the 3' base or reading two out of three bases in the corresponding mRNA. The slippage prepares the ribosome to read the -1 frame. In the next step, normal transfer of the growing polypeptide to the aminoacyl-tRNA and its translocation to the P-site would bring the first codon in the -1 frame to the A-site. The -1 reading is then consummated with normal decoding of the A-site and transfer of the nascent peptide to the incoming aminoacyl-tRNA.",

Otherwise, the ribosome:codon:anticodon complex may be destabilized and fall apart. Within the heptanucleotide signal, the base in the 3' position of the upstream codon in the 0 frame (i.e. U, A or G) is identical to the bases in the first two positions of the downstream codon (i.e. UU, AA or GG, respectively; see columns A-C, Fig. 4) . Thus, the shift to the new reading frame maintains similar codon:anticodon interactions provided the isoacceptors in the A-and P-sites misread the base in the 3' position of the codon or read only two out of three bases. It should be noted that two out of three base reading cannot be distinguished from misreading the 3' base of the codon in many cases. There is a direct relationship between promotion of frameshifting and misreading or reading two out of three bases, since the same tRNAs are involved in both processes (i.e. tRNAs that promote frameshifting must then, after the frameshift event, misread the 3' base of the corresponding new set of codons). Interestingly, tRNAs which lack a modified base in their anticodon loop are known to promote frameshifting2s and, for that matter, misreading26.2L A recent analysis of the tRNA in HIV infected cells showed that most of the Phe-tRNA lacked the highly modified Wye base in its anticodon loop, while in bovine leukemia virus (BLV) and HTLV-I infected cells most of the Asn-tRNA lacked the highly modified Q base in its anticodon loop 28. This study showed a correlation between the occurrence of hypomodified tRNAs in retroviral infected cells and their utilization in translating codons within the respective frameshift signals. The lack of a hypermodified base in the anticodon loop of tRNA would create more space in and around the frameshift site and greater flexibility of movement of the tRNA anticodon would be expected in the absence of a highly modified base. Thus, decoding of a hypomodified tRNA at the frameshift site may be a requirement for promoting frameshifting28.",
