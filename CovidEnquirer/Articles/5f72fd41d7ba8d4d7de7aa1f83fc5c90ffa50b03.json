We propose a timevarying sparse vector autoregressive (VAR) model to retrospectively analyze and visualize the dyamic transmission routes of this outbreak in mainland China over January 31 -February 19, 2020. Our results demonstrate that the influential interprovince routes from Hubei have become unidentifiable since February 4, whereas the self-transmission in each province was accelerating over February 4-15. From February 16, all routes became less detectable, and no influential transmissions could be identified on February 18 and 19. Such evidence supports the effectiveness of government interventions, including the travel restrictions in Hubei. Implications of our results suggest that in addition to the origin of the outbreak, virus preventions are of crucial importance in provinces with the largest migrant workers percentages (e.g., Jiangxi, Henan and Anhui) to controlling the spread of 2019-nCoV.",

Examples include tracing close contacts and quarantining infected cases, promoting social consensus on self-protection like wearing face mask in public area, among others [13] . With the unexpectedly rapidly growing number of confirmed cases, more extreme and unprecedented measures have taken places. On 23 January, the Chinese authorities introduced travel restrictions on five cities (Wuhan, Huanggang, Ezhou, Chibi and Zhijiang) of Hubei, shutting down the movement of more than 40 million people [14] . Among existing research, most argues that those interventions have effectively halted the spread of the 2019-nCoV [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] .",

Rather than employing the SEIR, we develop a time-varying coefficient sparse vector autoregressive (VAR) model. Using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) [39, 40] and the local constant kernel smoothing estimator [41] , our model is capable of estimating the dynamic high-dimensional Granger causality coefficient matrices. This enables the detection and visualization of time-varying inter-province and self-transmission routes of the 2019-nCov on the daily basis. The resulting \"road-map\" can help policy-markers and public-health officers retrospectively evaluate both the effectiveness and unexpected outcomes of their interventions. Such an evaluation is critical to winning the current battle against 2019-nCoV in China, providing useful experience for other countries facing the emerging threat of this new coronavirus, and saving lives when a new epidemic occurs in the future.",

For example, the ij th entry in B t measures the strength of the transmission from province i to province j on day t. The i th diagonal of B t represents the self-transmission in province i that captures the relationship between the growth rate in the current and previous days. More critically, the sparse structure eases the interpretation of B t because many weak transmissions may be of a random nature. The corresponding coefficients, therefore, can be treated as noises and are shrunk to zeros exactly. Moreover, a timevarying design of B t allows us to investigate changes in the identified transmissions over time.",

The coefficients \u03b2 i,j,t denotes the ij th entry of the Granger causality matrix B t , and \u03bb is the tuning parameter that aims to shrink insignificant \u03b2 i,j,t to zero and thus controls the sparsity of B t . Another essential feature of our proposed model is that the adaptive weights w i,j,t are employed to penalize \u03b2 i,j,t differently in the lasso (L1) penalty [39, 40] . The choice of weights w i,j,t takes account of the prior knowledge about the transmissions and can be specified by the users. In this study, we consider w i,j,t as the reciprocal of the accumulated confirmed in province i on day t \u2212 1. That is, the growth rate of a province with a smaller accumulated confirmed cases is less likely to influence the growth rates of others, and thus, more likely to be shrunk to zero.

Altogether, our modeled sample contains 20 province-level confirmed cases. A non-zero estimate of \u03b2 i,j,t , the ij th entry of B t in (2), indicates that on the t th day, the growth rate of province j is Granger caused by that of province i. In other words, there is a transmission route from province i to province j. Among the 20-day results, we noticed that the estimated transmission routes on days 1-5 changed considerably on daily basis. From the sixth day onwards, however, those estimated routes were more steady. Hence, we plot the estimates on days 1-5 and those on the every fifth day thereafter, on Figure 2 .

According to [43] , the average incubation period of 2019-nCoV is up to 10 days. Thus, our estimated dynamic transmission routes supports the significant effectiveness of the interventions taken by the Chinese authorities [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . This is evidenced by On the other hand, from February 5 to 16, Table 1 suggests that the averaged magnitudes of self-transmission on each day were strengthening steadily. This may also be explained by the interventions, which have effectively blocked inter-province transmissions, such that the growth rate of each province could only be caused by its internal transmissions.",

Apart from its geographic neighbors Jiangxi and Henan, Hubei has lead to influential routes to Heilongjiang, Zhejiang and Shandong directly. This may be explained by the substantial floating population working and living in Hubei from those provinces. Excluding routes originating in Hubei, the Panel B ofTable 2suggests that the top destinations of transmission routes have not changed much over the first four days and the rest sixteen days. Despite minor differences in ranking, Shaanxi, Heilongjiang, Jiangxi, Anhui, Henan and Jiangsu appear to be the destinations suffered most from inter-province transmissions from origins other than Hubei. Similarly, the top five sources (excluding Hubei) of those transmissions are basically identical over the days 1-4 and days 5-20, as shown in Panel C ofTable 2. This is consistent with the fact that travel restrictions in Hubei should not affect the connections among other provinces. In all cases, Jiangxi, Henan, Guangdong, Zhejiang and Anhui are the most influential origins other than Hubei.",

            "text": "visualizes the transmission routes in mainland China. Demonstrated in Figure 2, our baseline results review both the dynamic inter-province and self-transmission routes. Since February 4, the spread out of Hubei was largely reduced, leading to no identifiable routes to other provinces. Simultaneously, the self-transmissions started to accelerate and peaked on around February 15 for most provinces. Given an average incubation period of 10 days, those results support the argued effectiveness of the travel restrictions to control the spread of 2019-nCoV, which took place in multiple cities of Hubei on January 23. On February 18-19, there existed no influential interprovince or self-transmission routes. Thus, the growth rates of confirmed cases are of a more random nature in all provinces thereafter, implying that the spread of 2019-nCoV has been under control. For the detected inter-province transmissions, our findings demonstrate that Jiangxi, Heilongjiang, Zhejiang, Henan and Shandong are the top 5 provinces affected mostly via routes directly from Hubei. When the influence of Hubei is excluded, Jiangxi, Henan and Anhui are among both the top origins and destinations of transmission routes. Our results have major practical implications for public health decision-and policy-one thing, the implemented timely ad-hoc public health interventions are proven effective, including contact tracing, quarantine and travel restrictions. For another, apart from the origin of the virus, as provinces with largest migrant workers percentages, virus preventions are also of crucial importance in Jiangxi, Henan and Anhui to controlling the epidemics like the outbreak of 2019-nCoV in the future. With limited resources, taking ad-hoc interventions in such provinces may most effectively help stop the spread of a new virus, from an economic perspective.Author Contributions X.J. collected data and designed the research.
