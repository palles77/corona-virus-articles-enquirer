In comparison to traditional gel-based PCR assays, real time PCR offers increased sensitivity and specificity in a rapid format (turn around time from sample receipt to result <5 h). Unlike traditional systems, which rely upon endpoint analysis, real time PCR assays visualise the reaction as it is taking place allowing quantification and reaction analysis (e.g., PCR efficiency). Since real time PCR reactions are performed in a closed system (no gel analysis needed) the risk of contamination has been substantially reduced. This has also reduced the requirement for a stringent laboratory structure. The increasing number of chemistries and platforms available for real time PCR have reduced its overall cost significantly making this an increasingly attractive technique.",

            "text": "Molecular beacons are very specific (Tyagi and Kramer, 1996) . The specificity is a direct result of their structure. In free solution a molecular beacon adopts a hairpin-loop conformation in which the reporter fluorescence is quenched by its proximity to the quencher molecule ( Fig. 1 ). This is a very stable state and a molecular beacon will only bind to a target sequence, become linear and fluoresce if it is highly complementary. Any nucleotide differences between the beacon and the target sequence will greatly reduce the target binding efficiency of the probe. As a result molecular beacons have an increased propensity for false negative results. We encountered this problem during the implementation of a previously published molecular beacon based test for the detection of parainfluenza viruses. During the initial assessment, this detected all culture/direct immunoflorescence parainfluenza 3 positive samples detected between 2001 and 2002. However, all parainfluenza 3 positive samples detected by DIF or culture in 2003 were negative when tested with this assay. To assess whether the primers were amplifying the parainfluenza 3 viral RNA, SYBR green was added to the PCR reaction in place of the molecular beacon. The formation of PCR product was observed. Using melt curve analysis, identical melting peaks were observed in all parainfluenza 3 samples and controls (Fig. 2) . Running the PCR products on an agarose gel and observing a band of the expected size confirmed the successful amplification of parainfluenza 3 RNA by the primers. Based on these results we deduced that the molecular beacon was no longer complementary to the amplified target sequence. Consequently, following analysis of more recently available sequences in the database, a new molecular beacon was designed, which detected all 2003 parainfluenza 3 samples. Fig Unlike molecular beacons, dual labelled probes are in a permanent linear conformation (Lee et al., 1993) (Fig. 3) . Like primers, they can tolerate a small number of mismatches between the probe and target and still bind to the target. Consequently, dual labelled probes are less likely to result in false negative reactions and may, in comparison with molecular beacons, be of greater use in viral diagnosis where occasional changes in even the most conserved target sequence may be expected to occur (although it should be noted that mismatches can also lead to false negative reactions with dual labelled probes). However, either method will be useful if targeting a highly conserved region.",

Figure showing assessment of whether real time molecular beacon primers were amplifying the parainfluenza 3 viral RNA. In this reaction, SYBR green was added to the PCR reaction in place of the molecular beacon (all samples negative by molecular beacon assay). The formation of PCR product was observed. Using melt curve analysis, identical melting peaks were observed in all parainfluenza 3 samples and controls (http://probes.invitrogen.com/handbook/figures/0710.html). Fig . 3 . Dual labelled probes (also known as Taqman TM probes) are oligonucleotides that contain a fluorescent dye on the 5 base, and a quenching dye located on the 3 base. When excited the flourescent dye transfers energy to the nearby quenching dye molecule rather than fluorescing, resulting in a non-fluorescent probe. Dual labelled probes are designed to hybridize to an internal region of a PCR product. During PCR, when the polymerase replicates a template on which the probe is bound, the 5 -exonuclease activity of the polymerase cleaves the probe. This separates the fluorescent and quenching dyes and FRET no longer occurs, allowing detection of the signal from the reporter dye. Fluorescence increases in each cycle, proportional to the rate of probe cleavage. change in fluorescence ( R n ) produced during successful real time PCR. We have found in most, but not all cases, that dual labelled probes produce a greater fluorescent change than molecular beacons (Fig. 4) . A larger R n allows easier interpretation of results, as low positive results maybe more easily differentiated from the variable background. Dual labelled probes provide a greater fluorescent change as the reporter dye is irreversibly released from the quencher during the extension stage of each PCR cycle. Consequently there is a cumulative and permanent record of successful amplification, which is added to during subsequent PCR cycles. Molecular beacons are not destroyed at the end of each cycle, but return to free solution during the denaturation phase and revert back to their hairpin-loop structure. Consequently there is no accumulation of free reporter dye and the extra fluorescence produced is less after each cycle than when compared to dual labelled probes.",

            "text": "Since real time PCR is a relatively new technique, published assays may not be available for all viral pathogens. As a result many laboratories may wish to develop novel in-house real time PCR assays. The initial stages in developing a real time PCR assay are the same as those required for designing traditional gel based PCR tests. The first step is to identify a conserved region of the viral (or other pathogen) genome in which to design the assay. A literature review will often reveal which genes are conserved, and most often these will be genes encoding nonimmunogenic proteins. Once a gene is identified, a BLAST search (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) is performed to locate the most conserved regions within this gene. As real time amplicons are short and contain a third oligonucleotide (i.e., the probe), the ideal region to design an assay would be 100-150 nucleotides long with 3 regions of 30 bases devoid of all base degeneracies. It is best to find a conserved region of 400-500 bases to allow the software to identify a number of potential assays.

Below are outlined some general criteria that may prove useful when designing such assays. In order to design appropriate primers and probes users should follow the development protocols outlined above. However, care should be taken to ensure that there is no primer or probe interaction that may reduce the sensitivity or efficiency of the PCR reaction. Most primer design software will allow primer-probe interactions to be examined. In order to optimise the multiplex assay each separate PCR should be optimised separately before being assessed when added together (see above section for details). Further experiments should include assessing the sensitivity of the multiplex assay for the simultaneous detection of mixed infections (real or spiked) and low copy targets in high copy backgrounds. Ideally, no loss in sensitivity should be observed when additional primers are added. However, if the multiplex assay is less sensitive, altering the ratio of primers/probes concentrations may prove useful. Alternatively, changing the concentration of PCR reagents (enzyme, Mg 2+ , dNTPs etc.) may also be beneficial. Some manufacturers are now producing real time reaction mixes specifically designed for use with multiplex assays, and provide guidelines on the optimal primer and probe concentrations to use. However, if all these factors fail to improve the sensitivity of the multiplex assay then some or all of the primer and probes may have to be redesigned.",

The production of a large number of aliquots at the same time (sufficient for approximately 3000 tests) also facilitates inter-run reproducibility and assists in maintaining the quality of the results. While some mix is unavoidably wasted, the time saved and the reduced number of failed runs compensates for this cost, and during the summer months when sample numbers are much reduced, smaller aliquots can be prepared. Table 7 shows the CT values obtained from the coronavirus triplex assay using pooled primers and probed stored for up to 6 weeks, demonstrating the stability of the reagents when stored at \u221220 \u2022 C. We have now been using the same lot number of pooled primer-probe for the coronavirus assay for in excess of 10 weeks without loss of performance. With this system and pooled controls (see below) in use, we are now able to provide an efficient and reliable. 3.6.2. Frozen pools of primers, probes, mastermix and enzyme The use of aliquots of frozen mastermix (containing all PCR reagents except template) is an alternative to frozen primer and probe aliquots described above. The laboratory user need only remove the desired number of aliquots (or plates if frozen in this format), defrost and then add the template to be tested. Frozen aliquots are easier to use than the pooled primer and probe method, facilitate rigorous quality control and reduce the overall turn around times. However, they are less flexible than the primer probe aliquot system and wastage will be more expensive as it includes enzyme. Furthermore, any mistakes in the making up of the aliquots will result in the loss of primers and probe and expensive mastermix. We have shown, using positive controls, that both RNA and DNA mastermix from a number of companies (Applied Biosystems, Invitrogen, and Qiagen) can be frozen for at least 1 month with no loss of sensitivity.",

Some platforms allow multicomponent analysis of weak positive traces. This allows users to assess the changes of each fluorescent label in the reaction.
