An overabundance of caution is certainly prudent, but with the latest discovery-that the virus was documented in dromedary camels as long ago as 1992 3 -interpretation of the epidemiology has become more diffi cult. Are the recently identifi ed cases in Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia new, or a part of a long series of human disease? Improved collaboration between clinicians, scientists, and public health authorities will be necessary to understand the epidemiology and defi ne the sources and modes of transmission.",

But the meaningful collaboration that helped the scientifi c community to rapidly identify the SARS coronavirus has not been seen recently. Collaborative research into MERS coronavirus has been scarce, with investigations marked by bitter disagreements between public health authorities and scientists about the virus' discovery and the ensuing publications, processes, and patenting of products. 6 The recent disagreements played out in the media raise several issues that should be addressed. Key among them is the absence of a consensus-built governance agreement for public health investigation and research when an event is recognised as a global public health emergency. Such an agreement would include the controversial issues of how to share animal and human specimens, investigational products (eg, pathogens and viral isolates), and intellectual property (eg, public health surveillance data and scientifi c publications). Without agreement about the mutually benefi cial roles, responsibilities, and legitimate contributions of clinicians, scientists, and public health authorities, parties end up either encroaching on one another or not communicating-both of which are happening now with respect to MERS coronavirus.",

Governance should be built around One Health, an interdisciplinary collaboration between human and veterinarian medicine and health, because economic loss is an important consideration (as can be seen from the negative economic eff ect of the present infl uenza H7N9 outbreak 9 ). Additional steps should be taken to protect the economic interests of farmers and livestock owners. Livestock insurance schemes, already used for protection against drought, could be used for reimbursement. 10 The development of a global biological risk management fund to share the burden of economic loss would enhance the mission of the 2005 International Health Regulations (IHRs).",

The pandemic infl uenza preparedness framework 11 is a commendable start, but is limited in scope and does not provide guidance for data sharing for non-infl uenza viruses or other biological specimens. Recent discussions within the Convention on Biological Diversity in Nagoya, Japan, 12 are also a step forward with respect to the ownership of biological materials.",
