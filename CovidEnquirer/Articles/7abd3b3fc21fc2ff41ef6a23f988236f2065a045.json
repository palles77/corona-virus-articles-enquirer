A closer linkage between science and program was an explicit goal of the center's formation, and NCIRD has been on the cutting edge of applying advances in technology to public health. In April 2006, the new center brought scientific units responsible for epidemiologic and laboratory aspects of most vaccine-preventable and other acute respiratory infectious diseases together with programs supporting public sector immunization. The center's activities aligned to address 8 initial strategic priorities (Table 1) .",

The expanded list of newly vaccine-preventable diseases meant response in areas traditionally managed by communicable disease units relied on immunization expertise, and the newer vaccines in turn required enhanced laboratory-based surveillance for accurate postlicensure evaluations. The mission of NCIRD was to prevent disease, disability, and death through immunization and control of respiratory and related infectious diseases. The center embedded field staff within and provided funding and technical assistance to state, local, and territorial health departments to strengthen detection, prevention, and control of these conditions, with particular emphasis on childhood immunization, influenza, and emerging respiratory infectious disease threats. The center also housed several World Health Organization (WHO) International Collaborating Centers and provided leadership for global laboratory networks for influenza, polio, measles, rotavirus, and bacterial meningitis, among others.",

Licensure of several vaccines and shifting epidemiology in selected vaccine-preventable diseases placed a premium on strong surveillance and evaluation systems to provide evidence needed for policy. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) released numerous recommendations during this period ( Table 2) . Clinicians developed an adolescent platform to permit delivery of vaccines to children 11-12 years of age. The program introduced the National Immunization Survey-Teen (a large telephone survey of parents, with healthcare provider verification of records) in 2006 to monitor coverage of immunizations in persons 13-17 years of age. Expanded monitoring of influenza vaccine coverage relied on several new techniques, including leveraging hospital reporting to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which incentivized reporting of influenza vaccination of healthcare workers.",

NCIRD implemented changes that modernized the nation's immunization infrastructure and strengthened the program's efficiency. Establishment of a centralized vaccine distribution system in 2008 eliminated 99% of the 430 vaccine depots that states previously relied on to store vaccines, resulting in direct shipping to >40,000 provider sites, with reduced inventory costs and waste. NCIRD replaced a DOS-based vaccine ordering and management system with the vaccine tracking system VtrkS (https://www.cdc.gov/ vaccines/programs/vtrcks/index.html), an SAP-enabled data management and analytic system (https://www.sap. com/products/data-services.html), thereby improving the accountability of the CDC multibillion-dollar vaccine supply chain. Improvements in immunization information systems (i.e., registries) have been slowed by diversity of registries in states; barriers to interstate data sharing; and incomplete records, particularly for adult vaccinations. Investments focused on increasing their interoperability with electronic medical records, expanding physician use, developing clinical decision support tools (e.g., prompts for which vaccine doses are due or overdue), and improving efficiency and accuracy of data entry.",

Scientists in industry and academia have advanced molecular detection for respiratory pathogens during this period, and NCIRD staff capitalized on advancements to apply tools to the public health need for detection of respiratory infections (13) Several advances probably contributed to the decrease in all-cause pneumonia hospitalizations. Pediatric use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) averted an estimated 47,000 (43%) hospitalizations in children <2 years of age and 168,000 pneumonia hospitalizations in all age groups by 7-9 years after introduction of 7-valent PCV (PCV7) vaccine (19) . Although increases in drug-resistant nonvaccine serotype invasive pneumococcal disease occurred, an expanded serotype formulation, a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13), replaced PCV7 in 2010. The Active Bacterial Core surveillance of the Emerging Infections Program Network conducted studies of serotype-specific changes in invasive pneumococcal disease during the decade, which suggest that much of the decrease in adult pneumococcal illness was caused by reduced transmission of vaccine-type pneumococci from vaccinated children to adults (20) . In addition, highly active antiretroviral therapy reduced the extremely high risk for pneumonia among persons infected with HIV and likely lowered all-cause pneumonia burden in this population (21) .",

Additional cases in California, Texas, New York, and Mexico led to recognition of the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic. Elderly populations had some cross-protection against the virus, but children and younger adults were disproportionately affected (42) . Facilitated by preparedness investments, the influenza laboratory of NCIRD was able to adapt a PCR test for detection of the pandemic H1N1 virus, obtain Emergency Use Authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration, and rapidly ship new diagnostic test kits to states and 153 countries (38) . CDC and its partners rapidly prepared a candidate vaccine virus so that the multiple steps of vaccine manufacturing could get under way quickly. The pandemic response effort of CDC supported epidemiologic and virologic investigations, adapted the centralized vaccine distribution system used for the Vaccines for Children Program, and made 330,000 shipments of monovalent influenza vaccine. CDC worked with state and local health departments to support vaccination at high-throughput public clinics, private provider offices, occupational clinics and, eventually, pharmacies. During October-December 2009, more than 80 million persons in the United States received the monovalent H1N1 vaccine. The pandemic response incorporated risk communication strategies, frequent media briefs, and messages shared through trusted community-based partners to reach diverse populations. The initial response included large numbers of school closures, which were highly disruptive. Updated policy advised more limited use of school dismissals.",

Business drivers to improvements in electronic health records and fragmentation of the public health enterprise (e.g., different immunization registries in each state) have limited progress. Another challenge has been lower than expected vaccine performance (e.g., acellular pertussis, live attenuated influenza vaccine). Development of influenza vaccines with broader protection is a priority, but their availability remains years away. Decreasing survey response rates threaten continuity of health monitoring, while the potential of big data for conditions requiring precise laboratory confirmation, such as respiratory pathogens, might be limited.
