            "text": "Most patients with diagnosed CAP are treated empirically and the role of microbiological testing for patients with CAP is still a matter of debate. 7 However there is a clear rationale for establishing the causative agent to allow the optimal selection of agents against a specific pathogen and to limit the misuse of antibiotics and its consequences; it is also important to identify pathogens associated with notifiable diseases such as Legionnaires' disease and tuberculosis. 21 The possible involvement of MERS-CoV is an additional, current, reason. Knowledge of the etiological agent of pneumonia-related illness is a challenging step in the management of pneumonia in Hajj. [1] [2] [3] 17 In general, the identification of the etiology of CAP remains difficult in any setting despite advances in microbiological and serological methods. Molecular diagnostic tests for common and atypical causative pathogens of CAP are now available and have increased the diagnostic yield and decreased the time required to render results dramatically. [22] [23] [24] Although many pathogens have been associated with CAP, a small range of key pathogens are the cause of most cases. Internationally, the predominant pathogen in CAP is S. pneumoniae. 7,10 Other causative agents include, but are not limited to, H. influenzae, M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, Legionella spp, Chlamydia psittaci, Coxiella burnetii, enteric Gram-negative bacteria (Enterobacteriaceae), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, anaerobes, and respiratory viruses (influenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, coronavirus). 7, 8 The frequencies of other causes, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, C. psittaci, C. burnetii, Francisella tularensis, and endemic fungi (histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis) vary between epidemiological settings. 7 Recently, MERS-CoV has also emerged as a cause of serious illnesses including pneumonia and is the subject of worldwide concern. 11 The primary objective of the study was to determine if MERS-CoV was the cause of the severe pneumonia in the hospitalized patients. Our results indicate that MERS-CoV was not the etiological agent of the illness. These results support previous reports suggesting that MERS-CoV has not so far been problematic during Hajj. A study conducted during the 2013 Hajj, the same year as our study, found no evidence of MERS-CoV nasal carriage among 5235 Hajj pilgrims screened. Two reports on French pilgrims during the 2012 and 2013 Hajj seasons also reported a lack of MERS-CoV nasal carriage among the pilgrims screened despite a high rate of respiratory symptoms. 25, 26 We found S. pneumoniae to be prevalent in the sputum samples. This is in accordance with many international reports. 7,10 Studies performed during previous Hajj seasons have reported the organism as a cause of respiratory tract infections including penumonia. 3, 17, 18 For example, among 395 sputum samples collected from Hajjis with respiratory tract infections in 1991 and 1992, S. pneumoniae was detected in 4.8% and 12.3%, respectively. 27 Among the 64 patients with pneumonia admitted to two tertiary hospitals in Makkah during the 1994 Hajj, S. pneumoniae was detected in 9.4% of the cases. 17 3 In addition to S. pneumoniae, other common pathogens identified in our sputum samples were H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, and viral agents, in particular human rhinovirus, influenza A virus, and human coronaviruses. Studies from the Gulf Corporation Council (GCC) states have found similar results. The common pathogens causing CAP in GCC states were found to be S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis. 28, 29 In addition, the importance of atypical pathogens including M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and L. pneumophila in the etiology of CAP in the GCC region has been documented. 28 Other etiologies, particularly influenza viruses, varicella zoster virus, and M. tuberculosis, are increasingly recognized as causative pathogens of CAP within the region. 28 In the context of Hajj, in addition to S. pneumoniae, a number of other organisms have been reported as the cause of pneumonia. These include influenza A (H1N1), 3 M. tuberculosis, 1,3,17,18 S. aureus, 3 fungi such as Candida albicans, 3, 18 and Gram-negative organisms including P. aeruginosa, L. pneumophila, Acinetobacter sp, and members of the Enterobacteriaceae family. 3, 17, 18 Some, however, have dismissed many of these organisms as more likely to be respiratory tract colonizers rather than the causative agents. 30 In our study, respiratory pathogens were detected in 68.4% of sputum samples (26/38) and 80.7% (21/26) of these were positive for more than one pathogen. This is a higher proportion than that reported previously by Asghar et al., who isolated more than one pathogen in only 16.3% of the samples from 76 patients with confirmed CAP in the 2005 Hajj. 18 In another study, a higher percentage (35%) was reported. 24 The differences in detection rates may reflect the differences in identification methods used in the various studies.",

However, we detected a variety of pathogens in sputum samples of the patients, with most samples containing more than one agent. This observation, along with previous reports on CAP in Hajj, indicates that typical pneumonia treatment regimens may not work well during the Hajj season due to the wide variety of organisms that may be involved. This may necessitate more active investigations into the causes of pneumonia for identification and sensitivity testing in order to provide optimal treatment and a good outcome. Molecular methods can be a quick and sensitive means to determine the possible causative agents. Pneumonia is a significant illness during Hajj and interventions to reduce its burden during the pilgrimage should be adopted. Measures to reduce respiratory tract infections during Hajj are already in place. 31 Other strategies may include improved respiratory tract infection surveillance and optimization and dissemination of recommendations for adult vaccination. 32, 33 Continuous surveillance for MERS-CoV during Hajj and outside the pilgrimage season is crucial to monitor the MERS-CoV situation in Saudi Arabia.",

The RT-PCR reactions were performed in a Real Time LC 480 machine (Roche, IN, USA) under the following cycling profile: one cycle of 55 8C for 20 min, followed by one cycle of 94 8C for 3 min then 45 cycles of 94 8C for 15 s, 45 cycles of 58 8C for 30 s, and a single cycle of 40 8C for 30 s. A sample was confirmed MERS-CoV-positive if both RT-PCR assays were positive, as per current recommendations. 14 Nucleic acid was extracted from the samples using the MinElute Virus Spin Kit (Qiagen, Manchester, UK) following the manufacturer's instructions and eluted in 50 ml nuclease-free water. A 5-ml aliquot of each of the nucleic acid extractions was run on the respiratory multiplex array (Randox, Crumlin, UK), which is capable of detecting 22 bacterial and viral respiratory pathogens simultaneously. These are influenza virus A and B, human respiratory syncytial virus A and B, human parainfluenza virus 1, 2, 3 and 4, human coronavirus 229E/NL63 and OC43/HKU1, human rhinovirus A/B, human enterovirus A/B/C, human adenovirus A/B/C/D/E, human bocavirus 1/2/3, human metapneumovirus, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Haemophilus influenzae, Bordetella pertussis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.",
