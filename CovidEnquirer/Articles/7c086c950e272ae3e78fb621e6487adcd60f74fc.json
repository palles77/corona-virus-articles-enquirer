Emergency and Humanitarian Action is one of the youngest programmes of the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific. Despite its organizational size and budgetary limitations, it has endeavored to adequately respond to regional needs for preparedness and response. The paper further looks into approaches for strengthening preparedness, collaboration, and action for disasters and how a community-based approach should offer the best preparedness and response alternative for the region. Examples of country efforts are included. Community-based initiatives are taken as integral components of public health efforts for health emergency management. Thus, public health plays a very crucial role in emergencies. D",

From a management perspective, it would be better to adopt the concept of emergencies because one would have a better hand on it in terms of management control, in contrast with disasters over which one may not have control. 0531 Using a ''disaster'' perspective, classification may be just natural disasters or humangenerated disasters. However, if one were to look at it from an emergency management perspective, one should look at the typology of hazards: natural hazards, human-generated hazards, and hazards that cause complex emergencies. Table 1 illustrates the common hazards faced in the Western Pacific Region. Data from the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs state that, among the 617 natural disasters, 145 or 23.5% of major natural disasters were from the Western Pacific Region. Furthermore, reports from the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters show that, globally, during the last 10 years, 780,000 died, 1.6 million were injured, 82 million lost their homes, and 1.9 billion were affected by natural disasters. From these figures, 8.1% of those killed, 46.8% of those injured, 69.2% of the homeless, and 65.2% of those affected came from the Western Pacific Region.",
