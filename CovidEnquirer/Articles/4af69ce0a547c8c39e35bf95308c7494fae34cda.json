However, his chest X-ray also showed pneumonia. There was no way he could have connected his symptoms with that of his patient he had seen in the previous week. This all occurred in the couple of days before the term 'SARS' was coined and before the WHO sent out the alert on 13 March. Dr. L felt so unwell that he decided to cut short his stay in New York and he embarked on the next Singapore Airlines flight to return to Singapore. Just before he departed, he called a doctor friend in Singapore to announce that he was diagnosed with pneumonia and was returning home.",

The Director of the Communicable Diseases Center announced, \"We have an outbreak at hand, and it appears to be bigger than we thought\". We had no clue how big it was going to be, or what sinister effects it would have... The next two weeks, we lived with great uncertainty. These were the worst two weeks of the epidemic, for we neither knew what the causative agent was nor its mode of transmission nor its treatment. We were horrified to see one medical or nursing colleague after the other coming down with the disease. By now, the first patients that we had seen were starting to die.",

The Ministry in turn alerted Singapore Airlines and this led to the halt of the flight in Frankfurt. To his amazement, Dr. L was escorted from the airport in full protective gear, admitted to a Frankfurt hospital. Within hours, his name was in all the news media around the world. His pregnant wife also fell ill, but his mother-in-law for some mysterious reasons did not, although all three of them had been in close contact over a prolonged time. The passengers and crew were debriefed about SARS, the recognition of its symptoms and signs, and they were given advice to seek care if they developed any such indications.",

We screened hundreds of contacts in made up tents using portable X-rays. It soon became clear that as a sole department, we would not be able to cope with all the screening. The screening was therefore moved to the main building of Tan Tock Seng Hospital under the auspices of the Accident & Emergency Department. My travel clinic was closed and my staff had a change of job: from advising travelers and administering vaccines to taking their temperatures and asking about any respiratory symptoms.",

We also had to rationalize our gowns and gloves. Frustrations abounded as policies were changed almost daily. We wrote so many guidelines; and every day seemed to bring up a new revision of those from the previous day.

Many patients had died, but death struck really home when a young medical officer died on 7 April. His mother, a doctor, who had cared for him initially during his illness, was also struck by the disease. She eventually died. One of my infectious disease colleagues was admitted to hospital because of fever. Fortunately, her fever turned out to be due to the flu that she had caught from her kids, and she was discharged. Not long after, I started feeling unwell myself. I wondered \"Am I going to be the next?\" I was afebrile, but I decided to separate myself from my family, said farewell to my children and my dear husband from the distance, and spent the night isolated in a room. I measured my temperature every hour, ready to get myself admitted if it reached the threshold. Alone like this, I reflected over my life and wondered whether I was ready to die.

The hospital management under the leadership of Dr. Lim Suet Wuen arranged frequent staff updates; and the transparency increased our trust in the authorities.

It may sound strange but because of the implemented strict infection control measures I even felt safer in the hospital than outside. Never did I think that I should leave Singapore. There was only one moment when I seriously considered it: the newspaper suddenly announced that doctors whose spouses were also doctors but working in different hospitals should be separated. My husband is indeed a doctor in another hospital. I thought \"if they separate us, then I will separate myself from Singapore\".
