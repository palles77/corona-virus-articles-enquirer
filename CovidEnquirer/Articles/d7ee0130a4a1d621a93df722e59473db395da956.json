Here, a dual priming oligonucleotide (DPO)-based multiplex real-time SYBR Green RT-PCR assay were developed for accurately differentiating PEDV, TGEV, PoRV, and PDCoV in clinical specimens targeting the N gene of TGEV, PEDV, and PDCoV, and the VP7 gene of PoRV. Results showed that the DPO primer allowed a wider annealing temperature range (40-65\u00b0C) and had a higher priming specificity compared to conventional primer, in which more than 3 nucleotides in the 3\u2032-or 5\u2032-segment of DPO primer mismatched with DNA template, PCR amplification efficiency would decrease substantially or extension would not proceed. DPO-based multiplex real-time RT-PCR method had analytical detection limit of 8.63 \u00d7 10 2 copies/\u03bcL, 1.92 \u00d7 10 2 copies/\u03bcL, 1.74 \u00d7 10 2 copies/\u03bcL, and 1.76 \u00d7 10 2 copies/\u03bcL for PEDV, TGEV, PoRV, and PDCoV in clinical specimens, respectively. A total of 672 clinical specimens of piglets with diarrheal symptoms were collected in Northeastern China from 2017 to 2018 followed by analysis using the assay, and epidemiological investigation results showed that PEDV, TGEV, PoRV, and PDCoV prevalence was 19.05%, 5.21%, 4.32%, and 3.87%, respectively. The assay developed in this study showed higher detection accuracy than conventional RT-PCR method, suggesting a useful tool for the accurate differentiation of the four major viruses causing porcine viral diarrhea in practice.",

            "text": "Currently, porcine viral diarrhea is a major cause of high morbidity and high mortality in piglets and an important threat to the development of pig industry worldwide, resulting in significant economic losses [1] . Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and porcine rotavirus (PoRV) are the most common viral agents causing piglet diarrhea [2] . Moreover, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), since first reported in 2009, has become an important cause of newborn piglet diarrhea [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Sometimes, mixed infections in clinics are frequent. TGEV is a common cause of epidemic and endemic viral enteritis in neonates and senile pigs [10, 11] . Like TGEV, PEDV can cause severe enteritis in newborn piglets, but has higher mortality rate that may reach 100% during epidemics [12, 13] . PDCoV, as a newly emerging porcine intestinal coronavirus, can also cause enteritis and severe diarrhea in piglets [9] , leading to numerous economic losses for farmers in China. Its infection appears to be clinically milder with lower neonatal mortality rate of 30-40% compared to typical PEDV infection. PoRV is also a common cause of viral diarrhea diseases among newborn piglets [14, 15] . Infection with any of these viruses develops into similar clinical symptoms, including severe diarrhea and dehydration, and in some cases, mixed infections of these pathogens are common; therefore, it is difficult to distinguish them clinically [4, [16] [17] [18] Although virus isolation, immunofluorescence assay, and enzymelinked immunosorbent assays are standard diagnostic methods for viruses [19] , these techniques are time-consuming, relatively low in specificity and sensitivity, and therefore are not suitable for early diagnosis or epidemiological investigation of enterovirus-associated diseases. Currently, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods have been proven convenient and highly sensitive for detecting porcine diarrhea-associated viruses [20, 21] . Of them real-time SYBR Green PCR method that combines conventional PCR and fluorescent signal detection with advantages of high sensitivity, good repeatability, and intuitive results is widely used for epidemiological investigation and pathogen identification [22] [23] [24] . Moreover, the closed-tube detection of SYBR Green-based real-time PCR assay can effectively prevent aerosol pollution and reduce the incidence of false positives. However, the specificity of SYBR Green fluorescent dye is not so good that the melting curve of PCR product has to be used to confirm the amplification specificity. Therefore, primer design is the key to determining the detection specificity of SYBR Green-based real-time PCR method. However, the fundamental solution for eliminating false positive amplification still remains a challenge, which requires repeated optimization of primer parameters to achieve a high specificity, including primer specificity, primer length, melting temperature, GC content, less secondary structure, and PCR annealing temperature, in particular the development of a multiplex PCR assay.",

[25] , which can effectively eliminate non-specific priming without disrupting amplification of target sequences, showing higher specificity than conventional primers [25] [26] [27] [28] . Moreover, compared with conventional primer, the design process of DPO system is simpler and does not require repeated optimization of primer parameters. The position of 3\u2032-segment is firstly determined at a site containing 6-12 bases with 40-80% GC content, then five deoxyinosines are designated for the poly I linker, and then the sequence upstream of 3\u2032-segment is automatically extended to 18-25 bases until Tm > 65\u00b0C to generate the 5\u2032-segment [25] . Notably, DPO system allows a wide annealing temperature to effectively amplify target genes, indicating a promising tool for developing multiplex PCR assay. Several publications have reported the successful development of DPO-based multiplex PCR assay for simultaneous detection of multiple viral pathogens [26, 27, 29, 30] .",

Our results showed that DPO primers had a higher priming specificity than that of conventional primer; moreover, when there were more than three nucleotides mismatched between the 3\u2032-or 5\u2032-segment of DPO primer and template, PCR amplification would be inhibited substantially and even the extension would be terminated, while the amplification efficiency of conventional PCR primers would not be affected.",

The most common PCR method used is the real-time PCR method, which includes probe assay such as Taqman-probe and fluorescence dye assay such as SYBR Green dye. Both assays have their advantages and disadvantages. Of them both Taqman-probe and SYBR Green fluorescence dye have high sensitivity, and TaqMan-probe has high specificity but poor versatility, which is only suitable for specific gene detection, while SYBR Green fluorescence dye has strong versatility. Moreover, the cost of TaqMan-probe is higher than that of SYBR Green fluorescence dye. Therefore, in order to reduce the cost of detection, we utilized SYBR Green fluorescence dye to develop the real-time PCR assay. Primer design is the key to determine the specificity of both probe-and fluorescence dye-based real-time PCR method, which requires very rigid primer parameters. Generally, to obtain reliable primers, there should be repeated optimization of primer parameters, such as specificity, length, melting temperature, GC content, less secondary structure, and PCR annealing temperature, which is time-consuming, in particular the design of primers for developing a multiplex PCR assay.",

Compared with the conventional primer, DPO primer is easier because it does not require repeated optimization of primer parameters. Moreover, DPO primer has 2 obvious advantages, compared with conventional primer. Firstly, the priming specificity of DPO primer is stronger than that of conventional primer. We used the TGEV N gene with point mutations targeting the gene sequences designed for the 3\u2032or 5\u2032-segment of DPO primer as model to evaluate the priming specificity of the DPO primer. It was found that when five nucleotides mismatched with the template in the 5\u2032-segment of the DPO primer, the PCR amplification efficiency decreased substantially, while the PCR products were still observed via agarose gel electrophoresis assay and SYBR Green fluorescence assay. Additionally, when five nucleotides mismatched with the template in the 3\u2032-segment of DPO primer, the PCR amplification terminated and could not be analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis assay, whereas a very weak fluorescence signal with Ct value of approximately 33 was observed via SYBR Green fluorescence assay. Our results were somewhat inconsistent with previous report [25] , in which the researchers claimed that if there were 3 bp mismatched in the 3\u2032-segment or 5\u2032-segment of the DPO primer, the extension would not proceed. In any case, the priming specificity of DPO primer is stronger than that of conventional primers, which have a single priming region, and extension might proceed even in the presence of mismatch between primer and template. Moreover, the high specificity of DPO primers could effectively reduce the competitive effect between different primers, promoting the amplification efficiency indirectly, and although the optimal PCR product size generally recommended for SYBR Green-based protocols was below 200 nucleotides, there was little effect on the amplification efficiency for TGEV (180 bp), PEDV (251 bp), PoRV (318 bp), and PDCoV (400 bp) designed in this work, showing 94.551%, 101.283%, 95.347%, and 102.305%, respectively. Secondly, due to the specific structure of DPO primer, there is wide range of annealing temperature to effectively amplify the target gene with a nearly identical pattern. However, the conventional primers required optimal annealing temperature to amplify effectively, suggesting that the DPO primer was a powerful tool to develop multiplex PCR assay.",

Moreover, since SYBR Green-based PCR protocols rely on complex melting curves, they are no more sufficient for human diagnostics laboratories.
