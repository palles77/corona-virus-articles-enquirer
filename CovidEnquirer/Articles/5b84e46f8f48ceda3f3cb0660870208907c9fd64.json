Therefore, the removal of carbon constituents could reduce PCDD/Fs in fly ash greatly. In this study, the effects of the main flotation parameters on the removal of carbon constituents were investigated, and the characteristics of the final product were evaluated. The results showed that loss on ignition (LOI) of fly ash increased from 11.1% to 31.6% during conditioning process. By optimizing the flotation parameters at slurry concentration 0.05 kg/l, kerosene dosage 12 kg/t, frother dosage 3 kg/t and air flow rate 0.06 m 3 /h, 92.7% of the carbon constituents were removed from the raw fly ash. Under these conditions, the froth product has LOI of 56.35% and calorific values of 12.5 MJ/kg, LOI in the tailings was below 5%, and the total toxic equivalent (TEQ) of PCDD/Fs decreased from 5.61 ng-TEQ/g in the raw fly ash to 1.47 ng-TEQ/g in the tailings. The results show that column flotation is a potential technology for simultaneous separation of carbon constituents and PCDD/Fs from HSWI fly ash.",

Firstly, hospital solid waste contain more chlorine-containing scrap plastics like polyvinyl chloride compared with municipal solid waste, therefore the HSWI fly ash usually generally has a higher level of chloride and organic pollutants like PCDD/Fs (Wu et al., 2011) . The total toxic equivalent (TEQ) values of PCDD/Fs in some HSWI fly ash exceeded 20 ng I-TEQ/g . In addition, a lot of powder activated carbon was sprayed into exhaust gas before entering a bag filter for absorption of PCDD/Fs from flue gases to meet much more strictly emission regulations of the hospital solid waste incineration (<0.05 ng I-TEQ/Nm 3 ) (Chen et al., 2009) . Yan et al. (2007) found that carbon content in some of HSWI fly ash reached the range of 11.40-91.0% due to activated carbon injection. Both injected powder activated carbon and unburned carbon in solid waste were identified as the main carbon sources of fly ash (Kakuta et al., 2007) .",

Cementation is the most popular and inexpensive method for stabilizing fly ash, but it is difficult to solidify a HSWI fly ash since chlorides and activated carbon hinder the hydration of cement and bring a decrease of compressive strength (Colangelo et al., 2012; Zheng et al., 2011) . Melting can also provide an alternative because it can destroy PCDD/Fs at high temperatures and make various heavy metals inert through their incorporation into the glass matrix. This technique is also limited, however, because most chlorides are too volatile at high temperature over 1000\u00b0C to be confined into the vitreous products, which causes secondary pollution (Jiang et al., 2009) . Meanwhile, high carbon content in fly ash would accelerate the electrode erosion of plasma or arc melting furnace (Liu et al., 2011) . Recent reports have found that the water washing pre-treatment for fly ash can reduce undesirable side effect from high chloride in fly ash (Jiang et al., 2009; Zheng et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2011) . The appropriate water washing condition is washed twice in distilled water at a liquid-to-solid ratio of 10 or 20 for successful processing (Chiang and Hu, 2010; Liu et al., 2009) . However, water washing pretreatment cannot separate activated carbon from HSWI fly ash.",

Therefore, it is necessary to explore a physical method to separate carbon constituent in HSWI fly ash. The modern floatation technology was introduced to mineral industries in early 18th centuries. At present, the flotation technique has been applied not only in the mineral industry, but also pulp mills, rubber, waste battery, and environment engineers (Naik et al., 2005) . Column flotation is a sophisticated froth flotation technique, which has been developed as an alternative to the conventional, mechanically agitated flotation (Finch et al., 1995; Hasan and Hale, 2007) . Column flotation is the most effective method of separating the carbonaceous material from coal ash (Altun et al., 2009) . Atsushi et al. (2005) found that column flotation can clean up and reduce the PCDD/Fs-contaminated soil by removing selectively unburned carbon including a high PCDD/Fs concentration of incineration fly ash. Huang et al. (2007) successfully used column flotation to remove 64% of the unburned carbon, 41.9% of total PCDD/Fs and 40.8% of coplanar PCBs from MSW incinerator fly ash. These studies mostly pay attention to the removal of unburned carbon from MSW incinerator fly ash, few concern the fate and disposal of the final product after flotation.",

The ash sample was collected over a 7-day period. It was homogenized and passed through a sieve of 20 meshes, and then being dried at 105\u00b0C for 24 h for further analyses. The loss on ignition (LOI) was determined for the sample as the weight loss when sub-sample was kept at 600 \u00b1 25\u00b0C for 3 h in accordance with the standard for pollution control (GB18485-2001) . Table 1 shows the chemical composition and LOI of the raw fly ash. The raw fly ash and powder activated carbon were divided into five size ranges by sieves. The weight distribution, LOI and carbon distribution in each fraction were analyzed. XRD analysis of the sample was conducted with a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer.",

Each size fraction was analyzed for the carbon content, i.e. LOI. The results are given in Table 2 .

LOI is 19.35% of the finest fraction (\u00c025 lm) and LOI decreased with the increasing of particle size, which is opposition with coal fly ash whose carbon substance is enriched in the coarse size fraction (Altun et al., 2009) . Most of the carbon constituents of the raw fly ash distribute in particle size below 75 lm, which may be related to the injected powder activated carbon.

To ensure validity and reliability of data, the results were mean values calculated from five measurements. The results indicate that LOI of the raw fly ash reach 11.1%, owing to the excess of powder activated carbon injected. Cl content of the raw fly ash is remarkably high, being up to 20.43%. X-ray diffractograms of the raw fly ash and conditioned fly ash are shown in Fig. 1 . Comparing the two diffractograms, it can be found that large amounts of soluble compounds like NaCl, were removed during the conditioning process. These results are consistent with XRF analysis of raw fly ash and conditioned fly ash. High amount of NaCl which bring on the increasing of electrolyte concentration in the slurry, which will affect zeta potential, the electrical double-layer interaction between bubbles and particles as well as flotation performance (Harvey et al., 2002) . The effect of NaCl salt on floatability of carbon constituent needs further study in detail. The weight loss reached about 64% due to solubilization of chloride and at the same time, carbon constituents were concentrated in solid phase during the conditioning process, the two results caused LOI of the conditioned fly ash to increase to 31.6%. The change of weight loss and LOI may also have noteworthy effect on the subsequent flotation. Fig. 2 shows the impact of slurry concentration on carbon removal and LOI in the tailings. It can be seen that with increase of slurry concentration, the carbon removal increased and LOI in the tailings decreased when the slurry concentration was lower than 0.05 kg/l. But there is no significant change of flotation performance if the slurry concentration was beyond 0.05 kg/l. Therefore, 0.05 kg/l was determined as the slurry concentration, taking the flotation performance and water conservation into consideration. It can be seen that water requirement of flotation is equivalent to water washing pre-treatment for fly ash (Liu et al., 2009 ). Fig. 3 represents the variations of carbon removal and LOI in the tailings in response to the kerosene dosage. The result indicates Raw fly ash that the flotation response was poor at lower kerosene dosage, hence the carbon removal were very low. With increasing of kerosene dosage from 3 kg/t to 12 kg/t, carbon removal indicated an increase and LOI in the tailings decreased. However, differences in the carbon removal and LOI in the tailings were not observed when the kerosene dosage exceeded 12 kg/t. Accordingly, the optimal kerosene dosage was 12 kg/t. The collector amount is high compared with the coal fly ash and MSW incinerator fly ash (Eisele and Kawatra, 2002; Huang et al., 2003b) , there are two reasons for this result, one is that the high-carbon ash required a significantly higher collector and frother dosage than did the low-carbon ash, the other one is related with the extended surface area, microporous structure and high adsorption capacity of the activated carbon particles that soaks up much of the reagents.",

This trend is similar to the observations reported by Hacifazlioglu and Sutcu (2007) .The reason is that there was turbulence through the column axial and the froth balanced was disturbed at excessive air flow rate. On the other hand, when the air flow rate was below 0.06 m 3 /h, the froth layer did not reach the required thickness. Therefore, the optimum air flow rate was 0.06 m 3 /h.",

There is a high carbon removal compared with the removal of unburned carbon from MSW incinerator fly ash (Huang et al., 2003b) . Since the surfaces of the unburned carbon particles are commonly oxidized, which tend to reduce their natural hydrophobicity. After weathering of MSWI fly ash, more oxygen-containing functional groups on the unburned carbon surface easily came into being and accordingly made them more difficult to remove by froth flotation (Huang et al., 2003b) . In addition, powder activated carbon in HSWI fly ash is naturally hydrophobic due to their hydrocarbon nature and this hydrophobicity increases with an increase in carbon content.",

The total PCDD/Fs in the raw fly ash after flotation was decreased from 78.8 ng/g to 16.7 ng/g in the tailings. We extrapolated that the reason is the PCDD/Fs are hydrophobe and easily captured by kerosene and carried upward by gas bubbles during flotation process. In addition, PCDD/Fs may also be removed following to powder activated carbon because PCDD/Fs have a considerable tendency to adsorb on the surface of porous activated carbon. The TEQ of the raw fly ash was decreased from 5.61 ng-TEQ/g to 1.47 ng-TEQ/g in the tailings, which is less than 3 ng-TEQ/g. In general, the ratios of PCDD/Fs dissolved in the aqueous phase are much lower than those in the froth and residue, because the PCDD/Fs are strongly hydrophobic. Therefore, the PCDD/Fs were enriched into froth products. These results indicate that the flotation process can be successfully applied to reduce substantially the amount of carbon constituents and the PCDD/Fs in HSWI fly ash.",

            "text": "In China, 3 ng-TEQ/g in fly ash has been designated as a PCDD/Fs content standard for entering the solid waste landfill for landfill disposal (GB16889-2008). Generally, HSWI fly ash needs to be detoxified by treatment prior to landfill. By employing column flotation, PCDD/Fs and carbon constituents will be enriched and separated from HSWI fly ash, at the same time chloride will be washed out. After separation, the froth product could be subject to further treatment such as recirculation in the combustion chamber of incinerator, which can serve a dual purpose: almost complete destruction of the toxic organics pollution such as PCDD/Fs and energy recycling by recovery of combustible part (Samwel et al., 2011) . The volume and toxicity of the tailings would be decreased greatly, therefore, the tailings could be directly landfill disposed. Additionally, the flotation column is simple and easy to operate, requires only electricity, cheap and commercially available reagents and eventually water, which would greatly reduce the operating costs in an industrial situation. Among them, the total energy consumption of the flotation column system is below 4 kW/ton of fly ash, and the water consumption can be reduced by recycling some of waste water (Altun et al., 2009 ). On the contrary, melting technology involves extensive equipment and high energy input. Cementation of HSWI fly ash need above 40% of cement and 20-30% of water added unless dechlorinating . Therefore, the technological and economic advantages of floatation are over the conventional methods such as melting and cementation.",

LOI of the fly ash rapidly increase because of solubilization of large amounts of NaCl by conditioning during the slurry preparation process. The optimum flotation conditions were found as follows: slurry concentration 0.05 kg/l, kerosene dosage 12 kg/t, frother dosage 3 kg/t, air flow rate 0.06 m 3 /h. Under these conditions, a froth product with 92.7% carbon constituents' removal and a tailings product with less than 5% of LOI carbon were obtained. After flotation, the froth product is enriched with the PCDD/Fs and has calorific values of 12.5 MJ/kg, which make it suitable for recirculation as fuel of the incinerator and realization the decomposition of PCDD/Fs. At the same time, the TEQ of PCDD/Fs in remaining fly ash could be decreased to lower than the standard of landfill site of municipal solid waste (3 ng-TEQ/g). It was confirmed that applying flotation process can simultaneously remove carbon constituents and PCDD/Fs from HSWI fly ash. Moreover, flotation technology has relatively low operating costs, which make it be one of the most promising alternatives for the treatment of HSWI fly ash.",
