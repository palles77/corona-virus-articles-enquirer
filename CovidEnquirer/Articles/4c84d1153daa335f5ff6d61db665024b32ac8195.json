Recently, a report shows that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 shared the same functional host-cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). 7 Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptors in 10-20 fold higher affinity than SARS-CoV binds to the same receptors. 7 Another report shows SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2. 8 Since ACE2 receptors on lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine are dominant, lung alveolar epithelial cells or enterocytes of the small intestine may be an important susceptibility factor for human. 9 According to World Health Organization interim guidance on January 12, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 infection is classified as asymptomatic case, mild and severe cases of pneumonia, and critical cases of pneumonia (ARDS, sepsis, septic shock). Severe cases of pneumonia are defined as patients with respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min, severe respiratory distress, or SpO 2 < 90% on room air. 10 Asymptomatic case has been reported in China and Germany. 11, 12 Huang et al 3 first reported 41 cases of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in which most patients had a history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market.

The antibiotics used generally covered mild pathogens and some atypical pathogens; when secondary bacterial infection occurred, medication was administered according to the results of bacterial culture and drug sensitivity. The antibiotics used were moxifloxacin, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and tigecycline or linezolid against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, as well as antifungal drugs. Six patients significantly increased in IL6 were also treated with methylprednisolone. Three patients used non-invasive ventilator mechanical ventilation. Two patients used an invasive ventilator to assist ventilation. The ventilator adopted P-SIMV mode, the inhaled oxygen concentration was 35-100%, and the positive end-expiratory pressure was 6-12 cm H 2 O. No patients were treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Moreover, 7.3% patients were diagnosed ARDS, 7.3% patients were diagnosed acute cardiac injury (troponin I>28 pg/mL) and 4.4% patients were diagnosed fungal infections or shock (Table 1) .",

First, only 69 cases were included. However, this report is the first multicenter study of SARS-CoV-2 infection without comorbidities and 14,117 normal controls were analyzed. Through this report, a larger multicenter cohort study can be introduced in the future. Second, among the 69 cases, most patients are still hospitalized at the time of manuscript submission. Therefore, it is difficult to assess all risk factors for poor outcome. Third, the assay of IgG and IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in serum is not available yet. Fourth, the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia of 2019 in Wuhan and SARS-CoV pneumonia of 2003 in Beijing should be compared and studied. 20 Fifth, the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infecting the lungs and intestines through the ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2 or the acquired immunodeficiency (CD4 cells below 200 cells/mm 3 ) associated with COVID-19 (the severe or critical cases) seen in some patients directly or indirectly caused by SARS-CoV-2 is not understood, and further research and observation are needed.",
