The environment surrounding an outbreak is unique in public health, and outbreaks are frequently marked by uncertainty, confusion and a sense of urgency. Good communication at this time, generally through the media, is essential, but examples unfortunately abound of communication failures that have delayed outbreak control, undermined public trust and compliance, and unnecessarily prolonged economic, social and political turmoil. With this paper we hope to disseminate the idea that communication expertise has become as essential to outbreak control as epidemiological training and laboratory analysis. The paper presents the best practices for communicating with the public and discusses future aspects of communicating through the mass media during an outbreak.",

Globalisation and rapidly expanding and increasingly concentrated populations of humans and livestock are driving the emergence of virulent zoonotic pathogens that may be responsible for fatal disease in humans and animals. Because there is no way to predict when or where the next important zoonotic pathogen will emerge, or what its ultimate importance might be, investigation at the first sign of emergence of a new zoonotic disease is particularly important [1] . Such investigation may be described in terms of a discovery-to-control continuum: from recognition of a new disease in a new setting to the various efforts to controlling it, one of these being communication with the public via the media [2] .",

            "text": "Most public health campaigns strive for lasting behaviour change and a sustained public health impact. However, lasting behaviour change is a result of decisions made at the individual level. To facilitate voluntary behaviour change a campaign must appeal to the values and cost-benefit evaluation of each audience group targeted, emphasising near-term salient benefits rather than long-term, abstract, collective benefits. Likewise, veterinary public health messages must be customised in such a way that they are interesting, relevant and captivating to their audience. Messages should be clear, easy to understand and easy to act on. Unless it is easy for people to remember how, when and what to do it is unlikely that a veterinary public health communication campaign will be successful. Social marketing techniques applied to emerging zoonosis communication campaigns have been shown to be effective in crafting health messages that 'speak' to target audiences [6] . Successful communication campaigns are based on systematic planning efforts and on objectives that are attainable, measurable, clear and time-bound. Successful campaigns develop and deliver health messages that are tailored to specific target audiences. Disseminating generic veterinary public health messages widely and increasing knowledge about certain emerging zoonoses issues and healthy behaviours have been shown to be less effective than more targeted efforts. Audience-centred health communication efforts with a consumer perspective are much more effective in motivating target audiences to change their behaviour. This requires designing and delivering messages that are adapted to the needs, perceptions, preferences and situations of the intended audiences rather than the needs and goals of the message designers or institutions. Communicators in veterinary public health practice therefore need to know as much as possible about their target audience(s) in order to stimulate voluntary behaviour change [7] .",

Something is the treatment of tomorrow based on early studies; but sorry, it was shown not to work in larger studies or had unexpected side effects. Certainly there is much argument about the 'hyping' of H5N1 or any emerging zoonotic disease that has the potential to cause much loss of human life and gives considerable concern to scientists, but has not yet caused a large outbreak of human disease. Unfortunately, even when there is much information about the epidemiology of a microbe, predictions can never be 100% accurate and the accuracy will obviously decrease for organisms where information is sparse. This is not a problem only with H5N1; it is universal for emerging zoonotic diseases in general. Because they are new diseases, or old diseases in a state of flux because of the acquisition of novel virulence factors or antimicrobial resistance genes, knowledge about their epidemiology and ecology is minimal. Accurate predictions are difficult or impossible to make and rely on historical events that parallel the disease as closely as possible [11] . A drawback of predictions in the mainstream media is that they have led to some mistrust on the part of the public. It can be difficult to balance the needs of journalists and the media with the interests of public health.",
