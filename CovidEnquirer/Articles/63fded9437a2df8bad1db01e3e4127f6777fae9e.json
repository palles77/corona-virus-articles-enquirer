This is the first serological evidence of a specific coronavirus infection in mink. The putative mink coronavirus (MCV) seems to be widespread in the Danish mink population with a prevalence approaching 100%. Analysis by immunoblotting has shown that MCV is closely related to TGEV by the spike (S), matrix (M) and nucleoprotein (N) polypeptides. Furthermore, antibodies to MCV also cross-reacted with N and M polypeptides of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). Thus MCV may occupy an intermediate position between the TGEV group of coronaviruses and PEDV. The possibility that MCV may be associated with syndromes of acute enteritis in preweaning mink is discussed.",

A fourth polypeptide (14-15K) is revealed by antiserum to TGEV only. In contrast, FIPV antiserum reacts primarily with N and M of TGEV. Antiserum against PEDV reacts weakly with S and N of TGEV. A similar pattern was found when using CCV instead of TGEV as antigen (Fig. 2) except that staining of the S protein was only evident with CCV antiserum. In parallel experiments weak staining of the S protein of CCV has been observed with TGEV, PRCV and MCV antisera (not shown). Antiserum against PEDV reacts with S, M (28K) and N (55K) of PEDV whereas antisera against TGEV, PRCV, CCV and FIPV barely reacts with N of PEDV (Fig. 3 ) . Mink antiserum occupies an intermediate position in that there is a distinct reaction with both M and N of PEDV. By cross-neutralization TGEV, PRCV, CCV, FIPV and FECV were found to be very similar, all being neutralized by antisera to TGEV, PRCV and CCV (Table 2) . On the other hand antisera to FIPV, PEDV and MCV did not neutralize any of the viruses. In particular, antiserum to FIPV did not neutralize the strains of FIPV and FECV applied in this study. Neutralization of PEDV was not attempted, due to the extreme dependance of replication on trypsin.",

These results indicate that one or more coronaviruses related to TGEV are widespread in the Danish mink population and that such viruses have been present at least since 1981. The high prevalence of seropositive animals over several years points towards an enzootic coronavirus infection in balance with its host population. At present, it is unknown whether this coronavirus infection causes any disease but if so, it may be expected that the virus would manifest itself primarily in young animals either as a consequence of waning maternal antibodies or inadequate lactogenic immunity.",

Epizootic catarrhal gastroenteritis (ECG) (Larsen and Gorham 1975 ) occurs primarily in mink four months and older exhibiting a mucoid diarrhea over 2-6 days. Coronavirus-like particles have recently been identified by negative contrast electron microscopy in feces of animals with ECG (Gorham et al., 1990) . A similar observation has been made by one of us (Bloch, unpublished results), who found coronavirus-like particles in stool samples from neonatal mink kits. These mink kits originated from farms with a high neonatal mortality. The mink kits were suffering from diarrhea, referred to by farmers as \"wet mink kits\". The epizootiology of this syndrom is still unclear (Henriksen 1989 ) . FIP-like symptoms (pyogranulomas, vasculitis and immune-complex disease ) have not been described in mink except for ADV-associated immune-complex disease (Porter et al., 1980) but such symptoms should be kept in mind when looking for possible effects of coronavirus infection.",

However, none of the mink sera neutralized any of these viruses, indicating that the antigenic domains responsible for neutralization in the spike (S) protein of TGEV and CCV are probably absent from MCV. In this respect MCV may resemble field strains of FIPV/ FECV as it has been found that feline field sera having IFAT and PLA titres of 20 480 or higher against TGEV generally do not neutralize TGEV or the laboratory strains of FIPV and FECV used in this study (Have, unpublished data) .
