Frequency and repetitiveness breed familiarity, which increases our confidence level because we know more or less what to expect and can prepare accordingly. However, if you travel frequently you know that things may not always stay the same. Economic, political, and geo-political events may affect travel in and out of the country as well as travel and business dealings within it. New security procedures may be in place for foreign arrivals and/or new attitudes exhibited toward foreign travelers-such as heightened suspicion. The preparation work you did on reviewing the latest intelligence and news about the country will be very helpful at this point. As your plane is landing, review on your notepad, tablet, or even smartphone your notes so you will be ready for what comes next.",

The primary danger is that cybercriminals will be able to access confidential, sensitive information that could be of value to them, be that a laptop containing personal information that could be exploited by identity thieves, sensitive company data, a vector into your corporate network, or usernames and passwords that could lead to corporate espionage. Even a corporate address book will have contact details of your employees, customers, and partners that could be exploited in a spear-phishing or targeted malware attack. 3 \" His words are a reminder of what is truly at stake in our digital world and what has value in our digital economy as we carry sensitive data with us. Taxis are only one way of getting around. Buses, trains, tuk-tuks, canal boats, and more offer options to get from one place to another as well as potential venues for losing our devices and data.",

Sometimes it is a choice we make-for example, using Foursquare to check into a place using our smartphone's GPS to gather points and/or other online perks or directly posting our location and actions to Facebook. Other times, our whereabouts is discreetly contained in the metadata of items we post online-like the geo-tag of a photograph taken with our smartphone. Then there are those incidents where we had no control over who knows where we are. That kind of tracking may be for research purposes. For example, Chinese Internet giant Baidu tracked the travel rush during the Spring Festival or Chinese New Year holiday through its mapping service. This led to concerns from some users that their privacy has been invaded. 16 Another positive use of tracking is with certain travel assistance and personal security apps.

This app underpins the duty of care employers owe employees. Both of these apps, as well as others, rely on employees, who may have their own reasons for turning devices off at certain times and some venues, to activate and use them correctly so they can track their whereabouts.

In 2009, \"CBS News reported that the hotline setup in Mexico City to deal with extortion cases had received 44,000 calls since December. The hotline statistics recorded were 22,851 extortion attempts avoided, 3415 telephone numbers identified as being tied to extortionists, and 1627 people who paid off the virtual kidnappers.\" 23 Even though the kidnapping may not be real, the tactic exploits real fears, especially of those close to the alleged victim. 24 Three best practices in terms of this security risk are: 2.
