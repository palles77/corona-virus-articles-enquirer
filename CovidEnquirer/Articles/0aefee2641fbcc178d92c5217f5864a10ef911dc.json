It argues that this focus on responsibilities rather than requirements will be more effective, particularly in initial engagement efforts. The work of several international scientific organizations to employ this framing in their education and outreach activities is presented to illustrate the advantages of such an approach. The paper also includes a case study of a controversy over dual use research with highly pathogenic avian influenza to illustrate the power of framing in policy debates.",

Beyond governments, a wide and varied array of nongovernmental stakeholders are essential elements of a successful prevention strategy, including industry, the public health community, the law enforcement and security communities, and so on. The web's effectiveness, however, depends on engaging the active support of stakeholders for policies and actions where their contributions are most relevant.

            "text": "Mobilizing the scientific community in support of biological nonproliferation and disarmament faces a number of challenges. One is the scope of research about which policy makers should be concerned. In 2003, a report from the U.S. National Academy of Sciences coined the phrase \"dual use dilemma\" to describe the risk that research intended for benign purposes could also be misused to develop biological weapons or for bioterrorism (NRC, 2004) . 3 The members of the committee that produced the Fink report, named for the committee's chair, Gerald Fink of MIT, could not have anticipated that \"dual use research\" would become the standard term for a set of the security issues raised by modern biotechnology. But although in common use, it remains controversial. Critics argue in particular that the concept is too broad to be useful and could lead to policies that unnecessarily hamper important research. In 2007, when the U.S. National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) proposed a framework for oversight of dual use research, the Board argued that Because arguably most life sciences research has some potential for dual use, the NSABB strove to delineate a threshold that would identify that subset of life sciences research with the highest potential for yielding knowledge, products, or technology that could be misapplied to threaten public health or other aspects of national security. This subset of research is referred to herein as \"dual use research of concern\" (NSABB, 2007: 16).",

The committee argued that the potential risks extended well beyond advances in microbiology, 5 but policy in the United States and overseas has continued to concentrate on this field of life sciences research. 6 This reflects the history of past biological weapons programmes that weaponized human, plants, and animal disease causing agents, and the international norm embodied by the BWC is thus traditionally described as preventing \"the use of disease as a weapon.\" 7 ; But it also affects how ongoing policy debates and efforts to engage scientists are framed.",

            "text": "\"Framing\" refers to a set of sometimes overlapping concepts and theoretical perspectives, developed in a number of social science fields, which provide insights into how individuals, groups, and societies perceive, organize, and communicate about reality. \"Framing effects refer to behavioral or attitudinal outcomes that are not due to differences in what is being communicated, but rather to variations in how a given piece of information is being presented (or framed) in public discourse\" (Scheufele and Iyengar, 2014: 1) . \"Competing interests frame issues in ways that strategically advantage their political positions, emphasizing certain aspects of an issue over other considerations, influencing estimations of the causes, consequences, and solutions to a policy problem\" (Nisbet and Lewenstein, 2002: 5) . Efforts to create a compelling frame that defines an issue in policy debates over emerging technologies are thus often a key feature of the strategies used by different groups. One can think of examples such as \"Frankenfoods\" in the battles over genetically modified organisms in agriculture or the current competing frames of \"autonomous weapons systems\" versus \"killer robots.\" Studies of communication provide insights into how to design and convey information and messages to enhance the chances of understanding and acceptance by the recipients, including for emerging technologies (Nisbet & Lewenstein, 2002; Scheufele & Lewenstein, 2005) . The understanding and application of insights about framing is central to the emerging \"science of science communication\" (Jameison, Kahan, & Scheufele, 2017) . The next section offers an example of how what I call \"competing catastrophes\" came to frame the controversy over research with pathogens with pandemic potential. This is followed by an example of how some international scientific organizations have framed scientists' engagement in biosecurity issues as part of the \"responsible conduct of research\" or the larger \"social responsibility of science.\" 3 This is different from the traditional concept of \"dual use\" in security, which refers largely to technology and products that, although intended for commercial purposes, may have military applications. There are traditional dual use commercial items in biotechnology, such fermenters, that may be subject to controls, and the ready availability of these items via the internet is a subject of proliferation concern (see, for example, Zilinskas, 2015) . Controls may also extend to \"intangible technology,\" which comes closest to the Fink Committee's concept of \"dual use.\" According to the U.S. State Department, this \"includes, but is not limited to, instructions (written or recorded), working knowledge, design drawings, models, operational manuals, skills training, and parts catalogues\" (https://www.state.gov/ strategictrade/practices/c43180.htm). 4 The current U.S. government definition of DURC is \"life sciences research that, based on current understanding, can be reasonably anticipated to provide knowledge, information, products, or technologies that could be directly misapplied to pose a significant threat with broad potential consequences to public health and safety, agricultural crops and other plants, animals, the environment, materiel, or national security\" (U.S. Government, 2012: 1-2). 5 \"The seven areas of concern listed here only address potential microbial threats. Of course, modern biological research is much broader, encompassing all of the health sciences, agriculture, and veterinary science. It also includes diverse industries such as those that manufacture pharmaceuticals, cosmetics (e.g., Botox), and soft drinks (e.g., citric acid production). Moreover, all of these areas are changing rapidly. The great diversity as well as the pace of change makes it imprudent to project the potential both for good and ill too broadly and too far into the future. Therefore, the Committee has initially limited its concerns to cover those possibilities that represent a plausible danger and has tried to avoid improbable scenarios. Over time, however, the Committee believes that it will be necessary not only to expand the experiments of concern to cover a significantly wider range of potential threats to humans, animals or crops but also to include oversight of work conducted for or performed within the private sector as well as non-NIH [National Institutes of Health] government facilities and sponsored activities that are not already voluntarily complying with the Guidelines [recommended in the report]\" (NRC, 2004: 114) . 6 The seven types of experiments covered by the 2012 U.S. policy for DURC, are essentially the same as those in the Fink report. 7 For a history of past weapons programmes, see Wheelis et al. (2006) . More recently advances in fields such as neuroscience, in genome editing tools such as gene drives, and the growth of a global \"bioeconomy\" that relies on biotechnology-based production methods are expanding the range of security concerns (see, for example, Dando (2015) , National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, & Medicine (2016a), and Royal Society (2015)). These new issues are not yet widely reflected in policy.",

Competing catastrophes and research with pathogens with pandemic potential Fig. 1 illustrates a widely cited portrayal of the spectrum of sources of biological risks, from the specter of naturally occurring pandemics at one extreme to biological warfare by states or terrorists at the other. Both ends represent low probability, but high consequence events. The original purpose of the graphic was to convey a range of risks, and it is often used to encourage an audience to think about how policies to address one set of risks could help ameliorate others. The current emphasis on \"health security,\" in which increasing global capacity to prevent and combat infectious disease outbreaks provides important capabilities that could be deployed in the event of a deliberately caused disease outbreak is a good example. The Global Health Security Agenda, launched in 2014, acknowledges the essential need for a multilateral and multi-sectoral approach to strengthen both global and national capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats whether naturally occurring, deliberate, or accidental. Once established, the capacity would mitigate the devastating effects of Ebola, MERS, other highly pathogenic infectious diseases, and bioterrorism events.\" 8 The figure can also be used to present a more zero-sum view of the risks, however. Could efforts to prevent one catastrophe increase the risks of another? For example, could policies to limit some areas of dual use research out of security concerns hamper vital efforts to prevent or respond to potential pandemics? \"Nature is the best bioterrorist\" is a common riposte to anyone arguing for the need to pay attention to risks from dual use research or sometimes even biological weapons or bioterrorism. Millions of casualties each year from naturally occurring infectious diseases offer a graphic contrast to the lack of any bioterrorist incidents since the anthrax letter attacks of 2001, which are sometimes presented as a \"biocrime.\" And it should be noted that the continuing lack of consensus within the security community about the nature, likelihood, and severity of the risks from state and non-state actors compounds the problem of crafting and presenting a compelling alternative frame. 9 An example of this zero-sum competing catastrophes argument is illustrated by the ongoing controversy over research with pathogens with the potential to cause pandemics.",

            "text": "However, reviewers flagged the manuscripts as raising biosecurity concerns because the experiments could also provide knowledge to those who would use the results to cause deliberate harm. The journals sought the advice of the NSABB, which had been consulted about several potentially problematic publications since its creation in 2004. 11 When the NSABB initially recommended against publication unless certain details were omitted from the methods section in December 2011, a storm of controversy erupted. One of the key features of the debate over the merits of the research was that there were vocal scientists on both sides of the argument; this was not simply the science community aligned against the government as was more typical of such publication controversies in the past. 12 The initial phases of the controversy played out over the next few months. In January 2012, a group of influenza researchers announced a 2-month moratorium on H5N1 research that could produce new highly pathogenic, highly transmissible strains to allow time for an international debate on the issues (Enserink, 2012) . In February the World Health Organization (WHO) brought together a small group of public health and influenza experts. WHO was a natural international convener because it oversees a global network of collaborating research centers on influenza as well as the international process to identify the candidates for annual flu vaccines. In addition, national limits on influenza research in the name of security could disrupt the painstakingly negotiated Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework (PIP) adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2011. 13 But critics of the research argued that this also gave WHO a major stake in the outcome of the controversy, which raised questions about its capacity to be a neutral forum. The group's recommendation to publish the manuscripts in full once concerns about biosecurity and appropriate communication of the results were addressed confirmed the expectations of both advocates and critics. Editorials in major newspapers such as one in the New York Times headlined \"An Engineered Doomsday\" reflected the intensity of the public controversy (New York Times, 2012). The NSABB met again in late March and, based on further discussion, the presentation of additional information by the authors and other experts, and the statement by NIH that it did not have a legal basis to demand redaction, the Board voted (unanimously for one paper and by a majority vote for the other) to recommend publication in full of revised versions of the manuscripts. Both papers were published soon thereafter. In addition, on March 29 the U.S. government released a new Policy for Oversight of Life Sciences Dual Use Research of Concern. The policy set out an agreement among all 15 federal agencies supporting life sciences research to establish regular reviews of their portfolios for work involving 15 specific agents and toxins and 7 categories of experiments. As part of the review, the agency would \"Assess the risks and benefits of such projects, including how research methodologies may generate risks and/or whether open access to the knowledge, information, products, or technologies generates risk [and] based on the risk assessment, in collaboration with the institution or researcher, develop a risk mitigation plan to apply any necessary and appropriate risk mitigation measures\" (U.S. Government, 2012: 3) . A subsequent policy, to provide guidelines for the responsibilities of researchperforming institutions receiving federal funds for DURC research, took effect in September 2014 (U.S. Government, 2014) .",

            "text": "In addition to the engagement of the WHO, the controversy had other international dimensions. Because one of the researchers, Ron Fouchier, was based in the Netherlands, the Dutch government also became involved. It decided that, under European Union regulations aimed at preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), submitting the paper to Science constituted an \"export\" and Professor Fouchier should have applied for a license in advance. Under protest, Fouchier applied for a license, which was approved, but he also appealed the ruling. A Dutch court upheld the ruling in 2013, and the Dutch government continues to view exports controls, along with an extensive programme of outreach to the research community, as the appropriate method for addressing concerns about publication of dual use research (Enserink, 2013) . 14 After the United States government issued its DURC policy and the two research papers were published, the controversy continued to simmer at a lower level as new research with highly pathogenic avian influenza periodically raised concerns. In Europe, for example, the Fouchier case raised serious questions at the national and regional level about whether the European Union might decide that its measures against weapons of mass destruction (WMD) should apply to all member states and become engaged in more active oversight. The European scientific community expressed widely different views to the European Commission in the second half of 2013 about the relative risks and benefits of such research. The European Society for Virology wrote to the head of the European Commission (EC) in October to raise concerns about the damage to important research that would result if it became subject to export controls. In December, another group of scientists wrote an opposing letter through the Foundation for Vaccine Research to highlight what it saw as the safety and security risks associated with the research (NASEM, 2016b: 54-55). (Although the controversy began over security concerns, the potential biosafety risks of an accidental release from a laboratory soon became equally important in the debates.) The divisions within the scientific community led the EC and its chief scientific advisor to request a study from the European Academies Scientific Advisory Council (EASAC) in 2014 in search of common ground (EASAC, 2015) . Leaders of both camps were represented on the committee for the consensus study, giving its recommendations particular weight.",

The Council's Opinion made a series of recommendations, ranging from proposals for individual researchers and the scientific community to proposals for funding bodies, legislators, and international initiatives (German Ethics Council, 2014: 179) . At present, a series of voluntary measures are being implemented under the leadership of the German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina and the German Research Foundation, but the potential for future legislative action remains as an incentive for the German scientific community to take the issues seriously. 15 The debates continued into 2014 and a series of significant biosafety lapses at U.S. government laboratories spurred different groups of scientists to organize to provide a collective expression of their views about the implications for what had now become 13 The PIP's goals are to maintain \"a dynamic, equitable balance between sharing influenza viruses that have pandemic potential, and distributing the benefits that result\" (http://www.who.int/influenza/pip/WHO_PIP_brochure.pdf?ua=1). Further information may be found at http://www.who.int/influenza/pip/en/; accessed January 27, 2018. 14 The Dutch government also asked the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW) to review and update the code of conduct for biosecurity it had known as \"gain-of-function\" (GOF) research. 16 One group, called the Cambridge Working Group after its founding meeting at Harvard University, issued a consensus statement in July focused solely on biosafety concerns that recommended For any experiment, the expected net benefits should outweigh the risks. Experiments involving the creation of potential pandemic pathogens should be curtailed until there has been a quantitative, objective and credible assessment of the risks, potential benefits, and opportunities for risk mitigation, as well as comparison against safer experimental approaches. A modern version of the Asilomar process, which engaged scientists in proposing rules to manage research on recombinant DNA, could be a starting point to identify the best approaches to achieve the global public health goals of defeating pandemic disease and assuring the highest level of safety. Whenever possible, safer approaches should be pursued in preference to any approach that risks an accidental pandemic (Cambridge Working Group, 2014).",

The National Institutes of Health, which funded almost all the research subject to the process and oversaw the NSABB, would commission the formal assessment of the potential risks and benefits; the assessment would be carried out by private contractors. The NSABB also commissioned an analysis of the ethical issues associated with GOF research from bioethicist Michael Selgelid. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) were requested to \"provide a forum for broad public debate, which will inform the NSABB's deliberations and the development of USG [sic] policy on GOF research\" (NRC, 2015: 3). The forum would consist of two public conferences with international participation. \"The first conference would offer the opportunity for input from a wide range of stakeholders about both general principles that should guide the assessments of benefits and risks and what specific issues should be considered, while the second would provide an opportunity for comments on the NSABB's draft policy recommendations once the assessments were completed (NRC, 2015: 3).",

            "text": "The first public symposium by the National Academies was held in December 2014, but after that the process slowed down (NRC, 2015) . The NSABB produced its framework to guide the formal risk and benefit assessments in May 2015 (NSABB, 2015a), which was carried out by Gryphon Scientific. The draft risk and benefit assessments (Gryphon Scientific, 2015) , 18 along with the Selgelid paper 16 As the NSABB noted, \"Recently, the phrase \"gain-of-function research\" has become synonymous with certain studies that enhance the ability of pathogens to cause disease. However, gain-of-function studies, as well as loss-of-function studies, are common in molecular microbiology and are essential to understanding molecular pathogenesis of infectious diseases. Changes to the genome of an organism, whether naturally occurring or directed through experimental manipulations in the laboratory, can result in altered phenotypes, as biological functions are lost or gained. Investigators routinely conduct loss-and gain-of-function experiments to understand the complex nature of host-pathogen interactions that underlie transmission, infection, and pathogenesis\" (NSABB, 2016: 5) . Employing the more general term also had the effect of engaging a wider swath of the virology community who now became concerned that proposals to limit research would expand beyond the narrow focus on highly pathogenic avian influenza. 17 The pause applied only to certain experiments within a broader grant or contract, and an appeals process allowed that \"an exception from the funding pause may be granted by the head of the federal funding department or agency if that official determines in writing that the research is urgently necessary to protect public health or national security\" (White House, 2014b: 5). NIH initially identified 18 experiments as likely to be subject to the pause; the number eventually rose to 21, of which 10 received exemptions. 18 The Gryphon Scientific draft and final reports, along with substantial additional material, are available at http://www.gryphonscientific.com/gain-of-function/ (Selgelid, 2015) and the NSABB's draft recommendations (NSABB, 2015b), were released in December 2015 and discussed at an NSABB meeting in January 2016. 19 The second Academies symposium was held in March (NASEM, 2016b) and the final NSABB recommendations were produced in May 2016 and provided to the interagency process (NSABB, 2016) . The NSABB recommended a process that put substantial emphasis on reviews and decisions early in the life cycle of research, and, like the broader U.S. policy for DURC, allowed for monitoring and adjustments to any risk mitigation plans if unexpected results emerged. One of the NSABB's findings was \"There are life sciences research studies, including possibly some GOF research of concern, that should not be conducted because the potential risks associated with the study are not justified by the potential benefits\" (NSABB, 2016: 2) . By this point, the deliberative process had stretched toward two years. Once the interagency process began, there were no further public discussions by the government. On January 17, 2017, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy released its Recommended Policy Guidance for Departmental Development of Review Mechanisms for Potential Pandemic Pathogen Care and Oversight. \"The Guidance recommends consistent and appropriate Federal agency review and reporting processes for the oversight of Federally funded research that is anticipated to create, transfer, or use enhanced potential pandemic pathogens (PPP)\" (White House, 2017: 1). Federal agencies that adopted a review mechanism consistent with the recommendations in the Guidance would fulfill the necessary conditions to end the funding pause. On December 19, 2017, more than three years after the deliberative process began, the Department of Health and Human Services announced its review mechanism and later that day NIH announced that the funding pause was lifted (NIH, 2017) . A few of the headlines that followed the announcement -\"NIH lifts 3-year ban on funding risky virus studies\" in Science (Kaiser, 2017) or \"NIH Lifts Ban On Research That Could Make Deadly Viruses Even Worse\" on National Public Radio (Greenfieldboyce, 2017 )suggest the controversy over this and other forms of dual use research is far from over.",

The irony is that this controversy among some scientists is accompanied by a widespread lack of awareness among most life sciences researchers. Even a longrunning dispute like the gain-of-function debates, or the imposition of polices such as the U.S. review procedures for DURC has not led to a significant increase in awareness in the United States (NASEM, 2017a) and the situation seems to be true in other parts of the world. 20 For those interested in making security issues an accepted feature of discussions about the implications of developments in life sciences research, a successful framing of the problem would have a number of characteristics. It would facilitate engaging many stakeholders and fit within the mandates of governments and relevant international organizations. In particular, it would enable reaching the broadest possible array of scientists in settings ranging from academia to industry to public health and beyond. At the same time, it would be compatible with engaging specialized groups of scientists working on more security-relevant activities such as research in high containment laboratories. Finally, such a framing would complement existing legal and regulatory structures and provide a basis for discussing potential changes in research practices or additional security measures.",

This is part of a wider effort to move beyond a \"check-theboxes\" mentality of adherence to regulations to active engagement in addressing risks. 23 The remarks by Ambassador \u00dcz\u00fcmc\u00fc about \"promoting a culture of responsibility\" () and the recommendations of the Federal Experts Security Advisory Panel in the United States (FESAP, 2015) are examples. Responsible Science offers a constructive alternative to the zero-sum competing catastrophes frame that supports this broader approach.",
