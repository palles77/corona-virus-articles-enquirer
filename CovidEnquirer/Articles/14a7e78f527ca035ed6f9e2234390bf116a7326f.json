This is followed by a sexual phase of development resulting in the production of potentially genetically diverse oocysts that are shed fully infective in the faeces. Oocysts may also 'hatch' before they are shed from the host, causing reinfection and exponential increases in parasite burden, leading to chronic infection, particularly in immunocompromised hosts [4] . Cryptosporidium parasites have a remarkable capacity to reproduce in the host. The rapid multiplication of the parasite in the gut cells causes tissue damage and destruction of the intestinal epithelial cells with stunting of the villi, reducing the absorptive surface of the gut, leading to malnutrition, dehydration, and diarrhoea [5] .",

Livestock, in particular young calves, are very vulnerable to cryptosporidiosis and a recent modelling study estimated the global load of Cryptosporidium parasites in livestock manure to be in the region of 3.2 \u00d7 10 23 oocysts per year, with cattle being the predominant source [10] . Therefore, improving our understanding of environmental transmission routes of zoonotic Cryptosporidium and oocyst survival is important in assessing and mitigating against disease risk and is essential for a One Health approach to tackle human and animal cryptosporidiosis. Currently, there are no effective vaccines to prevent cryptosporidiosis in humans or in livestock and there are few safe and effective therapeutic options available. Cryptosporidiosis is a disease that is well placed for a collaborative interdisciplinary approach to tackle it effectively and previous authors have advocated the benefits of adopting a One Health approach [11] . This review will discuss progress made in this area, with greater emphasis on the benefits and opportunities from tackling the disease in livestock, and look at recent advances in scientific technologies that may lead to much needed prevention and control strategies.",

Children often play an important role in tending grazing livestock in many countries and, due to their close proximity to the animals, are very likely to come into contact with Cryptosporidium parasites.

Of 199 documented outbreaks of human parasitic protozoal disease due to water contamination in the period 2004-2010, Cryptosporidium spp. accounted for the majority of outbreaks [30] . How the oocysts reach water courses is not clear, as fate and transfer of oocysts from host faecal material through the environment to water courses is not well understood. Most scientists and water industry experts consider this mainly to be due to overland flow, particularly in periods of high rainfall or around intense rainfall events [31] . The effect of climate change (which is predicted to increase winter precipitation and summer extreme precipitation events) on pathogen loading to surface waters was recently explored, but predicted to have limited effect on the risk to public health, using models for catchment pathogen loads [32] .

Whilst this is a useful library typing tool, it does not provide adequate differentiation for local or regional epidemiological questions, such as outbreak investigations. A literature review of multilocus genotyping schemes for C. parvum showed that these are usually based on single nucleotide polymorphisms or on micro/minisatellite regions [43] . In multilocus fragment typing (MLFT), repeat units within the genome (micro/minisatellites) are amplified and either sequenced or analysed for size, reflecting the length polymorphisms due to variable numbers of repeat motifs, which forms the basis for genotyping. Alleles at different loci, or markers, are combined to give a multilocus genotype.",

It would be desirable for a One Health approach to develop an integrated genotyping approach that could be used by both veterinary and public health researchers, as advocated in a recent EU Cost action ii . The markers that MLFT is based on are single copy genes and as such this approach has limitations for environmental samples where there is likely to be a low quantity of C. parvum DNA present. This presents a problem for whole-catchment approaches, where MLFT could be a useful tool in determining C. parvum transmission dynamics and innovative application of amplification technologies could be used to overcome such barriers.",

Disinfection with recommended products can help to reduce build-up of contaminated faeces on the farm, where disinfectants containing hydrogen peroxide are the most effective [22] . A recent study has also suggested that disinfection of calf pens with hydrated lime may help to reduce onset and severity of cryptosporidiosis in calves [49] .

An alternative strategy such as that currently used to vaccinate dams against other pathogens causing diarrhoeal disease (e.g., rotavirus, coronavirus, and Escherichia coli) may also work for Cryptosporidium by generating specific immunity in the dam, which is passed to the calf through the colostrum, thus helping the calf to resist the disease during these crucial early weeks of life [58] . Promising results using a passive immunity approach have been achieved through immunisation of dams with recombinant P23 and CP15 proteins to generate hyperimmune colostrum containing specific antibodies and other immune factors that can help protect neonatal calves against disease caused by Cryptosporidium infection [59] .",

With livestock farming moving towards increasingly efficient and sustainable production to minimise impact on the environment, there is much to be gained from tackling cryptosporidiosis.

The feasibility of a vaccination approach has been supported by studies showing the development of a degree of resistance to the parasite following repeated exposure [65] . In addition, sero-epidemiology studies in Scotland looked at the prevalence of antibodies against Cryptosporidium sporozoite antigens in populations before and after the introduction of enhanced filtration to remove Cryptosporidium oocysts for the water supply and found a significant reduction in seroprevalence, indicating a potential reduction in immune resilience to the Trends in Parasitology parasite [66] . Several promising candidate antigens have been identified, along with knowledge of likely protective immune responses and different vaccine delivery strategies to target mucosal immune responses, recently reviewed [60] . Of interest is the level of cross-protective immunity between C. hominis and C. parvum, as this will be an important consideration for vaccine design. A serological study was conducted in children in Bangladesh and found that although most children were infected with C. hominis, they also had cross-reactive antibodies to the C. parvum antigen Cp23 [67] . A further study looked at cross-protective immunity between the two species using an in vivo gnotobiotic pig model and showed than prior infection with C. hominis protected against a further C. hominis challenge and gave partial protection against a C. parvum challenge [68] , showing that there is a degree of cross-immunity between the two Cryptosporidium species. The gnotobiotic piglet model shows similar clinical signs of diarrhoea as seen in human infection following challenge with C. hominis and is therefore a relevant clinical model with which to test out new therapies and vaccines [69] . Neonatal cattle [27] and sheep [70] are also relevant clinical models for C. parvum in particular, to improve understanding of host-parasite interactions, to test out novel therapeutic agents, and to provide sources of Cryptosporidium oocysts for research and diagnostic purposes.",

            "text": "Recently, there has been some exciting progress on the in vitro culture of Cryptosporidium parasites using hollow-fibre technology [71] and the demonstration of the complete life cycle of C. parvum when cultured in human and mouse intestinal organoids [72, 73] . Heo et al. microinjected Cryptosporidium into the lumen of three-dimensional human-derived organoids [72] , while Wilke et al. infected monolayers of mouse-derived organoids cultured at an air-liquid interface in transwells [73] . Both culture systems support long-term growth (N20 days) and produce viable, infectious oocysts. Additionally, Wilke et al. generated transgenic parasites in vitro in organoid co-culture and used these parasites to perform a genetic cross [73] . These advances will help to reduce the numbers of animals used in research and for production of oocysts. Important advances have also been made in the genetic engineering of Cryptosporidium parasites [74] . Use of CRISPR/Cas9 in Cryptosporidium has enabled the generation of reporter strains to advance drug discovery. Manipulation of genes of interest allows us to interrogate the function of genes directly in the parasite for the first time. Further tool development, including protein tagging and conditional knockdown, will improve our understanding of the parasite biology and host pathogen interactions [74] . These new technologies are very exciting, as both host and parasite are accessible and tractable for fundamental research, and provide more relevant models for drug and vaccine discovery. Similarly, other hosts and species of Cryptosporidium may be amenable to culture and laboratory exploration in the future. This would be especially impactful for C. hominis, which lacks an in vitro system and relies on a resource intensive gnotobiotic piglet animal model. Along with increasing awareness and understanding of the impact of cryptosporidiosis in people and animals, there is a renewed impetus to tackle cryptosporidiosis. Understanding key transmission routes and main sources of infection can also help to develop mitigating strategies to prevent direct infection and to protect against indirect transmission through water, food, and the environment.",

Applying an integrated genotyping approach that may be used in both veterinary and public health would aid in source tracking and surveillance and inform epidemiology studies.
