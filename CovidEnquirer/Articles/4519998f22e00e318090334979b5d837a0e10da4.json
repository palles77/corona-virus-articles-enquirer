            "text": "Background: Acute community-acquired sinusitis is considered a bacterial complication of the common cold. Radiologic abnormalities in sinuses occur, however, in most patients with upper respiratory virus infections. Objective: Assessment of the occurrence, clinical profile, laboratory findings, and outcome of radiologically confirmed sinusitis was carried out as part of a common cold study in young adults. Methods: Clinical examinations and radiography of the paranasal sinuses were carried out on days 1, 7, and 21 in 197 patients with the common cold. The symptoms were recorded on diary cards on days 1 to 20. Ten viruses and 5 bacteria were studied as etiologic agents of common cold as reported earlier. Serum C reactive protein concentrations, erythrocyte sedimentation rates, and total white blood cell counts with differentials were determined in 40 randomized subjects on day 7. The effect of 6 days of intranasal fluticasone propionate treatment of the common cold in the prevention of sinusitis was analyzed. Results: On day 7, 39% of patients with the common cold in the placebo group (n = 98) had sinusitis, which we would prefer to call viral sinusitis. The symptoms of patients with sinusitis and those without it were not clinically distinguishable. Viral infection was detected in 81.6% of patients with sinusitis. No significantly increased levels of antibodies to bacteria were detected. Serum C reactive protein concentrations, erythrocyte sedimentation rates, and white blood cell counts were low in patients with sinusitis. All patients made a clinical recovery within 21 days without antibiotic treatment. Fluticasone propionate treatment tended to prevent paranasal sinusitis, especially in rhinovirus-positive subjects. Conclusion: Viral sinusitis frequently occurs in the early days of the common cold, but it is a self-limited illness. The sinuses should not be imaged in patients with the common cold if the signs and symptoms of illness gradually become less severe and no specific signs suggestive of bacterial sinusitis occur.

Therefore antibiotics are generally considered necessary for its medical management. 2 Bacterial sinusitis is difficult to differentiate from radiologic sinusitis, which is common in many patients during the early stage of the common cold. 3 If the signs and symptoms of the common cold last longer than for 7 to 10 days after onset of illness, the diagnosis of bacterial sinusitis should be considered. 4 In a study of intranasal fluticasone propionate (FP) in the treatment of the common cold, 5 we took paranasal sinus radiographs in 197 young adults on days 1, 7, and 21 of common cold, and the patients were followed daily for 21 days after onset of illness. The occurrence, clinical profile, laboratory findings, and outcome of radiologically confirmed sinusitis were assessed. Furthermore, it was investigated whether FP treatment prevented the development of sinusitis.",

The exclusion criteria were a history of allergic rhinitis, a history of chronic or recurrent sinusitis and lower respiratory tract disease, major nasal septal deviation, nasal polyp-osis, pregnancy, or lactation.

Of the 200 subjects included in the study, 1 was rejected because of poor compliance, and the radiographs of 2 patients were lost before interpretation. The 591 radiographs obtained were interpreted after the study period independently by 3 radiologists who were unaware of clinical patient data. The 3 radiologists agreed on the interpretation of radiographs in 60.9% of the 1182 maxillary sinuses imaged. In 35.5% of the cases, 2 of the 3 radiologists agreed, and this was chosen for the final diagnosis. In 3.6% of the cases, there was a disagreement between all 3 radiologists, and the final diagnosis was established through discussion. The findings of the maxillary sinuses were categorized as normal (1), mucosal thickening of 5 mm or less (2), mucosal thickening of more than 5 mm (3), total opacity (4), air-fluid level (5) , and cyst or polyp (6) . Subjects with maxillary sinus radiographs showing mucosal thickening of more than 5 mm, total opacity, or air-fluid level were classified as having sinusitis. 6 Because a single occipitomental view images poorly areas other than the maxillary sinuses, the results for the frontal, ethmoid, and sphenoid sinuses were combined and designated as either normal or showing an infection of the frontal, ethmoid, or sphenoid sinus.",

Antibodies to 5 bacteria (Chlamydia pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae) were studied. Nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) was taken with a disposable mucus extractor (Vygon, Ecouen, France). The catheter was advanced to a depth of 6 to 10 cm in the nasopharynx through the nostril and withdrawn while applying gentle suction with a suction device. This procedure was carried out through both nostrils and repeated 2 to 3 times. NPA was inoculated on blood and chocolate agar plates according to routine procedures for detection of bacteria present in the nasopharynx on days 1 and 7.",

Second, no patients had significantly increased levels of antibodies to S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, or M. catarrhalis, which are the most common bacteria causing bacterial sinusitis. Third, our patients with viral sinusitis had low CRP concentrations, ESRs, and WBCs, which are compatible with viral illness. In 2 previous studies, elevated CRP concentrations and ESRs have been shown in acute bacterial sinusitis. 3, 13 Fourth, the symptoms of our patients were clearly reduced within 7 to 10 days after onset of the common cold and were not markedly distinguishable from those of the common cold without sinusitis (Table II) . Although the mean duration of symptoms of illness was 10 days in our study, with the exception of 3 patients, the symptoms of our patients abated gradually, and none had specific symptoms suggestive of bacterial sinusitis, such as pain in the upper teeth or in the maxillo-facial area. 3, 7, 8 Fifth and most importantly, all our 71 (of 197) patients with sinusitis made a clinical recovery within 21 days without antibiotic treatment, in agreement with the results of Gwaltney et al. 11 For definite diagnosis of viral sinusitis, maxillary puncture should have been performed to discover the presence of secretion and viruses and the absence of bacteria in the sinus cavity. However, the ethics of maxillary puncture in patients without signs and symptoms of bacterial sinusitis can be questioned.",

            "text": "The prevention of sinusitis is important, but there are no proven methods of prevention. 2 Although not a statistically significant finding, intranasal FP tended to prevent the development of viral sinusitis in rhinovirus-positive patients when administered from the beginning of common cold. Rhinovirus is the most common etiologic agent of the common cold, causing up to 90% of cold episodes during spring and fall epidemics. 9, 15 Because the maximum benefit of FP may take days to appear, 16 the effect might have been more beneficial if the treatment period had been longer than 6 days. In addition, if we had included allergic patients and patients prone to sinusitis, the effect could have been more favorable. In these patients topical steroids may effectively prevent viral sinusitis and consequent development of bacterial sinusitis. Five trials have assessed the effect of glucocorticosteroids as an adjunct to antibiotics in the treatment of sinusitis. [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] In 4 of these studies, the subjects had chronic sinusitis, [18] [19] [20] [21] and the overall effect of glucocorticosteroids was controversial. In our subjects intranasal FP treatment had no clinically recognizable effects on the symptoms of common cold. 5 The clinically important yield of our study is that sinuses should not be imaged in patients with the common cold if the signs and symptoms of illness are gradually reducing and there are no signs of bacterial sinusitis. In addition to irradiation and the cost, unnecessary imaging of viral sinusitis may lead to unnecessary treatment. *Subjects whose radiographs showed sinusitis on day 1 are excluded. Radiologically established sinusitis was defined as mucosal thickening over 5 mm, total opacity, or air-fluid level.",
