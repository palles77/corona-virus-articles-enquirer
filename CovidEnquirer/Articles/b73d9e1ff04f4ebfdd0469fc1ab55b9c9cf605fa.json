These people include clinical care providers, nurses, doctors, pharmacist, and many others, as well as public health, management, and support staff. All are vital to the work of maintaining and improving health. There are no absolute standards of need and there is wide variation in the health workforce, even in the industrialized countries. But there are clearly needs for supplies of health personnel to meet the needs of a population and methods to train them, employ them, and retain them. Those countries with exceedingly low levels of numbers of health workers will have difficulty achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by the year 2015 and beyond. Developing adequacy in the quality and quality of the health workforce is one of the essential aspects of public health.",

The great achievements of public health of the twentieth century led to doubling of life expectancy in the industrialized countries and the emergence of important health advances even in the least developed countries. New challenges of globalization of diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus/ acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), persisting tropical diseases and other emerging communicable diseases, and disasters, terrorism, genocide and pandemics of avian influenza present great challenges in the twenty-first century. But the main causes of death are the non-communicable diseases (NCDs), where prevention has shown truly amazing positive results in cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and injuries. However, much remains to be done in the high-income as well as in middle-and low-income countries for primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention to reduce morbidity and avoidable deaths, i.e., deaths that may be prevented by risk reduction or preventive measures, such as lung cancer from cigarette smoking and exposure. The key to many of the future achievements in reducing the burden of disease lies in health promotion along with advances in the biomedical side of prevention with, for example, new vaccines to prevent or modify infectious diseases and NCDs, especially cancers. Despite improved prevention, NCDs, including mental and oral disease, are still a major public health problem in high-income countries and growing rapidly in lowand middle income countries (see Chapters 6 and 7).",

Additional costs of training and employing the professional workers needed for low-and medium-income countries will require large-scale investment by the developing countries themselves and international donor aid.

In both fee-for-service medicine and salaried health service, increases in physician supply generate increases in health expenditures. Supply and demand market forces do not adapt well to health care, because the consumer demand is to a large extent generated by provider decisions (e.g., for return visits, investigation, or hospitalization).

During the 1980s, the province experienced a marked economic downturn and zero population growth, but the supply of physicians and services per physician increased by some 20 percent. The reduced numbers of clients per physician led to an increase both in fees and in volume of services per capita so that physician incomes were sustained.

A strong national health policy can nevertheless be constructed, even in a poor country, by well-defined health programs. Community and rural health policy in China during the 1950s was based on a number of elements: development of a 3-year family doctor training program for rural service, upgrading training of village doctors to physician assistant level, and incentives to encourage work in the countryside and at a grassroots level. This program was successful in raising health standards in China beyond those that might have been expected from its economic level.

This approach has been less accepted since the 1980s; even in free market societies, it inflates the costs of health care and fails to meet needs in underserved populations or specialties. Immigration and emigration of medical personnel, or departures from active practice, are also factors in the supply and distribution of health personnel. There were also concerns during the 1980s of a possible oversupply of doctors, and medical school enrollments were limited as a policy. This approach was promoted as part of the concern for rapid increases in health care costs and partially as a result of concerns in the medical profession of excess supply bringing more competition and possibly lowering the incomes of physicians. In the 1980s, health care costs rose rapidly, associated with increasing specialization and a search for new organizational patterns of health care such as the health maintenance organizations (HMOs). There was also a growing realization that population and personal health needs depend more on prevention and health promotion than on increased supply of physicians. This led to a trend to reduce numbers of new students entering medical schools, a decrease in subspecialty training positions, and a greater reliance on immigration of doctors to the USA, Canada, and the UK. This created a growing migration of medical and nursing personnel and reliance of developed countries on importation of doctors and nurses from poorer countries, often with serious and destructive effects on poorer countries in Europe and especially in severely workforce-deficient countries in sub-Saharan Africa.",

Funding support and accreditation of educational institutions provides mechanisms for applying national or state policy for both quantity and quality of educational programs. National or provincial departments of education set guidelines and standards for funding through a university grants mechanism or commission, often based on enrollment. Standards may be set for curriculum, faculty, basic sciences, and clinical training, as part of approval for funding or through non-governmental accreditation structures organized by the medical schools themselves (see Chapter 15).

Medical training gains from an environment that promotes research and service in an academic atmosphere with its associated standards. This tradition of linking research with education and service is important in promoting quality education. Having a research climate of peer-reviewed work raises the aspirations of the institution and its faculty and sets a standard for students for their life's work. A university degree confers prestige to a profession, encourages the pursuit of peer recognition of excellence, and academic criteria for student selection, curriculum, and faculty standards.

Many medical schools teach primarily by lecture to very large classes, with limited supervised clinical experience, which reduces the chance for the student to develop patient-oriented and problem-solving skills. It also promotes a didactic approach to medicine, and minimizes the opportunity for the student to work with multidisciplinary teams, or to see medical care as part of a diverse team. Working with students of other sciences and professions in a collegial fashion helps the medical student to understand the team role of workers in the health care system.",

The decline in the number of nursing schools in the 1950s was due to closure or consolidation of individual hospital schools of nursing. North American schools for nursing education are now largely associated with university or associate degree programs in community colleges. University-based schools in the USA provide academic degree programs at the bachelor, master, and doctorate levels. Nursing education at the master and doctorate levels provides the teaching, research, and management cadres needed for a progressive health care system. In 2008, 50.0 percent of the RN workforce in the USA held a baccalaureate or graduate degree while 36.1 percent earned an associate degree and 13.9 percent a diploma in nursing. The first baccalaureate program in nursing was established at the University of Minnesota in 1909. By 1980 there were 377 and in 1995 521 bachelor's programs for RNs. Upgrading educational standards for existing professions, such as nursing or midwifery, involves consideration of the costs and effects on personnel supply as well as the desirability of raising professional standards. The advent of degree programs in nursing raised the level of prestige, leadership, research, teaching, and service of the profession. The transition from hospital apprenticeship training to university-based education (i.e., \"academization\") was opposed by traditional interests such as hospital management and the medical profession, but this resistance subsided with the demonstration of greater capacity in the nursing profession to take responsibility and incorporate rapid scientific and technological advances. Table 14 .7 shows a decrease in diploma-level training and increases in associate and bachelors (or higher) in the USA. The trend towards increasing nursing graduates at the baccalaureate level continues to the present time, with most other RNs being trained in 2-year community college programs. In recent years there has been an increasing flow of people entering the profession in their late twenties and early thirties, as well as in their early twenties; nursing is attracting interest from different age groups and the entry classes are limited by capacity and not by shortage of qualified applicants. Expansion of the number of nursing educational programs and their capacity will require investment in facilities and faculty training. It is estimated that the shortages of nurses in the USA in 2020 will range from 240,000 to 600,000, but probably closer to the smaller number.",

Certificate courses are in fields where the nursing role involves highly skilled practice crucial to patient outcomes such as in intensive care or emergency department nursing. Master's programs in areas such as pediatrics, geriatrics, or adult health produce a more broadly based and independent practitioner, researcher, or educator. Nursing specialties include ambulatory care, cardiac, critical care, education, The AACN cites the US Bureau of Labor Statistics' Employment Projections 2010-2020 indicating that the RN workforce is the top occupation in terms of job growth to 2020. The number of employed nurses is expected to grow from 2.74 million in 2010 to 3.45 million in 2020, an increase of 712,000 or 26 percent. There is an additional need for 495,500 replacements in the nursing workforce, bringing the total number of job openings for nurses due to growth and replacements to 1.2 million by 2020 (AACN, 2012). A 2011 AACN survey found that total enrollment in all nursing programs leading to the baccalaureate degree was 259,100, an increase from 238,799 in 2010. Within this population, 169,125 students are enrolled in entry-level baccalaureate nursing programs. In graduate programs, 94,480 students are enrolled in master's programs, 4907 in researchfocused doctoral programs, and 9094 in practice-focused doctoral programs in nursing (AACN, 2012) . Figure 14 .1 shows the growth of the US nursing workforce and the distribution between registered and employed from 1980 to 2008. The nurse-to-population ratio increased from 56 per 10,000 in 1980 to 69 in 1990 and 78.5 in 1994. The number of employed RNs increased during the period 1999-2005 by an average of 1.2 percent per annum, from 2.2 million to 2.4 million (Health United States, 2007) .",

Expanding roles of nurses in the changing health care environment will be vital to meet the challenges. There is a need to address retention of nurses and prevention of burnout, as well as to produce greater training capacity to absorb qualified applicants. Nursing has become an attractive profession because of the expansion of its roles and because of academization with greater recognition for the profession, yet the profession remains underpaid in comparison to the crucial role of nurses in health systems and to other professions with similar qualifications. However, as economies shift from primary production to service-based industries, this may change the relative economic remuneration for this professional group. National health authorities need to take professional views into account, but balance the vested interests of each profession with other factors such as the hospital bed supply and utilization, alternative forms of care (which can be labor intensive), aging of the population, changing disease patterns, and technological changes in prevention and health care. The development of training capacity for doctors, nurses, and all other health professions requires long-term planning and investment not only in building institutions for education, but also in developing faculty, research capacity, and scholarships for students along with modest tuition fees.

Departments of community health within a medical faculty serve as only one department among many clinical or basic science departments. Such departments may lack prestige in the hierarchy of medical schools, in an environment promoting a narrow, medically oriented approach to public health, with an insufficiently multidisciplinary program and faculty. This model provides training at the undergraduate, MPH, and doctoral levels. The full academic potential of a graduate school of public health is most suited to be in an independent, multidisciplinary, university-based academic center for public health research and training.",

By this agreement, signatory states agreed in principle to work towards a European Higher Education Area (EHEA), to improve the quality of higher (i.e., post-secondary) education, and to provide for enhanced movement of students and academics within the EU. The motivation was to harmonize and raise European standards of postsecondary education to competitive levels in an education-based world competitive economy. The three overall objectives of the Bologna Process have been from the start: introduction of the three cycle system (bachelor/master/doctorate), quality assurance, and recognition of qualifications and periods of study. The Bologna Declaration initiated a \"series of reforms needed to make European Higher Education more compatible and comparable, more competitive and more attractive for Europeans and for students and scholars from other continents. Reform was needed then and reform is still needed today if Europe is to match the performance of the best performing systems in the world\" (European Commission, 2012) (Box 14.11).",

Many European countries are still in transition or development with currently poor standards of public health. Training in professional aspects of public health is vital to the educational goals of participating members, but also to the public health movement as a whole, within basic principles of ethics and values for the modern public health movement, this fails to provide students at the graduate-school level with an academic environment and the multidisciplinary training and specialization that the field requires to provide the professional leadership needed to meet the health challenges of their societies. Leadership positions in health systems at the local, state, and federal levels are now held by doctors trained in clinical medicine, often with added training in public health. Few, however, have training in management and many received training focused on subspecialties of public health. In contrast, schools of public health at the doctoral level focus on the preparation of scholars in research and teaching rather than health leadership and management. Some seek preparation in Master's of Business Administration (MBA) programs. Preparation at the PhD level of doctors in public health requires post-baccalaureate training with broad areas of knowledge: tools of social analysis, health and disease in populations, promotion of health and prevention of disease, and health care systems and their management (see Box 14.10). Some schools of public health are moving in this direction by providing special part-time programs for working health executives. These will be especially important in the preparation of leadership capable of coping with the complexities of managed care or district health programs which are developing in many countries facing the organizational, economic, and ethical aspects of individual and population health.",

This led to an increase in demand for preventive medicine and public health training, as medical care costs were thought by economists to be a function of need and demand. Health education programs designed to reduce health risks and reduce costs were shown to have documented effectiveness, with reductions in claims of 20 percent in some health insurance systems in the USA. Specific program features including chronic disease self-management, risk reduction, and increased self-efficacy appear important. This concept was further supported by the review by the CDC of public health achievements in the twentieth century, in which reductions of the burden of disease were directly related in large measure to public health programs. In the late 20th and first decade of the 21st century, new challenges with important achievements were seen with HIV, SARS, bioterrorism, and natural pandemics heightened the sense of concern, need, and urgency to strengthen public health training in the USA and internationally.",

The Bucharest Communiqu\u00e9 builds on the previous Leuven Communiqu\u00e9 of 2009 to establish the following priorities for 2010-2020:l Ensuring a quality higher education system in the European Union.l Adopting a two-or three-cycle system of study (BA, MA, PhD) . l Promoting the mobility of students and academic and administrative staff. l Introducing a credit system (ECTS) for the assessment of study performance. l Recognition of levels: adopting a system of easily identifiable and comparable levels. l Active involvement of higher education institutions, teachers and students in the Bologna Process. l Student participation in the management of higher education.l Promoting a European dimension in higher education. l Promoting the attractiveness of the European higher education area. l Lifelong learning. l A European higher education area and a European research area -two pillars of a society based on knowledge. l Accreditation or certification of a degree program requires a review of the standards for content and vocational relevance of the degree to be awarded for a limited period within the frame of a transparent, formal, and external peer review. and of the highest standards of public health practice. In 2011, ASPHER established the Agency for Public Health Education Accreditation (APHEA) in association with other prominent public health organizations to accredit MPH programs in Europe. The core subject domain criteria for accreditation are shown in Table 14 .10 and the first two European MPH programs underwent accreditation in 2012. At the same time, strong interest is evolving in defining competencies of graduates of MPH programs (Box 14.13).Schools of public health are of special importance for developing countries because of the prime importance of public health approaches in meeting their health needs. Nigeria is a very populous country where the main health issues are those in the public health sector, yet there are over 20 medical schools and no school of public health. Departments of social or community medicine, primarily teaching medical students, are common in most medical schools, but BOX 14.12 Principles of Public Health Education Standardization for Europe l Public health as an organized system is vital for societies for long-term improvement in health of the population and to meet emergency situations of pandemics, disasters, and bioterrorism. l Public health depends on laws, organizational structure, resources, planning, and training. The WHO must take a leadership role in promoting public health reform and education, networking with organizations already active in this field such as ASPHER, EUPHA, and others. l Ministries of Health should be proactive in developing robust structures and training programs for public health in conjunction with sister ministries and academic organizations.l Europe-wide standards and health targets will help individual countries to cope with these challenges. l Europe-wide funding to promote new organization and training capacities in member countries is essential to enable this process to happen and to implement the intent of the Bologna Declaration in higher education.",

            "text": "Preparation for policy and management roles in public health and health systems has become widespread in schools of public health and in business schools in the USA. This trend will undoubtedly increase as managed care increases, and as intersectoral mergers or other functional arrangements become more common. Departments of management and policy or health services in schools of public health have the mission to study and seek methods of improving efficiency and effectiveness of personal and population-based health organizations. As academic fields, they share a population perspective that includes interdisciplinary faculty from economics, law, management, medicine, history, sociology, and policy l Competencies denote the potential for specific, defined performance standards of knowledge and skills based on public health theory and science. l Competencies must be observable and transparent through appropriate performance patterns required for their achievement, related to appropriate methods to meet existent public health challenges. l In public health, competencies are needed throughout complex interactive systems for achievement of goals in the mission of public health. l Patterns of competencies can be assigned to individuals, professional groups, and public health organizationsthus both to individual public health professionals and to accreditation of public health institutions, systems, and other organizations, e.g., those serving specific geographic areas or populations. l European lists of public health competencies cover the education levels defined by the Bologna Process, i.e., bachelor's, master's, PhD and continuing professional development (CPD). l Documentation of satisfactory demonstration of competencies can be used as effective indicators of progress through education and training programs, leading to certification of fitness to practice in either service or academic public health careers. l Certification or licensing of public health professionals, especially in countries with established coherent public health systems and well-defined career structures, can be based upon effective completion of a systematic education and training program. l Lists of public health competencies have been developed by public health organizations in the USA, Canada, Australia, and Europe, as well as by groups and associations concerned with public health in general or subspecialties of public health such as health promotion. l Such lists have many practical applications, e.g., in planning, delivery, and evaluation of education, training, and service programmes, in demonstration of completion of training, or to support employment in construction of job descriptions and in annual reviews of performance. l Even with similarities, there are variations in the structure of lists of public health competencies, e.g., between two UK lists (one designed for training, the other for employment), and the lists produced by the US Association of Schools of Public Health (ASPH). l ASPHER's European Core Competencies Programme has, since its initiation in 2006, involved about 100 researchers/teachers at member schools, European Ministries of Health, civil servants, and public health practitioners. International conferences were devoted to discussion of competencies, workshops at European and global public health conferences, as well as practitioner-school workshops in a series of European countries, with support by the EU in collaboration with public health partner organizations.l As of September 2012, ASPHER's European lists of expanded core competencies (population health, health systems, and public health operations) have been endorsed by member states of the World Health Organization's European Region.",
