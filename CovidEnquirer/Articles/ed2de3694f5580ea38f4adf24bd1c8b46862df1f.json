            "text": "Background: Mannose-binding lectin is a collectin involved in host defense against infection. Whether mannose-binding lectin deficiency is associated with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is debated. Methods: Participants in a study designed to determine if azithromycin taken daily for one year decreased acute exacerbations had serum mannose-binding lectin concentrations measured at the time of enrollment. Results: Samples were obtained from 1037 subjects (91%) in the trial. The prevalence of mannose-binding lectin deficiency ranged from 0.5% to 52.2%, depending on how deficiency was defined. No differences in the prevalence of deficiency were observed with respect to any demographic variable assessed, and no differences were observed in time to first exacerbation, rate of exacerbations, or percentage of subjects requiring hospitalization for exacerbations in those with deficiency versus those without, regardless of how deficiency was defined. Conclusion: In a large sample of subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease selected for having an increased risk of experiencing an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, only 1.9% had mannose-binding lectin concentrations below the normal range and we found no association between mannose-binding lectin concentrations and time to first acute exacerbation or frequency of acute exacerbations during one year of prospective follow-up.",

            "text": "Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a pattern-recognition collectin that is related to surfactant proteins A and D and has two roles in host defense. MBL activates complement via serine proteases, particularly MBL-associated serine protease-2, with which it circulates. 1,2 MBL is also involved in opsonophagocytosis, binding several types of pathogens to phagocytes via its carbohydrate recognition domain, triggering release of a number of proinflammatory cytokines [3] [4] [5] and facilitating clearance of apoptotic cells. 6 MBL is secreted primarily by the liver and circulates in the serum. Low MBL concentrations occur as a result of one of three single nucleotide polymorphisms on exon 1, but the most common cause of deficiency in Caucasians is the LXP haplotype resulting from polymorphisms of the promoter region of the gene, presenting either as a homozygous mutation or in combination with other haplotypes. [7] [8] [9] Several observations suggest that MBL deficiency may compromise host defense in the lungs. MBL binds to carbohydrates on the surface of a number of respiratory pathogens that are associated with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including Haemophilus influenzae, 10, 11 Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 12 and influenza. 13 Patients with cystic fibrosis and low MBL concentrations have decreased lung function, an increased prevalence of Burkholderia cepacia infection, and reduced survival relative to patients with cystic fibrosis and normal MBL concentrations. The difference in survival is particularly notable in those with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and those with homozygous mutations in the MBL-2 gene. [14] [15] [16] [17] Low MBL concentrations have been associated with an increased risk of respiratory infections in immunocompetent subjects, [18] [19] [20] [21] with an increased frequency of respiratory syncytial virus infections, 22 and with worse outcomes in patients with community-acquired pneumonia and Streptococcus pneumoniae infections. [23] [24] [25] [26] MBL concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from a small number of current and former smokers with COPD are lower than those in fluid from healthy controls and tend to be higher in former smokers than in current smokers, 27, 28 but no association has been found between genotypes producing low MBL concentrations and the prevalence of COPD. 29 However, studies assessing the association of low MBL concentrations with acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPDs) report conflicting results. [30] [31] [32] Accordingly, we prospectively measured MBL concentrations in a large cohort of subjects with COPD who were at increased risk of experiencing acute exacerbations and followed them for one year while tracking the number of acute exacerbations that occurred. Our hypothesis was that subjects with COPD who had an increased risk of experiencing an AECOPD would have more frequent acute exacerbations during one year of follow-up if they were deficient in MBL than if they were not.",

Yang et al 30 found that 24 of 82 (29%) subjects with COPD had MBL-deficient genotypes. These subjects had lower MBL concentrations than those with the wild-type genotype (107 ng/mL, IQR 30-246, range 21-7675 versus 920 ng/mL, IQR 398-1355, range 21-2256, P , 0.001). MBL concentrations were not presented in a fashion that allowed determination of the prevalence of MBL deficiency based on the definitions used in the literature. Forty of the 82 patients (49%) had one or more admissions for AECOPDs during a two-year follow-up period and 18 of these (45%) had MBL-deficient genotypes. Forty-two patients had no AECOPDs and only six (14%) of these had MBL-deficient genotypes (odds ratio 4.9 95% CI 1.7-14.4, P = 0.0037). We did not determine MBL genotypes but genotypes do not COPD (P = 0.23 and P = 0.10, respectively). No association between MBL concentration and a history of AECOPDs was observed, but no information was provided with respect to how AECOPDs were defined. Eagan et al 31 also noted that subjects with GOLD stage 3 disease had a higher prevalence of MBL deficiency (defined as #100 ng/mL). We found no demographic or COPD severity indicators that were more or less common in subjects with MBL deficiency, regardless of how deficiency was defined ( Table 1) . The strengths of our study include the large sample size, the multicenter design, and the prospective ascertainment of AECOPDs using an event-based (ie, health care utilization) definition. Our study population was enriched by enrolling subjects whom we anticipated would be at increased submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com risk of experiencing an AECOPD within the one-year follow-up period, based on previous predictors identified by Niewoehner et al. 34 This should have increased the likelihood of finding a higher prevalence of MBL deficiency, regardless of how deficiency was defined, compared with the prevalence in healthy controls. Our study has a number of limitations. First, we only measured MBL concentrations on one occasion. Several groups have demonstrated that MBL is an acute phase reactant. [41] [42] [43] However, in clinically stable patients, MBL concentrations are constant over time, 42, 44 and our patients had to be free of AECOPDs for at least 4 weeks before meeting inclusion criteria. In addition, even during acute phase responses, MBL concentrations in patients with low concentrations only increase by 1.5-4.3-fold and do not reach normal values. 45, 46 Accordingly, we suggest that there is a low likelihood of our data being confounded by spuriously elevated concentrations of MBL resulting in an underestimate of the prevalence of MBL deficiency.",

Approximately 30% and 4%-8% of the normal population have heterozygous or homozygous genetic mutations, respectively, associated with low MBL concentrations. 35 Although MBL concentrations are well correlated with genotypes, (eg, MBL concentrations , 50 ng/mL are 100% sensitive and 83% specific for variant exon-1 polymorphisms 43 ) subjects with wild-type MBL genes may still have low concentrations of MBL, 35 and MBL concentrations may vary as much as 10-fold in patients with identical genotypes for all of the MBL variants described to date. 38 Accordingly, assessing relationships between MBL concentrations and AECOPDs is likely to be a more sensitive approach than genotyping. 21 Similarly, we did not assess MBL function using a complement deposition assay. Bouwman et al 47 and Eisen 48 suggested that while MBL function was a better way of defining MBL deficiency than determining MBL concentrations, assessing MBL concentrations was \"most appropriate\" for defining MBL deficiency in studies seeking associations with infections. Differences between MBL binding and complement activation may vary depending on the method of assessment, 49 and MBL concentrations from 500 ng/mL to 1000 ng/mL are associated with decreases in function by up to 90%. 9 While we saw no association between MBL deficiency and AECOPDs, MBL deficiency could still be associated with AECOPDs that result from infection with one or more specific pathogens if the frequency with which these specific pathogens affected our subjects was too low to discern the association. However, we think this possibility is unlikely, because the two studies documenting the association between MBL deficiency and AECOPDs found an association with AECOPDs that were not otherwise defined by cause or potential infecting organism. 30, 32 In addition, Lin et al 32 found no difference in the distribution of pathogens in those subjects with AECOPD and without MBL-deficient genotypes.",

Accordingly, our data do not support the idea that MBL might be a therapeutic target to reduce the incidence of AECOPDs.
