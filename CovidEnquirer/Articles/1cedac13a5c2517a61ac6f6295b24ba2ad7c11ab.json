Therefore, we develop attenuated vaccines from local strains in Taiwan. A Taiwan Group I (TW I) strain was passaged 74 times through specific pathogen-free (SPF) chicken embryonated eggs, and then tested in SPF chickens. The attenuated vaccine was not pathogenic in 1-week-old chicks, had a neutralization index (NI) of greater than 4.4 and efficacy of 90% when inoculated birds were challenged with a field IBV strain. Similar results were obtained for a vaccine made from a Taiwan Group II IBV strain. Additionally, the TW I attenuated vaccine strain had no reversion to virulence after five back passages in chicks. In conclusion, these attenuated vaccines have potential for controlling local Taiwanese IBV infections in chickens.",

IBV is in Group 3 of the Coronavirus genus, and the other two groups comprise mammalian coronaviruses that differ extensively from IBV [8] . Besides the three groups, a novel coronaviruses (SARS-CoV) caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged in humans in Guangdong Province, China, during November 2002, and globally disseminated within months. SARS-CoV appears to have arisen as a result of the zoonotic transmission of an animal coronavirus to humans, and patients often have evidence of multiple organ dysfunction and lower respiratory tract infection [15, 20] .",

The infected chickens show signs of depression, coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge, polyuria and death [8, 10] . Less commonly, some strains of IBV exhibit tropisms for the alimentary tract and kidneys, and the major IBVs isolated in Taiwan are mostly nephrotropic strains. Based on restriction fragment length polymorphism, the IBVs in Taiwan may be divided to two groups, Taiwan Group I (TW I) and Taiwan Group II (TW II) , and are different from other genotypes in the world [25, 26] . Although vaccines have generally been used extensively, outbreaks of IB occur frequently due to serotype differences. It is well known that little or no cross protection occurs between different serotypes of IBV [3, 9, 17] , and emergence of new variant strains occurs frequently.",

The phylogenetic tree also shows that most local strains are in Taiwanese clusters, developing attenuated vaccines from local strains is necessary for IBV control in Taiwan. Though live attenuated vaccines reverts to pathogenicity, and there is a potential for the formation of variant viruses by recombinant with field strains, but these vaccines induce good immunity responses [5, 11] , and fortunately no recombination was found between H120 and the Taiwanese strains in the S1 gene [12] . Furthermore, even IBV strains isolated from China, which is quite close to Taiwan geographically, are quite different from Taiwanese strains. Based on the comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences before and after high numbers of passage, attenuation does not appear to correlate with mutation after high numbers of passage. One possible reason for this is that the attenuation in this study may have been due to mutations in other genes, not in the S1 subunit and/or N gene. Another possibility is that the attenuation might be related to many factors, and not limited to specific loci in the S1 subunit and/or N gene. However, since the S1 subunit is known to contain regions related to viral neutralizing, serotype-specific, and haemagglutinationinhibiting antibodies [14, 19] , greater numbers of passages using several IBV strains will be needed to further characterize the attenuation of IBVs.",
