Slow-onset (or ''creeping''): Incremental but long-term and cumulative environmental changes that usually receive little attention in their early phases but which, over time, may cause serious crises. These include such issues as deteriorating air and water quality, soil pollution, acid rain, climate change, desertification processes (including soil erosion and land degradation), drought, ecosystems change, deforestation and forest fragmentation, loss of biodiversity and habitats, nitrogen overloading, radioactive waste, coastal erosion, pressures on living marine resources, rapid and unplanned urban growth, environment and health issues (emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases and links to environmental change), land cover/land changes, and environmental impacts of conflict, among others. Such creeping changes are often left unaddressed as policy-makers choose or need to cope with immediate crises. Eventually, neglected creeping changes may become urgent crises that are more costly to deal with. Slow-onset threats can be classified into location-specific environmental threats, new emerging science and contemporary environmental threats (Table 1) .",

Early Warning systems may provide seconds of available warning time for earthquakes to months of warning for droughts, which are the quickest and slowest onset hazards, respectively. Specifically, early warning systems provide tens of seconds of warning for earthquakes, days to hours for volcanic eruptions, and hours for tsunamis. Tornado warnings provide minutes of lead-time for response. Hurricane warning time varies from weeks to hours. The warning time provided by warning systems, increases to years or even decades of leadtime available for slow-onset threats (such as El Ni\u00f1 o, global warming etc., as shown in Fig. 1 ). Drought warning time is in the range of months to weeks. Slow-onset (or creeping) changes may cause serious problems to environment and society, if preventive measures are not taken when needed. Such creeping environmental changes require effective early warning technologies due to the high potential impact of incremental cumulative changes on society and the environment.

This step provides the input information for the early warning process that needs to be disseminated to those whose responsibility is to respond (Fig. 2) . Early warnings may be disseminated to targeted users (local early warning applications) or broadly to communities, regions or to media (regional or global early warning applications). This information gives the possibility of taking action to initiate mitigation or security measures before a catastrophic event occurs. When monitoring and predicting systems are associated with communication systems and response plans, they are considered early warning systems (Glantz, 2003) . Commonly, however, early warning systems lack one or more elements. In fact, a review of existing early warning systems shows that in most cases communication systems and adequate response plans are missing.",

Timeliness often conflicts with the desire to have reliable predictions, which become more accurate as more observations are collected from the monitoring system . Thus, there is an inevitable trade-off between the amount of warning time available and the reliability of the predictions provided by the EWS. An initial alert signal may be sent to give the maximum amount of warning time when a minimum level of prediction accuracy has been reached. However, the prediction accuracy for the location and size of the event will continue to improve as more data are collected by the monitoring system part of the EWS network. It must be understood that every prediction, by its very nature, is associated with uncertainty. Because of the uncertainties associated with the predicted parameters that characterize the incoming disaster, it is possible that a wrong decision may be made. Two kinds of wrong decisions may occur : Missed Alarm (or False Negative), when the mitigation action is not taken when it should have been or False Alarm (or False Positive), when the mitigation action is taken when it should not have been.",

Infra-red (IR) video and photography from airborne platforms, thermal infrared imaging, airborne laser fluorosensors, airborne and satellite optical sensors, as well as airborne and satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) are used for this purpose. SAR has the advantage of also providing data during cloud cover conditions and darkness, unlike optical sensors. In addition, optical-sensor techniques applied to oil spills detection are associated to a high number of false alarms, more often cloud shadows, sun glint, and other conditions such as precipitation, fog, and the amounts of daylight present also may be erroneously associated with oil spills. For this reason, SAR is preferred over optical sensors, especially when spills cover vast areas of the marine environment, and when the oil cannot be seen or discriminated against the background. SAR detects changes in sea-surface roughness patterns modified by oil spills. The largest shortcoming of oil spills detection using SAR images is accurate discrimination between oil spills and natural films (Brekke and Soldberg, 2005) . To date, operational application of satellite imagery for oil spill detection still remains a challenge due to limited spatial and temporal resolution. In addition, processing times are often too long for operational purposes, and it is still not possible to measure the thickness of the oil spill (Mansor et al., 2007; US Fig. 3 .

This energy is released through seismic waves that travel from the origin zone, which cause the ground to shake. Severe earthquakes can affect buildings and populations. The level of damage depends on many factors, such as the intensity and depth of the earthquake, and the vulnerability of structures and their distance from the earthquake's origin. For earthquakes, information on the location and magnitude of the event first needs to be conveyed to responsible authorities. This information is used by seismic early warning systems to activate security measures within seconds after the earthquake's origin and before strong shaking occurs at the site. Shakemaps generated within five minutes provide essential information to assess the intensity of ground shaking and the damaged areas. The combination of data from seismic networks and GPS may help to increase reliability and timeliness of this information. Earthquake frequency and probability shakemaps based on historical seismicity and base maps (geological, soil type, active faults, hydrological, and DEMs), assist in the earthquake mitigation phase and need to be included in the building code design process for improved land use and building practices. For responses, additional data are needed, such as seismicity, intensity, strain, DEMs, soil type, moisture conditions, infrastructure and population, to produce post-event damage maps. Thermal information needs to continuously be monitored. This is obtained from low/medium resolution IR imagery from polar and geostationary satellites for thermal background characterization (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), ATSR, MODIS and GOES) together with deformation from EDM and/or GPS network; borehole strainmetres; and SAR interferometry.",

Forecasting the location and extent of ground instability or landslides is quite challenging. Landslides can be preceded by cracks, accelerating movement, and rock fall activity. Real-time monitoring of key parameters thus becomes essential. The observed acceleration, deformation or displacement, exceeding a theoretical pre-fixed threshold is the trigger for issuing an alert signal. An alternative approach is based on hydrologic forecasting. It should be said that for large areas site-specific monitoring is not feasible. In this case, hazard mapping associated with monitoring of high risk zones remains the best option for warning.

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor measures the relative amount of aerosols and the relative size of aerosol particles-solid or liquid particles suspended in the atmosphere. Examples of such aerosols include dust, sea salts, volcanic ash, and smoke. The MODIS aerosol optical depth product is a measure of how much light airborne particles prevent from passing through a column of atmosphere. New technologies are also being explored for monitoring air quality, such as mobile phones equipped with simple sensors to empower citizens to collect and share real-time air quality measurements. This technology is being developed by a consortium called Urban Atmospheres.",

For the present study, several sources have been used, such as the Global Survey of Early Warning Systems (United Nations, 2006) together with the online inventory of early warning systems on ISDR's Platform for the Promotion of Early Warning (PPEW) website, and several additional online sources, technical reports and scientific articles listed in the references. For each hazard type, a gap analysis has been carried out to identify critical aspects and future needs of EWS, considering aspects such as geographical coverage, and essential EWS elements such as monitoring and prediction capability, communication systems and application of early warning information in responses. Below is the outcome of the review of existing early warning/monitoring systems for each hazard type. Details of all systems, organized in tables by hazard type, are listed in the Appendix. The current gaps identified for each hazard type could be related to technological, organizational, communication or geographical coverage aspects. To assess the geographical coverage of existing systems for each hazard type, the existing systems have been imposed on the hazard's risk map.

Although various early warning systems exist worldwide at the local or regional scale, there are still high seismic risk areas that lack early warning applications, such as Peru, Chile, Iran, Pakistan, and India. The International Consortium on Landslides (ICL), created at the Kyoto Symposium in January 2002, is an international non-governmental and non-profit scientific organization, which is supported by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the WMO, FAO, and the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UN/ISDR). ICL's mission is to promote landslide research for the benefit of society and the environment and promote a global, multidisciplinary programme regarding landslides. ICL provides information about current landslides on its website, streaming this information from various sources such as the Geological Survey of Canada. This information does not provide any early warning since it is based on news reports after the events have occurred. Enhancing ICL's existing organizational infrastructure by improving landslide prediction capability would allow ICL to provide early warning to authorities and populations. Technologies for slopes monitoring has greatly improved, but currently only few slopes are being monitored at a global scale. The use of these technologies would be greatly beneficial for mitigating losses from landslides worldwide.",

Parts of Europe (Spain, parts of France, southern Sweden, and northern Poland) are characterized by high drought risk but have no system in place. India, parts of Thailand, Turkey, Iran, Iraq, eastern China, areas of Ecuador, Colombia, and the south-eastern and western parts of Australia also require a drought warning system.",

The WFP is also involved in disseminating reports and news on famine crises through its web service. No active dissemination is provided by WFP. Another service is FEWS net, a collaborative effort of the USGS, United States Agency for International Development (USAID), NASA, and NOAA, which reports on food insecurity conditions and issues watches and warnings to decision-makers. These bulletins are also available on their website. Food security prediction estimates and maps would be extremely useful for emergency response, resources allocation, and early warning. The Food Security and Nutrition Working Group (FSNWG) serves as a platform to promote the disaster risk reduction agenda in the region and provides monthly updates on food security through maps and reports available on its website. FEWSnet and FSNWG were instrumental in predicting the food crisis in 2010-2011 in the East African Region in a timely manner. Nevertheless these early warnings did not lead to early action to address the food crisis. If they had been used adequately, the impacts of the serious humanitarian crisis in the Horn of Africa could have been partially mitigated (Ververs, 2011) .",

Although it is imperative to continue with these efforts, the on-going pace of climate change and the slow international response suggests that a third option is becoming increasingly important: to protect the population against the immediate threat and consequences of climate-related extreme events, including heat waves, forest fires, floods and droughts, by providing it with timely, reliable and actionable warnings. Although great strides have been made in developing climate-related warning systems over the past few years, current systems only deal with some aspects of climate related risks or hazards, and have large gaps in geographic coverage. Information exists for melting glaciers, lake water level, sea height and sea surface temperature anomalies, El Nino and La Nina. The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC)-Ice Concentration and Snow Extent provides near real-time data on daily global ice concentration and snow coverage. The USDA, in cooperation with the NASA and the University of Maryland, routinely monitors lake and reservoir height variations for approximately 100 lakes worldwide and provides online public access to lake water level data. Information on Sea Height Anomaly (SHA) and Significant Wave Height data are available from altimeter JASON-1, TOPEX, ERS-2, ENVISAT and GFO on a near-real time basis with an average 2-day delay. This information is provided by NOAA. Additionally, near real-time Sea Surface Temperature (SST) products are available from NOAA's GOES and POES, as well as NASA's EOS, Aqua and Terra. The International Research Institute (IRI) for Climate and Society provides a monthly summary of the El Nino and La Nina Southern Oscillation, providing forecast summary, probabilistic forecasts, and a sea surface temperature index. However, these systems are still far from providing the coverage and scope that is needed and technically feasible. Large parts of the world's most vulnerable regions are still not covered by a comprehensive early warning system. Most systems only deal with one aspect of climate-related risks or hazards, e.g., heat waves or drought. Finally, most systems do not cover the entire early warning landscape from collection of meteorological data to delivery and response of users. Recently, the World Meteorological Organization proposed a Global Framework for Climate Services, which aims to strengthen the global cooperative system for collecting, processing and exchanging observations and for using climate-related information (WMO, 2011).",

Most countries appear to have early warning systems for disaster risk reduction. However, there is still a technological and national capacity divide between developed and developing countries. From an operational point of view, some elements of the early warning process are not yet mature.

By building upon ongoing efforts to promote early warning, a multi-hazard early warning system will have a critical role in preventing hazardous events from turning into disasters. A globally comprehensive early warning system can be built, based on the many existing systems and capacities. This will not be a single, centrally planned and commanded system, but a networked and coordinated assemblage of nationally owned and operated systems. It will make use of existing observation networks, warning centres, modelling and forecasting capacities, telecommunication networks, and preparedness and response capacities (United Nations, 2006) .

Technological, geographical coverage, and capacity gaps exist, in addition to operational gaps for slow-onset hazards. In particular, actions need to be taken to improve prediction capabilities for landslides hazard aimed at developing a landslides early warning system. Likewise, there is a pressing need to improve existing prediction capabilities for droughts. A global early fire warning system is not yet in place, the tsunami early warning systems for the Indian Ocean and the Caribbean are not yet fully operational and a desertification early warning system has not been developed yet. There are ongoing efforts to develop these systems, such as the GFMC effort for the global fire EWS, the Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning System operated by Indonesia and a NOAA led effort in the Caribbean. A malaria early warning system is mandatory for Africa, where one million deaths occur every year due to malaria. Climate variability impacts need to be monitored within a global and coordinated effort, and the Global Framework for Climate Services needs to be further elaborated and operationalized. Local earthquake early warning systems applications are needed in high seismic risk areas, where early warning systems are not yet in place. Air quality and flood systems require improvements in prediction capabilities. Dust storms and transboundary early warning systems do not yet exist. A coordinated volcanic early warning system that would integrate existing resources is also needed as well as an increase in coverage of volcanic observatories. Particular attention should be paid to fill gaps in decision making processes for slow-onset hazards. Their extent and impact are challenging to quantify. For this reason, actions and response are far more difficult tasks for slow-onset hazards than they are for other natural hazards. An institutional mechanism to regularly monitor and communicate slow-onset changes is needed to keep changes under review and to enable rational and timely decisions to be taken based on improved information. (2) Build capacity: The evaluation study of existing early warning systems (the Section 3) highlighted that a technological divide between developed and developing countries still exists. It is critical to develop basic early warning infrastructures and capacities in parts of the developing world most affected by disasters; it is also important to promote education programs on disaster mitigation and preparedness and integrate disaster mitigation plans into the broader development context. Poor countries suffer greater economic losses from disasters than rich countries. Development plays a key role and has a significant impact on disaster risk. Almost 85 percent of the people exposed to the deadliest hazards, earthquakes, floods, cyclones and droughts live in the developing world. The impact of disasters is mostly influenced by previous development choices. By integrating disaster mitigation strategies into planning and policies, the effects of disasters can be sensibly reduced and managed. ''Disaster risk is not inevitable, but on the contrary can be managed and reduced through appropriate development actions'' (United Nations Development Programme-UNDP, 2004) . It is through ''risk-sensitive development planning that countries can help reduce disaster risks''. Key targets for capacity building include the following:",

Bridging the gap between scientific research and decision making will make it possible to fully exploit capacities of early warning technologies for societal benefit. The major challenge is to ensure that early warnings result in prompt responses by governments and potentially the international community. This requires that information be effectively disseminated in an accessible form down to the end user. This is achievable by adopting standard formats and easy-to-use tools for information dissemination, such as interactive maps, emails, SMS, etc. The adoption of standard formats (such as the Common Alerting Protocol CAP) for disseminating and exchanging information has to be promoted. The advantage of standard format alerts is their compatibility with all information systems, warning systems, media, and most importantly, with new technologies such as web services. The adoption of standard formats guarantees consistency of warning messages and is compatible with all types of information systems and public alerting systems, including broadcast radio and television as well as public and private data networks, with multi-lingual warning systems and emerging technologies. This would easily replace specific application oriented messages and will allow the merging of warning messages from several early warning systems into a single multihazard message format. Finally, it is critical to strengthen coordination and communication links by defining responsibility mechanisms and appropriate action plans. More often, time-sequenced warning messages are released in early warning processes, implying a decrease in warning times available for action and in reliability of the information.

Aerosols may be of either natural or anthropogenic origin. Air quality: Smog is the product of human and natural activities such as industry, transportation, wild-fires, volcanic eruptions, etc. and can have serious effects on human health and the environment. US EPA uses and Air Quality Index (AQI) which is calculated on five major air pollutants regulated by the Clean Air Act: ground-level ozone, particle pollution (also known as particulate matter), carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. For each of these pollutants, EPA has established national air quality standards to protect public health. Groundlevel ozone and airborne particles are the two pollutants that pose the greatest threat to human health in this country. Biodiversity: The variety of life on Earth, including diversity at the genetic level, among species and among ecosystems and habitats. It includes diversity in abundance, distribution and in behaviour. Biodiversity also incorporates human cultural diversity, which can both be affected by the same drivers as biodiversity, and itself has impacts on the diversity of genes, other species and ecosystems. Biofuels: Fuel produced from dry organic matter or combustible oils from plants, such as alcohol from fermented sugar, black liquor from the paper manufacturing process, wood and soybean oil. Biomass: Organic material, both above ground and below ground, and both living and dead, such as trees, crops, grasses, tree litter and roots. Capacity: The combination of all the strengths, attributes and resources available within a community, society or organization that can be used to achieve agreed goals. Comment: Capacity may include infrastructure and physical means, institutions, societal coping abilities, as well as human knowledge, skills and collective attributes such as social relationships, leadership and management. Capacity also may be described as capability. Capacity assessment is a term for the process by which the capacity of a group is reviewed against desired goals, and the capacity gaps are identified for further action. Capacity building: Process of developing the technical skills, institutional capability, and personnel. Climate change: Change of climate, which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods. Climate Variability: Variations in the mean state and other statistics (such as standard deviations and the occurrence of extremes) of the climate on all temporal and spatial scales beyond that of individual weather events. Variability may be due to natural internal processes in the climate system (internal variability), or to variations in natural or anthropogenic external forcing (external variability).

Disaster: A serious disruption of the functioning of a community or a society involving widespread human, material, economic or environmental losses and impacts, which exceeds the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources. Comment: Disasters are often described as a result of the combination of: the exposure to a hazard; the conditions of vulnerability that are present; and insufficient capacity or measures to reduce or cope with the potential negative consequences. Disaster impacts may include loss of life, injury, disease and other negative effects on human physical, mental and social well-being, together with damage to property, destruction of assets, loss of services, social and economic disruption and environmental degradation. Disaster risk: The potential disaster losses, in lives, health status, livelihoods, assets and services, which could occur to a particular community or a society over some specified future time period. Comment: The definition of disaster risk reflects the concept of disasters as the outcome of continuously present conditions of risk. Disaster risk comprises different types of potential losses which are often difficult to quantify. Nevertheless, with knowledge of the prevailing hazards and the patterns of population and socio-economic development, disaster risks can be assessed and mapped, in broad terms at least. Disaster risk reduction: The concept and practice of reducing disaster risks through systematic efforts to analyse and manage the causal factors of disasters, including through reduced exposure to hazards, lessened vulnerability of people and property, wise management of land and the environment, and improved preparedness for adverse events. Comment: A comprehensive approach to reduce disaster risks is set out in the United Nations-endorsed Hyogo Framework for Action, adopted in 2005, whose expected outcome is ''The substantial reduction of disaster losses, in lives and the social, economic and environmental assets of communities and countries.'' The International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR) system provides a vehicle for cooperation among Governments, organisations and civil society actors to assist in the implementation of the Framework. Note that while the term ''disaster reduction'' is sometimes used, the term ''disaster risk reduction'' provides a better recognition of the ongoing nature of disaster risks and the ongoing potential to reduce these risks. Droughts: A period of abnormally dry weather sufficiently prolonged for the lack of water to cause serious hydrologic imbalance in the affected area. Early warning system: The set of capacities needed to generate and disseminate timely and meaningful warning information to enable individuals, communities and organizations threatened by a hazard to prepare and to act appropriately and in sufficient time to reduce the possibility of harm or loss. Comment: This definition encompasses the range of factors necessary to achieve effective responses to warnings. A people-centred early warning system necessarily comprises four key elements: knowledge of the risks; monitoring, analysis and forecasting of the hazards; communication or dissemination of alerts and warnings; and local capabilities to respond to the warnings received. The expression ''end-to-end warning system'' is also used to emphasize that warning systems need to span all steps from hazard detection through to community response. Earth observation: Earth Observation, through measuring and monitoring, provides an insight and understanding into Earth's complex processes and changes. EO include measurements that can be made directly or by sensors in-situ or remotely (i.e. satellite remote sensing, aerial surveys, land or ocean-based monitoring systems, Fig. 3 ), to provide key information to models or other tools to support decision making processes. Earthquakes: Earthquakes are due to a sudden release of stresses accumulated around the faults in the Earth's crust. This energy is released through seismic waves that travel from the origin zone, which cause the ground to shake. Severe earthquakes can affect buildings and populations. The level of damage depends on many factors such as intensity of the earthquake, depth, vulnerability of the structures, and distance from the earthquake origin. Ecosystem: Dynamic complex of plant, animal, microorganism communities and their non-living environment, interacting as a functional unit. Ecosystems are irrespective of political boundaries.",

Comment: The El Nino part of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon refers to the well-above average ocean temperatures that occur along the coasts of Ecuador, Peru and northern Chile and across the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, while La Nina part refers to the opposite circumstances when well-below-average ocean temperatures occur. The Southern Oscillation refers to the accompanying changes in the global air pressure patterns that are associated with the changed weather patterns experienced in different parts of the world. Emergency management: The organization and management of resources and responsibilities for addressing all aspects of emergencies, in particular preparedness, response and initial recovery steps. Comment: A crisis or emergency is a threatening condition that requires urgent action. Effective emergency action can avoid the escalation of an event into a disaster. Emergency management involves plans and institutional arrangements to engage and guide the efforts of government, non-government, voluntary and private agencies in comprehensive and coordinated ways to respond to the entire spectrum of emergency needs. The expression ''disaster management'' is sometimes used instead of emergency management. Extensible Markup Language: A markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. E-waste: A generic term encompassing various forms of electrical and electronic equipment that has ceased to be of value and is disposed of. A practical definition of e-waste is ''any electrically powered appliance that fails to satisfy the current owner for its originally intended purpose.'' False Alarm: In the context of Early Warning Systems, a false alarm is defined as the situation in which an alarm is activated when it should not have been.",

Food security: When all people at all times have access to sufficient, safe, nutritious food to maintain a healthy and active life. Forecast: Definite statement or statistical estimate of the likely occurrence of a future event or conditions for a specific area. Comment: In meteorology a forecast refers to a future condition, whereas a warning refers to a potentially dangerous future condition.

Geological hazard: Geological process or phenomenon that may cause loss of life, injury or other health impacts, property damage, loss of livelihoods and services, social and economic disruption, or environmental damage. Comment: Geological hazards include internal earth processes, such as earthquakes, volcanic activity and emissions, and related geophysical processes such as mass movements, landslides, rockslides, surface collapses, and debris or mud flows. Hydrometeorological factors are important contributors to some of these processes. Tsunamis are difficult to categorize; although they are triggered by undersea earthquakes and other geological events, they are essentially an oceanic process that is manifested as a coastal water-related hazard. Within this report, tsunamis are included in the geological hazards group.
