Despite their benign nature, they are a major cause of morbidity and mortality on a worldwide basis. Several viruses have been associated with such illness, of which rhinovirus is the most common. Symptom production is a combination of viral cytopathic effect and the activation of inflammatory pathways. Therefore, antiviral treatment alone may not be able to prevent these events. The optimal use of such agents also requires earlier initiation; therefore, it is important to develop accurate and rapid diagnostic techniques for respiratory viruses. Before any reliable and effective treatment is available, symptomatic therapies may remain the only possible choice of management. D",

Most observers consider colds to include symptoms of rhinitis with variable degrees of pharyngitis, but the major associated symptoms include nasal stuffiness and discharge, sneezing, sore throat, cough and hoarse voice. Patients frequently report chills, but significant high temperature is unusual. Colds are usually self-limiting to previously healthy individuals, but there are also recognised complications such as secondary bacterial infections, exacerbations of asthma [1] , chronic obstructive airways disease [2] and cystic fibrosis [3 -5] . Despite the benign nature of the illness in the majority of cases, it is still a significant economic burden on society. It leads to an increase in consultations with clinicians, increased absence from school and work and subsequently causes loss of earnings.",

Rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are spread by direct hand contact with contaminated skin and environmental surfaces. This is followed by self-inoculation of virus into the nasal mucosa or conjunctiva [6] . Airborne transmission of rhinovirus is also possible, but this depends on the duration of exposure to infected individuals [7] . Transmission of parainfluenza virus (PIV) is by direct person-to-person contact or by large particle aerosol spread. The high rate of infection in childhood, coupled with the frequency of reinfection, suggests that they spread from person to person. There is evidence to suggest that the infectious dose of PIV is small, as two-thirds of volunteers developed flu-like symptoms following low-titre PIV intranasal challenge [8] . RSV is spread by infected respiratory secretions. The major route of transmission appears to be by large particle aerosol or direct contact with self-inoculation. Spread requires either close contact with the infected individual or contamination of the hands followed by introduction into conjunctiva. Influenza tends to spread by small-particle aerosols [9] . The relative efficacy of the various transmission routes under natural conditions for each virus is unknown.",

An important feature of coronavirus infection is the short-lived immunity, resulting in a high reinfection rate [21] . The mode of transmission of coronavirus is most likely due to aerosol inhalation. However, it does not grow well at all in cell culture, and therefore, its virology is not fully appreciated. Recently, a novel coronavirus, SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), has been proposed as the cause for the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [22] . The virus induces symptoms of atypical pneumonia, clinically indistinguishable from similar syndromes. The severity is such that a 15% mortality rate has been reported. No treatment has yet been identified as reliably successful. Transmission is by droplet spread, requiring close contact. Stringent infection control precautions in health care institutions, broad isolation measures in affected communities and international surveillance with barrier restrictions to travel have led to termination of the epidemic. As of July 11, 2003 , 8437 people in 32 countries had been affected, with 813 deaths reported [23] .",

First, influenza viruses are able to produce new strains for which most of the population lack immunity, leading to worldwide outbreaks.

This virus possibly accounts for about 10% of unexplained respiratory infections in children during the winter season. Seroprevalence studies show that the virus has been circulating in humans for at least 50 years, that 25% of children by age 1 year have antibodies to the virus and that by age 5 years virtually all are seropositive [34] . Analysis of the amplified sequences showed two clusters of HMPV [35] . The clinical manifestation of HMPV can vary from mild upper respiratory symptoms to severe infections requiring hospital admissions. This clinical picture is indistinguishable form that of other respiratory viruses. Coinfection of HMPV with other respiratory viruses is uncommon [36] , and its role in human respiratory infections is still poorly understood. This new pathogen will certainly warrant long-term surveillance.",

Due to the prevalence of rhinovirus, most of the studies of common colds are based on this virus. The initial deposition of rhinovirus in the eyes and nose leads to attachment of the virus to host cell intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) receptors at the back of the throat. Once inside the nasal epithelial cell, there is no significant increase in the number of inflammatory cells [39] , but increases in neutrophils have been detected in nasal mucosa and secretions [40] . This may reflect the release of a cascade of inflammatory cytokines such as kinins, leukotrienes, histamines, interleukin-1, interleukin-6 interleukin-8, tumour necrosis factor and RANTES (regulated by activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted) [41, 42] , which are partly responsible for the symptoms [43] .

They are distinct from each other by the structural proteins as demonstrated by immunoelectrophoresis and enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant assay (ELISA), despite being similar in charges and molecular weights [46, 47] . HCoV-229E utilises human aminopeptidase N (hAPN) as a receptor to gain entry into the respiratory epithelium. hAPN is a 150-kDa zinc-binding protein with endopeptidase activity. In experimental studies, when human cell cultures are pretreated with monoclonal antibodies against hAPN, viral infection appears blocked [48] . However, HCoV-OC43 gains entry into the respiratory epithelium by using the two surface glycoproteins, Haemagglutinin-esterase (HE) and Spike (S) glycoproteins [49] . Despite their differences in pathogenesis, they both cause similar clinical manifestations [50] . Reinfection of coronavirus is common, though the underlying reason is not clearly defined. It may be due to infection with closely related but different strains [51] or to a reduction in immunity over time [21] . Volunteers who are seropositive to coronavirus prior to intranasal challenge are not completely protected from symptom development [52] .",

It replicates slowly in primary cynomolgus monkey kidney cells and poorly in Vero cells and A549 cells (a human respiratory epithelial cell line). Other cell lines commonly used in viral diagnostic laboratories do not appear to support the replication of hMPV. Commercial reagents to confirm the presence of hMPV are not yet available.

To complicate matters, pharyngitis and sinusitis can also be caused by bacterial infections.

Determination of the aetiology of virus infections becomes increasingly essential with the introduction of new antivirals. The optional use of these new therapeutic options is problematic because all these drugs are virus specific. Some therapies are initiated on the basis of a presumptive diagnosis; a specific diagnosis may be important to confirm the initial impression and to determine the length of time for treatment.

IFA can be divided into direct and indirect methods. Direct immunofluorescence utilises a fluorochrome-labelled antibody that is specific to viral proteins or antigens. It involves fixing the specimens containing viral materials onto a slide so that virus-specific monoclonal antibody labelled with the fluorochrome can bind to the antigen. Following the addition of a substrate, a colour change with the fluoro-chrome can be induced, which in turn can be detected by a fluorescence microscope. Indirect immunofluoroscence uses an unlabelled monoclonal antibody that binds to the viral antigen. It is then washed away, and any bound monoclonal antibody is detected with a labelled anti-mouse antibody. The use of multiple antibodies can, in theory, improve the sensitivity of the detection because multiple conjugate molecules can attach to virus-specific antibodies. ELISA is very similar to IFA; however, instead of using a fluorescent label, an enzyme label is used. This assay utilises a double antibody sandwich. A 'capture' antibody specific for the viral antigen being sought is bound to a reaction surface. When the specimen or viral antigen is added, it binds to the capture antibody. Bound antigen is detected by a second antiviral antibody, the 'detector' antibody. This detector antibody carries an enzyme label and, once bound, this enzyme produces a colour change. This colour change can be detected by photometry. The disadvantages of ELISA are that it is usually less sensitive and the reagents are only available for a limited number of viruses. In addition, adults tend to have lower viral titres in nasopharyngeal aspirates, making the sensitivity of this test understandably lower.",

They are now even more important when it comes to determining the immune status of an individual or to evaluating the immune response to vaccination. Serum is the specimen of choice for serological diagnosis and paired serum specimens 4 weeks apart are required for the diagnosis of current or recent viral infections. Demonstration of a seroconversion from a negative to a positive IgG antibody response or detection of the presence of virus-specific IgM can be diagnostic of primary viral infection. A fourfold increase in IgG titres between acute and convalescent sera (usually 4 weeks apart) may indicate a recent infection due to reinfection or reactivation; yet, such testing is retrospective and has little impact on a patient's immediate care. In addition, the result of serological tests for viral-specific antibodies must be interpreted with care for a number of reasons. First, there may be a delay or lack of production of serum antibodies, especially in the immunocompromised. Second, in recurrent infections, a significant rise in antibodies may not be apparent. Third, antibody levels can remain elevated for a long period of time following infection. Therefore, the clinical status of the patient has to be taken into account.",

Therefore, in the case of nucleic acid detection, the integrity of the specimen itself is not so important, whereas in the case of tissue culture, the whole virus is often required. Respiratory viruses possess either RNA or DNA, but not both. It is, therefore, essential to know the structure of each individual virus in order to develop molecular techniques identifying nucleic acid. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has dramatically altered the detection and characterisation of viral nucleic acids. It can identify target organisms from specimens with low concentrations of nuclear material in a matter of a few hours. For DNA viruses, PCR amplification is straightforward; the principle is demonstrated in Fig. 1 . However, for RNA viruses, the genome is too unstable to be used in PCR, and RNA has to be converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) using reverse transcriptase, a retroviral enzyme that makes a precise copy of the mRNA. PCR is then performed in the normal manner to amplify genomic material. Once DNA has been amplified, it can be detected on the basis of size by gel electrophoresis or by Southern blotting, where the resolved nucleic acids are transferred to a membrane and react with nucleic acid probes specific for the desired PCR product.",

The process takes place at 41 jC and results in exponential amplification of products within 2 h, producing single-stranded RNA of opposite sense to the original target.

Nasal decongestants improve cold symptoms in adults and improve nasal patency in children; however, their side effects, such as rebound obstruction and nasal epithelial drying, have impeded their use [90] . First-generation antihistamines have shown favourable effects upon nasal symptoms in adult studies, probably because of their anticholinergic effects [91] . Topical application of ipratropium (an anticholinergic drug) at a moderate dose, which is minimally absorbed across biologic membranes, reduces rhinorrhoea and sneezing in colds [92] . The routine use of cough medications in healthy children and adults should pose no potential problem, but they should be used with caution in patients with chronic obstructive airway disease. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been shown to reduce symptoms in rhinovirus infections [93] by reducing fever, headache, sore throat and cough. This may be because prostaglandins are amongst the inflammatory mediators responsible in the pathogenesis of rhinovirus colds. Intranasal interferon alone is not a practical treatment option for the common cold; however, when it is used in combination with ipratropium and a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, it can significantly reduce symptoms in experimental colds [94] .",
