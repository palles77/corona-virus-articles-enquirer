The benzyl-substituted derivative showed antiviral activity in between the methyl (most active) and ethyl (least active) derivatives. Also, replacement of the methyl by a hydroxymethyl (9e) annihilated the anti-DNA virus activity. Substitution of the adenine nucleobase in 9a by uracil (16a), thymine (15a) or cytosine (18) resulted in lower cystostatic effects but also in a virtually complete loss of antiviral potency.",

Its antiretroviral activity was in the same concentration range as PMEA (adefovir) (EC 50 : 7.4 \u00b1 1.7 lM for HIV-1 and 7.0 \u00b1 1.1 lM for HIV-2). However, the cystostatic activity of 9a in CEM cells (CC 50 = 20 \u00b1 6.3 lM) may account for the anti-HIV activity observed and thus, the observed anti-HIV activity might not be due to a direct inhibition of virus replication, but rather an indirect cellular antimetabolic activity. Compound 9a also demonstrated a higher cystostatic activity against the cell cultures compared to compounds 9b and 9c. As observed for their cytostatic activity against human fibroblast HEL cell proliferation, when evaluated against murine leukemia cells (L1210), murine mammary carcinoma cells (FM3A) and human T-lymphocyte cells (CEM), 9a was far more cytostatic than 9b and 9c ( Table 2 ).",

Viral cytopathicity or plaque formation (VZV) was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. Antiviral activity was expressed as the EC 50 or compound concentration required to reduce virusinduced cytopathicity or viral plaque formation by 50%. The methodology of the anti-HIV assays was as follows: human CEM ($3 \u00c2 10 5 cells/ml) were infected with 100 CCID 50 of HIV-1(IIIB) or HIV-2(ROD)/ml and seeded in 200-lL-wells of a microtiter plate containing appropriate dilutions of the test compounds",
