            "text": "The terms psychoimmunology and psychoneuroimmunology define the emerging science devoted to studying the two-way relationship between the nervous system and the immune system. The accumulating evidence now strongly supports the concept that the brain and peripheral nervous system, either directly through neurotransmitters or indirectly through endocrine hormones, can modulate the function of immune cells such as lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, and macrophages. On the other hand, the cells of the immune system, through the mediation of released cytokines, can modulate the normal physiology and homeostasis of brain and endocrine systems. Because there is a direct relationship between the function of the immune system and resistance to infectious diseases, it is reasonable to suspect that alterations in the brain transmitted to the immune system would result in variations in host resistance to infectious diseases. Indeed, it has been observed and reported since ancient times that stressful situations in life are associated with unfavorable outcomes in patients suffering from infectious diseases and tumors. Many of us in our present day lives have witnessed and discussed this relationship between stress, immunity, and infections.",

            "text": "Stress to the nervous system is now viewed as emanating from a variety of sources. Events of day-to-day living, such as deadlines, bereavement, and perceived personal failure often lead to an individual's inability to cope with these challenges. The inability to cope results in psychological stress, resulting in an imbalance in the functioning of the central and peripheral nervous systems. In this case, the stress comes from within. Stress to the nervous system, however, can also come from the environment. Infections and other physical ailments can stress the nervous system, as can other environmental factors such as exercise and exposure to extremes of cold and heat. A form of environmental stress of particular relevance today is that induced by abusing psychoactive drugs, which can directly affect the nervous system. Because of their psychoactive nature, these agents can profoundly stress the normal homeostasis of the nervous system. The soluble mediators of the reciprocal communication between the nervous system and the immune system have been elucidated in some detail over the past several decades. Molecules originating from the central nervous system, such as endorphins, enkephalins, corticotropin-releasing factor, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone, can affect immune cell function and are produced and released by cells of the immune system. Peripheral (and central) nervous system agents, such as somatostatin, substance P, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and norepinephrine, can likewise modulate the function of cells involved in immunity and inflam-mation, as can endocrine hormones from the pituitary and adrenal glands. On the other hand, cytokines, such as IL-I, IL-3, IL-6, interferon, and tumor necrosis factor, which regulate immunity and inflammation, can also influence the homeostasis of the brain and endocrine organs.",

Men and women, ranging in age from 18 to 54 yr, were admitted into the study at the Medical Research Council's Common Cold Unit, Salisbury, England. Initially, subjects were given a complete medical examination and a series of questionnaires designed to assess behavior, psychological stress, personality, and health practices. Blood was drawn for baseline respiratory virus antibody titers and groups of different subjects were infected by nasal drops with low infectious doses of the respiratory viruses--rhinovirus types 2, 9, 14, respiratory syncytial virus, and coronavirus type 229E. Following infection, the subjects were quarantined for up to 7 d, during which time they were examined daily by a clinician to observe and record symptoms of respiratory infection. Nasal wash samples were collected for virus isolation. Approximately 28 d after challenge, a second convalescent serum sample was collected. The psychological stress questionnaires measured the number of major stressful life events, the ability of the individual to cope, and an index of current negative affect. From these measurements, a stress index that ranged from 3 to 12 was formulated and used as an indicator of the degree of psychological stress experienced by the subjects. Laboratory and clinical assessment data were combined to yield profiles for either infected individuals or subjects with clinical colds. The results from this remarkable study showed that the rates of both respiratory infections and clinical colds increased in accordance with an increase in the stress index. For example, the infection rate at a low stress index was 74%, whereas the rate at a high index was 90%. Likewise, the rate of clinical colds was 27% at the low index and 47% at the high. Lifestyle factors such as age, sex, smoking, alcohol, exercise, and diet were excluded as contributors to the association between stress and illness. Although previous studies in humans pointed to a relationship between slress and alterations of immune cell functions (8) , the report by Cohen and another by Glaser et al. (9) are among the first to suggest a strong correlation between stressful life situations and increased susceptibility to infection.",

            "text": "The bulk of existing literature conceruing the effects of stress on resistance to infection has been obtained from animal infection models and stressors, such as forced exercise, avoidance learning, restraint, isolation, and cold. The literature was recently reviewed by Peterson et al. (5) , wherein a variety of animal models and viral and bacterial infections were discussed. The majority of these studies involved use of the relatively simple experimental paradigm of stressing animals in various ways and then recording mortality following infection with a variety of microorganisms. Infections with human viruses, such as polio, coxsackie virus, herpes simplex, influenza, rabies, and coronavirus were reported to result in greater mortality or pathogenesis in stressed experimental animals, such as mice, monkeys, and swine (5). Similaxly, increased mortality was also reported in response to bacterial pathogens such as Bacillus anthracis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Interestingly, however, increased survival was noted with other bacterial infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae, E. coli, and M. tuberculosis. It can be concluded from these results that stressing experimental animals physiologically (i.e., forced exercise, cold, crowding, and surgery) reproducibly alters susceptibility to a challenge infection with viral and bacterial pathogens. However, it is also clear that currently there is little understanding of the changes in immune and neuroendocrine function responsible for the altered susceptibility.",

(10) studied the development of selected cellular immune functions in restraint-stressed mice simultaneously infected in the footpad with herpes simplex virus (HS V) type 1. They observed that the numbers of lymphocytes, the lymphocyte proliferation responses, as well as the generation of HSV-specific CTLs and NK cells, were depressed in restrained mice receiving a footpad injection of HSV. In addition, the depressed cellular immunity coincided with a higher titer of infectious virus at the site of infection. In a similar study, Sheridan et al. (11) observed a reduced pulmonary mononuclear cell infiltrate and lung consolidation along with elevated levels of plasma corticosterone in stressed mice infected intranasally with influenza virus. In addition, lymphocytes obtained from these animals were deficient in IL-2 production when cultured with viral antigens. Interestingly, however, the antiviral IgG antibody response in stressed animals was similar to that in controls. These two reports show a strong correlation between immune dysfunction and the progression of viral pathogenesis, and the authors speculate that the link between the physiological stress and immune dysfunction might be mediated by alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal axis.",

As with immune assessment following treatment with other drugs of abuse, relatively few studies are designed to examine THC effects on resislance to challenge infection. Cabral et al. (36) reported on an infection model employing guinea pigs and HSV type 2. Animals were given daily doses of THC in amounts ranging from 0.2 to 25 mg/kg. On the second day following the beginning of the drug treatment, the guinea pigs were infected intravaginally with sublethal amounts of HSV-2 and then observed for virus shedding, lesion expression, and morbidity and mortality. The frequency of vaginal lesion expression and the mortality was observed to be higher in THC-treated guinea pigs than in control animals. Virus shedding in the vagina was also increased in drug-treated guinea pigs (36) murine FLV and HSV type 1 (37) .",

The combination treatment of FLV, HSV, and THC caused enhanced mortality relative to FLy infection only or FLV combined with THC. Interestingly, the combination of FLV and HSV seemed to enhance the survival of the mice over FLV only. This study points out the potential cofactor effect of underlying virus infection and drug treatment which is a common problem in drug-abusing individuals. The cellular mechanisms responsible for the enhanced susceptibility to viral infections in these models may be related to drug-induced suppression of NK activity (37) or a drug-induced decrease in the interferon ~/1~ response following virus challenge (38) .",

The 38 mg/kg dose of THC significantly suppressed the LDs0 dose of bacteria; however, maximum suppression occurred at drug doses in excess of 10 mg/kg.

            "text": "These studies with marijuana, as well as most studies examining the effects of drugs of abuse on resistance to infection, have emphasized how drugs affect resistance to primary infection. However, it is widely appreciated that secondary or anamnestic immune responses to infection are as important, if not more imporlant, than the primary or initial immune response. The immune potential of animals (including humans) increases with age as a result of continuous exposure and re-exposure to potentially lethal microbial antigens. With these thoughts in mind, we decided to examine the influence of THC on the anamnestic or secondary response in mice infected with Legionella pneumophila. We selected a THC dose of 5 mg/kg, which has some relevance to the human experience (41, 42) . The mice were first injected intraperitoneally with a sublethal dose of L. pneumophila (8x106), followed 3 wk later by a lethal challenge dose (4x107) (Fig. 1) . Drugtreated groups were injected with THC either 24 h before or 24 h after the primary L. pneumophila infection or with the drug vehicle (DMSO) or saline at these times. Under these conditions, none of the animals died at the time of the primary infection (data not shown). Furthermore, less than 20% of the animals died following challenge with a lethal dose when previously primed with a sublethal dose and injected with either DMSO or saline (Fig. 2) . This indicates that the mice developed an anamnestic protective response following the primary infection. However, the mortality increased to around 80% if the primary infection was followed 24 h later by a single injection of THC (Fig. 2) . If the primary infection was preceded by a THC injection, there was no drug effect on mortality. These results suggest that THC may have subtle and insidious effects on immune function, such as the suppression of the anamnestic response. This drug effect may prevent the long-term accumulation of enhanced immunity to various infectious agents. It is also of interest that this immune memory infection model demonstrates drug effects at doses not active on primary infection, suggesting the memory model is more sensitive for detecting THC effects.",

It now appears that drugs of abuse such as morphine and marijuana, when administered at high doses, might serve as harmful cofactors when combined with the endogenous release of inflammatory cytokines during the course of infection. Chronic drug administration, however, might depress cellular immune function (including decreased cytokine production) and contribute to harmful effects in the host. Much is known concerning the modulation of immune function by stress and drugs of abuse. However, much remains to be learned about the relevance of this immunomodulation to host susceptibility to infections.",

Over the next 2\u00bd yr she received hydroxyurea, myleran, low-dose cytosine arabinoside, alpha-interferon, and anagrelide to control her disease. Thrombocytosis proved difficult to control and she required occasional platelet-pheresis to control symptomatic erythromelalgia. She also had chronic obstructive airway disease and was a two-pack-per-day smoker. In August 1989 during treatment with interferon, she developed low-grade fever, chills, weight loss, night sweats, and increasing shortness of breath. In October 1989 she was found to have right middle-lobe pneumonia. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy was noted on chest CT, but needle biopsy of the nodes demonstrated only hyperplasia. The right middle lobe was resected and was negative for malignancy. Routine culture and acid-fast smears were negative. CT of the abdomen showed multiple low-density areas in the spleen. Aspiration needle biopsy of the spleen was negative on routine culture. Bone marrow biopsy showed increased cellularity consistent with CML. Six weeks later all of these cultures (right middle lobe, mediastinal lymph node, bone marrow, and splenic puncture fluid) grew acid-fast organisms that were identified as MAC using an RNA-directed DNA probe (Gen Probe, San Diego, CA). She was started on rifampin",
