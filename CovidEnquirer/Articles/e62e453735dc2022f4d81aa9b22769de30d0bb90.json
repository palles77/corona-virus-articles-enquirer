People are eager to know when the epidemic will be completely controlled and when people's work and life will be on the right track. In this study we analyzed the epidemic dynamics and trend of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan by using the data after the closure of Wuhan city till February 12, 2020 based on the SEIR modeling method. The optimal parameters were estimated as R 0 =1.44 (interquartile range: 1.40-1.47)\uff0cTI=14 (interquartile range: 14-14) and TE=3.0 (interquartile range: 2.8-3.",

The first stage is from January 23 to February 7, and the second stage is from February 8 to February 12. During the second stage, Wuhan city took a number of measures, including timely diagnosis, timely treatment and effective isolation of the infected population, which will have an important impact on the parameters of the model. To establish the model, we firstly estimated the parameters of the susceptible (S), the exposed (E), the infected (I) and the recovery(R) based on the latest data issued on S=N\u2500I, in which S is the number of the susceptible and I is the number of the infected.

The results showed that the number of infected people increased slowly in the early stage (January 22january 31), but during February 1-February 12, the number of infected people increased rapidly, which is expected to peak around February 19, reaching about 45000 people. Subsequently, the number of infections will decrease. Once entering March, the epidemic would gradually decline, and the epidemic would end around the end of March. It is worth noting that the above prediction is based on the assumption that the number of susceptible population N = 200000 will not increase.Fig3. Epidemic trend of 2019-nCoV within 90 days after the closure of Wuhan In Figure 3 and Figure 4, red line indicates the trend of cumulative infection number over time, blue line is the trend of cumulative rehabilitation number over time, and green line is the trend of cumulative latent number over time. Vertical dash line indicates the peak time of cumulative infection number. Fig4. Epidemic trend of 2019-nCoV within 90 days after the closure of Wuhan city assuming the number of susceptible people n = 300000 (A) and 400000 (B)If the epidemic situation is not properly controlled, the number of susceptible population will continue to increase on the basis of current N = 200000. If the number of susceptible population increases to N = 300000, and other parameters remain unchanged, the peak number can increase to 75000, and the epidemic peak time will also be postponed at around February 21(Figure 4). If it is increased to N = 400000 and other parameters remain unchanged, the peak number can be increased to 100000, and the epidemic peak will be postponed to around February 22(Figure 4). Even in both cases, the epidemic would subside in early March, and disappear gradually towards the late March. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",
