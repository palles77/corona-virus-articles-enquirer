We have investigated the secretion of these hormones in schizophrenic patients to assess these claims of diagnostic specificity.",

I However, rotavirus infection in the newborn is frequently symptomless.

However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the incidence may have been higher in other years or in term newborns older than 5 days of age. weakness, fatigue, aches, and cramps, often worsened by exercise; sometimes creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels are moderately raised but muscle is histologically normal. The diagnosis is established by histochemical and biochemical demonstration of the enzyme deficiency in skeletal muscle, erythrocyte adenylate deaminase being normallo MAD probably plays a role in the maintenance of a high level of ATP during muscular activity, ensuring that a large energy charge is available for contraction.\" l Because of a finding of low ATP levels in skeletal muscle and a slow repletion of ATP in a patient with MAD deficiency investigated by me and mycolleagues 12 I have attempted to prevent this depletion by giving D-ribose. The rationale is that adenine nucleotide biosynthesis is limited by the flow through the hexose monophosphate shunt, and that this limitation can be overcome by ribose or other pentoses or pentilols. Ribose, which bypasses the hexose monophosphate shunt, is immediately converted to ribose-5phosphate thus enlarging the available pool of 5-phosphoribosyl-lpyrophosphate, an essential precursor for the biosynthesis of adenine nucleotides. As a result, adenine nucleotide synthesis is enhanced. D-ribose increases the synthesis of and prevents, in rats, the diminution of adenine nucleotides which is characteristic of the action of high doses of isoproterenol. 13 This institute's committee on human experimentation approved the administration of ribose.",

The ribose, on optical rotation and paper chromatographic criteria, was authentic D-ribose. Gelatin capsules containing 470 mg D-ribose or sucrose were given four times daily for four days.
