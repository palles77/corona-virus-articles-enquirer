Moreover, the present findings indicate that the difference in susceptibility of /3 cells observed in uiuo is retained under in vitro cultivation conditions. Blocks at any one of several sites in the viral cycle (e.g., attachment, uncoating, or replication) could account for the observed differences in susceptibility. In the case of the picornaviruses, it is known that only certain cell types have receptors for these viruses (U-131, and differences in the concentration of these receptors could influence the susceptibility of the various organs within the host. Our experiments with the M variant of EMC virus showed that more of this virus attached to /3 cells from mice that developed diabetes @IL/J) than to p cells from mice that did not develop diabetes (C57BLKJ). In contrast, no difference in attachment was observed when other cell types (e.g., kidney, embryonic fibroblast, pancreatic fibroblast) from these two strains of mice were tested. These findings are compatible with earlier observations which showed differences in viral replication in P-cell cultures but not kidney or embryo cultures, when SWFVJ and C57BL&I mice were compared (8) . In this connection, it is known that some viruses can grow in monolayer cultures derived from organs duplicate or triplicate determinations were made. Panels a, c, e, and g: Attachment of 3H-labeled virus to SJL/J cells which in the host are ordinarily resistant to these viruses. The development of susceptibility in culture presumably is due to induction of receptors (11, 12, 14, 15 ). It appears, however, that at least in the case of our p-cell system, differences among strains in susceptibility to the M variant of EMC virus persist in culture. A significant difference in the attachment of EMC virus was observed only when attachment was assayed by infectivity. The failure to demonstrate any difference when radioactivity was measured may in part be explained by the fact that the assay for 3H-labeled virus detects both defective particles and virus particles which have eluted from the cell and have lost their infectivity (10, (16) (17) (18) . Other investigators have reported results similar to our findings: Viral attachment (e.g., poliovirus type 1, rhinovirus-14, and human coronavirus) when measured by radioactivity may give lower values than when measured by infectivity (10,18; K. Holmes, personal communication).",

Recent immunofluorescence studies on sections of pancreas from several strains of mice inoculated with EMC virus but resistant to the development of diabetes (i.e., C57BL/6J, CBA/J, AKR, and A/J) revealed a considerable difference in the number of p cells that became infected (19) . Although neither C57BL/6J nor CBA/J mice developed diabetes when inoculated with EMC virus, approximately 12% of the /3 cells from C57BL/6J mice contained viral antigens at 72 hr after inoculation, as compared to 3% of the p cells from CBA/J mice (19) . The fact that so few CBA/J p cells became infected suggested that it might be possible to detect even greater differences in viral attachment if the /3 cells from this strain were compared with /3 cells from the susceptible SJL/J strain. Recent experiments using these two strains showed that three to four times more virus attached to SJL/J cells than to CBA/J /3 cells (unpublished data).",

Our cultures usually contained about 65% /3 cells, but it is still not technically possible to obtain large quantities of /3 cells which are absolutely free of other pancreatic cells (e.g., fibroblasts, ductal cells, or acinar cells). Moreover, certain cell types (e.g., Fig. 2 , pancreatic fibroblasts) may bind more virus than p cells. Thus, the greater binding of EMC virus to non-p cells that contaminate the enriched cultures may have obscured an even larger difference in the specific binding of EMC virus to p cells than the apparent twofold difference observed in our studies.",
