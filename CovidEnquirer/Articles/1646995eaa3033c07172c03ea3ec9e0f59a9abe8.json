Infection refers to the invasion and multiplication of microorganisms in body tissues and may occur with or without apparent disease. Disease refers to interruption or deviation from normal structure and function of any tissue, organ, or system. Many of the infections with which we are concerned may not cause discernable disease in many strains of mice. However, they may cause inapparent or subclinical changes that can interfere with research. Such interference often remains undetected, and therefore modified results may be obtained and published.",

            "text": "The types of interference of an agent with experimental results may be diverse. There is no doubt that research complications due to overt infectious disease are significant and that animals with clinical signs of disease should not be used for scientific experiments. But also clinically inapparent infections may have severe effects on animal experiments. There are numerous examples of influences of microorganisms on host physiology and hence of the interference of inapparent infections with the results of animal experiments. Many microorganisms have the potential to induce activation or suppression of the immune system or both at the same time but on different parts of the immune system, regardless of the level of pathogenicity. All infections, apparent or inapparent, are likely to increase inter-individual variability and hence result in increased numbers of animals necessary to obtain reliable results. Microorganisms, in particular viruses, present in an animal may contaminate biological materials such as sera, cells, or tumours (Collins and Parker, 1972; Nicklas et al., 1993) . This may interfere with in vitro experiments conducted with such materials and may also lead to contamination of animals (Lipman et al., polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of biologics to be inoculated into mice is an important component of a disease prevention programme. Finally, latent infections may be activated by environmental factors, by experimental procedures, or by the combination and interaction between various microorganisms. For all these reasons, prevention of infection, not merely prevention of clinical disease, is essential.",

Viral infections of mice have been studied in detail, and comprehensive information on their pathogenic potential, their impact on research, and the influence of host factors such as age, genotype, and immune status on the response to infection is available. Bacterial agents may be similarly important, but with few exceptions (e.g. Helicobacter species) little is known about their potential to influence host physiology and experiments. Even less is known about most parasites in this regard. Among fungal agents, only Pneumocystis carinii can be expected to play a significant role in contemporary mouse colonies. The nomenclature and taxonomy of viruses described are based on recent nomenclature rules by the International Union of Microbiological Societies (2000) and the Universal Virus Database of the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (http://www.ictvdb.iacr.ac.uk). Retroviruses are not covered in this chapter because they are not included in routine health surveillance programmes and cannot be eradicated with presently available methods. This is because most of them are incorporated in the mouse genome as proviruses and thus are transmitted via germline.",

Most viral infections in immunocompetent mice are acute or short-term, and lesions are often subtle or subclinical.

However, clinical signs, altered behaviour, or lesions may be the first indicator of an infection and often provide clues for further investigations.",

            "text": "Serology is the primary means of testing mouse colonies for exposure to viruses, largely because serological tests are sensitive and specific, are relatively inexpensive, and allow screening for a multitude of agents with one serum sample. They are also employed to monitor biological materials for viral contamination using the MAP test. Serological tests detect specific antibodies, usually immunoglobulin G (IgG), produced by the host against the virus and do not actually test for the presence of virus. An animal may have been infected, mounted an effective antibody response, and cleared the virus, but remains seropositive for weeks or months or forever, even though it is no longer infected or shedding the agent. Active infection can only be detected by using direct diagnostic methods such as virus isolation, electron microscopy, or PCR. Meanwhile, PCR assays have been established for the detection of almost every agent of interest. They are highly sensitive and depending on the demands, they can be designed to broadly detect all members of a genus or only one species. However, good timing and selection of the appropriate specimen is critical for establishing the diagnosis. In practice, combinations of diagnostic tests are often necessary including the use of sentinel animals or immunosuppression to get clear aetiological results or to avoid consequences from false-positive results.",

            "text": "Reports on the prevalence of viral infections in laboratory mice throughout the world have been published frequently. In general, the microbiological quality of laboratory mice has constantly improved during the last decades, and several agents (e.g. herpes-and polyomaviruses) have been essentially eliminated from contemporary colonies due to advances in diagnostic methodologies and modern husbandry and rederivation practices (Jacoby and Lindsey, 1998; Zenner and Regnault, 2000; Livingston and Riley, 2003) . They may, however, reappear, since most have been retained or are still being used experimentally. Furthermore, the general trend towards better microbiological quality is challenged by the increasing reliance of biomedical research on genetically modified and immunodeficient mice, whose responses to infection and disease can be unpredictable. Increasing numbers of scientists are creating genetically modified mice, with minimal or no awareness of infectious disease issues. As a consequence, they are more frequently infected than 'standard' strains of mice coming from commercial breeders, and available information on their health status is often insufficient. Frequently, they are exchanged between laboratories, which amplifies the risk of introducing infections from a range of animal facilities. Breeding cessation strategies that have been reported to eliminate viruses from immunocompetent mouse colonies may prove to be costly and ineffective in genetically modified colonies of uncertain or incompetent immune status. It must also be expected that new agents will be detected, although only occasionally. Infections therefore remain a threat to biomedical research, and users of laboratory mice must be cognizant of infectious agents and the complications they can cause.",

In a more recent study, a low rate (0.1%) of samples was found to be positive for MCMV-1 whereas no sample tested positive for MTV (Livingston and Riley, 2003) .

These results are very difficult to summarize because the outcome of experimental infection in laboratory mice depends on various factors such as mouse strain and age, virus strain and passage history, virus dose, and route of inoculation (Osborn, 1982) . In general, newborn mice are most susceptible to clinical disease and to lethal infection. Virus replication is observed in newborn mice in many tissues (for details, see Osborn, 1982) and appears in the salivary glands towards the end of the first week of infection when virus concentrations in liver and spleen have already declined. Resistance develops rapidly after weaning between days 21 and 28 of age. Experimental infection of adult mice results in mortality only in susceptible strains and only if high doses are administered. Not even intravenous or intraperitoneal injections of adult mice usually produce signs of illness in resistant strains (Shanley et al., 1993) . Mice of the H-2 b (e.g. C57BL/6) and H-2 d (e.g. BALB/c) haplotype are more sensitive to experimental infection than are mice of the H-2 k haplotype (e.g. C3H), which are approximately 10-fold more resistant to mortality than are those of the b or d haplotype (Osborn, 1986) .",

Immunodeficient mice lacking functional T cells or natural killer (NK) cells, such as Foxn1 nu and Lyst bg mice, are more susceptible than are immunocompetent animals. Experimental infection in Prkdc scid mice causes severe disease or is lethal, with necrosis in spleen, liver, and other organs, and multinucleate syncytia with inclusion bodies in the liver (Reynolds et al., 1993) . Similar to AIDS patients infected with human cytomegalovirus, athymic Foxn1 nu mice experimentally infected with MCMV also develop adrenal necrosis (Shanley and Pesanti, 1986) . The virus also replicates in the lungs leading to pneumonitis whereas in heterozygous (Foxn1 nu / \u03e9 ) littermates replication and disease are not seen (Shanley et al., 1997) .",

            "text": "Natural infections manifest differently depending on many factors. Mousepox may occur as a rapidly spreading outbreak with acute disease and deaths, or may be inconspicuous with slow spreading and mild clinical signs. The mortality rate can be very low in populations in which the virus has been present for long periods. The infection usually takes one of three clinical courses: acute asymptomatic infection, acute lethal infection (systemic form), or subacute to chronic infection (cutaneous form ; Fenner, 1981 Fenner, , 1982 Manning and Frisk, 1981; National Research Council, 1991; Dick et al., 1996) . The systemic or visceral form is characterized clinically by facial oedema, conjunctivitis, multisystemic necrosis, and usually high mortality. This form is less contagious than the cutaneous form because the animals die before there is virus shedding. The cutaneous form is characterized by typical dermal lesions and variable mortality. The outcome of infection depends on many factors including strain and dose of virus; route of viral entry; strain, age, and sex of mouse; husbandry methods; and duration of infection in the colony. While all mouse strains seem to be susceptible to infection with ECTV, clinical signs and mortality are strain-dependent (Fenner, 1982; Wallace and Buller, 1985, 1986; Brownstein et al., 1989b) . Acute lethal (systemic) infection occurs in highly susceptible inbred strains such as DBA/1, DBA/2, BALB/c, A, and C3H/HeJ. Immunodeficient mice may also be very susceptible (Allen et al., 1981) . Outbreaks among susceptible mice can be explosive, with variable morbidity and high mortality (\u03fe80%). Clinical disease may not be evident in resistant strains such as C57BL/6 and AKR, and the virus can be endemic in a population for long periods before being recognized. Furthermore, females seem to be more resistant to disease than males, at least in certain strains of mice Brownstein et al., 1989b) .",

It escapes into the blood (primary viraemia) and infects splenic and hepatic macrophages resulting in necrosis of these organs and a massive secondary viraemia. This sequence takes approximately 1 week. Many animals die at the end of this stage without premonitory signs of illness; others develop varying clinical signs including ruffled fur, hunched posture, swelling of the face or extremities, conjunctivitis, and skin lesions (papules, erosions, or encrustations mainly on ears, feet, and tail; Figure 23 .1).

Occasionally, necrosis may also be observed in other organs such as ovaries, uterus, vagina, intestine, and lungs. The primary skin lesion, which occurs about a week after exposure at the site of inoculation (frequently on the head), is a localized swelling that enlarges from inflammatory oedema. Necrosis of dermal epithelium provokes a surface scab and heals as a deep, hairless scar. Secondary skin lesions (rash) develop 2-3 days later as the result of viraemia (Figure 23 .1). They are often multiple and widespread and can be associated with conjunctivitis. The skin lesions also can ulcerate and scab before scarring. Mucosal and dermal epithelial cells may have characteristic intracytoplasmic eosinophilic (Cowdry type A) inclusion bodies ( Figure  23 .4). Basophilic (Cowdry type B) inclusions may be found in the cytoplasm of all infected cells, especially in hepatocytes.",

Intrauterine transmission is possible at least under experimental conditions (Schwanzer et al., 1975) . Virus particles are shed from infected mice (mainly via scabs and/or faeces) for about 3-4 weeks, even though the virus can persist for months in the spleen of an occasional mouse (Bhatt and Jacoby, 1987b; National Research Council, 1991) .

            "text": "Various tests have been applied for the diagnosis of ectromelia. Previous epidemics were difficult to deal with because of limited published data and information on the biology of the virus and the lack of specific and sensitive assays (Wallace, 1981) . In the 1950s, diagnosis relied on clinical signs, histopathology, and animal passages of tissues from moribund and dead animals. Culture of the virus on the chorioallantoic membrane of embryonated eggs was also applied. Serology is currently the primary means of testing mouse colonies for exposure to ECTV. The methods of choice are ELISA and IFA; they are more sensitive and specific than the previously used haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay (Collins et al., 1981; Buller et al., 1983; ACLAD, 1991) . Both tests detect antibodies to orthopoxviruses and do not distinguish between ECTV and vaccinia virus. Vaccinia virus is commonly used as antigen for serological testing to avoid the risk of infection for mice. Thus, false-positive serological reactions may be found after experimental administration of replication-competent vaccinia virus. It has been shown that even cage contact sentinels may develop antibodies, and vaccinia virus leading to seroconversion may even be transmitted by dirty bedding (Gaertner et al., 2003) . Confirmation of positive serological results is important before action is taken because vaccinia virus is increasingly prevalent in animal facilities as a research tool (e.g. for vaccination or gene therapy). As observed in different outbreaks, serological testing is of little value in the initial stages of the disease. For example, in the outbreak described by Dick et al. (1996) depopulation was nearly completed before serological confirmation was possible. For this reason, negative serological results should be confirmed by direct detection methods (PCR, immunohistochemistry, virus isolation) or by histopathology, especially when clinical cases suggestive of mousepox are observed. Polymerase chain reaction assays to detect different genes of poxviruses in infected tissues have been described by Dick et al. (1996) , Neubauer et al. (1997) , and Lipman et al. (2000b) .",

All institutions that must introduce mice from other than commercial barrier facilities should have a health surveillance programme and test incoming mice. Perhaps even more important than living animals are samples from mice (tumours, sera, tissues). The virus replicates in lymphoma and hybridoma cell lines (Buller et al., 1987) , and such cells or material derived from them may therefore be a vehicle for inadvertent transfer between laboratories. The last two published outbreaks of ectromelia were both introduced into the facilities by mouse serum (Dick et al., 1996; Lipman et al., 2000b) . Lipman et al. (2000b) found that the contaminated serum originated from a pooled lot of 43 l that had been imported from China. Because mouse serum commonly is sold to the end user in small aliquots (few millilitres), it has to be expected that aliquots of the contaminated lot are still stored in numerous freezers. Both cases provide excellent examples of why MAP or PCR testing should be performed on all biological materials to be inoculated into mice.",

Several studies indicate that mousepox is not highly contagious Bhatt and Jacoby 1987a,b ) and that it may be self-limiting when adequate husbandry methods are applied. Therefore, strict quarantine procedures along with cessation of breeding (to permit resolution of infection) and frequent monitoring with removal of clinically sick and seropositive animals are a potential alternative.

After vaccination, typical pocks develop at the vaccination site, and infectious vaccinia virus is detectable in spleen, liver, lungs, and thymus (Jacoby et al., 1983) . Vaccination also causes seroconversion so that serological tests are not applicable for health surveillance in vaccinated populations.

Occasional reports of mice with lesions suggestive of adenovirus infections and negative serology (with MAdV-1) indicate that the infection may not be detected if only one virus is used as antigen (Luethans and Wagner, 1983) . It has therefore become standard practice to test sera for antibodies to both MAdV-1 and MAdV-2.

Murine pneumotropic virus (MPtV) has formerly been known as 'newborn mouse pneumonitis virus' or 'K virus' (named after L. Kilham who first described the virus). The second is murine polyomavirus (MPyV). Both are related but antigenically distinct from each other (Bond et al., 1978) . They are enzootic in many populations of wild mice but are very uncommon in laboratory mice. Even older reports indicate that both have been eradicated from the vast majority of contemporary mouse colonies, and their importance is negligible (National Research Council, 1991) . Seropositivity to these viruses was not reported in a survey conducted in the USA (Jacoby and Lindsey, 1998) . In a retrospective study in French facilities, antibodies to MPyV were found in 1 of 69 colonies, and all samples tested for MPtV were negative (Zenner and Regnault, 2000) . Comparable data were reported by Livingston and Riley (2003) . Due to their low prevalence, both viruses are not included in the list of agents for which testing is recommended on a regular basis by FELASA (Nicklas et al., 2002) .",

It has later been shown to be a frequent contaminant of transplantable tumours (Collins and Parker, 1972) . Natural infection of mice is subclinical, and gross lesions including tumours are usually not found. Tumour formation occurs if mice are experimentally infected at a young age or if they are inoculated with high virus doses. Development of tumours may be preceded by multifocal necrosis and mortality during the viraemic stage (Percy and Barthold, 2001) . Parotid, salivary gland, and mammary tumours are common, and sarcomas or carcinomas of kidney, subcutis, adrenal glands, bone, cartilage, teeth, blood vessels, and thyroid occur also. Virus strains vary with regard to the tumour types or lesions that they induce, and mouse strains vary in their susceptibility to different tumour types. Those of C57BL and C57Br/cd lineage are considered to be the most resistant strains; athymic Foxn1 nu mice are considered to be most susceptible; C3H mice are particularly susceptible to adrenal tumours and A mice tend to develop bone tumours. Immunosuppression or inoculation into immunodeficient strains (e.g. Foxn1 nu ) also support the growth of tumours. On the other hand, experimental infection of adult immunocompetent mice does not result in tumour formation because the immune response suppresses tumour growth, and newborn immunocompetent mice develop runting only if inoculated with high virus doses (Atencio et al., 1995) .",

Murine parvoviruses are members of the family Parvoviridae, genus Parvovirus. They are remarkably resistant to environmental conditions like heat, desiccation, acidic and basic pH-values. Two distinct serotypes infect laboratory mice: the mice minute virus (MMV) and the mouse parvovirus 1 (MPV). Nonstructural proteins (NS-1 and NS-2) are highly conserved among both viruses whereas the capsid proteins (VP-1, VP-2, VP-3) are more divergent and determine the serogroup (Ball-Goodrich and Johnson, 1994) . Both viruses require mitotically active cells for replication. Severe infections are therefore not found in mature animals due to the lack of a sufficient number of susceptible cells in tissues. General aspects of rodent parvovirus infections and their potential effects on research results have been reviewed (Tattersall and Cotmore, 1986; National Research Council, 1991; Jacoby et al., 1996) .",

In contrast to many other viruses infecting mice, viral replication and excretion is not terminated by the onset of host immunity.

Neither the virion ELISA nor HI are practical screening tests for MPV because they require large quantities of purified MPV which is difficult to obtain. Diagnosis of MPV infections has long been made on the basis of an MMV HI-negative result coupled with an MMV IFApositive result. A generic rodent parvovirus ELISA using a recombinant NS-1 protein as antigen has been developed , but MPV IFA and MPV HI assays are more sensitive techniques than the NS-1 ELISA and the MMV IFA (Besselsen et al., 2000) . Recently, ELISA tests have been described that use recombinant VP-2 and provide sensitive and serogroupspecific assays for the diagnosis of MPV infections in mice (Ball-Goodrich et al., 2002; Livingston et al., 2002) . In immunodeficient mice that do not generate a humoral immune response, PCR assays can be used to detect MPV (Besselsen et al., 1995; Redig and Besselsen, 2001 ) and other parvoviruses. MPV has been shown to persist for at least 9 weeks in the mesenteric lymph nodes . This tissue is considered the best suited for PCR analysis, but spleen and small intestine can also be used with good success (Besselsen et al., 2000) . The virus persists sufficiently long in mesenteric lymph nodes so that PCR assays may also be used as a primary screening tool for laboratories that do not have access to specific MPV antigenbased serological assays. Polymerase chain reaction is further a good confirmatory method for serological assays and has also been described for the detection of parvoviruses in cell lines and tumours (Yagami et al., 1995) . In addition, the MAP test has been reported as a sensitive tool to detect MPV (Shek et al., 1998) .",

Kilham and Margolis (1970) observed mild growth retardation a few days after experimental infection of neonatal mice with MMVp. Studies of transplacental infection yielded no pathological findings in mice (Kilham and Margolis, 1971 ). The immunosuppressive variant but not the prototype strain is able to produce a runting syndrome after experimental infection of newborn mice (Kimsey et al., 1986) . Depending on the host genotype, experimental infections of foetal and neonatal mice with MMVi produce various clinical presentations and lesions. Infection in C57BL/6 mice is asymptomatic, but the virus causes lethal infections with intestinal haemorrhage in DBA/2 mice. Infection of strains such as BALB/c, CBA, C3H/He, and SJL is also lethal and mice have renal papillary haemorrhage (Brownstein et al., 1991) . The MMVi also infects haematopoietic stem cells and mediates an acute myelosuppression (Segovia et al., 1991 (Segovia et al., , 1995 . Due to their dependency on mitotically active tissues, the foetus is at particular risk for damage by parvoviruses. Mice minute virus and other parvoviruses may have severe teratogenic effects and cause foetal and neonatal abnormalities by destroying rapidly dividing cell populations, often resulting in foetal death. Adult Prkdc scid mice develop an acute leukopenia 1 month after experimental infection with MMVi and die within 3 months. The virus persists lifelong in the bone marrow of these mice (Segovia et al., 1999) .",

Haemagglutination inhibition is a highly specific diagnostic test whereas IFA always exhibits some degree of cross reactivity with MPV and other closely related parvoviruses. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is probably the most frequently used test, but depending on the purity of the antigen preparation, cross reactions with MPV may occur due to contamination with nonstructural proteins that are common to both viruses. This problem can be avoided by the use of recombinant VP-2 antigen (Livingston et al., 2002) . Viral detection is also possible by PCR in biological materials and in organs (intestines, kidney, spleen) from infected animals (Yagami et al., 1995; Chang et al., 1997; Redig and Besselsen, 2001) . In contrast to MPV, PCR is not appropriate as a confirmatory method for serology because MMV has not been shown to persist in immunocompetent animals for sufficiently long periods.",

As a consequence, the activity of plasma LDH begins to rise by only 24 h after infection and peaks 3-4 days after infection at 5-10-fold normal levels, or even be up to 20-fold in SJL/J mice.

Therefore, diagnosis of LDV infection is primarily based on increased LDH activity in serum or plasma of mice. Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus activity in serum or plasma can be measured directly, or samples (e.g. plasma, cell or organ homogenates) are inoculated into pathogen-free mice and the increase in LDH activity within 3-4 days is measured. An 8-10-fold increase is indicative of LDV infection. Detection of infectivity of a plasma sample by the induction of increased LDH activity in the recipient animal is the most reliable means of identifying an infected animal. However, it is important to use clear nonhaemolysed samples because haemolysis will (falsely) elevate activities of multiple serum or plasma enzymes, including LDH. While this assay may be included in a commercial 'MAP test', it does not involve antibody detection. Persistent infection makes LDV an ideal candidate for PCR detection in plasma or in organ homogenates (van der Logt et al., 1994; Chen and Plagemann, 1997) . However, reports exist that PCR may produce false-negative results and should be used cautiously (Lipman et al., 2000a) . Similarly important as detecting LDV in animals is its detection in biological materials. This may be done by assay for increased LDH activity after inoculation of suspect material into pathogen-free mice (Collins and Parker, 1972; Nicklas et al., 1993) or by PCR (Goto et al., 1998; Bootz and Sieber, 2002) .",

Its name refers to the condition that results from experimental intracerebral inoculation of the virus into adult mice and is not considered to be a feature of natural infections. Mice (Mus musculus) serve as the natural virus reservoir (Salazar-Bravo et al., 2002) , but Syrian hamsters are also important hosts (Ackermann, 1977) . Additional species such as rabbits, guinea pigs, squirrels, monkeys, and humans are susceptible to natural or experimental infection. Infection in hamsters is considered to be asymptomatic (National Research Council, 1991) . Natural infection of callitrichid primates (marmosets and tamarins) leads to a progressive hepatic disease that is known as 'callitrichid hepatitis' (Montali et al., 1995; Asper et al., 2001; Lukashevich et al., 2003) . Antibodies to LCMV have been found in wild mice in Europe (Ackermann et al., 1964) , Africa (El Karamany and Imam, 1991), Asia (Morita et al., 1991 (Morita et al., , 1996 , Australia , and America (Childs et al., 1992) . Thus, it is the only arenavirus with worldwide distribution. Infection with LCMV is rarely found in laboratory mice (Smith et al., 1984) . Seropositivity to LCMV was reported in approximately 5% of non-SPF mouse colonies in the USA in 1996 (Jacoby and Lindsey, 1998) and in 4% of French colonies in 1996-97 (Zenner and Regnault, 2000) . Recent studies confirm that only a small percentage of mice tested are positive for LCMV (Livingston and Riley, 2003) . In addition to laboratory mice and other vertebrate hosts, the virus has frequently been found in transplantable tumours and tissue culture cell lines from mice and hamsters (Bhatt et al., 1986a; Nicklas et al., 1993) .",

Two forms of natural LCMV infection are generally recognized: a persistent tolerant and an (acute) nontolerant form. The persistent form results from infection of mice that are immunotolerant. This is the case if mice are infected in utero or during the first days after birth. This form is characterized by lifelong viraemia and shedding. Mice may show growth retardation, especially during the first 3-4 weeks, but appear otherwise normal. Infectious virus is bound to specific antibodies and complement, and these complexes accumulate in the renal glomeruli, the choroid plexus, and sometimes also in synovial membranes and blood vessel walls. At 7-10 months of age, immune complex nephritis develops with ruffled fur, hunched posture, ascites, and occasional deaths. This immunopathological phenomenon is called 'late onset disease' or 'chronic immune complex disease'. The incidence of this type of disease varies between mouse strains. Gross lesions include enlarged spleen and lymph nodes due to lymphoid hyperplasia. Kidneys affected with glomerulonephritis may be enlarged with a granular surface texture or may be shrunken in later stages of the disease process. Microscopically, there is generalized lymphoid hyperplasia and immune complex deposition in glomeruli and vessel walls, resulting in glomerulonephritis and plasmacytic, lymphocytic perivascular cuffs in all visceral organs (Percy and Barthold, 2001) .",

However, virus may persist at low levels in tissues (particularly spleen, lung, and kidney) of mice for at least 12 weeks after infection as determined by sensitive assays such as nested reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or immunohistochemisty (Ciurea et al., 1999) .

Neurological signs usually appear on day 6 postinoculation, and animals die within 1-3 days after the onset of symptoms or recover within several days. The classic histological picture is of dense perivascular accumulations of lymphocytes and plasma cells in meninges and choroid plexus.

The virus can replicate in the gastric mucosa after intragastric infection (Rai et al., 1996 (Rai et al., , 1997 . Gastric inoculation elicits antibody responses of comparable magnitudes as intravenous inoculation and leads to active infection with LCMV indicating that oral infection is possible, e.g., by ingestion of contaminated food or cannibalism. A self-limiting infection frequently results from infection of adult mice. The virus does not spread rapidly after introduction in populations of adult mice, and the infectious chain usually ends.

Appropriate precautions have been defined for different BSLs or animal biology safety levels by CDC (1999) .",

They have a wide host range and are ubiquitous throughout the world. The designation reo stands for respiratory enteric orphan and reflects the original isolation of these viruses from human respiratory and intestinal tract without apparent disease. The term 'orphan' virus refers to a virus in search of a disease. Mammalian orthoreovirus can be grouped into three serotypes (1, 2, 3). Mammalian orthoreovirus-3 (synonyms: hepatoencephalomyelitis virus; ECHO 10 virus) infection remains prevalent in contemporary mouse colonies and has been reported in wild mice Barthold, 1997a) . Seropositivity to MRV-3 was found in less than 5% of SPF colonies and in approximately 20% of non-SPF mouse colonies in the USA in 1996 (Jacoby and Lindsey, 1998) . A study in France reported antibodies to MRV-3 in 9% of mouse colonies examined (Zenner and Regnault, 2000) . More recently, a study in North America found a low rate (0.2%) of mouse sera to be positive for antibodies against this virus (Livingston and Riley, 2003) . In addition, contamination of mouse origin tumours and cell lines by MRV-3 has been reported many times (National Research Council, 1991; Nicklas et al., 1993; Barthold, 1997a) . Experimentally, MRV-3 infection of infant mice has been used to model human hepatobiliary disease, pancreatitis, diabetes mellitus, and lymphoma (Kraft, 1982; National Research Council, 1991; Fenner et al., 1993) .",

After parenteral inoculation, virus can be recovered from the liver, brain, heart, pancreas, spleen, lymph nodes, and blood vessels. Following oral inoculation, reoviruses gain entry by infecting specialized epithelial cells (M cells) that overlie Peyer's patches. The virus then becomes accessible to leukocytes and spreads to other organs by way of the lymphatic system and the bloodstream.

The latter term has been used to describe the matted, unkempt appearance of the hair coat that results from steatorrhoea due to pancreatitis, maldigestion, and biliary atresia. In addition, runting (attributed to immune-mediated destruction of cells in the pituitary gland that produce growth hormone), transient alopecia, jaundice (due to excessive bilirubin in the blood, which is attributed to the liver pathology, especially biliary atresia), and neurological signs such as incoordination, tremors, or paralysis may develop. When present in natural infections, clinical signs and lesions are similar to but milder than in experimental neonatal infections. Early descriptions of naturally occurring disease may have been complicated by concurrent infections such as MHV or murine rotavirus A (MuRV-A)/epizootic diarrhoea of infant mice (EDIM) virus that contributed to the severity of the lesions especially in liver, pancreas, CNS, and intestine. The outcome of MRV-3 infection depends on age and immunological status of mouse, dose of virus, and route of inoculation. Adult immunocompetent mice typically show no clinical signs and have no discernible lesions even in experimental infections. Mucosal and maternally conferred immunity are considered to be important in protection from or resolution of disease (Cuff et al., 1990; Barthold et al., 1993b) . Experimental infection of adult Prkdc scid mice is lethal (George et al., 1990) .

They are surrounded by an envelope with a corona of surface projections (spikes). Murine hepatitis virus is antigenically related to rat coronaviruses and other coronaviruses of pigs, cattle, and humans. Numerous different strains or isolates of MHV have been described. They can be distinguished by neutralization tests that detect strain-specific spike (S) antigens. The best studied strains are the prototype strains MHV-1, MHV-2, MHV-3, JHM (MHV-4), A59, and S, of which MHV-3 is regarded as the most virulent. Murine hepatitis virus, like other coronaviruses, mutates rapidly, and strains readily form recombinants, so that new (sub)strains are constantly evolving. Strains vary in their virulence, organotropism, and cell tropism (Homberger, 1997) . Based on their primary organotropism, MHV strains can be grouped into two biotypes: respiratory (or polytropic) and enterotropic. However, intermediate forms (enterotropic strains with tropism to other organs) exist. Murine hepatitis virus is relatively resistant to repeated freezing and thawing, heating (56\u040aC for 30 min), and acid pH but is sensitive to drying and disinfectants, especially those with detergent activity (National Research Council, 1991) .",

A retrospective study in France covering the period from 1988 to 1997 reported antibodies to MHV in 67% of mouse colonies examined (Zenner and Regnault, 2000) . Suckling rats inoculated experimentally with MHV had transient virus replication in the nasal mucosa and seroconversion but no clinical disease . Similarly, deer mice seroconverted but showed no clinical disease after experimental infection (Silverman et al., 1982) .

Murine hepatitis virus strains appear to possess a primary tropism for the upper respiratory or enteric mucosa. Those strains with respiratory tropism initiate infection in the nasal mucosa and then may disseminate via blood and lymphatics to a variety of other organs because of their polytropic nature. Respiratory (polytropic) strains include MHV-1, MHV-2, MHV-3, A59, S, and JHM. Infection of mice with virulent polytropic MHV strains, infection of mice less than 2 weeks of age, infection of genetically susceptible strains of mice, or infection of immunocompromised mice favour virus dissemination. Virus then secondarily replicates in vascular endothelium and parenchymal tissues, causing disease of brain, liver, lymphoid organs, bone marrow, and other sites. Infection of the brain by viraemic dissemination occurs primarily in immunocompromised or neonatal mice. Additionally, infection of adult mouse brain can occur by extension of virus along olfactory neural pathways, even in the absence of dissemination to other organs. In contrast, enterotropic MHV strains (e.g. LIVIM, MHV-D, and MHV-Y) tend to selectively infect intestinal mucosal epithelium, with no or minimal dissemination to other organs such as mesenteric lymph nodes or liver.",

            "text": "All ages and strains are susceptible to active infection, but disease is largely age-related. Infection of neonatal mice results in severe necrotizing enterocolitis with high mortality within 48 h. Mortality and lesion severity diminish rapidly with advancing age at infection. Adult mice develop minimal lesions although replication of equal or higher titres of virus occurs compared with neonates. The age-dependent decrease in severity of enterotropic MHV disease is probably related to the higher mucosal epithelium turnover in older mice, allowing more rapid replacement of damaged mucosa. Another factor that is of considerable importance to the outcome of MHV infections is host genotype. For example, BALB/c mice are highly susceptible to enterotropic MHV disease while SJL mice, at the other end of the spectrum, are highly resistant (Barthold et al., 1993a) . Unlike in polytropic MHV infection where resistance is correlated with reduced virus replication in target cells (Barthold and Smith, 1987) , enterotropic MHV grows to comparable titres in SJL and BALB/c mice at all ages (Barthold et al., 1993a) . Therefore, the resistance of the SJL mouse to disease caused by enterotropic MHV seems to be mediated through an entirely different mechanism than resistance to polytropic MHV. Furthermore, mouse genotypes that are susceptible to disease caused by one MHV strain may be resistant to disease caused by another strain (Barthold, 1986) . It is therefore not possible to strictly categorize mouse strains as susceptible or resistant. The genetic factors determining susceptibility versus resistance in MHV infections are as yet poorly understood. Both polytropic and enterotropic MHV infections are selflimiting in immunocompetent mice. Immune-mediated clearance of virus usually begins about a week after infection, and most mice eliminate the virus within 3-4 weeks (Barthold, 1986; Barthold and Smith, 1990; Barthold et al., 1993a) . Humoral and cellular immunity appear to participate in host defences to infection, and functional T cells are an absolute requirement (Williamson and Stohlman, 1990; Kyuwa et al., 1996; Lin et al., 1999; Haring and Perlman, 2001) . Therefore, immunodeficient mice such as Foxn1 nu and Prkdc scid mice cannot clear the virus (Barthold et al., 1985; Compton et al., 1993) . Similarly, some genetically modified strains of mice may have deficits in antiviral responses or other alterations that allow the development of persistent MHV infection (Rehg et al., 2001) . Recovered immune mice are resistant to reinfection with the same MHV strain but remain susceptible to repeated infections with different strains of MHV (Barthold and Smith, 1989a,b; . Similarly, maternal immunity protects suckling mice against homologous MHV strains but not necessarily against other strains .

Therefore, the susceptibility of young mice to infection significantly increases at weaning.",

            "text": "Most MHV infections are subclinical and follow one of two epidemiological patterns in immunocompetent mice (National Research Council, 1991; Homberger, 1997) . Enzootic (subclinical) infection, commonly seen in breeding colonies, occurs when a population has been in contact with the virus for a longer period (e.g. several weeks). Adults are immune (due to prior infection), sucklings are passively protected, and infection is perpetuated in weanlings. Epizootic (clinical) infection occurs when the virus is introduced into a naive population (housed in open cages). The infection rapidly spreads through the entire colony. Clinical signs depend upon the virus and mouse strains and are most evident in infant mice. Typically, they include diarrhoea, poor growth, lassitude, and death. In infections due to virulent enterotropic strains, mortality can reach 100% in infant mice. Some strains may also cause neurological signs such as flaccid paralysis of hind limbs, convulsions, and circling. Adult infections are again usually asymptomatic. As the infection becomes established in the colony, the epizootic pattern is replaced by the enzootic pattern. In immunodeficient (e.g. Foxn1 nu and Prkdc scid ) mice, infection with virulent polytropic MHV strains often is rapidly fatal while less virulent strains cause chronic wasting disease (Compton et al., 1993) . In contrast, adult immunodeficient mice can tolerate chronic infection by enterotropic MHV, with slow emaciation and diarrhoea, or minimal clinical disease (Barthold et al., 1985; Barthold, 1986) . Subclinical MHV infections can be activated by a variety of experimental procedures (e.g. thymectomy, whole body irradiation, treatment with chemotherapeutic agents, halothane anaesthesia) or by co-infections with other pathogens (e.g. Eperythrozoon coccoides, K virus; reviewed by Kraft, 1982; National Research Council, 1991) .",

Neonatally infected mice can have vascular-oriented necrotizing (meningo)encephalitis with demyelination in the brain stem and peri-ependymal areas. Lesions in peritoneum, bone marrow, thymus, and other tissues can be variably present. Mice can develop nasoencephalitis due to extension of infection from the nasal mucosa along olfactory pathways to the brain, with meningoencephalitis and demyelination, the latter of which is thought to be largely T cell-mediated (Haring and Perlman, 2001) . This pattern of infection regularly occurs after intranasal inoculation of many MHV strains but is a relatively rare event after natural exposure. Syncytia arising from endothelium, parenchyma, or leukocytes is a hallmark of infection in many tissues including intestine, lung, liver, lymph nodes, spleen, thymus, brain, and bone marrow. Lesions are transient and seldom fully developed in adult immunocompetent mice, but they are manifest in immunocompromised mice. Highly unusual presentations can occur in mice with specific gene defects. For example, granulomatous peritonitis and pleuritis were found in interferon-\u2425-deficient mice infected with MHV (France et al., 1999) .",

The most common sites are terminal ileum, caecum, and proximal colon. The severity of disease is primarily age-dependent, with neonatal mice being most severely affected. These mice show segmentally distributed areas of villus attenuation, enterocytic syncytia (balloon cells), and mucosal necrosis accompanied by leukocytic infiltration. Intracytoplasmic inclusions are present in enterocytes. Erosions, ulceration, and haemorrhage may be seen in more severe cases. Lesions can be fully developed within 24-48 h, but are usually more severe at 3-5 days after infection. Surviving mice may develop compensatory mucosal hyperplasia. Mesenteric lymph nodes usually contain lymphocytic syncytia, and mesenteric vessels may contain endothelial syncytia. Pathological changes in older mice are generally much more subtle and may only consist of transient syncytia. An occasional exception seems to occur in immunodeficient animals such as Foxn1 nu mice, which can develop chronic hyperplastic typhlocolitis of varying severity (Barthold et al., 1985) , but other agents such as Helicobacter species may have been involved.

            "text": "Murine hepatitis virus is highly contagious. It is shed in faeces and nasopharyngeal secretions and appears to be transmitted via direct contact, aerosol, and fomites (Kraft, 1982; National Research Council, 1991) . Vertical (in utero) transmission has been demonstrated in experimental infections (Katami et al., 1978) but does not seem to be of practical importance under natural conditions. Diagnosis during the acute stage of infection can be made by histological demonstration of characteristic lesions with syncytia in target tissues, but clinical signs and lesions can be highly variable and may not be prominent. Suckling, genetically susceptible or immunocompromised mice are the best candidates for evaluation. Active infection can be confirmed by immunohistochemistry (Brownstein and Barthold, 1982) or by virus isolation. Virus recovery from infected tissues is difficult but can be accomplished using primary macrophage cultures or a number of established cell lines such as NCTC 1469 or DBT (ACLAD, 1991) . These cells, however, may not be successful substrates for some enterotropic MHV strains. Virus in suspect tissue can also be confirmed by bioassays such as MAP testing or infant or Foxn1 nu mouse inoculation (De Souza and Smith, 1989; ACLAD, 1991) . Amplification by passage in these mice increases the likelihood of detection of lesions and antigen, or virus recovery. Other direct diagnostic methods that have been successfully utilized to detect MHV in faeces or tissue of infected mice include monoclonal antibody solution hybridization assay (Casebolt and Stephensen, 1992 ) and a number of RT-PCR assays (Homberger et al., 1991; Kunita et al., 1992; Yamada et al., 1993; Besselsen et al., 2002) . Because of the transient nature of MHV infection in immunocompetent mice, serology is the most appropriate diagnostic tool for routine monitoring. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and IFA are well established and sensitive, and all known MHV strains cross-react in both tests (Smith, 1983; ACLAD, 1991) . The magnitude of antibody response depends on MHV strain and mouse genotype (Nakanaga et al., 1983; Barthold and Smith, 1987) . DBA/2 mice are poor antibody responders whereas C57BL/6 mice produce a high antibody titre and are therefore good sentinels. Antibody titres remain high over a period of at least 6 months (Barthold and Smith, 1989b; . Infected mice may not develop detectable antibodies for up to 14 days after initial exposure (Smith, 1983 ). In such cases, a direct diagnostic method as discussed above may be useful. Another drawback of serology is that mice weaned from immune dams can have maternal antibodies until they are 10 weeks of age (Homberger, 1992) . This may impact serological monitoring because the possibility must be considered that low positive results are due to maternally-derived passive immunity. Because the virus can be transmitted by transplantable tumours and other biological materials from mice, including hybridomas (Holmes et al., 1986) and embryonic stem cells (Okumura et al., 1996; Kyuwa, 1997) , these materials should also be routinely screened for MHV contamination. Mouse inoculation bioassay, MAP test, and RT-PCR can be used for this purpose.",

            "text": "The best means of MHV control is to prevent its entry into a facility. This can be accomplished by purchase of mice from virus-free sources and maintenance under effective barrier conditions monitored by a welldesigned quality assurance programme. Control of wild mouse populations, proper husbandry and sanitation, and strict monitoring of biological materials that may harbour virus are also important measures to prevent infection. If infection occurs, the most effective elimination strategy is to cull the affected colony and obtain clean replacement stock. However, this is not always a feasible option when working with valuable mice (e.g. genetically modified lines, breeding stocks). Caesarean derivation or embryo transfer can be used to produce virus-free offspring, and foster-nursing also has been reported to be effective (Lipman et al., 1987) . Quarantine of an affected colony with no breeding and no introduction of new animals for approximately 2 months has been effective in immunocompetent mice (Weir et al., 1987) . The infection is likely to be terminated because MHV requires a constant supply of susceptible animals. This method works best when working with small numbers of mice. Large populations favour the development of new MHV strains that may result in repeated infections with slightly different strains (Adami et al., 1995) . It may be practical to select a few future breeders from the infected population and quarantine them for approximately 3 weeks (Compton et al., 1993) . This can be achieved in isolators, or in individually ventilated cages if proper handling is guaranteed. After this interval, breeding can resume. The 3-week interval should permit recovery from active infection, and the additional 3-week gestation period effectively extends the total quarantine to 6 weeks. It is advisible to select seropositive breeders because the possibility of active infection is lower in such animals. The breeding cessation strategy may not be successful if immunodeficient mice are used because they are susceptible to chronic infection and viral excretion (Barthold et al., 1985) . Genetically engineered mice of unclear, unknown or deficient immune status pose a special challenge because they may develop unusual manifestations of infection or may be unable to clear virus. Rederivation likely is the most cost effective strategy in such situations. Along with the measures described, proper sanitation and disinfection of caging and animal quarters as well as stringent personal sanitation are essential to eliminate infection. Careful testing with sentinel mice should be applied to evaluate the effectiveness of rederivation. If transplantable tumours are contaminated with MHV, virus elimination can be achieved by passage of tumours in athymic Whn rnu rats (R\u00fclicke et al., 1991) .",

It is closely related to human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV). The virus name is officially abbreviated as 'MPV' according to the International Union of Microbiological Societies (2000); however, the former designation 'PVM' will be used in this chapter to avoid confusion with the official abbreviation of mouse parvovirus 1 (MPV). 'Pneumonia virus of mice' infection is relatively common in colonies of mice and rats throughout the world. Seropositivity to PVM was reported in less than 5% of SPF mouse colonies and in approximately 20% of non-SPF mouse colonies in the USA (Jacoby and Lindsey, 1998) . A serological survey in France demonstrated antibodies to PVM in 16% of mouse colonies examined (Zenner and Regnault, 2000) . In a more recent study in North America, such antibodies were found in only 0.1% of mice monitored (Livingston and Riley, 2003) . Antibodies to PVM have also been detected in hamsters, gerbils, cotton rats, guinea pigs, and rabbits (Parker and Richter, 1982; Richter, 1986; National Research Council, 1991) . Experimentally, PVM infection of mice is used as a model for HRSV infection (Domachowske et al., 2000) .",

Murine rotavirus-A/EDIM infection remains prevalent in contemporary mouse colonies and appears to occur worldwide. Seropositivity to MuRV-A/EDIM was reported in approximately 5% of SPF colonies and in almost 30% of non-SPF mouse colonies in the USA in 1996 (Jacoby and Lindsey, 1998) . More recently, Livingston and Riley (2003) found a low rate (1%) of mouse sera to be positive for antibodies against MuRV-A/EDIM. Experimentally, MuRV-A/EDIM infection in mice is used as a model for human rotavirus infection, especially in investigations on the mechanisms of rotavirus immunity and in the development of vaccination strategies (Ward and McNeal, 1999) .",

They are confined to the small intestine and are most prominent at the apices of villi, where rotaviruses infect and replicate within epithelial cells. Hydropic change of villous epithelial cells is the hallmark finding of acute disease. The villi become shortened, and the cells that initially replace the damaged cells are less differentiated, typically cuboidal instead of columnar, and lack a full complement of enzymes for digestion and absorption, resulting in diarrhoea due to maldigestion and malabsorption. Undigested milk in the small intestine promotes bacterial growth and exerts an osmotic effect, exacerbating damage to the villi. Intestinal fluid and electrolyte secretion is further enhanced by activation of the enteric nervous system (Lundgren et al., 2000) and through the effects of a viral enterotoxin called NSP4 (for nonstructural protein 4; Ball et al., 1996) . It is hypothesized that NSP4 is released from virusinfected cells and then triggers a signal transduction pathway that alters epithelial cell permeability and chloride secretion.",

Mice older than about 2 weeks can still be infected with MuRV-A/EDIM, but small numbers of enterocytes become infected, there is little replication of virus, and diarrhoea does not occur. The exact reason for this age-related resistance to disease is unknown. Pups suckling immune dams are protected against EDIM during their period of disease susceptibility (Ros\u00e9 et al., 1998) . In general, the infection is selflimiting and resolves within days. Successful viral clearance is promoted by an intact immune response (Feng et al., 1997; McNeal et al., 1997; Ros\u00e9 et al., 1998) , and some immunodeficient mice (e.g. Prkdc scid and Rag2 tm1Fwa mice) may shed virus for extended periods or become persistently infected (Riepenhoff-Talty et al., 1987; Franco and Greenberg, 1995) .

Enzootic infections commonly occur in breeding or open colonies, where the constant supply of susceptible animals perpetuates the infection. In breeding colonies, mice are infected shortly after weaning as maternal antibody levels wane. Normally, the infection is subclinical, with virus persisting for approximately 2 weeks, accompanied by seroconversion that persists for a year or longer. Epizootic infections occur upon first introduction of the virus to a colony and either die out (self-cure) after 2-7 months or become enzootic depending on colony conditions. The epizootic form is generally acute, and morbidity is very high resulting in nearly all susceptible animals becoming infected within a short time. Clinical signs vary and include rough hair coat, hunched posture, chattering, respiratory distress, prolonged gestation, death of neonates and sucklings, and runting in young mice. Breeding colonies may return to normal productivity in 2 months and thereafter maintain the enzootic pattern of infection. Factors such as strain susceptibility, age, husbandry, transport, and copathogens are important in precipitating overt disease. DBA and 129/J strains of mice are very susceptible to SeV pneumonia whereas SJL/J and C57BL/6/J strains and several outbred stocks are relatively resistant. A/J, BALB/c, and SWR/J are among the strains that show intermediate susceptibility. There is no evidence for persistent infection in immunocompetent mice, but persistent or prolonged infection may occur in immunodeficient mice and can result in wasting and death due to progressive pneumonia (Ward et al., 1976; Iwai et al., 1979; Percy et al., 1994) . Clearance of a primary SeV infection is mediated by CD8 \u03e9 and CD4 \u03e9 T cell mechanisms (Kast et al., 1986; Hou et al., 1992) .",

Lesions of the acute phase, which lasts 8-12 days, are primarily attributed to the cell-mediated immune response that destroys infected respiratory epithelial cells and include necrotizing rhinitis, tracheitis, bronch(iol)itis, and alveolitis. Epithelial syncytiae and cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in infected cells may be seen early in this phase. Alveoli contain sloughed necrotic epithelium, fibrin, neutrophils, and mononuclear cells. Atelectasis, bronchiectasis, and emphysema may occur as a result of damage and obstruction of airways. The reparative phase, which may overlap the acute phase but continues through about the third week post infection, is indicated by regeneration of airway lining epithelium. Adenomatous hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia (with multilayered flat epithelial cells instead of normal columnar cells) in the terminal bronchioles and alveoli are considered to be a hallmark of SeV pneumonia. Mixed inflammatory cell infiltrates in this phase tend to be primarily interstitial rather than alveolar as they are in the acute phase. The resolution phase may be complete by the fourth week post infection and lesions may be difficult to identify subsequently. Residual, persistent lesions that may occur include organizing alveolitis and bronchiolitis fibrosa obliterans. Alveoli and bronchioles are replaced by collagen and fibroblasts, foamy macrophages, and lymphoid infiltrates, often with foci of emphysema, cholesterol crystals, and other debris, which represent attempts to organize and wall off residual necrotic debris and fibrin. Lesions are more severe and variable when additional pathogens such as Mycoplasma pulmonis are present (National Research Council, 1991) . Otitis media has also been reported in natural infections with SeV although some of these studies have been complicated by the presence of other pathogens (Ward, 1974) . Sendai virus has been detected in the inner ear after experimental intracerebral inoculation of neonatal mice (Shimokata et al., 1977) .",

Members of this genus are nonenveloped viruses with singlestranded RNA. The virus is rapidly destroyed at temperatures above 50\u040aC. It is considered to be a primary pathogen of the CNS of mice and can cause clinical disease resembling that due to poliomyelitis virus infections in humans. Antibodies to TMEV have been identified in mouse colonies and feral populations worldwide, and Mus musculus is considered to be the natural host of TMEV (Lipton et al., 2001) . The most well-known and most frequently mentioned TMEV strain is GDVII, which is virulent for mice. Infant or young hamsters and laboratory rats are also susceptible to intracerebral infection. The original isolate is designated TO (Theiler's original) and represents a group of TMEV strains with low virulence for mice. Many additional virus strains have been isolated and studied, and they all fall in the broad grouping of TO and GDVII. A similar virus strain has also been isolated from rats, but in contrast to mouse isolates this virus is not pathogenic for rats and mice after intracerebral inoculation (Hemelt et al., 1974) . Recently, another rat isolate has been characterized and shown to be most closely related to but quite distinct from other TMEV viruses (Ohsawa et al., 2003) . Antibodies to TMEV (strain GDVII) have been detected in guinea pigs and are considered to indicate infection with another closely related cardiovirus (Hansen et al., 1997) .",

After experimental infection, TMEV causes a biphasic disease in susceptible strains of mice. The acute phase is characterized by early infection of neurons in the grey matter. Encephalomyelitis may develop during this phase and may be fatal, but most animals survive and enter the second phase of the disease at 1-3 months after the acute phase. This phase is characterized by viral persistence in the spinal cord white matter, mainly in macrophages, and leads to white matter demyelination. Persistence and demyelination occur only in genetically susceptible mouse strains while resistant strains clear the infection after early grey matter encephalomyelitis through a cytotoxic T lymphocyte response.

In general, virus isolates with low virulence produce persistent CNS infection in mice whereas virulent strains are unable to cause persistent infection. Intracerebral inoculation results in the most severe infections, but the intranasal route is effective also. Experimental intracerebral infections with virulent FA and GDVII strains of TMEV are more likely to cause acute encephalomyelitis and death in weanling mice 4-5 days after inoculation ('Early Disease'). Death may be preceded by neurological manifestations of encephalitis such as hyperexcitability, convulsions, tremors, circling and rolling, and weakness. Animals may develop typical flaccid paralysis of hind limbs, and locomotion is possible only by use of the forelimbs. Interestingly, the tail is not paralysed. Experimental infections with low virulence virus strains (e.g. TO, DA, WW) are more likely to cause persistent infection with development of mild encephalomyelitis followed by a chronic demyelinating disease after a few months ('late disease'). These virus strains infect neurons in the grey matter of the brain and spinal cord during the acute phase of viral growth, followed by virus persistence in macrophages and glial cells in the spinal cord white matter. SJL, SWR, and DBA/2 strains are most susceptible to this chronic demyelinating disease. CBA and C3H/He are less susceptible strains, and strains A, C57BL/6, C57BL/10, and DBA/1 are relatively resistant (Lipton and dal Canto, 1979) . Differences in humoral immune responses play a role in resistance to TMEV infection (Pena Rossi et al., 1991a) , but genetic factors are also important. Several genetic loci implicated in susceptibility to virus persistence, demyelination, or clinical disease have been identified, including the H-2D region of the major histocompatibility complex (Brahic and Bureau, 1998) . Furthermore, the age at infection influences the severity of clinical disease. In infant mice, intracerebral infection with low virulence virus strains (e.g. TO) is often lethal. Young mice develop paralysis after an incubation period of 1-4 weeks while adult mice often show no clinical signs of infection (Downs, 1982) .",

Demyelination in immunocompetent mice is considered to be immune-mediated. Susceptible strains develop a specific delayed-type hypersensitivity response which is the basis for inflammation and demyelination. This reaction is mediated by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Lindsley et al., 1991; Pena Rossi et al., 1991b) and by the activation of cytokines as a consequence of infection of macrophages and other cells of the CNS (Rubio and Capa, 1993; Sierra and Rubio, 1993; Palma et al., 2003) . Protection from chronic demyelinating disease is possible by vaccination with live virus given previously by subcutaneous or intraperitoneal inoculation (Crane et al., 1993; Kurtz et al., 1995) . Early immunosuppression at the time of infection, e.g. by treatment with cyclophosphamide or antithymocyte serum, inhibits or diminishes demyelination. Immunosuppression in mice chronically infected with TMEV leads to remyelination of oligodendrocytes (Rodriguez and Lindsley, 1992) . Further details related to the pathogenesis of TMEV infections and the role of immune mechanisms have been reviewed by Yamada et al. (1991) .",

Demyelination and lethality are reduced after administration of neutralizing antibodies (Fujinami et al., 1989) . Histopathological changes in Prkdc scid mice are very similar to those in Foxn1 nu mice (Rozengurt and Sanchez, 1992) .",

The viral strain most commonly used as antigen for serological testing is GDVII. This strain agglutinates human type 0 erythrocytes at 4\u040aC, and HI has been the standard test for routine screening of mouse populations. Meanwhile, HI has been replaced by ELISA or IFA, both of which are more sensitive and specific. Virus isolation is possible from brains or spinal cords of mice with clinical disease or from the intestinal contents of asymptomatic mice. PCR techniques also are available to test for virus-specific nucleotide sequences in biological samples (Trottier et al., 2002) .",
