The analysis draws upon data from fieldwork and documentary materials with a focus on the UK and EU (2002-05) and explores four arenas: governance and regulatory policy; commercialisation and the market; 'evidentiality' manifest in evidence-based policy; and publics' and technology users' values and ethics. The analysis suggests that there is a trend toward 'purification' across these arenas, both material and socio-political. A common process of partitioning is found in stakeholders' attempts to define a clear terrain, which the field of tissue-engineered technology might occupy. We conclude that pollution ideas and partitioning processes are useful in understanding regulatory ordering and innovation in the emerging technological zone of human tissue engineering. r",

These are in the healthcare marketplace now (Bock, Ibarreta, & Rodriguez-Cerezo, 2003) , and future developments may include vascular prostheses, organ-assist devices (liver, kidney), bio-engineered whole organs, complete body structures (heart valves, joints), and repair of neurological tissues. They are often conceived of as 'borderline' products, emphasising that they have not been catered for by the existing pan-European regulatory framework. Adoption of medical technologies has rested on appraisal of medicines and medical devices and biologics, classifications which have different regimes of assessment. There is a widely though not unanimously perceived need for 'new regulation' (Cox & Tinkler, 2000 for a regulators' perspective).",

At the same time, the transgressive nature of biotechnologies, and the increasing public concern about complex health risks such as BSE, suggest that a focus upon boundary-threatening 'pollutions' may also be rewarding. Anthropological analysis holds that concepts of pollution and purity are strongly related to the cultural ordering of societies (Douglas, 1966) . Pollution ideas work instrumentally, for example by the socially powerful using ideas of contagion to uphold social rules, or they work as symbols: 'Some pollutions are used as analogies for expressing a general view of the social order ' (1966, p. 14) . Gabe (1995) has emphasised the importance of Douglas' approach in focusing on why societies proscribe certain practices. The societal perception of contamination is frequently accompanied by a regulatory response in the form of quarantining or partitioning (Douglas: 'pollution ritual'). We add here that the material consequences-disease, disability-of physical pollution are also important. Once dismissed as 'medical materialism', public health risks raised by biotechnology mean that the framing of material risks has become crucial to their social management. Pollution practices are thus matters both of public health and ordering social experience.",

            "text": "Douglas' conceptualisation of pollution categories has been criticised as portraying sociomaterial categories as overly static (e.g., Brown & Webster, 2004, p. 130) . The subverting character of biotechnology suggests that socio-material boundaries have to be regarded as plastic. Rather than underpinning social order such categories are instead involved in processes of re-ordering societies' institutions, cognitive domains and moralities. Society, material technology and biochemical processes interact to produce hybrid phenomena seen as uncertain and often dangerous, such as global warming and BSE. Medicine has become a key locus for such uneasy convergences, which challenge social meanings and regulatory powers. (We develop theoretical aspects of this discussion elsewhere -Brown, Faulkner, Kent, & Michael, 2006.) Regulation may be constitutive of new technologies (Bud, 1995) . We take up the term 'regulatory order' (Faulkner, Kent, Geesink, & FitzPatrick, 2004) to describe webs of interlinked laws, regulations, guidance, surveillance and more or less contested practices, which might 'govern' and construct technological fields. 'Regulatory ordering' designates processes in which a variety of actors may claim jurisdictional authority over commercial, public, cognitive, technological, or moral territories. 'Technological zones' (Barry, 2003) , akin to the notion of 'technoscapes' (Appadurai, 1990) , may be associated with ordering of regulatory jurisdictions, and may be aligned with political entities such as nations, empires, or trading blocs, or may be less identifiable with political geographies.",

In the European Union, two main regulatory movements are most directly relevant for TE activity. These are embodied in the Directive on standards of quality and safety for the sourcing and processing of human tissues and cells (adopted by the European Parliament in 2004-we refer to this as the Tissues and Cells Directive or TCD henceforth (EC (European Commission) DG Enterprise, 2004); and a proposed Human Tissue-Engineered Products regulation (under the auspices of DG Enterprise; see EC DG Enterprise (2004)we will refer to this as the Tissue Engineering Regulation or TER).

Our discussion runs on two tracks. Firstly, we hazard the application of notions of pollution and purity to healthcare policy innovation. We consider stakeholders' perceptions of 'pollutions' raised by these technologies and ask whether there is evidence of any systematic response. Secondly, in parallel and equally important, given risks of material and social pollutions, we seek to understand the classificatory discursive strategies that stakeholders employ in the shaping of a TE zone. We identify four arenas of socio-political activity and policy discourse, which are particularly salient in shaping the prospects for TE: firstly, the arena of governance and regulatory policy itself; secondly, industry, commercialisation, and the marketplace; thirdly, the 'evidentiality' manifest in public organisations' urge toward 'evidence-based' policy; and fourthly, the arena of publics' and technology users' values and ethics.

Further testimony to the purificatory trend comes from our observations in a UK hospital meeting to discuss implementation of the TCD, in which the motif of the 'few pieces of tissue kept in a fridge at the back of the consultant's office' was deployed as a recurring danger sign. In Europe, therefore, current initiatives reflect a growing sense of urgency about the need for new controls. A more recent instance is specification by expert groups of draft technical requirements related to the TCD (EC Health Consumer Protection Directorate-General, 2004 . The latter for example declares: 'There must be a documented system in place that ensures the identification of every tissue and/or cell unit at all stages of the activities for which accreditationy is sought'. These examples are clearly a sign of the increasing 'regulatory reach' (Welsh & Evans, 1999) of purification policies and their surveillance.",

In the absence of harmonised regulation, the types of evidence required to demonstrate safety are unclear. New standards and forms of testing are being sought. The report of a regulators/industry forum noted unresolved issues in evaluating emerging TE technologies including: need for 'new assays; nontraditonal animal models-e.g. transgenic animals, larger animals; relevance of new endpoints, e.g. genotoxicity and immunogenicity' (ERA Consulting, 2003) . Thus here we see pollution ideas associated with technical uncertainty, including a perception of a requirement for novel methods to assess new potential polluting risks.",

Thus there was conflict not only over the public representation of TE science, but also over the agenda-shaping activity of participating stakeholders.

Ethical standpoints are evident in application to the other discursive arenas discussed here. A major impetus behind the regulatory movements has been the formal opinion produced by the EC's specialist advisory group, the European Group on Ethics (EGE) in science and new technology, who stated in 1998 that there was an 'urgent need to regulate the conditions under which human tissues circulate within the European Market' (EGE, 1998) . EGE principles are enunciated in some detail in the TCD, which quotes the four guiding principles: the ethical imperative to protect human health; the integrity of the human body; the free consent of donors; and the protection of identity. It also emphasises EGE's backing donation as 'a voluntary act of solidarity'. The preface to the directive notes that a survey of Member States revealed that 'considerable discrepancies' exist in national rules covering safety, quality and use of human tissues and that rules for authorisation and inspection of tissue procurement and banking activities were lacking in the majority. Thus regulatory measures to increase the purification of such activities were to be expected and have emerged in the subsequent directive. We see increased rigour in matters of donor consent and traceability of the source of donated tissuesautologous (donor and recipient same individual) technologies are construed as ethically cleaner than allogeneic (donor(s) and recipient(s) different) technologies; a trend that links the ethics of medical therapy with an ethic of clean evidence; an ethic that portrays (especially embryonic) stem cells as a socially 'dirty' area in comparison to tissue-engineered technology. In some contexts, therefore, 'safe tissues' legitimated by good evidence are also 'ethically purified' tissues.",

This was seen above, for example, in the case of autologous cartilage transplantation which in the technology field may be regarded as ethically preferable to donor-cell technologies (and is thus 'purer'), but in the context of healthcare system evidentiality was portrayed as unacceptable (and is thus 'polluted'). Similarly, hybrid technologies may be seen as impure from particular moral standpoints, while 'natural' human tissue ('classical tissue') may be seen as impure/dangerous from the standpoint of actors such as industry who claim credibility via participation in technical standards. Industry perceives itself as cleaner than the hospital sector. On the other hand the use of 'classical tissues' has been the domain of the healthcare system, and here the implication of the public value of integrity of the body is that unmanipulated tissue for medical treatment is safer and purer than engineered tissue.

Information and its social use as 'evidence' have a regulatory function that is emphasised in forms of governance that can be characterised as the 'regulatory state'. Strathern (1999) and Majone (1997) , from the different perspectives of social anthropology and public policy studies, have pointed to the regulatory role of information. And in analysis of medical technology innovation, the regulatory role of the new healthcare sciences has been shown (Faulkner & Kent, 2001; Lehoux & Blume, 2000; May, Mort, Mair, & Williams, 2001) . Key tensions were also apparent in the EC/EU debate on the TCD in which discourses of commerce and ethics came into conflict. This is seen for example in the issue of not-for-profit donation. In a further example, the social management of the tension between evidentiality and ethics can be seen in the strategic containment of unproven technologies within the boundaries of clinical trials.",

Pollution practices and classificatory partitioning work can be seen in the material innovation of TE technology, in the social and organisational processes of regulation itself, in the discourses of evidentiality and commercialisation, and in debate about social values.
