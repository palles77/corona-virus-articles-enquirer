Since monoclonal antibodies are not available for routine immunofluorescence (IF) detection, and clinical strains of both antigenic groups of HCoV are not well adapted to conventional cell culture systems, their diagnosis is not routinely performed. A reliable diagnostic tool is needed to study their epidemiology in hospital care units. An appropriate tool for HCoV diagnosis has to be sensitive and suitable for large scale testing in respiratory specimens. The feasibility of reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and its higher sensitivity compared to IF for detection of HCoV were previously demonstrated [7] . Several other amplification strategies have already been reported [8, 9] . In this study, we used a previously described HCoV-229E RT-PCR methodology [7] followed by hybridization detection to screen directly near 2000 nasal samples from hospitalized children and staff members, without previous cell passage. We evaluated the reliability of this technique in a large prospective study.",

Cells were grown at 37 8C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% (v/v) CO 2 in Earle's minimal essential medium: Hank's M199 (1/1, v/v) (Eurobio, Les Ulis, France), supplemented with 0.13% (w/v) sodium bicarbonate, 20 mg/ml gentamicin (Panpharma, Foug\u00e8res, France), 100,000 U/l penicillin (Eurobio), 0.1 g/l streptomycin (Eurobio) and fetal bovine serum (5% (v/v)) (Gibco, Cergy Pontoise, France).

It was kept at 2 80 8C and used for RT-PCR experiments.

First, RT-PCR products were denatured at 94 8C for 2 min and immediately placed on ice. HCoV single-stranded DNA hybridized with the 5 0 biotinylated E8 probe GGAAGTGCAGGTGTTGTGGC which targets the nucleocapsid gene in 969 -988 [11] . E8 was previously coated on streptavidin-coated wells of a microtiter plate. Then, an anti-double stranded DNA mouse monoclonal antibody was used to detect the hybrid, if present. This specific hybridization was revealed with an enzyme tracer (protein A conjugated to horseradish peroxidase). We determined the optimal probe concentration for coating: 0.5 ng/ml. The test was carried out according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, 20 ml of the RT-PCR product was added to the streptavidin-coated microplate wells in 100 ml of binding buffer. After one hour at 50 8C followed by three washing steps with the kit's washing buffer, 100 ml of anti-double stranded DNA diluted 1/50 was added to each well. The samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and washed, then 100 ml of 1/ 50 diluted enzyme tracer was added and the microplate incubated for a further 30 min at room temperature, then washed. The reaction was developed by addition of 100 ml of substrate. Absorbance was read at 450/630 nm in a photometer. A cut-off value of positivity, expressed in optical density (OD), was defined as the mean of the OD for negative controls plus the constant value of 0.150 absorbance units, as given in the kit recommendations (a positive sample showed an OD value more than 0.150 above the mean of the negative controls).",

Most epidemiological studies conducted mainly in the 1970s used serological assays to detect a Coronavirus infection [12] . However, these techniques are not suitable for the diagnostic of respiratory infections because of poor sensitivity and the requirement for two successive blood samples. Cell cultures have proved to be unreliable for the primary isolation of all human respiratory Coronaviruses. Indeed, only some HCoV strains grow in cell culture after adaptation [6] . Diagnosis of respiratory viral infections is mainly based on IF. For diagnosis of HCoV infection, one anti-229E specific monoclonal antibody (Argene, Varilhes, France) was available but is no longer commercialized. One of us (P.J. Talbot, INRS-Institut Armand-Frappier research center) developed two other monoclonal antibodies (5-11H.6 for HCoV-229E and 1-10C.1 for HCoV-OC43) directed against the S protein [7] .

            "text": "To test for HCoV-229E in the course of large scale epidemiological studies, we used a RT-PCR hybridization method for rapid, specific, and more sensitive detection of HCoV-229E DNA products. Hybridization is more specific and sensitive than agarose gel visualization [13] . The microplate enzyme immunoassay format allows the handling of large number of samples needed for epidemiological studies. Another advantage of RT-PCR methodology is that it can detect the virus genome when it is present at a low titer or when the virus is not replication competent. The value of RT-PCR techniques for certain important respiratory viruses, namely Human Rhino-, and Coronaviruses, is clear because no other practical and rapid techniques are available [14, 15] . Several recent studies have used molecular techniques such as RT-PCR followed by a hybridization step for viral diagnosis [16, 17] . Here, we have adapted and validated such a methodology for a large scale epidemiological study. This requires processing numerous samples while minimizing the time and labor associated with the original molecular HCoV-specific detection protocols. The time needed for diagnosis of HCoV-229E by the RT-PCR-DEIA methodology, which can be carried out in microplates that enable rapid multichannel pipetting, is shorter than that required for cell culture associated with IF detection (4 -5 days) but longer than for IF performed directly on nasal aspirates. However, these techniques are not as sensitive as RT-PCR [7] . Eighty-five clinical samples can be tested in parallel within 10 h for the RT-PCR-DEIA described in the current study, which makes it a reliable screening technique suitable for epidemiological studies. HCoV-229E was detected by this RT-PCR-DEIA with a sensitivity of 0.5TCID 50 /ml. This limit of detection compares well with the values previously obtained by others [9, 16, 17] (20, 0.05 and 0.3TCID 50 /ml, respectively). Moreover, such a threshold represents an acceptable titer for the detection of viruses implicated in clinical events.",

The first study was a retrospective one, with 19 respiratory specimens found HCoV-229E positive in newborns by IF [25] . In 1995, these results were confirmed by a prospective study, which showed an HCoV incidence of 25% in symptomatic neonates of gestational age under 32 weeks [26] . A prospective observational study was carried out to determine the role of HCoV in nosocomial infections in a pediatric ICU from 1997 to 2001. Preliminary results showed an 11% incidence during the first winter [3, 5] . HCoV nosocomial transmission via medical staff is suspected because transmission of these viruses is possible via air or hand contamination [27 -29] . Moreover, during the year 1998, a HCoV-related outbreak was identified correlated with a concomitant high prevalence of HCoV in staff members' [29] . During this 3-year prospective study, HCoV was identified as the main pathogen causing NRVI in infants and newborns.",
