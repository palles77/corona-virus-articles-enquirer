It is now firmly established that novel value-added products can be derived from milk and milk products with nutritional and biotechnological interventions. While until recently, breeding policies have aimed at producing more milk, attempts are now directed toward enhancing the value of milk and studying its health implications. This has found more support with clinically established epidemiological linkages between diet and chronic diseases that encourage search for new links between food and disease.",

Milk composition can be altered by nutritional management or through the manipulation of naturally occurring genetic variation among cattle. The possible channels of influencing milk composition to suit specific needs can be investigated with the help of a thorough comprehension of the biochemistry, genetic traits, and factors in the animal diet that affect milk synthesis and composition. By an intelligent combination of the two approachesnutritional and genetic-a milk designed to suit consumer preferences can be developed. This ''designer milk'' may be rich in specific milk components that may have influence on well-being or on processing. This chapter examines the potential that exists in altering milk composition by nutritional and genetic approaches in order to achieve specific health benefits and/or processing opportunities.",

            "text": "Research on animal breeding, husbandry, and feeding conditions has always had a profound impact on the quality of milk, its constituents, and the subsequently manufactured products. Altering the composition of milk in a manner that suits health and processing needs forms the basis of the current research interests in the area. For example, a greater proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in milk fat, reduced lactose content in milk for lactose-intolerant people, and/or milk free from b-lactoglobulin (b-LG) would benefit human diet and health. From a technological point of view, there exist vast opportunities in altering the primary structure of casein to improve the technological properties of milk and producing milk high in protein content. Engineering milk that clots in less time leads to increased yield and/or more protein recovery during cheese manufacture. Milk that contains nutraceuticals and replacement ingredients for infant formula are other interesting avenues.",

            "text": "The quantity of milk fat is a determinant of its value and hence a major indicator of the revenue accrued from milk. As a recent trend, advanced knowledge about the chemistry of milk fat and human physiology encourages product developers to modify the milk fat to counter the changing functional and nutritional challenges. Dairy products provide less than 15% of the total fat available in the diet (O'Donnell, 1993) . Milk fat provides 25% of the saturated fat, which is still not as high as that in the two groups of fats and oils (29%) and meat, poultry, and fish (39%). The contribution of dairy products to the total cholesterol is 16%, much less than that in eggs (39%) and meat, poultry, and fish (43%). Modifications of the composition and quality of fodder result in different milk fat compositions and influence the nutritional and technological value of fats. A sophisticated trend in the ''health market'' today is to modify the milk fat composition by either adopting suitable feeding strategies or by genetic modes. It is now almost possible to achieve the ideal composition of milk fat for human health and well-being recommended by O'Donnell (1989) , after the Wisconsin Milk Board 1988 Milk Fat Roundtable. The combination suggested at the meeting was less than 10% polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), less than 8% saturated fatty acids (SFA), and more than 82% monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA).",

The degree of unsaturation of the serum lipids, tissue fat, and milk fat may be increased promptly by feeding unsaturated fats in an encapsulated or protected form to lactating animals (Ashes et al., 1997) . It is established that MUFA (C18:1) content can be increased by 50-80% and may approach 50% of milk fatty acids by feeding lipids rich in 18-carbon fatty acids (Grummer, 1991) . Feeding low-roughage diets increases the proportion of MUFA in milk fat, the effects of feeding low-roughage diets and lipid being additive. The SFA content (palmitic acid, C16:0) of milk fat can also be reduced by 20-40% unless the supplemented lipid is rich in palmitic acid. SFA particularly palmitic and other medium-chain fatty acids tend to increase levels of blood cholesterol (O'Donnell, 1993) .",

            "text": "Feeding highly unsaturated oils (e.g., soybean oil) caused depression in milk fat, but increased the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids to SFA in milk (www.extension.iastate.edu). A study at the University of Alberta (Mason, 2001) revealed that feeding canola oil in the encapsulated form (to protect it from biohydrogenation by the rumen microorganisms) led to higher increases in linoleic (18:2) and linolenic (18:3) acids than while feeding unprotected oil seeds. As the melting point of milk fat containing unsaturated fatty acids is more, the spreadability of butter made from this milk improved tremendously. An Australian study involving the feeding of a special blend of canola and soybean meal in the protected form resulted in doubling the spreadability of butter (CSIRO, 1999) . When taken out of a refrigerator at 5 C, the butter was nearly as spreadable as margarine, without losing its special eating qualities. Clinical trials revealed that consumption of dairy products made from this milk led to decrease in lowdensity lipoprotein (LDL) levels in the blood of the consumers. Chouinard et al. (1998) compared the results of feeding to Holstein cows, a control total mixed ration (TMR) with TMR supplemented with calcium salts of three fatty acids from oils with progressive degree of unsaturationcanola oil, soybean oil, or linseed oil. The digestibility of nutrients was higher for rations containing calcium salts than for the control ration. The milk yield increased in proportion to the degree of unsaturation in the feed supplement. The fat content in milk reduced in all the experimental diets as compared to the control. The addition of calcium salts to the ration decreased the proportions of SFA that contained C6-C16 and increased the proportions of C18:0, cis-9-C18:1, and trans-11-C18:1 in milk fat. These findings were confirmed later by Aigster et al. (2000) who reported that feeding calcium salts of high-oleic sunflower oil (HOSO) containing more than 86% oleic acid at the rate of 7.5% of diet dry matter weight to Holstein cows increased the oleic acid content of milk fat from 26% to over 40% and decreased the cholesterol-raising saturates from 41% to 33%.",

The scientists found that supplementing the dietary dry matter with 2% or 4% soybean resulted in a 237% or 314% increase in CLA content of milk compared with the control. Stanton (2000) and her team worked on the supplementation of cow's diet with ingredients such as full fat rapeseed, full fat soybean, and pulp-n-brew (by-product of brewers' grains rich in LA) to study their effect on the CLA levels in milk. When diets of pasture-fed cows were supplemented with full fat rapeseed and full fat soybean, the CLA levels in milk fat increased by 53% and 34%, respectively, after 18 days of feeding when compared to the unsupplemented group of cows on pasture which served as control. The yield and proximate composition of milk were unaffected by the supplementation. Milk from a grass-fed cow can have five times as much CLA as milk from a grain-fed animal (Robinson, 2003) . An experiment supplementing either silage, autumn grass, or spring grass over three periods with pulp-n-brew revealed that the CLA levels increased in case of supplementation of silage and autumn grass, but was less effective in the case of spring grass (Stanton, 2000) . Spring grass feeding led to a 2.1-fold increase in CLA content of milk. The CLA-enriched milk fat exhibited cytotoxicity toward mammary and colon cancer cells.",

In an attempt to increase the CLA content in milk via the cow's diet, Bell and Kennelly (2001) divided 28 Holstein cows into 4 groups and fed them different diets-control diet (CTD), low-fat diet (LFD), high-fat diet 1 (HF1), and high-fat diet 2 (HF2). The animals were kept on CTD for 8 days before starting the different diet regimen. All experimental diets resulted in lower fat percentage in the milk when compared to CTD, whereas other parameters such as milk yield, protein, and lactose were unaffected. The CLA concentration in milk fat was 0.49%, 0.56%, 3.7%, and 5.63% in the group fed CTD, LFD, HF1, and HF2, respectively. Thus, increasing the fat content in the diet increased the CLA content up to 9-12 times, despite lower total fat content. AbuGhazaleh et al. (2003) found that feeding lactating dairy cows a blend of fish oil and MUFA and PUFA resulted in an increase in the concentrations and yields of CLA in milk, the greatest increase being with a blend of a high LA source (e.g., regular sunflower seeds). Beaulieu and Drackley (2004) reported similar results where a diet rich in LA led to increasing the CLA levels in milk fat twofold. Supplementing nonluminous green fodder with mustard cake in the feed of buffaloes resulted in 6.18-mg CLA per gram of fat as compared to 6.05 mg/g when the supplement was groundnut cake (Tyagi et al., 2004) . The total CLA in buffalo milk and milk products increased significantly when the animals were fed berseem and wheat straw in the ratio 87:13. Tsiplakou et al. (2006) examined the CLA content in the milk fat of sheep and goat milk segregated into two groups. Animals in Group 1 were totally on pasture from April onward with supplementary feeding during winter, whereas animals in Group 2 served as the control group and were kept indoors without grazing. The study revealed that the CLA content in milk fat of Group 1 increased in April and May, during the availability of early grass and declined thereafter, whereas that in Group 2 remained more or less constant. The CLA content (cis-9, trans-11) in sheep milk was 2% of the total fatty acids fat content and was much higher than that in goat milk (0.62%).",

Several genetic factors that regulate the expression of the delta-9 desaturase gene have been identified. In a line of transgenic goats that contained a rat stearoyl-CoA desaturase gene targeted at converting medium-and long-chain SFA to their monounsaturated forms, Reh et al.

The intake of total o-3 fatty acids in the United States is 1.6 g/day (Kris-Etherton et al., 2002) . Of this, a-linolenic acid (ALA) accounts for 1.4 g/ day, whereas eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) together account only for 0.1-0.2 g/day. DHA is required by the brain and nerve cells and is essential for normal visual and neurological development in infants (Tomlinson, 2003) . The major food sources of ALA are vegetable oils, principally canola and soybean oils. Oily fish are the richest source of EPA and DHA. EPA and DHA can be made by the body from ALA, but sometimes this capacity is impaired, so oily fish remains the best source. The recommendations for intake of o-3 fatty acids range from 0.5 to 2 g/day. ISSFAL (International Society for the Study of Fatty Acids and Lipids) recommend 0.65-g EPA and DHA per day (Willumsen, 2006) . Of this, the content of each should be at least 0.22 g. Omega-6 is the essential fatty acid that is in ample supply in oils, nuts, and seeds. Table 3 lists the o-6 and o-3 fatty acid contents in commonly available food ingredients.",

On the other hand, deficiency in o-3 is associated with asthma, heart disease, and learning deficiencies. It is established that o-3 fatty acids have a hypolipidaemic action in human, reducing harmful cholesterol levels, particularly plasma triglycerides (Tomlinson, 2003) . It also has an anti-inflammatory action and helps to reduce platelet aggregation. Essential fatty acids have proven to be effective in the treatment of several other ailments including eczema, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, Alzheimer's disease, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). There are reports that approximately equal amounts of these two fats in the diet will result in lower risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disorders, allergies, obesity, diabetes, dementia, and some mental disorders (www.flax.com/newlibrary/ESSENT.html). Dietary manipulation in cows is a practical way to maintain a desired ratio of o-6 to o-3 fatty acids in milk. Milk from pastured cows contains an ideal ratio of essential fatty acids. Dhiman et al. (1999) reported equal quantities of the omega fatty acids (16.5 mg/g fat) in the milk of cows entirely on pasture. Reducing the proportion of grass to two-third of the ration increased the o-6 fatty acids to 31.4 and decreased o-3 fatty acids to 13.5 mg/g milk fat. Further reduction in the dietary proportion of grass to one-third resulted in 42.7 and 8.2 mg/g fat of o-6 and o-3 fatty acids, respectively. There are reports that organic milk contains almost 70% more o-3 fatty acid than nonorganic milk (Cheek, 2006) .",

Genetic markers for milk quality of dairy cattle were discovered and reported by the Iowa State University in the United States in 1996 (www.biotech.iastate.edu/biotech_update). Laboratory experiments with the marker revealed that animals with the ability to produce low-fat milk could be accurately identified. Such genetic testing was aimed at improving dairy herd performance by identifying animals with the potential to produce low-fat milk.

The complete removal of lactose from milk creates milk that is extremely viscous, containing very little water. It is extremely difficult to extract this milk from the mammary gland, making the milking process difficult and painful for the animal.

The preharvest methodologies of reducing lactose involve either the introduction of b-galactosidase enzyme into milk via mammary gland-specific expression or the removal of a-LA and gene ''knockout'' methodologies. Although these successful approaches provide valuable tools to address milk physiology, they reduce the overall sugar content of the milk, resulting in highly viscous milk. Studies on mice have revealed that reduction of lactose via a-LA deletion was inappropriate because it impaired milk volume regulation. The milk of such mice was highly viscous with very high protein (88%) and fat (60%), no a-LA and no lactose (Karatzas and Turner, 1997) . Knocking out the UDP-gal gene in mice also produced milk with no lactose but very high viscosity (Vilotte, 2002) .",

However, the monosachharides produced within the formed milk increases the osmotic pressure within the alveolar lumen, thereby drawing more water and resulting in further dilution of other milk components (Bremel et al., 1989) . Jost et al. (1999) explained an in vivo technique for low-lactose milk production. They generated transgenic mice that selectively produced a biologically active b-galactosidase in their milk. In these transgenic mice, the lactose content of the milk is at least halved, even though the b-galactosidase expression levels were relatively low. The authors claim that it is likely that at least twofold greater levels of lactose reduction could be achieved. In contrast to the previous studies by Bremel et al. (1989) and Karatzas and Turner (1997) , these experiments led to reduction in the lactose content while retaining most of the monosaccharide content of the milk. b-galactosidase synthesis in the mammary gland caused a significant decrease in milk lactose (50-85%) without obvious changes in fat and protein concentrations. It thus helped to maintain a balanced nutrient supply as reflected in the similar growth curve reared on transgenic or control milk. It is likely that transgenic low-lactose milk production could offer a more balanced approach to managing lactose intolerance than postharvest or lactose-replacement products. It is also technically feasible to produce transgenic livestock carrying this transgene and probably similar or better expression levels could be achieved. However, more detailed analysis on several aspects such as the effect of splitting the lactose into glucose and galactose on the osmotic balance in the milk in the gut after ingestion and also the economic viability of the technology need to be investigated (Whitelaw, 1999) .",

Zuelke (1998) worked on the hypothesis that this multigene locus contains all of the DNA sequences required to regulate the coordinated expression of all four individual casein genes. A bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library of genomic DNA from elite dairy cattle was prepared in his laboratory and tested in mice with the hope that transgenic calves that possess this BAC casein construct could be produced. Jeng et al. (1997) characterized and partially purified bovine b-casein (b-CN) from the milk of transgenic mice. The approximate expression of the protein was 3.0 mg/ml of milk. The workers reported that phosphorylation of the bovine b-CN in the milk of transgenic mice was the same as that of native bovine b-CN. If the modification and/or enhancement in the b-CN could be extrapolated into farm animals, there would be several other potential advantages to processing. The extra b-CN would increase the cheese yield besides improving the curd strength. Bleck and Wheeler (1998) also reported the generation of b-CN in the milk of transgenic mice. While murine milk normally contains about 30% total solids, the experimental animals produced milk that had 40-50% total solids (10-20% higher). This increase in total solids obviously caused a decrease in the amount of water in the milk and was accompanied by the concomitant decrease in total volume of milk. Thus, the milk was very viscous, lacked fluidity, and could not be removed easily from the mammary gland. There has also been an attempt to form a glycosylated b-CN in milk (Bleck et al., 1998a) . This has the potential to increase the solubility of b-CN and modify other functional properties such as viscosity, water-holding capacity, foaming, and emulsification.",

Although there was no effect on the rennet coagulation time, the milk of transgenic lines had stronger curd in gels produced by rennet. Brophy et al.

The transgenic cows secreted elevated levels of b-CN (8-20%) and k-CN (twofold) and had a considerably modified k-CN to total casein ratio. b-CN, which is the most abundant milk protein, is involved in binding calcium phosphate and thus controlling milk calcium levels. Higher k-CN content in milk is linked to smaller micelles, better heat stability, and improved cheesemaking properties. In the transgenic animals engineered by Brophy et al. (2003) , the total milk protein increased by 13-20% and total milk casein by 17-35% compared to nontransgenic control cows. This has obviously a positive influence on the cheese yield and also the casein and milk protein concentrate industry. Edible casein is used in vitamin tablets, instant drinks, and infant formulas, whereas acid casein is used for paper coatings, cosmetics, button making, paints, and textile fabrics (Karatzas, 2003) .",

Then it becomes imperative to have infant formulas, which closely imitate human milk so as to provide comparable nutritional and health benefits.

Milk from these transgenic lines had the same antibacterial activity as human milk LZ. The researchers found a zone of clearance in the gel containing the test organism Micrococcus lysodeikticus and the recombinant protein indicating that the hLZ in the mouse milk was active. On the processing front, the expression of LZ in milk results in the reduction of rennet clotting time and greater gel strength in the clot. In the transgenic line of mice generated by Maga et al. (1995) , the milk exhibited a 35% decrease in rennet clotting time, a smaller casein micelle size (157 nm as against 172 nm in the nontransgenic animals) and a 2.5-to 3-fold greater gel strength than control milk. A group of researchers in China also developed two lines of transgenic mice that expressed fully active recombinant hLZ in the mammary gland (Yu et al., 2006) . The antibacterial activity of the LZ from the transgenic lines (480.4 and 301.6 U/ml) was 18 and 11 times greater than that of the nontransgenic mice (25.9 U/ml). Maga et al. (2006) designed a line of transgenic goats that expressed hLZ in the mammary gland. On characterizing the milk from five transgenic goats of this line, they found that the hLZ content in the milk was 270 mg/ml or 68% of the level found in human milk. Milk from these transgenic animals had a lower somatic cell count, which may influence udder health positively. It also had a shorter rennet clotting time and increased curd strength (17 min and 26.3 Pa, respectively, in the experimental samples as against 20 min and 20.7 Pa in control samples). The aim now is to produce cows that will produce LZ in their milk. Such LZfortified milk has the potential to reduce udder infections in dairy cows and intestinal ailments in humans who drink milk (Bailey, 2001) . A double transgenic cow that coexpresses both hLF and hLZ in milk may also reduce the incidence of intramammary infection or mastitis.",

Both casein and whey proteins are reported to be responsible for these allergic responses. Although the reasons for cow milk allergy are not well understood, genetic and environmental factors and their interaction are thought to be responsible (Crittenden and Bennett, 2005; Halken, 2004; Wal, 2002) . Comparatively few infants develop cow milk protein allergy. Usually, infants and young children (2%) suffer from this ailment and outgrow it by the age of five (Host, 2002) . It is rare in adults (0.1-0.5%). Cow milk protein allergy can be diagnosed by one or more of cutaneous (e.g., eczema, rashes), gastrointestinal (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), or respiratory (e.g., asthma, rhinitis, wheezing) symptoms. Severe symptoms would need special prescription medications such as antihistamines and epinephrine (Nuble, 2006) . The only effective management strategy Designer Milk for cow milk protein allergy is avoidance of cow milk and its products, which in turn negatively influences nutritional management through diet.",

Mammalian cell culture systems are often used for expression of recombinant human proteins (rHP), as the latter can only be obtained in a biologically active conformation when produced in such cells. However, this approach has limited production capacity and is expensive. In contrast, the production of rHP in milk of transgenic cattle is a safe and less-expensive alternative with the advantage of better protein output (Brink et al., 2000) . Ebert et al. (1991) reported the generation of two transgenic goats that expressed a variant of human tissue plasminogen activator (htPA). The milk from one of these contained enzymatically active longer acting tissue plasminogen activator (LAtPA) at a concentration of 3 mg/ml. Economic comparison of production costs of htPA through bacterial fermentation, mammalian cell culture, and cow transgenic technology estimates the cost per gram of htPA to be 20,000, 10,000, and 10 US$, respectively (Karatzas and Turner, 1997) . Shani et al. (1992) tested the feasibility of producing large quantities of human serum albumin, which is used in blood transfusions, in the milk of transgenic livestock by generating transgenic mice as a model system. Charlie and George were two calves created from fetal cells in the US in 1998 to produce the human serum albumin in their milk (Johnston, 2006) .",

On these lines, Polly, a genetically altered sheep was created at the Roslin Institute in Scotland to produce milk that contained the protein used to treat human hemophilia (Pettus, 2006) . Wright et al. (1991) described the generation of five transgenic sheep (four female and one male) for a fusion of the ovine b-LG gene promoter to the human a-1 antitrypsin (AAT) genomic sequences. AAT is a singlechain glycoprotein secreted by the liver and its main function is the inhibition of the enzyme elastase. The absence of active AAT in the system leads to emphysema (loss of elasticity of the lung tissue) and/or other lung-related ailments such as cystic fibrosis and adult respiratory distress syndrome. Milk of three of the ewes generated by Wright et al. (1991) expressed human AAT (hAAT) at levels greater than 1 g/liter. In one case, initial levels of hAAT exceeded 60 g/liter and stabilized at 35 g/ liter as lactation progressed. hAAT purified from the milk of these animals was fully N-glycosylated and had a biological activity indistinguishable from human plasma-derived material. These animals and their progeny exhibited stable transmission of the transgene. The founder animals yielded very similar levels of hAAT protein in milk continuously over several lactations. A flock of seven first generation ewes (derived from a founder male) yielded comparable levels of hAAT protein in first and second lactation milk. Two second generation ewes of this line also produced equivalent quantities of the human protein (Carver et al., 1993) . Several animals from this group are reported to secrete milk containing 35-47 g/liter without affecting the production of other proteins in milk (Coleman, 1996) .",

The company claims that the antithrombin (ATryn ) has been recommended for market authorization for the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in surgery of patients with congenital antithrombin deficiency (www.transgenics. com/news.html). Besides being the first antithrombin product approved by the European Medicines Agency for use in all 25 countries of the European Union, ATryn will also be the only available antithrombin product that is produced by recombinant biotechnology and is not derived from the human blood supply. This drug is envisaged to be a boon for those suffering from a deficiency in antithrombin, a condition which becomes dangerous during surgery or childbirth, when they cannot take conventional blood-thinning pills.",

The malaria vaccine secreted in their milk was able to contain the disease in monkeys vaccinated with the same. This study has now been extrapolated to target livestock as the source animals. GTC is currently working on a project to develop the malaria vaccine from goat milk. It is understood that a liter of goat milk can contain up to 9 g of the transgenic protein and that eight goats can produce enough vaccine to inoculate 20 million people. The cost to produce a transgenic protein in goat milk can thus be 3-30 times cheaper than the current method using mammalian cell culture. In addition to these, GTC is also working on the development of a recombinant hAAT, a recombinant human albumin, and a CD137 antibody to stimulate the immune system as a potential treatment for solid tumors.",

The protein, when secreted in their milk, may be purified and tested for its efficacy in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis is a chronic demyelinating disease of the human central nervous system connected with clinical neurological signs of paralysis and histopathological changes.

Hematech has already created Tc calves, which carry the human chromosome. The remaining work is to knock out the equivalent bovine antibody genes, so the Tc cow produces purely human antibodies in its blood.

Transgenic as well as control mice were challenged with intramammary infusion of a strain of S. aureus. None of these glands from the transgenic animals were visibly infected. These glands contained less than 10% of the bacterial load observed in the heavily infected controls. Wall et al. (2005) engineered and introduced into Jersey cows, a transgene that includes the genetic code for producing lysostaphin. The gene for secreting lysostaphin was introduced from a nonpathogenic species of Staphylococcus that uses the protein to deter the pathogenic counterpart, S. aureus. The lysostaphin was secreted into milk of the modified animals to the order of 0.9-14 mg/ml. The milk destroyed the causative organisms in vitro. Ten nontransgenic cows that were given intramammary infusions of S. aureus showed positive signs of mastitis infection, whereas three transgenic cows under the same treatment remained unaffected. A small dose of 3 mg/ml of lysostaphin in milk was sufficient to provide protection against S. aureus.

            "text": "Coliforms account for about 40-50% of mastitis cases in the United States. One-tenth of the affected animals become useless for milk production and several die from shock induced by the bacterial toxin, or endotoxin, causing an estimated loss of $1.4 billion annually for farmers in terms of medical expenses and cost of milk that cannot be sold (McBride, 2002) . Vaccines, while having limited success in reducing clinical symptoms, do not remove the organisms. Wang et al. (2002) report the identification and characterization of the gene for soluble CD14, which binds and neutralizes endotoxins responsible for mastitis. This soluble protein which can be found set in the membranes of white blood cells in cows was also discovered in cow milk. Just as the protein increases during coliform infections in humans and laboratory animals, it was shown to tone down the severe reaction of the bovines to coliform endotoxin as well as initiate a suitable response to the infiltrating bacteria. The gene was cloned and the recombinant bovine CD14 protein (rb-CD14) produced was evaluated. Intraperitoneal injection of rb-CD14 together with endotoxin reduced fatality in mice. Preliminary trials showed that intramammary injection of soluble rb-CD14 is 100% effective in preventing mastitis by E. coli in lactating dairy cows. The workers have filed a patent application on rb-CD14 which promises both effective treatment for infected cows and prevention in future cows genetically engineered with the gene. They claim that the gene for CD14 can be designed and inserted into the modified animals so that they can produce the protein only in their mammary cells.",

It is clear that it might now be possible to produce specific antibodies in the mammary gland that are capable of preventing mastitis infection or those that aid in preventing human diseases. Thus, one can foresee antibodies against Salmonella, Listeria, or other pathogens that will produce safer milk products. Active recombinant immunoglobulin capable of neutralizing Coronavirus was produced in mouse milk (Castilla et al., 1998) . Increasing the concentration of IgA receptors in mammary cell may potentially lead to the accumulation of the protective antibodies in milk (De Groot et al., 1999) . While recombinant immunoglobulins have been expressed in mammalian transgenic milk (Gavilondo et al., 2000) , a calf with a gene that promotes the growth of red cells in humans has been produced by transgenesis (www.publicscan.fi). Research is also under way to manufacture milk through transgenesis for treatment of diseases such as PKU, hereditary emphysema, and cystic fibrosis (Margawati, 2003) .",

Spider silk is made of protein-based polymer filaments or threads secreted by specialized epithelial cells. These fibers are flexible and lightweight and have extraordinary strength and toughness comparable to those of synthetic high-performance fibers. Spider silk is, thus, one of the strongest and most versatile naturally occurring materials in nature (Samson, 2004) . Although it appears delicate and is one-tenth the width of a human hair, it is stronger than steel and stretches more than nylon (www.sciam.com, 2002) . Several attempts have been made to synthesize spider silk for industrial and medical applications. Unfortunately, the high shearing forces in conventional fermentations cause the spidroin protein to aggregate, making it useless for manufacturing fibers. So, these spider genes were introduced into the cells of lactating goats and they secreted silk in tiny strands along with their milk. These polymer strands could be woven into threads after extracting them from the milk and used for applications such as military uniforms, medical microsutures, and tennis racket strings (Anonymous, 2002) . Nexia, a US company, has developed a strain of fast-maturing Breed Early Lactate Early (BELE) transgenic goats that secretes the spider silk in milk (Dove, 2000) .",

As the increase in the total solids is associated with a decrease in total milk volume, the net result is the same quantity of fat and protein being produced in a lesser total milk volume. If this technology could be extrapolated in dairy animals, milk that contains 6.5% protein, 7% fat, 2.5% lactose, and 50% less water is not an improbable accomplishment. The advantages in terms of animal health would include less stress on the cow and on her udder since she would be producing onehalf her normal volume of milk and decrease in mastitis owing to less lactose availability for the causative organisms. The processing industry would gain in terms of (1) skim milk with twice protein content and half the lactose content of normal milk, (2) easier to produce low lactose or lactose-free dairy products, (3) better product yields due to concentration, (4) reduction in total whey output because of low milk volume and lactose content, and (5) direct economic benefits in terms of 50% reduction in the cost of milk transportation owing to reduced volumes.",
