These include the growing importance of non-communicable diseases throughout the world, the continuing burden of established communicable diseases, and accelerated risk of new viral and other epidemics -and pandemics -with the ease of formal international travel. The new Wuhan coronavirus [2019-nCoV} epidemic [1] illustrates this well, with spread already of this potentially serious respiratory illness from China as its source to 25 countries in Asia, Oceania, North America and Europe. Reports by the 8th February 2020 to the coordinating European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control of 803 laboratory-confirmed deaths from Wuhan 2019-nCoV infection within 41 days after the first report already exceeds the 774 deaths from SARS [Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome] coronavirus between 2002 and 2004. Further health-related pressures in the coming decade will include the impact of ageing populations, capacity limits in respite care and residential homes, increasing economic migration from less developed to developed countries, and a growing impact of climate change and pollution on health and disease. Within multiple other health impacts of pollution, observational evidence from the time of the Beijing Olympics in 2008 and recent mechanistic studies point to serious concerns about the role of pollution in triggering cardiovascular events [2] . These findings strengthen the need to tackle pollution effectively.",

            "text": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) will continue to be an emerging global threat. The WHO and other agencies have developed ambitious initiatives to combat AMR. However, a serious barrier to surveillance of AMR is that the worst affected regions of the world, including sub-Saharan Africa, have generated the least data on prevalence and trends of AMR, a key step in addressing the problem [8] . Effective resolution of AMR will need multistakeholder international cooperation, including the biotechnology industry and regulatory authorities, and effective international implementation by health authorities and health professionals of guidelines on the judicious use of any powerful new classes of treatment which emerge [9 , 10] . Developments in diagnostics are likely to include more advanced imaging, increasing availability of point of care testing (biochemical and genomic), and the further extension of genomics into clinical practice, potentially before and around the time of birth. There will be increasing opportunities for using real-world evidence to assist in regulation of medicines, in particular for rare and orphan diseases [11] . Expected further and new therapeutic approaches -many with ethical challenges -include biosimilars, more precision medicines with companion diagnostics [12] , regenerative medicine, gene editing, more advanced microsurgery and robotics, therapeutic radiology and new devices for managing diabetes mellitus, pain control, heart disease and many other conditions. Also in prospect is much more from digital health, including both empowering patients and further transfer of responsibility for health monitoring from health professionals to patients. However, another side to digital health is the power of social media to inform -and misinform -patients, health professionals and other stakeholders about health-related matters. This is one of several reasons for low adherence to long-term treatment, for example for control of high blood pressure [13] . Another possible impact of widespread access to and use of social media has been vaccine hesitancy: delay or refusal to accept immunization [14] . For example, population protection from the potentially serious infectious disease measles has decreased alarmingly both in the general public -and in some regions even among health professionals. To counter this, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has been funded to work jointly with the European Medicines Agency to provide Europe-wide information to vaccine-hesitant populations and respond to their concerns, and to provide toolkits for healthcare workers and public health experts to support their effort s to improve the uptake of immunization programmes [15] .",
