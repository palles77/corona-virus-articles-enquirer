            "text": "The costs associated with respiratory disease include prevention, treatment, and lost productivity. Several researchers have attempted to use available NAHMS data from their state to calculate a local cost of respiratory disease and respiratory disease prevention for specific management groups. For unweaned calves, estimates range from $9.84 to $16.35 per calf whereas weaned calf estimates range from $2.05 to $2.22 per calf. 3, 4 Respiratory disease in the early stages of the calf's life can have significant effects on subsequent productivity and survivability, thus adding to these costs. A diagnosis of pneumonia during the first 6 months of life resulted in slower growth rates later in life 5 and decreased productivity. 2, 6 Heifers followed through first calving that were diagnosed with respiratory disease as young calves were 2 or more times more likely to die before calving 7, 8 and calve at an older age when compared with heifers that did not develop respiratory disease before 90 days of age. 8 Diagnosis of pneumonia in adult dairy cattle is not as common as diseases such as mastitis, lameness, metabolic disease, and reproductive disorders. Annually, 3.3% of dairy cows develop owner-reported pneumonia and those pneumonia cases account for 11.3% of cow deaths. 9 Losses and prevention costs were estimated at $4.31 per cow in Michigan herds to $9.08 per cow in Ohio herds. 3, 10 The Ohio study reported an estimated annual prevalence per 100 cow-years for pneumonia of 19% among adult dairy cattle. 10 The lack of progress in controlling respiratory disease demonstrates that there continues to be significant room for improvement in controlling this multifactorial syndrome, and that dairy producers need assistance in applying evolving husbandry practices to improve dairy cattle health.",

Failure of passive transfer (FPT) is a major factor in the development and severity of respiratory disease in calves. 5, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Despite the significant effort placed on colostrum delivery to newborn calves, NAHMS Dairy 2007 determined that nearly 1 in 5 (19.2%) newborn heifer calves had FPT. 18 As part of complete program for respiratory disease control, practitioners must continually focus on colostrum management and monitor the incidence of FPT. Associated with FPT are the environments that the calves are placed into, as these can have significant impacts on pneumonia as well. Assuring maternity pens are kept clean and dry and that calves are moved from maternity pens immediately after birth are important aspects of newborn care. Delivery of calves into a heavily contaminated maternity pen and leaving newborn calves in the maternity pen increases the risk that calves are orally exposed to bacterial pathogens. 19 Incidental consumption of environmental bacteria by the newborn calf is a risk factor for the development of enteric disease, and limits colostrum immunoglobulin absorption across the gut wall. 20, 21 ",

Bacteria counts in colostrum can be assessed by performing a total plate count (TPC) and coliform counts. The goal is to have the TPC less than 1 million colony-forming units (CFU)/mL and the coliform count less than 10,000 CFU/mL. 22 Several methods have been used to reduce bacteria counts in colostrum while still maintaining adequate passive transfer, including pasteurization and acidification of colostrum using formic acid. [23] [24] [25] It should be noted that use of pasteurization and formic acid to control Mycobacterium avium subsp paratuberculosis (MAP) remains controversial and may not be appropriate for herds attempting to control Johnes disease. [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] Until further research is completed to more thoroughly characterize the importance of low numbers of MAP in treated colostrum samples, producers who are actively attempting to control or eradicate Johnes disease may wish to consider the use a colostrum replacement.

In studies that have identified bacteria found in air it was determined that the majority of airborne bacteria are nonpathogenic, but even dead airborne bacteria can provide a burden on respiratory tract defenses that would make lung tissues more susceptible to infections. 47 Human work environments with high levels of nonpathogenic bacteria have been associated with a higher risk of the development of respiratory disease. 48 Risk factors for increased bacteria counts in the air include high ambient temperatures, the use of solid-pen dividers and solid ends on calf pens, the use of bedding materials that provide a higher nesting score allowing calves to nest down into the bedding material to conserve heat (ie, straw), and smaller pen sizes per calf (<3 m 2 ).

            "text": "Although not commonplace in the United States, group housing of unweaned calves is becoming more prevalent, especially with the increased awareness of animal welfare and with computer milk-feeding stations being more readily available. Previous work has associated the use of computer milk feeders with an increased incidence of respiratory disease, although the role of stocking density was not evaluated in those trials. 50 More recent work has suggested that housing computer-fed calves in groups of 10 or less results in improved growth and less morbidity associated with respiratory disease. 51 These findings agree with others that have suggested limiting group size in both unweaned and weaned calves to groups of less than 7 results in the best overall welfare for the calves. 52 Further research is needed to determine whether this apparent group size effect is related to better social welfare of the calves in smaller groups or an effect of stocking density as a factor of barn volume. Stocking rate in a given volume of area is an important variable in total airborne pathogen load, 53, 54 with a lower stocking rate reducing respiratory morbidity 6 (Thomas Earlywine, PhD, presentation notes, Land O Lakes, Webster City, IA, January 2010). Ventilation requirements do not have a linear relationship with stocking density. A twofold increase in stocking density requires nearly a tenfold increase in ventilation capacity to maintain pathogenic bacteria levels at similar concentrations. 54 This layout proves to be especially problematic in calf barns that are designed to be naturally ventilated or ventilated by negative pressure. These types of barns may not provide adequate ventilation at the level of the calf's environment. Positive pressure ventilation systems similar to those described in the previous section may be necessary to adequately ventilate buildings housing groups of unweaned and weaned calves. 49 Calves housed in buildings should have 2.3 to 2.8 m 2 or more of space available per calf. 42 As calves age, positive pressure ventilation systems may become unnecessary as long as the ventilation system can provide even airflow throughout the building, and provide 4 air turns per hour in the winter and a minimum of 30 air turns per hour in the summer. 36, 55 Minimizing Weaning Stress",

Some sources recommended not to move calves into group pens at the same time they are weaned but to give them 1 to 2 weeks in the individual pen after weaning to adjust fully to starter consumption. 57 A Minnesota trial saw no difference in growth rate between grouping calves immediately versus leaving calves in individual pens. 58 In contrast, an Italian trial reported that weaning calves at 49 days and immediately moving the calves to group housing resulted in higher growth rates and reduced respiratory treatments by one-half compared with weaning the calves and leaving them in individual hutches for 1 week. 56 In a separate trial, calves that were grouped at 49 days and fed MR 1 time per day for 1 week had a reduced incidence of respiratory disease compared with calves that were weaned at 49 days and then left in individual housing for 1 week (respective respiratory incidence 5 20% vs 34%). 56 When calves are moved into group pens, it is important to allow them adequate space per calf, plenty of fresh air, and ready access to feed and water. 57 An additional consideration when weaning calves should be to screen calves for signs of sickness. Calves that are clinically sick will be shedding large numbers of pathogenic organisms into the environment and are likely an important reservoir for introduction of disease to other calves. 36 Application of a screening method to consistently evaluate calves for sickness prior to weaning will reduce the number of calves that are inadvertently weaned with active respiratory disease. 59 ",

IN vaccines will result in the development of immune proteins (primarily IgA) on the mucosal surface where potential pathogens will be invading. This antibody will neutralize infectious agents at the mucosal surface; thus preventing infection rather than just reducing severity of disease as is expected with parenteral vaccine administration. IN vaccine will also induce interferon release at the mucosal surface, which will provide a nonspecific antiviral environment and may stimulate maturation of the immune system. 61 There is some consensus amongst calf consultants that the use of modified live vaccines in the first months of life will benefit the calf through the development of cell-mediated immunity; however, there is very little evidence to support this practice. 61 In these programs, calves are vaccinated several times during the first months of life, sometimes at intervals as close as 1 week. Extrapolating from research from other species, overvaccinating calves may lead to negative outcomes such as immunologic tolerance or autoimmunity. 61 A small body of evidence exists to support this immunologic response, but much more research is needed in this area to explore this practice. 62 Vaccination programs should be designed to address the continuous-flow nature of most dairy operations as compared with seasonal vaccination patterns used in beef operations. It may be important to incorporate vaccines into breeding-age heifers prior to pregnancy if vaccines are not approved for pregnant animals. In addition, modified live infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) vaccines can cause necrosis of the corpus luteum, so IBR vaccines should not be administered close to breeding season in IBRna\u00efve animals. 63 Immunology and vaccinology are rapidly developing fields of veterinary medicine, which should help answer some of the essential questions veterinarians have regarding development of effective vaccination programs for dairy calves.

At present, 9.3% of all dairy herds, representing 11.5% of heifers raised in the United States, are raised off-site. When heifers are raised off-site, approximately 63% of those heifers are comingled with cattle from other farms. 9 Approximately 39% of dairy operations brought some outside animals onto their farm during the previous year, including heifers raised off-site. On those operations, just over 20% of the farms quarantined animals from the resident population on arrival. 9 Incorporating quarantine facilities into dairy farm design plans is often overlooked even though it could provide insurance against disease proliferation. A written quarantine plan should be established that addresses caretaker and animal movement plans; and protocols for feeding, vaccination, disease testing, and facility disinfection to minimize the spread of disease between newlyarriving groups and the resident herd. If the dairy is purchasing lactating dairy cows, plans for milking cows in an isolated facility will also need to be made. Ideally, animals should be quarantined for a minimum of 14 to 21 days. 36 Introduction of bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) into a dairy herd is often through a new heifer entering the herd, either home-raised or purchased. 41 Control of BVD outbreaks has been fairly well achieved through vaccination and other control programs. Persistently infected (PI) animals are an important reservoir of disease transmission. 36, 64, 65 As part of a complete biosecurity program for the prevention of respiratory disease, all new and returning herd arrivals should be tested by an appropriate screening test for the presence of virus in the submitted tissue as part of the quarantine process. In addition, in herds purchasing pregnant animals and herds trying to achieve BVDnegative status, calves should be tested at birth. For more information about BVD control programs, readers should consult the article by Julia Ridpath elsewhere in this issue for further exploration of this topic. 66 Housing of sick animals in a location away from healthy animals is an essential method for the control of disease spread on dairy farms. Animals that are clinically sick will be shedding large numbers of pathogenic organisms into the environment and are likely an important reservoir for introduction of disease to other animals, 36 especially immunocompromised animals such as young calves and peri-parturient cows. When selecting a site for the hospital facility, care must be taken to minimize contact with healthy animals and assure that the predominant airflow does not move toward clinically normal animals.",

Collection of history should facilitate the development of a list of all calf-rearing practices that could potentially have a negative impact on calf health. All responses should be validated with physical examinations, record analysis, and facilities evaluation, if possible. Record analysis can be used to determine previous morbidity and mortality rates and to assess whether there are patterns associated with certain seasons of the year or stocking rates.

This screening system evaluates rectal temperature, nasal discharge, cough and ocular discharge, and ear position to assign an individual respiratory severity score for each calf. Validation of the screening system has been completed based on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid cytology and culture. Calves that have a composite score of more than 4 are considered to have respiratory disease and should be treated accordingly. 59 Application of the UW screening system across all ages of available animals allows for the determination of age of onset of the respiratory problems, encouraging the calf caretaker to initiate therapy earlier in the course of the disease. The screening system can also be used to determine which calves need therapy, monitor treatment efficacy, and evaluate calf caretakers' ability to diagnose and treat calves. If used correctly, greater than 85% of calves that need to be treated should be correctly identified by calf caretakers. 59 ",

            "text": "When designing vaccine programs for adult animals, a risk assessment of each individual dairy operation should be completed to determine the need for certain vaccines. These decisions should be based on pathogen risks and potential breaks in immunity, such as immune suppression associated with the periparturient period. To avoid immune suppression in the post-parturient period, it would be prudent to avoid administration of vaccines for at least 3 to 4 weeks after calving. 63 Consideration must be given to the need for transfer of colostral antibodies against disease threats of importance for the dairy. Vaccines should be administered at least 2 to 4 weeks before the expected calving date to avoid immune suppression, 70, 71, 77 thus providing sufficient time for immunoglobulin transfer to the colostrum to provide for adequate passive transfer. 23 Ventilation Ventilation systems need to be designed to limit the buildup of microbial agents, dust particles, noxious gases, heat, and humidity. Adult dairy cattle are minimally affected by cold stress caused by typical winter temperatures seen in the northern United States. 36 Barns may be underventilated during winter months to prevent freezing of water and manure systems, resulting in an increased incidence of respiratory disease. Ventilation systems should provide 36 CFM per 1000 lbs (454 kg) of body weight in cold weather and 335 CFM per 1000 lbs of body weight during hot weather. 84 An alternative method to assess ventilation function would be to determine the number of air exchanges per hour. During cold weather, 4 air exchanges must occur per hour whereas a minimum of 30 air exchanges per hour are needed during summer months. 36, 55 Supplemental cooling will be necessary to minimize the effects of heat stress when the temperature heat index exceeds 72. 80, 85 SUMMARY Incidence rates for BRD in dairy cattle have remained essentially unchanged over the last 20 years. Dairy calves are more commonly affected than adult animals, with BRD being the principal cause of death in weaned dairy calves. The lack of progress in controlling respiratory disease demonstrates that there continues to be significant room for improvement in controlling this multifactorial syndrome, and that dairy producers need assistance in applying evolving husbandry practices to improve the health of dairy cattle. Calf management programs that focus on the development of a robust immune system through adequate passive transfer, adequate energy and protein supply, sound biosecurity practices, and vaccination programs have helped alleviate problems on some herds. There is minimal information regarding control of respiratory problems in adult dairy cattle. Therefore, it seems prudent to focus the management strategies on preventing disease through sound management of the transition period, along with sound vaccination and biosecurity programs.",
