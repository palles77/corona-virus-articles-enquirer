This modeling dates from the time of Fibonacci (the growth of a rabbit populations). It can be said that the foundations of mathematical epidemiology are based on models of compartments, and the structure of epidemic models is determined by the flow of individuals from one compartment to another in a population. Hence, in the literature various models are proposed namely, a simple model is the susceptible-infected model, in the SI model individuals can be in two states susceptible (healthy) and infected, SIR model is the susceptible-infected-recovered model, it's based on the assumption that an infected individual can recover after disease and can not be infected again, that is in contrast to SIS model in which individual can recover after disease and may be infected again and so on. The model prey-predator (1926), or model of Lotka-Volterra, plays a determinant role in dynamics of population and is considered as a basic conceptual model in population dynamics and also in mathematical epidemiology.",

Moreover in 2014 the fractional order SIS model has been developed with a constant population size [4] and with a variable population size [5] , in both works the stability of equilibrium points of the model is studied, two years later mathematical model for the transmission of Ebola in human society has been presented [6] numerical solution for fractional SIR model with constant population [7] by using discrete methods: Generalized Euler Method and Predictor Corrector Adams method, which is an implicit numerical scheme, also Okyere E et al. studied a fractional order extension of the SIR and SIS model by replacing the ordinary derivative by the Caputo fractional derivative [8] , they used also Adams method to illustrate model solutions and Banerjee SK studied a fractional order SIS epidemic model with constant recruitment rate and variable population size [9] , in 2017 Sun GQ et al. suggested a mathematical model to describe the transmission of cholera in the population of China [10] , what is particular in this model is the environment-to-human transmission of the disease, Li L presented a dynamical model on hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in China [11] , within the same frame Ahmed EM and El-Saka HA studied the transmission of a dangerous epidemic, called MERS-CoV using fractional order derivative [12] , recently in 2018 Sigh J et al. considered a fractional epidemiological SIR model to describe the spread of computer virus [13] .",

In order to derive numerical solutions, we have used different methods: the forward Euler method and a recent analytic method for solving nonlinear problem which is variational iteration method (VIM). This method is generally effective only for small time intervals. However, using programming tools, this method becomes efficient to produce numerical results on a long time interval. In our model, some assumptions are taken in order to transform the system to one fractional differential equation for which the ordinary exact solution is calculated formally.",

Finally, the memory effect of the fractional order derivative affects the dynamic of the system, it is noticed from the numerical results that when the value of \u03b1 is decreased, the disease takes more time to be eradicated and it reflects the memory effect. We strongly believe that this particular SIS model generalizes the ordinary model. Comparing the numerical results and the exact solutions of the ordinary model, the obtained studies can arise some new questions about the specific relations between the fractional order \u03b1 and the history of biological parameters of the model. Our analysis has been restricted to a simple local temporal dynamic process in which all epidemiological parameters are supposed to be constant, however, in the field of epidemiology different factors may affect the process of the system like policy, migration and vaccination, taking into account the non locality of geographical spread, is more reasonable to take into consideration special effects in the study of some specific epidemics that cannot supposed to be local like the Black Death in Europe [33] , for other mathematical studies on geo-temporal diffusion of epidemics see [34] and [35] . In other context in the classical spread rules of infections the population is divided into a finite number of compartments and infections are controlled by the mass-action law ( \u2212 \u03b2 N SI), in other words we suppose that each individual has the same probability to contact another one in the population, however, in a more realistic study, social relations and families sizes are not identical in the society, so the numbers of contacts differ from a susceptible individual to another, that gives rise to another possible study by modeling the epidemic as network with nods and edges, where nods represent individuals and edges represent a possible contact between two nods this complex study is proposed by Diekmann et al.

Furthermore, we define b * := min { b, \u03b4 (\u03b1+1) || f || \u221e 1 /\u03b1 } . Then, there exists a function y : [ 0 , b * ] \u2212\u2192 R solution of the Eq. (18) . In the case, f is bounded on D and Lipschitz with respect to the second variable then, the solution y is unique. Next, using the above result to prove the existence and the uniqueness of the solution of Eq. (17) . Hence, we have the following result Theorem 2. The solution of the fractional Eq. (17) exists and is unique Proof. By putting c = \u03b2 \u2212 (e + \u03b3 ) , and d = \u2212 \u03b2 N , we get f (t, I) = cI + dI 2 . Let D =: [ 0 , b ] \u00d7 y 0 0 \u2212 \u03b4, y 0 0 + \u03b4 with b > 0 and \u03b4 > 0. The function f : D \u2212\u2192 R is continuous and it depends explicitly only on I. As this function is continuous on the compact interval y 0 0 \u2212 \u03b4, y 0 0 + \u03b4 then, it is bounded on this interval. Furthermore, if we calculate the derivative of f ( t, I ) with respect to the second variable, we obtain f I (t, I) = c + 2 dI, this derivative is continuous on the compact y 0 0 \u2212 \u03b4, y 0 0 + \u03b4 then, it is bounded on this interval. Consequently, we define M = Sup I\u2208 [ y 0 0 \u2212\u03b4,y 0 0 + \u03b4] | f I (t, I) | .",

With python software, the fractional VIM method can be programmed with the function Vimfrac(b, c, d, alpha, n) which permits to return the polynomial solution for n = 7 which is of degree d = 173 \u03b1. We mention that, this numerical solution becomes effective for long time intervals. The effect of fractional derivative order on numerical solutions, following variational iteration method and Euler method, is illustrated by the figures below with different values of model parameters. In Figs. 3 and 5 we present the numerical solutions of our fractional model for some values of \u03b1 near to 1, then we choose for example \u03b1 = 0 . 9 , \u03b1 = 0 . 95 and \u03b1 = 0 . 99 , we can see that the numerical solution's trajectory is approaching to the ordinary solution",
