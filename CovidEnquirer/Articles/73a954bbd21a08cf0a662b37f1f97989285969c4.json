            "text": "Classifying the mechanisms of antibiotic failure has led to the development of new treatment strategies for killing bacteria. Among the currently described mechanismswhich include resistance, persistence and tolerancewe propose defiance as a subclass of antibiotic failure specific to prodrugs. Using locked antimicrobial peptides (AMP) that are activated by bacterial 5 proteases as a prototypic prodrug, we observe that although treatment eliminates bacteria across the vast majority of environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, concentration of growth nutrients), bacteria spontaneously switch from susceptibility to defiance under conditions that alter the competing rates between bacterial proliferation and prodrug activation. To identify the determinants of this switch-like behavior, we model bacteria-prodrug dynamics as a multi-rate 10 feedback system and identify a dimensionless quantity we call the Bacterial Advantage Heuristic (BAH) that perfectly classifies bacteria as either defiant or susceptible across a broad range of treatment conditions. By recognizing that the bacterial switch from susceptibility to defiance behaves analogously to electronic transistors, we construct prodrug logic gates (e.g., AND, OR, NOT, etc.) to allow assembly of an integrated 3-bit multi-prodrug circuit that kills defiant bacteria 15 under all possible combinations of BAH values (i.e., 000, 001, \u2026, 111) that represent a broad range of possible treatment conditions. Our study identifies a form of bacterial resistance specific to prodrugs that is described by a predictive dimensionless constant to reveal logic-based treatment strategies using multi-prodrug biological circuits.",

Understanding the causes of antibiotic failure inspires the development of new drugs and informs clinical treatment strategies [3] [4] [5] . These failure mechanisms are broadly classified into three distinct categories (i.e., resistance, 5 persistence, and tolerance), which are characterized by the change in drug concentration and exposure time required to kill bacteria 6 . For example, resistance is characterized by genetic mutations or phenotypic changes which result in bacteria requiring significantly higher concentrations of antibiotic (minimum inhibitory concentration, MIC) to be lethal. By contrast, bacteria exhibiting tolerance or persistence require increased drug exposure time (minimum 10 duration for killing, MDK), with the latter exhibiting a biphasic killing profile (Fig. 1A) . Further, bacteria populations become tolerant through environmental conditions or genetic mutations, whereas persistence is an actively maintained, non-heritable state exhibited by a subpopulation of bacteria. Discriminating between these survival strategies employed by bacteria is crucial for the development of new drugs and clinical treatment decisions 6 . 15",

            "text": "Antibiotic success is markedly improved by proper titration of drugs, as overdosing leads to off-target toxicity and underdosing increases the likelihood of pathogens developing resistance 7 . However, optimal drug doses are difficult to achieve over the course of treatment because infection burden changes dynamically over time, creating a moving target 7, 8 . Prodrugs, which represent ~10% of all FDA-approved drugs in the last decade, are a promising solution 20 because they may be automatically titrated by a disease-related activation mechanism, increase bioavailability, and reduce the risk of off-target effects 9 . For example, prodrugs such as ganciclovir 10 and isoniazid 11 are administered as biologically inactive forms and are enzymatically activated by the pathogen. Here, we use prototypic auto-titrating prodrugs comprising cationic antimicrobial peptides (AMP), which evolved as a part of innate immunity and display broad-25 spectrum and prokaryote-specific antimicrobial activity 12 . Cationic AMPs act by disrupting bacterial membranes and inducing inflammatory responses 13 , but suffer from off-target toxicity and low stability in vivo 14, 15 . Our AMP prodrugs are activated directly by bacterial proteases, which are a major cause of virulence [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] during infections and important targets for antibiotic development 22 . Of these proteases, outer membrane protease T (OmpT) is a membrane-bound 5 bacterial protein that is widely conserved across gram-negative bacteria of the Enterobacteriaceae family and recognizes a variety of targets that contribute to its virulence (e.g., plasminogen) 18, 19, [23] [24] [25] . In this work, we design cationic AMPs that are locked by charge complexation with anionic peptides and connected with a protease-cleavable linker substrate [26] [27] [28] that is recognized by E. coli protease OmpT, such that increasing concentrations of bacteria 10 activate higher concentrations of free drug.",

Based on our model and experimental validation, we observed that under defiance, 15 populations of live bacteria expanded (i.e., positive growth rate) throughout the course of treatment, which implied that key bacterial growth parameters (e.g., r, Bmax) were greater in value than enzyme-driven death rate parameters (e.g., kcat, Km) (Fig. 2B, 3A) . Therefore, to derive a metric to discriminate between defiant and susceptible bacteria, we used Buckingham Pi theorem to identify a dimensionless quantity that represents the competing balance between growth rate 20 and enzymatic turnover, which we defined as the Bacterial Advantage Heuristic The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/556951 doi: bioRxiv preprint This quantity reflects that bacteria have a higher probability of switching to the defiance phenotype under conditions that promote a faster growth rate, r, and slower enzymatic activity, kcat. To predict the onset of the defiance phenotype, we sought to determine the critical B.A.H. value that distinguishes defiant bacteria from susceptible populations. Using our mathematical model, we simulated >2000 prodrug treatment conditions covering a range of values for r, Bmax, kcat, and Km 5 and identified a critical value of BAH at which bacteria switch from susceptibility to defiance (BAHcrit ~ -11.37) (Fig. 3B) . In other words, for any environmental or genetic condition that produces a BAH > BAHcrit, the bacteria will survive the prodrug treatment, and for BAH < BAHcrit, the bacteria will die. To test the robustness of this switch-like behavior, we modeled treatment outcomes by varying bacterial growth rates (r) and enzymatic efficiencies (kcat) (> 100 points) and 10 found that BAHcrit was time-independent across a range of prodrug treatment durations. (Fig 3C-E) . Additionally, to demonstrate that BAHcrit is independent from any system parameter, we modeled treatment outcomes (> 500 points) by individually fixing each of the four parameters (i.e., r, Bmax, kcat, and Km) in turn and found that BAHcrit was invariant across all conditions tested (Fig   3F-I) . To confirm the value of BAHcrit experimentally, we first used the nine experimental 15 conditions previously tested (A1-3, B1-3, C1-3) to fit the values for kcat and r (Fig S2) , and then used the computationally-derived critical BAH threshold to classify the phenotype of nine bacteriaprodrug treatment conditions. By receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) analysis, BAHcrit perfectly predicted the onset of defiance (Fig. 3J ,K AUROC = 1.00, n = 9) with 100% specificity and sensitivity. Our model results predicted that changing key system parameters to decrease 20 the B.A.H. below the critical threshold will result in successful treatment of defiant bacteria. To demonstrate this, we took three different AMP prodrugs with distinct linker sequences (Table S1) with increasing kcat values for OmpT to decrease the B.A.H. below BAHcrit, which allowed us to successfully treat previously defiant populations of bacteria (Fig. S3) . These findings are important for the successful design and administration of prodrug therapies, which may be 25 improved by optimizing fundamental pharmacokinetic parameters.

These biological 15 circuits would then be representative of a multi-prodrug strategy to eliminate bacteria even when input BAH variables (i.e., temperature, nutrient level, enzyme activity) would result in a state of defiance for a single prodrug. To accomplish this, we designed complementary N-type and P-type transistors, which are required to construct all possible logic gates 40 . N-type transistors allow input current to pass when the gate signal is above a defined threshold, whereas P-type transistors 20 allow current to pass when the gate signal is below a defined threshold. We constructed N-type transistors with our AMP prodrug system, which allowed input bacteria (Bin = 1) to survive (Bout = 1) when the BAH is above BAHcrit which we used to define the gate threshold (i.e., BAH > BAHcrit equivalent to G = 1; BAH < BAHcrit equivalent to G = 0) (Fig. 4B) .

When exposed to all four possible inputs, bacteria only survived the condition with two low kcat prodrugs (i.e., AB = 11), which matched the ideal outputs of an AND gate (Fig. 5B) . These results show that dosing multiple prodrugs in sequence reduces the fraction of bacterial populations that survive (e.g., one 5 prodrug = 50% survival, two prodrugs = 25% survival, etc.). Whereas the AND gate comprised prodrugs in series, we demonstrated one implementation of an OR gate by splitting a population of bacteria in half (i.e., separate wells), dosing each with a different prodrug during the same time interval (i.e., in parallel) and recombining the bacteria post-treatment. Using this circuit, bacteria survived in any case where at least one half of the population was dosed with low kcat prodrug 10 (i.e., AB = 01, 10, or 11), matching the ideal outputs of an OR gate (Fig. 5C) . We created a NOT gate by using a P-type transistor comprising ampicillin-loaded heat-triggered liposomes, which caused bacteria to die at high temperatures (i.e., IN = 1) and survive at low temperatures (i.e., IN = 0). (Fig. 5D) . These results show that heat-triggered liposomes can be used as a fail-safe to kill bacteria above the critical temperature representing the onset of the defiance phenotype. To 15 validate the multi-prodrug circuit, we incubated populations of bacteria under each of the eight environmental conditions with three prodrugs: (1) an AMP prodrug with fixed kcat/Km, (2) an AMP prodrug with kcat/Km determined by input C, and (3) a heat-triggered, drug-loaded liposome (Fig.   4A) . Whereas a single prodrug only eliminated bacteria in half of the input cases (Fig. 5E) , our circuit autonomously eliminated bacteria under all eight combinations of the three environmental 20 signals (Fig. 5F) .

In this work, we identified a prodrug-specific subclass of resistance, which we named defiance. To study bacterial defiance, we synthesized an AMP prodrug that was activated by bacterial protease activity and successfully 10 killed E. coli. However, we found that this prodrug failed in conditions where the bacteria grew faster than the rate at which they activated the drug. We developed a mathematical model of the bacteria-prodrug competition and derived a dimensionless constant (BAH), which we used to perfectly predict the onset of the defiance phenotype. These studies revealed that both environmental (e.g., temperature, available nutrients) and pharmacokinetic (e.g., activation rate 15 kcat) parameters can be tuned to engineer successful prodrug therapies. In future work, this information could be leveraged to improve the efficacy of existing prodrugs by tuning the prodrug decay constant (i.e., biological half-life), which directly changes the BAHcrit value. Alternatively, the catalytic efficiency of the prodrug substrate could be tuned to change the BAH value and increase the probability of success, which has been previously demonstrated by engineering 20 prodrug substrates with higher affinity for the enzymatic target 44, 45 .",

Ideally, these variables will proportionally influence either the growth rate or the enzymatic activity of the bacteria, such as how increasing substrate efficiency increases kcat, which creates one critical value (BAHcrit). By contrast, variables that influence growth rate or enzyme activity with multiple critical values (i.e., inflection points) limit the range of applicability. For example, higher temperatures increase both growth rate and 15 enzymatic activity, but above critical temperatures, protein enzymes denature, resulting in irreversible loss of activity 61 . However, these values are beyond relevant biological values and do not limit the applicability of these prodrug treatments to normal physiological conditions.",

To calculate bacterial growth rate constants, we incubated bacteria in broth or water at 37 o C and measured OD600 over the course of 8 hours, revealing a higher growth rate in broth consistent with published values 35, 56 (3.0 > 0.1 h -1 ) (Fig. S1B) . To quantify enzymatic velocity, we measured proteolytic velocity (moles L -1 s -1 ) under substrate concentrations ranging from 0-200 uM and fit the Michaelis-Menten equations 10 to this data to calculate kcat and Km (Fig. S1C ). Using these measured parameters (Table S2) , we generated kinetic curves for bacteria number and drug concentration over time. The model showed that after a period of initial bacterial growth, the lagging drug population eliminated the infection burden. While the initial reservoir of locked drug concentration was ~200 \u00b5M, the unlocked drug never rose above 5 \u00b5M (Fig. S1D) , revealing that this system maintains the minimal 15 drug concentration required to kill the infection.

To simplify the model, we defined one bacterium, with ~ 2.5 \u00d7 10 3 OmpT proteases per 5 cell 62 , as equivalent to one effective enzyme. The concentration of cleaved fluorescent probe is monitored over time, and the bacterial concentration is quantified at serial time points.

DPPC and MPPC were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipics, inc. The heat-triggered NOT gate formulation was composed of DPPC:MPPC at the molar ratio 9:1, and were evaporated in cholorform to produce a lipid film. Films were rehydrated in 100% water containing 100 mg/mL ampicillin and were sonicated for 20 minutes. Lipid formulations were then purified using a PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare) and size was measured via dynamic light scattering (DLS, 5 Malvern). Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was performed using statistical packages included in GraphPad Prism 6. To assess the significance of increase in signal due to protease cleavage, we used a two-way ANOVA (without repeated measures) followed by Sidak's multiple comparisons test. A one-way 15 ANOVA followed by Dunnett's multiple comparisons test was used to compare experimental means to cells only control bacterial viability assays. Two-way ANOVA followed by Sidak's multiple comparisons test used to compare experimental means to control for bacterial cytotoxicity at multiple starting concentrations.The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.
