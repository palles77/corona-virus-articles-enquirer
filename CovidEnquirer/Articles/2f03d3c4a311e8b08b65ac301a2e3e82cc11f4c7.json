            "text": "Sudden disease emergences, now often considered events, have been reported since antiquity. Perhaps one of the earliest reported was described by Thucydides, the Athenian, who in his History of the Peloponnesian War (411 BC) described an as-yet unidentified plague that weakened the population of Athens in 430 BC at a critical point during its siege by the armies of Sparta. The Roman Empire was repeatedly beset by plague epidemics during its long dominance over Europe, North Africa and the Near East. The numerous transfers of viruses from the Old to the New World following the rediscovery of the Americas by Columbus in 1492 caused devastation of the native populations, particularly through the introduction of smallpox, reducing them to less than 10 percent of preconquest levels. In the 17 th century, Daniel Defoe described in detail the impact of the Black Death on London in 1665 in his fictional book A Journal of a Plague Year. In modern times we have had the devastating pandemics of influenza, cholera and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Each of these events provokes similar questions. Where did it come from? How did it get here and why? The processes that underlie these events continue to this day and are collectively termed emerging and re-emerging diseases (Morse, 1995) . The definition of an emerging disease is one that has newly appeared in a population or that has been known for some time but is rapidly increasing in incidence or geographic range. A number of recurring features of emerging diseases have been noted. Most are zoonotic, thus can infect humans and other animals. Many are viruses, particularly those with RNA genomes (Taylor et al., 2001) .",

For example, human encroachment in a virgin ecosystem provides the opportunity for a previously unencountered virus to infect human beings or their domestic animals. Viral mutability could enable a virus to adapt to the new host. Subsequent trade and migration could allow spread of the new virus to susceptible individuals and the large populations found in urban centers could ensure that the virus is maintained. The interplay of all these factors provides a rational framework and explanation for virus emergence. However, to gain an appreciation of the components of this process it is necessary to focus on each in itself before linking them together.",

The grey wolf (Canis lupus) is considered the progenitor of the domestic dog, which is now classified as a separate subspecies (Canis lupus familiaris) (Mech and Boitani, 2006) . Phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA derived from 654 domestic dogs from around the world suggests that there were relatively few domestication events, all taking place in southeast Asia (Savoilainen et al., 2002) . This then led to the spread of dogs throughout the Old and New Worlds (Leonard et al., 2002) . Documented remains of domestic dogs date back to 12,000 years ago in the Middle East (Davis and Valla, 1978) and this, together with molecular clock analysis of mitochondrial DNA, suggests a likely date of domestication around 15,000 years ago (Table 1 .1). Subsequent selective breeding has led to the plethora of varieties that are now apparent today but all are derived from the wolf. Domestic dogs now provide a variety of functions that support human lives but have also brought their pathogens into close proximity to humans and their dwellings. The act of domesticating animals has been considered one of the major drivers in the emergence of human infectious diseases (Wolfe et al., 2007) .",

Data collected by the United Nations suggested that the human population was estimated to be just short of seven billion in 2010 (anon, 2010) and continues to grow exponentially. Two countries, China and India, have populations of over one billion. This in turn drives all other human activities that might influence disease emergence. It increases the demand for food, which in turn increases the area needed for arable farming and the number of livestock to meet this demand. It has also changed the way in which livestock is reared, leading to increased intensive farming practices. More land is needed to accommodate agricultural production, which leads to further environmental encroachment that leads to displaced or altered behaviors in wildlife species. Population increase is fueling increased urbanization and increased population density. Singapore is now the most densely populated place on earth with five million humans contained within 707 km 2 . In less-developed regions of the world, this places stress on sanitation and clean water infrastructures if present, and creates a breeding ground for fecal-oral infections if not. The increase in both numbers and densities of humans provides larger populations in close proximity to one another, supporting the maintenance and spread of infectious diseases that are discussed later in this chapter.",

A prominent feature of migration over recent centuries has been the movement of populations from rural to urban centers, to a point where the majority of humans now reside in cities. This process has been driven by increases in the human population, developments in the intensification of agriculture reducing the need for human labor, and industrialization of societies that create more jobs in urban areas.

            "text": "Commerce and travel go hand in hand and have also played a part in the movement of disease. Yellow fever was introduced into the Americas, along with its vector, the mosquito Aedes aegypti, by the mass movement of slaves from Africa (Bryant et al., 2007) . The subsequent trading network between Africa, the Americas and Europe led to sudden outbreaks of the disease in European ports during the 19 th century. One of the best documented disease outbreaks occurred in 1865 in Swansea, a port city in southern Wales, following the embarkation of a ship from Cuba delivering copper ore (Meers, 1986) . A combination of the introduction of infected mosquitoes from the ship and a particularly warm period in October led to a local outbreak at this unusually high latitude. This highlights the role of invasive species. Fortunately for South Wales, its climate is too cold in winter, although it certainly receives enough precipitation, to support over-wintering Ae. aegypti mosquitoes and it is assumed that the imported mosquitoes died out, causing a cessation in cases of yellow fever. However, many mosquito species have proven more robust and with a little human help have managed to move between continents. The trade in used tires by container ships has been instrumental in dispersing the aggressive biting mosquito, Aedes albopictus. Originally from Asia, it has spread to the Americas and then Europe (Benedict et al., 2007) . The presence of this species in Italy contributed to an outbreak of Chikungunya fever following the return of viremic individuals returning to the country having visited islands in the Indian Ocean that were experiencing outbreaks of the disease. Other species such as Aedes japonicus have also emerged in Central Europe (Schaffner et al., 2009) .",

The emergence of Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1998 was triggered by the transfer of virus from roosting fruit bats of the genus Pteropus, to intensively farmed pigs (Eaton et al., 2006) . This led to a rapid amplification of virus within the pig farm and provided the opportunity for infection of farm workers (Mohd Nor et al., 2000) . This case is remarkable in that it resulted from the rapid jump of a virus across two species barriers within a short period of time (see Chapter 11).",

The primary function of this protein or proteins is to engage with a host receptor and initiate entry of a virus into the target cell. It is assumed that for most viruses evolutionary pressure has led to a degree of specificity of this interaction at the level of host and even the cell type that the virus infects. This in turn will influence the mode of transmission of the virus and restrict its target cell range, its cellular tropism. This aspect of transmission forms the concept of the species barrier. However, other interactions between the virus and the host cell, such as the ability to subvert the innate immune response, utilization of cellular components and modification of cellular activities also provide barriers to virus replication. Simplistically, the species barrier restricts a particular virus to bind to a particular receptor, of a particular cell type of a particular host species. The ability to deviate away from this apparent Hepatitis C host restriction forms the basis of cross-species transmission (CST) and is influenced by nonviral factors, such as the opportunity to be exposed to a new host, or by changes in the virus, as discussed below.",

The initial events that caused HIV to jump from chimpanzees to humans cannot be known with any certainty although it may have occurred during butchery of bush meat, perhaps resulting from infection of an open wound, and is thus an example of mechanical transmission (see Chapter 9). However, there is no doubt that the resulting pandemic was spread primarily by sexual contact and to a lesser degree by contaminated needles and medical blood products. This example also returns to the role of human behavior in the rate of transmission. A combination of promiscuity and air travel promoted the rapid spread of a sexually transmitted disease.",

For measles virus this was estimated to vary between 250,000 and 500,000 individuals. Below this, further transmission of virus would be reduced to a level that would cause the epidemic to fade out. Viral factors such as the persistence of the virus in the host, the duration of immunity to the virus and virus variation in response to host immunity will affect the CCS. A further factor that influences this is the birth rate of the host population (Conlan and Grenfell, 2007) .

An example of acute is the common cold, which results from rhinovirus infection, where the host sheds virus for a short period that can be as little as two days, but the infection resolves rapidly and the host is immune to further infections. In more extreme virus infections, disease does not resolve and the host dies. The converse of this is the development of a chronic infection where the host is capable of infecting susceptible individuals for a considerable period, often years. Viral infections such as hepatitis B virus and HIV are examples of this scenario. An intermediate condition exists where the host is chronically infected but sheds virus intermittently. A clear example of this is herpes simplex virus infections, where the virus remains dormant within infected dorsal root ganglia but emerges intermittently to cause a cold sore from which virus is shed. These are often triggered following periods of stress but resolve through immune control.",

This has enabled the calculation of the force of infection of a particular virus within a defined population. This approach has also been applied to transmission of vector-borne infections such as malaria and Dengue virus where the period of vector activity can be predicted. A similar approach has been used to estimate the force of infection of rabies virus transmitted by vampire bats based on the number of biting incidents per member of the population (Schneider et al., 1996) .

Although rare, a recent case of reassortment of an Orthobunyavirus isolated from a human with febrile illness has been reported (Aquilar et al., 2011) . Orthomyxoviruses have eight genome segments and reassortment has led to antigenic shift of the virus surface proteins and emergence of influenza viruses to which there is no prior immunity. Finally Orbiviruses have 10 segments and reassortment is suspected to have led to the emergence of bluetongue virus variants in Europe (Batten et al., 2008) .",

Activation of PPRs leads to transcriptional activation of type-1 interferon, principally interferon beta, which in turn activates further interferons and other proteins that actively inhibit viral replication and prevent further viral spread. Unsurprisingly, viruses have evolved many mechanisms to inhibit interferon activation by blocking signaling pathways that stimulate gene transcription (reviewed extensively by Randall and Goodbourn, 2008) .

Each animal on earth hosts its own spectrum of pathogens and it is only now with the advent of sensitive gene amplification and mass sequencing that researchers can fully reveal the extent of this (Drexler et al., 2012a) . Following the emergence of the SARS-coronavirus, bats have come under intense scrutiny as the potential origin of the SARS outbreak and a source of zoonotic viruses. Surveillance in bats from around the world has shown that they are infected with a diverse range of coronaviruses. Even European bats have been shown to host a range of SARSrelated coronaviruses (Drexler et al., 2012b) although there is no evidence to suspect that these viruses are capable of jumping the species barrier to humans at the present time. A recent study screening illegally imported products of wildlife origin simultaneously demonstrated the species from which the product originated and detected the presence of retroviruses and herpes viruses within it (Smith et al., 2012) . In some instances, the original species were shown to be nonhuman primates and thus the viruses that infected these animals were theoretically adapted to primates and thus have a shorter \"species jump\" to humans and present a higher threat to the human population. A number of features of animals enable them to play a role in virus emergence and these are discussed in the following sections.",

Key examples of the spread of zoonotic viruses by migrating birds are the westward spread of H5N1 avian influenza from Asia to Europe and the movement of West Nile virus from Africa to Western Europe following well-traveled migration routes across the Mediterranean Sea (see Chapter 7). Migration therefore provides a direct vehicle for long-distance translocation of pathogens and thus the opportunity to emerge in new locations.",

The species has various adaptations to achieve this, including self-sharpening incisor teeth, anticoagulants in its saliva and grooves in its tongue to enhance blood lapping. As an unintended consequence of these adaptations, the vampire bat is a highly efficient transmission vector of rabies virus and is responsible for large numbers of livestock deaths (Belotto et al., 2005) and occasional transmission to humans in Latin America (Barbosa et al., 2008) .
