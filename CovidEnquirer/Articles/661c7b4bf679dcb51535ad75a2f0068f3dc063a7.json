Findings: Evidence from six Cochrane systematic reviews was weak owing to the lack of highquality TCM trials. Limitations were usually due to biases that influenced the validity of results. Conclusions: TCM is widely used for treating ARTIs. However, none of the identified studies has been well designed or conducted. In this overview, we suggest that clinical trials of TCM for ARTIs need to be re-run in accordance with internationally recognized standards. \u00aa",

ARTIs are caused by over 200 viruses or bacteria. They are transmitted directly through person-to-person contact, either by airborne droplets from a sneeze or cough, or by direct contact with nasal or throat secretions, articles freshly soiled with secretions of the nose and throat, or by transmission via an object indirectly. For example, sore throat can either be a disease in itself, or can result from other diseases, such as influenza and glandular fever. 1e4 Uncomplicated ARTIs, such as the common cold and sore throat, recover spontaneously as a result of antibodies produced by the patient's own immune system targeting the virus. In general, no specific antiviral treatment is used. Treatment aims to alleviate symptoms and prevent complications. Antibiotics are used for bacterial infections. However, antibiotics only have a modest effect over placebo for acute bronchitis 5 and sore throat. 6, 7 For the common cold and influenza, over-the-counter decongestants, antihistamines, cough suppressants, and expectorants may be used for symptomatic relief.",

TCM drug treatment typically consists of a complex prescription of a combination of components according to TCM signs. These include whether the patients themselves feel cold and chilly; experience nasal obstruction; do not sweat; generally have a high temperature with a thin, white coating on the tongue; have a productive cough; do not feel chilly; have an elevated temperature, with a thin and slightly yellow coating on the tongue; or have a productive cough. Colds are categorized as 'chills cold' or 'fever cold'. Shigao (gypsum fibrosum) is used to abate fever; Caihu (bupleurum chinesenes DC) and Jinjie (herba schizonepetae) are used as analgesics; Banxia (rhizoma pinelliae) is dispensed to loosen sputum and suppress cough; Fangfeng (radix saposhnikiviae) and Zhishuye (folium perillae) are used for 'chill cough'; Jinyinghua (flos lonicerae) and Bohe (herba menthae) for 'fever cough', and so on.

The mortality level in mainland China was also lower than that in the rest of the world (9.6%, 774/8096). 15, 16 During the early stage of the SARS outbreak, Western medicine, specifically corticosteroids, was combined with Chinese herbal medicines in an effort to promote non-specific immunity to combat inflammation. The State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the Chinese Ministry of Health General Office, issued a rule of combining Western and Chinese herbal medicine (ICWM) for this rapidly spreading disease. SARS was classified as a plague that needed to be treated in accordance with the 'wei, qi, ying, xue and sanjiao bianzheng lunzhi' theory. In keeping with this theory, some herbal medicinal extract injections to clear fever (qin re), remove dampness (qu shi), relieve asthma (zhi chuan), promote and regulate immunologic function (fu zheng), resist viruses and remove toxins (jie du), were recommended for clinical use. 17 The Cochrane systematic review, conducted by Liu et al. 14 included 12 RCTs, and one quasi-RCT had a total of 654 participants using 12 different TCM formulations. They carried out a combined analysis of two trials using the same TCM formulation plus Western medicine, and separately analyzed four studies using different formulations plus Western medicine vs Western medicine alone to compare mortality between the two therapies. TCM did not show any benefit in reducing mortality compared with Western medicine alone (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.07e1.38, RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.01e6.11; RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.04e4.78; RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.01e7.70; and RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.01e4.06, respectively). Whether or not TCMs can decrease mortality from SARS remains an unanswered question (Table 1 ).",

A large number of the trials claimed to be RCTs; however, most of the trial authors misunderstood the concept of randomization allocation. In the reviews in which the reviewers subsequently contacted the authors, the percentage of authentic RCTs was 6.7% (23/342). This highlights the need for reviewers, including those doing Cochrane reviews, to use a strict method to identify whether the trial authors used the correct method to allocate participants when conducting a systematic review, and not just relying on published reports. It also emphasizes the importance of using a quality scoring system, and planning, a priori, subgroup analysis of trials based on study quality.

If the control drug does not match the 'zheng', the interpretation of results should refer to a placebo. Unmatched formulations may be detrimental to the patient. It was often necessary to include TCM signs as a secondary or an additional outcome in the trials. However, it is difficult to compare or quantify TCM signs as most of them are subjective or non-specific outcomes. For example, 'mai xiang' means pulse presentations. Diagnosing 'mai xiang' in TCM is a complex technique, dependent upon the TCM physician's feelings and experience. The descriptors 'marked improvement' and 'improvement' are commonly used to assess the change in TCM signs. These are based on the participants' feelings and assessor's subjective judgment.
