A secondary aim of the study was to determine if echocardiographic parameters were different between pacing modalities. We hypothesized that VDD would most closely track the intrinsic sinus rate for all activities and that echocardiographic dimensions would be different between AV asynchronous (VVI, VVIR) and AV synchronous (VDD) pacing modalities.",

            "text": "Dogs were prospectively recruited following implantation of a St. Jude dual-chamber pacemaker system for 3AVB; dogs with evidence of sinus node dysfunction or clinically important arrhythmias other than 3AVB were excluded. All dogs were programmed to VDD at study entry. The average, lowest and highest heart rates during VDD pacing were determined; the average heart rate was programmed as the base rate for VVI and VVIR. The highest heart rate was programmed as the upper tracking rate for VVIR with a threshold of 2.5, slope of 16, and fast reaction and recovery times. The rest function was used for all pacing modalities and was programmed to the lowest heart rate during VDD pacing; if the lowest heart rate was at the lower rate limit, then the rest rate was programmed 20% slower. Dogs were randomly assigned to VVI or VVIR after initial VDD interrogation and echocardiography (2D, Doppler, TDI). Ambulatory ECGs were recorded for 36 hours and the owners were instructed to record the time and duration of 5 specific activities: (1) urination/defecation, (2) eating, (3) sleeping, (4) walking, and (5) play. After three months, echocardiography was repeated, the dog was crossed over to VVI or VVIR pacing, and ambulatory ECG monitoring was repeated. After three additional months, echocardiography was repeated, the pacing modality was programmed to VDD and ambulatory ECG monitoring was repeated. Atrial rate, ventricular rate, and atrialto-ventricular ratio were determined for each of the 5 activities after an initial 12 hours acclimatization period. This is an ongoing study and currently 6 dogs are enrolled where 5 dogs have completed the VVI phase, 4 dogs have completed the VVIR phase, 4 dogs have completed both the VVI and VVIR phases, and 1 dog has completed all VVI, VVIR, and VDD phases. Atrial rates and atrial-to-ventricular ratios for VVI, VVIR, and VDD at each activity are as follows: urination/defecation (156.0 AE 42.9, 2.01 AE 0.39),(134.4 AE 24.0, 0.95 AE 0.14), (105.7, 1.0); eating (116.4 AE 20.8, 1.51 AE 0.23),(126.2 AE 11.7, 0.97 AE 0.22), (95.7, 1.0); sleeping (99.1 AE 38.3, 1.32 AE 0.62),(79.8 AE 15.7, 0.88 AE 0.30), (51.5, 0.76); walking (183.2 AE 24.7, 2.4 AE 0.41), (157.4 AE 38.9, 1.09 AE 0.12), (91.4, 1.0); play (125.4 AE 38.3, 1.66 AE 0.61),(105.8 AE 17.0, 0.83 AE 0.07), (108.9, 1.0). Echocardiographic data is available for all 6 dogs in VDD, 4 dogs in VVIR, and 2 dogs in VVI.

Clopidogrel is considered mainstay therapy for the prevention of cardiogenic thromboemboli in cats and has been shown to be superior to aspirin. Clopidogrel is a pro-drug and requires hepatic bioactivation through cytochrome p450 for formation of the clopidogrel active metabolite (CAM), which is unstable and challenging to quantitate. After bioactivation, CAM binds to the ADPreceptor on platelets and inhibits platelet aggregation. Recently, a method to stabilize CAM in human plasma has been developed by adding 2-bromo-3'methoxyacetophenone (BMAP) to blood tubes. Once stabilized, the derivatized CAM (CAM-D) can be quantitated using high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS).",

MRS may provide a useful tool in the evaluation of drug therapy on the cardiac energetics of MR in dogs. Corin is expressed by cardiomyocytes and converts pro-natriuretic peptides to their mature forms, which play a key role in fluid homeostasis and cardiac remodelling. In mice and human with failing hearts, myocardial corin protein levels have been reported to be increased, however without a concomitant increase in corin activity. These findings can partly explain the clear paradox in congestive heart failure (CHF) in that the natriuretic peptides are elevated, yet the body is fluid retaining (ultimately resulting in CHF). Interestingly in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, 2 loci associated with development of myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) have been identified. Corin is on one of these loci on the latest dog assembly. This further raises the question whether deficiencies in myocardial corin expression or activity could be a mechanism explaining the progression of heart disease and CHF in dogs as well. The purpose of this study therefore was to characterize the immunohistochemical expression of corin in myocardial tissue in normal dogs and in dogs with severe MMVD.",

Recent evidence suggests that antigen-antibody complexes in canine serum may preclude accurate diagnosis of heartworm disease with commercially available Dirofilaria immitis antigen assays. The objective of this study was to determine whether normal dogs presenting to the Oklahoma State Veterinary Teaching Hospital Community Practice Service for annual veterinary care warrant heat treatment of serum to confirm a negative heartworm antigen test by 4DX Snap (Idexx). Serum and EDTA samples were collected from 201 clientowned pet dogs between December 2014 and October 2015. Dogs ranged in age from 10 months to 15 years (median 4 yrs) and included 108 males and 93 females. Complete survey results (available for 194/201 dogs) revealed 139 dogs (72%) received heartworm preventative regularly over the past year. All EDTA samples were evaluated for microfilaria and serum samples for D. immitis antigen before and after heat treatment using a commericial assay (DiroCHEK, Zoetis). Four dogs (2%) tested positive for D. immitis antigen on 4DX Snap Test (Idexx) and 2 were microfilaremic.

Early identification of dogs predisposed to developing CHF is critical to improve long term survival outcome. The aim of this study is to characterize plasma molecular profiles in dogs with CHF secondary to MMVD and to develop novel molecular biomarkers via liquid biopsy. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs and have been known to regulate expression levels of target genes involved in human CHF.

Dogs with AT were commonly diagnosed concurrently with PLN. Contrary to previous reports, cardiac disease was not a common concurrent diagnosis in the dogs with AT included in this study. The function of right ventricle (RV) has gained increased recognition over the past years. In pulmonary hypertension (PH) patients, this led to the reconceptualization of the RV as part of right ventricular pulmonic circulation unit and the acknowledgement that RV function is a major determinant of prognosis in pulmonary arterial hypertension. With this in mind, we sought to investigate the RV systolic function in dogs with post-capillary PH ascribed to mitral valve disease (MVD). Twenty nine dogs with PH (2.5-17.2 kg; 7-15 years) and 51 dogs without PH (1.5-32.0 kg; 2-16 years) were recruited into this prospective cross-sectional observational study. The PH group was subdivided into mild PH (n = 19), moderate PA (n = 6), and severe PH (n = 4). Several breeds were represented. All animals underwent a complete echocardiogram, which included the measurement of RV fractional area change (RV FAC); tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE); RV free-wall longitudinal systolic velocity (tricuspid annular S\u00b4wave), and RV fractional shortening (RV FS % ). For improved statistical analysis and normalization of data according to animal size, a body weight-indexed TAPSE (TAPSE BW-indexed ) was created. Some standard echocardiographic indices of congestion and LV function, including early-to-late LV filling velocities ratio (E/A), isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT), E-to-IVRT ratio (E/IVRT), left atrium-to-aorta ratio (LA/Ao), and LV fractional shortening (LV FS % ) were recorded as well. The data was not normally distributed. The Mann-Whitney test showed no differences (P > 0.05) to exist for RV FAC, RV FS % , TAPSE, TAPSE BWindex , and tricuspid annular S\u00b4wave between dogs with PH and those without PH. Also, the analysis of the subdivided PH group showed no statistical difference between the three degrees of PH. Spearman correlation coefficients between RV systolic data and LV indices of congestion and function showed a significant positive correlation between TAPSE and E/IVRT (R = 0.3917, P = 0.0003), TAPSE and LA/Ao (R = 0.3298, P = 0.0029), and TAPSE BW-indexed and LV FS% (R = 0.2757, P = 0.0166). Finally, a significant positive correlation was documented between RV FAC and RV FS % (R = 0.3507, P = 0.0100), as well as between TAPSE and tricuspid annular S\u00b4wave (R = 0.4575, P < 0.0001). Because only a few animals with severe PH were recruited into this study, the absence of association between the severity of PH and the identification of RV systolic impairment needs further investigation. Nevertheless, we observed a downward trend for RV FS %, TAPSE, TAPSE BW-indexed , and tricuspid annular S\u00b4wave along with the aggravation of PH. Our study found correlations between a few congestion and LV function parameters, which may prove useful in monitoring RV function in dogs with severe MVD and overt signs of post-capillary PH. Since the majority of PH cases were mild, it is likely that only a few had reactive PH, which may explain why RV function of either group behaved very similarly. Also, it is not clear whether RV remodeling and impairment would be stronger if pre-capillary PH dogs had been included in this investigation. Decreased heart rate variability (HRV) has been found in dogs in congestive heart failure (CHF) and previous studies have acknowledged the use of HRV indices as prognostic indicators in patients with mitral valve disease (MVD). The vasovagal tonus index (VVTI) is an unconventional time domain indicator of HRV, which is mainly influenced by cardiac parasympathetic tone. In this cross-sectional observational study, we sought to investigate the VVTI in dogs with MVD. Electrocardiographic recordings of 30 dogs (7-16 years, 3.5-15.5 kg) previously classified into ACVIM stages A (controls), B, or C (10 dogs each group) were used to calculate the VVTI. For this, 20 consecutive R-R intervals were measured from each ECG recording (R-R1 to R-R20), and the index was obtained from the formula VVTI = LN [VAR (R-R1 -R-R20)], where LN: natural logarithm and VAR: variance. Bad quality ECG tracings and recordings from dogs with non-sinus rhythms or animals undergoing anti-arrhythmic treatment were not included in this investigation. Also, we recorded the BW-indexed LV in diastole and systole, wall stress index in diastole and systole, fractional shortening, left atrium-to-aorta ratio, mitral E wave, mitral E/A, isovolumetric relaxation time, and the E-to-IVRT ratio. All data underwent the Shapiro-Wilk test to check for normal distribution, while ANOVA, followed by Tukey's test, were used to compare the VVTI between groups. Pearson's test was used to search for linear correlations between the VVTI and the echocardiographic data. The mean values (with lower and upper 95% CI of mean) of VVTI for dogs in stages A, B, and C were, respectively: 8.45 (7.36 -9.54), 6.09 (4.47 -7.71) and 6.34 (5.01 -7.68). A significant difference was found between groups (P = 0.0189), with the mean VVTI being significantly higher in control animals as compared to dogs with stage B MVD (P < 0.05). When it comes to the relationship between VVTI and cardiac rhythms, a significant difference existed between animals in sinus rhythm (SR), sinus arrhythmia (SA), and sinus tachycardia (ST) (P = 0.0083). The lowest VVTI was documented for dogs in ST (5.82; 95% CI 4.14 -7.49), while the higher was found for animals presenting SR (8.27; 95% CI 7.40 -9.15). Significant negative correlations were found between VVTI and LA/Ao (R = \u00c00.3699; P = 0.0443), as well as between VVTI and heart rate (R = \u00c00.4864; P = 0.0064). Although no correlation existed between body weight and the VVTI, age and VVTI attained a significant negative correlation (R = -0.3827; P = 0.0369). The negative correlation between VVTI and heart rate is likely ascribed to the role played by the parasympathetic tone in VVTI, therefore producing higher values when slower rates and irregular rhythms are present. Even though uncontrolled conditions during ECG recording, including stress and agitation, may increase HR, the lower VVTI found in animals exhibiting sinus tachycardia may suggest a sustained sympathetic activation. Although further investigation is warranted, the confidence intervals of this study point to the VVTI <5 being a potential prognostic indicator for CHF, whereas a VVTI >7.7 is likely suggestive of reduced risk for congestion. This is supported by the correlation between VVTI and LA/Ao, as well as the difference between the means of control dogs (stage A) and stage B MVD animals. (6%), Poodle (6%) and Dachshund (6%), besides a mongrel dog (6%). There was a predominance of female dogs (71%). The most common clinical manifestations observed were syncope (71%), presyncope (24%), dyspnea (18%) and exercise intolerance (12%). Twelve percent of the dogs were asymptomatic. The most frequent electrocardiographic changes found were sinus arrest (75%), junctional escape rhythm (73%), supraventricular tachycardia (53%) and sinus arrhytmia (53%). Forty-seven percent of the dogs presented tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome. Only 24% of the animals received pacemaker implants, given the high percentage of animals unable to go through chirurgical/anesthetic procedures (29%), and the presence of asymptomatic animals. The dogs that received pacemaker implants lived for 20.4 months (mean value), whereas the ones that were treated conservatively lived for 10.8 months (mean value). These values showed benefit to those patients who received pacemaker implants, but was hindered by the high percentage of comorbidities in older animals, besides the small number of patients enrolled in this retrospective study.",

Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan Echocardiographic assessment of the severity of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is less reliable compared to mitral regurgitation due to the complicated geometry and function of right ventricle. Spectral Doppler of hepatic veins (SDHV) has emerged as a useful examination to evaluate the severity of TR in humans. The hepatic vein blood flow waveform is multiphasic and typically consisted with four peaks. A small retrograde a-wave occurring after the Pwave of the electrocardiographic is created by retrograde blood flow during atrial contraction. A large anterograde S-wave occurring immediately after the QRX complex is created by blood flow toward the heart during ventricular systole. A small retrograde vwave occurs after ventricular systole. A large anterograde D-wave occurring after T-wave is created by ventricular diastole. The objective of the present study was to investigate the correlation between the presence of ascites and the findings of SDHV in dogs with TR. This is a clinical cohort study including twenty-seven client-owned dogs with TR. Dogs were divided into two groups based on the presence of ascites. Physical examination, SDHV and echocardiographic variables were compared between the groups. For the assessment of the comparative accuracy in identifying patients with ascites, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was used. Peak velocity of v-wave and D-wave in dogs with ascites (n = 11) was significantly higher than dogs without ascites (n = 16). The highest accuracy was obtained for v-wave, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.99, followed by D-wave, with an AUC of 0.95; late diastolic velocity of the septal mitral annulus (Am), with an AUC of 0.907. TR peak velocity had no significant difference between two groups. In conclusion, v-wave and D-wave obtained by SDHV has strong correlation with the presence of ascites in dogs with TR. Event monitors are a useful diagnostic tool for evaluating patients with episodic cardiac events. The ideal event monitor for use in veterinary practice would be non-invasive, affordable, accurate and reusable. Such devices are becoming increasing difficult to obtain. This study aimed to prospectively evaluate the feasibility of using the Medtronic Reveal LINQTM human implantable cardiac monitor (ICM) for cutaneous event monitoring for up to 5 days in 14 clinically healthy canines (21.5 kg, range 13.4-31.2 kg; 4.5 years range 1.5-13 years old) and two canines with reported collapse episodes (4.7 and 6.4 kg, 2.5 and 11 years old). The study consisted of developing a method to secure the low-profile device without causing discomfort at the location generating the strongest signal, adjusting the auto activation parameters, activating the device manually, and assessing the recordings for accuracy.",

Subaortic stenosis (SAS) is the most common congenital cardiac defect identified in dogs. While it is not difficult to diagnose severe forms of this disease, treatment and decisions on when to consider interventional therapy remain a challenge. It has been suggested that SAS, in some breeds, may be related to an abnormally steep aortoseptal angle (AoSA) -a quality which may limit efficacy of ballooning methods. If an abnormally steep AoSA contributes to SAS and is not remedied by ballooning, it is possible that the magnitude of the AoSA may serve as a useful criterion for determining which dogs will respond better to balloon valvuloplasty and are therefore better candidates for the procedure.",

Two board-certified veterinary cardiologists and 1 novice evaluated these video loops to identify still frame images to be used to measure the AoSA. Each evaluator was blinded to the other 2 evaluators' selected images and subsequent measurements of the AoSA. All evaluators were blinded to initial PG and patient outcomes following the procedure. The percentage decrease in PG at 24 hours, 6 months, and 12 months after ballooning was then calculated and correlated to the measured AoSA at each recheck and for each imaging plane.",

However, further investigation of the effect of LVOT PG reduction on survival times and quality of life is warranted in order to determine if AoSA is truly a suitable criterion for selecting candidates for CB/HPBV. Cardiomyopathies, including hypertrophic and restrictive, are the most common acquired cardiac diseases in cats. Many affected cats develop pulmonary edema secondary to left-sided congestive heart failure (L-CHF). Alternatively, cats with primarily left-sided cardiomyopathy can develop pleural effusion without the presence of pulmonary edema. It is well known, but not well understood, why cats with left-sided CHF can develop both pulmonary edema and pleural effusion. The development of pulmonary hypertension could lead to right-sided heart failure and potentially cause pleural effusion in cats with predominately left-sided cardiac disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate for echocardiographic evidence of pulmonary hypertension in cats in L-CHF with pleural effusion in comparison to cats with pulmonary edema, other pulmonary disease, and healthy cats.",

In human, post-operative dysrhythmia is an important complication after cardiac surgery, a major cause of increasing mortality and lengthening hospitalization. In veterinary field, however, there is little knowledge on rhythmic disturbances complicated by cardiac surgery. The aim of this study is to characterize post-operative arrhythmias and to determine peri-operative predisposing factors to arrhythmias in dogs with open-heart surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). This is a prospective and observational study of 70 consecutive dogs undergoing mitral valve repair surgery. The incidence and the types of post-operative arrhythmias were determined by continuously monitoring electrocardiogram for the first 7 days during hospitalization. Occasional premature atrial or ventricular beats were considered insignificant. Serologic and blood-gas parameters measured at serial time points during CPB were normalized and compared between two groups with non-arrhythmic and arrhythmic episodes. All patients showed normal sinus rhythm before surgery. 32 patients (45.7%) had a total of 55 episodes of arrhythmia after cardiac surgery, where ventricular arrhythmias were the most frequently identified (26 of 55; 47.3%). Supraventricular, nodal arrhythmias and conduction blocks accounted for 23.6%, 14.5% and 14.5%, respectively. 53.2% of patients with arrhythmic episodes were recovered to normal sinus rhythm within the first 2 days after surgery. Patients with persistent arrhythmia until discharge were 18.8% (6 of 32). There was no case that permanent pacemaker should be implanted. Although intravenous bolus injection of lidocaine (2 mg/kg) was applied to 2 dogs with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia lasted until 7 days, no improvement was found. No hospital deaths were caused by post-operative arrhythmias (deaths in hospital; 1 respiratory failure, 2 embolic events). Furthermore, the arrhythmic group showed longer duration of CPB (107.2 AE 33.6 minutes, P < 0.05) and aortic cross-clamping time (59.9 AE 13.3 minutes, P < 0.01), and lower glucose level normalized by CPB duration (82.6 AE 38.9 mg/dL/CPB time, P < 0.01), compared to the non-arrhythmic group (CPB time, 90.3 AE 25.7 minutes; cross-clamping time, 50.1 AE 20.6 minutes; normalized glucose level, 126.8 AE 66.7 mg/dL/CPB time). Also, logistic regression model for the probability of post-operative arrhythmias revealed significant effects of the aortic cross-clamping time and the normalized glucose level (adjusted R 2 =0.30, P < 0.001).",

Canine degenerative myelopathy (DM) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder. Clinical progression is homogeneous within and across breeds, thus four distinct disease stages have been identified (Kanazono et al., 2013; Coates and Wininger, 2010) . DM shares similarities with some forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), including underlying mutations in superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1). SOD1-mutant microglia play a central role in ALS progression in rodent models. Microglia behavior is complex, as expression patterns of classic M1 and M2 molecules are variable throughout disease and between species studied. The mechanism(s) underlying microglial phenotype determination within ALS is not known. Fractalkine, a neuronally produced chemokine, has been shown to suppress SOD1 mutant microglial-mediated neurotoxicity in vitro. Thus, fractalkine is a possible contributor to microglial phenotype determination in ALS. Increased spinal cord microglia have been documented in end-stage DM-affected dogs, however, their response and phenotype throughout disease progression is unknown. The goals of this study were to (1) quantify and phenotype microglial cells in close proximity to lumbar spinal cord motor neurons of DM-affected dogs at each disease stage and compare these findings to age-matched, neurologically normal dogs and (2) correlate microglial phenotype with fractalkine protein levels in lumbar spinal cord throughout disease progression.",

Canine degenerative myelopathy (DM) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder with four defined disease stages. DM initially manifests as spastic upper motor neuron paraparesis and general proprioceptive ataxia (stage 1). Progressive neurodegeneration results in non-ambulatory paraparesis/paraplegia (stage 2) and thoracic limb paresis (stage 3). End-stage disease culminates in flaccid tetraplegia, widespread muscle atrophy and signs of brainstem dysfunction (stage 4). The clinical spectrum of DM is homogeneous within and across breeds. Phosphorylated neurofilament heavy (pNF-H), a major structural protein of myelinated motor axons, has shown promise as a prognostic biomarker in other diseases of the nervous system such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

Juvenile onset seizures are defined as seizures starting prior to 12 months of age for this study. The aims of this study were to 1) identify the common etiology and 2) describe the outcome (dead or alive) in cats with juvenile onset seizures. Inclusion criteria were 1) a confirmed or suspected seizure before 12 months of age and 2) complete medical records including a final diagnosis. The diagnosis was reclassified for each cat according to the 2010 ILAE guidelines. Fifteen cats met the inclusion criteria. Median age at onset was 24 weeks (range, 0.4 -40 weeks). Six cats (40%) were diagnosed with structural epilepsy, 5 cats (33%) were diagnosed with unknown epilepsy, and 4 cats (26%) were diagnosed with reactive seizures. Generalized seizures were documented in 9 cats, 4 cats had focal seizures and 2 cats had both focal and generalized seizures. Six cats (40%) had cluster seizures, and status epilepticus was documented for 1 cat. Overall 8 cats (53%) were alive, 6 cats were dead and 1 cat was lost to follow up. (Follow up 16 -173 months after diagnosis) Three cats died, or were euthanized, secondary to seizures or the underlying diagnosis and 3 cats died or were euthanized unrelated to their seizures or seizure diagnosis and 1 cat died due to unknown causes. Primary genetic epilepsy is the most common cause of seizures in dogs, reportedly affecting 0.5-5.7% of the population. There have been several investigations regarding the serum concentrations of trace nutrients, including copper, selenium, zinc, manganese, and iron in human epileptics and animal models. However, no research of this nature is available in dogs with primary genetic epilepsy.

Previous studies identified associations of Modified Glasgow Coma Scale (MGCS) and hyperglycemia with survival in veterinary patients with head trauma. Lactate is the product of anaerobic glycolysis, and hyperlactatemia has classically been associated with decreased tissue perfusion. Some studies in dogs with various diseases, including trauma, have showed that higher initial lactate concentration in dogs is associated with increased risk of mortality.

Recent experiments in laboratory rodents have suggested that the constituents of the fecal microbiome influence the activity of the immune system.

Thus, positive PCR for Bartonella spp. DNA in the CSF of dogs must be interpreted in light of number of RBCs within the sample as well as the presence of inflammation or systemic infection. Failure to amplify Bartonella spp. DNA from the CSF of the 67 dogs with inflammatory disease studied suggests the organism was not involved, the organism was in CNS tissues but not in the CSF, or the organism was present but in quantities undetectable by this PCR assay.

The study's other aims were to investigate if an association exists between increased anxiety related behaviors in the preictal and postictal phases of a seizure episode compared to the interictal period and whether dogs with refractory epilepsy have more severe seizures, which could account for the increased anxiety related behavioral side effects as reported in humans and dogs.",

We demonstrated activation of the Src pathway by FOSCC cells making Src a strategic therapeutic target that could be used in a clinical setting. Exposing FOSCC cells to dasatinib has inhibitory effects on cell proliferation, EGFR, and consistently decreased production of VEGF. Based on these results, dasatinib may have both anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic effects in FOSCC. Since EGF is able to partially rescue cells from the effects of dasatinib, future studies should evaluate dual target inhibition of Src and EGFR, EGFR and VEGFR, as well as combining Src inhibition with standard chemotherapy agents. Oral melanoma (OM) has a high propensity to metastasize to regional lymph nodes (LN) and lungs. Surgery and/or radiotherapy (RT) are effective local treatments, however most dogs succumb to distant metastasis.

Hume 1 . 1 Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA, 2 Michigan State University, MI, USA Feline injection site sarcoma (FISS) is an aggressive neoplasia that remains a challenge for clinicians. Radical surgery is the first choice treatment but is not always feasible. Chemotherapeutic responses have been documented but are generally of short duration; tumors often develop resistance quickly. Salinomycin is an ionophore that has been shown to inhibit cancer stem cells and to increase the sensitivity of human soft tissue sarcoma cells to doxorubicin chemotherapy. The aim of our study was to determine if salinomycin could be used to increase the sensitivity of FISS cell lines to doxorubicin. Two primary cell lines cultured from feline patients with histologically confirmed FISS were used for this purpose. Since the threshold response to doxorubicin differs, we ranked the cells according to the sensitivity to doxorubicin and used one sensitive line (C10) and one resistant line (B4). Cell viability assays (MTT) were used to determine the response to single agent and combination therapy. Three independent assays were performed, with samples evaluated in triplicate in each assay. Student's t-tests were employed to compare the results of individual doxorubicin concentrations with and without salinomycin combination therapy. Addition of 5 uM salinomycin resulted in a statistically significant (P < 0.05) reduction in cell viability compared to single agent doxorubicin at multiple concentrations for both cell lines. Our results highlight a potential chemotherapy protocol for the treatment of FISS. Further investigations need to be pursued to define the effect of this novel therapeutic combination and to validate our results in vivo. Canine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) occurs in approximately 30-100/100,000 dogs per year and accounts for up to 83% of canine hematopoietic cancers. Standard-of-care treatment for canine NHL comprises multi-drug chemotherapeutic protocols. 60-85% of dogs enter a complete clinical remission following induction chemotherapy, and median first-remission durations range from 140 to 385 days. Resistance to chemotherapy increases with each subsequent relapse and less than 10% of patients survive longer than 2 years from diagnosis. To prolong overall survival, more effective therapies are required to prevent relapse following successful induction chemotherapy. Directing the immune system to specifically target malignant cells is a powerful strategy in the treatment of cancer. We have previously developed a vaccine strategy that utilizes autologous CD40-activated B cells as antigen-presenting cells electroporated with autologous tumor RNA as the antigenic payload to stimulate anti-tumor immunity in dogs with NHL. In our first clinical trial, we showed that dogs vaccinated three times at three week intervals following successful induction chemotherapy had a tendency towards prolonged remission times and overall survival when compared to historical controls. Furthermore, vaccinated dogs that did relapse showed a statistically significant increase in overall survival following rescue chemotherapy. These results coupled with immune analysis from vaccinated patients suggested that while RNA loaded CD40-activated B cells primed an anti-tumor immune response, it was insufficient to maintain remission. Furthermore, we hypothesized that rescue chemotherapy boosted vaccine primed tumor-specific immunity and lead to prolonged second remission times. We therefore hypothesized that repeat administrations of RNA-loaded CD40-activated B cells given every 2 months following an initial priming course would maintain anti-tumor immunity and prevent relapse.",

At the time of diagnosis, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and malignant lymph node tissue are harvested to generate CD40-activated B cells and whole tumor RNA respectively. Dogs then undergo a 19-week CHOP-based chemotherapy protocol. Only dogs in complete clinical remission following induction chemotherapy are eligible to receive the autologous vaccine. Dogs are vaccinated every three weeks for three doses, and then every two months until clinical relapse.

Biologic activity of this drug is evident in the studied cats, however further prospective studies are needed to fully elucidate its role in treatment of this condition. Gastrointestinal is the most common anatomical form of lymphoma in cats and systemic chemotherapy is indicated for the treatment. Although most of cats can achieve a complete remission with chemotherapy, relapse can occurs and may be associated to the multidrug resistance (MDR). Cell mechanisms of MDR include activation of transmembrane proteins, that reduce intracellular concentrations of different chemical compounds, and alterations in drug target. The main protein related to MDR phenotype is P-glycoprotein. Its overexpression results in reduced concentration of certain drugs within the cell, which is linked to the resistance. The aim of this study was to investigate P glycoprotein (P-gp) expression in cats with T-cell lymphocytic gastrointestinal lymphoma. Immunohistochemistry was performed in 40 samples using the monoclonal antibodies mouse anti-PAX-5 (PAX5-Invitrogen), polyclonal rabbit anti-CD3 (DAKO) and mouse anti-P-glycoprotein (clone C494-Enzo Life Sciences). P-gp immunoreactivity was analysed by degree of staining intensity, between 0 (no expression) to 3 (strong expression). Lymphoma was considered to be positive for P-gp when more than 10% of the neoplastic population expressed the protein.

Introduction: Canine hemangiosarcoma is a highly malignant tumor, which is associated with poor long-term survival due to the development of early and widespread metastatic disease. Currently, little is known regarding the biology of canine hemangiosarcoma, and the mechanisms accounting for the highly metastatic nature of the tumor are poorly understood. In humans and rodents, monocytes have been shown to play key roles in metastasis through promotion of tumor cell extravasation, seeding, growth, and angiogenesis, as well as suppression of anti-tumor immunity. However, there has been little investigation into the role of monocytes in canine tumor metastasis. Therefore, we investigated the potential role of monocyte infiltration in the regulation of tumor metastasis in dogs.",

Margareth Rose Lederer 1 , Jacquie Rand 2 , Nubia Lopes 2 , John Morton 3 , Nick Jonsson 1 . 1 University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland, UK, 2 University of Queensland, Gatton, Qld, Australia, 3 Jemora Pty Ltd., Geelong, Vic., Australia Burmese cats are predisposed to diabetes mellitus in Australia, New Zealand and United Kingdom, and the disease is 3 to 4 times more prevalent in this breed compared to domestic cats. Mechanisms predisposing Burmese cats to diabetes remain unclear. This study compared hormonal and biochemical variables associated with glucose and lipid metabolism between mixed-age, lean to overweight, clinically healthy Burmese and non-Burmese cats. Burmese cats older than 3.5 years had higher fasting glucose compared to non-Burmese (P = 0.02), with 1.3 mmol/L higher at 3.5 years and 3.5 mmol/L higher at 10 years of age (P < 0.001), but not at 2 years of age. Mean and 2-hr glucose concentrations during a glucose tolerance test were higher in Burmese than non-Burmese cats (P < 0.006 to 0.031), indicating relative glucose intolerance. Lean Burmese cats had 4.8 lU/mL higher fasting insulin concentrations than non-Burmese, suggesting they are insulin resistant (P = 0.031). At time 10 minutes during the GTT, Burmese cats had lower insulin concentration compared to non-Burmese, but were higher at 120 minutes (P = 0.066 and P = 0.046). This is consistent with diminished first phase, and increased and prolonged second phase insulin release, a pattern of insulin secretion described in prediabetic, diabetic, obese humans and obese cats. Fasting triglyceride concentration was 0.2 mmol/L higher (P = 0.015) and fasting NEFA concentration was 0.18 mmol/L higher (P = 0.016) in Burmese compared to non-Burmese. These results demonstrate that Burmese cats have more rapid deterioration of b-cell function with age, and impaired glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism occur concurrently in these cats. Previous studies indicated that serum fructosamine level is decreased in hyperthyroid cats; however, its clinical utility in diabetic hyperthyroid cats was not reported. We hypothesized that hyperthyroidism in diabetic cats will result in a clinically significant decrease in serum fructosamine level compared to euthyroid diabetic cats. Data of serum total thyroxine (TT4) and fructosamine of hyperthyroid/euthyroid diabetic/nondiabetic cats from the New Zealand Veterinary Pathology and Colorado State University were retrieved and statistically analyzed. Serum fructosamine was significantly lower in hyperthyroid diabetic than euthyroid diabetic cats (mean 332 \u00b5mol/L 95% CI 291-379, n = 18 versus mean 527 \u00b5mol/L 95% CI 515-553, n = 186) while not different between hyperthyroid diabetic and euthyroid nondiabetic cats (mean 332 \u00b5mol/L 95% CI 291-379, n = 18 versus mean 321 \u00b5mol/L 95% CI 296-345, n = 128). There was a significant negative correlation between serum TT4 concentration and serum fructosamine and glucose concentrations (n = 659, P < 0.01, and n = 297, P < 0.01, respectively). Hyperthyroid cats (diabetic or not) had significantly (P < 0.05) lower serum glucose than euthyroid cats (diabetic or not). Diabetes and random variability accounted for 49.7% and 45.4% of the change in serum fructosamine; whereas, age (3.1%) and population (1.8%) had minimal impact on serum fructosamine. In conclusion, in the current study, serum fructosamine concentration was significantly decreased in diabetic hyperthyroid cats and was similar to the fructosamine concentration in euthyroid nondiabetic cats. In addition, approximately 45% of the change in serum fructosamine was independent of diabetes. Future studies should be undertaken to explore specific factors that have an impact on fructosamine level. Insulin aspart (Aspart) is a rapid-acting insulin analog that has been shown to be an effective treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) when administered by intermittent subcutaneous (SC) injection in humans. In cats, rapid-acting insulin analogs have not yet been evaluated, and the most commonly used protocols for DKA involve delivery of regular insulin via constant intravenous infusion, which can be technically challenging. The aim of this study was to determine the pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of Aspart following SC and intramuscular (IM) injections in healthy cats.",

While we observed a significant reduction in fasting glucose, overall insulin sensitivity did not improve. These findings might be explained by the fact that insulin sensitivity in normal weight subjects is mainly determined by liver and muscle cell function, while altered adipocyte size would not contribute significantly to the ITT. Future studies in obese cats and altered dosing regimes are required to assess whether THBA improves insulin resistance in cats, in addition to direct effects on adipocyte size. In this study, 8 overweight cats were fed a maintenance diet (MD) for 3 weeks followed by a weight control diet (WCD, lower fat, higher in carbohydrates and fiber). Cats were fed ad libitum initially and then food was restricted to achieve 1-2% loss of body weight weekly (11 weeks). When lean, cats were fed MD for 2 additional weeks.

Hyperthyroidism commonly affects geriatric cats, but its aetiology is poorly understood. Previous studies have shown Siamese, Himalayan and Burmese cats to have reduced risk of developing hyperthyroidism. These breeds have colourpoint coats as a result of temperature-sensitive mutations in the tyrosinase gene, which limit conversion of tyrosine to melanin pigment. Tyrosine is essential for synthesis of both melanin and thyroid hormones and, as such, coat pigmentation may impact relative tyrosine availability for thyroid hormone production.

Many dogs are misdiagnosed with hypothyroidism because of the vague presenting signs and limitations of thyroid function tests, leading to inappropriate treatment with levothyroxine. During chronic supplementation, the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis (HPTA) is suppressed and may make it difficult to accurately determine thyroid function following withdrawal of levothyroxine. We sought to determine if the HPTA is suppressed following levothyroxine administration in euthyroid dogs and the time required for resolution of any suppression. We hypothesized that levothyroxine administration would suppress the HPTA in euthyroid dogs and that the HPTA would recover within 8 weeks in all dogs, regardless of the duration of treatment.",

It appears that assessing thyroid function tests 1 week after longterm levothyroxine supplementation may reliably establish dogs as being euthyroid. Autoantibodies directed against the P450 side chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc) have been recently described in a proportion of dogs affected with hypoadrenocorticism, consistent with an immune-mediated disease process. In humans affected with Addison's disease, autoantibodies can have a predictive value, being detected prior to clinical signs developing, and have been shown to persist post-diagnosis. Furthermore, an autoantibody positive status post-diagnosis has been associated with successful remission of Addison's disease following B-cell depletion with rituximab, suggesting active pathology in these cases.",

Whilst P450scc autoantibody positivity has been associated with sex, with females having a higher prevalence, there was no sex difference in persistence demonstrated. P450scc expression in the ovary may act as an additional source of antigenic stimulation in female dogs, explaining the later seroconversion observed in one individual. However, paralleling humans with Addison's disease, antibody persistence in dogs with hypoadrenocorticism might represent persistent pathology, due to residual antigenic stimulation and autoimmune inflammation in the adrenal gland. While hypoadrenocorticism, or Addison's disease, can occur in a dog of any breed at any age, certain breeds, including Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers (NSDTRs), have an increased incidence of the disease. Specifically in the NSDTR, there appears to be at least two forms of Addison's disease in the breed: a juvenile onset form (JADD) occurring in dogs under 1 year of age, and an adult onset form occurring in dogs at 4.5 years of age on average. JADD differs from adult onset Addison's disease, as it can be a multisystemic illness and appears to involve an autoimmune component. This is supported by the identification of a CD3+ T cell infiltrate in histologic sections of a JADD affected adrenal gland sample and that many cases are often affected with other autoimmune diseases, including immune-mediated hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, immune-mediated polyarthritis, and hypothyroidism. To identify a genetic basis of JADD, a genome-wide association study was performed using the Illumina Canine HD 173,000 SNP array with 14 NSDTRs diagnosed with Addison's disease less than 1 year of age and 33 healthy control NSDTRs over 6 years of age. All cases were definitively diagnosed through an adrenocorticotrophic hormone stimulation test. Genome-wide association analysis identified a 1.7 Mb associated haplotype on chromosome 27. Whole genome sequencing was performed on 2 NSDTRs with the associated haplotype, as well as 6 unaffected NSDTRs and 11 other dogs from 5 different breeds. Analysis of variants yielded 5 segregating SNPs in the associated region: 1 intergenic, 2 intronic, 1 coding, and 1 in the 3 0 untranslated region of a gene. The only coding variant, a missense mutation causing an amino acid change from a proline to a leucine, occurs in a currently uncharacterized gene, but is predicted to be damaging and deleterious based on sequence conservation. In summary, genome-wide association and whole genome sequencing analysis has identified a novel gene and mutation implicated in multi-organ autoimmunity and juvenile onset Addison's disease in the NSDTR. The adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test (AST), often used for the diagnosis of canine hyperadrenocorticism, has a wide range of sensitivity and specificity. Thus, we hypothesized that standardized negative feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenalaxis will result in large variability in the post AST serum cortisol concentrations. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the variability in the post AST serum cortisol in healthy dogs and to statistically examine parameters that may influence cortisol responses.",

The association between feline ionized hypercalcemia and its etiologies and clinical signs should be further explored in casecontrolled studies. Canine hypoadrenocorticism is a potentially life-threatening endocrine disorder characterized by glucocorticoid deficiency, with or without concurrent mineralocorticoid deficiency. The current standard for diagnosing hypoadrenocorticism is the ACTH stimulation test, but a simpler and less expensive test with similar accuracy would be desirable. Previous studies regarding the diagnostic utility of basal plasma or serum cortisol concentrations are limited by low numbers of affected dogs, and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) methods were not utilized to identify optimal cut-off points. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic utility of basal cortisol concentrations for the diagnosis of hypoadrenocorticism in a large number of dogs by constructing an ROC curve to identify optimal cut-offs for sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, the diagnostic utility was evaluated in two sub-populations of dogs: those with electrolyte abnormalities (Na:K ratio \u226428) and those without electrolyte abnormalities (Na:K ratio >28).",

Dogs that had received treatment for hyperadrenocorticism or recent glucocorticoid therapy were excluded. Five hundred and fourteen dogs met inclusion criteria, including 163 dogs with hypoadrenocorticism (post-ACTH stimulated cortisol concentration \u226455 nmol/ L). An ROC curve was constructed for basal cortisol concentrations using commercially available software. The area under the ROC curve was 0.991. The ROC curves were nearly identical when evaluating dogs with and without electrolyte abnormalities. Accuracy was optimal at 22 nmol/L, which provided a sensitivity and specificity of 96.9% and 95.7%, respectively. At cut-offs of 55 nmol/L and 4 nmol/L, sensitivity and specificity were 99.4% and 99.7%, respectively. Using a previously estimated prevalence of 15%, cut points of 55 nmol/L and 4 nmol/L resulted in negative and positive predictive values of 99.8% and 97.9%, respectively. Even at lower prevalence rates, positive predictive values remained high at low cut points. Results of this study reaffirm the high sensitivity and negative predictive value of basal cortisol concentrations for the diagnosis of hypoadrenocorticism. However, the high specificity and positive predictive values at low cut points could be of major importance for veterinary practitioners. Prospective studies are needed to further substantiate these findings. Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in pediatric felines. Thyroid hormones (TH) are essential for normal development of the nervous and skeletal systems. The paucity of information on TH levels and the inability to identify early histopathologic changes has led to CH underdiagnosis. The literature on TH levels in kittens is sparse and incongruent, comprised of mostly case reports. References state kitten total thyroxine (TT4) levels are 2 to 3 times higher than the adult cat TT4 level. They also make the assumption free thyroxine (fT4) levels are higher than the adult cat. An abstract was previously presented showing kitten TH levels did not exceed the adult cat normals. These values were measured with assays that are no longer used. The normal pediatric TH levels must be evaluated with the newer and currently available assays. The purpose of this study was to determine the TT4, fT4, total tri-idiothyronine (T3), free tri-idiothyronine (fT3) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels in healthy kittens aged 2 through 16 weeks measuring levels at weekly intervals using the current available diagnostic methods.",

Recombinant DNA technology has been used to modify the structure of human insulin to yield analogs that are more rapidlyacting than regular insulin or have a longer duration of action than NPH insulin. The long-acting insulin analogs have been studied in cats and are routinely used to manage feline diabetics. More recently, the isoglycemic clamp method has been used to study the metabolic effect of a rapid-acting insulin analog in healthy cats. Generating time-action profiles to study the pharmacodynamic properties of insulin formulations does not require measurement of plasma insulin concentrations, but if measured, they provide useful pharmacokinetic data that can be used to validate the timeaction profiles. The Iso-Insulin ELISA (Mercodia AB, Uppsala, Sweden) is used to measure the concentration of insulin analogs in plasma.

This condition is most frequently observed in young dogs of Nordic breeds, and is thought to be related to abnormal adrenal gland function, with trilostane and melatonin having been proposed as possible treatment alternatives. This study aims to evaluate the comprehensive steroid panel and therapeutic response of Pomeranian dogs diagnosed with Alopecia X. Eighteen Pomeranian dogs admitted at veterinary clinics (S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil) with a chief complaint of symmetric and bilateral alopecia were studied. These included 12 males and 6 females, 16 of which were neutered, aging from 2 to 5 years. All animals were subjected to thorough laboratory screening: complete blood count with differential leukocyte count, liver function enzymes, urea, creatinine, triglycerides, cholesterol, blood glucose, and thyroid panel, as well as urinalysis and abdominal ultrasonography; all exam results were within the reference values. Subsequently, blood samples were collected to quantify by radioimmunoassay at Provet Laboratories (Brazil) and Tennessee University the following hormones, both before and after synthetic ACTH stimulation (single dose 0.05 mg/kg/EV): 17-hydroxiprogesterone, aldosterone, androstenedione, cortisol, estradiol, progesterone and testosterone. Eight dogs were then subjected treatment A (trilostane 1 mg/kg PO BID), seven dogs were subjected to treatment B (trilostane 1 mg/kg PO BID and melatonin 3 mg/dog PO BID) and two dogs received treatment C (melatonin 3 mg/dog PO BID); three animals were lost to followup. In comparison to reference values established by the laboratories for both neutered and non-neutered dogs, the animals with Alopecia X presented higher levels in three of the seven hormones both before and after the ACTH stimulation test. Abnormally elevated hormone levels were observed prior to and following ACTH stimulation in respectively: 3 (17%) and 16 dogs (89%) for 17hydroxiprogesterone, 9 (50%) and 10 dogs (55%) for androstenedione, and 2 (11%) and 16 dogs (89%) for progesterone. Also, the abnormally elevated testosterone levels were observed in 6 dogs (33%) prior to ACTH stimulation and 8 dogs (44%) following ACTH stimulation. Two dogs presented abnormally decreased estradiol levels, both prior to and following ACTH stimulation. On the other hand, abnormally elevated cortisol levels were observed in 3 dogs (17%) prior to ACTH stimulation, and these elevated levels were maintained by only one dog (6%) following ACTH administration. In contrast, all dogs had aldosterone levels within reference ranges, with the exception of one dog with slightly elevated aldosterone levels prior to ACTH stimulation. Of the dogs subjected to treatment A, four (50%) had complete hair regrowth and three (37.5%) had partial regrowth after three months of treatment. Of the dogs subjected to treatment B, one (14%) had complete hair regrowth, four (57%) had partial regrowth, and one (14%) did not show signs of regrowth. Treatment for one of the two dogs subjected to treatment C had to be withdrawn due to emesis. Pomeranian dogs affected by Alopecia X presented increased levels of 17-hydroxiprogesterone, androstenedione, testosterone and progesterone, both prior to and following stimulation with synthetic ACTH, suggesting an adrenal gland increased function in the sex hormones production. Due this, trilostane, as a steroidogenesis blocker, was found to be a positive therapeutic option for Alopecia X, with or without the association of melatonin. Phenotypic identification of cats at risk of developing diabetes has yet to be defined. Burmese cats are reported to have a dyslipidemia and are 3 to 4 times more likely to develop diabetes than other breeds.",

Some metabolites in carbohydrate metabolism were decreased (glucose, fructose, lactic acid), as were some involved in lipid metabolism (glucose 3 phosphate, phosphoric acid, stearic acid, cholesterol). When these metabolites were correlated with known measures of glucose metabolism, numerous amino acids were positively correlated with insulin and triglyceride (tyrosine, phenylalanine cysteine, proline, glutamine and arginine were all positively correlated with insulin, and tyrosine and phenylalanine were also correlated with triglyceride).

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common feline endocrinopathy and pathophysiologically similar to human type 2 diabetes (T2DM). T2DM occurs due to a combination of insulin resistance and b-cell dysfunction. Several studies have identified environmental and genetic susceptibility factors for T2DM.

Feces and blood were collected at day (D) 0, 21 and 42 in G1; and D0, 14, 28 and 42 days in G2 and G3. Microbial communities were analyzed by Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA genes, and the software PICRUSt was used to predict functional gene families. The serum and fecal metabolome was assessed by an untargeted approach combining various mass spectrometry platforms. All assessed parameters were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamin Hochberg adjustment, and an adjusted P < 0.05 was considered significant. No significant differences in any of the evaluated parameters were observed in G1 (control group). Also, in G2, the dietary switch to the hydrolyzed diet (between baseline and week 6) did not lead to any significant changes in any of the evaluated parameters. However, when dogs in G2 and the dogs in G3 received metronidazole, significant changes were observed. Because the responses in these 2 groups were similar, they were combined for statistical analysis. Microbiome structure and diversity were significantly altered between baseline and time of completion of metronidazole treatment, and also 4 weeks after end of metronidazole treatment (ANOSIM: P = 0.002). The most significant changes were increases in E. coli and decreases in Firmicutes. Functional gene families found to be significantly more abundant during antibiotic administration included: lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, glutathione metabolism, recombination and repair proteins, tryptophan metabolism, and fatty acid metabolism (P < 0.0001 for all).

Recently, studies in humans have suggested that in some patients with inflammatory bowel disease, microbial dysbiosis drives bile acid (BA) dysmetabolism. Primary BAs are synthesized by the liver and secreted into the intestinal lumen, where enzymatic reactions catalyzed by bacteria lead to BA biotransformation. Additionally, BAs participate in gastrointestinal mucosal defense. For example, secondary BAs have been shown to be anti-inflammatory as they have the potential to decrease the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a.

Further study is warranted to determine the impact of these changes on inflammation and metabolic disorders. Canine inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an immunemediated enteropathy likely triggered by environmental and immunoregulatory factors in genetically susceptible dogs. Previous studies suggest a pivotal role for intestinal bacteria in disease pathogenesis since luminal microbial composition is markedly altered at diagnosis. It has been suggested that probiotic bacteria are effective and promising agents for the treatment of IBD in humans and animals. However, the effects of probiotic bacteria that directly interact with the host's resident intestinal microbiota are poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of multi-strain probiotic VSL#3 supplementation (Visbiome; Exegi Pharma) at a dose of 50 billion bacteria/kg/day on the fecal and intestinal mucosal microbiota in dogs with IBD. Nineteen dogs diagnosed with moderate-to-severe IBD (CIBDAI \u2265 6) were randomized to receive standard IBD therapy (ie, elimination diet and prednisone) with or without probiotic VSL#3 for 8 weeks. Dogs were evaluated clinically at 0, 3, and 8 weeks and endoscopically and histopathologically at 0 and 8 weeks. The fecal and mucosal microbiota were investigated before and during treatment using 16S rRNA based quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), respectively. Both cohorts of IBD dogs showed a reduction in GI signs after 8 weeks of therapy compared to baseline CIBDAI scores (P < 0.05). Using qPCR, the placebo group failed to show significant changes in any of the bacterial groups analyzed. In contrast, VSL#3 treated dogs showed a significant (P = 0.001) increase in total lactic acid bacteria (Bifidobacteria, Streptococci, Lactobacilli) at treatment weeks 3 and 8 versus baseline values. Bifidobacteria were also significantly (P = 0.018) increased at 3 and 8 weeks post-VSL#3 treatment. FISH analysis showed that VSL#3 altered the number and spatial distribution of most colonic mucosal bacterial groups including total bacteria and the number of Bifidobacteria, Fecalibacteria, Lactobacilli, Streptococci, and Enterobacteriaceae (P < 0.05 for each). The number of mucusladen and attaching Bifidobacteria and Streptococci were also significantly (P < 0.05) increased in dogs receiving VSL#3. In conclusion, probiotic therapy of IBD dogs with VSL#3 increases the number of fecal and mucosal probiotic genera, especially the lactic acid bacteria. IBD dogs receiving standard therapy (placebo) showed little change in the composition of microbial communities despite exhibiting clinical improvement. Chronic enteropathy (CE) is a multi-factorial disease, which involves aberrant immune responses to commensal bacteria or dietary antigens. Although macrophages have been shown to play an important role in human disease very little information is available in dogs. CD163 is a scavenger receptor specific for macrophages, and has been detected in canine duodenum. The aim of this study was to determine if intestinal CD163 positive cell (CD163 + ) populations alter after successful treatment of CE. Calprotectin was used as an additional marker for macrophages. Dogs were prospectively enrolled and underwent standard diagnosis and treatment trial for CE. Duodenal biopsies were taken before and after long-term resolution of clinical signs (\u22652 months). Serial histologic sections were stained for CD163 (using AM-3K) and calprotectin. Positively stained cells in five villous and crypt regions were manually counted.

Fishers exact test revealed a statistically significant association of a positive pANCA or cANCA test with FRD (P < 0.0001). Inter-observer agreement for the assay was good (kappa 0.75). Furthermore, in 8 of the ANCA positive cases, it was possible to identify either MPO or PR-3 as antigens on the biochips.",

The data suggests that this assay could be used as an alternative to the canine assay for detection of ANCA in dogs. Citrulline, a non-proteinogenic amino acid, has recently been described as a biomarker of enterocyte function in humans. Decreased concentrations of plasma citrulline have been reported in patients with short bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, viral enteritis, or in critically ill patients. In dogs, the relationship between serum citrulline concentration and small intestinal dysfunction has not been well characterized. Citrulline is mainly synthesized from glutamine in enterocytes and is metabolized in the duodenum and jejunum. Therefore, intestinal injury can lead to decreased serum citrulline concentrations. The aims of this study were to analytically validate a GC/MS method for the measurement of citrulline in canine serum and to assess the concentration of this amino acid in dogs with chronic enteropathy.",

A block-randomized schedule was performed by an external statistician prior to the start of the study in March 2014. The study was approved by the Swedish Board of Agriculture and the Viikki Campus Research Ethics Committee, Finland. Serum cbl for follow-up was analyzed 28 AE 5 days and 90 AE 15 days after initiation of supplementation using an automated chemiluminescence immunoassay (Immulite 2000, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics). 41 dogs of 22 breeds were included with a median age of 6.2 (range 1.7-13.1) All of the dogs had symptoms of CE.

Impairment of gallbladder motility might be responsible for the pathogenesis of gallbladder mucocele and biliary sludge in dogs and the improvement of the gallbladder motility has a possibility to exert the preventive effects on the progression of the gallbladder diseases. However, little has been studied on the treatments to enhance the gallbladder motility in dogs. It was reported that 5-HT 4 receptor agonist improves gallbladder emptying in human gallstone patients, and that mosapride, which is a selective 5-HT 4 receptor agonist practically used for prokinetics of canine gastrointestinal disease, induces the increase of motilin, which is a physiological inducer of gallbladder motor activity. In this study, we investigated the effects of mosapride on the postprandial gallbladder motility and the plasma levels of motilin in dogs with or without biliary sludge.

Tritrichomonas foetus (Tf) is a flagellated protozoan parasite that is recognized as a significant cause of diarrhea in domestic cats with a prevalence rate as high as 30%. No drugs have been shown to consistently eliminate Tf infection in all cats.

Thus, CPs represent novel targets for the treatment of feline trichomonosis. However, cats also produce CPs that are part of life-critical systems.

In most dogs, the endoscopic appearance of the gastric mucosa was normal. Overall, the most common endoscopic lesions were erosions or ulcers and increased granularity of gastric mucosa. Gastritis was diagnosed histologically in 36.7% of dogs positive for Helicobacter spp. and in 41.7% of dogs without evidence of Helicobacter colonization. Severe lymphocytic-plasmacytic gastritis (11.1%) and acute purulent-necrotic gastritis (1.5%) were found in single HB infections and moderate lymphocytic-plasmacytic gastritis (14.3%) in single HH s.s. infections. An association between the presence of mixed infection (including HH s.s. and HB) and the lower severity of gastric inflammation was detected when compared to single Helicobacter species infection. This is a large study evaluating association of the individual Helicobacter species with histologically confirmed gastritis in dogs. Dogs are frequently colonized by Helicobacter spp. other than HP, and may represent a reservoir for human infection with non-HP Helicobacter spp. The combination of cytology and rapid urease test performed on gastric biopsy samples represents a reliable diagnostic method suitable for clinical practice.

Indices of individuality were low for all CAT variables, suggesting limited utility of population-based reference intervals for this assay. A method of objective quantification of clinical bleeding in canine immune-mediated thrombocytopenia (ITP) is needed because ITP patients have variable bleeding tendencies that do not directly relate to severity of thrombocytopenia. A consistent description of their bleeding would allow more direct comparisons of this bleeding heterogeneity in multi-institution studies. Application of a standardized bleeding assessment tool would help stratify ITP patients in clinical trials based on their bleeding severity to provide an objective comparison of patient outcomes among treatment protocols. In this study we aimed to develop and validate a daily canine ITP bleeding assessment tool (DOGiBAT) and to evaluate the utility of a training course for improving accurate implementation of the DOGiBAT.",

Aspirin is commonly used in an effort to prevent thrombus formation in dogs. High-dose aspirin (10 mg/kg, PO, q 12 h) reliably inhibits platelet function and thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2 ) synthesis, but can be associated with unacceptable side effects, including inhibition of prostacyclin synthesis, which counteracts the effects of inhibition of TXA 2 . Lower doses of aspirin, in contrast, inhibit platelet function and TXA 2 synthesis, have few side effects, and allow ongoing prostacyclin synthesis. However, low-dose aspirin therapy at standard dosage (0.5-1 mg/kg, PO, q 24 h), does not reliably inhibit platelet function, a phenomenon known as \"aspirin resistance\". Aspirin-associated platelet dysfunction has been shown to be highly dose-dependent, suggesting that traditional \"lowdoses\" of aspirin may be under-dosing canine patients. Our study used incremental increases in dosages to determine the dose of aspirin that consistently inhibited platelet function and TXA 2 synthesis without inhibiting prostacyclin synthesis.",

Additionally, even though all aspirin doses inhibited prostacyclin synthesis to some degree, there was no difference in prostacyclin concentration between a dose of 2 mg/kg, PO, q24 h and the traditionally used lower doses. Based on our results, an increased standard aspirin \"low-dose\" of 2 mg/kg, PO, q24 h may minimize the risk of aspirin resistance in dogs. There is a critical need for a biomarker that differentiates active primary immune mediated thrombocytopenia (pITP) from secondary causes of thrombocytopenia, and the concentration of which correlates with disease status in dogs. Such a biomarker would provide a valuable diagnostic tool to modulate therapy, evaluate risk of relapse, and reduce patient exposure to potentially harmful immunosuppressive medications. B cell activating factor (BAFF) is a cytokine within the tumor necrosis factor family that plays a crucial role in B cell maturation, survival, and class switching.

Each cat and dog had a saline assessment initially conducted to determine if pre-existing autoagglutination existed. Both major and minor cross matches were performed, with major defined as feline sera against canine RBCs and minor defined as feline RBCs against canine sera. All cross matches were performed via manual technique at 4, 25 and 37 degrees Centigrade. The end assessment of incompatibility was based on scored assessments of macroscopic or microscopic agglutination and/or hemolysis of RBCs. The first group of cross matches consisted of 19 blood Type A cats against five dogs. The dogs were selected to comprise a broad spectrum of the Dog Erythrocyte Antigen (DEA) possibilities. Each of the 19 cats had a major and minor cross match with each of the five dogs at all three temperatures for a total of 570 data points. None of the cross matches were compatible (100% incompatibility). To expand the database of canine bloodtypes, a second novel group of seven blood Type A cats were major and minor cross matched against ten dogs, five dogs of which were cohorts from the first set of cross match data. This yielded 420 data points for assessment of compatibility. Similar to the first data set, none of the cross matches were compatible (100% incompatibility). This data suggests there is an inherent incompatibility between dog and cat blood regardless of components tested. Clinicians contemplating canine to feline xenotransfusions should be cautious of utilizing this technique even in the presence of life threatening anemia.",

Recently, rapid thromboelastography (r-TEG) has been recognized as an overall evaluation of coagulation abnormalities in human medicine and become available faster than conventional coagulation tests (CCTs). Although r-TEG is becoming more generally used in human medicine, there are no studies describing the use of r-TEG in veterinary medicine. The objectives of this study were to 1) validation of r-TEG values with native and citrated WB samples from healthy dogs, and to compare stability and repeatability between two types of samples, and 2) examine whether the use of r-TEG could accelerate the coagulation pathway and decrease in taken time in comparison to kaolin activated TEG. Blood was collected from 16 clinically healthy Beagle dogs. TEG analysis was performed on kaolin-activated, citrated r-TEG, and native r-TEG blood samples.

Gallbladder mucocele is a commonly recognized form of gallbladder disease in the dog that is characterized by cystic mucinous hyperplasia and insidious accumulation of viscous bile and mucus within the gallbladder. Although several predisposing factors have been proposed, the underlying etiology of gallbladder mucocele formation is unknown. Previous studies have found limited associations with cholecystitis or bacterial infection. The aim of this study was to utilize culture-independent, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to determine the presence of bacteria in gallbladder mucoceles with and without concurrent cholecystitis.",

After cholecystectomy a median of 27% of dogs die before hospital discharge. The cause of GBM formation is unknown. Retrospective studies identify 14-17% of dogs with GBM have a diagnosis of hypothyroidism compared to 5-9% of normal dogs. Whether hypothyroidism is an independent risk factor for GBM formation or the consequence of an underlying metabolic syndrome is unknown. This distinction has important implications regarding the cause of GBM formation and may establish a rationale for diagnosis or treatment of hypothyroidism in these dogs. We undertook a prospective case controlled study of dogs newly diagnosed with GBM formation and lacking clinical signs of hypothyroidism to test a hypothesis that occult hypothyroidism exists at a high prevalence in these dogs and that the cause may differ from classic lymphocytic thyroiditis. Dogs diagnosed with GBM by ultrasound and healthy, age, breed and sex-matched dogs with normal gallbladder ultrasound were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included clinical evidence, prior diagnosis or treatment for hypothyroidism; drugs interfering with thyroid function, intact reproductive status, or emergent disease. Testing included a CBC, chem panel, UA, thyroid function testing including serum total T4, total T3, free thyroxine by equilibrium dialysis (FT 4 ), free triiodothyronine (FT 3 ), thyrotropin (TSH) and autoantibodies to T4AA, T3AA and TGAA. Dogs were stratified by disease severity into 1) no clinical signs, 2) mild clinical disease, 3) moderate to require hospitalization, and 4) severe requiring intensive care (incl. emergent surgery). Thyroid histology of GBM dogs and controls was examined by a pathologist blinded to the diagnosis. Parametric data were analyzed by t-test and non-parametric data by Mann-Whitney U test. P < 0.05 was considered significant. Of 106 screened dogs, 38 with GBM met study inclusion criteria and ranged in age from 6-16 years (median 10.5 yrs). Breeds included 11 Shetland sheepdogs, 4 Cocker Spaniels, 3 Chihuahuas, 3 Beagles, and 16 other pure breeds. Illness severity scores were: 37% absent; 21% mild; 21% moderate; and 21% severe. Of 18 healthy dogs screened, 12 were enrolled. Dogs with GBM had significantly lower serum T 4 (median 11, range 0-44 nM), T 3 (median 0.7, range 0-1.7 nM), FT 4 (median 15, range 1-27 pM), and FT 3 (median 3, range 0-10.5 pM) compared to control dogs. Relative to control dogs, dogs with GBM frequently had severely low individual thyroid hormone concentrations. Serum T4 was below reference range (RR) in 50% of GBM dogs compared to 8% controls. Four (10.5%) GBM dogs had a T4 = 0. Serum T3 was below RR in 47% of GBM dogs compared to 25% controls. Three (8%) GBM dogs had a T3 = 0. Serum FT4 was below RR in 12% of GBM dogs compared to 0% controls. Serum FT3 was below RR in 17% of GBM dogs compared to 0% controls. Significant differences in T4AA, T3AA or mean TSH were not identified. However 23.5% of GBM dogs and only 8% control dogs had an elevated TSH. Serum TGAA was elevated in 17% of control dogs and 0% of GBM dogs. No inflammation was detected in the thyroids of any of 12 dogs with GBM undergoing autopsy. These results identify a high prevalence of occult, often severe, decreases in individual serum thyroid hormone concentrations in GBM dogs. Influence of non-thyroidal illness must be considered for some of these abnormalities. Lack of serum TGAA and absent histologic inflammation in thyroids of GBM dogs is noteworthy. These findings suggest that an alternative mechanism for abnormal thyroid function in dogs with GBM should be considered. Hepatic fibrosis is an important complication of canine chronic hepatitis. To the authors' knowledge, the interobserver agreement associated with the histological scoring of fibrosis from canine hepatic biopsy specimens has not previously been reported. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the interobserver agreement for the histological scoring of canine hepatic fibrosis.",

Ryan Schultz, Rebecca Smedley, John Buchweitz, Katie Barnes, Sarah Abood, Daniel Langlois. Michigan State University College of Veterinary Medicine, East Lansing, MI, USA Canine copper-associated hepatitis (CCAH) has become an increasingly recognized cause of progressive and potentially fatal liver disease in dogs; however, the exact etiology remains unclear. To date, no broad epidemiologic investigations quantifying hepatic copper concentrations over time in both predisposed (to CCAH) and non-predisposed breeds have been conducted. The purpose of our study was to determine and compare quantitative hepatic copper concentrations in breeds that are, or are not, predisposed to CCAH from two study periods. We hypothesized that hepatic copper concentrations have increased for all dogs over time, but the relative increase will be greater in predisposed breeds. A retrospective search of the histopathology database at the Michigan State University Diagnostic Center for Population and Animal Health was conducted for two study periods: 1982 through 1988, and 2009 through 2015. Doberman Pinschers, Labrador Retrievers, and West Highland White Terriers were considered predisposed to CCAH. Dalmatians, Skye Terriers, and Bedlington Terriers were excluded from analysis due to a rarity of cases, limited information on predisposition, or a known genetic etiology, respectively. Cases with archived liver tissue available were randomly selected, reviewed, and then classified by breed and presence or absence of inflammatory liver disease. Hepatic copper concentrations (parts per million, dry weight basis) were measured in all specimens using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.

Independent of breeds groupings and inflammatory activity, mean hepatic copper concentrations in the recent time period were 225 ppm greater than those in the historical time period (P < 0.05). This effect was predominantly due an increase of 386 ppm over time in predisposed breeds (P < 0.001). The mean hepatic copper concentration of 338 ppm in non-predisposed breeds in recent years was greater than the mean hepatic copper concentration of 271 ppm in nonpredisposed breeds in the historical period, but this trend did not reach significance (P = 0.08). In the recent period, the mean hepatic copper concentration of 519 ppm in predisposed breeds with non-inflammatory liver histology was greater than the mean hepatic copper concentration of 297 ppm in non-predisposed breeds with non-inflammatory liver histology (P < 0.001). This difference was not observed in the historical time period. In both periods, dogs with hepatitis had higher hepatic copper concentrations than those without hepatitis, but this difference was magnified in recent years. In the aggregate, these findings confirm that hepatic copper concentrations have changed over time. The etiology of these changes is unknown, but suggestive of changes in environmental copper exposure. Detailed investigations of potential sources of copper exposure, namely drinking water and diet, are needed to further elucidate a potential environmental etiology. Additional investigations also are needed to determine if these changes are important for all breeds of dog. Borrelia burgdorferi (BB) and Anaplasma phagocytophilum (AP) are transmitted by Ixodes spp., and seroprevalence rates in endemic areas can be greater than 15% in dogs. A genetic predisposition to infection (Bernese mountain dogs) or clinical illness associated with BB has been suggested, particularly in people and dogs with Lyme nephritis (Retriever breeds). In vaccine studies, wild caught I. scapularis adults placed in feeding chambers and allowed to feed for seven days usually results in at least a 75% BB infection rate. Recently, an I. scapularis infestation study using a previously reported model and ticks with a similar BB carriage rate from the same collection area previously used, resulted in only a 29.2% infection rate. The purpose of this report is to describe the genetic relatedness of the dogs used in that study.",

This system may also be used for B. gibsoni treatment monitoring using a hybrid approach. For example, following initial diagnosis with either the POCKIT \u00d2 system or a commercial laboratory, the POCKIT \u00d2 system could be used for testing during treatment. Once a negative result was obtained, a sample could be submitted to a commercial laboratory to confirm treatment efficacy. Although this study focused on mass screening for B. gibsoni, the portable iiPCR platform has potential to aid in rapid detection of a variety of infections under field conditions. The efficacy of sarolaner (Simparica TM , Zoetis) to prevent transmission of Borrelia burgdorferi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum from infected wild-caught Ixodes scapularis to dogs was evaluated in a well-controlled laboratory study. Twenty-four purpose-bred laboratory Beagle dogs seronegative for B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum antibody were allocated randomly to one of three oral treatment groups: placebo administered on Days 0 and 7, sarolaner administered on Day 0 (28 days prior to tick infestation), or sarolaner administered on Day 7 (21 days prior to tick infestation). Sarolaner tablets were shaved and/or sanded based on each dog's individual bodyweight to provide a dosage of 2 mg/kg. On Day 28 each dog was infested with approximately 25 female and 25 male wild caught adult I. scapularis that were determined by random sampling to have infection rates of 57% for B. burgdorferi and 6.7% for A. phagocytophilum by PCR. In situ tick counts were conducted on Days 29 and 30. On Day 33, all ticks were counted and removed. Blood samples collected from each dog on Days 27, 49, 63, 77, 91 and 104 were tested for the presence of B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum antibodies using the SNAP \u00d2 4Dx \u00d2 Plus Test, and quantitatively assayed for B. burgdorferi antibodies using an ELISA test. Skin biopsies collected on Day 104 were tested for the presence of B. burgdorferi by bacterial culture and PCR. Acaricidal efficacy was calculated based on the reduction of geometric mean live tick counts in the sarolaner-treated groups compared to the placebo-treated group for each tick count.",

Historically, dogs on the island are endemically infected and infested with internal and ectoparasites, which are also associated with a number of vector-borne diseases. Due to the high prevalence of the vector Rhipicephalus sanguineus, it is not unusual to see high prevalence of Ehrlichia canis and Anaplasma platys.

This equates to more than 5 million cats affected by these preventable viruses and at risk for disease and premature death. Although vaccination plays a role in prevention, the cornerstone of control is identification and segregation of infected cats.

The two major human GHVs, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) are clinically important pathogens because those viruses possess tumorigenesis potential especially in immune-compromised patients. In feline practice, we often experience tumor cases, especially lymphomas. Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) was a major cause for the development of lymphoma in the past days, however, the majority of lymphoma cases are shifting to FeLVfree cats. But the mechanism of tumorigenesis in these \"spontaneously\" developed lymphomas has not been well understood. Under this situation, GHV became a candidate which explains the lymphomagenesis in domestic cats. Recent study identified a novel GHV in domestic cats (Felis catus GHV, FcaGHV), and epidemiological surveys found that FcaGHVs are distributing in several countries including the United States, Australia, Singapore, Germany and Austria. In the present study, a molecular epidemiological study was conducted to investigate the prevalence of GHVs in Japan using large numbers of samples which were previously used to a nation-wide epidemiological survey for two feline retroviruses in Japan (Nakamura Y et al., J Vet Med Sci, 72:1051-1056, 2010).",

In patients with characteristic clinical features, Canine Influenza H3N2 virus infection should still be considered as differential diagnosis. A study was conducted in dogs to evaluate the efficacy of an inactivated Canine Influenza Virus (CIV) H3N2 vaccine following experimental challenge with a virulent heterologous strain of CIV H3N2, isolated from the recent CIV H3N2 outbreak in the United States. Eleven dogs, 7-8 weeks of age, were vaccinated with 2 doses of an inactivated CIV H3N2 vaccine, 3 weeks apart, and 19 dogs were vaccinated with a placebo. Two weeks after the second vaccination, all dogs were challenged intranasally with virulent CIV H3N2 and then monitored daily for 10 days for clinical signs including fever, nasal discharge, sneezing, coughing, depression, and dyspnea. Nasal swabs were collected to evaluate viral shedding, and serum samples were collected at various time points to determine antibody titers. At necropsy, lungs were scored for consolidation. Following the booster vaccination, the placebo-vaccinated control dogs remained seronegative (<10) to CIV H3N2, while 10 of the 11 vaccinated dogs developed an antibody titer to CIV H3N2 (GMT = <80; Range = <10 -320). Antibody titers in dogs from both treatment groups increased following challenge, but the increase was greater in the vaccinated dogs (GMT = >1452; Range = 40 ->10,240). Following challenge, 8 (42%) of the 19 placebo-vaccinated control dogs were euthanized prior to the 10-day post-challenge observation period due to severe clinical signs, including difficulty breathing, depression, fever, and severe coughing with retching; whereas, none (0%) of the vaccinates had to be euthanized (P = 0.014). Clinical signs were evaluated based on a weighted scoring system. The mean clinical score for the placebo-vaccinated control group was 24.9, compared to only 8.7 for the vaccinated group (P = 0.036). The placebovaccinated control group shed CIV H3N2 virus for a mean of 1.9 days, compared to 1.4 days for the vaccinated group (P = 0.507). The median lung consolidation score for the placebovaccinated control group was 7.4, compared to 0.0 for the vaccinated group (P = 0.026). Results of this study demonstrate that this inactivated CIV H3N2 vaccine significantly protects dogs against severe clinical disease and lung consolidation associated with a virulent CIV H3N2 infection. Canine infectious respiratory disease complex (CIRDC) is caused by many different viruses and bacteria. In June 2015, veterinarians around Atlanta, Georgia and also western areas of North Carolina began to notice an unusual increase in dogs presenting to their clinics with signs of infectious respiratory disease. Nasal and pharyngeal swabs from dogs exhibiting clinical signs were submitted to the Animal Health Diagnostic Center (AHDC) at Cornell University. A canine respiratory polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening panel was utilized which allows identification of the following CIRDC pathogens: Bordetella bronchiseptica, Mycoplasma cynos, canine adenovirus 1 and 2, canine distemper, canine influenza A, H3N8 and H3N2, parainfluenza virus 5, pneumovirus and respiratory coronavirus.",

Six samples were excluded from sensitivity/specificity analysis because they failed to produce positive control lines on the VetScan \u00d2 Test, despite producing valid results on the other two in-clinic tests. Results were compared to the consensus reference method results for calculation of sensitivity and specificity.

The one dog in Group 2 that was positive for AP DNA on Week 25, was also positive on Week 24 prior to prednisolone administration. None of the other samples assessed by CBC and AP PCR assay after initiation of prednisolone administration showed evidence for activation of AP infection, suggesting that this protocol is unlikely to adversely affect dogs with chronic AP infection in the field. Whether other immune suppressive protocols would activate chronic AP infection remains to be proven. The only dogs that became AP seronegative by Week 48 were administered doxycycline, suggesting treatment may aid in the elimination of chronic AP infection, even after prednisolone administration. The objective of this study was to determine the proportion of feline calicivirus (FCV) field isolates that would be neutralized in vitro by sera from cats that were routinely vaccinated with a product containing two caliciviruses. Serum from cats hyperinoculated against 2 feline caliciviruses (FCV) has been shown to cross neutralize a greater proportion (90.2%) of 61 FCV field isolates from the United States when compared to serum from cats hyperinoculated with 1 FCV isolate (23.0%) At 8 and 11 weeks of age, each of the 44 kittens was administered an experimental vaccine containing modified-live panleukopenia, modified-live feline herpesvirus 1, and non-adjuvanted inactivated calicivirus strains FCV-255 and FCV-DD1.

Both dogs and humans are susceptible to this infection. In dogs common signs of the infection, such as lethargy, anorexia, lameness and fever, are non-specific. Differential diagnosis is supported by evidence of morulae or DNA, especially in acute cases, and by detection of specific antibodies using IFA or ELISA-based tests. 1 A related but distinct bacterium, A. platys, also infects dogs and causes infectious cyclic thrombocytopenia. 2 The present study compared the performance of two in-clinic rapid tests, the SNAP \u00d2 4Dx Plus \u00d2 Test (IDEXX), and the VetScan \u00d2 Canine Anaplasma Test (Abaxis).

Canine group settings, locations or events where dogs temporarily come together in a shared environment (e.g., shows, sporting events, dog parks) pose an increased risk for infectious disease transmission. Despite this increased risk, few guidelines exist to provide recommendations for reducing disease risk in these settings. During 2014-2015 a panel of canine infectious disease experts reviewed the current literature and drafted a set of 44 evidence-based recommendations for prevention of infectious diseases for dogs in group settings. In August 2015 a survey of attendees at the AKC Canine Health Foundation Parent Organization conference was completed to determine agreement with and perceived barriers to these recommendations. The 15-minute self-administered survey was provided to 238 Conference attendees and consisted of a series of Likert-type and open-ended questions (online and paper format) seeking feedback on 22 of the recommendations. The survey was completed by 185 individuals (78%), and all responses were reviewed, summarized, and open-ended comments categorized by theme. Respondents self-identified as: participants, judges, and breeders in a variety of local, national, and international canine group events. Most respondents (> 40%) agreed with all but three of the panel's recommendations, yet a majority of respondents stated the recommendations would be difficult or very difficult to implement in their setting (primarily dog shows). Common survey result themes related to difficulty of implementation included: administrative concerns (cost, human resources/manpower), enforcement issues, ethical concerns, privacy concerns, and strong need for official outreach to promote awareness and education related to canine infectious diseases. Survey responses identified needs for: further refinement of recommendations to aid comprehension and clarity (especially around ecto-and endoparasite control), and education to promote culture changes related to disease risk prevention. In order to raise awareness of canine infectious disease in group settings amoungst event participants, attendees, and organizers; an online freely available canine infectious disease risk calculator tool is being developed. Mycoplasma species are one of the most common infectious causes of conjunctivitis in cats. Mycoplasma felis is commonly implicated as a primary pathogen, but other Mycoplasma species have also been detected in clinically ill cats. Findings from previous studies using conventional PCR (cPCR) to investigate the role of Mycoplasma species in causation of feline conjunctivitis have been mixed as Mycoplasma can be carried by apparently normal cats. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine if increasing severity of conjunctivitis in cats correlates with higher Mycoplasma species copy numbers using qPCR.",

The determination of lactate and glucose threshold in dogs submitted to incremental exercise test (IET) is scarce. This study aimed (1) to determine the lactate and glucose thresholds (2) to investigate the acid-base responses of untrained dogs submitted to incremental exercise test. Fourteen Beagle dogs, 1-2 years old, healthy and untrained were used for determination of lactate and glucose thresholds and submitted to IET using treadmill, with slop from 5 to 7.5% and increasing speeds of 0.5 m/s every 5 minutes. The test was concluded when dogs presented fatigue signals. Blood samples were collected after 90 seconds of each effort step, though venous catheter placed in the jugular vein. The samples used for determination of acid-base alterations were collected in the moments before of IET, immediately and five minutes after the fatigue. Data were submitted to Shapiro-Wilk test, and the Pearson was used to correlate the running velocities corresponding to the lactate and glucose threshold and analysis between moments of assessment was performed by using repeated measures one-way ANOVA (P < 0.05). It was found high correlation between lactate and glucose threshold velocities, r = 0.84 (P < 0.01), and for pH, PCO 2 , HCO 3 \u00c0 strong ions difference (SID) were found moment effect (P < 0.001). The basal values of pH increased (P < 0.001) in fatigue (7.341 AE 0.02 to 7.390 AE 0.04, respectively), and the PCO 2 presented reduction (P < 0.001) in the fatigue and 5 minutes after fatigue (31.74 AE 5.9, and 37.01 AE 5.8), in comparison with basal value (41.4 AE 2.2). The HCO 3 \u00c0 decreased in fatigue and 5 minutes after IET (18.2 AE 2.3 and 19.1 AE 2.5) when compared with basal (21.9 AE 1.1). The values of SID showed decreased in fatigue compared to values before exercise (36,2 AE 1,7 e 36,6 AE 2.1) respectively. Running velocities corresponding to the lactate and glucose threshold showed accordance between them, what has been already shown in horses and humans, besides results showed respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis, which is considered a change due to hyperventilation and strenuous anaerobic activity, decreasing PCO 2 concentrations, which leads to increase pH through the increase of the relation of HCO 3 \u00c0 and PCO 2 . SID showed a metabolic acidosis possibly from lactate values increase. Results of this study suggest that glucose threshold can be used as a marker of aerobics capacity in dogs as it is used in humans and horses, besides, maximum exercises in dogs cause acid basic alterations.",

Dennis Jewell 1 , Jodi Vondran 1 , Melissa Vanchina 1 , Jean Hall 2 . 1 Hill's Pet Nutrition, Inc., Topeka, KS, USA, 2 Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA Dogs and cats have specific taste preferences that are influenced by macronutrient composition and physical characteristics of food, as well as presence or absence of specific taste imparting compounds (palatability enhancers). This study investigated the relationship of food choice on macronutrient composition and that choice on subsequent plasma amino acid concentrations. Experimental foods for dogs and cats were individually prepared to have similar palatability through manipulations of factors independent of macronutrients. Foods with similar palatability preference for their respective populations as a whole were then investigated for intake choice using 20 dogs with varying body fat composition (mean, 3.9 kg; SD, 0.9 kg; range, 2.4-6.2 kg;) and 27 cats (mean body fat composition, 1.4 kg; SD, 0.9 kg; range 0.3-2.2 kg). Subsequent effects of food choice on serum amino acids were also determined. Four completely balanced foods were available to dogs and cats at all times. The four varied in macronutrient content: Food 1: high protein (33% of calories from protein for dogs; 42% for cats); Food 2: high fat (54% of calories from fat for dogs; 44% for cats); Food 3: high carbohydrates (56% of calories from carbohydrate for dogs; 52% for cats); and Food 4: blended macronutrients. Dogs on average chose to consume 23.0% calories from protein (SD, 1.5%; range 20-26%) whereas cats chose 30.3% of calories from protein (SD, 4%; range 24-38%). Body composition influenced their choice of calories from protein. In dogs, there was a positive relationship between body fat and percent calories consumed as protein (r = 0.56; P = 0.02). There was no relationship between lean body mass and percent calories consumed as protein (r = 0.06; P = 0.82). Overall, dogs with high body fat showed the highest preference for dietary calories from protein. In cats, both body fat and lean body mass were negatively associated with calories consumed as protein (P = 0.04; P = 0.02, respectively), with a positive association for the interaction (P = 0.02). Overall, cats with high body fat and high lean body mass showed the highest preference for dietary calories from protein. Dogs had higher circulating amino acid concentrations of threonine, methionine, isoleucine, and valine (P < 0.05) compared with cats, the later which had higher circulating amino acid concentrations of isoleucine, valine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, and histidine (P < 0.05). In both dogs and cats there was no effect of protein intake on circulating essential amino acid concentrations. Increased intake of calories as protein was associated with increasing plasma ornithine (dogs only) and citrulline (dogs and cats) concentrations (P < 0.05). In summary, given the opportunity to choose between foods with similar palatability, cats chose to consume 30.3% and dogs 23.0% of their calories as protein. Although there were species differences between circulating amino acid concentrations indicating metabolic shifts associated with protein intake, there were no changes in circulating essential amino acid concentrations. The purpose of this double masked, controlled multicenter clinical trial was to determine the impact of a food with ingredients designed to have skin and coat health benefits and immune modulating effects on clinical signs of seasonal atopic dermatitis versus a control food. Dogs with a history of seasonal dermatitis, but without current clinical signs consistent with atopy (CADESI and pruritis scores = 0) were recruited in the spring from 11 general practices in the United States. Dogs currently on foods designed for adverse food reactions were excluded. Eligible dogs were randomly assigned to Test or Control groups and evaluated by their veterinarian at 0, 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks. Consistent with accepted standards of care, treatment was not withheld, therefore, prescribed medications and dosing information was collected; only oclacitinib which was not uniformly available to all practices was disallowed. Veterinarians graded skin lesions using a modified CADESI (0:absent -4:severe for erythema, alopecia, excoriations and lichenification for 27 body sites, max score of 432) and a pruritis score (0:absent -4:severe).",

In addition, the interval to medical intervention was likely influenced by the study schedule which promoted frequent evaluations and case management. This data suggests that dogs with seasonal atopy my benefit from frequent evaluations. This data also suggests altered management of dogs fed the Test food as medication use was lower and the interval prior to the onset of systemic antihistamines and/or glucocorticoids was longer.

Consequently, FGF-23 concentrations should be considered as an early indicator of disease progression, RHPT, and potential target for therapeutic intervention. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents are currently recommended for veterinary patients with anemia secondary to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Darbepoetin alfa (darbepoetin) has replaced epoetin due to a three-fold longer half-life allowing for less frequent dosing. Also, darbepoetin is perceived to be less likely to elicit formation of anti-erythropoietin antibodies resulting in pure red cell aplasia (PRCA). A previous study examined the efficacy of darbepoetin in cats with CKD; 14 of 25 cats responded, with adverse events observed in 12 cats, including two with possible PRCA. This retrospective study evaluated response to darbepoetin therapy, protocols for administration, and potential adverse events in dogs with CKD.",

            "text": "Darbepoetin is an effective treatment for anemia secondary to CKD. A dosing interval of >21 days is not effective at maintaining a response to therapy. Further studies are needed to define the most effective dose. PRCA was a possible adverse event in 1/34 dogs (2.9%). Vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP) is the main carrier of vitamin D metabolites into circulation, and it is freely filtrated through glomerulus, and the complex VDBP-25-OH-vitamin D is uptaken by megalin-cubilin receptors in proximal tubules. Once the presence of VDBP in urine, it may indicate proximal tubular dysfunction/injury as well as interstitial tubular fibrosis. Also it still remains to be proven whether loss of VDBP in urine may lead to vitamin D deficiency and its contribution to the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in dogs. The hypothesis and the aim of this study were to investigate whether VDBP could be previously detected in urine of dogs with CKD regardless of urinaryto-protein ratio (UPC) values, and it will be an early and specific marker of proximal tubular injury. Forty dogs according to IRIS staging of CKD (stage 1 n = 10; stage 2 n = 10; stage 3 n = 10; stage 4 n = 10) were enrolled, various breeds and age, and with no proteinuric-associated disease. Nine clinically healthy dogs, different breeds and age, composed the control group. Dogs with CKD were classified according to IRIS guidelines based on UPC as nonproteinuric (UPC<0.2), borderline proteinuric (UPC= 0.2 to 0.5) and proteinuric (UPC>0.5). Western blotting was performed to investigate VDBP in canine urine (Anti-Vitamin D Binding Protein antibody, ab95469, Abcam\u00a9 1:500). No urinary VDBP was detected in control dogs and UPC was 0.14 AE 0.04 (meanAESEM) and min= 0.028 and max= 0.41. In CKD dogs, urinary VDBP was observed since the early stages of CKD, stages 1 and 2, and the UPC was 0.39 AE 0.29; 0.02-3.01 and 0.33 AE 0.12; 0.14-1.14 (mean AESEM; min -max), respectively. In stage 1 CKD dogs, urinary VDBP was detected in 7 out of 10 dogs and in 4 of those 7 dogs, UPC was into the non-proteinuric range, 2 dogs in borderline range and only one was proteinuric. In stage 2 CKD dogs, VDBP in urine was noticed in 9 out of 10 CKD dogs and 5 of them had UPC < 0.2, one dog was in borderline (UPC= 0.42) and 3 dogs were slightly proteinuric (UPC of 0.67, 0.72 and 1.14). In CKD dogs in stage 3, UPC was 1.51 AE 0.54 (0.07-4.57) and VDBP in urine was immunodetected in 8 out of 10 dogs and in 3 of those 8 dogs, UPC was \u2264 0.28 and the left 5 dogs were proteinuric. All CKD dogs in stage 4 were proteinuric (UPC = 4.37 AE 0.47; 1.4-6.94) and showed VDBP in urine. In conclusion, the immunodetection of VDBP in urine noticed in the early stages of CKD in dogs, mainly in stages 1 or 2, associated with UPC into non or borderline proteinuric range, it reinforces that urinary VDBP could be a potential early marker of kidney injury as well as to detect the specific segment (proximal) of the nephron affected. Progressive interstitial nephritis (IN) is the primary cause of feline chronic kidney disease which is considered to be the leading cause of death in adult cats. The Crandell Rees feline kidney (CRFK) cell line is commonly used to grow feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1), calicivirus, and panleukopenia virus used in (FVRCP) vaccine production. Previous studies have shown that cats administered FVRCP vaccines parenterally develop antibodies against CRFK lysates and alpha enolase (glycolytic pathway enzyme in all mammalian cells) and these antibodies can bind to feline renal cell lysates. In addition, three of six cats that were hyperinoculated (11 injections) with CRFK lysates over two years had IN on renal biopsy collected two weeks after the last booster. The primary objective of this study was to determine whether IN could be induced over 16 weeks by repeatedly administering a market leading parenteral FVRCP vaccine to potentially use as a short term model to study biomarkers associated with IN in cats.",

The aim of this study was to report combined experience of two institutions placing subcutaneous ureteral bypass systems (SUBs). We compared our data to historical data from cats with ureteral stents for ureteral obstruction. Hypotheses included 1) Patients with SUBs would have the same or better 7-14 day and 3-4 month post-operative creatinine as historic ureteral stent patients, 2) SUB patients would experience the same or improved peri-operative, post-operative and recurrent urinary tract infection rates as ureteral stent cats, 3) clinical signs related to implants would be similar or better with the SUB system versus ureteral stenting.",

Dogs with IRIS stage 1 CKD (n = 36) were transitioned over 1 week from various grocery brand foods to a modified protein, low phosphorus, antioxidant enriched test food (Prescription Diet\u00d2 k/d\u00d2, Hill's Pet Nutrition, Inc.). At months 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 owners completed a questionnaire to assess their pet's acceptance of the test food and their dog's quality of life. Renal biomarkers, including serum creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA), and urinalysis parameters, including urine specific gravity (USG) and urine protein:creatinine ratio (UPC), were measured. Of the 36 dogs initially enrolled, 35 (97%) transitioned to the test food. Pets moderately or extremely liked the test food 88% of the time, ate most or all of the food 84% of the time, and were moderately or extremely enthusiastic while eating 76% of the time. Dogs consuming test food showed a decrease in serum Cr and BUN concentrations across time (both P = 0.01) and a decrease in serum SDMA concentration and USG across time (both P = 0.09). All serum renal biomarkers (Cr, BUN, SDMA) were decreased (P \u2264 0.05) from baseline at 3 months, and remained decreased from baseline at 12 months in dogs completing the study (n = 20). This study shows that dogs with IRIS stage 1 CKD readily transition to a commercial renal food, and decreasing serum biomarker concentrations suggest improvement in kidney function. In addition, owners reported improvement in a consortium of overall health and quality of life attributes (P < 0.01) and hair and coat quality attributes (P < 0.01). Decreased glomerular filtration rate in chronic kidney disease (CKD) reduces renal phosphorus excretion, leading to increased total body phosphorus retention and eventually hyperphosphatemia. In addition of promoting parathyroid hormone synthesis, hyperphosphatemia stimulates the synthesis of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), a phosphaturic/hypophosphatemic hormone. There are no reports on serum FGF-23 in healthy dogs or in dogs with CKD. The goal of this study was to measure serum FGF-23 concentrations in healthy dogs and in dogs with CKD, and to determine its association with serum phosphorus concentrations and severity of renal disease based on IRIS staging of CKD. We hypothesized that serum FGF-23 will be increased in dogs with CKD, that its concentrations will be proportional to CKD severity, and that it will be an early marker of altered phosphorus metabolism.",

More marked elevated serum levels of FGF-23 were found in advanced renal disease -IRIS stage 3. It is likely that increased concentrations of FGF-23 contribute to disturbed calcium and phosphorus homeostasis and altered vitamin D metabolism and parathyroid gland function. Further studies at targeted control of serum phosphorous and FGF23 concentrations in dogs with CKD are warranted. Idiopathic cystitis (IC) is a common lower urinary tract disorder in cats that resembles painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis in humans. In both disorders, the etiology is unknown and specific therapy is not available. Diagnosis is based on clinical signs and exclusion of other disorders due to lack of characteristic pathologic findings, well-defined phenotypes, or objective biomarkers. Cytokines can serve as noninvasive biomarkers to define the presence, severity, and progression of disease, and response to treatment. The objective of this pilot study was to determine concentrations of selected cytokines in serum from healthy cats and cats with IC. Thirteen serum samples from healthy cats and 13 from cats with IC were evaluated. Multiplex analysis of 19 cytokines (sFas, TNF-a, SDF-1, SCF, RANTES, PDGF-BB, MCP-1, KC, IL-18, IL-13, IL-12 (p40), IL-8, IL-6, IL-4, IL-2, IL-1b, IFN-c, GM-CSF, Flt-3L) was performed with a multiple antigen Luminex bead-based assay according to manufacturer recommendations. Results were then analyzed for normality of data with D'Agostino-Pearson test and groups were compared using Mann-Whitney test.",

The purpose of this crossover design study was to determine if 3 different resuscitative fluid therapy protocols would increase N-terminal proBNP (NT proBNP) levels in healthy dogs. The protocols included a balanced isotonic replacement crystalloid solution (Normosol R) administered at 90 mL/kg/h over one hour, a 7.2% hypertonic saline bolus administered at 5 mL/kg over 15 minutes, and a 6% hydroxyethyl starch fluid bolus (Voluven \u00d2) administered at 20 mL/kg over 30 minutes. Serum NT-proBNP concentrations were measured in 6 healthy purpose bred dogs prior to fluid administration and then 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48 hours after receiving one of the three fluid therapy protocols. Each dog was randomly assigned to receive a different fluid protocol each week for 3 weeks, allowing a 5-day washout period between treatment protocols. Serum NT-proBNP concentration was significantly more elevated from baseline in dogs receiving 90 mL/kg/hr of crystalloid solution compared to dogs receiving hypertonic saline or hydroxyethyl starch boluses. None of the fluid therapy protocols caused elevations of serum NT-proBNP above the previously reported cut-off concentration used to discriminate between dogs with congestive heart failure and dogs with primary respiratory disease.",

This study aims to determine the effects of sedation and anesthesia on complete blood count (CBC) and serum chemistry results in dogs undergoing routine health and wellness care. Ten healthy adult dogs were selected based on physical exams and the need to undergo anesthesia for routine dental prophylaxis. Blood was collected by venipuncture at a series of timepoints: a) before receiving a premedication, b) prior to induction of anesthesia, c) 5 minutes after induction of anesthesia, d) 15 minutes after induction of anesthesia, and e) 45 minutes after induction of anesthesia. Premedication was a combination of acepromazine (0.025 mg/kg) and butorphanol (0.2 mg/kg) given as a single subcutaneous injection 20 minutes prior to induction with propofol. Propofol was calculated at 4 mg/kg and administered intravenously to effect. Anesthesia was maintained with inhalation of isoflurane gas via endotracheal intubation. Generalized linear mixed models were conducted to compare parameters between various time points to account for the correlated data (the same dog participated in multiple time points). P-values less than 0.05 are considered as statistically significant. When compared to blood results prior to premedication, statistically significant changes were observed in average hematocrit, hemoglobin, mean cell volume, red blood cell, albumin, cholesterol, and protein values after premedication alone. After induction with propofol, variation was additionally observed with white blood cell count, alkaline phosphatase, calcium, globulin, potassium, triglycerides, and whole blood DNA concentration. After 15 minutes of maintenance on isoflurane gas, mean cell hemoglobin concentration, monocytes, phosphorus, and bilirubin values were additionally affected. This study highlights the significant effect that sedation and anesthesia have on blood analyses and subsequent interpretation and clinical relevance.

Nutramax Laboratories Veterinary Sciences, Inc., Lancaster, SC, USA S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) is used to support liver function both in companion animals and humans, and is also used in humans for mental and joint health. Previous studies have shown that when SAMe is administered with food there is a substantial decrease in SAMe bioavability (Table 1 ). In a blinded crossover study a new Denamarin \u00d2 (Nutramax Laboratories Veterinary Sciences, Inc.) chewable tablet containing a novel formulation of SAMe salt (NMXSS75ATM) was administered to beagle dogs to assess its bioavailability relative to administration with food. Six beagles were dosed after an overnight fast with 225 mg SAMe ion (mean 21.7 mg/kg) in one formulation of the supplement, followed by the other formulation 7 days later administered with food. Plasma values for SAMe before dosing and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours were determined using an HPLC-ESI-MS/MS assay. With both supplements SAMe plasma levels increased substantially above baseline values (21-38 ng/mL) and returned to baseline after 24 hours. Mean values for C max ,T max , AUC 0-24 and t 1/2 were comparable for both formulations with no statistically significant differences ( Table 2 ). The data indicate that this novel SAMe salt may be used in dogs with equivalent bioavailability when administered with food which may increase owner compliance.

Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is the active moiety of the prodrug mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). It is a selective non-competitive inhibitor of inosine-5\u02b9-monophosphate dehydrogenase. MPA is an attractive immunosuppressant option in veterinary medicine due to its rapid onset and commercial availability in multiple formulations. Although MPA is used routinely in humans and canines, there is a paucity of literature supporting MPA's use in feline patients, likely from cats' limited ability to glucuronidate certain medications. Our goal for this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of MPA in 9 healthy cats. The pharmacokinetics of MPA was evaluated following an intravenous infusion of 5 mg/kg (n = 2) and 10 mg/kg (n = 1) of MMF (CellCept\u00d2 intravenous, Roche Lab Inc.) Surprisingly, the plasma concentration of MPA in cats at these doses were remarkably low compared with the plasma levels consistent with immunosuppressive levels in humans. Therefore, we evaluated the PK of MPA using 20 mg/kg of MMF administered twice 12 hs apart (n = 6). Following the infusion, all cats metabolized MMF into MPA. The maximum observed MPA plasma concentration ranged between 3.4 and 22 \u00b5g/mL after the first dose and between 6.7 and 20 \u00b5g/ mL, following the second dose. The evaluation of the concentration time profile of MPA in plasma revealed additional peaks of MPA which could correspond to enterohepatic recycling of MPA.",

Cobalt is a substance of abuse in humans and animals performing in strenuous athletic competitions. When administered at pharmacologic doses, it has been associated with induction of erythropoietin release, increased hematopoiesis, which is thought to confer competitive advantage. Cobalt chloride (CoCl 2 ) is reportedly given to racehorses to enhance performance, and recently, allowable limits for cobalt have been set by several racing jurisdictions for post-race illicit substance testing of blood and urine. While preliminary single-dose pharmacokinetic data have been published for CoCl 2 in horses, information regarding the effects of repeated dosing (which is how the substance is reportedly used illicitly in performance horses) is unavailable. Even fewer data have been published describing the pharmacodynamic effects of CoCl 2 administration in horses, particularly at high doses.

The innate immune response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) mediated by toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) contributes substantially to the morbidity of a number of important equine disease syndromes including gastrointestinal disease and neonatal sepsis, and contributes to other chronic pro-inflammatory states. Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules 17-25 nucleotides in length that function as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. miRNAs have recently been found to have a central role in the modulation of the TLR4 signaling cascade in other species, and altered expression has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. Limited information is available on miRNA expression in horses, and there is no published data on expression in equine inflammatory cells.

It is thus likely to influence the magnitude and nature of the acute inflammatory response to LPS in the horse, and could be a target for immune modulatory interventions. It may also prove a useful marker of TLR activation. Further research will be necessary to validate expression changes in a wider sample set, investigate targets and functions of these miR-NAs in horses, and to establish roles in naturally occurring disease. Airway neutrophilia is a characteristic finding of severe equine asthma (heaves), a common and incurable condition of horses. However, how polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) contribute to the disease remains poorly understood. \"Low-Density Granulocytes\" (LDGs), a subpopulation of PMNs, have been suggested to have strong pro-inflammatory properties, which can promote the recruitment of PMNs in an autocrine manner and thus amplifying the inflammatory response.

Horses with cardiac arrhythmias observed during multiple training sessions and with more significant abnormalities may be less likely to continue training and to reach their first trials. ECG is an invaluable diagnostic tool in human cardiology where conditions such as left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and bundle branch block can be diagnosed based on the 12-lead ECG. Guidelines for 12-lead ECG in horses exist. These guidelines have imitated the human electrode placement with the limb leads recorded from the extremities and the precordial leads on the thorax.

Specifically, horses with high glucose levels were seen to have almost four times the odds (3.5X) of HI compared to those with normal glucose levels. Therefore, when evaluating horses with suspected endocrine disease, at a minimum, ACTH, insulin and glucose should be evaluated. Long term studies need to be conducted in large populations of horses to further evaluate endocrinopathies in horses. Pituitary Pars Intermedia Dysfunction (PPID) has previously been diagnosed and managed as an older horse disease with advanced clinical signs. However, in early PPID, the clinical signs are typically more subtle. Clinical signs of early PPID include: decreased athletic performance, change in attitude/lethargy, delayed hair coat shedding (subtle), regional hypertrichosis, loss of epaxial muscle mass (topline), regional adiposity, and laminitis. One of the major limitations of diagnostic testing for PPID is the sensitivity of available diagnostic assays. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation test has been shown to have an increased sensitivity of detecting horses with early PPID compared to resting ACTH. Few studies exist concerning endocrinologic testing and follow-up monitoring the clinical progression and diagnostic assay results following treatment in horses with early PPID. The purpose of this study was to identify cases of early PPID based on clinical signs and laboratory testing then determine improvements in ACTH levels using resting ACTH, TRH stimulation test, and clinical signs over time.",

Hyperprogesteronemia was associated with NMS, sepsis, and poor prognosis for survival in hospitalized foals. Equine metabolic syndrome (EMS), a clustering of clinical signs including insulin resistance and dyslipidemia, is the most common cause of laminitis, a painful and life-threatening disease of the horse's hoof. In a large across-breeds study of metabolic variation in horses, our lab demonstrated that EMS phenotypic variability in metabolic traits is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Further, we demonstrated that certain features of the EMS phenotype are different between breeds. The objective of this project was to identify genomic regions contributing to EMS by performing a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a cohort of 232 Welsh ponies phenotyped for 11 metabolic traits. Individuals were genotyped on one of two SNP arrays (670,000 to 1,800,000 SNPs); the software program Beagle was used to generate a uniform set of makers across both platforms (~1.8 million SNPs). GWAS was performed using a mixed linear regression model that included a random polygenic term determined from a genomic relationship matrix calculated from select trait associated SNPs, random herd effect, and fixed covariates sex and age. Significant loci were identified for several EMS traits. Specific examples include loci on ECA1 (P = 5.04e-08) and ECA15 (P = 5.43e-12) for fasting adiponectin and triglyceride levels, respectively. For fasting insulin levels, significant loci were identified on ECA18 (P = 4.77e-10) and ECA6 (P = 4.33e-09). Candidate genes in these regions include a gene associated with obesity in humans on ECA18, and a gene associated with height and insulin resistance on ECA6. Future directions include haplotype analysis and interrogation of these regions through whole genome sequencing. Hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, increased parathyroid hormone (PTH), and reduced vitamin D metabolite concentrations were recently documented in critically ill foals by our group. However, information on fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) and klotho, two factors that regulate vitamin D activation and PTH secretion, and their association with calcium, phosphorus, PTH, and vitamin D concentrations in healthy and hospitalized foals is lacking. FGF-23 is released by osteocytes in response to increased 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 , PTH, and phosphorus concentrations. FGF-23 suppresses renal 1a-hydroxylase activity and PTH synthesis. Klotho is secreted by the kidneys and acts as a co-receptor for FGF-23. The goal of this study was to determine the relevance of FGF-23 and klotho in calcium, phosphorus, PTH, and vitamin D regulation, including their association with clinical and laboratorial findings, disease severity and outcome in hospitalized foals. We hypothesized that elevated FGF-23 and reduced klotho concentrations will be frequent, associated with calcium and phosphorus dysregulation, PTH and vitamin D metabolite (25(OH)D 3 , 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 ) concentrations, severity of illness, and mortality in critically ill foals.",

Equine metabolic syndrome is characterized by regional adiposity, insulin resistance, predisposition to laminitis, and activated inflammation. Regional adiposity in horses is characterized by subcutaneous fat deposits at the nuchal ligament, behind the shoulder, and at the tail head, and increased neck circumference is associated with insulin resistance. In humans and mice, visceral fat is associated with insulin resistance and development of diabetes, and is more metabolically active than other fat depots. In contrast, candidate gene expression studies in horses have suggested that nuchal fat may be more metabolically active than visceral fat. We have collected samples from six adipose tissue depots within the horse; nuchal, shoulder, tail head, (subcutaneous, SQ) and visceral, omental, and retroperitoneal (internal) in six horses of varying age, breed, and sex. To quantify the differences in gene expression in the various depots, an average of 19,085,946 paired-end RNA sequencing reads per sample were generated on the Illumina HiSeq platform. Limma-voom and linear modeling identified 4,252 genes that were differentially expressed between SQ and internal adipose tissue depots. Interestingly, several pathways, including PPAR and PTEN, associated with metabolically active beige/brown fat were highly expressed in SQ compared to internal fat depots. Further, SHOX2 (P = 1.54E-10), a marker for beige fat whose subcutaneous expression levels are also positively correlated with central obesity in humans, was overexpressed in SQ. TBX15 (P = 4.72E-8) and ZIC1 (P = 5.03E-5), genes expressed in brown adipose tissue, were also overexpressed in subcutaneous tissue. Several differences in SQ gene expression were driven by differences in the nuchal fat. There are multiple clinical applications for the acidification of equine urine, including prevention of reoccurrence of urolithiasis. This study evaluated the efficacy of a commercial anionic supplement (SoyChlor\u00d2) for urinary acidification without altering systemic pH. Eight horses were administered SoyChlor\u00d2 to achieve a DCAD of 0 mEq/kg or \u00c040 mEq/kg or fed a control diet for 14 days in a randomized crossover trial. Urine and plasma pH, plasma strong ion difference, plasma anion gap and fractional excretion of calcium were measured and compared between treatment groups. Mean urine pH across each collection period was significantly greater in control horses compared to either treatment group but there was no difference between treatment groups. Blood pH and anion gap were not affected by treatment, but blood pH decreased and anion gap increased over time. Mean bicarbonate concentration was lower in the 0 mEq/kg group than the control group, but did not differ between the 0 mEq and \u00c040 mEq/kg treatments. Strong ion difference of the 0 mEq treatment was lower than the control group. The mean fractional excretion of calcium over all time points did not differ between treatment groups but there was an effect of time and treatment. Both treatment groups had increased fractional excretion of calcium relative to the control group at trial day 7 only. This study shows SoyChlor supplementation can decrease equine urinary pH. Systemic pH was not affected but an increase in fractional excretion of calcium did occur. Abrupt changes in diet have been shown to cause gastrointestinal upset in horses. In particular, sudden large increases in concentrate intake can lead to hindgut disruption due to acidosis. Various dietary additives have been studied to determine if this response may be ameliorated or blunted by exerting a prebiotic effect. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that the supplementation of a proprietary yeast fermentation product would ameliorate the disruptive effects of a sudden increase in concentrate intake on the cecum.",

Data were analyzed statistically using an ANOVA for repeated measures and when significant differences were found in the main model, a post-hoc Least Squares Means test was performed to determine significant differences at P < 0.05. Alfa-Lox Forage \u00d2 top-dressed on grain was readily eaten by all horses, and did not result in any adverse effects. When period data were pooled, Alfa-Lox Forage \u00d2 did not have a treatment by day effect on gastric ulcer scores or gastric juice pH during the study period. However, there was an overall period effect on treatment, in that BCS was higher and gastric ulcer scores were lower in the AFLtreated horses during the first period of the study, but no treatment by day effect was seen. Forage analysis showed lower digestible energy in the first period of the study. Other significant effects seen during the study included OME-treatment significantly decreased gastric ulcer scores and increased gastric juice pH in both ALFtreated and control horses and gastric ulcers healed in 6/8 (75%) horses after 14 days of treatment. In addition, gastric ulcer scores significantly increased 2 weeks after OME treatment and after feed-deprivation regardless of treatment. Alfa-Lox Forage \u00d2 had no effect on gastric ulcers scores after OME treatment or during feeddeprivation when compared to untreated controls. However, when forage had lower digestible energy and higher fiber content, Alfa-Lox\u00d2 Forage-fed horses had better BCS and fewer ulcers. Thus, Alfa-Lox Forage \u00d2 might provide gastric support when forage has marginal nutritional value. It should be pointed out that the quantity of Alfa-Lox Forage \u00d2 fed may not have been adequate to affect gastric ulcer scores or gastric juice pH in horses in this study, but other nutritional benefits might result.

WNV infection can cause severe acute illness, with devastating clinical signs of illness affecting gait and behavioural abnormalities often times resulting in a high case fatality rate. Thus, WNV vaccination is a recommended core vaccine and is an essential standard of care for all horses in North America as recommended by the AAEP. Many commercially available vaccines are sold as single pathogen vaccines, however nowadays several are available as multi-pathogen or combination vaccines. Little data exists to characterize the immune response to the WNV antigen following a combination vaccination. We hypothesize that a multipathogen \"combination\" vaccine will elicit significant cell-mediated and humoral immune responses in na\u20ac \u0131ve ponies. A total of 16 influenza na\u20ac \u0131ve yearling ponies were randomly assigned to receive one of two treatment groups: (Group 1) (n = 8) Vetera \u00d2 EWT + EIV + WNV (BIVI) vaccination and (Group 2) (n = 8) controls to receive a saline vaccination. All vaccinate ponies received a primary vaccination on day 0, followed by a booster vaccination on day 28. Peripheral blood was collected from all ponies prior to vaccination on day 0 and every 2 weeks following for an 8 week period. Serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated to measure WNV-specific antibody and cell-mediated immune responses by the following assays: ELISA, interferongamma intracellular staining by flow cytometry, and Real-Time PCR. Statistical analysis was performed using SIGMA Plotv12.0TM (Systat Inc., Richmond, CA) with significance determined at the level of (P \u2264 0.05). Non-normally distributed data were log transformed prior to statistical analysis. For each variable measured (cell-mediated immunity, etc.), a mixed model two way ANOVA with repeated measures was used. In measuring the humoral immune response to the WNV component of the vaccine, results showed a significant (P < 0.05) increase in WNV IgG titers in vaccinated ponies compared to non-vaccinated saline controls. Measurement of CMI responses by flow cytometry showed a significant (P < 0.05) increase in the percentage of WNV-specific interferon-gamma producing cells from the vaccinated ponies compared to the saline controls. Measurement of WNV-specific CMI responses by RT-PCR showed a significant (P < 0.05) increase in WNV-specific interferon gamma and IL-2 gene expression in the vaccinated ponies compared to controls.

Infection control is crucial in the operation of all veterinary hospitals to not only protect the patients and hospital, but to protect personnel as those in the veterinary field have an increased risk of occupational exposure to zoonotic diseases. In a 2008 study, 50% of Veterinary Teaching Hospitals (VTHs) surveyed reported significant health problems due to zoonotic infections among hospital personnel. Cryptosporidium parvum infections accounted for 68% of these infections. The objective of this study was to characterize current infection control practices in place for the prevention of zoonotic disease infection, specifically infection of C. parvum, in VTHs.",

Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) play an integral role in equine medicine due to their combined analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. Despite their widespread use, there are limited NSAIDs available that demonstrate variable adverse effects and safety. While several NSAIDs have been proven to be adequate analgesics, few have undergone rigorous evaluation for anti-inflammatory efficacy. Ketorolac tromethamine (KT) is a nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitor that has been used in human patients since 1989. The pharmacokinetic properties of KT have recently been determined in the horse, and have been previously determined in several other species. However, there have been only two previous studies examining KT's anti-inflammatory properties in animals, both of which were in vivo. There have been no published studies evaluating the in vitro anti-inflammatory effects of KT in any veterinary species. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of KT compared to flunixin meglumine using an in vitro model of LPS-stimulated equine monocytes.",

Further research is needed to correlate in vitro results with in vivo efficacy. Hyperthermia in foals treated with erythromycin (ERY), clarithromycin, or azithromycin is associated with reduction of sweating by an unknown mechanism. The aims of this study were to evaluate effects on sweating of (1) chloramphenicol (CHL) which, like macrolides, binds to the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome and (2) gamithromycin (GAM), a macrolide sub-class 7a azalide which is not yet licensed for treatment of foals. Over 3 experimental periods, 12 foals (1 to 3 months old) were treated with ERY (25 mg/kg PO, 3 times daily for 5 days), GAM (8 mg/kg IM once) and CHL (50 mg/kg PO, 3 times daily for 5 days) according to a masked, duplicated, fully counterbalanced design. Quantitative intradermal terbutaline sweat tests were performed on 3 successive days before treatment (baseline) and on days 1, 2, 5, 9, 24, and 39 after treatment began. Data were analyzed by 1-, 2-, and 3-factor repeated measures ANOVA with post hoc pairwise analyses of significant tests. There was significant (P < 0. 05) suppression of sweating by ERY but not CHL or GAM. Compared with sweating at baseline, values when foals were given ERY were significantly lower on all test days except day 39. Sweating responses in foals given ERY were significantly lower than when given GAM or CHL on days 2, 5 and 9 at every terbutaline concentration except 100 lg/mL. In contrast, there was no difference between CHL and GAM. Results show that (1) ability to bind the bacterial 50S ribosome does not by itself confer potential to induce anhidrosis and (2) unlike the macrolides ERY and clarithromycin and the 9a-azalide azithromycin, the 7a-azalide GAM did not suppress sweating responses. have led to an increased awareness of this pathogen as a cause of colitis in adult horses.

Eleven normal control horses were used and sections were location matched to lesion sections. All sections were compared for significant differences by ANOVA (P < 0.05). The number of CD3 + T cells and microglia/macrophage cells of SN+ tissues were significantly increased compared with its adjacent section and the sections from the normal horses. Although present in extremely limited numbers (< 10 cells per site), macrophage only staining cells had statistically higher cell counts in affected horses compared to normal horses. Because CD3 + cells were the most numerous, differentiation of CD4 + and CD8 + cells was attempted using IHC by several markers, none of which worked on FFPE sections. CD4 + and CD8 + relative expression was investigated by quantitative PCR and the most significant change was that of CD4 + cell marker expression at 144.6 fold (log 2 ) over controls. The fold change of CD8 + between the lesion group and the normal group was 10.8. In conclusion, the presence of SN was only present within inflammatory nodules and the presence of parasite burden was associated with the presence of CD3 + CD4 + T cell markers compared to that of CD8 + T cells.

In the current study, mycology culture seems to lack sensitivity in the detection of fungi in respiratory samples. Horses with RAO exhibit exacerbations of acute airway obstruction that cause respiratory distress resulting from bronchospasm, mucus accumulation, and airway inflammation. Emergency therapeutic options for control and reversal of airway bronchoconstriction in equine airways include parasympatholytic agents which inhibit gastrointestinal motility, b2-adrenergic agonists, as well as systemic corticosteroids, which require 4-6 hours for full effect. Meta-analysis of emergency intervention for asthmatic adults found that adjunctive infusion of magnesium sulfate (MgSO 4 ) improves lung function and reduces hospital admissions.

We conclude that intravenous infusion of MgSO 4 has immediate bronchodilatory effects in horses making this therapy a valuable adjunct in horses with signs of respiratory distress referable to bronchoconstriction. E-type prostaglandins (PGEs) play diverse roles throughout the body, including regulation of gastrointestinal (GI) homeostasis and modulation of inflammation. To treat inflammation, anti-inflammatory medications including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are designed to inhibit prostaglandin production. Unfortunately, potential adverse effects of NSAID use in horses include gastric ulceration and right dorsal colitis. To prevent and treat NSAID-associated GI injury, equine practitioners commonly administer the PGE 1 analog, misoprostol. In addition to serving as a gastroprotectant, misoprostol has been shown to have antiinflammatory effects in cell models, potentially by increasing intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP). Elevated cAMP is known to dampen leukocyte effector functions that can damage host tissues, including cellular adhesion, tissue infiltration, and cytokine and superoxide production. The effects of misoprostol on equine leukocyte effector functions are undetermined. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of misoprostol on equine leukocyte proinflammatory cytokine and superoxide production in vitro. Equine leukocytes were isolated from whole blood and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the presence or absence of misoprostol. Misoprostol at concentrations of 1-10 lM significantly inhibited tumor necrosis factor-a, interleukin-1b, and interleukin-6 mRNA production, as measured by qPCR. Misoprostol also elicited concentration-dependent decreases in neutrophil superoxide production in response to granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor priming and LPS stimulation, as measured by luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence. From this data we conclude that misoprostol produces anti-inflammatory effects in equine leukocytes in vitro, paving the way for in vivo studies investigating misoprostol as an anti-inflammatory treatment in horses.",

In a large across-breed study (610 individuals) of 11 morphometric and biochemical metabolic traits, our lab has demonstrated that 51-77% of the phenotypic variability is due to individual factors including age, breed, sex and genetics and 23-49% of the phenotypic variability is the result of shared environment. Despite up to 49% of the variability in EMS phenotype being related to shared environment; only 4-18% of this variability is explained by diet, amount and intensity of exercise and season, suggesting that other environmental factors play a role in EMS development. Recent work has identified associations between Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) and human metabolic syndrome and other endocrine abnormalities. Our preliminary data demonstrated that horses from farms within 30 miles of EDC disposal sites (EPA \"Superfund sites\") were more likely to have had laminitis (P = 0.002) and had higher post oral sugar challenge insulin concentrations (OST INS) (P = 0.00005), suggesting EDC exposure is an EMS risk factor. The objective of this study was to determine if plasma EDC concentration is correlated to metabolic measurements. Plasma EDC concentrations were measured using the CALUX-DR bioassay in 158 Morgans and 137 Welsh Ponies from 32 farms. Grams fat extracted from plasma and sex (female) were negatively correlated with EDC concentration. EDC concentration was positively associated with OST INS (P = 0.03). The results suggest that some of the unexplained environmental variance identified in individuals with EMS is due to exposure to EDCs. Veterinarians have identified equine metabolic syndrome (EMS) as the most common cause of laminitis within equine practice. An oral sugar test (OST) has been used clinically to identify \"at risk\" horses although it has not been rigorously compared to a \"gold standard\" frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGTT) in a large number of horses or across different breeds.",

However, little data exists for draft breeds. Consequently, we tested the hypothesis that INS differs in various breeds of draft horses, independent of age and body condition. Age was obtained from owners/trainers and body condition score (BCS) was assessed and basal (resting but not fasting) INS was measured in 164 draft horses participating in an international competition, including 48 Belgians, 52 Clydesdales, and 64 Percherons.

However, of greatest interest, one-third to nearly half (varying with breed) of all horses tested had an elevated INS, supportive of insulin dysregulation despite horses being trained for competition and without evidence of laminitis. In conclusion, this convenience sampling study of draft horses provides support that INS may vary between light breeds and draft breeds and that breed needs to be considered when interpreting INS results. Among different causes of colic, intestinal obstruction has been identified as the major cause of hospitalization and death in horses around the world. In small colon occurs mainly due to fecalomas or enteroliths. During ischemic process, decreases in oxygen tension inside the cell occur, reducing the generation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and resulting in cellular homeostasis disorders. Calcium accumulation inside the cell produces significant increase in the phospholipase A 2 activity, which directly damage cell membrane through increased production of arachidonic acid, lysophosphatidylcholine and platelet aggregating factor. The platelet aggregation factor is a potent inflammatory mediator, which has an important effect on vascular permeability and on neutrophil activity. Neutrophils adhesion to endothelium may also cause damage to endothelial cells, thus amplifying the reaction. This occurs due to release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), proteoglycans enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and elastase from lysosomes during cell degeneration. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate neutrophil migration and matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 activity in horses with experimental intraluminal obstruction.",

From days 14 to 28, both treatment groups were administered omeprazole (OME; 4.0 mg/kg, P.O., Q.D.; Gastrogard \u00d2 , Merial Limited, Duluth, GA) and from days 42 to 49, horses underwent an alternating feed-deprivation period, to induce or worsen ulcers. 1 Gastroscopies were performed on all horses on days \u00c01 (before treatment) and days14, 28, 42, 49 and 56. Gastric juice was aspirated pH measured at each scoping. Nonglandular gastric ulcer number (NGN) and severity (NGS) scores were assigned at each examination by the PI (FMA), who was masked to treatment. Data were analyzed using an ANOVA for repeated measures and when significant differences were found in the main model, a post-hoc Tukey's test was used to determine significant differences of P < 0.05. The CHL-supplement in powder form, mixed with the grain, was readily consumed by all horses and no adverse effects were seen. Mean NGN and NGS gastric ulcer scores were lower at each gastroscopy examination and a significant treatment effect was seen on day 56 of the study. In addition, gastric ulcer scores were significantly lower in both groups on day 28, compared to the other days, due to omeprazole treatment. By day 42, two weeks after omeprazole was discontinued, ulcers reoccurred in both groups of horses. On day 49, gastric ulcer scores were significantly increased due to intermittent feeding, but no treatment effect was observed.

Significant increases (P < 0.001) in IgGa and IgGb, but not IgGt EIV specific antibody responses to vaccination were also observed. EMS did not significantly affect (P > 0.05) humoral immune responses as measured by HI titers or IgG isotypes to influenza vaccination, however more work is needed to explore possible differences in CMI responses. It is possible that obesity as compared to insulin resistance plays a larger role in modulating the immune process considering that while EMS horses were insulin resistant and had significantly greater regional obesity (cresty neck score) compared to non-EMS controls, they had moderate general obesity (body condition score), which may have not been sufficient to impact immune response to vaccination. Pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID) is an endocrinopathy affecting 15-30% of the aged equid population. PPID is characterized by various clinical manifestations, the hallmark of which is hypertrichosis. Additionally, PPID horses exhibit immunosuppression, making them more susceptible to opportunistic infections. Our lab has established that aged horses exhibit both immunosenescence and inflamm-aging, the low-grade chronic inflammation occurring systemically with aging. To determine whether these age-related changes in cell-mediated immune responses may be affected by the presence of PPID, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proliferation and cytokine production were compared in age-matched PPID and non-PPID horses. PPID status was determined using thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation testing.",

Heparinized blood was collected aseptically, and PBMCs were isolated, stimulated with Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and stained intracellularly for pro-inflammatory cytokines interferon-c (IFNc) and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa).

To analyze flow cytometry and RT-PCR data for differences between PPID and non-PPID horses, t-tests were performed. To analyze lymphocyte proliferation data at various concentrations of Con A stimulation, two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures was performed. No significant differences between PPID and non-PPID horses were found for any of the immune measures examined including flow cytometry, RT-PCR, and proliferation data (P > 0.05). These results indicate that the immunosuppression associated with PPID does not appear to be due to differences in PBMC proliferation or cytokine production when comparing aged PPID horses with aged non-PPID horses. Thus, more research is warranted to further understand the immunological mechanisms responsible for immunosuppression and susceptibility to opportunistic infections in the PPID horse. False positive results may occur when testing horses for antibodies against Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis by synergistic hemolysis inhibition (SHI). In small ruminants, ELISA tests based on exotoxin and cell wall antigens have greater accuracy than SHI in diagnosis of caseous lymphadenitis. The purpose of this study was to compare the detection of C. pseudotuberculosis antibodies in equine serum by SHI and a small ruminant ELISA test that uses exotoxin and cell wall antigens. Sera from 7 ponies experimentally infected with C. pseudotuberculosis were analyzed by both tests. Correlation and agreement were calculated by Pearson and Kappa coefficients, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to obtain the optimal cut-off value for the calculated ELISA score (Patient optical density/Negative control optical density x 100). Antigen reactivity to the sera was evaluated by immunoblotting. When SHI titers \u22651:128 were considered a positive result, the optimal ELISA score cut-off to determine positive status was 106%, with 73% sensitivity and 72% specificity with respect to SHI. Correlation between both tests was strong [r = 0.904; (95%CI 0.472-0.986, P = 0.005)]. Agreement in determining positive status was poor (Kappa=0.439; (95%CI 0.226-0.652). Correlation and agreement were strong in 3/7 ponies, but weak in 4/7. Immunoblot showed a band 13.4 times more intense in infected compared to pre-infected sera corresponding with the exotoxin antigen, but only non-specific reactivity with the cell wall antigen. The use of this ELISA test in horses is not recommended. Development of an ELISA test with specific antigens from C. pseudotuberculosis biovar equi is needed. Macrolide-induced anhidrosis is a concern in foals treated for Rhodococcus equi pneumonia. Because sweating in horses is caused by activation of b2-adrenergic receptors on sweat glands, it was of interest to evaluate responses to IV epinephrine in foals given erythromycin. Four pony-cross foals were treated for 3 days prior to epinephrine infusion with either erythromycin (25 mg/kg orally, 3 times daily) or a control preparation according to a 2-period randomized masked design. Epinephrine was given by CRI over 10 minutes at 0.5 lg/kg/minute and the following data were collected before and at intervals for 180 minutes after onset of infusion: sweat (absorbed into absorbent pads), heart and respiratory rates, systemic arterial BP, pupil size, PCV, plasma protein, and blood glucose concentration. Cardiac rhythm was monitored continuously by ECG. Univariate and 2-factor repeated measures ANOVA were used to analyze data. Friedman tests were used for data sets that failed assumptions for ANOVA. Post hoc pairwise analyses were performed after ANOVA indicated significant (P < 0.05) effect. In foals given either treatment, there were significant (P < 0.05) effects of epinephrine on heart rate, pupil size, PCV and blood glucose. Sweating and arterial BP also increased significantly in control-but not erythromycin-treated foals. Significant treatment x time interaction was found only for sweating; pairwise comparisons were significant at every point after time 0. These results suggest that erythromycin does not cause generalized suppression of aand badrenergic responses. Anhidrosis may be a tissue-specific receptor or post-receptor effect of erythromycin and other macrolides. Vector-borne disease impacts the health and welfare of horses, worldwide. Recognized vector-borne diseases among horses include Anaplasmosis (Anaplasma phagocytophilum), Lyme Disease (Borrelia burgdorferi), Potomac Horse Fever (Neorickettsia risticii) and Piroplasmosis (Babesia caballi /Theleria equi). Additionally, Bartonella, Ehrlichia, Rickettsia, and hemotropic Mycoplasma species have been detected in horses with clinical disease spectrums ranging from nonclinical to fatal. The goal of this study is to investigate serological and molecular (PCR) tests that will detect vector-borne disease (VBD) pathogens in horses and apply a broad diagnostic panel to gain a more definitive picture of vectorborne equine pathogens, including novel species and co-infections. Three populations of horses were used to test serological and molecular diagnostic tests. Group I (n = 16): EDTA-whole blood (WB) and serum (S) sets from clinically healthy horses pastured in North Carolina with no clinical suspicion of VBD; Group II (n = 20): WB and S sets from horses submitted for diagnostic testing to the VBDDL, where presumably the clinician suspected vector-borne disease; Group III (n = 15): WB from horses in M erida, Nicaragua with a high degree of tick exposure. Serologic and PCR testing were performed retrospectively. DNA was extracted from WB, and qPCR assays were performed to test samples for infection by bacterial species within the following genera: Anaplasma, Babesia, Bartonella, Ehrlichia, Mycoplasma, Neorickettsia, Rickettsia and Theilera. For samples with positive results, the infectious agent was speciated by species-specific qPCR assay of the sample and/or DNA sequencing of the PCR amplicon. Seroreactivity to Babesia, Bartonella, Neorickettsia and Rickettsia antigens was determined using IFA, and seroreactivity to 3 Ehrlichia species, 2 Anaplasma species and B. burgdorferi antigens was determined using both a commercially available SNAP \u00d2 4DX \u00d2 Plus ELISA and a research-based SNAP \u00d2 MA ELISA. The combined use of serological and molecular assays in this study gave evidence of infection (by PCR) or exposure (by seroreactivity) to Anaplasma, Babesia, Bartonella, Borrelia, Ehrlichia spp., Theileria, and Rickettsia spp. None of the samples contained DNA from Mycoplasma spp. and two samples were positive for infection by Rickettsia felis, constituting the first reported instances of equine infection with R. felis detected by PCR. A novel Equine Ehrlichia species, reported in horses from Nicaragua, was detected in additional Nicaraguan horse samples from this study by both PCR, IFA and ELISA. This study highlights the wide-range of exposure to and infection with vector-borne pathogens in horses.",

            "text": "SELENIUM DEFICIENCY ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEATHS OF FIFTEEN ADULT HORSES. Andrew Allen, Debra Sellon, Fairfield Bain, Danielle Nelson. Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA Nutritional myopathy due to selenium (Se) deficiency typically presents itself in young rapidly growing calves, lambs, kids, and foals. Reports of myodegeneration secondary to selenium deficiency in adult horses are less frequent. We investigated 2 herds with nutritional myopathy with generalized skeletal muscle degeneration and significant death loss in adult horses. In 2014, two American Paint horses from the same farm presented to our diagnostic laboratory for post mortem evaluation. Significant necropsy and histopathology findings included myonecrosis of the cardiac and skeletal muscles, widespread subcutaneous edema, pleural effusion and ulcerative glossitis. An on farm investigation was performed where it was discovered that 13 horses, including the two presented horses, had died on this farm with similar clinical signs over the last year. Complete blood counts and serum chemistry panels were performed on 4 of the 12 remaining horses and physical examinations were performed on the entire herd. All four horses had elevated creatinine kinase activity (CK) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, the herd had an overall low body condition score, 3 horses had elevated heart rates, and one horse had pitting ventral edema. All of the horses had extremely low blood selenium levels, no box elder trees were found on the farm and gastric contents of the dead horses and feed supplements were found to be free of ionophores. An on farm echocardiographic study was performed 6 months post initial investigation on three of the most severely affected horses. All findings appeared within normal limits. In 2015 a second investigation of two dead horses revealed a very similar scenario and herd wide myodegeneration secondary to selenium deficiency. Although unusual, selenium deficiency should be considered a rule out with adult horses showing signs of ventral edema, weakness, and abrupt death. Processed concentrate feeds contain a high concentration of sugars and in some cases non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) exceed 35%. These feeds are commonly fed to stall-confined horses, especially those in competition. Grains, high in NSC, can overwhelm glucose receptors in the proximal small intestine and increase delivery of sugars to the hindgut leading to fermentation and colonic acidosis. Feed supplements, that might enhance glucose absorption in the small intestine, would provide more energy substrate for exercise and decrease delivery of sugars to the hindgut. The purpose of this study was to determine effects of a feed supplement (ALF; Alfa-Lox Forage, Triple Crown Nutrition, Inc., Wayzata, MN), containing chopped alfalfa hay, mannanoligosaccharides, Omega 3 Fatty Acids, and L-Carnitine, top-dressed on grain, on plasma glucose concentration and serum insulin activity in horses before and after grain feeding. Eight healthy Thoroughbreds (7 geldings and 1 mare; ages 2-12 yrs.) were used in a 2-period cross over study, where horses were fed ALF (2.0 lbs. [0.91 Kg], twice daily) top dressed on a sweet feed grain (2.5 Kg; Omelene \u00d2 100, Purina Animal Nutrition, LLC., Grey Summit, MO) or control (grain alone) for 56 days, as part of another study. On Days 41 and 48, after withdrawing feed overnight, blood samples were drawn at 8 am, before the morning grain feeding, with or without ALF, and then again 2 hours after ALF was top-dressed on grain (treated) or grain alone (control) was fed. Plasma and serum were separated within 30 minutes of collection and samples frozen at \u00c070\u00b0C for shipment to the Diagnostic Center for Population Animal Health (DCPAH; Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI). Plasma glucose and serum insulin were analyzed using an automated chemistry analyzer. Data were analyzed statistically using an ANOVA (PROC Mixed; SAS, Cary, NC) for repeated measures and when significant differences (P < 0.05) were found in the main model, post-hoc t-tests were performed to determine significant differences. Alfa-Lox Forage \u00d2 top-dressed on grain was readily eaten by all horses, and did not result in any adverse effects. When period data were pooled, on day 42, fasting mean (SEM) serum insulin activity significantly increased from 65.1 (3.5) pmol/L and 61.9 (5.1) pmol/L in control and ALF-treated horses, respectively, to 126.3 (24.2) pmol/L and 203.1 (30.1) pmol/L, respectively, 2 hours after feeding sweet feed. In addition, on day 48, mean serum insulin activity significantly increased from mean (SEM) serum insulin concentrations of 76.3 (4.3) pmol/L and 69.9 (3.8) pmol/L in control and ALF-treated horses, respectively to 194.6 pmol/L and 290.0 pmol/L, respectively, two hours after feeding sweet feed. Mean serum insulin activity was significantly higher in ALF-treated horses compared to control horses 2 hours after feeding sweet feed. Mean plasma glucose concentrations did not significantly increase 2 hours after feeding. Alfa-Lox\u00d2 Forage top-dressed on grain resulted in higher blood insulin values, but not significantly increased blood glucose concentrations 2 hours after feeding sweet feed. Alfa-Lox Forage \u00d2 resulted in increased absorption of sugars from the small intestine and more efficient utilization for glucose for energy, which likely decreased the amount of sugars delivered to the large colon.",

Unlike cows, the relationship between CNS infection, somatic cell count and milk loss in goats is less clear. The conflicting results between studies on CNS mastitis in goats may be explained by the variation between studies in regard to distribution of CNS species, varying pathogenicity between species, the presence of confounding factors affecting outcome measures, and variation between studies in regard to speciation methods. Phenotypic speciation was used in most studies; however genotyping is considered more reliable than phenotyping for identification of CNS species in goats.

All four calves had a history of decreased appetite and left-sided abdominal distention; two had recently been treated for necrotic laryngitis and one calf was being treated for suspected clostridial abomasitis. A high-pitched ping and splash were ausculted with percussion and succussion of the left abdomen. Ultrasonography confirmed the abomasum to be displaced between the rumen and the left body wall in all four calves.

            "text": "Based on these findings, LDA is likely more common in beef calves than many veterinarians recognize and it should be considered as a differential for calves that present with abdominal distention. Concurrent laryngeal dysfunction has not been previously described in beef calves with LDA and may be a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Ultrasonography is a widely available chute-side diagnostic technique that can rapidly confirm the diagnosis in beef calves. Rolling is a useful adjunctive measure for allowing temporary improvement in cases with severe metabolic alterations, but may be associated with catastrophic intestinal complications in calves as has been reported in adult cows. Therefore, surgical correction is recommended, and right paramedian abomasopexy under sedation and local block is a feasible method of correction of LDA in beef calves. Adequate absorption of bovine colostrum correlates with improved neonatal health. The apparent efficiency of absorption (AEA) of immunoglobulins can be measured using a mathematical equation based on serum and colostral IgG concentration levels, as well as the volume of colostrum being fed and the body weight of the calf. While commonly measured in research projects, little information is available on the normal AEA across a large group of healthy calves on multiple farms. The purpose of this study was to observe how contributing factors (volume of feeding, birthweight and time of feeding) can alter AEA, and to establish a normal range of AEA in healthy calves.",

HCT, O2CT, Cl-, LAC, creatinine and BUN were significantly greater in 12Hr foals. pH, O2SAT, HCO3-, BEecf, K+ and Ca++ were significantly greater in 60Hr foals. Only LAC was different related to sample time, being largest at end infusion. No differences were found for pCO2, pO2, Mg++, glucose, TCO2, Gap, or osmolarity. Infusion of sodium LAC does not importantly impact VBG, electrolyte or metabolite measures in healthy 12Hr and 60Hr foals, with the identified differences primarily due to age.

Current supplementation protocols for cobalamin (cbl) in dogs call for parenteral (PE) supplementation, although no protocol has been validated. In humans, several studies have reported equal efficacy of per oral (PO) and PE administration of cbl. Further, this group has previously reported about successful PO cbl supplementation in dogs with CE and hypocobalaminemia in a retrospective study. Thus, the purpose of this prospective randomized study was to validate the current PE and a new PO cbl supplementation protocol and compare the efficacy of PO versus PE cbl supplementation in dogs with hypocobalaminemia.",

Alfalfa hay feeding has been shown to buffer stomach contents and decrease gastric ulcer scores. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of a supplement (ALF; Alfa-Lox Forage, Triple Crown Nutrition, Inc., Wayzata, MN), containing chopped alfalfa hay, mannanoligosaccharides, Omega 3 Fatty Acids, and L-Carnitine, top-dressed on grain on nonglandular gastric ulcer scores and gastric juice pH in horses after omeprazole treatment and after intermittent feeding. Eight healthy Thoroughbreds (7 geldings and 1 mare; ages 2-12 years.) were used in a 2-period crossover study, where horses were fed ALF (2.0 lbs. [0.91 Kg], twice daily, for 56 days) top dressed on grain (2.5 Kg; Omelene \u00d2 100, Purina Animal Nutrition, LLC., Grey Summit, MO) or control (grain alone). While being treated the horses had their stomach scoped on day 0 (before treatment with ALF or grain only) and the on days 14, 28, 42, 49 and 56. In addition horses were weighed, body condition score (BCS) recorded and gastric juice pH measured. During the 56 day periods, from days 14 to 28 horses were treated with omeprazole paste (OME; 4.0 mg/kg, P.O., Q.D.; GastroGard \u00d2 , Merial Ltd., Duluth, GA) and from days 42 to 49 horses underwent an intermittent feeding model. 1 Stomach nonglandular gastric ulcer number (NGN) and severity (NGS) scores were assigned at each scoping by the PI (FMA), who was masked to treatment.

EIV has resulted in worldwide disease outbreaks. Vaccination is essential to prevent or limit disease spread. Many commercially available vaccines are sold as single pathogen vaccines, however nowadays several are available as multi-pathogen or combination vaccines. A significant amount of equine research has been conducted to measure immune responses to single pathogen vaccines however data is lacking to determine if combination vaccines stimulate the immune system in particular cell-mediated immunity. Thus, the objective of this study was to characterize the cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and humoral immune responses to a combination vaccine in influenza na\u20ac \u0131ve animals. A total of 16 influenza na\u20ac \u0131ve yearling ponies were randomly assigned to receive one of two treatment groups: (Group 1) (n = 8) Vetera \u00d2 EWT + EIV/EHV (BIVI) vaccination and (Group 2) (n = 8) controls to receive a saline vaccination. All vaccinate ponies received a primary vaccination on day 0, followed by a booster vaccination on day 28. Peripheral blood was collected from all ponies prior to vaccination on day 0 and every 2 weeks following for an 8 week period. Serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated to measure influenza specific antibody and cell-mediated immune responses by the following assays: HI, ELISA, interferon-gamma intracellular staining by The primary goal of this research was to contribute new knowledge to the understanding of Sarcocystis neurona (SN) infection in horses. Our goal was to identify SN infected horses and to use different markers to investigate and characterize the infiltration of inflammatory cells and resident cellular changes in EPM-diseased horses by genetic (PCR) and immunohistochemical (IHC) techniques. The hypothesis investigated was that phenotypic characterization the CNS of gravely SN affected horses could define disease pathogenesis. Tissues from 2 groups of humanely euthanized horses with either grave or no neurological symptoms were collected under University of Florida IACUC protocols 3984, 4109, and 4559. Sets of CNS tissues from all levels of brain and spinal cord were fixed for pathology and immunohistochemistry and frozen for nucleic acid extraction. Histopathologically, encephalomyelitis and normal CNS was confirmed in affected and unaffected horses, respectively. SN, Neospora hughesi, EHV-1, WNV, and EEEV virus PCR was performed to confirm neuropathogen status in all horses. For RNA expression analysis, the tissues in which SN was detected, the corresponding section of frozen tissue was cut into 30-50 30 \u00b5g sized cubes. Relative parasite burden was calculated based on the standard curve generated by the use of cultured SN merozoites. 160 samples were tested and the correlation coefficient (R, Psych package) between CD3 + and TNF-a expression was 0.874. The correlation coefficient between CD3 + expression and parasite burden was 0.8304 (186 samples) and the correlation coefficient between TNF-a and parasite burden was 0.7757 (101 samples). Immunohistochemical phenotypic analysis was conducted for T cells, macrophages, B cells, microglia and astrocytes for C3 + T cells, B cells, macrophage",

In contrast, gel column and immunochromatographic strip methods are the preferred techniques for compatibility testing in small animals. The purpose of this study was to determine agreement between novel and standard crossmatch and typing methods. 33 blood typed and alloantibody screened horses were evaluated. TUBE and GEL crossmatches were performed on 144 recipient-donor pairs and compared using non-parametric area under the curve (AUC) receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. With TUBE assigned as the reference variable, TUBE and GEL had excellent agreement for agglutination (AUC ROC = 0.87), but borderline for hemolysis (AUC ROC = 0.64). There was outstanding agreement between TUBE (gross) and TUBE (microscopic) scores for agglutination (AUC ROC = 0.91). The predicted crossmatch compatibility based on blood type and alloantibody assay showed excellent agreement with TUBE and GEL (AUC ROC = 0.84 and 0.89, respectively). However, there were more recipient-donor pairs identified as incompatible by both TUBE and GEL than predicted by blood type and antibody screen, suggesting unidentified alloantibodies. A blood typing STRIP assay was performed on each aliquot and exhibited 100% sensitivity and specificity for 30 Ca+ and 3 Cahorses. These findings show that gel column crossmatch techniques appear to be a practical and accurate equine blood compatibility test method, and that immunochromatographic strips are accurate at identifying the Ca blood type.
