The organic farms had produced 'certified' milk for at least 2 years. On two occasions, with a 1-year interval, 699 serum samples from 624 peri-parturient cows were tested by ELISA for antibodies to BCV and BRSV. Accompanying data relating to the sampled animals were collected in order to identify potential factors associated with increased antibody prevalence. The antibody prevalence was high at both sampling times with approximately 85% and 80% of animals positive for antibodies to BCV and to BRSV, respectively. Conventional herds had a significantly higher mean antibody prevalence to BCV and BRSV than the organically managed herds (P < 0.01). Animal age was significantly associated with increased antibody prevalence (P < 0.001). The findings of this study suggest that organic farm management may be effective in reducing the seroprevalence of these viruses relative to conventional farming methods.",

Bovine coronavirus is an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus classified as an antigenic group II member of the family Coronaviridae (Spaan et al., 1988) and is implicated in both respiratory and enteric disease, including calf diarrhoea, winter dysentery in adult dairy cows, and respiratory infections in cattle of all ages (Alenius et al., 1991; Saif, 2004) . BRSV, like its human counterpart, human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), is an enveloped, negative-stranded RNA virus classified in the Pneumovirus genus of the Paramyxoviridae family (Stott and Taylor, 1985) . Although it is a major cause of respiratory disease in young calves and has a considerable economic impact ( Van der Poel et al., 1994; Valarcher and Taylor, 2007) , cattle of all ages can be infected with BRSV, and severe morbidity and mortality has been described in adult animals (Elvander, 1996) .",

The trading of animals between organic farms is closely regulated so that such premises can only purchase cows from other organic farms and the quarantine of such animals prior to their introduction is also recommended (KRAV, 2007) . Such practices could reduce the risk of direct transmission (Wellemans, 1990; Saif, 2004) .

However, the results of our study did not indicate such a link and, in contrast, herds using AIF had a higher seroprevalence than herds using professional AI technicians. A similar lack of association between seroprevalence and the total number of visitors on-farm was reported by H\u00e4gglund et al. (2006) . It is likely that biosecurity measures undertaken by visiting AI technicians, including disinfection and changes of clothing and footwear between herds, and farmer education on the importance of biosecurity all contributed to the lower seroprevalence. Interestingly, one herd had a high number of visits by members of the public, including groups of school children. This organic herd had a low seroprevalence to BRSV, only one positive 5-year-old cow out of 15 animals sampled, suggesting that contacts unrelated to the cattle industry were not a transmission risk.",

The likelihood of animal seropositivity to both these viruses in either conventional or organic herds gradually increases with age until all cows in the oldest cluster (>7 years old) were seropositive. The finding that mean antibody levels against BCV and BRSV in the oldest cluster were also the highest relative to the other age clusters suggests the oldest cows may have the highest colostral levels of antibodies against BCV and BRSV, increasing the protective value of colostrum from such animals.",

However, a less precise definition of risk factor would reduce the possibility of finding significant associations as such misclassifications are not likely to depend on the type of herd. An alternative approach would be to perform a risk factor analysis based only on data from young cows, where risk factors and seroprevalence are more synchronised. The small sample size, especially of young animals, did not allow for such an approach. However the main conclusion regarding seroprevalence and herd type was supported by the findings in the youngest group of cattle.",

The use of young sentinel animals to determine the serological status of herds to BVDV has been found effective (Houe, 1992) and is used in the Swedish National Control Programme for this virus (Lindberg and Alenius, 1999) . The repeated sampling of as few as three calves per herd has been used to monitor the herd incidence of BCV and BRSV infection (H\u00e4gglund et al., 2006) . Of the cows born on the farms in our study, younger animals were typically seronegative and older animals seropositive, confirming the existence of long-lasting antibody responses to these infections. Thus serological status of the two or three youngest cows corresponded to the herd seroprevalence to these viral infections over the 2-year period preceding the sampling. Such a sampling strategy may form the basis of a rapid, economic, and non-labour intensive method of determining if herds are potentially susceptible to these infections.",
