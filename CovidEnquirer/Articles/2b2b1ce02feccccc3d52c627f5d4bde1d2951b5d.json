Ninety, day-old Holstein bull calves were completely randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups: prophylactic or control. Prophylactic calves had a proprietary blend of prebiotics, probiotics, and hyperimmune egg protein (Calf-Pro Plus and Calf Life, C and E Agri Products, Baldwin, ND) added directly to the milk replacer at each feeding. Control calves were fed the milk replacer only. Treatment did not influence the performance of Holstein calves. Among calves that voluntarily refused milk replacer, prophylactic calves refused less (P = 0.005) than control calves over the first 4 d of life. Prophylactic treatment reduced the incidence of enteric morbidity (25.0 vs. 51.1% for prophylactic and control calves, respectively; P = 0.011). However, treatment did not influence either total peripheral leukocyte or differential counts. Furthermore, hematocrit and plasma concentrations of haptoglobin, cortisol, glucose, and urea nitrogen were not different between treatments. Last, ex vivo innate immune responses evaluated at 21 d of age were not different between treatments. Calves fed the combination of prebiotics, probiotics, and hyperimmune egg protein rejected less milk replacer during the first 4 d of the experiment and had fewer days with enteric morbidity than did the control calves.",

            "text": "The risks of morbidity and mortality among dairy calves due to enteric infections are high. Dairy calf morbidity and mortality were reduced and performance enhanced when the antibiotics oxytetracycline and neo-mycin were included in milk replacer (Quigley et al., 1997) . However, there are concerns that the use of antimicrobials in livestock industries causes an increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria that cause disease in humans. Therefore, alternatives to the use of such metaphalactic antimicrobials are needed. There is interest in the use of prebiotics, probiotics, and dried egg protein from hyperimmunized laying hens to improve enteric health in calves (Abe et al., 1995; Ikemori et al., 1997; Heinrichs et al., 2003) . Probiotics are live, nonpathogenic microorganisms that colonize the gastrointestinal tract, whereas prebiotics are nondigestible dietary components that stimulate microorganism growth in the gastrointestinal tract. Immunizing laying hens against various epitopes on pathogenically relevant microorganisms increases the concentration of IgY-specific antibodies in whole dried egg (Hennig-Pauka et al., 2003) .",

The study was conducted in February 2010. The average low and high temperatures during the study period were \u22121.8 and 9.8\u00b0C, respectively. At enrollment there were no differences in initial BW or total serum protein between treatments (Table 2 ). There were no differences observed in the performance of calves between treatments (Table 2) . Among all calves, there was a negative ADG during the first week, \u22120.261 kg/d, which was then positive from d 7 to 21, 0.426 kg/d. These results are similar to those of Hill et al. (2008) , wherein they observed no difference in ADG from birth through wean-ing when calves were supplemented with either 4 or 8 g/d of a prebiotic fructo-oligosaccharide (Ultra-FOS, Encore Technologies LLC, Minneapolis, MN). In addition, Heinrichs et al. (2003) did not observe any differences in ADG when Holstein calves were supplemented with 4 g/d of a prebiotic (Bio-Mos, Alltech, Nicholasville, KY); however, they did observe a postweaning increase in calf starter intake among calves fed the prebiotics. In contrast to the present data, Abe et al. (1995) observed increases in ADG and efficiency of BW gains when Holstein calves were either administered 3 \u00d7 10 9 cfu/d of the probiotic Bifidobacterium pseudolongum M-602 or L. acidophilus LAC-300 in the milk replacer. In addition, Cruywagen et al. (1996) reported that supplementing milk replacer with 5 \u00d7 10 7 cfu/d of L. acidophilus prevented the loss in BW that is often observed in dairy calves during the first 1 to 2 wk of life. In contrast, Morrill et al. (1995) did not observe any increase in performance when Holstein calves were supplemented with a probiotic (Biomate, Chr. Hansen, Milwaukee, WI); however, they did observe an increase in performance when a portion of the protein in the milk replacer was replaced with spray-dried plasma from either porcine or bovine sources. In contrast, when Quigley et al. (2002) replaced either 16 or 20% of the CP in the milk replacer with spray-dried bovine plasma, they did not see any improvements in ADG from 0 to 28 d of age. The present data, when taken together with past literature, indicate that the influence that prebiotics and probiotics, as well as supplemental proteins, have on the performance of Holstein calves is variable.",

Scours are a nonspecific symptom of enteric disease, and the etiology of spontaneous calf scours is complex and often involves more than one infectious agent, including various bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Because the clinical signs of scours are nonspecific, causative agents are difficult to ascertain without directly examining the fecal microbiota ecology. Age of the calf is usually the best diagnostic indicator, with E. coli being the major pathogen during the first week of life and rotavirus and cryptosporidiosis appearing in the calf etiology during the second and third weeks of life (Blood, 2000) . Future research should determine whether the prophylactic treatment used in the current study has different efficacies on different combinations of pathogens and ages of the calf. Finally, the duration of scours among calves that developed scours was not different between treatments (Table 3) . Control calves that scoured were treated with oral doses of antimicrobials, whereas scouring prophylactic calves were not treated with antimicrobials but were instead administered additional doses of the probiotics. It remains to be determined if the probiotics or additional probiotics during enteric disease improve recovery from the disease and, therefore, could be used as an alternative therapeutic to antimicrobials in the treatment of bacterial scours. In children, a meta-analysis on the influence of Lactobacillus spp. as a therapy in the treatment of acute diarrhea indicated a 0.7-d reduction in diarrhea duration as well as diarrhea frequency (Van Niel et al., 2002) . However, not all probiotics may be equally effective. In children with acute diarrhea, 5 different probiotics were evaluated in addition to oral rehydration therapy, and only one of the probiotics shortened the duration of diarrhea (Canani et al., 2007) . Therefore, the proof of efficacy of each probiotic species or strain needs to be determined through research, and generalizations across strains or species should be limited to the development of hypotheses.",

There were no differences in performance or measures of systemic health due to the prophylactic treatment; however, morbidity and mortality rates were low in the current study, implying good general calf management. Future research should determine the efficacy of the current prophylactic treatment in calves that are at a higher risk of developing severe morbidity and subsequent mortality, such as in calves with unknown colostrum status or shipping-stressed calves.",
