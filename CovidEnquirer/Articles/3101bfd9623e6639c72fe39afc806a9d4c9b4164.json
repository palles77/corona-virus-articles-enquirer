The selection of aerosol delivery system for hospitalized children can have a significant impact on the utilization of healthcare resources. Design and setting: A quality improvement project to evaluate the impact of conversion to MDI-spacer to administer bronchodilators (BDs) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) to hospitalized children on the utilization of hospital resources. The project was conducted in a tertiary pediatric ward from April to May 2013. Materials and methods: The project was conducted over a six-week period. In the first two weeks, data were gathered from all hospitalized children receiving BDs and/or ICSs by nebulizers. This data collection was followed by a two-week washout period during which training of healthcare providers and operational changes were implemented to enhance the conversion to MDI-spacer. In the last two weeks, data were gathered from hospitalized children after conversion to MDI-spacer. The primary outcomes included the mean time (in minutes) of medication preparation and delivery. Secondary outcomes included the following: need for respiratory therapy assistance, estimated cost of treatment sessions, and patient/caregiver satisfaction. Results: Five hundred seventy-five treatment sessions were enrolled (288 on nebulizers, 287 on MDI-spacer). The nebulizer group had more male predominance and were slightly older compared to the MDI-spacer group (male: 59% vs. 53% and mean age: 52 vs. 40 months respectively). The duration of treatment preparation and delivery was significantly lower in the MDI-spacer group (2 min reduction in preparation time and 5 min reduction in delivery time; p < 0.01). Caregivers mastered MDI-spacer use after an average of two observed sessions, eliminating the need for respiratory therapy assistance during the hospital stay. Medication cost analysis showed savings in favor of MDI-spacer (cost reduction per 100 doses: 50% for albuterol, 30% for ipratropium bromide, and 87% for ICSs). The patient satisfaction survey showed \"very good\" to \"excellent\" levels in both groups. Conclusions: Conversion to MDI-spacer for BDs and ICSs administration in hospitalized children improve hospital resource utilization.",

The study results indicate the need for hospital policy modification to enhance conversion to MDI-spacer as the delivery method of choice for BDs and ICSs whenever applicable for hospitalized children. We believe that this will lead to better utilization of hospital resources without negatively affecting the pharmacological effect of medications. In fact, this simple practice change will lead to wiser utilization of respiratory therapists' time and efforts, which can be utilized for other important aspects of patient care. This is of extreme importance, especially with the significant shortage in respiratory therapists across hospitals globally. Cost savings is also expected as a result of the lower cost of medications, elimination of the need for nebulizer machines and disposable nebulizer kits, prevention of unnecessary use of oxygen treatment, and, more importantly, reducing the need for the cost of respiratory therapist overtime shifts. Although these savings are theoretically plausible, there is a lack of solid evidence to confirm those assumptions. We note that conversion to MDIspacer might raise the concern of increasing costs due to spacer expenses, but this might not be a valid concern because these devices can be provided for patients for long-term use.",

This might have significant \"infection control\" impact. However, to our knowledge this has not been investigated in a pediatric population. Studies have shown that in asthmatic children, use of MDI-spacers and nebulizers for bronchodilator administration in the emergency department have resulted in similar clinical responses, with shorter duration of stay, lower incidence of tachycardia, and even lower rate of admissions. In one study, 168 infants (aged 2e24 months) were randomized in a double blind trial comparing MDI-spacer-to nebulizer-administered albuterol for wheezing episodes in the emergency department [11] . Patients in the spacer group had a significantly lower admission rate (5% versus 20% in the nebulizer group), received fewer treatments, had a lower mean increase in heart rate and were less likely to receive steroids. Lower admission rates in the spacer group were found primarily in children with more severe asthma exacerbation [11] . Another randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled trial in an emergency department at a children's hospital included children 1e4 years of age with moderate to severe acute asthma. The spacer was as effective as the nebulizer in terms of clinical score, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation but produced a greater reduction in wheezing (P Z 0.03). Heart rate increased to a greater degree in the nebulizer group (11.0/ min vs. 0.17/min for spacer, p < 0.01). Fewer children in the spacer group required admission (33% vs. 60% in the nebulizer group, P Z 0.04, adjusted for sex). No differences were observed in rates of tremor or hyperactivity [12] . Interestingly, this study showed cost savings in spacer group. Such cost benefits have been reported in studies of American adults, documenting a 30%e50% annual cost savings for asthma therapy with substitution of spacers for nebulizers [13e16] . A meta-analysis and systematic review showed that patients who received beta-agonists by MDIspacer showed a significant decrease in admission rate compared with those by nebulizer (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.24e0.72; P Z 0.002); this decrease was even more significant among children with moderate to severe exacerbations (OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.13e0.54; P Z 0.0003). Additionally, measures of severity (eg, clinical score) significantly improved in the group that received betaagonists by MDI-spacer in comparison to those who received nebulizer treatment (standardized mean difference, \u00c00.44; 95% CI, \u00c00.68 to \u00c00.20; P Z 0.0003) [17] .",

In a Canadian study, a national survey on barriers to MDI-spacer use in pediatric emergency departments revealed that MDI-spacer are infrequently used to treat patients with acute asthma in Canadian pediatric emergency departments despite the fact that most emergency staff believe that they are effective. The largest perceived barriers to MDI-spacer implementation include concerns regarding safety and costs, feasibility of providing and sterilizing spacers, and parental expectations for use of nebulizers. Other barriers included staff beliefs regarding the effectiveness of MDI-spacer, changes in nursing workload, and lack of a physician champion for change [18] . A report on US children's hospital's strategy to implement conversion to MDI-spacer showed increase spacer use from 25% to 77% among all non-intensive-care patients receiving albuterol and from 10% to 79% among patients with asthma (p < 0.001) [19] . The strategy includes the following 4 distinct interventions to plan and implement this conversion program: literature review, product selection, policy and operational changes, and staff training.",

The majority of children (82%) said that they preferred using spacers because it was quicker (29%) or easier to use (53%) [20] . In another study of young patients, 86% of children and 85% of parents preferred the spacer [12] .",

This quality improvement project indicates that the selection of inhalational device can have a major impact on resource utilization in hospitals. Further studies are required to investigate the impact of such strategies on hospital length of stay and in different settings, eg, the emergency department.",
