Hence, the development of efficient drug treatments for the biological effects of SARS is highly needed. We have previously shown that quantum dots (QDs)-conjugated RNA oligonucleotide is sensitive to the specific recognition of the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nucleocapsid (N) protein. In this study, we found that a designed biochip could analyze inhibitors of the SARS-CoV N protein using nanoparticle-based RNA oligonucleotide.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an infectious disease that began in Guandong, China in November 2002. It has caused serious infections in many nations, such as Asia, Europe and Canada. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the mortality of patients afflicted with SARS is 15% on average and 50% or higher in patients aged 65 years and over. 7 SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is an enveloped and positively single-stranded RNA virus with a typical genome size of 29.7 kb. It encodes RNA-directed RNA polymerase and structural proteins, including the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. [8] [9] [10] [11] The N protein is a 422 amino acids alkaline protein with a short lysine-rich region suggested as the nuclear localization signal. It plays an important role in the process of virus particle assembly by enveloping the entire genomic RNA. 12 The SARS-CoV N protein is a major pathological determinant in the host and might cause host cell apoptosis, upregulate the proinflammatory cytokine production, and block innate immune responses. Moreover, the N protein of the SARS-CoV is an important antigen for both the early diagnosis of SARS and the detection of diseases. 13 Since SARS broke out in 2003, researchers have made great efforts to develop fast and accurate analytical methods for its early diagnosis. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] In addition, due to its essential role in SARS replication, the SARS-CoV N protein is mainly regarded as a prime target for anti-SARS therapy. For this reason, the SARS-CoV N protein is an attractive and crucial target for anti-SARS therapeutic drug discovery.",

In general, these polyphenolic compounds are known to have medicinal and chemopreventive activity in human health. [22] [23] [24] [25] In particular, (-)-catechin gallate and (-)-gallocatechin gallate are known as a type of catechin. (-)-Catechin gallate and (-)-gallocatechin gallate are the most abundant catechins, particularly in tea and other plants, and they are a potent antioxidants 26 with possible therapeutic properties for many disorders, including cancer. 27, 28 Researchers reported the benefit of catechin gallate from green tea in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, where (-)-catechin gallate has been shown to reduce plaques related to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related dementia. 29, 30 There have also been reports showing that catechin gallate can be beneficial in treating brain, 31 prostate, 32 and other types of cancers. 33 In this study, we report a novel approach for the inhibitor screening of SARS-CoV N protein using a quantum dots (QDs)-conjugated oligonucleotide system with wide applicability for facile and sensitive imaging analysis on a biochip. We elucidated the inhibitor on SARS-CoV N protein identified through a high-throughput screening strategy using an optical nanoparticle-based RNA oligonucleotide. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the inhibition effects of (-)-catechin gallate and (-)-gallocatechin gallate on SARS-CoV N protein using an optical nanoparticle-based RNA oligonucleotide platform.

At a concentration of 0.05 \u00b5g mL -1 , (-)-catechin gallate and (-)-gallocatechin gallate showed more than 40% inhibition activity on a QDs-RNA oligonucleotide biochip platform. As shown in Figure 4A and B, (-)-catechin gallate and (-)-gallocatechin gallate showed a similar pattern when comparing the concentration-dependent anti-SARS activity. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) values of (-)-catechin gallate and (-)-gallocatechin gallate were found to be approximately 0.05 \u00b5g mL -1 , respectively ( Figure 4A and B). Other polyphenolic compounds to the inhibition of SARS-CoV N protein on the nanoparticle-based RNA oligonucleotide biochip system were detected as nearly similar to the background signal, due to the high affinity with the QDs-conjugated aptamer-SARS-CoV N protein (data not shown). To perform high-throughput screening of the inhibitors, it would be efficient to be able to measure the anti-SARS activity from optical images of a biochip containing multiple reaction compounds. To demonstrate the feasibility of the inhibitor assays, the latter were carried out on a biochip within 60 minutes at 37\u00b0C, and optical images were obtained from the reaction mixtures on a plate using a QDs-based imaging system.

Our main goal in this study is to demonstrate a proof-of-concept that SARS-CoV N protein can be inhibited and detected with remarkable simplicity and speed. Regarding its application, this designed platform for a novel inhibitor assay possesses significant potential as a target screening. In particular, it is a promising method for inhibitor screening because of its high sensitivity, low cost, rapid response, compatibility for miniaturization, and low labor-intensity. In addition, this platform is expected to be applicable to the inhibitor screening of other types of diseases.",
