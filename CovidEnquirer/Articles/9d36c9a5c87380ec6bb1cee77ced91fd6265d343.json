The accumulation of multidisciplinary knowledge and the investment of massive funding have enabled the development of vaccines against many infectious diseases as well as other diseases including malignant tumors. The paradigm of clinical vaccine evaluation and licensure has also been modernized based on scientific improvements and historical experience. However, there remain a number of hurdles to overcome. Continuous efforts are focused on increasing the efficacy and reducing the risks related to vaccine use. Cutting-edge knowledge about immunology and microbiology is being rapidly translated to vaccine development. Thus, physicians and others involved in the clinical development of vaccines should have sufficient understanding of the recent developmental trends in vaccination and the diseases of interest. This review article briefly summarizes the past and present trends in clinical vaccine development. Its aim is to increase understanding about vaccine development by providing upto-date information.",

Powdered scabs or fluid from the pustules of a smallpox patient were inserted into superficial scratches made in the skin of the recipient. Many variations of this technique were used in China, the Middle East, and Africa, and they spread widely throughout Europe in the 17th century. The first scientific in-vestigation of this technique was made by Edward Jenner in 1796 when he used cowpox virus rather than smallpox scabs in a human experiment based on doctrines of the enlightenment. This was the origin of the term 'vaccine' and the beginning of vaccinology [1, 6] .",

Following their seminal investigations, many other studies were performed and led to improved regulations (e.g., The Biologics Control Act of 1902), which resulted in the development of valid live and/or attenuated vaccines. New vaccines against diseases including rabies, typhoid fever, diphtheria, shigellosis, tuberculosis, tetanus, and pertussis were developed by 1930 [1, 7, 8] . However, during this period, vaccine research was limited to the areas of public and/or military need (World War I) because of restricted funding resources.",

This age began with the development of three classical attenuated-virus vaccines against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) in the 1960s [12] followed by the varicella zoster virus vaccine and inactivated Japanese encephalitis virus vaccine in the 1970s. All of these vaccines involved cell culture techniques under controlled conditions for a certain purpose (i.e., attenuation) in their manufacturing processes. Inactivated whole hepatitis A virus and cell culture-derived rabies viruses were also developed as vaccine products using similar methodology.",

A vaccine-specific developmental plan should be clearly established to ensure the efficient and successful development before clinical evaluation. This includes the following contents: 1) identification of the target population (mostly healthy people with particular demographic characteristics) and their sociocultural factors; 2) risk assessment of the target disease and the vaccine itself; 3) understanding of the incidence of the target disease and environmental factors; 4) identification of the dose and route of administration; 5) plans to induce herd immunity; and 6) regulatory strategies.

Determinants of clinically applicable vaccine regimens are also included, such as the dose and number of doses, sequence/interval between doses, and route of administration. Vaccine efficacy may be evaluated using well-defined surrogate parameters. Most of these clinical trials include parallel group comparisons with placebo/active control groups.

This stage is intended to provide a pivotal conclusion needed for marketing approval, and the efficacy and safety of formulation(s) of the immunologically active component(s) must be assessed in the large-scale target population [18, 21] . The clinical outcome is strongly recommended as a parameter for comparing efficacy (e.g., with placebo/active control groups). Therefore, serological data are usually collected from at least a subset of the immunized population at predefined intervals. The designs of Phase II and Phase III clinical trials are similar, but the size of a Phase III trial is much larger. In consideration of the modern vaccination strategy-administration of multiple vaccines at the same time-interaction and/or interference with other vaccines are evaluated routinely. It is sometimes not possible to conduct a confirmatory study to determine the protective efficacy of products containing the same antigens that are already used commonly and/or whose target disease has a very low incidence [21] . The information obtained during the developmental processes mentioned above are summarized and filed for submission to regulatory authorities in support of an application for marketing approval. The WHO and each regulatory authority have their own guidelines to ensure the quality of the information provided [21, 22] . As an example, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) calls the process 'Biologics License Application' (BLA). The multidisciplinary FDA review team reviews the efficacy and safety information needed to make a risk-benefit assessment and is advise by Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC). The appropriateness of label contents and the reliability of the manufacturing process are also reviewed [23] . Even though a vaccine may be licensed, the safety information provided for licensure is regarded as insufficient, because at that point, only a few thousand people have likely been exposed to the vaccine. Thus, many vaccines undergo postlicensure ('Phase IV') studies. In the United States, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) was established to detect possible signals of adverse events associated with vaccines [24] . ",

Ultimately, the goal of modern vaccination may be expressed as to prevent or to cure as many diseases with vaccination as possible. Rappuoli et al. [25] presented this concept in a simple figure (Fig. 3) . Meeting this challenge requires increasing both the number of vaccine clinical trials in nontraditional populations worldwide and the scientific expertise necessary for the successful development of new vaccines [26] . Many initiatives have been launched recently including the Decade of Vaccines, the Millennium Development Goals, and the US Institute of Medicine consensus study Identifying and Prioritizing New Preventive Vaccines for Development.",

The most important keyword from the efficacy viewpoint is 'adjuvant' [25] .

Most of the currently licensed adjuvanted vaccine products target influenza. The emphasis on the importance of adjuvants is gradually increasing with the aging of the population. Because they facilitate the immune response to vaccination in older people, many experts expect that adjuvants will be an essential component for widespread vaccine use in entire populations.",
