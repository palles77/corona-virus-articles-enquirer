Knowing if GM food affects human and animal health before putting it on the market is a question of great importance. However, we are still uncertain whether GM food can exert potential reproductive toxicology on humans or animals [1] . Until now, only a small number of studies have reported the health effects of GM crops on animal reproductive system [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Thus, the current scientific data are considered by many scientists as inadequate to prove whether GM food affects reproductive health; some studies even have reported apparently harmful effects. In the study performed by Vecchio [2] , the authors fed pregnant Swiss mice and male litters on a standard laboratory G chow containing 14% GM soybean. By means of immunoelectron microscopy, they focused their attention on Sertoli cells, spermatogonia, and spermatocytes at 2, 5, or 8 months of age. The results of their study indicated that the immunolabelling for Sm antigen, hnRNPs, SC35, and RNA Polymerase II decreased in 2 and 5 month-old GM-fed mice and was restored to normal at 8 months. Moreover, in GM-fed mice of all considered ages, the number of perichromatin granules was higher and the nuclear pore density was lower. The author further found enlargements in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum of Sertoli cells in GM-fed mice. A three-generation study reported minimal histopathological changes in the liver and kidney of F3 female offspring rats fed on Bt maize diet [6] . The appearance of these apparently harmful effects inevitably aroused suspicion and public anxiety for the safety of GM food and caused extensive debate among scientists.",

The development of pest-resistant GM crops provides to farmers an effective method for the prevention of pest. TT51 was recently created by inserting a synthetic gene CryAb/Ac into parental rice MingHui63. Field tests indicated that TT51 could reduce pesticide application and increase the efficiency of rice production. For its excellent performance, TT51 was granted with the biosafety certificate by China's Ministry of Agriculture in 2009. It means that China is on the threshold of becoming the first country to allow the commercialization of GM rice. However, considering that rice is the most widely consumed staple food, if the product was toxic; the outcome would be quite serious. Therefore, it is not difficult to understand why an acute debate on the safety of this GM rice never stopped since the release of its biosafety certificate in China.",

Considering that rice is a widely consumed staple food and serious debate continues on the safety evaluation of GM crops to protect a large number of people from the risk of potential adverse effects of the GM rice, it would be better to finish the debate by conducting extensive toxicological evaluations. One can consider that if GM food/feed exerts reproductive toxicology on humans or animals after long time-consumption, it is most likely that it would not appear in the parental generation but in the offspring generation. Gene expression index is considered more highly sensitive compared with general toxicological parameters. Until now, the influence of dietary exposure to GM food on the expression levels of male reproductive regulation-related genes has rarely been investigated. Due to this unclear situation, the relative expression levels of reproductive-related genes GnRH-R, FSH-R, LH-R, and AR along the HPT axis of male offspring rats were firstly investigated in this study.",

All animals were provided with unlimited tap water and food.

The animals were fed in a self-feeding manner with diets of control, MingHui63, and TT51. Before mating, all parental rats were treated with corresponding diets for 10 weeks. Next, male rats were housed together with a female rat from the same group for mating. In total, 90 female Wistar rats (30 rats/each group) were mated with 45 male rats (15 rats/each group) overnight for 2 weeks of mating period. After weaning, 8 randomly selected male offspring rats were individually housed and fed with diets correspondent to their parents' for 70 days. During the study, body weight and food intake were weekly measured. At the end of the experiment, the rats were sacrificed under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia (60 mg/kg, i.p.), and their testes, epididymis, and accessory glands (seminal vesicles and prostate) were carefully dissected out and weighed. This study was conducted in accordance with the Guiding Principles for the Use of Animals in Toxicology and approved by the Ethics Committee of National Center for Food Safety Risk Assessment.",

Presently, it is still uncertain whether GM food consumption exerts potential reproductive toxicology on humans or animals [1] . Therefore, many research groups are concerned about whether GM food exerts negative effects on the male reproductive system, trying to ensure the safety of GM food by numerous methods over many species of animals [11] . However, most animal feeding studies are acute and sub-chronic and focused mainly on the following parameters: body weight gain, feed consumption, hematology, serum chemistry, relative organ/body weights and histopathology changes, serum hormones, and sperm parameters. Although there were almost no harmful effects observed in these short-term studies, serious debate still surrounds long-term and multigenerational feeding studies. There has been speculation that GM foods produce unintended outcomes that affect the reproductive function of human beings or animals [12] . However, long-term animal feeding studies with highly sensitive indexes as gene expression level were rarely employed in GM food safety assessment. Therefore, long-term feeding studies with GM rice TT51 on rats and other species, in collaboration with new improving technologies, would be essential to strengthen the safety evaluation process [5] . Therefore, health effects of parental dietary exposure to GM rice TT51 on the male reproductive system of offspring rats were evaluated in this study through the assessment of sperm parameters, testicular function enzyme activities, and serum concentration of reproductive hormone FSH, LH, and testosterone (T) levels, testis histopathological changes, and the relative expression levels of selected genes along the HPT axis.",

Initially, by the secretion of GnRH from the hypothalamus, FSH and LH are released from the pituitary gland. In the testes, under the stimulatory action of LH, the Leydig cells, located in interstitial tissue, produce and secrete testosterone. Simultaneously, FSH supports the function of Sertoli cells, which are mediators for the effects of testosterone and FSH on germ cells for a successful spermatogenesis in the seminiferous tubules [13] . It is well understood that the spermatogenesis and the physiological functions of Sertoli cells in mammals depend largely on T production by the Leydig cells in response to stimulation by FSH and LH [14] [15] .

To evaluate the toxic effects of TT51 on the biochemical metabolism of testes, the levels of ACP, LDH, and SDH in the testes of offspring rats were detected in this study. In testis, the ACP, mainly detected in the cytoplasm of Sertoli cells, is associated with the denaturation of seminiferous epithelium and phagocytosis of Sertoli cells. LDH and SDH, widely distributed in the seminiferous tubules and germ cells, are associated with the maturation of spermatogenic cells and spermatozoa, as well as the energy metabolism of spermatozoa.
