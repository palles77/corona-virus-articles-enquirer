Its scalability allows concurrent testing of up to 96 samples in a single batch. Nucleic acid extracted from 200 \u00b5L of raw specimen using the easyMAG\u00ae extractor is added directly to pre-plated, lyophilized bead reagents (LBRs), where multiplexed RT-PCR and hybridization to MagPlex-TAG\u2122 microspheres occurs within a sealed reaction well using a single cycling program. Data acquisition is done on the MAGPIX\u00ae instrument which reads and sorts the reaction products directly from the sealed well following transfer of the assay plate from the thermal cycler. NxTAG is the newest innovation in bead-based nucleic acid chemistry developed by Luminex. Here we provide the detailed assay protocol and present data which describe the clinical and analytical performance characteristics of NxTAG RPP.",

            "text": "Respiratory tract infection (RTI) involves a wide variety of etiologic agents and presents with overlapping signs and symptoms; therefore, prediction of the causative organism based on clinical findings alone is not reliable [1] . Among the various diagnostic tests available, multiplex nucleic acid amplification assays are capable of detecting and identifying multiple respiratory pathogens and are now commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories. The xTAG\u00ae Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) from Luminex\u00ae was the first multiplexed molecular assay for respiratory pathogens cleared for in vitro diagnostic use and was capable of detecting 12-19 common respiratory viruses and subtypes, depending on the geographical region [2] . xTAG RVP incorporated multiplex Reverse Transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and multiplex Target Specific Primer Extension (TSPE) with Luminex's xTAG technology, a proprietary universal sequence tag sorting system that allows easy development and optimization of nucleic acid assays on xMAP\u00ae microspheres. In this assay system, samples are spiked with an internal control and subjected to nucleic acid extraction. Nucleic acid extracts are subjected to multiplex RT-PCR and treated with Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase and Exonuclease I (EXO) to inactivate remaining nucleotides and degrade leftover primers. Multiplex TSPE is then used to detect and label any viral nucleic acids that were amplified by PCR, incorporating the unique sequence tag during extension. At the time of its introduction in 2007, it was a major innovation that revolutionized the approach to diagnosis of respiratory infections. While much faster than traditional culture and immunological tests, the entire xTAG RVP procedure still takes approximately 6-8 h to complete. In addition, as an open platform system, there is a potential risk for cross-contamination after specimen extraction and PCR amplification steps [3] .",

The FAST version 1 assay incorporated the original non-magnetic xTAG microspheres whereas the version 2 assay is detected on the magnetic MagPlex-TAG microspheres. Following the nucleic acid extraction and multiplex RT-PCR reaction, an aliquot of the amplified and tagged targets are simultaneously hybridized to the xTAG or MagPlex-TAG microspheres and labeled with reporter dye for detection on either the Luminex\u2122 200 or MAGPIX\u00ae analyzer. This format eliminated the post-PCR clean-up and TSPE steps from the workflow entirely, decreased the time to result by about 2-4 h, and reduced the tube opening/transfer steps down to one. xTAG RVP FAST (and/or xTAG RVP FAST v2) was IVD-cleared for 7-17 targets, depending on the geographical region.",

            "text": "NxTAG\u00ae is the newest generation of universal tag sorting chemistry from Luminex. The NxTAG\u00ae Respiratory Pathogen Panel (RPP) was launched in December 2015. NxTAG RPP incorporates multiplex RT-PCR with the universal tag system in the form of lyophilized reagents to provide a closed system for amplification and detection of 20-21 respiratory viral and bacterial targets. All of the PCR and bead hybridization components, including tagged primers, fluorescently-labeled primers, enzyme, dNTPs, buffers, and MagPlex-TAG microspheres, are combined in precise mixtures and lyophilized into small beads or Lyophilized Bead Reagents (LBRs). LBRs are pre-plated into individual wells of a 96-well plate that allows scalable batch testing for 1 to 96 reactions. Extracted total nucleic acid is added to pre-plated LBRs sealed in individual reaction wells by piercing the pipette tip through a foil seal. The reaction is mixed by pipette to resuspend the reaction components and resealed with a fresh foil seal. The reaction is then amplified via RT-PCR and the reaction product undergoes near simultaneous bead hybridization within the single sealed reaction well. No open procedures are needed after nucleic acid extraction and amplification, thereby virtually eliminating the risk for carryover contamination [4] . The hybridized, tagged beads are then sorted and read on the MAGPIX\u00ae instrument, and the signals are analyzed using the NxTAG RPP Assay File for SYNCT\u2122 Software, providing a qualitative call for each of the targets and internal control within each reaction well.",

Nasopharyngeal swab specimens from pediatric or adult subjects who were hospitalized, admitted to a hospital emergency department, visited an outpatient clinic, or resided at a long-term care facility, and exhibited clinical signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection were eligible for inclusion in the prospective study. A total of 2132 clinical specimens that met the study inclusion criteria were prospectively collected from pediatric and adult subjects suspected of having respiratory tract infection. Of these, 934 (43.8%) were collected from January to April 2014 and the remaining 1198 (56.2%) were enrolled between January and March 2015. Table 1 provides a summary of the general demographic information of the prospectively collected nasopharyngeal swabs that were included in the prospective data analysis. Among the 2132 specimens tested by comparator assays (xTAG RVP and bidirectional sequencing), 14.1% were infected with rhinovirus, 12.8% were positive for influenza A, 9.6% were positive for RSV A or B, 6.8% were positive for hMPV (N = 144) and 4.3% were positive for influenza B (N = 91). The prevalence of adenovirus, the coronaviruses (CoV 229E, CoV NL63, CoV 229E, CoV HKU1), parainfluenza viruses (PIV-1, PIV-2, PIV-2, PIV-3 and PIV-4) and human bocavirus (hBoV) in the study population ranged from 0.1% to 3.0%.

Viral and bacterial targets were prepared at 1 \u00d7 10 5 TCID50/mL or 1 \u00d7 10 6 CFU/mL, respectively, or at the highest concentration possible based on the organism stock concentration. Three replicates of each pathogen were extracted and then analyzed with NxTAG RPP. A total of 107 pathogens were tested, of which 80 are not and 27 (21 targets plus additional strains of influenza A H1) are probed by the assay [10, 11] . None of the pathogens included in this study were found to cross-react, with the exception of three strains of non-pandemic influenza A H1 (A/Brisbane/59/07, A/ Solomon Islands/3/2006 and A/Singapore/63/04) (data not shown). These strains cross-reacted with CoV 229E when the titer of the influenza A H1 was above 1 \u00d7 10 4 TCID50/mL. Based on both laboratory testing and in silico prediction, high titers of these three non-pandemic influenza A H1 strains may result in a false positive call for CoV 229E. Based on in silico analysis, there is also a potential that the presence of CoV 229E may cause a false positive influenza H1 call and the presence of PIV-2 may cause a false positive influenza H3 call. Nevertheless no false positive calls were observed with these targets in either the prospective or pre-selected sample sets in the clinical study. Laboratory testing was supplemented with in silico data where prediction rules were used to predict both reactivity and cross-reactivity of specific strains. GenBank sequences for 77 avian, human and swine influenza A strains, 39 adenovirus serotypes, 3 human poliovirus strains and the SARS CoV, were aligned with all primer sequences in the NxTAG RPP. Reactivity and cross-reactivity was predicted based on thermodynamic analysis of mismatches between the primers and genomic sequences. With the exception of one influenza A H5N1 swine strain (A/swine/East Java/UT6010/2007(H5N1)), all strains analyzed are predicted to react with the correct primers but show no cross-reactivity with the other analyte primers in the assay. The H5N1 swine strain is not expected to react with the influenza A primers or any other primers in the assay.",

This technology retains the advantages of Luminex's xTAG universal array technology while providing several enhancements over its predecessors. As with xTAG technology, NxTAG allows for scalable testing which makes it amenable to both low-and high-throughput applications, providing flexibility for routine daily testing of low specimen volumes but also the ability to handle unpredicted increases in sample volume that may occur. Key advancements with NxTAG technology include: a significantly reduced hands-on-time (\u223c7 min for 8 samples), reduced overall turnaround time (approximately 5 h per batch, including extraction), and most notably, the convenience of all RT-PCR and bead hybridization reagents lyophilized and pre-plated into individual wells. This allows all steps of the assay process (post-extraction) to be carried out in a single, closed tube to both maximize the ease-of-use and minimize the risk of cross-contamination. In addition, to accommodate large sample volumes, it would be possible for the user to automate or semi-automate the post-extraction steps through use of standard automated 96-well plate handlers and pipetting robots. Manual set-up, just using a 96-well plate format for the extracted samples and a multichannel pipettor, allows an entire 96-well NxTAG plate to be set up in less than 10 min. The new assay chemistry also leverages new and updated primer designs for the assay targets, in addition to the workflow enhancements.",

Exceptions are noted for PIV-2 and PIV-4, and the bacterial pathogens, where sensitivity values were derived from very few positive specimens, and ranged from 50 to 70%. These two targets exhibited 100% and 97.6% positive agreement in the pre-selected sample set, respectively, where data were generated from 33 and 42 pre-selected positive specimens. A particular strength of a multiplex panel, such as NxTAG RPP, is the ability to detect coinfections. In this study, coinfections were seen in 17.9% of clinical samples. While many of the causative organisms are treated similarly, the ability to accurately detect the organisms present and the most likely pathogen is very important when confronted with several organisms in a sample which are of varying risk to the patient. Furthermore, ability to detect co-infections is most important for organisms that can be treated, such as influenza, RSV, adenovirus, or M. pneumoniae where infection control measures are applied and if the patient population is predominantly immunocompromised. Analytical performance is also similar to somewhat better than the preceding xTAG and xTAG FAST assays, with LoDs ranging from 3.37 \u00d7 10 \u22123 to 2.82 \u00d7 10 1 TCID50/mL as compared to LoDs of 3 \u00d7 10 \u22122 to 8 \u00d7 10 3 TCID50/mL for the previous assays [10, [13] [14] [15] .",

The overall agreement between the assays was very high, as indicated by Kappa coefficients ranging from 0.85 for hMPV up to 0.96 for RSV A and 96.2% agreement for rhinovirus/enterovirus and 100% for influenza A, influenza B, PIV-4 and RSV B. The high sample throughput and low hands-on time make NxTAG RPP suitable for screening clinical samples for respiratory pathogens.",

            "text": "The NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel is the newest generation of bead-based multiplexing for respiratory pathogen detection available from Luminex. Based on NxTAG chemistry, it provides several advantages over the previous xTAG universal array chemistry. All reaction components are provided lyophilized and pre-plated into individual, sealed reaction wells. Once the extracted nucleic acid sample is added and the well is resealed, there is no further hands-on manipulation. This workflow both maximizes ease-of-use and minimizes risk of cross-contamination. As described in this protocol, after set-up, the reactions are processed on a thermal cycler and then read in the MAGPIX analyzer. The prospective multi-center study and several published studies described herein demonstrate the high accuracy of NxTAG RPP as compared to its xTAG predecessors and other multiplex assays, combined with a simplified workflow, low hands-on-time and scalable throughput that can meet the needs of a variety of laboratory settings.",
