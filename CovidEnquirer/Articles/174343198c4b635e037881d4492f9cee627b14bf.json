Astrocytes are the major target for MHV persistence. However, the mechanisms by which astrocytes survive MHV infection and permit viral persistence are not known. Here we performed DNA microarray analysis on differential gene expression in astrocyte DBT cells by MHV infection and found that the mRNA of the proapoptotic gene BNip3 was significantly decreased following MHV infection. This finding was further confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis, and BNip3-promoterluciferase reporter system. Interestingly, infection with live and ultraviolet light-inactivated viruses equally repressed BNip3 expression, indicating that the down-regulation of BNip3 expression does not require virus replication and is mediated during cell entry. Furthermore, treatment of cells with chloroquine, which blocks the acidification of endosomes, significantly inhibited the repression of the BNip3 promoter activity induced by the acidic pH-dependent MHV mutant OBLV60, which enters cells via endocytosis, indicating that the down-regulation of BNip3 expression is mediated by fusion between viral envelope and cell membranes during entry. Deletion analysis showed that the sequence between nucleotides 262 and 550 of the 588-base-pair BNip3 promoter is necessary and sufficient for driving the BNip3 expression and that it contains signals that are responsible for MHV-induced down-regulation of BNip3 expression in DBT cells. These results may provide insights into the mechanisms by which MHV evades host antiviral defense and promotes cell survival, thereby allowing its persistence in the host astrocytes.",

            "text": "Viruses can cause different types or patterns of infection in susceptible hosts; host cells in turn respond to viral infection in many different ways. Some virus-infected cells undergo rapid destruction, whereas others become immortalized. In addition to immune response, host cells often devise countermeasure mechanisms against virus invasion. One of the common antiviral defense strategies operated by host cells is programmed cell death or apoptosis, for apoptosis would eliminate virus-infected cells, thereby blocking the production of progeny virus and limiting the spread of virus to neighboring uninfected cells. However, apoptosis can also be a viral strategy to invade hosts. Many viruses can induce apoptosis in host cells during late stages of the virus life cycle to speed up their release from infected cells and spread to neighboring cells. On the other hand, many viruses have also devised strategies to counter host antiviral defense by inducing an antiapoptotic state in host cells. For examples, human immunodeficiency virus tat protein (Zauli et al., 1995) and Epstein-Barr virus-EBNA4 and -LMP-1 proteins (Silins and Sculley, 1995; Henderson et al., 1991) induce the expression of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, which is the master checkpoint protein of apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway (Hockenbery et al., 1990) . Members of the Bcl-2 family share up to four conserved regions of homology known as Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains, which mediate interactions among themselves (Kelekar and Thompson, 1998) . A delicate balance of interaction between proapoptotic and antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family has been shown to modulate the sensitivity of cells to mitochondrial integrity in response to apoptotic signals . Many viral proteins are Bcl-2 ho-mologs such as adenovirus E1B 19-kDa protein (Ad-E1B 19K) (Chiou et al., 1994) .",

It functions as a proapoptotic protein that both induces apoptosis and increases the sensitivity of cells to apoptosis induced by drugs and granzymes B upon transient expression . Moreover, BNip3 can form heterodimers with antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL and promotes apoptosis by sequestering the antiapoptotic members (Imazu et al., 1999) . Recent evidence from studies in T cells suggests that the BH3-dependent apoptotic pathways can also be turned on by surface receptor via interaction with CD47 (Lamy et al., 2003) . It has been reported that the expression of BNip3 gene is induced by hypoxia (Bruick, 2000; Kubasiak et al., 2002) and a zinc-finger protein, PLAGL2 (Mizutani et al., 2002) , leading to cellular apoptosis.",

            "text": "Murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is an enveloped, positive-strand RNA virus. It contains four or five structural proteins, depending on virus strains. The spike protein (S) is the major peplomer protruding from the virion envelope. It is responsible for virion attachment to host cells via interaction with receptors, induction of fusion between viral envelope and cell membranes during infection, and elicitation of neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune responses (Lai, 1990) . Thus, the S protein is essential for virus infectivity. The hemagglutinin/esterase (HE) has sequence homology with the HEF protein of influenza C virus (Luytjes et al., 1988) . It contains an esterase activity but lacks the receptor-binding activity . It is present on the virion surface only in some MHV strains (such as JHM) but not others (such as A59) La Monica et al., 1992) , and it is thus not essential for virus infectivity. The small envelope (E) protein is acetylated (Yu et al., 1994) and the membrane (M) protein is glycosylated (Niemann et al., 1984) . Both proteins are hydrophobic and largely embedded in the virion envelope. They are essential for virion assembly and morphogenesis (Vennema et al., 1996; Bos et al., 1996) . The nucleocapsid (N) protein is a phosphoprotein that is tightly associated with the viral RNA genome to form the nucleocapsid inside the envelope shell (Stohlman and Lai, 1979) . It has been shown that dephosphorylation of the N protein following viral entry into host cells is a prerequisite step for virus replication (Kalicharran and Dales, 1995; Kalicharran et al., 1996) .",

Interaction between the S protein and the receptor can also mediate endocytosis (Nash and Buchmeier, 1997) .

            "text": "MHV infects rodents, causing hepatitis, nephritis, enteritis, and central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Infection of rodent CNS results in encephalitis and demyelination, the latter of which resembles the multiple sclerosis seen in humans (Lampert et al., 1973; Herndon et al., 1977) . Therefore, MHV has been extensively used as an animal model for studying the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis and other CNS degenerative diseases. In certain mouse strains, demyelination develops during the first week of infection (Woyciechowska et al., 1984) and reaches to a peak at approximately 30 days postinfection (p.i.), at which time infectious virus can no longer be isolated but viral RNAs are still detectable (Fleming et al., 1993; Adami et al., 1995) . The predominant cell type in the CNS for harboring persistent viruses is the astrocyte (Perlman and Ries, 1987) . Indeed, persistent infection can be readily established in animal CNS (Adami et al., 1995; Rowe et al., 1998) and cultured astrocytes (Maeda et al., 1995; Chen and Baric, 1995) . In contrast to the infection in vivo, infectious virus can be recovered from infected, cultured astrocytes after continuous passage of cells for more than 100 days (Chen and Baric, 1995) . Because astrocyte is one of the antigen-presenting cells in the CNS (Fierz et al., 1985) , it can produce diverse proinflammatory molecules such as cytokines, chemokines, and nitric oxide upon stimulation (Van Wagoner and Benveniste, 1999; Huang et al., 2000; Chen and Swanson, 2003) . It has been shown that coronaviruses induce the expression of transforming necrosis factor-(TNF) \u2423, interleukin-(IL) 6, matrix metalloproteinases, and inducible nitric oxide synthase in primary and established astrocytes (Joseph et al., 1993; Zhou et al., 2001; Grzybicki et al., 1997; Kyuwa et al., 1994) . Thus, it is conceivable that infection of astrocytes with MHV can modulate the development of the CNS pathology and alter the course of the disease. In the past, most studies have been focused on how MHV has evolved during persistent infection in the CNS and in cultured cells (Adami et al., 1995; Rowe et al., 1998) . Information on coevolvement of the host has been limited to the alteration of receptors by MHV infection (Chen and Baric, 1996; Sawicki et al., 1995) .",

We found that the expression of a substantial number of genes was either increased or decreased upon MHV infection. Of these, the expression of the proapoptotic gene BNip3 was significantly decreased. A series of subsequent experiments further confirmed this conclusion. Interestingly, the downregulation of BNip3 expression does not require viral replication and is mediated during cell entry. Our results may provide insight into the mechanisms by which MHV evades host antiviral defense and promotes cell survival, thereby allowing its persistence in the host astrocyte.",

As the result, the amount of the target DNA fragment being amplified by PCR would be decreased with an increased amount of competitor DNA being added in the PCR reac-tion. The PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and the intensity of the DNA bands following ethidium bromide staining was determined by densitometry. RNAs were isolated and were subjected to RT with a random primer. cDNAs were amplified by PCR using the primer pair specific to BNip3 as shown in A in the presence of a known amount of the competitor DNA. The competitor DNA was amplified from a deletion construct and was purified from agarose gel. From lanes 1 to 5 and 6 to 10, a 10-fold serially diluted competitor DNA (indicated as copy number) was added to the PCR. The RT-PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gel and visualized by staining with ethedium bromide. Images were taken with the digital camera (UVP). The intensity of each band was determined with the software (Labworks4). Arrows indicate the target PCR products (BNip3) and the competitor PCR product (Comp), respectively.

We used this technique to determine the amount of BNip3 mRNAs at different time points p.i. As shown in Fig. 1C , there was virtually no difference in the amount of BNip3 cDNA between virus-infected and mock-infected cells at 4 h p.i., but an approximately 60% reduction was detected in virus-infected cells at 8 h p.i., as compared with that of mock-infected cells.

The 5\u0408 upstream sequence (promoter) of the BNip3 gene was placed in front of the firefly luciferase gene in the pGL-BNip3 construct ( Fig. 3A ) (Bruick, 2000) . Transient transfection of the pGL-BNip3 DNA into DBT cells that were either infected with MHV at DBT cells were infected with MHV JHM at an m.o.i. of 5 or mockinfected. At 1 h postinfection (p.i.), cells were transfected with 500 ng of pGL3-BNip3 plasmid or the promoterless plasmid pGL3. At 18 h p.i., cell lysates were harvested and luciferase activities measured as described under Materials and methods. The relative luciferase activity in pGL3-BNip3-transfected cells is expressed as fold increase over the luciferase activity in cells transfected with the promoteless pGL3. Data indicate the means of three separate infection/transfection results. Error bars denote standand deviations. The data are representative of six independent experiments. (C) Same as in B, except that the virus was purified through sucrose-gradient ultracentrifugation. (D) Same as in B, except that the transfection was carried out 5 h prior to virus infection and the luciferase activity was determined at 9 and 13 h p.i. o.i. of 5 or mock-infected. At 5, 9, and 13 h p.i., the cells were harvested and lysed. Equal amounts of cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an antibody specific to BNip3 and protein G-Sepharose beads. The precipitates were separated by polyacrylamide gel (12%) electrophoresis. Proteins were then transfered to nitrocellulose membranes and were detected with the same BNip3 antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence by Western blot analysis. An aliquot of an equal amount of cell lysates for each sample was used for analyzing the \u2424-actin protein with the \u2424-actin-specific antibody in Western blot as an internal control. The data are representative of three experiments. M, lysates from mock-infected cells; I, lysates from virus-infected cells. an m.o.i. of 5 or mock-infected as a control resulted in the expression of luciferase activity. Consistent with the results from DNA microarray, RT-PCR and protein detection described above, the luciferase activity was significantly decreased following MHV infection (Fig. 3B ). This result was reproducible in more than 20 independent transfectioninfection experiments. It was also confirmed by using purified virus and UV-irradiated virus (see below).

Because the luciferase reporter system is a very sensitive assay that has been well established and widely used for determining promoter activity and because our results also demonstrated its sensitivity and utility, we used this reporter system as a standard method for all subsequent experiments.",

To rule out this possibility, we used the virus purified through sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. As shown in Fig. 3C , infection of DBT cells with purified virus resulted in a six-fold decrease of luciferase activity as compared to that from mock-infected cells.

In contrast, little reduction of luciferase activity was detected in DBT cells that were infected with UV-inactivated VSV.

We designed experiments to first block downstream processes so that the role of upstream events can be assessed. However, most MHV strains, including JHM and A59, enter cells both via fusion with plasma and endosomal membranes (Nash and Buchmeier, 1997) . This property poses a technical dilemma for not being able to block fusion by the common lysosomotropic agents. Gallagher et al. (1991) isolated several mutants from OBL20 cells persistently infected with MHV JHM (MHV-4). One of these mutant isolates, OBLV60, strictly depends on acidic pH for entry and infectivity. We therefore used this pH-dependent mutant for this purpose. DBT cells were transfected with the pBNip3-Luc reporter plasmid DNA for 5 h, treated with 0, 25, and 50 M of chloroquine for 1 h prior to virus infection, and then infected with OBLV60 or the wild-type JHM at an m.o.i. of 5 in the presence of chloroquine. At 13 h p.i., cell lysates were isolated and luciferase activity determined. Mock-infected and untreated cells were used as controls. As shown in Fig. 5 , treatment of cells with an increasing concentration of chloroquine resulted in an increase of luciferase activities by approximately three fold in OBLV60 infected cells (Fig. 5A) , concomitant with a decrease of virus titer (Fig. 5B ). In contrast, neither the luciferase activities nor the virus titers were significantly affected by chloroquine treatment in JHM-infected DBT cells. These results suggest that fusion between viral envelope and endosomal membranes during OBLV60 infection provides at least in part the signal(s) that triggers the down-regulation of BNip3 gene expression. By extrapolating the data from the mutant virus, we can envision that fusion between viral envelope and plasma/endosomal membranes during wild-type MHV infection is involved in the down-regulation of BNip3 gene expression.",

To identify and dissect such cis-acting elements, we made a series of reporter constructs that contain various deletions in the BNip3 promoter. In an initial experiment, we determined the minimal promoter sequences required for BNip3 gene expression. DBT cells were transfected with various deletion reporter constructs. Transfection with the promoterless vector was used as a negative (basal level) control. At 18 h posttransfection, cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activities. As summarized in Fig. 6 , when deletions were made from the 5\u0408-end to nt 262 (construct Pr-7) and from nt 91 to 262 (construct Pr-6) of the promoter, the luciferase activities retained at 91.5 and 71.1%, respectively, as compared to the full-length promoter, indicating that the upstream half (262 nt) of the promoter is not essential for BNip3 gene expression. In contrast, deletions of nt 262 to 550 (in constructs Pr-4 and Pr-5) essentially abolished the luciferase activity, indicating that the sequence from nt 262 to 550 of the promoter is the cis-acting element required for driving BNip3 gene expression. Further deletion of the downstream sequence (from nt 550 to 591 in Pr-10) resulted in approximately 50% reduc- tion of luciferase activity, suggesting that this sequence can influence the transcription efficiency but is not essential for BNip3 gene expression. Partial or complete deletions of the 288-nt sequence (from nt 262 to 550) in constructs Pr-11, Pr-12, Pr-14, Pr-15, Pr-13, and Pr-9 essentially abolished the luciferase activity.

The reduction of luciferase activities must have resulted from the infection process rather than from general inhibition by MHV replication, because the virus was inactivated by UV irradiation. These results suggest that the negative elements responsive to MHV infection reside within the same region of the promoter that is required for BNip3 expression. We were unable to narrow down further the minimal responsive elements because further deletions within this region in the reporter constructs drastically abrogate the reporter gene expression even in the absence of virus infection (constructs Pr-5, Pr-11, Pr-12, Pr-14, Pr-13, and Pr-9).",

It has been shown that MHV infection induces apoptosis in macrophages and fibroblast cells but not in DBT cells (Belyavsky, et al., 1998; An et al., 1999; Chen and Makino, 2002) . However, overexpression of the single viral E protein in DBT cells by a recombinant vaccinia virus results in apoptosis, which can be blocked by overexpression of an antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, indicating the involvement of the mitochondrial pathway in E proteininduced apoptosis in DBT cells . How MHV infection in DBT cells overcomes the apoptotic effect induced by the E protein expression remained unanswered in that study. It is possible that MHV infection of DBT cells induces an antiapoptotic state during an early stage of the virus life cycle through down-regulation of proapoptotic genes such as BNip3 (this study) or up-regulation of antiapoptotic genes (Cai and Zhang, unpublished results). Such an antiapoptotic response would prevent cells from succumbing to apoptosis induced by the viral apoptotic E protein. Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that when DBT cells were treated with apoptotic inducers, fewer cells underwent apoptosis when infected with MHV than mock-infected cells (Cai and Zhang, unpublished results). Although a direct correlation between down-regulation of BNip3 and inhibition of E protein-induced apoptosis in DBT cells has not been determined, the general proapoptotic effect exerted by BNip3 Mizutani et al., 2002; Kubasiak et al., 2002; Lamy et al., 2003) makes the hypothesis conceivable. Moreover, the involvement of the mitochondrial/Bcl-2 pathway in E protein-induced apoptosis correlates well with the functional role of BNip3 as a member of the proapoptotic, mitochondrial/Bcl-2 family. Thus, it is conceivable that down-regulation of BNip3 expression can shift the balance to an antiapoptotic state at the mitochondrial checkpoint.",

However, treatment of DBT cells with chloroquine did not completely block the down-regulation of BNip3 expression by OBLV60 infection (Fig. 5) . One possible interpretation is that a part of the signals that trigger the down-regulation of BNip3 expression has already been induced during virus attachment and endocytosis but prior to fusion between viral envelope and endosomal membranes (in the case of OBLV60 virus), so that inhibition of fusion by chloroquine cannot completely derepress the BNip3 promoter activity. Alternatively, the partial restoration of BNip3 promoter activity may be due to incomplete blockage of fusion by chloroquine. This is possible and even likely because the virus infectivity was reduced by approximately only 1 log10 by chloroquine treatment (at 50 M). Although Gallagher et al. (1991) reported a reduction of 3 log10 in virus titer when DBT cells were treated with chloroquine at 50 M, they used approximately 3 log10 less virus for infection. In our infection-transfection experiments, we had to use a higher m.o.i. to insure that each transfected cell is infected with a virus. The higher virus infectivity used in this study likely contributes to a lesser effective inhibition by chloroquine. Therefore, although it cannot exclude the possibility that virus attachment to cell receptors and the subsequent endocytosis are also involved in signaling BNip3 down-regulation, our results clearly establish that virus-cell fusion during entry triggers the signaling cascade.",

Our systematic deletion analyses identified the 288-nt sequence (from nt 262 to 550) of the BNip3 promoter, which is necessary and sufficient for the expression of BNip3 gene. Interestingly, this region also contains the two previously identified hypoxia response elements (HRE-1 and HRE-2) (Bruick, 2000) , the TATA box, four transcription factor Sp1-binding sites, the CAC or CCACC consensus sequence, the CCAAT box, and the nuclear factor-(NF) 1-binding site (Fig. 6B) . It is not known whether and how these transcription factors are involved in the regulation of BNip3 gene expression. It has been reported that the transcription factor hypoxia-inducing factor-1 binds to the HREs on the BNip3 promoter and induces the BNip3 expression (Bruick, 2000; Kubasiak et al., 2002) , whereas the zinc-finger protein PLAGL2 induces the expression of BNip3 via the same HREs, but independent of the hypoxia-inducing factor-1 (Mizutani et al., 2002) . Our finding that further deletions within this 288-nt region inactivated the promoter suggests that BNip3 transcription in DBT cells likely requires multiple transcription factors acting in concert with these cis-elements.",

            "text": "The mechanism by which MHV infection of DBT cells downregulates BNip3 gene expression is currently unknown. We have attempted to identify the negative elements that are responsive to MHV infection. Our results showed that the negative, MHV-responsive elements largely overlap with the cis-acting elements essential for BNip3 transcription (Fig. 6) . One hypothesis is that MHV infection triggers the induction of one or more transcription factors that act on the 288-nt sequence of the BNip3 promoter to compete with the positive transcription regulators, thereby down-regulating the transcription of BNip3 on infection. In our DNA microarray analysis, we found that the expression of a class of early response transcription factors such as c-fos (12-fold increase) and early growth response gene-1 (Egr-1) (9-fold increase) was significantly induced by MHV infection (data not shown). Preliminary studies employing transient cotransfection of DBT cells with plasmids expressing c-fos or Egr-1 gene and the BNip3 promoter reporter plasmid demonstrated that the BNip3 promoter was down-regulated by Egr-1 in a dose-dependent manner but not by c-fos, suggesting that the down-regulation of BNip3 gene expression by MHV infection might be mediated through the induction of Egr-1 (data not shown). It has been shown that Egr-1 and Sp1 share the consensus binding sequence and that Egr-1 can act as an antagonist of Sp1 by binding to the Sp1 consensus sequence and represses transcription (Huang et al., 1997) . Our analysis of the 288-nt BNip3 promoter sequence (from nt 262 to nt 550) identified four Sp1-binding sites: two upstream at nt 285 and 320 and two downstream at nt 441 and 496, respectively. Coincidently, MHV infection of DBT cells inhibited the luciferase expression in all reporter plasmids that contain the two or four Sp1-binding sites (Fig. 6) . However, direct evidence for the role of Egr-1 in MHV-dependent transcriptional regulation of BNip3 gene remains to be established. A recent study showed that overexpression of Egr-1 resulted in down-regulation of BNip3 transcription in prostate cancer cells (Virolle et al., 2003) , thus providing supporting evidence for the role of Egr-1 in regulating BNip3 gene.",

The digested plasmids were purified with the gel extraction kit (Qiagen) following agarose gel electrophoresis, blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase, and self religated with T4 DNA ligase, resulting in generation of pGL3-BNip3-Pr7, pGL3-BNip3-Pr4, and pGL3-BNip3-Pr5, respectively (Fig. 6) . Deletion mutants pGL3-BNip3-Pr10, pGL3-BNip3-Pr11, pGL3-BNip3-Pr12, pGL3-BNip3-Pr14, pGL3-BNip3-Pr15, and pGL3-BNip3-Pr6 were made similarly by deleting the internal fragments through double digestion with StuI and NcoI, Pf1 MI and NcoI, BstXI and NcoI, Pf1MI and StuI, BstXI and Pfl MI, or ApaI alone (two sites), respectively. For construction of pGL3-BNip3-Pr13 and pGL3-BNip3-Pr9, the 138-nt Pf1MI-StuI fragment and the 224-nt ApaI-ApaI fragment were blunt-ended and cloned into the SmaI site of the pGL3-Basic vector. The orientation of these fragments in the plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing.",

When the cells reached to approximately 60% confluency, \u03f7500 ng of plasmid DNAs and 3 l of the LipofectAmine reagent were diluted separately in 100 l of serum-free OPTI medium without antibiotics, mixed, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min before adding to each well of the 24-well plate. DBT cells were washed with PBS and 300 l of OPTI medium were added to each well of the cell culture. The DNA-lipofect Amine mixture (200 l) was added to each well and the cell culture plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for various time periods as indicated. For luciferase assay, cells were harvested along with culture medium and lysed by freezing and thawing. One hundred microliters of the cell lysate was assayed for luciferase activity using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) in a microtiter plate Luminometer (Dynex Technologies, Inc.).",
