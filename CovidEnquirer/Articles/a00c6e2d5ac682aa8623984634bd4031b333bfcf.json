Since its introduction 10 years ago [1], yeast surface display has been used to engineer a variety of proteins for improved affinity, specificity, expression, stability, and catalytic activity. A significant feature of the yeast surface display system is its employment of a eukaryotic host possessing the secretory biosynthetic apparatus for promoting efficient oxidative protein folding and N-linked glycosylation. As such, a diverse assortment of proteins has been successfully displayed on the surface of yeast, enabling their subsequent engineering by yeast surface display. As shown in Figure 1 , these include growth factors, antibody fragments, and complex cell-surface receptors such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), demonstrating the complexity of proteins amenable to engineering by yeast display. However, although well suited to biosynthesis of secreted eukaryotic proteins, the yeast secretory pathway is likely to inefficiently express some cytoplasmic or nuclear proteins due to the presence of multiple reduced cysteines (e.g. zinc finger proteins). Other key beneficial attributes of yeast display include: rapid and quantitative library screening by fluorescence-activated cell sorting; minimization of artifacts due to host-expression-bias through concurrent expression labeling; and convenient evaluation of mutant characteristics (e.g. affinity, stability) in surface-displayed format without soluble expression and purification of each individual clone [2 ].",

For instance, yeast surface display was employed for a proteome-wide search of proteins that interact with either EGFR or focal adhesion kinase, in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner [4] . By displaying a human cDNA library on the surface of yeast and screening with synthetic phosphopeptides, the authors identified several interactions previously unreported [4]. Renner and colleagues recently used yeast-displayed tumor antigens to assess tumor-specific antibody responses in cancer patients [5, 6] and have also screened a yeastdisplayed cancer-patient cDNA library for novel tumor antigens [7] . Notably, the screening of yeast-displayed libraries revealed many tumor antigens not previously detected from prokaryote-displayed libraries [7] . However, given the formal possibility that mimotopes could be selected due to expression of frameshifted peptides, confirmation of antisera binding to expressed gene products is necessary following such screens. In addition, several groups have isolated novel lead antibodies binding to a variety of targets, from immune [8] or nonimmune [9-12] human single-chain variable fragment (scFv) libraries.",

For example, after affinity maturing several scFvs against botulinum neurotoxin type A1 [15], Marks and colleagues were able to broaden the specificity of the most potent clone, using a dual-selection strategy, to achieve high-affinity binding to type A2 while retaining high-affinity binding to type A1 [16 ] .

Several groups have employed the procedure of random mutagenesis, yeast display induction, and high-display screening to improve the stability and expression of proteins, including scTCRs [ Improvement of soluble expression levels can also be achieved through engineering the expression host instead of the protein itself. Here, yeast display allows the establishment of the critical link between the desirable highsecretion phenotype and its causative genotype. Wentz and Shusta recently employed yeast surface display to screen a yeast cDNA library for yeast genes whose overexpression improved the yield of scFvs and scTCRs [29] . The authors found Aga2p fusion to alter the secretory processing of the heterologous protein, necessitating the performance of screens under conditions where the dominant determinant of display level is the heterologous protein and not Aga2p [29] . Nonetheless, they identified several genes whose over-expression enhanced secretion even in the absence of Aga2p. An approach that eliminates the potential artifacts resulting from Aga2p fusion but that still maintains the link between secretory phenotype and genotype has been reported by Rakestraw et al. [30] . Here, yeast are first tagged with the target protein's binding partner, which subsequently captures the protein of interest as it is secreted by the cell [30] . Mathematical modeling and experimental observations indicate that this selection method is capable of distinguishing subtle differences in secretion level and also possesses a sizable time window for library screening [30] . In addition, since the binding partner is used as bait, only clones secreting well-folded proteins are selected. Comparison of numbers of studies employing phage or yeast display. ",

As yeast expressing high-affinity variants can form conjugates with mammalian cells, they are selectively enriched through retention in the upper layer [41 ] .

Recently, the yeast surface display platform was adapted for identifying such residues in a systematic and high-throughput manner. Specifically, as demonstrated by Chao et al. for EGFR and several anti-EGFR antibodies, screening yeast-displayed libraries of the antigen yields epitope maps with residuelevel resolution [31 ]. Notably, this technique enables the identification of discontinuous and conformational epitopes. Also, it interrogates protein-protein interactions more comprehensively than alanine scanning. Indeed, Chao et al. noted several energetically important residues for which alanine scanning would have yielded false negative results [31 ].",
