            "text": "Puja Sodhi MD FRCA Pierre Fiset MD FRCPC Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common gastrointestinal (GI) emergency in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), making it one of the leading causes of long-term disability in preterm infants. NEC is called 'the disease of survivors' as it is characteristically manifest in preterm infants, who have survived other immediate life-threatening complications associated with their very low birth weights (,1500 g), such as respiratory distress syndrome and congenital cardiac anomalies. 1 Clinical presentation NEC presents with both GI and systemic signs usually within 3-10 days of preterm birth, although the presentation can be delayed. Typically, a preterm neonate would develop NEC after its first enteral feed when the intestinal lumen first becomes colonized with bacteria. The most common presentation of NEC is intolerance to enteral feeding, abdominal tenderness and distension, bloody diarrhoea, lethargy (evident by reduced spontaneous motor activity), respiratory distress, shock, and body temperature instability.",

Haemorrhagic disease of the newborn may also cause diagnostic confusion as although the neonate is not septic, bleeding through the GI tract can mimic NEC. Persistently high levels of C-reactive protein signify the progression of NEC. Bell's stages 2 of NEC may also be used to categorize the severity of NEC based on the above symptoms and signs and by the results of laboratory investigations (Table 1) .

The antenatal diagnosis of reduced diastolic blood flow in the fetal aorta by Doppler velocimetry is associated with increased incidence of NEC. 4 Indomethacin, the most commonly used agent for pharmacological closure of patent ductus arteriosus, is known to cause hypoperfusion of the brain, kidney, and gut. 5 Hence, the use of indomethacin may be implicated as an important contributing factor leading to NEC in preterm infants. 6 Fetal hypoxia and perinatal asphyxia reduce intestinal motility in preterm infants. The distal ileum and the proximal colon which are located at the watershed areas of perfusion by the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries are the most commonly affected bowel segments in neonates with NEC.
