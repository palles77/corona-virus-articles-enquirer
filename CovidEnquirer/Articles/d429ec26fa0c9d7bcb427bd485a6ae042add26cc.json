Here, we determined the effect of L-arginine, D-arginine and non-a amino acids on cellular uptake, splicecorrection activity, cellular toxicity and serum binding for 24 CPP2PMOs. Insertion of 6-aminohexanoic acid (X) or b-alanine (B) residues into oligoarginine R 8 decreased the cellular uptake but increased the splice-correction activity of the resulting compound, with a greater increase for the sequences containing more X residues. Cellular toxicity was not observed for any of the conjugates up to 10 kM. Up to 60 kM, only the conjugates with 5 5 Xs exhibited time-and concentration-dependent toxicity. Substitution of L-arginine with D-arginine did not increase uptake or splice-correction activity. High concentration of serum significantly decreased the uptake and splice-correction activity of oligoarginine conjugates, but had much less effect on the conjugates containing X or B. In summary, incorporation of X/B into oligoarginine enhanced the antisense activity and serum-binding profile of CPP\u00c0PMO. Toxicity of X/B-containing conjugates was affected by the number of Xs, treatment time and concentration. More active, stable and less toxic CPPs can be designed by optimizing the position and number of R, D-R, X and B residues.",

Conjugation of PMO to short CPPs is a good method to enhance the cytoplasmic and nuclear delivery of PMO because the conjugates are simple to use and because the short peptides and their AO conjugates can be easily manufactured and characterized in a qualitycontrolled manner. Examples of well-studied CPP\u00c0PMO conjugates include those with Tat and oligoarginine peptides (3, 4) Important considerations in the design of effective CPPs include the ability to deliver AO efficiently, stability in living systems and toxicity. We have reported that Tat and oligoarginine peptides are not stable in human serum (5) , and are therefore ill-suited for in vivo applications. Oligoarginine peptides incorporating non-a amino acids have been proven superior to oligoarginine alone. CPPs containing 6-aminohexanoic acid (X) and b-alanine (B) were more stable in human serum than Tat or oligoarginine peptides (5) . A CPP\u00c0PMO conjugate, (RXR) 4 \u00c0PMO, has been shown to be more efficient in the correction of pre-mRNA mis-splicing (6) and in inhibition of the replication of mouse hepatitis virus in vivo (7) than an oligoarginine peptide. In addition, (RXR) 4 \u00c0PMO conjugates have been shown to cause effective exon skipping in muscle cells from DMD dogs (8) , in human muscle explants (9) and in mdx mice (10) , as well as inhibiting the replication of various viruses in cell cultures (7, (11) (12) (13) and in mice (7, 13) .",

In pursuit of CPPs with improved characteristics, we have carried out a structure-activity relationship study to investigate the effects of unnatural amino acid insertions in oligoarginine peptides on cellular delivery, nuclear antisense activity, toxicity and serum-binding characteristics of the resulting CPP\u00c0PMO conjugates. The unnatural amino acids studied here are X, B and D-arginine (r). We chose to study the X amino acid based on the successes of the (RXR) 4 CPP in several studies as shown in the previous paragraph. B and r amino acids were chosen because they have good enzymatic stability (5) . The CPPs are (i) the oligoarginine sequences, R 8 and R 9 , (ii) sequences with RXR, RX and RB repeats, as well as various combinations thereof, and (iii) sequences containing D-arginine, r 8 , (rX) 8 (rXR) 4 , (rXr) 4 and (rB) 8 . The CPP\u00c0PMO conjugates were evaluated for their relative (a) cellular uptake, as determined by flow cytometry, (b) antisense activity, as determined by a splice correction assay (13) and (c) cellular toxicity, as determined by MTT cell viability, propidium iodide membrane integrity and hemolysis assays, as well as by microscopic imaging.",

The antisense PMO (CCT CTT ACC TCA GTT ACA) is designed to target a b-thalassemic mutant splice site present in the human b-globin intron 2 of a positive-readout antisense activity assay system (13) as described in the Results section. Synthesis of PMO, described previously (15, 16) , and the CPPs, using standard Fmoc chemistry (17) , were performed at AVI BioPharma, achieving purities of 490% as determined by HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis. Conjugation of a CPP to a PMO through an amide linker, described previously (6) , was followed with an additional purification step to remove nonconjugated peptide. Samples were loaded on source 30S resin (Amersham Biosciences, Pittsburgh, PA) in a 2 ml Biorad (Hercules, CA) MT2 column at 2 ml/min with running buffer A (20 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 25% acetonitrile, pH 7.0) and purified into 45-s fractions with 0-35% buffer gradient (buffer B: 1.5M NaCl, 20 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 25% acetonitrile, pH 7.0) over 60 min, using a Biorad BioLogic low pressure chromatography system. The desired faction was desalted by a method described previously (6) . HPLC and MS analyses revealed that the final product contained 490% CPP conjugated to fulllength PMO, with the balance composed of CPP conjugated to incomplete PMO sequence, nonconjugated full-length or incomplete PMO.",

This assay utilizes the ability of steric-blocking AOs to block a splice site created by a mutation in order to restore normal splicing. The luciferase coding sequence was interrupted by the human b-globin thalassemic intron 2 which carried a mutated splice site at nucleotide 705. HeLa cells were stably transfected with the plasmid therefore named as pLuc705 cell. In the pLuc705 system, steric-blocking AOs must be present in the cell nucleus for splicing correction to occur. Advantages of this system include the positive readout and high signal-to-noise ratio. With this system the relative efficiencies of various CPPs to deliver an AO with sequence appropriate for splice-correction to cell nuclei can be easily compared.",

PI can only permeate unhealthy/damaged membranes, so positive PI fluorescence indicates compromised cell membranes. Only (RXR) 4 \u00c0 and (RX) 8 \u00c0PMO conjugates were found to significantly affect membrane integrity at higher concentrations (up to 60 mM tested). Figure 8A shows the histograms of pLuc705 cells treated with (RXR) 4 \u00c0PMO at 60 mM for 0.5, 5 and 24 h. The PI positive (PI+) region was defined by the cells permeabilized with ethanol (positive control) as indicated by the gate in the histogram. The PI histogram shifts from the PI-negative region to PI-positive region in the longer incubations, indicating the conjugate caused membrane leakage in a time-dependent manner. The 0.5-and 5-h-treatments caused a slight shift towards the PI+ region, while the 24-htreatment produced a distinct peak which corresponded to 57% of cells that were in the PI+ region. Figure 8B shows the histograms of cells treated with (RXR) 4 \u00c0PMO at concentrations of 2, 10, 20, 40 and 60 mM for 24 h. There was no significant PI uptake at concentrations up to 20 mM. At higher concentrations, the PI+ population appeared and the percentage of PI+ cells increased as the treatment concentration increased, indicating that there were more leaking cells at the higher treatment concentration. Similar concentrationand time-dependent PI uptake profiles were observed for (RX) 8 \u00c0PMO but not for (RB) 8 \u00c0PMO and the remaining conjugates (data not shown). Addition of 10% serum to the treatment medium significantly reduced membrane toxicity for the (RXR) 4 \u00c0 ( Figure 8C ) and (RX) 8 \u00c0PMO conjugates (data not shown).",

We have found that cell surface proteoglycans were involved with binding of the Tat\u00c0, R 9 F 2 \u00c0 and (RXR) 4 \u00c0PMO conjugates with the (RXR) 4 conjugate having the lowest binding affinity. Insertion of X into an oligoarginine CPP reduces the charge density and may lead to decreased binding affinity for proteoglycans. Despite the lower cellular uptake of X/B-containing CPP-PMO, they generated higher antisense activities in the cell nucleus than oligoarginine\u00c0PMO. We have found that endocytosis was the internalization mechanism (at least primarily) for oligoarginine-and (RXR) 4 \u00c0PMO conjugates. Indication of different uptake mechanisms was not found among these conjugates (6) . Therefore we hypothesize that X/B-containing conjugates have a greater ability to escape from endosomes/lysosomes than oligoarginine conjugates by a mechanism as yet to be studied.",

However, these conjugates were toxic to cells at higher concentrations, which may be a concern when considering potential applications for in vivo delivery of PMO. Replacement of all 8 Xs with Bs decreased both toxicity and antisense activity. The combination of 3-4 Xs with several B residues yielded CPPs with no detectable toxicity, and at some concentrations several of them had similar antisense activity as (RX) 8 \u00c0PMO. We think this type of CPP, having Bs and fewer than 5 Xs, will offer balanced activity and low toxicity as well as the stability, and have considerable potential for delivery of therapeutic AOs. Further investigation into the toxicity and activity versus dosing levels of these CPPs in vivo is warranted.",

Our observation is different from the results reported by others (20, 21) who found that D-CPPs had higher cellular uptake than L-CPPs, although no biological functional cargo was used in their study. The difference between results may be due to the type and size of cargos and the cell lines used for the assays.

It is apparent that these two conjugates caused little immediate membrane damage with 0.5 or 5 h treatment at concentrations as high as 60 mM (Figure 8 ). However, these two conjugates had dose-dependent toxicity with 24 hr treatment as shown by the leaky cell membranes and fewer cells compared to controls ( Figure 6C&D, Figure 8 ). Interestingly, the replacement of Xs with Bs in (RX) 8 \u00c0PMO abolished the toxicity, and the replacement of L-arginine with D-arginine reduced the toxicity of (RX) 8 \u00c0PMO ( Figure 6 ). We have found that (rX) 8 \u00c0PMO was completely stable and the peptide portion of (RB) 8 \u00c0PMO was only partially degraded, whereas the peptide portion of (RX) 8 \u00c0PMO was completely degraded in cells (5) . We wondered whether the difference in toxicity among (RX) 8 , (RB) 8 and (rX) 8 \u00c0PMO conjugates was caused by differences in intracellular stability, resulting in the metabolized products of (RX) 8 \u00c0PMO producing toxicity. The identifiable metabolized products of (RX) 8 \u00c0PMO were XRXB\u00c0PMO and XB\u00c0PMO (5) but neither product had any detectable toxicity as measured by MTT assay (data not shown). It is possible that the CPP portion was degraded into free amino acids and/or smaller peptide fragments which were toxic. However, our investigation revealed that neither free R nor X, alone or in combination, caused cellular toxicity. Another possibility is that because of the high hydrophobicity of X compared to B, X in combination with positively charged arginine residues leads to toxicity not generated by B residue combinations. However, this explanation does not account for the difference in toxicity observed between (RX) 8 \u00c0PMO and (rX) 8 \u00c0PMO, which have the same hydrophobicity. Perhaps the toxicity of (RXR) 4 \u00c0PMO and (RX) 8 \u00c0PMO was caused by the peptide fragments that we could not identify by mass spectrometry.",
