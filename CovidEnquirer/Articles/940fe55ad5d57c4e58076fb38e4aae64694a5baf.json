Methods: In this study, we investigated whether C-class CpG ODN (CpG ODN-685) could facilitate tumor cell lysate to induce vigorous anti-tumor activity against tumors in mice both prophylactically and therapeutically. Results: It was found that the combination of tumor cell lysate and CpG ODN-685 could inhibit the growth of B16 melanoma and prolong the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Moreover CpG ODN-685 with the addition of tumor cell lysate can also cause the generation of tumor specific immune memory by inducing specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes and helper T lymphocytes in mice.",

            "text": "Effective initiation of specific anti-tumor immunity in vivo or in vitro has been investigated by many scientists [1] [2] [3] . Most of their research has focused on the induction of adequate tumor antigen-specific effector cells. For this purpose, tumor antigens or tumor-associated antigens were prepared in vitro by expressing them to produce recombinant peptides, cloning them to construct recombinant DNA vaccines, or loading them to dendritic cells (DCs) to making DC vaccines [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . All efforts were devoted to efficiently conjugate tumor antigens to T cells so that immune tolerance could be broken. Many studies revealed promising results for inhibiting tumor growth inhibition and elongation of animal survival in animal tu-mor models. However, tumor is a multiple genetic disease and targeting one or two signaling molecules in tumor cells may be not enough to inhibit growth 12, 13 . The use of tumor lysate as tumor antigens was developed and utilized for many tumor cell lines in modified ways and proved to be an effective strategy to inhibit growth [14] [15] [16] . Most studies showed undesired results in inducing specific anti-tumor immunity, while others manifested potential anti-tumor effects [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . The advantage of using tumor lysate as antigens is that it provides a feasible avenue to target multiple sites on tumor cells. Various attempts had been made to enhance the antigenicity of tumor lysate, such as plusing DC to tumor lysate or combining Ivyspring International Publisher cytokines (e.g. GM-CSF) with tumor lysate. These methods have demonstrated efficacy in some tumor types but not for all. Despite this, the use of tumor lysates as a potential anti-tumor vaccine has proved to be a valuable tool.",

Based on their biological activities, CpG ODNs are divided into A, B and C classes. A-class CpG ODN mainly induced plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) to secret large amounts of interferon-\u03b1 thereby indirectly activating NK cells. B-class CpG ODN strongly stimulated strong B cells, NK cells activation, or cytokine secretion 28 . C-class CpG ODN share both of the properties of A-class and B-class CpG ODN 29, 30 . To test whether CpG ODN could enhance the anti-tumor effect of tumor cell lysate-based tumor vaccines, CpG685, a C-class CpG ODN, was used as an adjuvant to induce anti-tumor immune response against B16 melanoma in mice.",

Splenocytes were isolated on day 30 after the third immunization and cultured with mitomycin C treated B16 tumor cells for 5d to generate the effector cells. The resulting effector cells were co-cultured with double-stained (PKH26 & CFSE) B16 target cells in ratios of 100:1, 50:1 and 25:1 for 4 h. We also used L929 cells as negative control to B16 target cells (data not shown). The results showed that lysate alone displayed a specific anti-tumor effect whereas CpG ODN-685 alone failed to show specific anti-tumor effect. Expectedly, CpG ODN-685 plus lysate displayed stronger specific anti-tumor response than lysate alone (p<0.01) ( Fig. 2A) , suggesting that CpG ODN-685 assists lysate to induce tumor antigen-specific cytotoxic immune response. Next, anti-lysate antibody in sera from mice was detected using indirect ELISA with tumor lysate as the coating antigen. Subsequent results demonstrate that serum antibody levels of mice treated with lysate only and mice treated with lysate plus CpG ODN-685 only increased on day 7 after the 2 nd immunization. Antibody levels were only significantly increased in mice treated with lysate plus CpG ODN-685 group after the 3 rd immunization (p<0.05) (Fig. 2B) . To confirm whether CpG ODN plus lysate would induce immune memory to melanoma cells in mice, we selected six tumor-free mice, which had undergone CpG ODN plus lysate immunization three times from day -16, -9 and -2 before B16 cell inoculations, as models after living more than 60 days for observation of specific anti-tumor immune response. The na\u00efve mice were used as negative control. Both experimental and na\u00efve mice were re-challenged with B16 cells (7.5\u00d710 4 ) .

After the 3 rd immunization, mice were challenged i.p. with 7.5\u00d710 4 B16 melanoma cells. At 24, 48 and 72h after tumor cell challenge, the spleens were isolated and then stained with different fluorescence-labeled antibodies to analyze CD4, CD8, NK1.1 and CD4CD25 positive cells by flow cytometry. Mice injected with PBS served as negative controls. CD8 positive cells were decreased in spleens isolated from CpG ODN-685 plus lysate immunized mice at 24h after being challenged with tumor cells, compared to spleens from PBS injected mice. Likewise, spleens isolated from CpG ODN-685 plus lysate immunized mice displayed significantly higher CD4/CD25 positive cells compared to spleens isolated from mice immunized with PBS. In contrast, the number of those cells in the spleens did not change at 48h and 72h. The proportion of NK 1.1 + cell and CD4/CD25 positive cells in mice immunized with CpG 685 plus lysate was lower than that of PBS group at 72h. In contrast, the number of CD4 + cells in the spleens did not changed at 24h, 48h and 72h (Fig.  4) . Next, we investigated the kinetics of lymphocyte around the local site of tumor burden and the infiltration of lymphocyte in the greater omentum and peritoneal lavage. Cells from peritoneal lavage were stained with different fluorescence-labeled antibodies to analyze CD4, CD8, NK1.1 + and CD25 positive cells by flow cytometry. PBS-injected mice were used as negative controls. The proportion of CD4 + T cell was much higher in mice immunized with lysate+CpG685 than the control group at 24~48h. This number decreased at 72h and eventually became lower than that of the PBS group. For CD8 + T cells, the cell number increased at 24h but decreased at in 48h. The cell number of CD8 + T cells in lysate + CpG ODN-685 group was higher than that of PBS group (Fig.5B) . For NK1.1 + cells, the cell number increased at 24, 48, 72h mice immunized with lysate + CpG ODN-685 group, particularly in 48h (p<0.01 vs. PBS group). CD4 + /CD25 + cell increased significantly at 24h in mice immunized with lysate plus CpG-685 but significantly decreased at 72h (Fig. 5D) . And there were no significantly difference between PBS group and lysate only or CpG ODN-685 only group (data not shown). These results showed that NK cells may play an important role in early process of tumor formation and the anti-tumor effect of lysate + CpG ODN-685 may be through the alteration of CD4 + /CD25 + .",

Tumors grew significantly slower in lysate + CpG ODN-685 compared to mice immunized with PBS and lysate but there was no difference with CpG ODN-685 alone (Fig. 6B) . There was no tumor growth in 4 mice that were immunized with lysate+CpG-685 for 20 days after anti-tumor immunity and the rate of tumor was 100% in the group of CpG ODN-685. Cumulative survival showed a similar trendency in tumor growth. In addition, immunization with lysate + CpG ODN-685 could significantly elongate the survival rate of mice (p=0.049 vs. PBS; p=0.001 vs lysate), whereas immunization with CpG ODN-685 alone had no effect (Fig. 6B) . Using the in therapeutic model, mice were injected with B16 tumor cells s.c. on 0d and then immunized with tumor cell lysate with CpG ODN-685, or tumor cell lysate + CpG ODN-685 on the day 2, 9 and 16. Results demonstrate that immunization of lsyate+ CpG ODN-685 didn't protect mice from tumor growth and didn't extend the survival time (p>0.05) (Fig. 6C, D) .

The CpG ODN-685 sequence differs from the A-class sequence 2216 (5'GGGGGACGAT CGTCGGGGGg3') in its primary structure. However, the CpG ODN-685 sequence is similar with C & B-class CpG ODN. Our previous work showed that C-class CpG ODN could induce the production of mixed IFNs including IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3 and at least 11 subtypes of IFN-\u03b1 37 . The importance of NK cell mediated anti-tumor immunity was supported by the evidence that NK cells activated by A-class CpG ODN could induce tumor rejection in a variety of mouse tumors, especially weakly immunogenic tumors such as melanoma and fibrosarcoma [38] [39] [40] . CpG ODN-685 can promote human PBMC cells to enhance CD80 and CpG ODN-685 thereby enhancing HLA A2. It is important for the antigen to be presented efficiently to Th cells. It has been demonstrated that both IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 directly induce cytostatic effects on tumor cells. Indirectly, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 activates innate immune cells including NK cells and macrophages to kill tumor cells. Good antigen delivery systems could target antigen presented cells and prolong antigen presentation by preventing degradation. Regarding the mechanisms of adjuvant action, CpG ODN-685 possesses high efficiency to induce an early and strong cytokine and chemokine-rich environment at the site of injection. CpG ODN-685 can also activate NK cell in the experiment of CD69 expression in PBMCs. These results suggest that CpG ODN-685 is a valid inducer of natural immune response as well as adaptive immune response and that CpG ODN-685 can be used for anti-tumor research. Noticeably, CpG ODN-685 can inhibit tumor growth upon subcutaneously injection into the tumor draining lymph node (TDLN) area in mice.",

            "text": "Comparing results from the in the prophylactic model, we found that using CpG ODN-685 alone was more effective. This may be attributed to the ability of tumor cells to provide sufficient tumor antigen upon CpG ODN usage. Based on our results, in vivo subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injection of CpG ODN-685 or tumor cell lysate could not trigger an effective anti-tumor immune response. However the combination of tumor cell lysate with CpG ODN-685 can lead to an effective immune response. This suggests that both CpG ODN-685 and tumor cell lysate play a role in this immune response. Analysis of lymphocyte transformation in different tumor inoculation locations, suggests that CD4 + /CD8 + T-cells significantly increase within 24~48 h after tumor inoculation. However, there was little change in NK cells or Treg cells. Upon tumor inoculation, it indicated that CD4 + /CD8 + may be involved in this immune response. Results from the CTL assay showed that CD8 + T cells have immune activity. Using CpG ODN-685 alone did not cause an effective CTL response, but CpG ODN-685 combined with tumor cell lysate generated specific CTLs. However, further studies of CpG ODN-685 as an adjuvant for cancer immunotherapy are limited. Our results showed that CpG ODN-685 combined with tumor cell lysate could generate strong T cell responses against B16 tumor cell. Considering tumor cell lysate alone can't effectively cause anti-tumor immune response in mice, we hypothesize that besides CD8 + T cell, lymphocytes are also involved in anti-tumor response. DTH data on mouse survival showed that the degree of foot pad swelling in mice within the combination group was much higher than that of control group. This indicates that CD4 + T cells are involved in the immune response. CTL and DTH data suggested that CD8 + T cell and CD4 + T cell are involved in the immune response which cause by the combination of tumor cell lysate with CpG ODN-685. From these results, we concluded that the combination of tumor cell lysate and CpG685 can induce differentiation of CD8 + T cells, and this effect was under the assistance of CD4 + T cells. These results, however, were different from other results. For example, the combination of CpG1826 and peptide vaccine caused by CD8 + T cell response is not dependent on the assistance of CD4 + T cells. In addition, specific CTLs caused by soluble protein vaccines plus CpG ODN did not require the helper T cell pathway 41, 42 . So we believe that CpG ODN induction of different immune responses may be associated with different types of tumor antigens.",

We presumed that lymphocytes increase could produce an effective immune response, so tumors must be inhibited effectively in these two groups, but the results suggested otherwise. Therefore, we hypothesized that the number of lymphocytes increased when an organism received the external stimuli. Whether these increased lymphocytes could induce the anti-tumor effects or not may depend on the level of lymphocyte affinity. High-affinity CD8 + T cells were more effective in B16 tumor cell inhibition than that of low-affinity CD8 + T cell. Otherwise, invalid T-cell activation could lead to a reduction in T cell proliferation. In addition these pro-liferating cells played a weak role in killing tumor cells and led to tumor tolerance. Therefore, we presumed that CpG ODN-685 combined with tumor cell lysate can be more effective in T cell activation, and these T cells may have higher affinity.",
