            "text": "A study was performed to evaluate porcine torovirus (PToV) seroprevalence and infection in three multi-site farms from the North-eastern region of Spain. Serum samples from 120 piglets and faecal samples from 36 piglets were longitudinally collected at 1, 3, 7, 11 and 15 weeks of age. Serum samples from their dams (n = 30) were also taken 1-week postfarrowing. PToV antibodies in serum were monitored by ELISA, while viral infection was assessed by real-time RT-PCR in faeces. A high seroprevalence (about 100%) was observed in animals older than 11 weeks and in adult sows. Moreover, all 1-week-old animals were seropositive, indicating maternal antibody transference through colostrum. The antibody titers declined to close to or below the ELISA cut-off value by the age of weaning (3 weeks of age). Development of a significant antibody response to PToV occurred before 7 weeks of age in about 50% of piglets, and the remaining animals developed the response by weeks 11 or 15. These results indicate that PToV infection occurred soon after weaning. Although the prevalence of infection in suckling piglets varied among the studied farms, PToV prevalences in 7 and 11-week-old pigs were between 50-67% and 58-75%, respectively, in all farms. Sequencing results indicated that more than one PToV strains were circulating in the studied farms. Present data suggest that PToV was endemic on the studied farms, and provide new insights on the epidemiology of PToV.",

            "text": "Toroviruses are enveloped viruses with a single stranded RNA genome, which belong to the Torovirinae subfamily from the Coronaviridae family within the Nidovirales order (ICTV web site: www.ictvonline.org). Toroviruses are enteric viruses affecting calves (Woode et al., 1982; Brown et al., 1987) , horses (Weiss et al., 1983) , pigs (Scott et al., 1987) and humans (Beards et al., 1986) , and probably other species of domestic animals (Weiss et al., 1984) . The first torovirus identified was the equine torovirus, known as Berne virus or BEV (Weiss et al., 1983) . It is the only torovirus that has been adapted to grow in tissue culture, and thus, is the most thoroughly studied at the molecular level, and the prototype member of the torovirus genus. Nonetheless, most of the available information about torovirus epidemiology has been obtained from bovine torovirus (BToV), since successful experimental infections of gnotobiotic calves can be readily performed, and this, in turn, has facilitated the development of diagnostic methods to detect antibodies in serum samples (Brown et al., 1987) and viral particles in faecal specimens (Koopmans et al., 1990) . BToV was first isolated in United States (Woode et al., 1982) , but it has been later found in other countries such as Canada (Duckmanton et al., 1998) , Japan (Ito et al., 2007) , South Korea (Park et al., 2007) , Austria (Haschek et al., 2006) , United Kingdom (Liebler et al., 1992) , The Netherlands (Koopmans et al., 1989) , Germany (Koop-mans et al., 1989) , Italy (Lavazza, 1989) and South Africa (Vorster and Gerdes, 1993) . Moreover, the infectious cycle of BToV under natural field conditions was established by compiling information from different studies (Hoet and Saif, 2004) . In contrast, little is known about the porcine torovirus (PToV) epidemiology, despite it has been detected in Canada (Durham et al., 1989) , South Africa (Penrith and Gerdes, 1992) , and in different European countries as United Kingdom (Scott et al., 1987) , The Netherlands and Belgium (Kroneman et al., 1998) , Italy (Lavazza et al., 1996; Smits et al., 2003) , Hungary (Matiz et al., 2002) and, recently also in Spain (Pignatelli et al., 2009 (Pignatelli et al., , 2010 . The results of these studies indicated a high prevalence of PToV in porcine herds as well as an extensive geographical distribution of the virus. However, little information about the characteristics of PToV spreading or about the dynamics of PToV infection in piglets is available.",

However, to date, there is little information available about PToV epidemiology. Probably, the impossibility of growing the virus in culture cells has precluded the development of diagnostic methods. Recently, it have been reported the development of an ELISA assay (Pignatelli et al., 2009 ) and a real-time RT-PCR method (Pignatelli et al., 2010) to detect either antibodies to PToV or viral RNA, respectively, in swine samples. Using these methods, it was possible to determine the presence of PToV in the Spanish porcine livestock. In the present work, the longitudinal monitoring of PToV infection was carried out in three Spanish farms. This work further confirmed the presence of PToV in Spanish swine herds, and allowed to determine its infection dynamics during the first 15 weeks of age.",

            "text": "The high prevalence (about 100%) of antibodies against PToV observed both in animals older than 7 weeks and in adult sows, and the high incidence of PToV infection in piglets from all three farms, clearly suggests that PToV is endemic in these farms and probably reflects the widespread nature of this infection. These results are in agreement with previous studies performed with a reduced number of animals from different Spanish farms (Pignatelli et al., 2009 (Pignatelli et al., , 2010 . In addition, the present data about the occurrence of PToV shedding in faeces are similar to those observed in another longitudinal study performed in a small number of piglets from two farms in Central Europe (Kroneman et al., 1998) . Similar virus infection dynamics in young animals have also been described for BToV (Duckmanton et al., 1998) and other enteric viruses such as rotavirus in Danish (Svensmark et al., 1989) and Italian (Martella et al., 2007) farms. The presence of PToV in sows was not evaluated in the present study but it appears to be low according to a previously reported study (Matiz et al., 2002) . Some insights into virus spread can be drawn from the analysis of both blood and faecal samples collected over a 15 weeks period. During the first week of life, when piglets remained with their sows, half of the piglets from farm A and some piglets from farms B and C shed PToV, indicating that those piglets had already been infected and, therefore, sows might be the viral source. As determined from the analyses by ELISA and neutralizing assays, most piglets (92%) from the three farms had received antibodies against PToV through maternal colostrum. No differences between IgG and neutralizing antibody levels were observed between piglets that shed or not the virus at first week of age. Differences were neither observed in the levels of antibodies in serum samples from sows. Hence, the results indicate that, especially in farm A, maternal antibody transfer probably provided a partial or null protection against virus infection in piglets. A potential explanation for the higher rate of infection in farm A could be that sows from this farm shed higher amounts of virus than those from other farms. Unfortunately, faecal samples from sows were not available and, thus, the virus loads in those animals could not be determined. Similar observations about newborn animal infection and virus spreading by adult animals have been previously reported for BToV (Koopmans et al., 1989) and rotaviruses (Snodgrass and Wells, 1978) .",

Similar observations have been reported for BToV in calves from different European herds (Koopmans et al., 1989) and also from studies performed using sentinel calves (Koopmans et al., 1990) . The dynamics of the IgG production against the PToV-N protein after weaning in different animals were categorized in four profiles.

Piglets from farm A shed the same virus strain over the weeks, a finding that is in line with the observation that some piglets from farm A had not developed an immune response after the first contact with the virus at weeks 1 and 3. These animals could be persistently infected with PToV and shed virus intermittently for weeks. Re-infection of intestinal cells in the presence of circulating antibodies might also occur, as it has also been reported with BToV in calves, as well as with rotavirus (Koopmans et al., 1990; Parreno et al., 2004) . These findings would indicate a lack of correlation between serum IgG and mucosal protection (Koopmans et al., 1990) .
