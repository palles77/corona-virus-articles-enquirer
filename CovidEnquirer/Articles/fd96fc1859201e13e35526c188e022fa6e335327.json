Until now, only one article reported transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection from an asymptomatic case in the incubation period in Germany. 9 One article from Germany found SARS-CoV-2 in a throat swab in two asymptomatic cases, 10 and the other article from China suggested the transmission by an asymptomatic carrier of SARS-CoV-2 in a familial cluster of five COVID-19 patients. 11 Compared with the relative small number of asymptomatic cases, the majority of COVID-19 cases when they have no symptoms in their .

Therefore, we believe more effective measures should be taken to stem the transmission of asymptomatic contact during the incubation period. Once a case is confirmed, it is imperative to trace back all the close contacts within at least three days prior to the symptom onset, and then quarantine these close contacts. If a patient has extensive social activities before the symptom onset, the risk of transmission will be greatly increased.

If asymptomatic people who are in the incubation period have the potential to spread the virus, the current quarantine measures are inadequate to contain the spread of COVID-19, especially for those individuals and their family members who were isolated together at home.Due to the shortage of personals for epidemic contain in Wuhan, the close contacts with the confirmed cases prior to symptom onset were not isolated. The quarantine loophole may also explain the occurrence of a lot of familial cluster cases and the rapidly increased number of confirmed cases during the past week in Wuhan city and Hubei province.
