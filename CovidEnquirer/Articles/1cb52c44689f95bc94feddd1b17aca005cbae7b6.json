Among TLRs, TLR3 recognizes dsRNA and is therefore important for defense against viral infections. Upon recognition of viral dsRNA, TLR3 transmits signals that activate transcription factors responsible for the induction of type I interferon (IFN; IFN-a/ b) and IFN-inducible genes, which play critical roles in antiviral host defense (Matsumoto et al., 2002) . Thus, activation of TLR3 signaling is of great importance for defense against BRV, a dsRNA virus, and BCV and BVDV, which replicate via intermediary dsRNA.",

            "text": "Recently, significant progress has been made in understanding the role of TLR3 in innate and adaptive immunity. The majority of studies aimed at dissecting the mechanisms of TLR3 function have been performed principally in mouse and human cell lines (Gauzzi et al., 2010) . However, few studies have been conducted on cattle, despite growing interest in the bovine immune system due to the economic importance of cattle as livestock. Therefore, investigating how TLR3 mediates antiviral defenses in bovine IECs is important for understanding the activation and regulation of the intestinal immune system of cattle. Moreover, determining the underlying mechanisms of TLR3 activation and regulation in bovine IECs may aid in the development of effective therapies for the prevention and treatment of viral diseases, such as oral vaccines and functional feed, which specifically target anti-viral immune responses in the bovine gut. We have recently established a bovine intestinal epithelial (BIE) cell line originally derived from fetal bovine intestinal epitheliocytes (Miyazawa et al., 2010) . In the present study, we aimed to characterize the immune response triggered by TLR3 activation in BIE cells in order to evaluate whether this cell line could serve as an in vitro model of bovine IECs for the study of TLR3-mediated antiviral responses. In addition, we attempted to determine whether BIE cells are suitable for the primary screening of immunomodulatory lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with antiviral protective capabilities in cattle.",

Realtime quantitative PCR was performed using a 7300 Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) using Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix UDG with ROX (Invitrogen). The primers used in this study were: b-actin forward (TGG ATT GGC GGC TCC AT) and reverse (GCT GAT CCA CAT CTG CTG GAA); IFN-a forward (GGT GGC AGC CAG TTA CAG AAG) and reverse (TGC TGG  GTC ACC TCA TGG The PCR cycling conditions consisted of 2 min at 50\u00b0C, followed by 2 min at 95\u00b0C, and then 40 cycles of 15 s at 95\u00b0C, 30 s at 60\u00b0C, and 30 s at 72\u00b0C.

Cytokines, chemokines, and b-actin cDNAs for real-time PCR analysis were amplified using the primers listed above. The PCR products were inserted into the vector pGEM-T Easy DNA (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) using standard techniques. We confirmed the sequence of each insert with the dideoxy chaintermination method using an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The constructed plasmid vectors were applied to calculate the relative expression levels of each cDNA in samples by the relative standard curve method. The expression levels of bactin were used to normalize individual cytokine and chemokine cDNA expression levels in the samples. The relative index of cytokine mRNA in BIE cells stimulated with LAB was calculated by first averaging the target cytokine expression levels from a minimum of three samples stimulated with poly(I:C) and without pre-treatment with LAB. After setting this value as 1, the relative expression of LAB pre-stimulated samples following poly(I:C) stimulation was then calculated.",

We found that the different strains had distinct effects on cytokine production by BIE cells. Notably, L. rhamnosus GG and S. thermophilus TMC1543 were the only strains able to increase IFN-b and IL-6 mRNA, respectively, in BIE cells after 48 h of stimulation. In addition, only L. rhamnosus LA-2 increased MCP-1 mRNA, while this bacterium, L. casei TMC0409, and both B. bifidum strains up-regulated IL-8. It has been shown that many of the immunomodulatory effects of probiotic microorganisms are mediated by their ability to activate TLR2 (Tohno et al., 2005 (Tohno et al., , 2006 (Tohno et al., , 2007 Kitazawa et al., 2008; Alvarez et al., 2009; Fujie et al., in press ). In addition, TLR2 agonists are able to induce IFN-b transcription (Dietrich et al., 2010) . Moreover, it was observed that certain lactobacilli trigger the expression of IFN-b genes in dendritic cells in a TLR2-dependent manner . In our present analyses, we therefore expected to identify strains capable of increasing IFN-b levels in BIE cells; however, we only detected a slight increase of this cytokine in BIE cells treated with L. rhamnosus GG. In addition, we found that the TLR2 agonist Pam3CSK4 was not able to modify the expression of IFN-b in BIE cells. Therefore, the information obtained in these experiments did not allow us to draw any conclusions concerning the antiviral effects of LAB strains in bovine IECs.",

The increased production of IFN-b by BIE cells in response to TLR3 activation induced by L. rhamnosus LA-2 may have significant in vivo effects in the protection against enteric viruses. Global gene-expression analyses of bovine intestinal tissues following infection with BRV or BCV indicate that several IFN-regulatory and -stimulatory genes are down-regulated, supporting the conclusion that both viruses may have evolved mechanism(s) to inhibit IFN-mediated immune responses (Aich et al., 2007) . Moreover, it was shown that BVDV significantly inter-feres with the induction of type I IFN, which impairs not only innate defenses, but also interferes with the establishment of adaptive immune responses (Peterhans et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2008) . Based on these findings, L. rhamnosus LA-2, which enhances IFN-b production in BIE cells, may play an important role in the improvement of innate and specific immune responses against bovine intestinal virus. Thus, our studies with the BIE cell line have allowed us to identify a LAB strain that is a good candidate for future in vivo studies.",

Our analyses demonstrated that BIE cells pretreated with L. casei TMC0409 produce lower levels of the three pro-inflammatory cytokines when compared with control cells 12 h post-stimulation with poly(I:C). It was reported that TLR3 mediates harmful inflammatory responses in the intestine, thus contributing to the pathogenesis of viral infections (Zhou et al., 2007) . Therefore, the lower production of pro-inflammatory cytokines following exposure to L. casei TMC0409 may allow for the efficient regulation of inflammatory responses and avoidance of tissue injury, offering a different protection mechanism against bovine viral infection.",

To define the characteristic immunomodulatory abilities of individual LAB strains, their influence on cytokine production after challenge of BIE cells with TLR3 agonist can be studied using statistical multi-comparison tests, as shown in Fig. 3C . We also demonstrated that TLR3 is expressed in BIE cells and that these cells respond to stimulation with the TLR3 agonist poly(I:C). Characterization of the inflammatory immune response triggered by TLR3 activation in BIE cells showed that this in vitro system can be used for the study of TLR3-mediated immune responses in bovine IECs. In addition, our findings indicate that BIE cells are useful for the primary screening of immunobiotic LAB strains which are able to beneficially modulate the antiviral immune response triggered by TLR3 activation in bovine IECs. Although it is difficult at present to predict if the observed in vitro changes in gene expression are biologically relevant in vivo, given the diverse factors capable of influencing intestinal immune responses, we propose that BIE cells can serve as a useful in vitro tool to identify a small number of potentially immunobiotic strains which can then be subjected to appropriate in vivo trials. In fact, the use of immunobiotic microorganisms in animal feeding is expected to be enhanced by preliminary host-specific in vitro screening tests. The present characterization of BIE cells represents an important step towards the establishment of a valuable bovine in vitro system that could be used for the development of immunomodulatory feed for bovine hosts.",
