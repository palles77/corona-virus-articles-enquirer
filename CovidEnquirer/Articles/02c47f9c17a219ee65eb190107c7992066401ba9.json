Bats are identified as important wildlife hosts of many viruses capable of causing fatal human disease, including members of the henipaviruses, coronaviruses, rhabdoviruses and filoviruses. As global warming and habitat change are thought to impact upon pathogen transmission dynamics and increase the risk of spillover, virus surveillance in bat populations remains a significant component of efforts to improve the prediction and control of potential future disease outbreaks caused by bat-borne viruses.",

Over the past decade significant effort has been devoted to the study of these unique mammals, particularly the mechanisms by which they harbor zoonotic viruses in the absence of clinical signs of disease. Examples include Hendra (HeV) and Nipah (NIV) viruses (genus Henipavirus, family Paramyxoviridae). HeV sporadically spills-over to horses and subsequently humans, causing fatal disease in over 75% and 60% of cases respectively . Surveillance of bat populations is crucial to understanding the dynamics of viral shedding and the biological and environmental drivers that lead to spillover.",

            "text": "Virus surveillance in bat populations is important for the identification of viruses however the process is time consuming, expensive and complex. Molecular methods predominantly reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) are routinely employed for the detection of viral RNA. These assays are highly sensitive and specific for a single intended target but are not suitable to detect and differentiate multiple targets, in a multiplex format these methods are labor intensive and costly (Barnard et al., 2011; Mahony et al., 2010) . MagPlex-TAG, a multi-analyte suspension array commercialized by Luminex Corporation \u00ae , provides a multiplexed bead array system with the potential to combine up to 500 different nucleic acid targets in a single reaction. Each bead set is differentiated and identified by unique internal dyes and the beads are conjugated to specific nucleotide tags that bind to complementary synthesized tags on specific primer sets. A DNA hybridization step incorporates target specific primer extension (TSPE) reactions to a given bead set. A fluorescent conjugate is utilized to detect positive reactions in each bead set by passing through a flow cell where lasers in a Bio-plex 200 instrument identify and sort each bead (Bio-Rad, http Hercules, USA) with results delivered in real-time (Christopher-Hennings et al., 2013; Bossart et al., 2007; Foord et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2011) .",

Bat virus panel assay 1 (BVPA-1) was designed to identify a broad range of paramyxoviruses in Australian bats. The second panel, bat virus panel assay 2 (BVPA-2) was designed to identify paramyxoviruses and filoviruses in non-Australian bat populations. The assays were capable of detecting up to 11 different virus targets simultaneously. Simultaneous surveillance of multiple viral RNA's, adds value to samples collected in the field and allows for the assessment of multi-pathogen transmission dynamics. Surveillance efficiency was further enhanced through the development of a method for pooling samples. This greatly increased the number of samples that could be tested per assay without sacrificing assay sensitivity.",

Internationally, virus surveillance in bats remains a major component of this important effort. Disease and virus surveillance is an arduous process with constraints on sample collection, transport and analysis particularly in remote locations. Sample collection needs to be well coordinated, comprehensive, and longitudinal which demands significant resources both in the field and during subsequence analyses (Hoye et al., 2010) . Although these constraints are significant, surveillance of wildlife species is crucial to the identification and tracking of trends in viral shedding and its association with environmental and population conditions. This was highlighted in Australia where an extensive surveillance study of more than 40 different animal species in Queensland was required to identify bats as the natural reservoir of Hendra virus (Young et al., 1996) . The development of the two novel bat virus panel assays described here represents an important step toward a more effective screening platform for the simultaneous detection of multiple viral pathogens and allows for high sample throughput fulfilling the objectives of a reliable, accurate and cost-effective process of generating surveillance information. The BVPAs developed show high specificity to the targeted viruses and the analytical sensitivity compares favorably to qRT-PCR. The flexible nature of the platform allows for a high degree of customization through the expansion and/or modification of viral targets.",

The background signals for all bead sets in no-template-controls were low, in the range of 50-300 MFI. The two assay approaches utilized different first round amplification strategies; strategy 1 (BVPA-1) employed a single degenerate primer pair for Paramyxoviruses while strategy 2 (BVPA-2) utilized multiple primers to different virus families. BVPA-2 allowed for detection of multiple viral families however the presence of multiple primer sets in the first round amplification increased the potential for cross reactivity, so careful assay design and validation was critical. BVPA-1 also provides for the addition of M13-tags to the primers allowing direct sequencing of products from first round amplification. The pooling strategy described for the extraction of RNA from field samples makes significant savings in reagent cost and processing time however it does increase the likelihood of multiple targets.",

It needs to be recognized that any threshold will exclude positive individuals that are at the beginning or end of the infection cycle. Although the assay platform is not empirically quantitative, the MFI values are indicative of the level of viral RNA present in the sample. Another important consideration in multiplex assays is the issue of competition when samples have multiple viral RNA's present. In this case it is possible that MFI values will be affected by the competition for assay reagents, thus generating lower values for all targets than samples with single viral RNA's. This competition for reagents and subsequent impact on results make multiplex assays less applicable in diagnostic applications. However, for population surveillance applications the need for an absolute determination for each sample is less important than the spatial and temporal trend of virus activity.",

However, this process of evaluation and validation for emerging viral diseases in wildlife is problematic as it can be very difficult to assemble a \"gold standard\" dataset, with samples from both truly positive and negative animals. This is made even more challenging for the viral diseases we are testing for in the flying foxes, as most do not cause any illness or pathology in these animals. Furthermore, as we tested pooled under roost urine specimens, it is impossible to know exactly which animal(s) contributed to the specimen. A third challenge is that many of these emerging viral diseases have only been detected infrequently, and thus the number of potentially positive samples is quite low, and insufficient to undertake validation statistical procedures such as ROC curve analysis to define an optimum threshold value (Greiner et al., 2000) .",

As a first approach, we used simple exploratory methods (i.e. plotting the MFI values and taking 2\u00d7 the median value as our threshold). This was expanded on through the use of the more objective mixture model method. Further work could be undertaken to derive a more biologically justifiable threshold. In particular, the distribution of log values in Fig. 3 indicates that there may be in fact three populations: \"negative\", \"intermediate\" and \"positive\". In order to determine the \"true\" biological status of samples in this indicated intermediate group qRT-PCR could be used for validation, however these samples are often reflected by indeterminate results in this assay as well. The real benefit of our incremental approach is that it enabled us to focus our follow-on validation work to a restricted sub-sample, resulting in the determination of a robust threshold in a cost-effective and timely manner.",

From all combined results as well as the median results for each individual virus targets, which ranged from 206 to 245, the overall threshold we chose was 2\u00d7 the median of the individual assay with the highest background fluorescence resulting in a MFI of \"490\" for Australian and Bangladesh bat urine samples. Histogram of the natural log of the MFI values for thresholds superimposed on the histogram are the two Guassian distributions fitted by the normalmixEM function. The chosen threshold corresponded to the value where the two probability density functions intersected, which when back-transformed equates to an MFI value of \"527.7\" for (A) Australian bat urine samples and \"676.3\" for (B) Bangladesh bat urine samples.",
