In May 2003, several outer islands belonging to Taiwan reported SARS, and on June 2, 2003, Penghu Army Hospital reported a 40year-old man with suspected SARS. The patient complained of shortness of breath and a dry cough. He had visited a person with confirmed SARS 7 days earlier. He had a temperature of 38.4\u00b0C and leukocyte count of 7,920 cells/\u00b5L, and his chest x-ray showed infiltration in both lower lobes.",

The NACC dispatched an aircraft (Fokker 50) with a specialized team of two flight physicians, one flight paramedic, and a PIU (portable isolation unit) on board. During the flight, the medical crew prepared equipment and dressed themselves in three layers of personal protective equipment. On arrival at Penghu, only essential equipment was taken into the hospital. One physician took the PIU into the isolation room. The rest of the crew and equipment remained in the pre-isolation room. The patient was briefed about the transport and given 10 mg of metoclopramide to prevent motion sickness. He was asked to get into the PIU. A pulse oximeter was attached to his finger and placed inside the PIU so that it could be read from the outside. A ther-mohydrometer was also placed inside the unit. The patient was given a squeeze-bottle of water, and the unit was sealed and inflated.",

Smaller aircraft used on domestic routes in Taiwan do not meet the standards set for transporting SARS patients (3, 4) , which prompted the design of the PIU, an airtight polyvinyl chloride bag with a oneway inlet valve and an exhalation valve. The valves were modified by incorporating HEPA filters on both sides of the valves and then connecting a ventilator with an oxygen source to the inlet valve. The respiratory rate and tidal volume are set, depending on weight and oxygen requirements of the patient. By regulating the exhalation valve, the minimum pressure inside the bag can be manipulated to keep it from collapsing, since the bag has no internal or external frame.",

Approximately 20% of the rehabilitated patients showed some negative psychological effects (3), which included insomnia and depression. Some patients with serious cases could not rid themselves of the memories of fighting SARS, and these memories disrupted their daily activities. These psychosocial problems may be due to the complications of SARS medications, such as ribavirin and corticosteroid. Persons who took these drugs had hair loss, major memory loss, impaired concentration, and depression. A medical practitioner in Hong Kong who recovered from SARS attempted suicide because complications from drugs made him unable to earn his living (4).",

Since nearly all resources are devoted to biomedical research and medical treatment, psychosocial problems of SARS patients and their families are largely ignored. Our review of the literature using the ISI Web of Knowledge on January 17, 2004, substantiated this observation.
