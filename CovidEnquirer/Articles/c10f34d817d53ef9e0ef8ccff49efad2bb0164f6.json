They include urinary tract infection, endometritis, wound infection, perineal infection, and sepsis, which lead to prolonged hospital stays and increased health care costs. Much work has been done to study the effect of prophylactic antibiotics in reducing infectious morbidity. A plethora of antibiotic types, dosing schedules, and routes of administration have been investigated. There is evidence to support the use of prophylactic antibiotics for a number of procedures in obstetrics. Unfortunately, few comparative trials have been conducted, leaving the clinician with uncertainty as to which regimen is superior.",

Antibiotic resistance development results mainly from the inappropriate use of antibiotics. Incomplete courses of antibiotic therapies and the unnecessary use of broader spectrum regimens play a role. 2 Adherence to both treatment and prophylaxis guidelines likely assists in reducing infection and antibiotic resistance. Physician adherence to antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines is variable and usually at odds with published guidelines. 3, 4 In addition to antibiotic prophylaxis, it is essential to review all factors that affect infectious risk reduction in obstetrical care. 5 Adherence to appropriate skin preparation procedure, including hair clipping as opposed to shaving, and effective antisepsis of both patient and staff are required. 6 Sterile surgical fields must be ensured, and ongoing quality assessment of sterilization technique, air ventilation, and postoperative wound care is needed. Consistent infection control surveillance and reporting of infectious complications track ability to minimize these morbidities and possibly to identify clusters of infection and the emergence of antibiotic resistant organisms. This will dictate changes to operative routines to respond to evolving microbial diversity that seems inevitable.",

It must also be safe and inexpensive, and it must be effective against organisms likely to be encountered in the surgical procedure. The agent must be administered in a way that ensures that serum and tissue levels are adequate before an incision is made and that therapeutic levels of the agent can be maintained in serum and tissue during surgery and for a few hours (at most) after the incision is closed. 7 Wound infections-surgical site infections-in the form of cellulitis, abscess, or dehiscence can occur following laparotomy. Pelvic infections, such as an abscess or infected hematoma, are a risk with any surgical procedure that enters the abdominal cavity. Cuff cellulitis is a specific risk for hysterectomy. Endometritis can result from Caesarean section or surgical abortion. Urinary tract infections can occur as a result of any procedure that involves catheterization of the bladder. A 1999 guideline published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists the specific and stringent criteria that must be met for diagnosis of a surgical site infection. 7 Accurate surveillance for SSI monitoring requires followup for 30 days postoperatively, and the trend towards early discharge from hospital makes surveillance a challenge. It is estimated that up to 84% of surgical site infections occur following discharge from hospital. 7 If prophylactic antibiotics are to be given, they should be administered shortly prior to or at bacterial inoculation. 8, 9 The majority of studies suggest that a single dose is effective, but for lengthy procedures (> 3 hours) the dose should be repeated at intervals 1or 2 times the half-life of the drug. It has also been suggested that with large blood loss (> 1500 mL), a second dose should be given. 10",

A randomized trial compared maternal infectious and neonatal outcomes in women randomized to receive cefazolin 15 to 60 minutes before incision versus at cord clamp. Three hundred fifty-seven women were enrolled. Overall maternal infectious morbidity was reduced in the pre-treatment group (RR 0.4; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.87); in particular, endometritis was reduced (RR 0.2; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.94).",

Neonatal outcomes were not affected. 18 The most widely studied antibiotics for surgical prophylaxis are cephalosporins. Cefazolin is a first-generation cephalosporin and is a Pregnancy Category B drug. When given intravenously, its half-life is 1.8 hours. It provides good coverage for gram positive organisms and has modest gram negative coverage. In a 1999 guideline, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended its use at Caesarean section. 7 It is recommended that 1 to 2 grams should be administered intravenously not more than 30 minutes before the skin is cut. An additional dose can be considered if blood loss exceeds 1500 mL or at 4 hours if the procedure lasts more than 4 hours (i.e., up to 2 half-lives of the drug). 19 Trials have shown that broader spectrum antibiotics for Caesarean section do reduce infectious morbidity. Superiority trials with cefazolin have not been conducted. Given the potential for antibiotic resistance in both mother and neonate, recommendations for the use of broader spectrum antibiotics require further study. 20",

One study 28 investigated the use of continuous low-dose antibiotics in women with a history of second trimester pregnancy loss with the placement of cerclage at 14 to 24 weeks' gestation on the basis of transvaginal sonographic findings of cervical funnelling. Each of the 10 patients had a live birth, and pregnancy was prolonged by a mean of 13.4 \u00b1 4.2 weeks beyond the previous pregnancy. There was no control group. 28 In a second retrospective study of 116 mid-trimester cerclage placements, antibiotic use was not associated with a decreased risk of delivery before 28 weeks' gestation. 29 Randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm the role of antibiotics in these high-risk pregnancies.",

For patients with the conditions listed in Table 2 who have an established gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract infection or for those who receive antibiotic therapy for another reason (e.g., to prevent wound infection), they suggest it may be reasonable that the choice of antibiotic also be active against enterococci (i.e., ampicillin, piperacillin, or vancomycin).",
