            "text": "Influenza viruses remain the most frequently identified causes of viral infection in the lung, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) remains a major cause of severe pneumonia in children worldwide and is an increasingly recognized cause of illness in adults and elderly patients. Other agents, such as rhinovirus (RV), have been increasingly detected mirroring advances in molecular and serologic diagnostic techniques and increased surveillance programs. Nonetheless, the diversity of viral agents that cause pulmonary disease is extremely broad and continues to expand (Table 13 .1). Several newly recognized viral pathogens have been identified in the past few decades that are among the most feared and lethal of all emerging infections, including those caused by hantaviruses, Nipah virus, pandemic influenza A (H1N1), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses. Conversely, certain viral infections, particularly those that occur in vulnerable patient cohorts, have diminished during this same interval. For example, the U.S. incidence of varicella pneumonia has declined more than 65% since universal childhood vaccination for varicella was implemented in 1995, and advances in the clinical management of transplant recipients have reduced the incidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia. This chapter captures and describes select viral diseases in which the pulmonary system is a main target of infection, although it is important to note that other viral agents have been detected in pulmonary tissue, such as chikungunya virus, West Nile virus, rabies virus, and Heartland virus, typically in the context of systemic disease.",

Most pediatric cases of adenovirus pneumonia occur between 6 months and 5 years of age and are caused by serotypes 3, 7, and 21, with serotypes 3 and 7 being particularly pathogenic adenoviruses with the ability to result in disseminated and often fatal disease in previously healthy children. The majority of infections in pediatric populations spontaneously resolve and often do not result in clinically apparent illness. In adults, pneumonia is generally associated with serotypes 3, 4, and 7. Periodic epidemics of adenovirus pneumonia in immunocompetent adults have been identified, such as with the reemergence of adenovirus subtypes 14 and 55 that have been associated with severe disease in military camps, hospitals, and schools in the United States, Europe, and Asia. In a manner similar to other pathogens, adenoviruses take advantage of impaired or destroyed immune systems to establish persistent and disseminated infections in immunocompromised hosts, a population that is susceptible to a broader range of different serotypes. Because some adenoviruses establish latency in lymphoid tissues and the kidneys of their host, it is believed that many, possibly most, cases of clinical disease caused by adenoviruses in immunocompromised patients are reactivated infections.",

Adenoviruses form intranuclear inclusions in respiratory epithelial cells of the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles; in the acinar cells of bronchial glands; and in alveolar pneumocytes and are generally most abundant at the viable edges of necrotic foci. On hematoxylin-eosin stain, early inclusions appear as small, dense, amphophilic structures surrounded by a cleared zone and peripherally marginated chromatin, similar to herpetic inclusions. As the cellular infection progresses, the inclusion becomes larger (as large as 14 microns in some cells) and more basophilic, and the margins of the nuclear membrane become blurred to form the characteristic \"smudge cell\" (Fig. 13 .1C and D).

Most adenoviruses can be isolated in cell culture from bronchial washings, tracheal aspirates, or lung biopsy specimens during the early stage of the illness.

PCR detects viral RNA in blood and tissues and is extremely useful for diagnostic and epidemiologic purposes. Hantaviral RNA can also be detected in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival tissues by reverse transcription (RT) PCR. IHC testing of formalin-fixed tissues is a sensitive method to confirm hantaviral infections, and viral antigens are found primarily within capillary endothelium throughout various tissues in both HPS and HFRS ( Fig.  13 .2C). In HPS, marked accumulations of hantaviral antigens are found in the pulmonary microvasculature and in splenic and lymph nodal follicular dendritic cells. Electron microscopic studies of HPS lung tissue demonstrate infection of endothelial cells and macrophages. The virus or viruslike particles observed are infrequent and extremely difficult to identify in autopsy tissues; in contrast, typical endothelial granulofilamentous inclusions are seen more frequently (Fig. 13.2D ).",

Though similar biochemical alterations occur, those patients with the lowest thrombocytopenia (median 33,500 cells/mL), as well as increased hematocrits, creatinine levels, and leukocyte counts, occurred more often in fatal HPS cases. The need for supplementary oxygen and intubation has also been associated with a poor outcome. Management of patients with HPS or HFRS is often complex and phase specific. Supportive therapy, such as dialysis and circulatory and respiratory support, is the basis of treatment. MERS was first detected in Saudi Arabia in 2012 with most cases reported in the Arabian Peninsula, and numerous travel-associated cases and health care-associated outbreaks reported, the largest being in the Republic of Korea in 2015. The animal reservoir of SARS and MERS is uncertain, though bats have been suspected to play a role. It appears likely that civet cats and other small mammals play a role as amplifier hosts within animal markets for transmission of SARS, and there is very strong evidence linking dromedary camels and camel-related products to transmission of MERS to humans.",

The cytomegalic changes of CMVinfected cells are evident on standard hematoxylin-eosin staining and are virtually pathognomonic of active CMV infection. The cells are enlarged (25-40 microns) and contain amphophilic to deeply basophilic intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusions ( Fig. 13 .5A). The single intranuclear inclusion is composed of viral nucleoprotein and assembled capsids, and is a large (up to 20 microns), round-to-ovoid body with a smoothly contoured border that is generally surrounded by a clear halo that gives the inclusion a distinctive \"owl's eye\" appearance. anCillary studies CMV pneumonia is defined by the presence of signs or symptoms of pulmonary disease combined with the detection of CMV in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid or lung tissue samples. Detection methods that support this definition include virus isolation, histopathologic observation of cytomegalic cells, ISH, or IHC stains ( Fig. 13 .5B).

VZV also establishes latent infection within satellite cells and neurons of the trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia and can reactivate under various conditions to cause herpes zoster, a painful unilateral vesicular eruption distributed in a dermatomal distribution. Although chickenpox is usually a relatively benign infection in children, adult patients are approximately 25 times more likely than children to develop pneumonia. Pneumonia occurs in approximately 10% to 15% of adults primarily infected with VZV; however, the incidence of pneumonia in bone marrow transplant recipients and acute leukemia patients may be as high as 30% to 45%. The greatest risk of severe disease and pneumonia occurs in those patients with chronic lung disease, immune-suppressing conditions, neonates, and pregnant women. The occurrence of pneumonia during herpes zoster is rare and limited primarily to profoundly immunosuppressed patients, particularly bone marrow transplant recipients. VZV pneumonia develops 2 to 7 days after the onset of rash and is characterized by fever, cough, tachypnea, chest pain, and hemoptysis. Massive pulmonary hemorrhage and pulmonary infarcts are frequent terminal events. Hematopoietic cell transplant recipients may present with signs of visceral dissemination and pneumonia 1 to 4 days before the localized cutaneous eruption of herpes zoster appears, and lower respiratory tract disease has been described in the absence of skin lesions, particularly in neonates and bone marrow transplant recipients.",

Histopathologic features include various degrees of peribronchial and interstitial mononuclear cell infiltrates, squamous metaplasia of bronchial endothelium, proliferation of type II pneumocytes, and intraalveolar edema, with or without mononuclear cell exudates and hyaline membranes. Secondary changes created by bacterial or viral superinfection or organizational changes may alter the original pathology. The hallmark of the disease is the formation of multinucleated epithelial giant cells. These cells, which are often numerous, are formed by fusion of bronchiolar or alveolar lining cells (Fig. 13.11A ). These cells generally contain characteristic nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions. The intranuclear inclusions are homogenous, eosinophilic, and surrounded by a slight indistinct halo (Fig. 13.11B) . The cytoplasmic inclusions are deeply eosinophilic and may form large masses with a \"melted tallow\" appearance ( Fig.  13.11B ). These giant cells may undergo degenerative changes with progressive loss of cytoplasm, increasing basophilia, and shrinkage of nuclei. The presence of measles virus in these giant cells may be demonstrated by immunofluorescence, IHC, and ISH techniques (Fig. 13.11C ). These giant cells can also be seen in extrapulmonary tissues.",

Over 28,000 total suspected and confirmed cases were reported with over 11,000 deaths during the 2014 outbreak of Ebola in West Africa. Treatment depends on the particular agent and may include the use of passive antibodies, antiviral drugs such as ribavirin, or supportive therapy. Supportive therapy should include the reasonable measures that would be employed in any very ill patient with a fragile vascular bed. Volume replacement may be particularly important in some patients, especially with dengue hemorrhagic fever. Experimental vaccines and treatments for Ebola are under clinical trial.",

The causative agent, a member of the genus Morbillivirus, of the family Paramyxoviridae, is an enveloped virus that contains a negative-sense, singlestranded RNA genome. Measles has a worldwide distribution. Although still a significant problem in underdeveloped countries, measles infection became uncommon in the United States after the development and widespread use of an effective measles vaccine. However, a recrudescence of measles infection occurred in several large U.S. urban centers in recent years, associated with reduced use of the vaccine among children and young adults. This trend resulted in over 600 confirmed cases in 2014, a record number since 2000 when measles elimination was documented in the United States.",

EV-D68 and RVs are the most common viruses associated with respiratory disease though other viruses, such as echovirus 30, CVB, EV-A71, and several EV-C viruses, are increasingly reported. Infections can be asymptomatic, mild with both upper and lower respiratory tract disease, or severe and life threatening. An increase in EV-D68 cases has been reported since 2008, including an outbreak in 2014 affecting more than 1,000 individuals across the United States. It is not entirely clear whether this increase is due to improved molecular identification and/or an increasing incidence. In addition, association of virus with illness can be complicated by the high prevalence of EVs, particularly RVs, in asymptomatic individuals. Symptoms include dyspnea, pharyngitis, cough, bronchiolitis, sinusitis, asthma exacerbation, wheezing, and pneumonia. Fever is not seen in all cases. Preexisting respiratory illness may be a risk factor for severe disease, because in some reports a large number of the patients have underlying respiratory illness, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.",

Many infections are mild, though severe and possibly fatal lower respiratory tract infection has been reported in patients, particularly those with chronic or preexisting respiratory disease or hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.Hendra and Nipah viruses belong to the recently designated genus Henipavirus within the family Paramyxoviridae, subfamily Paramyxovirinae, and are nonsegmented, negative-stranded RNA viruses. These zoonotic pathogens were first identified in Australia and Malaysia and have been associated with acute febrile encephalitis and respiratory tract disease.Hendra was identified in 1994 when patients who came in close contact with sick horses developed an influenza-like illness with fever, myalgia, headache, lethargy, sore throat, nausea, and vomiting. Two patients died with pneumonitis and multiorgan failure. The closely related Nipah virus was identified during an outbreak in Malaysia and Singapore during 1998 to 1999 that included more than 250 patients. The incubation period ranged from 2 days to 1 month, but in most cases lasted between 1 and 2 weeks. Patients presented with a severe acute encephalitic syndrome, but some also had significant pulmonary manifestations. InBangladesh in 2001 and 2003, outbreaks of Nipah encephalitis occurred.

However, the term viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) is usually reserved for systemic infections characterized by fever and hemorrhage caused by a special group of viruses transmitted to humans by arthropods and rodents. VHFs are febrile illnesses characterized by abnormal vascular regulation and vascular damage and are caused by small, lipid-enveloped RNA viruses. This syndrome can be caused by RNA viruses belonging to four different families that differ in their genomic structure, replication strategy, and morphologic features (Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Flaviviridae, and Filoviridae). Arenaviruses, bunyaviruses, and filoviruses are negative-stranded, whereas flaviviruses are positive-stranded RNA viruses.
