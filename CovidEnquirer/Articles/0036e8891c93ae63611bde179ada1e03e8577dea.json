            "text": "Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) infection can result in a severe hemorrhagic syndrome for which there are no antiviral interventions available to date. Certain RNA viruses, such as CCHFV, encode cysteine proteases of the ovarian tumor (OTU) family that antagonize interferon (IFN) production by deconjugating ubiquitin (Ub). The OTU of CCHFV, a negative-strand RNA virus, is dispensable for replication of the viral genome, despite being part of the large viral RNA polymerase. Here, we show that mutations that prevent binding of the OTU to cellular ubiquitin are required for the generation of recombinant CCHFV containing a mutated catalytic cysteine. Similarly, the high-affinity binding of a synthetic ubiquitin variant (UbV-CC4) to CCHFV OTU strongly inhibits viral growth. UbV-CC4 inhibits CCHFV infection even in the absence of intact IFN signaling, suggesting that its antiviral activity is not due to blocking the OTU's immunosuppressive function. Instead, the prolonged occupancy of the OTU with UbV-CC4 directly targets viral replication by interfering with CCHFV RNA synthesis. Together, our data provide mechanistic details supporting the development of antivirals targeting viral OTUs. IMPORTANCE Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus is an important human pathogen with a wide global distribution for which no therapeutic interventions are available. CCHFV encodes a cysteine protease belonging to the ovarian tumor (OTU) family which is involved in host immune suppression. Here we demonstrate that artificially prolonged binding of the OTU to a substrate inhibits virus infection. This provides novel insights into CCHFV OTU function during the viral replicative cycle and highlights the OTU as a potential antiviral target.",

These nosocomial outbreaks are aided by the fact that CCHF initially manifests as a nonspecific febrile illness, thereby increasing its potential to initiate chains of human transmission. Although ribavirin has been used to treat CCHF, its efficacy and utility in clinical settings remain under debate, and no licensed vaccines or alternative therapeutic options are available to prevent disease or treat patients. Therefore, novel antiviral strategies are required to combat outbreaks.",

            "text": "Protein ubiquitination is required for the expression of type I interferon (IFN), which upregulates hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes critical for rapidly restricting viral replication. Cellular deubiquitinases (DUBs) can dampen IFN responses by removing Ub from key proteins regulating immunity, including RIG-I, MAVS, TRAF3, TBK1, and IRF3 (10) . Unsurprisingly, various virus families encode DUB domains. Viral DUBs belonging to the OTU superfamily have been reported for both positive-strand (Tymoviridae and Arteriviridae) and negative-strand (Nairoviridae and Tenuivirus) RNA viruses (7, 9, (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) . Viral DUBs are thought to facilitate viral replication by modulating innate immune responses as well as by reducing Ub-mediated degradation of viral proteins by the proteasome. For example, viral DUB activity of CCHFV OTU and equine arteritis virus OTU suppresses type I IFN signaling during infection (7) (8) (9) , whereas the turnip yellow mosaic virus DUB counters Ub-mediated proteasomal degradation of its polymerase (17) . Study of the role of DUBs encoded by positive-strand RNA viruses is hindered by the fact that this protease is involved in viral polyprotein processing required for RdRp maturation, and therefore catalytically inactive mutants cannot be generated. In contrast, negative-strand RNA viruses such as CCHFV do not require DUB activity for their RdRp to function (18) . Thus, the ability of CCHFV to remove Ub conjugates is not an absolute requirement for viral growth, although disruption was shown previously to result in enhanced cellular antiviral responses (8) .",

Both Ub and ISG15 are conjugated to lysine (K) residues via a three-step enzymatic cascade, comprising a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitinconjugating enzyme (E2), and a ubiquitin ligase (E3). Ub is constitutively expressed, whereas expression of ISG15 and its conjugating enzymes requires IFN stimulation. Ub conjugation is mediated by hundreds of E3 ligases, whereas ISG15 conjugation relies mainly on one E3 ligase (HERC5) (19, 20) . ISGylation appears to be largely restricted to newly synthesized proteins due to HERC5 ribosomal association, thus making ISGs and viral proteins central targets (19) (20) (21) . ISGylation can exert antiviral activity by prolonging antiviral signaling (IRF3, STAT) (22, 23) or by interfering with the function of viral proteins. For example, ISGylation can interfere with oligomerization of viral proteins, which is important for the formation of viral particles and ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes (19, 24) . Therefore, viral DUBs such as CCHFV OTU are expected to counter innate immune responses by removing Ub and ISG15 conjugates from their target proteins. This makes viral DUBs attractive potential therapeutic targets, as disrupting their activity is expected to enhance immune responses upon infection and hinder viral growth.",

Notably, rescue of a catalytic inactive CCHFV required an additional mutation to alleviate the interactions of the OTU with cellular Ub (C40A/Q16R). This revealed that inactivation or inhibition of the OTU domain of CCHFV can block viral replication. Likewise, an engineered ubiquitin variant (UbV) specific for CCHFV OTU (UbV-CC4) also strongly inhibited CCHFV growth by hindering viral transcription and/or replication. Despite the reported immune suppression function of the OTU, this inhibition was largely independent of OTU-mediated IFN suppression. Therefore, prolonged binding of the OTU to Ub or a CCHFV OTUspecific inhibitor (CC4) blocked viral infection. These data support considering CCHFV OTU to be a prime target for future development of antiviral strategies, as such binding negates the immunosuppression mediated by the OTU and directly inhibits viral transcription and/or replication.",

Viral DUBs are thought to facilitate viral infection by manipulating host immune responses, but their exact mode of action remains elusive. We previously reported efficient recovery of DUB-deficient CCHFV when Q16 and A129, critical residues involved in Ub binding, were mutated (8) . In contrast, previous attempts to rescue virus containing a mutated OTU catalytically active site (C40A) failed. Unexpectedly, a later attempt to generate a recombinant virus with the OTU-C40A mutation was successful. Sequencing the complete viral genome confirmed the conservation of the C40A mutation and revealed the acquisition of a nonconservative change at position 16 of the OTU (Q16P), indicating that Q16P may serve as an adaptive mutation allowing rescue of CCHFV encoding an inactive OTU. Strikingly, Q16 is a critical residue required for Ub binding (8, 25) , suggesting that Ub binding to the inactive OTU prevents CCHFV rescue. To examine if disruption of Ub binding is critical for the rescue of the CCHFV-C40A mutant, we added the Q16R mutation to disrupt Ub binding to the OTU of the L-C40A mutant. Indeed, combining the C40A and Q16R mutations resulted in efficient recovery of recombinant CCHFV (Fig. 1a) . Sequence analysis of a subsequent passage confirmed the presence of the C40A/Q16R mutations without any additional changes in the viral genome.",

Although a minor reduction in ZsG fluorescence was observed for CCHFV-C40A/Q16R, both the Q16R and C40A/Q16R OTU mutants grew efficiently in BSR-T7/5 cells, which are unable to mount an IFN response during infection (27) . In contrast, growth of CCHFV-C40A/Q16R was severely impaired in A549 cells, which do mount a robust immune response during CCHFV infection (8) . To confirm that the reduced growth kinetics of both mutant viruses in A549 cells was due to cellular immune responses, we assessed the growth kinetics of these viruses in A549 cells lacking RIG-I (RIG-I KO [knockout]) (Fig. 1d) and found that both CCHFV-Q16R and CCHFV-C40A/Q16R displayed enhanced growth kinetics in the absence of RIG-I signaling. This suggests that OTU activity is not an absolute requirement for CCHFV infection and specifically supports viral growth in IFN-competent cells.",

Assessing the role of the OTU in CCHFV pathogenesis in vivo is limited by the fact that only type I IFN-deficient small-animal models (IFNAR \u03ea/\u03ea and STAT1 \u03ea/\u03ea mice) are available. While the use of immunocompromised mice presents limitations in addressing the immune suppression function of the OTU, this model can nonetheless provide insights into the effects of altered OTU activity on CCHFV disease progression. To examine the effect of OTU mutations on disease, we infected IFNAR \u03ea/\u03ea mice subcutaneously (1 \u03eb 10 2 50% tissue culture infective doses [TCID 50 ]) and monitored weight and health daily (Fig. 2 ). All mice started losing weight 3 days after infection. Infection performed with CCHFV-Q16R, in which only Ub binding was disrupted, resulted in illness identical to that caused by wild-type CCHFV (CCHFV-wt); mice succumbed to disease at 4 to 5 days postinfection (dpi), and no clinical differences between these two groups were observed ( Fig. 2a and b ). Mice infected with CCHFV-C40A/Q16R lost weight at a slightly lower rate and had a prolonged time to death (6 to 7 dpi); 2 of the 8 animals survived infection. Analysis of viral RNA in various tissues at the time of death or euthanasia demonstrated similar viral loads between all the groups, with the exception of the 2 survivors, in which CCHFV RNA levels were markedly lower (Fig. 2c) . Together, these data demonstrate that OTU catalytic activity is not required for pathogenesis in mice in the absence of type I IFN signaling, although mutating the catalytic site resulted in mild attenuation in vivo in comparison to active OTUs (wt and Q16R).",

However, our data suggest that inactivating the catalytic site of CCHFV OTU also interferes with viral transcription and/or replication, due to its interaction with cellular Ub (Fig. 1) . As a result of its inability to cleave substrates, OTU-C40A may display prolonged binding to ubiquitinated substrates, potentially affecting L protein stability or function and ultimately preventing viral growth.

Using UbV-CC4, we set out to investigate the potential antiviral effect of blocking CCHFV OTU activity. As a control, a wild-type-like Ub variant was used in which only the C-terminal di-Gly motif was mutated to alanine (UbV-AA).

HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing V5-OTU and hemagglutinin-tagged ubiquitin (HA-Ub) or with plasmids expressing V5-OTU and FLAG-UbV-CC4 and were subsequently labeled with a donor or acceptor fluorophore. A plasmid expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used as a control. Close proximity of proteins, such as protein-protein interactions, results in increased intensity of the fluorescent signal. Coexpression of UbV-CC4 with either OTU-wt or OTU-C40A resulted in an increased TR-FRET signal, whereas coexpression of either OTU with GFP did not (Fig. 3b) . In contrast, only coexpression of HA-Ub with OTU-C40A resulted in an increased TR-FRET signal, whereas coexpression with OTU-wt did not. This supports the concept that cellular Ub (HA-Ub) binds only to OTU-C40A whereas the synthetic UbV-CC4 also interacts with OTU-wt. We reaffirmed the interaction of UbV-CC4 with OTU-wt using coimmunoprecipitation. Cells were transfected with plasmids encoding HA-OTU-wt and FLAG-UbV-CC4 or the FLAG-UbV-AA control. Pulldown of HA-OTU-wt resulted in detection of FLAG-UbV-CC4 but not FLAG-UbV-AA (Fig. 3c) . We then examined the effects of UbV-CC4 on CCHFV OTU deubiquitinase and deISGylase activity. To visualize cellular ubiquitinated and ISGylated proteins, cells were transfected with plasmids expressing HA-Ub (DUB assay) or V5-ISG15 in combination with the enzymes required for conjugation (Ube1L, UbcH8, and HERC5; deISGylation assay). Analysis of the cellular levels of ISG15 or Ub demonstrates that UbV-CC4 efficiently blocked the OTU-mediated removal of Ub and ISG15 from their protein targets, whereas UbV-AA had no effect on OTU activity (Fig. 3d) . Additionally, blocking OTU DUB activity with UbV-CC4 enhanced ubiquitination of the L protein (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material).",

UbV-CC4 inhibited the in vitro OTU activity of all tested CCHFV strains (IbAr10200, AP92, Hoti, and Oman) with similar levels of efficiency, with IC 50 values ranging from 12 to 23 nM ( Fig. 3f ; see also Table S1 in the supplemental material).

Strikingly, UbV-CC4 robustly reduced ZsG levels at all tested time points, whereas the UbV-AA control did not affect ZsG fluorescence (Fig. 4c ). In addition, CCHFV-infected A549-CC4 cells produced very low to undetectable levels of viral progeny, whereas A549-AA cells produced titers similar to those measured for the control cells (unmodified A549 cells; Fig. 4a and b). Infectious titers of CCHFV lacking the ZsG reporter (CCHFV-wt) closely matched the curves determined on the basis of ZsG fluorescence, further supporting quantification of CCHFV-derived ZsG fluorescence to accurately estimate viral growth (Fig. 4a to c) . Finally, to ensure that the UbV-CC4-mediated inhibition of CCHFV growth was specific and was not caused by broad antiviral effects of UbV-CC4, we used a Lassa reporter virus (LASV) expressing ZsG (LASV-ZsG) as a control (Fig. 4d) .

            "text": "UbV-CC4 inhibits CCHFV replication independently of innate immune responses. Since CCHFV does not require OTU activity for autoproteolytic processing of its viral proteins or for polymerase activity (18), we expected that UbV-CC4 would reduce CCHFV infection by interfering with OTU-mediated immune suppression, which would result in enhanced cellular immune responses. A549 cells display robust IFN responses upon CCHFV infection, and previous studies have demonstrated that RIG-I signaling plays a pivotal role in the antiviral cellular response against CCHFV infection (8, 29) . To investigate if UbV-CC4-mediated inhibition of CCHFV infection depends on enhanced cellular immune responses, we assessed UbV-CC4 antiviral activity in an A549 RIG-I knockout cell line (RIG-I KO). Using the A549 RIG-I KO cells as a basis, we generated additional cell lines stably expressing UbV-AA or UbV-CC4. Interestingly, robust inhibition of CCHFV was noted even in the absence of RIG-I-mediated antiviral responses (Fig. 4e) . This confirms that UbV-CC4 can inhibit CCHFV infection independently of RIG-I. OTU residues required for Ub binding are critical for UbV-CC4 antiviral activity. Our data support a model in which binding of cellular Ub to the inactive OTU (C40A) blocks the recovery of infectious CCHFV and binding of UbV-CC4 to OTU-wt mimics this inhibition (Fig. 1, 3, and 4a to c) . Specific OTU mutations have been described that selectively disrupt OTU interaction with Ub (Q16R) or with ISG15 (P77D) or both (A129R) (8, 25, 30, 31) . Since UbV-CC4 interacts with the OTU in a manner similar to that seen with cellular Ub, we expected that the Q16R and A129R mutations would prevent UbV-CC4 binding to the OTU and therefore would relieve UbV-CC4 inhibition of CCHFV infection. Recombinant viruses containing these OTU mutations were generated and used to infect cells expressing UbV-CC4. As predicted, mutant viruses CCHFV-Q16R and CCHFV-A129R, which are deficient in Ub binding, were not inhibited by UbV-CC4, whereas CCHFV-P77D, which retains significant Ub binding, was inhibited similarly to the wt virus ( Fig. 4c and f to h) . We confirmed the specific binding of UbV-CC4 to the mutant OTUs by performing coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 4i) . Thus, binding of UbV-CC4 to the OTU domain is required for inhibition of CCHFV infection.",

The VLP assay allows us to address early steps in the replication cycle, such as entry, uncoating, and primary transcription of the encapsidated minigenome. Interestingly, when VLPs were added to UbV-CC4-expressing cells, only a mild reduction in VLP reporter activity compared to the UbV-AA control was detected (Fig. 5a) . In order to confirm the VLP results with genuine virus, we used a CCHFV reporter expressing NanoLuciferase (CCHFV-Nluc; Fig. 5b ).

However, CCHFV likely replicates its genomic material in a way similar to that of related bunyaviruses. This process entails NP binding to genomic RNA to form ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes, which in turn interact with the L protein, resulting in transcription or replication. Regions required for the L-NP interaction have been identified on both the N and C termini of the CCHFV L protein (32) . We investigated the possibility that UbV-CC4 interferes with CCHFV transcription and/or replication by disrupting the formation of RNP complexes by assessing the interaction between L and NP in the presence of UbV-CC4. Cells were transfected with plasmids expressing CCHFV V5-L, NP, and FLAG-UbV-AA or FLAG-UbV-CC4. Lysates were immunoprecipitated using V5 and were analyzed by Western blotting. This assay demonstrated that less NP is associated with V5-L in the presence of UbV-CC4 (Fig. 5e ), supporting a model where UbV-CC4 interferes with the formation of CCHFV replication complexes.",

            "text": "Various highly pathogenic RNA viruses, including CCHFV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), encode DUB domains that contain deubiquitinase and deISGylase activity (7, 8, 14, 33) . These viral DUBs likely contribute to viral pathogenesis by suppressing innate immune responses. In addition, DUBs of positive-strand RNA viruses are essential for the viral polyprotein processing required for polymerase maturation. Despite being part of the RNA polymerase, DUBs encoded by negative-strand RNA viruses of the family Nairoviridae (termed OTUs) are dispensable for polymerase activity (18) . Instead, suppression of host immune responses appears to be the main function of nairovirus OTUs. Here, by mutating the OTU and employing a synthetic Ub variant (UbV-CC4), we characterized the effects of disrupting OTU activity on CCHFV infection. Unexpectedly, we discovered that solely mutating the OTU catalytic site (C40A) abolishes viral propagation, as the prolonged binding to its substrate Ub interferes with transcription and/or genome amplification. Similarly, a noncleavable synthetic Ub variant (UbV-CC4) inhibits propagation of wild-type CCHFV (Fig. 6 ). CCHFV propagation in the absence of OTU catalytic activity (C40A) was restored by inclusion of an additional mutation that prevents Ub binding (Q16R), suggesting that binding of the inactive OTU to cellular Ub inhibits viral growth. Importantly, this does not appear to be mediated by a simple difference in affinity levels between OTU-wt and OTU-C40A, as isothermal titration calorimetry results showed no change in the favorability of binding mono-Ub between OTU-wt and OTU-C40A (see Table S2 in the supplemental material). However, cellular Ub is often found as polymeric chains, and CCHFV OTU has been demonstrated to cleave these Ub chains (34) . Although structural studies have only revealed interactions between the CCHFV OTU and a single Ub within a well-characterized binding site, there is biochemical evidence suggesting the presence of a secondary binding site in nairovirus OTUs that facilitates interactions with Ub chains (35) . When OTU-wt cleaves the Ub chains, it converts a single high-affinity interaction into two lower-affinity ones that facilitate substrate release. On the other hand, OTU-C40A is unable to cleave Ub chains, resulting in a prolonged association with Ub and subsequent blocking of virus replication. Similarly, UbV-CC4 blocks viral transcription and/or replication by prolonged association with OTU-wt due to the absence of the consensus cleavage motif combined with the presence of extra interacting residues increasing binding affinity. In conclusion, prolonged Ub-OTU association, due to the absence of either OTU catalytic activity (C40A) or the Ub consensus cleavage motif in UbV-CC4, appears sufficient to inhibit CCHFV transcription and/or replication.",

            "text": "We previously demonstrated that an intact OTU domain is not required for CCHFV RdRp activity (8, 18) , and the generation of recombinant CCHFV containing a catalytic inactive OTU further confirms that OTU protease activity should be considered accessory to virus replication. In fact, CCHFV-C40A/Q16R was easily propagated in IFNdeficient cells and was pathogenic to IFNAR \u03ea/\u03ea mice. However, weight loss and mortality were slightly delayed compared to mice infected with CCHFV-wt, and two animals survived CCHFV-C40A/Q16R infection (Fig. 2) . Antiviral responses independent of type I IFN, including the upregulating of certain ISGs, have been described in immunocompromised animals and may be responsible for this observed in vivo attenuation (36, 37) . Unexpectedly, we found that occupying the OTU with UbV-CC4 resulted in strong inhibition of CCHFV transcription and/or replication. This was a notable finding, as CCHFV does not require autoproteolytic processing of its viral RNA polymerase, and inhibition of its DUB was therefore expected to interfere only with its ability to suppress host immunity. Mechanistically, inhibition of CCHFV by UbV-CC4 was characterized by a strong reduction of CCHFV minigenome reporter activity (Fig. 5c and d) , whereas early infection events were minimally affected ( Fig. 5a and b) . Our data support a model in which prolonged binding of the OTU to Ub(V) interferes with the formation of new RNP complexes, thus affecting viral transcription and/or genome amplification. Formation of CCHFV RNP complexes involves interactions of viral RNA, NP, and the L protein. In the presence of UbV-CC4, less NP was associated with L protein in transfected cells, suggesting a possible defect in RNP complex formation (Fig. 5e) . NP binding occurs at two distinct sites located at the N and C termini of L (32), which might be differently affected by binding of the OTU to Ub/UbV-CC4, possibly explaining the residual interaction between NP and L detected in the presence of UbV-CC4. The CCHFV L protein harboring the RNA polymerase and OTU is an unusually large protein (\u03f3450 kDa), and the tridimensional arrangement of the OTU domain relative to the RNA polymerase is unknown. Therefore, the consequences of prolonged OTU binding to Ub/UbV-CC4 with respect to polymerase conformation and activity are presently unpredictable. It is conceivable that Ub/UbV-CC4 binding to the OTU domain might simply lock the polymerase in an inactive state, preventing RNA synthesis. Structural data combined with in vitro assays will be necessary to further elucidate the precise mechanism of OTU-UbV-CC4 complex interference in transcription and replication.",

UbV-CC4 inhibits in vitro OTU activity of genetically diverse CCHFV strains but has little to no effect on the OTU activity of other nairovirus species ( Fig. 3f and g) . The nairoviral OTU domain displays a high degree of sequence diversity, potentially affecting the binding affinity of UbV-CC4. For example, UbV-CC4's Tyr 68 improves hydrophobic packing with OTU residues Thr 10 , Val 12 , and Val 18 (28) . Thr 10 is conserved across the four tested CCHFV OTUs, whereas the other tested nairovirus species predominantly encode a glutamic acid at that position.

To assess the various CCHFV mutant viruses, animals (6.5 weeks of age, 8 mice per group) were inoculated subcutaneously in the interscapular region with 10 2 TCID 50 of CCHFV diluted in DMEM. Mice were humanely euthanized at the indicated time points or when clinical illness scores based on piloerection, decreased activity, neurological signs (e.g., ataxia, paresis/paralysis), dehydration, dyspnea, and/or weight loss (\u03fe20% from baseline at \u03ea1 dpi) indicated that the animal was in distress or in the terminal stages of disease. Differences in weight change from baseline according to day postinfection and survival were statistically analyzed by multiple t tests, with significance determined using the Holm-Sidak method (\u2423 \u03ed 0.05) and the log rank (Mantel-Cox) test, respectively (GraphPad Prism 8).",

(d) LASV-ZsG (MOI of 0.1) was used as a control. ZsG reporter activity was quantified at the indicated time points as a measure of viral replication. Data are presented as means \u03ee SD of results from three replicates. (e)To determine whether RIG-I signaling is involved in the CC4-mediated suppression of CCHFV replication, A549 RIG-I KO cells stably expressing UbV-AA or UbV-CC4 were infected with CCHFV-ZsG (MOI of 0.1) and ZsG reporter activity was quantified at the indicated time points. Data are presented as means \u03ee SD of results from three replicates. (f to h) To confirm that direct binding of the UbV-CC4 to the CCHFV OTU is responsible for the inhibition of CCHFV replication, we employed recombinant viruses containing OTU mutations that disrupt binding to Ub (Q16R) or to ISG15 (P77D) or to both Ub and ISG15 (A129R). A549 cells stably expressing UbV were infected with these CCHFV OTU mutants (MOI of 0.1), and ZsG fluorescence was determined as a measure of viral replication at the indicated time points. Data are presented as means \u03ee SD of results from three replicates. (i) To confirm the interaction of the OTU (mutants) with UbV-CC4, we performed coimmunoprecipitation assays. HEK293T cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids, and cell lysates were harvested after 2 days.",

VLPs were generated by transfecting Huh7 cells with plasmids encoding CCHFV NP, GPC, codon-optimized L, T7 polymerase, and a NanoLuc (Nluc)-encoding minigenome. VLP-containing supernatants were harvested after 3 days and transferred to A549 cells stably expressing UbV-AA or UbV-CC4. NanoLuc activity was quantified the next day as a measure of VLP activity. Data are presented as means \u03ee SD of results from four replicates. RLU, relative light units. (b) To analyze if UbV-CC4 affects early replication steps after entry, we used a NanoLuc-expressing reporter virus (CCHFV-Nluc). A549 cells stably expressing UbV were infected (MOI of 5), and NanoLuc activity was determined at the indicated time points. Data are presented as means \u03ee SD of results from three replicates. (c) A minigenome assay was used to determine if UbV-CC4 directly affects CCHFV genome amplification. Huh7 cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding CCHFV NP, codon-optimized L, T7 polymerase, and a NanoLuc-encoding minigenome. After 2 days, NanoLuc activity was quantified as a measure of CCHFV RdRp activity. Constitutively active Renilla luciferase was used as a transfection control. Data are presented as means \u03ee SD of results from three replicates. (d) To analyze CCHFV minigenome RNA levels, RNA was isolated from Huh7 cells transfected with the minigenome components described for panel c. Minigenome RNA levels were quantified using qRT-PCR. Data are presented as means \u03ee SD of results from six replicates. (e) To investigate if UbV-CC4 binding to the OTU interferes with L-NP interaction, HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing CCHFV NP, codon-optimized V5-L, and UbV-AA or UbV-CC4. L-NP interaction was assessed by coimmunoprecipitating V5-L and determining the associated NP levels.",

(Panel III) Adding an additional mutation that prevents binding to Ub (Q16R) to catalytically inactive OTU (C40A) disrupts the formation of Ub-OTU complexes and restores viral replication.
