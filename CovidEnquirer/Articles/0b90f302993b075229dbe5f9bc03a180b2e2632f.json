Strong Research Foundation, La Jolla; or The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine. 4-wk-old mice were inoculated intracerebrally with 0.05 ml of virus. To quantitate the amounts of infectious virus in various tissues, mice were exsanguinated and their tissues removed aseptically, then stored at -70\u00b0C until assayed. A 10% homogenate of various tissues, clarified by centrifugation at 700 g, was serially diluted 10-fold, and the amounts of infectious virus were quantitated by plaque assay on susceptible cells. Cultured Cells. To obtain primary cultures of neurons, spinal cords were removed from 11-12-d-old embryos and dissected free of meningeal coverings, dissociated through steel or nylon mesh with 60-100 openings/in and plated on 0.01% poly(n-lysine)-coated 35-mm dishes at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 106 cells/dish. Media consisted of 10% fetal bovine serum in Eagle's minimal essential media that contained 1% glutamine and 0.5% additional glucose. The purity of various neuronal and glial cells in the cultures was assayed by detecting plasma membrane receptors for tetanus toxin, surface galaetocerebroside, and cytoplasmic accumulation of glial fibrillary acid protein (12, 14, 16) . Neuronal cells have tetanus-toxin receptors but lack the glial markers of galactocerebroside and glial fibrillary acid protein (12) . Macrophages were obtained from peritoneal cavities of mice inoculated intraperitoneally with 2 ml of 3.8% thioglycollate broth. Peritoneal exudate cells harvested 5 d later were plated, and nonadherent cells removed i-2 h later after vigorous shaking. Details concerning stimulating, obtaining, and culturing these cells are published elsewhere (17, 18) . Adherent cells were macrophages, as judged by their ability to phagocytize zymosan particles, or sheep erythrocytes previously reacted with antibody a~d C5-defieient mouse sera, and by their morphology (19) . Homogeneity was usually >95% with a range of 85-98%.",

To evaluate replication of MHV in vivo SJL/J and BALB/c mice were inoculated intracerebrally with 100 BALB/c LDso of virus, and after killing at various intervals, their tissues were assayed for amounts of infectious virus. Virus replicated to some degree in SJL/J brains, but the titers were 100-to 1,000-fold lower than in BALB/c mice tested within the first 2 d after inoculation (Table III) . Thereafter, the majority of BALB/c mice died, but surviving SJL/J mice consistently had lower titers of virus than BALB/c mice killed during the peak of infection. Virus replicated to higher titers, 1 to 3 logs more, in CNS tissues (brain and spinal cord) than in livers, spleens, or thymuses. Again, virus titers were significantly higher in all tissues from BALB/c mice when compared with those from SJL/J mice. Virus replication in inoculated BALB/WEHI mice were equivalent to that seen in BALB/c mice. The use of a specific fixative and unembedded sections thinly sliced with a vibratome enabled us to preserve sufficient viral antigen and morphologic structure to assess the CNS cell type involved and the sites of antigen localization (Fig. 1) . The study of spinal cord and brain tissue from BALB/c mice showed evidence of MHV-4 antigen expression both in neurons (Fig. 1) and in glial cells. To the contrary, it was uncommon to find MHV-4 antigens in neuronal cells of SJL/J mice. However, when the viral dose was increased 100-fold, occasional neuronal cells from SJL/J mice contained M H V antigens.",

Table V shows that neurons from (SJL/J x BALB/ WEHI)Ft or (BALB/WEHI X SJL/J)Fl replicated as much or more virus than neurons from susceptible BALB/WEHI parents. These results obtained in vitro complemented those obtained in vivo (Table II) culture fluids (Table VI) , although the majority of cells expressed viral antigens. However, infectious virus was detected in a subsequent amplification assay when susceptible L cells were layered over SJL/J macrophages (Fig. 3) . The occurrence of infected foci in the L cells layered over infected SJL/J macrophages was uncommon. 1-3 giant cell foei occurred per 35-mm dish as compared to >100 loci when infected BALB/WEHI maerophages were similarly assayed. Viral antigens detected in SJL/J macrophages were grouped in clusters in the cytoplasm as compared with a more diffuse and granular MHV antigen presentation in macrophages from BALB/WEHI mice. The presence of viral antigens in macrophages harvested from SJL mice again suggested that the block in replicating virus was likely not at the level of the receptor for the virus.",

O f the eleven inbred strains studied, only one, S j L / j , was resistant to the effects of MHV-4 after intracerebral inoculation. The complete susceptibility of BALB/c mice and of the Ft hybrids obtained from mating BALB/c \u00d7 SJL/J indicates that resistance of MHV-4 is recessive. Mortality data obtained both from F2 intercrosses and from FI backcrosses to each parent best fit a single recessive gene model (Table II) . It should be emphasized that these results were obtained with 4-wk-old mice, a time when neurons are mature. Complementary data was obtained from in vitro studies when neurons from B A L B / W E H I and the F1 hybrids obtained from mating B A L B / W E H I \u00d7 S J L / J mice produced 4 logs more infectious virus than similarly prepared neurons from SJL/J mice (Table V) . Several investigators have studied host factors affecting resistance to other strains of MHV. The pioneering work of Bang et al. (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) focused on the nature of susceptibility to MHV-2 in causing fatal hepatitis in PRI mice but not in C3H mice. These investigators showed that the ability of virus to replicate in vitro in macrophages correlated with production of fatal hepatitis and that resistance was inherited as a single autosomal recessive gene. Our studies complement and extend those of Bang by showing that MHV-4 resistance at the host level, like MHV-2, seem to be inherited as a single autosomal recessive gene. The apparent difference between MHV-2 and MHV-4 lies in the primary target tissue injured by viral replication--the former is liver cells and the latter, neurons. Interestingly, although replication of MHV-2 is restricted in macrophages from C3H mice (23, 26) , macrophages from C3H mice are susceptible to replication of MHV-3 (29) and MHV-4 in vitro (R. Knobler and M. B.",

Thus, our findings with MHV-4 resemble those with MHV-2 and MHV-3 in that resistance is controlled by a single recessive gene. Yet, in contrast with the resistance of A/J mice to MHV-3 (31), we noted that similarly aged A/J mice are susceptible to MHV-4 infection (Table I) . Our results with MHV-4 differ from a recent report (32) suggesting that acute encephalitis caused by this virus is controlled by two genes, one recessive and one dominant.

To do these studies, we utilized methods permitting critical assessment of various (Table III) , showing that virus could replicate there. When MHV-4 was used to infect cultured primary neuronal cells harvested from SJL/J mice, no infectious virus was detected in supernatant fluids. In contrast, cultured neuronal cells from several strains of susceptible mice made 4 to 7 logs of infectious virus. Hence, both in vivo and in vitro studies suggest that the majority of infectious virus found in brains of SJL/J mice after intracerebral inoculation of MHV-4 may reflect replication of virus in nonneuronal cells. This failure to replicate MHV in neurons is manifested as a low incidence of death after one exposes SJL/J mice to MHV-4. However, this restriction is not absolute, because larger doses of virus (an additional 2-3 logs) result in viral replication in their neurons in vivo and death. The stage of replication at which MHV is restricted in neurons is not clear. Studies with neurons and macrophages suggest that the block may take place in some cells after virus-receptor interaction and after some viral antigens are produced. Whether all the viral antigens are made satisfactorily in such cells, or the defect is in packaging and/or release is under investigation.",

In an encephalomyocarditis virus model of diabetes, virus replication differed notably only in cultures of pancreatic beta cells from resistant and susceptible strains (33) . Using cytomegalovirus, Nedrud et al. (34) found significant differences in the amount of virus replicated by resistant and susceptible mice, but only in tracheal ring cultures, not in fihroblast cultures. The ability to generate homogeneous cultures of primary neuronal cells and the expectation of obtaining similar cultures for oligodendrocytes, now offers the opportunity to dissect the molecular basis of host restriction for virus induced demyelinating and degenerative diseases of the CNS.
