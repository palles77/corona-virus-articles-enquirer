This regression of the CTG repeat length may be the main cause of the longevity of DM alleles in the population, as evidenced by the strength of the linkage disequilibrium seen between genetic markers which map very close to the CTG repeat and DM.1 The sex difference in the frequency at which contraction occurs may well be a major contributing factor to explain why the congenital form of DM is only inherited maternally. This difference, coupled with the decreased fertility of men bearing large amplifications, may explain this finding.",

Shelbourne P, Winqvist R, Kunert Bacterial identification of adult lower respiratory tract infection SIR,-Dr Macfarlane and colleagues (Feb 27, p 511) draw attention to community-acquired lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). We take issue with most of their conclusions, since their methodology is inadequate. Their finding that most identified cases were diagnosed as having a bacterial infection does not imply genuine cause and effect. Previous studies in wheezing illness have shown that bacterial identification rates are the same whether the subjects were wheezy or symptom-free,! with up to 24% of symptom-free cases being positive on bacterial cu1ture.2 In Macfarlane's study bacterial cultures were not obtained in healthy subjects nor in patients when they were symptom-free, and thus the significance of a positive culture is unclear. Viral shedding is greatest within 1 day of symptoms and since symptoms had been present for at least 7 days in 67% of the cases, it is hardly surprising that the virus isolation rate (not precisely specified in the paper) was so low. Even with better clinical sampling techniques than those used, the use of \"standard laboratory methods\" is not adequate to identify most respiratory viruses. Respiratory viruses are notoriously difficult to culture, especially coronavirus and rhinovirus, which need very specialised culture conditions.2 Nasal aspirate or washing offers greater sensitivity for respiratory viral culture.3 Likewise, serological testing is insensitive for respiratory viral diagnosis. It cannot identify rhinovirus, nor, without specialised techniques, coronavirus, and in Macfarlane's study parainfluenza was not sought. Together these viruses probably account for over threequarters of respiratory viral infections. 4 These deficiencies are underscored by a recent community-based longitudinal study in school children with persistent lower respiratory tract symptoms which used the polymerase chain reaction together with more traditional diagnostic methods. Respiratory virus infections were identified in 81% of wheezing episodes and in 83% of episodes with both upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms and a fall in peak flow-the identification rate in the same children when symptom-free was 12%. 4 We estimate that had this study used the same methodology as Macfarlane et al the identification rate would have been I % and the researchers would have erroneously concluded that viruses are unimportant in wheezing episodes in children.",

            "text": "Despite these shortcomings, the study has been successful in identifying the scale of LRTI in the UK, but has advanced us no nearer to identifying the causes. In particular, the place of antibiotic therapy should remain open to question since, despite treatment with antibiotics, 26% of patients in Macfarlane's study asked to see their general practitioners again because of unsatisfactory clinical progress. Although the polymerase chain reaction for virus identification was presumably not available when this study was planned, in any future investigations this technique must be used. Authors'reply SIR,-We accept that present methods for diagnosing the pathogen causing LRTI are not wholly satisfactory, but our conclusion that the range of causative pathogens identified in our patients with such infection is similar to that for communityacquired pneumonia remains valid since our previous studies and those of others have used similar diagnostic techniques. We clearly stated our criteria for diagnosis of infection, which were similar to those in previous studies, including those used in the British Thoracic Society study.1 Dr Doull and Dr Johnston's criticisms mainly relate to the diagnosis of viral infections. However, our study was of LRTI in general practice and not of wheezing illness in childhood and adult asthmatics referred to in their references. We agree that viral shedding is greatest at the start of symptoms, but we are uncertain how they suggest we could exploit this fact when studying a large unselected population who only seek help because of continuing symptoms. We are also uncertain how we could have had access to the elegant methods that Doull and Johnston describe in a twelve author, unpublished paper due to come out in a European Journal. THE LANCET Doull and Johnston question the relevance of a positive bacterial diagnosis, and indeed this is a difficulty, but they do not suggest a practical alternative. The reference they cite of bacterial infection in asthamtics2 failed to identify any cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae infections, with, surprisingly, Pseudomonas species being most common. In our study, bacterial culture of healthy subjects would not have been appropriate since previously well subjects would not have a productive cough. The criteria that we used for bacterial infection, the presence of recognised pathogens in 1W dilution of sputum show that bacteria cause infections more than previously supposed. In unpublished data,3 the detection of pneumococcal antigen in measurable titre in sputum equated well with other evidence of lower respiratory pneumococcal infection, supporting the idea that detection of bacterial antigen is a useful added method.",

We too look forward to the day when more sensitive and specific tests are avialable for investigating this very common clinical problem. SIR,-Community-acquired adult LRTI is common, as Dr Macfarlane and colleagues point out. Sputum and blood cultures have become routine for all patients with fever and chest radiographic changes compatible with pneumonia. 20-30% of blood cultures are claimed to be positive and blood cultures are regarded as essential in all patients suspected of pneumonia.1,2 We examined blood cultures from a total of 277 patients admitted with suspected pneumonia to evaluate their value as a diagnostic aid. The spectrum of pathogens proved similar to that recorded in the community by Macfarlane and colleagues. All patients had clinical signs of pneumonia&mdash;ie, fever, shortness of breath, and radiological changes on their chest radiograph. 130 patients had 20 mL and 147 had 40 mL venous blood drawn to investigate whether the amount of blood affected the sensitivity of the test. Patients underwent standard treatment and subsequently received penicillin 2 million IU intravenously thrice daily until their clinical condition allowed oral penicillin treatment: In the 130 patients with 20 mL samples (10 mL for aerobic and 10 mL for anaerobic culturing) Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated in 6 (2 patients were treated with penicillin before admission), Staphylococcus epidemddis in 2 (probably contamination), and Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae in 1 each. 45 patients (35%) were treated with antibiotics before admission and blood culture: only 2 patients, 1 with E coli (ampicillin) and 1 with Klebsiella pneumrneiae (penicillin) had their antibiotic treatment changed on the basis of the microbiological diagnosis. In the 147 patients with 40 mL blood samples (20 mL for aerobic and 20 mL for anaerobic culturing), Streptococcus pneumoniae (sensitive to penicillin) was isolated in 8 and Staphylococcus aureus in 1. This last patient had his antibiotic treatment changed on the basis of the microbiological diagnosis and lack of response to penicillin treatment. 50 patients (34%) received antibiotics before admission and blood culture.",

            "text": "High-dose aspirin, thrombin, and coronary angioplasty SIR,-During percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), maximum inhibition of platelet activation and thrombin generation is required.1 Recent data suggest that current antiplatelet and anticoagulant regimens fail to achieve this.2, 3 We have compared the effect of high doses of aspirin with that of conventional aspirin doses on thrombin formation after PTCA.Plasma concentrations of prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (Fl + 2), an index of thrombin generation, were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Enzygnost Fl + 2, Behring) 1 hour before and 90 minutes after the end of elective single-vessel PTCA in 24 patients. All patients received 10 000 IU heparin as an intravenous bolus at the start of PTCA, and aspirin 75 mg or 300 mg orally per day for at least 5 days before the procedure. 9 patients received an additional dose of 1000 mg aspirin as an intravenous infusion over the 90 minutes covering the procedure.In the higher-dose aspirin group (n = 9), mean (SE) Fl + 2 after PTCA was half that in the lower-dose group (n = 15): 0 20 (0-04) versus 0 42 (0-06) nmol/L ; Fl + 2 before PTCA was 1.26 (0-16) and 1 24 (022), respectively (high versus low dose after PTCA, p < 001, before versus after, p < 0 001 in both groups).Because thrombin is essential for platelet deposition at the site of angioplasty1 and can activate smooth-muscle cell growth4 and contraction,s maximum suppression of thrombin generation during PTCA may reduce the risk of acute thrombotic complications and the mitogenic and vasospastic stimulation associated with restenosis.6 The combination of heparin and high-dose aspirin in patients undergoing PTCA warrants further investigation. The regimen may also prove useful in the treatment of unstable coronary syndromes. ",
