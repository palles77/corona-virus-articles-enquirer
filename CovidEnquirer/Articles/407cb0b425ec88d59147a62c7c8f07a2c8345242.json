Subjects were matched on duration of illness and gender, and then randomly allocated to experimental and comparison groups. The experimental group participated in the CDSMP, while the comparison group joined a Tai-Chi interest class in a mass-activity format. Subjects completed evaluation questionnaires before beginning their program and 1 week following the program. Results: Analysis of covariance showed that the CDSMP participants demonstrated significantly higher self-efficacy in managing their illness, used more cognitive methods to manage pain and symptoms, and felt more energetic than the subjects in the comparison group. The CDSMP participants also demonstrated changes in their profile of coping strategies, having a tendency to adopt the cognitive methods of diverting attention, reinterpreting pain, ignoring sensations, and making positive self-statements. Conclusion: The short-term evaluation results showed that the CDSMP primarily increased the self-efficacy, exercise behavior, and application of cognitive coping strategies of the participants. Practice Implication: The effect of the CDSMP in a Chinese population is similar to that found in studies in Western cultures, and the CDSMP could be applied effectively in a Chinese population. #",

The content of the program covers areas such as diet, exercise, medications, fitness, emotion management, problem-solving skills, and communication with health professionals, which are the keys to a better quality of life in persons with chronic illness. During group sessions, participants are guided to experience and master self-management behavior (enactive mastery experiences) [4, 5] . Participants learn to set realistic self-management goals with a ''just-right challenge''; that is, goals that participants feel 70% confident they will complete. The leaders act as role models in self-management, providing a source of vicarious experience. The progress of participants toward the goals is monitored by peers through weekly reviews, sharing, and group problem-solving. Through selfpaced practice with different self-management behaviors, participants gradually acquire self-management skills and improve efficacy in managing their illness. In the long run, persistent application of self-management behaviors is expected to help them achieve better mental and physical health and decrease health-care utilization.",

First, it was important to identify how far the effects of the CDSMP could be consolidated and maintained over a 6month period [6, 9] , although their validity could be threatened by using an extended time window of 6 months because of the effects of history and maturation [10] .

Hong Kong, on the other hand, is a place where ''East meets West,'' having been a British colony for 99 years (up to 1997) but having a population mostly made up of Chinese (95%). Public health services mainly deliver Western medicine, although Chinese medicine and alternative medicine (including Tai-Chi) are widely accepted and practiced. It would be of interest to examine how well the CDSMP, an intervention developed in Western cultures, is received by people in Hong Kong. The empirical results of this study could provide valuable information on the application of the program to Chinese populations. However, in doing this, we made no changes to the content of the original program. We instead merely translated the program content into Cantonese (the language spoken in Hong Kong). Our intention was to explore to what extent the CDSMP was culturally relevant when applied to a Chinese population. Third, we know from the literature on rehabilitation counseling that changes in coping strategies (such as cognitive reappraisal) are an important mechanism underlying adjustment to illness and disability [14] . We hypothesized that changes in coping strategies were possible precursors to changes in longer-term outcomes of the CDSMP, and we added this measure to strengthen the design of the study.",

Participants were recruited through referrals from healthcare and social-work professionals working in hospitals, specialist clinics, and social services.

A comparison group was used for two reasons. First, it was not ethical to delay intervention for those assigned to the control group. Second, we experienced substantial difficulty in recruiting research participants when we explained to them that they may be allocated to a control group without active intervention. We used the Tai-Chi interest class as a comparison group as Tai-Chi is widely accepted in Chinese culture; as a result, the recruitment of participants was improved. However, as we mainly aimed to examine CDSMP in this clinical trial, we tended to use several strategies to limit the potential benefits of Tai-Chi so that it could be used as a comparative intervention. Tai-Chi was taught using an interest group and mass activity format, and the participants were not involved in group discussion or the learning of self-management skills, nor were they encouraged to practice Tai-Chi outside of class. All participants in the comparison group were offered the opportunity to enroll in the CDSMP after completing the clinical trial.

From the single-group analysis, because both groups showed significant increases in exercising, it appeared that no significant changes occurred in exercise levels between the two groups. Second, the CDSMP group used significantly more types of cognitive methods (e.g., relaxation, guided imagery, positive thinking) than did the comparison group to manage disease symptoms like pain and discomfort. On the whole, the results suggest that the CDSMP was effective in helping participants acquire self-management behaviors with respect to cognitive-symptom management and exercise by the end of the 6-week program. In fact, these two types of self-management behavior were the ones most commonly seen in the participants' action plans, as reported in their daily logs. Third, we noticed some measurement issues with the two self-management subscales of ''use of community services'' and ''communication with physician.'' Participants' report on the ''use of community services'' subscale could depend on individual needs as well as awareness and availability of neighborhood resources. For the ''communication with physician'' subscale, participants reported in their logs much dissatisfaction in communicating with health professionals. Many said they could do little on their part, and some even said that physicians needed to improve their communication skills. In short, the ''use of community resources'' subscale may be dropped as its reliability is in question. There is also a need to further explore the difficulties in communication with health-care professionals and to use the information to re-design the questions in this subscale, as well as addressing this issue in the program content.",

These results are consistent with those of previous evaluation studies that have shown that self-management interventions for people with chronic illness may not result in short-term changes in perceived health conditions in short-term evaluations [19, 20] . Many chronic diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis or diabetes, are characterized by a recurring pattern of exacerbation and remission of symptoms. It is possible that clients may not perceive significant decreases in pain and physical comfort as a whole. The more immediate benefit of the self-management interventions probably lies in helping clients to perceive more control over their illness and lives, and to apply more effective self-management strategies [14] .",

There were significant increases in self-efficacy and aspects of selfmanagement behavior and coping skills. However, from observation of group processes and the qualitative data collected from participants, several aspects of the program may need further review. First, participants were rather ambivalent about topics related to death and dying. Many were reluctant to discuss the topic of advanced directives and dismissed it as unnecessary. On the other hand, quite a number of participants requested more coverage of suicide and dying. They said that many persons with chronic illness think of ending their own lives some time in the course of their illness. Second, many participants expressed great dissatisfaction in their communication with health-care professionals, especially physicians. Participants were interested in learning ways of getting their opinions across to their doctors. Thus, there is a need to review the contents of the CDSMP regarding these two aspects-death and dying, and communication with health professionals.",

We have found that it is rather difficult to attract research participants if they are informed they may be allocated to a control group without active intervention. The best alternative we could implement was to set up a Tai-Chi interest class as a comparison group, and a matched-pairs procedure was conducted before randomization to either the CDSMP group or the Tai-Chi group. As reflected in the results, we found that Tai-Chi in a mass-activity format primarily resulted in an increase in exercising and in the use of coping strategies of hope and prayer, but not in the other outcome domains we measured. Using the Tai-Chi comparison group was a good alternative to using a control group, as it can still provide adequate protection against threats to validity like maturation or history effects as well as selection biases.",

In the original plan of the study, we planned to conduct a third measurement at a 3month follow-up. However, this follow-up measurement was dropped because of the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong during the follow-up period. During this period, people were very afraid to leave home, and many tried to avoid social contact as much as possible. People with chronic illness were advised by the Health Department that they were more vulnerable to SARS than the general public, which decreased the feasibility of conducting the follow-up assessment. Thus, the nature of this study was reframed as a short-term evaluation of the CDSMP. In a further evaluation study of CDSMP, we have included a 6-month follow-up to evaluate the longer-term effects of the program.",

While our final sample size of 148 was close to the required sample size of 160, a few factors may have affected the power of the statistical analysis.

However, it was more difficult to control the exposure to Tai-Chi, as Tai-Chi is commonly practiced by the elderly in Hong Kong. Prior exposure to Tai-Chi could have raised the outcomes of the comparison group in the study, and have reduced the power of the between-group analyses.",

First, among all the outcome domains, the CDSMP was most effective in increasing the self-efficacy of illness management upon completion of the 6-week program. This result suggests that the self-efficacy theory may be a useful framework for studying the change mechanisms underlying the CDSMP. Group strategies used in the CDSMP, like rolemodeling, goal-setting, group evaluations and persuasion, and cognitive reappraisals, could be very powerful tools in healthpromotion programs delivered in a small-group format.",

In addition, we also noticed that many participants set self-management goals in practicing cognitive methods. These results support the notion that the practice and application of cognitive methods by participants played an important part in the change processes of the CDSMP. While many Chinese patients may begin their self-management plans by exercising, health-care practitioners should note the importance of teaching cognitive methods as a major coping strategy.",
