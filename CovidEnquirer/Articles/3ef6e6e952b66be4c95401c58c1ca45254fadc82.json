This does not only imply possible problems with animal welfare, but it also causes economic losses to the farmer. The objective of this study was to evaluate time trends in on-farm dairy cow mortality in Sweden and identify potential herd-level risk factors. Data were retrieved on all Swedish dairy herds enrolled in the milk recording scheme between 2002 and 2010. Herds with a herd size of <20 cows or a mortality rate (MR) of >40 dead or euthanized cows per 100 cow-years were excluded. Two different models were used: 1 multiple-year analysis, which included 6,898 herds during the period 2002 to 2010 and 1 single-year analysis including 4,252 herds for the year 2010, where other variables that were not present during the entire multiple year study were analyzed. The outcome variable was the number of euthanized and dead cows per year and season. A negative binomial regression model, adjusted for clustering within herd, was applied to both models. Fixed effects in the multiple-year analysis were breed, calving interval, herd size, milk yield, region, season, pasture period, and year. The fixed effects in the single-year analysis were breed, calving interval, conventional versus organic farming, herd size, housing system, milk yield, region, and season. The results demonstrated that MR gradually increased from 5.1 to 6.6 events per 100 cow-years during the study period. Swedish MR are consequently on par with, or even greater than, MR among dairy herds in other comparable countries. Higher mortality was associated with larger herd size, longer calving intervals, and herds that had Swedish Holstein as the predominant breed. Lower mortality was observed in herds with a higher herd average milk yield, during the fall and winter, and in organically managed herds. There were regional differences in mortality. An interaction between herd size and season was found in both models. Also, an interaction between housing system and milk yield was found in the single-year analysis. This first assessment of on-farm mortality in Swedish dairy herds confirmed that the MR has increased over the last few years. The study also identified some herd-level risk factors.",

It leads to a misuse of animal resources and to economic loss for the dairy farmer, due to loss of milk production, extra labor, loss of income from the sale of carcasses, and increased replacement costs as the herd turnover rate increases, as well as the cost for cadaver transport and incineration.",

The results from these studies differ but some are in concordance. Previous studies have identified that an 4353 increased proportion of purchased cows Raboisson et al., 2011) , no pasture-grazing Burow et al., 2011; Dechow et al., 2011) , larger herd sizes (N\u00f8rgaard et al., 1999; Smith et al., 2000; Raboisson et al., 2011) and lower herd average milk yield (Smith et al., 2000; , are all factors associated with increased MR. In contrast, Menzies et al. (1995) did not find any effect of herd size on mortality and Miller et al. (2008) found a small but consistent decrease in death frequency as herd size increased. Also, N\u00f8rgaard et al. (1999) found an increase in mortality with increasing average milk yield. These studies were, however, carried out in different countries under varying conditions and this may explain the sometimes conflicting results. Swedish dairy production has undergone large structural changes during the last years and dairy cow mortality has not been thoroughly studied previously. Therefore, a need exists to identify risk factors for mortality also under Swedish production conditions. Such information is of interest not only for improving the management routines, but also for policy makers (e.g., in relation to animal welfare).",

This latter exclusion criterion was used to exclude herds with high mortality due to diseases (e.g., Salmonella), as Swedish farms with certain diseases in the herd are forced to euthanize the whole herd or large groups of animals. One herd (1 herd-year) was excluded because the postal code was missing and it was not possible to identify its location.

The latter was mostly herds with both SR and SH cows, because other dairy breeds, such as Swedish Jersey and Swedish Polled, constitute only about 7% of the cows. Season was treated as a categorical variable with 3 categories: winter-spring (January 1 to April 30), summer (May 1 to August 31), and autumn-winter (September 1 to December 31). This classification was done to discern the grazing period as a separate season and to enable comparison between the early and late housing period. To be able to capture potential nonlinear associations, calving interval and milk yield were treated as categorical variables with 4 categories based on quartiles: <389.3 d, 389.3 to 403.5 d, 403.6 to 421.9 d, and \u2265422.0 d; and <8, 525 kg of ECM, 8, 525 to 9, 290 kg of ECM, 9, 291 to 9,980 kg of ECM, and \u22659,981 kg of ECM, respectively.

Region was treated as a categorical variable with 6 categories, according to Figure 1 . Swedish legislation stipulates that cows should be on pasture for at least 6 h per day for a period of time. As this period is longer in southern Sweden (4 mo) compared with the northern parts (2 or 3 mo), a pasture variable was created as a categorical variable with 3 classes: 2, 3, and 4 mo of legislated pasture period (SJVFS, 2010). All classifica-tions were done within herd-year (i.e., allowing herds to change class over the years).",

            "text": "Our results show that the on-farm MR among Swedish dairy cows increased from 5.1 to 6.6 events per 100 cow-years between 2002 and 2010. This increasing trend is consistent with the results from other studies performed in countries with intensive milk production (Thomsen et al., 2004; USDA, 2007; Miller et al., 2008) , but the average rate in our study is in the upper range of what others have found USDA, 2007; Pinedo et al., 2010; Burow et al., 2011; Raboisson et al., 2011) . Dairy cattle production in Sweden has undergone considerable changes during the last decade, with an increase in the average herd size from approximately 40 to 60 cows. During 2002 to 2010, the proportion of small herds (<50 cows) has decreased from 71 to 52%, and the portion of cows in small herds has decreased from 48 to 25%. In the same time period, the portion of large herds (>200 cows) has increased from 0.8 to 2.8%, and the portion of cows in large herds has increased from 5 to 12% (Swedish Dairy Association, 2011). Also, more herds are being kept in freestalls than in tie-stalls, there is an increased use of AMS, and SH are increasingly replacing SR cows, with an accompanying, relatively modest increase in average milk yield (Swedish Dairy Association, 2011). However, neither the increased herd size nor increased use of SH cows can be the only reasons for the increasing mortality, although both factors are identified as risk factors in our analyses, because also High milk yield was associated with reduced mortality in our multivariable model (Table 4 ). Previous studies have presented the same association between milk yield and mortality. demonstrated decreased mortality risk (odds ratio 0.93) with an in-creased mean milk yield per cow-year of 1,000 kg. Also, a herd average milk production level greater than 9,072 kg had death losses of 5.9% compared with death losses of 7.7% that were found in herds producing less than 7,258 kg of milk (Smith et al., 2000) . By contrast, Miller et al. (2008) found that death frequency increased with 0.4% when the average milk yield per cow increased by 1,000 kg in Holsteins and Jerseys and Dematawewa and Berger (1998) showed that high-producing cows are less likely to survive. An explanation for the association in our study might be that milk yield at a herd level may be more associated with the level of management. High average milk yields as in this study cannot be achieved without good management. A farmer who is able to obtain a high milk production probably also does many other things right, thereby decreasing the risk of cows dying. Also, this association between high milk yield and reduced mortality is valid only at a herd level. Extrapolating to the individual cow level may be an \"ecological fallacy\" (Robinson, 2009; i.e ., associations at the herd level may not necessarily apply at the cow level). Consistent with results from other studies (Smith et al., 2000; Hadley et al., 2006; Dechow and Goodling, 2008) the MR ratio in our study increased with increasing herd size. In larger herds, less time is generally available to spend on individual cows (N\u00f8rgaard et al., 1999) . Also, pasture management becomes more complicated in larger herds. Decreased grazing time or zero grazing has been associated with increased mortality Burow et al., 2011) and with a higher proportion of loser cows (Thomsen et al., 2007) . Zero grazing is not allowed in Sweden, according to legislation, and dairy cows have to be given the opportunity to graze for at least 6 h a day for 2 to 4 mo, depending on the region (SJVFS, 2010). At least 80% of the pasture has to be covered with grass, but the quality of the offered pasture is not regulated or controlled, and problems related to grazing may still be part of the explanation for the association between herd size and mortality in Sweden. This may also be supported by the interaction between herd size and season, showing a slightly reduced beneficial status during autumn-winter for the larger herds (i.e., the difference between autumn-winter and winterspring is decreasing with increasing herd size; Table 4 ).",

(2011) demonstrated that season had no effect on probability of mortality in primiparous cows, but found that multiparous cows were more likely to die in spring and summer than in fall or winter. Also, Pinedo et al. (2010) showed that annualized death rates were highest in spring and summer (7.8 and 6.9%, respectively) and lowest during autumn (5.5%). An Italian study (Vitali et al., 2009 ) demonstrated, however, that the spring season had the lowest frequency of deaths and the summer season the highest, as a consequence of heat-related stress, which agrees with Crescio et al. (2010) who found that increases in the temperature-humidity index above a certain threshold resulted in higher risk of mortality. No significant seasonal variation was observed by Faye and Perochon (1995) , although they found that the beginning of the grazing period seemed to be associated with a higher MR. It can be debated if the high MR ratio observed during summer is a consequence of the previous indoor period or if it is due to the possible heat stress for cows on pasture (Kendall et al., 2006) . Burow et al. (2011) found that free access between barn and pasture was associated with higher mortality compared with systems where the farmer followed the herd out to the pasture and then brought them home for milking. Burow et al. (2011) proposed that less frequent observation of the cows (and the associated nonidentification of sick cows) could be part of the explanation. A lesser MR ratio during autumn-winter can be a positive effect of the previous pasture season, as Alban and Agger (1996) found that grazing is associated with better health. Burow et al. (2011) and Dechow et al. (2011) concluded that the more time cows spend on pasture, the lower the mortality. This is also supported by our results showing that regions with a longer pasture period, according to legislation, had a lower MR ratio. In Sweden, no seasonal calving pattern exists and the differences in death frequency are, therefore, not a consequence of unequal calving distribution.",

Bidokhti et al. (2009) compared 20 organic and 20 conventional managed herds in Sweden, and demonstrated a decreased likelihood of infection with bovine corona virus and bovine syncytial virus in organically managed herds. The beneficial status in the organic herds may partly be explained by the closely regulated animal trading, which only allows trading between organic herds. Recommendations also exist relating to quarantine before introducing new animals (Swedish Organic Certification Association, 2011), which may decrease the risk of introducing infectious diseases that increases the risk for on-farm mortality. In addition, organic herds generally have a longer, and more regulated, pasture season. Accordingly, organically managed cows in Sweden have to get >6 kg of the daily DMI from the pasture and spend at least 12.5 h per day on pasture during the pasture season (Swedish Organic Certification Association, 2011). There are also managerial differences between organic and conventional herds that may explain the differences. Some of them, such as herd size, milk yield, housing system and breed, were accounted for in the multivariable analyses (Table 5) and additional explanations should be investigated further.",

The main difference between SH and SR cows is the higher yield (in kilograms of milk) in SH cows, although the yield in kilograms of solids is almost equal (Swedish Dairy Association, 2011). However, other differences also exist, such as size and conformation (e.g., udder and stature), which may contribute to the differences in mortality that we observed in the multivariable analyses, where milk yield was also included in the models. Indications of differences in immunological and metabolic patterns also exist between the 2 breeds (Nyman et al., 2008) .",

We would argue that calving interval at a herd level in this case may serve as a proxy for good management, as has also been indicated by Sandgren et al. (2009) and Nyman et al. (2011) , and that the high level of management needed to achieve short calving intervals also increases the probability for low on-farm mortality. We found regional differences in MR ratio. The length of the legislated pasture season, being shorter in Norrland, explained some, but not all, of the differences among regions in our study, as the model with region had a better fit to the data than the model that included pasture period. A possible explanation for the higher MR ratio in Norrland compared with S\u00f6dra G\u00f6taland is that distances between farmers, veterinar-ians, and abattoirs are longer in Norrland, but this cannot explain the numerically higher MR ratio in \u00d6stra G\u00f6taland and V\u00e4stra Svealand. More detailed studies are, therefore, needed to further elucidate this finding.",

However, a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression model was also tested because there was an excess of zero counts in the data set. The ZINB model handles zero counts in 2 separate ways: by logistic regression, where the probability of mortality is the outcome, and by negative binomial regression, where the mortality risk is estimated conditional on occurring mortality in the herd (Dohoo et al., 2009) . The Vuong test showed that a ZINB model fit the data better compared with the negative binomial model. However, none of the predictors became significant in the logistic portion of the ZINB model and the information from the ZINB model was equal to the information gained from the negative binomial model. Therefore, the ZINB model was rejected and a negative binomial regression model was used for the analyses because of the much easier interpretation. The model evaluation indicated a lack of fit, but this was mainly due to the observations with high mortality, which were not predicted well by the model and, thus, not due to an excess of zero counts in the data.",
