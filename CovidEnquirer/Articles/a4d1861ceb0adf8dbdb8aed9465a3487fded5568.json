Cuprizone also reduced myelin basic 43 protein (MBP) at seven weeks post-cuprizone removal while having no effect on myelin-44 associated glycoprotein (MAG) at this time point. C57BL/6N mice also showed less MBP than 45 C57BL/6J mice.

Repeated BE that occurs at least once per week for at 56 least three months is termed binge eating disorder (BED). BE has a lifetime prevalence of 57 approximately 4.5% (Hudson, Hiripi, Pope, & Kessler, 2007) and is associated with a number of 58 comorbid behavioral, mood, and physical disorders such as substance abuse, depression, 59 obesity, and chronic pain (Bulik & Reichborn-Kjennerud, 2003; Citrome, 2017; Hudson et al., 60 2007) . Although there is no sex difference in the lifetime prevalence of BE, women are nearly 61 twice as likely as men to progress to the more severe BED (3.5% vs. 2.0% respectively (Hudson 62 et al., 2007) . However, the etiology of this sex difference is not known. amygdala-hippocampus complex in AN, and greater frontal cortical response to food stimuli in 69 BED (Geliebter et al., 2006) . Another important neuroanatomical change common to multiple 70 types of ED involves changes in myelin which is the lipid-rich, membranous insulation sheath that 71 extends from oligodendrocytes to the axons and is involved in axon maintenance (via 72 oligodendrocyte signaling) and function, including rapid salutatory conduction of action potentials. 73 BN is associated with a reduction in fractional anisotropy, a brain imaging measure of white matter 74 integrity, in the corona radiata and corpus callosum ( For MAG detection, blots were incubated in a 1:5,000 dilution of anti-MAG antibody (EMD 194 Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA, #MAB1567) in 5% BSA in TBST overnight at 4C, then a 1:10,000 195 dilution of peroxidase conjugated donkey anti mouse antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch, West 196",

However, for MBP, cuprizone treatment induced a 295 significant decrease in total MBP and in each of the MBP isoforms compared to control mice 296 The demyelinating agent cuprizone induced comparable weight loss in females and males 303 of both the BE-resistant B6J substrain and the BE-prone B6NJ substrain (Figs.1,2 ), yet it induced 304 robust substrain-and sex-dependent effects on PF intake. In contrast to our hypothesis that 305 administration of the demyelinating agent cuprizone would enhance BE, we observed the 306 opposite result -a robust reduction in BE in male but not female mice of the BE-prone B6NJ strain 307 (Fig.3) . The male-selective decrease in BE in cuprizone-treated B6NJ males could not be 308 explained by confounding effects on locomotor activity (Fig.4) contributes to the high mortality rates in cuprizone doses exceeding 0.3% (Hiremath et al., 1998; 314 Stidworthy et al., 2003) . The mechanism behind cuprizone-induced weight loss is unclear, but 315 could involve copper chelation, given that copper deficiency in both rats (C. G. Taylor, Bettger, & 316 Bray, 1988) and mice (Prohaska, 1983 ) results in reduced body weight. In the present study, we 317 report a similar degree of weight loss in both female and male cuprizone-treated mice of both 318 substrains (Fig. 2) . Thus, it is unlikely that weight loss alone is responsible for the male-specific 319 reduction in BE and compulsive-like eating in the BE-prone B6NJ substrain. Also, food restriction-320 induced weight loss promotes rather than reduces BE in rodents (Consoli, Contarino, Tabarin The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

It is also possible that cuprizone induced an anhedonic-like 341 state selectively in B6NJ males that caused a reduction in PF intake (Sen et al., 2019) or, e.g., 342",

K. Babbs et al., 2018; Richard K. Babbs et al., 2019; Kirkpatrick et al., 2017) where rodents 166 will normally avoid the aversive, light side. The light/dark box consists of a dark side, which is an 167 enclosed black, opaque Plexiglas chamber, and a light side with clear Plexiglas. An open doorway 168 allowed free access to both sides. A non-porous ceramic bowl containing forty, 20 mg PF pellets 169 was placed in the center of the light side. Mice were initially placed on the light side facing both 170 the food and the doorway and were video recorded for 30 min. Because the light side is aversive, 171 increased behaviors in this environment were operationalized as compulsive-like, including 172 compulsive-like eating. 173 On D24, brains were extracted and punches of the left and right striatum were harvested 174 and combined as previously described (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Yazdani et al., 2015), flash frozen 175 on acetone and dry ice, and stored at -80\u00b0C until western blotting procedures commenced.

Instead, cuprizone reduced BE in the BE-prone B6NJ strain and it did so only in male mice 329(Fig.3). This are several potential explanations underlying the substrain-and sex-dependent 330 effect. Perhaps males are more sensitive to the ingestive and/or post-ingestive aversive 331properties of the cuprizone diet (e.g., taste, nausea) and show a learned, generalization effect on 332 PF intake during BE. However, this explanation cannot account for the similar rate of body weight 333 recovery in females and males following replacement of the home cage cuprizone diet with home 334 cage chow(Fig.2B,C). Another possibility is that cuprizone induced a selective change in the 335 perception or the hedonics of sweet taste in males. Indeed, only the cuprizone-treated B6NJ 336 males initially consumed less PF than their control B6NJ male counterparts on the very first PF 337 training day [t(14) = 2.47; p = 0.027;Fig.3G].

Alternative 349 splicing of MBP produces four major products coded by a single gene with alternative start sites 350 for the larger and smaller isoforms, including the full length 21.5 kDa protein as well as the major 351 18.5 kDa isoform and the 17 and 14 Kd isoforms (de Ferra et al., 1985; Harauz et al., 2009). MAG 352 is a 100 kDa transmembrane glycoprotein of the inner layer of the myelin sheath that is expressed 353 in oligodendrocytes and Schwan cells and contributes to the formation and maintenance of the 354 myelin sheath as well as inhibitory signaling cascades during neuronal regeneration (Han et al., 355 2013). Previous studies have found a decrease in both proteins following cuprizone treatment 356 followed by a recovery of MAG and MBP levels during remyelination (Ludwin & Sternberger, 357 1984). It is unclear why we did not observe a change in MAG levels but perhaps the abbreviated 358 protocol in our study was insufficient to change MAG levels. In support, a previous study of MBP 359 and MAG in a viral model of recurring demyelinating lesions found a preferential decrease in MBP 360 (Dal Canto & Barbano, 1985). Alternatively, our cuprizone regimen could have induced a 361 reduction in MAG early on that recovered by the time of assessment at nearly nine weeks 362",

However, a limitation of 374 the current study is that because all mice received PF for BE training, we cannot state whether 375 the decrease in MBP at the protein level in the B6NJ substrain versus the B6J substrain is simply 376 a function of Genotype (Substrain) or if it also depends on training in BE with PF. Accumulating 377 studies suggest a potential role of CYFIP proteins in myelination/demyelination. CYFIP2 facilitates 378 the adhesion of T cells in CD4+ cells from patients with multiple sclerosisa disease with the 379 hallmark feature of demyelination (Mayne et al., 2004). A recent study employing overexpression 380 of Cyfip1 (gene homolog of Cyfip2) in mice resulted in changes in gene expression enriched for 381 myelination (Fricano-Kugler et al., 2019). Furthermore, a second recent study found that Cyfip1 382 haploinsufficiency disrupted white matter, myelin sheath (axon diameter), and the intracellular 383 distribution of MBP from the cell body to the processes of mature oligodendrocytes without 384 changing axon number or diameter (Silva et al., 2019). We recently reported that Cyfip1 385 haploinsufficiency disrupts BE in a complex manner that depends on the Cyfip2 genotype 386 inherited from the particular B6 substrain as well as sex, and parent-of-origin (Richard K. Babbs 387 et al., 2019). Future immunoblotting and immunohistochemical analyses will be necessary to 388 determine if there are pre-existing differences in myelin proteins between na\u00efve B6 substrains 389 so, whether these differences are caused by the native Cyfip2 coding mutation in the B6NJ 390 substrain (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Kumar et al., 2013). 391",

Moreover, when rats were acutely fasted (12 hours), males showed a 397 modest increase in food consumption in the 24 h post-fast, while females showed a robust 398 increase in consumption that was significantly greater than that of the males(Gayle, Desai,  399    Casillas,Beloosesky, & Ross, 2006). In a closer examination of our data, although both females 400 and males treated with cuprizone showed similar reductions in body weight and similar regaining 401 of body weight to pre-cuprizone levels(Fig.2), B6NJ females showed a faster percent body weight 402 increase compared to B6NJ males during the first 24 h after the cuprizone diet was replaced with 403 the normal chow diet [KEITH: t(df)= 2.5; p = 0.02; data not shown), providing some evidence for 404 slower rebound hyperphagia in B6NJ males that could extend to less acute and escalated PF 405 intake in the 30 min training trials. 406Another potential factor explaining the male-specific reduction in BE with cuprizone could 407 involve sex differences in the demyelinating effects of cuprizone and/or the process of 408 remyelination. Previous reports have found no significant sex difference in cuprizone-induced 409 demyelination in C57BL/6J mice (L. C. Taylor, Gilmore, Ting, & Matsushima, 2010). However, a 410 separate study in the SJL inbred mouse strain showed less severe cuprizone-induced 411 demyelination and loss of oligodendrocytes in female SJL and Swiss Webster mice(Ludwin,  412   1978; L. C. Taylor, Gilmore, & Matsushima, 2009) which is consistent with the lack of significant 413 behavioral effects observed with B6NJ females in the current study. Given that we used a different 414 cuprizone regimen and importantly, given that we observed a sex difference in cuprizone 415 in a different genetic B6 substrain (B6NJ), it is possible that B6NJ female mice 416 are less sensitive to cuprizone-induced demyelination which in turn could explain the lack of 417 behavioral effect. However, our current immunoblotting results with MAG and MBP fail to support 418 this hypothesis as we did not identify any significant Sex effects or Sex-interactive effects at nearly 419 nine weeks after the beginning of cuprizone treatment. Assessment of myelin proteins via 420 immunoblot and immunohistochemical procedures at multiple earlier time points (e.g., starting at 421 five weeks)(Doan et al., 2013) and in multiple brain regions could address whether the enhanced 422 behavioral effects of cuprizone in B6NJ males are supported by enhanced or earlier 423demyelination. 424To summarize, we observed a male-specific reduction in BE in the BE-prone B6NJ 425 substrain in response to the demyelinating agent cuprizone. These results suggest that sex-426 specific neurobiological mechanisms could underlie BE in a manner that depends on genetic 427background. Future studies employing additional and more selective demyelination/remyelination 428 strategies in a spatiotemporal manner on multiple genetic backgrounds are necessary to test the 429 contribution of sex differences in myelin dynamics in the establishment of and recovery from BE.430 431 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 432 We thank Dr. Carmela R.

Additionally, there was 495 an effect of Day [F(5,275) = 13.53; p = 8.2 x 10 -12 ], a Substrain x Day interaction [F(5,275) = 4.83; of B6J mice on all days (unpaired t-tests: #all ps < 0.003; \u03b1corrected = 0.0083). 499 Cuprizone-treated B6NJ mice consumed less PF than their control B6NJ counterparts on D16 500 and D18 [t(30) = 3.20, 3.49; *p = 0.0032, 0.0015, respectively; \u03b1adjusted = 0.0083]. (B): In examining 501 escalation in PF intake, both control B6NJ mice and cuprizone-treated B6J mice showed 502 significant, non-zero slopes, indicating escalation [F(1,94) = 32.10, $p <0.0001; F(1,88) = 7.15; 503 %p < 0.01, respectively]. Furthermore, control B6NJ mice showed a significantly greater slope 504 than cuprizone-treated B6NJ mice [F(1,188) = 6.07; #p = 0.015] but there was no difference in 505 slope between treatments in B6J mice [F(1,182) = 2.83; p = 0.094]. (C): In examining compulsive-506 like PF intake in the light/dark conflict test, there was a main effect of Substrain [F(1,55) = 30.65; 507 #p = 8.9 x 10 -7 (B6NJ mice showed greater PF intake than B6J mice)] and Sex [F(1,55) = 14.07; 508 p = 4.3 x 10 -4 ], but no effect of Treatment [F(1,55) = 0.90; p = 0.35] and no interactions (ps > 509 0.17). (D): In examining the effect of cuprizone treatment on PF intake during BE training in 510 females, there was a main effect of Substrain [F(1,28) = 14.63; p = 0.00067], but no effect of 511 Treatment [F(1,28) = 0.081 ; p = 0.78] and no Substrain x Treatment interaction [F(1,28) = 0.51; 512 p =0.48]. There was also an effect of Day [F(5,140) = 8.93; p = 2.2 x 10 -7 ] and a Substrain x Day 513 interaction [F(5,140) = 2.50; p = 0.033]. Importantly, the lack of effect of Treatment or interaction 514 with Substrain was confirmed by a lack of significant pairwise difference in PF intake between 515 cuprizone-treated B6NJ females and control B6NJ females for any of the six training days [t(14) 516 = 0.55, 0.38, 0.19, 0.32, 0.96, 0.97; p = 0.59, 0.71, 0.85, 0.75, 0.35, 0.35, respectively; \u03b1adjusted = 517 0.0083]. Thus, the reduction in PF intake in cuprizone-treated B6NJ mice in panels A-C is not 518 mediated by females. (E): In examining escalation of PF intake in females, both the B6NJ control 519 females and the cuprizone-treated B6J females showed a significant non-zero escalation [F(1,46) 520 = 16.18, *p < 0.001; F(1,46) = 8.59, %p < 0.01, respectively] and although there was no difference 521 in slope between the two treatments in B6NJ females [F(1,92) = 1.15; p = 0.29], cuprizone-treated 522 that was driven by the uptick in PF intake on the final training day (D16) in cuprizone-524 treated B6J females (D16). (F): In examining compulsive-like eating in the light/dark test in 525 females, there was a main effect of Substrain [F(1,28) = 11.65; #p = 0.002] but no effect of 526 Treatment [F(1,28) = 0.049; p = 0.83] and no interaction [F(1,28) = 0.031; p = 0.86]. The effect of 527 Substrain was explained by greater overall PF intake in B6NJ females versus B6J females (#). 528 (G): In examining the effect of cuprizone on PF intake during BE training in males, there was a 529 main effect of Substrain [interaction [F(5,135) = 2.99; p = 0.014]. Cuprizone-treated B6NJ males showed 534 less PF intake than control B6NJ males on D16 and D18 [t(14) = 4.68, 6.31; p = 3.6 x 10 -4 , 1.9 x 535 10 -5 ; \u03b1adjusted = 0.0083], thus accounting for the decreased PF intake in the sex-collapsed dataset 536 in panels A and B. (H): In examining the slopes in escalation, only the B6NJ control males showed 537 a significant, non-zero escalation in PF consumption [F(1,46) = 22.83; $p < 0.0001] and this slope 538 was significantly greater than cuprizone-treated B6NJ males [F(1,92) = 10.23; #p = 0.0019]. (I): 539 In examining compulsive-like PF intake in the light/dark test in males, there was a main effect of 540 Substrain [F(1,27) = 35.81; #p = 2.2 x 10 -6 (B6NJ males showed greater PF intake than B6J 541 males)], Treatment [F(1,27) = 8.31; p = 0.0077], and a Substrain x Treatment interaction [F(1,27) 542 = 7.55; p = 0.011]. The interaction was explained by cuprizone-treated B6NJ males showing 543 reduced compulsive-like PF intake compared to control B6NJ males [t(14) = 3.18; *p = 0.0067]. 544 Effect of cuprizone treatment on locomotor activity. (A,C,E): In examining 546 locomotor activity on D1 over 30 min, there was an effect of Sex with females showing the 547 expected greater locomotor activity than males [F(1,55) = 7.84; p = 0.0071] but no effect of 548 ]. To determine the source of this three-way interaction on D22, we analyzed 553 females and males separately. (D): For D22 locomotor activity in females, there was a main effect 554 of Genotype [F(1,28) = 6.86; p = 0.014], no effect of Treatment [F(1,28) = 0.38; p = 0.55], and a 555 significant Genotype x Treatment interaction [F(1,28) = 6.94; p = 0.014]. The source of the 556 interaction was explained by cuprizone-treated B6J females showing less locomotor activity on 557 D22 than control B6J females [t(14) = 2.23; p = 0.043]. For males, there was no effect of Genotype 558 Effect of Substrain and Treatment on MAG and MBP protein levels in the striatum. 562 (A): Representative immunoblots of striatal tissue from for MAG and MBP from cuprizone-treated 563 (+) and untreated (-) C57BL/6J (J) and C57BL/6NJ (N) mice. (B,C): For MAG protein, there was 564 no effect of Cuprizone Treatment [F(1,54) = 0.47; p = 0.49], Substrain [F(1,54) = 2.28; p = 0.14], 565 Sex [F(1,54) = 2.87; p = 0.10] or any interactions (ps > 0.34). The lack of effect of Treatment and 566 Substrain on MAG protein levels is shown graphically in panels B and C as a comparison with 567 MBP (below). (D): For total MBP protein, there as an effect of Treatment [F(1,54) = 20.96; p = 2.8 568 x 10 -5 ] and a nearly significant effect of Substrain [F(1,54) = 3.72; p = 0.059] but no effect of Sex 569 [F(1,54) = 0.15; p = 0.70] and no interactions (ps > 0.14). For the 21 kDa band, there was a main 570 effect of Treatment [F(1,54) = 8.06; p = 0.0064] but no effect of Substrain [F(1,54) = 1.90; p = 571 0.17], Sex [F(1,54) = 0.012; p = 0.91], or any interactions (ps > 0.10). For the 18.5 + 17 kDa 572 bands, there was a main effect of Treatment [F(1,54) = 17.42; p = 0.00011] and a nonsignificant 573 effect of Substrain [F(1,54) = 3.29; p = 0.075] but no effect of Sex [F(1,54) = 0.078; p = 0.78] and 574 no interactions (ps > 0.11). (D): To follow up on the Treatment effects, unpaired 577 t-tests for the total, 21 kDa, 18/17 kDa, and 14 kDa MBP bands indicated a significant decrease 578 in MBP for all bands []. (E): To follow up on the trending Substrain effect, unpaired t-tests for the total, 21 580 kDa, 18.5/17 kDa, and 14 kDa MBP bands indicated a significant decrease in the immunostaining 581 of the 14 kDa band (*) in the B6NJ strain (N)",
