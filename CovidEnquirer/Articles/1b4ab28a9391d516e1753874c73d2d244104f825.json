            "text": "The spread of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has triggered a global emergency, that demands urgent solutions for detection and therapy to prevent escalating health, social and economic impacts. The spike protein (S) of this virus enables binding to the human receptor ACE2, and hence presents a prime target for vaccines preventing viral entry into host cells 1 . The S proteins from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are similar 2 , but structural differences in the receptor binding domain (RBD) preclude the use of SARS-CoV-1-specific neutralizing antibodies to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3 . Here we used comparative pangenomic analysis of all sequenced Betacoronaviruses to reveal that, among all core gene clusters present in these viruses, the envelope protein E shows a variant shared by SARS and SARS-Cov2 with two completely-conserved key functional features, an ion-channel and a PDZ-binding Motif (PBM). These features trigger a cytokine storm that activates the inflammasome, leading to increased edema in lungs causing the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 4-6 , the leading cause of death in SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection 7,8 . However, three drugs approved for human use may inhibit SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 Protein E, either acting upon the ion channel (Amantadine and Hexamethylene amiloride 9,10 ) or the PBM (SB203580 5 ), thereby potentially increasing the survival of the host, as already demonstrated for SARS-CoV-1in animal models. Hence, blocking the SARS protein E inhibits development of ARDS in vivo. Given that our results demonstrate that the protein E subcluster for the SARS clade is quasi-identical for the key functional regions of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, we conclude that use of approved drugs shown to act as SARS E protein inhibitors can help prevent further casualties from COVID-2019 while vaccines and other preventive measures are being developed.",

Three major actions, confinement, detection and therapy are required to contain this pandemic. Detection and therapy can be guided by virus sequence data, which was first made available in 17 December, 2019 at gsaid.org, soon after detection of the first cases. The SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence data are a pivotal resource on its own, but can gain greater value when embedded within those of other Betacoronavirus, allowing a comparative pangenomic analysis. This approach can help identify the core genome of Betacoronaviruses and extract accessory genomic features shared by a subset of these viruses or unique to SARS-CoV-2. Whereas core genomic features are required for the virus to be functional, accessory features are candidates to provide insights into the drivers of the unique capacities of SARS-CoV-2 explaining its spread and virulence. Genome annotation and structural modelling can then be used to assess the possible functions of these accessory features and guide approaches to detection and treatment.",

Previous approaches 11 proceeded by extracting individual genes, aligning them, and then establishing a phylogeny. Our approach differs in that we first cluster all sequences to then calculate the alignment. This approach, based on using panX 12 , allows us to achieve a higher sensibility in the detection of gene clusters.

These five genes define the core pan-genome. However, panX 12 only retrieved four of these (S, M, N and the ORF1ab) as components of the core pan-genome ( Figure 1 ). However, the fifth gene in the Betacoronavirus core genome, the envelope protein (E), varied among genomes, defining three distinct subclusters within the envelope protein E of Betacoronaviruses ( Figure 2 ). One of these E clusters comprises only SARS-CoV-1 (AY274119), SARS-CoV-2 and two Bat Coronaviruses (MG772933 and KF63652). Among the other two protein E gene clusters, one includes MERS (JX869059 and KC164505) and several coronaviruses from different animals, while the third cluster includes coronaviruses from two Rousettus bats. To validate the conservation and specificity of the SARS E cluster, we compared the SARS-CoV-2 E sequence with all known sequences in NCBI's non redundant (NR) protein database. This comparison showed, consistent with our pan-genome analysis, that the subcluster of the protein E gene appearing in SARS-CoV-2, SARS and two bat coronaviruses, is defined by the same essential functional features, which are exactly conserved (100% similarity) between bats and SARS-CoV-2, but differ slightly (95% similarity with one deletion and three substitutions) from SARS ( Figure 2B and supplementary figure 7) . A recent study compared genomes and gene families of all alpha, beta, delta and gamma coronaviruses, but did not explore the variability present within the protein E gene sequences, which we did through the clustering approach reported above.",

A gene cluster annotated as ORF10 appeared to be unique to SARS-CoV-2 ( Fig. 1) . However, a blast-based search against the DNA of all sequences in NCBI's NT database showed that the ORF10 sequence matches with 100% coverage in DNA of other SARS-like genomes, but there is no open-reading frame predicted for those genomes in the matching region ( Fig 1A) . Hence, the apparent uniqueness of ORF10 might simply be an artifact of the GeneBank annotation pipeline that did not predict an ORF for this gene in other matching genomes. However, for completeness, we report a functional analysis of ORF10 as Supplementary material (Supplementary material 1) since at present there is no experimental evidence available against or in favor of this being a real gene.",

Our bioinformatic protein structural analysis confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a (cluster 12), also known as viroporin, and ORF7a (cluster 17), that is same as ORF8a 14 in SARS, retain the structural features observed in other SARS viruses, namely a multi-pass transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic b-barrel or b-sandwich fold (ORF3a) and an N-terminal secpathway signal peptide, cleaved after residue 15, an immunoglobulin-like b-sandwich fold stabilized by two cysteine di-sulfide bonds, and a C-terminal single-pass transmembrane helix (ORF7a; Supplementary Figures 5,6 ). Hence these SARS-CoV-2 proteins are expected to act in the same way as they do in other SARS, namely as accessory proteins mostly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment, but also occurring on the cell membrane where they enhance viral pathogenicity and mortality through protein-protein interactions [15] [16] [17] .",

All are very short polypeptides (61, 121 and 38 residues for ORF6 and 8, respectively) with a large percentage of hydrophobic residues (62%, 56%, respectively). None of the proteins have trans-membrane regions, but ORF8 has an N-terminal sec-pathway signal peptide with a cleavage site after residues 15, suggesting that it is secreted into the extracellular space ( Supplementary Figures 5,6 ). Following signal peptide cleavage, the ORF8 protein core is predicted to consist largely of b-strands and features 7 cysteines. We predict that this protein adopts a cysteine disulfide-bond stabilized b-sandwich structure similar to the soluble domain of ORF7a (Supplementary Figures 5,6 ), inferring that ORF8 also functions as ligand binding module. ORF6 consists of a long amphipathic helical region, followed by an acidic tail.

The E protein, also a viroporin 19 , was previously confirmed as a determinant of pathogenicity 4,5 in SARS-CoV-1. Protein E was used as target for SARS antivirals 6 , and studies using SARS-CoV with lacking or mutated protein E as vaccine candidates showed promising results [20] [21] [22] [23] .

The protein E from SARS-CoV-2 differs from that of SARS-CoV-1 only by three substitutions and one deletion (Figure 2A Studies on SARS-CoV-1 demonstrated that the E protein uses the IC and PBM to trigger a cytokine storm that activates the inflammasome, leading to increased edema in lungs. Ultimately these events result in ARDS 4-6 , a leading cause of death in SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection 7, 8 . However, the drugs Amantadine, Hexamethylene amiloride and also BIT225 (BIT225 is in clinical trials) completely block the IC activity of SARS-CoV-1 9,10 and restrict its reproduction, leading to better survival of the animal host. The PBM enables the E protein to interact with the cellular PDZ domains. Its association with the tandem PDZ domains of syntenin activates the MAP kinase p38, triggering the overexpression of inflammatory cytokines. Consequently, inhibition of p38 by SB203580 increases the survival of the host 5 .",

Two features are important here, a set of ion-channel forming amino acids (N15 and V25) and the PBM class II motif (DLLV) completely conserved in SARS and SARS-CoV-2, potential targets for COVID-2019 complications such as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).
