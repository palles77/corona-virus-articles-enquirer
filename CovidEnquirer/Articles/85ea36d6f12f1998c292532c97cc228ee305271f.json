            "text": "Background: Alpha-momorcharin (\u03b1-MMC) and momordica anti-HIV protein (MAP30) derived from Momordica charantia L. have been confirmed to possess antitumor and antivirus activities due to their RNA-N-glycosidase activity. However, strong immunogenicity and short plasma half-life limit their clinical application. To solve this problem, the two proteins were modified with (mPEG) 2 -Lys-NHS (20 kDa). Methodology/principal findings: In this article, a novel purification strategy for the two main type I ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs), \u03b1-MMC and MAP30, was successfully developed for laboratory-scale preparation. Using this dramatic method, 200 mg of \u03b1-MMC and about 120 mg of MAP30 was obtained in only one purification process from 200 g of Momordica charantia seeds. The homogeneity and some other properties of the two proteins were assessed by gradient SDS-PAGE, electrospray ionization quadruple mass spectrometry, and N-terminal sequence analysis as well as Western blot. Two polyethylene glycol (PEG)ylated proteins were synthesized and purified. Homogeneous mono-, di-, or tri-PEGylated proteins were characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. The analysis of antitumor and antivirus activities indicated that the serial PEGylated RIPs preserved moderate activities on JAR choriocarcinoma cells and herpes simplex virus-1. Furthermore, both PEGylated proteins showed about 60%-70% antitumor and antivirus activities, and at the same time decreased 50%-70% immunogenicity when compared with their unmodified counterparts. Conclusion/significance: \u03b1-MMC and MAP30 obtained from this novel purification strategy can meet the requirement of a large amount of samples for research. Their chemical modification can solve the problem of strong immunogenicity and meanwhile preserve moderate activities. All these findings suggest the potential application of PEGylated \u03b1-MMC and PEGylated MAP30 as antitumor and antivirus agents. According to these results, PEGylated RIPs can be constructed with nanomaterials to be a targeting drug that can further decrease immunogenicity and side effects. Through nanotechnology we can make them low-release drugs, which can further prolong their half-life period in the human body.",

            "text": "Momordica charantia L. (MC), a Momordica Linn. genus of the family Cucurbitaceae and commonly known as bitter melon, is a traditional medicine plant indigenous to China. 1 The fruit and seed extracts from MC have been used in China for centuries for antivirus, antitumor, and immunopotentiating agent purposes. 2 In recent years, several ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs), including momordica anti-HIV protein (MAP30) and \u03b1-momorcharin (MMC), \u03b2-MMC, and \u03b3-MMC, a group of which belong to the family of single-chain RIPs, were found to have the ability to inhibit protein biosynthesis in tumor cells by catalytic inactivation of the 60S ribosomal subunit. 3, 4 These proteins were also found to be able to inhibit the multiplication of herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), 4, 5 poliovirus I in Hep2 cells, 6 and acquired human immunodeficiency virus type-l (HIV-l). 7 However, the strong immunogenicity, allergic reaction, and short half-life of these proteins have been considered the major barriers for their application as therapeutic agents in vivo. 8, 9 In recent years, researchers have shifted their focus to other technologies. An established technology, polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugation (PEGylation), can bestow on proteins several benefits, such as increasing plasma half-life, decreasing toxicity, and reducing immunogenicity and antigenicity. 9, 10 The Food and Drug Administration has approved the PEGylated forms of the therapeutic proteins such as uricase, erythropoietin, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, interferon, adenosine deaminase, asparaginase, and a growth hormone antagonist. Another technology is nanotechnology, which uses nanomaterials for packing potential therapeutic proteins to extend the half-life period or to make them targeting drugs.",

To overcome these problems, in this study we first purified the two main proteins from bitter melon seeds and carried out their PEGylation using a branched 20 kDa (mPEG) 2 -Lys-NHS directed specifically to lysil \u03b5-amino groups. Homogeneous one-mer, two-mer, and three-mer PEG-RIPs were then identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Not only was their immunogenicity in vivo remarkably decreased but also, importantly, their antitumor and antivirus activities in vitro were moderately influenced when compared with the un-PEGylated counterparts. This work is just the beginning step towards them being used clinically. The application of PEGylation and nanotechnolgy may indicate that the potential application of both \u03b1-MMC and MAP30 can be developed for antitumor and antivirus agents in the future.",

Some properties of these proteins were assessed by SDS-PAGE, ESI-QUAD-MS, MALDI-TOF-MS, and N-terminal sequence as well as Western blotting. This fast, highly efficient methodology enables us to focus more energy on subsequent research. A branched (mPEG) 2 -Lys-NHS(20 kDa) was used to modify these proteins and the serial PEGylated ones were assessed by gradient SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF-MS. The \u03b1-MMC modifier possessed one-mer, two-mer, and three-mer PEGbound chains, while MAP30 modifier obtained one-mer and two-mer PEG-bound chains. PEGylated conjugates preserved moderate activities on JAR choriocarcinoma cells and HSV-1. Furthermore, both PEGylated proteins showed about 60%-70% antitumor and antivirus activities as well as a 50%-70% immunogenicity decrease when compared with unmodified counterparts. To sum up, PEGylation of \u03b1-MMC and MAP30 may offer a possible way for their clinical application as potential therapeutic agents. Nevertheless, to fulfill the requirements of a useful drug, we should meet the challenges, including the reduction of immunogenicity to the greatest extent, the retention of sufficient activity, the extension of the half-life period, and development of various forms of PEG-RIPs. This work is just the beginning for them to be used clinically. After all, therapeutic proteins must fulfill the requirements described previously. PEGylation can reduce immunogenicity and retain certain biological activity of RIPs, but there is lots of work to do for further decreasing their immunogenicity and extending the half-life period.

By using the Compute pI/ Mw program from ExPASy Proteomics Server (http://www. expasy.org), the theoretical pI of \u03b1-MMC is 9.32 and MAP30 is 8.86. And this is coincident with the result of IEF analyses of these two proteins. ESI-QUAD-MS was used to further identify the two proteins, and sequences were analyzed using the BLAST program (http://www.expasy.org/tools/blast/), which demonstrated that they are \u03b1-MMC (Swiss Prot accession number: P16094, peptides are YLLMHLFNYDGK) andMAP30 (Swiss-Prot accession number: P24817, peptides are ESPPEAYNILFK). MALDI-TOF-MS was used to determine the accurate molecular weight of \u03b1-MMC and MAP30. The results showed that the molecular weights were 28551.6 Da and 29072.0 Da, respectively (Figure 3), while the theoretical molecular weight was 27368.36 Da and 29600.74 Da (http:// www.expasy.org).
