It was found that 100% of the cells in the passaged cultures were positive for viral antigen throughout the course of the experiment. Additionally, supernatants collected upon passaging of the cells continuously contained high titers of infectious virus. In six separate cultures persistently infected with either the biological clones or the recombinant virus, a cytopathic effect occurred spontaneously between passage 8 and 94. The cytopathogenic agent in the supernatants of these cultures could be passaged repeatedly, suggesting the generation of a mutant virus. Analysis of RNA from such cultures revealed the presence of a subgenomic viral RNA of approximately 8 kilobases (kb). In all six cases, this RNA had an identical internal deletion of 4764 nucleotides, including the region coding for all structural proteins. The subgenomic RNA replicated and was packaged in the presence of wild-type virus. Cells infected with cytopathogenic virus contained increased amounts of the viral protein NS3 thought to be involved in pestivirus cytopathogenicity. \u00a9 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.",

            "text": "With respect to their effect on tissue culture cells, two biotypes can be distinguished for all pestiviruses . The noncytopathogenic (ncp) biotype replicates without obvious damage to the host cell whereas the cytopathogenic (cp) variant destroys the infected cells, presumably through the apoptosis pathway (Zhang et al., 1996) . In the case of BVDV, the cp viruses are considered to represent mutants of the respective ncp form, which are generated by RNA recombination during replication in persistently infected cattle. The genomes of most cp isolates contain duplications or rearrangements of viral sequences, insertions of host cellular sequences with or without duplication of viral sequences or internal deletions (Meyers et al., 1989 , 1991 , 1992 , Qi et al., 1992 Tautz et al., 1993 Tautz et al., , 1994 . In all cases analyzed so far, these mutations lead to production of the nonstructural protein NS3 in addition to unprocessed protein NS2/3 present in cells infected with ncp BVDV. Thus, NS3 is a marker protein for cp BVDV and also a prime candidate for the cp agent in this system. In contrast, cells infected with ncp CSFV or BDV contain both NS3 and NS2/3 (our results and Becher et al., 1994; Thiel et al., 1996) , raising doubts about the direct correlation of NS3 expression with cytopathogenicity in cell culture.",

Only recently, three cp CSFV isolates were described and shown to contain defective interfering (DI) particles (Meyers and Thiel, 1995) . In contrast, cp BVDV is always isolated together with an antigenically related ncp virus from animals with mucosal disease (Brownlie et al., 1984; Bolin et al., 1985) . In most cases the two biotypes can be cloned and propagated as homogenous populations in cell culture. In contrast, cytopathogenicity of CSFV is caused by a defective virus which can only replicate in the presence of a wild-type helper virus.",

Examples such as BVDV, human im-munodeficiency virus, herpes simplex virus or hepatitis B virus show that viruses can persist in host organisms for very long periods of time. However, the molecular basis of persistence is largely unknown and is additionally complicated by the fact that various mechanisms seem to operate in different cell virus systems (reviewed in Holland, 1990; Oldstone, 1991; Ahmed et al., 1996) . Persistently infected cell cultures represent a valuable tool to study the mechanisms of viral persistence and the molecular evolution of viruses and cells (de la Torre et al., 1985 (de la Torre et al., , 1988 . The latter aspect is especially interesting in the case of single-stranded RNA viruses which lack proofreading and postreplicative error correction mechanisms and are believed to have a high mutation rate (Lai, 1992; Domingo et al., 1996) . We report here the establishment of cell cultures persistently infected with CSFV and the spontaneous generation of cp subgenomic RNA upon repeated passage of the cells.",

The timepoint of CPE observed in three of the four cultures for which virus titers were determined is indicated in Fig. 2 . Inoculation of uninfected cells with clarified supernatants from these cells resulted in rapid induction of a CPE, demonstrating that the cp agent could be passaged. In SK-6 cultures, the CPE became apparent at 20 h after infection and was complete after 72 h, whereas in PK-41 cultures progression of the CPE was somewhat slower, starting at about 30 h postinoculation. In both cell lines, however, a few cells survived and could be further propagated. These cultures continued to produce infectious CSFV (Fig. 2) . Infection of either SK-6 or PK-41 cells seeded in 96-well plates with serial dilutions of the cp supernatants showed that a detectable CPE was only induced at a virus dose of at least 104 TCIDs0 per well. The appearance of focal cell lysis (Fig. 1C ) ruled out the possibility that a soluble cytotoxic agent in the supernatants unrelated to the virus was responsible for the CPE. The slower progres- sion of the CPE observed with supernatants from persistently infected PK-41 cells may reflect the lower titers that were reached with this cell line and thus the lower amounts of the cp agent present in the respective supernatants.",

Therefore, we designed an RT-PCR aimed at the amplification of the sequences flanking the putative deletion found in the described subgenomic RNAs (Fig. 3A and B) . RT-PCR of RNA extracted from supernatants of infected cells using oligonucleotides LT7G1 and PR2 indeed resulted in the amplification of a subgenomic RNA-specific DNA fragment of the expected size of 1.7 kb. PCR products obtained from two separate amplifications from each cp virus stock were directly sequenced across the deletion in both directions. Alignment of the obtained sequences revealed exactly the same dele- tion of 4764 nucleotides for the subgenomic RNA in all cases (Fig. 3C) . The 5' end of the subgenomic RNA is colinear with the first 376 nucleotides of the CSFV genome, representing the 5' nontranslated region (NTR) and the first AUG codon of the open reading frame. The following region corresponds to the 3' half of the wild-type genome starting at nucleotide position 5141~ which is thought to be the first nucleotide of the NS3 gene. Sequence analysis of the 5' NTR ( Fig.  3C) as well as of a region in the gene coding for NS5B (not shown) revealed that strain-specific point mutations were maintained, demonstrating that each subgenomic RNA was derived independently from the respective parent viruses A.1, B.2 and vA187-1.",

Comparison of the recombinant virus vA187-1 and its cp virus stock revealed a slighter decrease of NS2/3 but a similar increase in NS3 (Fig. 6 , lanes 5 and 6) when compared to A.1 and B.2. This was possibly due to the lower titer of the defective particles in the inoculum used in this experiment which was in agreement with a less pronounced CPE in these cells (not shown).",

Experiments aimed at determining the time- 5A ) indicated that the formation of cp CSFV was a random event and that the cp agent was not present in the original virus stocks. In addition, the generation of a cp CSFV in a cell culture infected with virus rescued from the cDNA clone pAl87-1 (Ruggli et al., 1996) proved that the cp agent was generated de novo. These data show that passaging of persistently infected cell cultures can be used to generate cp CSFV. Interestingly, cells which survived the CPE showed altered properties when compared to persistently infected cells which had not experienced a CPE (manuscript in preparation). Meyers and Thiel (1995) , who were the first to describe defective particles in CSFV, reported interference of these particles with helper virus replication. We have not detected any interference on RNA replication caused by the subgenomic cp RNA (Fig. 5B) . Furthermore, our attempts to reproduce the experiment carried out by Meyers and Thiel (1995) to prove interference by infection of cells with serial dilutions of cp virus gave contradictory results. When the RNA was examined at 16 h postinfection, corresponding to one complete replication cycle, no interference was observed, whereas later in infection when the cytopathic effect appeared, results similar to those described by Meyers and Thiel (1995) were obtained. These data further support the absence of interference at the level of RNA replication (manuscript in preparation). Experiments aimed at investigating interference at other levels, such as protein synthesis or packaging, are currently under way.",

            "text": "All cp CSFV characterized so far, including the ones obtained in the present study, were shown to contain both wild-type virus and defective particles. Meyers et al. (1996) confirmed by the generation of recombinant cytopathogenic defective interfering particles from in vitro transcribed subgenomic RNA that this particular RNA is both necessary and sufficient for CSFV cytopathogenicity. Remarkably, the subgenomic cp RNA in all cases analyzed so far have exactly the same genomic structure, characterized by a deletion of 4764 nucleotides. This suggests a common mechanism of generation such as nonhomologous recombination or template switching of the viral RNA polymerase (reviewed in Lai, 1992) . Whether this particular subgenomic RNA is generated exclusively by a site-specific mechanism or whether it is the only RNA from a population of randomly mutated molecules which is replicated and can be packaged is an open question. Also, by performing Northern blot analyses of extracts from various passages of the persistently infected cultures, we have never detected any subgenomic CSFV RNA different from this particular 8 kb species. The subgenomic cp RNA lacks the genes coding for the amino-terminal autoprotease N pr\u00b0, the four structural proteins, p7 and NS2 (Fig. 3) , but allows the expression of the nonstructural proteins NS3 to NS5B ( Fig. 6 and our unpublished observations). This is particularly interesting as cytopathogenicity of cp BVDV is attributed to the expression of NS3 protein, which is not processed from NS2/3 in the case of ncp BVDV . Yet the situation in CSFV and BDV seems more complex. The mere presence of NS3 in infected cells apparently is not sufficient to cause CPE as NS2/3 is at least partially processed into NS2 and NS3 in cells infected with ncp CSFV or BDV (Fig. 5 and Becher et al., 1994) without causing obvious damage to the cells. Meyers and Thiel (1995) suggested that a certain concentration of NS3 has to be reached within a cell to exhibit the CPE or alternatively, that the ratio of NS3 to NS2/3 plays an important role in this process. Our protein analyses of cells infected with ncp and cp CSFV support these hypotheses. High amounts of NS3 were present in cells infected with cp CSFV (Fig. 6) and correlated with the occurrence of the CPE. In addition, expression of NS2/3 (which is coded solely by the helper virus) was decreased, reflecting either interference at the translational level or more efficient processing of NS2/3. Alternatively, the CPE caused by cp CSFV could be due to an NS3 protein which has different properties when compared to NS3 synthesized by ncp pestiviruses. Notably, the cleavage site between NS2 and NS3 and therefore the amino terminus of NS3 is not known for ncp CSFV and BDV.",

SK-6 cells were inoculated with virus of all four passages (ViPal to ViPa4) and stained with crystal violet 48 h after infection. Development of a CPE with virus passages from passage -3 but not from passage -6 shows that the event leading to the generation of the cp agent occurred six to three passages before maximal CPE.
