Asymptomatic carriage is thought to be two-to five-fold more common than the disease itself. The organism produces two exotoxins: toxin A, which is thought to be responsible for most of the gastrointestinal symptoms seen, because it functions as an enterotoxiq and toxin B, which is a potent cytotoxin. A working definition of C. d#icile-associated disease (CDAD) includes (i) diarrhea, defined as at least six watery stools over 36 h, three unformed stools in 24 h for 2 days, or eight unformed stools over 48 h; (ii) pseudomembranes seen at endoscopy of the lower gastrointestinal tract or detection of toxins or toxigenic organisms in stool; (iii) no other recog-nized etiology for diarrhea; and (iv) a history of treatment with antimicrobial or antineoplastic agents within the previous 8 weeks or a response to specific therapy for CDAD (2) . Many antimicrobial and antineoplastic agents have been demonstrated to induce CDAD, but the most common are the antimicrobial agents clindamycin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, and the cephalosporins (3).",

            "text": "Diagnosis of CDAD is important because the disease can be severe and it is a major nosocomial problem. A variety of methods are currently available for the laboratory diagnosis of CDAD, including cell culture assays for the presence of cytotoxin, anaerobic culture of stool for the organism followed by testing for the production of toxin (toxigenie culture), latex agglutination for the detection of C. dr#kile-associated antigen in stool, and enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) for the detection of toxin A or toxin B, or both. EIA formats include both microdilution and immunochromatographic tests. Rapid laboratory diagnosis of CDAD is highly desirable in the setting of hospital cost containment, which makes an EIA for the detection of toxins in stool specimens a desirable testing option. For this reason, many laboratories now perform EIAs for the detection of toxins in stool specimens. Table 1 shows the results of a recent e-mail survey to which clinical microbiologists tirn 56 laboratories across the United States responded. These clinical microbiology labomtories ranged in size from a small laboratory serving a single hospital with 139 beds to a large laboratory serving multiple hospitals with a total of 2,400 beds. A clear majority of respondents (7 1%) perform an EIA as their primary assay for the diagnosis of CDAD.",

There is a case report in the literature of a toxin B gene-deficient isolate (4) associated with CDAD. The patient in this report clearly had diarrhea, and C. d@cile was isolated from the patient's stool. The PCR primer pairs used by the investigators demonstrated the presence of the toxin A gene, but the toxin B gene-specific primers failed to promote amplification of the portion of the toxin B gene they were designed to recognize. Thus, at least a portion of the toxin B gene was missing from the isolate of C. d@ciIe.

It is also possible that the patient was infected with two different strains of C. difficile, one that was toxin B-deficient and one that was not. At the present time, the detection of toxin B alone should suffice for the diagnosis of CDAD. Laboratories that rely on an assay for the detection of toxin A alone may want to reconsider their choice of assays to diagnose CDAD. Isolates that lack a portion of the toxin A gene have been known for some time (56). These organisms were once thought to be unable to cause disease in humans (7) but evidence that these isolates can cause disease is now beginning to surface. A case of pseudomembranous colitis caused by a toxin A-negative, toxin B-positive strain of C. dtfzcile was recently reported from Seattle, WA (8) . Stool specimens from the patient gave a negative result with a toxin A EIA and a positive result with the cytotoxin assay. PCR performed using DNA extracted from the C. d#Ecile strain isolated from the patient's stool demonstrated a truncated (1.7-kb deletion) toxin A gene. The missing portion of the gene coded for the epitope (PCG-4 epitope) that reacts with the monoclonal antibody in the ElA that was used to detect toxin A in stool.",

The first report is from Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada and describes an outbreak involving 16 patients with antibiotic-associated diarrhea or pseudomembranous colitis (9,lO) . The routine diagnostic test used by the hospital laboratory for diagnosis of CDAD was an EIA that detected toxin A alone. The index case was a patient for whom there was a high clinical suspicion of CDAD but whose stools were negative for C. d@kile toxin on three separate occasions when tested by the enzyme immunoassay for toxin A. The diagnosis of CDAD was made by using a cytotoxin assay. Over the next 2 weeks, three additional patients had similar presentations with stool specimens negative by toxin A EIA and positive by a cytotoxin assay. The remaining cases were identified using both a toxin A EIA, which was negative, and an EIA capable of detecting both toxins A and B, which was positive. Cytotoxigenic C. dQj$ciIe isolates with identical pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns were isolated from seven patients. PCR analysis demonstrated that these seven isolates had a 1.8-kb deletion from the carboxy repetitive oligopeptide region of the toxin A gene, which encodes the epitope recognized by the antibody to toxin A in the EIA used as the diagnostic test for C. d@ciIe.",

            "text": "The second outbreak was reported from Meibergdreef, Amsterdam (11). Toxin A-negative, toxin B-positive infections were recognized by the unique cytotoxic effect these organisms produce in the cytotoxin assay described previously by Kato et al. (7) . Discrete clusters of rounded cells were seen rather than cell rounding with disrupted cell-to-cell contact displayed by toxin-A-positive, toxin B-positive strains. This outbreak involved 24 patients whose symptoms ranged from mild to severe; one death occurred. Identical PCR ribotyping and arbitrarily primed PCR patterns were identified for 15 of 16 isolates from the patients involved in the outbreak. Four representative isolates of these toxin A-negative strains had a truncated toxin A gene that was 1.7 kb smaller than expected. These four isolates gave negative results when tested for the production of toxin A by an EIA that detected toxin A alone. The reports described above demonstrate that toxin A-negative, toxin Bpositive organisms can cause disease, and the presence of these organisms in stool specimens cannot be detected by using an EIA that detects toxin A alone. How common are these isolates and how often do they cause disease? These questions are still unanswered. In Japan, Kato et al. (7) reported isolation of these organisms from 6.7% of symptomatic children, 12.5% of asymptomatic children, and 12.5% of asymptomatic adults. Burday et al. (12) report that the incidence of stool specimens that were toxin A negative by EIA but positive by a toxin A + B EIA in two hospitals in New Jersey was 17 and 34%. The initial reports from Kato et al. and the case report and two outbreaks discussed earlier indicate these organisms are found worldwide. These reports make it clear that testing for toxin A alone may lead to undiagnosed cases or outbreaks of CDAD. Therefore, testing for toxin A alone is not without risk, and laboratories testing for toxin A alone should consider switching to the cytotoxin assay or an assay that detects both toxins A and B.",

Also, organisms that produce neither toxin A nor B are common in the environment and in stool specimens. Use of the Biosite Triage test requires that the laboratory have a second assay to interpret toxin A-negative, common-antigen-positive results.

Laboratories that use an assay that detects toxin A alone risk misdiagnosis of individual cases or even outbreaks of CDAD. Laboratories can significantly reduce their C. d@cile testing workload by instituting a policy of no repeat testing within 7 days of a previous test. However, flexibility is needed in enforcing this policy to allow repeat testing after consultation with the patient's physician in cases of high suspicion when the initial test result is negative. Testing asymptomatic individuals provides no useful clinical data and should not be used to identify carriers for purposes of infection control or treatment to eliminate the carrier state.",
