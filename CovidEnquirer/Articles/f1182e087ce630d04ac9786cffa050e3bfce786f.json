During 1991 a stratified sampling of breeding herds was conducted to establish prevalence to PRCV or Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGEV) infections in Catalunya (northeast Spain). An antibodycapture ELISA was used for PRCV-and/or TGEV-antibodies, while a competitive inhibition ELISA tested for TGEV-specific antibodies. This study revealed 91.1% positive sera and 96.7% positive farms to PRCV and/or TGEV with a gradual increase in prevalence during 1991, which was more noticeable in small herds. Of the total 569 herds tested, 65.2% were positive only to PRCV, 8.6% were positive to TGEV and 22.8% had mixed infections. The first appearance of antibodies coincided with large importation of feeder pigs from Belgium and Holland. This prevalence is much higher than previously reported in other regions of Spain.",

The TGE-like virus isolate was designated TGE-like mutant (TLM-83) and named Porcine Respiratory Coronavirus (PRCV). Antibodies induced by this virus were identical to those of TGEV by a serum neutralization test, which resulted in interference with serological diagnosis of TGE.",

In order to determine the first appearance of PRCV-antibodies in this region, a retrospective survey using 544 sera was made from 8-week-old male pigs. The samples were obtained from seven herds located in Catalunya betweem May 1985 and July 1989, with the purpose of testing animals against several pathologies according to a breeding animals selection. Most of these sera (424 samples) were obtained from a performance-testing station between 1985 and 1986. This farm was considered to be a good sentinel for PRCV-infection since it periodically introduced pigs from other herds from around the entire region. Serum samples were only collected during the first week of quarantine previous to recording production in the test-station. Between 1987 and 1989 40 samples were collected from the same performance-testing station and also 80 samples were collected from six other farms with the same objective, this completed the samples for the retrospective survey. Each pig was sampled only once.",

From this date until December 1986, 64 positive sera were detected in the performance-testing station. None of these samples were positive to TGEVantibodies by competitive inhibition ELISA. The distribution of negative and positive samples in relation to date of collection is shown in Fig. 1 . The survey of 120 sera from the other six high-health herds showed seropositive animals continuously from 1987 to July 1989 (Fig. 2) .",

The high percentage of positive animals (91.1%), as well as positive farms (96.7%), indicate the extensive spread of PRCV-and/or TGEV-infection in different types of herds. Some of these sera were specifically positive to TGEV using the differential ELISA. They were also probably positive to PRCV, although this could not be assessed because a method to detect and differentiate specific antibodies to each of these two infections in the same sample was not available. With these data we can conclude that PRCV-prevalence in Catalunya was between 75% and 91% in 1991. This high prevalence is similar to those described in several European countries (Jestin et al., 1987; Bereiter et al., 1988) , which reported high percentages of TGEV-antibodies by the serum neutralization test without an apparent increase in clinical cases of TGE.",

We also found that the prevalence significantly decreased with decreased herd size. These results agree with data reported in similar studies (Henningsen et al., 1988; Brown and Paton, 1991 ) , which showed a faster spread in large industrial herds than in family farms. The different prevalence according to farm size could be explained by the fact that large farms often imported sows, increasing the risk of introducing carrier animals. In contrast, the smallest family herds usually obtained replacement sows from their own herd, and only exceptionally from large breeding farms nearby.",
