This pilot evaluation compared performance characteristics of the RT-PCR and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (RT-PCR/ESI-MS) platform to conventional virologic methods for identifying multiple clinically relevant respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal aspirates. The RT-PCR/ESI-MS respiratory virus surveillance kit was designed to detect respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza types 1-4, adenoviridae types A-F, coronaviridae, human bocavirus, and human metapneumovirus. Patients (N = 192) attending an emergency department during the 2007-2008 respiratory season consented, and \"excess\" frozen archived nasopharyngeal aspirates were analysed; 46 were positive by conventional virology and 69 by RT-PCR/ESI-MS, among which there were six samples with multiple viral pathogens detected. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay were 89.1% and 80.3%, respectively. Additional viruses that were not identified by conventional virology assays were detected (4 human bocaviruses and 7 coronaviruses). Samples in which the RT-PCR/ESI-MS results disagreed with conventional virology were sent for analysis by a third method using a commercial RT-PCR-based assay, which can identify viruses not detectable by conventional virologic procedures. Time to first result of RT-PCR/ESI-MS was 8 h. RT-PCR/ESI-MS demonstrated capacity to detect respiratory viruses identifiable and unidentifiable by conventional methods rapidly.",

Many clinical virology laboratories still rely on labour intensive or time-consuming diagnostic algorithms which incorporate antigen or culture-based methods (Mahony, 2008) . Molecular diagnostic assays hold great potential to impact infectious disease diagnosis and clinical management, particularly for viral infections, where conventional methods (i.e. antigen and culture based methods) do not provide timely or highly accurate results (Ratcliff et al., 2007) . While many rapid nucleic acid amplification tests have been developed to identify individual virus (Liolios et al., 2001) , the utility of molecular diagnostics in clinical settings may best be realized by single system diagnostic platforms that can simultaneously detect multiple pathogens (Liao et al., 2009; Pabbaraju et al., 2008; Raymond et al., 2009; Wu and Tang, 2009) .",

Eligible patients were identified by dedicated study coordinators by the daily review of nasopharyngeal aspirate testing order lists from the emergency department, and sought informed consent (in person, for those who were still in the hospital, or by telephone, for those who were already discharged either from the emergency department or the inpatient setting). There were at least three separate attempts in different periods of different days to attempt contact and informed consent for potentially eligible subjects, which resulted in 30% participation rate.

Accurate mass (61 ppm), high-resolution (M/dM 100,000 FWHM) mass spectra were acquired for each sample using high-throughput ESI-MS protocols (Sampath et al., 2007) . For each sample, approximately 1.5 L of analyte solution was consumed during the 74-s spectral acquisition. Raw mass spectra were post-calibrated with an internal mass standard and deconvolved to monoisotopic molecular masses. Unambiguous base compositions were derived from the exact mass measurements of the complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides. The detailed information of the software used to interrogate amplicon mass and viruses identification was described elsewhere . A calibrant consists of a specially designed nucleic acid sequence that similar to but distinguishable from any potential sequence were amplified in each well as the internal positive control. A negative control was implemented in each batch of processing with sterile viral transport media.",

The commonly used diagnostic methods in less well-equipped clinical virology laboratories are culture-based, which may take days to yield results, are labour-intensive and costly (Anzueto and Niederman, 2003) . Although some rapid antigen tests offer faster detection times for individual pathogen, clinical utility is limited, as the pathogenic agent is usually not known a priori, and these tests have sub-optimal sensitivity and specificity (Ginocchio, 2007) . As demonstrated in this study that the rapid antigen tests detected only small proportions of influenza and RSV in clinical specimens, the sub-optimal sensitivity restricts the wider utilization of these rapid tests in clinical settings.

Methods for evaluating the performance of novel assays, which are potentially more \"accurate\" than the current reference tests, remain controversial. Some researchers employ other similar assays (i.e. secondary PCR based assay) to confirm findings from the novel assays discordant with conventional culture or rapid antigen test (Liolios et al., 2001; Pabbaraju et al., 2008) , while others propose using adjunctive clinical data as reference (Doring et al., 2008) . Although this retrospective study design did not permit detailed clinical data collection for reference, the secondary analysis was performed using a secondary PCR assay. However, the secondary PCR assay itself is still not perfect in diagnosing every type of respiratory virus in clinical samples. As a result, two of four adenovirus detections, for which the Luminex assay had poor sensitivity to detect (Pabbaraju et al., 2008) , were not able to be confirmed in this study and may have underestimated the performance of RT-PCR/ESI-MS platform for adenoviruses.",

However, specimens from the clinical virology laboratory negative groups were found to contain significantly lower viral load in the RT-PCR/ESI-MS platform compared to the positive group (data not presented), which could be explained by the better sensitivity of the nucleic acid amplification tests (Mahony, 2008) . Further studies to confirm performance among patients with different demographic characteristics, are merited.",

            "text": "The current study has several important limitations. Although the optimal design to determine whether the candidate assay performs potentially better than the \"gold standard\" is to have a third confirmatory test done for every sample, the limited volume of the excess nasopharyngeal aspirate samples, precluded this type of detailed evaluation. Accordingly, readers should be cautioned to interpret results of the secondary analysis carefully, since they could be overestimating performance of the assay (Hadgu et al., 2005) . Because of the same reason, specimens with bocavirus detected by RT-PCR/ESI-MS could not be confirmed. Another limitation is that RT-PCR/ESI-MS testing on excess nasopharyngeal aspirate samples was performed several months after initial clinical samples were obtained and tested by clinical virology. Although the effect of length of storage of nasopharyngeal aspirates has been shown to be minimal within 2 months (Ward et al., 2004) , another study suggests nucleic acid degradation may be associated the \u221270 \u2022 C storage (Frisbie et al., 2004) , and the impact of longer periods of storage remains unknown. Furthermore, the majority of the study population was comprised of paediatric patients (<18 years of age), which limits generalizability of the findings to the adult population. Future validation of the performance of the RT-PCR/ESI-MS platform on adult population is necessary. Lastly, this Ibis T5000 respiratory virus surveillance II kit was not designed to detect rhinovirus, one of the most prevalent respiratory viruses. However, a modified respiratory virus surveillance kit is under development to include rhinovirus, the accuracy and reliability of this type of platform merits further studies using prospective clinical respiratory specimens.",

Detection of conventional viruses missed by the clinical virology algorithm, and unconventional viruses required additional confirmatory testing to further evaluate performance characteristics of this assay. The RT-PCR/ESI-MS method is a promising diagnostic platform for rapid identification of conventional and unconventional viruses and merits further prospective evaluation.",

Immunochromatographic assays were used in respiratory season as the sole screening test for RSV and influenza, which will stop the testing algorithm if results are positive. Respiratory panel cocktail DFA tests serve for adenovirus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza types 1-3 and RSV, which will stop the testing algorithm if results are positive in non-respiratory season or for those screened negative by immunochromatographic assays in respiratory season as well.
