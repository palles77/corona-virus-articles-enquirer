Crystal structures of human and bacterial FAN1 bound to a DNA flap have been solved. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacterial FAN1 and human FAN1 (hFAN1) missing a flexible loop are monomeric, while intact hFAN1 is homo-dimeric in structure. Importantly, the monomeric and dimeric forms of FAN1 exhibit very different DNA binding modes. Here, we interrogate the functional differences between monomeric and dimeric forms of FAN1 and provide an explanation for the discrepancy in oligomeric state between the two hFAN1 structures. Specifically, we show that the flexible loop in question is needed for hFAN1 dimerization. While monomeric and dimeric bacterial or human FAN1 proteins cleave a short 5\u2032 flap strand with similar efficiency, optimal cleavage of a long 5\u2032 flap strand is contingent upon protein dimerization. Our study therefore furnishes biochemical evidence for a role of hFAN1 homodimerization in biological processes that involve 5\u2032 DNA Flap cleavage.",

            "text": "Interstrand DNA crosslinks (ICLs) interfere with DNA replication and transcription. Failure to remove ICLs can induce cell cycle arrest, cell death, and genome instability. The Fanconi-associated nuclease 1 (FAN1) is a DNA structure-specific nuclease involved in ICL repair via interaction with FANCI-FANCD2 complex [1] [2] [3] [4] . FAN1 may also have a repair function that is independent of proteins in the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway of DNA damage response [5] . Importantly, FAN1 mutations are thought to lead to the renal disease Karyomegalic Interstitial Nephritis (KIN) [6] [7] [8] . FAN1 possesses both 5\u2032 flap endonuclease and 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 exonuclease activities [2, 3] . In cells, FAN1 functions in concert with or in parallel to other nucleases, including the endonucleases XPF-ERCC1, MUS81-EME1, SLX1 and the exonucleases SNM1A and SNM1B, to unhook ICLs [9] . SLX4 interacts with XPF-ERCC1, MUS81-EME1 and SLX1 and recruits these nucleases to DNA lesions [9] . It is important to note that FAN1 is structurally distinct from FEN1 (Flap endonuclease 1), which removes 5\u2032 RNA and DNA flaps during lagging strand DNA replication and long-patch base excision repair [10] .",

These structures provide insights into how FAN1 binds 5\u2032 flap DNA with a 1-nt overhang ( Fig. 1A and Fig. S1) . Surprisingly, the two available structures of the hFAN1 differ both in the oligomerization state (dimer vs monomer) and DNA-binding mode. The dimeric structure has an interface with DNA that spans both hFAN1 protomers [11] , while the monomeric hFAN1 structure largely resembles the crystal structure of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa FAN1 (PaFAN1) bound to DNA [12, 13] (Fig. 1A , right panel). It is unclear whether the two hFAN1 crystal structures capture physiologically relevant oligomeric states of this enzyme in different substrate engagement/cleavage modes.",

The results revealed that PaFAN1 and VvFAN1 both have robust activity on substrates with 1-nt or 5-nt overhang, but increasing the length of the overhang to 15-nt or 40-nt leads to a reduction in DNA incision by both proteins, but with monomeric PaFAN1 being affected to a significantly higher degree (Fig. 3B-E) .

Intriguingly, these structures also raised the question about the relevant oligomeric state of FAN1 in human cells. In the present study, we provide data to clarify the major difference between dimeric and monomeric forms of FAN1 and to advance our understanding of the biological function of FAN1. Specifically, given the very different modes of DNA binding in the two hFAN1 structures, we predicted that a difference should manifest in DNA cleavage as well. Through testing a series of 5\u2032 flap DNA substrates, we found that as the ssDNA overhang length increases, the efficiency of cleavage by FAN1 is reduced and that this reduction is significantly more dramatic for the monomeric form of hFAN1 (Fig. 4A) . To ascribe this activity difference to the oligomeric status difference of the protein, we also examined bacterial FAN1 orthologs that are either dimeric or monomeric. Importantly, by comparing the dimeric VvFAN1 and the monomeric PaFAN1 in the same nuclease tests, we have provided further evidence that the oligomeric status of FAN1 determines its efficiency in cleaving a long ssDNA flap strand.",

Our crystal structures of dimeric hFAN1 have provided evidence for \"scanning\", \"latching\" and \"unwinding\" modes of DNA engagement stemming from the concerted effort of two FAN1 protomers [11] (Fig. 4B) . We note that the VRR-nuc domains form a dimeric structure that can cleave the Holliday Junction in a symmetric fashion, but due to the insertion of a helix in the VRRnuc domain of FAN1, the inherent dimerization property becomes impaired [14] . In this regard, certain FAN1 orthologs, particularly the human and Vibrio enzymes, have evolved another surface for protein dimerization where the SAP domain of one protomer associates with the VRR-nuc domain of a second protomer to generate an asymmetric dimer. This asymmetry underlies the ability of hFAN1 to cleave a long 5\u2032 flap strand. Thus, protein dimerization likely imparts plasticity to hFAN1 in the processing of damaged replication forks.",
