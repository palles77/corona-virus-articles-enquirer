In this study, we investigated the effects of Xijiao Dihuang Decoction combined with Yinqiao Powder (XDY) on influenza virus (IV)-induced F-actin restructuring and ERM phosphorylation regulated by the Rho/Rho kinase 1 (ROCK), p38 MAPK, and PKC signaling pathways in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs). Methods: Serum containing XDY (XDY-CS; 13.8 g/kg) was acquired using standard protocols for serum pharmacology. Primary PMVECs were obtained from male Wistar rats and cultured. After adsorption of IV A (multiplicity of infection, 0.01) for 1 h, medium with 20% XDY-CS was added to the PMVECs. The distributions of F-actin and phosphorylated ERM were determined by confocal microscopy, and F-actin expression was measured by flow cytometry.

            "text": "Influenza virus (IV) is a prevalent virus that causes respiratory diseases worldwide. Seasonal viruses spreading among the human population cause annual epidemics that lead to approximately 500 000 deaths per year. One of the major health complications of IV is viral pneumonia, which can result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 1 In the acute phase of ARDS, symptoms are characterized by cyanosis, hypoxemia, pulmonary edema, and respiratory failure, which may ultimately lead to multiple organ failure and a low survival rate. 2 Respiratory failure in the acute phase of ARDS can be attributed to damage to the epithelial-endothelial barriers of pulmonary alveoli, where gas exchange takes place. 3, 4 Damage to these barriers leads to the flooding of proteinaceous edema fluid containing fibrin, erythrocytes, and inflammatory cells into the alveolar lumen. Although the pathogenesis of ARDS is only partially understood, it is thought that the key determinants of ARDS are endothelial barrier dysfunction and subsequent pulmonary microvascular endothelial leakage. Clinical analysis showed that mortality remains high among patients with severe influenza despite the use of anti-viral therapeutic strategies, which suggests that microvascular leakage may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of viral infections. 5 Xijiao Dihuang Decoction combined with Yinqiao Powder (XDY) is a classic compound formula originally prescribed by Jutong Wu, an ancient Chinese physician from the Qing Dynasty. XDY can clear heat, remove toxins, cool blood, stop bleeding, and promote blood circulation. 6 Results from a clinical study indicated that modified Yinqiao Powder could ameliorate symptoms and shorten the duration of fever caused by H1N1 IV. 7 Xijiao Dihuang Decoction, currently referred to as Qingre Dihuang Decoction, has been evaluated as a treatment for blood-heat syndrome in modern studies. Xijiao Dihuang Decoction was beneficial in treating syndromes where toxins intrude into the blood, a phenomenon that occurs in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 8 For example, modified Xijiao Dihuang Decoction was used to treat fire-toxin syndrome caused by viral pneumonia by virtue of its abilities for clearing heat, cooling blood, nourishing yin, and dispelling phlegm. 9 In previous studies, we showed that XDY treatment clearly reduced the mortality rate, decreased pulmonary permeability, and alleviated pulmonary edema in mice with viral pneumonia. 10 The results from in vitro studies demonstrated that XDY could protect the endothelial barrier by reversing permeability increases in PMVECs caused by IV infection. 11 However, the mechanisms by which XDY mitigates hyper-permeability in IV-infected PMVECs requires further investigation.",

Next, 25 of the 1-mm 3 lung pieces were placed in 1% gelatin-coated T25 cell flasks. The flasks were inverted and placed in an incubator (37 C, 5% CO 2 ) for 2 h, after which the flasks were stood upright and 1 mL of medium was added to each flask. The medium comprised M199 supplemented with 20% FBS, ECGS (100 mg/mL), and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution. After a 60-h incubation, the tissues were abandoned, and 5 mL medium was added to individual T25 flasks. At approximately 90% confluence, the PMVECs were detached using 0.25% trypsin/0.02% EDTA and subcultured into new T25 flasks. PMVECs were identified according to morphological and functional criteria, and confluent PMVECs from the first 3 passages were used for experiments conducted with 3 groups.

F-actin rearrangement leads to stress fiber formation, the stretching of which in turn contributes to paracellular gap formation and eventually to permeability increases. 20 ERM-family proteins are crucial in regulating cell structures and functions. They serve as linkers between the plasma membrane and the actin cytoskeleton via N-terminal binding to membrane-adhesion molecules and C-terminal binding to actin. A conserved threonine residue is found in their respective C-terminal regions, namely T567 in ezrin, T564 in radixin, and T558 in moesin. An important mechanism of ERM-family regulation occurs through phosphorylation of their respective conserved threonine residues. 21 Phosphorylation of the conserved threonine residue causes conformational changes in ERM, which unmasks binding sites for effector proteins. 22 Rho kinase, p38 MAPK, and PKC are 3 kinases that are thought to phosphorylate ERM proteins. Previous studies have also provided evidence that these kinases modulate endothelial cell permeability. 21, 22 Various stimuli can promote ERM phosphorylation in endothelial cells. The p-ERM protein mainly localizes to the border of PMVECs, where it can link cytoskeletal and membrane elements, leading to the formation of stress fibers and paracellular gaps, eventually contributing to permeability increases. Previously, it was reported that ERM phosphorylation induced by TNF-a may trigger permeability increases in human PMVECs via the p38 MAPK and PKC pathways. 20 Previous findings also showed that thrombin 23 and 2-methoxyestradiol 24 can mediate endothelial permeability increases by ERM phosphorylation via the PKC pathway. ERM protein phosphorylation via the p38 MAPK and Rho/ROCK pathways can also participate in modulating endothelial permeability induced by advanced glycation end products. 25 Previously, we showed that IV infection increased microvascular leakage in PMVECs, with the primary mechanism being related to activation of the Rho/ROCK, p38 MAPK, and PKC pathways, ultimately leading to ERM phosphorylation. 11 XDY is a classic traditional medicine that is used for treating viral pneumonia induced by IV infection. Previously, we showed that XDY administration reduced mortality rates in mice with viral pneumonia. 10 Results from this prior study demonstrated that XDY reduced virusinduced permeability increases, as well as pulmonary inflammation and vascular injuries induced by IV. In addition, it was confirmed that a dosage of 13.8 g/kg (equivalent to the clinical dosage) was the most effective. Therefore, to gain insight into the mechanism whereby XDY protects the vascular endothelium, we studied the effects of XDY-SC in mice at a clinical-dose equivalent on F-actin and ERM-related pathways in IV-infected PMVECs.",

            "text": "Interestingly, the cytoskeletal changes observed were not solely linked with the hyperpermeability of PMVECs, but were also related to virus replication. Actin polymerization is augmented in IV-infected cells, which is accompanied by activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK and PKC pathways, as well as calcium and phospholipase C production. 28e30 F-actin rearrangement can facilitate viral transportation into the nucleus via gene regulation or activation of the F-actin transportation system in the cytoplasm. 26 Although we did not observe that XDY inhibited viral replication in IVinfected PMVECs (data not shown), which might have been due to the interference of serum with virus replication in vitro, we did detect the reduction of viral titers in lung tissue of IV-infected mice. Because F-actin rearrangement is involved in IV replication, the ability of XDY to inhibit IV replication in vivo might be due to its capacity to reverse IV-induced F-actin reorganization. However, whether XDY inhibits IV replication by interfering with ERM phosphorylation remains unclear, since the role of ERM phosphorylation in IV replication remains uncertain, which merits further investigation.",
