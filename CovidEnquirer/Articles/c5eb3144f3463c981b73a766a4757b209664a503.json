In 1-week-old mice, mortality and mean time to death were mostly the same regardless of the inoculation route, except for the oral route, which appeared to be the least effective. The virus killed 4-week-old mice readily by all routes of inoculation except the oral, and 8-weekold mice by i.c., i.n. or s.c. inoculation. In descending order of efficacy, the routes of HEV infection were: i.c., i.n., s.c., i.p., i.v. and oral. To follow the spread of HEV from peripheral nerves to the central nervous system (CNS), the virus was inoculated subcutaneously into the right hind leg of 4-week-old mice. The virus was first detected in the spinal cord on day 2, and in the brain on day 3. The brain titres became higher than those of the spinal cord, reaching a maximum of 10 7 PFU/0.2 g when the animals were showing CNS signs. Viral antigen was first detected immunohistochemically in the lumbar spinal cord and the dorsal root ganglion ipsilateral to the inoculated leg; it was detected later in the pyramidal cells of the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, and in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum but not in the ependymal cells, choroid plexus cells or other glial cells. The infected neurons showed no cytopathological changes. q",

            "text": "Haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV), a coronavirus, causes vomiting and wasting disease, and encephalomyelitis in piglets (Andries and Pensaert, 1980a,b; Siddell et al., 1983) . Greig and Girard (1963) isolated the virus from the brains of sucking pigs with encephalomyelitis. The disease was produced experimentally in piglets by oronasal inoculation (Alexander, 1962) . In England, Cartwright et al. (1969) reported the isolation of an antigenically similar virus from sucking pigs showing anorexia, depression and vomiting, without encephalomyelitis. In America, Mengeling and Cutlip (1976) demonstrated that both major clinical forms of the disease (vomiting and wasting, and encephalitis) were reproduced by inoculation with the same field isolate from pigs. Yagami et al. (1986) produced fatal encephalitis in mice aged 35 days by the intracerebral (i.c.) inoculation of mouse-passaged HEV (strain 67N), but mice aged 20 or more days were resistant, even to large doses, when the virus was administered by the intranasal (i.n.), intraperitoneal (i.p.) or subcutaneous (s.c.) route. Hirano et al. (1990) reported successful propagation and plaque assay of HEV 67N in cultures of the established cell line, SK-K. Rats aged 1, 2, 4 or 8 weeks were subsequently inoculated with SK-K-grown virus by Hirano et al. (2001a) in an experiment in which the routes of infection, in descending order of efficacy, were i.c., i.n., s.c., i.p., i.v. and oral. Rats aged 1 or 2 weeks were generally similar in terms of mortality and mean time to death, regardless of inoculation route, except for the oral route. Eight-week-old rats inoculated by the i.c., i.n. or s.c. route died, but those inoculated by other routes survived. In rats inoculated by the i.c. route, HEV antigen was found in the pyramidal cells of the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, and later in the large-sized neurons of the pons and spinal cord and in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, but not in the ependymal cells, choroid plexus cells or other glial cells of the central nervous system (CNS).",

The results were largely similar to those obtained in rats of different ages by various routes of inoculation (Hirano et al., 2001a) . Following s.c. inoculation into the hind leg, the virus was first recovered from the spinal cord and later from the brain. HEV antigen was first detected immunohistochemically in the lumbar spinal cord and lumbar DRG ipsilateral to the inoculated leg and later in pyramidal cells of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. In the cortex, antigen-positive neurons were distributed in the cell layers III and V. HEV antigen was detected mainly in neurons, but not in ependymal cells, choroid plexus cells or other glial cells. These findings were similar to those in previous studies of rats inoculated by the s.c. route (Hirano et al., 1998) , suggesting that the virus spreads trans-synaptically along the neuronal pathways from the peripheral nerves to the CNS. Recent immunohistochemical studies (unpublished) in which CNS sections from HEV-infected rats and mice were double-or triple-labelled with antibodies to HEV, glial fibrillary acidic protein (for astrocytes) and TB4 antibody (for microglial cells) confirmed that HEV does not infect glial cells.",

There are, however, differences in the neurotropic properties of these viruses. Rabies virus infects predominantly neurons, such as pyramidal cells in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex and Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, but not glial cells; cytolytic and inflammatory reactions in the CNS do not occur in mice inoculated in the hind leg (Johnson, 1965) . PRV (Rinaman et al., 1993) , and BDV (Carbone et al., 1989) , however, infect not only neurons but also glial cells. PRV causes cytolytic damage in the CNS (Rinaman et al., 1993; Sur et al., 1995) . BDV produces severe inflammation in the CNS (Hirano et al., 1983; Carbone et al., 1989) . In contrast, the brains of rats infected with HEV by the s.c. (Hirano et al., 1998) , i.c. (Hirano et al., 2001a) , or i.n. route (Hirano et al., 2001b) showed no distinct neuronal changes of inflammatory reactions. It was recently found (unpublished observation) that HEV spread in the regenerated axons but not in Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system after transection and suturing of the sciatic nerve of rats. The present study showed that HEV was strictly neurotropic but did not cause distinct pathological changes in the CNS, thus resembling rabies virus. HEV, being harmless for human beings, is handled more easily than rabies virus or HSV in the laboratory. It may prove valuable as a new trans-synaptic tracer for analysing neuroanatomical connections in the CNS of mice and rats.",
