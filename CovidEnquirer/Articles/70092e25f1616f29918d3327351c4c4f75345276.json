INTRODUCTION The fidelity of information flow in biological systems is essential. Cells are endowed with mecanisms which control accuracy at each stage of the molecular processes. Translational fidelity is situated at a level which can be considered optimal rather than maximal\" this is deduced from the fact that it is possible to increase the natural level by mutation (Ehrenberg et al., 1986) . However, some organisms have built into their system of regulation a compulsory level of translational error. Retroviruses are undisputed leaders of this expression mode (for recent reviews see Varmus, 1988; Hatfield and Oroszlan, 1990; Atkins et al., 1990) , but it has also been shown that cellular genes can require high translational error levels in order to be expressed (Craigen et al., 1985; Craigen and Caskey, 1986; Tsuchihashi and Kornberg, 1990) .",

The test is based on the following principle: a stop codon or a frameshift sequence is introduced into the coding frame of a reoorter gene. According to the mutation introduced, translational errors can lead to readthrough of a stop codon or frameshift, and an active peptide is thereby synthesised. Such systems have already been described but failed to exhibit a sensitivity level RSV = Rous sarcoma virus. compatible with detection of background errors in mammalian cells (Martin et al., 1989) . As a reporter, we chose the luc gene from Photinuspyralis, since the luciferase assay is the most sensitive for any reporter gene in current use (Schwartz et al., 1990; Williams et al., 1989) . With this system, we have been able to measure levels of translational errors as low as 10-5. We have also tested the effect of two antibiotics known to affect translational accuracy: paromomycin (Wilhem et al., 1978; Burke and Mogg, 1985) and kasugamycin (van Bull et al., 1974) .",

CM5a cells, of an opal suppressor-free strain (Camonis et ai., 1990) , were transformed with the different plasmids and luciferase-specific activities were determined in crude extracts. Results are expressed as the ratio of specific activities obtained with the different vectors compared to pRSVL (table II) . Strain CDJ64, harbouring an opal suppressor tRNA with a tryptophan insertion at the UGA codon, was also transformed with pRSVL74. The luciferase activity found in this strain was 30-fold higher than the basal readthrough, but even with the suppressor-free strain CM5g, significant enzyme activities were obtained with all the mutations (table II). The efficiency of readthrough of the opal codon in pRSVL74 was about 10-fold weaker than that of frameshifting with pRSVL121. Many results obtained in E. coli have shown that codon context can affect up to 100-fold the efficiency of readthrough (Ehrenberg et al., 1986; Bossi, 1983; Miller and Albertini, 1983) . The difference between pRSVL74 and the other constructions may thus be due to an unfavourable particular codon context.",

Up to now, all tests to study the HIV gag-pol region responsible for the frameshift have been performed either in vivo in yeast or through in vitro translation of synthetic RNA in reticulocyte lysates (Jacks et aL, 1988; Wilson et aL, 1988) . With these systems, the frameshift level approached the natural one. l ne vectors uescrloeu here are me Hrst allowing in vivo experiments in mammalian cells. As compared to pRSVL90, used as a control, the frameshifting efficiency of this short HIV sequence was found to be weaker (2.5 \u00d7 10-3) than the pol/gag ratio usually observed in retrovirus-infected cells (Weiss et aL, 1982) . The proximity of the translation initiation codon to the slippery site could decrease the level of frameshift. In yeast, + 1 frameshift at the TYA/TYB overlap is inhibited by the proximity (5 codons) of the AUG (Clare et aL, 1988; Belcour and Farabaught, 1990) ; however, no such effect has been observed in E. coli for the HIV frameshift sequence (5 codons) (Weiss et al., 1989) . In the case of pRSVL89, the shifty sequence is located 9 codons downstream of the AUG. Alternatively, abortive translation can result in a decrease in mRNA stability\" it has been shown that a stop-codon-containing message can be very unstable in mammalian cells (Lim et al., 1989) . Insertion upstream of the mutated luc gene of a sequence whose translation product can be quantified would make it possible to estimate mRNA degradation and the number of ribosomes that shift compared to the number of translating ribosomes, and to move the slippery site away from the AUG. Such constructions are under way.",
