            "text": "Recirculating ventilation systems may act as carriers of hazardous substances. The long-term prediction of the dynamic distribution of contaminants in this type of system is crucial for the evaluation of pollution and further design of more efficient ventilation systems. However, few convenient methods can predict the dynamic distribution of contaminants, because the dynamic supply air concentrations resulting from air recirculation are unknown, especially over long time periods, such as months or years. In this study, a novel method is proposed to predict the dynamic distribution of contaminants over a long time period in a complex recirculating ventilation system, where an algebraic expression based on the indices of the response coefficient is applied to account for the relationship between the contaminant distribution inside the room and various boundary conditions. The method is established by obtaining comprehensive mathematical descriptions of the relationships between concentrations of contaminants in the air handling units, supply air inlets, return air outlets, and fresh air. Hourly supply air concentrations can be easily obtained by solving a matrix, and the dynamic distribution of contaminants is then calculated using an expression based on the response coefficient. The reliability of the proposed method is analyzed by both experimental and numerical methods. A simplified method is suggested to accelerate the time-consuming calculation of the response coefficient. The proposed method is beneficial for predicting three-dimensional dynamic distribution of contaminants in complex ventilation systems with an acceptable accuracy and time cost.",

However, in most buildings with central air conditioning and ventilating systems, a large portion of old indoor air is recirculated to the air handling unit (AHU) to save energy [11e13] . The ventilation systems in these situations, therefore, act as carriers of hazardous substances [14] . The contaminants released in one room may be transported with return air into neighboring rooms or even distant rooms through the ventilation system, causing widespread exposure to a hazardous environment. Therefore, accurately predicting the dynamic distribution of contaminants in buildings with complex ventilation systems that utilize air recirculation during long time periods, such as months and years, can contribute to the overall evaluation of the exposure level of occupants to pollution, and inform the future design of more efficient ventilation systems.",

Most of the existing work related to CFD has focused on one room, where all of the boundary conditions are known. However, in many actual buildings, different rooms are always connected with each other through ventilation systems that recirculate air.

For a specific condition of contaminant release, the concentration of the contaminant at an arbitrary position in the room is uniform for ideal mixing ventilation; however, the concentrations of the contaminant at different indoor positions and in return air or exhaust air outlets are actually different for different airflow . Therefore, the exposure levels in local areas of rooms (especially the occupied zones) cannot be predicted and evaluated by the multizone model. Some prediction methods have been proposed for the distribution of contaminants in recirculating ventilation system. Waters and Simon [40] presented a method to consider the effect of air recirculation in a ventilated space; however, it can only be utilized in a simple case. Li et al. [24, 41] defined a general ventilation system covering all-air system with air recirculation, a fan coil unit (FCU), a room air conditioner (RAC), an air cleaner system, etc., and proposed two methods to predict the age of air and the contaminant distribution, respectively, in complex ventilation systems with air recirculation. Both methods are focused on the steady state and cannot be used for unsteady prediction. Hiyama et al. [42] proposed a method that predicts the transient contaminant distribution with air recirculation by coupling three-dimensional transient pollutant transport into a flow network model; however, this method is mainly used for predictions over a short period of time, like 1 h, and is not suitable for a long period of time because of the limited computing time.",

CO 2 was selected as the contaminant and released into supply air duct at a controlled constant rate of 25 L/min to create a constant CO 2 concentration in supply air. Nine CO 2 sensors (range 0e5000 ppm; accuracy \u00b13%) were arranged in the chamber (No.2e10) to record the transient concentration variation at different positions, as shown in Fig. 4 . An extra sensor (No.1) was used to monitor the background CO 2 concentration. During the release of CO 2 from supply air inlet, there was no CO 2 source in the chamber. CO 2 was continuously released for 3000 s; however, the total duration of measurement was 4530 s. STACHe3, a well-validated CFD program, was used as the simulation tool for the RC index and the concentration of the contaminant [44] . An indoor zero-equation turbulence model was used to account for the turbulent flow in the room [45] . The Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations, together with mass conservation equations, were discretized by a finite volume method (FVM). A power law scheme was used as the difference scheme. A SIMPLE algorithm was adopted while momentum equations were solved on non-uniform staggered grids [46] . After the flow field was obtained, the concentration of the passive gas was evaluated using the conventional transport equation for contaminants.",

Moreover, the transient concentrations at different positions have different variation characteristics because of the non-uniform distribution of indoor air parameters. Compared with the rapid rise of concentrations at positions close to the inlet (e.g., P9), the concentrations at positions close to the outlet (e.g., P6) change more slowly; therefore, no significant rise of the measured concentration occurred in the first few seconds because of the delayed response of the sensors. Although a certain discrepancy in CO 2 concentration existed, no large discrepancy was observed for most of the positions.

The demonstration case in this section helped to reveal the reliability of the adopted time steps when considering the influence of the concentration in the return and supply air, which was the key characteristic of the recirculating ventilation system. Fresh air ratio of AHU 1 and AHU 2 were set as 10% and 85%, respectively (Fig. 8) .

Therefore, the variation of supply air concentration could be captured when a time step smaller than 1 h was adopted in the calculation of RC.

From the second hour the predicted concentrations with and without considering the time delay were close to each other. From the view point of long-time period prediction, a low effect might be caused by neglecting the time delay in the air ducts. As the predictions with time steps of 10 min and 1 h were almost the same, as illustrated in Fig. 13 , the overall discrepancy in the prediction based on the time step of 1 h without considering the time delay and the prediction based on the time step of 10 min with consideration of the time delay was believed to be small, indicating an acceptable reliability of prediction. Furthermore, the time delay of up to 700 s (11.7 min) was designed for air ducts in the demonstration case; therefore, a certain effect on the prediction was observed if the time delay was neglected. However, for conventional building ventilation systems, the magnitude of the time delay in the air ducts is always tens of seconds or a few minutes, which is much less than the set time in the study Thus, a smaller effect on the prediction is expected to be observed when the time delay in the air ducts is neglected. This alternative method can be used to determine the prediction based on the time step of 1 h when the actual structure of the air ducts is complex, and there is a heavy workload in calculating the time delay in each air duct.",

The method is established by mathematical descriptions of the relationships between supply air concentrations in GAHUs and in inlets, return air concentration in outlets and in GAHUs, and fresh air concentrations in the total ventilation systems. Hourly supply air concentrations in the GAHUs can be easily obtained by solving a matrix, and the dynamic distribution of contaminant is then quickly calculated with an expression based on the response coefficient.
