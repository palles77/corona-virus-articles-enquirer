In the current study, the RNA structure downstream from the slippery site of cocksfoot mottle sobemovirus (CfMV) was proven to be a 12 bp stem-loop with a single bulge and a tetranucleotide loop. Several deletion and insertion mutants with altered stem-loop structures were tested in wheat germ extract (WGE) for frameshifting efficiency. The impact of the same mutations on virus infectivity was tested in oat plants. Mutations shortening or destabilizing the stem region reduced significantly but did not abolish \u22121 PRF in WGE. The same mutations proved to be deleterious for virus infection. However, extending the loop region to seven nucleotides had no significant effect on frameshifting efficiency in WGE and did not hamper virus replication in infected leaves. This is the first report about the experimentally proven RNA secondary structure directing \u22121 PRF of sobemoviruses.",

            "text": "Many positive strand RNA viruses use \u22121 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (\u22121 PRF) for regulating the expression of viral polymerases. Two cis-acting elements are required for an efficient \u22121 PRF. First, a seven nucleotide slippery sequence is the place where the ribosome will slip back by one nucleotide. The sequence motif for the slip-site is X XXY YYZ (preframeshift codons are indicated), where X can be any nucleotide, Y either A or U, and Z can be any nucleotide except G (Brierley et al., 1992) . Secondly, the shifty heptanucleotide is followed by the sequence that is forming a downstream secondary structure. The investigated downstream stimulatory elements can be divided into three groups. The best studied group includes hairpin-type RNA pseudoknot structures formed when the nucleotides of hairpin loop base pair with singlestranded downstream complementary nucleotides (reviewed by Giedroc and Cornish, 2008) . The second group of structures consists of pseudoknots having an unusual structure. For example, a threestemmed pseudoknot structure has been reported for Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Baranov et al., 2005; Brierley and Dos Ramos, 2006; Plant et al., 2005; Su et al., 2005) . This structure is composed of two double-stranded stems connected by a single-stranded loop and a second loop which itself folds into a stem-loop. The stimulatory RNA of the Visna-Maedi virus \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting signal is another unusual pseudoknot with a seven nucleotide interstem element between two stems (Pennell et al., 2008) . The third group includes stable stem-loop structures sufficient to promote efficient \u22121 PRF. Examples include the frameshift-promoting elements at the gag-pol junction in Giardia lamblia virus (GLV), Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and related lentiviruses (Brierley and Dos Ramos, 2006; Li et al., 2001; Marcheschi et al., 2007; Staple and Butcher, 2005) . The requirement for a simple hairpin loop in frameshifting has been also demonstrated in Human astrovirus serotype-1 (HAst-1), Human T-cell leukemia virus type II (HTLV-II) and Red clover necrotic mosaic virus RNA-1 (RCNMV) (Falk et al., 1993; Lommel, 1994, 1998; Marczinke et al., 1994) .",

The polyprotein of CfMV encodes a viral protease, VPg and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). It is translated from two overlapping open reading frames, ORF 2a and 2b, by a \u22121 PRF mechanism (M\u00e4kinen et al., 1995a) (Fig. 1) . The consensus signals for \u22121 PRF were identified at the beginning of the overlap region: the slippery sequence U UUA AAC (nucleotides 1634-1640, preframeshift codons are indicated) and a predicted stem-loop structure (nucleotides 1648-1676) starting seven nucleotides downstream. Both mutating the heptanucleotide sequence and deleting the putative secondary structure were shown to completely abolish the frameshifting activity, indicating that these cis-acting elements are absolutely required for \u22121 PRF to proceed (Lucchesi et al., 2000) . The minimal frameshift sequence required for efficient in vitro frameshifting was mapped at the nucleotides 1621-1690 (Lucchesi et al., 2000) (Fig. 1 ). This 70 nucleotide sequence, containing both the slippery sequence and the predicted downstream secondary structure, was shown to direct \u22121 PRF in wheat germ extract (WGE) with an efficiency of 12.7 \u00b1 1.4%. Similar in vitro frameshifting efficiency, 10.6 \u00b1 1.4%, was determined for the entire ORF2a-2b encoding region (Lucchesi et al., 2000; Tamm et al., 1999) .",

The CfMV polyprotein encoding construct pAB-21 and individual mutants were analyzed for their ability to promote \u22121 frameshifting in vitro in WGE system (Fig. 3B) . For pAB-21, the frameshifting efficiency in WGE was calculated to be 11.1 \u00b1 1.3% (Fig. 3C) , value similar to those seen in previous studies (Lucchesi et al., 2000; Tamm et al., 1999) . Based on the structure mapping data, stem 1 of the stem-loop structure contains 6-bp G-C/C-G double-stranded stretch. To test the necessity of this paired region in frameshifting, two variants of mutants were generated (Fig. 3A) . Firstly, the nucleotide on one side of the second GC-pair was mutated to disrupt the base pairing. The substitution of G (1649) with uridine or C (1675) with adenosine, both resulted in twofold reduction (from 11.1 \u00b1 1.3% to 4.7 \u00b1 0.8% or 4.5 \u00b1 0.9%, respectively) of the frameshifting efficiency ( Fig. 3B and C) . Secondly, the second G-C base pair was replaced with the U-A base pair. The compensatory mutations (G1649 \u2192 U, C1675 \u2192 A) that should restore the base-paired structure of stem 1 did not restore wild type levels of frameshifting (efficiency 5.1 \u00b1 0.6%; Fig. 3B and C), demonstrating the necessity of an intact G-C/C-G-base-paired segment during \u22121 PRF.",

The results of the structure-probing experiments correlated with the previously predicted structure (M\u00e4kinen et al., 1995a) , as the spacer regions 1 and 2, the loop, and bulged C nucleotide were found highly accessible to alkylation by chemicals that modify singlestranded nucleotides (Fig. 2) . Up to now, 11 sobemovirus genomes have been fully sequenced. All sequenced sobemoviruses exhibit common genomic organization: the RdRp is encoded by ORF2b by the \u22121 PRF mechanism (McGavin and Macfarlane, 2009; Meier and Truve, 2007; S\u00e9r\u00e9m\u00e9 et al., 2008) . The analysis of their cis-acting \u22121 PRF signals indicate the presence of an identical UUUAAAC slippery sequence, a seven nucleotide spacer region 1 (exception is Ryegrass mottle virus where the spacer is 8 nucleotides long), and a putative stem-loop secondary structure (Fig. S1 ).

According to this model, the pseudoknot blocks the mRNA entrance channel and the ribosome becomes stalled during the translocation phase of the elongation cycle. The P-and A-sites of stopped ribosome must locate over the slippery heptameric sequence. Should the mutation extend the spacer region, the ribosome will pause downstream of the slippery sequence and the probability for it to slip back by 1 nucleotide is reduced. In most cases where \u22121 PRF is proposed or confirmed to occur, the distance between the slippery sequence and downstream RNA structure is 5-9 nucleotides (Giedroc et al., 2000) . The significance of the optimal spacer length has been systematically investigated using Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV)-derived frameshift signal (Kontos et al., 2001; Napthine et al., 1999) . The alteration of the 6-nt spacer as little as a single nucleotide either way reduced frameshifting efficiency in vitro indicating that the precise distance is important. The proposed \u22121 PRF model also indicates the importance of the strength of the downstream element. Based on published studies, most viral pseudoknots are G-C rich at the bottom of stem 1 (Giedroc et al., 2000) . Replacing G-C pair(s) with A-U pair(s) at the beginning of stem 1 of the IBV pseudoknot reduced the frameshifting efficiency several fold (Napthine et al., 1999) . As shown in Fig. 3 , the stem 1 of CfMV consists of six G-C/C-G pairs. The change of the second G-C pair with U-A pair reduced the CfMV in vitro frameshifting efficiency twofold. These results indicate that not only the formation of the stem with a certain length, but also the strength and stability of the formed structure are important features for inducing ribosomal frameshifting.",

            "text": "The structure prediction analysis of the sobemoviral frameshiftpromoting structures revealed that 8 out of 11 analyzed structures contain at least one bulged nucleotide after the G-C rich stem 1 region (Fig. S1 ). The structure of Mouse mammary tumour virus pseudoknot determined by NMR demonstrated that the bulged adenine is creating a hinge between the stems 1 and 2 and therefore direct coaxial stacking of the stems is not possible (Shen and Tinoco, 1995) . Instead, the pseudoknot stem 1 bends towards the major groove of stem 2 resulting in relieving the strain caused by the short loop 1. The presence of similar bent conformation has been shown for Beet western yellow virus (BWYV), Potato leaf roll virus (PLRV), Feline immunodeficiency virus and HIV-1 frameshift-inducing structures (Pallan et al., 2005; Staple and Butcher, 2005; Su et al., 1999; Yu et al., 2005) . The mutational analysis demonstrated that the deletion of this bulged nucleotide either causes slight reduction of the frameshifting efficiency in vitro in the case of BWYV, or even abolishes the frameshifting phenomenon as shown for the PLRV pseudoknot structure (Kim et al., 1999; Kim et al., 2000) . However, the structure of the Simian retrovirus type-1 (SRV-1) pseudoknot, determined by NMR, showed that in SRV-1 the stems 1 and 2 are stacked upon each other and for that reason the intercalated base at the junction is not needed for efficient frameshifting (Michiels et al., 2001) . The structure mapping data for the CfMV stem-loop structure indicates that the bulged C at position 1667 is accessible to modifiers (Fig. 2) . To study the importance of the potential bent conformation, C 1667 was deleted, or a single G was inserted into the opposite stem to promote the formation of G-C base pair. The in vitro measured frameshifting efficiencies revealed that the stem length is important, rather than the bending. The formation of a new G-C pair by inserting one extra G did not affect the frameshifting efficiency while the deletion of the bulged C only moderately reduced it (Fig. 3) . However, the deletion of bulged C in the CfMV cDNA clone abolished the viral replication in the infected leaves implicating the importance of the length of the stem region. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that the amino acid changes in P2a and RdRp introduced due to the mutagenesis may affect the in vivo function of these proteins.",

High resolution NMR studies have shown that they have a minimum requirement of two-pair stem to form a stable RNA hairpin (Abdelkafi et al., 1997; Molinaro and Tinoco, 1995) . Because of their high thermodynamic stability, it has been proposed that the UNCG family of hairpins can serve as a nucleation site for folding. The analysis of the sobemoviral frameshift structures indicates that the 5 -UNCG-3 tetraloop sequence present in CfMV is not conserved although the small size of the loop (usually four nucleotides) is very characteristic for these stem-loop structures (Fig. S1 ). Based on several evidences we ruled out the formation of a pseudoknot structure by the 5 -UACG-3 tetraloop. The results from our chemical probing experiments indicated that the loop at the end of stem 2 is completely exposed (Fig. 2 ). In addition, RNA structure prediction analysis with the algorithm capable of predicting pseudoknots (PknotsRG, Reeder et al., 2007) did not indicate the formation of a pseudoknot in the CfMV frameshift region, neither in those of the other sequenced sobemovirus genomes (data not shown). Finally, the construct containing the CfMV minimal frameshifting region (nucleotides 1621-1690) in the middle of the reporter gene had similar frameshifting efficiency to a construct encoding the CfMV polyprotein (Lucchesi et al., 2000) . Our results also demonstrate that the loop size is not important for efficient \u22121 PRF. The insertion of the three extra U nucleotides into the loop did not change the frameshifting efficiency in a cell free translation system (Fig. 3) and did not abolish the local as well as systemic infection of the virus (Fig. 4B) .",

We conclude that sobemoviruses cluster together with lentiviruses and few others (examples GLV, HAst-1, HTLV-II and RCNMV) to form an unique group of viruses that require stable stem-loops for frameshifting. Marcheschi et al. (2007) hypothesized that the nature of the RNA structure of the frameshift site is dependent upon the slippery sequence to which it is coupled. They argue that for HIV-1, HIV type 2 and SIV, stable stem-loops are sufficient to promote frameshifting because the UUUUUUA slippery site is more \"slippery\" than other XXXYYYZ sequences.",
