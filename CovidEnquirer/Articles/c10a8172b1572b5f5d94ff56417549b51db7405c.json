            "text": "Type III IFNs are the most recently discovered family of IFNs with antiviral properties. The human IFN lambda (IFNL or IFN\u03bb) locus is composed of IFNL1 (IL29), IFNL2 (IL28A), IFNL3 (IL28B), and IFNL4 genes located on chromosome 19 (Kotenko et al., 2003) . IFN\u03bbs signal through a heterodimeric receptor composed of IFN\u03bbR1 and IL-10R2 chains that activate the Jak-STAT pathway to induce IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and antiviral activity. Although the antiviral activities of type I and III IFNs are indistinguishable, the type I IFN receptor chains (IFN\u03b1R1 and IFN\u03b1R2) are nearly ubiquitously expressed, whereas IFN\u03bbR1 expression is limited to hepatocytes; epithelial cells of the lung, intestine, and skin; and cells of myeloid lineage (Kotenko et al., 2003; Sheppard et al., 2003; Kotenko, 2011) . IFN\u03bb-mediated immunity is essential to fight viral infections in the liver and at epithelial surfaces. Ifnlr1 \u2212/\u2212 mice show that IFN\u03bb activity is required for antiviral protection against respiratory viruses, including the influenza virus and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Mordstein et al., 2008 (Mordstein et al., , 2010 . In turn, human IFN\u03bb is the dominant IFN secreted by respiratory ep-ithelial cells in response to influenza virus infection (Jewell et al., 2010; Crotta et al., 2013) and is also produced by myeloid and lung epithelial cells during rhinovirus infection (Contoli et al., 2006) . Similar to the respiratory tract, epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract are predominantly responsive to IFN\u03bb (Mordstein et al., 2010; Pott et al., 2011) , which initiates antiviral signaling critical for control of pathogenic enteric viruses (Pott et al., 2011; Mahlak\u00f5iv et al., 2015; Nice et al., 2015) . Although these studies underscore the importance of IFN\u03bbs in antiviral immunity, the expression, regulation, and activities of the individual members of the IFNL family during viral infection remain poorly understood.",

            "text": "Genome-wide association studies identified IFNL as a strong susceptibility locus for both natural and treatmentinduced clearance of HCV Suppiah et al., 2009; Tanaka et al., 2009; Thomas et al., 2009; Rauch et al., 2010) . Two separate genetic variations in this locus were identified as functionally important for viral clearance (Prokunina-Olsson et al., 2013; McFarland et al., 2014) . Our group identified a 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) variant in IFNL3 that dictates the stability and expression of the IFNL3 mRNA (McFarland et al., 2014 ) and a subsequent study by Lu et al. (2015b) confirmed these findings. Meanwhile, another study revealed a dinucleotide variant (TT/\u0394G, rs368234815) in the IFNL4 gene that associates with HCV clearance (Prokun-Interferon (IFn) lambdas are critical antiviral effectors in hepatic and mucosal infections. Although IFn\u03bb1, IFn\u03bb2, and IFn\u03bb3 act antiviral, genetic association studies have shown that expression of the recently discovered IFnL4 is detrimental to hepatitis c virus (HcV) infection through a yet unknown mechanism. Intriguingly, human IFnL4 harbors a genetic variant that introduces a premature stop codon. We performed a molecular and biochemical characterization of IFn\u03bb4 to determine its role and regulation of expression. We found that IFn\u03bb4 exhibits similar antiviral activity to IFn\u03bb3 without negatively affecting antiviral IFn activity or cell survival. We show that humans deploy several mechanisms to limit expression of functional IFn\u03bb4 through noncoding splice variants and nonfunctional protein isoforms. Furthermore, protein-coding IFnL4 mrnA are not loaded onto polyribosomes and lack a strong polyadenylation signal, resulting in poor translation efficiency. this study provides mechanistic evidence that humans suppress IFn\u03bb4 expression, suggesting that immune function is dependent on other IFnL family members. IFN\u03bb4 suppression in viral infection | Hong et al. 2540 ina- Olsson et al., 2013) . A TT variant in the first exon of IFNL4 creates a premature stop codon, caused by a frameshift, rendering it a pseudogene (\u03c8IFNL4; Prokunina-Olsson et al., 2013) . Their study showed that a \u0394G in IFNL4 associates with HCV persistence, whereas a TT at the same location correlates with clearance. The study also reports that the \u0394G codes for a full-length, functional IFN\u03bb4p179 (179 aa) protein. Surprisingly, HCV persistence is strongly associated with expression of a functional IFNL4 gene, whereas the nonfunctional IFNL4 gene is associated with clearance. Although many studies have replicated the strong IFNL4 association with HCV clearance/persistence, the underlying mechanisms for this paradoxical observation remains unexplained (Aka et al., 2014; Meissner et al., 2014; Lu et al., 2015a,b; O'Brien et al., 2015; Peiffer et al., 2016) . Interestingly, the IFNL4 \u0394G allele is in strong linkage with the less favorable IFNL3 genotype at rs12979860 and rs4803217 (Lu et al., 2015b) , suggesting the possibility of an indirect effect of IFNL4 genotype on HCV persistence. Furthermore, several studies have failed to detect secretion of IFN\u03bb4 protein, prompting speculation on noncanonical activities of IFN\u03bb4, including an intracellular role (Booth and George, 2013; McBride, 2013; Prokunina-Olsson et al., 2013; Ray, 2013; Lu et al., 2015a) .",

Type III IFNs evolved from a common lineage with IL-10 family cytokines, many of which feature alternative receptor usage. Because IFNL4 shares this lineage and has low sequence identity with other type III IFNs (Prokunina-Olsson et al., 2013) , we examined if IFN\u03bb4 could also signal through a different IL-10 family receptor. We coexpressed the IFNL4 isoforms and IFNL3 together with a luciferase reporter downstream of an IFN stimulated response element (ISRE) in Huh7 wild-type and IFN LR1 \u2212/\u2212 cells. We expressed the IFNL4 isoforms and IFNL3 in Huh7 cells. Cell supernatants were then transferred to Huh7 wild-type and IFN LR1 \u2212/\u2212 cells expressing a luciferase reporter downstream of an ISRE. We found that expression of IFN\u03bb4p179, the only secreted isoform, and IFN\u03bb3 strongly induced ISRE luciferase reporter activity in wild-type Huh7 cells, whereas the nonsecreted IFN\u03bb4p107 and IFN\u03bb4p131 were inactive ( Fig. 1 F) . ISRE luciferase reporter activity was completely abrogated in IFN LR1 \u2212/\u2212 Huh7 cells, suggesting that IFN\u03bbR1 was necessary for ISG induction by IFN\u03bb4p179. To further test if IFN\u03bb4 signals through extracellular IL-10R2, we blocked the receptor using a neutralizing \u03b1IL-10R2 antibody and coexpressed IFN\u03bb4p179 or IFN\u03bb3 together with the ISRE luciferase reporter. IL-10R2 blockade decreased ISRE luciferase reporter activity for both IFN\u03bb4p179 and IFN\u03bb3 ( Fig. 1 G and Fig. S1 C) . Lastly, downstream signaling via MX1 induction was completely abrogated in IFN LR1 \u2212/\u2212 cells upon stimulation with IFN\u03bb4p179 ( Fig. 1 H) . These data not only confirm that IFN\u03bb4 requires both IFN\u03bbR1 and IL-10R2 chains, but also shows that it signals through this extracellular heterodimeric receptor complex.",

            "text": "As the majority of IFN\u03bb4 remain in the cytoplasm, including both functional and inactive isoforms, it has been proposed that intracellular IFN\u03bb4 regulates cell surface IFN\u03bbR1 by binding and sequestering IFN\u03bbR1 or IL-10R2 in the cytoplasm (Hamming et al., 2013; Prokunina-Olsson et al., 2013) . To quantify the effects of IFN\u03bb4 on receptor surface expression and consequent downstream signaling of other type III IFNs, we treated Huh7 cells overexpressing IFN\u03bb4 isoforms or an empty vector (EV) with recombinant human (rh) IFN\u03bb3 for 6 h, and we quantified ISG induction represented by MX1. We found that induction of MX1 by rhIFN\u03bb3 was unaltered in the presence of overexpressed IFN\u03bb4p107 or IFN\u03bb4p131 compared with EV transfection (Fig. 1 I) . Again, IFN\u03bb4p179 alone was able to induce MX1, and in this overexpression system it does so at similar levels compared with EV-transfected cells treated with 100 ng/ml rhIFN\u03bb3. To exclude that observed MX1 expression is due to the nontransfected fraction of cells not expressing IFNL4 isoforms, we cotransfected a GFP plasmid together with the IFN\u03bb4 overexpression constructs and sorted for GFP + cells right before IFN\u03bb3 stimulation for 9 h and qPCR analysis. Again, overexpression of IFN\u03bb4p107 and IFN\u03bb4p131 isoforms did not interfere with the cell's ability to respond to exogenous IFN\u03bb3 ( Fig. 1 J) . We performed the same stimulation with IFN\u03b2 and found that overexpression of intracellular IFN\u03bb4 isoforms does not affect type I IFN signaling ( Fig. 1 K) . These data show that IFN\u03bb4p179 has a similar ability to induce ISGs as rhIFN\u03bb3 and that IFN\u03bb4 isoforms do not interfere with type I or type III IFN-induced ISG responses intracellularly or extracellularly.",

This paradoxical association has led to the hypothesis that IFN\u03bb4 may have noncanonical functions, such as blockade of antiviral activity. To test this hypothesis, we overexpressed IFN\u03bb4 isoforms and IFN\u03bb3 in Huh7 cells and infected them with a Renillaluciferase tagged HCV reporter virus (Liu et al., 2011) . We observed that IFN\u03bb4p179 and IFN\u03bb3 mediated similar antiviral activity and comparably suppressed HCV replication, whereas the intracellular IFN\u03bb4p107 and IFN\u03bb4p131 isoforms were unable to block HCV replication ( Fig. 1 L) .

We cloned the IFNL4P179 open reading frame with a C-terminal 6xHistidine tag into a construct under control of a copper (II) ion-inducible metallothionein promoter and transfected the expression plasmid into S2 cells. Upon induction by copper (II) sulfate, rhIFN\u03bb4 was secreted into the supernatant, collected for affinity purification on a nickel column, and further isolated by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 2, A-C) . We compared the activities of rhIFN\u03bb3 and rhIFN\u03bb4 by quantifying MX1 induction as a functional read out in PH5CH8 hepatocytes. The induction pattern of MX1 over several logs of IFN\u03bb concentration yielded an EC 50 of 189.1 pM (3.801 ng/ml) for rhIFN\u03bb3 and an EC 50 of 577.0 pM (11.01 ng/ml) for rhIFN\u03bb4, leading to an EC 50 ratio of 3.051 (Fig. 2 D) . Intriguingly, the largest differences in activity were seen at lower concentrations of IFN\u03bb. These data suggest that IFN\u03bb3 exhibits activity that is marginally higher than that of IFN\u03bb4, although these differences are minimal compared with differences in activities between IFN\u03bb3 and IFN\u03bb2 (Dellgren et al., 2009) . We further tested the specificity for downstream STAT signaling in wild-type or IFN LR1 \u2212/\u2212 PH5CH8 cells (Fig. S2 ) stimulated with rhIFN\u03b2, rhIFN\u03bb3, or rhIFN\u03bb4 for 15 min (Fig. 2 E) . Treatment with rhIFN\u03b2, rhIFN\u03bb3, or rhIFN\u03bb4 induced phosphorylation of STAT1 (pSTAT1), which was completely abrogated in IFN LR1 \u2212/\u2212 cells, when stimulated with rhIFN\u03bb3 or rhIFN\u03bb4. To confirm downstream gene expression, we treated wild-type or IFN LR1 \u2212/\u2212 PH5CH8 cells with rhIFN\u03b2, rhIFN\u03bb3, or rhIFN\u03bb4 for 6 h and quantified the induction of ISGs by qPCR. MX1, OAS1, and ISG15 were induced by rhIFN\u03bb4 treatment at comparable levels to rhIFN\u03bb3 treatment. This induction was again abrogated in IFN LR1 \u2212/\u2212 cells (Fig. 2 , F-H). Control treatment with rhIFN\u03b2 resulted in stronger activation of pSTAT1 and induction of ISGs, regardless of the IFN LR1 \u2212/\u2212 status.",

To test if IFN\u03bb4 causes cell death, as another potential mechanism rendering IFN\u03bb4 expression detrimental to the host, PH5CH8 cells were treated with either rhIFN\u03bb4 (100 ng/ ml), rhIFN\u03bb3 (100 ng/ml), or actinomycin D (ActD; 10 \u00b5g/ ml). Cell death and confluence were assessed over 70 h using an IncuCyte imaging system. The cells were treated in the presence of Sytox green, a dye which enters dying cells as they lose membrane integrity. Neither IFN\u03bb3 nor IFN\u03bb4 induced cell death, and cell viability was comparable to mocktreated cells (Fig. 2 I and Video 1). ActD-treated cells served as a positive control for cell death in these assays and MX1 induction was assessed as a control to show similar IFN\u03bb activi-ties (Fig. 2 J) . When measured for cell confluence over time as a readout for proliferation, we found that IFN\u03bb3 and IFN\u03bb4 treatment shows a similar antiproliferative effect on cells compared with control cells (Fig. 2 I and Video 1). These data suggest that IFN\u03bb4 does not induce cell death in hepatocytes, which contradicts a previous study that found IFN\u03bb4 could induce cell death (Onabajo et al., 2015) . The authors of that study observed differences in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response and cell death in HepG2 cells using a plasmid-based overexpression system; this is in contrast to our use of titrated, recombinant IFN\u03bb proteins, which are likely a cleaner measure of cell death responses that would occur in vivo.",

Using primers flanking the coding region of IFNL4P179, we identified three additional IFNL4 transcripts with intron retention, which have a similar exon configuration to IFNL4P107, IFNL4P131, and IFNL4P179 (Fig. 4, A and B; and Fig. S3 ). We also identified pseudogenes with premature stop codons carrying the TT allele (Fig. S3) . Genes with intron retentions are not exported to the cytoplasm from the nucleus, or are subjected to nonsense-mediated decay in the rare event that export occurs.",

We established standard curves for these probes and for IFNL3 to measure absolute copy numbers for each isoform allowing to directly compare abundance across the transcripts ( Table 2) . Analysis of Huh7 cells (TT/\u0394G), HepG2 cells (TT/\u0394G), HeLa cells (\u0394G/\u0394G), and HEK293 cells (\u0394G/ \u0394G) stimulated with the RIG-I ligand HCV 5\u2032ppp RNA (HCV pathogen-associated molecular pattern [PAMP] ) and primary human hepatocytes (PHH; TT/\u0394G or \u0394G/\u0394G) stimulated with poly(I:C) revealed that IFNL3 was highly induced compared with all the IFNL4 transcripts (Fig. 4 , C-F and I-J). Surprisingly, the next most abundant transcripts were IFNL4 with retained introns, rather than any of the protein-coding isoforms. These were followed by IFNL4P131, IFNL4P179, and IFNL4P107 isoforms. As dendritic cells have been reported to express IFNL1-3 during viral infection (Coccia et al., 2004; Stone et al., 2013) , we also stimulated myeloid DC cells differentiated from MUTZ-3 cells (TT/ \u0394G) and THP-1 cells (TT/\u0394G) with poly(I:C) and examined IFNL expression patterns (Fig. 4 , G and H). Although poly(I:C) induced high IFNL3 expression in these DCs, the protein-coding IFNL4 isoforms were not induced, whereas the intron-retaining IFNL4 transcripts were observed only in THP-1-derived cells that have DC-like characteristics. We found that similar expression patterns, including low-level IFNL4P179 expression, were seen in hepatoma cells during infections with WNV, Dengue virus (DenV), and Sendai virus (SeV; Fig. 4 , K-M). Our data reveal that IFNL4 is poorly induced compared with IFNL3 during viral PAMP stimulation and viral infection and that nonfunctional, intron-retaining IFNL4 isoforms are preferentially transcribed instead of the protein-coding isoforms.",

            "text": "The poor induction of functional IFNL4P179 compared with IFNL3 during viral PAMP stimulation and viral infections would reflect low secretory output of the IFN\u03bb4p179 protein. To test this, we infected Huh7 and HepG2 cells with HCV, WNV, and SeV, and then immunoblotted the cell lysates and supernatants for endogenous IFN\u03bb4 protein. In conformity with previous studies, cell lysates, direct cell cul- ture supernatants, and TCA-concentrated supernatants did not yield detectable IFN\u03bb4 protein. To ensure that this was not a result of poor antibody sensitivity, we performed polysome fractionation to determine efficiency of active translation of IFNL3 and IFNL4 isoforms. Cell lysates from HepG2 cells stimulated with poly(I:C) or mock treated for 12 h were separated using a sucrose gradient to separate nontranslating monosome fractions of low centrifugal weight and polysome fractions of high centrifugal weight containing actively translated mRNA (Fig. 5, A-D) . Polysome fractions were then pooled and IFNL3 and IFNL4 isoforms were quantified by qPCR. Intriguingly, IFNL4 isoforms were poorly detected (<40 copies) in the heavy polysome and nontranslated monosome fractions, despite detection of high levels of IFNL3 in these fractions (Fig. 5, C and D) , suggesting that IFNL4 isoforms have only low association with actively translating ribosomal fractions compared with IFNL3. Furthermore, the 3\u2032 UTR of IFNL4, unlike other IFNL genes, does not harbor a canonical polyA signal (Fig. 5 E) . For mRNA termination, a polyA signal (canonical motif: AAU AAA) is essential for downstream cleavage and polyA of mRNA. PolyA signal sequences are not only critical for mRNA termination, but also for recruitment of RNA-binding proteins essential for stability and subsequent translation. In silico analysis of the IFNL4 3\u2032 UTR did not yield a strong canonical polyA signal compared with the other IFNL genes (Fig. S4) . To test the polyA signal usage and to identify the downstream cleavage site (CS) essential for IFNL4 mRNA termination, we used 3\u2032 rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3\u2032 RACE). Cloning and analysis of the 3\u2032 UTRs documented three distinct CSs used by IFNL4 mRNA for termination (Fig. 5 E) . More importantly, 70.6% of the analyzed sequences used the second cleavage site (CS#2) followed by CS#3 (23.5%) and CS#1 (5.9%). Intriguingly, the 5\u2032 ends of CS#2 (major cleavage site) and CS#1 (minor cleavage site) do not encode for a canonical or noncanonical polyA signal. Only a small percentage of IFNL4 mRNA sequences use CS#3, where a weak noncanonical polyA signal (AUU AAA) was detected, suggesting that this is not the major termination site. Previous studies have shown that eukaryotic mRNA does not tolerate changes in these nucleotide motifs and the efficiency of mRNA termination, polyA, and translations are severely hampered (Proudfoot, 2011) . Therefore, we propose that the majority of IFNL4 mRNA that is not efficiently terminated, is rapidly degraded and weakly translated. Overall, basal low-levels of in-frame IFNL4 mRNA expression and poor translation lead to lack of IFN\u03bb4 protein expression. nonfunctional IFnL4 splice variants arose before the \u0394G>tt frame-shift variant in humans Our studies suggest that IFN\u03bb4 mediates comparable antiviral activity to IFN\u03bb3, but its action is limited through mech-anisms including poor endogenous expression, expression of nonfunctional alternative splice variants, isoforms with intron retention, a frame-shift mutation that begets a premature stop codon (\u0394G>TT), and the absence of a canonical polyA signal. As nonhuman primates do not carry the \u0394G>TT frame-shift mutation and therefore have the potential to express full-length IFNL4, it is possible that humans have evolved multiple strategies for limiting the production of IFN\u03bb4 for yet unknown reasons. We hypothesized that if IFN\u03bb4 was detrimental to the host, we would observe such selection in nonhuman primates. Therefore, we stimulated Gorilla gorilla fibroblasts with poly(I:C) and found that they also expressed nonfunctional IFNL4P107 and IFNL4P131 isoforms, as well as unstable splice variants with intron retention (Fig. 5 F) . Like in humans, expression levels of functional IFNL4P179 were low. conclusion IFNL4 is a member of the type III IFNs that was most recently identified through a genetic association study (Prokunina-Olsson et al., 2013) . Genetic studies postulate a cell-autonomous, intracellular role for IFN\u03bb4 in dampening the antiviral response, but have failed to provide functional support for this hypothesis. Therefore, we performed a comprehensive biochemical and molecular study to investigate the functional role of IFN\u03bb4 during viral infections.",

We extended these observations by producing recombinant full-length IFN\u03bb4p179 protein in Drosophila S2 cells, further demonstrating that antiviral activity of IFN\u03bb4 is preserved and its potency against viruses such as HCV and WNV is comparable to that of IFN\u03bb3. We further observed that neither intracellular nor secreted IFN\u03bb4 isoforms interfered with type I or III IFN signaling, as they did not affect induction of ISGs via either type I or type III IFN receptors.

            "text": "We proceeded to examine whether endogenous IFN\u03bb4 acts similarly during PAMP stimulations or viral infection. By cloning endogenous IFNL4 isoforms from stimulated hepatocytes, we found additional mRNA splice variants with intron retention in the cDNA, which would not be translated as the introns prevent their export to the cytoplasm. This discovery warranted a comprehensive expression profiling analysis of IFNL4 isoforms induced in multiple cell lines and primary human hepatocytes containing both variants at rs368234815 (\u0394G and TT) during stimulation with PAMP and upon viral infections. Although previous studies documented induction of IFNL4 (Amanzada et al., 2013) , they have used primer/probes that do not differentiate the isoforms and in most cases amplify functional and nonfunctional isoforms indiscriminately. Using qPCR probes specific for each transcript, we were surprised to find that the intron-retaining and IFN LP107 isoforms were the most abundant among all IFNL4 isoforms regardless of their rs368234815 genotype. Intron-retaining transcripts are usually targeted for nonsense-mediated decay, and in recent years this process has been recognized as an efficient way to control expression of particular transcripts under different developmental phases or environmental contexts (Hamid and Makeyev, 2014) . Therefore, we hypothesize that preferential expression of the intron-retaining isoforms suppresses expression of functional IFNL4P179. More intriguingly, IFNL3 was induced several (two to three) logs-fold higher than any IFNL4 splice forms. This induction pattern was consistent irrespective of PAMP stimulations or viral infections. We propose two main reasons for inefficient translation of IFNL4 mRNA. First, multiple isoforms of IFNL4, including intron-retaining variants, are induced upon viral infection or stimulation with viral PAMP. Expression of multiple splice variants, especially nonprotein-coding transcripts, may reduce transcriptional resources for expression of the only functionally active IFNL4P179 isoform. Second, we determined that endogenous IFNL4 isoforms are not efficiently translated into proteins compared with IFNL3, as they are poorly loaded onto polyribosomes upon PAMP stimulation. Notably, IFNL4 is the only IFNL gene that does not encode a strong canonical polyA signal, which recruits proteins that cleave and polyadenylate the primary mRNA. PolyA sequences then lead to the recruitment of several RNA-binding proteins essential for mRNA stability and subsequent translation. Longer polyA tails provide higher mRNA stability and higher translation potential (Proudfoot, 2011) . Indeed, we found poor usage of its noncanonical polyA signal. Based on these data, we hypothesize that the IFNL4 3\u2032 UTR could be playing additional roles in reducing the expression levels and lowering the translation potential of IFNL4.",

            "text": "Our mechanistic evidence shows that humans have sustained adaptations suppressing IFN\u03bb4 activity even when the genotype at rs368234815 allows production of in-frame IFN\u03bb4. Our data suggest that the expression of functional IFNL4P179 isoform has been selected against in nonhuman primates even before the dinucleotide frame-shift mutation (\u0394G>TT) evolved in humans. We propose that splicing and translational control mechanisms to suppress expression of functional IFN\u03bb4 protein appeared before the frame shift mutation that evolved in humans to further silence its expression. Collectively, this study highlights differential activities of the IFNL genes during viral infection and the relatively low contribution of IFNL4 compared with IFNL3 in physiological immune contexts. The answer to the question of why bioactive IFNL4 expression is so greatly suppressed, but not IFNL3, can only be speculated. Similar to other IFN/cytokine genes, IFNL4 may have arisen from gene duplication but failed to subfunctionalize or neofunctionalize, leading to high redundancy with IFNL3. It is also possible that IFNL4 may have more complex pathological roles detrimental to the host, which led to its suppression. These are just speculations that can be tested only if the functional IFNL4 is expressed at physiological levels during infection. We and others have previously found the IFNL3 variant to have functional effects on antiviral immunity against HCV infection and, unfortunately, high linkage disequilibrium makes it difficult to distinguish the contributing effects of individual polymorphism. It remains to be seen whether the clinical association of IFNL4 gene expression with poor HCV clearance is simply explained by the tightly linked genetic association of the unfavorable IFNL4 \u0394G genotype with the unfavorable IFNL3 genotypes and not a direct biological effect of IFNL4.",
