Early initiation of adequate antibiotic therapy is the cornerstone in the treatment of bacterial ARIs and is associated with improved clinical outcomes [1] . However, overuse of antibiotics by over-prescription in outpatients and prolonged duration of antibiotic therapy in patients with bacterial ARIs in the hospital and intensive care setting is associated with increased resistance for common bacteria, high costs, and adverse drug reactions [2] . A novel approach to estimate the likelihood of bacterial infections and the severity of disease is the use of blood biomarkers mirroring the host response to infection, and the severity of infection. In recent years, procalcitonin (PCT) has emerged as a promising marker for the diagnosis of bacterial infections because higher levels are found in severe bacterial infections than in viral infections and nonspecific inflammatory diseases. Hence, PCT may be used to support clinical decision making for the initiation and discontinuation of antibiotic therapy [3] .",

            "text": "Procalcitonin is a prohormone of the calcium homeostasis hormone calcitonin. In non-infectious conditions it is produced in the neuroendocrine medullary C-cells of the thyroid gland. In normal subjects circulating procalcitonin concentrations are low (<0.05 ng/mL), but bacterial infections selectively induce an increase in the concentration of procalcitonin (in parenchymal tissues) because both endotoxins (lipopolysaccharides) from the bacterial cell wall and host responses to infection stimulate the production of procalcitonin by cytokines, such as IL-1 b, tumor necrosis factor-a, and IL-6. The up-regulation of PCT correlates with the severity and extent of bacterial infections. This results in an accumulation of procalcitonin because, unlike neuroendocrine cells, parenchymal cells lack the ability to cleave procalcitonin into its mature form, calcitonin [4] . Conversely, interferon-c, a cytokine released in response to viral infections, blocks the upregulation of PCT, resulting in a higher specificity of PCT toward bacterial infections. Quantitatively, PCT may help distinguish severe bacterial infections from milder viral illnesses [5] . It is detectable within 2-4 h and peaks within 6-24 h (as opposed to CRP which begins to rise after 12-24 h and peaks at 48 h) [6] . PCT production is not impaired by neutropenia or other immunosuppressive states. PCT levels parallel the severity of the inflammatory insult or infections meaning those with more severe disease have higher levels [7] . Furthermore, procalcitonin has some utility as a prognostic indicator with higher serum concentrations related to the risk of mortality [8] .",

(5) Serology for atypicals including Chlamydia pneumonia IgA/IgM/IgG, Coxiella bruntii IgM/IgG, legionella pneumonia IgM/IgG, Mycoplasma pneumonia IgA/ IgM/IgG, using (Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay) ELISA which is an immunoassay, suited to the determination of antibodies in the field of infectious serology. The reaction is based on the specific interaction of antibodies with their corresponding antigen. Therefore, the test strips of the SERION ELISA classic micro-titer plate are coated with specific antigens of the pathogen of interest. If antibodies in the patient\u00b4s serum sample are present, they bind to the fixed antigen. A secondary antibody, which has been conjugated with the enzyme alkaline phosphatase, detects the immune complex. The colorless substrate p-nitrophenylphosphate is then converted into the colored product p-nitro phenol. The signal intensity of the reaction product is proportional to the concentration of the analyte in the sample and is measured photometrically. (6) Urine test for Legionella antigen. These are linked to oligonucleotide probes that bind specifically to the amplified product. Monitoring the fluorescence intensities during the PCR run (i.e. real-time) allows the detection and quantification of the accumulating product without having to re-open the reaction tubes after the PCR run. The ARTUS SARS RG RT-PCR kit was used to detect the novel coronal virus. The artus SARS RG RT-PCR Kit is based on the amplification and simultaneous detection of a specific region of the SARS corona virus genome using real-time PCR. The kit provides high levels of specificity, sensitivity, and reproducibility. Each artus SARS RG RT-PCR Kit provides 4 quantitation standards. The use of standards enables accurate quantitation of viral load. In addition, the kit contains a second heterologous amplification system to identify possible PCR inhibition. This is detected as an internal control (IC) in a different fluorescence channel from the analytical PCR. The detection limit of the analytical SARS corona virus RT-PCR is not reduced. (8) Venous blood samples were collected from patients in 2 tubes, 2 ml of blood was delivered into EDTA tube to perform complete blood picture on the automatic cell counter. (9) The remaining amounts of blood were coagulated then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min, one part of the separated serum was used to assay blood chemistry (on Hitachi 911-Roche) and CRP concentration (on Axyem, Bayer-Germany), a value of CRP > 8 mg/L was considered abnormally elevated [14] .

In one study, Mu\u00a8ller et al., evaluated PCT in a number of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with typical pathogens, mostly Streptococcus pneumoniae. PCT was increased significantly in bacteremic patients compared with patients without an identified bacterial pathogen [27] . Another study focused on the potential of PCT to differentiate patients with a viral respiratory infection with or without bacterial super infection. This was investigated in patients with confirmed influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia in a critical care setting. PCT had differentiated the patients with bacterial super-infection from patients with viral pneumonia only [28] . Different studies have evaluated the prognostic potential of PCT in patients with respiratory infections, mainly in patients with CAP, the greatest benefit of PCT was found in patients classified as high risk by the pneumonia severity index score. Having a PCT < 0.1 ng/ml can exclude mortality in high-risk patients. Subsequent repeated measurements of PCT in this population demonstrated improved clinical outcomes with falling PCT levels [29] . In addition, the study found that PCT was more helpful in predicting serious adverse events, such as ICU admission or CAP-related complications [30] .",

Clinical follow-up with re-measurement of PCT within 6-24 h should be considered in all patients in whom antibiotics are withheld but who show clinical deterioration. If PCT is >0.25 ng/ml, and particularly >0.5 ng/ml, a bacterial infection becomes more likely and necessitates antibiotic therapy. (2) For patients who are clinically stable but presented with pneumonia, a PCT level >0.25 ng/ml strongly suggests that a bacterial infection and antibiotic therapy should be initiated, PCT should be reassessed every 2 days. Antibiotics may be discontinued if a patient shows clinical recovery and PCT decreases to <0.25 ng/ml (or by at least 80% to 90% from the peak level). Highly ele-vated PCT levels in this situation make bacteremic disease more likely and suggest that the infection may be more severe than expected based on clinical signs and symptoms. In patients suspected of having a pneumonia based on the presence of radiological infiltrates, a persistent (>24-48 h) PCT level of <0.1 ng/ml or even 0.1 ng/ml to <0.25 ng/ml argues against a typical bacterial infection, and physicians should consider the unusual pneumonias as pulmonary embolism, acute heart failure, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, and viral pneumonia particularly during flu season. If antibiotics are withheld initially, PCT should be rechecked after 6 to 24 h. If PCT levels are <0.25 ng/ml but bacterial infection is still highly suspected based on the clinical presentation or microbiologic results, antibiotic therapy should be considered. If PCT remains low during follow-up, early discontinuation of antibiotics should be considered, as well as an aggressive diagnostic workup for other causes. (3) For high-risk or patients in the ICU with severe respiratory infection (Fig 2B) , empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated. Still, an initial PCT level of <0.5 ng/ml argues against a typical bacterial infection, and other diagnoses should be considered, including viral causes, repeating the PCT level at 6-24 h in highrisk patients may be important so as not to miss the evolution of the inflammatory cascade, similar to the strategy used for serial troponins in monitoring cardiac ischemia. If PCT levels do not decrease or remaining high, treatment failure should be considered and reassessment of patients is recommended.",
