            "text": "In March 2020, Coronavirus Disease 2019 originating from Wuhan, China, has become pandemic. Based on epidemic data from China we constructed and constrained a simple Susceptible-Infected-Infectious-Excluded (SIIE) model. The model is characterized by only three parameters: average incubation period, contact rate r C , and exclusion rate r E . These two rates control the daily multiplication coefficient \u03b2 describing epidemic growth in its early exponential phase, during which the number of excluded (confirmed) individuals grows as E = E0 exp(\u03b1 t) with \u03b1 = ln \u03b2. The rates can be modified by non-therapeutic interventions: r C can be reduced by quarantine, while r E can be increased by efficient testing, enabling isolation of infectious individuals. In order to contain exponential epidemic growth, quotient r C /r E has to be reduced to 1. Based on the model, we estimate that the quarantine imposed in China on January 23, 2020 resulted in about 50-fold reduction of this quotient, allowing to terminate the exponential growth phase and enter the phase of exponential regression of daily new cases. In contrast, quarantine imposed in northern, most affected, Italian provinces on February 21 resulted in about 3-fold reduction of r C /r E and corresponding decrease of \u03b2 from about 1.5 to about 1.2; further 5-fold reduction is necessary to terminate exponential growth. Even higher reduction should take place in France, Germany and Spain for which \u03b2 > 1.3 (as of March 10, 2020). Considering longer-term dynamics in the case when the initial exponential growth is not contained by quarantine, we analyzed a scenario in which r E decreases in response to the surge of daily new cases which convinces people to isolate themselves. In such case, initial abrupt epidemic growth is followed by a slow decrease over years. This scenario, although economically and socially devastating, grants time to develop, produce, and distribute vaccine.",

            "text": "On March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic. The disease is caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, that is transmitted between people via respiratory droplets. Typical symptoms are fever, cough, and shortness of breath. In severe cases, infection leads to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. There is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment. The virus was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019. The disease had spread widely over the province of Hubei, but was contained as a result of a strict quarantine imposed on January 23, 2020. The peak of daily confirmed cases of about 4000 was reached on March 3, 2020, ten days after the quarantine had been * tlipnia@ippt.pan.pl imposed, and then it decreased below 100 daily new cases as observed in the beginning of March, 2020. Currently (March 12, 2020), despite some efforts, nearly exponential growth is observed in European countries, including Italy (with more than 15 000 cumulative cases), France, Germany, and Spain, recording more than 2000 cumulative cases each, and in the US with more than 1000 cases. In contrast, South Korea, having nearly 8000 cumulative cases, appears to be exiting the exponential phase due to the effective contact tracing and extensive testing.",

Our model assumes that an individual can be in one of the following states: susceptible (S), infected (i 1 , . . . , i 5 ), infectious (I), or excluded (E). Susceptible individuals get infected by contact with infectious individuals with the rate proportional to the contact rate, r C . Multiple infected states are introduced to account for the average incubation period, \u03c4 . With k = 5 infected states such representation is equivalent to the assumption that the incubation period is distributed according to \u0393(t; k = 5, \u03b8 = \u03c4 /k). Infectious individuals may become excluded with the exclusion rate r E . Excluded individuals include the confirmed cases currently handled by the healthcare system, those recovered with acquired resistance, and the deceased. Excluded individuals cannot infect. As we are interested in relatively short-term dynamics, we assume that excluded individuals maintain resistance to the disease.

Initially, the ratio r C /r E = 11.5, which corresponds to \u03b2 init (r C /r E ) = 1.4 estimated for the exponential phase ( Fig. 3B) . Thus, to stabilize the epidemic, China had to reduce r C /r E to 1, i.e., by a factor 11.5. However as indicated by the regression of daily cases, China reduced \u03b2 to approximately 0.88 = \u03b2 R , which implies r C /r E = 0.22. It should be noticed that as long as the epidemic progresses exponentially, coefficient \u03b2 calculated from the increase of cumulative cases E(t), and coefficient \u03b2 calculated based on daily cases, E(t) \u2212 E(t \u2212 1 day), should be equal (which can be obscured by unavoidable fluctuations in daily data). However, when the epidemic ceases, \u03b2 calculated based on E(t) reaches 1, while \u03b2 R based on E(t) \u2212 E(t \u2212 1 day) becomes smaller than 1, reflecting the exponential regression of the daily as well as the active cases. Reduction of \u03b2 from the initial value \u03b2 init = 1.4 to \u03b2 R = 0.88 implies reduction of quotient r C /r E form 11.5 to 0.22, i.e., about 50 times. We expect that in the case of China the decrease of coefficient r C /r E resulted mainly from very strict quarantine, in which more than 50 million people in the most affected province of Hubei were forced to remain at home, with one person per household allowed to leave every few days.

It is clear that even this smaller number exceeds the healthcare capacity of a country of tens of millions inhabitants such as Italy (\u223c60 million) or Poland (\u223c40 million). This, in turn, implies higher case fatality rate, which may approach the rate of severe cases (10-15% [6] ). Correspondingly, with \u03b2 changing from 1.05 to 1.1, time to reach the maximum daily new cases shortens twice: from 6 to 3 months, assuming the initial number of excluded (confirmed) cases, E(t = 0), equal 5000. We should notice that \u03b2 = 1.05 as well as \u03b2 = 1.1 require quarantine; in non-quarantined countries, such as currently France, German, Spain, and the US, parameter \u03b2 exceeds 1.3 (Fig. 3B) .",

Initially, when the number of cases is relatively low, the only way to reduce the contact rate is the administratively-imposed quarantine. However, one could expect that when the number of daily new cases exceeds a threshold, people will begin reducing their contacts voluntarily. To account for this behavioral aspect, we assume that the contact rate is a decreasing function of daily new cases. We propose to assume that r C = r C0 \u00d7 H/ (H + (daily new cases)). This simple formula implies, in particular, that when the number of daily new cases equals H, people reduce their contacts twice. It is hard to predict the value of H, as it can be possibly culture-dependent. In Fig. 5 we show long-term epidemic dynamics assuming H = 10 000. In the considered scenario, the number of daily new cases relatively quickly approaches 40 000 and then decreases slowly over years with decreasing susceptible fraction f S . Higher H would imply higher peak followed by faster decrease. The scenario depicted in Fig. 5 results in a manageable number of new cases and grants time to develop, produce, and distribute vaccine.",

The remaining model parameter is the average incubation period, assumed equal 5 days [1, 2] . A decrease of the contact rate, which can be achieved by imposing quarantine, results in a decreases of the multiplication coefficient \u03b2 that describes growth of the cumulative as well as the daily new cases in the exponential phase. Coefficient \u03b2 can be decreases also by an increase of the exclusion rate, which in turn depends on efficiency of the health systems. Large exclusion rate is achieved by fast identification and isolation of infectious individuals. The critical importance has the quotient r C /r E that has to be reduced to 1 in order to contain the spread of the epidemic (increase of the number of daily new cases), and reduced further below 1 in order to eliminate the disease.",

This allowed to reduce coefficient \u03b2 from about 1.4 in the exponential growth phase to about \u03b2 R = 0.9 in the regression phase, for which \u03b2 R was estimated by the decrease of daily cases in the month following the peak of epidemic. In Italy, however, in response to the mild quarantine, \u03b2 was reduced from about 1.5 in the early phase (February 23-29, 2020) to 1.22 observed in the last-week period (March 4-10, 2020), which corresponds to the reduction of the quotient r C /r E from about 17 to 5; thus, further 5-fold reduction is necessary to contain the exponential spread. The 3 other European countries with the number of cases exceeding 2000-France, Germany and Spain-have coefficients \u03b2 exceeding 1.3 (March 4-10, 2020), which requires at least 7-fold reduction of their r C /r E quotients. Even higher \u03b2 = 1.5 is suggested by data in the US (March 4-10, 2020), which requires about 17-fold reduction of r C /r E ; reduction by 70 times would bring the epidemic to the regression phase with \u03b2 R = 0.9, as was done in Hubei. Higher \u03b2 R \u2208 (0.9, 1.0) may also allow to eliminate the disease, but the required quarantine time would be much longer. Data from South Korea suggest that this country is exiting from the exponential phase. This is possibly the consequence of effective contact tracing and extensive testing: as of March 10, the number of tests exceeds 200 000, which is 3 times more than in Italy [5] .",

Additionally, keeping the coefficient \u03b2 at this low level requires rigorous limitation of personal contacts, while the time to the peak of the epidemic would be about 6 months.

This definition works well in the steady state when the number of active cases remains constant or when historical data of previous epidemics are analyzed. However, in the exponential growth phase, case fatality rate understates the real rate. When, for example, the average time between the onset of symptoms or positive test and death is just four days and \u03b2 = 1.2, which implies doubling of cases within four days, the number of deaths should be divided by the number of cases recorded four days before, not by the current number. This would imply doubling of the growth rate, and this suggests that the actual case fatality rate in Italy is higher than 6.6% ( 827 /12 465, based on WHO definition and data from March 12, 2020).",

As in early cases, the contact rate may be reduced only by forcing people to remain at home; in the latter phase, when the number of daily cases exceeds a threshold, people will isolate themselves in order to reduce the risk. It is intuitive to assume that contact rate is a decreasing function of daily cases in the form r C = r C0 \u00d7 H/ (H + (daily new cases)), where H is the number of daily new cases for which people decide to reduce their contacts twice. In such case the number of daily new cases reaches the value roughly proportional to H and then slowly decreases due to the decreasing fraction of susceptible individuals. Such scenario seems the most realistic and, although devastating for economy and social life, grants time to develop and administer vaccine. Obviously, the more plausible is termination of exponential growth by organized quarantine and efficient testing. Based on termination of epidemic progression in China as well as in South Korea, such scenario seems to be within reach of developed countries but requires political uneasy decision.",
