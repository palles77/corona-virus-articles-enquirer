Critical researchers moved the focus from the study of forms and structures to the interpretation of meaning in the examination of landscapes, from high culture to popular culture, from quantification toward qualitative methods, and from societal and general to quotidian and individual foci. Perspectives employed in anthropology and sociology were particularly useful in this remaking of culturally oriented human geography. The debate resulted in a considerable diversification of human-and cultural-geographical investigations and new collaborative networks. The changes supported the visibility and credibility of human geography in the humanities and social sciences, stressing the importance of space and place in human phenomena. By the 21st Century, these developments diminished the relative isolation of human geography, caused by geography's long roots in the positivist tradition of science.",

Geographers interested in the relations between species have contributed to the diverse networks of human-animal studies with their holistic understanding of space, place, landscape, interdependence of scales, and the environment. Animals, in turn, have fostered collaboration between human and physical geographers and data-and map-savvy GIS experts in the study of urban wilderness or conservation issues. Animals have also motivated inquiry into posthumanism, challenging the human-centricity of human geographers and expanding their view on subjectivity in subdisciplines such as political geography and geopolitics. Within geography, animal geography became institutionalized in the late 2000s and early 2010s with the establishment of an Animal Geography Specialty Group within the American Association of Geographers, research seminar and online networks, integration of animal topics in the curricula, and a growing volume of research publications and textbooks.",

Early studies about consumption relied heavily on economy in their modeling and evaluation of networks from the perspective of efficient flows, accessibility, and most suitable locations. Along with the challenge to predominant views in architecture and with human-geographical interest in behavioral studies came questions such as, \"How do spatial designs impact behavior and identity of consumers?\" Subsequent inquiries enhanced contacts between semiotics and the geographical interpretation of symbolic meanings (drawing from landscape studies, iconography, and cartography). Also evident were connections to the sociology of inclusion and exclusion in public and private space. These changes emphasized qualitative methods and individuals over quantification and systems.",

Researchers first asked how spaces themselves are being consumed and then began to think how consumption articulates national, ethnic, and other identities. For example, in the marketing of cities and their neighborhoods, images of cultural and intellectual vivacity, cuisine, economic prosperity, comfort and convenience, and safety are valuable tools for imagemaking, place promotion, and branding. Growing concerns about the environmental impact of agriculture, the sustainability and ethics of food production, the role of food in the development and political stability of societies, and the geopolitical implications of food-related risks are examples that further show the value of joining forces also within geography. More recently, attention has turned toward animals as consumers of goods and agricultural products and as coproducers of human entertainment, sports events, and material flows. Shopping for urban animal companions and the work of professional equine athletes (such as race horses) exemplify these roles.",

The emphasis is on public engagement, effectiveness of research, and interdisciplinary and applied solving of concrete problems. An English-language master's program in urban studies and planning was launched in 2017, and new funding for \"research supporting the development of the capital city region\" was secured in 2018 from the three constituent cities of Metropolitan Helsinki, until 2023. The establishment of the Helsinki Institute for Urban and Regional Studies at the University of Helsinki in 2018 enhances this development, but also competes with similar endeavors at Aalto and some other Finnish universities despite the outspoken collaborative \"vision.\" In both cases, human geographers have been central in fostering interdisciplinary study of contemporary urban challenges in Metropolitan Helsinki and better understanding of research-based information among city politicians, planners, and administrators.

In both contexts, the choice of reading materials must be carefully balanced. The teacher of an interdisciplinary class (like the author of an interdisciplinary textbook), therefore, needs to solve how to assess key concepts and methodologies, and how to encourage the students to search and apply information across disciplinary boundaries. Possible solutions are multiple and vary, but, generally, teachers of interdisciplinary themes and students interested in interdisciplinary learning constantly scrutinize their teaching or learning philosophies, attitudes, assumptions, and practices to get the best out of each class.",

The role of individual researchers is, in any case, crucial in the evolution of interdisciplinarity. This is so because they make decisions about interaction with others in groups, networks, and institutions. Successful collaboration requires careful and conscious attention to communication, for specialized expert communities typically have their own, nuanced vocabularies, and one word can mean different things to different people. Stereotypes, prejudice, and defense of the home turf are common despite established collaboration and common goals.",

The design of interdisciplinary projects, even within geography and one cultural or linguistic sphere, demands that the participants fully understand the ways in which they themselves and others construct, order, and communicate knowledge. Also helpful is critical self-reflection on what one's own field can contribute, and how, to the common taskdand what could be done better in everyday encounters. This will require questioning the self-evident, listening to others, and letting go of mannerisms, for example, by making an effort to avoid jargon.",

In these people's view, boundary crossing, experimental hybrids, and exploration beyond conventions support creativity and innovation. From this perspective, interdisciplinarity encourages discovery, continuous learning, intellectual stimuli, and freedom of choice, and is fun. Open-mindedness and constructive competition of perspectives are mutually supportive and underline the spatial dimensions of human phenomena. According to those who think of interdisciplinarity as a strength, one outcome is an enhanced and better-defined professional identity as geographer, human geographer, and, say, political or cultural geographer because interdisciplinary scholars must understand and reflect on the specifics and value of their own contribution. The holders of these views consider all this beneficial to the evolution of academic research, in general, and human geography, in particular. The emphasis here is on the first part of the word (inter): on a confident collaboration of disciplinary bases in order to understand phenomena such as migration, health and well-being, climate change, or consumption.",

From this perspective, caution is recommended, and disciplinary cores and boundaries need to be maintained to protect continuity and clear professional identity. The holders of this view argue that novel ideas are not always welcomed and competition, disciplinary differences, and subsequent difficulties in communication are likely to strengthen boundaries rather than lower them. Prejudice and stereotypes resurface when the collaborators discuss the best ways of testing their results, decide on the most suitable publication channels for their work, or compete over funding. The promotion of new ways of thinking and networking can require an uncomfortable degree of risk taking, not least because the pushing of boundaries of the mainstream may lead to defense reactions and resistance.",

Those working on nascent hybrids may face difficulties in finding suitable publication channels before their line of research begins to institutionalize. All these obstacles may harm individual career development and delay public scrutiny of the proposed ideas. On the other hand, successful overcoming of these difficulties can profile these individuals as path-opening pioneers in their respective fields, adding to the lure of interdisciplinary exploration.",
