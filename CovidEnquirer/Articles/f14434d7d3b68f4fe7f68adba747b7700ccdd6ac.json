All children showed increased lymphocytes (>4.4\u00d710 9 /L) with normal white blood cell counts on admission. Radiological changes were not typical for COVID-19.

During clinical practice, we noticed that the time for viral RNA in respiratory specimens turning negative was similar between pediatric patients and infected adults (these children's family members). At this point, adult patients had negative results for nucleic acid testing in fecal specimens, whereas SARS-CoV-2 RNA remained detectable in stools from the two infected children. Therefore, we conducted a quarantine and surveillance protocol for the children and their family members who were already qualified for hospital discharge according to current standards after recovery with two consecutively negative RT-PCR test results in throat swabs (sampling interval at least 1 day). Concerned about the possibility of fecal-oral transmission, we recorded the timeline of changes in nucleic acid testing results in both throat swabs and fecal samples collected from these patients (Figure 2 ). All adult patients of the two families showed negative results for fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. Strikingly, viral RNA remained detectable in stools of the two children for 8 and 20 days, respectively, after nucleic acid turning negative in respiratory samples.",

Whether it is also the case during school year is hard to tell. One distinct feature of pediatric cases is that almost all of them are infected through household contact with adult patients. [9] [10] [11] [12] 21 As with all new diseases, many characteristics of COVID-19 still remain largely unknown. There is limited data to support the notion that children are less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection or virus transmission is less effective among them. Viral RNA has been constantly detected in stool samples and anal swabs collected from confirmed cases of COVID-19. 5, [22] [23] [24] [25] In one study, fecal specimens from 9 (53%) of 17 patients were positive for nucleic acid testing, although viral loads of the stool were less than those of respiratory samples. 24 Presence of SARS-CoV-2 was even detected in environmental samples taken from the surface of toilet bowl and sink in infection isolation rooms. 26 Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 remained viable in the stool of infected patients as reported by some case reports. 18 Evidence so far indicates the potential for SARS-CoV-2 to be transmitted through fecal excretion. 18 Although the role of fecal shedding in viral All rights reserved.

Actually, this phenomenon is not rare among pediatric patients. 27 Xiao and colleagues demonstrated that about a quarter of COVID-19 patients had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detectable in feces after viral clearance in respiratory tract. 25 However, the researchers did not discuss whether persistent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 was more common in certain age group than the others (patient's ages ranged from 10 months to 78 years in this study). Therefore, discharged patients might be a potential source of transmission and follow-up after hospital discharge or discontinuation of quarantine is advisable. The limitations of this study should also be noted. In response to the emerging disease, only respiratory specimens were required for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 according to clinical guidelines in the early stage of COVID-19 outbreak. We therefore failed to obtain stool samples from the patients during their first few days of hospitalization and could not determine whether throat swabs and fecal samples showed positive on RT-PCR analysis simultaneously. Moreover, we did not culture the virus isolated from the feces to test the viability nor measure viral loads in the samples due to limited conditions. All rights reserved.

            "text": "In face of the emerging infectious disease and limited data on pediatric patients, it is unclear what role children play in SARS-CoV-2 transmission or to what extent children are affected by the virus. More attention should be drawn to children, especially for young children who cannot handle their own excretions. Caregivers of these children should avoid direct contact with the stool and close the lid before flushing the toilet. Precautionary measures are needed when conducting aerosol-generating procedures and sewer system should be kept unobstructed. In some rural areas and underdeveloped regions with poor sanitation in China, stools are often used as natural fertilizer in agriculture. As sewage cannot be properly disinfected in these places, it might be possible that SARS-CoV-2 polluted water causes infection in wild animals which bring the virus back to humans, creating a vicious cycle. It is also of vital importance to implement strict hygiene measures after reopening of kindergartens and schools to prevent spreading of the infection among preschool and schoolchildren.",

            "text": "Taken together, there is an urgent need to re-evaluate the current version of Diagnosis and Treatment Plan of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (tentative seventh edition). 13 Nucleic acid testing on fecal specimens should be added to the current criteria for hospital discharge and release of isolation. We call for multi-center studies with larger sample size to clarify the time lag between fecal and respiratory specimens negative for RNA RT-PCR analysis in infected children.Postscript:We reported to the local health authority immediately once we noticed the persistentshedding of SARS-CoV-2 in feces of our pediatric patients about three weeks ago. When this paper was finalized, the seventh edition of Diagnosis and Treatment Plan of Corona Virus Disease 2019 had just been issued and indicated the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Currently, capable hospitals in some parts of China (such as Shanghai, Guangdong Province, and Shandong Province) have already included negative nucleic acid testing result of fecal specimens as one of the standards for hospital discharge and release of isolation. Author Contributions: Q-SX had full access to all the data in the study and took responsibility for the integrity of and the accuracy of the data. Q-SX and Y-HX designed the study and conceptualized the paper. WN, QW, G-JL, J-NT and X-FS collected the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiological data. W-JL contributed to laboratory testing. WN and G-JL summarized the data. Y-HX, WN and QW wrote the initial draft of the manuscript. All authors provided critical feedback and approved the final version.",
