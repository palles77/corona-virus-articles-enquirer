They divided the population being studied in time t into three classes labeled S(t), I(t) and R(t), where S(t) is the number of susceptible individuals, I(t) is the number of infective individuals, and R(t) is the number of removed individuals at time t, respectively. And they assumed that a rate of contacts by an infective with a susceptible is proportional to population size with constant of proportionality. It is clear that the assumption is too simple. Later Capasso and Serio [2] introduced a saturated incidence rate g(I)S into the epidemic model after studying the cholera epidemic spread in Bari in 1973, which describes the contact between infective individuals and susceptible individuals, where",

The general incidence rate kI p S 1 \u00fe aI q was proposed by Liu et al. [13, 14] and used by a number of authors, see, for example, [3, 5, 7, 1] , etc. For a specific nonlinear incident rate kI 2 S 1 \u00fe aI 2 ; Ruan and Wang in [16] studied an epidemic model with this specific nonlinear incident rate and obtained lots of interesting dynamical behaviors of the model such as a limit cycle, two limit cycles and homoclinic loop, etc. Note that these functions g(I) of the incident rate g(I)S is monotone, which means that the contact rate between infective individuals and susceptible individuals is bigger and bigger as the number of infective individuals is getting larger. However, it is not true in reality. For example, in the recent outbreak of epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) the ''psychological'' effects on the general public (see [4, 9] ), aggressive measures and policies, such as border screening, mask wearing, quarantine, isolation, etc. may tend to reduce the number of contacts per unit time as the number of infective's were getting relatively larger. To model this phenomenon, Xiao and Ruan in [18] considered a special nonlinear incident rate kIS 1 \u00fe aI 2 ; where g(I) is non-monotone. When I is small, g(I) is increasing. Because of small number of infective's, people may ignore the epidemic, which may lead to lots of effective contacts between the infective individuals and suspectable. And when I is getting larger and larger, g(I) is decreasing since many protection measures could be taken by the susceptible individuals. In [18] , Xiao and Ruan presented the global analysis of an epidemic model with the non-monotonic incident rate and obtained either the number of infective individuals tends to zero as time evolves or the disease persists. Hence, the model cannot undergo any bifurcations.",

There have been lots of works on the stability of endemic equilibrium for some epidemic models (cf. [10] [11] [12] and references therein). In this paper, we have studied the bifurcation behaviors of the SIR epidemic model with the general non-monotone and nonlinear incidence rate kIS/(1 + bI + aI 2 ). From the analysis, we have found that there exist some values of the model such that the model can undergo a series of bifurcations, such as saddle-node bifurcation, Hopf bifurcation and Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation. When a stable limit cycle surrounds the endemic equilibrium, it means that the number of the infective tends to a periodic function and the disease will exhibit frequently regular oscillation. Hence, the disease become periodic outbreak as time evolves. On the other hand, there exist some parameters values such that the model has two endemic equilibria (one is a saddle and the other is centertype equilibrium) and a stable homoclinic loop. Thus, the disease will persist.",
