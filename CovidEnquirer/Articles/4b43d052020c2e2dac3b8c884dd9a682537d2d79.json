Typically, this risk or incidence is fairly small. The organization further classifies these reactions as acute, occurring within 24 hours of transfusion, or delayed, occurring 24 hours post-transfusion. The common acute immunological reactions are: hemolytic ABO/Rh mismatch which can occur in up to 1:40 000 patients and febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions which may affect 0.1-1% of patients. The latter can be treated with antipyretics. Other considerations include mild allergic reactions (urticaria) with up to 3% of patients being affected to more serious severe reactions of anaphylaxis with a much lower incidence of 1:50 000. Urticaria can be treated with antihistamines (diphenhydramine) or steroids. Reported delayed immunologic reactions include post-transfusion-related purpura and transfusion-associated graft versus host disease (TA-GVHD), both of which are reported to be rare [16r] but patients with weaker immune systems are more susceptible to TA-GVHD reactions [11S] . The more notable and commonly cited transfusion reactions that can occur are transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) with a 1:1200-1:190 000 incidence and transfusionassociated circulatory overload (TACO) with a less than 1% reported incidence. Both of these reactions have been reported in adults and pediatric patient populations.",

This retrospective trial demonstrated that the symptomatic presentation of TRALI in both of these patient populations is very similar and should not be overlooked. Although the numbers were small, there did not appear to be a difference in presentations or outcomes between adults and children with TRALI [17c]. By further stratifying the pediatric patients into age groups, the authors noted that most of the children who presented with TRALI were either teenagers or less than 1-year olds, potentially concluding that these two pediatric patient populations are at a higher risk.

Over 2000 patients were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the liberal transfusion strategy or restrictive transfusion strategy. The follow-up duration was 3 years, during which over 40% of patients died.

An observational study evaluated the impact of a computerized clinical decision support system to see if it would promote proper decision making strategies for transfusions of red blood cells (RBCs) by physicians. Patient outcomes (overall mortality, 30-day readmissions and length of stay) as well as the number of RBC transfusions were assessed before and after implementations of the computerized alert trigger for transfusions when hemoglobin levels were higher than 7 g/dL. The results were overwhelmingly positive [12c]. There was a significant improvement in RBC utilization and the clinical patient outcomes showed improvement as well (mortality, p \u00bc 0.034; length of stay, p \u00bc 0.003) or remained stable (30-day readmission rates, p \u00bc 0.909). The mean number of units transfused per patient also declined (3.6 to 2.7, p < 0.001). This also led to a reduction in acquisition costs of RBC units. The authors concluded that there was a statistically significant improvement in clinical patient outcomes when combined with an improved blood utilization protocol based on a computerized clinical decision support system [12c].",

For many decades, advances in the preparation of platelets, including the introduction of pathogen reduction techniques, have been improved. Additionally, indications have been extended, for example to patients with drug-induced platelet dysfunction. However, platelet shortage is a serious medical concern. In November of 2014, the American Association of Blood Banks published guidelines for the administration of platelet transfusions in adult patients. These guidelines included only one strong recommendation on moderate quality evidence: platelets could be transfused prophylactically to reduce the risk of spontaneous bleeding in adult patients admitted to hospital with platelet counts of 10 \u00c2 109 cells/L or less, and low doses are equally effective as high doses [27r] . In 2012, the Society of Thoracic Surgeons recommended that patients should have transfusions after a coronary artery bypass only if their hemoglobin concentrations fell to less than 70 g/L (7 g/dL); before this time, some patients would automatically be transfused after surgery or when hemoglobin was at 100 g/L (10 g/dL). Due to these and other similar guidelines, the total number of transfusions each year has been falling according to the American Red Cross, which covers about 40% of the US blood bank market. This both decreases the medical costs as well as decreases the risk of unnecessary side effects [27r].",

A systematic review of nearly 90 studies (2000 patients) was performed which investigated C1-INH for HAE. Replacement therapy with C1-INH significantly shortened time to onset of symptom relief in HAE attacks compared with placebo in many of the reviewed studies. C1-INH has been shown to be effective for patients receiving home therapy and short-and long-term prophylaxis. Treatment with C1-INH was generally well tolerated and administration of C1-INH was not associated with transmission of viruses or development of autoantibodies irrespective of treatment duration [32R]. Another observational study wanted to get a physician perspective on what they thought was a \"true\" incidence of side effects when administering C1-INH for HAE in their patients. This study was done via a survey to physicians who manage patients with HAE. The study was designed to determine the risk of thrombosis associated with C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) via a survey. The survey queried physicians about their observations while treating HAE. Of the 66 physicians who participated in the survey, 37 had patients (856 patients) who were on C1-INH but only 4 (total of 5 patients) had patients on C1-INH who experienced a thromboembolic episode [33c].",

Dose equivalence was established as the primary efficacy endpoint. During the subcutaneous IG (SCIG) period, 52% of patients experienced a serious bacterial infection, with one patient requiring hospitalization.

In a retrospective trial, the researches aimed to investigate the frequency of rhinosinusitis after HSCT, and the association between rhinosinusitis and chronic graft vs. host disease (GVHD). Patients with GVHD had a higher frequency and recurrence of rhinosinusitis, in addition to more frequent need for endoscopic sinusectomy and decreased overall survival [106c].",

In this study, cardiac function was evaluated using echocardiography and levels of NT-proBNP in 18 patients, and in 18 matched controls. Patients in the HCT group had cardiac dimensions, and left ventricular ejection fractions within normal range. However, they also had lower measurements of left ventricular diastolic function and a significantly higher NT-proBNP levels. The investigators also reported that heart rate was significantly higher in the HCT group [107c].",

It should be suspected if the patient has clinical findings (ex: hypoxemia, hypotension, fever, transient leucopenia and bilateral pulmonary edema) typically within 6 hours of transfusion [18S]. The treatment should include discontinuation of transfusion (if applicable) and supportive care where applicable including: ventilator support, maintenance of hemodynamic status and fever reducing agents. Most patients demonstrate clinical improvements within 96 hours from symptom onset. The reported overall fatality rate post-TRALI is 5% [18S].",

Correction of dilutional coagulopathy was then performed using fibrinogen concentrate on each sample. Samples diluted with HES or dextran demonstrated decreased correction of coagulopathy compared to those diluted with albumin (p 0.001). The platelet component of clot strength was decreased more by the dextran solutions than albumin (p 0.001) [38E].Mortality in patients with hypovolemic shock treated with crystalloids or colloids was compared in the CRIS-TAL trial. In the colloid group, 68.8% of patients received HES. At 28 days, there was no difference in mortality but at 90 days, mortality was 30.7% in colloids group vs.",

Romiplastim was implicated with hematologic adverse reactions more frequently than eltrombopag, while eltrombopag was associated with gastrointestinal events [91R]. A systematic review of thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPOs) for treatment of myelodysplasic disorder included 4 studies of romiplostim and 1 of eltrombopag.Romiplastim was associated with decreased bleeding events and platelet transfusions when adjusted for time exposure. There was no increase in AML progression. The authors emphasized possible bias in reported data[92C].",
