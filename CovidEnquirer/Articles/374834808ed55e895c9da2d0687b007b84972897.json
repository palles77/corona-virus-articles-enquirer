            "text": "Active immunization is an effective means of blocking the pharmacodynamic effects of drugs and holds promise as a treatment for heroin addiction. Previously, we demonstrated the efficacy of our first-generation vaccine in blocking heroin self-administration in rats, however, many vaccine components can be modified to further improve performance. Herein we examine the effects of varying heroin vaccine injection route and adjuvant formulation. Mice immunized via subcutaneous (sc) injection exhibited inferior anti-heroin titers compared to intraperitoneal (ip) and sc/ip coadministration injection routes. Addition of TLR9 agonist cytosine-guanine oligodeoxynucleotide 1826 (CpG ODN 1826) to the original alum adjuvant elicited superior antibody titers and opioid affinities compared to alum alone. To thoroughly assess vaccine efficacy, full dose\u2212response curves were generated for heroin-induced analgesia in both hot plate and tail immersion tests. Mice treated with CpG ODN 1826 exhibited greatly shifted dose\u2212response curves (10\u221213-fold vs unvaccinated controls) while non-CpG ODN vaccine groups did not exhibit the same robust effect (2\u22127fold shift for ip and combo, 2\u22123-fold shift for sc). Our results suggest that CpG ODN 1826 is a highly potent adjuvant, and injection routes should be considered for development of small molecule\u2212protein conjugate vaccines. Lastly, this study has established a new standard for assessing drugs of abuse vaccines, wherein a full dose\u2212response curve should be performed in an appropriate behavioral task.",

Indeed, heroin abuse is a significant problem that incurs large social and economic costs worldwide. 1, 2 Alarmingly, the number of heroin users in the U.S. has grown by 50% from 2002 to 2010. 3 Furthermore, since 2007 the number of deaths due to heroin overdose has also increased. 4 Due to the severity of heroin addiction, there is a dire need for anti-heroin addiction treatments that are more effective than currently available pharmacological agents (e.g., methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone). The first report of a working heroin vaccine was disclosed in 1974, 5 however, further research on heroin immunopharmacotherapy has only been conducted in the past decade. 6, 7 Previously, we reported the design of a heroin\u2212KLH (keyhole limpet hemocyanin) immunoconjugate ( Figure 1 ) that showed ample promise in combination with alum adjuvant as a vaccine against heroin addiction. 8 As a testament to the vaccine's efficacy, immunization of heroin-dependent rats prevented relapse to compulsive intake of heroin in self-administration models. 9 Herein, we sought to further improve our vaccine's performance through injection route and adjuvant exploration.",

Interestingly, no study to date has investigated injection route of small molecule conjugate vaccines. In addition to administration route, adjuvants can also impact vaccine performance. In this capacity, TLR agonists could play an important role in vaccine design with their ability to modulate immune responses. For example, CpG ODN acts as a pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) to stimulate the innate immune receptor TLR9. 10 A specific CpG ODN, CpG 1826 (Figure 1 ), is a member of \"B-class\" ODNs which activate B-cell immune responses. 11 Impressively, vaccine trials engaging a specific CpG ODN sequence (#1826) in combination with alum have demonstrated its ability to safely enhance IgG antibody titers against the target antigen in mice. 12 19 and lymphoma. 20 Results from most clinical studies demonstrate CpG ODN efficacy in enhancing immunity to the target antigen while displaying a favorable safety profile. Additionally, this adjuvant is inexpensive, stable, readily obtainable and can be easily manipulated for vaccine formulation. CpG ODN 1826 therefore holds promise as an adjunct to our heroin vaccine \"cocktail\" as a means of further potentiating opioid-neutralizing antibodies.",

To assess vaccine performance in blocking the analgesic effects of heroin, vaccinated animals were subjected to two antinociceptive tests, hot plate and tail immersion. Full dose\u2212response curves and corresponding ED 50 values were generated to thoroughly test vaccine efficacy in a wide range of heroin doses, then repeated for selectivity against morphine and oxycodone. Results in the behavioral tests generally paralleled ELISA results. The vaccines showed varying degrees of shifting the heroin antinociceptive dose\u2212response to the right, with tail immersion being more responsive to the vaccines (Figure 2) . A significant effect of vaccination was observed based on the derived estimates of heroin's Table  2 . (Table 2 ; Tukey's test). Ip and ip/sc performances were fairly similar to one another and gave ED 50 values that were 7\u221210-fold better than those of naive animals (p < 0.01). Addition of CpG ODN 1826 increased ED 50 values by 5-fold in hot plate (p < 0.01) and 2\u2212 5-fold in tail immersion (p < 0.01) over alum alone. Similar antinociceptive testing was conducted for morphine as that for heroin, and a significant vaccination ANOVA was determined [hot plate, F 4,115 = 6.4, p < 0.001; tail immersion, F 4,135 = 10.9, p < 0.001]. Similar to previous findings, our original vaccine formulation is primarily more effective on heroin than morphine. No significant shift of morphine potency was found compared to naive, regardless of route of administration (Table S1 in the Supporting Information). However, the addition of the CpG ODN 1826 provided sufficient boosts in titer and affinity to generate a significant reduction in morphine potency, though only in the tail immersion test (p < 0.001). As expected, and in confirmation of the selectivity of the vaccine for heroin and its primary metabolites, no heroin vaccine treatment provided protection against oxycodone, a structurally similar opioid (Table S2 in the  Supporting Information) .",

Few studies have directly compared injection routes for drugs of abuse vaccines with the exception of one study that found intradermal (id) nicotine vaccine delivery to be effective compared to intramuscular (im). 23 However, id delivery is generally not compatible with alum adjuvant: a necessary component of our heroin vaccine. Although the im route was not investigated in the current study, previous studies have shown that im is comparable to sc in terms of vaccine immunogenicity. 24 Alum has been shown to stimulate dendritic cells (DCs) both intraperitoneally and subcutaneously through the NALP3 inflammasome, enhancing Th2 immune responses to the antigen. 25 Although a Th2 response was observed for both ip and sc administration routes, titers were 6-fold higher for ip. The difference in physiological environments between the subcutaneous tissue and peritoneal cavity may contribute to the observed discrepancy in ip versus sc immunization. The heroin\u2212KLH immunogen in the peritoneal fluid can drain directly to lymph nodes for immune recognition, 26 however, the large particle size of the immunogen when formulated with alum prevents immediate drainage out of subcutaneous tissue. 27 Consequently, the immunogen is taken up by DCs and transported to lymph nodes to evoke an adaptive immune response. 28 According to our study, immunogenicity of our heroin\u2212KLH immunogen is best achieved via intraperitoneal administration possibly due to more immediate drainage to lymph nodes. In sum, these findings stress the need for testing vaccination route in studying drugs of abuse vaccines, which could be especially important at the clinical level.",

While the sc immunized group exhibited higher opioid affinities and lower titers, analgesia testing demonstrated that the efficacy of the sc group was inferior to all other groups. Although the non-CpG groups appeared different in terms of titers and affinities, the hot plate test revealed no differences between the groups. The lack of efficacy in the hot plate test compared to tail immersion suggests a differential ability to block spinal reflexive analgesia, largely mediated by spinal \u03bc-opioid receptors, versus more complex pain-related behavior of hot plate that involves peripheral, spinal, and supraspinal processing. The hot plate test has also been found to be less sensitive compared to tail flick in reducing morphine-induced analgesic properties in \u03bc-opioid receptor deficient mice. 31 It should also be noted that, compared with previous titer and hot plate evaluation in rats using the same vaccination procedure, mice exhibit lower titer responses and less substantial shifts in heroin hot plate analgesia. 9 The large enhancement in vaccine performance from CpG ODN suggests that, when assessing a vaccine, >10-fold greater antidrug titers and affinities must be achieved to also present improved efficacy at the behavioral level. Moreover, previous evidence demonstrates that weak blockade by drug-directed vaccines tends to actually promote increased drug seeking, 32, 33 often leading to subjects adjusting dosing in order to supersede the vaccine. This necessitates rigorous behavioral testing over a wide range of doses to provide an accurate indication of vaccine efficacy in reducing drug psychoactivity.",
