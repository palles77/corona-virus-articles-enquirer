            "text": "Five reoviruses have previously been isolated from species of Hymenoptera, which appear to be non-pathogenic in their wasp hosts (Renault et al., 2005) . Three of these, Microplitis croceipes reovirus-like particles (McRVLP) (Hamm et al., 1994) , Hyposoter exiguae idnoreovirus (HeIRV) (Mertens et al., 2005c; Stoltz and Makkay, 2000) , and Opius concolor reovirus-like particles (OpRVLP) (Jacas et al., 1997) , use their wasp hosts as vectors, and do not appear to be involved in lepidopteran host defence suppression (Renault et al., 2005) . All three of these viruses were found in association with other viruses which facilitate the pathogenicity of the parasitoid against the wasp's lepidopteran host. For example, Stoltz and Makkay (2000) observed HeIRV and a DNA polydnavirus, H. exiguae polydnavirus (HePDV) replicating within the same cells of the parasitoid H. exiguae. A fourth virus, Diadromus pulchellus idnoreovirus-1 (DpIRV-1), has a commensal relationship with its host D. pulchellus, and is detected in most populations of this wasp species. DpIRV-1 is always associated with D. pulchellus ascovirus-4 (DpAV-4), which is indispensable for suppressing the immune system of the parasitoid's host. Although DpRV-1 has not been shown to directly increase the parasitic success of D. pulchellus, it may retard the replication of DpAV-4 within the lepidopteran host cells. This prevents rapid cell lysis, thereby enabling normal development of the wasp larva (Renault et al., 2005) . The fifth virus, D. pulchellus idnoreovirus-2 (DpIRV-2; Renault et al., 2003) , has a mutualistic relationship with D. pulchellus. Its injection by parasitoid females during oviposition is essential for suppressing the immune system of the parasitised lepidopteran host (Renault et al., 2005) .",

Recent studies have suggested that three types of relationship may occur between certain reoviruses and parasitoid wasps; non-pathogenic, commensal viruses (occur and replicate in wasp populations, and may be found in association with other types of viruses); putative mutualistic viruses (found in association with other viruses, but which do not appear to play a major role in host/parasitoid relationships); mutualistic viruses (not associated with other viruses, and contribute significantly to parasitoid success) (Renault et al., 2005) .

The presence of ObRV in adult winter moth also suggests transmission of the virus through lepidopteran life stages (Graham et al., 2006) . This shows similarity with infections caused by a cypovirus from D. pulchellus (Renault et al., 2003) , which was able to infect and multiply in lepidopteran gut cells after oviposition (Renault et al., 2003) , and assisted development of wasp larvae by down-regulating the immune response of the host. Interestingly, ObRV isolated from female wasps appears to contain a genome of 11 segments (Graham et al., 2006) . Studies on the hymenopteran D. pulchellus showed that the Idnoreovirus DpIRV-1 isolated from diploid wasps (female or sterile diploid male wasps) also contained an extra genomic segment of dsRNA when compared to virus isolated from haploid wasps (fertile males; Rabouille et al., 1994) . This extra segment is thought to provide additional nucleic information, necessary for the development of eggs laid by the female parasitoid in the lepidopteran host (Rabouille et al., 1994) . Unfortunately, during the course of this study, insufficient viral dsRNA was available from female P. tempestiva to sequence the 11th segment. As more reoviruses are being isolated from insects, and specifically from parasitic wasps, it is becoming clear that some may play a close and important role in ensuring the success of the parasitoid host, and that complex relationships have developed to increase the fitness of both parasitoid and virus.",

The dsRNA viruses use a viral RdRp to synthesis mRNA, functioning both as a transcriptase and replicase. The viral mRNA molecules can associate with other viral proteins to form large complexes. The viral RdRps can subsequently use these mRNAs as templates for the synthesis of complementary \u2212ve strands, reforming the dsRNA genome of the virus. Within the family Reoviridae, RdRp aa identity of over 30% groups members within the same genus, while members of distinct genera have aa identities lower than 20% (Attoui et al., 2000; Rao et al., 2003) . However, two exceptions to this rule have been discussed: these include aquareoviruses and orthoreoviruses, which clearly have a common ancestor with an aa identity of 42%; and rotavirus B which has only 22% identity to other rotaviruses. Amino acid identity values of between 19 and 27% were observed when comparing ObRV RdRp with the RdRps of the \"turreted reoviruses\", while the \"non-turreted reoviruses\" gave only 11 to 13% aa identities. These data indicate that ObRV does not belong to any of the existing genera of the Reoviridae family for which RdRp sequences are available. A comparison of the ObRV Seg-10 sequence with those in Genbank, generated no matches with other insect viruses.",

For example, Seg-10 of Choristoneura fumiferana CPV-16 and Antheraea mylitta CPV-4 are \u223c1.5 and \u223c1.2 kb, respectively, although they only encode proteins of \u223c260 aa in length (Echeverry et al., 1997; Sinha-Datta et al., 2005) , corresponding to the expected size of their respective polyhedrin proteins. Expression of the ORF confirmed that ObRV Seg-10 encodes a protein with a molecular mass of \u223c54 kDa, which did not form occlusion bodies in infected Sf-21 cells. Further analysis on the function of this protein remains to be done. The double-layered capsid, the non-occluded nature of ObRV (Graham et al., 2006) , phylogenetic analyses of the RdRp, and the expression analysis of VP10 all indicate that that ObRV was not a member of the genus Cypovirus.However, similarities were detected between VP2 from ObRV and VP2 protein from an Idnoreovirus (DpIRV-1), over the whole length of the molecule. VP10 of ObRV also showed similarities to VP10 (encoded by Seg-10) of DpIRV-1 protein again over the whole length of the molecule. Although the lack of sequence information from this genus (particularly the RdRp), makes it difficult to make further comparisons, the data presented here, together with the detection of an eleventh genome segment in female wasps (Graham et al., 2006) , suggest that ObRV represents a new member (a new species) within the genus Idnoreovirus, which contains other non-occluded insect reoviruses. In this case the isolate would belong to the species 'Idnoreovirus-6' and should be identified as 'Operophtera brumata idnoreovirus-6' (ObIRV-6). by a NERC non-thematic grant (NE/D008077/1) awarded to RDP, SMS and RSH.",
