By indirect immunofluorescence and immune precipitation, monoclonal antibodies of three viral polypeptide specificities were characterized. Monoclonal antibodies to nucleocapsid reacted in the cytoplasm of infected cells and precipitated the 60,OOOd nucleocapsid polypeptide (VP-4) of MHV-4. Other monoclonal antibodies reacted both in the cytoplasm and on the surface of infected cells and were found to precipitate the 170,OOOd viral glycoprotein (GP-1). A third set of monoclonal antibodies reacted both in the cytoplasm and on the surface of infected cells and precipitated the 25,OOOd viral glycoprotein (GP-5) and its precursor VP-6 (23,OOOd). Anti-GP-1 alone had direct neutralizing activity for MHV-4 virus, while in the presence of complement both anti-GP-1 and anti-GP-5 neutralized virus. Only anti-GP-1 had the ability to inhibit the spread of infection due to fusion in L241 cells. Thus, the viral glycoprotein GP-1 likely contains both the attachment and fusion activities of MHV-4.",

Strains of MHV exhibit distinct organ tropisms, being predominantly either hepatotropic or encephalitogenic, and may cause persistent infections in mouse colonies. MHV-4 (JHM strain) is an encephalitogenic strain which causes fatal acute encephalomyelitis following intracerebral inoculation in its natural host (Lampert et al., 1973; Weiner, 1973 destruction of oligodendrocytes (Haspel et al., 1978) . In viva studies with JHMV and its mutants may provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of human demyelinating diseases; however, a careful analysis of the pathogenesis of primary demyelination has been hampered by the lack of sensitive and specific probes for viral products as well as a firm understanding of coronavirus structure, replication, and mechanism(s) of persistence. Serologic evidence of infection and detection of virus antigens in target organs has been difficult to demonstrate due to the poor quality of serum antibodies elicited in mice. Antigens responsible for cross-reactivity among murine coronaviruses have not been well defined. The importance of making accurate comparisons is underscored by a recent report of serologic cross-reactivity between murine coronaviruses and two human coronavirus isolates from brains of multiple sclerosis patients (Burks et al., 1980) .",

L-241 cell monolayers in 24-well Linbro plates were infected at 50-100 PFU per well and incubated at 37\" for 1 hr. Inoculum was removed and culture medium containing serially diluted monoclonal antibody prepared as described above was added at the concentrations indicated and incubation continued for 22-24 hr at which time plates were fixed and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. The inhibition titer of monoclonal antibody was expressed as the highest dilution which inhibited the number of visible plaques and syncytia by 50%. Inhibitory effect of virus-specific monoclonal antibody on syncytium formation was also visualized microscopically by indirect immunofluorescence staining. After 6,9, and 12 hr of incubation in the presence of monoclonal antibody, coverslip cultures were washed three times in PBS and fixed in acetone. Fluorescent staining for detection of syncytia was performed using monoclonal antibody to MHV-4 nucleocapsid protein (4B-6.2).",

Neutralization tests employing several anti-GP-1, anti-GP-5, and anti-VP-4 monoclonals demonstrated that only anti-GP-1 possessed strong virusneutralizing activity. Antibodies to GP-5 did not neutralize virus infectivity unless complement was added to the r,eaction. Thus the virion polypeptide GP-1 probably contains the site of attachment of virion to host cell. One anti-GP-1 (5B-93.9) did not neutralize infectivity despite a binding titer of l/16,000. It is likely that this antibody recognizes an epitope on GP-1 that is unrelated to the attachment site. Blocking experiments utilizing 5B-93.9 to attempt to competitively inhibit binding to known neutralizing antibodies are currently under way to clarify this question. Despite their failure to neutralize, antibodies to GP-5 clearly bind to virions. The addition of fresh guinea pig complement to anti-GP-5 antibody + virus reaction mixtures resulted in virus neutralization comparable to that seen with anti-GP-1 antibody and this may reflect a lytic effect of complement on the virus.

            "text": "Virus-specific membrane antigens clearly also play a role in the intercellular spread of infection through the mechanism of cell fusion. Fusion activity has been described for many enveloped viruses. Among the paramyxoviruses this activity is the function of a distinct fusion glycoprotein (F,) (Homma and Ohuchi, 1973; Scheid and Choppin, 1974) . In the orthomyxoviruses a hydrophobic region of the hemagglutinin peplomer has fusion activity (Lazarowitz and Choppin, 1975; Klenk et al., 1975) . When we examined our collection of monoclonal antibodies for the ability to inhibit spread of infection, only anti-GP-1 was effective, suggesting that the virion peplomer contains the active site for cell-cell co % fusion. The mechanism by which anti-GP-1 inhibits spread is not clear. Anti-GP-1 may directly inhibit the molecular events of membrane fusion or may bind to a site which sterically hinders membrane penetration. Although our experiments suggest that GP-5 is not directly involved in cell fusion the possibility exists that GP-5 participates in events occurring after initiation of fusion by GP-1. Alternatively, expression of GP-5 at the surface of the infected cell may be merely a fortuitous occurrence. Recent data (Holmes et al., 1981) suggest that the GP-5, VP-6 complex E-l plays an essential role in the intracellular maturation of MHV. Thus surface expression of this polypeptide may reflect a breakdown in the normal pathways of glycoprotein expression in the infected cell. Clearly, monoclonal reagents will be valuable tools to probe the precise mechanisms of infection, cell-cell spread, and cell fusion by coronaviruses.",

Cells were infected with MHV-4, then pulse labeled with [%]methionine, and a cytosol extract prepared (shown in lane 1) and immunoprecipitated as described in the text. Monoclonal antibodies and their polypeptide specificity were 4B-6.2 (anti-VP-4, lane 2); 4B-11.6 (anti-GP-1, lane 3); 5A-13.5 (anti-GP-1, lane 4); 5A-5.2 (anti-GP-5, VP-6, lane 5); and 5B-128 (anti-GP-5, VP-6, lane 6). Background precipitation of GP-1 and VP-6 is evident in lane 2 and of VP-6 in lanes 3 and 4. Specificity controls included precipitation of control cell cytosol by monoelonal antibody to MHV (58-5.2) (lane 7) and precipitation of MHV-infected cytosol by monoclonal antibody to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV IIWE-6) (lane 8).",
