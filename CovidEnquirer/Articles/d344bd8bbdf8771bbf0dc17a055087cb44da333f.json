Tuberculosis (Mycobacterium tuberculosis; TB) is the second most common cause of death in the world, resulting in 3-4 million deaths annually and 8 million new cases a year. It is also the most common opportunistic infection associated with HIV. 9 This is not just a global threat, but a domestic one, with drug-and multidrug-resistant TB continuing as a significant public health concern. Of concern, extremely drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) is emerging. TB is often problematic to treat in the most common form; a strain that is resistant to most of the first-and second-line treatments could be devastating if allowed to go unchecked.",

Moreover, there continue to be outbreaks in the U.S. among unimmunized or inadequately immunized individuals. In 2006, a computer programmer from India infected with measles arrived in Boston, Massachusetts. 10 In response to his infecting several individuals, 23,000 doses of measles vaccine were ordered and/or distributed in anticipation of the potential for a significant public health crisis. Only 56% of infants in India are vaccinated against this potentially lethal pathogen, whereas 93% of U.S. children are. Measles is one of the top 5 causes of death worldwide for children. Clearly, global travel can bring infections from far-off lands into our waiting rooms and communities with relative ease! Malaria remains a significant global health problem and is vector borne. How many of us or our colleagues have seen or treated a case, yet it is one of the leading causes of death for children and adults worldwide. Plague remains a significant public health problem in selected nations worldwide, with sporadic cases occurring in the U.S., sometimes being diagnosed long distances away from where the infection occurred. Recall the couple visiting New York City who fell ill, only to be diagnosed with Yersinia pestis (plague), which they were exposed to from rodent excreta at the Southwest home.",

Evidence from subsequent outbreaks of H5N1 in Vietnam suggest changes in the virus consistent with this possibility. Of the latter two, the FDA recently approved an H5N1 vaccine, and H5N1 remains at the present inefficient at person-toperson transmission, albeit it is likely to acquire that ability given the adaptability of this virus. During that year, several persons became infected with an avian influenza strain that resulted in significant illness in chickens and resulted in the almost total destruction of Hong Kong poultry flocks in an attempt to contain the disease. It was a successful strategy, for the moment.",

A new Euro-African lineage of H5N1 has resulted in several fatal human infections in Egypt by 2007. 11, 12 Genetically the virus is becoming more antigenically diverse and forming distinguishable groupings. Genome analysis has shown that H5N1 now has 3 distinct lineages (clades) with sublineages and reassortment occurring. This is worrisome as it demonstrates the virus persisting and evolving. 12 In 2003 another pathogen became recognized as a global threat by the World Health Organization (WHO) with the potential to become a global pandemic-a novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), or SARS CoV. 13 The first known cases of SARS occurred in Guangdong province, China in November 2002. SARS CoV is believed to be an animal virus that crossed the species barrier to humans, perhaps as a result of ecological changes or human behaviors that placed people in greater proximity to coronavirus that lead to viral adaptation and subsequent human to human transmission. By July 2003, SARS CoV spread internationally and resulted in over 8000 cases in 26 countries with 774 deaths reported. 13 Although WHO considers the world to be in an inter-epidemic period, it remains difficult to predict when or if another SARS will emerge, let alone cause another outbreak, especially given that the natural reservoir of SARS CoV has not been identified or contained.",
