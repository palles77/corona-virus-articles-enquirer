The open reading frame (ORF) 7b of FCoV has been speculated to play a determining role in virulence as deletions were found to be associated with avirulent viruses. To further clarify the correlation between this gene and FIP, clinical samples from 20 cats that had succumbed to wet-type FIP and 20 clinically healthy FCoV-infected cats were analysed. The ORF7b from the peritoneal/pleural effusions of FIP cats and from the rectal swabs of healthy cats was amplified. Of the 40 FCoVs analysed, 32 were found to have an intact 7b gene whereas eight showed deletions of either three or 12 nucleotides. Surprisingly, among the eight viruses with deletions, three were from FIP diseased cats. These results show that deletions in the ORF7b gene are not constrained to low pathogenicity/enteric biotypes but also associated with pathogenicity/FIP biotypes of FCoV.",

            "text": "F eline coronaviruses (FCoVs) are enveloped viruses with a large, capped and polyadenylated RNA genome of about 29, 190 nucleotides. 1, 2 The FCoVs are group 1 coronaviruses, recently designated as members of subgroup 1a in the family Coronaviridae. Other members of this subgroup include transmissible gastroenteritis virus, canine coronavirus, raccoon dog coronavirus (RDCoV/GZ43/03), and Chinese ferret badger coronavirus (CFBCoV/ DM95/03). 3 The FCoVs associated with mild enteric infections and infectious peritonitis. 4 Infection of FCoVs is worldwide; the seroprevalence varies from around 30%, 5e7 to 80%. 8, 9 However, among the seropositive cats only a relatively small portion, eg, 5%, 8 11 .8% 10 and 15.4%, 6 develop FIP. Currently, it is speculated that the key pathogenic feature of FCoV to induce FIP is its ability to replicate to high viral loads in monocytes and macrophages. Enteric pathotypes are able to circulate in monocytes/macrophages, but that higher rates of replication and dissemination are seen in FIP pathotypes. 11e16 The ORF7b is located at the very 3'end of the FCoV genome, which encodes a 26.5-KDa non-structural glycoprotein. The function of glycoprotein 7b in the life cycle of FCoV is not clear. 17 It has been speculated that ORF7b plays a determinative role in FCoV virulence as viruses with a truncated gene have been found to be associated with enteric infection only. 18 Field FCoV strains of FIP cats analysed thus far all contain intact ORF7b. 19e24 In order to gain a better understanding of the correlation between ORF7b and the virulence of the virus, we investigated the ORF7b of FCoVs from clinical specimens from 40 cats, half from wet-type FIP animals and half from clinically healthy cats. In contrast to the previous finding, short deletions of the 7b gene of FCoVs in body effusions were detected from some of our FIP cats.",

Sequence analysis revealed that the ORF7b of the naturally occurring FCoVs was mostly intact (32/40). However, three-and 12-nucleotide deletions were found in one (NTU37A) and seven (NTU4P, NTU5A, NTU13R, NTU14R, NTU15R, NTU16R, NTU25R) FCoVs, respectively. Four isolates with the 12-nucleotide deletion originated from the same household, whereas remaining isolates had an unrelated origin (Fig 2A) . The two deletions are both located near the 5 0 terminus, covering positions 30e32 and 53e64, respectively; both are in-frame deletions resulting in loss of either one or four amino acids in the ORF7 protein.",

The full-length ORF7b gene consists of 621 nt, however, only partial sequences are available for comparison of some viruses. Of the total of 92 FCoVs analysed, deletions were identified in 13. Five of the 13 deleted viruses were laboratory strains, with eight from clinical specimens obtained in this study. On further examination, the length range of the deletions was 3e406 nt for these ORF7b-deleted FCoVs (Table 4 ). Five isolates with rather large deletions (56e406 nt) were all laboratory passage strains. 20 The only field viruses originating from FIP cats with deletions were the three identified in this study. The characteristics of our deletions are: (i) they are relatively short, eg, either 3 nt (NTU37A) or 12 nt (NTU4P, NTU5A); (ii) they are all in-frame deletions; and, (iii) in comparison to the downstream location for the major deletions in the laboratory strains, our deletions are all located near the 5 0 terminus of the gene, eg, nt 30e32 (NTU37A) and nt 53e64 (NTU4P, NTU5A).",
