Northern blot hybridizations using whole genomic RNA probes indicated that strains NS-1 and NS-2 had identical group A RNA electrophoretic patterns and were homologous at all gene segments. Strain NS-1 was compared with reference group A BRV strains using serological and genotypic methods. In vitro virus neutralization assays indicated that strain NS-1 was neutralized by a G6-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) and guinea pig hyperimmune serum (GPHS) raised against BRV strain B64t (P5:G6), but not by G10-specific neutralizing mAb or GPHS raised against BRV strain B223 (P1 I:G10). Nucleic acid hybridization experiments using whole-genomic RNA probes revealed that gene segment 4 of strain NS-1 differed from BRV strains NCDV-Lincoln and B223, but hybridized with strain B641. Conversely, gene segment 5 of strain NS-1 hybridized with BRV strain B223, but not with BRV strains NCDV-Lincoln and B641. A G-specific cDNA probe produced by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification of strain NS-1 hybridized specifically only with G6 strains NCDV-Lincoln and B641, but not with G10 strain B223. Co-electrophoresis experiments using strains NS-1, B641, and B223 further confirmed these results, suggesting that strain NS-1 was a naturally-occurring reassortant BRV between * Corresponding author.

            "text": "Bovine rotavirus is an important etiological agent of neonatal calf diarrhea worldwide. Economic losses due to BRV infection in the cattle industry include losses associated with retarded growth, medication costs and animal death. Rotavirus is a member of the Reoviridae family and the viral genome is composed of 11 segments of double-stranded RNA which are surrounded by a double-shelled capsid (Estes and Cohen, 1989) . Currently, rotaviruses are classified into 7 groups (A through G) based on antigenic differences on the inner capsid protein (VP6). Group A rotaviruses which are commonly associated with neonatal calf diarrhea (Theil, 1989) , contain 2 major outer capsid proteins, P or VP4 and G or VP7 encoded by gene segments 4 and 8 or 9, respectively (Estes and Cohen, 1989) . The P and G proteins contain antigenic epitopes which are involved in neutralization of viral infectivity (Hoshino et al., 1985; Offit et al., 1986) . Based on antigenic differences in the P and G proteins, group A rotaviruses have been classified into 11 different P-types and 14 different G-types (Estes and Cohen 1989; Isegawa et al., 1992; Hussein et al. 1993; Parwani et al. 1993) .",

Mortality records were not available from ranch 1. On ranch 2, 11.6% of the calf crop developed diarrhea at approximately 21 days of age and 25 % of the affected calves died as a result. Fecal samples obtained from calves with diarrhea on each ranch were submitted to the Nebraska Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory System for routine laboratory examinations.

The inoculated cultures were maintained at 37\u00b0C and examined daily for cytopathic effect. After 6 days, the cells were frozen and thawed 3 times, and the lysate was passaged onto fresh monolayers 2 more times. The presence of rotavirus was confirmed by staining infected monolayers with fluorescein-conjugated calf anti-BRV antibodies (FITC-Calf anti BRV; National Veterinary Service Laboratory, Ames, IA). Cytopathic BRV isolates, designated Nebraska Scottsbluff 1 (NS-1 ) and NS-2 from ranch 1 and ranch 2 respectively, were plaque purified after the third passage, as previously described (Hoshino et al., 1984) . Virus stock was kept at -20\u00b0C until needed. The RNA from each field BRV strain was extracted with phenol-chloroform and their RNA electrophoretic patterns were compared with reference BRV strains after separation on a discontinuous, vertical sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE) (10% resolving, 5% stacking) run in Tris buffer (0.025 M Tris, 0.192 M glycine, 0.1% SDS [pH 8.3] ) at 4\u00b0C using a constant current of 30 mA (Biorad Protean II electrophoresis unit, Biorad, Richmond, CA).

Three weeks after the last booster injection and 2 days prior to harvest of splenocytes, the mice were immunized intravenously with NCDV-Lincoln diluted in PBS.

After denaturation at 80\u00b0C for 5 min, purified viral RNA from strains NS-1, B641, NCDV-Lincoln and B223 was used as RNA template and reverse transcribed (RT) into single stranded cDNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as described by the manufacturer (GeneAmp RNA PCR kit, Perkin Elmer Cetus, Norwalk, CT) using a thermal cycler (GeneAmp TM 9600, Perkin Elmer Cetus). The final volume of the RT mixture was 20/xl [2.5 U//xl reverse transcriptase, 5 mM MgC12, 1 \u00d7 PCR buffer, 1 mM dNTPs, 1 U//zl RNase inhibitor and 50 pmol of each primer]. Incubation time and temperature for RT were 25 min at 42\u00b0C, 5 min at 99\u00b0C and 5 min at 4\u00b0C. The resulting cDNA was amplified by adding Taq polymerase and the volume of the PCR reaction was adjusted to 100/zl (final concentration: 2 mM MgC12, 1 \u00d7 PCR buffer and 2.5 U/100/zl Tag polymerase). Amplification consisted of 30 cycles with 40 sec at 94\u00b0C for denaturing; 1 min at 42\u00b0C for annealing and 2 min at 72\u00b0C for extension in each cycle. The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels (Seaplaque GTG, FMC Rockland, ME) and transferred to nylon membranes by Southern blotting. The PCR amplified cDNA fragments from strains NS-1 and B223 were purified from agarose gel (BIO 101, LA Jolla, CA), and labelled with a-32p-dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham) using an oligo-labelling kit (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, Piscataway, NJ).

Gene segment 5 of strain NCDV-Lincoln cross-hybridized with that of strain B641, but not with strains B223 and NS-1. Conversely, gene segment 5 of strain B223 hybridized with that of strain NS-1. Our results thus indicate the existence of at least 2 different gene segment 5 among group A BRV. Gene segment 5 encodes the nonstructural protein NS35 (Estes and Cohen, 1989) , but the exact function of this protein in the biology of rotavirus infection is unknown. However, it has been noted that gene segment 5 displays non-random segregation during rotavirus mixed infections in vivo and in vitro (Gombold and Ramig, 1986) . It is possible that strain NS-1 gained a selective advantage over other strains of BRV carrying NCDV-Lincoln gene segment 5.",

Rotavirus reassortants have been made experimentally using in vitro and in vivo methods (Gombold and Ramig, 1986; Urasawa et al., 1986; Hesse et al., 1993) . Based on this evidence, a rotavirus strain potentially can contain any combinations of genes in nature. Naturally-occurring rotavirus reassortants with gene segments derived from different human rotaviruses have been reported (Matsuno et al. 1988; Nakagomi and Nakagomi, 1991) .

            "text": "Currently, prevention of rotavirus-associated neonatal calf diarrhea is based on passive protection by maternal antibodies following immunization of the dam (Sharpee et al., 1988; Saif and Jackwood, 1989) . Calves are protected from rotavirus infection when receiving colostrum containing high titer of rotavirus-specific neutralizing antibodies. It is well established that the P and G proteins have antigenic epitopes involved in neutralization of viral infectivity in vitro and protection in vivo and can segregate and elicit neutralization antibodies independently (Hoshino et al. 1985; Offit et al., 1986) . Although the information on homotypic and heterotypic immunity and protection is incomplete, it is likely that passive protection with monovalent vaccine is effective only against challenge with BRV homologous to the vaccine strain at the P and G genes. In the United States, commerciallyavailable rotavirus vaccines for cattle contain only strain NCDV-Lincoln. However, it is now becoming clear that in contrast to natural recovery from infection which results in high titers of P-specific neutralizing antibodies, parenteral immunization primarily elicits Gspecific neutralizing antibodies (Shaw et al., 1988; Richardson et al., 1993; Ward et al., 1993) . Differences in P proteins has been proposed as a possible mechanism responsible for a lack of cross-protection in vivo between G6 BRV strains NCDV-Lincoln and B641 (Zheng et al., 1989) . We have shown that strains NS-1 and NCDV-Lincoln belong to the same G6, but differ at gene segment 4 encoding the P protein, and gene segment 5 encoding protein NS35. Our results are in agreement with the assumption made by Zheng and coworkers (1989) , and further suggest that failure of passive protection provided by monovalent vaccine could result from infection of susceptible calves with a BRV containing a P gene different from the vaccine strain. The benefits from vaccination with monovalent vaccine for prevention of BRV-associated diarrhea in neonatal calves may be less than optimal due to diversity of P-and G-types occurring in nature.",
