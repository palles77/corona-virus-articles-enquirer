Of the diseases HAP contributes to, pneumonia has the largest impact on children (Gordon et al., 2014; Smith et al., 2014) .

A number of HAP-specific studies have found such an association (Dherani et al., 2008; Smith, 2000) . However, evidence from randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) has been inconsistent with observational studies (Mortimer et al., 2017) . Intention-to-treat results for RESPIRE in Guatemala yielded inconclusive results for pneumonia, but severe pneumonia showed significant results. Exposure-response analyses in RESPIRE, however, did find a significant relationship with pneumonia (Smith et al., 2011) . A small subset of air pollution studies has specifically investigated the etiology of HAP-associated pneumonia. The RESPIRE study, for example, found a decrease in severe respiratory syncytial virus negative (RSV-) pneumonia with lower levels of HAP exposure, but no impact on severe RSV+ infections. Other studies suggest that air pollution exposure may increase susceptibility to bacterial pneumonias, but not viral pneumonias (Rylance et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2011; Zhou and Kobzik, 2007) .",

Pathogens migrate to the lower airways by aspiration or by contiguity (Barson et al., 2014) . Infection of the lower airways ultimately leads to pneumonia. Mechanistic studies have shown that HAP is associated with higher bacterial abundance (Rylance et al., 2016) , and impaired macrophage response (Rylance et al., 2015; Zhou and Kobzik, 2007) in the lower airways. Less is known about the relationship between HAP and microbes in the upper airways, which mechanistically precedes lower respiratory infections. Pneumonia incidence has been on the decline worldwide, which has been attributed both to increased vaccine uptake and also to improved nutrition (Rudan, 2008; Walker et al., 2013) . Development and uptake of the pneumococcal and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccines have changed the distribution of attributable fractions of pneumonia by microbe, with higher viral proportions in vaccinated populations (Barson et al., 2014) . Ghana has been particularly successful in its national childhood vaccination efforts, especially in rural areas (Asuman et al., 2018) . In our Ghana cohort, we have found that 91.4% of our rural participants received the three scheduled pneumococcal vaccines by the child's first birthday. Therefore, Ghana serves as an opportunity to understand the role of HAP in pneumonia etiology in a high vaccination environment.",

Fieldworkers referred suspected cases to a study clinic for clinician diagnosis and treatment. Nasopharyngeal swabs were taken for all clinician-diagnosed cases. Fieldworkers then identified healthy infant controls, who were also sent for nasopharyngeal swabs. The fieldworkers chose healthy controls that were the same sex and close to the same age as the case, prioritizing those living in the same (or a neighboring) community. A total of 669 unique samples were catalogued and stored for future analysis. Samples were stored in a \u2212 80 \u00b0C freezer until microbial profiling, except for transport to the Unites States when on dry ice. With resources to analyze 290 samples, a computer-generated random selection of swabs selected 145 pneumonia cases, and their matched controls, for PCR analysis (Fig. 1) . Swabs were only selected from the LPG and 3-stone arms of the study to maximize the exposure contrast among samples. We determined that fieldworker selection of controls did not achieve sufficient balance on matching variables, so a \"nearest neighbor\" algorithm was used to perform a 1:1 match of each pneumonia case with its nearest control. The nearest neighbor algorithm finds the closest possible match between participants in the dataset based on chosen covariates, in our case, minimizing the difference between age and sex. We then removed all repeat pneumonia cases (swabs from reoccurring pneumonias), with their associated healthy controls, to preserve independence and given prior literature on altered microbiomal development with prior infection (Bosch et al., 2017) . Our final sample consisted of 130 pneumonia cases and 130 healthy controls for our intention-to-treat analysis.",

The population density measure was constructed using mapped census information from the Kintampo Health and Demographic Surveillance System. A 100-meter radial buffer was created around each home to aggregate the number of individuals within 100 m of the reference household using a spatial join. The season of swab was based on the date of an infant's swab, comparing the Harmattan/dry season to the non-Harmattan/wet season. Ultimately, we found that the season of swab was the only potential confounder variable correlated with the exposure and the outcome, identified via univariable regressions with p-values < 0.05. Season of swab was included in the final regression analyses. Age at swab and sex were also included in the analysis given a priori knowledge of relationships with the exposure and outcome.",

Further, MassTag PCR, while a powerful tool, provides coarse measures of microbial diversity. Results from the MassTag PCR can only provide a binary outcome on a fixed library of microbes. Presence of a microbe at one time point may not provide adequate information to infer causal mechanisms; instead, it is preferred to confirm microbial presence over time as well as density of colonization. Finally, our analysis utilizes samples from the nasal epithelium whereas pneumonia occurs in the lower respiratory tract.

Our findings support an association with HAP exposure and bacterial nasal carriage, which is on the pathway to pneumonia. This provides additional evidence on the ways in which HAP may be altering pneumonia susceptibility. This is an important area of investigation given the vast burden of disease caused by HAP, specifically on young children. However, given the null results in exposure-response analysis, it is likely that a pollutant besides CO is driving these differences. Identification of the etiologic relationships between HAP and pneumonia may spur advancements in vaccination, infection control, or allow for refined burden of disease estimates, which can support targeted public health initiatives.",
