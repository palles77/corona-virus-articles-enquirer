To identify molecules regulating peripheral B cell survival and tolerance to self-antigens (Ags), a gene modifier screen was performed with B cells from CD22-deficient C57BL/6 (CD22 \ue032/\ue032[B6] ) mice that undergo activation-induced cell death (AICD) and fail to up-regulate c-Myc expression after B cell Ag receptor ligation. Likewise, lysozyme auto-Ag-specific B cells in Ig Tg hen egg lysozyme (HEL) transgenic mice inhabit the spleen but undergo AICD after auto-Ag encounter. This gene modifier screen identified EndoU, a single-stranded RNA-binding protein of ancient origin, as a major regulator of B cell survival in both models. EndoU gene disruption prevents AICD and normalizes c-Myc expression. These findings reveal that EndoU is a critical regulator of an unexpected and novel RNA-dependent pathway controlling peripheral B cell survival and Ag responsiveness that may contribute to peripheral B cell tolerance.",

For the B cell lineage, the optimal outcome of these processes is a diverse antibody (Ab) repertoire purged of pathological (self-reactive) B cells. The elimination of pathological B cells occurs either through clonal deletion or receptor editing during B lymphopoiesis in the bone marrow, or in the periphery through the induction of anergy (Goodnow et al., 1988; Nemazee and B\u00fcrki, 1989; Gay et al., 1993; Tiegs et al., 1993) . Anergic B cells primarily inhabit the spleen, are short-lived, and undergo activation-induced cell death (AICD) in response to B cell Ag receptor (BCR) stimulation (Goodnow et al., 1995; Shlomchik, 2008) .",

            "text": "BCR ligation by agonistic anti-IgM Abs induces 30-50% of spleen B cells from WT mice to blast and undergo proliferation ex vivo (DeFranco et al., 1982) . However, the threshold for B cell AICD can be influenced by genetically altering the stimulatory and inhibitory pathways that regulate BCR-induced activation (Inaoki et al., 1997) . The B cell-restricted surface protein CD22 is generally considered to negatively regulate BCR signaling by recruiting potent intracellular phosphatases after BCR ligation (Doody et al., 1995; O'Keefe et al., 1996; Otipoby et al., 1996; Sato et al., 1996; Nitschke et al., 1997; Tedder et al., 1997; Poe et al., 2000) , and CD22 \ue032/\ue032 mice produce augmented levels of isotype-switched auto-Abs against DNA and some protein Ags (O'Keefe et al., 1999; Poe et al., 2011) . Nevertheless, B cells from inbred CD22 \ue032/\ue032 mice with a B6/129 genetic background (CD22 \ue032/\ue032 [inbr] ) are phenotypically and functionally normal ex vivo (Poe et al., 2004) . In contrast, spleen B cells from C57BL/6 (B6) mice genetically deficient in CD22 (CD22 \ue032/\ue032[B6] ) undergo AICD after BCR stimulation (Poe et al., 2004) , which is likely to be a result of their inability to induce c-Myc transcription factor expression that balances B cell proliferation versus AICD (Donjerkovi\u0107 and Scott, 2000; Poe et al., 2004) . These striking phenotypic differences in B cells between mouse lines with a common deletion of Cd22 indicate that important B cell signaling events that promote AICD are influenced differently by the B6 and 129 genetic backgrounds. These two CD22 \ue032/\ue032 mouse lines were therefore used to identify genetic and molecular factors regulating B cell AICD.",

Therefore, a forward genetic linkage analysis was used to identify the gene locus/loci responsible for CD22 \ue032/\ue032[B6] B cell AICD. Genome-wide genotyping of 250 informative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between the B6 and 129 mouse strains used genomic DNA from 44 CD22 \ue032/\ue032[N1] mice; 22 mice had viable B cells after BCR ligation, whereas 22 mice had B cells that underwent AICD (Fig. 2 C) . Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping regression analysis revealed a single locus with high logarithm of odds (LOD) scores (P < 10 \ue0326 ) on the distal end of chromosome (Chr) 15 ( Fig. 2 D) , (C) Purified spleen B cells or CD4 + T cells were cultured alone or with F(ab') 2 anti-IgM Abs or mitogenic CD3 mAb, respectively, for 18 h. Total cellular proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes and Western blot analysis using polyclonal anti-EndoU Ab. The arrow indicates the position of the major EndoU band, which was dominant in CD22 \ue032/\ue032[B6] B cells. A nonspecific band (n.s.) is present in all lanes that is also observed when the secondary detection Ab is used alone as a control to probe CD22 \ue032/\ue032[B6] B cell lysates (far right lane).

A single gene was differentially expressed between mouse lines, with 4.4-fold higher (Fig. 3 A) . B cells from WT [B6] mice expressed EndoU at lower levels than B cells from WT 129 (WT [129] ) mice before and after BCR ligation ( Fig. 3 To ensure that EndoU protein levels correlated with gene overexpression in CD22 \ue032/\ue032[B6] B cells, an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal Ab specific for recombinant EndoU was generated. Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates confirmed increased EndoU expression in both resting and BCRstimulated CD22 \ue032/\ue032[B6] B cells relative to CD22 \ue032/\ue032[inbr] B cells ( Fig. 3 C) . EndoU overexpression in CD22 \ue032/\ue032[B6] mice was B cell specific, as EndoU levels were modest in activated spleen T cells from CD22 \ue032/\ue032[B6] and CD22 \ue032/\ue032[inbr] mice. Remarkably, EndoU was also overexpressed in B cells from Ig Tg sHEL mice both before and after BCR ligation but was nearly undetectable in B cells from Ig Tg littermate mice ( Fig. 3 D) . Thus, B cell EndoU overexpression required both a homozygous B6:B6 EndoU locus in CD22 \ue032/\ue032[B6] and Ig Tg sHEL mice that correlated with their characteristic AICD phenotypes.",

Highly conserved EndoU orthologs are found in many advanced and primitive species (see Fig. 8 A; Renzi et al., 2006) , but EndoU paralogs derived from ancestral gene duplications do not exist in mice. The Xenopus ortholog of EndoU, XendoU, has been defined as an endonuclease targeting ssRNA molecules harboring polyuridine (poly(U)) regions (Renzi et al., 2006) . Because EndoU substrates have not been defined in other species and EndoU-related molecules that could share redundant activities are not found in mice, the ability of EndoU to bind and/or process XendoU ssRNA substrates was examined. Recombinant EndoU protein specifically bound poly(U) ssRNAs, but not ssRNA species lacking these sites ( Fig. 3 E) . However, EndoU did not cleave these poly(U) ssRNAs, even A targeting vector was generated that contained a neomycin-resistance gene (neo r ) introduced into two unique BsmBI restriction sites, which introduced an in-frame termination codon. A thymidine kinase gene (tk) was inserted at the 5\ue039 end of the EndoU gene sequence. (B) Homologous recombination of the targeting vector into the EndoU gene of heterozygous and homozygous offspring expanded the endogenous 7.5 kb HindIII digested genomic DNA fragment into an 8.5 kb fragment as assessed by Southern blot. (C) Appropriate targeting of the EndoU gene was further confirmed by PCR analysis (primer locations shown in A), whereby a common forward primer (PCR1) was used in combination with reverse primers either adjacent to (PCR2) or within (PCR3) the neo r gene. Results show amplification of genomic DNA from WT, heterozygous, and homozygous offspring.

Like the XendoU ssRNA substrate, c-Myc mRNA was also bound by recombinant EndoU (Fig. 3 F) , but mRNA cleavage was not detectable (not depicted). Thus, c-Myc mRNA is a potential EndoU substrate, which may explain reduced c-Myc expression when B cells overexpress EndoU. Further supporting this notion, ectopic EndoU expression in mouse NIH-3T3 fibroblasts significantly reduced c-Myc protein levels (Fig. 3 G; 32% decrease, P < 0.05).",

EndoU-deficient mice were generated by appropriately targeting the EndoU gene on B6 Chr 15 (Fig. 4, A-C) . PCR-based SNP genotyping of genomic DNA from targeted mice confirmed that the targeted EndoU locus was B6 in origin. The chimeric mice were then bred onto a B6 genetic background to generate EndoU \ue032/\ue032[B6] mice that were homozygous B6:B6 throughout the 93.3-98.3 Mbp Chr 15 region (unpublished data). The absence of EndoU protein in homozygous gene-targeted mice was confirmed by Western blot analysis, which identified an appropriately sized protein in WT mice (Fig. 4 D) . EndoU from CD22 \ue032/\ue032[B6] B cells and thymocytes migrated more slowly on SDS-PAGE gels (\ue07a50 kD band) than EndoU from CD22 \ue032/\ue032[inbr] thymocytes (\ue07a48 kD band, Figs. 3 C and 4 E), due to a nonsynonymous SNP present within EndoU exon 2 which switches a single Glu (B6 mice) to Lys (129 mice). This was verified using A/J mice that share the EndoU SNP sequence with 129 mice, with EndoU from both CD22 \ue032/\ue032[inbr] and A/J mice migrating identically (Fig. 4 F) (Fig. 5 A) . AICD was also reversed in B cells from EndoU \ue032/\ue032 CD22 \ue032/\ue032[B6] mice with normal BCR-induced blast development (Fig. 5 B) and proliferation (Fig. 5 C) . c-Myc expression was also normalized in BCRstimulated EndoU \ue032/\ue032 CD22 \ue032/\ue032[B6] B cells relative to CD22 \ue032/\ue032[B6] B cells (Fig. 5, D and E) . EndoU may preferentially regulate and high CD5 and HSA expression, with low spleen B cell numbers (Fig. 6, E and F) . The frequency of IgM a-high B cells in augmented-responder mice (11% \u00b1 2.1%) was significantly greater than the frequency of IgM a-high B cells present in Ig Tg sHEL mice (2.2 \u00b1 0.5%, P < 0.01). Thus, the normalized phenotype of high-responder EndoU \ue032/\ue032 Ig Tg sHEL mice and the IgM a-low CD5 high HSA high phenotype of augmentedresponder EndoU \ue032/\ue032 Ig Tg sHEL B cells suggests differential sensitivities to auto-Ag exposure.",

            "text": "EndoU was identified in a gene modifier screen as a unique and potent regulator of B cell AICD. In WT [B6] mice, EndoU transcription and protein expression were suppressed by the balance between tonic BCR signals and their modulation by CD22, permitting normal BCR-mediated responses without blatant AICD after BCR ligation. In contrast, heightened BCR signals in peripheral B cells of CD22 \ue032/\ue032[B6] mice drove EndoU overexpression and the CD5 high HSA high phenotype with predominant AICD after BCR ligation. Genetic deletion of EndoU expression reversed the CD5 high HSA high phenotype of B cells from CD22 \ue032/\ue032[B6] mice and normalized AICD, confirming its important regulatory function in these processes. Bona fide EndoU substrates are likely to include c-Myc and other regulatory transcripts in vivo because c-Myc EndoU \ue032/\ue032 Ig Tg sHEL mice expressed relatively high surface IgM a levels and bound fluorescently labeled HEL protein at similar high levels ( Fig. 7 A) , suggesting that their BCRs were not occupied by sHEL. In contrast, B cells from both Ig Tg sHEL and augmented-responder EndoU \ue032/\ue032 Ig Tg sHEL mice maintained an IgM a-low phenotype and did not bind labeled HEL protein, indicating BCR occupancy by sHEL. Dye-labeled spleen B cells from high-responder EndoU \ue032/\ue032 Ig Tg sHEL mice were also adoptively transferred into WT or sHEL transgenic mice (Fig. 7 B) . There was a dramatic reduction in IgM levels and HEL-binding capacity for high-responder B cells recovered from sHEL recipients in comparison with WT recipients (Fig. 7, B and C) . Thus, the absence of AICD in high-responder EndoU \ue032/\ue032 Ig Tg sHEL mice promoted auto-Ab production and endogenous sHEL clearance in vivo.",

Genetic deletion of EndoU normalized this B cell phenotype in a substantial number of Ig Tg sHEL mice, which correlated with robust anti-HEL auto-Ab responses at an early age in mice that were defined as high responders. In augmented-responder EndoU \ue032/\ue032 Ig Tg sHEL mice, some B cells expressed normalized phenotypes, suggesting that some B cells escape from an AICD phenotype with age to generate higher anti-HEL auto-Ab levels than Ig Tg sHEL mice. Given the linkage between EndoU, c-Myc up-regulation and AICD, it is likely that decreased B cell AICD in EndoU \ue032/\ue032 Ig Tg sHEL mice leads to increased numbers of B cells that eventually consume endogenous sHEL auto-Ag, permitting clonal expansion with a resultant increase in anti-HEL auto-Ab production.",

            "text": "The divergence of phenotypes between high-responder and augmented-responder mice has precedent based on previous studies. For example, Ig Tg sHEL mice deficient in the inositol phosphatase PTEN have reduced BCR occupancy by sHEL and produce anti-HEL auto-Abs at a higher level than Ig Tg sHEL mice. This results in a subsequent break in tolerance in some mice caused by depletion of available sHEL auto-Ag (Browne et al., 2009) . Likewise, Ig Tg sHEL mice transgenic for CD19 overexpression progressively break tolerance as they age and eventually produce high anti-HEL auto-Ab levels (Inaoki et al., 1997) . In fact, remarkably similar to EndoU \ue032/\ue032 Ig Tg sHEL mice, CD19 Tg Ig Tg sHEL mice develop as both high-and augmented-responder mice by 2 mo of age. Thus, modest increases in B cell numbers or enhancement in auto-Ab production resulting from altered B cell signaling can lead to auto-Ag depletion. Once this initial reduction in sHEL levels occurs, the resulting lack of B cell anergy enables peripheral B cell numbers to be maintained at a level that exceeds sHEL production, resulting in sustained and high-level anti-HEL auto-Ab production. Thereby, the EndoU regulatory pathway is likely to be an important component of B cell tolerance regulation, which is consistent with the known polygenic origins of autoimmunity.",

A regulatory role for c-Myc in the mouse WEHI-231 B cell model of AICD has been previously described (Sonenshein, 1997; Donjerkovi\u0107 and Scott, 2000) . In CD22 \ue032/\ue032 mice, EndoU overexpression and AICD required B6 homozygosity at the EndoU locus. Therefore, genetic alterations must exist within the EndoU locus between the B6 and 129 genetic backgrounds that positively influences EndoU [B6] allele transcription in B cells, but not T cells. Although the EndoU locus has yet to be finemapped or sequenced in 129 mice, these important regulatory elements are likely to be located within the numerous stretches of conserved noncoding DNA present within the Figure 7 . sHEL auto-Ag consumption occurs in high-responder EndoU \ue032/\ue032 Ig Tg sHEL mice. (A) Blood cells from the indicated genotypes were stained with fluorescently labeled HEL protein, and with IgM a and B220 Abs. Top panels show dot plots for HEL and B220 staining in the lymphocyte gate, with bottom panels representing the cells in the top panels with additional gating on B220 + cells only. Results are representative of three mice of each genotype producing similar results. (B) Purified spleen B cells from high-responder EndoU \ue032/\ue032 Ig Tg sHEL mice were labeled with cell tracking dye and adoptively transferred into the peritoneal cavities of either WT or sHEL recipient mice. After 36 h, peritoneal cavity cells were harvested from recipient mice and stained with fluorescently labeled HEL protein or IgM a Abs. Results represent one of two independent adoptive transfers producing similar results.

Solid black line, donor cells recovered from the WT recipient mouse; solid gray line, donor cells recovered from the sHEL recipient mouse; dashed line, background staining of B220 + cells in the WT recipient mouse. Results represent one of two independent adoptive transfers producing similar results. EndoU transcripts expressed in mouse B cells encoded a protein of 454 amino acids, which includes an N-terminal somatomedin B-like domain believed to be involved in protein-protein interactions (Gijsbers et al., 2003) , a XendoU Superfamily ssRNA-binding domain, and a predicted transmembrane domain. EndoU specifically interacted with an ssRNA substrate harboring U-rich sequences that is also bound by Xen-doU, which is implicated in small nucleolar RNA processing in Xenopus (Gioia et al., 2005; Renzi et al., 2006) . XendoU apparently generates snoRNAs through the cleavage of pre-mRNAs encoded within introns (Laneve et al., 2003) . Human EndoU may exhibit low-level U-directed ssRNA endoribonuclease activity against the same in vitro ssRNA substrates recognized by XendoU (Laneve et al., 2008) . However, mouse EndoU did not demonstrate measurable endonuclease activity against XendoU substrates. Mammalian EndoU may thus be functionally distinct from its Xenopus ortholog because human EndoU is excluded from the nucleolus of multiple cell lines (http://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000111405/subcellular).",

Although Nsp15 is required for viral replication, specific Nsp15 substrates have not been identified and, surprisingly, appear to exclude the viral genome itself (Ivanov et al., 2004) . Nsp15 has been postulated to suppress host immune responses (Ricagno et al., 2006) and to facilitate apoptosis in cells expressing the MAVS (mitochondrial anti-viral signaling) adapter protein that induces host anti-viral responses (Lei et al., 2009) . Mouse hepatitis virus is also a member of the nidovirus family, is lymphotropic, and induces immunosuppression at least in part through the elimination of developing B cells (Lamontagne et al., 1989; Jolicoeur and Lamontagne, 1994) . It therefore remains possible that mouse EndoU and hepatitis virus Nsp15 may target similar ssRNA substrates in B cells despite their evolutionary divergence.

Furthermore, these studies suggest an EndoU, CD22, c-Myc, and CD19 regulatory loop that directs normal B cell survival and malignant transformation (Fujimoto et al., 1999; Poe et al., 2012) . EndoU likely regulates c-Myc and potentially other crucial ssRNA (mRNA or pre-mRNA) transcripts and nonclassical ssRNAs that directly regulate or fine-tune specific subsets of genes required for optimal B cell proliferation and survival. For autoreactive B cells that survive central selection and inhabit peripheral tissues, EndoU overexpression has nonetheless evolved as a checkpoint protein within the complex pathway that keeps potentially pathogenic B cells at bay through deletion via AICD.",

CD22 \ue032/\ue032[F1] mice were then backcrossed to CD22 \ue032/\ue032[B6] mice to generate genetically dissimilar N1 littermates (CD22 \ue032/\ue032[N1] ) that were used for QTL mapping. (B) Spleen B cells from CD22 \ue032/\ue032[N1] mice were assessed for CD5 expression before BCR stimulation and for blast development after BCR stimulation as in Fig. 1. B cells from some CD22 \ue032/\ue032[N1] mice were anergic (were CD5 high and underwent AICD [7AAD + FSC low ] after BCR stimulation; top), whereas others had a normal phenotype (were CD5 low and developed into blasts [7AAD \ue032 FSC high ], bottom). Results are representative of those obtained from >40 CD22 \ue032/\ue032[N1] littermates assessed in 10 independent experiments. (C) Survival analysis of BCR-stimulated B cells from CD22 \ue032/\ue032[N1] littermates used for genomic SNP genotyping. Results are pooled from 10 independent CD22 \ue032/\ue032[N1] mouse B cell blast assays (open squares), as described in B. Each value represents a single mouse, with dashed boxes distinguishing between CD22 \ue032/\ue032[N1] littermates having B cells sufficient in blast development (top box), or insufficient in blast development (bottom box). Shown for comparison are the parental mouse B cells assessed in each of the assays as controls: CD22 \ue032/\ue032[B6] B cells (apoptotic, black diamonds) and CD22 \ue032/\ue032[inbr] B cells (viable, gray circles). (D) QTL mapping results from the 44 CD22 \ue032/\ue032[N1] experimental mice shown in C, revealing a Chr 15 locus with a LOD score peaking at >12 (P < 0.000001, \ue078 2 statistic, MapManager QTX permutation test). The Cd22 gene location (Chr 7) is indicated. (E) Detailed heat map display of the Chr 15 mapping data shown in D. The locus of significance was defined by four consecutive SNPs positioned at 68, 71, 78, and 91 Mbp with LOD scores of 8.3-12.6. Columns represent individual CD22 \ue032/\ue032[N1] mice, with blue squares indicating homozygous B6:B6 SNP loci and red squares indicating heterozygous B6:129 SNP loci. Representative genotypes of parental CD22 \ue032/\ue032[B6] and CD22 \ue032/\ue032[inbr] mice are shown at the right, with green squares indicating regions of 129 homozygosity. (F) Refined PCR-based SNP mapping of the Chr 15 locus of CD22 \ue032/\ue032[N1] mice at 1 Mbp intervals from 78 to 102 Mbp. Open squares represent SNPs that were not assessed. (G) B cells from an additional 59 CD22 \ue032/\ue032[N1] mice were identified as viable or apoptotic in addition to the 44 CD22 \ue032/\ue032[N1] mice shown in C-F. All 103 mice (55 with viable B cells and 48 with apoptotic B cells) were then assessed at 0.25-1 Mbp resolution by PCR-based SNP genotyping within the proximal (93.3 Mbp) to distal (98.3 Mbp) region of Chr 15.",

The increased LOD score at 91 Mbp resulted from two mice (#14 and 28) with additional crossovers that were concordant with the observed phenotype. Parental CD22 \ue032/\ue032[B6] mice were homozygous B6:B6 within the identified locus (68-91 Mbp), whereas CD22 \ue032/\ue032[inbr] mice were homozygous 129:129. All other SNPs on Chr 15 outside of this locus (3.8-53 and 102 Mbp) were homozygous B6:B6 in all mice. Therefore, the primary genetic element responsible for CD22 \ue032/\ue032[B6] B cell AICD was located within a 24 Mbp region. To narrow the 78 to 102 Mbp Chr 15 locus, 23 additional SNPs within this region at 1 Mbp intervals were genotyped in the original 44 N1 mice.

CD22 \ue032/\ue032[F1] mice were then backcrossed to CD22 \ue032/\ue032[B6] mice to generate genetically dissimilar N1 littermates (CD22 \ue032/\ue032[N1] ) that were used for QTL mapping. (B) Spleen B cells from CD22 \ue032/\ue032[N1] mice were assessed for CD5 expression before BCR stimulation and for blast development after BCR stimulation as in Fig. 1. B cells from some CD22 \ue032/\ue032[N1] mice were anergic (were CD5 high and underwent AICD [7AAD + FSC low ] after BCR stimulation; top), whereas others had a normal phenotype (were CD5 low and developed into blasts [7AAD \ue032 FSC high ], bottom).

Results are pooled from 10 independent CD22 \ue032/\ue032[N1] mouse B cell blast assays (open squares), as described in B. Each value represents a single mouse, with dashed boxes distinguishing between CD22 \ue032/\ue032[N1] littermates having B cells sufficient in blast development(top box), or insufficient in blast development (bottom box).
