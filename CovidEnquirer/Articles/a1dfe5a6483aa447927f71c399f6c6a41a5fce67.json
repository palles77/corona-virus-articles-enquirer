However, in the case of the 2009 World Games, the first international hallmark sporting event in Taiwan, the volume of hotel occupancies and revenue fell short of expectations, despite 4 years of planning and an investment of US$218 million. This study set out to investigate this phenomenon by adopting semistructured interviews to gather opinions from key stakeholders regarding their business operation and societal conditions. Factors contributing to the lower than expected revenue included inefficient collaboration among stakeholders, a substantial displacement effect to regional hotel competitors, and the unfriendly local atmosphere associated with the fear of H1N1, Typhoon Morakot, and controversial political events. To mitigate inefficiencies from stakeholder collaborations, the study results suggest greater equality in terms of responsibility, information distribution, and risk sharing is needed among the broader tourism industry, the event planning association, and the event supervising authority. In addition, business strategies should take into account Taiwan, an island destination, and current tourism characteristics to counter the displacement effects of loyal and potential customers.",

In particular, hosting mega-and hallmark events is perceived as an important vehicle for tourism development because it facilitates an increase in tourist numbers, the generation of a positive destination image, and the development of areas (Fourie & Santana-Gallego, 2011; Getz, 2008) . According to Teigland (1999) , the tourism demand pattern of special events follows two forms: a \"new plateau\" scenario and a \"back to normal\" alternative. The former represents increased tourist volume after the hosting of mega-events because of increased awareness of the destination, improved attractions and infrastructure, and an extensive transportation system established during the hosting, from which the destination builds up its competitiveness among other tourist destinations. The \"back to normal\" scenario, on the other hand, implies that a big tourism boom is realized during the event period; however, the demand related to tourism services and goods reverts to pre-event levels after the occasion is completed. A bell-shaped curve of the tourist flow over time is thus observed. The main factor that determines the reduction of tourist demand is a decreased destination awareness among potential tourists when media attention switches to other upcoming events.",

This research line can be divided into two categories. The first research direction emphasizes the economic impact analysis associated with the expenditure of participants using empirical numbers to demonstrate the contribution of sales, personal income, and value added generated by the event. The applications include mega-events (such as the Olympics or FIFA World Cup), hallmark events 1 (such as the Commonwealth Games and World Games) and small-scale regional sports competitions (Connell & Page, 2005; Daniels, 2007; Daniels, Backman, & Backman, 2003; Daniels & Norman, 2003; Dwyer, Forsyth, & Spurr, 2006; Gratton, Dobson, & Shibli, 2000; Gratton, Shibli, & Coleman, 2006; Jones & Munday, 2004; Lee & Taylor, 2005; Manzenreiter, 2008; Preuss, 2007; Ryan & Lockyer, 2001; Wilson, 2006) . From Teigland's (1999) perspective, this type of quantitative practice is used to measure the magnitude of the economic peak during the once-only impulse of a sporting event, as these studies capture a snapshot of economic changes on-site during a relatively short period.",

            "text": "The commonality of both study lines generally acknowledges a tourism demand peak during the event; however, the magnitude of visitor influx or the level of \"big tourist boom\" was inconsistent in various ex-post impact reports. By using visitor numbers or hotel occupancy as measurement variables, the following studies presented a less optimistic result regarding short-term tourism impacts during the event. Du Plessis and Maennig (2011) indicated that the total number of attendees at the 2010 FIFA World Cup (WC) was only one-third of the most conservative ex-ante expectation. Porsche and Maennig (2008) argued that the tourism, employment, and income effects of the 2006 WC were not realized and the greatest outcome of this event was the \"feel-good\" effect. Manzenreiter (2008) showed that monthly foreign visitor numbers to Japan during the 2002 WC were no different to other months in the same year for the host country. Allmers and Maennig (2009) , using monthly overnight non-resident stay data, demonstrated that the 1998 WC did not produce any statistically significant effects on local hotel suppliers. Porter and Fletcher (2008) pointed out that, during the 1996 Summer Olympics, the occupancy rate in Atlanta rose slightly (2.9%). Similarly, Teigland (1999) indicated that the 1994 Winter Olympic Games was a disappointment for several hotels in the host regions, especially for hotels located approximately 20e25 min away from the city center because a strong concentration effect was observed in which visitors occupied hotels that were close to the event venues. This type of general pessimism is also supported for other major sporting events, as Matheson and Baade (2006) and Porter (1999) reported insignificant visitor spending and hotel occupancy rates during the US Super Bowls. Of course, there is supporting evidence regarding short-term positive, significant, and satisfactory tourism effects, including the 1976 Montreal Olympics (Whitson & Horne, 2006) , the 1994 World Cup (Baade & Matheson, 2004) , the 1997 Flora London Marathon (Gratton, Shibli, & Coleman, 2004) , the 2000 Summer Olympic Games (Drayton, 2000) , and the 2002 Winter Olympic Games (Porter & Fletcher, 2008) .",

Hosting the 2009 World Games (WG), the first international hallmark sporting event in Taiwan, was no different in seeking the same objective. However, despite 4 years of preparation, heightened media attention, and investments of US$218 million, the ex-post analysis for the 2009 WG revealed that the local accommodation sector did not achieve a satisfactory performance with regard to hotel receipts and occupancy rates, nor was an enduring short-term accommodation demand observed afterward. This pattern of the 2009 WG was consistent to the literature on the insignificant tourism effects associated with major sporting events, signaling that a \"big tourist boom\" scenario was not realized.",

However, because each region embraces different economic relationships and unique interactions of stakeholders, case studies of individual scenarios shall be adopted and elaborated to provide an insight into factors that may help to address the unsatisfactory tourism performances and lay out the interconnected components (d' Angella & Go, 2009; Solberg & Preuss, 2007) . Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explore factors that may help to address this unexpected short-term soft occupancy rate in the host city by interviewing representatives of the local business sector and municipal government. The study contributes to the literature by deviating from the research agenda of the previous studies, which generally analyzed highly aggregated econometric data without direct contacts with business enterprises. 2 Through industry and event organizer interviews combined with secondary information, this study provides insights specifically into the accommodation phenomenon. Additionally, the context focuses only on hallmark sporting occasions instead of mega-events, as the former type is the prime target for small economic entities to compete for the right of hosting. Aim of this study is to assist planners of similar future events to improve their forecasting efforts, decisions, and concepts.",

In June 2004, the official announcement from the IWGA declared that Kaohsiung City had won the bid and the host region received a considerable amount of national publicity because this opportunity represented the first international multi-sport event ever held in Taiwan. This event was scheduled for July 16e26, 2009 and offered a diverse program with the greatest number of competing sports in the history of the WG. For the host government, this represented an excellent opportunity to market the national brand name and generate significant social, cultural, and economic benefits for the region. One major objective in hosting the WG was to revitalize the image of Kaohsiung and attract significant visitor numbers and spending during and after the event (Wu & Chu, 2010) . A high tourism volume was eagerly anticipated because the host region was anxious to transform its economic base from traditional manufacturing production to service and tourism economics. To cope with this special event, the central government and the Taiwan Tourism Bureau laid out a series of campaigns to promote tourism and attract foreign visitors. An investment of US$30 million on world-wide tourism promotional campaigns and activities was implemented in 2008 and 2009. This marketing campaign aimed to attract over 4.25 million tourists to Taiwan in 2009, where two major sporting events, the World Games in Kaohsiung and the Deaflympics in Taipei, were highly regarded (International World Games Association, 2007; The China Post, 2007) .",

To arrange complimentary accommodation for all WG participants, the KOC chose to use existing hotel facilities in Kaohsiung City, instead of school or athlete dormitories. To accommodate the large volume of guests, KOC contracted with 8 tourism hotels, 16 general hotels, and 3 publicly owned accommodation facilities in Kaohsiung City. The tourism hotels are 4-or 5-star hotels, serving mainly inbound visitors and high-end domestic tourists (Taiwan Tourism Bureau, 2008e2010) . The general hotels were small-scale hotels with a main market focus on group travelers based on discounted prices. The accommodation providers that cooperated with the KOC were the main stakeholders in the region for room capacity and service quality, and were members of the Kaohsiung Hotel Association. The contracted room prices were predetermined by the KOC as follows: US$90, US$73, and US$55 per night, differentiated based on the quality of the hotel facility. Each hotel was first evaluated by the KOC for qualification, and the business then determined the number of rooms that they reserved for the KOC during the 2-week period.

The historical data indicated that tourism hotels and general hotels in Kaohsiung generally exhibited superior performance than the national average for monthly occupancy (Fig. 1 ). In particular, during April and May 2009, 5-star hotels in Kaohsiung had an excellent season, reaching over 75% occupancy, and performed 7%w10% higher than the national average (Taiwan Tourism Bureau, 2008e2010). However, this trend did not continue. For the month of the WG in July, the occupancy rate of Kaohsiung tourism hotels was 64%, and the general hotels reported 47% occupancy, which was only 2% and 4% higher than the national average respectively. The hotel demand of the 2009 WG did not fit the profile of a bell-shaped demand curve proposed by Teigland (1999) . After the event, occupancy in the Kaohsiung area continued to drop and reached its lowest point in September, during which the performance was inferior to the national average. Compared with the 2008 data, the monthly sales of the tourism hotels decreased by 15% from October to November 2009, indicating a weak tourism demand immediately following the event (Taiwan Tourism Bureau, 2008e2009).",

In reality, the total number of WG guests and their overall length of stay were much lower than the KOC had previously anticipated. This resulted in low occupancy of reserved rooms. In addition, under the contract with the city government, the unoccupied rooms were not able to be released during the event and the loss of sales was not compensated by the government either. Many managers said that they understood that 100% occupancy was unfeasible, but that an occupancy of 67% from the WG guests and athletes was very disappointing because they did not receive any compensation from the government for any unused reserved rooms.",

Based on managers' opinions, a number of customers were discouraged to stay locally mainly because regional service providers had offered a much more attractive room price, around US$50eUS$71, which were 37%e11% cheaper than those in the host city. In addition, Kaohsiung hotels experienced a 20% price increase during the WG event, whereas the tourism hotels in Tai-Nai and Kaohsiung County only increased their room prices by 3% and 18% from the previous month. From the perspective of the accommodation sector in Kaohsiung City, an elevated room price was a normal business practice because local hotels all expected that the WG would generate an influx of domestic and international visitors who were willing to pay premium prices to be part of this event. Members of the Kaohsiung Hotel Association had a mutual agreement that the high-season room price would be charged during the event period, especially as they felt that July was already a popular travel season for families during the summer break irrespective of the highly anticipated WG spectators.",

Their position was that each WG event bore a prestigious image, serving as an excellent attraction in itself. Therefore, all event spectators purchased WG tickets independently through a nationwide convenience store network, disregarding their choices of lodging and transportation. Not being able to promote local accommodation services with WG tickets meant that there was no incentive for visitors to stay locally. These aforementioned factors together led to switching behavior of tourists during the event, which resulted in good revenue for hotels located about 30 min away at the expense of low occupancies of hotels in the host city.",

This destruction led to a negative destination image for Kaohsiung City and deterred domestic travel to the area even though all tourism services and attractions were fully functional and accessible in the city (Ko, 2010) . In addition to the weather factor, the visit of a political figure, the Dalai Lama, to Kaohsiung City from August 31 to September 4, 2009, and the public screening of the controversial Kadeer film \"The Ten Conditions of Love\" during mid-October 2009, both of which were administered by the local government, triggered heated political disputes. Both the Dalai Lama and Kadeer were regarded by the Chinese government as instigating rebellion, and any international recognition given to them would trigger retaliation as these events were perceived by the Chinese government as interference in domestic affairs. The controversy surrounding both events was reported to have hindered the cross-straits relationship as well as bilateral tourism volume between Taiwan and mainland China (McDonald, 2009) . Strong rebukes of Kaohsiung City by mainland China were observed through the cancellation of official business visits and diversion of Chinese leisure travelers to other regions in Taiwan without stopping in the city.

When the KOC was entrusted with the responsibility for arranging complimentary lodging services for all WG participants, the agency decided to enter into contract with the local accommodation sector. The initial planning was offered as goodwill for the regional economy because it was assumed to guarantee an ensured amount of sales to local businesses. This concept was originally welcomed by small-scale general hotels and further embraced by 5-star tourism hotels when the KOC and city government officials provided repeated and friendly invitations for them to join the project. The social and intellectual capitals, at that stage, were firmly established when both bodies exchanged trust and mutually agreed that provision of high-quality accommodation services with a large capacity was the core objective of the project. At that moment, the hotel sector trusted the arrangement of the KOC and optimistically believed the contracted rooms would be utilized and this cooperation would benefit business greatly in terms of revenue generation and brand name promotion.",

The last rule was against a typical booking requirement as most hotels would ask for advance payment and a penalty would apply if customers did not show up. One driving factor for the KOC to impose such an atypical restriction was that all of the operations of the 2009 WG were 100% government funded. This required the KOC to comply with the Taiwan Government Procurement Act by paying only for products or services that were transacted (Ministry of Justice, 2011). For rooms that were not used by WG participants, the transaction was not realized and, under these circumstances, the KOC was unable to make final payments.",

Under this condition, the KOC was able to reserve a more than sufficient number of hotel rooms without concerns for the possible penalty for unoccupied units. Consequently, this put the KOC in a safe position because any last-minute WG athletes or VIPs would be guaranteed a room, especially when the IWGA was not able to deliver the final list of guests on time because of technical problems with the registration system. The social capital, flow of information and communication, at this stage, started to demonstrate an unbalanced pattern as the IWGA and KOC were not able to synchronize the information on exact checking-in of guests and their length of stay to the businesses in advance, creating vulnerability for the hotel owners as they were not in direct control of occupancy. Since the opening ceremony, the trust between the KOC and hotels began to deteriorate, especially for those that faced a larger percentage of empty reserved rooms. The disappointing hotel revenue caused arguments between the two parties and threatened the mutual trust and possibility of future cooperation. The goodwill of the KOC, that is, providing the room contracts to local hotel businesses, triggered a chain reaction in which the hotel businesses turned down reservations for group customers 3e6 months prior to the event, raised the room price because they expected individual customers to pay premium prices for limited room capacity, and then suffered revenue losses due to empty reserved rooms and the turning away of group and potential customers. Before we comment further on this contracting and risk issue, the accommodation system and policies of the 2010 FIFA World Cup are presented first to provide parallel perspectives.",

MATCH is 100% share-owned by a UK company, Byrom PLC, and has also been the official supplier of accommodation for the six previous World Cups (Rose, 2010) . The inclusion of such an official accommodation service provider generates a capacity to the following: (1) involve various hotel operators, ranging from hotel chains and universities to small, medium, and micro-enterprises (SMME) with FIFA accreditation for the guarantee of quality; (2) offer package deals that combined accommodation, entertainment, and air travel to ensure high attendance at the tournament; and (3) provide free marketing displays for the hotels on the FIFA website, which helped to gain extensive international exposure (Cornelissen, 2009) . Although MATCH was praised for its inclusion of SMME, MATCH's policy created financial burdens on the accommodation providers because it forcefully stipulated the 2010 FIFA room prices as \"the June 2007 room rate plus a 16 percent mark-up\" for business operators, and a 30% commission fee was required on top of the net payable FIFA WC rate (Darkey & Horn, 2009; Jago, Dwyer, Lipman, van Lill, & Vorster, 2010; Rose, 2010) . The strict accommodation provision agreements led to an outcry from the industry as they complained that the rate was artificially too low, and they felt that MATCH had taken the cream of the accommodation crop as MATCH's profit would be diverted to a UK-based company.",

First, the development of package deals, combining ticketing, accommodation, air travel, and entertainment services, is necessary to provide a strong incentive to ensure high attendance and spending at the tournament. The success of this type of tour package signals a means to diversify revenue income for the hotel because they can benefit from the provision of associated recreational services. This premise, however, requires close cooperation among the KOC, IWGA, and the local hotel industry to create an image of the \"official suppliers\". We observed that the KOC website advertised 30 local hotels disregarding whether they have cooperated with the KOC. In other words, no marketing advantages were created solely for those businesses that were contracted. Therefore, one way to assist these partners is to arrange marketing campaigns and price discounts to foster the exclusiveness and competitive advantages of these operators under the banner of the \"official World Games accommodation service provider\". This would contribute to their brand name promotion in addition to revenue generation.",

Although limited by the Taiwan Government Procurement Act, paying only for services that are transacted, it is recommended that the room price policy should consider the probability of noshows or shorter stays, and raise the contracted room rate proportionally, instead of being arbitrarily determined by the KOC alone. In the example of the 2009 WG, approximately one-third of the reserved rooms were unoccupied, suggesting that the official room rate set by the KOC could be raised upward of at least 30%. With brand name promotion, revenue diversification, and contract price adjustment, the cooperation among the KOC, IWGA, and local hotel entities would represent one step toward a fair status in terms of responsibility, information distribution, revenue generation, and risk sharing.",

            "text": "Because the 2009 World Games was the first international hallmark event for Taiwan and Kaohsiung City, the local business sectors had no previous experience to draw on. Their current business strategies did not adequately adjust to the characteristics of a small island economy in response to large events, rendering their operation at a disadvantage. Observation of the 2009 WG indicated a high percentage of day trips (82%) and a strong displacement effect among individual and group customers to the nearby counties. These customers preferred to commute to the city center instead of staying locally (Sun, 2010) . For the first factor, it is crucial for the hotel industry to recognize that Taiwanese event spectators are currently dominated by local residents, followed by regional domestic visitors and very limited numbers of international travelers. Based on a study of four major cultural festivals in Taiwan, local residents accounted for 30%e60% of total event participants, whereas international travelers comprised less than 4% (Outdoor Recreation Association, 2005) . Although the 2009 WG was a larger scale event with intensive international media exposure, its spectators still conformed to this pattern, showing relative percentages of 57%, 41%, and 3% from local residents, domestic visitors, and international visitors on party trips (Sun, 2010) . In terms of the displacement effect, it has been cited by many researchers as a key factor in leading to less optimistic visitor numbers during the event (Baade & Matheson, 2004; Du Plessis & Maennig, 2011; Fourie, Siebrits, & Spronk, 2011; Manzenreiter, 2008; Porter, 1999) . This concept was first raised by Crompton (1995 Crompton ( , 2006 , as the hosting of a sporting event may drive away potential visitors who may otherwise have come to the community. In the observation of the authors, the crowding-out effect of the WG did not completely drive spectators away (to cancel their visit), but it reduced their willingness to stay locally and shortened their length of stay in the host region. The displacement of tourism is not only observed between cities (regions) but also over time in this instance. From the location perspective, contrary to some literature indicating a strong concentration effect on demand for staying close to the sporting venues (Drayton, 2000; Teigland, 1999) , in the case of the 2009 WG, accommodation located about 30 min away was perceived as a good alternative to stay overnight for some spectators. This displacement effect by location can be explained by the island and tourism characteristics of Taiwan. The small and highly populated country has an extensive transportation network of high-speed rail, public transportation, and highway systems, allowing travelers to bear relatively cheap switching costs in terms of time and monetary expenses (Huang & Tai, 2008) . In addition, the pricing practice of hotels located around 30 min away from the host city remained relatively constant and cost-effective during the event period, thereby offering a strong \"pull factor\" in relation to centrally located hotels.",

In contrast to individual travelers, group customers follow a pre-determined itinerary, and it is difficult to rearrange their accommodation choice once determined. In other words, if accommodation operators observe that their occupancy is less than expected, it is less likely that they can re-secure group customers even if discounted prices are offered. Therefore, the refusal of group customers must be approached with caution as it is against the practice of risk-aversion.",

In coping with these factors, business operation should acknowledge that a high-season room price strategy should be adopted cautiously in Taiwan during the event period. Although local hotels only raised their room rates by 20% during the month of the WG, which is far from the price gouging phenomenon reported in the related literature, the optimistic expectation of all WG spectators paying for premium prices in Kaohsiung is still challenged. Thus, it is necessary to allow a flexible yield management strategy to adjust room price based on unoccupied units over time. In addition, the yield management strategy should simultaneously consider the room inventory allocation in relation to customer segments. The retention of loyal patrons or group customers should be maintained and targeted because this core market provides an ensured amount of sales and revenue intake, serving as a safety net in securing minimum business revenue, even if they produce a less profitable yield. Last and most importantly, offering travel deals that combine accommodation services with exclusive event tickets, complimentary transportation, or souvenirs should be strongly promoted from the business operation itself. These exclusive and quota-limited travel deals should demonstrate the value of staying locally to counter the price advantage of regional hotel competitors.",

Apart from the uncontrollable natural and social factors, practical lessons have been drawn from this World Games experience. First, a hierarchical top-down structure between the event supervising authority, the event organizer, and the broader tourism industry should be avoided. This imbalance of power has been criticized at the 2010 FIFA World Cup (Darkey & Horn, 2009; Rose, 2010) , and the dominance of the international sports federation and the government organizing committee has also been identified in this example. This is where the future host country should be cautious about. Second, a community must host events that fit their capabilities to benefit from sports tourism (MacLaurin & Matthews, 2006) . One type of capacity lies in the ability to recognize the island and tourism characteristics in shaping their pricing and reservation strategy. For Taiwan, adopting a proper fee strategy, retaining a proportion of group customers, and offering travel deals for exclusive admission tickets or transportation would assist the local businesses to counter the displacement effects of loyal hotel demands to regional competitors.",

The interaction of stakeholders, the consequence of policy, and the influences of the societal environment should be carefully considered as each experience, based on different contexts, provides a foundation for shaping the next successful event. Lastly, although economic impact analysis (EIA) is a standard evaluation tool and is widely applied to understand the economic influences of event hosting (Porter & Fletcher, 2008) , EIA only yields estimates on sales, income, jobs, and value added. These figures simply reveal the partial information of event impacts. Therefore, combining the quantitative economic impact results with qualitative stakeholder opinions will help the planning organization and local businesses to develop a clear perspective in the bidding for and hosting of hallmark sporting events.",
