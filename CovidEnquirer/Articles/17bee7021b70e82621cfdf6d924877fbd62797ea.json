The frequency of NIP cells among blood cells is low, at most 40-110 per 105 PBMC and each NIP cell was found to produce several units of IFN. We have shown that NIP cell frequency and IFN yield per cell gradually increased with the age of the donor animals, from the neonatal period to the adult age, with a significant increase around puberty. Our present results also indicate that NIP cells may be influenced by physiological and genetic factors; thus ( 1 ) NIP cell frequency and IFN yield per cell were decreased during lactation; (2) Chinese (Meishan) pigs were found to have higher NIP cell frequency and IFN yield per cell than European ( Large White) animals.

Human IFN-a-producing cells in response to herpes simplex virus (HSV) are very infrequent ( 1 per 1000 PBMC ), but highly efficient, blood mononuclear cells, producing 1-2 IFN-a units per cell (Cederblad and Alm, 1990) . These particular cells have been referred to as natural interferon a producing (NIP) cells (Ronnblom et al., 1983 ) . The NIP cells, which circulate throughout the body and are able to produce high levels of IFN without being infected by the inducer virus, are likely major components of the early non-specific antiviral defense mechanisms.",

Thus it has been only recently observed that the frequency of human NIP cells was lower in AIDS patients than in healthy control individuals, each cell producing a lower amount of IFN-a (Howell et al., 1991 ) . The frequency of NIP cells was also shown to be lower in premature infants than in term infants or than in adults . Finally, it was suggested that stress such as transportation could impair porcine NIP cell functions (Artursson et al., 1989) . The present study describes an age-related increase of porcine NIP cell frequency and of IFN yield per cell, from the neonatal period to the adult age.

The Abs were combined with three different peroxidase-conjugated Abs: FI 7, K9 or M7. Four combinations of two Abs were found to allow the detection of porcine NIP cells as brown spots on nitrocellulose: either C21-F 17 ( 1 st and 2nd Ab ) or K9-F 17 or F17-K9 or C2 l-M7. Among those, the best results were obtained with K9 or C21 MoAb on solid phase with F17 as peroxidase-conjugate, K9-F17 giv-ing the most pronounced and visible spots. When PBMC were TGEV-induced as described in Materials and Methods, and transferred onto nitrocellulose-bottomed plates at different times (from 1 h to 26 h) after induction, the number of positive spots peaked at 8 h and then declined (not shown). In all successive experiments, PBMC were therefore transferred for ELISPOT assay after 8 h of TGEV-induction. Under such conditions porcine NIP cells appear to be infrequent cells among PBMC since the mean frequency of NIP cells per 105 PBMC obtained from 29 Meishan (MS) pigs was 71 _+ 30 as determined with K9-FI 7 MoAbs and 63.7 +_ 29.8 when C2 l-F17 Abs were used. Table 1 shows that the frequencies of NIP cells were lower in PBMC collected from young Large-White (LW) animals ( 10 weeks old) than in PBMC obtained from adult sows (P< 0.01, by Student's t-test). From the number of NIP cells per culture, as determined by the ELISPOT assay, and the amount of IFN present in culture supernatant, as determined by the antiviral bioassay, it is possible to estimate the amount of IFN produced by each NIP cell. Results in Table 1 show that the IFN yield (units per NIP cell) was also lower in young animals than in sow PBMC cultures (significantly different values obtained on 10 weeks old animals and on adult sows: P<0.01 ). In addition, the NIP cell frequency was lower among PBMC as compared with plastic nonadherent cells (Table 1 ) . Age-related variations in IFN-o~ production were also studied on MS pigs from the age of 3 weeks after birth until the age of 40 weeks, and on adult MS sows. Figure 1 shows that the frequencies of NIP cells were rather constant during several weeks after birth and then gradually increased to the age of 40 weeks, at which the frequency was about the same as the one observed in adult sows in gestation (110+66 NIP cells per 105 PBMC). The NIP cell frequency was significantly higher (P< 0.01, by Student's I test ) after 20 weeks of age than at 3 weeks of age. A peak of NIP cell frequency was observed at Weeks 23 and 26 of age, the last value ( 155 _+ 91 ) being significantly higher (P<0.05) than the mean frequencies observed at Week 20 (37_+ 10) and",

Our results indicate that the frequency of TGEV-induced NIP cells is very low among blood mononuclear cells: at most 20-40 per 105 cells from European LW adult pigs (Table 1 ) and 100-110 per 105 cells from Chinese MS adult animals (Fig. 1 ) . In the human species, the frequency of HSV-induced NIP cells, as assessed by ELISPOT assay, by in situ hybridization with IFN-a specific probes or by immunochemistry with specific antibodies, was also shown to be low: 2-55 per 104 PBMC (Cederblad and Alm, 1990; Feldman and Fitzgerald-Bocarsly, 1990) . The nature of this infrequent cell population remains partially unknown: thus, human NIP cells were shown to lack specific cell surface markers for B-, T-, NK-cells or monocytes but to express low levels of the CD4 molecule (Sandberg et al., 1989 (Sandberg et al., , 1990 Feldman and Fitzgerald-Bocarsly, 1990) . TGEV-induced porcine NIP cells were also described as non-T non-B cells expressing the CD4 surface marker (Charley and Lavenant, 1990) . It is likely therefore that a similar infrequent blood cell population is responsible for IFN-a production in several animal species following induction by different RNA or DNA viruses. We also show in Table 1 that porcine NIP cells are plastic non-adherent cells. Furthermore, removal of plastic-adherent mononuclear cells increased markedly the NIP cell frequency, which suggest that adherent PBMC could exert inhibitory effects on NIP cells. In addition, our present data indicate that each individual TGEV-induced porcine NIP cell was able to secrete several units of IFN (Table 1 and Fig. 2) , as shown for HSV-induced human NIP cells by Cederblad and Alm ( 1990 ) .",

Moreover, we have described age-related gradual increases for both parameters, with a significant enhancement of IFN yield and NIP cell frequency beginning between 17 and 20 weeks of age for MS and LW pigs. Since LW pigs were not vaccinated and MS animals received the initial vaccine injection at the age of 22 weeks, the gradual increases observed cannot be explained by possible effects of vaccination. Interestingly, it is known that sexual maturity takes place at 3 months in MS pigs (Legault and Caritez, 1983) . Our present data therefore suggest possible influences of sexual maturation on IFN-a production, especially around puberty. Age-dependent modifications of NIP cell numbers have been described in the human species: demonstrated that the frequency of HSV-induced NIP cells was very low in premature infants and significantly higher in term infants and in adults. Several other immune functions are known to vary with the age: thus, in the porcine species, the immune system is immature at birth and will acquire fully effective functions within several weeks after birth (reviewed in Blecha and Charley, 1990) . It is possible to speculate that a lower number of circulating NIP cells, as evidenced in this study, could contribute to the higher susceptibility of young animals to viral infections. However, in the case of the TGEV experimental infection, young pigs were shown to be able to produce high amounts of IFN-a in vivo (La Bonnardi6re and Laude, 1981) .",

Such breed differences may reflect host genotype influences on IFN-a production as already described in the mouse (De Maeyer and De Maeyer-Guignard, 1988 ) . In addition, it would obviously be interesting to know if MS pigs are more resistant to viral infections than LW animals.",
