Mortality remains high. Factors associated with mortality include a need for invasive mechanical ventilation, organ dysfunction, older age, frailty or poor performance status, delayed intensive care unit admission, and acute respiratory failure due to an invasive fungal infection or unknown cause. In addition to appropriate antibacterial therapy, initial clinical management aims to restore oxygenation and predict the most probable cause based on variables related to the underlying disease, acute respiratory failure characteristics, and radiographic findings. The cause of acute respiratory failure must then be confirmed using the most efficient, least invasive, and safest diagnostic tests. In patients with acute respiratory failure of undeter mined cause, a standardised diagnostic investi gation should be done immediately at admission before deciding whether to perform more invasive diagnostic procedures or to start empirical treatments. Collaborative and multidisciplinary clinical and research networks are crucial to improve our understanding of disease pathogenesis and causation and to develop less invasive diagnostic strategies and more targeted treatment options.",

            "text": "A growing number of adults have immune dysfunction. 1 Up to 5% of the general population are cancer survivors, 2 transplantation is on the rise, 3 and immunosuppressant drugs are being used for more indications. 4 Moreover, intensive treatments now improve disease-free survival, 2 but also increase the risk of life-threatening events, many of which affect the lungs. [5] [6] [7] [8] Acute respiratory failure can be defined as a triad of clinical signs, radiographic findings, and gas exchange alterations. Most patients present with newly developing or worsening respiratory symptoms over a period of 7 days. Severe acute respiratory failure manifests as respiratory distress with severe tachypnoea, laboured breathing, and recruitment of accessory respiratory muscles. Various patterns of pulmonary infiltrates might be seen, the most common of which are diffuse bilateral infiltrates. 9 Patients with acute respiratory failure require oxygen therapy and most studies of acute respiratory failure included patients receiving \u22656 L/min of standard oxygen. However, depending on the country and number of available hospital beds, patients with acute respiratory failure can be managed on wards, in intermediate care units, or in intensive care units (ICUs). Overall, the need for ICU admission, need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), or mortality increase with the required oxygen flow. 10 Thus, for patients that require 6 L/min of standard oxygen or more, need for intubation throughout the ICU stay and mortality before hospital discharge are up to 40%. 9-16 Delayed ICU admission has been associated with increased mortality. 13, 14, 17 Immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory failure can be encountered by all clinicians in their daily practice. In this Review, we look at the epidemiology, outcomes, and diagnostic investigations in immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory failure, with emphasis on the broad range of causes that must be considered. We discuss the role for invasive and non-invasive tests in identification of the cause of acute respiratory failure, although the huge diversity of tests available for each cause, coupled with the scarcity of randomised controlled trials, creates major challenges. We also suggest an approach to the management of hypoxaemia based on the latest literature.",

For instance, an acute hypoxaemic episode can lead to respiratory distress within a few hours, whereas a subacute or non-acute lung insult of similar magnitude can result in deep hypoxaemia without signs of respiratory distress. Overall, degree of hypoxaemia reflects the extent of lung involvement. Hypoxaemia, measured directly as the PaO 2 on room air or assessed on the basis of the oxygen flow needed to achieve an peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) of 95% or the estimated or calculated ratio of partial pressure arterial oxygen and fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio), has been used for many years to risk-stratify patients and guide ICU admission decisions. Increased oxygen flow has been associated with the need for ICU admission, 10 need for IMV, 10,16 and hospital mortality. 17 Similarly, lower PaO 2 /FiO 2 has been associated with mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, 40 the need for non-invasive ventilation (NIV), 41 or failure of high-flow nasal oxygen therapy (HFNO). 42 Persistent tachypnoea has also been associated with failure of standard oxygen, 42 NIV, 41 or highflow nasal cannula, requiring the imple mentation of another strategy (eg, intubation). 43 No study has evaluated the impact of hyperoxygenation in this setting. 44 Associated organ dysfunctions are best depicted by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, which has consistently been identified as a determinant of mortality, with higher scores associated with increased mortality. 5, 13, 45 Delayed ICU admission has been associated with increased mortality in immuno comprom ised patients, 14 particularly in those with acute respiratory failure. 10,13,17 Benefits from earlier ICU admission might be the result of the careful clinical assessment, optimal oxygenation strategy, avoidance of potentially harmful investigations, and selection of the least invasive diag nostic tests in ICUs. The characteristics of the underlying immuno suppressive condition are not usually associated with hospital mortality following ICU admission, 46 although variations occur depending on ICU admission policies. A higher proportion of patients admitted to ICU with do-not-resuscitate or do-not-intubate status results in stronger associations between variables reflecting characteristics of disease status and mortality. 47, 48 Performance status and comorbidities have been associated with increased mortality. 13, 14, 49, 50 The effects of initial oxygen ation and ventilation strategy on mortality are discussed later in this Review. Furthermore, as previously mentioned, several studies have assessed the association between the cause of acute respiratory failure and mortality. Mortality is lowest in patients with cardiac pulmonary oedema and highest in those with invasive fungal infections or no identified cause of acute respiratory failure.",

            "text": "Early assessment of pre-test probability of acute respiratory failure cause One of the first and key steps in the early management of immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory fail ure is to establish the probable cause of acute respiratory failure, at the bedside, based on clinical examination before undertaking tests. No standard combination therapy is suitable for all patients with acute respiratory failure; each patient must be considered individually. Clinicians should make every effort to identify the cause of acute respiratory failure in patients at high risk of intubation and mortality (eg, those with a higher SOFA score or more hypoxaemic). Bacterial infection is the main cause of acute respiratory failure, and up to 90% of patients receive antibacterial drugs soon after admission. 9 Cardiogenic pulmonary oedema must be considered in every patient. However, other diagnoses should be considered on a case-by-case basis. Thus, the basic diagnostic investigation is the same for all patients (panel 1). It includes tests for cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, sputum examination, and blood cultures to detect bacterial or fungal infections, induced sputum exam ination for Pneumocystis, viral multiplex PCR on nasopharyngeal aspirates or swabs, viral PCR on plasma or blood, an assessment of the likelihood that the underlying condition and its treatments will affect the lungs, and an analysis of the imaging data. When performing the first clinical examination, the mnemonic DIRECT can be used to assess the cause of acute respiratory failure at the bedside. 51,52 D refers to respiratory symptom duration in days, I to the type of immunosuppression, R to the chest X-ray pattern, E to the clinician's experience of similar cases, C to the clinical findings, and T to high-resolution CT. In patients with myeloproliferative diseases such as acute myeloid leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or chronic myeloid leukaemia, most cases of acute respir atory failure that occur early after disease onset are related to leukaemic infiltrates (figure 1), although some patients might present with pneumonia or cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. 20, 53, 54 Acute respiratory failure of infectious origin is, however, more common at the earliest phase of lympho proliferative disorders (figure 1), such as acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or lymphoma. 21, 55 In patients with T-cell proliferations, opportunistic infections have been reported before cancer treatment initiation, ex emplifying the role played by disease-related immuno suppression. 56 Later, during follow-up, infection is the main cause (figure 1), although treatment-related toxicities and disease relapse can also lead to acute respiratory failure. Clinicians can struggle with non-infectious causes whose diagnosis is believed to rely solely on biopsies, which are difficult to obtain in hypoxaemic patients with thrombocytopenia and haemostatic disorders, or on bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage, and have been reported as possibly deteriorating the respiratory status and increasing IMV needs. However, a multidisciplinary and collaborative approach allows earlier recognition of typical patterns of clinical and laboratory findings, for which no addition al diagnostic procedures are needed (lung infiltration by the underlying condition, leukaemic infiltrates in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia, diffuse alveolar haemorrhage, cytarabine-related pul monary toxicity, immuno therapy-related pneu monitis, etc). Patients with these patterns are often considered to have no known cause of acute respiratory failure until a multidisciplinary team makes the appropriate diagnosis. Similarly, conditions such as neutro penia or allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell trans plantation are associated with both a high risk of respiratory events and specific acute respiratory failure causes such as exacerbation of previous lung injury during neutropenia recovery, 57 or non-infectious interstitial lung diseases following haemo poietic stem cell transplantation. 26, 58 Acute respiratory failure in the first few days after solid organ transplantation is probably related to either a Biopsy or puncture of extra-pulmonary involvement (skin, joints, peripheral lymph nodes, sternal puncture, buccal smear, etc) Imaging data, including chest X-ray, lung and pleural echography, and high-resolution CT scan (without first-line contrast media unless there is a clinical suspicion of pulmonary vascular disease) Review surgical complication or to decompensation of a chronic respiratory or cardiac comorbid condition. 34, 36, 59, 60 Invasive candidiasis might occur quite early after transplantation. 37 However, most opportunistic infections are reported more than 3 months after transplantation and depend heavily on adherence to prophylactic regimens by the patient. 35, 37, [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] Of note, with the use of intensive immuno suppression in patients experiencing acute humoral or interstitial rejection 67 and with the use of immuno suppressant drug combinations to ensure graft tolerance, clinicians must carefully assess the individual risk for each possible cause and perform a complete diagnostic investigation. 68 In each individual case, the type of immune deficiency must be assessed to allow appropriate adjustment of the initial anti-infectious treatment (figure 2) and to avoid treatment delays. Imaging studies, particularly highresolution CT, are another important bedside tool for determining the cause of acute respiratory failure. 69 This Review does not detail the radiological findings in immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory failure. Patterns of lung involvement are an important piece of the puzzle but are not predictive of a specific cause. 69 However, a combination of positive and negative high-resolution CT findings suggest specific causes of lung infiltrates. 70 Different components of the DIRECT mnemonic contribute to determining the pre-test clinical probability for each individual diagnosis (figure 3). A given clinical situation can be related to different causes of acute respiratory failure, because contextual elements and clinical findings vary across patients. However, the administration of antifungal drugs or anti-Pneumocystis therapy should not be delayed if the pre-test probability of the disease is substantial.",

            "text": "Non-invasive diagnostic tests offer an alternative to bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage, which carry a risk of respiratory deterioration requiring IMV. 51 However, bronchoalveolar lavage might be required when non-invasive respiratory samples are either not feasible or of poor quality. Performing bronchoalveolar lavage with the support of NIV or high-flow nasal cannula can help patients tolerate the procedure. Also, first-line bronchoalveolar lavage must be considered in situations in which patients have a possible diagnosis of diffuse alveolar haemorrhage, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, or drugrelated pul monary toxicity, or when lung infiltrates might be involved in the underlying disease (vasculitis, lymphoma, etc). The diagnostic yield of non-invasive tests has, however, increased since the introduction of more sensitive diagnostic tests, such as PCR. However, these tests are more sensitive than specific, and the clinical relevance of a positive PCR is sometimes uncertain. In patients with cancer, the standard diagnostic investigation done immediately at ICU admission includes a physical examination, a pre-test probability assessment using DIRECT, sputum (if possible) and induced sputum examinations, nasopharyngeal aspirates or swabs, blood cultures, serum and urine antigen assays, imaging studies, and biomarker assays. These non-invasive tests perform as well as bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage. 9, 71 In solid organ transplant recipients, however, bronchoalveolar lavage has a higher diagnostic yield, 36 although the riskbenefit ratio has not been assessed in this population. Moreover, with the advent of omics to assist in the diagnosis of infections, 72 as well as sophisticated immunology and molecular biology methods and advances in imaging techniques to establish the diagnosis of non-infectious conditions, a reappraisal of the diagnostic yield of non-invasive tests in immunocompromised patients is warranted. Nevertheless, despite an optimal early diagnostic investigation, the cause remains undetermined in 10-15% 4; table 2 ). Failure to identify the cause of acute respiratory failure was independently associated with mortality in several studies. 5, 13, 76, 84 In some patients, the cause of acute respiratory failure is identified late, and the impact of a late diagnoses and correspondingly late treatment has not been assessed. The association between absence of a documented cause and mortality raises several questions (table 3) . The association might be related in part to patients who die within a few hours with intractable hypoxaemia and multiple organ dysfunction before diagnostic tests can be performed. When providing expert opinion, careful attention should be directed to the clinical situation, underlying disease, comorbid conditions, and ongoing long-term treatments, as well as to the response to treatments given for the current acute respiratory failure episode. Figure 5 shows first-line diagnostic strategy according to clinical and radiographic presentation. The expert will also have the (sometimes difficult) task of determining which tests are actually performed, obtaining their exact results (as opposed to a classification as positive or negative), and potentially obtaining results that might not yet have been made available to the bedside physicians.",

In a cohort of 63 haematology patients, the diagnostic yield of lung biopsy was 62% and the therapeutic yield 57%. 73 The diagnostic yield was lower in patients on IMV and in those with neutropenia, but was higher in patients with focal infiltrates. Invasive aspergillosis was also a common biopsy finding in this study. Complications occurred in 13% of patients. 73 The 15% prevalence of invasive aspergillosis is in line with data on acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with cancer 40 and with autopsy findings in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. 90 In 21 haematology patients, including 10 in whom the lung biopsies were obtained post-mortem, inflammatory and malignant infiltrates were the most common diagnoses. 85 A retro spective autopsy study of 7 haemopoietic stem cell transplant recipients showed that fungal infections, potentially steroid-responsive lung involve ment, and malignant infiltrates were underdiagnosed. 96 Compli cations associ ated with lung biopsies occurred in about 10% of patients who were highly selected based on platelet count, performance status, and goals of care. Given the lower diagnostic yield of lung biopsy in ICU patients, the risk-benefit ratio is not favourable; therefore, lung biopsy is rarely performed in critically ill immuno compromised patients with acute respiratory failure and lung infiltrates of unknown cause. However, minimally invasive CT-guided lung biopsies and transbronchial cryobiopsies are increasingly done. 88, 89, 92, 93, 97, 98 Studies to assess the timing of these minimally invasive diagnostic techniques in this setting are warranted. The diagnostic yield should be better defined as the identification of a new diagnosis that was not detected by any other less invasive technique and that resulted in a change in treatment. Moreover, the risk-benefit ratio needs to be re-assessed. If these minimally invasive biopsy techniques are evaluated in a randomised controlled trial, control patients should receive empirical treatment for the most common lung biopsy diagnoses, namely, invasive fungal infection or steroid-responsive lung disease (panel 2).",

            "text": "The initial oxygenation and ventilation strategy aims to restore safe oxygenation, reduce the respiratory rate, alleviate the dyspnoea and respiratory distress, and improve patient comfort. 99 Over the past two decades, studies have consistently shown higher mortality in immunocompromised patients who required IMV. Priority has, therefore, been given to avoidance of IMV by use of non-invasive oxygenation or ventilation devices ( figure 6 ). However, failure of NIV 13,41,100 or HFNO 13 was associated with higher mortality, 13 and two older studies even suggested that early IMV was associated with improved survival. 101, 102 Furthermore, because respiratory disease severity or associated organ dysfunctions are usually worse in intubated patients, determining whether the excess mortality in patients on IMV is due to the IMV itself or to the greater severity of the acute illness is difficult. In other words, a focus on avoiding intubation might not be effective, because the need for IMV might identify a group of patients with high disease severity. Overall, five initial oxygenation methods are available for patients with hypoxaemic acute respiratory failure (figure 6). Guidelines from the European Respiratory Society and American Thoracic Society advocate the use of NIV. 101 This recommendation is based mainly on a 2001 single-centre trial in 52 patients, 75 in which mortality was 81% in the group assigned to standard oxygen, the highest ever reported in this setting ( 11 This trial showed neither benefits nor harms from NIV, in sharp contrast with a post-hoc analysis of the trial by Frat and colleagues, 12 which compared outcomes in 82 immunocompromised patients treated with HFNO, NIV, or standard oxygen. In this trial, the IMV and mortality rates were higher in the NIV group compared with the HFNO and standard oxygen groups. These results are consistent with studies reporting an increased risk of failure and mortality in patients receiving NIV for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. 41, 75, 79 Thus, these data raise concerns about the use of NIV in immunocompromised patients with hypoxaemic acute respiratory failure. When first introduced, HFNO seemed a promising alternative to NIV. HFNO is easy to use and delivers humidified warmed oxygen, thereby allowing high flows by improving tolerability and comfort. 104 HFNO improves oxygenation, lowers the respiratory rate, inspiratory effort, 105 HFNO also increases end-expiratory lung volume and dynamic lung compliance. 105 These physiological effects are even more pronounced when increasing flow rates are delivered. 106 However, in a randomised controlled trial in 310 unselected patients with hypoxaemic acute respiratory failure and a PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio \u2264300 mm Hg, 107 the number of patients requiring intubation was not significantly reduced with HFNO compared with NIV or standard oxygen. However, the number of ventilator-free days on day 28 was significantly higher with HFNO, and the hazard ratio for day-90 mortality was lower with HFNO. Five studies evaluated the feasibility and safety of HFNO in immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory failure. In a retrospective single-centre study of 45 patients with haematological malignancies (half were bone marrow transplant recipients, 108 half had recently received systemic chemotherapy, and 42% were neutropenic), HFNO allowed recovery without intubation Figure 6 : Nine oxygenation and ventilation methods Standard oxygen can be administered through a wide array of devices. Low-flow oxygen systems comprise a nasal cannula (or nasal catheters; A) providing supplemental oxygen at flows below the total minute ventilation, leading to oxygen dilution with ambient air and lowering the inspired oxygen concentration. A standard nasal cannula delivers an inspiratory FiO 2 of 0\u00b724-0\u00b744 at supply flows 1-8 L/min, depending on respiratory rate and tidal volume. A humidification device is recommended for flows >4 L/min. Reservoir masks (B) can deliver FiO 2 values of 0\u00b740-0\u00b760 at 5-10 L/min. The reservoir system (~100-300 cm\u00b3) stores oxygen. A flow rate >5 L/min must be set to ensure the washout of exhaled gas and avoid CO 2 retention. The non-rebreathing facemask (C) may deliver up to 0\u00b790 FiO 2 at flow settings >10 L/min. It should be used only for short periods, as humidification is difficult and there is also a risk of CO 2 retention if the mask's reservoir bag is allowed to collapse on inspiration. Lastly, the Venturi system (D) mixes oxygen with room air (humidification is not necessary) and provides an accurate and constant FiO 2 despite variations in respiratory rate and tidal volume. It is employed when concern arises about CO 2 retention or when the respiratory drive is inconsistent. High-flow oxygen therapy through nasal prongs or cannulas (high-flow nasal oxygen therapy; E) supplies an exact FiO 2 (up to 1) at a flow equal to or greater than the patient's inspiratory flow demand. Nasal oxygen is administered at a flow rate of up to 60 L/min. It is warmed to body temperature and saturated to full humidity by molecular humidification. Non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation provides ventilator support without an endotracheal tube, using an oronasal (F) or total face (G) mask or a helmet (H). The main non-invasive ventilation mode used in hypoxaemic acute respiratory failure is pressure support; continuous positive airway pressure and bi-level positive airway pressure are used less often. Finally, invasive mechanical ventilation (I) uses a tracheal tube inserted into the trachea under general anaesthesia and a neuromuscular-blocking drug. The tube is then secured to the face or neck and connected to a ventilator. In patients with hypoxaemic acute respiratory failure, intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation are used after failure of standard oxygen and, in some cases, of the aforementioned non-invasive options. FiO 2 = fraction of inspired oxygen. ",

The HFNO failure rate was only 15% in a single-centre study of 183 patients with solid tumours, 109 but was 80% in a study of 56 haematology patients. 110 A phase 2 trial in 30 patients with advanced cancer and persistent dyspnoea compared HFNO with biphasic positive airway pressure. 111 Oxygen saturation improved only with HFNO, whereas both treatments provided similar improvements in dyspnoea and respiratory rate. In 37 lung transplant recipients with acute respiratory failure, HFNO proved feasible and safe and decreased the absolute risk of intubation by 29\u20228%, with a numberneeded-to-treat to avoid one intubation of 3. 34 Although no results from trials specifically assessing HFNO in immunocompromised patients with hypoxaemic acute respiratory failure are available, six studies compared HFNO with other oxygenation or ventilation strategies in this setting (table 2). In a retrospective cohort of 178 patients with cancer and acute respiratory failure, 112 76 (43%) patients received NIV plus HFNO, 74 (42%) NIV plus standard oxygen, 20 (11%) HFNO alone, and 8 (4%) standard oxygen alone. The combination of NIV and HFNO was associated with lower mortality rates (37% vs 52% in the other patients, p=0\u00b704) and was independently associated with higher day-28 survival. In a post-hoc analysis of data from the iNVIctus randomised controlled trial of early NIV in immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory failure, 11 neither the intubation rate nor day-28 mortality differed significantly between the HFNO arm and the standard oxygen arm. 113 In the post-hoc analysis of the trial by Frat and colleagues, 12 outcomes were compared across standard oxygen, NIV, and HFNO. Although NIV was associated with increased need for intubation and higher mortality, neither parameter differed significantly between the 30 patients assigned to standard oxygen and the 26 patients assigned to HFNO. In a retrospective study of 115 immuno compromised patients with acute respir atory failure, 81 the proportion of patients that required intubation (55% vs 35%) and mortality (40% vs 20%) were higher with NIV than with HFNO. In the Efraim multicentre, multinational, prospective cohort study of 1611 immunocompromised patients, 13 915 patients were not intubated on ICU admission and received standard oxygen, HFNO, NIV, or NIV plus HFNO. Hospital mortality was not affected by the initial oxygenation or ventilation management. There was a non-significant trend towards reduced intubation in patients given HFNO. In a retrospective study of 38 kidney recipients, 80 the number of ventilator-free days on day 28 was significantly higher in the HFNO group than in the NIV group. The results of two trials of HFNO focusing specifically on immuno compromised adults with acute respiratory failure (NCT02739451 and NCT02978300) are expected to be available in a few months. 82 HFNO has not yet been properly evaluated regarding its ability to assist diagnostic procedures such as bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and bronchial or transbronchial biopsies.",

If the tachypnoea and high respiratory drive persist, the risk of intubation is very high and it is reasonable to evaluate the potential benefits of avoiding delayed intubation and adding self-inflicted lung injury to the initial pulmonary insult. 83 Early intubation has been associated with improved survival in haematology patients. 101, 102 Studies of early intubation in patients with a persistently high respiratory drive despite the initial oxygenation strategy are warranted.",

            "text": "In summary, acute respiratory failure is a common and often fatal event in immunocompromised patients that raises major diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. In the near future, with the use of more intensive therapeutic regimens designed to cure cancer, induce transplant tolerance, or control autoimmune and inflammatory diseases in ever older and frailer patients, the incidence of acute respiratory failure against a background of immunodeficiency can be expected to increase. Moreover, the expanding use of targeted therapies and immuno therapies will lead to a growing burden of toxicity and infection during the increasing life spans of these populations. Our knowledge of the effects of acute respiratory failure needs to be improved by longer-term follow-up studies. Multinational registries must be developed to analyse the effect of new drugs and update clinicians on future trends in the incidence of acute respiratory failure and in the use of intensive care for patients with acute respiratory failure. Targets for improving survival, such as early ICU admission and the early identification or treatment of the cause of acute respiratory failure, require evaluation in large random ised controlled trials. Patients with substantial life expectancy and who agree to undergo ICU manage ment should be offered unrestricted access to diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. The greatest challenges are the identification of patients at high risk for specific diagnoses, earlier treatment of acute respiratory failure causes, and selection of the least invasive diagnostic tests. The non-invasive approach is promising but still needs to be refined and updated. Combining clinical algorithms and sophisticated tests, such as genomics, metagenomics, proteomics, or transcriptomics, on noninvasive samples to document or rule out infections will be a major advance only if the results include survival benefits, shorter ICU and hospital stay lengths, reduced costs, and improved patient-reported outcomes.
