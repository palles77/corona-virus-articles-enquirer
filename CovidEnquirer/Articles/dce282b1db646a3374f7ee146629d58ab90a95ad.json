Microbes from manure are often low on the priority list for control and remediation, despite the fact that several outbreaks of gastroenteritis have been traced to livestock operations. The pathogens discussed in this paper include protozoans ( Cryptosporidium parvum, Giardia spp.), bacteria ( Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., and Mycobacterium paratuberculosis) , and some enteric viruses. Clinical symptoms, prospects for zoonotic infection, and control methods other than the use of antimicrobials are considered. Recommendations to avoid disease transmission include taking steps to ensure the provision of clean, unstressful environments to reduce disease susceptibility and the careful handling and spreading of manure from animals at high risk for infection, especially young calves. Composting and drying of manure decrease the number of viable pathogens. Environmental controls, such as filter strips, also reduce the risk of water contamination. (",

The goal of this paper is to identify which microbes are of most concern, to review the potential sources of these microbes, and to describe farm level approaches to minimize human and animal infection. The discussion is limited to cattle, especially dairy cows. This distinction is important because many swine enteroviruses can infect humans, and organisms such as Campylobacter spp., which are major problems for the swine and poultry industries, are of somewhat less concern to the dairy industry. The microbes to be discussed were selected based on the likelihood of transmission from dairy cattle to humans, and the potential threat to human health. In some cases, such as Yersinia enterocolitica and Campylobacter jejuni, the decision was difficult: these bacteria pose significant risks to human health, and they are found in cattle feces, but they are more frequently found in poultry and swine manure.",

Microbes in these secretions, as well as those in the excreta, can potentially accumulate on the barn floor. Unless the manure is handled appropriately, these pathogens may infect other animals or humans. Aside from the problem of disease transmission among animals, more than 150 pathogens can cause zoonotic infec-tions (from animals to humans) (52) . Slurry, like manure, contains excreta but does not contain significant amounts of bedding. This distinction has important implications for handling strategies because slurry is more difficult to compost than manure is (25) . For materials to reach 60\u00b0C in 3 d, a target for composting, they should contain at least 30% DM.",

In this review, the emphasis is on L. monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., M. paratuberculosis, and E. coli O157:H7 because outbreaks caused by these organisms have been linked, tenuously in some cases, to cattle. All of these organisms can be transmitted from animals to humans directly or through the food and water supplies. Although anthrax is usually fatal, salmonellosis, listeriosis, and infection with E. coli O157:H7 are of greater public health concern currently because the bacteria that cause these infections have multiple hosts, and the prevalence of infection has increased over the past 20 yr (51) . Mycobacterium paratuberculosis has been included in this review because the issue of whether there is a link between M. paratuberculosis and Crohn's disease has been raised. Mycobacterium paratuberculosis also is an organism that can have severe economic impacts on infected herds.",

Survival is affected by the source, pH, dry matter content, age, and chemical composition of the manure as well as by microbial characteristics. Manure that is well mixed with bedding is more likely to undergo aerobic fermentation with accompanying temperature increases than is slurry with minimal amounts of bedding. Because of their ability to grow under a wide range of conditions, organisms such as L. monocytogenes and M. paratuberculosis (2, 46) are widely dispersed in the environment, making their control difficult.

It is difficult to compare these studies because different detection methods of varying sensitivities, sample collection strategies, age grouping, and number of samples collected were used. In the Washington study (22) , E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from 0.28% (10 of 3570) of the fecal grab samples from dairy animals in 60 herds but not from samples of slurry (feces and urine), bulk milk, or milk filters from these farms.

Two animals were positive for E. coli O157: H7 for more than a year after the initial isolation, but intermediate samples did not always yield positive results. Intermittent shedding does occur with many organisms and must be considered as studies are designed to evaluate prevalence of these organisms. The second study indicated that 22% of the control herds and 50% of the case farms were positive for E. coli O157:H7 ( 6 0 ) and that a relatively small number of animals excreted the organisms on each farm.",

Mycobacterium paratuberculosis may be transmitted prenatally or postnatally, when most infection occurs through the fecal-oral route (53) . The question of prenatal transmission has been controversial, but documentation is abundant that the organism can migrate from the intestinal tract to other organs, including the uterus, the lymphatic system, the udder, and the sex organs of bulls. There is some evidence for sexual transmission of the organism. Young calves are most vulnerable to M. paratuberculosis, but the immune resistance of yearlings is comparable with that of mature cattle.

The scientific issues are complex. The available detection methods are inadequate, producing variable results because of the difficulty in growing the organism, and the immunologic responses to M. paratuberculosis have been inconsistent. Results using antimycobacterial drugs have varied. Furthermore, knowledge is incomplete concerning the drug susceptibilities of the cell-wall deficient forms of the organism, and M. paratuberculosis is resistant to many antimicrobials. Finally, many needed epidemiological studies have not been conducted. Unfortunately, we will not soon have a clear answer to whether M. paratuberculosis causes Crohn's disease. Recent advances using the polymerase chain reaction have improved detection methods significantly (14, 16) , and progress in this area is continuing. Once the methodological problems have been resolved, experiments are needed to determine whether the DNA insertion element that is specific for M. paratuberculosis is found in the tissues of Crohn's patients. Accompanying immunologic experiments would provide additional insight into the relationship between M. paratuberculosis and Crohn's disease. Given this uncertain association between M. paratuberculosis and Crohn's disease, how should the dairy industry approach the problem? Decreasing the level of M. paratuberculosis infection in dairy herds is a logical goal even without the Crohn's disease problem, because the disease is costly in terms of lost milk and shortened cow life. Rossiter and Burhans ( 4 8 ) have suggested a practical strategy on how to develop programs to control M. paratuberculosis on the farm. Their program involves collection of information and history, identification of risks specific to the farm, examination of control options, planning the scope and time frame for the control strategy, and implementation and evaluation of the control program.",
