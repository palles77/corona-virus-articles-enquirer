            "text": "A cute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is a rare autoimmune illness characterized by inflammation of central nervous system myelin with resultant white matter damage. ADEM includes a wide variety of clinical presentations, thus contributing to a complex differential diagnosis. It most frequently occurs in children during winter or spring months following an upper respiratory infection by viruses, such as Epstein Barr, coxsackie, coronavirus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis A, human immunodeficiency virus, influenza, measles, rubella, varicella, and West Nile virus. [1] [2] [3] Alternatively, it may result from a variety of bacterial or parasitic infections. Nearly 5% of cases are precipitated by immunization, with measles/mumps/rubella vaccine being the most frequent cause. 4 Common clinical features of ADEM include fever, altered mental status, hemiparesis, ataxia, cranial neuropathies, and spinal cord dysfunction. Severe cases may be accompanied by seizures or coma, as neurological signs are referable to the location of the lesion burden. 2, 3, 5 Although the exact pathophysiology remains unclear, a hypersensitivity reaction with demyelination is implicated. 6 The prognosis varies and the outcome may be fatal. Surviving patients exhibit varying degrees of recovery and often do not return to their previous baseline functioning. 7 ",

            "text": "Our case emphasizes the variable presentations of ADEM and highlights diagnostic and treatment dilemmas in the setting of pregnancy. Making a correct diagnosis and initiating proper treatment for ADEM are critical. Brain imaging is recommended in most new presentations of neurological dysfunction or psychiatric conditions or both. 8 MRI and lumbar puncture may confirm the presence of demyelinating diseases, including ADEM. 9,10 More invasive procedures, such as a brain biopsy or cerebral angiogram, are rarely necessary and pose additional risk. Vigorous treatment for a potential infectious process is recommended, whereas anti-inflammatory and immunemodulating pharmacotherapies are the primary interventions for ADEM. 11 Corticosteroids and IVIg may shorten the duration and severity of illness or halt disease progression. Plasmapheresis may be offered with or without immunosuppressive agents, but usually in cases resistant to steroids. 11 Supportive measures, including physical therapy and skin care, are provided on a routine basis. Surviving patients may exhibit slow, partial recoveries over several months, whereas others might retain permanent neurological deficits, persistent psychiatric symptoms, and residual cognitive impairments. 7 This case posed challenges to the usual treatment plan. Morbidity to both mother and fetus could escalate if immunomodulatory therapy was withheld. Alternatively, high-dose steroids can result in fetal hypoadrenalism, and methylprednisone is a Category D pharmaceutical during the first trimester of pregnancy. In addition, there is a risk of stroke during IVIg infusions, 12 and this could theoretically be increased owing to the hypercoagulable state of pregnancy. Conversely, there is some controversial evidence for IVIg being protective against repeated miscarriages. 13 Ms. A's neurological status began to improve after the pregnancy was terminated. This poses questions about whether pregnancy could have precipitated the illness and whether termination attenuated the disease process. The relationship between ADEM and pregnancy is uncertain. 14, 15 One case of ADEM in the third trimester responded favorably to plasmapheresis after treatment failure with high-dose corticosteroids. 14 In contrast, other cases of fulminant demyelinating disease during pregnancy have resulted in coma. 15, 16 Another demyelinating illness, Marburg's Disease, is similarly rapid and fulminant, but less likely during pregnancy; 1 case, resistant to steroids, IVIg, and plasmapheresis, resulted in death. 16 Pregnancy is associated with a reduced inflammatory response due to increased levels of antiinflammatory and immunosuppressant cytokines which prevent fetal rejection and promote passive transfer of antibodies to the fetus. 17 These hormonally-induced alterations are essential to support a successful full-term pregnancy. This may explain the decreased frequency of relapses in a related demyelinating disease, multiple sclerosis, during pregnancy. 17 In a retrospective study of multiple sclerosis patients, higher parity was associated with a reduced risk of a first demyelinating event, with a 49% reduction in risk during each subsequent pregnancy. 18 This stands in contrast to our case, in which a multiparous patient experienced her first demyelinating event. However, women with radiologically-identified, asymptomatic multiple sclerosis who then became pregnant were more likely to develop new MRI-documented pathology. This suggests that pregnancy may activate disease in presymptomatic individuals. 19 It is possible that our patient had asymptomatic pathology that became evident during and exacerbated by pregnancy, but it is impossible to conclude this without premorbid brain imaging for comparison. Another explanation includes her compromised immunity while being pregnant, which can lead to increasing severity of infectious diseases. 20 For example, morbidity from influenza can increase during pregnancy, which might have predisposed her to a possible virally-induced ADEM. Alternatively, a direct immune-mediated response to the fetus may have triggered the ADEM; this is supported by the beginning of recovery after pregnancy termination in our vignette. Determining whether a causal relationship exists is not possible, because the natural course of this disease and its potential response to immunotherapies tend toward recovery over a similar time period.",

Further investigation may determine whether an immune-mediated response to the fetus can precipitate ADEM. Given ethical concerns and the rarity of this condition, it is impossible to determine whether a causal relationship exists between termination of pregnancy and resolution of treatment-resistant ADEM.",
