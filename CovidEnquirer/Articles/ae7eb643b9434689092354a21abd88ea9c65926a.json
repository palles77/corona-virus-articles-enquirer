Based on the vaccinia Tiantan (VTT) strain, which was historically used to eradicate the smallpox in China, we generated a modified VTT (MVTT ZCI ) by removing the hemagglutinin gene and an 11,944 bp genomic region from HindIII fragment C2L to F3L. MVTT ZCI was characterized for its host cell range in vitro and preclinical safety and efficacy profiles in mice. Despite replication-competency in some cell lines, unlike VTT, MVTT ZCI did not cause death after intracranial injection or body weight loss after intranasal inoculation. MVTT ZCI did not replicate in mouse brain and was safe in immunodeficient mice. MVTT ZCI induced neutralizing antibodies via the intranasal route of immunization. One time intranasal immunization protected animals from the challenge of the pathogenic vaccinia WR strain. This study established proof-of-concept that the attenuated replicating MVTT ZCI may serve as a safe noninvasive smallpox vaccine candidate.",

The causative agent of smallpox is variola virus, a member of the orthopoxvirus genus. In the aftermath of September 11, 2001 and the anthrax laced letters appearing in the United States, there is heightened concern that variola virus might be used as an agent of bioterrorism [3, 4] . Since there is no specific treatment for smallpox, the effective prevention strategy will still rely on vaccination. The currently stockpiled vaccines however have issues related to their adverse events including postvaccinal encephalitis (PVE) or encephalomyelitis (PVEM) [5, 6] . The invasive immunization procedure also adds additional difficulty for mass vaccination especially in developing countries. It therefore remains critical to determine whether or not a safe, effective and replicating vaccinia strain can be generated as a noninvasive smallpox vaccine [7, 8] .",

VTT is also a member of the orthopoxvirus genus. Since vaccination with VTT protected against variola virus, it was used for hundreds of millions of Chinese people to prevent smallpox infection between 1920 and 1980 (http:// www.who.int/emc/diseases/smallpox/Smallpoxeradication.html). This led to the eradication of variola in China before 1980. Logically, VTT remains the first choice to be stockpiled for the country. However, the clinical safety of this vaccine has neither been carefully studied nor clearly documented. It was reported that VTT caused larger lesions after intradermal vaccination and was likely more virulent than other widely used smallpox vaccines such as Lister or Wyeth [13] . We recently demonstrated that VTT remains virulent in mice after intranasal inoculation, which restricts its use as a noninvasive vaccine [14] . Moreover, the virulence of VTT implies significant risks not only to children but also to many immune compromised adult recipients (e.g. HIV/AIDS, Cancer, Leukemia, Lymphoma, Multiple Myeloma, etc). We therefore aimed to modify VTT to develop a safe, mucosal deliverable noninvasive smallpox vaccine or a safe vaccine vector for other pathogens.",

To facilitate the purification of the MVTT ZCI , we have introduced the gene of green florescence protein (GFP) into the deletion site. After serial rounds of plaque clonal purification in Vero cells, a homogenous MVTT ZCI stock was obtained as determined by the co-expression of GFP and vaccinia specific protein in infected cells. The expression of HA was detected in cells infected with VTT, but not with MVTT ZCI using a HA-specific monoclonal antibody B2D10 (a generous gift from Dr. H. Shida) (Fig. 1) . We also performed overlapping PCR screening analysis of MVTT ZCI genome. In comparison to VTT, we found that MVTT ZCI contains a large 11,944 bp genomic deletion from C2L to F3L in the left terminal region that we did not intend to make (Fig. 1) .

As shown in Fig. 2 , we found that VTT genes are highly variable within the C2L to F3Lregion in the left terminal region. Nine out of the 20 clones contained various gene deletions. The results suggested that that MVTT ZCI was likely derived from one of VTT variants containing the 11,944 bp genomic deletion.

Thirteen cell types, which have been previously used to determine the host cell range of VTT [14] , were tested for MVTT ZCI . We found that MVTT ZCI replicates in mouse NIH3T3 cells in a semi-permissive way suggesting that its replication is not completely restricted in mouse cells (Table 1) . It however displayed a rather limited replication capacity in three cell lines including RK13, MDCK, and C6, which were derived from rabbit, canine and rat, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. 3A ). MVTT ZCI did not seem to replicate in RK13 and MDCK cells at all even in the single round replication experiment with a MOI of 5. There was no viral particle formation in RK13 cells infected with MVTT ZCI by electron microscopy analysis (data not shown). To further confirm this observation, we determined the level of viral spread among cells using an immunohistochemical staining method [15] . As shown in Fig. 3B , no cell-to-cell spread of MVTT ZCI could be found in RK13 and MDCK cells. Since only singly infected cells were found up to 72 h (h) post-infection (p.i.), the data suggested that the cell-to-cell spread was likely absent in these two cell lines. Moreover, only a low level of viral spread was found in C6 cells with small clusters of infected cells identified 48-72 h p.i. (Fig. 3B ). As controls, the replication and spread of MVTT ZCI is indistinguishable to those of VTT in Vero cells, suggesting that the HA gene and the genes in the C2L-F3L region are non-essential for MVTT ZCI replication and propagation in Vero cells (Table 1 and Fig. 3A and B) .

As shown in Fig. 4C , all animals that received 10 3 -10 6 PFU of VTT died or were euthanized due to significant body weight loss (over 25%) according to the standard operating procedure.

In contrast, all of the mice that received 10 6 and 10 7 PFU of MVTT ZCI survived and continued gaining their body weight during the experimental period.

Despite its application in smallpox eradication, whether or not VTT should be stockpiled to respond to a possible bioterrorist attack has attracted some debate. We previously demonstrated that VTT is less virulent when compared with the pathogenic WR strain [14] . VTT however remains neurovirulent and not feasible for noninvasive mucosal vaccination. Here, we report the generation of MVTT ZCI , a variant of VTT. This variant remains replication-competent in several mammalian cells (Table 1 ) but does not cause body weight loss after intranasal inoculation or death after intracranial injection in mice ( Fig. 4A and B) . The significantly attenuated phenotype of MVTT ZCI is also evident in immunodeficient SCID mice after a high dose of viral infection (Fig. 4C) . Furthermore, we showed that the non-neurovirulent nature of MVTT ZCI is likely due to the loss of the viral replication capacity in the brains of two mouse species (Fig. 5B and C) .

            "text": "The attenuated phenotype of MVTT ZCI is not solely determined by the HA gene. It have been previously demonstrated that the vaccinia genomic deletions may result in the generation of highly attenuated viral variants. For example, MVA contains six major genomic deletions which rendered the virus replication incompetent in mammalian cells [32] . Similar situation applies to vaccinia strain NYVAC [25] . MVTT ZCI is different from MVA and NYVAC in that it remains replication-competent in some mammalian cells tested (Table 1) . HA is found on the plasma membrane of infected cells and the envelope of extracellular virus (EEV) but is absent from intracellular mature virus (IMV), the most abundant infectious forms of infectious virions [33, 34] . Several studies showed that the loss of HA is associated with the reduced virulence of vaccinia viruses [17, 23, 35] . For example, MVA has the major deletion III in the HA promoter region [36] . The inactivation of HA gene was able to attenuate the neurovirulence of vaccinia WR strain by 10 4 -fold as determined by the ICLD 50 value but did not render the virus replication incompetent in mouse brains [23] . To our surprise, the removal of HA gene of VTT has resulted in the MVTT ZCI with diminished neurovirulence (Figs. 4B, 5B and C). We speculated that other factors could have played a role. For this reason, we performed an overlapping PCR-scanning analysis of MVTT ZCI genomic DNA to search for potential mutations especially corresponding to unstable deletion regions identified in MVA. We found that MVTT ZCI contains a major 11,944 bp genomic deletion from HindIII fragment C2L to F3L in the left terminal region of viral genome that we did not intend to introduce. This deletion is located near the DelII site of MVA [32] . Besides HA, several genes in the deletion region could have contributed to the attenuated phenotype of MVTT ZCI . First, it is known that N1L enhances virulence and replication of vaccinia virus in vivo [37] . Second, K1L is recognized as a host range gene (hr) that is essential to support the replication of vaccinia virus in RK13 cells [27, 38, 39] , which are consistent to our finding that MVTT ZCI becomes replication incompetent in RK13 cells (Fig. 3) . Third, M2L is probably involved in the regulation of host NF-kB responses in virus infection which may potentially influence inflammation and the severity of vaccinia infection [40] . Fourth, K3L gene is an immunomodulatory and anti-apoptotic gene that inhibits IFN intracellular signaling pathway by preventing RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) activation [41] [42] [43] . Thus, deletion of K3L in vaccinia virus may render the virus sensitive to the antiviral effects of IFN and probably limit disease progression in vivo. Lastly, F1L is a mitochondrial-localized protein that functions to protect cells from apoptosis and inhibits cytochrome c release, which may affect viral propagation in vivo [44] . Therefore, the attenuated phenotype of MVTT ZCI is likely due to the loss of HA as well as of several critical genes in the 11,944 bp deletion region. We found that the parental VTT consists of many viral variants (Fig. 2) . We cannot exclude the possibility that other genes may also contribute to the attenuated phenotype of MVTT ZCI. Future study will require the full genomic analysis of MVTT ZCI.",

            "text": "MVTT ZCI is an attractive noninvasive smallpox vaccine candidate or a safe vaccine vector for other pathogens for further development. Several studies have demonstrated that MVA and LC16m8 induced comparable protective immune response against pathogenic vaccinia virus infection in small animal models when compared with replicating vaccine strains [7, 8, 22, 45, 46] . A recent study also indicated that the longevity of protection induced by MVA is comparable to that induced by Lister strain [47] . Furthermore, vaccination with two doses of MVA was safe and well tolerated compared to the currently available smallpox vaccine Dryvax in humans. The vaccination also produced comparable cellular and humoral immune responses to one dose of Dryvax [47] . These attenuated vaccine candidates however are not available in China. Here, we demonstrated that MVTT ZCI protects mice effectively from the challenge of a pathogenic vaccinia WR strain with an efficacy profile similar to that of VTT. Apparently, higher levels of neutralizing antibodies induced by either VTT or MVTT ZCI contributed to the complete protection of animals against the lethal challenge of pathogenic WR strain. This finding should not be a surprise because major neutralizing determinants in B5R, H3L and other proteins were not affected by the deletions in MVTT ZCI , which correlate with the protection of animals in previous studies [48, 49] . Interestingly, although the low dose of MVTT ZCI (10 4 PFU) did not induce detectable systemic neutralizing antibodies against WR strain, vaccinated animals were all significantly protected (Fig. 6B) . We reason that the low dose of MVTT ZCI had probably induced other protective immune mechanism effectively such as protective cell-mediated and mucosal immune responses, which will require further investigations. Since intranasal inoculation of MVTT ZCI was equally effective compared to the intramuscular injection, our study has established proof-of-concept that the attenuated replicating MVTT ZCI may serve as a safe and noninvasive smallpox vaccine candidate, which is a critical element for the mass vaccination program in developing countries including China, the nation with the world's largest human population. A recent study indicated that aerosol immunization with non-replicating NYVAC and MVA vectored vaccines is safe, simple, and immunogenic [50] . It would be interesting to determine whether or not MVTT ZCI will do better. Since a replicating MVTT-vectored vaccine induced higher level of neutralizing antibodies (\u223c100-fold) against SARS-CoV infection via i.n. or i.o. (intraoral) inoculation when compared with the non-replicating MVA vector [51, 52] , the replication-competence likely offers greater advantage for improving the immunogenicity of MVTT-based vaccines. Moreover, the replication-competence may offer greater advantage for reducing the dose and frequency of smallpox vaccination. Further primeboost studies should also be conducted to determine whether or not MVTT ZCI vaccination prior to VTT or Dryvax would help to minimize the primary cutaneous lesion or other side efforts related to the currently stockpiled vaccines. In addition, MVTT ZCI is useful as a safe and replicating vector for the development of mucosal deliverable vaccines against infections of human immunodeficiency virus and avian influenza virus, etc. We have recently constructed an MVTT SIVgpe to express simian immunodeficiency virus gag/pol/env using the MVTT ZCI as a vaccine vector. We inoculated 10 8 PFU of MVTT SIVgpe into four rhesus macaques through intranasal inoculation, respectively. All four macaques tolerated the vaccination well without showing clinical signs of disease. There is therefore no evidence to indicate that the virulence of MVTT ZCI is quite different in non-human primates when compared with mice. To proof the safety profile of MVTT ZCI in humans, however, a careful clinical trial remains necessary. To this end, due to the replication-competency of MVTT ZCI , it is necessary to carefully evaluate its use in immunocompromized non-human primate models and individuals if MVTT ZCI -based vaccine will be used for immune therapy of AIDS patients. The GFP gene in MVTT ZCI serves nicely as a negative selection marker for generating recombinant viruses and should not be included in vaccines developed for human use.",
