This model allows the dynamic structure of return and volatility to change according to a threshold model while accounting for the interdependence of financial returns. Through the threshold volatility modeling, we can understand the impact of market news on volatility asymmetry. Estimation of unknown parameters are carried out using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. Simulations show that our estimators are reliable in moderately large sample sizes. We apply the model to three market indice data and estimate time-varying correlations among the indice returns.",

The extension to multivariate class enables us to analyze the financial returns across different securities and markets. The knowledge of returns correlation structure is vital in many financial applications, especially in risk management. Furthermore, it enhances statistical inference and volatility forecasting. For example, So et al. [32] introduced a MSV model that can explain any lead-lag relationship of the volatility structure. Asai and McAleer [3] considered two types of asymmetric MSV model. Asai and McAleer [4] developed a dynamic correlation MSV model. Basic MSV models have been modified to capture different features of financial data or to reduce the dimensionality of the parameter space. Factor MSV models were built up to handle high dimension financial data [10, 12] . So and Kwok [30] developed a multivariate long memory SV model, which was showed to be more consistent with empirical stylized facts than traditional MSV models. Detailed reviews and comparisons on MSV models are given in Danielsson [14] , Asai and McAleer [2] and Yu and Meyer [38] .",

            "text": "Asymmetry effect in volatility of financial assets means different responses in volatility to good and bad news. In particular, bad news tends to increase future volatility more than good news does. A popular explanation of such asymmetry is the leverage effect given by Black [5] and Christie [11] , in which asymmetric SV and MSV models were developed on the basis of the leverage effect [1, 2, 8, 20] . Empirical results in Asai and McAleer [1, 3] suggested that multivariate models are more preferable than univariate models in modeling asymmetry. Besides, the asymmetry effect can also be modeled using thresholds structure. This has been studied in the time series and univariate GARCH literature extensively [16, 26, 35, 36] . Recently, a multivariate threshold GARCH model with time-varying correlations has been proposed by Kwan et al. [24] . In the univariate SV literature, So et al. [33] proposed a threshold SV (THSV) model, in which the asymmetry effect is modeled through a threshold setting that the autoregressive parameters in the SV equation change according to the sign of the previous returns. The THSV model successfully captures the mean and variance asymmetries simultaneously, and was demonstrated through the strong evidence of asymmetries in the empirical data. However, the multivariate extension of the model has not been developed in the literature. This paper aims to fill this gap.",

[33] , since it is believed that high correlation within the parameter groups still exist in the multivariate case. The three groups for \u03b8are: the first group is the mean equation parameters 0 , , 1 , C; the second group is the variance equation parameters 0 , , 1 , D; and the last group is \u03b7 . The mean and variance parameters can be sampled from their full conditional densities directly, which are extracted from (4) . With the use of conjugate priors, the multivariate normal prior induces a multivariate normal conditional density. Therefore, the sampling of the mean parameter and variance parameters is quite straightforward since they are sampled from well known distributions.

The mean of the posterior mean estimators are close to their respective true values, indicating that the biases of estimation by the posterior means are small. In fact, we observe very close estimates from both posterior mean and median on the average. Moreover, all standard errors are reasonably small.

All data are obtained from Datastream International dated from 3 July 1985 to 30 June 2005, giving a total of 5165 return observations. The daily return is defined as the log-difference of the index price, y t = (log p t \u2212 log p t\u22121 ) \u00d7 100, where p t is the closing price at time t and \"log\" in the formula is the natural logarithm. Typical volatility clustering feature with some spikes of high volatility that may be explained by market crashes or well-known financial events can be observed from the plot of the three daily return series 1 . From the summary statistics of the returns data in Table 2 , highest correlation is observed between the returns of SP500 and FTSE100 (0.413), and the least is between SP500 and HSI (0.154). Besides, the data also exhibit standard properties of asset returns time series, including close to zero sample mean, negative sample skewness and excess sample kurtosis. One of the key issues before executing the MCMC scheme for the empirical data is to decide the threshold variable. A reasonable choice is the lagged one daily return of SP500 since the US stock market plays a major role in the world market movement. We define the lower regime (s t = 0) and the upper regime (s t = 1) by the lagged one SP500 return less than and greater than zero respectively. It turns out that 47% and 53% of the returns are in the lower and upper Table 3 Posterior mean estimates and the respective posterior standard deviations of the parameters for the empirical application Table 2 , which presents summary statistics of returns in the two regimes, it is observed that the variance of the three indices are all higher for the lower regime than that for the upper regime.

To implement our MCMC sampling scheme for the empirical data, 100000 iterations are preformed, with the first 20000 burn-in iterations being discarded. Table 3 reports the posterior mean and the corresponding standard derivation (in parentheses) of the parameters for the two regimes. The eigenvalues (in descending order) of 1 s t and 1 s t are also given in the table. To explore the mean asymmetry implied by the model, we reproduce the mean equation ofr t as in the lower and upper regimes. It is evident that the coefficients in the autoregressive matrix are predominantly negative in the lower regime with magnitude larger than that in the upper regime. Therefore, clear mean asymmetry is documented from the MTHSV parameters. From Table 3 , we can observe clear variance asymmetry from the different values in 0 s t and 1 s t for different s t . In fact, the largest eigenvalue of 1 s t in the lower regime is substantially larger than that in the upper regime, indicating that the variance in the lower regime is more persistent.

We divide this period into two parts to discuss: April 2002-October 2002 and March 2003 -June 2003. The main cause for the first part can be the September 11 incidence in 2001. Its economic impact on the US market was critical. On the contrary, the shadow of the incidence did not affect the Hong Kong and China markets much. During this period, the China economy was expanding quickly, from which Hong Kong benefited a lot. The opposite situation caused the negative correlations between the returns of HSI and SP500. In the second part, the US economy revived gradually, however, the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak in Hong Kong causes Corr(r 13 ) and Corr(r 23 ) still being negative. The SARS induced a serious economic consequence to Hong Kong. As there were only rare cases of SARS in US and UK, the effect to their economy was insignificant and thus making the HSI returns negatively correlated with the SP500 and FTSE100 returns.",
