            "text": "The skewness of conditional return distributions has been widely recognized as a common phenomenon in financial markets. Some important aspects of skewness in returns have also been studied. First, a substantial body of literature documents that negative unconditional skewness is caused by asymmetric volatility (Engle & Ng, 1993; Glosten, Jagannathan, & Runkle, 1993; Nelson, 1990) . Second, many authors have noted that financial time series behave differently during market declines and periods of market growth. Officer (1973 ), Schwert (1989a ,b), and Campbell and Lettau (1999 indicated that volatility is higher when markets decline than it is when they expand, while Perez-Quiros and Timmermann (2001) identified a more pronounced negative conditional skewness during late expansions and early recessions. Third, starting from Hansen (1994) , several empirical studies have documented that conditional skewness in market returns is time varying and predictable. Harvey and Siddique (1999 ), Jondeau and Rockinger (2003 ), Brooks, Burke, Heravi, and Persand (2005 ), Leon, Rubio, and Serna (2005 , and Lanne and Saikkonen (2007) found a significant presence of time-varying conditional skewness in market returns. These studies viewed conditional skewness as analogous to heteroskedasticity and modeled conditional skewness as a function of lagged skewness.",

Motivated by the theory proposed by Hong and Stein (2003) , which predicts negative skewness to be more pronounced when investors disagree more and short selling is restricted, a number of empirical studies have addressed this question by analyzing the relationship among skewness, short sale constraints, and heterogeneous beliefs. Tests on the validity of the theory, however, have returned conflicting findings. Daouk and Charoenrook (2005) , Chang, Cheng, and Yu (2007), and Hueng and McDonald (2005) found either an insignificant or positive relationship among short sale restriction, heterogeneous beliefs, and skewness, whereas Chen, Hong, and Stein (2001) and Boyer et al.

This paper argues that the relationship among short sale restrictions, heterogeneous beliefs, and conditional skewness behaves differently during periods of market decline and periods of market growth. The time series models that ignore this difference are highly likely to be mis-specified if the sample skewness measured during market declines behaves differently from that in expansion periods. Several theoretical and empirical papers motivate our empirical investigation on the effect of heterogeneous beliefs, short sale restrictions, and market direction on conditional skewness. Section 1 reviews the theoretical and empirical works that motivate our study. Section 2 discusses the theoretical background of our empirical work. Section 3 presents the conditional skewness model, which helps us test our idea. Section 4 discusses our empirical results, and Section 5 concludes the study.",

One of the most influential theories of skewness, first documented by Black (1976) , attributes the negative relationship between current stock prices and future volatility to leverage. An increase in financial leverage followed by a period of price decline increases future volatility and thus introduces negative skewness when the debt level is fixed. Although the empirical effect of leverage on volatility has been proven to be statistically significant (Christie, 1982) , the effect is not sufficiently large to account for all the asymmetries in stock prices (Figlewski & Wang, 2000; Schwert, 1989b) .",

Risk-averse investors will therefore require a higher rate of return and consequently a lower current price to compensate for the higher risk level, regardless of the nature of the news. This volatility feedback effect strengthens the effect of the negative impact of bad news but moderates the effect of the positive impact of good news. As a result, on average, the magnitude of the effect of negative events is larger than that of positive events, contributing to negative skewness in equity returns. The volatility feedback assumption is consistent with the empirical findings in Nelson (1990) , Engle and Ng (1993) , Glosten et al. (1993) , and other empirical asymmetric GARCH studies.",

The fourth theory, the heterogeneous-agent-based theory proposed by Hong and Stein (2003) , however, suggests the use of a mild assumption of investor irrationality together with some institutional frictions that offer us some insights into the abnormal behavior of skewness. They assume that some investors are overconfident and believe in their own private signals, which in turn generates differences of opinion; when differences of opinion are large and short selling is not allowed, the market prices reflect only the valuation of the optimist investors since short sale constraints prevent negative information from being revealed in the market. Aligned with earlier studies of the effects on asset pricing caused by heterogeneous beliefs and short sale constraints (Harrison & Kreps, 1978; Miller, 1977) , Hong and Stein (2003) theory suggests that short sale constraints with heterogeneous beliefs lead to overpricing. Furthermore, Hong and Stein (2003) theory extended earlier studies by suggesting that if other previously optimistic investors bail out of the market, then the originally pessimistic group may become the marginal buyers and more will be learned about their negative signals. Thus, the accumulated hidden information is revealed during the market decline, and these returns will be more negatively skewed with high trading volume, which is a proxy of the degree of heterogeneous beliefs.",

Chang et al. (2007) found that the skewness of unconditional returns increases when stocks are not allowed to be sold short and decreases when stocks are allowed to be sold short. Blau and Pinegar (2009), who approximate short sale constraints by using relatively short interest, show that there are positive relationships among turnover, relatively short interest, and unconditional skewness. Hueng and McDonald (2005) tested the behavior of timevarying conditional skewness by assuming a skewed t distribution on conditional returns.

Unlike the abovementioned theories that explain negative asymmetries, the price convexity theory explains positive market asymmetries. The model assumes that people may react to the same signal to a different extent. Since high precision traders react more than low precision traders to the same signal, price reactions are stronger to positive than to negative signals with the presence of short sale constraints. When the distribution of the signal is symmetric and no other factors affect the skewness of market return, the overall level of market skewness is positive.

First, at time 1, trader B obtains a bad signal S B , so their valuation of the stock is well below that of A. Because of short sale constraints, trader B will not enter the market, and the only trade will be between trader A and the arbitrageurs. The arbitrageurs can deduce that B's signal is well below A's but cannot determine the exact amount. Therefore, the market price at time 1 impounds A's prior information but cannot reflect B's time 1 signal. Next, at time 2, two possible scenarios arise. If A receives a good signal at time 2, then B's signal remains hidden. If, however, A gets a bad signal at time 2, then it is possible that B's previously hidden time 1 signal may be revealed at time 2. For example, if B steps in and is willing to buy after the price drops by 5%, the arbitrageurs learn that B's time 1 signal was not very negative. If, however, B does not step in even after the price drops by 20%, the arbitrageurs must conclude that B's time 1 signal was more negative than their prior expectation. In other words, trader B's sideline behavior in the face of A's selling is additional bad news for the arbitrageurs above and beyond the bad news implicit in A's selling.",

Given free disposal, a negative bubble is not possible since investors cannot rationally expect the value of the stock to become negative in a finite time. Therefore, bubbles can only be positive, i.e., 0. With the assumption of positive bubbles, trader B's signal S B remains hidden as long as b is high enough. When b is high, before the trial price p called out by the auctioneer ever reaches S B , it reaches the arbitrageurs' conditional estimate of the stock value, and the market is cleared. This is true for both time 1 and time 2. Therefore, when trader A gets a negative signal at time 2, trader B will not enter the market, since the arbitrageurs will clear the market with an overvalued price.

The class of skew normal distributions extends the normal distribution by including an additional shape parameter to regulate skewness and allows a continuous transition from normality to non-normality. There are other alternatives such as the inverse hyperbolic sine function proposed by Johnson (1949) , the stable Paretian distributions proposed by Mandelbrot (1963) , the skew-t distribution proposed by Hansen (1994) , the skewed generalized error distribution proposed by Hansen, McDonald, and Newey (2010) , and the centered parametrized skew-t distribution proposed by Azzalini (2013) . All these distributions allow us to model both skewness and kurtosis. Since our paper focuses on skewness but not kurtosis and the parametric tests can still perform well with data that are fat-tailed if the sample size is large enough, we have chosen the skew normal distribution since the skew normal distribution is mathematically tractable even under a multivariate setting, and no transformation due to parameter constraints imposed by the distribution is necessary (Arellano-Valle & Azzalini, 2008; Azzalini & Dalla_Valle, 1996) . Thus, the skew normal distribution is a natural choice for modeling skewness when the data under analysis exhibits unimodal empirical distribution with some skewness present. First, we look at the properties of the skew normal distribution, and then we present our SN-GARCH model.",

From Fig. 8 , we can see that all the rolling unconditional skewness estimates show the variation in skewness month by month for the HSI index. From the unconditional estimates alone, however, we have no concrete evidence for instability of unconditional skewness over time. However, it has been shown that failure to detect unconditional skewness in the sample would not rule out the possibility of time-varying conditional skewness over the estimation period (Ghysels, Plazzi, & Valkanov, 2011) . The same can also be applied to the stability of conditional and unconditional skewness; even if unconditional skewness proves to be stable, we cannot rule out the possibility of the presence of unstable conditional skewness. To see whether there is any instability in conditional skewness, we apply the robust conditional quantile-based skewness estimate proposed by Ghysels et al. (2011 Ghysels et al. ( , 2016 ",

Specifically, during the two crisis periods, negative conditional skewness is more pronounced when people disagree about the market more or the short sale constraints are increasingly binding. However, heterogeneous beliefs and short sale restrictions do not seem important to the determination of market conditional skewness during market growth since the coefficients on DTO t and DSI t in our baseline specifications, specification (1) for the SN-GJR-GARCH model and specification (4) for the SN-Q-GARCH model, respectively, are not statistically significant. In other words, our results indicate that the short sale constraints and differences in opinions contributed to negative asymmetries during the two crisis periods but did not do so during the periods of market growth. These results confirmed our prediction, since the Hong and Stein (2003) theory of rational bubbles predicts negative asymmetries if and only if the bubble bursts and the market enters a downward adjustment period.

From the figure, we can see that both measures predict less negative (i.e., more positive) asymmetries during the bubble phase and, thus, give us additional evidence to support our modified theory. Table 2 shows the estimation results of the SN-GJR-GARCH and SN-Q-GARCH models with different market direction indicators. As mentioned in the previous section, the crisis indicator is somewhat arbitrary; therefore, as a robustness check, we also test the yearly, quarterly, and weekly market direction indicators. As shown in Figs. 4 and 5, the yearly market indicator spots similar turning points in the market, whereas the quarterly market indicator spots more frequent changes in the market direction than the crisis indicator. The crisis and yearly indicators help us test how conditional skewness responds to the general market decline for a relatively long period of time. The quarterly market indicator, which can be seen in Fig. 6 , helps us test how conditional skewness responds to more frequent changes in the market direction, and the weekly market direction indicator, which can be seen in Fig. 7 , helps us test how conditional skewness responds to short-term changes in the market direction. The estimation results are presented in Table 2 . All coefficients on \"DTO t I and \"DSI t I\" are negative and strongly significant when the yearly and quarterly market indicators are used. However, we find that market turnover has only mild statistical power in forecasting conditional skewness, while market short interest is not important in determining the skewness of market return even during periods of general market declines when the weekly market direction indicator is used. This result may imply that the degree of heterogeneous beliefs and short sale restrictions in the market has an effect on conditional skewness when the downward trend in the market persists for more than a week. It is also possible that the weekly market direction indicator that we have used to obtain the above results may be a noisy proxy for indicating real changes in the market direction.",
