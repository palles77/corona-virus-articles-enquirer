Focusing on the USA and the UK, we discuss seven approaches: education (especially of non-clinical managers, policymakers, and the public), organisational guidelines, performance reporting, financial and sociobehavioural incentives to health-care professionals and institutions, regulation, legal requirements, and health-care system reorganisation. No single action is likely to have sustained effect and we recommend a combination of approaches. Several recent initiatives that hold promise tie performance reporting to financial incentives. Though performance reporting has been hampered by concerns over cost and accuracy, it remains an essential component and we recommend continued effort in this area. We also recommend more public education and use of organisational guidelines, such as admission criteria and staffing levels in intensive care units. Even if these endeavours are successful, with rising demand for services and continuing pressure to control costs, optimum care of the critically ill will not be realised without a fundamental reorganisation of services. In both the USA and UK, we recommend exploration of regionalised care, akin to US state trauma systems, and greater use of physician-extenders, such as nurse practitioners, to provide enhanced access to specialist care for critical illness.",

First, patients and families are integral to the care process and may contribute more if better educated. For example, the morbidity and mortality of meningococcal septicaemia in children might be reduced if parents have greater awareness of the need for prompt admission to hospital and aggressive resuscitation. [11] [12] [13] Similarly, a public welleducated about the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) might comply better with preventive strategies and quarantine procedures. 14, 15 The second reason relates to the health-care market. A major thrust of health-care policy in recent years, both in the USA and the UK, has been to promote greater competition both among providers (clinicians and hospitals) and among purchasers. The premise is that a more competitive marketplace provides better quality care at lower cost. However, \"efficient\" markets require educated consumers. 16 If the consumer (patients, or the purchaser as their agent) cannot distinguish between a high and low quality product, then they cannot choose wisely.",

Incentives might operate through recognition and reward for good performance (positive) or by penalising poor performance (negative). Although there are nearly always a large number of negative and positive incentives surrounding any decision or course of action, the use of deliberate incentive schemes in the UK to drive a particular behaviour is uncommon and often controversial. The Department of Health's use of a star-rating system for hospitals in England has largely been based on process and outcome indicators derived from data of doubtful quality. 30 It takes no account of the heterogeneity of the performance of different units or departments within a hospital-an excellent ICU could be nested in a hospital of generally low quality. 31 Health care in the USA has been much more closely associated with financial incentives. The way in which physicians have responded to the fee-for-service insurance model that prevailed for the majority of the second half of the 20th century has been the focus of much debate. One argument is that this model drives physicians to provide more services, whether they are needed or not, creating a supply-driven market characterised by overuse of services and rising health-care costs. [32] [33] [34] [35] Others suggest that physicians do not respond solely to financial incentives and will modify their behaviour on the basis of their patients' interests. 36 This is in contrast, for example, to a car salesman, who is not expected to prioritise his customers' needs over his own.",

One of their first initiatives is to pressure hospitals to ensure that all ICU patients are cared for by intensive care specialist physicians (intensivists) with appropriate 24 h coverage. Despite numerous studies suggesting better outcome with intensivist-directed care, 5 less than 10% of ICUs have such staffing. 39, 40 Leapfrog has embarked on regional \"rollouts\", and claims that 21% of the ICUs in these regions have now adopted the intensivist staffing model, and another 5% will do so in the coming year. 41 improve care. Guidelines should help to develop standardisation of the capabilities of an ICU. For example, the transition into and out of the ICU needs to be better delineated both to ensure efficient use of resources and to provide a better continuum of care. In the UK, the National Service Frameworks, focused either on a diagnostic or a demographic group, are a form of organisational guideline. 21 The national review of adult critical care services 22 (partly prompted by adverse media coverage) provide clear guidance, based on best available research evidence and professional opinion, on how services should be modernised. Endorsement of the recommendations by government was associated with a major increase in funding for critical care.",

Despite this, clinicians remain sceptical and consider such disclosure has little use. 24 In England and Wales, the Audit Commission relied heavily on risk-adjusted outcome data from the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) Case Mix Programme when undertaking a nationwide audit of critical care. 25, 26 However, the report recognised that even more management information was needed. In the early 1990s, the Greater Cleveland Health Quality and Choice Commission, a local coalition of purchasers, mandated all ICUs to report risk-adjusted mortality. The data were to be used to drive purchasing decisions and, through their public reporting, stimulate improvements in health-care quality. 27 Although there might have been an improvement in outcome over time, it was unclear whether this was driven by the data collection and reporting, 28 and after 4 years the programme was shut down because of cost, lack of clear benefit, and reluctance of some institutions to continue participating.",

In the USA, the Joint Commission of Accreditation Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) is considering making collection of risk-adjusted outcome data mandatory for all hospitals wishing to participate in the Medicare programme, although how this information will be used to deny or approve accreditation is not yet clear. Similar developments in the UK are being led by the Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection (CHAI). The Commission currently depends on a largely administrative database, Hospital Episode Statistics, which is often incomplete, inaccurate, and does not permit adequate risk adjustment. However, the development of specialised clinical databases offers an alternative and their use has been facilitated by the creation of a national Directory of Clinical Databases (www.docdat.org). 29 Currently, ICU reporting relies on specialist risk adjustment tools but their application is limited to care within the ICU. The complexity of extended critical care by multiple providers makes outcomes difficult to interpret and appropriate changes difficult to target. Despite these challenges, outcome assessment is potentially useful in identifying areas of concern. Together with monitoring specific processes, a more Regulation Regulation, both voluntary and compulsory, is increasingly popular with governments and other payers. Types of regulation include hospital and physician credentialling, professional licensure, specialty certification and recertification, and certificates of need. In the USA, the largest hospital regulator is JCAHO, which undertakes regular audits of all hospitals that wish to be considered eligible for the provision of Medicare services. The incentive is clear-if a hospital fails to maintain JCAHO accreditation, it cannot bill for Medicare services. In addition to considering collection of risk-adjusted outcome data, JCAHO has proposed other ICU quality measures, including catheterrelated infection rates, ICU physician staffing patterns, and compliance with several evidence-based ICU processes of care, such as ventilator weaning protocols. 42 This level of detail, measuring actual patients' care processes and outcomes, is part of a broader initiative by JCAHO to develop and implement rigorous quality assessments. In view of the importance of JCAHO accreditation, the use of these measures could have profound, and hopefully beneficial, effects on ICU care in the US. However, the measures are yet to be enforced, there is controversy over their interpretation, and some will be burdensome to collect.",

One notable example of US legislation that greatly affected care of critically ill patients was the 1986 Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA). Before 1986, hospitals did not have to treat all patients who sought care. Thus, a hospital might refuse to provide care to a sick patient if he was likely to consume considerable resources and had no ability to pay. Under EMTALA, such actions became illegal: EMTALA obligated all Medicare-participating hospitals with emergency departments to provide initial care and stabilisation followed by hospital admission or transfer as appropriate to all critically ill persons arriving at their door.",

As articulated in earlier articles in this series, medical error mainly arises from problems of the system, not the individual. 44 Thus, a culture of blame should be avoided in favour of promotion of open disclosure, and greater teamwork and collaboration. The courtroom, which is explicitly about assigning blame, would seem to have little role in this framework. Yet, an interesting phenomenon of medical malpractice in the USA has been the evolving definition of a professional standard of care. Over the last two centuries, the courts have moved from a definition that was locally-defined and based on subjective expert testimony to one that is nationally representative and grounded in strong scientific evidence. 45 As such, the courts increasingly represent a venue in which, theoretically, best evidence-based medicine could be promoted and enforced, and some have argued that legal deterrence is essential in the promotion of health-care quality and patient safety. 45 However, using legal deterrence as a cornerstone of health-care improvement could be ineffective and unpalatable, and might even encourage poor quality care. 46, 47 Thus far, there is little evidence of litigation having either a positive or negative effect on health-care quality. 46, 48, 49 In the USA, only few individuals affected by malpractice claim compensation, 50 settlements are disproportionate and inequitable, 51,52 and the system is very expensive. 53 Reform, therefore, seems essential if this powerful tool is to be used effectively to improve care. There are numerous proposed solutions, ranging from caps on payment for damages, to a complete overhaul and adoption of a no-fault system, where compensation for injury is not dependent on individual blame. 47 But no reform is under any serious consideration in the USA. Although the UK does not face a similar \"tort crisis\", there is increasing concern that errors are prolific in UK hospitals, and that the current legal system does not help, and might worsen, error reduction. Therefore, the government has proposed separation of systems designed to achieve accountability for adverse events from those designed to compensate patients. 54 ",

First, the responsibility for clinical processes can be shifted between professions, most commonly involving nurses taking on tasks traditionally performed by doctors. At present, the lack of high quality research on the effect of such changes in the care of the critically ill patient precludes clear policy advice. 55 Responsibilities can also be transferred by introducing new categories of staff. Physician assistants, developed in the 1960s for primary care, now work in secondary care as well. 56 Although their potential role in care of the critically ill is unclear at present, substitution of one profession for another offers another potential approach to improving patients' safety. 57 Second, changes can be made in the availability of care, in particular the balance of services (eg, ratio of number of intensive care to high dependency beds). Again, such operational planning is severely limited by our knowledge of the appropriate uses of different services. For that, we need to understand more about the costs and benefits of each option. For example, the clinical indications for stepping up or stepping down care and for inter-hospital transfers.",

There are two potential models for regionalisation: close small hospitals and consolidate services in a few, large institutions or create different levels of ICU on the basis of resources and expertise, such as those proposed recently by the American College of Critical Care, 61 and triage patients such that the sickest patients are transferred to the highest level ICUs. The second model is more politically acceptable and has already been implemented in neonatal intensive care and trauma care with evidence of improved outcomes. [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] The British Paediatric Association has recommended a similar model for care of critically ill children (>1 month of age) in the UK, although their conclusions can be challenged for lacking a good evidence base. 72, 73 There are barriers to regionalisation, however, and implementation is often incomplete. In the USA, 40% of all neonates who are ventilated and die do so without transfer to a tertiary care centre. 74 In the UK, one attempt to regionalise trauma care was stymied by the reluctance of clinicians in hospitals providing the lowest intensity care to refer their complex \"more interesting\" patients to the regional centre. 75 Furthermore, ICU patients are admitted from several sources (home, hospital ward, operating room, etc), which presents significant logistical problems for a regionalised system.",

The relative importance of the advantages and disadvantages will depend to some extent on the context.

Without these, it will prove impossible for clinicians and hospital managers to justify the resources they need now and in the future. Efforts to tie performance measures to financial incentives, such as the JCAHO efforts, hold promise. Greater public education and awareness will be important for generating advocacy and political will for change. Ultimately, however, significant and sustainable improvements in patients' care and safety will demand fairly large changes in the way professions and institutions inter-relate. In particular, greater use of regionalised care, akin to US state trauma systems, and greater use of physician-extenders, such as nurse practitioners, seems warranted. These changes are necessary not only to meet current demands on health care but also to meet the growing challenges of technological advances and pressures on creating and maintaining a high quality health-care workforce and delivery system. 76, 77, 84 ",
