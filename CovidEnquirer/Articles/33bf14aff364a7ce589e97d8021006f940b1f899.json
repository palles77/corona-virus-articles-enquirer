The results presented by Lipkin and colleagues in mBio (1, 2) do not establish either of these conditions. In fact, identification of the reservoir host requires knowledge of the incidence rate to measure the transmissibility, which can be achieved by conducting a large-scale follow-up of cohort surveys or at least serial cross-sectional surveys, not one cross-sectional seroprevalence survey. Alternatively, we may implement a simple camel-tocamel transmission experiment with uninfected camel groups and no opportunity for human-to-human transmission, which could also inform us about any potential of this form of MERS-CoV transmissibility. Thus, as the authors correctly stated \"Although we speculate that DC are potential reservoirs for human transmission, we cannot prove this relationship from the current data\"; it is important that they carefully fulfill the above-mentioned conditions of reservoir dynamics before making speculations.",

            "text": "As for camel-to-human MERS-CoV transmission, several points can be raised that contradict these authors' findings as to whether this form of transmission can or cannot happen. In fact, the reported outcomes by the authors, together with no more than two cases of infection in humans reported over the past 2 years to have been in close proximity to DCs (10, 11) , indicate at most that a virus that is \"closely related\" to MERS-CoV has been circulating in DCs for the last 2 decades in Saudi Arabia. Additionally, it might be possible that MERS-CoV cannot be transmitted from DCs to humans, as happened previously between cats and humans during the SARS-CoV epidemic (12) . Of course, we understand that identification of the route of transmission from DCs to human beings (if any) would be of utmost importance and (if confirmed) could lead directly to implementation of prevention and intervention strategies. Unfortunately, however, the transmission capability of MERS-CoV from DCs to humans cannot yet be ascertained. Thus, claiming that DCs harbor the infectious form of MERS-CoV does not support the conclusion that they are the source of transmission to humans. It must be confirmed that this form of transmission can actually occur. We suggest addressing this conundrum by the viral culture of MERS-CoV, during which it is imperative to first isolate the virus (preferably the three genotypic variants) from DCs, then to infect epithelial cells of human airway tissues derived from nasal or tracheobronchial regions with the isolated virus, and thereafter, to note the cytopathological changes in the infected cells. This will also provide a useful in vitro model of human lung origin to study the characteristics of MERS-CoV replication and pathogenesis (such as identifying specific cell surface receptors for MERS-CoV). Therefore, an explicit assessment of the epidemiological role of DCs has yet to be made.",

            "text": "Human-to-camel MERS-CoV transmission is also of importance. There is no doubt that everyone can question whether such form of transmission is actually happening in the case of MERS, but no one can deny it either. Ordinarily, all new pathogens are believed to emerge from animals (i.e., the source or reservoir) when ecological changes increase the pathogen's opportunities to enter the human population (i.e., the new host) and to generate subsequent human-to-human transmission. However, we might consider the reverse in the following scenario: a new host (i.e., DCs) acquires a new infectious agent (i.e., MERS-CoV) that emerges from an unknown source of infection (humans or any other source). Once infected, DCs will rapidly produce antibodies to MERS-CoV, and if the virus cannot induce a disease (i.e., MERS), DCs will have no clinical signs, viremia, or fatality cases. Now, if we assume that this infectious agent has an evolutionary rescue (e.g., genetic mutations) to enable its adaptation to the new environment, DCs will have an infectious agent with a set of genetic variants (genotypes) that differ from the original one. Therefore, we can clearly see that it is plausible to assume that humans (or any other source) are the ones who infected DCs in the first place. In fact, domestic cats, living in Hong Kong, were reported in 2003 to be infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) originating from humans (13) . Likewise, Memish (10) detected MERS-CoV sequences in a DC owned by an individual infected by MERS. Therefore, the presence of antibodies, viral nucleic acids, and quasispecies variants of MERS-CoV detected by the authors in their sampled DCs may suggest that dromedaries can be naturally infected with MERS-CoV from infected humans, although how this happens is yet unclear. Nonetheless, we should test archived human samples to demonstrate whether humans can be implicated or whether MERS-CoV truly emerges as a human pathogen prior to 2012 or not. In addition, we should entertain the idea that MERS-CoV in DCs (i.e., the new host) may adapt again and eventually lead to reemergence of the disease in human populations and subsequently to a massive epidemic attack, which, as we previously argued, is the key driver in the current debate.",
