The chief obstacles to successful treatment are the enormous number of microorganisms associated with the syndrome (-200 different viruses or atypical bacteria, see Table 1 ) and the problem of diagnosis; for example, it is only recently that the importance of rhino-No effective treatment for common colds has yet been developed. Combination antiviral and anti-inflammatory therapies are the best hope for intervention after the onset of symptoms. Prophylaxis, especially in the form of vaccination, would have a major impact in disease prevention. These approaches offer new avenues for treating populations at risk and are of particular significance to those with asthma or chronic bronchitis.",

There are numerous factors influencing the epidemiology of upper respiratory tract viral infections, including individual and community immunity, seasonal variation, smoking, psychological stress, socioeconomic factors, such as nutrition and population density, and, perhaps most importantly of all, family structure. It is well known that preschool and schoolage children are the most frequent route by which new viruses are introduced into families. In addition to the common cold, upper respiratory tract viral infections are associated with more-severe disease, particularly in the presence of other significant disease. Virus infections have been associated with as many as 85% of exacerbations of asthma in children 4 and 40-60% of exacerbations in adultsL Other common complications include otitis media 6 and sinusitis 7, although detailed epidemiological studies have not, as yet, been carried out to accurately quantify the risk for individual agents.",

Amantidine and rimantidine are effective only against influenza type A and are recommended for use only in the presence of clear virological and epidemiological evidence of influenza A infection in the community. They should be used prophylactically for 6-8 weeks by at-risk populations, such as the elderly, those with other chronic afflictions (e.g. asthma or chronic bronchitis) and those within community groups, whether vaccinated or not.

            "text": "It has long been known that virus-specific strands of DNA or RNA, complementary to viral messenger or genomic RNA, can anneal to viral RNA in virusinfected cells to produce an antiviral effect. The principal mode of action appears to be RNA degradation via RNase H. Inhibition of RSV replication has been shown in vitro using oligonucleotides directed at singlestranded regions of the RSV polymerase (L) gene sz. The 2-5A pathway is involved in the antiviral actions of interferon s3, and the 2-5A-antisense concept is designed to enhance the efficiency of antisense oligonucleotides in vivo by specifically harnessing the activity of a ubiquitous intracellular RNase called 2-5Adependent RNase (RNase L). In this strategy, an activator of 2-5A-dependent RNase is conjugated to the antisense oligonucleotides specific to the viral target. The result is highly specific and efficient cleavage of viral RNA. Studies in vitro have shown that this system works for nonviral RNA targets s4, and viral targets are currently being studied.",

One attractive proposition would be the development of an antagonist that had functional activity against both proteinases, as this would be a single compound that was capable of treating 60-75% of common colds.",

The generation of these T-cell responses normally requires endogenous expression of the antigen, as occurs in natural infection. A recent study has shown that plasmid DNA encoding the nucleocapsid protein of influenza type A evokes specific T-cell responses after injection into skeletal muscle in mice and also protects against subsequent challenge with a heterologous strain of influenza sT. There is clearly a long way to go before a vaccine suitable for use in humans is developed, but the potential is exciting.",

The major barriers to the development of effective treatments are the multiplicity of agents involved, difficulties with drug delivery, potency and toxicity, the fact that viral replication peaks just before or on the first day of symptoms and the emergence of drug-resistant strains. However, newer molecular methods and a better understanding of viral immunology are leading to encouraging developments in both vaccine research and the development of more-potent antagonists.",
