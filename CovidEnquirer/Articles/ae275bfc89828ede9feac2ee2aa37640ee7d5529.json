The Task Force includes representatives of allopathic and osteopathic medicine, nursing and nurse practitioners, dentistry, pharmacy, and physician assistants. The Task Force aims to accomplish the Healthy People 2010 goal of increasing the prevention content of clinical health professional education. The Curriculum Framework provides a structure for organizing curriculum, monitoring curriculum, and communicating within and among professions. The Framework contains four components: evidence base for practice, clinical preventive services-health promotion, health systems and health policy, and community aspects of practice. The full Framework includes 19 domains. The title \"Clinical Prevention and Population Health\" has been carefully chosen to include both individual-and population-oriented prevention efforts. It is recommended that all participating clinical health professions use this title when referring to this area of curriculum. The Task Force recommends that each profession systematically determine whether appropriate items in the Curriculum Framework are included in its standardized examinations for licensure and certification and for program accreditation.

Nevertheless, a focus on prevention and population health continues to lag behind the emphasis on one-on-one treatment. Until prevention is thoroughly integrated into all aspects of our healthcare system, measurable progress addressing these issues will elude us.",

Although not specifically recommended by Healthy People 2010, 13 if a prevention framework is to be widely used, it must be widely accepted across the core health professions-a goal that will be achievable if the framework is developed by leaders from the core clinical professions. The task of developing such a framework provided the impetus for the Association of Teachers of Preventive Medicine (ATPM) to join with the Associa-tion of Academic Health Centers to convene the Healthy People Curriculum Task Force, which is composed of a senior academic member and the executive director (or designee) from the following clinical health professional organizations: The Task Force also includes representation from the Student Health Alliance (a consortium of 11 health profession student organizations) and two resource groups, the Association of Schools of Public Health (ASPH) and Community-Campus Partnerships for Health. This unprecedented assemblage of diverse health professions stakeholders developed the Clinical Prevention and Population Health Curriculum Framework (Framework) that could be used by students from at least the seven represented health professions. The progenitor for the Framework was conceived almost 20 years ago when ATPM assembled a group of leaders in prevention to articulate the basic prevention content for a comprehensive medical education curriculum. The resulting Inventory of Knowledge and Skills Relating to Disease Prevention and Health Promotion provided the guidepost for schools' efforts to broaden prevention training. Despite the intent that this document be \"shared across many disciplines,\" it was associated with medical training and rarely used by other health professions. 14 -16",
