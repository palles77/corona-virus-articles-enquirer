The autoAb were directed to a 40-kDa protein present in mouse liver and kidney. The autoAg was isolated and identified as fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH), a soluble cytosolic enzyme that mediates the hydrolytic formation of fumarate and acetoacetate [10] . Furthermore, during FAH purification we found that the autoAb detected more weakly another liver protein, which turned to be the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). There was no correlation between the IgG titers and the presence of autoAb to liver FAH in CBA/Ht mice, suggesting that the autoAb production was not related to the non-specific polyclonal activation of B-lymphocytes produced after viral infection. Additionally, mice immunized with extracts of mouse liver did not develop autoAb, thus discarding the release of a self-antigen as the mechanism involved in the autoimmune response elicited by MHV-infection [10] .",

Thus, whereas western-blot assays indicated that autoAb were directed to cryptic FAH epitopes in all sera tested, ELISA results indicated that some of these same sera did recognize native epitopes of the autoAg (Fig. 1) . These results could be explained taking into consideration that insolubilized proteins expose cryptic epitopes while still retaining some conformational features [17, 18] . Since proteins submitted to SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose should be more denatured than those insolubilized on plastic surface, it is possible that the autoAb detected both conformational and cryptic epitopes in ELISA and only cryptic determinants in western-blot assays. So, sera showing lack of competition by the soluble autoAg in both protocols should have autoAb directed mostly to cryptic epitopes of the FAH, whereas those displaying dissimilar reactivity may have a mixture of autoAb directed to both hidden and conformational antigenic determinants of the enzyme.",

Accordingly, results presented in this work indicate that MHV-infection triggers a cross-reaction of either sequential or conformational epitopes from both the viral proteins and the autoAg. Data also suggest that MHV-infected mice could develop at least three different Ab populations: Ab directed either to viral proteins or to the autoAg, and cross-reacting Ab. The observation that immune responses undergo determinant spreading is a major finding shaping current theories regarding autoimmunity and molecular mimicry [20] . Therefore, immune diversification originated from only a single autoreactive determinant, i.e., a common sequence, could probably provide a pathway for the generation of the multifaceted autoimmune response described in this paper.",

It has been proposed that this protein concentration is just sufficient to induce complete tolerance of T cells, whereas B cells are not tolerized [24, 25] . Although the concentration of liver FAH in serum is not known, its similarity in MW and localization with HPPD [10, 24, 25] enabled us to speculate that a T cell effect similar to that proposed by N.A. Mitchinson and colleagues [22e25] may take place in our model. Reactivity of synthetic peptides with sera from mice immunized with rat liver FAH.

Results are expressed as specific optical density values for Ab binding to sequences corresponding to rat liver FAH (black bars) or the indicated different MHV proteins (white bars).
