Their structures were confirmed by 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR as well as LC/MS. The cytotoxicity of these novel isatins against human leukemia K562 cells were evaluated by MTT assay in vitro. SAR studies indicated that the N-substituted benzyl and C-5 substituted phenyl groups greatly enhance their cytotoxic activity, whereas an intact carbonyl functionality on C-3 present in the parent ring is required to maintain such a potency. Particularly, N-(p-methoxybenzyl)-5-(p-methoxyphenyl)isatin (compound 2m)",

            "text": "Isatins are a class of structurally versatile molecules and their core structure appears in many biologically active molecules and pharmaceutical agents. Isatin derivatives have been reported to possess a broad spectrum of activities such as anticancer [1, 2] , antidepressant [3] , anticonvulsant [4] , antifungal [5] , anti-HIV [6] and anti-inflammatory [7] , etc. In the last decade, N-substituted isatins have attracted increasing attention from both industry and academia. Vine et al. has reported that some N-benzyl isatin derivatives were more cytotoxic than their N-H counterparts toward some lymphoma cells as well as a series of human cancer cell lines, including human leukemic (K562, U937 and Jurkat), liver (HepG2), breast (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7), prostate (PC-3) and colorectal (HCT-116) cell lines [8] . Chen's and Chiyanzu's groups reported that N-substituted isatin derivatives exhibited inhibition activities against SARS CoV 3CLpro and parasitic cysteine proteases [9, 10] . Later on, Limpachayaporn and Liu found that 5-sulfonylisatin analogues could act as caspase-3,7 inhibitors and SARS-CoV 3C-like protease inhibitors [11, 12] . In addition, Chinnasamy's group found that some N-1 and C-5 disubstituted molecules such as 1-(substituted benzylidene)-3-(1-(morpholino/piperidinomethyl)-2,3-dioxoindolin-5-yl)urea derivatives exhibited antiepileptic activity and neurotoxicity [13] . Previously, we reported some 5-(2carboxyethenyl)isatin derivatives as anticancer agents, and found that the combination of a 5-[trans-2-(methoxycarbonyl)ethen-1yl] group and a 1-(4-methoxybenzyl) group (compound 5e61, Fig. 1 ) in isatin significantly enhanced it's cytotoxic activity [14] . However, further research on this molecule indicated that the presence of a metabolically unstable acrylic ester moiety on the C-5 position is the key to its in vivo efficacy. In order to further improve the antitumor property of this type of 1,5-disubstituted isatin molecules, we have synthesized a serious of isatin derivatives and studied their cytotoxicity. The results showed that although the substituent of 5-methacrylate could increase the antitumor activity of the target compound, it is not stable in metabolic processes (unpublished data). Therefore, we report a series of new compounds in this paper, which can maintain good anti-tumor efficacy even without the use of 5-methacrylate substituents. Among them, compound 2m was shown as the most active compound against human leukemia K562 cells. Moreover, the molecular mechanism of the cytotoxic activity of compound 2m was explored on antimigration and anti-angiogenesis.",

Further examination of the structure difference and the cytotoxic data of the compounds 2d and 2f-2v against K562 showed that the substituted benzyl group did increase the potency. The improvement in potency does not seem to be related to the electron density of the substituent groups (2f, 2r and 2h, 2l); however, the substituents' size (2k, 2p) and location (2n and 2m, 2o) plays a more significant role.
