The reasons for the inclusion of antibiotics in feed are outlined and discussed. In the first case, feedsluffs may have to be medicated for reasons of disease prevention and control. In large herds, especially in loose housing, mass medication by injection is not possible and even minimal disease herds will become infected with airborne pathogens from time to time. In the second case, continuous low-level feeding of antibiotics to growing pigs (growth promoters) suppresses the growth of harmful bacteria and allows healthier pigs to grow faster and more efficiently, thus producing cheaper food at the same time as improving welfare. The legal requirements regarding medicines available only on prescription are outlined and discussed. The fears and worries of the general public are noted and found to be overstated because of misconceptions and misunderstanding. It is concluded that food and milk produced today will remain safe provided the safety rules are adhered to.",

More recently, the legislation was amended by The Medicines (Medicated) Animal Feedingstuffs Regulations 1992 (again under Section 40). Under The Medicines Act, antibiotics have been classified into two groups: feed antibiotics and therapeutic antibiotics. This division was recommended by the Swann report (Anon., 1979) , in an attempt to curb the use of sub-therapeutic levels of antibiotics in animal production. Legislation introduced by the Commission of the European Communities allocated antimicrobial agents into one of three categories depending on the proposed use of the product, the date of introduction of the product and certain safety criteria. Annex 1 and Annex 2 products refer to antibiotics available under the Pharmacy Medicine List (PML) category in the UK and are covered by EEC Directive 70/524. The third category refers to prescription-only medicines (POM), which are controlled under EEC Directive 90/107. The provisions of these directives have been incorporated into the UK legislation.",

Before addressing the fears of the general public, however, the background and need to use antibiotics in animal foodstuffs will be discussed. Alexander ( 1971 ) summarised the rapidly changing trends in agriculture towards larger and more specialised units, towards more effective pig improvement and towards more integration and industrialisation. At the same time, pig keeping in particular has tended to concentrate in certain geographical areas for reasons that are not relevant to this paper. New hybrids with greater potential for growth and better food conversion efficiency have been introduced, thus making the production of food cheaper. This is extremely laudable when one considers that large numbers of people throughout the world are either on the poverty line or below it. However, little attention has been given to the development of genotypes resistant to disease, and at the same time new diseases have continued to appear, e.g. the porcine respiratory coronavirus and the virus of Blue Eared Pig Disease (Porcine Respiratory and Reproductive Syndrome). No matter how high the standard of husbandry, large populations of animals are susceptible to outbreaks of disease in the same way as individuals are.",

Treatment of both clinical and subclinical disease will reduce the excretion rate of pathogens, many of which have the potential for affecting humans. To maintain high welfare standards, it is imperative that the farmer should be allowed to use all legitimate means available to reduce the suffering of affected animals.

It would be unreasonable and counter-productive to treat individual animals in these cases. The stress of chasing and catching each pig in turn, or indeed the herding of pigs in a strawed yard into a catching pen would cause serious welfare problems which could not be justified. Indeed, it would be 'anti-welfare' to wait until an animal was clinically ill before instituting therapy. Because of these constraints, it is usually necessary to treat pigs and poultry by including medication in the diet. Although some therapeutic agents may be included in the water, the water system in most farms is unsuitable for this form of medication. Water should also be regarded as a nutrient (Brooks et at., 1989) , so, by definition, water medication is no different from feed medication in that sense. Nevertheless, watersoluble drugs are usually more expensive to buy and also to use because of waste by the animals, e.g. nipple drinkers. There are no vaccines available for many bacterial and viral pathogens, and in other cases, even when vaccines have been produced, they may not be licensed for use in some countries.",

The growth rate of CR animals can be increased to almost that of the GF animals by feeding low levels of antibiotics continuously. The increase in food conversion efficiency and better growth rate allow production of cheaper meat, as the antibiotics in use are comparatively cheap. The animals, of course, are also healthier. It is suggested that antimicrobial substances have a growth promotional effect through their actions on enteric bacteria by one or more of the following mechanisms (McKinnon, 1985 ) : ( 1 ) reduced production of harmful bacterial metabolites; (2) suppression of potentially pathogenic organisms; (3) suppression of competition for nutrients; (4) alteration in metabolic activity; (5) enhanced intestinal absorptive capacity.",

In addition, in the UK, those incorporating medicinal products into animal feedstuffs must be registered with the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, and this includes farm mill and mixers as well as compounders. In the UK, the veterinarian has therefore to establish that the drug he or she wishes to use is licensed for use and that the farmer is registered with the Pharmaceutical Society should he or she be a home mixer. The latter ruling may be waived in an emergency, but this would only be regarded as a one-off situation. However, even if these criteria can be fulfilled, the practitioner must ensure that the drug can be administered and deployed in such a way that no residues in meat will occur. Instructions for the use of each licensed drug are given in a data sheet which accompanies the drug. When in-feed use of the drug is intended, the data sheet will provide information on the inclusion rate, e.g. x g of drug per tonne of finished feed. However, an inclusion rate is not a dose rate (x mg of drug kg-1 liveweight) and, in many instances, if the directions in the data sheet were adhered to, the animals would be under-dosed. Examples include newly weaned pigs with poor feed intake and pregnant sows on a restricted diet. The practitioner must therefore assess the average food intake of each group of pigs before issuing a veterinary written directive. The practitioner is allowed to alter the official inclusion rate if it is required in the interests of animal welfare, but in this case all responsibility for drug failure, toxic reactions, etc., automatically falls on the practitioner's shoulders. Each licensed drug has a stated withdrawal period before slaughter and this should ensure that no residues can occur.",

For example, some penicillins are destroyed by pelleting whereas others are destroyed by the acid in the stomach. On the whole, veterinary written directives are not issued indiscriminately or indeed on request of the farmer. Medication regimes are never continuous for several reasons. A veterinary written directive can only be issued to cover a period of 30 days at the most. The cost of continuous medication would be prohibitive in most cases and it would not be in the interests of good veterinary practice. Once a disease has been controlled, other methods of prevention are usually examined, e.g. reduction in stocking density or alteration of the management system. On occasions, the veterinarian will be aware that certain diseases are likely to arise from time to time and it is only by strategic pre-emptive or preventive medication that these can be controlled. A good example is Porcine Intestinal Adenomatosis, the causal bacterium of which is present in most herds irrespective whether they are minimal disease or otherwise.",

            "text": "The report of the joint committee on the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry and veterinary medicine (the Swann report (Anon., 1979) ) suggested that growth promoting antibiotics should not be used for the control of treatment of disease and therapeutic antibiotics should not be used for growth promotion. One of the reasons for this demarcation was based on the fallacious misconception that low-level use of antibiotics selected resistant strains of bacteria which were capable of transferring this resistance to other bacteria. Transference of resistance does occur. However, to select resistant strains from a bacterial population, one has to apply some form of inhibitory pressure, to allow the recognition of resistant variants, and such inhibitory pressure can only be applied by therapeutic concentrations of antibiotics (Walton, 1988) , i.e. the minimal inhibitory concentration of an antibiotic must be exceeded to select resistant strains. Shearer (1990) , discussing fears related to human health, stated that there were four main areas of concern. First, there was a fear that people might become sensitised to drugs and develop allergies on exposure to drug residues in food. However, whether drugs at typical residue levels (usually sub-parts per million) could cause such an effect is unclear. A second fear related to the possibility of residues of drugs which have carcinogenic properties. These drugs include the stilbenes, such as diethyl stilboestrol, hexoestrol and dienoestrol, which are now banned substances. Other drugs with carcinogenic properties and still licensed for use in some countries include carbadox and olaquindox (not in the UK). The third area of concern related to the interference in trade between countries in which the laws are different, e.g. the EEC ban on meat from the USA because of the use of hormones in that country. Finally, the most common cause of concern related to the possible emergence of resistant strains of bacteria and the appearance of such strains in the human food chain or the transference of such resistance to bacteria commonly found in humans. This has led to the fear of disease in humans which could not be treated by antibiotics. However, the results of two large studies in the USA, one large study in Europe and another in the UK indicated that, in general, antibiotic resistance was not increasing (Walton, 1988) . Indeed, there was no evidence forthcoming to show that there was a linkage between bacterial antibiotic resistance in man and antibiotics commonly used in agriculture. Hindsight suggests that antibiotic resistance problems in man are the direct result of use of antibiotics in man or perhaps even the misuse of antibiotics in man. The question of bacteria in animals, resistant to antibiotics, infecting man and causing untreatable disease is often raised. Fortunately, the majority of animal bacteria are incapable of colonising the tissues of man. Nevertheless, some can and do, e.g. some Campylobacter species and Salmonella species. Certain phage types of Salmonella typhimurium have become selected, not by antibiotic use, but by calf marketing networks, which leads to a mobile population of infected and non-infected susceptible animals which have been moved and mixed on several occasions (Sojka et al., 1986 ). These salmonellae may transfer genes for multiple resistance and do occasionally infect humans because of errors in food handling, plant failure and personal hygiene. Multiple antibiotic resistance in bacteria can be readily controlled by applying a suitable prescribing policy by which antibiotics are rotated and certain antibiotics are kept for serious systemic bacterial infections (Walton, 1988) .",

The indiscriminate use of oestrogens in cattle caused high tissue residues and resulted in the abnormal development of certain tissues in human babies in Italy. However, the likelihood of in-feed therapeutic antibiotics resulting in tissue residues in the UK is very low. Legislation is now in force which makes it an offence to sell or present for sale animals containing residues of antibiotic above permitted maximum tolerance levels. Testing methodology and techniques have now become so sophisticated that levels of less than 0.1 ppm can be detected. The maximum permitted level of sulphonamide residues is 0.1 ppm and this level is 2000 times the human safety factor. A recent government survey has shown that tissue levels of antibiotic residues have steadily fallen, but there is still a problem with positive sulphonamide residues, which remain around the 5% level in samples examined. This is disappointing, but the fault does not always lie with the farmer or veterinary surgeon. In the first instance, occasional positives may arise as a result of unusual circumstances affecting the individual in a population. For example, a low metabolic rate, or damaged kidneys or liver, or variation in the proportion of different tissues in the same species can occur.",
