Specifically, the appropriate PPE items must be selected and removed correctly to minimize the risk of exposure. However, several studies suggest that PPE use is inadequate [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] and that correct use varies by type of HCW 8 and clinical area. 9 Experience during the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic have highlighted the need for the appropriate use of PPE to reduce HCW exposure to respiratory infections. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] There are many published studies that have focused on hand hygiene compliance [16] [17] [18] [19] or the use of 1 type of PPE 9,20 among HCWs. To our knowledge, there have been no observational studies examining overall PPE use among HCWs entering and leaving the rooms of patients with febrile respiratory illness (FRI). We therefore conducted an audit to observe the selection and removal of PPE, as well as to determine when hand hygiene is performed by HCWs upon entry and exit into the rooms of FRI patients in Canadian hospitals.",

Observers collected data on the selection and removal of PPE. Hand hygiene following the removal of gloves, gown and mask, and/or eye protection was also observed. Trained observers included infection control professionals or students who were provided with instructions on how to complete the audit form and how to best observe HCWs. Whereas staff on care units were not informed in advance of the audit, no attempt was made to disguise the purpose of the observations. Patient rooms in which the HCWs PPE selection and removal could not be observed were excluded (eg, an anteroom without a window). Signs were posted outside of patient rooms describing additional precautions and what PPE were required. The Public Health Agency of Canada's guidelines Prevention and Control of Influenza During a Pandemic for all Healthcare Settings (Annexe F) was used to determine PPE requirements for an FRI patient. 22 Instructions for the correct procedure to remove PPE were provided on the audit form and were further defined, when necessary, according to the facility's infection prevention and control policy. The correct sequence of PPE removal was defined in the following order: gloves, gown, eye protection, and then mask. 22 A mask was defined as either an N95 respirator or surgical (procedure) mask. Eye protection was defined as either a face shield/mask combination or goggles. Eyeglasses were not considered to be eye protection. 22 Observers were asked to identify the occupation of the observed HCW to the best of their ability, without asking the HCW. If they did not know the occupation, they selected the \"don't know\" response. A nurse was defined as a nursing assistant, nursing aid, or registered nurse. Allied health professional included respiratory therapists, occupational therapists, laboratory technicians and x-ray technicians. A student was defined as an intern, a resident, or a health care profession student.",

Although we did not collect data on availability of PPE, it is possible that PPE was not readily available. 23, 24 In addition, risk perception has been known to influence the use of PPE. 4, 25, 26 For example, HCWs working in pediatric units may feel less at risk of being infected and therefore less likely to wear PPE. Time pressures, perceived or real, may also influence the decision to wear PPE and may explain the poor adherence with PPE in EDs and among physicians.",

This potential bias arises when the act of being observed influences the behavior of the individual being observed. It is possible that the presence of an auditor may have artificially increased adherence with PPE use. Nonetheless, observational studies have been very useful in demonstrating gaps in recommended infection prevention and control measures despite the potential for overestimation of adherence. 1, 3, [7] [8] [9] Second, our findings may not be generalizable to all HCW populations because only HCWs in large, acute care, tertiary hospitals were observed. Finally, our findings included only those situations in which HCWs could be observed. If there was a systematic difference in the adherence to PPE and hand hygiene according to whether the HCW was or was not observed, this could have altered the findings of our study in a direction that is difficult to predict. Our sense is that PPE and hand hygiene would be performed even more poorly in situations in which the HCW could not be observed, and our findings actually represent a best case scenario.",
