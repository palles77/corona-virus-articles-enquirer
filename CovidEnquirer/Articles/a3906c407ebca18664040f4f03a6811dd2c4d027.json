In this study, we characterized the substrate specificity of TV protease in trans using recombinant proteases and TV polyprotein fragments containing the predicted proteolytic cleavage sites. Cleavage products have been obtained from 4 of the 5 fragments containing 573 Q-S 574 between the helicase and 3A-like protein, 712 E-A 713 between the 3A-like protein and Vpg, 802 E-G 803 between Vpg and the protease, and 976 E-G 977 between the protease and RdRp. We also characterized the enzymatic activities of the recombinant proteases of TV and Norwalk virus using synthetic fluorogenic peptide substrates. Under optimal conditions for enzymatic assays, partial cross-reactivities on reciprocal substrates were observed between TV and Norwalk virus proteases. The apparently shared substrate specificities between TV and Norwalk virus proteases suggested that the cultivable TV could be used as a model for in vivo evaluation of lead candidates of protease inhibitors for human norovirus.",

These data suggest that NoV proteases form dimers (Nakamura et al., 2005; Zeitler et al., 2006) and display a trypsin or chymotrypsin-like serine protease fold, involving a nucleophilic cysteine thiol (at amino acid residue 139) in the catalytic triad (Zeitler et al., 2006) .

Based on this conservation of substrate cleavage sites, we proposed a cleavage map for the TV nonstructural polyprotein . In this study, four of the five predicted cleavage sites of the TV polyprotein have been experimentally validated using recombinant polyprotein fragments by in trans cleavage followed by N-terminal sequencing. The cleavage sites between Vpg and protease, and between protease and RdRp share the same dipeptide residues of E/G. The amino acid residues at the other two sites seemed variable with Q/S between the helicase and 3A-like protein and E/A between 3A-like protein and Vpg. The cleavage at Q/S or E/A sites seems to be more efficient than at the E/G sites, according to the band intensities of the cleaved products (data not shown). Although the cleavage site between N-terminus protein and NTPase could not be validated by the N-terminal sequence analysis, the Q/S scissile bond at amino acid residues 233-234 remains to be the primary candidate for the cleavage, because this was the only one could potentially be cleaved by TV protease within the adjacent 133 amino acid residues. Despite a lack of example for other calicivirus proteases, our result on the cleavage between helicase and 3A-like protein suggested that the Q/S scissile bond could be an efficient cleavage site for CV protease (Fig. 2B) .",

As shown in Table 2 , the protease cleavage sites of polyproteins from the CV family are well conserved. It is interesting to note that a Q at the P1 position appears more often in between the N-terminal protein and helicase, and between the helicase and 3Alike protein; whereas an E at the P1 position appears more often between Vpg and the protease and between the protease and RdRp. Vpg, protease, and RdRp have been known to co-exist as precursor protein fragments during the early stage of polyprotein processing (Belliot et al., 2003) . The differential preference for specific amino acid residues at the P1 position could be one of the regulatory mechanisms in the control of polyprotein processing. In this study, we also characterized the enzymatic activities of recombinant TV protease and a NoV protease using FRET substrates. FRET protease assays have been used in characterizations of several viral proteases, such as those of the SARS-Coronavirus (Blanchard et al., 2004; Grum-Tokars et al., 2008) , hepatitis C virus (Mao et al., 2008; Santos et al., 2009 ), yellow fever virus (Kondo et al., 2011) , and foot-and-month disease virus (Jaulent et al., 2007) . During the preparation of the manuscript, Chang et al. also reported the characterization and inhibition of proteases of two norovirus genogroups using FRET assays (Chang et al., 2012) . Unlike other reports on FRET protease activity assays, the Hylite Fluor488 dye and QXL520 quencher were used to label the peptide substrates in our study. Hylite Fluor488 is a new type of fluorophore that provides superior fluorescence quantum yield and a longer emission wavelength, whereas QXL520 has been proven to be an efficient quencher for Hylite Fluor488. The Hylite Fluor 488/QXL520-based FRET peptide shows less interference from autofluorescence of test compounds, thus providing a better assay sensitivity. Our results showed that this newly developed fluorescent dye and quencher pair was effective for the assay. Optimization experiments with the NoV protease showed that the protease was mostly active at a pH between 8 and 8.5, without the need for additional ionic salts. This optimal pH is very similar to that reported for the Chiba virus in NoV genogroup II . While the presence of glycerol enhanced the protease activities, a low concentration of DMSO (up to 10%) did not affect the enzyme activities. This is important for our future studies in the screening for inhibitors against the NoV protease, because most synthetic compounds are dissolved in DMSO. We also found that the TV and NoV proteases can cleave each other's substrate in the PRET assays. Since NoVs remain uncultivable in vitro, the observed reciprocal enzymatic activities between the NoV/TV proteases suggest that TV could serve as a surrogate for NoVs in future antiviral designs targeting at the protease.",
