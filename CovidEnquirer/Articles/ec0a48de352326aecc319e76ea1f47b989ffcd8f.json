This indicates that pure rat oligodendrocytes rapidly become class I-positive by conditions associated with cultivation and also that soluble class I inducers originating from other cell types were not involved in the rat, as they are in the mouse (18) . With respect to possible enhanced expression of the existing levels of class I antigens as a result of infection (18) , Fig . 2 shows that control glial cellconditioned supernatants containing no JHM virus induced class I antigens on naive cultures (Fig. 2a) to the same degree as virus containing supernatants in Lewis (Fig. 2b) , BN (2c), and congenic Lewis.BN cultures (Fig. 2d) . Therefore, no increase in either the percentage or fluorescence intensity of class I antigenpositive cells could be attributed to JHM virus . The shift of the entire population of fluorescing cells to higher fluorescence intensity channels produced by conditioned supernatant is consistent with the enhancement of class I antigens primarily on spontaneously expressing cells (Fig. 2) .",

Increased expression of class I antigens on rat astrocytes and oligodendrocytes is not related to JHM viral infection as it is in the mouse (18) .
