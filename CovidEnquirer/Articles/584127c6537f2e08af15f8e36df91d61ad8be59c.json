Severe Acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) originated from southern China and rapidly spread to many countries in early 2003 with over 8000 cases worldwide. 1 Human infection due to a highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus was first described in a mini-outbreak from Hong Kong in 1997. Since 2003, there were many reports of the infection in wide birds and domestic poultry in many countries. Since then, more than 150 human cases and 80 deaths have been reported. 2 Both infections are of animal origins and the viruses have jumped the species barrier. Children infected with SARS usually developed mild disease, 3 but the reported mortality for children infected with avian flu was more than 50%. 4 Early and proper isolation of infected individuals along with strict public health measures are important in controlling these infections. 5 ",

The incubation period is between 5-10 days. Children usually presented with fever and symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection. The initial radiograph is usually normal while early thoracic computer tomography may show poorly defined, ground glass opacifications of the lung in the subpleural areas. 6 The typical laboratory findings are lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and elevation of liver enzymes. The non-specific clinical and laboratory findings are no different from children with pneumonia due to other rival etiologies. 3 SARS is caused by a newly identified coronavirus which is genetically very similar to strains of coronavirus isolated in wild animals sold in the markets in the Guangdong province of China. 7 The most reliable rapid early diagnosis is by reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction to detect the virus in respiratory secretions.",

The majority of human cases were confirmed to have contact or consumption of diseased birds.

Postmortum examination revealed diffuse alveolar inflammation with interstitial lympo-plasmacytic infiltration and scattered histiocytes showing reactive hemophagocytic activity. Similar reactive hemophagocytic activity was also noted in the bone marrow and the spleen but the precise mechanisms resulting in the cytokine driven hemophagocytic syndrome remain to be explored. 18 The optimal treatment for human H5N1 infections is still unclear. Because of the severity of this infection, patients suspected or proven to have H5N1 influenza should be hospitalized in facilities with strict isolation. They should be started on neuraminidase inhibitor while waiting for confirmatory testing. 4 The exact dosage and duration of treatment are not known.",

The control of avian flu will be a lot more difficult, if not impossible, as the natural reservoirs are many species of birds and domestic poultry. To complicate the issue, many species of birds can carry the virus without any apparent signs of illness. If mutation of the virus occurs resulting in efficient human to human transmission, a pandemic resulting in significant global mortality is highly likely. There is an urgent need for effective monitoring of outbreak and carriage of avian flu in wild birds and domestic poultry.
