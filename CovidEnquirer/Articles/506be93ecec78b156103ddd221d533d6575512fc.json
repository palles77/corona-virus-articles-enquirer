These studies have found that government behavior (sometimes captured by the term \"governance\"), as measured by indicators such as accountability, stability, rule of law, respect for human rights, and the existence of an independent civil society, plays a signifi cant role in health outcomes -a role independent of, and perhaps even superior to, host genetics, insect vectors, or individual behaviors. Famines stem not solely from bad weather or genetics, but also from the failure of governments to protect their populations from civil strife, or to equitably distribute food aid. Occupational illnesses, such as pneumoconiosis (or \"black lung\"), can be understood in terms of the risk behaviors and biological susceptibility of mineworkers, but also as a failure of governments to protect individuals in the workplace.",

As the chapters in this volume illustrate, there is an increasing appreciation that factors outside what is traditionally considered the health sphere can contribute to creating or controlling endemic and epidemic infectious disease. Some of these causes are socio-cultural, while others are the result of migrating populations, transportation Governance, human rights and infectious disease: theoretical, empirical and practical perspectives infrastructure, and the workforce. There is increasing evidence, from diverse infectious diseases and using diverse research approaches, that suggests that government behavior has an infl uence on infectious disease spread and control as well.",

We note that this obligation extends not only to the provision of health care or to the control of infectious disease outbreaks, but also to the cessation of human rights violations that contribute to poor health or disease risk. We then review recent attempts to quantify the relationship between good (or bad) governance and public health, noting that such quantifi cation is often limited by confounding factors and methodological limitations. By reference to three infectious diseases -HIV and AIDS, Guinea Worm, and SARSwe explore some of the causal mechanisms by which human rights abuses might fuel disease spread and/or constrain the ability of governments to arrest disease. We conclude by refl ecting on the importance of developing a coherent framework for understanding the precise relationship between governance, human rights, and infectious disease.",

In the absence of a clear scientifi c understanding of infectious diseases, these efforts were largely linked to religious beliefs. City states in ancient Greece created sanitation systems for the entire community, and medical care for the poor. By the thirteenth century, Italian cities had laws modeled after ancient Roman standards to prevent epidemic disease through maintaining clean water supplies, controlling refuse disposal, and monitoring migrants to the city that might be carrying infectious disease (Kiple, 1995) . The Elizabethan Poor Laws in Britain in the early seventeenth century strengthened the responsibility of local authorities for health and welfare. The Public Health Act of 1848, passed to improve sanitation in England and Wales, was one of the great milestones in public health history (Fee and Brown, 2005) . By the twentieth century, the authority of local, state, and national governments was extended from sanitation and indigent medical care to activities such as chlorinating and fl uoridating community water supplies, conducting insect vector control, screening and inoculating against infectious diseases, partner notifi cation and tracking of sexually transmitted diseases, and regulating food, drugs, and the blood supply. Each of these actions acknowledged the widening responsibility of government to maintain and promote public health, especially in the area of infectious disease control.",

Under this provision, governments are obligated to respect, protect, and fulfi ll the \"right to health\" by taking positive actions that ensure access to high-quality health services, and by refraining from or preventing negative actions that interfere with health, such as denying health care to certain populations or censoring health-related information. The right to the highest attainable standard of health is also intimately linked to the enjoyment of a full range of civil and political rights, such as the right to information, equality, and due process under law. So, for example, a government ban on the reporting of a newly identifi ed infectious disease may violate the right to information under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966) and also infringe upon the right to health by preventing individuals from protecting themselves from illness. Violence, discrimination, and arbitrary actions by the state also can have both direct and indirect public health impacts -for example, when police offi cers arbitrarily detain outreach workers providing life-saving HIV-prevention services, this implicates not only due process rights but also the health of those who benefi t from these services (Human Rights Watch, 2006a) .",

Areas of public health, such as health promotion, that traditionally emphasized individual lifestyle choices and personal responsibility are now being reframed to recognize broader infl uences on individual behaviors and broader responsibility of government for promoting healthy social environments. A milestone of this shift was the 1986 World Health Organization's Ottawa Charter, which set out fi ve key areas of action for infl uencing healthy behaviors: building healthy public policy, creating supportive environments, strengthening community action, developing personal skills, and reorienting health services (WHO, 1986; Breslow, 1999) . Critics of \"black box\" epidemiology, who advocated for more contextualized and structural analyses to be incorporated into epidemiological studies, mirrored this movement Susser, 1996a, 1996b) . The fi eld of social epidemiology, which looks at social factors that shape disease vulnerability, also recognizes the important role of political context and human rights violations in fueling infectious disease spread.",

To measure governance, two approaches have been used. Some authors have chosen the rankings of the organization Freedom House, which scores countries based upon political rights and civil liberties, electoral process, political pluralism and participation, functioning of government (including transparency and corruption), freedom of expression and belief; association; organizational rights, rule of law and personal autonomy; and individual rights (Freedom House, 2006) .

In addition, governance infl uences different infectious disease risks in different ways, and presents distinct challenges to governments -compelling different types of government policies and approaches.

The study found a signifi cant negative correlation between HIV prevalence and all six governance dimensions (r ranged from 0.12 to 0.20, and P ranged from 0.03 to 0.001). The study, though statisti- (2006) re-analyzed the data using a single composite indicator from the six governance dimensions provided by the World Bank. The authors found a similar result (r \u03ed 0.2, P \u03fd 0.05), and concluded that analyzing structural measures such as governance versus single diseases was bound to show a weaker correlation than broader measures unless the diseases were ubiquitous. However, the authors say little about the limitations inherent in comparing across countries an infectious disease such as HIV that is manifested in different communities (because of different frequencies of dominant risk behaviors) and was introduced at different times into different communities and countries. As HIV is still a relatively newly introduced infection in many countries, measurements assessing current HIV prevalence versus governance may as yet be inappropriate. The dynamics of the global HIV epidemic are still fl uid and, particularly in Eastern Europe and Asia, future prevalence is uncertain, making an analysis using current prevalence an uneven comparison.",

In the second example, HIV/AIDS, we will discuss how a disease of socially marginalized populations (for example, injection drug users and, in sub Saharan Africa, women) was both initially ignored and subsequently poorly controlled by governments with poor records on human rights and governance. In the third example, we will discuss how the lack of political freedoms in China led to poor recognition and handling of a newly identifi ed infectious disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).",

Throughout the history of the HIV epidemic, governments have variously attempted to criminalize HIV transmission, quarantine people living with HIV, and censor factual information about safer sex and drug use. Political leaders have pandered to the stigma surrounding HIV by denying the extent of epidemics in their countries, and, in some cases, suggesting that AIDS is a punishment for perverse and sinful behavior.

By contrast, the \"war on drugs\" was a harsh \"zero tolerance\" policy that fl ew in the face of proven HIV prevention strategies, such as provision of sterile syringes or oral methadone to people who inject drugs. Purportedly in response to a rise in methamphetamine use in the country, in January 2003 the then Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra called for \"ruthless\" drug enforcement based on \"an eye for an eye\" (Human Rights Watch, 2004). There followed a period of mass arrest and incarceration of drug users for even low-level crimes such as possession of narcotics and syringes for personal use. Thaksin instructed local offi cials to create \"blacklists\" of suspected drug offenders, and in August 2003 instituted a shoot-to-kill policy against alleged drug traffi ckers smuggling methamphetamines from neighboring Burma. By the end of the \"fi rst phase\" of the drug war, an estimated 2275 people had been shot dead in apparent extrajudicial executions (CNN, 2003; AFP, 2003) . Thaksin blamed these killings on internecine violence among drug traders, yet at this writing a full investigation of the killings still has not taken place, despite some indication that investigations might occur in the wake of Thaksin's having been overthrown in late 2006. Throughout the drug war, senior government offi cials encouraged violence against drug suspects. At one point Thaksin said: \"There is nothing under the sun which the Thai police cannot do \u2026 If there are deaths among traders, it's normal\" (Human Rights Watch, 2004) .",

Many drug users were incarcerated in prisons where syringe-sharing was common and access to HIV prevention information and services was minimal to non-existent. Instead of seeking drug treatment and HIV prevention services, many drug users escaped into hiding (Human Rights Watch, 2004) . One study revealed that 37 percent of drug users who had formerly attended drug treatment centers in Chiang Mai were staying away, and that there was an increase in sharing syringes because sterile syringes were more diffi cult to obtain (Bhatiasevi, 2003) .

Seventy-fi ve percent of all land is considered \"Crown land,\" which is governed by highly patriarchal and gender-biased customary law (Scholz and Gomez, 2004 ) that prevents women from owning, inheriting, or disposing of property. A Swazi woman enjoys the right to use her father's property, but is expected to marry and depend on the property of her husband. Married women are treated as the legal equivalent of minors, unable to sign contracts or represent themselves in court. If a woman is widowed or separated from her husband, her property typically reverts to (or is grabbed by) her husband's family. Because of these conditions, it is perilous for Swazi women to leave even violent marriages, to refuse sex, to object to polygyny, or to insist on condom use. This helps to explain why in Swaziland, as in numerous African countries, a signifi cant percentage of HIV infections among women occur in marriage. Married women may be unable to seek health care or information because of a lack or resources or dependence on their husband or male relatives. They are also less likely than men to have attended school, where they might have gained access to information about HIV prevention or the skills to become economically independent.",

Certainly it is true that, despite the best (or worst) intentions of individuals and governments, infectious pathogens can be stubbornly indifferent or even contrary to theories of health and human rights. HIV transmission can be limited in civil war settings, for example, even when human rights abuses are widespread and governments have collapsed. In Angola, a protracted civil war which reduced cross-border travel and trade is thought to have left the country somewhat protected from the early introduction and spread of disease compared to many of its neighbors; however, the war also impeded the ability of the government to conduct surveillance and education around the disease, and destroyed the health services needed to respond to AIDS. The war also curtailed the formation of a vibrant civil society, such as the development of NGOs and AIDS service organizations, which have been highly effective in both prevention and care elsewhere.",

In Mozambique, for example, the HIV rate soared shortly after the cessation of civil confl ict in 1992. Another example of the diffi culty with the temporal relationship between governance and HIV prevalence comes from the Kingdom of Swaziland, referred to above. The rapid rise in HIV prevalence, from 4 percent in 1992 to 26 percent in 1996, did not occur with a simultaneous deterioration of governance; rather, the precondition and weaknesses in Swaziland allowed for the rapid spread of HIV once it was fully introduced into the country. Conversely, the apparent improvement in the HIV epidemic in Zimbabwe, with HIV prevalence decreasing from 25 percent to 20 percent between 2001 and 2005 despite a worsening human rights and governance environment, may be refl ective of earlier actions by the government and, importantly, by international donors, while the impact of current government actions will only be refl ected in the years to come (Human Rights Watch, 2006a) . Vaccine-preventable diseases may similarly refl ect a time-lag between the breakdown of governance (and hence vaccination campaigns) and the accumulation of a large enough susceptible cohort of individuals to sustain disease transmission.",

We have argued that government conduct plays an important role in shaping the social context in which individuals live, behave, and make decisions about their health.

There are several ways in which the relationship between governance, human rights, and infectious disease may be understood. The degree to which governments are respectful of human rights, and are responsive and accountable to their citizens, will infl uence the effectiveness with which they respond to disease threats and openly communicate about epidemics. This applies to both epidemic diseases, which governments may conceal in an attempt to maintain social order, as well as to endemic diseases among the poor, which governments may ignore out of political expediency. Individual violations of civil and political rights by governments or non-state actors can constrain the ability of individuals -especially socially marginalized groups -to make informed decisions about their health, thus increasing their vulnerability to infectious disease. These human rights violations may have less to do with health policy per se, and more to do with government actions (and inactions) lying outside the health sphere. A government's commitment to human rights will determine the level of coerciveness with which it responds to infectious disease threats and, in turn, how effectively a disease is contained and controlled. Even governments that choose proactively to address infectious diseases may do so in a manner that sacrifi ces individual rights to a perceived social benefi t. A rational and proportionate balancing of individual rights against larger policy objectives may be more likely to reap benefi ts for public health than ignoring or downplaying human rights.",

Despite the range of work in this area, there have been few attempts to describe the actual mechanisms by which rights and democracy can impact health, and attempts to measure these relationships in quantitative terms have been limited and largely unsuccessful. Even more rare have been efforts to design programmatic interventions that would enact political reforms in countries hard-hit by infectious disease, and evaluate the health impact of these reforms. Operational work in the area of health and human rights has largely been confi ned to documentation and advocacy work by non-governmental organizations, and has gained little acceptance by the global health community.",

Human rights law suggests a full range of concrete and justifi able remedies for abuses that fuel infectious disease and impede civil society's response to it (Mann, 1996) . Mechanisms of human rights accountability, such as courts, national human rights institutions, United Nations, and other multilateral procedures, and traditional \"naming and shaming\" techniques by non-governmental organizations have the ability to further human rights goals and thus have an impact on public health. Greater academic research into the precise links between democracy, human rights, and health can further assist policy-makers in implementing rights-based approaches with rigor and integrity. Tools such as the International Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights, the Human Rights Impact Assessment (co-authored by Mann and Gostin) , and extensive human rights documentation and advocacy by non-governmental organizations can further operationalize this approach by providing recommendations and policy guidance to governments (Gostin and Mann, 1994; Human Rights Watch, 2006a ; Offi ce of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, 2006).",
