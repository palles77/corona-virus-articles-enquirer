To evaluate genotypic diversity and identify forces shaping picornavirus evolution, we screened persons with respiratory illnesses by using rhinovirus-specifi c or generic real-time PCR assays. We then sequenced the 5\u2032 untranslated region, capsid protein VP1, and protease precursor 3CD regions of virus-positive samples. Subsequent phylogenetic analysis identifi ed the large genotypic diversity of rhinoviruses circulating in humans. We identifi ed and completed the genome sequence of a new enterovirus genotype associated with respiratory symptoms and acute otitis media, confi rming the close relationship between rhinoviruses and enteroviruses and the need to detect both viruses in respiratory specimens. Finally, we identifi ed recombinants among circulating rhinoviruses and mapped their recombination sites, thereby demonstrating that rhinoviruses can recombine in their natural host. This study clarifi es the diversity and explains the reasons for evolution of these viruses.",

These 2 picornaviruses share an identical genomic organization, have similar functional RNA secondary structures, and are classifi ed within the same genus (www.ictvonline.org/virusTax-onomy.asp) because of their high sequence homology (1) . However, despite their common genomic features, these 2 groups of viruses have different phenotypic characteristics. In vivo, rhinoviruses are restricted to the respiratory tract, whereas enteroviruses infect primarily the gastrointestinal tract and can spread to other sites such as the central nervous system. However, some enteroviruses exhibit specifi c respiratory tropism and thus have properties similar to rhinoviruses (2) (3) (4) (5) . In vitro, most HRVs and HEVs differ by their optimal growth temperature, acid tolerance, receptor usage, and cell tropism. The genomic basis for these phenotypic differences between similar viruses is not yet fully understood.",

The alignment was sliced into windows of constant size and fi xed overlap and a 100replicate maximum-likelihood (using HRV-93 as an outgroup) was computed for each window. From each tree, the distance between the candidate recombinant and all other sequences was extracted. This extraction yielded a matrix of distances for each window and for each alignment position. A threshold was defi ned as the lowest distance plus a fraction (15%) of the difference between the highest and lowest distances. The nearest neighbors of the candidate recombinant were defi ned as sequences at a distance smaller than this threshold. This distance ensured that the nearest neighbor, as well as any close relative, was always included. Possible recombination breakpoints thus corresponded to changes of nearest neighbors. Serotypes included in this analysis represented serotypes close to CL-013775 and CL-073908 on the basis of 5\u2032-UTR and VP1 phlyogenetic trees (online Technical Appendix 2 Figure 1 , panels A, B, available from www.cdc.gov/EID/ content/15/5/719-Techapp2.pdf), as well as serotypes close to CL-135587 on the basis of VP1 and 3CD phlyogenetic trees (online Technical Appendix 2 Figure 1 , panels B, C) and whose full-length sequence was available.",

VP1 nucleotide homology among these strains was 94%-98%, except for 1 distantly related sample (74%-76%), which may represent an additional genotype. Additional sequencing is ongoing to verify this assumption. At the 5\u2032-UTR level, the strain described by Lee et al.

Thus, the 5\u2032-UTR-based phylogeny was inconsistent with that based on VP1 sequences and suggested possible recombination events (Figure 1, panels A, B) .

Accordingly, VP1 sequences enabled genotyping of all but 3 clinical strains analyzed (online Technical Appendix 2, Figure 1 , panel B). These strains may represent rhinovirus genotypes only distantly related to predefi ned reference serotypes. In contrast, genotyping based on 3CD and 5\u2032-UTR was less accurate, as expected.

Two of these isolates (CL-013775 and CL-073908) were typed as HRV-67 on the basis of VP1 sequence and were closest to this serotype in 3CD, whereas the 5\u2032-UTR cosegregated with HRV-36 (see 5\u2032-UTR recombinant; online Technical Appendix 2 Figure 1 , panels A-C). These viruses were isolated by cell culture from 2 epidemiologically linked cases and thus represented transmission of the same virus. To confi rm the recombination, we completed the sequencing by obtaining the 5\u2032-UTR, VP4, and VP2 sequences (EU840918 and EU840930) and compared them with HRV-36, HRV-67, and other closely related serotypes. Bootscanning analysis ( Figure 3 , panel A) enabled mapping of the recombination site within the 5\u2032-UTR, just before the polyprotein start codon. Sequence alignment mapped recombination breakpoints more precisely between positions 524 and 553 with reference to HRV-2 (X02316). The other incongruent isolate (CL-135587) was typed as HRV-76 on the basis of VP1 sequence and was closest to this serotype in the 5\u2032-UTR, but 3CD cosegregates with HRV-56 (3C recombinant; online Technical Appendix 2 Figure 1, panels B, C) . Similarly, we completed the fulllength sequence of this isolate (EU840726) and HRV-56 (EU840727). The same approach enabled mapping of the recombination site at the N terminus of protein 3C between positions 1511 and 1523 with reference to HRV-2 ( Figure 3, panel B) . These results demonstrate that recombination occurs among clinical rhinoviruses. In our analysis of 40 rhinovirus-positive samples collected over 9 years (3 additional samples were duplicates of 2 different viruses; online Technical Appendix 1 Table 2) for 3 genomic regions, 2 of the analyzed viruses appeared to be recombinants. The 2 documented recombinations occurred in members of the HRV-A species. The design of this study and technical issues (e.g., inability to sequence low viral loads) limited the ability to calculate a recombination rate, particularly for HRV-B and HRV-C.",

The large number of circulating genotypes supports the view that rhinoviruses do not circulate by waves or outbreaks of a given dominant genotype, which might explain the high frequency of reinfection during short periods. As expected, the observed variability is higher for surface capsid proteins, the targets of most immune pressure, and this region remains the only accurate one for genotyping and defi ning phylogeny. Technical constraints such as the limited amount of clinical specimens, the use of different screening methods, and the need to sequence an unknown target of extreme variability might have limited the representativeness of our sequence collection.

These viruses show no evidence of recombination with other HEV-C strains and, similar to EV-104, do not grow in cell culture (29) . On the basis of our epidemiologic data, we conclude that EV-104 was found in 8 children from different regions of Switzerland who had respiratory illnesses such as acute otitis media or pneumonia. Future studies using adapted detection tools will provide more information on the range of this virus. On the basis of its genomic features and similarities with coxsackieviruses and poliovirus, EV-104 could theoreti- cally infect the central nervous system (2, 38) . Detection of new subtypes of picornaviruses indicates that viruses with new phenotypic traits could emerge, and conclusions on tropism of new strains should be substantiated by extensive experimental or clinical investigations (39) . By completing the sequence of a seemingly divergent rhinovirus (13), we assigned this virus to the new HRV-C species, thus limiting currently to 3 the number of HRV species. For the sake of simplicity, we propose to consider this virus as a member of the HRV-C clade.",

Known to be a driving force of enterovirus evolution, rhinovirus recombination among clinical strains has never been observed. Two clinical isolates of 40 viruses analyzed resulted from recombination events and their breakpoints were identifi ed within the 5\u2032-UTR sequence and the N terminus of protein 3C, respectively. These fi ndings are consistent with the fact that recombination breakpoints in picornaviruses are restricted to nonstructural regions of the genome or between the 5\u2032-UTR and the capsid-encoding region (40) . Our observations provide new insight on the diversity and ability of rhinovirus to evolve in its natural host. The fact that only 2 of 40 analyzed viruses over a 9-year period were recombinants is suggestive of a lower recombination frequency in rhinoviruses than in other picornaviruses (32, 40) and might be related, but not exclusively, to the short duration of rhinovirus infection (18, 31, 32) . Recombination events occurred between HRV-A genotypes, but whether they can occur in species B and C remains unknown. Interspecies recombination is rare in picornaviruses and is mainly the result of in vitro experiments. For rhinoviruses, the different location of cre elements in each species might be an additional limiting constraint (17) .",
