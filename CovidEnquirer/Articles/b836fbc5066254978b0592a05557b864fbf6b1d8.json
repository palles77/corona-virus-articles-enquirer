            "text": "The search for new antiviral agents is one of the most important tasks of chemistry and medicine because of wide spread of socially dangerous viral infections such as HIV, hepatitis B and C, and the emergence of new viral infections ('avian flu' and 'swine flu', influenza A/H1N1, Ebola fever etc.). 1, 2 The pandemic of influenza A/ H1N1 (Spanish flu) in 1918-1919 claimed 40 million lives, Asian influenza virus A/H2N2 in 1957 has led to death of 4 million persons, and 2 million persons have been died in Hong Kong in 1968 by the pandemic influenza A (H3N2). [3] [4] [5] The appearance of novel strain of influenza A in April 2009 ('swine flu') caused 162,380 cases and 1154 deaths in 168 countries, 6,7 and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the pandemic influenza caused by a new strain of H1N1, which was identified as influenza virus formed as a result of a triple reassortment of swine, avian and human viruses and called influenza A/H1N1pdm09. [8] [9] [10] Currently, two classes of antiviral drugs of adamantane structure-Amantadine and Rimantadine, and the neuraminidase inhibitors-Zanamivir/Relenza (GlaxoWellcome/Biota) and Oseltamivir/Tamiflu (Hoffman-La-Roche/Gilead) are used in medicine for the treatment of influenza, but both groups of compounds have drawbacks and are characterized by a viral resistance appearance. 11, 12 Numerous chemical compounds, which did not reach clinical trials belong to the different chemical classes exhibiting different levels of anti-influenza activity in vitro and in vivo, and are directed at different targets in the viral life cycle. [13] [14] [15] [16] At present an any research studies targeting the search of new antivirals against influenza A virus are of high priority in drug development, and are oriented to the search of new compounds or modification of already known compounds-leaders with the proved antiviral activity. 17, 18 One of the modern and innovative approaches in the search of new antivirals is an application of available natural compounds or plant metabolites with a new mechanism of antiviral activity. Natural compounds and their derivatives are promising new candidates for the treatment of viral, bacterial and fungal infections. 19, 20 Glycyrrhizic acid (GL) (1), a major triterpene glycoside isolated from Glycyrrhiza glabra L. (licorice) and Gl. uralensis Fisher roots, is the leading natural glycoside and promising scaffold for creation of new antiviral agents. [21] [22] [23] To date GL is a principal plant derived metabolite suitable for the long-term treatment of HIV infection as it does not lead to emergence of drug resistance. 24, 25 Preparation SNMC (Stronger neo-Minophagen Co.) containing GL was used for a long term chemotherapy of viral hepatitis B and C. 26 GL is attractive due its ability to stimulate c-interferon production in vitro and in vivo, and low toxicity (LD 50 5000 mg/kg). But GL is active as an antiviral agent in vivo in high doses and causes some side effects connecting with its structural similarity to corticosteroids, it may influence on a water-salt interchange, intensify of Na + -content retention and reduce K + -content in some patients. 27 We reported previously that biological activity of GL could be improved by its chemical modifications and some semisynthetic GL derivatives were found as potent immune modulators and anti-viral agents. 28 SARS-associated coronavirus, 29 Epstein-Barr virus, 30 and anti-HIV agents 31,32 were found. Structure-activity relationships study of GL derivatives as influenza A/H1N1 virus inhibitors was not carried out still. This Letter is devoted to the synthesis and anti-viral activity evaluation of some GL derivatives and analogs against influenza A/H1N1/pdm09 virus in vitro.",

Experimental details are given in the References and notes. 33 GL conjugates (2) (3) (4) were synthesized by condensation of glycoside 1 with L-amino acids methyl esters at room temperature (22-25\u00b0C) (rt) by using N-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) and 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (DEC) in the molar ratio 1/3.5/3.5/3.5. 34 Yields of target compounds were 90-92%. Analytical and spectral data of compounds 2-4 were similar to those received previously by using HOBt-N,N 0 -dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC). 35 GL conjugates (5-9) with free 30-COOH were prepared by the activated esters method by using N-hydroxysucinimide (HOSu)-DCC and 2.0-2.5 molar ratio of reagents and at 0-5\u00b0C as was reported previously. 31, 36 Target compounds were isolated by column chromatography (CC) on silica gel (SL) with 55-60% yields. Structures of new compounds 5-7 were confirmed by IR and NMR 13 C data. There are signals of free 30-COOH at 180.3-180.8 ppm as in the 13 C NMR GA. 37 Analytical and spectral data for new compounds 5-7 are given in the References and notes. 38 Analytical and spectral data for compounds 8 and 9 were similar to those synthesized before. 23, 31 Compounds (11) and (13) containing free amino acids have been synthesized previously by using HOSu-DCC and S-benzyl(Bn)-cysteine-or N e -carbobenzoxy(Z)lysine tert-butyl esters hydrochlorides. 39, 40 tert-Butyl ester groups of protected conjugates 10 and 12 were deleted with 50% CF 3 COOH in DCM and pure compounds 11 and 13 were isolated by CC on SL. GL conjugate with D-galactose amine (14) connected to the carbohydrate part of glycoside by CONH-bonds was synthesized as described before. 41 Stereo isomeric 18a-GL (15) was produced by the alkaline isomerization of GL according to method. 42 Its derivatives (16, 17) to be conjugates with methyl esters of L-aspartic acid were described previously. 23 GL analog (18) was prepared by reduction of GL trimethyl ester with NaBH 4 according to method. 43 Glycoside (19) with reduced C 11 @O group was synthesized by reduction of GA with NaBH 4 in 2-PrOH as described before. 44 GL 1 and its derivatives and analogs 2-19 were evaluated for their inhibitory activity against pandemic influenza A/H1N1/ pdm09 virus in the MDCK cells. 45 Cytotoxicity of compounds was evaluated in MDCK cells by a cell viability assay. 46 Number of viable cells was evaluated by a microtetrazolium test (MTT) 47 and CTD 50 (compound concentration required to reduce 50% cell viability) value was estimated for each compound.",

NMR spectra were recorded in CD 3 OD with TMS internal standard on a Bruker AMX-300 spectrometer at operating frequency 300 ( 1 H) and 75.5 ( 13 C) MHz. Optical activity was measured in a 1-dm tube on a Perkin-Elmer 341 MC polarimeter. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on silica gel shits (Sorbfil plates, Sorbpolimer) using CHCl 3 -MeOH-H 2 O mixture (45:10:1, v %). Spots were detected by H 2 SO 4 solution (5%) in EtOH with subsequent heating at 110-120\u00b0C for 2-3 min. Column chromatography was carried out over silica gel KSK SG (50-150 fraction, dry classification) (Sorbpolimer) by using a gradient mixture CHCl 3 -MeOH-H 2 O (400:10:1 ? 50:10:1, v %). The HPLC analysis were performed on a DuPont chromatograph with an absorbance detector at 254 nm over a Jupiter 5 l C18 reversed-phase column with mobile phase (MP) MeOH-H 2 O-AcOH (60:35:5, v %) for GA and over a Chromsil CN column with MP phosphate buffer",
