            "text": "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) belongs to the family Togaviridae and the genus Alphavirus [1] . It contains a single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 11.8 kb and comprises three different strains: the East, Central and South African strain, West African strain and Asian strain [2] . Dengue virus (DENV) is a member of the family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus with a single-stranded RNA genome of 11 kb which has been categorized into four serotypes, DENV1-4 [3] . Both viruses are arthropodborne viruses (arboviruses). Major mosquitoes vectors for the viruses are of the Aedes genus, including Aedes egypti and Aedes albopictus. Worldwide an estimated 50 million are infected with DENV per year, culminating in about 25 000 deaths in severe cases [4] . The magnitude of problems caused by the spreading of CHIKV can be seen in the unprecedented spread of CHIKV on islands of the Indian Ocean in 2005 [5] and the largest recorded outbreak with more than 1.38 million cases in [2006] [2007] [6, 7] . Recent endemic areas are mainly urban areas in South, East and West Africa, the south-western Indian Ocean islands, India and Asia including Thailand. The report showed that the recent CHIKV outbreak started spreading in Thailand in 2008 [8, 9] , and are of the ECSA strain confirmed by complete genome analysis [10, 11] . CHIKV causes chikungunya fever (CHIKF) in both male and female individuals of any age. CHIKF is self-limiting with a very low death rate and usually presents as a rapid onset of fever, a characteristic rash, severe and incapacitating joint pain and other less common symptoms such as headache, fatigue, nausea, vomiting and conjunctivitis [12] . The clinical characteristics of dengue vary from asymptomatic to potentially fatal complications. Dengue fever (DF) may present as headache, fever, bone or joint pain while dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) may produce bleeding, plasma leakage, fever, and thrombocytopenia which can affect any age. A plasma leakage test is crucial as DHF usually presents plasma leakage while DF does not. DHF may lead to dengue shock syndrome and must be monitored Objective: To develop diagnostic test for detection chikungunya virus (CHIKV and Dengue virus (DENV) infection. Methods: We have performed a rapid, accurate laboratory confirmative method to simultaneously detect, quantify and differentiate CHIKV and DENV infection by single-step multiplex real-time RT-PCR. Results: The assay's sensitivity was 97.65%, specificity was 92.59% and accuracy was 95.82% when compared to conventional RT-PCR. Additionally, there was no cross-reaction between CHIKV, DENV, Japanese encephalitis virus, hepatitis C, hepatitis A or hepatitis E virus. Conclusions: This rapid and reliable assay provides a means for simultaneous early diagnosis of CHIKV and DENV in a single-step reaction. closely [13] .",

A dengue-like epidemic on the Comoros Islands in 2005 was additionally a CHIKV outbreak [14, 15] . Furthermore, the two viruses not only show similar symptoms to each other but also to other fever such as measles, influenza infection and severe acute respiratory syndrome [16] . The 2004 CHIKV epidemic in Kenya was originally thought to be malaria [17] . Additionally, there have been several reports of co-circulation and co-infection of CHIKV and DENV in Delhi, Malaysia, the Maldives and India along with the increasing number of travelers and the spread of the vectors, Aedes egypti and Aedes albopictus, for both viruses [18] [19] [20] .",

Conventional RT-PCR has been traditionally used as the gold standard, but from our results real-time RT-PCR yields higher sensitivity than this method. Applying this assay, we were able to detect viral DNA at titers too low for amplification by normal RT-PCR (n=12). Additionally, realtime RT-PCR also has an advantage over conventional RT-PCR in terms of expediency. There are no post-amplification processes such as gel electrophoresis, gel visualization and sometimes confirmation by direct sequencing. Compared to semi-nested RT-PCR for DENV amplification, a two-step procedure, real-time RT-PCR requires less time to arrive at a diagnosis. By using multicolor probes, we were able to design oligonucleotide sequences of specific probes labeled with different colors [30] . Primers and probes were designed so that they could be used under similar amplification conditions but provide immediate viral identity feedback. Additionally, regional mutations were taken into account during the design process. During the largest outbreak of CHIKV on islands in the Indian Ocean, a signature mutation, E1-A226V, was found in the E1 region. Hence, we designed a set of primers and probe that do not target on this spot so that we are able to detect CHIKV regardless of E1-226 wildtype or mutant. For DENV detection, our method is able to detect all four serotypes of DENV. Although detecting serotypes of DENV may be advantageous, the clinical treatments for all serotypes are identical and it may not be effective to use different probes to detect different serotypes. Evaluation of detection at minimum concentration revealed that this method can detect concentrations as low as 10 copies/ \u6bfa L. When testing the specificity of our assay, we found no cross reactivity between CHIKV, DENV, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis A virus, hepatitis E virus and JEV. Dual infection of CHIKV and DENV confirmed by conventional RT-PCR produced identical results with multiplex realtime RT-PCR, suggesting that this method remains useful for detecting two viruses in a single step reaction.",
