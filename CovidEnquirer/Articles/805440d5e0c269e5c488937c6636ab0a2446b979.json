The current inability to replicate EEDV in vitro necessitates the search for a reproducible, sensitive, and specific assay that allows for its detection and quantitation in a time-and cost-effective manner. Herein, we describe a loopmediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay that was developed for the quantitative detection of EEDV in infected fish tissues. The newly developed LAMP reaction was optimized in the presence of calcein, and the best results were produced using 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1.8 mM dNTPs and at an incubation temperature of 67.1\u00b0C. This method was highly specific to EEDV, as it showed no cross-reactivity with several fish viruses, including Salmonid Herpesvirus -1 , -2, -4, and -5, Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis Virus, Spring Viremia of Carp Virus, Infectious Hematopoietic Necrosis Virus, Golden Shiner Reovirus, Fathead Minnow Nidovirus, and Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus. The analytical sensitivity of the EEDV-LAMP method was estimated to be as low as 16 copies of plasmid per reaction. When infected fish tissue was used, a positive reaction could be obtained when an infected gill tissue sample that contained 430 viral copies/\u03bcg was diluted up to five orders of magnitude. The sensitivity and specificity of the newly developed LAMP assay compared to the SYBR Green qPCR assay were 84.3% and 93.3%, respectively. The quantitative LAMP for EEDV had a correlation coefficient (R 2 = 0.980), and did not differ significantly from the SYBR Green quantitative PCR assay (p > 0.05). Given its cost-and time-effectiveness, this quantitative LAMP assay is suitable for screening lake trout populations and for the initial diagnosis of clinical cases.",

Within the Alloherpesviridae family is the genus Salmonivirus, which currently contains five viruses: Salmonid Herpesvirus-1 (Herpesvirus the early 1980s, EEDV led to the demise of over 15 million hatcheryreared juvenile lake trout (Bradley et al., 1988 (Bradley et al., , 1989 McAllister and Herman, 1989) . Following 30 years of minimal mortalities associated with EEDV, EEDV outbreaks recurred in Wisconsin and Michigan hatcheries, resulting in morbidity and mortality in hundreds of thousands of lake trout in 2012 and 2017 (Kurobe et al., 2009; Shavalier, 2017) . In the absence of effective control measures to combat this virus, the implementation of stringent biosecurity measures and use of avoidance strategies remain the only tools available to prevent EEDV spread. As a result, the development of a sensitive and specific initial diagnostic tool that is rapid and reasonably inexpensive is deemed necessary to perform screening of wild gamete donor fish as well as periodic testing of hatchery-reared fish throughout their growth.",

After uncovering of the molecular characterization of Salmonid Herpesvirus-4 and -5, it was determined that the current EEDV qPCR assay was unable to distinguish between Salmonid Herpesvirus-3, -4, and -5, as the viruses share high sequence similarity in the terminase gene. This led Glenney et al. (2016b) to design three primer sets based on the glycoprotein gene. Using these primer sets in a SYBR Green qPCR assay, the authors were able to amplify each virus individually. Herein, we report on the development of an EEDV-specific loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for the detection and quantification of EEDV in infected lake trout tissues that is comparable in specificity and sensitivity to the SYBR Green qPCR.",

The 212 bp PCR product was amplified by using the primer set of F3-III and B3-III and cloned into the plasmid vector following the manufacturer's instructions. Copy number of pCR\u00ae2.1-EEDV was calculated using the molecular mass of the vector and amplicon as described in http://cels.uri.edu/gsc/cndna.html. A 10fold serial dilution of plasmid pCR\u00ae2.1-EEDV (1.6 \u00d7 10 7 -10 1 copies/ reaction) was used as the template for the LAMP under the predetermined conditions. The other template was gill tissue DNA extracted from infected lake trout and serially diluted (7.8 \u00d7 10 6 -7.8 \u00d7 10\u00b0pg/ reaction). The limit of detection (LOD) of EEDV-LAMP for infected tissue DNA was calculated based on comparisons with the viral DNA copy numbers obtained by the qPCR assay from plasmid and tissue sample serial dilutions.",

All samples came from negative control (numbers 1-20) or an experimentally infected fish group (number 21 through 100) as described in Shavalier (2017) . DNA was extracted from these tissue samples using the kit OMEGA (Bio-tek) as described above, after which the qLAMP was run in parallel with the SYBR Green qPCR assay as described by Glenney et al.

Each reaction contained 10 \u03bcl SYBR Select Master Mix (2x; Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA), 1.0 \u03bcM of forward and reverse primers and 50 nmol total DNA template.

In this study, we developed a LAMP assay for EEDV detection in fish tissue with relatively high specificity and sensitivity, and therefore, represents a time-and cost-effective early diagnostic tool for the detection and quantification of this deadly virus. The optimal reaction temperature was determined to be 67.1\u00b0C which is relatively higher than the optimal LAMP reaction temperatures reported for other viruses, such as 62\u00b0C for the orf virus (family Poxviridae; genus Parapoxvirus) (Li et al., 2013) , 63\u00b0C for human papillomavirus (Saetiew et al., 2011) , and 64\u00b0C for nervous necrosis virus (family Nodaviridae; genus Betanodavirus) (Hwang et al., 2016) . This variation can be explained by the use of different primer sets for different viruses. Actually, the results of the temperature optimization showed that Bst DNA polymerase effectively amplified the nucleic acid templates at a relatively wide temperature range from 62.6 to 69.1\u00b0C, which facilitates the possibility of running this test under field conditions should commercially available kits be developed in the future.

            "text": "When the developed EEDV LAMP assay was compared to the real-time SYBR Green qPCR (Glenney et al., 2016b) , the diagnostic specificity was as high as 93.3%, however the diagnostic sensitivity was only 84.3%. Although the qPCR identified 11 samples as positive that the qLAMP did not, all but two of them were less than 1000 copies and as indicated above, accurate quantification below this level can be difficult. Therefore, in the case of negative EEDV LAMP results in fish undergoing mortality with clinical signs suggestive of EEDV, additional confirmatory tests should be performed. While it took the real time SYBR Green qPCR 70 min to finish 50 cycles of amplification, it took for the EEDV LAMP assay 50 min to finish the same number of cycles, a matter that underscore the relative time-effectiveness to the developed EEDV-LAMP assay compared to the SYBR Green qPCR. Besides, the newly developed EEDV LAMP assay showed repeatability and consistency in detecting of EEDV in authors' laboratory over last four years (Shavalier, 2016) . When the viral loads determined by qLAMP were compared to those of the SYBR Green qPCR, both assays were capable of quantifying viral loads over a wide range (Table 4) . Although there were some discrepancies with identification of individual positive tissues between the two assays, when all samples were examined together, the paired t-test demonstrated no significant difference between the results of the two different assays (p > 0.05). Indeed, the discrepancy was limited to samples with low viral copy numbers. In total, these quantification results lend further support to that this qLAMP assay can serve as an early valuable detection tool both in the laboratory and under field conditions. In addition, calcein is a complexmetric indicator meaning that positive reactions can be visualized by the naked eye, a matter that allows the LAMP reaction to be performed in fish hatcheries under field conditions (Suebsing et al., 2013 (Suebsing et al., , 2015 .
