            "text": "PIV3 is an enveloped, single-stranded negative sense RNA virus within the respirovirus genus of the Paramyxoviridae family, which causes respiratory diseases in many host species (Maidana et al., 2012) . The respirovirus genus includes human parainfluenza virus types 1 and 3 (HPIV1 and HPIV3, respectively), bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (BPIV3) and Sendai virus (Fauquet et al., 2005) . BPIV3 is an important pathogen associated with bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) which is considered the most significant disease associated with feedlot cattle worldwide (Horwood et al., 2008) . Parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3) is one of the most important viral respiratory pathogens for humans and for many animals, but goat infection has been rarely reported. Starting in Aug 2013, goats in the Jiangsu and Anhui provinces of eastern China suffered severe respiratory diseases. In order to identify the causative agent, numerous related pathogens were tested with RT-PCR or PCR. A unique PIV3 strain was detected in most of the clinical nasal swabs or serum samples. The virus was isolated on MDBK cells and characterized by RT-PCR, nucleotide sequence analysis and hemagglutination test. The entire M and F gene coding regions, HN, 5 0 -UTR-N and L gene fragments were amplified using pairs of degenerate primers. Nucleotide, amino acid sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses based on these genes indicated that the goat-derived PIV3 strain was distinct from previously reported BPIV3 genotypes and HPIV3 strains. The novel isolate, named JS2013, might be a potentially new member of the respirovirus genus. Goats were experimentally infected with JS2013 culture. The virus-inoculated goats displayed coughing and nasal discharges that were related to respiratory diseases. Viremia and virus shedding were detected during 4-10 days post-inoculation (dpi). Virus-specific HI antibodies became positive from 14 dpi. This is the first report of the detection of PIV3 from Chinese goat herds and genetic and pathogenetic characterization of the novel goat-derived PIV3.",

Three BPIV3 genotypes, A (BPIV3a), B (BPIV3b) and C (BPIV3c) have been described and BPIV3a and BPIV3c have been found in Chinese cattle (Zhu et al., 2011) . However, reports of PIV3 infection in goat/sheep are limited and the genetic characteristics of the virus have not been determined (Elazhary et al., 1984; Lamontagne et al., 1985; Lyon et al., 1997; Taylor et al., 1975) . Furthermore, nothing is known about the circulation of PIV3 in goats/ sheep in China and the relationship between virus infections and clinical diseases, as well as the relationship of small ruminants' PIV3 with BPIV3 and HPIV3.",

The diseased goats usually showed no obvious body temperature changes. Antibiotic treatment had no apparent effect, although a few diseased animals recovered within 10-15 days.

In feedlot cattle, BRDC is considered the most significant disease, and BPIV3 plays an important role in BRDC development. Viral infection plus stress conditions and other secondary or co-infections result in severe clinical observations (Haanes et al., 1997; Maidana et al., 2012) . However, there are few reports about related goat viral pathogens. Most previous reports regarding PIV3 in goat/sheep were published in the 1970s-1980s and only serological tests were done; thus, related virus genome characteristics and virus isolations had not been identified (Afshar and Terlecki, 1979; Elazhary et al., 1984; Kennedy-Stoskopf et al., 1983; Lamontagne et al., 1985; Lyon et al., 1997; Taylor et al., 1975) . In the present cases, the goats were imported from different places and transport stress might trigger disease development. The diseased goats were treated with different antibiotics and did not show significant changes in clinical signs. The diseased and dead animals showed similar pathological characteristics. In the primary laboratory examination, several potential pathogens were tested. Most of the samples (56%) showed PIV3 positive results, and sequencing results indicated that viruses from different farms shared 100% identity, indicating the contribution of this novel PIV3 to this clinical disease. ORSV and M. ovipneumoniae were also detected from some samples, indicating different co-infection situations in different farms and this might result in the difference of recovery rate between farms; however, ORSV and M. ovipneumoniae were not the major causes of the goat infections. PIV3 was successfully isolated from nasal swabs and was intranasally infected into goats to assess its pathogenicity. From 4 to 10 dpi, viremia and virus shedding could be detected in all virus-inoculated goats; and 3/4 goats displayed coughing, with mild to moderate nasal discharges. Virus-specific HI antibodies were positive from 14 dpi (Table 4 ). These results further confirmed the goat-derived PIV3 strain had pathogenicity in goats. Of course, other potential unknown pathogens might also be present, requiring further studies.",

            "text": "Three BPIV3 genotypes have been described. BPIV3a was relatively older and widespread. BPIV3b and BPIV3c were found in Australia (Horwood et al., 2008) and Chinese cattle (Zhu et al., 2011) , respectively. Blast searches of the 329 bp M region of JS2013 showed the highest identity of only 82% with Japanese BN-CE strain, indicating that JS2013 was distinct from the previously reported BPIV3 strains. Phylogenetic analysis based on this region gave the same result (data not shown). It was hypothesized that JS2013 might represent a potentially new group of PIV3. To confirm this hypothesis, several pairs of degenerate primers were designed to amplify the entire M and F coding region, partial N, HN and L gene fragments. The sequences were used for genetic and phylogenetic analysis. Similarly, the highest nucleotide identities of M, F, N, HN and L genes with reported strains in Genbank were only 76.9-83.5% (Table 3 ). The new PIV3 strain shared slightly higher identity with BPIV3 than HPIV3. As shown in Table 3 , the F and HN genes and proteins possessed relatively lower identities while the L gene and protein had the highest identity with other sequences, suggesting that F and HN were highly varied among different strains. Considering that HN protein was an immunodominant protein of PIV3, HN-based serological methods and vaccine should be developed in the future. Zhu et al. had proposed the use of PIV3 M and HN genes as appropriate targets for genotyping (Zhu et al., 2011) . F gene was also used for other paramyxovirus genotyping. Therefore, M, F, HN and N genes were used for phylogenetic analysis in this study and they showed similar grouping results (Fig. 2) : JS2013 was clearly differed from HPIV3 and other reported BPIV3 genotypes. The results presented here strongly indicate that JS2013 might represent a novel member of PIV3 in the respirovirus genus and the name caprine parainfluenza virus type 3 is proposed (Fig. 2) . Full-length genome sequencing is currently underway for detailed understanding the genomic characteristics of this new virus.",
