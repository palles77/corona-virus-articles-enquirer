Se han excluido de forma expl\u00edcita los aspectos de prevenci\u00f3n de estas y las infecciones importadas por inmigrantes, objeto de otros documentos de la SEIMC. Varios tipos de profesionales (cl\u00ednicos, microbi\u00f3logos y parasit\u00f3logos) han desarrollado este documento de consenso tras evaluar los datos disponibles basados en la evidencia para proponer una serie de datos clave acerca de este aspecto. Inicialmente se revisan los aspectos generales acerca de la evaluaci\u00f3n general del viajero que regresa con una potencial infecci\u00f3n. En un segundo bloque se se\u00f1alan los datos clave (agentes causales, procedimientos diagn\u00f3sticos y medidas terap\u00e9uticas) de los s\u00edndromes infecciosos principales en el viajero que regresa (s\u00edndrome gastrointestinal (diarrea aguda o persistente), s\u00edndrome febril sin foco aparente, lesiones cut\u00e1neas localizadas e infecciones respiratorias).

            "text": "According to the World Tourism Organization, there were around 1,184 million international tourist arrivals in 2015, some 50 million more than in 2014 (an increase of 4.4%). International tourist arrivals for the year 2016 were forecast to increase by 4%, both worldwide and regionally. Regional growth was expected to be highest in Asia and the Pacific (between 4% and 5%) and the Americas (between 4% and 5%), followed by Europe (between 3.5% and 4.5%), and Africa and the Middle East (between 2% and 5%). 1 Familitur data showed that international tourist movements made by Spaniards were 11.8 million in 2014, 1,140,000 of which were to the African continent, 764,000 to America (Central Caribbean and South) and 520,000 to Asia. 2 The most frequently visited tourist destinations include tropical and sub-tropical countries where there is a higher risk of contracting an infectious disease. 3 Travel to economically less developed countries frequently involves exposure to biological agents that cause infections or to infectious diseases transmitted by different routes (digestive, respiratory, mucocutaneous, vector, and so on). One point that should be highlighted from the outset is the possibility that an infection in the international traveler could also be caused by cosmopolitan agents found within our own country, an example of which would be sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), a set of infectious conditions that has been insufficiently studied among travelers. The differential diagnosis therefore should always include diseases that have a restricted geographic distribution as well as those with a global presence. Furthermore, the severity of the clinical pictures presented here varies a good deal, so that a special section has been included on managing the seriously ill patient. Finally, there are certain situations that are physiological (such as pregnancy) or pathological in nature (for example, the immunocompromised patient, whether or not associated with HIV infection) that have special characteristics that warrant further discussion.",

A search of the PubMed database was performed using the following selection criteria: articles published between 1968 and March 2016, in English or Spanish, and limited to humans only. The search terms used were \"travel*\" associated with each of the items explored (e.g. \"fever\", \"diarrhea\", and so on). This search was complemented with a review of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, using \"travel*\" as the key term, and also of the international guidelines dealing with each of the separate aspects evaluated. The search was conducted using PRISMA reporting criteria, 4 and was reviewed by the contributors in the first instance, then by those coordinating the text version. A total of 436 publications were selected, eliminating those that were duplicated or not relevant. The specific set of references selected for each section may be requested from the contributors.",
