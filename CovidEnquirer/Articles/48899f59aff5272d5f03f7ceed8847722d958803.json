While gNO has been shown, in vitro , to be an effe ctive antibacterial agent (at 160 ppm), NOdonor compounds have been shown to inhibit a variety of viruses at varying stages of replication. This research was done in order to determine whether gNO at 80 or 160 ppm possesses an antiviral effect on influenza viruses. Three strains of influenza (A and B) were exposed to gNO for up to 180 min, before and after infection of MDCK cells. In search for possible mechanism of antiviral action, Neuramin idase (NA) inhibition assay of H1N1 that was exposed to gNO was perf ormed. Results show that when virions were exposed to gNO prior to infection a complete inhibition of infectivity was achieved for all three strains. Post infection exposure of influenza with gNO resulted in about 30% inhibition of infectivity. Further testing showed that when eliminating the pH effect by exposing a dried virus to gNO, 90% inhibition was found after 2 h exposure. NA activity, of whole dried H1N1 virus, was found to be inhibite d by gNO (80%). These results suggest that 80 and 160 ppm gNO have a time dependent antiviral effect on influenza strains of viruses during various stages of cellular infection, which are not due to concomitant changes in pH in the surrounding milieu. Viral NA inhibition by gNO was shown and may be responsibl e for this antiviral effect.",

Despite significant reduction of disease burden through vaccination efforts, circulation of seasonal influenza A and B viruses cause excess morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with preexisting pulmonary conditions. It is reported that the seasonal flu is responsib le for over 36,000 deaths and 200,000 hospitalizations at a cost of $10 billion each year in the United States [1, 2] . Two subtypes of influenza A virus H3N2 and H1N1 have circulate d within the human population. Influenza A viruses have a broad host range and thus differ from influenza B that has a limited host range infecting only humans and seals. In these hosts, influenza B viruses can cause significant disease and are a predominant circulating strain of influenza virus in approximat ely one in every 3 cases [3] . Both influenza A and B viruses present with two types of surface proteins -hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) and Matrix protein (M2/BM2), which is a proton-selective ion channel protein integral in the viral envelope. Influenza B viruses harbor some interesting genetic differences from influenza A including some additional encoded proteins and may have different characterist ics of M2 protein. Specifically, BM2 is translate d by a stop/start translation mechanism , which is different from influenza A viruses in which M2 is translate d from a spliced transcrip t [4] .",

Recently, the world experienced a global life-threatenin g phase 6 pandemic caused by a novel swine origin H1N1 virus. During past pandemics, influenza viruses needed more than 6 months to spread allowing sufficient time to develop new vaccines. As experienced, this new H1N1 virus spread worldwid e in less than 6 weeks [5] . Had the virulence been higher, the mortality rate prior to the availability of the vaccine would have been catastrophic. The rapid spread of the viral infection recently experienced is of grave concern as the developmen t window to manufacture an effective vaccine may not be sufficient in order to provide wide-spread global immunization. Thus, viral infection control methods are mainly dependent on antiviral agents.",

Free NO or NO derived from donating compounds have been reported to exhibit antimicrobial activity during in vitro and in vivo animal studies [10] [11] [12] [13] . The literature supports that NO or its derivatives have inhibitory effects on a variety of viral infections [14] . This inhibitory effect was shown to be marked in IFN-mediated inhibition manifested by activated macrophages [15] . It was also shown to be correlated with s-nitrosyl ation of viral proteins such as reductases and proteases [reviewed in 16] . Conversely, it appears that despite the seemingly beneficial role of NO in viral infections, the over production of NO in response to viral insult may lead to detrimental effects in the host, particularly in influenza infections [17] .",

These chambers were surrounded by an airtight Plexiglas \u00d2 jacket to create a thermally isolated environm ent. This jacket enclosed an electrical heater unit controlled by an internal thermost at (Invensys Appliances Control, Carol Stream, Illinois, USA), that provided stable temperatures inside the chamber. Independent lines from each of the two exposure chambers provided samples of the gas mixtures to a NO/NO 2 /O 2 electrochemical analyzer (AeroNOx, Pulmonox Medical Inc, Tofield, AB, Canada) to detect the exact composition of the gases in the mixture. Gases were supplied from pressurized cylinders at a constant pressure of 50 pounds per square inch. These included 10,000 parts per million (ppm) NO diluted in N 2 (Airgas, Chicago, USA), and medical air (Praxair, Mississauga, ON, Canada). These gases were then mixed together at pre-determine d concentr ations using a dilution manifold and a digital mass flow meter (TSI Inc., Shoreview, MN, USA). Gas mixtures of 80 or 160 ppm, were delivered to the exposure chamber at a rate of 10.0 L/min at 70-90% relative humidity at temperat ures of approximately 28-37\u00b0C (appropriate for each experime nt), through two independent humidifiers (MR850, Fisher & Paykel Healthcare, CA, USA).

Shown in Fig. 3 , a 50% inhibition of H1N1 NA was achieved after 30 min of exposure to 160 ppm gNO and 80% inhibition after 60 and 120 min.",

Interestingl y, it was shown that virions suspended in normal saline when exposed to gNO lose their ability to infect MDCK cells. Whereas, when MDCK cells were first infected with influenza A, then exposed to gNO, the virucidal effect of gNO was modest but are similar to reported results of an NO donor on influenza [10] . Despite this modest virucidal effect we have previously reported in a complex viral bacteria model in bovine (Bovine Respiratory Disease) that NO reduces the symptoms of the disease. Thus, there may be other downstream host interactions, up regulated by NO, which may not come into play in an in vitro study.",

They were able to demonstrate that NO released from SNAP inhibits the influenza A virus at an early stage of viral replication which correlated with viral RNA synthesis. Studies, using Coxsackie virus, have demonstrated that NO interrupted the viral life cycle and that this may be due to NO-mediate d S-nitrosy lation of the cysteine residue inhibiting protease activity in the protease 3C [19, 20] . Har-ris et al. demonstrat ed that several processes in the late stages of viral replicatio n, including viral DNA replication, viral protein synthesis, and virion maturation, were greatly inhibited by IFN-induced NO in vaccinia virus [30] . Other in vitro studies utilizing chemical donors of NO have shown inhibition of viral replication in DNA and RNA viruses. It was suggested that NO inhibits viral proteins, RNA synthesis and viral replication by modifying molecules such as reductases and protease s required for replication [2, 18, 20, 21, 31] . To our knowledge, this is the first time that a direct virucidal activity of gNO on cell free virions is reported. There may be targets on the virion, such as HA and NA, to which NO could bind and disrupt the infection process. However, little is known about the antiviral mechanis m by which NO acts. One of the plausible mechanism s of antimicrobial activity of NO involves the interactio n of this free radical (and a reactive nitrogen intermediate) with reactive oxygen intermediates , such as hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) and superoxide (O \u00c0 2 ) to form a variety of antimicrobi al molecula r species [32] . Colasanti et al. theorized that nitric oxide may be able to affect surface proteins, by nitrosyla tion of the cysteine moieties within its structure [16] . This could alter the stoichiometry interactio n with sialic acid or prevent the fusion of the virion with the epithelial cell membran e [33] . Results from this study seem to support the notion.",

The variation of these molecule s over time permits the virus to evade human immune responses and therefore necessitates the formulation of a new vaccine each year. The HA is a sialic acid receptor-bind ing molecule and mediates entry of the virus into target cells. Whereas, the NA cleaves the cellular-rece ptor sialic acid residues to which the newly formed particles are attached . This cleavage releases the viruses, which can then invade new cells. Like other NA inhibitors , without functional NA, infection could be limited to one round of replicatio n, rarely enough to cause disease. Preliminary results, shown here for the first time, demonstrat e that when testing on a whole virion, NA activity is inhibited by gNO. Thus, NA inhibition may be one possible mechanism of viral inhibition by NO. We are currently screening a wide variety of viruses to gNO to assess which are more or less susceptible to gNO. Concurrentl y, we are also evaluating NA and HA inhibition in these viruses. Together, this hopefully will shed further light on the antiviral mechanism caused by gNO.",

Regardles s of the gNO concentr ation (80 or 160 ppm) the antiviral effect coincided with a specific range of nitrite concentratio n and acidic pH that were depende nt on the exposure time. This can be explained by the fact that, over time, gNO diffuses into the saline and results in increasing the nitrite concentr ation. These ions react with protons in the water and produce HNO 2 resulting in a drop in pH. This resulting pH level along with the nitrite concentration is within the same range as was found to be antifungal and antibacte rial in other studies using a combinati on of acid and nitrite (acidified nitrite) producing NO gas [34] [35] [36] . Although low pH levels on their own, can have an antiviral effect, we show here that by eliminating the acidified liquid milieu we still achieve a reduced cellular infectivit y of H1N1. The gNO treatment in this case showed reduced infectivity (by 85%) and thus provides further evidence that there are targets on the virion that NO may bind with and prevent cellular infectivity. This notion was further supported by the results from the NA assay. Moreover, We have shown here that when adding virus into either 10 mM nitrite at a neutral pH or to saline with a reduced pH (4.5), for 1 h, no effect on virus viability was found. This confirms our conclusions , which support the thought that the NO is the antiviral compound in this reaction. Time (min) Fig. 3 . NA inhibition by gNO.

At a dose of 160 ppm a significant virucidal and an antiviral effect during early infection of influenza A was observed. However influenza B was not similarly affected during infection but was susceptibl e in a cell free environment. We propose here a mechanism of action for the viral inhibition, in which influenza NA is being inactivated by gNO.
