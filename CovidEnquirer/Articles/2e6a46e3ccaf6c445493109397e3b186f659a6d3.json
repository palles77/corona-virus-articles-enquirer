Thus, they can be visualized only with the electron microscope, which provides a resolving power of approximately 0.3 nm. Although the first electron microscope was developed in the 1930's, the complexity of the instrument and the slow development of preparative methods for examining biological material delayed its application in the study of viruses. The first use of the electron microscope as a diagnostic instrument in virology was reported by Nagler and Rake (1948) and van Rooyen and Scott (1948) , who demonstrated that virus particles could be identified in clinical specimens from patients affected with smallpox, vaccinia, and varicella. Virologists were slow to adopt this approach, and it was more than a decade before the electron microscope was finally being used in the differential diagnosis of smallpox and chicken pox (Peters et al., 1962; Nagington, 1964; Cruickshank et al., 1966) .",

Because of the impracticability of performing direct EM examination on every clinical specimen submitted for virus studies, most virus laboratories with EM facilities continue to rely on cell cultures for virus isolation, but perform a presumptive morphological identification of the viral isolate by negatively staining cultures showing a cytopathic effect (CPE) (Doane et al., 1969; Spradbrow and Francis, 1969; Pennington et al., 1975) . Viral isolates can readily be identified as to group by electron microscopy; subsequent specific identification can then be performed by standard serological methods.",

Although we have found virus in negatively stained infected cultures showing no cytopathic effect, as well as those showing complete cell destruction, in general, it is preferable to work with cultures showing a well-developed CPE (Figs. 9-12) . Viruses, such as orthomyxoviruses and paramyxoviruses, can often be detected in the culture medium, simply by withdrawing a few drops and negatively staining by the water drop or agar diffusion methods (Sections III,C,2 and 3). As a routine, however, it is more reliable to negatively stain a sample of the cells, especially if the cytopathic effect has not progressed to involve the entire cell sheet. Furthermore, with viruses that are markedly cell-associated, such as adenoviruses and reoviruses, virus particles remain in the cells long after complete destruction of the culture.",

If no virus is found in the cell lysate, however, the culture medium is processed both by the water drop and agar diffusion methods. Enveloped viruses such as togaviruses and oncornaviruses are often so severely ruptured by negative staining that they are impossible to recognize by electron microscopy. P. J. Middleton and M. T. Szymanski (personal communication) have overcome this problem by adding a few drops of 2.5% buffered glutaraldehyde to the drained culture for 1 to 2 hours.

This is an important consideration when the viral isolate is a togavirus (Fig. 14) or oncornavirus, which may be difficult to observe in negatively stained preparations, due either to a low particle concentration or to disruption of viral ultrastructure during preparation for electron microscopy. For preparing infected cell cultures for thin sectioning, the following method requires only a single tube culture . Cells are gently resuspended in the culture medium, transferred to a small conical-tipped centrifuge tube, and pelleted in a clinical centrifuge at 1500 rpm for 3 minutes. The medium is discarded, leaving only two to three drops in the tube to allow for transfer of the cells to a flat waxed surface (e.g., Parafilm). A fine-bore glass tube, 1.3 x 75 mm, is touched to the drop to draw in the cell suspension by capillary action. One end is sealed with Plasticine and the tube is centrifuged in a hematocrit centrifuge for 3 minutes at 12,500 rpm. The cells now form a compact pellet immediately above the Plasticine plug. The tube is scored and broken at a distance of 6 to 7 mm above the cell pellet. The tube is then inverted, and a blunt wire (paper clip) of diameter slightly narrower than the bore of the tube is used to push against the Plasticine, forcing the cell pellet into a vial of fixative. The cell pellet at this and subsequent stages remains tightly packed, and can be transferred easily in the tip of a Pasteur pipette. It can be processed either by standard EM embedding methods or by the rapid embedding method (Section IV,B).",

The following morning the mixture is spun at 10,000 rpm fori hour to sediment immune complexes. For smaller viruses, e.g., picornaviruses, centrifugation of at least 15,000 rpm is recommended, whereas vaccinia-antibody complexes will sediment using a clinical-type bench centrifuge. The resultant pellet is usually resuspended in a small volume of distilled water prior to negative staining and examination in the electron microscope. Some workers have shortened the entire procedure to 1 hour incubation at 37\u00b0C (Lutton, 1973; Vassal and Ray, 1974; Doane, 1974) . Edwards et al. (1975) and Valters et al. (1975) described a more sensitive indirect IEM method, whereby the virus-antibody complexes were further aggregated by anti-immune globulin sera (anti-IgG). When applied to serotyping of adenoviruses, it was from 4 to over 32 times more sensitive than the direct method, indicating its value not only in differentiation of viruses, but also as a sensitive method for revealing new viruses (e.g., when used with patients' serum).",

(1975) for detecting adenovirus type 7 in throat swab specimens (and which identified 19 out of 25 adenovirus-positive specimens), is as follows: \u03af ml of diluted adenovirus antiserum was mixed with an equal volume of throat swab fluid and incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C and then for 3 hours at 6\u00b0C. The mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 g for 30 minutes, and the pellet was suspended in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. An equal volume of anti-IgG serum, diluted to the optimal concentration (as determined by a chess board titration of adenovirus type 7 antiserum and anti-IgG) was added, and this mixture was incubated at 6\u00b0C for 16 to 20 hours. The mixture was then centrifuged at 12,000 g for 30 minutes, the pellet was suspended in 0.1 ml of distilled water, negatively stained, and examined by EM. Kelen et al. (1971; Kelen and McLeod, 1974) have described a practical microtechnique for demonstrating hepatitis \u0392 antigen-antibody complexes and for serotyping myxoviruses and paramyxoviruses. Virus and antiserum are incubated together at 37\u00b0C for i hour. A microdrop of the mixture is then deposited on the surface of a standard microscope slide that has previously been covered with 5 ml of 0.8% agar. Immediately thereafter, a Formvar-carbon coated grid is placed upside down and left floating on top of the drop. When diffusion of the fluid phase into the agar is complete (a matter of a few minutes), the grid is removed for negative staining and EM examination. Specimens prepared by the ADF method are both partially purified and concentrated, the agar acting as a molecular sieve and effectively removing interfering salts, maeromolecules, and tissue debris of 15 nm in diameter, while retaining the virus particles on the surface.",
