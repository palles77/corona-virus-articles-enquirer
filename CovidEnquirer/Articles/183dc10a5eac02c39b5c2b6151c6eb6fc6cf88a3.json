We examined the epidemiologic features of these cases and found an estimated median incubation period of 6.1 days (8.8 days in hospital A and 4.6 days in hospital B). The overall attack rate was 3.7% (4.7% in hospital A and 3.0% in hospital B), and the attack rates among inpatients and caregivers in the same ward were 12.3% and 22.5%, respectively. The overall case-fatality rate was 44.0% (28.6% in hospital A and 63.6% in hospital B). The use of cohort quarantine may have played a role in preventing community spread, but additional transmission occurred among members of the hospital cohort quarantined together. Caregivers may have contributed in part to the transmission.",

The patient had flown among several countries in the Middle East (Bahrein, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar) and became the source of consecutive hospital-to-hospital transmissions after his return to South Korea, which led to 186 laboratoryconfirmed cases (5) and 38 deaths. Hospital-to-hospital transmission involved 17 hospitals and originated from 1 hospital (hospital P) (5, 6) . This transmission was attributable to \"hospital shopping\" by some MERS patients (4, 5) and was particularly evident in Daejeon, which is the fifth largest city in South Korea. The index case-patient for nosocomial transmission in Daejeon had initially traveled from his home city of Daejeon to Pyeongtaek, South Korea, seeking healthcare at hospital P, after which he returned to Daejeon. Subsequently, 2 hospitals in Daejeon experienced MERS cases attributable to this patient. This index case-patient in Daejeon was consecutively hospitalized at hospital A in Daejeon during May 22-28, 2015, and at hospital B during May 28-30, 2015. Thereafter, an additional 25 MERS cases (14 in hospital A, 11 in hospital B) were reported.",

Moreover, we used the floor plan of each hospital to estimate the spatial distributions and transmission routes of the virus within the hospitals. These estimates enabled us to identify a possible location of exposure and a transmission route for each confirmed case. When a patient with a confirmed case had experienced several possible exposures, we determined the most probable exposure by author consensus. Persons who had had face-to-face contact with patients with confirmed cases were considered the closest contacts. When the data were ambiguous, the following were reviewed independently by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Daejeon In-Depth team: all potential exposures by symptom onset; disease duration; physical distance from a patient with a confirmed case; and infector factors including ambulation status, symptoms (including a productive cough), and sharing of caregivers. When a patient with a confirmed case had been subjected to several potential exposures, the most probable exposure was determined by consensus of the 2 teams. An expert member of the Korean Society of Epidemiology reviewed all decisions. The process was repeated until a final consensus was obtained.",

Quarantine policy to prevent additional transmission of MERS, Daejeon, South Korea* Action \uf0b7 The cohort quarantine applied to admitted patients and their caregivers (professional or family) exposed to the MERS case-patients. \uf0b7 Inpatients admitted to the same hospital room before quarantine were quarantined in the same room because their degree of exposure was probably the same. Their caregivers were also quarantined in the same room because of the need for caregiving. \uf0b7 The medical staff (physicians, nurses, and medical technologists) exposed to the MERS case-patients were subjected to home quarantine. However, members of the households of medical staff were not subjected to home quarantine until and unless that medical staff member exhibited any symptoms. Contact between household members and the medical staff member was severely restricted. \uf0b7 The wards under cohort quarantine were controlled by unexposed medical staff using level D protectors (Microguard 2000; 3M, Bracknell, UK). Each protector included an N95 mask, protective glasses, a whole-body protective gown, gloves, and boots. \uf0b7 The body temperature of persons (including inpatients and caregivers) and medical staff admitted to cohort or home quarantine was checked, and these persons were clinically interviewed twice daily. If they reported any symptoms (including a febrile sensation or chills) or if they were asymptomatic but with a body temperature >37.5C\u00b0, they were immediately placed in a quarantined area at each hospital. The KCDC performed laboratory tests at this stage; the results were available 3 d later. If the doctor in charge strongly suspected MERS, that patient could be transferred, with careful precautions, to a national isolation hospital within 1 d. \uf0b7 All wards were disinfected by use of sodium hydrosulfite, 80% (vol/vol) alcohol, and 2% (vol/vol) chlorhexidine twice during each shift, thus 6 times/d. \uf0b7 South Korea operates a nationwide medical insurance scheme; all costs incurred by MERS patients were covered. \uf0b7 Persons with confirmed MERS were transferred to another quarantine room that had negative-pressure equipment. Strategies for caregivers \uf0b7 The infection control team carefully explained the risk for MERS and the need for cohort quarantine to all caregivers. Some caregivers did not wish to remain in hospital wards with inpatients. They were taken home and placed in in-home quarantine and used the same MERS quarantine strategy applicable to medical staff in close contact with the patients. \uf0b7 Caregivers attended only noninfected inpatients who required total care. If an inpatient was confirmed to have MERS, nursing care was provided by professional nurses wearing protectors. \uf0b7 The infection control team continuously educated caregivers on how MERS was transmitted and how to prevent infection.",

The characteristics of the specific hospital seemed to affect attack rates and case-fatality rates. The index case-patient in Daejeon was consecutively admitted to 2 hospitals. The fifth floor of hospital A specializes in senile patients, most of whom have chronic illnesses, including Parkinson's disease, paraplegia attributable to old infarctions, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Most beds on the fifth floor are occupied by bedridden patients. The attack rate among caregivers was higher in hospital A than in hospital B. Because immobile patients require personal caregiving, their caregivers were required to be in prolonged close contact with patients, which might have resulted in a higher attack rate. Hospital B is a university hospital and thus contained more severely ill patients than hospital A. Ward 101, to which the Daejeon index case-patient was admitted, is the main ward of the pulmonary medicine department. We presumed that the case-fatality rate was higher for hospital B than hospital A because of underlying pulmonary disease, which has been reported to be a risk factor for development of more severe diseases (8) .",

Hospitals A and B applied cohort quarantine. In this situation, cohort quarantine had several advantages and disadvantages. The primary purpose was to prevent the spread of MERS-CoV to the local community. After applying cohort quarantine, no further spread of MERS-CoV occurred other than within hospitals A and B. This result may have been achieved by quarantining all persons who had been in contact with MERS-CoV-infected patients and by refusing hospital entry to all susceptible persons. In addition, more cases were diagnosed promptly by active surveillance of the cohort. However, this policy had a limitation. One cohort accommodated inpatients and caregivers in the same hospital room; thus, if 1 person in the cohort was infected by MERS-CoV, others were exposed, increasing the probability of MERS-CoV transmission. This practice raises an ethical issue in terms of whether letting persons stay in the same room with potential MERS patients is justified by the purpose of preventing transmission of the virus to the community. Some caregivers at hospital A may have had difficulty complying with the quarantine policy (the protector and contact rules) because they cared for immobile patients. Thus, this practice may have increased transmission within the hospital.",

He was employed by hospital A during January-May 30, 2015, and his bedroom was located on the seventh floor.

We presume that he was infected by fomites in an elevator or exposed to a patient in a place lacking closedcircuit television coverage.

It is possible that some medical staff and caregiver, contaminated with MERS-CoV after visiting room 1007, may have visited case-patient 83 in room 1013.
