The phenomenon of emerging infections has been constant with the majority of human infections reflecting the introduction into humans of zoonotic pathogens.",

In fact the emergence of new infections has expanded the paradigms of microbiology in a number of ways, which will be highlighted here. Specifically: (1) it is now well appreciated that influenza can migrate directly from avian sources to humans, and the appreciation of the actual directness of 'species jumping' has moved forward; (2) new infections have also introduced uncertainty in transmission dynamics with emphasis on super-spreader events as well as nosocomial transmission; (3) infectious particles are not confined to those organisms which contain genetic material; (4) a new paradigm such as 'Planetary Health' may be necessary for defining these trends; and (5) global preparedness and response is not in place for the next pandemic. For further background information, the reader is referred to the original article on this phenomenon (Kimball, 2008) . A general discussion of antimicrobial resistance and xenotransplantation is not included in this discussion as they were thoroughly covered in the original article. Antimicrobial resistance will be covered in detail in another article of this volume. Nonetheless they continue to be important considerations.",

Ideally detecting pathogens in animals could be seen as a harbinger for human outbreaks. In fact this has been a working hypothesis of major US Agency for International Development (USAID) funding to their pandemic agents program. However, recent outbreaks of influenza, SARS, and MERS coronavirus (CoV) demonstrate how emerging infections are shifting this longstanding paradigm. They lend further urgency to this area of research. In addition, these outbreaks have challenged our understanding of transmission dynamics. Empirical observation has shown that there is not a single transmission force 'number' which completely characterized the spread of infectious diseases. This further complicates efforts to control infection within populations.",

In 1997 a small but lethal cluster of influenza occurred in children in a Hong Kong nursery. Of the 18 cases, 6 died (Mounts et al., 1999) . Science shifted its understanding of influenza and recognized that flu could come directly from birds to humans. In fact H5N1, which emerged in 2003, acquired the popular moniker of 'Bird Flu.' The outbreak was curtailed through active surveillance, changes in practice, and poultry culling of live markets in Hong Kong. However, the outbreak proved a harbinger of more widespread recognition of 'Bird Flu.' H5N1 was identified through active surveillance of poultry and wild birds; waterfowl were particularly affected. Human cases were sporadic but carried a very high mortality rate (estimated at 60%) (Webster et al., 2006) .",

In the aftermath of these contentious discussions, new policy initiatives were put into place. This included the 'Pandemic Influenza Preparedness' (PIP) (WHO) plan which took some years to negotiate. It balances access to new viral strains for vaccine production with access to these vaccines for poor countries.

While SARS was declared poorly transmissible, it effectively jumped continents in travelers and infiltrated populations through nosocomial spread. In contrast to influenza, which is highly transmissible, SARS still requires direct exposure to bodily fluids for transmission.

Traditionally infection has been characterized by a 'reproductive rate' which is essentially the rate at which an infectious case replaces itself. If the rate is 1, then there will be no spread, as the infection will simply stay the same absolute number as the index case recovers. However, if the rate is higher (i.e., >1), then spread into the population will occur as a single case infects multiple individuals so the number of cases increases. Super-spreaders seem to have high infection rates although the overall rate for the pathogen in question may be low. This has, of course, changed our assumptions for modeling disease spread in populations.",

The UK beef industry had historically been a relatively stable one when fragmented among many smaller farms across the British Isles. To protect this industry, the government maintained a tariff on the imports of competing products from abroad. With the explosion of global trading in beef after World War II, coincident with refrigerated transport, and the movement toward global free trade, the United Kingdom negotiated a timetable under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to scale down tariffs on beef, which heightened competition in the UK beef industry and increased pressure for more efficient and less costly production methods.",

The rendering or processing of carcasses of cows and other animals after the edible and usable bits of flesh and meat have been cut away has been done for centuries. And for decades, UK farmers used the meat and bone meal from rendering as a protein source for beef cattle. Historically, the rendering process was similar to pressure cookingapplying very high temperatures for very long times so eventually even the bones broke down into powder. It was an expensive, fuel-consuming, and timeconsuming process. When a new cold vacuum extraction method of rendering was introduced requiring lower temperatures (i.e., less energy) and less time, it seemed a win-win situation considering the increasing pressure on the UK beef industry in the face of global competition. But sometime after the new rendering practice was introduced into the United Kingdom, the prion disease known as mad cow disease emerged. The new process, discovered by UK beef industry, was not effectively disinfecting for prions. Existence of prion disease was unknown prior to its dramatic emergence, first in cows and then in people. The context is important to appreciate. Somehow the streamlining of the rendering process played a role. British scientists tested the new process by deliberately introducing animals with mad cow disease and assaying the resulting meat and bone meal product. They found that the newer rendering process does not remove the infection, whereas the older process did.",

These are mobile, with the ability to be taken in across classes of bacteria if and when they confer a selective advantage for survival, as in the case of antimicrobial resistance. The new enzyme NDM-1 (New Delhi metalloproteinase-1) was traced to an infection that occurred in patients who had been treated in India.

This is the only law with the force of an international treaty, which is in place to govern the conduct of countries during global security emergencies. The IHR outline 'core capacities' for national-level protection. It is not the optimal level for an emergent pandemic, but it is the minimum considered essential for global health security. The IHR implementation was to have been completed by all member countries by 2012. However, implementation has languished with only one-third of countries implementing and many not disclosing their status of implementation to the WHO in 2015.",

At the time of its appearance, none of the countries in sub-Saharan Africa had implemented the core capacities of the IHR (Kimball and Heymann, 2014) . The outbreak went on to create pandemonium in the three most affected countries (Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone) killing over 11 000 people (and afflicting more than 28 000) (ebola-situation). Infection was introduced in other countries, but onward transmission was limited. Following Ebola, the international systems are again under review. Initial observations remain distressingly similar to those made in 2009. With reform of the UN and WHO, once again underway, it will be important to follow through. Of particular importance as highlighted above is the interdisciplinary (and in the case of the UN interagency) nature of prevention, detection, and response to emergent threats. Despite the new technological tools, the ecological factors in emergence are ever gathering force. Clearly additional efforts are required. Emerging infections remain an intersectoral challenge with every indication they will continue to be with us over the coming decades.",
