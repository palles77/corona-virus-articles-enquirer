Analysis of the resulting hybridization pattern demonstrated a strong hybridization signal to many oligonucleotide probes on the microarray from the family Flaviviridae, in particular to WNV. Consensus reverse transcription PCR primers (5) targeting WNV were used to confi rm the microarray results. Sequencing of the 261-bp amplicon (GenBank accession no.

The serologic results demonstrate that subclinical infections can occur and that exposure can be variable. We did not determine specifi c dates of exposure for these populations. Both Bexar County, Texas, and Orange County, Florida, have had WNV in wildlife since 2002. We continue annual serology on previously negative animals to document seroconversion.
