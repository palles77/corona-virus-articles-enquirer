In general, however, a diagnosis of ABRS may be made in adults or children with symptoms of a viral URI that have not improved after 10 days or worsen after 5 to 7 days. There may be some or all of the following signs and symptoms: nasal drainage, nasal congestion, facial pressure/pain (especially when unilateral and focused in the region of a particular sinus), postnasal drainage, hyposmia/anosmia, fever, cough, fatigue, maxillary dental pain, and ear pressure/fullness.",

When selecting antibiotic therapy for ABRS, the clinician should consider the severity of the disease, the rate of progression of the disease, and recent antibiotic exposure. The guidelines now divide patients with ABRS into two general categories: (1) those with mild symptoms who have not received antibiotics within the past 4 to 6 weeks, and (2) those with mild disease who have received antibiotics within the past 4 to 6 weeks or those with moderate disease regardless of recent antibiotic exposure. The difference in severity of disease does not imply infection with a resistant pathogen. Rather, this terminology indicates the relative degree of acceptance of possible treatment failure and the likelihood of spontaneous resolution of symptoms-patients with more severe symptoms are less likely to resolve their disease spontaneously. The primary goal of antibiotic therapy is to eradicate bacteria from the site of infection, which, in turn, helps (1) return the sinuses back to health; (2) decrease the duration of symptoms to allow patients to resume daily activities more quickly; (3) prevent severe complications such as meningitis and brain abscess; and (4) decrease the development of chronic disease. Severe or life-threatening infections with or without complications are rare, and are not addressed in these guidelines.",

Clinical trials conducted in this era of widespread antimicrobial resistance are just beginning to provide sufficient evidence to use as the basis for recommending treatment options but, in general, they are not sufficiently powered to be of objective use. In lieu of evidence, several factors may be useful to clinicians in selecting therapy for individual patients. These factors include pathogen distribution in ABRS, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles, mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance, and data from in vitro surveillance studies. Many of these factors have been incorporated into a mathematical model that can be used to objectively compare various antimicrobial options for ABRS.",

Sinusitis accounted for 9% and 21% of all pediatric and adult antibiotic prescriptions, respectively, written in 2002. 6 In addition to its public health implications, rhinosinusitis has a considerable economic impact. The most recent estimates suggest that expenditures attributable to ABRS total approximately $3.5 billion each year in the United States. 7 In 2002, approximately $400 to $600 million was spent on antibiotic prescriptions for acute sinusitis. 6, 8 Differentiating bacterial from viral rhinosinusitis often is a challenge because the clinical features of the two diseases are similar, and the common imaging modalities are not sufficiently sensitive or specific. As a result, clinicians often overtreat uncomplicated rhinosinusitis by readily prescribing antibiotics for the majority of patients with signs and symptoms of VRS (eg, headache, facial pain, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, fever). Recent reports in the medical literature suggest that primary care physicians prescribe antibiotics for up to 85% to 98% of patients with clinically suspected rhinosinusitis. 9, 10 The practice of treating uncomplicated VRS with antibiotics has two fundamental limitations: first, secondary bacterial infection complicates a relatively small proportion of cases and second, excessive antibiotic use is associated with consequences, both to individuals and to society as a whole.",

Excessive antibiotic use is strongly associated with the development and spread of bacterial drug resistance. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] Recent strategies promoting prudent and rational antimicrobial use have been implemented over the past several years. In 2000, there were 25 million fewer antibiotic prescriptions in the ambulatory care setting compared with 1992 (17% reduction). 17 The most substantial reductions in antimicrobial prescribing have occurred for respiratory tract infections among children (\u03fd15 years of age). However, there was no significant change in the populationbased antibiotic prescribing rate for sinusitis among children. 18 In rhinosinusitis, two features of antibiotic prescribing are of particular concern. First is the frequent treatment of uncomplicated VRS with antimicrobials. Second is the selection of antimicrobial agents without documented efficacy or that are no longer effective due to the development of resistance. The continued goal of this panel is to develop guidelines for the judicious use of antibiotics in the treatment of ABRS.",

Allergy, trauma, or other environmental factors that lead to inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinuses may also predispose individuals to developing ABRS. Approximately 50% of common colds are caused by the human rhinovirus. Other viruses that cause rhinosinusitis include coronavirus, influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and enterovirus.

            "text": "Human rhinovirus and coronavirus do not cause major epithelial damage, but influenza virus and adenovirus cause significant damage the nasal epithelium. 21, 22 Human rhinovirus, for example, enters via the nose or lacrimal duct and attaches to ICAM-1 receptors on epithelial cells in the posterior nasopharynx. 23 There is upregulation of the production of histamine, bradykinin, and various cytokines, including interleukin-1, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor-\u2423, and leukotriene C4. Viruses also have a substantial suppressive effect on neutrophil, macrophage and lymphocyte function. Effects on neutrophil function include diminished adherent, chemotactic, phagocytic, oxidative, secretory, and bactericidal functions. Viruses also suppress macrophage and lymphocyte function, resulting in patients with viral URIs being generally more vulnerable to secondary overgrowth and subsequent bacterial infection by pathogens residing in the nasopharynx, such as S pneumoniae and H influenzae. An animal model of nontypeable H influenzae adherence to respiratory epithelium was studied in the cotton rat with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. 24 Colonization with nontypeable H influenzae increased to a maximum within 4 days of RSV infection compared to RSV negative controls and then declined over the subsequent 10 days. Systemic immunity to nontypeable H influenzae as measured by IgG-specific antibody to the outer membrane complex and bactericidal antibody did not influence colonization. These data suggest that colonization with nontypeable H influenzae is significantly affected by a concurrent infection with RSV 24 ; however, the site of bacterial attachment is not known. The mechanism of attachment involves upregulation of expression of epithelial cell surface receptors including CEACAM1, ICAM-1, and PAF-r. 25 Subsequent activation of inflammatory pathways and the parasympathetic nervous system generates the symptoms of rhinosinusitis. Fever, myalgia, and pharyngitis frequently associated with a viral URI tend to resolve after 5 days, whereas nasal congestion and cough may persist into the second and third week ( Figure 1 ). 26 Fever alone at day 10 is not suggestive of ABRS. The causes of secondary bacterial invasion of the sinuses are unknown, but a combination of factors such as nose blowing, 27 local/systemic immunity, the virulence of the virus, colonization of the nasopharynx with potential bacterial pathogens (eg, S pneumoniae) and various environmental factors may lead to conditions that are conducive for bacterial entry and growth in the sinuses.",

Contrary to popular belief, a change in the color or the characteristic of the nasal discharge is not a specific sign of bacterial infection because after a few days of a viral infection, mucopurulent nasal secretions may occur due to an influx of neutrophils. [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] In a recent study, 35 the clinical signs and symptoms significantly associated in a multivariate model with the presence of bacteria included colored nasal discharge, facial pain, and radiologically determined maxillary sinusitis (complete opacity, air-fluid level, or mucosal thickening \u03fe10 mm). The model only had a sensitivity of 69% and a specificity of 64% and therefore could not be used either as a screening tool or as a diagnostic criterion for bacterial rhinosinusitis. The authors of this study concluded that the signs and symptoms of acute rhinosinusitis in patients with mild-to-moderate clinical presentations are poor predictors of the presence of bacteria. 35 In a study by Gwaltney et al 4 (n \u03ed 31), 87% of adults with acute onset of URI symptoms demonstrated inflammation within the nose and viscous secretions, sometimes with air bubbles, in the sinuses on CT scan. After 2 weeks without antibiotic therapy, repeat CT scans in 14 subjects revealed that 79% showed either disappearance or marked improvement in the previously identified abnormalities. The point at which a viral URI becomes superinfected with pathogenic bacteria may be determined with repeated sinus aspiration studies. Sinus aspiration studies in adults demonstrate significant bacterial growth in approximately 60% of patients with URI symptoms for 10 days or more. 36 While duration of symptoms beyond 7 days is a moderately sensitive predictor of ABRS, it is relatively nonspecific because duration of symptoms does not reliably distinguish prolonged viral infection from ABRS. 37 Individual cases may fall out of the \"norm\" of this typical progression and have specific findings suggesting bacterial infection (fever, facial erythema and swelling, and severe pain); therefore, clinicians need to rely on clinical judgment when using these guidelines. In general, a diagnosis of ABRS may be made in adults or children with a viral URI that has not resolved after 10 days or worsens after 5 to 7 days and is accompanied by some or all of the following signs or symptoms: nasal drainage, nasal congestion, facial pressure/pain (especially when unilateral and focused in the region of a particular sinus), postnasal drainage, hyposmia/ anosmia, fever, cough, fatigue, maxillary dental pain, and ear pressure/fullness (Table 1) .",

Several studies have evaluated whether certain signs or symptoms are specific to bacterial infection; however, these studies have methodologic limitations in that sinus aspiration was not used to document the presence or absence of bacterial infection. 37 Unlike acute otitis media, in which the tympanic membrane and middle ear space are readily available for direct (2) sneezing and sore throat; and (3) cough and rhinorrhea, which are common and persistent in a significant proportion of patients. Persistence of these last two symptoms is entirely consistent with an uncomplicated rhinovirus infection. 26 examination, the paranasal sinuses are hidden within the skull. Anterior rhinoscopy, with or without topical decongestant, allows examination of the mucosa of the inferior turbinate, secretions within the anterior nose, and the orientation of the nasal septum. Fiberoptic endoscopy allows visualization of the middle meatus, and direct culture of purulence in this region may correlate with cultures from maxillary sinus aspirates. 38, 39 In a recent review of the literature, Benninger et al 40 reported that there is 60% to 85% concordance between culture material obtained from endoscopically guided middle meatal swabs and maxillary sinus puncture. These studies, however, are limited by small sample sizes, and are therefore inadequate to make recommendations regarding the role of endoscopically guided middle meatal cultures as a formal method of identifying pathogens in ABRS at this time. A prospective study is currently underway to better answer this question. Other diagnostic modalities include transillumination, ultrasound, and radiological imaging. Transillumination has a 60% and 90% reproducibility rate for assessing disease within the maxillary sinuses and the frontal sinuses, respectively, but this does not differentiate bacterial from viral infection. 41 B-mode ultrasound has replaced A-mode ultrasound for the diagnosis of diseases within the paranasal sinuses. However, because only the maxillary sinus can be adequately assessed, B-mode ultrasound has limited utility. A study correlating CT scan and B-mode ultrasound findings demonstrated a sensitivity of roughly 73% for the maxillary sinuses, 23% for the frontal sinuses and 11% for the ethmoids. 42 Compared with clinical evaluation, the sensitivity of B-mode ultrasound was 36% and the specificity was 90%. 43 Because ultrasound is technique-sensitive, there may be marked variations in the reliability of the information provided. 44 Ultrasound cannot distinguish between viral and bacterial rhinosinusitis.",

CT scans clearly detect abnormalities within the sinuses; however, as previously noted, abnormalities are frequently found on CT scans of patients with viral respiratory disease. 4 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), without exposing patients to ionizing radiation, distinctly reveals mucosal thickening and fluid within the paranasal sinuses. In patients with maxillary sinusitis, serial MRI scans demonstrate mucosal thickening persisting for up to 8 weeks. 46 Significant mucosal changes seen on CT or MRI may therefore persist significantly beyond microbiologic resolution of bacterial or viral disease. CT and MRI scans are not recommended for the routine management of ABRS, but they may be helpful in guiding the management for more complex cases.",

However, the routine use of antimicrobial therapy for patients who experience mild sinus symptoms for a short duration (indicative of self-limiting viral rhinosinusitis) is generally not a reasonable option because of the risks associated with promoting resistance. Unfortunately, not all cases are straightforward, and the decision of whether-and when-to initiate antimicrobial therapy for an individual patient with signs and symptoms consistent with ABRS often requires consideration of potential risks and benefits of treatment. For example, there is a subset of patients who may experience prolonged, moderate to relatively severe symptoms that are more attributable to host factors (eg, immune response, anatomic abnormalities) rather than bacterial infection. For these patients, the benefits of initiating an earlier course of antimicrobial therapy might be appropriate.",

The cell wall, an important determinant of inherent susceptibility or resistance for any bacterium to many antimicrobial agents, consists primarily of proteins, lipids, and a peptidoglycan layer. The peptidoglycan layer is composed of oligosaccharide chains cross-linked by short peptides that serve as the major structural component for maintaining cell-wall integrity. Although gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria share many common structural elements in their cell walls, the organization and content of these elements vary between these two bacterial classes ( Figure 2 ). The cell wall of gram-positive bacteria consists almost entirely of a thick peptidoglycan layer fused to the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane. Gram-negative bacteria, however, have cell walls composed of a hydrophobic lipopolysaccharide capsule surrounding a lipoprotein-phospholipid membrane that contains small channels called porins. A thin peptidoglycan layer lies between the outer membrane and the inner cytoplasmic membrane. These two biological layers are separated by the periplasmic space. This space is an important site for degradation of antibiotics by drug-inactivating enzymes, such as \u2424-lactamases, in gram-negative bacteria. Penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), enzymes essential for cell-wall synthesis, are located in the cytoplasmic membrane. PBPs are found in gram-negative and -positive organisms. Altered PBPs, which have decreased affinity for \u2424-lac-tams, have been identified in a variety of organisms.",

Further, a study Bernstein et al 61 suggests there is a \"to-and-fro\" exchange of these organisms between the nasopharynx and the lateral nasal wall. Bacterial pathogens were isolated from 79% of adenoids and 46% of lateral walls of the nose in children undergoing adenoidectomy. Molecular typing of pairs of nontypeable H influenzae, S pneumoniae, and M catarrhalis revealed that in 16 of 18 pairs (89%) the identical strain was present in both sites simultaneously. In addition, administration of antimicrobials increases carriage of antimicrobial-resistant strains of these bacterial pathogens. 62 Adults also have colonization of the nasopharynx, but duration of carriage is shorter than in children. 63 A recent study 64 demonstrated that one of the primary respiratory pathogens was recovered from the nasopharynx of approximately 75% of adults.",

Resistance to \u2424-lactams results following a stepwise alteration in PBPs, which leads to a decrease in the binding affinities of \u2424-lactams. 70 Varying degrees of resistance to penicillin and other \u2424-lactams develop because changes can occur in multiple PBPs to alter the affinity for \u2424-lactams. 71 There are six known PBPs in S pneumoniae-1a, 1b, 2b, 2x, 2z, 3-and alterations in 1a, 2b, and 2x are most often associated with resistance to penicillin (penicillin minimum inhibitory concentrations [MICs] range from 0.25 g/mL to \u03fe8 g/mL compared to \u05450.06 g/mL for susceptible strains). 72 Macrolide resistance results primarily from alterations in ribosomal binding sites (due to a ribosomal methylase) or expression of an efflux mechanism. 73, 74 There are two important genes responsible for macrolide-resistant strains that are most commonly encountered in the clinical setting: erm genes, which code for a ribosomal methylase and mef genes, which code for a macrolidespecific cell membrane-based efflux mechanism. The efflux mechanism confers a relatively moderate degree of resistance, compared to the high level of resistance seen in strains with altered ribosomal binding sites. The efflux mechanism is generally more common in the United States and is relatively uncommon in most other parts of the world. Recently, mechanisms of macrolide resistance were identified that could not be explained by any of the known resistance determinants. 75 These novel mechanisms of macrolide resistance involve mutations in genes encoding ribosomal proteins (L4 or L22) or ribosomal RNA (23S rRNA). Mutations in genes for L22 and 23S rRNA result in increased macrolide MICs; however, the effect is variable (MIC range 0.25 g/mL to \u03fe64 g/mL). Mutations in genes for L4 generally confer high-level resistance (MICs \u03fe64 g/mL). 72, 76 Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Volume 130 Number 1 SINUS AND ALLERGY HEALTH PARTNERSHIP 13",

[80] [81] [82] [83] [84] Ribosomal methylase also confers cross-resistance to clindamycin. Macrolide usage, particularly azithromycin, has been associated with the recent increase in S pneumoniae resistance to macrolides in the United States. 15 Fluoroquinolone resistance results following mutations in targets binding sites of these agents, DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, rather than requiring the acquisition of foreign genes. Mutations in the parC gene that encodes for topoisomerase IV or in the gyrA gene encoding for the Gyr A subunit of DNA gyrase results in low-level quinolone resistance. Mutations in both genes results in the expression of high-level quinolone resistance. Although cross-resistance commonly occurs among the fluoroquinolones, the newest agents often remain active against some strains that have become resistant to older agents. A fluoroquinolone efflux mechanism (pmrA) also has been described for S pneumoniae. 85 Resistance to trimethoprim and sulfonamides are also primarily a result of mutations in the target binding sites of these agents, dihydropteroate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase.",

Third-generation cephalosporins (eg, ceftriaxone and cefixime) are stable in the presence of \u2424-lactamases, whereas clavulanic acid is a broad-spectrum irreversible inhibitor of \u2424-lactamases. Because clavulanic acid is destroyed in the process of \u2424-lactamase inhibition, it is often described as a \"suicide inhibitor.\" Combinations of \u2424-lactams and \u2424-lactamase inhibitors (eg, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) often are useful for the treatment of many \u2424-lactamase-producing bacteria including, H influenzae and M catarrhalis. Other \u2424-lactamase inhibitors include tazobactam and sulbactam. It is important to note that \u2424-lactamase inhibitors only serve to increase the amount of active \u2424-lactam compound at the target site to exert its activity against otherwise susceptible bacteria. Therefore, if the bacteria are not inherently susceptible to \u2424-lactam in the absence of \u2424-lactamases, addition of a \u2424-lactamase inhibitor will not make the organism susceptible. Alterations in PBPs also have been reported occasionally among strains of H influenzae, and these strains are referred to as \u2424-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR). Resistance among BLNAR strains is attributable to alterations in PBPs 3a and 3b. 87 Most gram-negative organisms have multiple efflux pumps to remove waste and foreign material; one efflux pump for H influenzae is chromosomally mediated via acrAB genes. Macrolides and azalides are substrates for these pumps and, as a result, these agents have intrinsically poor activity against H influenzae. 88",

Two other terms used are: MIC 50 , the lowest concentration that inhibits 50% of the isolates tested and MIC 90 , the lowest concentration that inhibits 90% of the isolates tested. It is extremely important to remember that the MIC is an in vitro characteristic of the antimicrobial and is determined under strictly adhered to conditions. Because environmental conditions at the site of infection rarely correspond to in vitro susceptibility test conditions, effects of elements such as oxygen tension, pH, and protein binding on the activity of the antimicrobial of interest need to be considered. Therefore, even if an organism appears susceptible in vitro, clinical failure may occur if in vivo conditions detract from the activity of the drug. Similarly, some host factors may actually improve the in vivo activity of an antimicrobial. Macrophages, opsonic factors, and complement may all act synergistically with an antibiotic and thus provide enhanced antibacterial activity over that which would be predicted in vitro.

Pharmacodynamics describes the relationship between drug concentration and pharmacologic effect. For an antibiotic, it describes the relationship that exists between the drug concentration to which the bacteria is exposed at various sites of infection and bacterial killing. Pharmacodynamics attempts to integrate both microbiologic and pharmacokinetic data into more clinically relevant relationships. The evolution of this science has augmented the body of knowledge about how antimicrobials best treat infections. In addition, pharmacodynamics can be utilized to determine the impact of antimicrobial resistance. Consideration of pharmacodynamics can help define the MIC limit at which the pharmacokinetics of a specific antimicrobial drug would not be expected to result in treatment success.

These agents do not kill more efficiently when the concentration exceeds a critical value. While a concentration that is two-to fourfold higher than the MIC is generally regarded as being optimal (ie, greatest likelihood of clinical success), further increasing the drug concentration beyond this magnitude does not improve the rate or extent of bacterial killing. These antibiotics exhibit time-dependent killing, and the best predictor of clinical outcome is the duration of time the concentration at the site of infection remains above the MIC (T \u03fe MIC) for the bacteria. In simplistic terms, the antibiotic needs to be at a high-enough concentration for a long-enough period of time at the site of infection. For \u2424-lactams and extracellular pathogens, the free-drug concentration in serum is generally proportional to that in the interstitial fluid bathing the organism (protein-bound drug lacks antimicrobial activity). Therefore, the proportion of the dosing interval that the free-drug concentration in serum exceeds the antimicrobials MIC against a pathogen also reflects this parameter at most sites of infection. The amount of time that the free-drug concentration of a time-dependent antibiotic remains above the MIC (T \u03fe MIC) generally does not vary with the pathogen or the immunocompetence of the host. Data from in vitro pharmacokinetic simulations, animal models, and human clinical studies suggest that the T \u03fe MIC needed to achieve bacterial eradication should generally be \u03fe40% to 50% of the dosing interval for time-dependent antibiotics. 96, 97 The optimal PK/PD parameter varies somewhat for \u2424-lactams because of variability in the bacterial killing rate. For example, the T \u03fe MIC that correlates with optimal outcomes with carbapenems (15% to 25%) is slightly lower than with penicillins (30% to 40%) and cephalosporins (40% to 50%) because carbapenems have a more rapid bacterial killing effect. 98 The relationship between the T \u03fe MIC and efficacy has been evaluated in patients with acute otitis media caused by S pneumoniae and H influenzae. Bacteriologic cure rates of 80% to 85% were observed when the T \u03fe MIC for various \u2424-lactams were \u03fe40% to 50% of the dosing interval. 99, 100 Moreover, in hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia, no differences in clinical outcome were observed between patients receiving cefuroxime sodium as a 1500 mg per day continuous infusion (T \u03fe MIC \u03ed 100%) compared to 750 mg intermittently three times daily (estimated T \u03fe MIC \u03ed 50% to 60%). 101 Thus, a serum concentration which is present for 40% to 50% of the dosing interval may be used to determine the susceptibility limit or \"breakpoint\" of an organism for a given dosing regimen. Additionally, the proportion of bacteria that are therefore susceptible can be based on the proportion of isolates with MICs at or below these susceptibility limits or breakpoints.",

Macrolides (eg, erythromycin and clarithromycin) and azalides (eg, azithromycin) exhibit time-dependent killing; however, because of the prolonged postantibiotic effect against gram-positive cocci and H influenzae 102 , the pharmacodynamic parameter for these agents that correlates with efficacy is the AUC to MIC ratio rather than T \u03fe MIC. The AUC to MIC ratio that yields maximal efficacy with drugs from the macrolide and azalide class in animal models is approximately 25. 103 Concern has been raised regarding the propen-sity of azithromycin to select for bacteria that are macrolide-resistant. 104 The impact of communitybased azithromycin use on the carriage and resistance of S pneumoniae has been prospectively studied. 105 Single-dose azithromycin (20 mg/kg) was given to children with trachoma (a chronic disease caused by Chlamydia trachomatis) and to their household contacts who were children. Carriage rates of azithromycin-resistant S pneumoniae immediately before treatment and 2 to 3 weeks, 2 months, and 6 months after treatment were 2%, 55%, 35%, and 6%, respectively. The selective pressure of azithromycin may have allowed the growth and transmission of preexisting azithromycin-resistant strains. One possible explanation for this observation relates to the long serum half-life of azithromycin and the long duration of subinhibitory concentrations of the drug. 106 If the serum AUC for two antimicrobials, one with a short and the other with a long serum half-life, are compared with MIC values superimposed, a period or \"window\" for potential Darwinian selection can be plotted (Figure 10) . For the antimicrobial with a short halflife, the duration of time between the drug concentration falling below the MIC and its total elimination from the body is relatively short compared to that of the antimicrobial with the longer half-life. For an antimicrobial with a 68-hour halflife (eg, azithromycin), total elimination from the body does not occur for 5 to 7 half-lives or 14 to 20 days. This period of subinhibitory concentrations of drug may be the pharmacodynamic explanation for the aforementioned observations. This concept is controversial and requires validation in future studies, but similar findings have recently been reported in a study from Israel. 94 Antimicrobials exhibiting concentrationdependent killing and prolonged persistent effects. Fluoroquinolones and ketolides exhibit a concentration-dependent mechanism of bacterial killing, in which they kill most efficiently when their concentrations are appreciably above the MIC of the pathogen. 97, 107, 108 The goal of dosing regimen is to maximize drug concentration at the site of infection. The AUC:MIC ratio and the peak:MIC ratio are the major parameters correlating with efficacy. Fluoroquinolones eradicate organisms best at levels 10-to 12-fold higher than the MIC for the pathogen. Increases between 1 and 10 times the MIC of the S pneumoniae organism, the rate and extent of killing is increased, but the rate and extent of killing do not improve if the organism is initially susceptible to quinolones. If the organism has a range of susceptibilities, however, the rate and extent of killing favors the more potent in vitro agents. [107] [108] [109] [110] If the optimal peak-to-MIC ratio is obtained, most bacteria die rapidly and consequently, the period of time over which the bacteria is exposed to the drug exposure is minimal.",

Data obtained from several sources including animal models of sepsis, in vitro pharmacodynamic experiments, and clinical outcome studies indicate that the magnitude of the AUC to MIC ratio can be utilized to predict outcomes. Forrest et al 112 demonstrated that an AUC to MIC ratio of \u0546125 was associated with the highest bacterial eradication rates in the treatment of infections caused by gram-negative enteric pathogens. However, for gram-positive bacteria, it appears that effective AUC to MIC ratios can be appreciably lower. For instance, against S pneumoniae, an in vitro model of infection demonstrated that for levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin an AUC to MIC ratio of approximately 30 was associated with a 4-log reduction in bacterial titers; while ratios \u03fd30 were associated with significantly reduced rates of bacterial killing and in some instances bacterial regrowth. 113 Similarly, Lister and Sanders 114 reported that for levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin an AUC-to-MIC ratio of 32 to 44 was associated with maximal eradication of S pneumoniae in an in vitro model of infection. These observations are supported by data from non-neutropenic animal models of infection, in which survival was associated with an AUC-to-MIC ratio of 25 to 30 against the pneumococcus. 115 Moreover, these observations from in vitro models of infection are further supported by clinical data. The relationship between microbiologic response and the AUC-to-MIC ratio for gatifloxacin and levofloxacin was recently evaluated in patients with pneumococcal respiratory tract infections. 116 This analysis demonstrated that for gatifloxacin and levofloxacin, AUC-to-MIC ratios of at least 33.7 correlated with the eradication of S pneumoniae. AUC-to-MIC ratios \u03fe33.7 were associated with 100% of patients having a positive microbiologic response to therapy, while those patients with AUC-to-MIC ratios \u03fd33.7 had only a 64% response to therapy. The probability of attaining an AUC-to-MIC ratio exceeding 30 with currently approved doses varies among fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin \u0546 gatifloxacin \u0546 levofloxacin). Ketolides have not yet been approved for use in the United States, and their optimal PK/PD parameters have not yet been clearly established. Certain animal models of infection (eg, mouse thigh infection) suggest that the AUC-to-MIC ratio that correlates with efficacy against S pneumoniae for most ketolides is 25 to 50, 103,117 whereas higher ratios (up to 100) improve survival. 117 For one of the ketolides, telithromycin, the AUC-to-MIC ratio that correlates with efficacy for S pneumoniae may be much higher (between 50 and \u03fe200). [118] [119] [120] Based on this uncertainty, we have considered telithromycin to be considered equivalent to currently available macrolides/azalides until subsequent data proves otherwise. Bacteriologic eradication rates in clinical trials to date with telithromycin suggest this agent may be valuable for the management of community-acquired respiratory tract infections, although the value of such studies is limited, as most bacteriologic outcomes are presumed outcomes based on clinical outcome. 121 The PK/PD goals identified using animal models generally correlate with those in humans, and despite PK differences between animals and humans, the PD target is similar. This should not be surprising because the antimicrobial target is within the bacterial pathogen and not the mammalian host. However, the animal models often exclude host defenses (ie, neutrophils) to more clearly delineate the effects of antimicrobial therapy, and there are data to suggest that the PK/PD goal may be lower for certain agents (eg, ketolides) in the presence of adequate host defenses. 122, 123 Furthermore, the PK/PD goals from animal models are calculated based on the assumption that serum concentrations approximate concentrations at the site of infection. However, certain agents (eg, macrolides) tend to accumulate at various sites of infection (eg, epithelial lining fluid), which may affect the PK/PD goal for these agents. 124 Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles play an important role in the evaluation and selection of antimicrobial therapy for ABRS and bacterial infections, in general. Once the PK/PD parameter that best predicts antimicrobial activity in vivo (ie, T \u03fe MIC, AUC:MIC ratio) is identified and the magnitude of the PK/PD parameter required for efficacy is determined (ie, PK/PD goal), resistance can be defined for situations in which the PK/PD goal cannot be achieved. The PK/PD goal generally does not change based on the site of infection, it is not affected by the dosing regimen or the infecting pathogen (including resistant strains), or the use of other agents in the same drug class (as long as free-drug concentrations are used).",

In fact, in most cases, PK/PD breakpoints can be determined from previously published data (ie, plasma concentration vs. time curves). For time-dependent agents (eg, \u2424-lactams), the PK/PD breakpoint can be determined by identifying the timeframe (Xaxis) that corresponds with 40% to 50% of the dosing interval and extrapolating that to the concentration (Y-axis) ( Figure 11) .

Schematic illustration of the serum pharmacokinetic profile of two time-dependent oral drug regimens over an 8-hour dosing interval. Drug A is present at 2 g/mL for \u03fe50% of the dosing interval. Drug B is present at 2 g/mL for approximately 35% of the dosing interval, but at 1 g/mL for \u03fe50% of the dosing interval. Therefore, infections caused by a pathogens for which the MICs of both drugs are 2 g/mL are more likely to be cured by Drug A rather than Drug B. Drug B would, however, be effective against strains where the MIC is \u05451 g/mL, as Drug B is present at 1 g/mL for \u03fe50% of the dosing interval. Drugs A and B can be two different time-dependent drugs, or two different dosing regimens of the same agent. A similar process can be done to determine the PK/PD breakpoint for concentration-dependent agents, in which the AUC (for the unbound serum fraction) is divided by 25 or 30. therapy, which is reflected by the MIC of the agent against the pathogen. However, because of natural differences in biological systems, both MICs and human pharmacokinetic curves in serum distribute across a range of values. 127, 128 Consequently, some bacterial strains are less susceptible to an antimicrobial agent than others and some are more susceptible than others. Similarly, some people absorb, metabolize, distribute, and excrete a drug more rapidly than others, and some more slowly, leading to considerable variations in pharmacokinetic parameters. 129 As a result of these variations, antimicrobial-agent efficacy in vivo may differ from the in vitro prediction of drug susceptibility in some patients. To determine the true efficacy of an agent in every patient, the MIC of the causative organism against the agent used and the serum pharmacokinetics of the agent would need to be determined in each patient. This is, of course, physically impossible, and has only been performed on a small scale for both practical and The activity of telithromycin against S pneumoniae, H influenzae, and M catarrhalis depends on its PK/PD breakpoint, which is uncertain at this time. The activity of telithromycin is assumed to be similar to that of macrolides/azalides until further information becomes available.

However, the modal MIC of gatifloxacin is 0.25 g/mL, or one quarter of the breakpoint, whereas that of levofloxacin is 1 g/mL or one half of the breakpoint. 132 Variations in pharmacokinetics between patients are therefore more likely to result in levofloxacin not achieving its target more often than gatifloxacin, as gatifloxacin has a wider \"safety margin\" than does levofloxacin between MIC values and breakpoints. The variability in pharmacokinetics of these agents in patients enrolled in clinical trials, using dosing regimens of 400 mg once daily for gatifloxacin and 500 mg once daily for levofloxacin, is illustrated in panels C and D of Figure 12 . AUC values for gatifloxacin varied from 8 to 500 (mean 64), while values for levofloxacin varied from 17 to 389 (mean 70). The \"average\" AUC and modal MIC values for these two agents would therefore result in \"average\" AUC:MIC ratios of 256 for gatifloxacin and 70 for levofloxacin. However, the variations in AUCs between patients and in MICs between isolates could result in AUC: MIC ratios varying from 1.5 to 6667 for gatifloxacin and from 3 to 2783 for levofloxacin. 131 Monte Carlo simulation is a statistical method for estimating the probability of obtaining a desired target, which, in this case, is the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameter needed to eradicate an infection, such as an AUC:MIC ratio of 30. Monte Carlo methods randomly select values from within a fixed range and selected to fit a probability distribution (eg, bell curve). Monte Carlo simulation can use individual values in two data sets, in this case MICs and AUCs, to generate random AUC:MIC ratios from randomly chosen MIC and AUC values. This can be done thousands of times, and the distribution of these results can be plotted.",

Further study of these problems is needed, particularly to address variations in pharmacokinetics between each dose of an agent during a course of therapy in an individual patient as most data collected to date only reflected pharmacokinetics determined over one dosing interval in each patient.",

Amoxicillin is 20 to 50 times less potent than third-generation cephalosporins (ie, cefixime, cefpodoxime), and occasional failures may be expected in infections caused by \u2424-lactamase-negative strains of H influenzae treated with standard doses of amoxicillin. While the addition of clavulanate enhances the activity against \u2424-lactamase-producing strains of H influenzae, drugs or formulations that optimize PK/PD performance help prevent treatment failures that occur when patients concentrate the drug at the site of infection (for varying reasons) to a less than average degree, especially when the average tissue concentration is close to the MIC of the pathogen (see discussion on Monte Carlo analyses). This is the reason why recent studies show that high-dose amoxicillin (\u03ee clavulanate) has significantly fewer bacteriologic failures against \u2424-lactamasenegative H influenzae than lower doses, even though the in vitro susceptibility rate for regular doses of amoxicillin-clavulanate is 98%. The addition of clavulanate does not appear to be a driving force in the development of resistance. When administered three times a day, amoxicillin/clavulanate has been associated with a high incidence of gastrointestinal side effects compared to most of its alternatives. The incidence is significantly less with twice-a-day dosing. In general, when the clavulanate dose exceeds approximately 10 mg/kg per day, diarrhea can become a problem.",

[143] [144] [145] [146] Because of this, fluoroquinolones should not be used indiscriminately, and the most pharmacodynamically potent fluoroquinolones should be used to treat the suspected pathogen. When the decision is made to use a fluoroquinolone, preference should be given to agents that are most likely to achieve optimal PK/PD parameters. The relative in vitro potency (based on PK/PD parameters) for several fluoroquinolones was moxifloxacin \u03fe gatifloxacin \u03fe levofloxacin.

However, many of the current clinical trials evaluating antimicrobial therapy have methodologic limitations (eg, diagnostic criteria, comparators, endpoints, outcomes measures) that preclude them from being considered as evidence. Furthermore, the trends in antimicrobial resistance have changed dramatically over the past 10 years, which has affected the applicability of evidence from older clinical trials. While a large meta-analysis 20 recently was conducted to evaluate the role of antimicrobial therapy (in general, and the role of specific agents/ classes) in ABRS, many of the individual trials were conducted prior to the widespread resistance that is currently reported in S pneumoniae and H influenzae. As a result, the findings from this meta-analysis may not be applicable to the current treatment of ABRS. 160 The methodology used in the present guidelines for evaluating antimicrobial therapy for ABRS does, however, take into account the current high levels of antibiotic-resistant organisms. In the absence of current evidence, it becomes more challenging to identify optimal therapy for ABRS. Rather than subjectively compiling a rank order of antimicrobial agents based on in vitro activity data and expert consensus, we utilized a more objective methodology to assessing treatment options. This approach involved the use of a mathematical model-the Poole therapeutic outcomes model-to predict treatment outcomes in ABRS. The therapeutic outcomes model was extrapolated from work originally conducted by Marchant et al, 161 involving the correlation between in vivo potency of various antimicrobial agents with clinical outcomes using double-tympanocentesis methodology in otitis media. In these studies, Marchant et al observed that nonbacterial factors can result in discrepancies between bacteriologic and clinical outcomes. For example, an agent with a 100% bacteriologic cure rate will not necessarily have a 100% clinical cure rate because some patients will continue to experience symptoms re- sulting from nonbacterial factors (eg, viral infection, persistent middle ear effusion). Conversely, antimicrobial agents with relatively poor bacteriologic cure rates often appear to be more effective than expected because of the high rate of spontaneous resolution of symptoms. As a result, highly efficacious agents generally have only slightly better impact on clinical outcomes (ie, symptoms) compared with less-efficacious agents, despite more dramatic differences in bacteriologic outcomes. The therapeutic outcomes model is a tool to help predict the likelihood of bacteriologic success with particular antimicrobial agents by accounting for various factors including: (1) the proportion of patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and a positive sinus aspirate; (2) the clinical resolution of disease in the culture-negative patient group; (3) the distribution of pathogens frequently encountered in ABRS; (4) the spontaneous resolution rate associated each pathogen; and (5) the in vitro susceptibility of the predominant sinusitis pathogens to antimicrobial agents at PK/PD breakpoints ( Figure 13 ). The therapeutic outcomes model also can predict overall clinical outcomes for the total patient group (ie, those with either bacterial or nonbacterial disease).",

An additional 8% to 14% of patients will have persistent nasal/sinus symptoms, regardless of any antibiotic therapy prescribed. These persistent symptoms are likely due to nonbacterial causes of facial pain, nasal obstruction, or rhinorrhea (eg, allergy, headaches, and anatomic factors). The next component accounts for the distribution of pathogens in ABRS and the likelihood of spontaneous resolution associated with each of these pathogens (based on placebo-controlled trials in acute otitis media). Among bacterial infections-as mentioned above-the pathogen distribution in adults is S pneumoniae (33% to 41%), H influenzae (29% to 35%), and M catarrhalis (4% to 8%). Most studies suggest that 10% to 20% of the bacterial sinus infections are caused by pathogens other than S pneumoniae, H influenzae, or M catarrhalis. For this model, the percentages used for the pathogen distribution have been modified to yield a total of 100%. Also, \"miscellaneous\" pathogens are omitted from the model in this guideline revision because (1) the FDA does not typically consider them to be important pathogens, (2) adequate susceptibility data against these pathogens is lacking, and (3) the activity of a given antimicrobial agent against miscellaneous pathogens is likely to be close to the average of its activity against the three usual pathogens. The overall susceptibility pattern of a given agent is not substantially affected by the exclusion of these miscellaneous pathogens.",

The terms mild and moderate have been integrated into the decision-making process to reflect the degree of pa- tient discomfort (as evidenced by the symptom complex and the time course of the disease) and the likelihood of experiencing spontaneous resolution of those symptoms. In other words, patients with moderate disease are more likely to require therapeutic intervention to achieve resolution of their symptoms, and these patients are less likely to tolerate treatment failures. The differences in disease severity do not imply the presence or absence of antimicrobial resistance. Patients, however, may not always be neatly categorized based on this classification. An evaluation of disease severity requires clinical judgment gained only by the clinician familiar with the patient. Severe lifethreatening infection with or without complications is not addressed in these guidelines. Recent antibiotic use is a major risk factor associated with infection caused by resistant pathogens. 163, 164 Other risk factors include age \u03fd5 years and attendance in day-care centers. Because recent antimicrobial exposure increases the risk of carriage and infection due to resistant organisms, antimicrobial therapy should be based on the patient's history of recent antibiotic use.

Recommendations for initial therapy for children with mild disease and who have not received antibiotics in the previous 4 to 6 weeks include the following: high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (90 mg/6.4 mg per kg per day), high-dose amoxicillin (90 mg/kg per day), cefpodoxime proxetil, cefuroxime axetil, or cefdinir. TMP/SMX, azithromycin, clarithromycin, or erythromycin is recommended if the patient has a history of immediate Type I hypersensitivity reaction to \u2424-lactams. These antibiotics have limited effectiveness against the major pathogens of ABRS and bacterial failure is possible. The clinician should differentiate an immediate hypersensitivity reaction from other less dangerous side effects. Children with immediate hypersensitivity reactions to \u2424-lactams may need: desensitization, sinus cultures, or other ancillary procedures and studies. Children with other types of reactions and side effects may tolerate one specific \u2424-lactam, but not another. \u2020When a change in antibiotic therapy is made, the clinician should consider the limitations in coverage of the initial antibiotic. The respiratory fluoroquinolones (gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin), ceftriaxone, and amoxicillin/clavulanate (4 g/250 mg) currently have the best coverage for both S pneumoniae and H influenzae. The terms mild and moderate are designed to aid in selecting antibiotic therapy.",

Rather, this terminology indicates the relative degree of acceptance of possible therapeutic failure, and the likelihood of achieving spontaneous resolution of symptoms. The determination of disease severity lies with the clinician's evaluation of the patient's history and clinical presentation. Severe, life-threatening infection, with or without complications, is not addressed in these guidelines. \u00a7Prior antibiotic therapy within 4 to 6 weeks is a risk factor for infection with resistant organisms. Antibiotic choices should be based on this and other risk factors. The total daily dose of amoxicillin and the amoxicillin component of amoxicillin/clavulanate can vary from 1.5 to 4 g/day. Lower daily doses (1.5 g/day) are more appropriate in mild disease in patients with no risk factors for infection with a resistant pathogen (including recent antibiotic use). Higher daily doses (4 g/day) may be advantageous in areas with a high prevalence of penicillin-resistant S pneumoniae or DRSP, for patients with moderate disease, for patients who may need better H influenzae coverage or for patients with risk factors for infection with a resistant pathogen. There is a greater potential for treatment failure or resistant pathogens in these patient groups.",

Examples of combination therapy regimens include high-dose amoxicillin (4 g/day) or clindamycin plus cefixime, or high-dose amoxicillin (4 g/day) or clindamycin, plus rifampin. There is no clinical evidence at this time, however, of the safety or efficacy of these combinations. #Cephalosporins should be considered initially for patients with penicillin intolerance/non-Type I hypersensitivity reactions (eg, rash). TMP/SMX, doxycycline, macrolides, azalides, and ketolides are not recommended unless the patient is \u2424-lactam allergic. Their effectiveness against the major pathogens of ABRS is limited, and bacterial failure of 20% to 25% is possible. A respiratory fluoroquinolone (eg, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin) is recommended for patients who have allergies to \u2424-lactams or who have recently failed other regimens. **Telithromycin is not approved for use by the FDA (at the time of writing). \u2020 \u2020Reevaluation is necessary because the antibiotics recommended for initial therapy provide excellent activity against the predominant ABRS pathogens, including S pneumoniae and H influenzae. Additional history, physical examination, cultures, and/or CT scan may be indicated, and the possibility of other less common pathogens considered. \u2021 \u2021Rifampin is a well-known inducer of several cytochrome p450 isoenzymes and therefore has a high potential for drug interactions.

            "text": "Amoxicillin/clavulanate ( \u2020When a change in antibiotic therapy is made, the clinician should consider the limitations in coverage of the initial antibiotic. Ceftriaxone and high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate currently have the best coverage for both S pneumoniae and H influenzae. \u2021The terms mild and moderate are designed to aid in selecting antibiotic therapy. The difference in severity of disease does not imply the presence or absence of antimicrobial resistance. Rather, this terminology indicates the relative degree of acceptance of possible therapeutic failure, and the likelihood of achieving spontaneous resolution of symptoms. The determination of disease severity lies with the clinician's evaluation of the patient's history and clinical presentation. Severe, life-threatening infection, with or without complications, is not addressed in these guidelines. \u00a7Prior antibiotic therapy within 4 to 6 weeks is a risk factor for infection with resistant organisms. Antibiotic choices should be based on this and other risk factors. The total daily dose of amoxicillin and the amoxicillin component of amoxicillin/clavulanate can vary from 45 to 90 mg/kg per day. Lower daily doses (45 mg/kg per day) are more appropriate in mild disease in patients with no risk factors for infection with a resistant pathogen (including recent antibiotic use). Higher daily doses (90 mg/kg per day) may be advantageous in areas with a high prevalence of penicillin-resistant S pneumoniae or DRSP, for patients with moderate disease, for patients who may need better H influenzae coverage or for patients with risk factors for infection with a resistant pathogen. There is a greater potential for treatment failure or resistant pathogens in these patient groups.\u00b6Based on in vitro spectrum of activity, combination therapy using appropriate gram-positive and -negative coverage may be appropriate. Examples of combination therapy regimens include high-dose amoxicillin (90 mg/kg per day) or clindamycin plus cefixime, or high-dose amoxicillin (90 mg/kg per day) or clindamycin, plus rifampin. Other combination therapy regimens may be appropriate for patients with \u2424-lactam allergy. There is no clinical evidence at this time, however, of the safety or efficacy of these combinations. #Cephalosporins should be considered for patients with penicillin intolerance/non-Type I hypersensitivity reactions (eg, rash). TMP/SMX, macrolides, and azalides are not recommended unless the patient is \u2424-lactam allergic. Their effectiveness against the major pathogens of ABRS is limited, and bacterial failure of 20% to 25% is possible. **Reevaluation is necessary because the antibiotics recommended for initial therapy provide excellent activity against the predominant ABRS pathogens, including S pneumoniae and H influenzae. Additional history, physical examination, cultures, and/or CT scan may be indicated, and the possibility of other less common pathogens considered. \u2020 \u2020Excluding \u2424-lactams, clindamycin is the most active oral agent currently available with activity against approximately 90% of S pneumoniae isolates. It has no activity, however, against H influenzae or M catarrhalis.",

Cefdinir, cefpodoxime proxetil, or cefuroxime axetil may be considered for patients with nonserious hypersensitivity reactions to penicillin. In such instances, cefdinir is the preferred agent based on patient acceptance. 138, 139 TMP/SMX, azithromycin, clarithromycin, or erythromycin are recommended if the patient is \u2424-lactam allergic (Type I hypersensitivity reaction). Ceftriaxone or combination therapy with adequate gram-positive and -negative coverage may also be considered. Examples of appropriate regimens of combination therapy include high-dose amoxicillin or clindamycin plus cefixime, or high-dose amoxicillin or clindamycin plus rifampin. When ceftriaxone is selected, a dose of 50 mg/kg per day IM or IV should be used for 5 days. This duration of therapy was arbitrarily extrapolated by the committee based on data from acute otitis media studies. Rifampin should not be used as monotherapy, casually, or for longer than 10 to 14 days as resistance emerges rapidly to this agent. Monotherapy with clindamycin for \u2424-lactamallergic patients is appropriate if S pneumoniae is identified as a pathogen.Failure to respond to antimicrobial therapy after 72 hours should prompt either a switch to alternate antimicrobial therapy or reevaluation of the patient (see Table 4 ). When a change in antibiotic therapy is made, the clinician should consider the limitations in coverage of the initial agent.When amoxicillin (\u03ee clavulanate) is selected for patients at risk for infection with penicillin-resistant S pneumoniae or DRSP (eg, recent antimicrobial use, day-care attendance, etc.), the high-dose regimen should be used. This recommendation is based on data from acute otitis media studies. 165 ",

The panel hopes these guidelines will continue to provide a rational approach to the need for antimicrobial therapy in bacterial rhinosinusitis, reduction in the use of antibiotics for nonbacterial infections, and the appropriate use antibiotics when bacterial disease is likely.
