The viral subunit was released from the virion by sonication and was separated from intact virus and other viral components by isopycnic centrifugation. It had a buoyant density in sucrose of 1.02 g/ml. Further purification consisted of gel filtration through Sephadex G200, in which process the immunogen, with a molecular weight of approximately 25 000, was the last component to be eluted. A group of ten young, weaned swine, inoculated intramuscularly with two or three 1-mg doses of the viral subunit were protected against challenge with virulent TGE virus, probably by the induction of secretory IgA. The immunogen also induced a humoral immune response of variable magnitude (titers ranging from 8 to 5 625) in the animals. These antibodies are not believed to \"be directly related to protection against infection. They can, however, be easily identified by serologic procedures and may serve as a convenient indicator of responsiveness to the TGE viral immunogen. porcine transmissible gastroenteritis; viral subunit; vaccine; TGE",

The disease is especially severe in newborn pigs, and during epizootics the mortality rate among animals < 2 wk of age approaches 100%. In addition, an enzootic form of TGE exists as a persistent problem particularly among young weaned swine in nurseries. Since there exist no efficacious treatments, progression of the disease is limited primarily by the immune responses. This has led to efforts in many laboratories to develop vaccines and/or strategies for their administration. Thus far, these efforts in the United States or other countries have remained without success [3, 8, 14] .",

            "text": "In most instances, intramuscular (IM) inoculation with intact TGE viruses has resulted in the production of circulating antibodies, sometimes in high titers, but less success has been achieved in inducing protective antibodies which are believed to be secretory IgA [1, 5, 6, 16, 20, 24] . Ingestion of live virus that infects the intestinal tract and stimulates submucosal immunocompetent cells has been considered to be essential triggering for the secretion of IgA antibody [18] . Virulent virus is relatively efficient in inducing resistance to subsequent infection, but resistance to challenge after oral vaccination with attenuated strains of TGE virus, which cause limited damage to epithelial cells of the intestinal villi, has proved highly variable [3, 4, 11] . In addition, a problem associated with the use of live viruses as vaccines, in general, is that they may, under some conditions, revert to virulent and clinical disease may be the result. For this reason attention in recent years has been directed toward the use of viral subunits as immunogens. This paper describes a subunit component, isolated from a virulent strain of TGE virus, that has been shown by laboratory experiments to be both an effective and a safe immunogen for induction of protection of swine against challenge with the pathogen.",

The mixture was held at 40\u00b0C for 1.5 to 2.5 h for precipitation to be completed and then was centrifuged at 9500 X g for 30 min. The pellet was dispersed in Eagle's MEM to a volume 1/20th of the original and was layered over a discontinuous sucrose gradient (10, 25, 40% sucrose in TRIS-EDTA buffered saline at pH 7.4). Rate-zonal centrifugation was carried out at 100000 X g for 1.5 h. Since the buoyant density of the dehydrated TGE virus associated with PEG is 1.122 g/ml, the virus sedimented to the 25-40% sucrose interface. Material at this position was collected, sonicated with a Biosonic IV sonic oscillator (Bronwill, VMR Scientific, San Francisco, CA, U.S.A.) for 10 s at low power, and dialyzed against TRIS-EDTA buffered saline (pH 7.4) to remove sucrose. Then it was fractionated by isopycnic centrifugation through a continuous sucrose density gradient (10 to 60% sucrose in TRIS-EDTA-buffered saline, pH 7.4) for 18 to 20 h at 260 000 X g.

In many cases success has been achieved in a humoral immune response but almost uniformly there has been a failure of this response to provide satisfactory protection [4] . Bohl and Saif [7] and Saif et al. [18] have proposed that the problem in the development of protection against infection is associated with the class of immunoglobulin, production of which is stimulated. Infection of the intestinal tract results predominantly in secretion oflgA but IM inoculation with the virus results in synthesis of IgG. The IgA which is produced locally neutralizes TGE virus in the lumen of the small intestine but little or no IgG is released into this site of infection. Furthermore, secretory IgA is relatively stable in the environment of the digestive tract; IgG is not.",

These subunit immunogens can be produced either by disrupting and fractionating virions or by interrupting the sequence of viral replication at some point after which essential antigens are synthesized but before assembly of intact and virulent virions occurs. Subunits used as antigens offer the advantage of being completely safe because the nucleic acid essential for replication of the virus can be eliminated. Toxic factors can be removed. Also selection of components can be made in order to induce antibodies of more limited specificity and of the most suitable activities. Most experimental subunit vaccines consist of surface components, frequently glycoproteins, which are involved in attachment of the pathogen to the host cell prior to invasion [13] .

At the final isopycnic centrifugation during the procedure that was being used, a band of protein with a buoyant density of only 1,02 g/ml always was observed in the sucrose gradient. In an attempt to identify the component, it was found to absorb neutralizing activity from hyperimmune serum (unpubl. observations). Therefore, the fraction was inoculated into rabbits and pigs with the hope that it would induce production of highly specific antibody for use as fluorescein-conjugate to be utilized in diagnostic procedures.

Possibly the relative size of the two is a factor, having a significant effect upon metabolic reactions and types of cells and sites involved in processing of antigens. The smaller subunit might be more rapidly disseminated throughout the body, being processed at many sites, including the liver, and stimulating immunocytes at various locations, thus inducing all classes of antibodies.

Since the swine with the lowest titers were as resistant to TGE as were those with the highest titers this humoral antibody may be incidental to protection against clinical disease but may nonetheless serve as a convenient indica-tion that the animal was responsive to the immunogen. It is believed that the protective antibody which was produced but could not be measured was secretory IgA released into the lumen of the intestine. Unpublished preliminary experiments with a limited number of pigs have indicated that fluids removed from the lumen of the intestine of immunized swine contain antibodies sensitive to 2-mercaptoethanql and of a molecular size larger than IgG.
