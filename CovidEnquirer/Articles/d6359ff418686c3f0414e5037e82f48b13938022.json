Structures universally present in these eyes are an outer fibrous tunic (cornea and sclera), middle vascular tunic or uvea (iris, ciliary body, choroid), inner neural tunic (retina), and internal optical media (aqueous humor, lens, vitreous) . This basic pattern, particularly as it applies to mammals, is outlined in Chapter 1. Familiarity with general ocular anatomy and physiology is crucial to understanding the clinical signs and pathogenesis of ophthalmic disease. The objective of this chapter is to discuss differences in ocular anatomy and provide the general practitioner with information pertaining to the ophthalmic examination and diagnostic testing, common ophthalmic diseases, and their treatments in exotic species.",

Knowing the appropriate technique for proper restraint not only allows a better examination but also reduces overall stress on the animal. For example, the rear limbs and spine of a rabbit should always be adequately supported. When stressed, they may struggle, possibly resulting in hyperextension of the lumbosacral spine and vertebral fractures. During the examination of raptors, the practitioner must always be cognizant of the talons, because severe injury can occur if appropriate precautions are not taken.",

However, performing indirect ophthalmoscopy should be a standard part of the ophthalmic examination and is facilitated through pharmacologic mydriasis and use of a highly refractive indirect lens. Lenses of 30, 40, or 60 D are particularly useful. Pupillary dilation in mammals is achieved with 1% tropicamide, usually within 20 minutes and persists for 4 to 8 hours. The pupils of birds and reptiles will not dilate with anticholinergic agents owing to the presence of striated muscle fibers in both the pupillary sphincter and dilator muscles. Achieving mydriasis in these species is more difficult and may require intracameral infusion of curariform neuromuscular blocking agents. More recently, topical application of vecuronium bromide (1 drop twice at a 15-minute interval) with or without the addition of phenylephrine and atropine has been demonstrated to cause consistent mydriasis lasting 1.5 to 4 hours in birds. Other curariform neuromuscular blocking agents used topically have been associated with severe side effects, including paralysis of muscles outside the eye, especially those of respiration. Caution should always be exercised in the use of these agents topically or intracamerally. Their use has not yet been evaluated in reptiles. Mydriasis may also be achieved with general anesthesia, although this method has its own inherent risks and complications.",

Although rabbits only blink once every 5 to 6 minutes, their tear film remains stable and they rarely have exposure keratitis secondary to evaporation. Tear film stability is likely enhanced by the presence of four orbital glands: the lacrimal gland, an accessory lacrimal gland with retrobulbar, orbital, and infraorbital lobes, superficial gland of the third eyelid, and deep gland of the third eyelid (harderian gland). Retention of the lacrimal lake may be facilitated by the lack of a superior lacrimal puncta, which would result in a slower rate of tear clearance. The nasolacrimal duct follows a tortuous route through the lacrimal and maxil-lary bones and passes in close proximity to the apices of the molar and incisor teeth before emerging through the nasal mucosa. Owing to several sharp bends and associated duct narrowing, blockage of the duct and subsequent dacryocystitis is common.",

Pasteurella multocida has frequently been implicated as the cause for these abscesses, although confirmation through culture is rarely attained. Regardless of the specific pathogen responsible, it likely gains access to the orbit either through infected molar tooth roots or from hematogenous spread. Diagnosis is made through clinical signs and ocular ultrasonography. Successful treatment is difficult. The abscess cannot be drained through the oral cavity because of the rich vascular plexus lining the rabbit orbit as well as the extremely caseous nature of the contents. Many cases require exenteration and long-term medical therapy with a broad-spectrum antibiotic. True Pasteurella-induced abscesses may respond favorably to parenteral penicillin therapy at a dose of 60,000 IU/kg q24h for several weeks. However, the use of penicillins in rabbits warrants extreme caution because they can cause anaphylaxis or fatal enterocolitis due to alteration of the normal gastrointestinal flora. Even with aggressive surgical and medical therapy, many of these abscesses recur and at times necessitate euthanasia. Less common causes of exophthalmos in rabbits include parasitic cysts, orbital neoplasia, and metastatic thymoma. ",

            "text": "Adnexal disease is uncommon in rabbits, with entropion being the most commonly observed abnormality. Entropion may involve the upper and/or lower eyelids and may be primary or secondary. Primary (congenital) entropion has been described in the New Zealand white and French lop breeds. These breed predispositions suggest an inherited basis, but a mode of inheritance has not been determined. The lower eyelids are most commonly affected in New Zealand white rabbits, whereas the upper eyelids are affected in French lops. Clinical signs associated with primary entropion include epiphora, blepharospasm, conjunctival hyperemia, and, sometimes, ulcerative keratitis (Figure 20 -2). Application of a topical anesthetic such as 1% proparacaine will facilitate ophthalmic examination by alleviating surface ocular pain. It will also remove any spastic component to the entropion, allowing appropriate surgical planning. Correction of entropion with a modified Hotz-Celsus procedure allows restoration of normal anatomic conformation, thereby preventing further ocular irritation. Entropion may occur from cicatrix formation secondary to chronic blepharitis or blepharoconjunctivitis. Before any attempt at surgical correction, the underlying cause must be identified and treated. Otherwise entropion will likely recur. Cicatricial entropion is corrected using a Y-to-V blepharoplasty, with care taken to completely excise the offending fibrotic tissue during the procedure. Infectious blepharitis may result from exposure to Treponema cuniculi, or rabbit syphilis (Figure 20-3) . T. cuniculi is a spirochete bacillus transmitted by infected dams. The most commonly affected areas are the vulva, prepuce, lips, nares, and anus. Clinical signs include thickening, crusting, and, possibly, ulceration of the eyelid. Diagnosis is confirmed through identification of spirochetes in biopsy or skin scraping samples. Darkfield microscopy enhances visualization of the organism. Three doses of parenteral benzathine penicillin G or procaine penicillin G at a dose of 42,000 IU/kg at 7-day intervals is the treatment of choice. Careful monitoring of the patient for potentially fatal enterocolitis is necessary. Blepharitis may also be caused by self-induced trauma or maceration due to ocular discharge secondary to dacryocystitis, conjunctivitis, or keratitis (discussed later).",

Diagnosis is made through biopsy, preferably excisional biopsy, which may be curative in cases of squamous cell carcinoma. If diffuse disease prevents complete excision, adjunctive therapy with b-irradiation or cryotherapy may be used. If these modalities are not available, referral or enucleation is recommended. Fibrosarcoma manifesting in the eyelid may represent extension from the orbit. Careful examination, including globe retropulsion as well as advanced imaging using computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging, may aid in distinguishing the extent of tumor involvement. Orbital involvement carries a guarded prognosis. Exenteration may be palliative and may increase survival time. Melanomas of the eyelid tend to be benign although locally invasive.

The virus is transmitted by an arthropod vector, including both mosquitoes and fleas. Clinical signs are blepharoconjunctivitis with a thick mucopurulent discharge, blepharedema, and edema and nodule formation on the ears, head, body, and limbs. Myxoma virus was formally thought to have 100% mortality, but more recent data suggest that the prognosis varies according to the strain of the virus and species/ breed of rabbit.

Dental disease or osseous changes to the maxillary bone secondary to nutritional hyperparathyroidism may also lead to the development of duct obstruction. Of these, dental disease is alleged to be the most common cause. Malocclusion of the molars and premolars and, less frequently, the incisors results in retropulsion of the tooth and impingement on the nasolacrimal duct. Secondary infection ensues, and a wide range of organisms has been cultured, including Neisseria, Moraxella, Bordetella, Streptococcus viridans, Oligella urethralis, Pasteurella, and Pseudomonas. Clinical signs include epiphora, usually in conjunction with mucopurulent discharge. Secondary conjunctivitis may also be present. Dacryocystitis can be differentiated from primary conjunctivitis by digital pressure on the lacrimal sac. With dacryocystitis, a mucopurulent exudate can usually be expressed from the lacrimal puncta. Diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical signs and a negative fluorescein dye passage test result. A CT scan or plain radiograph of the head, sometimes augmented by dacryocystorhinography, may aid in differentiating the underlying cause and location of duct obstruction. Treatment is first aimed at correcting the underlying abnormality, especially correction of any dental disease (occlusal adjustment). The duct is then flushed with sterile saline through a 23-gauge lacrimal cannula. After flushing with saline, dilute povidone-iodine solution (1:50) is flushed through the duct.

Corneal ulceration is common; it may be associated with trauma, exposure after anesthesia, distichiasis, entropion, and trichiasis and may occur secondary to blepharoconjunctivitis or dacryocystitis. Thorough examination will aid in differentiating the underlying cause. If no conformational abnormality is noted, trauma can be assumed.

Uncomplicated defects are treated symptomatically with a broad-spectrum topical antibiotic, such as chloramphenicol, several times daily. Ulcers that do not heal, have significant stromal loss, or are infected are deemed \"complicated\" and require more intensive therapy. Nonhealing or indolent corneal ulcers are common and should be treated like those in dogs. Aggressive corneal d\u00e9bridement with a cotton-tipped applicator after topical anesthesia is recommended. A grid or multiple superficial punctate keratotomy may also be necessary to promote healing. Cytology and culture and sensitivity testing of infected corneal ulcers are recommended so that appropriate antibiotic therapy can be initiated. When there is significant stromal loss or a descemetocele is present, referral to an ophthalmologist is warranted. Placement of a conjunctival pedicle graft is the treatment of choice, although this procedure is more difficult in rabbits owing to their notably thin cornea (0.36 mm) compared with dogs (0.56 mm). After surgery, antimicrobial therapy is initiated on the basis of cytology and culture results. Reflex uveitis secondary to keratitis likely occurs in rabbits as it does in dogs, and application of atropine may help alleviate ciliary spasm associated with uveitis through cycloplegia.

Evaluation of laboratory New Zealand white rabbits revealed a 4% prevalence of spontaneous cataracts with no difference between males and females. Treatment is necessary only if secondary lens-induced uveitis or visual deficits are present. Removal of the lens via phacoemulsification is the treatment of choice. The procedure is similar to that performed in dogs, although the surgeon must take care upon entering the anterior chamber, because it is shallow and iris prolapse through the incision is more likely. Additionally, meticulous irrigation/aspiration of the peripheral lens cortex is necessary owing to the greater likelihood of lens fiber regrowth.",

This rat strain has been extensively used as a model for retinitis pigmentosa in humans. The most common form of secondary retinal degeneration is phototoxic retinopathy. There are two forms, determined by whether animals are exposed to extremely bright light for short durations or to low-intensity light for long periods. The first type results in damage to both the photoreceptors and retinal pigmented epithelium, and the second type primarily affects the photoreceptors. Factors associated with occurrence of phototoxic retinopathy include location of cage relative to the light source (usually animals in top cages are more severely affected), type of cage top (clear plastic versus metal), duration and intensity of light, age of the animal, and extent of ocular melanosis.

Crows and diurnal raptors have a globose globe, in which the ciliary region protrudes farther from the posterior segment but is still somewhat concave. This shape contributes to high-resolution distance vision. Owls have a tubular globe, in which the concave intermediate zone (ciliary region) is elongated in the anteroposterior axis. The shape of the avian globe is formed and maintained by scleral hyaline cartilage along with 10 to 18 scleral ossicles. The cartilage is located in the posterior sclera, and the ossicles in the ciliary region. In addition to structural rigidity, these bones contribute to accommodation, becoming a buttress for ciliary muscle action on the lens. The globe fits snugly into the bony orbit, which is large, shallow, and incomplete. A thin bony septum separates the two eyes. The six of the extraocular muscles common to mammals are present (four recti, superior and inferior oblique) but are poorly developed, and therefore there is minimal globe movement. The retractor bulbi muscle is not present but rather is replaced by the pyramidalis and quadratus muscles, which are responsible for third eyelid movement.

Topical use of such agents frequently does not provide sufficient mydriasis, although the inherent risk of intracameral injection limits this route. The ciliary muscles are also striated, allowing quick accommodation. Accommodation in the avian eye is accomplished through three mechanisms: change in the corneal curvature, deformation of the lens, and anterior movement of the lens. Three muscles are involved in accommodation. The muscle of Crampton is the most anterior ciliary muscle. It extends from the innermost scleral ossicles to the corneoscleral junction. With contraction, the radius of curvature of the cornea is altered. Br\u00fccke's muscle and M\u00fcller's muscle are posterior to the muscle of Crampton. Contraction of these muscles exerts force on the ciliary processes that are fused to the lens capsule equator. As these muscles act, the lens is squeezed or moved anteriorly to assist in accommodation. Similar to the muscle of Crampton, Br\u00fccke's muscle and M\u00fcller's muscle insert along the scleral ossicles and push against them during contraction. Using these three mechanisms, the avian eye has an accommodation range from 2 to 50 D.",

A remarkable adaptation further increasing visual acuity is the presence of a fovea. Most domestic species are afoveate, and others are monofoveate.

Owls and other auditory hunters may be an exception to this rule and can possibly be rehabilitated and released into the wild. However, some authorities have suggested that changes in facial (and therefore aural symmetry) with altered globe size (buphthalmos or phthisis) or subsequent to enucleation may affect the birds' ability to hunt and survive using auditory cues. In pet birds or birds destined to a life in a rehabilitation facility, enucleation may be necessary if penetrating trauma or severe panophthalmitis is present.

With metaplasia, the orbital glands enlarge and the ducts become plugged with desquamated cells and debris, resulting in the ophthalmic clinical signs of palpebral edema and blepharoconjunctivitis.

Like geckos and ablepharine skinks, snakes possess not eyelids but a clear, transparent spectacle. The spectacle is formed embryologically by fusion of the eyelids. Although it is transparent, there is a vast vascular network within the spectacle that has been demonstrated by microsilicone injection. The spectacle is, in essence, skin and prevents topical medications from reaching the ocular surface. The outermost layer or epidermal aspect of the scales is normally shed through a process called ecdysis. Ecdysis depends on food intake, humidity, air temperature, age, and presence or absence of systemic disease. Just before ecdysis the skin dulls, including the spectacle; at this point the snake is severely visually impaired and may become more aggressive. The outer skin and spectacle should be shed in one complete piece but may not do so, depending on systemic health and husbandry conditions. Snakes do not have a lacrimal gland or third eyelid but do possess a well-developed harderian gland, located posterior to the globe. Oily secretions from the harderian gland bathe the subspectacular space and exit through the lacrimal duct into the mouth, as in lizards.

As in other reptiles and birds, the iridal musculature is striated. Accommodation in the snake is believed to occur via action of a muscle at the root of the iris that presses on an anterior lens pad to alter lens shape.

When it occurs over the eye, the spectacle is retained and forms a cloudy, wrinkled opacification ( Figure 20-14) that obscures vision. Many factors may contribute to dysecdysis, but poor husbandry, specifically insufficient humidity, is the most common cause of retained spectacles. Initial treatment is conservative, involving correction of husbandry issues. Increasing the cage humidity to at least 50% to 60% and ensuring proper hydration may be all that is necessary for dislodgement of the retained epidermal layers. If the condition persists, the snake can be soaked in water or topical acetylcysteine can be applied to help loosen the spectacle. Most times, after the husbandry issues are addressed, the retained spectacle is shed at the next ecdysis. If not, manual removal may be necessary. This procedure usually warrants referral because it must be done with magnification, fine forceps, and extreme caution. If more than just the outer layers of the spectacle are removed, a severe exposure keratitis will ensue, potentially requiring enucleation. Subspectacular abscesses occur when there is an accumulation of purulent debris between the spectacle and cornea within the subspectacular space (Figure 20-15 ). Infection arises within the subspectacular space via three potential routes: penetrating spectacular trauma, ascending infection through the lacrimal duct from the mouth, and hematogenous spread. On examination, anterior bulging of the spectacle is evident. The bulging is caused by a grossly distended subspectacular space filled with caseous purulent debris. Evaluation and treatment for septicemia and stomatitis are necessary, along with ophthalmic treatment; otherwise recurrence is likely. Treatment is surgical and is best performed by an ophthalmologist. After either injectable or inhalant anesthesia is achieved, magnification and Vannas scissors are used to resect a 30-degree spectacular wedge ventrally (Figure 20-16) . Particular care must be taken not to injure the cornea. After partial spectacular resection, the purulent debris is lavaged from the subspectacular space with balanced salt solution. Aerobic, anaerobic, and fungal culture of the debris should be obtained. Pseudomonas spp. have been implicated as the causative agent, although other organisms may be present.

Many Apoda species live underground and have either no or rudimentary eyes. The anuran eye is the most highly developed of the three and has been extensively used in research. The structure of the adnexa depends on the animal's habitat. Larval amphibians and aquatic adults do not have eyelids. Urodelas have well-formed eyelids. Anurans have poorly developed, immobile upper eyelids and a transparent ventral conjunctival fold serving as a \"false third eyelid\" or lower eyelid. The conjunctival fold moves dorsally to cover the cornea when retractor bulbi muscle contraction causes enophthalmos. This contraction not only is important for corneal protection but also serves a vital role in swallowing. With retraction, the globe and associated musculature contact the oropharynx and aid in pushing the prey material into the esophagus. The globe is returned to its normal position by a levator bulbi muscle located posteriorly. The other six typical extraocular muscles are present, but their function is negligible. The tear film is derived from a lacrimal gland, a harderian gland, and superior or inferior (in the case of terrestrial salamanders) eyelid glands. The presence of lacrimal puncta and a nasolacrimal duct varies among species, but these structures are usually absent. The uvea is quite peculiar in amphibians. The iris can be very colorful owing to carotenoid pigments and guanine crystals. A myoepithelial sphincter and dilator muscle is present, although pupil movement is minimal. The shape of the pupillary aperture varies dramatically at rest and with miosis but is circular with mydriasis. The ciliary body is triangular with numerous folds, which may continue to the pupillary margin and result in a nodule. As in elasmobranchs, a protractor lentis muscle is present. Contraction of the muscle moves the lens anteriorly, aiding in accommodation. The lens is large and spherical. Interestingly, some species are capable of regenerating the lens from either the pigmented epithelial cells of the dorsal iris or from the cornea, like tail and limb regeneration after amputation. Examination of the fundus is difficult but when accomplished demonstrates a remarkable vascular preretinal membrane within the vitreous. Urodelas that do not have a vascular preretinal membrane receive all retinal nutrition from the choroid.

            "text": "Only sporadic cases of amphibian ocular disease are reported in the literature and are usually associated with systemic disease. Redleg, one of the most common systemic diseases of Anurans, is a catchall term for infection secondary to gram-negative bacteria including Aeromonas hydrophila and Citrobacter freundii. Redleg septicemia in fire-bellied toads was found to result in diffuse corneal edema, hyphema, hypopyon, iridocyclitis, cataract, chorioretinitis, and, sometimes, periocular blood-filled blisters. Experimentally induced septicemia with Flavobacterium indologenes caused anterior uveitis and secondary corneal edema in leopard frogs. Affected animals usually do not show response to therapy, and morbidity is high. Corneal ulceration infrequently occurs and may progress to bullous keratopathy. Because of the size of the animals, systemic toxicity after topical application of antibiotics is possible. Gentamicin diluted to 2 mg/mL has been effective and reported to be safe. Alternatively, the false third eyelid can be sutured to the upper eyelid to provide protection of the corneal surface.",

It was first reported in Cuban tree frogs and has since been identified in several other species. In hylid, leptodactylid, and ranid species, generalized xanthomatosis occurred, affecting not only the cornea but also brain, some viscera, peripheral nerves, periarticular soft tissues, and digital pads. Ophthalmic signs appear similar to those of corneal arcus, including a circumferentially progressive sparkly or creamy white anterior stromal infiltrate consisting of cholesterol and lipid-laden macrophages. Classically, excessive lipid mobilization associated with oogenesis was suspected as the cause because all affected frogs were female. A later study demonstrated that diet may be responsible, with frogs fed high-cholesterol diets demonstrating corneal lipid deposition independent of gender or stage of vitellogenesis. Nutritional therapy may slow the accumulation of lipid but is rarely curative. If lipid keratopathy is left untreated, diffuse corneal vascularization and superficial melanosis may occur (Figure 20-17) . ",
