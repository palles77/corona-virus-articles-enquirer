Interest of using NDV as an anticancer agent has arisen from its ability to kill tumor cells with limited toxicity to normal cells. Methods: In this investigation, the proliferation of brain tumor cell line, glioblastoma multiform (DBTRG.05MG) induced by NDV strain AF2240 was evaluated in-vitro, by using MTT proliferation assay. Furthermore, Cytological observations were studied using fluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, DNA laddering in agarose gel electrophoresis assay used to detect the mode of cell death and analysis of the cellular DNA content by flowcytometery. Results: MTT proliferation assay, Cytological observations using fluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy show the anti-proliferation effect and apoptogenic features of NDV on DBTRG.05MG. Furthermore, analysis of the cellular DNA content showed that there was a loss of treated cells in all cell cycle phases (G1, S and G2/M) accompanied with increasing in sub-G1 region (apoptosis peak). Conclusion: It could be concluded that NDV strain AF2240 is a potent antitumor agent that induce apoptosis and its cytotoxicity increasing while increasing of time and virus titer.",

            "text": "The treatment of primary brain tumors is difficult because of polyclonicity, the blood brain barrier, the diffuse infiltrative nature of these tumors, and the perilous location of some tumors. So, to cure brain tumors some consideration must be taken to kill all cells within the tumor and spare the remaining normal brain cells. Newcastle disease (ND) is a disease of poultry that affecting the alimentary and respiratory tract as well as the central nervous system, it is caused by Newcastle disease virus (NDV) (Brown and Bevins, 2017) . Exposure to humans, however, results in mild conjunctivitis, laryngitis and influenza-like symptoms (Othman et al., 2010) . Viral therapy for cancer (virotherapy) has significantly been identified to show some promise in cancer therapy. Virotherapy involves the treatment of cancer by using a virus specifically to infect cancer cells while leaving normal cells unharmed . NDV is a promise in clinical trials as an antineoplastic agent. It is one of the nonengineered oncolytic viruses, which has a long history as a broad-spectrum oncolytic agent that can destroy tumor cells and stimulate the immune system (Freeman et al., 2006; Schirrmacher et al., 1998) . Many preclinical studies indicate that NDV replicates in human cancer cells, but not in normal cells, some types of NDV are able to directly kill certain types of cancer cells and NDV-infected cancer cells can cause the immune system to respond in different ways. Interest in the use of NDV as an anticancer agent has arisen from the ability of the virus to selectively kill human tumor cells with limited toxicity to normal cells. Many strains of NDV (73-T, MH68, Italian, Ulester, Rokin, PV701 and HUJ) have been shown to exhibit an oncolytic activity (Omar et al., 2003; Freeman et al., 2006) . In addition, the oncolytic effects of six Malaysian strains of NDV (AF2240, 01/C, Ijuk, S, F, and V4) have also been studied on several tumor cell lines (Omar et al., 2003; Niederhuber, 2006 , Rowa et al., 2017 . The goal of most cancer therapy is to reduce the number of tumor cells and to prevent their further accumulation (decrease the rate of cell proliferation). Therefore, in this study the effects of NDV strain AF2240 on the proliferation and the morphological changes of glioblastoma multiforme brain tumor cell line, (DBTRG.05MG), was tested in vitro.",

Some wells were left with no virus to be used as a control. After the incubation period, the cultured cells were harvested using trypsin and centrifuged for 10 min at 1,000 (rpm) at room temperature. Cell pellets were fixed by adding 500 \u00b5l of 80% cold ethanol and kept for at least 2 h at -20 o C. Cells were pelleted at 1,000 (rpm) for 10 min, and the ethanol was discarded. The cell pellet was washed with 1 ml (PBS/sodium azide) twice. The pellet was resuspended with 1 ml of (PBS + 0.1% triton X-100 +10 mm EDTA + 50 \u00b5g/ml RNase + 2 ug/ml Propidium were used as control.

Whereas inoculation of NDV on cells with the IC 50 values showed that the optical density was lower than inoculation with the IC 25 values. This optical density is in proportion to the number of variable cells. Figures 1 showed that the growth rates decreased in the treated cells as compared with the untreated cells whereas inoculation with a higher titter of virus (IC 50 ) decreased the growth rate more than low titer (IC 25 ). On the other hand, the percentage of non-viable DBTRG.05MG cells treated with IC 25 value of NDV strain AF2240 was 5% (day 1), 16% (day 2) and 38% (day 3).

In several of such cases, the fluorescent bright-green color could be seen in treated cells only. In contrast, untreated cells were observed with a green intact nuclear structure blebbing and nuclear marginations were noticed. Differential scoring of treated DBTRG.05MG cells (200 cells population) showed that there is a statistical significant (P < 0.05) difference in apoptosis positive cells, which indicates clearly that NDV has a time-dependent apoptogenic effect ( Table 1 and Figure 6 ).",

Untreated DBTRG.05MG cells appeared in a normal morphology of viable cells with intact nucleus and clear cytoplasm containing numerous mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum in their regular shapes. DBTRG.05MG cell lines showed ultrastructural changes after being treated with NDV strain AF2240 for 24, 48 and 72 h. Early stage of apoptosis was observed at 24 hours post-inoculation such as, cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation in dense masses under the nuclear membrane and margination along the inner nuclear membrane, and compaction of the cytoplasm with development of vacuoles in the cytoplasm. At 48 hours post-inoculation, the cells broke up into discrete fragments to form apoptotic bodies and nucleus fragmentation was observed. At 24 hours post-inoculation, cytoplasmic organelles such as intact mitochondria can still be observed whereas at 48 hours post-inoculation numerous mitochondria were found in the centre of the apoptotic cells. Membrane blebbing without disintegration Fragmentation of chromosomal DNA is the biological hallmark of apoptosis, and can be detected by a ladder formation on gel electrophoresis. The DNA ladder assay is generally accepted as specific for apoptosis because it detects oligonucleosomal cleavage rather than artificial DNA cleavage or necrosis. The DNA of DBTRG.05MG cells treated for 24, 48 and 72 hours with NDV strain AF2240 were extracted and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Untreated DBTRG.05MG cells contained high-molecular-weight genomic DNA.

Grade IV astrocytoma, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), is the most aggressive form of the primary brain tumors, it is the most common primary brain tumor in adults . The standard treatments include surgery; radiation and chemotherapy are the current treatments for brain tumors (Ali et al., 2011) . For three decades, several papers have shown the effectiveness of the NDV and medical literature documented its anticancer activity and its ability to induce tumor lysis through different mechanisms. Cell death can occur by two distinct processes: apoptosis and necrosis (Muneesh et al., 1995) . Tumor cells under inappropriate conditions continue to proliferate even in the absence of proliferative signals. The goal of most cancer therapy is to reduce the number of tumor cells and to prevent their further accumulation (decrease the rate of cell proliferation). By using MTT cell proliferation assay this study found that the virus was capable to inhibit proliferation of both cell lines. Furthermore, in this study, cell death caused by NDV strain AF2240 infection on brain tumor cell lines occurred through apoptosis was identified from morphological and ultrastructural observations. Morphological assessment has been the most reliable method for the identification of individual apoptotic cells (Shaghayegh et al., 2018) . The morphological features of apoptosis such as cell shrinking, cell membrane blebbing and chromatin condensation were observed by using phase contrast microscopy, fluorescent microscopy (AO/ PI method) and transmission electron microscopy.",

Phase contrast microscopy showed that treatment of DBTRG.05MG and U-87MG cells with NDV strain AF2240 produces fewer adherent cells compared to controls, and a larger proportion of freely floating cells. The cells rounded up, and the cells in culture lost contact with adjacent cells during treatment, and are therefore more likely to be shed from the plate. This occurs during which time any specialized surface structures such as microvilli disappeared and convolutions began to form (Liu and Liu, 2001) . Rounding up of nuclei was one of the morphological changes occurred because of the digesting of the protein structures, which conform the cytoskeleton, by specialized peptidases (known as caspases) that have been activated inside the cell (Liu and Liu, 2001) .",

Intracellular and plasma membrane structural modifications have been widely recognized as crucial factors involved in cell injury and death. Changes in nuclear morphology and in organelle structure as well as specific phenomena at the cell surface, namely surface smoothing and surface blebbing, are often considered as markers associated with cell pathology (Malorni 1998) . TEM analysis could reveal the changes of cell ultrastructure during the apoptotic process (Lin et al., 2004) . By means of TEM the results in this study showed that untreated brain tumor cells showed no changes and exhibited intact nucleus with clear cytoplasm while after brain tumor cell lines treating with NDV strain AF2240 the typical morphological features of apoptotic cells appeared, including chromatin condensation in dense masses under the nuclear membrane, compaction of the cytoplasm, crowding of organelles and surface protuberances. These changes occur within the nucleus during apoptotic death such as the appearance of dense, crescent-shaped chromatin aggregates which line nuclear membrane. Later, the nucleolus disintegrates; nuclear membrane develops deep invaginations and, ultimately, the nucleus fragmented into dense granular particles (apoptotic bodies). It is thought that the nuclear changes are due to activation of endogenous nuclease(s) which cleaves DNA into oligonucleosomal fragments (Oberhammer et al., 1993; Sho et al., 2001) .",

            "text": "In this study, we reported that NDV strain AF2240 did not stimulate DNA fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis in DBTRG.05MG cell line at 24, 48 and 72 hours post-inoculation. The problem with the ladder assay is its low sensitivity. Even with enhancement of the fragmented DNA in the sample, DNA ladder formation is observed only when the extent of oligonucleosomal cleavage is prominent. Internucleosomal cleavage of DNA is likely to be in the later phase of apoptotic process (Lin et al., 2004; Cohen et al., 1992l; Gooch and Yee, 1999) . In most cell types, the biochemical characteristics of apoptotic response include activation of endogenous calcium and magnesium dependent endonucleases, leading to fragmentation of the chromosomal DNA. Initially, the DNA fragments are large (50-300 kb) but are later digested to oligonucleosomal size (multimers of 180-200 bp). The formation of this distinct DNA ladder is considered to be a biochemical hallmark of apoptosis. A study by Oberhammer et al., (1993) stated that cleavage of DNA to 50 kbp internucleosomal fragments instead of degradation into 180-200 bp fragments was observed in several epithelial cell types. This was further confirmed by Grem et al., (1996) which stated that DNA fragmentation in some breast cancer cell lines was not companions by the generation of oligonucleosomal laddering; instead, induction of very high molecular weight DNA fragmentation was observed. Therefore, it was reported that apoptosis can occur fully in the absence of DNA fragmentation.",
