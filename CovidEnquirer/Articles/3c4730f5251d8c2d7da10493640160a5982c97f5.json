Inferior turbinate mucosal tissues were cultured using air-liquid interface methods, on a support of gelfoam soaked in culture media. RV-16 was applied to the mucosal surface and washed off, and histological changes were evaluated. The success of RV infection was assayed by semi-nested RT-PCR of the mucosal surface fluid taken 48 h after incubation. Intracellular RVs were visualized by in situ hybridization (ISH). Secretion of the cytokines, IL-6 and IL-8, into the culture media was quantitated by ELISA. After 7 days of culture, the turbinate mucosae did not show significant damage. A PCR product indicating successful RV infection was detected in 5 out of 10 mucosal tissues. ISH showed a very small number of positively stained cells focally located in the epithelial layer. In the beginning 24 h after infection, secretion of IL-6 and IL-8 into the culture media of infected mucosae was significantly greater than into the media of control mucosae. Our results indicate that the air-liquid interface organ culture of turbinate mucosa could serve as an acceptable in vitro model for studying RV infection.",

Nasal and nasopharyngeal epithelial cells are the primary targets of RV infec-tion. These cells express on their surface the intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 or low density lipoprotein receptor, the sites of RV attachment (Casasnovas and Springer, 1994) . Following attachment of RV to its receptor, the entire virus is translocated across the epithelial cell membrane and uncoated releasing viral RNA into the cytoplasm for replication. RV infection triggers epithelial cell production of cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8, which function as a neutrophil chemoattractants and are responsible for cold symptoms (Zhu et al., 1997) . RV infection has been shown to stimulate the elaboration of other cytokines, including IL-1, TNF-\u2423, RANTES, MIP, and IL-11, which also contribute to the cascade of inflammatory reactions (Terajima et al., 1997; Yuta et al., 1998) .",

In addition, the pathogenic mechanisms by which RV induces sinusitis are not clear (van Cauwenberge and Ingels, 1996) . 0166 To better understand the pathophysiology of RV infection, an ideal experimental model is of critical importance. However, a practical animal model for studying RV infection is not yet available. Therefore, to date, studies of RV infection have mostly been performed by in vivo challenge of volunteers using nasal lavage fluid or infected mucosal tissue (Yuta et al., 1998) and by primary culture of tracheal and bronchial epithelial cells or culture of transformed cell lines (Zhu et al., 1997; Sethi et al., 1997) . However, each of these methods has limitations. The in vivo challenge method is associated with ethical consideration, which precludes certain types of experimental work in humans. Culture of isolated epithelial cells probably reflects only a partial picture of the inflammatory response in mucosae, inasmuch as inflammatory cells, such as mast cells, eosinophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, endothelial cells, and glandular elements, are also involved in the entire RV-induced inflammatory process (Schierhorn et al., 1999) . Furthermore, primary culture of tracheal epithelial cells or cell lines of the lower respiratory tract does not fully reflect the exact physiological changes occurring in the nasal cavity or nasopharynx mucosa, the primary site of RV infection and an area of interest in the pathogenesis of RV-induced sinusitis.",

In this study, in attempting to overcome the limitations of the conventional study methods, the authors sought to develop a new model of RV infection. Since the upper airway, especially the nose, is a major target of RV infection (van Cauwenberge and Ingels, 1996) , it is hypothesized that organ culture models of turbinate mucosae may be physiologically relevant. Here the authors describe the development of an air-interface organ culture system for growing RVs in turbinate mucosae, which are readily available from various nasal surgical procedures. The feasibility of this model was examined by confirmation of RV infection using semi-nested RT-PCR and in situ hybridization (ISH), and by measuring IL-6 and IL-8 secretion as markers of the inflammatory response to RV infection.",

For example, trachea has been cultured in screw-capped tubes incubated in a roller drum (Hamory et al., 1977) , and fragments of epithelium with adherent submucosa have been cultured from nasal polyps, adenoids, and nasal turbinate in plastic dishes (Winther et al., 1990) . The methods used in the previous reports differ from that shown here in that they did use trachea and embryonic tissues, and not use the air-liquid interface method (Hamory et al., 1977; Winther et al., 1990; Higgins et al., 1969; Merigan et al., 1973) . Organs can be cultured by submerging the tissue into the media or by the air-liquid interface method, which better mimics physiologic conditions. The air-liquid interface method can also vary according to the matrix, filter paper or gelfoam, by which culture media is supplied. In the present stud, a gelfoam sponge was used to nourish the basolateral side of the tissue and lift up the tissue surface into the air (Schierhorn et al., 1999) . When the culture media is not changed, the number of cilia, the ciliary beat frequency, and the mitochondria and nuclei remain the same, and regular change of culture media leaves the cells unchanged for about 20 days (Jackson et al., 1996) . In the present study, it was found that the mucosa could be maintained intact for 1 week without any significant epithelial or ciliary damage. Furthermore, since the time in culture never exceeded 4 days, the culture technique we have described should be adequate for future studies.",

Diagnosis of RV infection had traditionally been made by isolating the virus from appropriate specimens after culture. In practice, however, RV culture requires several days and serologic testing is impractical because of the numerous RV serotypes (Greenberg, 2003) . In contrast, RT-PCR assays provide a sensitive and specific method for detecting RV (Greenberg, 2003; Pitkaranta et al., 1997) . When epithelial cells are infected with RV, only a small fraction of cells are infected. In these cells, viral replication takes place, and RVs are released to the cell surface, allowing their detection in the surface fluid of epithelial cells. The ability to detect RV infection using semi-nested RT-PCR in the present study differs from conventional methods of viral identification by viral culture in the fibroblasts. Although viral culture and titration is quantitative for RVs, whereas RT-PCR is not, the latter is more rapid (3 days versus more than 1 week). In addition, cell culture methods, while useful in determining the amount of infectious virus, cannot be used to detect very low levels of infectious virus (Myatt et al., 2003) . Semi-nested RT-PCR, however, is a highly sensitive method for the detection of RV (Myatt et al., 2003) .",

If RVs are not washed off completely, RT-PCR performed after 48 h in culture can give false positive results. The authors confirmed that extensive washing of the cells completely remove RV by conducting semi-nested RT-PCR on the wash fluid. This study also found that only 5 out of 10 tissue samples showed positive RT-PCR results suggestive of successful infection. This failure to replicate in a particular mucosal tissue samples may have been due to the characteristics of RV-16 strain, to prior immunity of the donors of the turbinate, or to a problem in our methodology. During in vivo RV challenge of volunteers, however, not every volunteer is actually infected (Bruce et al., 1990) , for example, one study showed documented RV infection in 75% of the nonallergic subjects (Yuta et al., 1998) . Thus, our finding that only 50% of infected samples were positive by RT-PCR may reflect in vivo conditions. In the present study, in order to exclude the effect of mucosal inflammation in the evaluation of the feasibility of the organ culture model, subjects with allergy, paranasal sinusitis, and VRI were excluded from the enrollment. Thus it remains to be determined by future investigation how allergy or sinusitis affect authors' turbinate culture model for RV study. There is one other concern that should be mentioned for turbinate organ culture model. Recently, RV RNA was identified by ISH in 45% of adenoid tissues of the children subjected to adenoidectomy (Rihkanen et al., 2004) . Accordingly, there is a chance for a preexisting positivity of RV in the turbinate tissue also. In the present study however, RVs were not detected in the uninfected control tissues, thus the preexisting viral infection could be ruled out. No data are available so far on the detection rate of RV on the uninfected human turbinate tissues. However, further studies are required for a proper evaluation of the feasibility of this study model in relation to the preexisting positivity of RV in the turbinate mucosae.",

Finding of RV RNA by ISH but not by RT-PCR in one mucosa is in line with a previous report, showing that ISH was slightly more sensitive than RT-PCR in detecting RV infection of the upper respiratory tract (Pitkaranta et al., 2003) . In the samples positive by ISH, however, only a small fraction of epithelial cells were positive. These cells were focally located, interspersed by long stretches of apparently noninfected epithelium. This finding, that RV infection in the nasal epithelium is focal and involves a very small number of cells, is in agreement with evidence from in vivo studies using virus isolation and from ISH studies on nasal polyp fragments infected ex vivo (Bruce et al., 1990; Arruda et al., 1995) . Because RV does not cause a marked destruction of the epithelial lining, infection has been considered limited to certain areas in the nasal epithelium (Pitkaranta et al., 2003) .",

The amount of IL-6 and IL-8 secreted has been used as an important parameter of RV-induced pathology (Yuta et al., 1998) . IL-8 is of particular interest because its levels increase rapidly and it parallels the time course of nasal symptoms (Gern and Busse, 1999) . Thus, finding of the increased secretion of IL-6 and IL-8 suggests that this organ culture model is suitable for studying the outcomes of RV infection. The 24 h time lag is in agreement with an in vivo study showing that cytokine secretion is increased from the second day of infection (Yuta et al., 1998) .",
