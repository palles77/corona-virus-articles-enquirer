The manner in which multiple pathogens interact is not always straightforward, however. Bordetella bronchiseptica and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) are respiratory pathogens of pigs whose relatives, B. pertussis and the SARS virus, cause respiratory disease in humans. In an initial experiment, the effect of coinfection of PRCV and B. bronchiseptica was examined in thirty, 4week-old pigs (10 pigs/group) that were infected with either PRCV or B. bronchiseptica, or both PRCV and B. bronchiseptica. An additional 10 pigs served as sham infected controls. Five pigs from each group were euthanized at 4 and 10 days postinfection. Gross and histopathological lung lesions were more severe in the coinfected group as compared to the groups infected with B. bronchiseptica or PRCV alone. In order to investigate the potential role of proinflammatory cytokines in disease severity after coinfection, a second experiment was performed to examine cytokine transcription in alveolar macrophages from single and dually infected pigs. A total of 48 pigs were divided equally into groups as above, but 4 pigs from each group were euthanized at 1, 4 and 10 days post-infection. Coinfected pigs showed a greater and more sustained transcription of proinflammatory cytokines, especially IL-6 and MCP-1, than pigs infected with either PRCV or B. bronchiseptica alone.",

Porcine respiratory coronavirus is a naturally occurring deletion mutant of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGE), an enteric coronavirus of swine (Rasschaert et al., 1990; Britton et al., 1991; Wesley et al., 1991) . A deletion in the spike gene of TGE has altered the tropism of PRCV from primarily enteric to primarily respiratory in nature. Although experimentally PRCV has been shown to cause bronchointersitial pneumonia, the clinical relevance of this virus has been debated, since many farms seroconvert without overt clinical signs of disease. What role, if any, PRCV plays in multifactorial respiratory disease is still being investigated. Prior work has shown that exposure to PRCV decreases replication of SIV, in vivo, and mixed results have been reported with coinfections of PRCV and PRRSV (Van Reeth and Pensaert, 1994; . However, experimental exposure of pigs to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) following PRCV infection led to more severe respiratory disease and increased tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin (IL)-1 levels than exposure to either LPS or PRCValone . Thus, infection with PRCV and gramnegative bacteria may result in a more severe disease.",

Proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNFalpha, IL-1 and IL-6, as well as the chemokines IL-8 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) are often produced after recognition of pathogen associated molecular patterns for early host protection and recruitment of effector cells. Exposure to multiple infectious agents may result in distinct cytokine patterns and thus alter the severity of disease compared to that observed during infection with individual agents. In this report we determine whether coinfection with PRCV and B. bronchiseptica leads to increased severity of respiratory disease, and if so, whether or not the local proinflammatory cytokine response helps to elucidate the mechanism of this interaction. The data reported here demonstrates that coinfection results in a proinflammatory response that is different from each individual infection, and this proinflammatory response likely contributes to the differences in disease pathology observed during infection with PRCV and B. bronchiseptica.",

Microscopic lesions of the lung of pigs infected with PRCV alone typically consisted of multifocal areas of moderate to severe interstitial thickening of alveoli with mononuclear cells and lymphocytic perivascular and peribronchiolar infiltrates.

Typical microscopic lesions of the lung of pigs infected with both PRCV and B. bronchiseptica consisted of multifocal areas of moderate to severe interstitial thickening of the alveoli with mononuclear cells, lymphocytic perivascular and peribronchiolar cuffing, intra-alveolar epithelial cell necrosis with type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, and syncycial cell formation.

Fig. 3 summarizes changes in mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines of infected pigs relative to sham treated. In general, pigs challenged with B. bronchiseptica alone had increased mRNA levels of all the proinflammatory cytokines genes measured (TNF-alpha, IL-6, MCP-1, IL-8 and IL-1beta) at day 1 post-infection, with the majority of pigs responding with 4-fold or greater increases in transcript. B. bronchiseptica was not isolated from the lung of any of these pigs nor did any of the pigs have lesions either macroscopically or microscopically.

Fifty percent or more of the pigs had a greater than 2-fold reduction in transcript detected for IL-6, MCP-1, IL-8 and IL-1beta. The cytokine mRNA levels in B. bronchiseptica infected pigs were essentially equal to sham infected pigs by 10 days post-infection with one exception.

The one pig that had increased MCP-1 transcript levels (13-fold) in this group at this time was the pig with the microscopic lesions described above on day 1. This trend continued in the pigs infected with PRCV alone, as mRNA levels of IL-6, MCP-1, IL-8 and IL-1beta were at or below the levels measured in sham treated animals on day 4. MCP-1 mRNA levels in PRCV infected pigs showed marked elevation on day 10 post-infection with an average 12-fold increase. The level of MCP-1 was negatively correlated (R = \u00c00.904) with the percentage of lung macroscopically affected with lesions. Three of the pigs at this time point had increases in MCP-1 transcript of 12-to 20-fold and had gross lesions affecting 0-3% of their lung, while the pig with 14% affected lung had no increase in MCP-1 transcript compared to sham treated pigs. TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-1beta mRNA levels remained at levels observed in control animals in this group 10 days post-infection. Cytokine changes observed on day 1 post-infection in coinfected pigs were similar to those observed in pigs infected with B. bronchiseptica alone. Coinfected pigs exhibited at least a 2-fold increase in mRNA levels of TNF-alpha and IL-8, a 5-fold increase of IL-6 and IL-1beta, and nearly 15-fold increase of MCP-1. Although the increase in mRNA levels were similar to that of pigs infected with B. bronchiseptica alone, the mRNA levels of TNF-alpha, IL-8, IL-6 and IL-1beta were significantly greater in coinfected pigs when compared to PRCV infected pigs. While none of the AM collected from pigs receiving PRCV or B. bronchiseptica alone showed an increase in MCP-1 mRNA levels 4 days post-infection, 3 of the 4 pigs in the coinfected group had a 55-fold or greater increase of MCP-1 mRNA, which made the coinfected group's mRNA levels of this cytokine statistically greater than for either of the single infected groups. These three pigs had the largest percentage of lung affected by macroscopic lesions, more severe microscopic lesions, and both B. bronchiseptica and PRCV were isolated from the lung, while the one pig that did not have an increase in MCP-1 transcript had the fewest lesions and no B. bronchiseptica or PRCV isolated from its lungs. At 10 days post-infection, the majority of coinfected pigs had increased mRNA levels for all the proinflammatory cytokines tested except TNF-alpha, for which all 4 pigs had a greater than 2-fold reduction of mRNA. The coinfected group had significantly less TNF-alpha transcript and significantly more MCP-1 transcript, than the group infected with B. bronchi- septica alone. The coinfected group had close to significantly greater (0.5 p 0.1) IL-6, MCP-1, IL-8 and IL-1beta transcripts, than the group infected with PRCV alone. Overall, at 10 days post-infection more coinfected pigs responded with at least a 2-fold increase of any cytokine compared to pigs infected with a single pathogen. For all timepoints, coinfected pigs exhibited enhanced mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines 60% of the time as compared to 23% for pigs infected with B. bronchiseptica alone and 13% for pigs infected with PRCV alone. With the exception of TNF-alpha at 10 days post-infection, coinfected pigs also had no apparent down regulation of examined cytokines.",

            "text": "Because of its unique role in gas exchange and constant exposure to the environment, the respiratory tract is one of the most common sights for pathogen entry. Although any pathogen by itself may cause disease, it is not uncommon for multiple agents to be involved in respiratory disease. Interactions among multiple pathogens often appear to generate a more severe or chronic outcome than is observed with the individual pathogens by themselves, but little is known about the specific interactions. In both experiments performed in this study, coinfection with PRCV and B. bronchiseptica resulted in a higher percentage of the lung, on average, affected by pneumonia and an increased severity of microscopic lesions of pneumonia as compared to pigs infected with either pathogen by itself. The increased severity of gross and microscopic lesions at day 1 post-infection indicate that lesions developed earlier in coinfected pigs than in pigs infected with either agent alone. In addition, the increased severity of lesions in coinfected pigs at day 10 post-infection, a time when lesions should be resolving, suggests there was also a delay in resolution of the lesions compared to pigs infected with virus or bacteria alone. It is unlikely that lesions observed in coinfected animals were solely an additive effect, since the percentage of lung affected in the coinfected group was greater than the combined effect of the single infected groups. Furthermore, microscopic lesions in coinfected pigs were not just a combination of those induced by PRCV or B. bronchiseptica alone, as new lesions not observed in pigs infected with either pathogen alone were observed.",

These results may help explain the increased severity of lesions seen in coinfected pigs. This was not the case in the first experiment, where the isolation rate was roughly the same for both single and dual infected pigs. However, there were only minor, if any, gross or microscopic lesions that accompanied the isolation of B. bronchiseptica from the pigs infected with bacteria alone in the first experiment. Although isolation of B. bronchiseptica from the turbinates and trachea is common in the age of pig used for these experiments, isolation from the lung in pigs challenged with B. bronchiseptica alone is not typical of prior experiments with this isolate (Brockmeier et al., 2000) .",

Previous studies have indicated that parasitic infections can alter the response to bacterial and viral infections. For example, aerosol exposure to P. multocida in mice with migrating Ascaris suum larvae developed more severe pneumonia than Ascaris free mice (Tjornehoj et al., 1992) , and coinfection with Schistosoma mansoni and vaccinia virus resulted in a decreased antiviral Th1 response and delayed viral clearance in mice (Actor et al., 1993) . A. suum, the probable cause of the lesions seen in the pigs in the first experiment, has also been shown to skew the adaptive immune response to a Th2 type response (Dawson et al., 2005) . Thus, the increased isolation of B. bronchiseptica and PRCV, the appearance of mild microscopic lesions in control pigs, and the increased severity of microscopic lesions in coinfected pigs that were all seen in the first experiment as compared to the second, may be attributed to the resolving ascarid migration that was evident in these pigs. These results illustrate the difficulties in reproducing the effects of experimental combined infections in out bred conventionally raised animals such as pigs.",

In addition, alveolar macrophages can recruit effector cells to the site of infection and act as antigen-presenting cells. As well as pathogen burden, another explanation for the increased disease severity observed in coinfected pigs may be, in part, the result of enhanced proinflammatory cytokine expression in alveolar macrophages. Although cytokines were only examined at the transcriptional level, and enhanced transcription does not assure the cytokines are secreted and functional, an increase in transcription of at least one proinflammatory cytokine was detected in 100% of the coinfected pigs at each of the various time points, whereas only 50% of the pigs from each of the groups infected with a single agent responded. Quantitatively, IL-6 and MCP-1 showed the largest transcriptional changes in coinfected pigs when compared to pigs infected with either agent alone.",

This was likely an acute response to B. bronchiseptica LPS in the inoculum. Little increase in cytokine transcriptional response was noted after day 1 in these pigs. In fact, at day 4 there appeared to be a down regulation of most of the cytokines examined. It is likely that the bacteria were largely cleared from the lungs of these pigs and few, if any, lesions were seen. The one exception was a pig on day 10 that had significant lung lesions affecting an estimated 11% of the lung and had increased TNF-alpha, IL-6, and MCP-1 mRNA. In this regard, at days 4 and 10 post-infection, lesions correlated to increased cytokine responses. Previous research in mice shows that IL-6 and TNF-alpha are induced in bone marrow derived macrophages 24 h after exposure, as well as in lung homogenates 12 h after exposure, to B. bronchiseptica in a toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) dependent manner (Mann et al., 2004a) . Furthermore, this early TNF-alpha response appears vital for limiting the extent of bacterial growth and pneumonia, permitting recovery (Mann et al., 2004b) .",

If anything, there appeared to largely be a down regulation of most of the cytokines examined. These results agree with those of a previous study which found no increase in the bioactive levels of TNF-alpha or IL-1 in the BALF of PRCV infected pigs up to 4 days after infection (Van Reeth et al., 1999) . The results reported here are also similar to a recent report describing responses to SARS coronavirus in humans (Law et al., 2005) . Human dendritic cells responded to SARS coronavirus with low expression of the antiviral cytokines (IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, IFN-gamma and IL-12) and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-alpha), but large increases in CXC chemokines that preferentially act on mononuclear cells (MIP-1a, RANTES, IP-10 and MCP-1). Of these CXC chemokines, induction was strongest for MCP-1 and IP-10. Additionally, MCP-1 was also found to be elevated in SARS patients as well (Huang et al., 2005) . MCP-1 is important for the recruitment and activation of macrophages and has been shown to influence viral load in an influenza model (Dawson et al., 2000) . The increase in MCP-1 in 1 pig at day 1 seemed to be positively correlated with microscopic lesions seen in that pig, while at 10 days post-infection the pig with the largest percentage of lung affected had no increase in MCP-1, and the other 3 pigs all had significant increases in this cytokine and little to no lung lesions. Thus, lesions at 10 days post-infection seemed to be inversely correlated with the level of MCP-1 produced.",

Again, this may largely be due to the response to bacterial LPS. However, unlike the pigs that were challenged with bacteria alone, bacteria were isolated from some of the coinfected pigs and lesions were seen in all of the coinfected pigs as compared to pigs infected with bacteria or virus alone. The coinfected pigs responded with an increase to more cytokines per pig and quantitatively greater, on average, to IL-6 and MCP-1, than did pigs infected with the bacteria alone. This might explain the increase in the severity of lesions observed early in the coinfected pigs compared to the pigs infected with bacteria or virus alone. Whether or not this early cytokine response in coinfected pigs, which was not typical of pigs infected with the virus alone, might have altered the host response to PRCV resulting in the decreased clearance of the virus observed in the second experiment, warrants further investigation.",

A previously proposed hypothesis suggested that proinflammatory cytokines, particularly TNFalpha, produced during exposure to PRCV and bacterial LPS might be responsible for more severe clinical respiratory signs in pigs . Although the results reported here do not point specifically to TNF-alpha, the lung lesions in coinfected pigs support this hypothesis. In another study, exposing human macrophages to SARS coronavirus and subsequent suboptimal LPS led to a dramatic increase in IL-6 over what was observed with cells exposed to either virus or LPS alone (Tseng et al., 2005) .

The host has evolved specific mechanisms to deal with diverse classes of pathogens in order to induce the most effective response. In addition to the innate mechanisms, such as epithelial barriers, muco-ciliary clearance, and antimicrobial substances, that are ubiquitously and constitutively present, innate responses induced through TLR receptors, which recognize conserved molecular patterns present in microorganisms, can stimulate specific responses to different pathogens. For example, neutrophils usually dominate the initial inflammatory infiltrate subsequent to bacterial infections, while viral infection is often characterized by primarily mononuclear infiltration. In this study, the cytokine response in coinfected pigs was unique compared to the cytokine response in pigs infected with either agent by itself, suggesting that the alteration in the innate response, which has developed over time to deal with these pathogens, may be one mechanism through which coinfection alters the disease outcome.",
