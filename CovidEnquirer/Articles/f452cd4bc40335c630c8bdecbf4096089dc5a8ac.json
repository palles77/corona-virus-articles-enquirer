In one herd other pathogens were not identified as frequent causes of the scour, but in two herds infection with Coronavirus or rotavirus were common (Woode and Bridger, 1978) . The authors consider that infections with these agents are probably common, as it is not necessary to search diligently for infected herds, once diagnostic methods have been developed. From a survey of calf diarrhea in southern England 6 of 18 outbreaks were associated with calicivirus-like agents . However, the calicivirus-like agent infections of calves have been reported only from one group in England and this may be the result of the difficulty of identifying the viruses in fecal samples by routine examination . Recently a caliciviruslike agent has been identified with calf diarrhea in the USA (G.N. Woode, unpublished data, 1983) . A calicivirus (Tillamook strain) was isolated from calves with respiratory disease; this virus caused vesicular lesions in experimentally infected pigs. Although this virus was not neutralized by 18 calicivirus typing antisera, it has the typical morphology and is probably a member of the vesicular exanthema group of swine viruses (Smith et al., 1983) .",

Calves less than 8 days of age develop mild diarrhea characterized by a change in color of the feces (yellow) and some softening. Calves aged more than 16 days may develop profuse yellow diarrhea and some calves excrete fresh blood. Anorexia may persist for 1-2 days. There is considerable variability between calves in the severity of diarrhea, anorexia, watery nature of the stools and fecal output. Dry matter content is a poor indicator of disease severity and may vary from 5 to 30%. When anorexia is more severe, diarrhea and fecal output is reduced. There may be virus strain differences in virulence for gnotobiotic calves. In general, virus particles are detectable in the feces a few hours before diarrhea commences, or their presence coincides with the onset of diarrhea and may be detectable for a further 1-4 days. Usually few particles are excreted and they can be difficult to find (Woode and Bridger, 1978; Hall et al., 1982 Hall et al., , 1984 Bridger et al., 1984) . D-xylose absorption is a good measure of the clinical effect of infection and may be reduced by as much as 100% 1 h after feeding (Woode and Bridger, 1978) but can show variability amongst individual calves with reductions ranging from 43 to 96% (calicivirus SVR-1) or 18 to 32% (calicivirus SRV-2) of preinfection levels .",
