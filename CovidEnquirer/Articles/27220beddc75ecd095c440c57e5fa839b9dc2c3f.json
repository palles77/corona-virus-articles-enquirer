Over 60 coronaviruses (CoVs) have been isolated from bats (BtCoV) and most of these are in the genus betacoronavirus. Bats serve as large (and highly mobile) CoV reservoirs; many bat species have their own unique BtCoV, suggesting a very long history of coevolution. Until 2002 CoVs were considered only minor pathogens of humans. However an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that began in 2002 was linked to infection with a new CoV (SARS-CoV). The outbreak increased interest in CoV replication, distribution, evolution, transmission, and pathogenesis. In 2014 another coronavirus (distinct from SARS-CoV) was isolated in connection with an outbreak of severe respiratory disease in the Middle East. This virus, called Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), continues to cause sporadic cases of severe respiratory illness.",

Among these is nsp12, the large 930 amino acid RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Nsp12 forms a multiprotein complex with other CoV nsps. CoV nsps are synthesized as long precursor polypeptides, cleaved by virally encoded proteases (Fig. 17.3) . The REP1a polyprotein is cleaved to produce 11 smaller products (nsp1\u00c0nsp11; listed in Table 17 .1).

It is cleaved only after attachment and endocytosis. There are two critical cleavage events that precede (and are required for) 154 17. FAMILY CORONAVIRIDAE VIRUSES fusion. One cleavage is at the S1/S2 boundary and the other is a cleavage within S2 (S2 0 ). Evidence supports cleavage at the S1/S2 boundary by cathepsin L; however, if one exposes HCoV-SARS to extracellular proteases (such as trypsin or elastase) in cell cultures, infection is greatly enhanced, suggesting that the endosomal proteases are not highly efficient. This may be relevant to HCoV-SARS-infection and pathogenesis: In the human respiratory tract, a transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) is expressed in pneumocytes and binds to ACE2 (the receptor for HCoV-SARS). The interaction between ACE2 and TMPRSS2 would conveniently put uncleaved S in close proximity to a host cell protease upon initial binding.",

            "text": "In vitro, the CoV RdRp requires a primer, specifically a short RNA oligonucleotide. It so happens that the CoVs encode two different proteins with RdRp activity. The nsp8 gene product is thought to be a primase capable of synthesizing short oligonucleotides. Nsp12 is the elongating polymerase. Other viral nsps in the replication\u00c0transcription complex are involved in cap synthesis (Table 17 .1). CoVs also encode two ribonucleases. NendoU (nsp15) is a Nidovirales endonuclease that cleaves both singleand double-stranded RNA, cutting downstream of uridylate residues. ExoN (nsp14) is a 3 0 \u00c05 0 exonuclease. CoVs with mutations in ExoN have an enhanced mutation rate suggesting a role for ExoN in proofreading during RNA synthesis. Quite an unexpected finding for an RNA virus! In addition to genome-length RNA, a set of subgenomic (sg) mRNAs is found in the infected cell. The sg mRNAs are used for the expression of the structural and accessory proteins. All are capped and polyadenylated and they share a common 3 0 -end forming a so-called \"nested set\" of mRNAs. A closer look at the sg mRNAs reveals that each contains an identical leader sequence of 70\u00c0100 nt at the 5 0 -end. The leader sequences found on all sg mRNAs are identical; however, this sequence is found only once in the genome, near the 5 0 -end. Leader sequences are fused to downstream sequences (sometimes called the body RNAs) at short, 8\u00c09 nt motifs called the transcription regulating sequence (TRS). A TRS is found upstream of the ORFs-encoding structural proteins (these are called TRS body or TRS-B). A TRS is also present just downstream of the leader sequence in the 5 0 UTR. These findings provide clues to the unique strategy used for CoV mRNA synthesis: CoV sg mRNAs are generated by a process of discontinuous transcription illustrated (simplified) in Fig. 17 .5. Discontinuous transcription very likely contributes to the high level of CoV genome recombination (Box 17.5). This type of RNA virus genome recombination is called a copy-choice mechanism (Fig. 17.6) .",

This finding suggests that recombinants are more likely to occur during synthesis of negative strands. If the replicase\u00c0transcriptase complex must dissociate/reassociate with template to generate subgenomic cRNAs, it follows that the same process sometimes occurs during synthesis of genome-length cRNA. Studies in the MHV experimental system show that genome recombination is relatively common event. Examination of feline and canine CoVs (CCoVs) provide real world examples of this phenomenon. FeCoVs are common in cats and usually cause mild enteric illness. On occasion enteric FeCoVs mutate within an infected cat and gain the ability to infect macrophages, an event which is accompanied by production of severe systemic disease called FIP. However, among cats with FIP, some researchers found a few \"novel\" viruses. Sequencing these novel viruses revealed that they contained genes from both feline and CCoVs. As CCoV is a relatively common dog virus (and it is common to have both cats and dogs in a household), it was hypothesized that the novel FIP-associated virus arose in cats that became infected with both FeCoV and CCoV; in the coinfected cats, macrophage-infecting recombinants emerged, causing the clinical disease, FIP (Terada et al., 2014) . The FIPassociated recombinant viruses do not appear to be transmissible from one cat to another. ",

Mutation occurs independently within each cat, with every FIP biotype virus having unique genetic features.

After changing cell tropism, the virus continues to mutate, becoming better adapted to peritoneal macrophages. This occurs despite preexisting host immune responses. Early signs of FIP are nonspecific and include anorexia, weight loss, inactivity, and dehydration. FIP can occur in any age cat, but cats less than 1 year of age or greater than 10 years of age are more susceptible. Constant virus replication in macrophages leads to B-cell activation and production of nonprotective (nonneutralizing) antibodies. In fact, immune complexes are damaging as they activate the complement system and lead to immune-mediated vasculitis. The classic lesions associated with the severest form of FIP are aggregates of macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes that form in very small veins.
