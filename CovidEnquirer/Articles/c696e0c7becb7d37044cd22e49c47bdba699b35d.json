Congenital infection with PCV2 produced a longer clinical course and more severe histopathological lesions in pigs infected post-natally with PEDV. Coinfection with PEDV and PCV2 resulted in more severe lesions compared to animals infected with either PEDV or PCV2 alone. Thus a possible explanation for the difference between the dually and singularly infected pigs in terms of lesions could be the effect of PCV2. Our results indicate that PCV2 infection potentiates PEDV-induced disease and lesions and clearly this may be important with respect to the control of enteric disease.",

In the former, PCV2 infection is linked to reproductive failure and perhaps even a subclinical infection (West et al., 1999; O\u00d5Connor et al., 2001) . Pre-natal subclinical infection is most frequently asymptomatic as shown in this study. However, prior transplacental subclinical infection of piglets with PCV2 affects the severity of enteric disease when the pigs were challenged three days later with PEDV. In field observations, severe, prolonged and recurrent diarrhoea was reported for preweaning pigs infected with PEDV. The severe diarrhoea in piglets naturally infected with PEDV in the field was similar to the finding in our study. Numbers of PEDV-positive cells in intestinal tissues were significantly increased in PEDV-infected piglets from PCV2-infected sows in early infection compared to piglets from PCV2 negative sows. In contrast, the number of PEDV-positive cells was significantly decreased in PEDV-infected piglets from PCV2-infected sows in late infection compared to piglets from PCV2 negative sows. There was villous atrophy and fusion of the enterocytes in which PEDV was shown to be replicating, indicating a direct pathogenic effect of the virus. As a result, PEDV replicated rapidly, destroying the villous enterocytes within 24 h of the initial infection. These changes decrease the intestinal surface and thereby limit number of available cells for replication of PEDV. Thus, after destroying the villous enterocytes, levels of PEDV in intestinal tissues were significantly decreased in later stages of the infection.",
