In the present study, a truncated form of nsp10, termed nsp10a, was found in PRRSV-infected cells and the production of nsp10a was strain-specific. Mass spectrometric analysis and deletion mutagenesis indicated that nsp10a may be short of about 70 amino acids in the N terminus of nsp10. Further studies by rescuing recombinant viruses showed that the Glu-69 in nsp10 was the key amino acid for nsp10a production. Finally, we demonstrated that nsp10a exerted little influence on the growth kinetics of PRRSV in vitro.",

ORFs 2 to 7 encode the structural proteins GP2, E, GP3, GP4, GP5, M, N and the newly discovered ORF5a protein, respectively (Snijder and Meulenberg 1998; Firth et al. 2011; Johnson et al. 2011) . ORF1a and ORF1b encode the viral replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, which are subsequently processed to 16 non-structural proteins (nsps) by viral proteases Rasc\u00f3n-Castelo et al. 2015) . The expression of ORF1b involved a -1 ribosomal frameshift in the overlapping ORF1a/1b region (den Boon et al. 1991) . ORF1b is composed of nsp9 (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase), nsp10 (helicase), nsp11 (endoribonuclease) and nsp12 (unknown function) (Snijder et al. 2013; Shi et al. 2016) . In particular, nsp9 and nsp10 are believed to be the center components during viral replication and genomic transcription . Our latest studies indicated that nsp9 and nsp10 regions of HP-PRRSV not only affected the replication efficiency of HP-PRRSV in vitro but also contributed to its fatal virulence for piglets .",

In fact, as shown in Fig. 4 -A, nsp9 and nsp10 genes together displayed a synergistic effect for nsp10a production. Although the overall quantities of nsp10 products in RvHJn9n10 group are less than that in RvHJn10 group, the amount of nsp10a in RvHJn9n10 group is more than that in RvHJn10 group (Fig. 4-A) . Therefore, other genes of PRRSV, such as nsp9, although did not determine the production of nsp10a, but might influence the efficiency of nsp10a production. Previous study has shown that nsp9 and nsp10 of HP-PRRSV contributed to its fatal virulence ). In the present study, we demonstrated that the production of nsp10a had little influence on PRRSV replication. Whether nsp10a correlated with viral virulence is unknown.

The conclusion that the amino acid 69-Glu in nsp10 is the key residue determining the production of nsp10a was drawn based on the strains JXwn06 and HB-1/3.9. However, there is a discrepancy of the amino acids that affect the production of nsp10a between the two strains JXwn06 and HB-1/3.9. The change of amino acids at 11, 69 and 296 resulted in a loss of nsp10a production on the backbone of JXwn06, while only the amino acid at 69 in HB-1/3.9 nsp10 could alter the phenotype. A probable explanation for this is that the generation of nsp10a depend on a suitable spatial structure. Maybe the change of 11th and 296th amino acids in JXwn06 nsp10 resulted in the change of spatial structure of nsp10 which blocks the production of nsp10a. Similarly, it is possible that the Gly to Glu change at site 69 in HB-1/3.9 nsp10 produce the suitable spatial structure, which is ready for the production of nsp10a. The conclusion, the amino acid 69-Glu in nsp10 is the key residue determining the production of nsp10a, can be further verified by the result shown in Fig. 1-B . Four out of five vaccine strains have amino acid 69-Glu in nsp10 (Table 2 ) and these four strains generated nsp10a upon infection ( Fig. 1-B) . However, HuN4-F112 strain has a Gly at the site of 69 in nsp10, and it could not produce nsp10a in infected cells (Fig. 1-B and Table 2 ). Another example is the NADC30-like strain CHsx1401, which has a Arg at 69th amino acid in nsp10 (Table 2) , and CHsx1401 infection cannot produce nsp10a (Zhang et al. 2017) . All the tested stains mentioned above belong to North American type and the results support the conclusion that the 69-Glu in nsp10 is the key residue determining the production of nsp10a. Since the anti-nsp10 mAb generated in our laboratory could not recognize the European PRRSV strains, we could not determine whether European PRRSVs can generate nsp10a, such as European strain GZ11-G1 (Zhang et al. 2017) .",

            "text": "The mechanism to generate different forms of PRRSV nsp10 remains unclear. Various mechanisms are employed to generate different forms of proteins, such as leaky scanning, alternative splicing, proteolytic cleavage and translation reinitiation (Liu et al. 1991a, b; Carter and Roizman 1996; Firth et al. 2011) . For example, a novel structural protein in PRRSV termed ORF5a was generated via leaky ribosomal scanning (Firth et al. 2011) . ORF5a is encoded by an alternative ORF which is not in-frame with that of GP5, although they are expressed from the same subgenomic mRNA (sgRNA) (Johnson et al. 2011) . Thus, the amino acid sequences of ORF5a and GP5 have no homology. Another example is the newfound accessory protein NS7a encoded by porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) (Fang et al. 2017) . NS7a is encoded by a separate sgRNA with a non-canonical transcription regulatory sequence (TRS). The separate sgRNA encoding NS7a is identical to the 3\u00b4 end of the sgRNA encoding NS7, which is generated by splicing the TRS and coding region of NS7. The earlier study showed that PRRSV nsp2 existed as several isoforms with apparently different C termini in virusinfected MARC-145 cells. Those different nsp2 isoforms were likely processed under proteolytic cleavage occurred cotranslationally or via -1 and -2 ribosomal frameshifting (Han et al. 2010; Fang et al. 2012) .",

There are two possible explanations for nsp10a production, proteolytic cleavage or degradation of nsp10. According to the amount of nsp10a vs. that of the full-length nsp10 at different time points post-infection, it seemed that the increase of nsp10a was negatively correlated with the decrease of nsp10 (Fig. 2-B) . We propose that nsp10a may be generated through the proteolytic cleavage of the full-length nsp10. To test if the viral proteases, like nsp4, nsp2, nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2, could cleave nsp10, they were co-expressed with JXwn06 nsp10 alone or in combination in HEK-293FT cells. However, the Western blotting results showed that all these viral proteases could not cleavage nsp10 (data not shown). We also established a stable MARC-145 cell line that expresses a double tagged nsp10, HA-nsp10-Flag. The recombinant protein HA-nsp10-Flag was not cleaved whether the nsp10-expressing cell line was infected with JXwn06 or not (data not shown).",

The integrity of nsp10 is essential for its helicase properties and this was in line with the previous studies of Arterivirus nsp10, which showed that the ZBD was required for its helicase activity and involved in genome replication (Seybert et al. 2000 (Seybert et al. , 2005 .

In EAV, the N-terminus 82 amino acids of nsp10 is the ZBD (Bautista et al. 2002) . Accordingly, the N-terminus 64 amino acids in PRRSV nsp10 is the ZBD (http://www. uniprot.org/uniprot/I6XH19). Nsp10a was a truncation of nsp10. The structural deficiency of nsp10a would affect or even block helicase activity. Thus, we inferred that the generation of nsp10a might be unfavorable for PRRSV replication. However, the results showed that the production of nsp10a exerted little influence on the replication of PRRSV in cell culture. It is possible that inactivation of helicase function is instead favorable at later stages of infection, when active RNA replication should be replaced by active packaging and virus egress. Since the tests in the present study were conducted for only 72 hpi, experiments with longer duration are needed to further confirm the speculation both in vitro and in vivo.",
