We have used recombinant N protein expressed in insect cells to generate 17 mAbs directed against this protein. We selected five mAbs that could be used in various diagnostic assays, and all of these mAbs recognized linear epitopes. Three IgG 2b mAbs were recognized within the N-terminus of N protein, whereas the epitope of two IgG 1 mAbs localized within the C-terminus. These mAbs were found to have significant reactivity with both non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated N proteins, which resulted in high reactivity with native N protein in virus-infected cells; however, they did not show cross-reactivity with human coronavirus. Therefore, these results suggested that these mAbs would be useful in the development of various diagnostic kits and in future studies of SARS-CoV pathology.",

Serological methods, such as immunofluorescence assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), are not adequate for the early diagnosis of SARS, because the median time to seroconversion in SARS patients is 17-20 days after the onset of symptoms . Therefore, the generation of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against SARS-CoV antigens may provide possible diagnostic tools for early diagnosis of SARS, because SARS-CoV can be specifically detected in the respiratory specimens, blood and stool much earlier than antibodies can be used for detection (Lau et al., 2004; Di et al., 2005) .",

Therefore, this protein may serve as one of the immunodominant antigens in the early diagnosis of infection. Furthermore, some researchers have suggested that antibody against the N protein could modulate cytokine responses such as IL 11; non-neutralizing antibodies against N protein were found to protect mice against lethal infection (Nakanaga et al., 1986; Cheng et al., 2005) .

Therefore, there is an intense need for the development of sensitive and specific detection methods for SARS-CoV infection. Many methods have been employed recently for the detection of SARS-CoV infection (Keyaerts et al., 2005; Yamashita et al., 2005; Keightley et al., 2005; Huang et al., 2005) . Of these diagnostic methods, RT-PCR and real time-PCR have been the most widely used. However, these methods possess some general problems, as they are time-consuming and labor-intensive, require sophisticated instruments, and have high rates of false positivity. On Fig. 6 . Cross-reactivity of SARS-N mAbs with human coronavirus antigens. (A) The immunofluorescence assay was performed by using SARS-N mAbs on human coronavirus OC43-infected MRC-5 cells. As a positive control, anti-HCoV was used as the mAb against human coronavirus OC43 N protein, and normal mouse serum was used as the negative control. FM and LM indicate fluorescence and light imagery. None of these mAbs showed cross-reactivity with human coronavirus. (B) Cross-reactivity of SARS-N mAbs was examined by antigen-capture ELISA using human coronavirus OC43 lysates (256 HA unit), BrSARS-N protein (500 ng/well) and PBST buffer with 1% BSA as control. the other hand, laboratory methods detecting viral antigen by mAbs, including antigen-capture ELISA, provide more rapid, less labor-intensive, and more convenient alternatives (Lau et al., 2004; Di et al., 2005) . In this study, we generated five positive clones secreting specific and highly reactive antibodies against SARS-CoV N protein in order to develop diagnostic methods. These mAbs were available for use in detecting SARS-CoV N protein by various diagnostic methods, such as immunoblot assay, immunofluorescence assay and antigen-capture ELISA (Table 3) . We also revealed the availability of these mAbs in the quantification of SARS-N protein by antigen-capture ELISA.",

This sensitivity is consistent with previous studies of sensitivity in other antigen-capture ELISAs (Che et al., 2004; Di et al., 2005) . Therefore, these five mAbs may be employed in the construction of various diagnostic methods for the detection of SARS-CoV and in quantitative analysis of viral antigen and virus titer. The major antigens of SARS-CoV structure proteins are the spike (S) protein and N protein (Lau et al., 2004; Di et al., 2005; Lu et al., 2004 Lu et al., , 2005 . However, recent reports have demonstrated that, because the S protein is expressed at very low levels in vivo and in cultured cells (Zeng et al., 2004; , it is difficult to directly detect the soluble S protein from SARS patients. Thus, the S protein may not be suitable for use as a practical diagnostic antigen. In contrast, the N protein can be detected at significant levels in patient serum, as well as in respiratory tract samples at early stages of SARS-CoV infection (Lau et al., 2004; Di et al., 2005) . These previous reports support that the development of mAbs against SARS-N protein is an adequate approach for the diagnosis of SARS. Therefore, we generated mAbs directed against SARS-CoV N protein and demonstrated that these SARS-N mAbs can successfully detect the N protein in SARS-CoV-infected cells; this is very useful in diagnosing SARS patients.",

Therefore, the mAbs available for developing sensitive diagnostic methods have to recognize the non-phosphorylated protein as well as phosphorylated protein. A previous report suggested that, because of conformational differences between proteins, the mAbs recognizing a protein expressed in insect cells cannot recognize the protein of same cDNA constructs expressed in E. coli (Vapalahti et al., 1996) . Therefore, the SARS-N mAbs obtained in the present study were generated using recombinant SARS-N protein expressed in insect cells; these mAbs may not recognize the N protein expressed in E. coli. However, all of the SARS-N mAbs reacted significantly with the ErSARS-N expressed in E. coli, as well as the phosphorylated form of the BrSARS-N protein. These results demonstrate that these mAbs can effectively detect the non-phosphorylated N protein that exists in host cells during viral replication, as well as the phosphorylated N protein in host cells and viral particles. All of these mAbs could successfully detect native-form N protein in infected cells, as well as in viral particles.

The others were newly identified at the N-terminus, which is shared with an RNA binding domain (aa 17-32 and 135-150; IgG 2b subclass mAbs) that is the minor B cell epitope (He et al., 2004) . Furthermore, all of these SARS-N mAbs were reactive in immunoblotting, which suggests that they recognized linear epitopes in the N protein. A recent report demonstrates that the N protein is easily degraded into various isoforms in the lysates of SARS-CoV-infected cells (Zeng et al., 2004) . We can also suggest, as previously described, that various isoforms existed in SARS-N protein expressed in insect cells and could be detected by immunoblot assay using these mAbs. Therefore, the blend of two mAbs against the different epitopes can be used to detect various fragments from SARS-N protein and enhance the sensitivity of diagnostic tools.",

            "text": "Although the SARS-N protein shares low homology (approximately 20-30%) with N proteins of other HCoVs, a previous report has described that the SARS-N protein has strong crossreactivity with sera against HCoVs (Sun and Meng, 2004) . Hence, anti-sera against SARS-CoV may be cross-reactive with other HCoVs. However, previous reports support the idea that the SARS-N mAbs did not recognize the N proteins of other HCoVs (Che et al., 2004) . Therefore, the issues of cross-reactivity during the detection of SARS-N protein with polyclonal anti-sera can potentially be overcome by the use of a specific mAb against SARS-CoV. In the present study, the SARS-N mAbs did not show cross-reactivity with N proteins of HCoV, as determined by immunofluorescence assay and antigen-capture ELISA. Therefore, all of these SARS-N mAbs will be useful as mAbs for the development of specific diagnostic methods to discriminate SARS-CoV infection from HCoVs infection. SARS-N protein is currently assumed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of SARS, as well as in viral transcription and replication. For example, the N protein can modulate numerous intracellular mechanisms involved in apoptotic signal transduction pathways, cell cycle regulatory pathways and cellular immune response and inflammation (Egloff et al., 2004; Yan et al., 2004 Yan et al., , 2006 Liao et al., 2005; Surjit et al., 2004 Surjit et al., , 2006 Surjit et al., , 2005 Chang et al., 2006) . Furthermore, SARS-N protein is released as a soluble antigen in infected cells, and as high levels of N protein circulating in the blood vessels (Che et al., 2004; Di et al., 2005) . Thus, SARS-N protein in its soluble form may play an important role in extracellular pathogenesis of SARS. However, it is totally unclear which of the intracellular and extracellular mechanisms are involved in viral replication and pathogenesis, and how the intracellular mechanisms are regulated by the N protein. Therefore, these SARS-N mAbs may be extremely useful in providing further insight into the mechanisms of the N protein involved in the pathogenesis of SARS.",

The different fragments of SARS-N were detected with diluted SARS-N mAbs. All five mAbs were reacted with full-length N protein. Three mAbs were reacted with the N-terminus, whereas two mAbs were reacted with the C-terminus.protein. The anti-His tag antibody served as a positive control that was capable of recognizing the N-terminal 6\u00d7 His tag of BrSARS-N protein. As demonstrated in Fig. 1, all SARS-N mAbs and anti-His tag antibody reacted with 48-and 46-kDa isoforms of SARS-N protein. Additionally, anti-His tag antibody and three IgG 2b mAbs (22-05-03, 07-19-11 and 07-19-21) bound with a protein of approximately 22-kDa, whereas two IgG 1 mAbs (21-10-06 and 21-10-11) recognized a fragment of about 25 kDa.
