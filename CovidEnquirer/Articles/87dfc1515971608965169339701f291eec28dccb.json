The characteristic sequence of coughing followed by oral expulsion must be determined from the history or observation. Regurgitation and vomiting typically occur without simultaneous coughing, although regurgitation is often accompanied by tracheitis and aspiration pneumonia. However, a patient that is expectorating may \"gag\" so hard because of pharyngeal/laryngeal irritation that it eventually vomits.",

Gagging is the expulsion of oral or pharyngeal material and may be associated with disorders causing dysphagia (i.e., difficult swallowing) or regurgitation. The relatively minor abdominal contractions associated with gagging are typically different than the vigorous abdominal contractions that classically occur with vomiting. Regurgitation may follow seconds to hours after eating or drinking. Patients may regurgitate white foam (i.e., salivary secretions that have been swallowed) and/or food. Regurgitated food material is undigested and sometimes has a tubular form conforming to the shape of the esophageal lumen. Most clients cannot reliably distinguish undigested from digested food. Regurgitated material that has remained in the esophagus for long time periods can appear \"partially digested\" because it is macerated, odoriferous, and mixed with saliva. If blood is present, it is usually undigested (i.e., bright red), whereas blood originating from the stomach is usually partially digested by gastric acid and has a \"coffee grounds\" appearance readily distinguishing it from the undigested form (unless the patient vomits before the blood can be partially digested).",

Vomiting may cause secondary esophagitis and subsequent regurgitation, or a patient with long-standing esophageal disease may develop another concurrent disorder causing vomiting. It is therefore important to clarify the chronologic order of specific signs. Finally, some patients with signs \"classic\" for regurgitation are vomiting instead. To aid in differentiation, one may attempt to observe the act of expulsion by feeding the patient, although this is very unreliable (\"watched\" regurgitating patients often do not regurgitate). Watching the patient eat occasionally helps if there is obvious pharyngeal dysphagia that suggests oropharyngeal disease. Some patients with pharyngeal dysphagia also have concurrent esophageal dysfunction. Contrast radiographs and/or fluoroscopy of the pharynx and esophagus can usually differentiate vomiting from regurgitation.",

A complete blood count (CBC) may suggest sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or severe blood loss.

Persistent and profuse loss of gastric contents from any cause may produce main purpose of a contrast esophagram is to distinguish esophageal motility abnormalities from anatomic lesions (e.g., obstruction, mass, inflammation, fistula). Some drugs (e.g., xylazine, ketamine) can cause esophageal hypomotility, making the radiographs potentially misleading. Esophagoscopy is insensitive for diagnosing esophageal muscular weakness but sensitive for finding anatomic lesions, differentiating intramural from extramural obstruction, identifying esophagitis, and removing foreign objects. Patients with acquired esophageal weakness should be evaluated for myopathies, neuropathies, and myasthenia gravis (generalized or localized to the esophagus). Occasionally, hypoadrenocorticism, hyperkalemia, lead poisoning, Spirocerca lupi, and selected central nervous system (CNS) disorders (e.g., distemper, hydrocephalus) may be responsible. Generalized or localized myopathies and neuropathies have several causes (e.g., trauma, dermatomyositis, thymoma, botulism, tick paralysis, systemic lupus erythematosus, nutritional factors, toxoplasmosis, trypanosomiasis). Dysautonomia occurs in dogs and cats, causing generalized dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system producing esophageal hypomotility. It is important to detect underlying disorders so that one may treat the cause rather than just the symptoms. It is also wise to evaluate patients with unexpected esophageal foreign objects (e.g., a relatively small bolus of food) for partial obstructions (e.g., subclinical vascular ring anomaly, stricture).",

Vomiting may occur any time after eating or drinking (seconds to hours). A patient may vomit food, water, fresh blood, or mucus that is indistinguishable from regurgitated material. Bile, partially digested blood (i.e., \"coffee grounds\"), or expelled material with a pH of 5 or less strongly suggests vomiting as opposed to regurgitation.

Pancreatitis can occur in any dog, but middle-aged obese female dogs, schnauzers, and Yorkshire terriers seem to be predisposed. Vomiting may or may not be associated with eating, abdominal pain, fasting hyperlipidemia, bloody diarrhea, and, rarely, diffuse subcutaneous fat necrosis. On radiographic examination, a mass or indistinctness due to localized peritonitis may be visible in the cranial right abdominal quadrant. CBC, serum amylase, and serum lipase activities are insensitive and nonspecific; patients with pancreatitis can have almost any result on these tests. Increased ALT and SAP concentrations (as the result of the proximity of the pancreas to the liver and obstruction of the biliary duct) are common but insensitive and nonspecific. Mild to moderate hypocalcemia sometimes occurs. Abdominal ultrasonography can be very specific for canine pancreatitis, but its sensitivity depends upon operator skill and timing (i.e., ultrasound findings can change dramatically in a matter of hours). If a pancreatic mass is discovered during surgery, it must be biopsied; chronic pancreatitis can be grossly indistinguishable from pancreatic neoplasia. The canine immunoreactive pancreatic lipase (spec cPL) (IDEXX, Westbrook, ME) test is the most sensitive test for pancreatitis, but its specificity for clinically important disease is still being determined.

Intestinal lactase deficiency is uncommon, but a lactose-free diet may be tried in selected patients (especially cats). EPI is the principal cause of maldigestion but is rare in cats. Differentiation of EPI from malabsorptive intestinal disease is important. EPI is often overlooked in afflicted dogs or may erroneously be diagnosed in patients without the malady. Clinical trials using pancreatic enzyme preparations are very insensitive and nonspecific. Powdered enzyme is often superior to tablet formulations, and some enzyme preparations are clearly superior to others. Some dogs with EPI also require a low-fat diet, antacid therapy (rare), or treatment for concurrent ARE (common) before the enzyme replacement therapy becomes effective, even when appropriate enzymes are administered. Up to 15% of dogs with EPI never respond to therapy. Too often, failure of empirical enzyme replacement therapy leads to unnecessary tests (i.e., biopsy) because EPI was incorrectly eliminated. No consistent hematologic or serum chemistry profile changes are seen. Undigested fats can often be found in the feces; however, this is inconsistent. The fat absorption test yields many false results. The TLI assay is the standard test for EPI. It is important to note that the TLI tests are species specific. Measurement of fecal proteolytic activity involved. Patients with chronic diarrhea in which clinical disease is not severe are often treated with therapeutic trials before aggressive diagnostics are instituted. The specifics of the therapeutic trials are influenced by whether the patient has large or small bowel disease. Patients should usually have at least three fecal examinations at 48-hour intervals. If these tests are negative, it is still acceptable (depending upon the risk of parasites in the geographic location) to treat empirically for Giardia infection and whipworms before aggressive diagnostics are begun. Giardiasis may be particularly difficult to diagnose (see Fecal Giardia Detection later in this chapter). Adverse food reactions (i.e., allergy, intolerance, fiber deficiency) commonly cause chronic diarrhea. Dietary intolerances are a reaction to a particular substance in the diet, whereas true food allergies are immunologic reactions to specific antigens. Dietary food trials are indicated in suspected cases. There are antibiotic-responsive intestinal diseases that are also treated empirically; however, the specific therapy varies with whether the patient has large or small bowel disease (see next section).

However dogs with diseases causing hyperglobulinemia (e.g., chronic skin disease, rickettsial disease, heartworm disease) and some breeds (e.g., basenji dogs) may have only hypoalbuminemia because the serum globulin concentration is initially increased, and even though much of this fraction is lost into the intestines, the amount remaining in the blood keeps concentrations in the normal range. If red blood cells (RBCs) are also being lost, iron deficiency anemia may occur (see Chapter 3). PLE may be the result of various GI diseases (e.g., hookworms, chronic intussusception, fungal infections, ulcers and erosions), but lymphangiectasia, alimentary lymphosarcoma, ARE, and IBD seemingly are the most common causes in adult dogs. Intestinal lymphangiectasia produces some of the lowest serum albumin concentrations that occur in alimentary disease (e.g., <1.0 g/dl). Hypocholesterolemia is common, and peripheral lymphocyte counts occasionally are decreased. If hepatic insufficiency and loss from the kidneys and skin have been eliminated in a severely hypoalbuminemic patient, PLE becomes the major differential diagnosis by process of elimination. If PLE is suspected in a patient that has another potential explanation for its hypoalbuminemia (e.g., renal protein loss, hepatic insufficiency, severe exudative skin disease), then measuring fecal alpha 1 -protease inhibitor concentrations may clarify whether or not excessive GI protein loss is occurring. Alpha 1 -protease is relatively stable and resistant to GI degradation; consequently, it can be measured in the feces. Intestinal biopsy is usually the definitive test for determining the cause of PLE. Fullthickness biopsy may risk dehiscence if the serum albumin level is less than 1.5 g/dl; serosal patch graft techniques decrease the risk of dehiscence. Gastroduodenoscopyileoscopy plus biopsy is relatively safe and often diagnostic. Occasionally the intestinal lesion is inaccessible via endoscopy. Although not recommended, dietary trial with an ultra-low-fat diet may be substituted for biopsy in patients suspected of having lymphangiectasia. Therapeutic trials with steroids without a definitive diagnosis can be potentially dangerous (especially in dogs) and are not recommended.",

Patients that are not critically ill may first receive carefully designed therapeutic trials. Therapeutic trials may be chosen more rationally with the aid of minimal laboratory data (e.g., biochemical profile, fecal examinations). The two major therapeutic trials are (1) food trials for dietary-responsive diease (i.e., elimination diets) and (2) antibacterial trials for ARE or dysbiosis. ARE (previously called \"small intestinal bacterial overgrowth\" or SIBO; now sometimes called dysbiosis) may exist by itself or coexist with another GI malady. No consistent CBC or serum chemistry profile changes are seen in this syndrome. Fecal culture is not informative, and ultrasound and intestinal biopsy are seldom diagnostic. A barium contrast study very rarely identifies a segmental lesion or partial obstruction responsible for secondary ARE. Quantitated culture of duodenal or proximal jejunal fluid for aerobes and anaerobes is difficult to interpret, because clinically normal dogs may have as many as or more bacteria than clinically affected dogs.

Diagnosis may be confirmed with a history of exposure to certain toxins (Boxes 9-5 and 9-6) or diagnosis of a systemic disease (e.g., hyperadrenocorticism) known to affect the liver. Changes in ALT, SAP, hepatic function tests, and hepatic size, although suggestive of hepatic disease, are not diagnostic of specific entities. This is true even in breeds with predispositions to specific hepatic diseases (e.g., Doberman pinschers, Bedlington terriers). Changes in the SAP or ALT may also be caused by primary nonhepatic disease (e.g., hyperadrenocorticism, IBD, diabetes mellitus, heart failure). A definitive diagnosis usually requires hepatic biopsy. The clinician should first seek to rule out nonhepatic causes of secondary hepatic dysfunction. Hepatic biopsy should be considered in patients with obviously significant hepatic disease, those that do not have obvious nonhepatic causes (e.g., hyperadrenocorticism, right heart failure), and those that have persistent (>1 month) changes in serum ALT consistent with chronic or progressive hepatic disease or abnormal hepatic function tests (see Figure 9 -8). It is not always possible to accurately distinguish primary hepatic from secondary hepatic disease before biopsy; therefore whenever hepatic biopsy is performed via laparotomy or laparoscopy, the rest of the abdomen should be explored and other organs sampled if they might be involved. Fine-needle aspirates with cytology are sometimes useful in detecting diffuse hepatic infiltrative disease and hepatic lipidosis ( Figure  9-9) ; however, fine-needle aspirates (even when guided by ultrasound) often miss infiltrative processes. A negative cytologic finding from a fine-needle aspirate never secondary hepatic disease (i.e., the liver disease is caused by the patient's nonhepatic illness). Primary hepatic disease may be heralded by relatively suggestive signs (e.g., hepatomegaly, microhepatia, icterus, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy) or associated with nonspecific signs (e.g., depression, weight loss, anorexia, vomiting). The latter are common presenting complaints of many diseases, which is why serum biochemistry profiling is indicated in patients with chronic signs or evidence of systemic disease. There are no signs or laboratory abnormalities consistently found in patients with primary hepatic disease. When screening for hepatic disease, one should request at least a CBC, serum ALT, SAP, total bilirubin, albumin, cholesterol, BUN, glucose, urinalysis, and abdominal imaging. Hepatic function tests (i.e., serum bile acids and/or blood ammonia) and ultrasound are often very helpful. Hepatic cytology/biopsy is usually necessary for definitive diagnosis except in patients with portovascular anomalies. Abnormalities in hepatic-specific enzymes may result from primary hepatic disease or hepatic involvement secondary to nonhepatic disease (e.g., glucocorticoid hepatopathy, septicemia, IBD, pancreatitis). After identifying abnormalities in ALT, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), SAP, or gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), one should investigate first for a secondary hepatic disease because these are the most common causes of increased values. In such cases the liver usually has reactive but reversible degenerative changes. Laboratory tests and ultrasound should be used for two main purposes: (1) to identify the presence of hepatic disease and (2) to help determine if hepatic biopsy is indicated.",

Some patients with primary hepatic fibrosis severe enough to cause portal hypertension also have sharp hepatic margins, however.

Very regenerative anemias may suggest that icterus is due to immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA). Reticulocytosis, hemoglobinemia, hemoglobinuria, erythrocytic autoagglutination, spherocytosis, positive Coombs test results, splenomegaly, or hepatomegaly are often present. Chapter 3 includes further discussion of IMHA and other regenerative anemias (e.g., Heinz body, zinc intoxication, Babesia, Cytauxzoonosis, hemotrophic Mycoplasma). Bilirubinuria theoretically should be absent in hemolytic disease but is typically present in IMHA because canine kidneys conjugate bilirubin. The clinician must not be misled by increases in ALT, because severe, acute hemolytic anemia may cause increased ALT (ostensibly caused by acute hepatic hypoxia). Severe hepatic disease (especially acute necrosis) is sometimes accompanied by DIC and subsequent hemolytic anemia. These cases may be difficult to distinguish from IMHA. However, anemia caused by DIC is usually not as regenerative as in IMHA; in addition, the presence of RBC fragments, thrombocytopenia, increased fibrin degradation products (FDP), decreased antithrombin III, prolonged clotting time, and abnormal hepatic function tests usually allow differentiation, as do vomiting, abdominal pain, and encephalopathy when present.",

Increased serum ALT reflects cell membrane damage and leakage; significant AST increases tend to reflect more serious hepatocyte damage because the mitochondria are not damaged as readily as is the cell membrane. AST is, however, present in significant quantities in many other tissues, including muscle and RBCs; therefore increased AST is not as specific for hepatic injury as is increased ALT. Exercise and intramuscular (IM) injections may increase serum AST. The most common causes of increased AST include hepatic disease, muscle disease (inflammation or necrosis), or hemolysis (spontaneous or artifactual). Increased AST is an indication to measure serum ALT to determine whether the increased AST is from the liver (significant increases in both ALT and AST suggest that AST increases are of hepatic origin). One may also periodic monitoring because it may be the first detectable sign of significant hepatic disease. If other abnormalities consistent with hepatic disease are found, the approach is like that in any other patient with hepatic disease. Common causes of serum ALT more than three times normal include hepatic anoxia, poor hepatic perfusion, spontaneous and surgical trauma (e.g., hit by a car, surgery), chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, cholangitis and cholangiohepatitis, acute biliary obstruction, hepatic necrosis as the result of any cause, acute pancreatitis, hepatic neoplasia, sepsis, and certain drugs. Sepsis, especially septicemia and toxemia, may secondarily damage hepatocytes. Abdominal inflammation may do the same. The pancreas is close to the liver, and inflammation in the pancreas may cause mechanical damage to the liver. In Doberman pinschers, Bedlington terriers, dalmatians, West Highland white terriers, and Labrador retrievers, a persistently increased serum ALT suggests chronic hepatitis that might be associated with increased hepatic copper concentrations.",

Not all dogs affected with parvoviral enteritis have diarrhea and fever; some show only anorexia, vomiting, or fever. Theoretically, if coproantibody binds all of the antigen in the feces, a false-negative result may occur. If the test is performed too early in the disease, it may yield negative results. With such dogs, one should repeat the test in 36 to 48 hours. Shedding of viral particles decreases after the first week of disease, and a test performed too late in the disease might yield negative results.

SBAs offer no additional information in icteric patients with hepatic or extrahepatic biliary tract disease. In nonicteric patients suspected of having hepatic disease, SBAs are a good screening test to support further diagnostic evaluations. Not all patients with primary hepatic disease have increased SBA concentrations. The relative increase in SBAs as well as the percent increase from preprandial to postprandial values is not prognostic or diagnostic for a specific disease. Reported fasting SBAs that are greater than 20 \u00b5mol/L or postprandial values greater than 25 \u00b5mol/L suggest primary hepatic disease, microvascular dysplasia, or PSS and dictate further hepatic evaluation and possibly hepatic biopsy. If only fasted SBA values are determined and found to be normal, postprandial measurements are indicated. Most animals with chronic hepatitis, marked hepatic necrosis, cholestasis, and hepatic neoplasia have abnormal values. SBAs are usually not markedly altered by secondary hepatic disease or with glucocorticoid or anticonvulsant therapy. Some animals without histologic evidence of primary hepatic disease will have markedly increased SBAs. It has been suggested that these animals might have undiagnosed hepatic microvascular dysplasia, but that is uncertain.Increased SBAs are possibly the most sensitive biochemical indicator of congenital PSS, but the values will not distinguish between PSS and microvascular dysplasia. Rare dogs with PSS can have normal resting and postprandial SBA concentrations.",

Extra-abdominal diseases If a patient is not in severe pain and the disease is not progressing rapidly, one must differentiate between problems that ultimately necessitate surgery and those that usually do not (e.g., pancreatitis, hepatitis, cholecystitis, upper urinary tract infection, prostatitis, pansteatitis, heavy metal intoxication, Rocky Mountain spotted fever [RMSF] ). Abdominal ultrasonography is useful to examine the liver, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, and prostate, as well as to detect peritoneal fluid. If abdominal fluid is present, abdominocentesis or abdominal lavage with cytologic analysis is indicated. If these procedures are not revealing and the problem continues, exploratory surgery may be necessary. Contrast radiographs are rarely useful because thorough abdominal exploration should diagnose almost anything they reveal; finding an abnormality on contrast radiographs is typically just an indication for surgery. In rare situations the exhibited abdominal pain may be referred from other causes such as pulmonary disease or disk disease.",
