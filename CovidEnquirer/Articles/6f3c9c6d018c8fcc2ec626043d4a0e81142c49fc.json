            "text": "Background: Tobacco-related lung diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), are major causes of lung-related disability and death worldwide. Acute exacerbation of COPD (AE-COPD) is commonly associated with upper and lower respiratory tract viral infections and can result in respiratory failure in those with advanced lung disease. Objective: We sought to determine the mechanism underlying COPD exacerbation and host response to pathogen-derived factors. Methods: Over a 24-month period, we assessed the viral causes for upper and lower respiratory tract infections in patients with COPD (n 5 155) and control subjects (n 5 103). We collected nasal and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and peripheral blood under baseline and exacerbated conditions. We determined the effect of human rhinovirus (HRV) proteinases on T-cell activation in human subjects and mice. Results: HRVs are isolated from nasal and lung fluid from subjects with AE-COPD. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and CD4 T cells from patients with COPD exhibited a T H 1 and T H 2 cell cytokine phenotype during acute infection. HRV-encoded proteinase 2A activated monocyte-derived dendritic cells in vitro and induced strong T H 1 and T H 2 immune responses from CD4 T cells. Intranasal administration of recombinant rhinovirus proteinase 2A in mice resulted in an increase in airway hyperreactivity, lung inflammation, and IL-4 and IFN-g production from CD4 T cells. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that patients with severe COPD show T H 1-and T H 2-biased responses during AE-COPD. HRV-encoded proteinase 2A, like other microbial proteinases, could provide a T H 1-and T H 2-biasing adjuvant factor during upper and lower respiratory tract infection in patients with severe COPD. Alteration of the immune response to secreted viral proteinases might contribute to worsening of dyspnea and respiratory failure in patients with COPD. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2010;125:1369-78.)",

Worldwide, COPD is the 12th most prevalent disease and is estimated to increase to the fifth most prevalent in the next 2 decades. 1,2 Frequent hospital and clinic-based visits for treatment of episodic worsening of shortness of breath accounts for a large proportion of the medical expenditures and portends a poor outcome in patients with COPD. 3 Respiratory tract infections are a leading cause of morbidity, hospitalization, and antibiotic use in patients with chronic lung disease, in particular COPD; however, in the past, the causative agents responsible for respiratory failure remained obscure in 20% to 50% of cases. [4] [5] [6] Most viral infections evoke a strong T H 1 response, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response, or both, which are required for efficient eradication of the organism; however, a number of respiratory viruses, including human rhinoviruses (HRVs), have been associated with comparatively weak T H 1 immunity and more robust T H 2-biased allergic inflammation. 7, 8 T H 1-biased immunity has previously been linked to the immunopathology of COPD and emphysema, but whether respiratory tract viral infections exacerbate T H 1 immunity or evoke an aberrant systemic or lung-specific T H 2 response remains unclear.",

            "text": "A major difficulty in understanding the cause of acute exacerbation of COPD (AE-COPD) is the mechanism or mechanisms by which respiratory failure occurs. Acute worsening in airway obstruction in patients with advanced COPD is clearly linked to an increase in the work of breathing that is reminiscent of AEs of asthma. We and others have shown that the presence of active proteinases in environmentally relevant allergens is critical for the development of the allergic response and for inducing symptoms of airway obstruction in human subjects and in experimental asthma. [9] [10] [11] Indeed, neutralization of proteinases renders allergens inactive because in the absence of proteolytic activity, allergens do not induce requisite lung T H 2 responses. 12 Previously, we demonstrated that dendritic cells (DCs) are activated by allergenic proteinases to induce T H 2 cell differentiation. 13 In this study we investigated whether the host immune response to rhinoviral proteinases could contribute to the immunopathology and disease exacerbation linked to acute viral infection in patients with COPD. We show that HRVs are linked to AE-COPD in persons with advanced lung disease. Moreover, we demonstrate that rhinoviral proteinase 2A, but not proteinase 3C, has potent immunomodulatory activity on human DCs that favors production of T H 1 and T H 2 cytokines from CD4 T cells in the peripheral system. Rhinoviral proteinase 2A further induced allergic disease in mice when administered to the upper respiratory tract. Together, our findings support a mechanism for AE-COPD in which proteinases derived from rhinovirus and potentially other viruses could create an allergic lung immune environment that leads to airway obstruction induced by T H 1 and T H 2 cell-derived cytokines.",

We collected nasal and throat swab samples from our volunteers during initial enrollment and at the time of AE-COPD (see the Methods section for the definition of AE-COPD). Respiratory tract viral infections were identified by using a high-throughput, multiplex-based assay that simultaneously identifies up to 17 respiratory viruses and subtypes (MultiCode-Plx, Eragen Biosciences). A total of 45 illness episodes in a 24-month period (including a few during which the subject was not seen during the acute illness) were identified. We found that, as is consistent with the observations of others and our prior observations, 4 a majority of exacerbations occurred in those with more advanced COPD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease [GOLD] class III-IV; 29 cases) compared with subjects with mild COPD (GOLD class I-II; 10 cases) or no disease (control subjects; 6 cases). Samples from volunteers at baseline (at the time of entry into LES-COPD) did not yield PCR evidence of viral infection. In contrast, 13 (29%) of 45 samples collected during the return visit for AE-COPD were PCR positive for viruses, the majority of which (10/13; 77%) were rhinovirus (see Table E2 available in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). In addition, 3 (37%) of 8 BAL fluid samples from intubated subjects with AE-COPD were positive for respiratory tract viral infection (see Table E2 ).

Spontaneous cytokine release from PBMC-derived CD4 T cells was determined during coculture with autologous antigen-presenting cells under 2 distinct conditions: (1) baseline (free of respiratory symptoms) and (2) during exacerbation episodes. To determine the CD4 T-cell immune response at the time of respiratory tract infection, we compared cytokines at baseline and during upper or lower respiratory tract infection in the control group (no COPD) or exacerbation in the mild-tomoderate (COPD class I-II) and advanced (COPD class III-IV) disease groups, as defined by the revised GOLD criteria. 22 Cultured CD4 T cells at baseline and at the time of upper or lower respiratory tract infection in subjects with no COPD (control subjects) or during AE-COPD in patients with mild-tomoderate COPD (class I-II) showed no significant change in the production of IFN-g and IL-13 (Fig 2, A and B) , whereas IL-10 production was significantly increased at the time of respiratory tract infection in those with mild-to-moderate disease (P 5 .04 ; Fig 2, B) . Despite the lack of detectable IFN-g in the BAL fluid of patients with AE-COPD, PBMC-derived CD4 T cells from those with advanced lung disease (COPD class III-IV) secreted significantly higher amounts of IFN-g and IL-10 when compared with stable conditions (P 5 .04, and P 5 .02, respectively; Fig 2, C) . In agreement with the T H 2 cytokine findings from BAL fluid analyses of patients with AE-COPD, PBMC-derived CD4 T cells during AE-COPD in patients with COPD class III to IV secreted significantly higher amounts of IL-13 when compared with levels seen in the same group during stable periods (Fig 2, C; P 5 .04). We could not detect expression of IL-4 in any of our in vitro coculture conditions, indicating the extremely low concentration of this cytokine under physiological conditions. These findings indicate that 2 T H 2-specific cytokines, namely IL-4 and IL-13, and a T H 1 cytokine (IFN-g) are associated with local and systemic immune responses in patients with advanced COPD who presented with upper or lower respiratory tract infections.",

Therefore to confirm that HRV proteinases 2A and 3C could induce T H 1 immune responses, T H 2 immune responses, or both in vivo, we administered OVA PBS, OVA vehicle, or proteinases and OVA (OVA was used to ensure detection of antigen-specific IgG1, a marker of T H 2 immunity) to mice over a 3-week period by using a well-established model of active proteinase-induced allergic lung disease. 11, 24 Proteinases were delivered intranasally to mimic conditions likely to be present during active HRV upper respiratory tract infection (Fig 5, A) . Compared with OVA or vehicle challenge, intranasal challenge with proteinases 2A and 3C resulted in airway hyperreactivity, as assessed by both an increase in respiratory system resistance in response to multiple acetylcholine doses and a decrease in the PC 200 (Fig 5, B-D, and data not shown) . Rhinovirus proteinase 2A further induced more robust lung inflammation, as assessed by both enhanced eosinophilia and neutrophilia. Whole-lung single-cell analysis with the ELISpot technique also showed predominant spontaneous IL-4 production from mice challenged with rhinovirus proteinase 2A when compared with the other treatment groups (Fig 5, C and D) . Interestingly, despite the more robust T H 2 response to proteinase 2A, the B-cell response, as determined by means of detection of OVA-specific IgG1, was present in mice treated with proteinases 2A and 3C (Fig 5, E) .

By using a well-characterized cohort of former, current, or never smokers with and without advanced lung disease, we have previously shown that AE-COPD occurs in smokers with severe and very severe COPD (FEV 1 <50%) and that HRVs are among the most common viral isolates linked to respiratory tract infection. [25] [26] [27] In this work we show that BAL fluid from subjects with COPD and respiratory failure shows significantly higher concentrations of the T H 1-associated chemokines CXCL10 and CXCL9. However, the unexpected detection of IL-4 (albeit low), the canonical T H 2 cytokine, 28 provided initial evidence that mixed T H 1 and T H 2 responses elicited by viruses might be contributing to the respiratory failure seen in these patients.",

            "text": "HRVs, members of the family Picornaviridae, are among the most common causes of human respiratory tract infections. 29 HRV infection normally occurs by means of direct inoculation of the virus into the ciliated epithelial cells of the upper airway, where binding to host intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (CD54) results in the release of the single-stranded viral RNA genome into the cytoplasm. 27, 29, 30 T H 1 immune responses are well described as an effective host immune response to eradicate viral infection. 31 However, in asthmatic subjects a weak T H 1 immune response and a robust T H 2 immunity to rhinovirus infection has been postulated as a mechanism to exacerbate disease in susceptible asthmatic subjects. 32 Although type 2 immunity has long been linked to allergic diseases and has occasionally been associated with COPD, 33,34 a consistent link between type 2 cytokines and airway obstruction in smokers has been elusive. Moreover, type 1 immune mechanisms are generally required to eradicate intracellular pathogens, such as viruses. Indeed, pre-existing allergic inflammation has the potential to impair requisite viral clearance mechanisms and essentially convert respiratory viruses into self-replicating allergens. 32 Our finding that rhinoviral proteinases could powerfully induce T H 1 and T H 2 inflammation thus provides potentially critical insight into the pathogenesis of both COPD exacerbation and rhinovirus infections. It is interesting to note that although we found an increase in IL-13 production during AE-COPD specifically in subjects with severe and very severe COPD (GOLD class III-IV), we found that IL-10, a cytokine that is generally inhibitory to both T H 1 and T H 2 immune responses, is also upregulated in patients with AE-COPD, irrespective of disease severity. The increase in IL-10 levels during acute inflammation/infection might represent a natural regulatory response to limit T-cell activation after the initial viral infection. Nonetheless, by inducing lower respiratory tract type 2 immune responses, rhinoviral proteinases likely induce a second component of airway obstruction mediated not through loss of lung structural integrity but through the pro-obstructive effects of IL-4, IL-13, or both (ie, airway hyperresponsiveness and airway mucus hypersecretion). 35, 36 Moreover, HRVs likely gain from the immune deviation catalyzed by their proteinases. As in asthma, the type 2 immunity induced by viral proteinases might impair otherwise efficient type 1 immune clearance mechanisms, leading to prolonged infection and enhanced spread of the micro-organism. Although this point is speculative, we propose that accelerated production of proteinase 2A might have evolved as a strategy not to enhance the processing of polyproteins because interference leads to a decrease in viral titer 37 ; however, modulation of the host immune response, which can be maximal at much lower levels of proteinase production, could promote disease dissemination. Although this putative virally adaptive mechanism is of little consequence to hosts with normal respiratory function, it can unfortunately be perilous to those with severe COPD with respiratory compromise.",

Specifically, systemic or topical corticosteroids might suppress production of IL-4 and IL-13, thereby alleviating the airway hyperresponsiveness and mucus hyperproduction that are induced by these cytokines. 35 Although further studies are required, corticosteroids can potentially promote elimination of respiratory viruses by inhibiting the aberrant allergic immune response to secreted viral proteinases.

Nonetheless, our findings further support the contention that proteinases are crucial virulence factors for allergic disease elicited by diverse organisms. 24, 39, 41 Superimposition of allergic inflammation on pre-existing T H 1-based disease might be expected to compound airway obstruction through multiple nonredundant mechanisms, thereby leading to clinical deterioration. In this regard our findings of mixed T H 1 and T H 2 immunity in patients with AE-COPD might indicate the role of host antigenpresenting cells in sensing the viral proteinases that can skew the immune response toward T H 2.
