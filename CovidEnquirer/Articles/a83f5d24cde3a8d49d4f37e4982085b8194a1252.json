While wild-type G forms an oligomer in the RER, ts045 G synthesized at the nonpermissive temperature does not. When the permissive temperature Is reinstated, ts045 G forms an oligomer and moves to the Golgi. The state of oligomerization was determined by chemical cross-linking and by the ability of a microinjected monoclonal antibody specific for the carboxy-terminal five amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail of G to cause patching of G in intracellular membranes. We conclude that formation of an oligomer of G protein, probably a trimer, is necessary for G protein maturation.",

            "text": "The vesicular stomatitis viral glycoprotein, G, like cellsurface glycoproteins, is cotranslationally glycosylated and inserted into the rough endoplasmic reticulum membrane (RER, reviewed by Sabatini et al., 1982; Wickner and Lodish, 1985) . From the RER it is transported first to the Golgi complex (Bergmann et al., 1981; Wehland et a/., 1982) and then to the plasma membrane, where assembly and budding of viral particles occurs (reviewed by Lenard and Compans, 1974; Atkinson, 1978; Lodish et al., 1980) . In the same cell, different membrane and secreted proteins can take very different times for transport to the cell surface; the rate-limiting and distinctive step appears to be transport from the RER to an early (or medial) Golgi compartment (Fitting and Kabat, 1982; Ledford and Davis, 1983; Williams et al., 1985) . Also, many temperature-sensitive mutations of the G protein, as well as in other viral glycoproteins, caused accumulation of the glycoprotein at the nonpermissive temperature in the RER (Knipe et al., 1977; Bergmann et al., 1981; Lodish and Weiss, 1979) . In at least the case of two G mutations, tsO45 and tsL513, this block in maturation is reversible; following a shift down to the permissive temperature, G rapidly leaves the RER and migrates through the Golgi ap-paratus to the cell surface (Bergmann at ai., 1981; . The single mutation in ts045 that blocks maturation is located in the large exoplasmic domain (Galhone and Rose, 1985) .",

Wild-type G forms an oligomer in the RER, while ts045 G synthesized at the nonpermissive temperature does not; when the temperature is lowered, ts045 G forms an oligomer and subsequently moves to the Golgi. While formation of an appropriate quaternary structure may be critical in regulation of intracellular transport, there has been no detailed analysis of the oligomerization of G during its biosynthesis G remains fully soluble in nonionic detergent during maturation (Chatterjee et al., 1984) and therefore a tight association wit tal framework is unlikely. Contradictory results have been obtained on the quaternary organization of G in virions. Dubovi and Wagner (1977) used chemical cross-linking of intact virions to show significant amounts of homooligomers of G as well as heterodimers of G with the viral matrix protein M. Crimmins et al. (1983) reported, on the other hand, that intact G, extracted from virus by octyl-8-o glucoside had the physical properties of a monomer. Also, an aqueous soluble form of 6, obtained by cathepsin D digestion of VSV, formed a monomeric molecule (Crimmins et al., 1983) .",

It is unclear how such altered cytoplasmic domains reduced the rate of transport of G to the cell surface. For example, a specific interaction of that domain with another cytoplasmic component could be blocked, or the formation of a particular quaternary structure of G (i.e., oligomerization) could be obstructed. At least one asn-linked carbohydrate is essential for proper maturation of the G protein (Machamer et al., 1985) , but how or why is not known. It is important to understand the role of the cytoplasmic tail as well as the other segments of the protein for proper folding and also intracellular transport of G.

Microinjection was performed after transferring the infected cells from culture medium at 39.5% directly into Hanks buffered saline kept at O\"C-4\u00b0C. The coverslips with injected cells were transferred back to culture medium at 39.5% immediately after microinjection was completed, usually within less than 10 min. G remained tightly arrested with the RER despite this P-fold shift in temperature (cf. Figures 3a and 3b ). During the subsequent 2 hr incubation at 39.5% and 30 min at 31\u00b0C, divalent P5D4 completely blocked maturation and Aggregation of Intracellular ts045-G by Microinjected Monoclonal Antipeptide Occurs Only at the Permissive Temperature in about 30% of ts045infected cells microinjected with divalent P5D4, patches of aggregated G were observed, but only if the cells were shifted to the permissive temperature for 30-45 min (arrowheads in Figure 1 , Figures 2d-2f, and Figure 3 ). We never observed patching OF aggregation of G when cells infected with ts045-VSV and microinjected with P5D4 were kept at the nonpermissive temperature, where G is retained in the RER (Figures  2a-2~) . Patching of ts045 G also occurred at 31\u00b0C, when rhodamine-coupled P5D4 was microinjected and no further labeling with second antibodies was required (data Verro cells were microinjected at 0% to 4% with P5D4 2 hr after infection (at 395\u00b0C) with ts045-VSV. Recipient cells were shifted for 45 min to 31% 4.5 hr after infection (d, e, and f) or were kept at 39.6X (a, b, and c). Microinjected P5D4 was visualized with rhodamine-coupled second antibodies (a and d), and G was monitored in the same cells after permeabilization with rabbit anti-G and fluorescein-coupled anti-rabbit antibodies (b and e). The same areas were also photographed with Nomarski optics (c and f). Arrowheads indicate patches of aggregated G. Bar = 20 Km. not shown). Similar patches as those induced by P5D4 were also detected in cells microinjected with the polyclonal antibodies aP4 (data not shown). Patching of G was never observed in cells microinjected with Fab fragments of P5D4 or aP4 (data not shown). Patching of G was observed in various VSV-infected tissue culture cells, including Vero cells (Figures l-3), PtKs cells (data not shown), and BHK cells (Arnheiter et al., 1984) and thus, seemed not to be a cell-specific phenomenon. Patching proceeded only when ts045infected cells were shifted to the permissive temperature (Figures 2d-2f) . We feel that, at 39.5%, ts045 G protein is in a monomeric form and becomes oligomeric at 31%. This conclusion is supported by the chemical cross-linking studies (below). gregation of G Occurs in a Late or ost-RER Compartment Double immunolabeling was performed in an attempt to localize the intracellular compartment where patching of G was induced by the microinjected antipeptide antibodies. Only weak staining of G patches could be detected with antibodies reacting with RER Figures 3a-3c) or antidocking protein (provided by M. Hortsch and D. Meyer, EMBL, not shown). Thus patching of G probably occurred in a late or post-RER compartment. Usually there was no overlapping labeling of patches of G with Golgi-specific markers like fluoresceinconjugated wheat germ agglutinin (Figures 3d-3f) or antibodies recognizing galactosyltransferase (Roth and Berger, 1982 ; not shown). Furthermore, no significant transport of G to the Golgi complex seemed to have proceeded in cells microinjected with P5D4 or olP4 (cf. Figure 2 with Figure  3 ). Very little G, visualized by the microinjected antipeptide antibodies, could be detected in the perinuclear area of the Golgi complex (cf. Figure 2d with Figure 2e ). Therefore, patching of G by microinjected P5D4 or aP4 most likely occurred in a late RER or early Goigi compartment, or in between.",

Reaction of such cells with DTSP generated radiolabeled proteins, immunoprecipitated with anti-G antibodies, that migrated on nonreduced SDS-PAGE with apparent molecular weights corresponding to dimers and trimers of G (Figures 4b and 4~ ). The various bands in the region of oligomeric G (G2 and G3, Figures 4b and 4c ) may reflect coupling of G with increasing levels of intramolecular cross-links. By cross-linking infected cells pulse-chased with [3H]mannose, a pattern of oligomers of G was generated that was virtually identical with that obtained by [35S]methionine labeling (Figures 4e and 4f ). Furthermore, when partially purified VSV particles labeled with [35S]methionine were cross-linked, predominantly bands indicative of G dimers, but not trimers, were generated ( Figure 4d ). Analysis of immunoprecipitated cross-linked G on twodimensional SDS-PAGE, nonreduced in the first dimension and under reducing conditions in the second, cleav-ing DTSP-induced cross-links, demonstrated the absence of iabeled proteins other than G in the oligomers (data not shown). Furthermore, when cross-linking was performed on cells metabolically labeled for 15 hr with [s5S]methionine prior to infection with VSV, which then proceeded in the absence of [s%]methionine, material immunoprecipitated with aP4 antibodies did not contain significant amounts of labeled cellular protein (data not shown).",

Importantly, however, the microinjetted monoclonal antibody did induce aggregation of the viral glycoprotein into large patches upon shift-down of ts045infected cells to the permissive temperature (Figures 2d and 2e; Figures 3a and 3d) . Recently, Arnheiter et al. (1984) showed that polyclonal antibodies directed against the 22 carboxy-terminal amino acids of G induced aggregation of G in intracellular membranes. It is not surprising that microinjected polyclonal antibodies could, in situ, lead to an immunoprecipitation reaction, given the right ratio of antibodies to antigen. Aggregation of G induced by microinjected polyclonal antibodies against the cytoplasmic tail of G (aP4) could also have occurred if G had been present exclusively in a monomeric form, since the polyclonal aP4 reacts with several epitopes present in that domain of the transmembrane protein (Kreis, 1986) . By definition, however, divalent monoclonal antibodies, reacting with only one epitope on a protein, can induce patching only if the protein is present in an oligomeric form. Since the epitope recognized by P5D4 was confined to the five very carboxy-terminal amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain of G (Kreis, 1986) oligomerization of G must have occurred during normal maturation. Conversely, the failure of microinjected P5D4 to aggregate ts045 G protein at 39.5% suggests that it is a monomer at this temperature.",

In order to keep membrane topology undisturbed, DTSP was added to intact virusinfected cells. Virtually identical patterns of cross-linked proteins were observed whether DTSP was added to nonpermeabilized or to detergent-extracted cells, Under our reaction conditions we found virtually no cross-linking of G with either viral N-nor M-protein (Figure 4 and Figure  5 ). Dubovi and Wagner (1977) found homo-oligomers of G, as well as hetero-dimers of G with M-protein when they cross-linked purified vesicular stomatitis virions. This difference with our results may be explained by their use of isolated virus and also of a 5-fold higher concentration of DTSP in their cross-linking experiments. We kept the concentration of DTSP low on purpose, since we tried to avoid unspecific coupling reactions (for a critical appraisal of chemical cross-linking, see Ji, 1979) . Obviously, this strategy yielded reduced cross-linking efficiency. Nevertheless, the cross-linking experiments (Figure 4 and Figure 5 ) and the microinjection studies, taken together provide strong evidence for the presence of oligomers of G within the intact host cellos. Crimmins et al. (1983) analyzed the physical properties of G after solubilization of virions with OCtyl-5-D-glUCOside or cathepsin D digestion and found predominantly monomeric G. These results together with ours indicate that the transmembrane and/or cytoplasmic domains are involved in maintaining the quaternary structure of G.",

            "text": "Analysis of genetically engineered mutant membrane proteins has not revealed a strict requirement for an intact cytoplasmic domain for proper transport to the plasma membrane. Considerable deletions can be introduced into the cytoplasmic domains of the LDL receptor, l-i-2Ld transplantation antigen, and Semliki Forest virus glycoprotein E2 without any significant effects upon maturation of these transmembrane proteins (Garoff et al., 1983; Zuniga et al., 1963; Murre et al., 1984; Lehrman et al., 1985) . Analysis of several mutants of the VSV G protein and of the influenza hemagglutinin with altered cytoplasmic tails has shown that this domain may play an important role in the transport lo the plasma membrane (Rose and Bergmann, 1983; Doyle et al., 1985) . Yet, no specific sequence in the cytoplasmic domain appeared to be required for proper transport. These workers did not analyze whether the introduced alterations affected the state of oligomerization of the glyooproteins. An altered prirnary structure within the cytoplasmic tail, for instance, may interfere with close apposition of these domains and result in an inhibition of oligomerization of the membrane proteins. Our hy pothesis that oligomerization is essential for praper transport of G to the plasma membrane is compatible with the properties of these mutant viral membrane proteins, Maturation of other membrane proteins from the RER requires that they fold into oligomers. The MHC H2 and HLA-A heavy chains, for instance, do not exit the RER unless combined with P2-microglobulin (Ploegh et al., 1979; Owen et ai., 1980) . Arnheiter et al. (1984) observed patches of G, induced by microinjected polyclonal antibodies recognizing the 22 carboxy-terminal amino acids of G, in large vacuoles, which they tentatively identified as dilated cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum. We tried in two independent ways to localize the intracellular compartment where patching of G occurred: double labeling immunocytochemistry with RER-and Golgi-specific markers and following with chemical cross-linking the maturation of [3%]methionine pulse-labeled ts045 G. Consistently, we found no patching at 39.5OC, where ts045 G was arrested in the RER. Also, cross-linking with DTSP revealed only low amounts of G oligomers as long as the ts045-infected cells were kept at the nonpermissive temperature ( Figure 5b ). Nor were native, disulfide-linked G dimers observed in (non-crosslinked) tsO45infected ceils at 39.5% ( Figure 5~ ). Thus, we concluded that oligomerization of G did not occur at 39.5%. Gallione and Rose (1985) suggested that reversible denaturation of ts045 G occurs at 39.5%. Partial denaturation might interfere with oligomerization of G, either by restriction of lateral mobility within the membrane bilayer or by inducing a conformational change in its tertiary structure that prevents self-association, Oligomerization of ts045 G into dimers and trimers occurred within 7 min after shifting the host cells to the permissive temperature. At that time, virtually all G was completely sensitive to Endo H. It may, however, already have entered the cis-cisternae of the Golgi complex (Bergmann et al., 1981) . Double labeling of PSDCinduced G patches revealed weak staining with RER-specific antibodies, but showed exclusion of Golgi markers (Figure 3 ). Since we never observed accumulation of G in the perinuclear area where the Golgi complex usually is located, we concluded that G patching and oligomerization must have occurred in a pre-Golgi compartment (cf. also Arnheiter et al., 1984) . Most likely oligomerization occurred within the MER membrane immediately after the shift to 31%. By analogy to BHK cells infected with Semliki Forest virus, where the density of the El glycoprotein in the RER membrane is only 93 molecules per pm* (Quinn et al., 1984) , the density of G molecules in the RER may have been too low to allow patching. Oligomerization and patching of G probably occurred in a compartment located in between RER and Golgi where initial sorting and accumulation of G proceeds (Palade, 1975; Saraste and Kuismanen, 1984; Tooze et al., 1984) . Further experiments, such as double immunolocalization at the electronmicroscopic level of the GP5D4 complex, together with specific intracellular membrane markers, are required to localize more precisely the compartment where oligomerization of G occurs.",

Although not all these microinjected cells exhibited patches of G, submicroscopal aggregation might have occurred that effectively interfered with the delivery of G to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, polyclonal aP4-Fabs blocked transport of G to the cell surface as well, whereas monoclonal PSD4-Fabs had no effect (Kreis, 1986) . Thus aP4-Fabs could bind to a domain on the cytoplasmic tail of G, which is essential for oligomerization. Whether the cytoplasmic domain of G is directly involved in guiding transport of G to the plasma membrane remains an open question. Specific regions located within this domain of the transmembrane protein, however, may be essential for oligomerization and thus for G maturation. Further experiments are required to analyze whether oligomerization of G is sufficient for specific delivery of G from the RER to the plasma membrane.",
