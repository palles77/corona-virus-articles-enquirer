One tool to assess infection control practice in clinical areas is the infection control audit; however, many institutions do not approach this in a systematic fashion. Methods: Key features of the infection control audit were identified by the infection control team and developed into a standardized format for review of clinical areas. The audit incorporates a review of the physical layout, protocols and policies, knowledge of basic infection control principles, and workplace practice review. Results: Over the last 13 years, the infection control unit has completed 17 audits involving 1525 employees. Four-hundred-one staff members have filled out questionnaires that assessed their understanding of standard precautions. A total of 257 recommendations have been made, and 95% of these have been implemented. The majority of recommendations address separation of clean and dirty supplies, hand hygiene compliance, hand hygiene signage, proper use of barriers, and environmental cleaning. Conclusion: The infection control audit is an opportunity to implement changes and to introduce remedial measures in collaboration with various departments and services. A standardized approach to the audit allows benchmarking of practices across the institution and enhances standards of care. (Am J Infect Control 2007;35:271-83.) ",

It is also an ideal time to reinforce and acknowledge those procedures and practices that meet high standards of care.

In many instances, once a problem or deficiency was identified, it was corrected prior to completion of the audit. Large scale improvements resulting directly from the audit process include the introduction of standardized orders for antimicrobial prophylaxis (arising from the first operating room audit in 1996); the addition of alcohol handrub dispensers throughout the institution beginning in 1995 (to address observed lack of hand hygiene stations); the introduction of a template in 1998 to address additional costs associated with enhanced infection control measures in the tendering process for new construction and renovations (a response to physical plant design constraints observed in the audits); and, more specifically, the addition of 102 negative-pressure rooms in the new acute care tower (20% of all beds). Other improvements arising from audit recommendations include use of the hands-free technique for passing sharps (2000); enhanced personal protective equipment and new safety protocols in the autopsy suites (1999); revised protocols for cleaning of dialysis machines; and introduction of syndromic surveillance for gastrointestinal and respiratory infections in the emergency department (2003).",

Unfortunately, most audits involving infection control focus on environmental cleanliness rather than encompassing unit procedures as they apply to the practice of infection prevention. 2 To be truly effective, an audit must consist of a topic, appropriate practice standards, observation and testing against the selected standards, identification of areas for improvement, and subsequent interventions and demonstration of improvement in practice. [3] [4] [5] Following completion of the first 3 infection control audits in the early 1990s, it was apparent that there was a need for a more consistent and organized review process. The audit form had been shared with members of CHICA-Canada and feedback requested, but this was not a formal verification or validation process. 6 Thus, the audit tool has not been verified, and this is an acknowledged limitation. The infection control services have recently been regionalized, and plans are underway to review the audit document, weight the observations, and develop a scoring system. This will address the urgency of a particular action and the risk to the patient and/or staff. Construct validity and interrater reliability will also be assessed as part of this process.",

Although initially the process may seem daunting, the prolonged period of time for the audit is designed to account for the busy schedule of the ICP and the need to incorporate the audit as part of their routine for the next several months. It is similar to planning a calendar of educational sessions, but instead, unit or ward visits are scheduled into the ICP's day. In this staged manner, the audit becomes less intimidating, particularly because the ICPs can incorporate some of the observational tasks as part of their daily rounds. The prolonged period of observation likely more accurately reflects true unit practices compared with a set of observations at a single point in time.",

Good or bad design can affect one's ability to maintain a clean environment, and clinical areas must be designed to facilitate good work habits. Recommendations for changes to the physical environment are consistent with The American Institute of Architects Academy of Architecture for Health guidelines and are used to assist with future renovations. 7 Consultation between facility planning and infection control is now a regular outcome of the audit process. Review of workplace practices is evaluated against existing standards and current facility-specific infection control policies and procedures. The most commonly found deficiencies in the areas reviewed include incorrect storage of clean and dirty supplies, poor compliance with handwashing, incorrect use of barriers, inadequate cleaning of shared equipment, and consumption of food and beverages in the work area. Ways in which deficiencies are addressed include review of work practice with staff, reorganization of service areas to improve infection control compliance, and revision of protocols or procedures. For example, confusion over cleaning of electronic equipment such as oximeters and glucometers led to changes in cleaning protocols and assignment of housekeeping personnel to the task. Identification of poor aseptic technique when accessing multidose lidocaine vials on certain wards led to the immediate withdrawal of this item from unit stock. Documentation of inappropriate mask use and review of exposure risk to airborne disease in our institution led to increased promotion of respirators for high-risk respiratory care and training in their use (prior to severe acute respiratory syndrome). The latter intervention was felt to be a high priority because the region accounted for 38% of all newly diagnosed tuberculosis cases in the province and our institution admitted an average of 64 cases of active respiratory tuberculosis a year. 8 These examples of early successes were a direct outcome of the audit process and may have contributed to the facility's successful infection control management of severe acute respiratory syndrome cases. 9 All of these specific examples were documented as completed on 3-or 6month follow-up to ''close the loop'' between observation, recommendation, and implementation.",

Compliance rates for hand hygiene practices vary from 28% to 60% across all professions. Varying compliance rates and hand hygiene practices are highlighted during the postaudit meetings, and staff are invited to provide feedback and suggestions for improving compliance. This component of the audit allows for the opportunity to compare the practice of other units within the same institution and is excellent material for postaudit education sessions. It is difficult to determine whether the hand hygiene audits and feedback have improved health care worker compliance, partly because of the numerous barriers and facilitators that affect intent to comply with this simple yet effective measure and partly because the intent of the audits was for feedback rather than as independent evaluation of compliance over time.",

The questionnaire has been particularly useful in detecting areas that require further attention. Infection control arranges education sessions to review the correct responses with unit personnel and circulates FAQ sheets for each question following collection of all the survey forms.",

Future plans for the knowledge assessment form include a factor analysis to verify construct validity and revision to allow for further assessment of changes in knowledge over time. This then would allow for more focused intervention with detailed observations and research questions.",
