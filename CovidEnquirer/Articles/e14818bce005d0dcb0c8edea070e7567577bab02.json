The causative agent is an Arterivirus, referred to as PRRS virus (PRRSV). The pathogenic mechanisms of PRRS are poorly understood, but are believed to correlate with the ability of PRRSV to inhibit immune responses of the host. However, precisely how the virus is capable of doing so remains obscure. In this study, we showed that PRRSV infection led to reduced ubiquitination of cellular proteins. Screening all of the 12 nonstructural proteins (Nsps) encoded by PRRSV revealed that, apart from the Nsp2 which contains the deubiqintinating (DUB) ovarian tumor (OTU) domain, Nsp11, which encodes a unique and conserved endoribonuclease (NendoU) throughout the Nidovirus order, also possesses DUB activity. In vivo assay demonstrated that Nsp11 specifically removed lysine 48 (K48)-linked polyubiquitin chains and the conserved sites C112, H144, D173, K180, and Y219 were critical for its DUB activity. Remarkably, DUB activity was responsible for the capacity of Nsp11 to inhibit nuclear factor B (NF-B) activation. Mutations abrogating the DUB activity of Nsp11 toward K48-linked polyubiquitin chains of IB\u2423 nullified the suppressive effect on NF-B. Our data add Nsp11 to the list of DUBs encoded by PRRSV and uncover a novel mechanism by which PRRSV cripples host innate immune responses.",

Not surprisingly, ubiquitination is targeted for manipulation by a wide range of microbial pathogens (Randow and Lehner, 2009 ). In particular, many viruses have evolved elaborate strategies to inhibit or redirect the ubiquitination machinery of the host for their survival (Viswanathan et al., 2010) . For example, human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) prevents antiviral interferon response via Vpr-and Vif-directed, ubiquitin-mediated proteosomal degradation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) (Okumura et al., 2008) ; the papain-like protease (PLpro) domains of many coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV), human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), and mouse hepatitis virus A59 (MHV-A59), have deubiquitinating (DUB) activity that blocks type I interferons (IFNs) induction (Barretto et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2007b; Clementz et al., 2010; Devaraj et al., 2007; Frieman et al., 2009; Lindner et al., 2005; Zheng et al., 2008) ; the leader proteinase (L pro ) of Foot-and-mouth virus (FMDV) acts as a deubiquitinase that cleaves ubiquitin chains from retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), TNF receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6), and TRAF3, thereby inhibiting the activation of type I IFN signaling ; the N-terminal protease (Npro) of bovine viral diarrhea virus interacts with IRF-3 and promotes its polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation through the proteasome (Chen et al., 2007a) ; the latency associated protein ORF73 of murid herpesvirus-4 (MuHV-4) associates with the host ubiquitin-ligase complex to promote poly-ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of p65/RelA, which inhibits the activity of nuclear factor B (NF-B) to facilitate the establishment of MuHV-4 latency (Rodrigues et al., 2009) . Collectively, these previous findings reveal that hijacking of the cellular ubiquitin system is an emerging, central theme around virus replication. In this regard, studying uniquitination events in virus-infected cells holds great promise to unravel important modulators of the intricate relationship between host and pathogen. Not less important, understanding the mechanisms by which viral products interact with the ubiquitin system provides novel insights into viral pathogenesis and informs approaches to antiviral drug development.",

            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a relatively new viral infectious disease of the swine (Rossow, 1998) . It is characterized by severe reproductive failure in sows and respiratory distress in piglets and growing pigs. Since it was first reported in the United States in 1987 and in Europe in 1990, PRRS has devastated the swine industry worldwide, causing tremendous economic losses. As such, PRRS is now considered to be one of the most important diseases in countries with intensive swine industries (Meulenberg, 2000; Murtaugh et al., 2010; Neumann et al., 2005) . The causative agent, PRRS virus (PRRSV), is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus classified within the order Nidovirales, family Arteriviridae, which also includes equine arteritis virus (EAV), murine lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) (Cavanagh, 1997) . At least nine open reading frames (ORFs) have been identified in the PRRSV genome. ORF1a and ORF1b, which are situated in the 5 -proximal three quarters of the genome, encode the viral non-structural proteins (Nsps): Nsp1\u2423, Nsp1\u2424, and Nsp2 to Nsp12. ORF2a, ORF2b, and ORF3 to ORF7 are located at the 3 end of the genome and encode the viral structural proteins GP2, E, GP3, GP4, GP5, M, and N, respectively. Because the Nsps constitute \u223c80% of the PRRSV genome coding capacity, much attention has been garnered in studying the functions and immuno-modulatory roles of PRRSV Nsps (Dokland, 2010) . To date, several Nsps, including Nsp1\u2423/\u2424, Nsp2, Nsp4, and Nsp11 have been reported to have inhibitory effect on activation of the IFN-\u2424 promoter (Beura et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2010; Li et al., 2010; Shi et al., 2011; Song et al., 2010) . More recently, the cysteine protease domain (CP) of PRRSV Nsp2 was identified as a member of the ovarian tumor domain (OTU) family of deubiqintinating (DUB) enzymes. It was shown that the OTU domain of PRRSV Nsp2 antagonizes the induction of type I IFNs by interfering with the NF-B pathway . However, it remains unclear whether other Nsps encoded by PRRSV have DUB activity. In the present study, we screened the 12 Nsps of PRRSV and found both Nsp11 and Nsp2 possess DUB activity. Interestingly, Nsp11 specifically targeted lysine 48 (K48)-linked but not K63-linked ubiquitination chains for cleavage. This attenuated ligand-induced degradation of inhibitor of NF-B alpha (IB\u2423), thereby inhibiting the activation of NF-B. Our data identify Nsp11 as a second DUB encoded by PRRSV and describe a novel mechanism by which PRRSV antagonizes innate immunity of the host.",

Cell lysates were collected at different time points post infection and subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-ubiquitin. As shown in Fig. 1A , while the level of ubiquitinated cellular proteins was steady in mock-infected cells (lanes 1-3), it varied dynamically during the course of PRRSV infection. A decrease in ubiquitination was first observed at 6 h post infection (h.p.i.) (compare lanes 5 vs. 4), reaching a plateau phase between 12 and 36 h.p.i. (lanes 6-8 vs. 4). Although there was a slight rebound at 48 h.p.i. (lane 9), the level of ubiquitinated cellular proteins remained substantially lower than that of mock-infected cells (lane 4). When Marc-145 cells were infected with PRRSV at increasing MOIs, the levels of ubiquitinated cellular proteins were reduced in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B) . Importantly, infection with UV-inactivated PRRSV, which is capable of receptor binding and internalization but not viral gene synthesis, did not alter the cellular level of ubiquitinated protein conjugates (Fig. 1B) . Similar results were observed in PRRSVinfected PK-15-CD163 cells (Fig. 1C) . These data demonstrate that the level of ubiquitinated cellular proteins is reduced in PRRSVinfected cells and that this is a result of active viral replication. Of note, the latter notion was also supported by the Western blot data that measured expression of PRRSV Nsp2 protein at different time points post infection (Fig. 1A) .",

These Nsp constructs were transiently transfected into cells and their expression were verified by Western blot using an anti-HA antibody (data not shown). Subsequently, each of these Nsp constructs was co-transfected with a plasmid encoding Flag-tagged ubiquitin (pcDNA3.1-Flag-Ub) into HEK293 cells (human embryonic kidney epithelial cells) and Western blot was performed to detect the ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. As a negative control, the empty pCAGGS-HA plasmid was used in place of the Nsp-encoding vectors. As shown in Fig. 2A , of the 12 tested Nsps, ectopic expression of Nsp2 or Nsp11 resulted in markedly reduced levels of ubiquitinconjugated proteins. Notably, the effect of Nsp11 appeared to be stronger than that of Nsp2 (compare lanes 13 vs. 5). Since, the DUB activity of Nsp2 had been characterized in previous studies, we focused on Nsp11 in subsequent experiments.",

As shown in Fig. 2C and D, while the accumulation of K48-linked ubiquitinated proteins was reduced by Nsp11 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C) , K63linked Ub moieties were left intact upon Nsp11 coexpression (Fig. 2D) . These data indicate that PRRSV Nsp11 specifically targets K48-linked polyubiquitin chains.",

UCHs, USPs, OTUs and Josephins function as cysteine proteases, whereas JAMMs are zinc dependent metalloproteases. Based on the structure of their catalytic domains, the human DUBs are classified into five subfamilies, most of which are cysteine proteases characterized by a cysteine (Cys, C) active site located within the amino terminus (Nijman et al., 2005; Wilkinson et al., 1995) . To identify the potential cysteine catalytic site for Nsp11 DUB activity, the amino acid sequences of Nsp11 from various PRRSV strains were aligned using the Clustal W program. Sequence alignment showed that Cys112 of Nsp11 is highly conserved across different genotypes of PRRSV. However, Cys64 is only identical among type 2 genotype PRRSV (Fig. 3A) . To determine whether these two cysteines are critical residues involved in the DUB activity of Nsp11 of PRRSV WUH3 strain, we constructed C64A and C112A Nsp11 mutants and compared them with WT Nsp11 for the ability to reduce protein ubiquitination. As shown in Fig. 3B , overexpression of WT Nsp11 or the C64A mutant significantly inhibited K48-linked ubiquitination of cellular proteins (compare lanes 3 and 4 vs. 2, respectively). In contrast, the C112A mutant had no such effect (compare lanes 5 vs. 2). These data suggest that the C112 residue is pivotal for the DUB activity of PRRSV Nsp11.",

Residues D144, K173, D180 and Y219 are also associated with the DUB activity of Nsp11 PRRSV Nsp11 encodes an endoribonuclease (NendoU), which is conserved throughout the Nidovirales order but has not been identified in RNA viruses of other families (Ivanov et al., 2004; Nedialkova et al., 2009) . Nedialkova et al. (2009) compared the amino acid sequences of the NendoU domain of Arterivirus (in Nsp11) and its counterpart in Nsp15 of SARS-CoV and found that at least 6 residues, corresponding to H129, H144, K173, D180, D204, and Y219 in PRRSV Nsp11, are highly conserved among PRRSV strain VR2332, SARS-CoV strain Frankfurt 1, and EAV strain Bucyrus (Nedialkova et al., 2009) . Considering that PRRSV is divided into distinct genotypes and even exhibits remarkable genetic diversity within each genotype, we compared the amino acid sequences of Nsp11 of several representative PRRSV strains isolated from different geographical regions in different years. As shown in Fig. 3A , the six residues reported by Nedialkova et al. (2009) are indeed highly conserved among different genotypes of PRRSV and EAV. To determine whether these residues contribute to the DUB activity of Nsp11, we performed Alanine substitution at each site. Each of these mutants was co-transfected with HA-Ub vector into HEK293 cells and Western blot was performed to detect the expression of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins and the Nsp11 mutant. As shown in Fig. 3C , while mutants bearing the H129A or D204A substitution (lanes 4 and 8, respectively) acted as effective as WT Nsp11 (lane 3) in preventing the accumulation of ubiquitination of cellular proteins, mutants harboring H144A, K173A orY219A substitution remarkably lost the DUB activity (lane5, 6 and 9), as compared to vector-transfected cells (lane 2). Intermediate DUB activity was observed for the D180A mutant (lane 7). Collectively, these data suggest that residues H144, K173, D180 and Y219 are also associated with the DUB activity of Nsp11. Given that mutation at H129 or D204 destroys the NendoU activity (Nedialkova et al., 2009) , our data also indicate that the DUB activity of Nsp11 is uncoupled from its NendoU activity. 1\u2424, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12) or empty vector (2.0 g).

Cell lysates were prepared at 30 h posttransfection and analyzed for Ub-conjugated proteins by Western blot with an anti-HA antibody. Western blot with anti-V5 antibody shows expression of Nsp11, and Western blot for beta-actin serves as a protein loading control.

The discovery that Nsp11 has DUB activity would imply that Nsp11 may affect NF-B activity. Indeed, it has been shown that ectopic expression of PRRSV Nsp11 inhibits NF-B activation through unknown mechanism(s). In agreement with these previous reports (Beura et al., 2010) , our luciferase reporter assays showed that Nsp11 down-regulated poly(I:C)-induced activation of a synthetic NF-B-dependent promoter in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 4A) . We next asked the question whether Nsp11 also attenuates expression of poly(I:C)induced, endogenous NF-B-responsive genes. To this end, HEK293 cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding V5-Nsp11 or the empty control vector. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were further transfected with poly(I:C) or mock-transfected. Total RNA was extracted from the cells and analyzed for the abundance of endogenous interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8 and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5, also known as RANTES), mRNAs by SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR. While poly(I:C) robustly induced the expression of IL-6 ( Fig. 4B) , IL-8 (Fig. 4C) , and CCL5 (Fig. 4D) in cells transfected with control vector, it was substantially less effective in cells expressing Nsp11. These results show that Nsp11 negatively regulates the induction of NF-B-target genes following stimulation by intracellular dsRNA.",

A key step that leads to NF-B activation in response to many extracellular stimuli is the degradation of IB\u2423, which sequesters NF-B proteins in the cytoplasm in resting cells (Wertz and Dixit, 2010) .

To test our hypothesis, HEK293 cells were transfected with an Nsp11-encoding vector or the empty vector (as a control), followed by stimulation by TNF-\u2423.

As shown in Fig. 6A , the results showed that mutants with impaired DUB activity were attenuated for the ability to suppress NF-B activation. Notably, the C64A, H129A and D204A mutants with DUB activities comparable to that of WT Nsp11 were as effective as the latter in blocking activation of NF-B, while the C112A, H144A, K173A and Y219A mutants with little or no DUB activity were without inhibitory effect. The D180A mutant possessing intermediate DUB activity had a moderate inhibition on NF-B. Taken together, these data show that DUB activity is proportional to the suppressive effect on NF-B activation. Next, we determined the abilities of these Nsp11 mutants to remove K48linked polyubiquitin chains from IB\u2423. As shown in Fig. 6B and C, the DUB activity toward polyubiquitinated IB\u2423 of the individual Nsp11 mutant directly correlated with the capacity to inhibit NF-B activation. Collectively, these results provide further support to the notion that PRRSV Nsp11 inhibits NF-B activation by means of its DUB activity toward polyubiquitinated IB\u2423.",

Importantly, our data showed the DUB activity is responsible for the ability of Nsp11 to inhibit NF-B activation, revealing a novel mechanism evolved by PRRSV to disarm host innate immune responses. At present, we favor a model in which Nsp11 removes K48-linked ubiquitin moieties from IB\u2423, thereby preventing the proteasomal degradation of IB\u2423 and subsequent liberation of NF-B. This is based on our data that the inhibitory effects of Nsp11 mutants on NF-B correlated with their abilities to deubiquitinate IB\u2423 conjugated with K48-linked ubiquitin chains. However, our study do not rule out the possibility Nsp11 may also act on other cellular targets to regulate NF-B activity.",

            "text": "Previous studies have revealed that PRRSV Nsp11 contains endoribonuclease (NendoU) activity (Nedialkova et al., 2009) . Although, NendoU is highly conserved throughout the Nidovirales order, thus far no NendoU homologs have been identified in RNA viruses of other families. In this regard, NendoU is considered to be a genetic marker of Nidoviruses (Ivanov et al., 2004) . Adopting a catalytic mechanism resembling that of RNase A, NendoU acts independent of Mn2+ and with a preference for uridylate, as has been demonstrated for NendoUs encoded by EAV, SARS-CoV and PRRSV (Nedialkova et al., 2009) . Through as-yet-unknown mechanisms, NendoU facilitates viral RNA synthesis (Kang et al., 2007; Posthuma et al., 2006) . In this study, we demonstrated that PRRSV Nsp11 also has DUB activity, ascribing a novel function to this enigmatic protein. In addition, our mutational analyses suggested that the DUB activity of Nsp11 is separated from its NendoU activity and that the former rather than the latter mediates the suppressive effect on NF-B. It will be interesting to investigate in future studies whether the Nsp11 counterparts encoded by other Nidoviruses also possess DUB and NF-B-inhibitory activities and whether these relate to the NendoU activity. Lee et al. (2005) firstly demonstrated that PRRSV infection activates NF-B signaling in Marc-145 cells and PAMs through inducing IB degradation and p65 nuclear translocation. Our group also showed that PRRSV infection triggers activation of NF-B and that the nucleocapsid (N) protein of PRRSV could elicit this process in Marc-145 cells Luo et al., 2008) . However, activated NF-B could only be detected after 24 h post infection. Given the recent reports that several PRRSV Nsps, including Nsp1\u2423, Nsp1\u2424, Nsp2, and Nsp11, could function as negative regulators of NF-B (Beura et al., 2010; Song et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2010) , it is plausible that the regulation of NF-B is a dynamic process during the course of PRRSV infection, and that PRRSV has developed sophisticated strategies to either activate or inhibit NF-B at various stages of the viral life cycle to facilitate viral replication and/or disrupting host innate immune responses, offering the virus a maximal survival advantage.",

To our surprise, all of the Nsp11 mutants characterized in the current study were impaired for the ability to block SeV-induced IFN-\u2424 and IRF-3 activation (data no shown). This result contrasted with the effects on NF-B, in that only the Nsp11 mutants losing the DUB activity were attenuated (Fig. 6) .

For instance, the assembly and release of some viruses are subjected to ubiquitination-dependent regulation. A number of viral proteins, such as HIV Gag (Demirov et al., 2002; Garrus et al., 2001) , Ebola virus VP40 (Yasuda et al., 2003) , Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) LMP2A (Ikeda et al., 2000) , and human papillomavirus (HPV) E7 (Kamio et al., 2004; Oh et al., 2004) , can be directly modified by ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteins, and these modifications play an important role in virion egress. While the precise role(s) of ubiquitination and/or deubiquitination in PRRSV infection remains to be established, the findings that PRRSV encodes at least two DUBs, i.e., Nsp2 and Nsp11, signify that these posttranslational modifications may play an important part in PRRSV propagation and/or pathogenesis. For example, it is possible that Nsp11 may cleave K48-linked polyubiquitin chains attached to viral replicase proteins and/or structural components to control the half-lives of these viral products, providing a fine-tuned condition that allows viral replication and/or packaging/release at maximal efficiency. Considering the fact that the papain-like proteases of several coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, NL63 and MHV) also possess DUB activity (Barretto et al., 2005; Barretto et al., 2005b; Lindner et al., 2005; Zheng et al., 2008) , the involvement of ubiquitination-dependent regulation in viral life cycle may represent a selective survival advantage during the evolution of Nidoviruses.",

Not only do these findings describe a novel mechanism acquired by PRRSV to counteract host innate immune responses, but they open new avenues to develop novel therapeutics against PRRS by targeting the interaction of Nsp11 with host ubiquitination system.",
