            "text": "Since the first studies on indoor air quality (IAQ), some common indoor air pollutants such as carbon monoxide, particulate matter, volatile organic compounds (VOC) and formaldehyde have been related to acute and chronic respiratory diseases, 1 contributing to indoor air pollution burden of disease estimated at 2.7%. 2 In modern society, children spend most of their time indoors (up to 85%), 3 at home or in children day care centers (DCC), and they are particularly vulnerable to the effects of IAQ. 4 Different studies have shown that IAQ and ventilation are associated with respiratory symptoms, allergy and infections. 5---7 Furthermore, it was estimated that about one million deaths per year in children under 5, could be attributed to acute respiratory infections due to IAQ. 8 Scientific and political authorities have proposed limits to the levels of air pollutants through recommendations and legislation. In 2006, Portuguese legislation was passed (Decreto-Lei 89/2006) setting reference levels for some indoor pollutants. 9 The design and construction of buildings have focused on mechanical resistance, durability and comfort. Economic concerns related to energy efficiency in buildings have resulted in a decrease in ventilation flow rates and practices that have led to a deterioration in IAQ. It has been suggested that these might have been partly responsible for the rise in respiratory diseases in recent decades. 10---12 Despite the large number of publications about the effects of indoor air pollution in schools, there is not much evidence about the association between IAQ in DCCs and health. This was addressed in some European reviews that systematized what has been done and what research is still required. 13---15 Studies focused on IAQ in DCCs are important because of their specificity and potential impact on children's health. Furthermore, as there are no clear thresholds that define the level of exposure to indoor air pollutants that affects children's health at DCCs, studies of those environments could provide additional relevant information. Day care centres studies may help identify feasible interventions that could subsequently be implemented by policy makers. It has been shown that some interventions might be effective in modulating IAQ in schools 16---18 and influencing respiratory symptoms. 19 Because IAQ patterns and effects vary widely between different countries, 8 local and national studies are important where interventions on population health are being considered. Each population is uniquely linked to its genetic background, specificities of the available infrastructures or construction typology, cultural behavior and climatic factors. This point has been made by Canha et al. 20 who showed that there was a connection between ventilation strategies and lower ventilation rates and higher CO 2 levels in Portuguese elementary school classrooms, when compared with Finnish classrooms in a rural setting. Other Portuguese studies targeting schoolchildren and adolescents have reported associations between IAQ and respiratory symptoms and wheezing. 21, 22 Outdoor and indoor environments should be considered simultaneously when studying the IAQ effects on human health. Different cross-sectional 23---25 and longitudinal 26---28 studies have shown the effects of both indoor and outdoor air pollutants on children's respiratory health. Background pollutant concentrations measured at central monitoring stations, traffic density/distance to major roads 29, 30 or dispersion models 25 have been used 29, 31 to study outdoor air pollutants. Exposure to indoor environments, such as schools 32, 33 or houses, where children spend a large amount of time, has only more recently been taken into consideration. 34, 35 Some Portuguese studies have also reported IAQ deficiencies both in Lisbon 36, 37 and Oporto. 22 Pegas et al. 37 reported that ventilation problems are present throughout the year and different pollutant profiles can be found in different seasons of the year.",

There is clear evidence that stress induces cortisol release and this hormone exerts an inhibitory action over the immune system. 38, 39 On the other hand, research has shown that the mothers of children with respiratory diseases, such as asthma, have higher levels of parenting stress, compared to those with healthy children, 40---42 and children whose parents experience higher levels of stress show higher vulnerability to respiratory disease. 43---45 Therefore, the parent---child relationship could influence the child's hypothalamus---pituitary---adrenal cortex (HPA) axis activation and cortisol release. 46 In fact, cortisol may be one of the biological links between parent---child stress and respiratory disease in childhood. For these reasons ENVIRH also included an ancillary study to assess parental symptoms (depression/anxiety), psychosocial context (parental stress, marital satisfaction, life events) and a measure of the child's HPA axis activation (24-h cortisol production).",

We chose to study DCCs from the two main Portuguese cities (Lisbon and Oporto) mainly for reasons of feasibility. These are busy cities with different air pollution sources which influence outdoor air quality. DCCs are located in different places: some are in apartments, others in isolated villas (with or without gardens, terraces or other forms of outdoor spaces), some in modern buildings and others in very old parts of town. In our country, children DCCs vary from fully State-run to joint or solely private ventures. We approached the Instituto da Seguran\u00e7a Social (the DCC national regulatory authority) in order to obtain a list of potential DCCs to be included in the study. For this study, only the private social security institutions (IPSS) included in the list were considered, for practical reasons, as they broadly provided all the age ranges that we aimed to study and their participation was expected to be easier. Those DCCs (IPSS) belonged either to Confedera\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional de Institui\u00e7\u00f5es de Solidariedade or to Uni\u00e3o das Miseric\u00f3rdias Portuguesas, both of which supported our study.",

Although a more specific quantification was needed to create ventilation model software, PFT technique was used only in a few DCCs and during Visit 2, because it is burdensome. PFT technique to determine air infiltration rates at homes and buildings, has been reported in several studies, 67, 68 while its applicability and effectiveness have been discussed elsewhere. 69, 70 Ventilation studies are important because this variable not only reflects IAQ but, when considering interventions to improve exposure to pollutant, also shows that improving ventilation will positively affect all airborne contaminants. We also looked at air pollutants outside the DCCs in order to differentiate indoor from outdoor sources. It might be interesting in future studies to determine the contribution of the outdoor to IAQ by analyzing traffic patterns in the surrounding areas, as it may be another intervention target.",

EBC study could be very useful as it is a non-invasive and easy-to-collect technique and allows the measurement of different markers. Different studies showed that nitrogen products and pH in EBC were associated with asthma and FEV 1 deterioration. 71 As far as pH is concerned, an association was found between benzene, NO 2 and PM 10 levels and EBC acidity. 22 Another constraint we faced was the low number of children from whom virus swabs were collected, despite the efforts of our team who held several public discussions with parents and DCC staff. This may be because of parents' concern about the technique and not appreciating the importance of this aspect of the study. Although we should note that after the Influenza H1N1 alert in 2011 the study compliance increased dramatically.",

Modeling software for ventilation studies may also prove valuable toward these ends, from two perspectives: research and policy implementation. For research in other settings, models may prove as valuable, reliable and more affordable instruments to calculate IAQ parameters than direct measurements, even if they retain some limitations. 77, 78 They may also be useful for building design and ventilation strategies in some cases 78, 79 and could be used to predict the health impact and costs of specific situations and interventions, bringing together engineers, physicians and policy makers.",
