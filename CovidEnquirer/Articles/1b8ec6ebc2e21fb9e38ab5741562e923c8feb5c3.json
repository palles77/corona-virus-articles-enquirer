Signs of Tyzzer's disease include diarrhea, an unthrifty appearance, and acute death. 35 In one case, dependent subcutaneous edema and excessive serous fluid were reported. 54 Lesions observed at necropsy include intestinal inflammation and focal hepatic necrosis. Because C. piliforme is an intracellular bacterium, it will not grow on routine culture media. Definitive diagnosis is made at necropsy by identification of the organisms on hematoxylin and eosin-or silver-stained sections of intestine or liver. Treatment has been unrewarding.

Although there is a strong genetic predisposition to malocclusion, diet, trauma, or infection may also play a role. 26 Maxillary premolars and molars overgrow laterally, abrading the cheeks, and mandibular teeth overgrow medially, abrading the tongue and occluding the oropharynx. 10 Overgrown incisors can be identified on physical examination ( Fig. 24-1 ). Because premolar malocclusion usually goes unnoticed until the animal appears anorectic, prehends but cannot swallow food, and loses weight, an evaluation of cheek teeth should always be an integral component of a physical examination. Excess salivation (slobbers), wetting of chin and forepaws, and secondary moist dermatitis are also signs of malocclusion. 26 Malocclusion can be diagnosed by careful oral examination. Because the oral cavity of the guinea pig is narrow and large buccal folds are present, this examination is facilitated by first anesthetizing the animal with isoflurane. Gauze strips looped over the incisors can be used to open the mouth, and a vaginal speculum or otoscope can be used to carefully check the premolars and molars. The teeth can be trimmed with a dental drill, pediatric rongeurs, or a specially designed file. Use care if rongeurs are used to avoid splitting the teeth. Trimming needs to be repeated routinely (usually every 4 to 6 weeks) for the remainder of the animal's life. Vitamin C can be added to the diet of guinea pigs at 15 to 25 mg/day to prevent decreased collagen formation and subsequent tooth movement in the socket. 10 The disease can be prevented by not breeding affected animals and by feeding a proper diet (see Chapter 34) .",

            "text": "Pneumonia is probably the most significant disease in guinea pigs, particularly in damp or humid environments. Guinea pigs are very susceptible to respiratory disease caused by Bordetella bronchiseptica and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Bordetella, a gramnegative rod, is commonly carried by rabbits, dogs, and nonhuman primates. Rabbits and guinea pigs are mutual sources of infection of Bordetella. 8 Streptococcus, a gram-positive coccus, is also transmitted by asymptomatic carriers of many species. Stress increases susceptibility to disease, and young guinea pigs are most often affected. The organisms are transmitted by direct contact, by aerosolization, and on fomites. 26 Signs include inappetence, nasal and ocular discharge, and dyspnea. Bordetella causes a purulent bronchopneumonia with consolidation of lung lobes and exudate in the tympanic bullae. Metritis and abortions have also been described. Streptococcus causes a fibrinopurulent pleuritis and pericarditis in addition to bronchopneumonia. 26 Torticollis and abortions may also occur with Streptococcus. The combination of S. pneumoniae infection and vitamin C deficiency has resulted in septic arthritis. 57 Diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia is made by culture and sensitivity analysis of exudate. Bordetella antibodies can be detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or by indirect immunofluorescence; however, culture and sensitivity studies should be used to confirm active cases. 58 Radiographs may reveal consolidated lung lobes or an opacity in the tympanic bullae. Antibiotics commonly used to treat bacterial pneumonia in guinea pigs are chloramphenicol palmitate (30-50 mg/kg PO q12h \u00a5 7-21 days) and trimethoprim-sulfa (30-50 mg/kg PO q12h \u00a5 7 days), and enrofloxacin (5-10 mg/kg q12h \u00a5 7-21 days). A combination therapy using enrofloxacin and doxycycline (2.5 mg/kg PO q12h) for 7-21 days has also been effective. Long-term therapy (4-6 weeks) with any of these antimicrobial agents may be necessary. Trovafloxacin, a new quinolone, is effective against S. pneumoniae and was used successfully to treat experimentally induced Legionnaires' disease in guinea pigs. 40 Lactobacillus should be given during antibiotic treatment and for approximately 5 days afterward. Supportive care, such as lactated Ringer's solution, oxygen therapy, and vitamin C, can also be given. Good husbandry, avoidance of stress, and separation of guinea pigs from dogs and rabbits will help control pneumonia.",

Females older than 3 years of age appear to be predisposed to cystitis and cystic calculi. 41 In one report, calcium oxalate uroliths were diagnosed in a number of guinea pigs with Streptococcus pyogenes cystitis. The bacteria formed nidi around which calcium was deposited, resulting in stone formation. 39 Signs of urolithiasis include anorexia, hematuria, dysuria, and a huddled, hunched posture. 48 Lesions include hemorrhage or congestion of bladder mucosa, hemorrhagic exudate within the bladder, and calculi adherent to the bladder wall. 41 S. pyogenes causes hyperemia of bladder mucosa and yellowish-gray deposits within the lumen. 39 Uroliths can sometimes be palpated; however, definitive diagnosis is most often made by radiography. Urinary acidifiers usually are not indicated because guinea pigs cannot easily remove an acid load. 26 Although potassium citrate is sometimes used to help prevent the formation of calculi, the efficacy of this drug has not been proven. In guinea pigs with urethral calculi, retrograde flushing might relieve the obstruction. If this procedure fails or if cystic or ureteral calculi are present, surgery should be considered. Isoflurane or sevoflurane is the anesthetic of choice for guinea pigs. Supportive care for urinary calculi includes antibiotic and fluid therapy.",

A standard ventral midline approach is used. The uterus is exteriorized and incised longitudinally. Once the pups are removed, they should be cleaned off and stimulated to breathe immediately.

Guinea pigs with mastitis can be treated with systemic antibiotics, particularly chloramphenicol palmitate, trimethoprim-sulfa, and enrofloxacin. Hot packs can be applied to the affected glands. The environment should be cleaned, and the pups may be weaned early. If necessary, the mammary glands can be resected. 26",

Young animals are more susceptible because of their incompletely developed immune systems and lower amounts of fungistatic fatty acids in their sebum. 51 The dermatophyte most frequently isolated is Trichophyton mentagrophytes, although Microsporum canis has also been identified. Animals may be asymptomatic carriers; disease usually occurs secondary to overcrowding, poor husbandry, and other stressors. The organism is easily transmitted by direct contact and fomites. Lesions in the guinea pig are pruritic and consist of focal circular areas of alopecia with crusts. Lesions are usually seen first on the face, forehead, and ears and later spread over the back and down the limbs. 10 Diagnosis is made by plucking or scraping hairs and crusts from the periphery of the lesion and placing these on dermatophyte test medium (DTM) or another appropriate culture medium. Ringworm can be treated topically with miconazole (q24h \u00a5 2-4 weeks). 26 Butenafine has been used effectively as a 1% cream applied topically (q24h \u00a5 10-20 days). 1 Fluconazole can be administered at 16 mg/kg PO q24h \u00a5 14 days. 37 Griseofulvin pediatric solution (25 mg/100 g PO q10 days \u00a5 three treatments) has proved effective, 10 but griseofulvin is more commonly given at 25 mg/kg PO q24h \u00a5 14-28 days. Because it is teratogenic, this drug should not be given to pregnant animals. 10 Ringworm is a potentially zoonotic disease.",

Therefore, they cannot convert glucose to ascorbic acid and are incapable of endogenous synthesis of vitamin C. 38 For this reason, guinea pigs require 15 to 25 mg/day vitamin C added to their diet; pregnant animals require 30 mg/day. 26 Ascorbic acid is necessary for collagen synthesis; lack of dietary vitamin C results in defective type IV collagen, laminin, and elastin, which compromises blood vessel integrity and results in joint and gingival hemorrhages. 34 Collagen also is necessary to anchor teeth tightly in their sockets; without it, teeth loosen and malocclusion occurs. In addition, vitamin C is necessary for appropriate retention of vitamin E. 33 Signs of vitamin C deficiency include rough hair coat, anorexia, diarrhea, teeth grinding, vocalizing from pain, delayed wound healing, lameness, and increased susceptibility to bacterial infections. 35 Radiographically, long bone epiphyses and costochondral junctions of the ribs are enlarged. Pathologic fractures may also be evident. Young, growing animals are more susceptible to scurvy, and clinical disease can develop after as little as 2 weeks of ascorbic acid deprivation. 10 Diagnosis of vitamin C deficiency is based on history, clinical signs, and radiographic lesions. Serum ascorbic acid levels can be used to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment should be initiated with parenteral ascorbic acid at a dose of 50 mg/day IP, IM, or SC. Once response is noted, vitamin C may be administered orally at the same dosage. After recovery, vitamin C should be supplemented daily in the diet. Fresh, good-quality guinea pig (not rabbit) chow provides adequate vitamin C if used within 90 days of the milling date (see Chapter 23) . Fresh cabbage, kale, and oranges also provide a source of vitamin C: 100 g of kale contains 125 mg vitamin C, and 50 g of cabbage contains 30 mg vitamin C. 26 Vitamin C tablets can be added to the drinking water at a concentration of 200 to 400 mg/L 35 ; medicated water should be replaced daily.
