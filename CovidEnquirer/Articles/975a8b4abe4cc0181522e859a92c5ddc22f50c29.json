The administration of vaccines is now commonplace and is considered one of the most important aspects of global disease control (Tizard 2009 ). Strategic implementation of vaccination is important to cattle health and welfare, as vaccination can help to control and eradicate disease, as demonstrated by the global eradication of rinderpest (Normile 2008) , and control of rabies, foot and mouth disease and swine erysipelas (Lombard and others 2007) . In order for disease control to be effectively achieved via vaccination, correct usage is required, which includes administering vaccines via the correct route, at the appropriate time and to a specified target group of animals (Responsible Use of Medicines in Agriculture Alliance (RUMA) 2012). Incorrect administration may lead to breakthrough disease, rendering vaccination a wasteful, rather than beneficial exercise (Salisbury and others 2006) .",

Additionally, 50 respondents who nominated using a vaccine which was contraindicated in pregnant cattle did not state they would exclude these animals from being vaccinated. This may be due to farmers being unaware of the risks of using these vaccines in pregnant animals, but may also be because there were no pregnant cattle on these farms, which is likely for respondents from beef farms with grower and/or finisher herds. Other reasons for not excluding animals could be that a whole herd approach is being taken for management purposes, and all animals are being vaccinated, rather than selecting animals individually for vaccination.",

Economic factors, such as vaccine cost and increased production profits associated with vaccination, could affect decision-making on whether to vaccinate. Although nearly half the respondents had discussed cost with their vaccine supplier in the past year, cost was not frequently mentioned as a barrier for vaccination. However, a Dutch study has suggested that economic factors are the main motivators (e.g., increased production profits) and barriers (e.g., vaccination costs) for farmers when deciding whether to vaccinate their livestock (Elbers and others 2010) . Other studies describe factors, such as worker satisfaction, as being equally as motivating as cost in farmer decision-making about cattle health (Valeeva and others 2007) . The veterinarian was the main vaccine supplier, and also the preferred source of information for many respondents in this study, but only 66 per cent of respondents had discussions about vaccine use with their supplier. The variation observed with respect to following recommended vaccination protocols may be explained by this lack of discussion on the use of vaccines. Incorporating information such as RUMA's 'Checklist for Vaccination' (RUMA 2012), together with tailored farm advice during herd health visits provides an opportunity to discuss vaccination protocols with a client. This approach could improve adherence to recommended vaccination strategies, reduce vaccine failure on farms, and raise awareness of the potential benefits among those who are not vaccinating.",

Supplying medicines forms an essential part of farm veterinary practice in the UK; it was recently reported that an average of 55 per cent of income for farm veterinary practices is derived from medicine sales (Veterinary Development Council 2012). Although vaccines are available from agricultural merchants and internet pharmacies, 93 per cent of respondents bought their vaccines from a veterinarian, highlighting the potential opportunity for the veterinarian to combine their role as supplier with their role as advisor about vaccination. Veterinarians rarely carried out vaccination on farms, as this was mostly done by workers and senior staff. Generally, no specific qualifications are required to be a farm worker; it may be that some of these workers carrying out vaccination have had no formal training in the correct administration of vaccines. Further work to confirm lack of training as a cause of suboptimal vaccine usage may help to focus future knowledge transfer activities.",

Our results, although only describing vaccination uptake and usage of 266 respondents, are supported by other work performed in the UK (Meadows 2010) and provide a basis for further studies to evaluate vaccine efficacy and disease control in situations with correct and less than ideal use of vaccines. A perhaps more important limitation of this study is the bias encountered because of the convenience sampling method used, which is difficult to counter using the voluntary survey method. One could hypothesise that this study underestimated vaccination compliance, as more engaged farmers may have participated, which makes it more likely to expect poorer compliance in nonrespondents.

            "text": "In conclusion, uptake of cattle vaccines in the UK was generally good, but improvements to usage would improve adherence to data sheet guidelines and could increase the efficacy of vaccination. A particular area where vaccination strategies could be improved would be correctly selecting animals for vaccination and administering vaccines within the recommended timeframes. The veterinarian was nominated as the main vaccine supplier and source of information on vaccines and, therefore, remains crucial to improve cattle vaccination strategies in the UK.",
