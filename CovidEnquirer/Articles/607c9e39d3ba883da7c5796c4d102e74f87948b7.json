As in the discovery of HCoV-NH (10), this virus was detected with molecular probes. Although growth of HCoV-HKU1 in multiple cell lines was unsuccessful, the complete genomic sequence was obtained. Phylogenetic analysis showed that this new group II CoV is most closely related to the mouse hepatitis virus and is distinct from HCoV-OC43, the only other known group II HCoV. Screening of 400 nasopharyngeal aspirates by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with HCoV-HKU1-specific primers showed 1 other HCoV-HKU1 isolate from a 35-year-old woman with pneumonia. After the original report, HCoV-HKU1 was identified in 10 patients in northern Australia (15) . Respiratory samples were collected between May and August (winter in Australia) and screened by RT-PCR with both nonspecific CoV and specific HKU1 primers. Most HCoV-HKU1-positive samples originated from children in the later winter months. However, the seasonal and geographic distribution of this virus is still unclear. To address these issues, we sought to determine whether HCoV-HKU1 circulated in New Haven, Connecticut, and to define clinical characteristics associated with HCoV-HKU1 infection in infants and children.",

HCoV-HKU1 is most closely related to the murine hepatitis virus, a virus that causes hepatitis as well as demyelinating disease in mice (18) . Because of this patient's medical history (liver transplantation) and compromised immune status, many potential causes of hepatitis exist, though serologic assays and liver biopsy findings were unrevealing. Several reports have found coronavirus-like particles in stool of persons with gastrointestinal disease (19) , which suggests that these viruses, like coronaviruses of animals, can cause disease of the gastrointestinal tract. Future studies will be needed to determine whether HCoV-HKU1, or other common human coronaviruses, play a role in liver disease.",

If multiple genotypes exist, they may not all be detected with the primer set used. This limitation would result in an underestimation of this virus in our study. However, the region of the replicase 1B gene targeted by the primers used (14) is highly conserved among other coronaviruses, and our screening was unlikely to have lacked sensitivity for that reason. Also, only rare polymorphisms were detected on the sequence analysis of the 9 individual isolates, which suggests that this region is highly conserved. However, to establish the true prevalence of HKU1, use of primers with known specificity and sensitivity for HCoV-HKU1 will be critical.",

Our study, the study bySloots et al.,  and the original study by Woo et al. screened respiratory specimens submitted to a diagnostic laboratory. Therefore, HKU1 may be a common virus that causes symptomatic disease in only a relatively small percentage of infected persons. All HCoV-HKU1-positive specimens were collected from December 2001 to February 2002, which implies a winter distribution. The study by Sloots et al. also detected HCoV-HKU1 predominantly in the winter, although only respiratory samples submitted during winter months were screened. Whether the seasonal distribution of HCoV-HKU1 varies from year to year is not known. Similar to the patients described by Woo et al., several HCoV-HKU1-positive patients had evidence of lower respiratory tract involvement (2 patients with pneumonia and 1 patient with bronchiolitis). Two of these patients had underlying illness. However, most patients identified in our study had only mild upper respiratory tract symptoms.
