Comparisons of the published nucleotide sequence of Sl genes of strains isolated in Europe, Japan and the USA and four additional American strains described in this report identified 4 genetically distinct groups. The Dutch group was the most divergent sharing only about 60% identity with the American, Mass and European groups which were about 80% homologous with each other. Whereas the strains within the Mass, European and Dutch strains were at least 95% homologous, the strains within the American group were most variable, sharing about 80% identity. The h~e~ariable region (HVR) which tended to correlate with serotype extended from amino acid residue 53 to 148. In addition to the previously described putative recombination events in the Sl gene of PP14 and SE17, we have now described similar shifts in homology in the corresponding gene of the Gray, Holte, 6/82 (European strain), and Iowa strains. Although minor cross-over sites were identified in the more conserved 3' end at approximately nt 1000 and 1400, a frequently used hot-spot for re~mbination extended from nt 25 to a region immediately upstream of, but not including, the hypervariable region (HVR). In addition to point mutations, deletions, and insertions, recombination often involving Mass-like and Ark-like sequences, is a commonly used mechanism responsible for the evolution of IBV.",

            "text": "The large number of phenotypically distinct strains of IBV provide a broad genetic background to examine naturally occurring variation associated with outbreaks of coronavirus induced disease. Variations resulting in evolutionary changes are both a consequence of modifications in the genome and the result of environmental pressures placed on the virus. Factors determining genetic variability of coronaviruses include point mutations and recombination events. The lack of proof-reading in RNA polymerases is thought to be responsible for the high frequencies of point mutations among the RNA viruses, and provides a mechanism for antigenic and pathogenic evolution (Holland et al., 1982) . More rapid modifications in the genetic composition of many viruses, including coronaviruses, may occur as a result of recombination events (Lai, 1992) . Under experimental conditions, both in vitro and in vivo, RNA recombination between mouse coronavirus genomes in the presence and absence of selective biological pressure has been well documented (Lai et al., 1985; Makino et al., 1986; Banner and Lai, 1991; Liao and Lai, 1992) . Such exchanges of genetic information could be a critical mechanism for the survival of coronaviruses in nature. A consequence of rapid variation could be the frequent occurrence of IBV-related disease in vaccinated animals (personal observations). In fact, recombination events in the Sl involving serologically distinct Ark-like and Mass-like strains have been shown to occur in naturally evolving IBV strains that have been implicated with severe disease in chickens immunized with a Mass-like vaccine (Wang et al., 1993) . The role of recombination in the evolution of IBV in the field and the mechanisms responsible for such exchanges of genetic information have not been determined.",

The only concentration of variations between the serologically distinct Conn and the Mass strains were found in this region. Likewise, sequence variations among strains of the serologically different European and Mass groups were concentrated in this region. It is apparent from the sequence alignment that the 5% variation among Mass serotype strains were spread throughout the Sl gene, but the 2-3% alterations among the serologically distinct UK-82, 84 and 86 were focused in the HVR region. Sequence differences concentrated in the HVR of the Conn and Mass may explain the serotype distinction of these otherwise genetically very closely related viruses. Because only two amino acid differences could be found between the Kb8523 and Beaudette, it was suggested that the serotype difference between these strains might be explained by a variable region found in the S2 of Kb8.523 (Sutou et al., 1988) . The phylogenetic tree and overall sequence comparisons of the entire Sl genes do not reflect localized sequence variations or dramatic shifts in homology.

Although the European strains appeared to be highly conserved among each other, they shared regions that were similar to both the Ark and M41 strains and may have shared common ancestors, evolving through recombination events involving both of these U.S. strains. Ark-like and Mass-like sequences have been identified in the Sl genes of 6 American viruses, as well as the European strains. A number of recombinants from earlier isolates were identified with genome fragments that were similar to Ark. Since Ark actually was isolated somewhat later than the SE17, Iowa and Holte, the shared Ark-like segments probably originated from a strain that evolved before Ark. This common ancestor apparently continues to play a dominant role in the evolution of IBV because the most recent U.S. strains such as PP14, and the unpublished 4121 and 4628, isolated from 1992 to 1993 were found to be genetically closest to Ark (Wang et al., 1993; persona1 observations) . Mass-like sequences were also commonly found in potential recombinant strains. The presence of Mass-like segments in the American strains, as well as the European strains, suggested that recombination provides a prominent mechanism for the Mass derived vaccines to directly influence the evolution of IBV.",

Evidence for recombination in SE17 and PP14 had suggested that a hot spot for recombination Iies in a region between nucleotide 50 and 131 within the Sl gene (Wang et al., 1993) . Additional recombinants in this report appear to have resulted from the exchange of genetic information between nucleotide 25 and 131. This hot spot extends from within the signal sequence up to, but not including, the HVR. No evidence, as yet, has been found that recombination occurs within the HVR although a less commonly used cross-over site was described downstream. Gray had a shift in homology between nt 1030 to nt 1373 that was similar to a recombination region identified in SE17 (Wang et al., 1993) . Additional cross-over sites that might be located in more conserved or extremely variable sequences of the gene might be difficult to identify, It is of interest that variations of a consensus-like sequence, CTI'(A/TXA/T)G, found adjacent to putative cross-over sites in the Sl gene of PP14 and SE17 were similarly found near most of the recombination sites described in Gray, Ho&e, Iowa, and 6-82. These sequences, which resemble the intergenic sites between leader and the coding region, could be critical in polymerase recognition required for recombination. Although the requirements that determine where cross-over events occur are not known, recombination is apparently a common mechanism for generating variation in the field resulting in the continuing evolution of IBV.
