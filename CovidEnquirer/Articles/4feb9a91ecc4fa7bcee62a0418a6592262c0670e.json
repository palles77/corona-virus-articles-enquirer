In the current study, we investigated whether amiloride could also exhibit antiviral activity against foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), which belongs to the same family (Picornaviridae) as CVB3. We found that amiloride exerted antiviral activity in a dose-dependent manner against two strains of FMDV in IBRS-2 cells, with slight cytotoxicity at 1000 \u03bcM. Besides, amiloride did not inhibit the attachment and entry of FMDV in IBRS-2 cells, but prevented early viral replication. These data implied that amiloride could be a promising candidate for further research as a potential antiviral drug against FMDV infection.",

It has become a major threat to the global livestock industry owing to its high infectivity and the presence of various FMDV serotypes [2] . Therefore, it is of considerable interest to develop effective measures to prevent and control FMD. Currently, vaccination is the primary method for the prevention of FMD. However, several factors limit the use of FMD vaccines, including slow antibody production, low antibody levels, short duration of antibody persistence, and poor immune responses [3] . The lack of effective control measures underlines the importance of research on new antivirals.",

Currently, amiloride and its derivatives are used as potassium-sparing diuretics for the treatment of hypertension and prevention of hypokalemia associated with congestive heart failure [5] . In recent years, there has been an increasing interest to explore the antiviral activities of amiloride owing to its low toxicity [6] . Previous studies have demonstrated that amiloride inhibited Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) replication in infected HeLa cells by directly affecting viral replication or release [7, 8] . Besides, amiloride derivatives, such as 5-(N,N-hexamethylene) amiloride (HMA), have also been noted to inhibit ion channels formed by proteins of human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus, coronavirus, and dengue viruses [9] [10] [11] [12] . It has been reported that amiloride, 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride (EIPA), and benzamil inhibited the replication of human rhinovirus 2 in infected cells and that the antiviral activity was unlikely to be due to the inhibition of cellular Na/H exchanger or epithelial Na channel [13] . However, it remains unknown whether amiloride exerts inhibitory effects on FMDV infection. In the present study, we demonstrated the antiviral activity of amiloride against FMDV and investigated the effect of amiloride on different stages of FMDV infection. The results obtained indicated that amiloride might be a potential antiviral agent for reducing FMDV infection.",

However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no previous definitive studies on the antiviral activity of amiloride against FMDV, which belongs to the same family of Picornaviridae as CVB3. Analysis of the cytotoxicity of amiloride revealed that amiloride had little effect on cell viability. Treatment of 1000 \u03bcM amiloride induced mild cytotoxicity in the host cells at concentrations (Fig. 2 ). In addition, at this concentration, no differences in cell morphology were found between amiloride-treated and mock-treated IBRS-2 cells (data not shown). The CC 50 of amiloride estimated by Graphpad software was about 1879 \u03bcM. To investigate antiviral protection to the cells from CPE caused by FMDV infection, a serial dilution range of amiloride was used from 100 to 1000 \u03bcM. With the treatment of 400, 600, 800, and 1000 \u03bcM of amiloride, significant protection for cells from CPE (P < 0.01) (Fig. 3A) , other concentrations of amiloride were found to not provide effective protection to the cells infected with FMDV O/ MYA98/BY/2010 (Fig. 3A) . To further confirm the inhibitory effect of amiloride on FMDV replication in IBRS-2 cells, real-time PCR, Western blot analysis, and IFA were performed. The mean relative mRNA load of IBRS-2 cells treated with 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, and 1000 \u03bcM amiloride was 106.46, 99.96, 0.050, 0.058, 0.027, and 0.017, respectively (mean relative mRNA load of mock-treated cells was set at 100) (Fig. 4A) . Consistent with these results, the FMDV VP1 protein was significantly suppressed following treatment with 400, 600, 800, and 1000 \u03bcM amiloride (Fig. 4B) . With regard to IFA, both control and IBRS-2 cells treated with 100 and 200 \u03bcM amiloride generated strong fluorescent signals at 12 h post-infection, whereas cells treated with 400, 600, 800, and 1000 \u03bcM amiloride showed reduced fluorescent signals (Fig. 5) . Therefore, amiloride represents a novel antiviral molecule against FMDV. Interestingly, amiloride exhibited antiviral activity against different strain of FMDV. The effective dose of amiloride against type A FMDV was from 200 \u03bcM (Fig. 3B ). As shown in Table 1 indicates that the cells that were not treated with amiloride. Values represent the mean \u00b1 standard deviation for three independent experiments. ***P < 0.001 compared with the control group.",

The IBRS-2 cells were incubated with amiloride at 0 h or 2, 4, 8, and 16 h after FMDV infection, and a Q-PCR and Western blot assay were conducted at 24 h postinfection to determine the relative mRNA levels and VP1 protein in the infected and untreated cells (Fig. 7) . The viral mRNA levels were noticeably inhibited by amiloride treatment at 0, 2, 4, and 8 h post-infection. The mean relative mRNA levels of cells treated with amiloride at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 16 h were 0.042, 0.019, 0.015, 0.069, and 96.52, respectively (with mean relative mRNA level of mock-treated cells set at 100) (Fig. 7B) . Similarly, the viral VP1 protein expression was also low even after amiloride treatment at 8 h post-infection (Fig. 7C) . However, only negligible inhibitory effects were observed after amiloride treatment at 16 h post-infection, indicating that amiloride blocked FMDV replication at the early stages of viral infection. Interestingly, previous studies have revealed that amiloride could inhibit CVB3 genome replication and act as a competitive inhibitor inhibiting the enzymatic activity of CVB3 3Dpol in cell culture, affecting VPgpUpU synthesis and RNA elongation [6, 7] . In particular, amiloride could compete with nucleoside triphosphates and Mg 2+ , and the molecular mechanism of action of amiloride against FMDV should be examined in detail. It has been reported that amiloride analogs have a different content inhibitory activity against CVB3 3Dpol [17] . Thus, it will be interesting to investigate and compare the efficacy of amiloride analogs such as EIPA, 5-(N,N-dimethyl) amiloride, and HMA against FMDV. Recently, we investigated the protective effect of amiloride in an FMDV-challenged suckling mouse model based on the anti-FMDV replication activity of amiloride in vitro. The findings revealed that 50 \u03bcg of amiloride showed better protection (33.3%) when compared with DMSO-treated group (8.3%) after 5 days post-infection. Nevertheless, larger studies are required to determine if there is a significant difference in the survival rate.",
