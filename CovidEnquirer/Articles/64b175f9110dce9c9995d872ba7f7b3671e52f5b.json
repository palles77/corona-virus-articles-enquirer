After a brief, unexpected exposure to a patient with SARS, 69 intensive-care staff at risk for SARS were interviewed to evaluate risk factors. SARS developed in seven healthcare workers a median of 5 days (range 3-8) after last exposure. SARS developed in 6 of 31 persons who entered the patient's room, including 3 who were present in the room >4 hours. SARS occurred in three of five persons present during the endotracheal intubation, including one who wore gloves, gown, and N-95 mask. The syndrome also occurred in one person with no apparent direct exposure to the index patient. In most, but not all cases, developing SARS was associated with factors typical of droplet transmission. Providing appropriate quarantine and preventing illness in healthcare providers substantially affects delivery of health care.",

SARS is most likely to develop in healthcare workers and household or family contacts of infected persons (2) (3) (4) . Unprotected exposure to SARS in hospitals has several potential consequences, which include the following: illness in persons and healthcare workers; transmission of SARS from ill healthcare workers and patients to visitors and household contacts; and reduced ability of the healthcare system to deliver care because of illness in or quarantine of healthcare workers. In addition, the psychological impact of isolation and quarantine can be substantial (5) . As a result, understanding factors associated with SARS transmission after exposure to SARS patients is important and would assist with formulating appropriate quarantine procedures. We describe our experience with a large number of healthcare workers who were exposed to a patient in an intensive-care unit (ICU) with undiagnosed SARS.",

The patient originally had signs and symptoms consistent with a presumptive diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. Before transfer, SARS was excluded from the differential diagnosis because the patient had not traveled, had never left the emergency department of the referring hospital, and had only had a single recent outpatient visit to an area of the original hospital in which SARS had not been identified. Upon arrival in our ICU, the patient was placed in precautions for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pending admission screening results (6) . Therapy with broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs was initiated. Humidified high-flow oxygen was administered for the first 5 h, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation by oronasal mask for the next 18.25 h, and invasive mechanical ventilation for the subsequent time (7.5 h). Endotracheal intubation required fiber-optic placement. That the extent of the outbreak at the referring institution was larger than originally appreciated became apparent at this time; therefore, the patient was transferred to another facility for placement in negative pressure isolation for possible exposure to SARS. Subsequently, his family members became ill, and the SARS-associated coronavirus was identified in the patient's respiratory secretions (polymerase chain reaction testing of bronchoalveolar lavage confirmed the diagnosis of SARS).",

Two-sided tests were used for all comparisons. A p value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Classification and regression tree methods were used to identify predictors of developing SARS (8) . The healthcare workers were divided into two groups by examining all possible cutpoints of all predictor variables to find the cutpoint of a predictor variable that resulted in the largest difference in the probabilities of developing SARS between the two resulting subgroups. This procedure was performed repeatedly for each resulting subgroup until all members of the subgroup had the same SARS status or the subgroup was too small to warrant further splitting.",

Selected contact characteristics predictive of the development of SARS in healthcare workers who entered the patient's room appear in the Figure. SARS developed in three of the five persons present during the endotracheal intubation of the patient. During this procedure, the patient's respiratory secretions were splashed onto the uncovered cheek of one of the healthcare workers. No other healthcare worker reported direct skin exposure to the patient's bodily secretions at any time during his admission. Two of the three persons in whom SARS developed after the endotracheal intubation wore a gown, surgical mask, and gloves; one healthcare worker wore a gown, gloves, and N-95 mask. Of the two healthcare workers present during endotracheal intubation in whom SARS did not develop, one was a postgraduate medical trainee who assisted with manual ventilation (bagvalve-mask ventilation using a Laerdal bag) and was positioned to the side of the patient rather than directly over the patient's head. This healthcare worker wore gown, gloves, and surgical mask during the procedure. The second worker was a respiratory therapist who helped prepare the necessary equipment while wearing gown, gloves, and an N-95 mask.",

Fecal transmission is unlikely as the patient did not have a bowel movement during his stay. True airborne spread may also have occurred. Although evidence does not support this route of transmission for the SARS-associated coronavirus, existing literature suggests that other coronaviruses may be spread by an airborne route in certain circumstances (13) . Given our lack of knowledge about the transmissibility of SARS at the time this exposure occurred, we made a conservative decision to quarantine for 10 days all persons who were in the unit for at least 4 h or who had a history of entry into the affected patient's room. In addition, we closed the ICU to admissions and discharges for a 10-day period, markedly affecting our institution's ability to deliver health care. In fact, during the Toronto outbreak, several of the city's ICUs were closed as a result of quarantine and illness in staff with similar consequences (14) ; by infecting healthcare workers, SARS has an impact on the health of an entire community. A less aggressive quarantine approach may have been as effective in controlling transmission and allowed more staff to be available for work. For instance, only persons who have had direct contact with the patient (i.e., entered the patient's room) could have been quarantined. If we had taken this approach, the quarantine would have excluded six persons with SARS from the workplace but only removed 25 of the 62 persons who remained well. However, this approach would have missed one healthcare worker in whom SARS developed. Another approach might be to monitor staff closely for SARS-related symptoms while they continue their usual activities and quarantine only those in whom symptoms occur. This approach would require evidence that SARS cannot be transmitted before symptom onset, confidence in the facility's ability to identify symptomatic staff, and reliability of healthcare workers in reporting symptoms. We think that our quarantine approach prevented secondary spread of illness to other persons who may have come in contact with the workers in whom SARS developed.",

Second, vigilant surveillance for symptoms of SARS must be maintained by all healthcare workers who work in institutions with SARS patients; SARS may develop in healthcare workers even when they do not have direct exposure to patients with SARS. In addition, protocols for managing patients with SARS should include not only contact and respiratory precautions but also procedures that minimize patient contact since duration and proximity of contact increase the risk for transmission of SARS. Finally, additional precautions should be taken when performing high-risk procedures, such as endotracheal intubation (11) .",
