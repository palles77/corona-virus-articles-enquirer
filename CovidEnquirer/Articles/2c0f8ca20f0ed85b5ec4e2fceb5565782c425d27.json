            "text": "The large intestine of the dog and cat has evolved to serve two major functions: extraction of water and electrolytes from the fluid contents of the lumen and control of defecation. The large intestine accomplishes these functions by regulating fluid transport, bacterial fermentation, motility, immune surveillance, and blood flow. Sodium and water absorption serve to dehydrate the feces prior to defecation; mucus glycoproteins serve to trap bacterial pathogens and prevent bacterial translocation; epithelial cells, lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells serve to regulate the bacterial flora and the immune response to microbes; and motility serves to facilitate storage or defecation of feces. Perturbations in any of these functions may result in the problems of diarrhea, constipation, or systemic inflammatory response syndrome.",

            "text": "The large intestine consists of the cecum, colon, rectum, and anal canal (Figure 58-1). In dogs and cats, the ileum communicates directly with the colon, and what is referred to as the cecum in the dog and cat is actually a diverticulum of the proximal colon. The colon is further compartmentalized into ascending, transverse, and descending portions, each segment having slightly different functions and properties. The right colic or hepatic flexure separates the ascending and transverse colon, and the left colic or splenic flexure separates the transverse and descending colon. In dogs and cats, the large intestine contributes 20% to 25% of the total (small and large) intestinal length. 1, 2 The arterial blood supply to the colon is provided by the cranial and caudal mesenteric arteries, and venous return from the colon is transmitted to the main portal vein via the cranial and caudal mesenteric veins. Lymph is circulated from the colon to the right, middle, and left colic lymph nodes, and eventually into the cisterna chyli and thoracic duct. Parasympathetic innervation arises from the vagus nerve in the proximal colon, and from the pelvic nerves in the distal colon. Sympathetic innervation arises from the paravertebral ganglia and follows the lumbar splanchnic nerves and mesenteric arteries to the colonic mucosa and muscularis. Parasympathetic preganglionic fibers and sympathetic postganglionic fibers synapse on cell bodies and neurons of the enteric nervous system, respectively.",

However, numerous straight tubular glands (400 to 600 \u00b5m) are present in parallel cylinders and they extend from the muscularis mucosa to the mucosal surface. 3 The glands are lined by a continuous sheet of columnar epithelial cells, which are separated from the mesenchymal tissue of the lamina propria by a well-defined basement membrane. The epithelium in the lower half of the crypts is composed of proliferating undifferentiated columnar cells, mucussecreting goblet cells, and at least three types of endocrine epithelial cells. 4 Cellular proliferation is predominantly in the lower part of the crypts in both dogs and cats. The epithelium of the upper half of the crypts consists of differentiating columnar cells, goblet cells, and a few endocrine cells. The flat absorptive surface is lined by many columnar cells as well as a moderate number of goblet cells (10 to 25 goblet cells per 100 epithelial cells), 3, 5 most of which are largely depleted of their mucous granules. Intraepithelial lymphocytes are relatively sparsely distributed throughout the epithelium (one to seven lymphocytes per 100 epithelial cells), 3, 5 and as in the small intestine, the predominant T cell subset is the cytotoxicsuppressor (CD8+) type. 6, 7 The cellular elements of the lamina propria of the large intestine resemble closely those found in the small intestine and include lymphocytes, many plasma cells, mast cells, macrophages, eosinophils, enteric neurons, and fibroblasts.",

For example, the protein and fiber content of the diet have significant effects on colonic mucosal morphology (e.g., crypt depth and cellularity). [14] [15] [16] The pathologist should always take these factors into account when interpreting colonic biopsy specimens. The method of biopsy also influences the architecture and cellularity of the mucosa. Compared to full-thickness biopsies, gland length is 25% to 30% shorter and goblet cell numbers are 70% to 75% less in endoscopic biopsies from the same animals.

As in the small intestine, appropriate interactions between these different cell types are essential in generating either immune responsiveness or tolerance to the large array of luminal antigens. 26, 27 Much less is known about colonic immunity, but some generalizations may be made. In the colon, CD8+ T cells are found primarily in the epithelium; very few CD8+ T cells are found in the lamina propria or submucosa. Most intraepithelial lymphocytes are CD3+/CD8+, a phenotype consistent with suppressor-cytotoxic functions. Lamina propria T cells on the other hand are predominantly of the CD4+ helper phenotype. Immunoglobulin (Ig) A-containing plasma cells are more prominent than IgG-or IgM-containing plasma cells in the lamina propria. Thus, in the normal colonic mucosa, a balance would appear to be maintained between helper and suppressor T-cell populations, which allows specific antigen responsiveness while avoiding hyperreactivity. 5, 6, 28 There are many similarities in the immune systems at both sites, but there are important differences in the immune response of the small and large intestine.",

Sodium transport also differs in the colon. Glucose-and amino-acid-stimulated sodium transport is a well-established property of the small intestine, so much so that oral glucoseelectrolyte solutions have been used to reduce the morbidity of cholera and other infectious diarrheal diseases of the small intestine. In contrast, glucose-coupled sodium transport does not take place in the colon and glucose-electrolyte solutions are of no benefit in diarrheal diseases of the large intestine. Sodium transport in the colon instead relies upon electrogenic transport. 20, 21 The large intestine also differs in its response to mineralocorticoids. Aldosterone markedly increases sodium transport in the colon, but it has only a modest effect in the small intestine.

            "text": "The colon has evolved to serve two important functions: extraction of water and electrolytes from the luminal contents in the ascending and transverse colon, and control of defecation in the descending colon. This specialization of function is attributed to regional differences in colonic motility patterns. [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] Electrical slow-wave frequency and rhythmic phasic contractions are slower in the proximal portion of the colon, thus facilitating extraction of water from the fecal mass by diffusion and active transport. Retrograde giant contractions (RGCs) and antiperistalsis further facilitate the mixing of contents in the proximal colon. In contrast to that of the proximal colon, motility of the distal colon is characterized primarily by migrating spike bursts and powerful giant migrating contractions (GMCs) that propagate the fecal mass toward the rectum. 4, 33 Colonic smooth muscle generates at least four different types of contractions to perform the complex motility functions of mixing and propulsion: (a) tone, (b) rhythmic phasic contractions (RPCs), (c) RGCs, and (d) GMCs. The time course, frequency, and force generated by each of these contractions are significantly different from each other. [30] [31] [32] [33] The precise role of tone in circular muscle cells is not known, but the resulting decrease in the diameter of the colon may enhance the efficiency of the phasic contractions in mixing and propulsion. Tone is normally of small to moderate force and can last for prolonged periods of time (several minutes to hours). RPCs produce mixing and net slow distal propulsion of luminal contents in the postprandial and fasting state. Phasic contractions occur rhythmically at a few cycles per minute, last for approximately 3 to 5 seconds, and generate a moderate force (75 to 100 g). RGCs occur infrequently, last for approximately 20 seconds, generate a very strong force (>150 g), and are propagated from their point of origin into the ascending colon. RGCs facilitate mixing in the ascending colon. The GMCs are of a similar magnitude and frequency to the RGCs, but they generate mass movements from their point of origin to the anorectal junction. It has been suggested that different signal transduction pathways are used by smooth muscle cells to trigger different contractions. 34, 35 It is remarkable that the same smooth muscle cells can generate so many different types of contractions using a limited number of second messengers.",

Abdominal ultrasound may also be used to facilitate percutaneous aspiration of luminal masses, mucosal thickenings, and lymph nodes. 8, 9 Computed tomography (CT) colonography, also known as virtual colonoscopy, has been successfully implemented in human medicine, and has been studied experimentally in the dog. 10 advanced through the descending colon to the splenic flexure. To facilitate passage of the endoscope through the splenic flexure, the tip of the endoscope is deflected slightly upward, and the endoscope is pushed into the transverse colon. The transverse colonic mucosa is now more visible as the endoscope enters the short, straight segment of the transverse colon. At the hepatic flexure, the tip of the endoscope is deflected caudally to enter the ascending colon. While keeping the tip of the endoscope in the center of the lumen, the endoscope is advanced the full length of the ascending colon into the cecum and ileocecal sphincter. The cecum is easily inspected, and the endoscope is then advanced through the ileocecal sphincter to evaluate the distal ileum. Endoscopic biopsies may be obtained at each sequential site or during withdrawal of the endoscope at the end of the study (see Chapter 27) . Diseased tissue, nondiseased tissue, and the transition zone between diseased and nondiseased tissue should be biopsied during colonoscopic procedures. This standard helps to verify the extent of the disease, ensures that disease in the submucosa has not been missed, and provides representative tissue samples to the pathologist to diagnose the disease. 15 In some cases of severe IBD or colonic neoplasia, advanced tissue necrosis may prevent the diagnosis of the disease process in the central part of the lesion. In the absence of gross mucosal abnormalities, three to five biopsy specimens should be obtained from each of the mid-ascending, mid-transverse, and mid-descending colonic regions (see Chapter 29) .",

The tip of the endoscope is introduced into the anorectal canal, and air is insufflated to dilate the anorectal and colonic lumen. As with upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, the tip of the endoscope should never be advanced unless the lumen is in full view. While inspecting the colonic mucosa, the endoscope is inhibition of allergic responses to food allergens and protection of mucosal barrier function. 4, 5 Polymorphisms in the genes encoding TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, and TLR6 are associated with an increased risk for development of IBD in human patients and in murine animal models. 4, 5 NOD and TLRs are also a focus of attention in canine chronic enteropathies. Cultured primary canine colonocytes can express NOD2, TLR2, and TLR4 when stimulated by their respective ligands. 6 In a study investigating TLR expression profiles in endoscopic biopsies, it was found that dogs with chronic enteropathies that needed steroid treatment to keep their symptoms controlled had increased levels of TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression compared with healthy dogs. 7 However, no difference in TLR expression was detected between biopsies sampled before and after clinically successful therapy, regardless of whether dogs had been treated with diet or steroids. 7, 8 Another study identified a correlation between clinical severity of disease and expression of TLR mRNA. Duodenal mucosal mRNA expression of TLR2 was markedly increased in dogs with clinically severe IBD when compared with healthy controls, and TLR2 expression was correlated with clinical severity of diseases in a linear fashion. 8 Breed differences in TLR expression profiles have been reported in dogs with IBD. German Shepherd Dogs (GSD) with IBD have increased levels of TLR4 mRNA and decreased levels of TLR5 mRNA in the intestine compared to healthy greyhounds. 8a Differences in TLR expression mimic those reported in people with Crohn's disease and have prompted genetic investigations into polymorphisms of pattern recognition receptors in dogs with IBD. In GSDs, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TLR4 and TLR5 have been associated with an increased incidence of IBD. 8b SNPs in TLR5 are associated with increased risk of development of IBD in 38 other breeds, and have been shown to be functionally hyper-responsive in GSD. This particular mutation may play a role in the pathogenesis of IBD in dogs in general. 8b Finally, although it does not appear that food antigens play a direct role in the pathogenesis of human IBD, various dietary components can exert deleterious or beneficial effects on the intestinal microflora and on the intestinal mucosa, making it plausible that dietary changes could influence the inflammatory process in the mucosa of dogs with IBD. 9 To date, the effects of dietary antigens on canine and feline IBD have not been studied in detail. However, dietary treatment is viewed by most as an integral part of the therapeutic approach to chronic inflammatory GI diseases.",

Immunohistochemical studies have shown T and B lymphocytes, as well as IgG-positive plasma cells to be increased in the colonic mucosa of dogs with IBD. [9] [10] [11] Semiquantitative RT-PCR has been used to evaluate cytokine mRNA expression in colonic mucosal biopsies. Human ulcerative colitis patients typically show a Th2 dominated inflammatory response. 2 In one study the prevailing cytokine mRNA expression pattern in dogs was that of a Th1 immune response. 12 Nevertheless, the accuracy of these results has since been questioned, at least in the duodenal mucosa, where the more reliable quantitative realtime RT-PCR showed a lack of difference in cytokine mRNA expression between healthy dogs and dogs with IBD. 13 However, colonic cytokine mRNA expression has not been investigated again using the more accurate amplification techniques, and it is prudent not to overinterpret the results from the initial study. To date there are no published data about cytokine expression in feline colitis, but duodenal mucosa of cats with IBD revealed a complex pattern of cytokine mRNA expression with a possible increase in Th1 cytokine mRNA expression. 14, 15 Inflammatory Bowel Disease Definition IBD is an idiopathic inflammatory disorder affecting the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of dogs and cats. Canine and feline IBD can be defined on the basis of clinical and histopathologic criteria. Clinically, IBD is diagnosed in animals with chronic (longer than 3 weeks' duration) GI signs such as anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea (small and/or large bowel in origin), and weight loss for which no other known cause of gastroenterocolitis can be documented. Therefore, affected animals fail to respond to symptomatic treatment, including parasiticides, antibiotics, and diet. 1 In addition, histopathologic evaluation reveals inflammatory infiltration of the colonic mucosa with predominantly round cells (lymphocytic plasmacytic colitis), eosinophils (eosinophilic colitis), neutrophils (suppurative or neutrophilic colitis), macrophages (granulomatous colitis), or a combination thereof. The inflammatory process can solely involve the colon (colitis) or affect the whole GI tract (enterocolitis).",

They are an important component of the innate immune system. In the GI tract, specific TLRs are found located on epithelial cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. TLR2 recognizes bacterial lipopeptides, TLR4 is activated by lipopolysaccharides, and unmethylated cytosine-phosphate diester-guanine Cpg DNA found in prokaryotic genomes and DNA viruses act as ligand for the intracellular receptor, TLR9. 4, 5 Once activated, TLRs elicit an intracellular signaling cascade leading to the production of proinflammatory cytokines. However, the physiologic function of TLRs in the GI tract includes maintaining hyporesponsiveness to innocuous luminal commensals, Colonic inflammation disrupts these normal events. It may decrease the total absorptive capacity of the mucosa through loss of functional colonocytes, increased epithelial permeability and disturbance of sodium and chloride transport. 19 Additionally, colitis has direct effects on colonic motility. The colon exhibits three types of contractions: While the individual phasic contractions and the migrating and nonmigrating motor complexes produce extensive mixing and kneading of fecal material and slow net distal propulsion, the giant motor complexes (GMCs) produce mass movements and expel feces during defecation. 20 In an experimental model, dogs with acute colitis had a decrease in nonpropulsive motility and an increase in GMCs, resulting in frequent defecation and tenesmus. 21 Decreased nonpropulsive motility may be explained by disturbances of the circular colonic smooth muscle cells associated with inflammation. These include impairment of calcium mobilization, [22] [23] [24] changes in expression of key signaling molecules for excitationcontraction coupling, 25 inhibition of muscarinic signaling, 26 and increased transcription of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB). 27 Finally, absorptive and motility disorders may change the composition of the luminal commensal flora, which plays an important role in the maintenance of colonic function, and therefore contribute to further deterioration.",

In humans, as well as in dogs and cats, adverse reactions to food can result from immunologic (food allergy) and nonimmunologic (food intolerance) mechanisms. 16 So far, in small animals, the clinical differentiation between food allergy and food intolerance relies heavily on restricted antigen dietary trials. 17, 18 All dogs and cats with GI manifestations of adverse reaction to food get better when fed a novel diet, especially if it is designed to avoid antigens from their original diet. When challenged with their original food, they all show a relapse of GI signs. However, only food-allergic dogs and cats also relapse when their low-allergen diet is supplemented with proteins from a single source such as beef, chicken, milk, or any protein that was part of their original offending food. 17 Finally, a number of animals with colitis may simply benefit from being fed a highly digestible diet. These dogs and cats may have mild IBD that responds to the novel diet, which usually also offers additional benefits, such as an improved ratio of n6-to-n3 fatty acids or the presence of prebiotics. These animals usually do not experience a relapse when fed their original diet.",

Cytologic examination of rectal scrapings can reveal the presence of Histoplasma capsulatum, large numbers of neutrophils, a sign of inflammation, or increased numbers of Gram-positive rods (suggestive of overgrowth with C. perfringens). 34 Usually, diagnostic imaging (radiographs and ultrasonography) is not very helpful in cats and dogs with colitis. It may however yield useful information if the disease extends to the small intestine. When the diagnostic elimination process confirms the possibility of large intestinal IBD, evaluation of the disease severity is desirable and best performed by colonoscopy (preceded by gastroduodenoscopy in cases with small and large bowel involvement). Full endoscopic examination of the colon requires general anesthesia but remains a safe diagnostic procedure. 35 Flexible colonoscopy allows full visualization of the rectum and descending and ascending colon, as well as cecum and ileocolic junction. Additionally, it is often possible to pass the endoscope into the ileum. Changes noticed during colonoscopy may include an increase in friability, granularity, or hyperemia; changes in the numbers of lymphoid follicles; decreased visualization of submucosal blood vessels; localized colonic spasms; and localized erosions. 31 Significant edema and inflammatory infiltrate may give the mucosa a honeycomb appearance ( Figure 58-7) ; however, the colonic mucosa may also appear normal. 31 The endoscopic procedure also makes it possible to collect mucosal biopsies to evaluate the histopathologic appearance of the mucosa. As the colon can usually be easily distended, it is advisable to use an endoscope with a large-bore biopsy channel that makes the use of large biopsy forceps possible (\u22652.8 mm diameter). Rigid proctoscopy/colonoscopy is an alternative method for procuring good size colonic mucosal samples.",

This may be different in animals with generalized GI inflammation: leukocytosis with neutrophilia and left shift, hypoproteinemia with hypoalbuminemia and hypoglobulinemia, and mildly to moderately increased liver enzymes can all be present in such patients. Evaluation of acute phase reactants such as C-reactive protein in the serum has delivered mixed results, 1,28,32 and is not specific for GI inflammation. The precise clinical relevance of serum markers of autoimmunity such as perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies still remains to be determined in dogs with IBD, but they may be suggestive of diet-responsive disease. 33 A parasitologic examination of one or several fecal samples is necessary to rule out parasite infestation. Alternatively, empirical treatment the mucosal barrier, including an intact epithelial cell lining; the host immune system consisting of innate immunity and adaptive immunity; and microbes and food antigens in the intestinal lumen. The interplay of these three factors is important to maintain intestinal homeostasis. In the normal case scenario, antigen-presenting cells continuously sample antigens from the intestinal lumen through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Depending on the nature of these antigens, the signals elicited by the antigen-presenting cells drive the adaptive immune response in the appropriate direction to eradicate a pathogen. For example, in the case of a parasite, naive T cells are preferentially driven to differentiate into T-helper (Th) 2 cells that recruit eosinophils, basophils, and mast cells to kill the parasites. In the case of a pathogenic virus, the naive T cells preferentially differentiate into Th1 cells that produce cytokines such as interferon (IFN)-\u03b3. These cytokines recruit macrophages that phagocytose and kill intracellular viruses. In the case of pathogenic bacteria being recognized, naive T cells preferentially differentiate into Th17 cells to produce proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-22. This recruits T cells and neutrophils to kill extracellular bacteria. In the case of commensal bacteria being recognized through PRRs, naive T cells preferentially differentiate into T-regulatory cells that counteract the effect of proinflammatory cytokines produced by Th17 cells. B, In the case of IBD, a primary defect in the recognition of commensals or certain pathogens by innate immune receptors may play a causative role. Mutations in PRRs lead to misrepresentation of commensals as pathogens, leading to the massive production of IL-23, driving naive T cells to differentiate into Th17 cells. These Th17 cells then produce large amounts of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-17, IL-22, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). This leads to tissue destruction and epithelial cell injury, letting even more antigens pass through to the lamina propria. This inflammatory response cannot be counterregulated by regulatory T cells, leading to the characteristic inflammatory pattern seen in IBD. protein or on hydrolyzed peptides), 28, 40 and highly digestible, lowresidue diets. 29, 39 Most dogs and cats with colitis respond within 2 weeks to a diet change, some however may require up to 6 weeks. It is important to communicate the importance of exclusive feeding of the diet to the animal's owner, especially if an elimination diet is chosen. Recommendations regarding the required duration of dietary therapy after clinical remission diverge significantly. Although in one study most dogs relapsed after being fed their original pretreatment diet again, 39 many of the dogs could be switched again to their pretreatment diet after varying time periods in another study. 28 Consequently, it is important to discuss the risks and benefits of a reexposure to the regular diet with the patient's owners in each case to enable them to make an informed decision about their pet.",

The addition of soluble fiber to the diet has provided additional benefits in clinical studies of canine and feline chronic colitis. 30, 31 Fermentable fibers are metabolized to short-chain fatty acids by the large intestinal flora and provide a useful source of energy to the colonocytes. Overall, they enhance structure and function of the intestinal epithelium. 41 Examples of fermentable fibers include beet pulp, psyllium, and fructooligosaccharides. Fructooligosaccharides are oligosaccharides that resist digestion in the small intestine and are fermented by the colonic bacterial flora. Their beneficial effects on the large intestine include proliferation of colonocytes by increasing blood flow to the colonic mucosa and promotion of epithelial cell differentiation into fully functional colonocytes. 41 Additionally, fructooligosaccharides are prebiotics and therefore are able to influence the composition of the large bowel commensal flora. In cats, they were reported to increase colonic fecal concentrations of Bacteroides and Lactobacillus spp. and decrease those of E. coli and C. perfringens. 42 Finally, dietary fibers also have beneficial effects on colonic motility. As a tradeoff, addition of fiber to the diet may have a negative impact on nutrient digestibility, depending on the specific fiber type. Some fibers may also delay gastric emptying time and slow small intestinal transit time. 41 Psyllium is a soluble fiber derived from the seed of Plantago ovata. It has great waterholding capacities and forms gels in water, two properties that can contribute to improvement of fecal consistency. Psyllium was very efficient when added to a highly digestible diet in the treatment of chronic idiopathic colitis using the following initial daily dosage: 0.5 tablespoons (T) for toy breeds, 1 T for small dogs, 2 T for medium dogs, and 3 T for large dogs. 31 The fiber supplement should be administered with each meal, and the dose adapted to effect.",

Among antimicrobials, metronidazole is frequently used in the initial management of dogs and cats with colitis. Beside its antimicrobial effects against a variety of obligate anaerobic bacteria, metronidazole is also effective against Giardia spp. Furthermore, metronidazole has immunomodulatory effects. 45 It is used in dogs and cats with colitis to modify the intestinal flora (decrease in obligate anaerobes) and decrease inflammation. If a suspension is administered to a cat, metronidazole HCl is not a palatable formulation and may elicit ptyalism and anorexia. Metronidazole benzoate is the preferable formulation for feline patients, but it contains only 62% metronidazole and therefore requires a dose adjustment. Other side effects of metronidazole are rare, although cats may be more susceptible because of the probable increased half-life of the drug, and include vomiting and diarrhea. Hepatotoxicity and neurotoxicity have been reported at higher dosages. 45 Sulfasalazine consists of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA; also called mesalamine [United States] or mesalazine [Europe]) linked by an azo bond to sulfapyridine, a sulfonamide compound. 46 Most of the orally administered sulfasalazine reaches the distal small intestine and colon unchanged. There, the microbial flora breaks the azo bond and liberates both molecules. Sulfapyridine is essentially a carrier molecule and is not thought to unfold any therapeutic effect. It is absorbed, metabolized in the liver, and filtered through the kidneys. The antiinflammatory effects of 5-ASA on the colonic mucosa are associated with inhibition of cyclooxygenase and a decrease in prostaglandin and leukotriene synthesis. Moreover, 5-ASA is an activator of peroxisome proliferator-activating receptor (PPAR)-\u03b3. 46 In dogs, PPAR-\u03b3 are expressed at a high level in gastric, duodenal, and colonic mucosal epithelial cells. 47 They inhibit pathways leading to increased NF-\u03baB transcription and hence to production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. 46 However, recent ",

Electron microscopy of HUC lesions allowed identification and localization of the bacteria to the intracellular compartment of PAS positive macrophages. 65 Additionally, the intracellular material found in PAS-positive macrophages from dogs with HUC was positively labeled with polyclonal antibodies against E. coli. 66 Further classification of the virulence genes and biologic behavior of these bacteria in coculture with epithelial cells and macrophages revealed specific adhesive and invasive properties. 65 The E. coli strains associated with HUC have a similar phenotype with adhesive and invasive behavior resembling E. coli isolates that were recently associated with Crohn's disease in people. 65 In several studies, a particular strain of E. coli (LF82) could be detected in biopsies of 20% to 35% of ileal lesions in Crohn's disease, but only in 6% of ileal samples from healthy controls or other colonic inflammatory diseases. 67 Crohn's disease affects primarily the mucosa and submucosa of the ileum and colon. It resembles canine HUC in its histologic appearance, as granulomas are the main feature of the disease. As in canine HUC, some cases of Crohn's disease are responsive to treatment with antibiotics. The E. coli strain LF82 that has increasingly been associated with Crohn's disease is unusual because it adheres to and invades intestinal epithelial cells in culture 68 and has been shown to replicate within the phagolysosomes of macrophages in the granulomatous lesions 69 instead of being cleared by the adaptive immune system. There is evidence that the adhesive and invasive E. coli associated with HUC are taken up by endosomes and persist in the macrophages instead of being cleared. 65 These findings support the hypothesis that genetics play a major role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease, and has led to recent genome-wide association studies in canine HUC. Certain defects in pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) of the innate immune system have long been known to be associated with the development of Crohn's disease. 70 These receptors are important for the interaction of the mucosal innate immune system with the microflora of the intestinal lumen. The default response of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue is to clear offending pathogens, but to tolerate commensal organisms from the intestinal lumen. 71 Recent evidence confirms that polymorphisms in certain PRRs, such as NOD2, result in a disturbed response of human monocytes to E. coli LF82, linking genetics with functional disease for the first time. 72 Preliminary results from genetic studies in Boxers with HUC and healthy controls point to a defect in a protein in neutrophils that leads to defective clearance in E. coli in macrophages.",

If sulfasalazine is used, it can often be discontinued after a few weeks. However, there is a risk of recurrence when the animals are switched back to their original diet or a commercial diet. Therefore, the owners of dogs and cats with colitis should be prepared to feed their pets a special diet in the long-term, and consider the financial implications of the prolonged treatment. In a few cases, colitis may be refractory to treatment. This is probably most common in cats showing predominantly large bowel diarrhea, while in reality they have a general involvement of their GI tract (enterocolitis).

In recent years two reports have sparked hope for treatment of HUC: a total of 35 cases have been described and have shown a dramatic response to treatment with enrofloxacin (5 mg/kg PO once daily), or a combination protocol with enrofloxacin, amoxicillin (20 mg/kg PO twice daily), and metronidazole (10 to 15 mg/kg PO twice daily). 56 Reports of the disease almost 30 years ago also occasionally described a good response to treatment with antibiotics, namely chloramphenicol and tetracycline. 76 The response to treatment with enrofloxacin in the more recent reports was dramatic, with all dogs responding within 3 to 12 days of initiating therapy. It is particularly encouraging that several dogs were reportedly disease-free after the drug had been discontinued following a 4-to 6-week course of treatment. 56 This implies that HUC can be cured in some cases. Five dogs were rebiopsied when they were in clinical remission after completion of the antibiotic treatment. A dramatic improvement in the histologic lesions was evident in all cases, with disappearance of PAS-positive macrophages in three dogs and marked reduction in the number of macrophages in the other two cases. 56 However, care must be taken to treat dogs with HUC long enough to avoid relapse after discontinuation of treatment. In addition, it may be prudent to send intestinal biopsies for culture and sensitivity before starting treatment, so that the use of antibiotics can be tailored to the specific sensitivity profile of the cultured E. coli. 75a,77",

When ova are excreted in feces and come into contact with water, they give rise to miracidia that penetrate susceptible snails to reinitiate the cycle. The presence of ova in the submucosa of the small intestine and colon elicits an intense granulomatous tissue reaction. 2 Lesions are characterized by epithelioid macrophages, usually surrounding parasitic ova, admixed with varying amounts eosinophils, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. 1, 2 Ova that do not make it to the intestinal lumen may be hematogenously disseminated to distant sites, particularly via the portal vein to hepatic venules where ova-induced chronic inflammation can lead to hepatic fibrosis and organ failure.

Signs of inappetence, weight loss progressing to cachexia, and bloody diarrhea of small bowel (melena) or large bowel (hematochezia) origin are common. Physical examination findings may include thickened loops of intestine, abdominal effusion, peripheral edema, and mild generalized lymphadenopathy. Dermatitis caused by cercarial penetration of the skin or coughing because of lung migration are uncommonly reported. Clinicopathologic abnormalities include anemia, hyperglobulinemia, hypoalbuminemia, eosinophilia, and proteinuria. Dogs with Heterobilharzia infection may present with clinical signs arising from moderate to severe hypercalcemia. 1, 6 In 2 dogs with Heterobilharzia infection, and lack of evidence for malignancy, hypercalcemia was attributed to elevated parathyroid hormone-related peptide concentrations. 6 chronic fistulation is frequently observed in people with Crohn disease. Moreover, PRRs are thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of IBD in people and dogs, and have been the object of recent research in dogs with AF. One study found dysfunctional NOD2 responses in German Shepherd dogs with AF. 80 Moreover, a restricted allelic variation in TLR1, TLR5, and TLR6 was found in German Shepherd dogs. However, there were no significant associations between these PRR polymorphisms and AF. Nevertheless, these polymorphisms may influence innate immune responses in German Shepherd dogs and may be an important predisposing factor for the development of AF in that breed. 81 In other studies, increased prevalence of a specific haplotype of alleles of genes encoding class II molecules of the canine MHC was shown in German Shepherd dogs with AF, suggesting a possible defect in antigen presentation associated with the disease. 82 Finally, it is noteworthy that feeding a restricted antigen diet maintained more than 80% of dogs with AF in complete remission after en bloc surgical excision and anal sacculectomy, 83 and that both AF and IBD respond to treatment of immunosuppressive drugs such as prednisone and cyclosporine. 84 These similarities underline the possibility of a comparable pathomechanism for both diseases.",

T. foetus trophozoites are often misdiagnosed as Giardia and can be difficult to distinguish from nonpathogenic trichomonads such as Penta trichomonas hominis. If repeated direct microscopic examination results are negative for T. foetus, feces may be cultured in commercially available pouches marketed for diagnosis of T. foetus infection in cattle (In Pouch TF, Biomed Diagnostics, White City, OR). Neither Giardia spp. nor P. hominis organisms survived in In Pouch TF for longer than 24 hours in one study; consequently, positive cultures are strongly suggestive of T. foetus infection. 30 A sensitive and specific single-tube nested PCR based on amplification of a conserved portion of the T. foetus ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene unit from feline feces is commercially available (http://www.JodyGookin.com).

However, multisegmental lesions and diffuse involvement of the GI tract have been described.

Cutaneous lesions consist of nonhealing wounds and invasive masses that contain ulcerated nodules and draining tracts. 45 Diagnosis A tentative diagnosis of gastrointestinal pythiosis is made by deep wedge biopsy of affected segments of intestine wherein broad, sparsely septate, and occasionally branching hyphae are demonstrated after staining with Gomori methenamine silver or anti-P. insidiosum antibodies. 45 Definitive diagnosis of P. insidiosum can be made using a species-specific nested PCR assay applied to DNA extracted from cultured isolates, appropriately preserved tissue samples (frozen at \u221270\u00b0C (\u221294\u00b0F) and stored in 95% ethanol at room temperature), or paraffin-embedded specimens.

Their role in causation of disease is still poorly understood. In dogs, three major groups of spirochetes have been identified in feces on the basis of selective culture, multilocus enzyme electrophoresis, and 16S rRNA gene sequence data: B. pilosicoli, Brachyspira canis, and Brachyspira alvinipulli. 52, 53 Pathophysiology Pathogenic spirochetes intimately attach to the apical membrane of cecal and colonic epithelial cells. The mechanism(s) by which their cellular interaction results in diarrhea remains unclear. Spirochetes can be found in large numbers in the colonic crypts of normal dogs. In dogs with diarrhea, spirochetes can appear in the feces in large numbers. Whether the spirochetes are causal to the diarrhea or alternatively, mechanically dislodged from the crypts by diarrhea induced by other etiologic factors, remains an area of active debate. In a small number of cases, it has been observed that B. pilosicoli can be isolated from dogs with diarrhea and intestinal spirochetosis, whereas B. canis were commonly isolated from healthy dogs. 53, 54 Furthermore, B. pilosicoli will attach to cecal epithelial cells from chicks, whereas B. canis will not. 55 Accordingly, the current presumption is that B. pilosicoli may be pathogenic and B. canis commensal. A characteristic, but not invariable feature of B. pilosicoli infection is the attachment of one pole of the spirochete to the intestinal epithelium, resulting in a dense \"false brush-border.\" 53, 56 Other pathologic changes include colonic inflammation, thickening of the colonic mucosa, and enlarged Peyer patches and lymphoid follicles.",

Both toxins mediate glycosylation and inactivation of Rho-GTPases (guanosine triphosphatases), resulting in depolymerization of F-actin, loss of epithelial integrity, and cell death. In the lamina propria, toxin A stimulates the synthesis of prostaglandins by macrophages, release of substance P, and degranulation of mast cells. Collectively these effects promote intestinal fluid loss and inflammation. There have been no studies to date evaluating the sensitivity of canine intestinal epithelia to either toxin A or B.",

In dogs, infection is most commonly acquired through the practice of feeding raw, 90,91 dehydrated (e.g., dog chews made from animal hide 92 ), or improperly cooked meat products. Salmonella spp. were isolated from 80% of samples taken from a bones-and-raw-food diet and from 30% of fecal samples from dogs fed the diet. 91 A conservative prevalence of Salmonella infection in clinically healthy or hospitalized dogs is 1% to 36% and from healthy cats is 1% to 18%. 93 Pathophysiology Following ingestion, Salmonella adhere via fimbriae to intestinal epithelial cells and M cells. Salmonella translocates bacterial proteins into these host cells by virtue of a type III secretion system. The translocated proteins interact with Rho-family guanosine triphosphate-binding proteins to facilitate internalization of the bacteria into host cell vesicles and stimulate host cell secretion of cytokines such as interleukin-8. A resulting influx of neutrophils transmigrate across the epithelium resulting in loss of barrier integrity. A fraction of Salmonella-containing vesicles are transported to the basolateral membrane where released Salmonella enters macrophages in which they multiply and disseminate systemically. Factors contributing to susceptibility to Salmonella infection include young age, nutritional deficiency, impaired immune defense, concurrent GI infection, and disruption of the normal intestinal flora (e.g., antibiotics) leading to loss of colonization resistance. Intestinal lesions are usually confined to the distal small bowel, cecum, and colon, and consist of mucosal inflammation and epithelial sloughing.",

Once the invagination has begun, its progress may be rapid, involving as much as several centimeters of intestinal tract within just a few hours. Invagination and intussusception result in luminal obstruction, which may be partial or complete. Obstruction usually results in distention of the bowel segment proximal to the intussusception. The degree of distention is dependent upon the completeness and duration of the obstruction, volume of fluid secretion, degree of vascular compromise, and volume of gas production from bacterial fermentation. Because the mesentery and blood supply are included in the invaginating segment, vascular compromise can occur, which initially leads to intramural hemorrhage and edema and eventually to ischemia and necrosis of the bowel. Full-thickness necrosis may ensue but perforations are rare.",

Exfoliative cytology during colonoscopy is particularly useful in diagnosing the disease. Histopathology is helpful if cytology is nondiagnostic or inconclusive. Multiple endoscopic colonic biopsies are usually sufficient to diagnose the disease. The yeast form does not stain well with routine hematoxylin and eosin stains, so special stains such as PAS and Gomori methenamine silver stain are often used to demonstrate organisms. Fungal culture from affected tissue can be used for diagnosis but is rarely needed in clinical cases.

In one study, itraconazole therapy cured histoplasmosis infections in all eight study cats. 13 Ketoconazole and amphotericin B have been described as the treatments of choice for canine histoplasmosis.

In infected tissue or when cultured at 30\u00b0C (86\u00b0F) to 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), the organism is a yeast. The fungus is endemic throughout most of the temperate and subtropical regions of the world. Most cases of histoplasmosis in the United States occur in the central states, with the geographic distribution following the Mississippi, Ohio, and Missouri Rivers. 10, 11 Pathophysiology Infection is probably via inhalation or ingestion of infective conidia from the environment. The respiratory system is thought to be the primary route of infection in cats and dogs, although the gastrointestinal tract may also be an important route in the dog. After inhalation or ingestion, conidia transform from the mycelial phase and are phagocytized by macrophages, where they grow as facultative intracellular organisms. Hematogenous and lymphatic dissemination results in multisystemic disease. Organisms can be disseminated to any organ system, but the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, lymph nodes, liver, spleen, bone marrow, eyes, and adrenal glands are the most common organs of dissemination in the dogs; lungs, liver, lymph nodes, eyes, and bone marrow are most commonly affected in cats. Cell-mediated immunity induces a granulomatous inflammatory response in most infection. 12 Clinical Examination Dogs with gastrointestinal histoplasmosis are typically presented with mild fever, anorexia, lethargy, weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, ",

Chitin is an essential component of the fungal cell wall, but it is generally lacking in the oomycete cell wall. Oomycetes also differ from fungi in that ergosterol is not a principal sterol in the oomycete cell membrane.

Definitive diagnosis requires histologic demonstration or immunohistochemical staining of the organism and/ or positive ELISA or PCR assays. The histologic findings associated with pythiosis generally are characterized by eosinophilic granulomatous to pyogranulomatous inflammation with fibrosis. Affected tissue typically contain multiple foci of necrosis surrounded and infiltrated by neutrophils, eosinophils, and macrophages. Discrete granulomas composed of epithelioid macrophages, plasma cells, multinucleate giant cells, and neutrophils and eosinophils may also be observed. Pythium zoospores may be cultured directly from affected tissue in antibiotic-containing (e.g., streptomycin and ampicillin) media. More recently, sensitive and specific ELISA and PCR assays have been developed for the accurate diagnosis of pythiosis in dogs.

Hypertrophic megacolon, on the other hand, develops as a consequence of obstructive lesions (e.g., malunion of pelvic fractures, tumors, foreign bodies). Hypertrophic megacolon may be reversible with early pelvic osteotomy or it may progress to irreversible dilated megacolon if appropriate therapy is not instituted. 5 Constipation and obstipation are earlier manifestations of the same problem. Constipation is defined as the infrequent difficult evacuation of feces but does not necessarily imply a permanent loss of function. Many cats suffer from one or two episodes of constipation without further progression. Intractable constipation that has become refractory to cure or control is referred to as obstipation. The term obstipation implies a permanent loss of function. A cat is assumed to be obstipated only after several consecutive treatment failures. Recurring episodes of constipation or obstipation may culminate in the syndrome of megacolon.",

Some cats are observed making multiple, unproductive attempts to defecate in the litterbox, while other cats may sit in the litterbox for prolonged periods of time without assuming a defecation posture. Dry, hardened feces are observed inside and outside of the litterbox. Occasionally, chronically constipated cats have intermittent episodes of hematochezia or diarrhea as a result of the mucosal irritant effect of fecal concretions.

First or second episodes of constipation in some cats may be severe and generalized but may still resolve with appropriate treatment. Ancillary studies may be indicated in some cases. Extraluminal mass lesions may be further evaluated by abdominal ultrasonography and guided biopsy, whereas intraluminal mass lesions are best evaluated by endoscopy. Colonoscopy may also be used to evaluate the colon and anorectum for suspected inflammatory lesions, strictures, sacculations, and diverticula. Barium enema contrast radiography may be used if colonoscopy is not possible. Both colonoscopy and barium-contrast enema radiography require general anesthesia and evacuation of impacted feces. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis, CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and electrophysiologic studies should be considered in animals with evidence of neurologic impairment. Finally, colonic biopsy or anorectal manometry will be necessary to diagnose suspected cases of aganglionic megacolon.",

First episodes are often transient and resolve without therapy. Mild to moderate or recurrent episodes of constipation, on the other hand, usually require some medical intervention. These cases may be managed, often on an outpatient basis, with dietary modification, water enemas, oral or suppository laxatives, and/or colonic prokinetic agents (Table 58-9 ). Severe cases of constipation usually require brief periods of hospitalization to correct metabolic abnormalities and to evacuate impacted feces using water enemas, manual extraction of retained feces, or both. Followup therapy in such cases is directed at correcting predisposing factors and preventing recurrence. Subtotal colectomy will become necessary in cats suffering from obstipation or idiopathic dilated megacolon. These cats, by definition, are unresponsive to medical therapy. Pelvic osteotomy without colectomy may be sufficient for some cats suffering from pelvic canal stenosis and hypertrophic megacolon. 9 Figure 58 -15 provides an algorithm for the therapeutic approach to the constipated, obstipated, and megacolonic cat.",

Most of the available bulk-forming laxatives are dietary fiber supplements of poorly digestible polysaccharides and celluloses derived principally from cereal grains, wheat bran, and psyllium. Some constipated cats will respond to supplementation of the diet with one of these products, but many require adjunctive therapy (e.g., other types of laxatives or colonic prokinetic agents). 11 Fiber supplemented diets are available commercially, or the pet owner may wish to add psyllium (1 to 4 tsp per meal), wheat bran (1 to 2 tblsp per meal), or pumpkin (1 to 4 tblsp per meal) to canned cat food. Cats should be well hydrated before commencing fiber supplementation to maximize the therapeutic effect. Fiber supplementation is most beneficial in mildly constipated cats, prior to the development of obstipation and megacolon. In obstipated and megacolon cats, fiber may in fact be detrimental. Low-residue diets may be more beneficial in obstipated and megacolonic cats. Emollient Laxatives. Emollient laxatives are anionic detergents that increase the miscibility of water and lipid in digesta, thereby enhancing lipid absorption and impairing water absorption. Dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate and dioctyl calcium sulfosuccinate are examples of emollient laxatives available in oral and enema form. Dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate at a dosage of 30 mg/kg/day had no effect on fecal consistency in Beagle dogs. 12 Lubricant Laxatives. Mineral oil and white petrolatum are the two major lubricant laxatives available for the treatment of Dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate or petrolatum and/or mosapride gastric emptying, and enhances small intestinal and colonic propulsive motility. 12, 22 Cisapride enhances colonic propulsive motility through activation of colonic neuronal or smooth muscle 5-HT receptors in a number of animal species. 23, 24 In vitro studies show that cisapride stimulates feline colonic smooth muscle contraction, 7,24 although it has not yet been conclusively shown that cisapride stimulates feline colonic propulsive motility in vivo. Anecdotal experiences suggest that cisapride is effective in stimulating colonic propulsive motility in cats affected with mild to moderate idiopathic constipation; cats with long-standing obstipation and megacolon are unlikely to show much improvement with cisapride therapy. Cisapride was widely used in the management of feline colonic motility disorders throughout most of the 1990s, 22, 25, 26 until it was withdrawn from the American, Canadian, and certain Western European markets in July 2000 following reports of untoward cardiac side effects in human patients. Cisapride causes QT interval prolongation and slowing of cardiac repolarization via blockade of the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium channel (I Kr ). 27 This effect may result in a fatal ventricular arrhythmia referred to as torsades de pointes. Similar effects have been characterized in canine cardiac Purkinje fibers, 28 but in vivo effects have not yet been reported in dogs or cats. The withdrawal of cisapride has created a clear need for new GI prokinetic agents although cisapride continues to be available from compounding pharmacies throughout the United States and other countries. A recent evidence-based data review of cisapride's efficacy in the treatment of human constipation and constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) was carried out by the Cochrane Collaboration. 29 The authors concluded that \"no clear benefit could be demonstrated with cisapride.\" 29 Tegaserod is a potent partial nonbenzamide agonist at 5-HT 4 receptors and a weak agonist at 5-HT 1D receptors. 30, 31 Tegaserod has definite prokinetic effects in the canine colon, but its effects in the feline colon are not known. Intravenous doses of tegaserod (0.03 to 0.3 mg/kg) accelerate colonic transit in dogs during the first hour after intravenous administration. 30 Tegaserod at doses of 3 to 6 mg/kg PO has also been shown to normalize intestinal transit in opioid-induced bowel dysfunction in dogs, 32 suggesting it could prove useful in other disorders of intestinal ileus or pseudoobstruction. Eventually, tegaserod was also shown to prolong the QT interval and delay cardiac repolarization as had been reported with cisapride. Tegaserod was marketed under the trade name of Zelnorm in the United States in September 2002 and subsequently removed from American and other markets in 2006. As with many other drugs in companion animal medicine, tegaserod was not licensed for the treatment of canine or feline gastrointestinal motility disorders.",

Cats have a generally favorable prognosis for recovery following colectomy, although mild to moderate diarrhea may persist for weeks to months postoperatively in some cases. 42, 43 Pelvic osteotomy without colectomy has been recommended for cats with pelvic fracture malunion and hypertrophic megacolon of less than 6 months duration. 44 Symphyseal distraction-osteotomy with spirally fashioned orthopedic wire has also been used in the surgical management of this disorder. 45 Pathologic hypertrophy may be reversible with early pelvic or symphyseal distraction osteotomy in such cases. Some surgeons still prefer colectomy in this instance because of the technical difficulty of some pelvic osteotomies. 46 Subtotal colectomy is an effective treatment for feline idiopathic megacolon or megacolon secondary to the mechanical obstruction created by old, healed pelvic fractures. Recommendations for removal of the ileocolic valve and ileum vary in cats with megacolon. The ileocolic blood vessels tether the distal ileum and proximal ascending colon, preventing anastomosis to the distal colon; thus if a complete colectomy is performed, these vessels must be sacrificed. This necessitates removing the ileum, which has important normal functions in water, vitamin B 12 , and bile salt resorption, and performing a jejunocolic anastomosis. In spite of this concern, postoperative intestinal function was normal in four cats evaluated after subtotal colectomy and jejunocolic anastomosis. 43, 47 The ileocolic valve also minimizes colonic bacterial access to the small intestine, 44 so preservation of the valve would be ideal to minimize small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and deconjugation of bile salts. However, preservation of the ileocolic junction necessitates leaving several centimeters of the ascending colon to ensure a tension-free anastomosis, possibly predisposing these cats to recurrent constipation. To evaluate these concerns, cats with megacolon treated with colectomy were studied retrospectively. Cats with excision of the ileocolic junction had significantly looser stool on long-term followup. 43 However there was no difference in the incidence of constipation between cats with preservation versus excision of the ileocolic junction. 48 This is perhaps explained by in vitro experiments with ascending and descending colonic smooth muscle from cats with clinical megacolon showing that smooth muscle dysfunction is less severe in the ascending colon. 8 When the ileocolic junction is preserved, the ascending colon is transected approximately 3 cm distal to the ileocolic junction to ensure a tension-free anastomosis. An end-to-end colocolostomy is performed using single interrupted sutures of 4-0 polydioxanone. 47 The successful use of a biofragmentable anastomosis ring has also been reported. 46 The omentum is wrapped around the anastomotic site and the abdomen is thoroughly lavaged with a warm, balanced electrolyte solution. All lavage fluid is aspirated from the peritoneal cavity before the incision is closed.",

Direct and indirect costs of IBS reach up to $30 billion per year in the United States alone. 49 IBS is commonly subdivided into different phenotypes depending upon the most prevalent bowel habit: diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D), constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C), and mixed features IBS (IBS-M). 50 Because of the inability of animal species to describe clinical symptoms such as abdominal pain and discomfort, IBS is not a very-well-defined syndrome in veterinary medicine. Nonetheless, recurring vomiting and diarrheal disorders are seen in companion animal species that are unaccompanied by mucosal morphologic change, and are presumed therefore to be of functional or physiological origin. 51 The reader is referred to Chapter 41 for a more detailed discussion of IBS and its management.",

Benign colonic neoplasia (e.g., adenomas, adenomatous polyps, and leiomyomas) also occur, although they are less common than malignant tumors. Malignant transformation of adenomatous polyps to carcinoma in situ and invasive adenocarcinoma has been demonstrated in the dog just as it has in humans. 1, 16, 17 Extramedullary plasmacytomas are uncommon tumors of the gastrointestinal tract, but many of these occur in the large intestine and rectum. 12, 13 All of the aforementioned tumors are associated with signs of inflammation and obstruction (e.g., hematochezia, tenesmus, and dyschezia).

The descending colon (39%) and the ileocolic sphincter (28%) are the most common sites of colonic neoplasia in the cat. Unlike colonic tumors in the dog, feline colonic tumors have a high rate (63%) of metastasis and, of course, metastasis is associated with decreased survival time.

Annular stenotic lesions associated with adenocarcinoma of the colon may manifest as proximal colonic dilation on survey radiographs. Radiographic contrast material more precisely outlines the narrowing of the lumen at the site of the tumor. Although still of some clinical utility, contrast studies have been largely superseded by ultrasonography and other imaging modalities. Ultrasonography is presently considered to be the most effective means of diagnosing colonic tumors in dogs and cats and appears to be useful in evaluating mural lesions and associated abdominal changes such as lymphadenopathy (Figure 58-16) . 33 Ultrasonography was reported to be useful 84% of the time in localizing feline colonic neoplasia in one study. 16 Ultrasonographic features of colonic tumors include transmural wall thickening with complete loss of the normal wall layering, fluid accumulation proximal to the lesion, and reduced regional motility. 33 Transabdominal fine-needle aspiration, peritoneal fluid cytology, and endoscopic exfoliative cytology may be useful in the diagnosis of lymphoma, but histopathology is generally required for a definitive diagnosis of other colonic neoplasia. CT and MRI scanning have not been sufficiently evaluated for reasonable comparisons to be made with ultrasonography. Flexible colonoscopy with mucosal biopsy is the preferred method of diagnosis for colonic neoplasia. Endoscopic abnormalities may include mass effect, mucosal bleeding, increased mucosal friability, erosions and ulcers, and circumferential luminal narrowing with submucosal infiltrative lesions. Multiple biopsy specimens should always be taken from diseased tissue, adjacent healthy tissue, as well as the transition zone between healthy and diseased tissue. With tumor necrosis, the pathologist has a much better chance of diagnosing and staging the disease by evaluating nonnecrotic tissue.",

Gastric ulcers are of greater prevalence in this circumstance, but colonic ulcers may be equally devastating. [1] [2] [3] [4] Affected dogs were most often Dachshunds with thoracolumbar disk disease treated with decompressive surgery and dexamethasone at doses of 0.25 to 4.4 mg/kg/day. Colonic ulcer is not a frequent complication of either intervertebral disk disease or corticosteroid therapy. In the initial report of the condition, colonic perforation was described in two dogs out of \"several thousand.\" 1 Ten additional cases were subsequently reported until 1986, 2-4 and since then no additional reports have been published. This may represent increased awareness of the condition, reluctance to publish on a previously described condition, or perhaps a shift away from the use of dexamethasone in dogs with intervertebral disk disease. Colonic perforation is infrequent in humans treated with corticosteroids for neurologic disease 5 but may occur more commonly when dexamethasone is used. 6 In nonneurologic conditions, the frequency of perforation is influenced by the underlying disease and the presence of a diverticulum in the sigmoid colon. 7 Why this lesion develops in some dogs but not others is not readily explained. made to rule out pulmonary metastatic disease. Abdominal ultrasonography is used to rule out abdominal metastatic disease and to guide aspiration and biopsy of enlarged iliac lymph nodes. Proctoscopy and colonoscopy often reveal the local extent of neoplastic disease. It is vital that colonoscopy be continued oral to rectal tumors as additional neoplasms are reported in the colon in a percentage of these cases. 38, 39 Mechanical cleansing is recommended before surgery of the large intestine in human, although preoperative enemas are contraindicated in cases of suspected large intestinal perforation. Perioperative antibiotics are administered to minimize the chance of surgical infection. Randomized, controlled clinical trials of antimicrobial prophylaxis in canine and feline colonic surgery have not been conducted, but based on human trials, 40 antibiotics effective against aerobes, especially the anaerobes that predominate in the large intestine, are administered intravenously once at the beginning of surgery. Antibiotics are not administered again unless either there is contamination at surgery or the procedure takes longer than 2 hours. In the latter case a second intravenous dose of antibiotics is administered. Antibiotics are continued postoperatively in cases with preoperative or surgical contamination based on the results of operative culture and sensitivity testing.",

In an experimental study on healthy dogs, both transection alone and resection of 4 cm of rectum via a dorsal approach resulted in fecally continent dogs. Resection of 6 cm of the rectum, including the peritoneal reflection, caused fecal incontinence. 42 This limitation on resection is problematic in animals with larger rectal tumors, as a 2-cm gross margin is recommended on both sides of the tumor. 39, 44, 45 ",

The pathognomonic lesion of this disease is a mucosal infiltration with large numbers of macrophages staining positively with PAS, and accompanied by mucosal ulceration and loss of goblet cells. 14 Although the term histiocytic ulcerative colitis describes many features of the disease, it understates the mixed lymphocytic plasmacytic component of the inflammation, and the term granuloma tous colitis has been adopted to more completely characterize the histopathology. For the most part, the disease is localized to the large intestine and regional lymph nodes; however, in some instances PAS-positive macrophages may be found in lymph nodes remote from the intestine, suggesting that there is limited systemic distribution of the disease. Historically, an infectious etiology had been speculated but never proved. At least two independent lines of investigation now point to an adherent and invasive E. coli as the underlying etiology of granulomatous colitis. 14, 15 The pathophysiology, clinical examination, diagnosis, and therapy of granulomatous colitis of Boxer dogs and other breeds are discussed in the \"Inflammation\" section.",

            "text": "There are many factors that probably interact to cause colonic perforation in this cohort of dogs. Spinal cord injury and sympathetic nerve stimulation associated with pain likely slow colonic transit and increase fecal retention. It is also likely that immobility and pain associated with abdominal muscle contraction inhibit voluntary defecation in dogs with intervertebral disk disease. This leads to fecal retention and colonic distention. In humans, it is postulated that prolonged increases in colonic intraluminal pressure lead to mucosal ischemia resulting in progressive necrosis, ulceration, and perforation. 6 The effects of corticosteroids have not been extensively studied in the colon and are largely extrapolated from information gained in gastric studies. 8 Corticosteroids are presumed to decrease colonic mucus production, alter the composition of colonic mucus, and decrease mucosal repair in the colon, leading to perturbations in the colonic mucosal barrier. 3 These effects are thought to be secondary to depletion of local prostaglandin production. In addition, glucocorticoids inhibit the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase in vascular endothelial cells, 9 perhaps further affecting colonic blood supply. 10 Together, these factors coalesce to induce erosion of the colonic mucosa, colonic perforation, and peritonitis. 3 The relationship between intervertebral disk disease, corticosteroid treatment, and colonic perforation is highlighted by a report describing 29 dogs with gastrointestinal perforation associated with administration of a COX-2 inhibitor. None of the latter dogs were treated for intervertebral disk disease, and none of the perforations were in the colon. 11 The left colic flexure or proximal portion of the descending colon appears to be at greatest risk for colonic ulceration and perforation; two-thirds of the published cases were reported at this site. 3, 4 Nonambulatory neurosurgical patients treated with dexamethasone are at greatest risk for development of colonic perforation. Colonic perforation is often preceded by variable nonspecific signs, most frequently depression, anorexia, and emesis. Perforation appears to be associated with 100% mortality, emphasizing the importance of prevention and early clinical recognition.",

To prevent infection, the innate immune system activates adaptive immune processes by promoting proinflammatory cytokine expression of T cells, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, and interleukin (IL)-17. This results in appropriate expansion of the relevant T cells to clear the infection, such as T-helper (Th) 1 cells for viruses and Th2 cells for parasites. In the case of normal commensals and adhesive-invasive E. coli (AIEC) in an animal not affected by HUC, T-regulatory cells will produce antiinflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2, which leads to suppression of an inflammatory adaptive immune response and tolerance toward these bacteria. B, Hypothetical explanation for the pathogenesis of HUC. Mutations in pathogen recognition receptors, such as TLRs, lead to inappropriate activation of the adaptive immune system. In the case of AIEC, there is no expansion of T-regulatory cells, which results in engorgement of macrophages with AIEC within their lysosomes. The colonic lamina propria in dogs with HUC is filled with macrophages which stain positive for intracellular AIEC.
