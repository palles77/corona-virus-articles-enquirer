A linear correlation between the virus dilution and virus titer determined by FFA was observed between the range of 10 and 30 foci per well. Comparative analysis between FFA and plaque assay showed no significant difference in estimating the titer of cell adapted PEDV. However, the culture time required for detecting the virus was considerably shorter for FFA. In addition, FFA had higher sensitivity for detecting field isolates of PEDV as well as positive identification of the virus with the antibody specific reaction. A broader range of dilutions and number of replicates may be used for titration. A FFA may be applied as an alternative method for detection and titration of PEDV.",

Among the diagnostic methods used, the RT-PCR method is an easy, rapid, specific, and sensitive test for the detection of PEDV in Vero cells and from fecal samples and homogenized intestinal tissues (Kim and Chae, 2002; Song et al., 2006) . However, RT-PCR only confirms the presence of the viral genome, and not necessarily the presence of infectious virions. Hence, it may not provide sufficient information for determining the presence of infectious virions. At present, plaque assay and immunofluorescence antibody tests have been used for measuring virus infectivity of PEDV in vitro (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988 ).",

A susceptible cell line is grown to confluence in a tissue culture dish and is inoculated with various dilutions of the virus. After considerable CPE is observed, staining with crystal violet allows clear visualization of areas of localized infection or plaques. This method has been employed for detection and titration of several arboviruses, herpesviruses, and coronaviruses, and has been the \"gold standard\" in characterizing virus infectivity (Russel, 1962; Takayama and Kim, 1976; Thomas and Dulac, 1976; Vautherot, 1981; Westaway, 1966) .",

            "text": "FFA offers some advantages for PEDV over the plaque assay technique. One clear advantage is the ability to observe virus infected cells without discernable CPE. Since this method detects viral proteins in infected cells using antibodies that are virus-specific, it is possible to detect the presence of the virus as long as sufficient amount of viral proteins are expressed by the infected cells. In addition, the use of virus-specific antibodies also allows antigenic confirmation of PEDV. Previously, it was reported that the parental strain of PEDV CV777 infects only a small number of cells and fail to cause syncytium formation in Vero cells. CPE was observed only after several passages (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988) . However, using the FFA, virus infection can be confirmed 8 h after initial infection of the cells. This allows detection of PEDV as well as measuring the titer of the stock on every passage of the virus. Furthermore, adaptation of the virus to Vero cells may be monitored by observing the size of the foci and comparing the rate of infection and spread of the virus to adjacent cells. Another advantage of FFA is the short incubation period required to detect cells infected with the virus. Unlike plaque assay, the presence of the virus may be confirmed within a few replication cycle of the virus. In contrast, the plaque assay requires several replication cycles of the virus before discernable CPE is observed. Finally, the 96-well microtiter plate scale for cell culture used in FFA provides the advantage of using more replicates and a large number of dilutions for detection and titration of the virus (Ishimine et al., 1987) .",

These findings suggest that the FFA may be used for detection and titration of PEDV in a given sample among primary isolates.
