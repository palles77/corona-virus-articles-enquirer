Desmethylicaritin is a bioactive metabolite of Epimedium flavonoids in serum. As it is well known that estrogen inhibits aidpogenesis, so we hypothesized that desmethylicaritin as a phytoestrogen might have the potential to inhibit lipid deposition. This study was designed to investigate the effect of desmethylicaritin on adipogenesis and its underlying mechanism in vitro. Adipogenesis was assessed by Oil Red O staining in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Bromodeoxyuridine was used to test the clonal expansion. Further, the mRNA level and protein expression of adipgenic and related factors were detected by qRT-PCR and western blot, respectively. The nuclear location of \u03b2-catenin was identified using immunofluoresence assay. Our results showed that desmethylicaritin suppressed the adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, desmethylicaritin inhibited clonal expansion during adipogenesis. Desmethylicaritin did not affect CCAAT/enhancer binding protein \u03b4 and \u03b2 mRNA expression, but decreased the mRNA expression of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein \u03b1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3, adipocyte lipid-binding protein and lipoprotein lipase. Desmethylicaritin up-regulated the mRNA expression of Wnt10b that was however down-regulated after adipogenic induction. Desmethylicaritin increased the protein expression of \u03b2-catenin both in the cytoplasm and nuclei and immunofluorescence results confirmed that desmethylicaritin increased nuclear translocation of \u03b2-catenin. Above findings implied that desmethylicaritin was able to inhibit adipogenesis and Wnt/\u03b2catenin signaling pathway was regulated by desmethylicaritin in the process of suppression of adipogenesis. Above findings supported desmethylicaritin as a novel phytochemical agent for potential prevention of disorders involving lipid metabolism.",

            "text": "The 3T3-L1 cell line is one of the most well-characterized and reliable in vitro models for studying the conversion of preadipocytes into adipocytes (Lee et al., , 2011 . Adipocyte differentiation involves sequential activation of various transcription factors Lane, 1995, Rosen and MacDougald, 2006) . Cebpd and Cebpb are the earliest transcription factors induced by adipogenic stimuli, and they transcriptionally activate the Cebpa and Pparg genes through C/EBP regulatory elements in their proximal promoters (Gregoire et al., 1998) . Cebpa and Pparg served as key transcriptional activators of adipogenesis promote expression of adipocyte-specific genes, such as Fabp4 and Lpl (Gregoire et al., 1998) . accumulated and trans-located to the nucleus where it binds to the T-cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid-enhancing factor family of transcription factors (Bennett et al., 2005) and activates the transcription of its target genes with known functions in suppression of PPAR\u03b3 and C/EBP\u03b1 (Fu et al., 2005 , Shi et al., 2002 Desmethylicaritin is a metabolite of Epimedium-derived flavonoids identified in serum after its oral administration (Liu and Lou, 2004; Shen et al., 2007) . It is classified as a phytoestrogen and exerts estrogenic-like activity (Wang and Lou, 2004; Ye et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2006) , anti-inflammatory activity (Chen et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2009 ) and anti-oxidative activity (Wo et al., 2008) . Recently, estrogen has been reported to inhibit adipogenesis by activating Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling (Kanit et al., 2012) . Accordingly, we hypothesize that desmethylicaritin may be able to inhibit adipogenesis via regulating Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway, i.e. a relevant mechanism to explain the role of Epimedium-derived flavonoids and also the potential use of desmethylicaritin as a novel phytochemical agent to prevent disorders involving lipid metabolism.",

Compared to the adipogenic group, the mRNA expression of \u03b2-catenin in the control group without induction was significantly lower at day 2 and higher at day 8 (P o 0.05 for both), yet without significant differences at day 4 and 6. After adipogenic induction, the mRNA expression of \u03b2-catenin showed the same pattern with or without desmethylicaritin treatment (Fig. 4B ), implying that desmethylicaritin had no effect on \u03b2-catenin gene expression. Western blot analysis was used to investigate the effects of desmethylicaritin on adipogenic-stimulated protein expressions of \u03b2-catenin in 3T3-L1 cells. As shown in Fig. 4C , both in cytoplasm and nuclear, relatively stronger expressions of \u03b2-catenin were observed in the control group than that in the adipogenic-stimulated group. Desmethylicaritin at 10 \u03bcM recovered the depression of \u03b2-catenin expression induced by adipogenic-stimulation, both in the cytoplasm and nuclear (Fig. 4C) . Confocal microscopy showed that \u03b2-catenin in the cell nuclei decreased after 2 days of adipogenic induction, and desmethylicaritin recovered the nuclear translocation of \u03b2-catenin, showed by the overlap of DAPI and \u03b2-catenin antibodies observed under confocal microscope (Fig. 4D) .

Locally, these phagocytic cells produce O 2\u2212 that activates NF-\u03baB and JNK. Both inflammatory signaling pathways regulate cellular transcriptional events, thereby leading to greater production of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and other pro-inflammatory mediators that further JNK and NF-\u03baB pathways through a feed-forward (D) Immunofluoresence of \u03b2-catenin and DAPI at day 2 after adipogenic induction.

This implies that the flavonoid desmethylicaritin might also sustain inflammation, a key survival mechanism which can be harmful when its transient, physiological adaptations are converted to a chronic, pathological state (Zappulla, 2008) . Recent studies have however shown that the herb Sophora flavescens containing desmethylicaritin may exert anti-inflammatory effects by functioning as an inhibitor of the NF-\u03baB pathway through the suppression of redox-based PI3K activation and PEN inactivation . It has also been reported that desmethylicaritin interferes with JNK-mediated c-Jun phosphorylation thereby attenuating pro-inflammatory NO production (Chen et al., 2008) . Nonetheless, desmethylicaritin might also affect the fate of erythrocytes, and this has been related to the risk factors for diabetes, obesity (Kristina et al., 2012) , and metabolic syndrome, an increasingly prevalent condition in the Western world (Zappulla, 2008) . Since humans are not exposed uniformly to single, pure chemicals, but rather to complex and variable mixtures of substances, some of which may also interact synergistically, in vitro studies might not be so reliable to justify a preventive, ever-lasting use of any kind of drugs, including supplements such as prenyl-flavonoid derivatives. Therefore, the synergistic effect of desmethylicaritin and other chemicals in the environment requires further exploration.",

            "text": "In conclusion, the present in vitro study demonstrates for the first time that the phytoestrogenic molecule desmethylicaritin, a unique metabolite of Epimedium-derived flavonoid, inhibits adipogenesis by down-regulating the expression of adipogenic transcription factors Cebpa and Pparg, while the WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway may be regulated by desmethylicaritin during its suppression of adipogenesis. Our findings shield lights on the action and mechanism of desmethylicaritin on inhibition of adipogenesis and provide scientific rationale for using Epimedium-derived flavonoids to prevent steroid-associated osteonecrosis. Further, this study also supports potential R&D of desmethylicaritin as a novel phytochemical agent to prevent disorders involving lipid metabolism.",
