These are involved in a number of pathological conditions including tissue degenerative processes. In the present work, we report the synthesis and systematic evaluation of differently substituted chalcones, chalconesemicarbazones, and diarylpyrazolines on cathepsins B, H and L activity. It was found that after a preliminary screening as cysteine protease inhibitors, chalconesemicarbazones were better inhibitors to these cysteine proteases than diarylpyrazolines followed by chalcones. All the synthesized compounds were identified as the best inhibitors to cathepsin L followed by cathepsin B and then cathepsin H. The results are compared with docking studies and it was found that all the compounds resulted in decrease in energy while interacting with the active site of the enzyme.",

These compounds have also been found to be potent inhibitors to cruzain, cysteine protease of Trypanosoma cruzi and been shown to be trypanocidal [7] . The trypanocidal activity is related to cruzain inhibiting tendencies of the semicarbazones. Falcipain, another protozoal cysteine protease has also been reported to be inhibited by variety of semicarbazones. Therefore, semicarbazone inhibitors of cysteine proteases have potential use for prevention and treatment of protozoan infections such as trypanosomiasis, malaria and leishmaniasis. It has also been reported that semicarbazones of aryl and alkyl carbonyl compounds inhibit cysteine proteases of parasites more as compared to mammalian proteases and therefore indicate the possibility of their therapeutic use. The compounds also find use in inhibiting cysteine proteases associated with carcinogenesis, including cathepsins B, H and L [8] .",

These, \u2423,\u2424-unsaturated compounds have been found to interact with serum albumin [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] , the protein responsible for the transportation of various molecules including drugs. In the present work we have synthesized chalcones semicarbazones by combining \u2423,\u2424-unsaturated carbonyl-and semicarbazone-pharmacophores, which resulted in formation of two isomers not reported earlier and have evaluated their effect on three important lysosomal cysteine proteases, cathepsin B [EC 3.4. 22 3.4.22.15] . Cysteine proteases are key factors in the pathogenesis of cancer invasion, arthritis, osteoporosis, and microbial infections [25] . Cathepsin B possesses exo as well as endopeptidase activity [26] and is also capable of peptidyldipeptidase [27, 28] and carboxypeptidase activities [29, 30] . The enzyme has been found to be involved in various pathological conditions such as chronic inflammatory diseases of airways and joints, cancer and pancreatitis [31] , atherosclerosis [32] , rheumatoid arthritis [33] Alzheimer's disease [34] , etc. Cathepsin H an endo and amino-peptidase is also involved in many diseased conditions including breast carcinoma [35] , melanoma and tumour metastasis [36] , head and neck carcinoma [37] , malignant prostate cancer [38] . Similarly, cathepsin L activity has also been reported to be involved in diseases such as osteoarthritis [39, 40] , tumorigenesis [41] [42] [43] , Ebola haemorrhagic fever, severe acute respiratory syndrome and Leishmaniasis [44] [45] [46] . Targeting these enzymes is therefore one of the strategies in the development of new chemotherapeutic agents for a number of diseases including tissue degenerative disorders.",

To explore further in this direction the present work is focused on chalcones, chalconesemicarbazones and their cyclized derivatives as inhibitors to cathepsins B, H and L. The intention to synthesize semicarbazones of chalcones was undertaken keeping in view that the semicarbazones possessing azomethine group in conjunction with \u2423,\u2424-unsaturation will have extended pharmacological activities. The compounds were further cyclized to pyrazolines which are also reported to possess diverse biological activities such as antimicrobial [58] , antiamoebic [59] , anti-inflammatory [60] , anticancer [61] , antidepressant [62] and antitubercular [63] activities. Effect of synthesized compounds was observed on cathepsins B, H and L to establish a structure activity relationship between the 1,3diphenylprop-2-en-1-ones, substituted chalconesemicarbazones and substituted 3,5-diphenyl-2-pyrazoline-1-carboxamide derivatives. Structure activity relationship (SAR) studies of open chain and cyclized derivatives can result in identification of potential inhibitors among related class of compounds [55, 56] . A comparative account of different moieties introduced in the synthesized compounds on cathepsin B, H and L, three lysosomal cysteine proteases inhibiting tendency has also been evaluated. The studies can lead to the development of new inhibitors of these enzymes.",

These two isomeric forms were separated by column chromatography on silica gel using petroleum ether and ethyl acetate as eluent. The separated isomers were characterized by 1 H NMR data. The isomers obtained were characterized on the basis of interaction of lone pair on nitrogen with C H proton as explained by Curphy-Morrison chemical shift [72] . When lone pairs on nitrogen are syn to C H bonds (2a-2j), the proton is shifted upfield showing the lower \u0131 value. When lone pairs on nitrogen are anti to C H bonds (2a -2j ), the proton is shifted downfield. The conclusion was arrived on the basis of 3D molecular modelling studies. In 2i where lone pair on nitrogen is syn to C 2 -H (Scheme 1) on minimization of energy in 3D molecular modelling ( Fig. 1) [73] clearly indicate that lone pair on nitrogen is in optimal position to affect shielding of C 2 -H and also to C 3 -H to some extent because of extension of conjugation. In 2i the lone pair on nitrogen is anti to C 2 -H and after 3D molecular modelling in minimized energy structure shown in Figure 1 , it is clear that these can't have any effect on CH CH protons. On comparing the 1 H NMR, peaks for C 2 -H and C 3 -H for chalcones and chalconesemicarbazones, distinctive shielding effect is observed due to substitution of adjacent C O group with C N NHCONH 2 . These isomeric forms are reported here for the first time, although a large number of reports are available in literature on the synthesis of these compounds [74] [75] [76] . In case of p-OCH 3 and p-NO 2 substituted isomers only one isomer was formed i.e. 2f and 2h, respectively.",

            "text": "Table S1 (Supplementary data) presents the data of docking studies of different chalcones, their acyclic and cyclic semicarbazone derivatives in cathepsin B active site (cav2IPP B PYS.pdb). The results clearly indicate that binding energy of chalcones is less than pyrazoline derivatives which is less than the open chain semicarbazones. The binding energy of chalcones (1a-1j), The docking results explain that the title compounds may not be potent inhibitors to the protease activity to an extent of specific pepidyl inhibitors but certainly suggest a differential inhibitory pattern of these compounds on cathepsin B activity. However, maximum interaction is observed for BANA with a score of \u2212129.83. Decrease in total energy for leupeptin-cathepsin B has come out be \u2212116.42 of which the contribution of van der Waals interactions are more with a score of \u221286.37 as compared to H-bonds with a score of \u221229.44. Leupeptin-cathepsin B binding energy is due to peptide-protein interaction. Leupeptin is peptidyl in nature and therefore being a flexible molecule binds effectively with the enzyme active site resulting in higher binding energy. iGem-DOCK provide algorithms for flexible docking approach for both ligands and proteins [82] therefore flexible ligands like leupeptin will show a larger decrease in total energy as compared to the molecules under study as these are smaller in structure and possess lesser flexibility compared to leupeptin. Therefore, the binding energy of title compounds is less than leupeptin. In the quest of synthesizing potent inhibitors of enzymes a structure-activity relationship is required where cyclic and acyclic analogues are to be studied. There are various pharmaco-dynamic reactions which molecule acting as drug encounters in vivo such as cyclization, oxidation, reduction etc. so we have here, provided the comparative account of in vitro studies and in-silico study on the structurally related compounds or their isomers. These compounds are synthesized from the same starting material. The open chain analogues are the intermediates therefore there are a need to screen their inhibitory potential along with the products i.e. the cyclized derivatives, pyrazolines in order to establish structure activity relationship. In this direction the present study has been undertaken to evaluate the effect of 1, 3-diphenylprop-2-en-1ones (1a-1j), substituted chalconesemicarbazones (2a-2j, 2a -2j ) which are open chain compounds and their cyclic analogues i.e. substituted 3,5-diphenyl-2-pyrazoline-1-carboxamide derivatives (3a-3j) on the activity of cathepsin B, a protease of immense importance. During the synthetic studies of semicarbazones we came across the presence of two stereoisomers in the preparation. Docking experiments were conducted on these two isomers also and a differential effect was observed (Table S1 -Supplementary data). The results of the docking studies support the in vitro experimental studies conducted on liver cathepsin B. It has been observed that chalcones were less inhibitory to the enzyme activity whereas semicarbazones and pyrazoline derivatives. This was quite surprising as chalcones having an \u2423-\u2424 unsaturated carbonyl group seems to be more responsive towards thiol attack of cysteine present at the active site of enzyme but both the results after, in-silico docking experiments as well as in vitro solution studies clearly indicate that presence of azomethine carboxamide might have provided larger interaction to the binding of compound with the enzyme active site and there by exerting more inhibition than its precursor chalcones, which is further confirmed by the enzyme-ligand interaction study. Fig. 8 shows the binding of most inhibitory compound 1a, 2a, 2a and 3a in the active site of cathepsin B. The ligands are shown in pink, residues involved in H-bonding and van-der Waals interactions are shown as green and grey, respectively. It is clearly observed that cys-29 and His-199 residues present at the catalytic site of the enzyme are involved in the binding of compounds. Based on these interactions, a mechanism of inhibition (Scheme 2) by chalcones and chalconesemicarbazones is proposed on the basis of a previously reported inhibition of cathepsin L, another important cysteine protease by thiosemicarbazones [83] . The thiolate of cys-29 attacks on the nucleophilic site in chalcones and chalconesemicarbazones, where the later is more stabilized to the binding site. In addition, Gly-198, Ala-200 and Trp-30 amino acids residues are also involved in the stabilization of compounds in binding site. Pyrazolines are also better inhibitors to cathepsin B activity than chalcones again emphasizes on the importance of binding of compound with the active site. Though pyrazolines lack any nucleophilic site in their structure but still they show better inhibitory potential probably due to the presence of side chain carboxamide and nitrogen in the ring altogether providing a larger binding area to the enzyme site. Among themselves the cyclized pyrazolines were less inhibitory than open chain semicarbazones. It can be interpreted that acyclic compounds interact more with the active site being straight in nature not to the extent of peptidyl inhibitors but certainly greater than the cyclized pyrazoline derivatives. This gives an understanding of the inhibition caused by the target compounds on structural basis. Similar trends have been observed for cathepsin H. However, in cathepsin H, the most inhibitory compound in each series have been found to be 1g, 2g, 2c and 3b. Fig. 9 shows the binding of the most inhibitory compounds in the active site of cathepsin H. The binding energies of title compounds in the amino acyl binding site of cathepsin H (cav8PCHH NAG) is presented in Table  S2 (Supplementary data). Experimental results obtained can be correlated with the ligand-binding interactions. It is observed that for 1g, 2g, 2c and 3b, the binding energies computed come out to be \u221282.21, \u221296.59, \u221293.63 and \u221284. 78 . In each series, these most inhibitory compounds show a decrease in binding energy towards higher side. The binding energies show effective interaction between the enzyme binding site and inhibitory compounds may be responsible for these inhibition patterns. Fig. 10 shows the binding of most inhibitory compounds 1b, 2c, 2a and 3g in the active site of cathepsin L. The results of the docking studies support the in vitro experimental studies conducted on goat liver cathepsin L. The binding energies of title compounds in the amino acyl binding site of cathepsin L (cav3BC3L CSW) is presented in Table S3 (Supplementary data). The binding energies of 1b, 2c, 2a and 3g were found to be \u221277.07, \u221292.93, \u2212104.04 and \u2212114.94, respectively.",
