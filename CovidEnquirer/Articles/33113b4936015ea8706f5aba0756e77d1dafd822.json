On March 17, the Singapore Ministry of Health designated Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where the initial nosocomial outbreak had occurred, as the national hospital for SARS cases. However, SARS later surfaced in three of the other four large public hospitals (6) . We describe the difficulties associated with recognizing the disease and preventing its transmission in an emergency department of a large teaching hospital.",

At the hospital entrance, there are prominent signs highlighting the features of SARS, including fever and respiratory symptoms.

He had spent almost 4 hours before admittance to a general medical (nonisolation) ward for heart failure. It was later discovered that his brother whom he had visited at another hospital was the then-unrecognized index case for a number of infections there. Patient 8 had been cared for in gurney 19 of the intermediate care area (Figure) . He was neither placed in isolation nor given a mask because his admitting diagnosis was heart failure. A visitor to the patient in gurney 18 was infected with SARS, with onset of symptoms on April 13. Eight other patients were in the intermediate care area during this period. The patient in gurney 8 developed SARS symptoms on April 14, and the patient in gurney 11, on April 18; no other source could be identified for their infections. The remaining 6 patients had no evidence of SARS on extended follow-up. Patient 8 was also the source of infection for 4 health care workers from the inpatient unit (patients 9, 10, 11, and 13).

The transmission of SARS to patients in gurneys 8 and 11 was possibly by fomites or the gloved hands of a health care worker, as these patients had no direct contact with patient 8 (who was in gurney 19). Close contact was only evident in 6 patients, 2 of whom did not have notable fevers and thus were not identified immediately although they were isolated.

Staff at the hospital still use full personal protective equipment. Powered air-purifying respirators are still used for all intubations. One emergency department staff member had a mild seroconversion illness, but there were no clinical cases of SARS, confirming the observations of others that infection control can protect staff effectively (12, 13) . We initially had a no-visitor rule to the emergency department to prevent the spread of SARS to the community. This rule is currently limited to the critical and intermediate care areas; the few visitors to these areas are required to wear disposable gowns, N95 masks, and gloves. We also have an electronic surveillance system for all staff, patients, and visitors for contact tracing. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have issued new guidelines for responding to SARS, which are supported by our experience (14) .
