We report an influenza A H3N2 outbreak (influenza A H3) among inpatients, visitors, and employees on our oncology ward that is postulated to have been introduced by an HCW attending work while ill. We also describe aggressive containment efforts instituted by our team of infection preventionists to limit the spread of disease.",

The oncology ward contains 14 single patient rooms and an open access multipurpose room where patients and visitors can prepare meals and socialize. There is a single point of entry without direct access to other units so as to prevent through traffic. Transportation of patients to and from other locations in the hospital is limited. However, HCWs often disperse to other locations in the hospital (ie, other units, outpatient clinics, and administrative offices), and patient visitors are not limited. At the time an outbreak was identified, 10 of 14 beds on the ward were occupied. Although the exact number of all HCWs with some exposure to the ward remains uncertain, we were able to confirm 39 nurses were assigned to the unit during the outbreak period of interest, November 14, 2017, to November 27, 2017 (2 days prior to the first patient case until the last day admissions were diverted).",

All inpatients who were housed on the oncology ward were tested for influenza using FilmArray RP 1.0. Inpatients with confirmed influenza A were treated with 75 mg of oseltamivir orally twice daily for 10 days, owing to the potential for prolonged viral shedding in immunocompromised patients. 11, 12 Inpatients who were asymptomatic and tested negative for influenza were administered a standard prophylactic course of 75 mg of oseltamivir orally for 10 days. 13 Beginning November 19, 2017, HCWs who were assigned to the oncology ward were screened for ILI symptoms prior to starting their shift. During the investigation period, November 19, 2017, to November 27, 2017, symptomatic HCWs were tested for influenza using FilmArray RP 1.0, if available. Symptomatic HCWs with ILI and either confirmed or probable influenza infection were treated with 75 mg of oseltamivir orally twice a day for 5 days and excluded from work until symptom resolution. Symptom resolution was defined as resolution of fevers for 24 hours without the use of antipyretics or resolution of peak respiratory symptoms for 24 hours. Once HCWs returned to work, they were advised to wear a surgical mask until their respiratory symptoms were completely resolved (derived from CDC guidance). 14 Exposed symptomatic HCWs with negative influenza testing and exposed asymptomatic HCWs were offered a prophylactic course of oseltamivir (75 mg by mouth daily for 10 days).",

The last diagnosis of influenza A in an inpatient was on November 19, 2017. Unfortunately, an attack rate among the staff cannot be reliably calculated, because the exact number of all exposed HCWs in this outbreak is difficult to quantify owing to the frequency of visits from outside personnel (ie, pharmacists, social workers, chaplains, and consultants). Identification of influenza cases in HCWs who work in various locations throughout the hospital resulted in an exponential number of staff with potential exposure (ie, office mates and outpatient clinic staff), all of whom could not be accurately accounted for. Prophylactic oseltamivir was prescribed to 108 persons during the outbreak period, which we suspect exceeds the number of truly exposed persons, but also reflects the diversity of the staff involved. However, we were able to confirm 39 nurses were assigned to the ward between the dates of November 14, 2017 and November 27, 2017 (2 days prior to the first inpatient case through the end of the outbreak).

Additionally, the HCWs were also found to be circulating other respiratory viruses in addition to influenza A. This further emphasizes a need for a culture change across the health care industry to limit the risk that ill HCWs pose to inpatients if, and when, they present for duty with an ILI. 26 Banach et al 27 describe the potential for patient visitors to contribute to nosocomial spread of influenza. Although the 2 family members who became infected in this outbreak did not cause the outbreak, this situation demonstrates the challenges in establishing practical visitation policies that limit the potential for visitors to contribute to nosocomial spread of ILI during influenza season.",

A recent study demonstrated an egg-adapted mutation at a key hemagglutinin glycosylation site, which led to poor neutralizing antibodies in humans and ferrets. 29 This highlights the need to develop a \"universal\" influenza vaccine, which could protect against seasonal influenza drift variants as well as pandemic strains. 30, 31 Our study has a few limitations. First, all symptoms documented by the HCWs in the anonymous survey were self-reported after their illness, which leaves them susceptible to some degree of recall bias. Second, we did not routinely test reportedly asymptomatic HCWs; therefore, we may have missed asymptomatic individuals who contributed to the outbreak. Third, our ability to detect symptoms in visitors was significantly limited as we relied on self-reporting. Furthermore, due to limited sample size, the external validity of our findings is restricted.",
