Since passive heat recovery systems use temperature or enthalpy difference between outdoor air and indoor air to drive the system, the temperature of fresh air supply cannot meet indoor requirements and the exhaust heat is not fully recovered. In this study, a solar-driven exhaust air thermoelectric heat pump recovery (SDEATHP) system is tested and evaluated for its ability to recover thermal energy from exhaust air to cool or heat fresh air. An experimental platform was established to test its performance. Results show that the SDEATHP system can obtain higher fresh air supply temperature in winter and lower fresh air supply temperature in summer. The system requires only 3.12 W of power for the fans, and the average relative cooling coefficient in summer and the average relative heating coefficient can reach 50.6 and 57.9, respectively. The optimal operating current and voltage of TE modules and photovoltaic system is analyzed, and then the number and types of electrical connections for the TE modules in SDEATHP system are discussed. The SDEATHP system provides a new method for building energy recovery and fresh air supply.",

Buildings account for 30% of China's total social energy consumption which has become the largest energy consumption entity in China [3] . Reducing energy use through more energy-efficient measures has become a common concern for researchers [4] . Fresh air supply in buildings is of great benefit to indoor air qualities and peoples' health, and has become a concern due to the sick building syndrome (SBS) and the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 [5] . Due to the large temperature or enthalpy difference between the outdoor fresh air and the indoor air, the handling of fresh air requires a large amount of building energy consumption. Research showed that fresh air systems consume about 20-40% of the total energy consumption of the air-conditioning systems [6] . Therefore, development of fresh air equipment and systems to re-duce the energy consumption of fresh air is of great significance to building energy conservation.",

Passive heat recovery systems do not have energy-driven refrigeration equipment, and what it needs is only fan or pump energy consumption so that it can obtain higher energy efficiency by recycling exhaust heat for heating or cooling fresh air. In recent years, various forms of passive heat recovery systems have been widely used in buildings, including heat pipe heat exchangers, flat plate heat exchangers, rotary wheel heat exchangers and liquid coupled run around energy recovery systems [7] [8] [9] . However, since these passive waste heat recovery systems use the temperature or enthalpy difference between the outdoor fresh air and indoor air to drive the system, the temperature of the fresh air supply from the passive heat recovery systems are always higher in summer and lower in winter than the indoor temperature. Active energy recovery systems can recover latent heat of the exhaust air and active control of fresh air temperature and humidity. The heat pump heat recovery system is a kind of active energy recovery system, which is based on thermal cycle operation and uses exhaust air instead of outdoor air as a heat source [10] . But, it requires additional power to drive the compressor, and the system is complex and only suitable for buildings that have a large demand for fresh air.",

The coefficient of performance of the system increases from 0.67 to 1.15 and the cooling power increases from 101.34 to 517.24 W, with an increase in input current from 2 A to 6 A [25] . Liu et al. studied an active solar thermoelectric radiant wall system, and the results showed that the system can actively control the temperature of the wall [26] .

            "text": "To overcome the shortcomings of the passive waste heat recovery systems and the active compressed waste heat recovery systems, this study proposes a solar-driven exhaust air thermoelectric heat pump recovery (SDEATHP) system. In the SDEATHP system, a solar photovoltaic converts solar radiation into electrical energy, which is subsequently used to power the exhaust air thermoelectric heat pump recovery (EATHP) system to recover the exhaust heat energy for fresh air heating or cooling, realizing the aim of active control of fresh air. The system has no power consumption except for the fans because it uses solar energy to drive the thermoelectric cooler. Moreover, with its power generation in situ and used in situ, and with no battery or inverter, the SDEATHP system can save the investment in power grid and reduce the loss of power transmission and distribution. In order to prove the feasibility of the SDEATHP system, the solar-driven ex-haust air thermoelectric heat pump recovery (SDEATHP) system is tested and evaluated for its ability to recover thermal energy from exhaust air to cool or heat fresh air. In details, in Section 2 , the working principle of the SDEATHP system was introduced. In Section 3 , the system experimental test platform was established. In Section 4 , the performance of the system was analyzed and discussed. In Section 5 , the coupling characteristics of photovoltaic direct-connected exhaust air thermoelectric heat pump recovery system are analyzed and discussed. Finally, conclusions and recommendations are drawn in Section 6 . Fig. 1 depicts the prototype solar-driven exhaust air thermoelectric heat pump (SDEATHP) system. The SDEATHP system mainly consists of exhaust air thermoelectric heat pump recovery system (EATHP) and solar photovoltaic (PV) system. The PV system is installed above the window as a fixed shading device in buildings. The EATHP system is composed of fresh air fan, fresh air side heat sink, thermoelectric modules, exhaust air side heat sink and exhaust air fan. The thermoelectric modules are installed between the fresh air side heat sink and the exhaust air side heat sink. The EATHP system is directly connected to and powered by the PV system.",

It can be observed that increase in irradiation intensity leads to increase in the electric power of the SDEATHP system. The maximum electric power is about 177 W at the solar radiation value of 1176 W/m 2 in cooling mode, and in heating mode, the maximum electric power is about 173 W at the solar radiation value of 876 W/m 2 . It can also be seen from Figs. 6 and 7 that the electrical efficiency of the PV system is also affected by solar radiation because the thermoelectric cooling modules are directly connected to the PV system without maximum power point tracking. The maximum electrical efficiency is 13.7% when the solar radiation is 736 W/m 2 ; and the minimum electrical efficiency is only 1.1% when the solar radiation is 330 W/m 2 in heating mode. In cooling mode, the maximum electrical efficiency is 15% when the solar radiation is 640 W/m 2 and the minimum electrical efficiency is only 2.8% when the solar radiation is 111 W/ m 2 . Fig. 8 shows the variations of inlet fresh air temperature (T fin ), outlet fresh air temperature (T fout ) and indoor temperature (T in ) in cooling mode. It can be seen that the temperature of the outlet fresh air is maintained at 26.4 \u00b0C to 29.3 \u00b0C, which is 5.4-9.9 \u00b0C lower than the inlet fresh air temperature of 32.7 \u00b0C to 37.9 \u00b0C. During the test, the indoor air temperature is maintained at 23 \u00b0C to 26 \u00b0C, and the outlet fresh air temperature is only 0-6 \u00b0C higher than it. Fig. 9 shows the relative humidity of inlet fresh air and outlet fresh air in cooling mode. The relative humidity of outlet fresh air is between 77% \u221279% while the relative humidity of inlet fresh air is between 44% \u221261%. This is because the lower the fresh air temperature is, the lower the relative humidity is, and so the relative humidity of the outlet fresh air is greater than the relative humidity of the inlet fresh air. Fig. 10 shows the variations of inlet fresh air temperature, outlet fresh air temperature and indoor temperature in heating mode. It can be seen that fresh air supply temperature is lower than indoor temperature when the system starts to work, and as the solar irradiation increases, the temperature of outlet fresh air gradually increases from 13.8 \u00b0C to the maximum value of 31.8 \u00b0C at 12:05. Meanwhile, the fresh air supply temperature is about 12 \u00b0C higher than the indoor air temperature. After 2:30 pm, the fresh air supply temperature gradually decreases from 29.1 \u00b0C to 21.2 \u00b0C at 16:30. The maximum temperature difference of outlet fresh air and inlet fresh air is 14.7 \u00b0C when the solar radiation is 852 W/m 2 and the indoor temperature is controlled within 18-22 \u00b0C most of the time. Fig. 11 shows the variations of the cooling capacity, COP c and voltage of the SDEATHP system in cooling mode. Due to changes in solar irradiation, the cooling capacity of the system fluctuates greatly, with values between 52 W and 295 W. The cooling capacity reaches the maximum value of 295 W when the voltage is 26.2 V, but when the voltage reaches the maximum value of 27.6 V, the cooling capacity is just 216 W. This is because the cooling capacity of the SDEATHP system is affected by the voltage and other factors, such as inlet fresh air temperature and exhaust air temperature. As shown in Fig. 11 , the COP c of the SDEATHP system decreases as the operating voltage increases. The maximum COPc can reach 14.2 at 15:40, and the minimum COPc is only 0.51 at 13:10. This is because the larger the voltage is, the larger the temperature difference between the hot and cold sides of the thermoelectric modules is, resulting in lower COPc. Fig. 12 shows that the heating capacity, COP h and voltage of the SDEATHP system vary with time. It can be seen that after the system starts working, the heating capacity gradually increases from 38.7 W to 300.8 W at 11:40, and then gradually decreases because of solar radiation. It can be observed that the heating capacity drops rapidly after 12:05, but the voltage remains at around 28 V. This is because the temperature of the inlet fresh air increases and the indoor temperature decrease at the same time, and the sharp increase of the temperature difference between the cold and hot sides of the thermoelectric cooling system leads to sharp decrease of heating capacity. As shown in Fig. 12 , the COP h of SDEATHP sys- tem is affected by the voltage, and the larger the voltage is, the larger the COP h is. The system can obtain a larger heating factor before 10:00 and after 15:40 because the operating voltage is small. The maximum heating coefficient is 5.6 (9:10), and the minimum heating coefficient is 1.29 (10:00).",

The average solar radiation received by the PV system during the testing day is 641.3 W/m 2 in summer and 583.7 W/m 2 in winter. As can be seen from Table 3 , the average electrical power of the PV system is 102 W in summer and 104.6 W in winter. Overall, the average electrical efficiency of the PV is 9.4% in summer and 11% in winter. According to Figs. 11 and 12 , the average SDEATHP cooling capacity and heating capacity are 158 W and 180.8 W, respectively. According to the average electrical power and average electrical efficiency of the PV, the average system COP of the SDEATHP system is about 1.50 in cooling mode and 1.68 in heating mode. However, since the SDEATHP system uses photovoltaic to drive the thermoelectric cooling system, the system requires only 3.12 W of power for the fans. If the fan power is used as the input power of the system to calculate the performance of the system, the average relative cooling coefficient in summer and the average relative heating coefficient can reach 50.6 and 57.9, respectively. Improvement in the performance of the SDEATHP system can be achieved by improving heat dissipation conditions, especially the hot side of the thermoelectric modules. Moreover, the performance can be further improved by selecting higher performance of TE modules and the PV system [30] .",

In heating conditions, the outlet fresh air temperature gradually increases after the SDEATHP system starts to work, and becomes higher than indoor temperature, reaching the maximum value of 31.8 \u00b0C at 12:05. At this time, the outlet fresh air temperature is about 12 \u00b0C higher than indoor air temperature. It indicates that the SDEATHP system can obtain higher outlet fresh air temperature in winter and lower fresh air supply temperature in summer and can achieve full recovery of ex-haust air heat. However, traditional passive heat recovery systems are driven by temperature difference or enthalpy difference between fresh air and exhaust air. The temperature drop of fresh air supply temperature in summer and the temperature rise in winter are smaller, and the system cannot obtain fresh air temperature that is lower in summer and higher in winter than indoor temperature.",

I TE is the current of the single thermoelectric module, V TE is the voltage of the single thermoelectric module, P TE is the power consumption of the single TE modules, x is the number of the TE modules in series, and y is the number of the TE modules in parallel, a is the Seebeck coefficient, R TE is the module's electrical resistance, and T is the temperature difference of the cold side and hot side of the TE modules. In order to calculate the power input of the TE modules, the T is assumed at 15 \u00b0C, and the parameter value of R TE is 2.36 , according to the product information of TE modules. In order to get outstanding performance, the SDEATHP system requires that: (1) the current of each TE module should be maintained at the current point of the maximum COP; (2) the thermoelectric modules should work within allowable working voltage range; (3) Photovoltaic cells should work as close to the point of maximum efficiency as possible. As shown in Fig. 13 , there are some connection strategies for the TE modules and PV system. According to Eq. (16) , we can get the I-V curves of the thermoelectric modules under different connection diagrams. Moreover, when the I-V curves of thermoelectric modules were added to those of the PV system, we can identify the TE and PV system working points, as shown in Fig. 4 . Fig. 14 shows the operating voltage and current curves of thermoelectric cooling modules under different connection strategies. From the I-U curves of the photovoltaic cells under solar radiation of 20 0 W/m 2 , 40 0 W/m 2 , 60 0 W/m 2 ,80 0 W/m 2 ,and 10 0 0 W/m 2 , we know that the maximum efficiency operating point of the photovoltaic under different solar radiation is between 30-38.5 V. In addition, according to our previous research, when a single TE module has a current between 1.2 and 2.2 A, it can achieve excellent performance [13] . Therefore, we can reach the following conclusion about the strategies of connecting the TE systems to the PV system for current SDEATHP system. From Fig. 14 , (1) when using a 3 \u00d7 4 TE module, the photovoltaic cell has lower power generation ef- The area of the PV is 1.627m 2 , and the fan power is 3.12 W.",
