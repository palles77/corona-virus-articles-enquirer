A determinant is any characteristic that affects the health of a population. Diet, for example, is a determinant of bovine hypomagnesaemia: reduced food intake and low levels of plant magnesium, related to rapid grass growth, are associated with an increased incidence of the disease {see Figure 3 .6). This chapter discusses the types of determinant and the interac tions that occur between them.",

For example, sex is a secondary determinant of canine heart valve incompetence: male dogs are more likely to develop incompetence than females (Buchanan, 1977; Thrusfield et al., 1985) . The primary determinants may include other genetically determined factors such as the rate of ageing of the valves, which may be associated with breed. Primary and secondary determinants are listed in Table 5 .1. Table 5 .1 also illustrates that some determinants (both primary and secondary) are internal to the host, for example, genetic constitution including aberrant genes (which are the primary causes of genetic disorders), species, breed and sex. These determinants are intrinsic, also termed endogenous (Greek: endon = within). In contrast, some determinants are external to the host, for instance transportation, which may result in physical trauma, producing bruising of carcasses (Meischke et al., 1974) . Such determinants are extrinsic, also termed exogenous (Greek: exo = outside). Table 5 .2 exemplifies this classification in relation to canine pruritus (tendency to itch), a common problem in small animal practice. Internal disease, such as hepatitis or nephritis, may act as an intrinsic predisposing factor by increasing the sensitivity of the skin (Krai, 1966) . Mastocytomas contain an excess of histamine and proteolytic enzymes which induce itching. Conditions that are not usually associated with pruritus, such as hypothyroidism, may become pruritic when bacterial infections are superimposed. Dietary factors, such as a high potassium:calcium ratio, also increase skin sensitivity.",

Most infectious agents enter the host as challenges from the environment (the dam can be the 'environment', too, when fetal infection occurs). However, during the microbial revolution, the early emphasis on microbes as the primary causes of disease resulted in their being considered separately from other environmental factors such as husbandry, trauma and toxic agents. Thus, determi nants commonly are classified into those associated with the host, the agent and the environment. These three groups of factors are sometimes called the triad (Figure 5 .1). Some authors (e.g. Schwabe, 1984) consider that management and husbandry are important enough in intensive animal enterprises to be classified separately from the environment, as a fourth major group. In some diseases, an infectious agent is the main determinant, and host and environmental factors are of relatively minor importance. Such diseases are 'simple'; examples are major animal plagues like foot-and-mouth disease and tuberculosis, where a multifactorial nature is not obvious. In other diseases, termed 'complex'> their multifactorial nature predominates, and an interaction between host, agent and environment can be identified. Thus, 'environmental' mastitis involves an interac tion between Escherichia coli or Streptococcus uheris (the agent), milking machine faults, and poor hygiene resulting from inadequate bedding, drain age and cleaning of passageways (the environment) (Francis et al., 1979) . In addition, cows (the hosts) are most susceptible in early lactation.",

Most 'diseases' with which the veterinarian is initially concerned are actually clinical signs presented by animals' owners. Thus, pruritus in a dog is a clinical sign which can be caused by several different lesions each with their own sufficient causes. Further examples of signs and lesions with different causes are given in Figures  9.1b and 9 .1c. The causal web can become very complex when the 'disease' is defined in terms of a production shortfall in a herd or flock. Thus, 'reproductive failure' in a pig herd, reflected in unacceptably low numbers of piglets being born in a herd in a defined period of time, can be produced by decreased male or female fertility, or infection or metabolic derangement of the sow or fetus during pregnancy. genetic constitution, nutrition, infections, toxic agents, environment and management.

Lebeau (1953) has devised a method for converting canine to human age equivalents ( Figure 5.4) . A 1-year-old dog is equivalent to a 15-year-old person; a 2-year-old dog to a 24-year-old person; and, above the age of 2 years, each 1 year of a dog's life is equivalent to 4 human years. Thus, a 10-year-old dog is equivalent to a 56-year-old person (24 years, plus 4 years for each canine year from 3 years onwards). However, Reif (1983) emphasizes the problems associated with such a conversion, because large breeds of dog tend to die younger than small breeds. Applying Lebeau's conversion, Figure 5 .5 compares the age-specific incidence rates of mam mary cancer in the dog and man. The rates are similar until the human menopause, when ovarian activity decreases and the human rate tends to stabilize, suggesting a hormonal determinant. This suggestion is supported by the demonstration of receptors for steroid hormones in the cytosol fractions from canine mammary carcinomas (Martin et at., 1984) and the experimental reduction in the carcinomas' growth by the anti-oestrogen, tamoxifen, and by ovariectomy when the cancers are transplanted to nude mice (Pierrepoint et al., 1984) .",

Canine haemophilia A and B, for example, are associated with the X chromosome and are inherited recessively, the defects being predomi nant in males (Patterson and Medway, 1966) . Sex-limited inheritance occurs when the DNA responsible for the disease is not in the sex chromosomes, but the disease is expressed only in one sex, for example cryptorchidism in dogs. In sex-influenced inheritance, the threshold for the overt expression of a characteristic is lower in one sex than the other, therefore there is an excess incidence in one sex over the other.

Monkeys are not suscepti ble to poliovirus because they do not have the 'right' cell receptors. Removal of the virus capsid allows the virus to divide lytically in monkey cells if it is first made to enter them. Susceptibility can vary within a species, too. Thus, only certain pigs are susceptible to the strain of Escherichia coli possessing the K88 antigen because susceptibility is determined by the presence of an intestinal receptor which is inherited in a simple Mendelian manner (Rutter, 1975) .",

For instance, cows with a small pelvic outlet relative to their size (e.g. the Chianina and Belgian blue) are predisposed to dystocia.",

The ability to infect is related to the inherent susceptibility of a host and whether or not the host is immune. Virulence is the ability of an infectious agent to cause disease, in a particular host, in terms of frequency and severity. Pathogenicity is sometimes used as a synonym for virulence, with virulence reserved for variations in the disease-inducing potential of different strains of the same organism. However, 'pathogenicity' refers to the quality of disease induction, and should not be used semiquantitatively to indicate the degree to which disease is induced. Thus, the protozoan parasite Naegleria fowled is pathogenic to man in warm, but not in cold, water, the pathogenicity being governed in this instance by environment. More commonly, pathogenicity and virulence are intrinsic characteristics of an infectious agent and are either phenotypically or genotypically con ditioned. Phenotypic changes are transient, and are lost in succeeding generations. For example, New castle disease virus, cultivated on the chorioallantoic membrane of hens' eggs, is more virulent to chicks than virus that is cultivated in calf kidney cells. Genotypic changes result from a change in the DNA (and RNA, in RNA viruses) of the microbial genome (the agent's total genetic complement).",

An agent may achieve pathogenicity, or increase virulence, by a change in antigenic composition to a type to which the host is not genetically or immunologically resistant. However, antigenic changes are not always the cause of changes in pathogenicity and virulence. They may be simply indicators of such changes, the determinants being associated with the production of inhibitory, toxic or other substances by the agent. Genotypic changes also can alter the sensitivity of bacteria to antibiotics.",

Deletion mutants are more likely to occur because they result in changes without redundant genetic material. Frequent mutation may produce antigenic diversity, which may induce recurrent outbreaks of disease in a population which is not immune to the new antigen. Within the same organism, mutation rates can vary for different genetic markers by a factor of 1000. Sites within the genome that frequently mutate are termed 'hot spots'. If these spots code for virulence and antigenic determinants in the infectious agent then the agent can change virulence and antigens frequently.

Thus, influenza A viruses have a genome that is packaged in each virion (virus particle) as eight strands of RNA. Influenza viruses are divided into groups based on the structure of two major antigens: the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase (see also Table 16 .5). Mixed infection of cells in tissue culture, and possibly of wild animals (notably birds), produces recombinants with novel haemagglutinin and neura minidase combinations. Major changes are referred to as 'shift' and minor changes as 'drift'. The major changes are responsible for the periodicapproximately decadal-pandemics of influenza in man (Kaplan, 1982) . (Note that antigenic drift also occurs in trypanosomes, but by a totally different mechanism. The superficial cell membrane is shed to reveal new antigens. The epidemiological result, though, is similar: new antigens, therefore a partially or totally susceptible population.) Recom bination may also occur in the orbiviruses (e.g. African horse sickness and bluetongue) where the precise mechanism is not known, and the term 'genetic reassortment' has been applied (Gorman et al., 1979) . * Conjugation (Finnegan, 1976) involves transmis sion of genetic material from one bacterium to another by a conjugal mechanism (i.e. they touch) through a sex pilus.

Each virion carries a portion of the total genome which is, itself, non-infectious, but which contributes to the whole infectious unit.

All three genes, and therefore both types of virion, are necessary to instigate the successful infection of a tobacco plant.

The condition is a genetically determined error of metabolism which induces a switch of energy utilization in muscles of affected pigs from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism.

However, if it can be inferred that the factors are part of an aggregate of causes with a common causal pathway then synergism is said to have occurred (MacMahon, 1972) . Synergism, in a statistical context, therefore may be thought of as a positive statistical interaction where a causal pathway may be inferred. Thus, castration and high levels of dry cat food intake (usually associated with overfeeding and sometimes related to insufficient water intake) are synergistically associated in the FUS: both may result in inactivity, thereby reducing blood flow to the kidneys, impairing renal function, and therefore promoting changes in the urine that are conducive to the formation of uroliths.",

Some non-oncogenic viruses also are reported to interact with chemical carci nogens (Martin, 1964) . Thus, chickens infected with pox viruses, and mice infected with influenza virus, are more susceptible to chemical carcinogenesis than non-infected animals. Doll (1977) has contended that most cancers have environmental causes either as initiators or prom otors. Investigation of the cause of cancer involves cooperation between several disciplines: biochemis try, pathology, molecular biology and epidemiolo gy. An example of this cooperation is the epidemiological identification of an age-related de terminant of mammary carcinoma, probably associ ated with oestrogen activity, and the detection of steroid hormone receptors in fractions from the cancer, mentioned earlier in this chapter. Further progress includes the demonstration of stimulation of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity (an indicator of growth in the tumour) in tumours previously incubated with oestrogen, and containing receptors for oestrogen (Thomas and Pierrepoint, 1983) .",

Dogs share environments with their owners, but ageing is more rapid than in man; thus assessment of the effects of possible carcinogens can be faster. For example, Bostock and Curtis (1984) described a difference between London and Melbourne in the proportion of canine oral tumours that are squamous cell carcinomas. This suggests that, since the life-styles of dogs in t h e two cities are similar, environmentalfactors may b e responsible for inducing this carcino ma. A comparison of urban dogs with m a n also offers a means of removing the contribution of active smoking t o a possible sufficient cause of lung cancer (Glickman et al., 1983) . Other tumours with similarities between the dog and m a n include spontaneous lymphoma (Johnson et al., 1968) and osteosarcoma, described earlier, where body size appears to be a determinant.",
