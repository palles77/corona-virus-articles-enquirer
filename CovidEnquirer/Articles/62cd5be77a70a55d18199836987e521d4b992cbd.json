C D8 T cells are a critical component to clearing or controlling viral infections. Lack of a virus-specific T cell response is associated with failure to control chronic Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection 1 and loss of virusspecific T cells due to immune suppression during hematopoietic stemcell or solid organ transplant can lead to life-threatening Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) infections 2 . Reconstitution of virus-specific immunity, either through bone marrow transplant [3] [4] [5] or adoptive transfer of virus-specific T cells 6, 7 , can control these persistent infections. In addition, data from influenza has demonstrated that pre-existing virus-specific T cell immunity can protect against lethal infection 8, 9 . Therefore, strategies to manipulate the virus-specific T cell response could lead to clinical therapies to treat chronic infections or prevent mortality related to severe acute infections.",

We expanded virus-specific T cells from healthy and resolved donors and cloned 10 virus-specific TCRs to 5 different viruses restricted to 4 HLA class-I molecules commonly found in the general population. To establish a standardized TCR gene cassette we employed previously published methods to optimize TCR expression with minimal modification to the wild type amino acid sequence [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Our library of 10 TCRs ideally positioned us to probe the specific effects of simple modifications, such as inverting the orientation of the TCR alpha and beta genes in the expression cassette, which led to a significant increase in TCR expression and cytokine production. We also found that the function (IFN-c production) of engineered T cells could be further augmented with the addition of Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands to the culture during the transduction procedure; increasing the frequency of IFN-c producing cells up to 70%. The core library of virus-specific TCRs presented here, each one optimized for expression in primary human T cells, could provide a steppingstone to effective treatments for viral infections.",

Where available, we monitored TCR expression with beta chain specific antibodies and HLApentamers/tetramers. Interestingly, in 9/10 of the TCRs tested, expression of the introduced TCR was better (higher frequency of TCR1 cells) when the TCR beta gene was upstream of the TCR alpha gene in the expression cassette. This was true for staining the beta chain ( Fig. 2B&C ) or with HLA-pentamers/tetramers (Fig. 2E&F ).",

Primary human T cells transduced with both orientations of the TCR cassette were stimulated with specific peptides presented on either HLA-A21 T2 cells or HLA-matched EBV transformed B cell lines. IFN-c production, analyzed by flow cytometry, was used to monitor the frequency of virus-specific CD8 T cells (Fig. 3A) . T cell cytokine production mirrored TCR expression and there was clearly a positive and negative orientation for each TCR construct. Nine out of 10 TCRs resulted in higher frequencies of IFN-c1 T cells in the beta-P2A-alpha orientation whereas only one TCR was superior in the alpha-P2Abeta orientation (Fig. 3B ). When TCRs were grouped according to their positive and negative orientation, we observed a significant difference in their overall functionality, 26.86% vs 12.89% IFN-c1 CD8 T cells (Fig. 3C) .

Once the optimal orientation of the TCR was identified, we focused on augmenting the function of engineered T cells. Adjuvants based on Toll-like receptor ligands can have direct effects on T cells 20 and be selected to mimic infecting pathogens 21 . We used TLR ligands that frequently signal viral infection: polyI:C (TLR-3), Imiquimod (TLR-7), ssRNA40 (TLR-8) and CpG (TLR-9). The TLR ligands were added to the PBMC during the first 48 h of activation prior to transduction. At the time of transduction, the media was changed, the primary T cells were transduced and allowed to expand for 10 days. Following their expansion, we tested TCR expression using HLA-pentamers to determine if the TLR ligands affected TCR expression compared to the standard protocol with IL-2 alone. The TCR presented in Figure 4 (HBV core 18-27) has high affinity for its cognate peptide-MHC, allowing us to monitor TCR expression in both the CD8 and CD4 T cell population using the HLA-pentamer (Fig. 1A) . We found that the addition of TLR ligands to the culture during the first 48 h of activation had little impact on HLA pentamer staining in either the CD8 or CD4 T cell population ( Fig. 4 A,B ,E). However, we observed clear differences in the frequency of functional cells. The addition of polyI:C or ssRNA40 increased the frequency of IFN-c producing CD8 and CD4 T cells compared to IL-2 alone, IL-2 plus CpG or Imiquimod (Fig. 4 C,F ). This increase in the frequency of IFN-c producing cells translated into a 60% and 80% increase in functional CD8 T cells following addition of polyI:C and ssRNA40 respectively to the culture medium (Fig. 4D ). Similar results were observed with CD4 T cells, with ssRNA40 stimulating the greatest increase in IFN-c1 T cell frequency (Fig. 4G) .",

Similar to pentamer staining, TCR beta chain expression was similar across all conditions (Fig. 6D ) and the frequency of IFN-c1 T cells increased with the addition of polyI:C and ssRNA40 (Fig. 6E) .

These approaches have largely been based on the modification of a single TCR in each study. We chose the simplest modifications previously reported in the literature and applied them to our library of 10 different virus-specific TCRs to optimize TCR expression and the antiviral potential of redirected primary human T cells. In line with previous reports, we observed that codon optimization, linking the alpha and beta chains with a P2A sequence, including a glycine-serine-glycine spacer, and the addition of a non-native cysteine disulfide bond in the TCR constructs led to increased expression and pairing. Surprisingly, when we tested whether simply inverting the orientation of the alpha and beta genes within the TCR expression cassette impacted TCR expression and function we found evidence for clear positive (high frequency) and negative (low frequency) orientation. In 9/10 of the TCRs, placing the beta chain upstream of the P2A sequence resulted in enhanced expression. This enhanced expression translated to increased HLA-multimer staining in the non-CD8 T cell population as well, comprised primarily of CD4 T cells, which provide help for virus specific CD8 T cells in vivo 32 .",

There was only a 1.9 fold increase in TCR beta expression dependent on the orientation, suggesting that translation of the proteins was similar despite orientation of the TCR cassette. In contrast, we observed a 4.2 fold increase in HLA multimer staining that was dependent on the orientation. The discrepancy between these two observations remains unclear. Unlike internal ribosome entry sites (IRES), the P2A linker results in nearly equimolar production of both the alpha and beta chains 13 . Therefore, there should be equal production despite the orientation. The difference may be related to the stability of individual TCR alpha and beta proteins. The TCR alpha chain is rapidly targeted for ER associated degradation. This is the rate-limiting step in TCR complex expression in developing thymocytes 33 and this instability carries over to TCR expression in mature T cells 34, 35 . Therefore, translating the beta chain first may facilitate TCR alpha/beta heterodimer formation and stability; as the downstream alpha chain is translated it can rapidly pair with beta.",
