            "text": "A purified recombinant spike (S) protein was studied for its effect on stimulating human peripheral blood monocyte macrophages (PBMC). We examined inflammatory gene mRNA abundances found in S protein-treated PBMC using gene arrays. We identified differential mRNA abundances of genes with functional properties associated with antiviral (CXCL10) and inflammatory (IL-6 and IL-8) responses. We confirmed cytokine mRNA increases by real-time quantitative(q) RT-PCR or ELISA. We further analyzed the sensitivity and specificity of the prominent IL-8 response. By real-time qRT-PCR, S protein was shown to stimulate IL-8 mRNA accumulation in a dose dependent manner while treatment with E protein did not. Also, titration of S protein-specific production and secretion of IL-8 by ELISA showed that the dose of 5.6 nM of S produced a significant increase in IL-8 (p = 0.003) compared to mock-treated controls. The increase in IL-8 stimulated by a concentration of 5.6 nM of S was comparable to concentrations seen for S protein binding to ACE2 or to neutralizing monoclonal antibody suggesting a physiological relevance. An NF-B inhibitor, TPCK (N-Tosyl-L-Phenylalanine Chloromethyl Ketone) could suppress IL-8 production and secretion in response to S protein in PBMC and THP-1 cells and in HCoV-229E virus-infected PBMC. Activation and translocation of NF-B was shown to occur rapidly following exposure of PBMC or THP-1 cells to S protein using a highly sensitive assay for active nuclear NF-B p65 transcription factor. The results further suggested that released or secreted S protein could activate blood monocytes through recognition by toll-like receptor (TLR)2 ligand.",

The RNA from in vitro PBMC cultures was reverse transcribed to cDNA using the reverse transcriptase kit from Promega (Promega Inc, Madison WI). Relative abundance of each mRNA species was quantitated using real-time quantitative PCR using specific primers: \u2424-Actin, (Primers were synthesized by Invitrogen or Integrated DNA Technologies, Skokie, IL.) Using Brilliant \u00ae SYBR \u00ae green Q-PCR master mix from Stratagene (Stratagene Inc, La Jolla CA.) to provide precise quantification of initial target in each PCR reaction, the amplification plot was examined at a point during the early log phase of product accumulation. This is accomplished by assigning a fluorescence threshold above background and determining the time point at which each sample's amplification plot reached the threshold (defined as the threshold cycle number or C T ). The threshold is a numerical value assigned automatically by the software for each run above the calculated baseline. The C T value assigned to a particular sample thus reflects the point during the amplification reaction at which sufficient number of amplicons has accumulated above the baseline. After a suitable threshold is selected, the data are analyzed and C T values for each sample determined. Differences in threshold cycle number (C T ) are used to quantify the relative amount of PCR target contained within each tube. Relative expression of mRNA species is calculated using the comparative C T method. Briefly, for each sample, the difference in C T values ( C T ) was calculated for each mRNA by taking the mean C T of duplicate tubes and subtracting the mean C T of the duplicate tubes for the reference RNA (\u2424-Actin) measured on an aliquot from the same RT-reaction.",

PBMC cultures (10 4 -10 5 cells) or THP-1 cultures (10 6 cells) were pretreated with 25 M TPCK for 20 min, followed by S protein treatment and incubation in the presence of TPCK for 24 h.

We found highly variable basal IL-8 levels between different individuals. However, after S protein treatment IL-8 levels were highly elevated. Similarly, Huang et al. (2006) found that in acute phase SARS patient sera, levels of IL-8 were highly variable but were significantly different from healthy controls. In genetic studies, differential expression between the IL8 promoter variant alleles showed significant association (p < 0.001) with cystic fibrosis lung disease severity (Hillian et al., 2008) . Our results showed that S protein at concentrations 5.6 nM significantly increased IL-8 mRNA abundance in PBMC. IL-8 production and secretion could be enhanced in PBMC by more than one mechanism including direct activation by S protein and indirect priming via IL-8 receptor which was shown to be increased in SARS patients (Yu et al., 2005) . Secreted spike could be produced during virus infection (Pulford and Britton, 1991) .",

            "text": "Since the SARS syndrome is characterized by an uncontrolled inflammatory response and NF-B is the major transcription factor activated in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Fan et al., 2001) , we sought to determine whether S protein-induced IL-8 production is mediated by NF-B activation. We examined the activity of the NF-B inhibitor, TPCK. This NF-B inhibitor acts by inhibiting IKB\u2423 protease so that IKB\u2423 is not proteolytically degraded and NF-B is not released to undergo nuclear translocation (Henkel et al., 1993) . We observed that the addition of TPCK before treatment with S protein significantly inhibited IL-8 secretion suggesting that NF-B activation was required for S protein-induced IL-8 secretion. TPCK partially inhibited IL-8 secretion in HCoV-229E-infected PBMC and also reduced the virus yield. These effects on HCoV-229Einfected PBMC could be due to inhibition of proteases and possibly to induction of apoptosis (Zhu et al., 1997) . HCoV-229E spike resembles SARS-CoV spike. Both SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E spikes do not contain furin recognition sites and are uncleaved in the virion . Cathepsin L cleavage separates the receptor-binding subunit (S1) from the membrane anchored fusion subunit . Both viruses use clathrin-mediated endocytosis for ACE2 or CD13 (human aminopeptidase N) receptor mediated entry (Yeager et al., 1992; Inoue et al., 2007) . Inhibitors of cathepsin L, a cysteine protease, block cell fusion and entry via endocytosis for both viruses (Bosch et al., 2008; Li et al., 2006; Kawase et al., 2009) . TPCK is an inhibitor of chymotrypsin-like serine proteases and prevents MHV spike cleavage in L2 cells (Mizzen et al., 1986) . This class of inhibitors did not block SARS S1 cleavage from the spike trimer . However, Factor Xa, a membrane bound protease, could cleave SARS S protein into functional S1 and S2 subunits and Ben-HCl, an inhibitor of trypsin and serine proteases, inhibited cleavage and effectively blocked viral entry (Du et al., 2007) . Thus, in addition to NF-B inhibition, TPCK might prevent S protein cleavage. Further work is necessary to address this issue.",

We found a significant increase in nuclear NF-B p65 transcription factor activity in S protein-treated PBMC and THP-1 cells compared to mock treatment. This indicated that S protein caused a specific activation of NF-B signaling. Chang et al. (2004) suggested that in hACE2 receptor positive lung epithelial and fibroblast cells, SARS S1 protein induced IL-8 via AP-1 activator through hACE2 signaling. We found that TLR2 expression was sufficient to allow for IL-8 production in response to S protein. TLR2, like all TLRs, activates a common signaling pathway that culminates in the activation of NF-B ( Barton and Medzhitov, 2003) . TLR2 is predominantly expressed at high levels on macrophages in humans and can be activated by several viruses or viral components (Finberg et al., 2007) . Plasmacytoid cells use the TLR pathway for viral defense (Barton and Medzhitov, 2003) . Other cells use cytosolic RNA receptors RIG1-like helicases (RLHs) and MDA-5 (Uematsu and Akria, 2007) and nucleic acid recognizing TLRs 3,7,8 and 9 that are critical in the regulation of the production of type 1 IFNs in response to virus infection (Finberg et al., 2007) . TLR2 is not an IFN\u2424 inducer (Barton and Medzhitov, 2003) . IFN\u2424 mRNA did not increase in S protein-treated PBMC in our experiments (data not shown). TLR2 mRNA was shown to be increased in PBMC from acute phase SARS patients (Reghunathan et al., 2005) . Further work is underway to confirm our observations.",

S protein induction was dose dependent. A dose of 5.6 nM per 2 \u00d7 10 5 PBMC increased IL-8 secretion significantly compared to mock-treated controls. The ability of S protein to increase IL-8 mRNA was mediated by activation of NF-B possibly via TLR2 ligand and could be inhibited by the NF-B inhibitor TPCK. The ability to detect elevated NF-B transcription factor activity in the nucleus in response to S protein suggests that this most likely occurs by the mechanism of induction. Moreover increased secretion of IL-8 and IL-6 cytokines indicated that levels of proinflammatory mediators could be enhanced by S protein interaction with monocyte macrophages and could stimulate NK, neutrophil and monocyte migration to the site of infection.",
