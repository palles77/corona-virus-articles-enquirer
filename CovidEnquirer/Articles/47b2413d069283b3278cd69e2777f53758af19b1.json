MK-DIECs are cuboidal (characteristic of epithelial cells), express epithelial marker (pan-cytokeratin), and show extensive proliferation in culture. Several coronaviruses, including PEDV, use aminopeptidase N (APN) as the cellular receptor for attachment to cells (6) . As a first step, we used a rabbit polyclonal anti-human APN antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) in an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) to examine whether MK-DIECs express APN. We found that nearly 100% of the cells expressed APN on their surface (online Technical Appendix Figure 1 , http://wwwnc. cdc.gov/EID/article/21/3/14-1658-Techapp1.pdf).",

At 12, 24, and 36 h after infection, released virus in infected cells was quantified by virus titration in Vero cells by inoculating 10fold serial dilutions.

PEDV also induced cytopathic effects (CPEs) in these cells, which were characterized by rounding of cells, syncytium formation, and cell detachment. The CPEs were more pronounced in cells infected with added trypsin; as little as 2.5 \u00b5g/mL of trypsin in infection medium was sufficient to induce substantial CPEs in infected cells (Figure, panel  B) . No signs of CPEs were observed in uninfected control cells, and cells did not display any trypsin-mediated toxicity. The virus titers were detectable in PEDV-infected cells 12 h after infection. The titers further increased at 24 h, reaching a peak at 36 h after infection. Infected cells in infection medium with 10 \u00b5g /mL added trypsin had the highest titers (online Technical Appendix Figure 2 ).",

For clinicians, approved drugs are an attractive solution because of known safety profiles and availability.Oral lamivudine (GlaxoSmithKline, Brentford, UK), a US Food and Drug Administration-approved anti-HIV drug, has been suggested as a possible antiviral agent against Ebola virus (EBOV). In September 2014, a Liberian physician, Dr. Gorbee Logan, reported positive results while treating EVD with lamivudine (1). Thirteen of 15 patients treated with lamivudine survived presumed EVD and were declared virus free. Clinical confirmation of EVD in these cases remains to be verified.Our laboratory had previously assessed this antiretroviral compound in drug screens against EBOV and observed no discernable antiviral activity. However, given",
