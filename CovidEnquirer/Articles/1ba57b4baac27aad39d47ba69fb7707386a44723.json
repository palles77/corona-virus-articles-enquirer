Although effective, the laboratory techniques based primarily on the optical analytical principle, such as immunoassays, require sample enrichment and purification before analysis. Moreover, they are expensive and slow. Thus, strategies for signal amplification have been recently proposed to increase immunoassay sensitivity for further clinical diagnostics [2] . Sensors and biosensors have been extensively studied for their role in detecting and monitoring different types of analytes for food safety, environmental monitoring, clinical analysis and medical diagnosis [3] . Immunosensors have been considered in clinical diagnostics for the detection and identification of cardiac and cancer biomarkers. This is key to developing point-of-care technologies that can analyse real biological samples (for continuous monitoring of physiologically important analytes) in routine clinical use [4] .",

            "text": "Three main types of sensors and biosensors are commonly used based on their transduction principle: electrochemical, optical and piezoelectric-based sensors and biosensors. Electrochemical biosensors are self-contained integrated devices that can provide specific quantitative or semiquantitative analytical information using a biological recognition element in direct contact with an electrochemical transduction element (e.g., a pair of electrodes or fieldeffect transistors (FETs)) [5] . Thus, electrochemical biosensors monitor electroactive species that are produced or consumed by the action of the biological elements, based on potentiometric, amperometric or impedimetric transduction principles [6] . The analytical output in optical sensors is a result of the interaction of the analyte with the transducer in terms of optical properties such as absorbance, reflectance, luminescence, fluorescence, refractive index and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) [6] . Piezoelectric sensors employ materials that resonate when an external alternating electrical field is applied. Here, quartz crystals are used to produce an oscillating electric field in which the resonant frequency of the crystal depends on its chemical nature, size, shape and mass [6] . According to recent studies, the electrochemical principle is mainly applied in clinical sensors and biosensors [4, [7] [8] [9] [10] . For example, electrochemical immunosensors are used in clinical diagnostics as point-of-care devices, as they are portable, simple, easy to use, cost-effective and disposable in most cases. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated the benefits of using electrochemical immunosensors for cardiac and cancer biomarkers [4] . In addition, various nanomaterials can be incorporated into electrochemical biosensors for additional benefits [1] . Similarly, implantable electrochemical biosensors can be used as point-of-care devices to monitor individual subjects continuously in vivo and make a personalized diagnosis, as several functions are combined in individual microchips [1, 11] .",

For example, to detect clinically significant biomarkers, the following nanomaterials have been incorporated into sensors: nanowires (NWs) synthesized from metals (e.g., Ni, Cu, Au and Pt), metal oxides (ZnO, SnO2 and Fe2O3) and silicon/ indium/gallium semiconductors (Si, InP, GaN); quantum dots based on CdSe, CdTe or CdSeTe; carbon nanotubes (CNTs); and metal nanoparticles (based on Au, Cu, Pd, Co, Ag or Pt) [1, 9, 13] . CNTs have been used as transduction elements in biosensors to detect and quantify proteins, neurotransmitters and cancer biomarkers [1] . In addition, nanotechnologies help miniaturize biosensing platforms, thus consuming lesser power, and requiring lower sample volumes, shorter assay times and low operating costs. Furthermore, when used in sensors and biosensors, NWs confer several nanomaterial properties such as mechanical stiffness, high carrier mobility, thermal conductivity, high surface-to-volume ratio and improved electron transfer of CNT, as well as the high surface-tovolume ratio and electrical current capacity [13] .",

Based on classical (univariate) calibration, it is defined by the change in analytical response of the instrument divided by the corresponding change in stimulus (concentration of the analyte of interest), that is the slope of the analytical calibration curve [17] . Nanotechnology has been applied to enhance the performance of biosensors.

            "text": "Nanomaterials have been incorporated into sensors and biosensors to increase biocompatibility, additional binding sites and signal intensities (through enhanced electrical properties), thus improving the sensitivity and specificity of the detection [14, 19] . In their work, Zhang et al. [20] , Zhang et al. [21] , Baek et al. [22] , Feng et al. [23] , Wang et al. [24] , Wang and Zheng [25] , Lozano et al. [26] , Guo et al. [27] and Sun et al. [28] studied the effect of nanomaterials (i.e., gold nanoparticles, ZnO nanoparticles, ZnOgold nanocomposites and CNTs) on the analytical performance of sensors and biosensors (i.e., in terms of sensitivity, LOD, concentration range and stability). In their study on electrochemical DNA sensors, Zhang et al. [20] showed that the presence of gold nanoparticles significantly enhanced the sensitivity and LOD. In the absence of gold nanoparticles, the peak current was found to increase only slightly upon hybridization with 1 \u03bcM DNA target. Upon amplification with gold nanoparticles, the peak current was significantly enhanced even with a 10-pM DNA target. Thus, the presence of gold nanoparticles allows highly sensitive DNA detection [20] . Moreover, the LOD (10 fM) is lower with gold amplification, as the sensor only detects a 0.5-nM target DNA without gold nanoparticle amplification. Zhang et al. [21] also showed an improvement in LOD with the incorporation of gold nanoparticles. They [21] developed a microfluidic bead-based immunosensor to detect \u03b1-fetoprotein using horseradish peroxidase coupled with gold nanoparticles for signal amplification. The sensitivity of the target analyte was significantly enhanced, as the gold nanoparticles offered a large surface area for the binding of enzymes on each nanosphere [21] . The immunosensor showed a 50-fold increase in LOD compared with immunosensors without gold nanoparticles. Baek et al. [22] developed an optical sensor for thrombin based on the SPR principle. They applied a dual-nanoparticle amplification strategy: gold nanoparticles of two different shapes (nanorods and quasi-spherical nanoparticles) were incorporated in the sensor. With real-time SPR measurements to detect target concentrations as low as 0.1 aM, the authors found a 10-fold improvement compared to methods that used only single nanoparticles [22] . Feng et al. [23] showed that the LOD of electrochemical sensors used in DNA hybridization recognition was significantly enhanced. This was a result of the synergistic effect of two nanomaterials (gold nanoparticles and polyaniline nanotube membranes), a combination of very large surface areas and excellent conductivities. These sensors display a significantly lower LOD (3.1 \u00d7 10 \u221213 mol L \u22121 ) for DNA detection versus the LOD ranging from 1.4 \u00d7 10 \u221212 to 2.4 \u00d7 10 \u221211 mol L \u22121 for other sensors [23] . Incorporating metal semiconductor compounds such as ZnO in conjugation with gold nanoparticles can enhance the detection sensitivity of SPR sensors. In this respect, Wang et al. [24] developed an SPR biosensor based on ZnO-gold nanocomposites to detect human immunoglobulin M (hIgM). The biosensor displays an analytical response to hIgM in the concentration range of 0.30-20.00 \u03bcg mL \u22121 . Without ZnO-gold nanocomposites, the biosensor responds to hIgM in the concentration range of 1.25-20.00 \u03bcg mL \u22121 . Wang et al. [24] also showed enhanced sensitivity of biosensors based on ZnO-gold nanocomposites to determine hIgM. They reported a maximum shift of resonant wavelength (analytical response at 20.00 \u03bcg mL \u22121 ) of 7.53 nm compared to the 4.10 nm in sensors with a gold film only. In another work, Wang and Zheng [25] reported the threefold improved sensitivity of an electrochemical sensor based on glass carbon electrode for hydrogen peroxide with the electrodeposition of silver nanoparticles on a ZnO film, compared with similar sensors without ZnO. The improved stability of sensors with ZnO was verified by a 2% decrease in analytical response, compared with the 30% drop in response for sensors without ZnO films. According to Wang and Zheng [25] , ZnO immobilizes inorganic nanoparticles, facilitates the formation and more intensive distribution of small silver nanoparticles and thus improves the stability of the sensor. Lozano et al. [26] developed an electrochemical sensor based on a CNT paste electrode (CNTPE) with polymer electrogenerated from Fe(III)-5-amino-1,10-phenanthroline solution for detecting glucose, compared with a similar sensor based on graphite paste electrode (CPE). The CNT was found to be crucial for generating poly(Fe(III)-5-amino-1,10-phenanthroline). In turn, the CNTPE/poly(Fe(III)-5-amino-1,10-phenanthroline) increased the sensitivity 200-fold at \u22120.100 V (sensitivity of 130 \u03bcA M \u22121 ), versus that obtained with CPE/poly(Fe(III)-5-amino-1,10-phenanthroline) with a sensitivity of 0.65 \u03bcA M \u22121 . Guo et al. [27] recently studied the effect of gold nanoparticle aggregation in DNA colorimetric sensors. Gold dimers (selectively formed upon target binding) significantly improved the long-term stability (approximately 10-fold) and the dynamic range of detection (approximately more than two orders of magnitude) compared with conventional colorimetric sensors, which had larger nanoparticle aggregates. Sun et al. [28] proposed a multilayer film based on gold nanoparticles and polyaniline/ carboxylated multiwalled CNT (MWCNT)-chitosan nanocomposites used in an electrochemical immunosensor to detect chlorpyrifos. The analytical response of the immunosensor -in terms of the change in reduction peak current before and after immunoreaction -was enhanced after the gold nanoparticles were adsorbed onto the surface of the polyaniline/carboxylated MWCNT-chitosan nanocomposite film due to fast direct electron transfer, facilitated by the gold nanoparticles [28] . Thus, the authors concluded that gold nanoparticles on the nanocomposite film enhance the electrochemical signal and adsorption capacity of antibodies, ultimately enhancing the detection sensitivity. Wei et al. [29] studied electrochemical sensors using multilayer electrodes, that is, thin layers of polymers, nanoparticles or nanoparticle-polymer composites stacked on top of the electrode. They attributed the high sensitivity of these sensors to their action as a three-dimensional (3D) matrix for capturing nucleotide probes and reducing interference from nonspecific molecules, which can contribute to background noise.",

            "text": "Other researchers have reported enhanced analytical signal and sensitivity with the incorporation of gold nanoparticles, quantum dots and graphene [30] [31] [32] [33] . For example, Kavosi et al. [30] constructed an electrochemical immunosensor to detect \u03b1-fetoprotein. In this sensor, polyamidoamine dendrimer-encapsulated gold nanoparticles were immobilized as the sensing interface on a gold electrode. The gold nanocomposite increased the sensitivity of the immunosensor, as it amplified the signal due to its high conductivity and remarkably large surface area [30] . According to the authors, only a small response was noted when \u03b1-fetoprotein was incubated with its antibody being directly exposed to the gold electrode, as well as a slightly larger response (10-fold increase) when \u03b1-fetoprotein interacted with the gold nanocomposite-modified electrode. The signal amplification was attributed to the large specific surface area of the gold nanocomposite, which possessed several surface functional groups that captured more antibodies at the sensing interface, and the accelerated electron transfer [30] . Quantum dots, nanoparticles with ten thousands of metal ions, can also be used for signal amplification of sensors. For example, Zhou et al. [31] incorporated CdS quantum dots and gold nanoparticles labelled with antibodies into an electrochemiluminescence immunosensor to detect \u03b1-fetoprotein with amplified signal. According to the authors, the signal intensity from the CdS/gold composite film is about 2.5-fold higher than that from the pure CdS film. This was attributed to the significant catalytic activity and enhanced electrical conductivity of the gold nanoparticles, which in turn increased the detection sensitivity [31] . Xie et al. [32] fabricated an electrogenerated chemiluminescence assay to detect thrombin, using CdSe/ZnS quantum dots as sensing probe on a graphene-modified glassy carbon electrode covered with gold nanoparticles. Xie et al. [32] confirmed that the analytical signal in the absence of quantum dots was very low; further, the electrogenerated chemiluminescence intensity increased greatly with the addition of quantum dots (coupled with avidin and DNA). Du et al. [33] incorporated graphene sheets in the sensor platform and functionalized carbon nanospheres labelled with horseradish peroxidase in an electrochemical immunosensor to detect \u03b1-fetoprotein with dual signal amplification. Thus, the graphene-modified immunosensor with carbon nanosphere labelling showed a sevenfold increase in detection signal and enhanced sensitivity compared to conventional unmodified immunosensors [33] . According to the authors, graphene offers a large surface area to capture more antibodies on the electrode surface, in addition to accelerating electron transfer, thus amplifying the signal.",

            "text": "Nanomaterials characteristics such as CNT density [34] [35] [36] and CNT width channel [37] have been shown to affect the analytical performance of sensors and biosensors, due to their effect on figures of merit such as the signal-to-noise ratio, reproducibility, sensitivity and LOD. Ishikawa et al. [35] studied the effect of controlling the density of a network of single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) on the analytical performance of FET devices. They classified the density of nanotubes as low, medium and high based on the time of incubation in ferritin solution, which is associated with the density of the catalyst. Ishikawa et al. [35] concluded that the lower the CNT density the higher the sensitivity in relation to LOD and magnitude of response, as well as the reproducibility of such biosensors. They [35] attributed the increased sensitivity arising from the low density of SWCNTs in part to the elimination of direct metallic nanotube pathways. This enhances the semiconductor behaviour of nanotubes, lowers the capacitance and increases the ON/OFF ratios, whereas the high density of SWCNTs reflects their quasi-metallic behaviour. The sensing performance of these devices was investigated using streptavidin as a model analyte. However, the optimized FET devices were ultimately used to detect nucleocaspid protein, a biomarker associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. Based on the plot of the analytical signal (normalized conductance vs. log of the streptavidin concentration) of each device with different nanotube density, devices with low density of nanotubes showed the strongest response whereas those with a high density of nanotubes showed the weakest response. The LOD was estimated to range from 100 pM to 1 nM, 10 to 100 pM and 1 pM to 10 pM for high-, medium-and low-density devices, respectively. Fu et al. [34] also verified the effect of nanotube density on the sensitivity of FET devices. In FET biosensors with networks of SWCNTs for detecting DNA molecules, they found that the nanotube density increased the ON/OFF ratios from 5 to 2000 with high and low SWCNT density, respectively, and increased the LOD from 10 pM to 0.1 fM with high and low SWCNT density, respectively. The DNA molecules served as impurities and caused carrier charge scattering, which significantly increased the ON/OFF ratio. The ON/OFF ratio increased more with lower SWCNT densities, due to lesser number of metallic SWCNT percolative paths. Recently, Okuda et al. [36] designed a electrolyte-gated sensor based on an FET composed of horizontally aligned multiple SWCNTs synthesized on singlecrystal quartz for the label-free immunosensing of human immunoglobulin E. The drain current (analytical response) of the sensors with aligned channels exhibited a drain current 400 times that of single-channel devices, with considerably smaller fluctuations in drain current. The calculated residual standard deviation (RSD) was 2.4% and 0.05% for the single-and aligned-channel FET, respectively, which indicated their high sensitivity and easy application [36] . In studying the effect of CNT width channel on the analytical performance of sensors, Lee et al. [37] developed highly sensitive nanoscale sensors for Hg 2+ by controlling the structure of aligned SWCNT networks. They [37] concluded that a better signalto-noise ratio and a higher sensitivity are obtained with narrower channels than with wider channels, due to a decrease in the effective length of the current paths (i.e., damaged current paths decrease the conductivity of SWCNT channels). Moreover, the LOD increased from 10 nM using 2-\u03bcm-wide SWCNT network sensors to 1 pM using 100-nm-wide SWCNT network sensors. Lee et al. [37] also obtained mathematical relations between SWCNT channel width and sensitivity (sensitivity~width \u22121.6 ) and between SWCNT channel width and signal-to-noise ratio (signal-to-noise ratio~width \u22121.1 ).",

The sensitivity of sensors can be enhanced by using low NWs, larger NW diameters and lower doping concentration and by improving the LOD in sensors with lower doping concentration. In their work, Li et al. [38] tested sensors based on NWs to detect human immunoglobulin G (hIgG) as a model analyte. On testing NWbased sensors with different numbers of NWs, Li et al. [38] revealed a decrease in sensitivity with increasing number of NWs; that is, devices with a larger number of NWs (four and seven NW-based devices) were less sensitive (decrease of~38 and~82%, respectively) than those with just one NW. The authors attribute this decrease in sensitivity to the depletion of hIgG molecules from the surrounding solution. This reduces the binding events between the NW and analyte, resulting in smaller current changes in these sensing devices. Li et al. [38] tested NW-based sensors with different NW diameters ranging from 60 to 80, 81 to 100 and 101 to 120 nm. They found that sensors with larger NW diameter (81-100 and 101-120 nm) exhibited a greater decrease in sensitivity (~37%) compared to devices with thinner NWs of 60-80-nm diameter (decrease in sensitivity of~16%). This was due to the decrease in the surface-to-volume ratio of thick wires at the micrometre order. Conversely, Li et al. [38] noted that a change in doping concentration by two orders of magnitude increased the biosensor sensitivity 3.2-fold; that is, a 69% increase in sensitivity led to a decrease in NW doping from 10 19 to 10 17 atoms cm \u22123 . Li et al. [38] also observed that NW-based sensors with a doping concentration of 10 17 atoms cm \u22123 had a lower LOD for hIgG (~10 fg mL \u22121 ) than sensors with 10 19 (LOD of~10 pg mL \u22121 ).",

[39] proposed an optical biosensor based on the SPR principle, with the presence of labelled molecules (strongly absorbing dye molecules) significantly enhancing the sensitivity and specificity of the SPR sensor. Two simple model assays were used to demonstrate the performance of this method: the small molecule assay was used to demonstrate the increased sensitivity of label SPR, with the sensor containing bovine serum albumin (BSA) and avidin. The DNA assay was used to demonstrate the increased selectivity of the assay, with the sensor containing single-stranded DNA bound to the surfacebound avidin [39] . According to the authors, the sensitivity is significantly enhanced (100-fold) compared with conventional label-free SPR. In addition, the influence of noise factors such as temperature, pressure and bulk liquid composition variations is also significantly reduced with label-enhanced SPR sensing [39] . However, the specificity was very high and stable in the presence of the label, which reduces nonspecific binding [39] .",

[40] developed an electrochemiluminescence immunosensor to detect human cardiac troponin I (cTnI). They used N-(aminobutyl)-N-(ethylisoluminol)functionalized gold nanoparticles (ABEI-functionalized gold nanoparticles) as labels for the attachment of antibodies. Here, ABEI, a derivative of isoluminol, was used as an electrochemiluminescence reagent, which is more efficient than luminol when chemically attached to specific analytes. Thus, it is a suitable label for bioassays [40] . Shen et al. [40] tested three kinds of probes including ABEI, luminol-and ABEI-functionalized gold nanoparticles. They showed that the immunoassay system using ABEI-functionalized gold nanoparticles as the label exhibited a higher analytical signal than those using other labels; that is, the electrochemiluminescence intensity of ABEI-functionalized gold nanoparticles is 12.5-fold greater than the intensity of ABEI and 1.5-fold greater than that of luminolfunctionalized gold nanoparticles. Thus, the assay with ABEIfunctionalized gold nanoparticles as the label showed increased sensitivity [40] . In another work, Su et al. [41] developed an electrochemical immunosensor to detect \u03b1-fetoprotein using nanogoldenclosed titania nanoparticles to label antibodies. They [41] demonstrated that the electrochemical signal was significantly amplified with nanogold-enclosed titania nanoparticles compared with pure nanogold or titania-based labels. This is in turn increased the sensitivity of the immunosensor to \u03b1-fetoprotein. Zhang et al. [42] produced an electrochemiluminescence immunosensor to detect cancer biomarkers with Ru-silica capped onto a nanoporous gold composite as the label. This electrochemiluminescence label was found to amplify the signal, greatly increase the sensitivity and extend the detectable concentration range by two orders of magnitude.",

According to the authors, the response of the SPR biosensor with the magnetic nanoparticles is~17 times greater than that without magnetic nanoparticles, due to the larger mass and higher refractive index of the magnetic nanoparticles [44] . In addition, the sensitivity of human chorionic gonadotropin detection was increased by four orders of magnitude compared with the regular SPR sensor for direct detection. This was also attributed to the larger mass and higher refractive index of magnetic nanoparticles [44] . In another work, Liu et al.

These include thermal stability, reusability and ease of modification for their immobilization by incorporating reporter molecules (e.g., fluorophores or enzymes) and functional groups [12] . Furthermore, they offer more advantages than antibodies as they are versatile, do not need animal sources and have a higher surface density of receptors [12] . They improve the analytical performance of sensors and biosensors primarily by increasing the LOD. Yao et al. [46] compared the performance of a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) biosensor using two types of recognition elements, aptamer and antibody, in detecting immunoglobulin E (IgE) in human serum. Aptamers or antibodies specific to IgE were immobilized on the gold surface of a quartz crystal, and the frequency shifts of the QCM were measured. The linear range of the antibodybased QCM (10-240 \u03bcg L \u22121 ) was comparable to that of the aptamerbased QCM (2.5-200 \u03bcg L \u22121 ); however, a lower LOD was reported in the latter (2.5 \u03bcg L \u22121 ) than in the former (10 \u03bcg L \u22121 ). The authors contended that the aptamers could tolerate the repeated affine layer regeneration after ligand binding, recycling the biosensor with little loss of sensitivity. When stored for three weeks, the frequency shifts of the aptamer-coated crystals were greater than 90% of the shifts in response on the first day [46] .",

In addition, the LOD is 10-fold lesser than that of a conventional sensor with a single horseradish peroxidase label. DNAzymes, catalytic nucleic acids containing deoxyribozyme, have also been used as recognition elements. It is synthesized by the SELEX (systemic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) technique, generating well-ordered, threedimensional structures that catalyse specific chemical reactions [48] .

They offer several advantages such as high selectivity, stability, short time of synthesis, high thermostability and cost-effectiveness. As they can potentially replace biological antibodies, they are also known as artificial antibodies or plastic antibodies [12] . They have been used in sensors and biosensors to enhance the analytical signal, sensitivity and LOD. Gholivand et al. [51] fabricated a selective and sensitive electrochemical sensor to detect propylparaben, based on a nanosized molecularly imprinted polymer-carbon paste electrode. This electrode possesses high recognition ability compared with a non-imprinted polymer-carbon paste electrode. The analytical signal obtained with cyclic voltammograms was recorded. The signal of the molecularly imprinted polymer-based sensor was found to be higher than that of the non-imprinted polymer-based sensor. This indicates that the molecularly imprinted polymer significantly absorbs propylparaben from the aqueous solution, compared with the non-imprinted polymer-based sensor [51] . In another work, Kong et al. [52] fabricated an electrochemical sensor for ascorbic acid using a molecularly imprinted copolymer, poly(o-phenylenediamine-co-oaminophenol) as the recognition element, noting a high sensitivity and selectivity. Compared with a polypyrrole-based sensor for ascorbic acid (concentrations ranging from 250 to 7000 \u03bcM and LOD of 74 \u03bcM), the analytical performance of the imprinted copolymer sensor was enhanced (concentrations ranging between 100 and 10,000 \u03bcM, and an LOD of 50 \u03bcM). This is attributed to the broadened usable pH range of poly(o-phenylenediamine-co-oaminophenol) (from pH 1.0 to pH 8.0) [52] . The sensor also showed good reproducibility and stability, and it has been successfully used to determine ascorbic acid in real samples. However, the lack of simple and robust techniques for synthesizing molecularly imprinted polymers can limit their practical applications in future. This is because different combinations between monomers and crosslinkers are needed to obtain selective molecularly imprinted polymers. The main limitation to their use in sensors and biosensors is that they cannot be easily integrated into transducers. Thus, more research into enhancing the analytical signal is needed. Protein detection is also limited with these sensors because a threedimensional element is commonly lacking at the polymer surface.",

Thus, the figures of merit of these sensing systems, such as sensitivity and LOD, can be enhanced. For example, Yamamoto et al. [53] fabricated CNTbased FET biosensors to detect BSA, which showed enhanced sensitivity (by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio) with AC measurement instead of DC measurement. They showed that AC measurement with a lock-in amplifier suppresses the drain current fluctuations in these biosensors without decreasing the signal level. Thus, the noise level of FET biosensors used in buffer solutions decreased considerably with AC measurement. The signal-to-noise ratio of sensors measured using AC was six times greater than that obtained using DC. Although the sensors were tested for BSA, they can be used to detect several other compounds with the AC measurement. Recently, March et al. [54] proposed a highly sensitive and versatile QCM immunosensor with high fundamental frequency (HFF) for pesticide (carbaryl and thiabendazole) analysis. They also estimated the sensitivity of conventional QCM sensors via a novel electronic characterization approach based on phase change measurements at a constant fixed frequency. In general, the current already established, commercialized systems employ frequencies ranging from 5 to 20 MHz. However, a suitable HFF is necessary for liquid applications requiring sensitive detection of small changes [54] . March et al. [54] verified that the QCM immunosensor with an HFF of 100 MHz was most sensitive. On comparing these results with those reported for the 9-MHz QCM, an increase of one order of magnitude in sensitivity and two orders of magnitude in LOD was found (sensitivity of 30 \u03bcg L \u22121 and 0.66 \u03bcg L \u22121 , and LOD of 11 \u03bcg L \u22121 and 0.14 \u03bcg L \u22121 , for 9 and 100 MHz, respectively). A 50-MHz QCM was also tested, and both the sensitivity (1.95 \u03bcg L \u22121 ) and LOD (0.23 \u03bcg L \u22121 ) were found to have intermediate values in relation to the previous two tested QCM sensors [54] .",

            "text": "PSA is the most commonly used tumour marker to diagnose prostate cancer, in terms of its concentration in blood, at levels greater than 4.0 ng mL \u22121 (Table 3 ). Various biosensors have been proposed for the detection of PSA in serum samples, as shown in Table 2 . For example, Yang et al. [55] and Li et al. [56] used electrochemical immunosensors to detect PSA in human serum samples, by functionalizing graphene sheets with CdS quantum dots and cobalt hexacyanoferrate nanocomposites, respectively, to immobilize antibodies. Yang et al. [55] obtained a greater LOD (0.003 ng mL \u22121 ) and wider linear range (0.005-10 ng mL \u22121 ) compared to those obtained by Li et al. [56] , 0.01 ng mL \u22121 and 0.01-2 ng mL \u22121 , respectively. Fig. 1 shows a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of graphene sheets (Fig. 1i) , with a transparent and paper-like structure, and a TEM image of graphene sheets functionalized with quantum dots (Fig. 1ii) , with a large number of quantum dots on the surface of graphene sheets [55] . In Fig. 1iii , the ultravioletvisible (UV-Vis) spectra of graphene sheets (curve a), quantum dots (curve b) and quantum dot-graphene sheets (curve c) are depicted. No absorption peak was noted for graphene sheets. However, two absorption peaks were observed around 250 and 440 nm for pure quantum dots, and the two peaks shifted to 240 and 400 nm for quantum dots anchored onto graphene sheets [55] . In addition, Fig. 1iv compares the analytical response of the immunosensor using square wave voltammograms of the quantum dots on bare and graphene-modified electrodes. The peak current (at \u22120.8 V) was found to be three times greater with the graphene-modified 4.69 \u03bcA ng \u22121 mL \u22122 CV = 5.6%; n = 5 r = 0.992 [75] (continued on next page) (continued on next page) electrode than with the bare electrode (only with quantum dots), exhibiting an acceptable response for further biosensing of PSA. According to Yang et al. [55] , graphene sheets offer a very large surface area for the immobilization of several quantum dots, thus increasing the sensitivity of the immunosensor. In addition, the authors attributed the low LOD to the large amount of antibodies immobilized to the graphene sheet-modified electrode and the good conductivity of the graphene sheets, which in turn increased the sensitivity of Cd 2+ (from the CdS quantum dots). The immunosensor successfully detected PSA in serum samples, as the PSA contents were compatible with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) measurement (a correlation coefficient of 0.898 was found between the PSA contents obtained by these two methods). Thus, this immunosensor can be used for routine clinical testing. Yang et al. [55] and Li et al. [56] also determined the selectivity of immunosensors by investigating their responses towards human IgG, BSA, lysozyme, vitamin C and glucose. Both groups tested 1 ng mL \u22121 of PSA solution containing 100 ng mL \u22121 of interfering substances. They showed that the current variation due to interfering substances was less than 8% of the current measured in the absence of the interfering compounds. This indicates the good selectivity of both immunosensors. Based on the analytical performance of the biosensors reported in Table 2 in detecting PSA, Zani et al. [57] obtained the highest LOD (1.4 ng mL \u22121 ). They [57] developed an electrochemical immunosensor based on protein G-coated paramagnetic microparticles modified with antibodies specific to PSA. These microparticles were immobilized on screen-printed graphite 8-sensor arrays as working electrodes, which functioned as multiplexed electrochemical platforms. Recently, Li et al. [60] fabricated an electrochemical immunosensor based on graphene (functionalized with ferrocene-carboxaldehyde composites) and silver-hybridized mesoporous silica nanoparticles immobilized on glass carbon electrodes to detect PSA in serum samples. They obtained a low LOD (0.002 ng mL \u22121 ) possibly because mesoporous silica materials were used, which have large specific surface area, uniform structure and controlled pore size [60] . The immunosensor exhibited good stability (RSD lower than 10% after three weeks of standby) and reproducibility (RSD of 6.4%). This indicates that the structure of the nanocomposites can facilitate the immobilization of biomolecules other than PSA useful in clinical diagnostics [60] . According to the authors, the silver nanoparticles amplified the signal and in turn the sensitivity of electrochemical immunosensors due to their biocompatibility and high electrical conductivity. Li et al. [60] tested five different concentrations of PSA (1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0 and 8.0 ng mL \u22121 ) in human serum samples (without any treatment) via the standard addition method, with recoveries of 97.0-102.5% and RSD below 5.4%. Thus, they showed that this immunosensor can be applied to clinical practice. In addition, the analytical results of the immunosensor were compared with those of a commercial ELISA, and RSDs ranging from \u22124.61% to 4.10% were obtained between the two methodologies. Thus, immunosensors can be considered for clinical application [60] . To determine selectivity, the immunosensor was incubated in 2 ng mL \u22121 of PSA solution containing 200 ng mL \u22121 of interfering substances (hIgG, lysozyme and \u03b1-fetoprotein). The current variation due to interfering substances was less than 5.2% of that without interferences. This indicated that the selectivity of the immunosensor was good [60] .",

            "text": "Interleukins, which belong to the cytokine family, play a key role in the inflammatory response of diseases such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and inflammatory bowel disease, as well as diabetes and Alzheimer's disease [64, 66] . For example, IL-6 is a useful biomarker overexpressed in several types of cancer such as prostate cancer or head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, with the serum concentrations increasing up to the nanogram per millilitre range. The IL-6 level in the serum of healthy individuals is about 6 pg mL \u22121 ( Table 3 ). The traditional analytical techniques used to detect IL-6 include ELISA, fluorescent microarray, chemiluminescence immunoassay, biosensors based on fluorescence and conductimetry [65] . Other current biosensors are based on electrochemistry, as shown in Table 2 . For example, Liu et al. [63] reported an immunosensor based on electrochemical and optical principles, with graphene oxide nanosheets, polyaniline NWs and CdSe quantum dot nanocomposites immobilized on glass carbon electrodes, to detect IL-6 in serum samples. The immunosensor exhibited long-term stability as the analytical response did not change significantly when the sensor was stored for 14 days at 4\u00b0C. An RSD of 7.4% and good reproducibility were reported, because the detection of 10 pg mL \u22121 of IL-6 in five independent sensors provides an RSD of 7.6%. In addition, the analytical results of the immunosensors were compared with those of ELISA methodology, and relative deviations from \u22125.84% to 6.21% were found between the two methodologies, which indicates the applicability of the sensor to the determination of IL-6 levels in human samples [63] . The nanocomposite showed excellent biocompatibility, dispersability and solubility, which can improve the electrochemiluminescence biosensing method used to detect IL-6 in serum samples or other proteins in clinical samples [63] . Liu et al. [63] also demonstrated that the proposed immunosensor has sufficient selectivity for IL-6 detection, which could differentiate IL-6 from its analogues in complex samples. This is confirmed by the acceptable RSD (6.3%) obtained on comparing the response for IL-6 with that for BSA, CEA and hIgG. Recently, Wang et al. [66] , Ojeda et al. [64] and Lou et al. [65] proposed electrochemical biosensors for the detection of IL-6 in serum samples (Table 2) , based on gold nanoparticles/graphene/silica sol-gel, carboxyl-functionalized magnetic microparticles and gold/palladium/silver nanoparticles, respectively. In the first two works, similar LODs were obtained (0.3 and 0.39 pg mL \u22121 ) but with Ojeda et al. [64] obtaining a wider linear range (1.75-500 pg mL \u22121 ) and better sensitivity (336 nA pg \u22121 mL \u22121 , respectively) than Wang et al. [66] , about 1-40 pg mL \u22121 and 20.4 nA pg \u22121 mL \u22121 , respectively. Wang et al. [66] used an indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode, with the gold nanoparticles/graphene/silica solgel film being synthesized in situ. This offered a stable network for the labelling of the gold nanoparticles/polydopamine/CNT composite used to immobilize antibodies specific to IL-6. Polydopamine is a novel, simple, inexpensive, 'green' and stable material, and its association with gold nanoparticles and CNT is promising in clinical diagnosis [66] . In addition, Wang et al. [66] found that the results for their sensor were in line with those for the reference ELISA methodology, as a correlation coefficient of 0.990 was found between the two methodologies, which indicates the applicability of the fabricated immunosensor in bioelectronic systems. The immunosensor was found to have acceptable selectivity as reflected by the variation of 2.2-8.8% in the response of the immunosensor to interfering analytes (\u03b1-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin and PSA) [66] . Ojeda et al. [64] showed that the fabricated exhibits excellent storage stability because of the anti-IL-6-magnetic bead conjugates, which provide amperometric responses with no significant loss for at least 36 days.",

            "text": "In addition, the analytical results obtained with the biosensor were statistically in agreement with those for a commercial ELISA kit, as no significant difference was found between the two methodologies (at \u03b1 = 0.05). Compared to the first two groups, Lou et al. [65] reported a lower LOD (0.059 pg mL \u22121 ) and a wider linear range (0.1-100,000 pg mL \u22121 ) for their electrochemical immunosensor. Lou et al. [65] applied a competitive dual signal amplification strategy by combining the electrically heated carbon electrode technique with gold nanoparticles. According to the authors, the electrically heated carbon electrode technique accelerates the reaction kinetics without changing the bulk solution temperature. Thus, the mass transport is enhanced by changing the temperature of the electrode. In turn, the electrochemical signal is enhanced together with a higher signal-tobackground ratio, which leads to the high analytical performance. With respect to its stability, more than 90% of the initial responses for IL-6 were obtained when the biosensor was stored for 14 days at 4\u00b0C; this is due to the good biocompatibility of retaining the bioactivity of proteins. In addition, the immunosensor was tested to detect IL-6 in serum samples, the results of which were compared with those obtained for the ELISA methodology. An RSD less than 6.3% was reported for eight individual biosensors for 100 pg mL \u22121 of IL-6, suggesting its potential application towards the early evaluation of tumour diseases [65] . The selectivity of the immunosensor was also tested, with no significant differences (RSD from 6.5% to 10.9%) being observed when 10 pg mL \u22121 IL-6 was mixed with 100 pg mL \u22121 of BSA, cTnI, CEA and MMP-2. Thus, these analytes did not interfere notably in the functioning of the immunosensor [65] . Tang et al. [62] proposed another electrochemical immunosensor to detect IL-6 in serum samples. It is based on the microfluidic principle, providing an LOD in the femtogram per millilitre range (10 fg mL \u22121 , that is, 0.01 pg mL \u22121 ) and a linear range of 10-1300 fg mL \u22121 (0.01-1.3 pg mL \u22121 ). Thus, it is an excellent candidate for the detection of other biomarkers for cancer diagnostics. According to Tang et al. [62] , microfluidics offered excellent control of mass transport, enhanced signal-to-noise ratio and increased portability. In addition, the major advantage of microfluidics is the low cost of the sensors, which produces high-quality microchips with a minimal sample volume of 1 \u03bcL required [62] . The schematic representation of the microfluidic chips proposed by Tang et al. [62] is shown in Fig. 2 . According to Tang et al. [62] , the microfluidic array is a very promising cheap, disposable, chip-based diagnostic tool for early cancer detection and monitoring. The very low LOD allows extensive dilution of samples and in turn minimizes the non-specific binding of potentially interfering biomolecules in serum. Thus, these arrays can be used to test for cancer recurrence.",

            "text": "The MMP family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases are essential for the regulated degradation and processing of extracellular matrices, while also facilitating host and tumour communication [67] . For example, MMP-2 is a key MMP in tumour growth, invasion and metastasis, involved in physiological and pathological states including morphogenesis, reproduction and tissue remodelling [67] . MMP-3 can also be used to diagnose and monitor such diseases, as it elevated expression is associated with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and adrenal tumours [61] . In Table 2 , three works on the detection of MMP-2 and MMP-3 with different biosensors are listed. For MMP-2, Yang et al. [67] developed an electrochemical immunosensor based on gold nanoparticles and nitrogen-doped graphene composite immobilized on a glass carbon electrode, whereas Song et al. [68] constructed an optical biosensor based on graphene oxide. According to Song et al. [68] , graphene oxide has been used to develop biosensors based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer, because of its superior fluorescence quenching capacity and unique adsorption characteristics for biomolecules. The LOD (0.11 pg mL \u22121 ) of an electrochemical immunosensor proposed by Yang et al. [67] was superior to the LOD of an optical biosensor (2500 pg mL \u22121 ) obtained by Song et al. [68] . Moreover, the immunosensor showed a wide linear range (0.5-50,000 pg mL \u22121 ) with high selectivity and long-term stability (90% of the initial response persisted after storing the biosensors at 4\u00b0C for week), which can thus be used to satisfactorily detect proteins in clinical laboratories [67] . In addition, the analytical results of the immunosensors were compared with those of an ELISA methodology, which were found to be in agreement, with relative deviations ranging from \u22125.97% to 2.94%. This indicated the applicability of the immunosensor to determining MMP-2 levels in human plasma [67] . The authors also listed the advantages of the composite of gold nanoparticles and nitrogen-doped graphene sheet for biosensing. This composite facilitates robust immobilization of antibodies, promotes electron transfer and exhibits excellent electrochemical activity, thus enhancing the analytical performance of the immunosensor due to the homogeneous dispersion of gold nanoparticles on the nitrogen graphene sheet.",

            "text": "The \u03b1-fetoprotein, an oncofetal glycoprotein, is the most important and widely use liver cancer tumour marker. It is mainly produced by the liver, yolk sac and gastrointestinal tract of a human fetus; its increased levels in adult serum indicate hepatocellular carcinoma or endodermal sinus tumour [71] . Conventional techniques for the detection of \u03b1-fetoprotein include ELISA, electrochemistry, electrochemiluminescence, mass spectrometry, QCM and SPR immunoassays. However, their limitations include relatively sophisticated instrumentation, significant sample volume, limited sensitivity and clinically unrealistic cost and time. Thus, new, simple and inexpensive methods have been proposed for the detection of \u03b1-fetoprotein or other biomarkers in the serum of both healthy and cancer patients [71] . Various electrochemical sensors have been proposed for the detection of \u03b1-fetoprotein in serum samples (Table 2) , which use nanomaterials for signal transduction. Li et al. [71] , Ge et al. [72] , Lai et al. [73] and Gan et al. [70] used CdTe quantum dots, MWCNT/gold nanoparticles, gold/silver nanoparticles and Fe3O4/ ZrO2/nanogold composites, with LODs of 0.00013, 0.00015, 0.0039 and 0.01 ng mL \u22121 , respectively. These different LODs can be attributed to the different transduction principles applied. All sensors are based on the electrochemical principle. However, Li et al. [71] and Gan et al. [70] , respectively, combined the optical mechanism (exciting detection technique using quantum dots as photoactive materials) and magnetic mechanism (preparation of magnetic particles: Fe3O4-ZrO2-Au-polylysine) with electrochemistry. Li et al. [71] reported good long-term stability of two weeks at 4\u00b0C as they found no apparent change in the photocurrent response on detecting 10 ng mL \u22121 of \u03b1-fetoprotein. Their immunosensors were found to be feasible for clinical application with relative deviations ranging from \u22123.6% and 3.0% compared with the ELISA results. Lai et al. [73] reported the same sensor stability (90% of initial response remained after two weeks at 4\u00b0C). Further, when human serum samples were tested for \u03b1-fetoprotein with the immunosensor and with a commercial electrochemiluminescence test, relative errors ranging from \u221210.5% to 8.5% were observed, indicating the good accuracy of the reported biosensor for clinical sample detection. The biosensor developed by Gan et al. [70] was found to be more stable, as no apparent change in response was observed with measurement of \u03b1-fetoprotein every 3-5 days, with RSD of 3.0% for 30 days (at 4\u00b0C). The authors attributed the good stability to the consistency of the Fe3O4-ZrO2-Au-polylysine membrane and the firm attachment of protein molecules to the surface of the glass carbon electrode. The immunosensor can be used to determine \u03b1-fetoprotein levels in human serum, as the average concentration of \u03b1-fetoprotein with the biosensor (4.56 ng mL \u22121 ) was similar to that obtained with ELISA (4.89 ng mL \u22121 ), indicating no significant difference. In addition, Gan et al. [70] verified the good selectivity of their immunosensor for the determination of \u03b1-fetoprotein, as the sensor response for various analytes (100 ng mL \u22121 CEA, 1 \u03bcg mL \u22121 hIgG, 20 ng mL \u22121 carbohydrate antigen 19-9, 20 ng mL \u22121 human chorionic gonadotropin antigen, 2 \u03bcg mL \u22121 BSA, 2 \u03bcg mL \u22121 dopamine, 2 \u03bcg mL \u22121 L-lysine, 2.5 \u03bcg mL \u22121 uric acid, 2.5 \u03bcg mL \u22121 glucose, 5 \u03bcg mL \u22121 ascorbic acid and 5 \u03bcg mL \u22121 Na + ) did not interfere with the determination of 5.0 ng mL \u22121 of \u03b1-fetoprotein (signal dropped below 5%). Recently, Wang et al. [74] proposed an electrochemical immunosensor based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles, which were used as carriers to immobilize secondary antibodies as well as Fe3O4 nanoparticles and the enzyme horseradish peroxidase, both of which were used as signal amplification labels. The mesoporous silica nanoparticles are known to have a large specific surface area and good biocompatibility. Thus, they are promising candidates for use in electrochemical sensors [74] , in addition to their lower cost compared with noble metal nanoparticles (Au, Al or Pt) often used in electrochemical sensors, as shown previously. For the electrochemical immunosensor (0.01-25 ng mL \u22121 ), a good linear relationship was noted between the current change and concentrations of \u03b1-fetoprotein with a low LOD (0.004 ng mL \u22121 ), which suggests the applicability of these immunosensors for the detection of other tumour markers [74] . In addition, compared to the analytical results for an ELISA methodology, the immunosensor showed relative deviations between \u22126.1% and 1.3% for the detection of \u03b1-fetoprotein in serum samples, indicating its suitability in real sample detection.",

            "text": "CEA, a glycoprotein, is the most extensively used tumour marker for clinical diagnosis of lung cancer, ovarian carcinoma, breast cancer and cystadenocarcinoma, with a cut-off value of 5 ng mL \u22121 [78, 80] . The levels of CEA are elevated in the case of inflammation or tumours in any endodermal tissue including the gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, pancreas and breast [106] . Several analytical techniques based on immunoassays have been reported for the determination of CEA, including radioimmunoassays, enzyme immunoassays and fluoroimmunoassays. However, they are limited by radiation hazards, long analysis times or the need for qualified personnel and/or sophisticated instrumentation [107] . As early diagnosis and treatment of cancer are necessary, sensitive, precise and accurate analytical techniques must be developed for determining CEA with low concentration levels in complex biological samples [79] . For example, electrochemical biosensors have several advantages over the previously described molecular detection approaches, including the ability to analyse complicated body fluids, high sensitivity, compatibility with microfabrication technologies, low manpower requirements and compact instrumentation that is compatible with portable devices [107] . In Table 2 , various electrochemical biosensors detecting CEA in serum samples are listed, with differing values of figures of merit such as linearity and sensitivity. For example, Han et al. [76] , Kong et al. [77] and Lai et al. [73] fabricated electrochemical immunosensors for CEA based on different transduction materials. Han et al. [76] fabricated an electrochemical immunosensor based on chitosan-ferrocene, nano-TiO2 film and gold nanoparticle-graphene nanohybrid. Kong et al. [77] proposed an electrochemical immunosensor based on gold nanoparticlethionine-reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite films. Lai et al. [76] fabricated an electrochemical immunosensor based on gold and silver nanoparticles. Han et al. [76] and Kong et al. [77] obtained similar LODs (0.0034-0.004 ng mL \u22121 ) but different sensitivities (4.2 and 0.53 \u03bcA ng \u22121 mL \u22122 , respectively) and linearity (0.01-80 ng mL \u22121 and 0.01-0.5 ng mL \u22121 , respectively), as shown in Table 2 . Han et al. [76] used their biosensor to test real serum samples, with ELISA as the reference method. They found good agreement between both analytical methodologies, as the relative deviations of the biosensor results ranged from \u22128.31% to 7.58%. Kong et al. [77] performed recovery experiments via a standard addition method (CEA concentrations from 40 to 200 pg mL \u22121 ) in human serum, which was then analysed with the proposed immunosensor. They achieved recovery in the range of 92.5-113.0%, thus indicating the feasibility of this immunosensor in determining CEA in human serum for routine clinical diagnosis. Wang et al. [79] developed a simple label-free electrochemical immunosensor based on Nafion membrane containing SiO2 nanoparticles immobilized on glass carbon electrodes for the detection of CEA in serum samples. Wang et al. [79] obtained an excellent LOD in the femtomolar range (1 fg mL \u22121 , that is, 0.000001 ng mL \u22121 ) with their immunosensor, with a linear response from 0.000001 to 0.1 ng mL \u22121 . In addition, the analytical results obtained with their immunosensor for detecting CEA in human serum samples are consistent with the data of a microparticle enzyme immunoassay, with relative errors of \u22128% to 5% [79] . The specificity of the immunosensor was also determined by mixing 1 ng mL \u22121 of CEA with 1 ng mL \u22121 of glucose, uric acid, \u03b1-fetoprotein, BSA, hIgG and ascorbic acid [79] . Wang et al. [79] verified that the variation in analytical response obtained from interference substances was less than 7.6% compared with that of pure CEA, indicating the good selectivity of the immunosensor. Recently, Lin et al. [80] and Sun et al. [81] constructed electrochemical immunosensors for the detection of CEA in serum samples based on the transduction principle. They used nanogold-functionalized mesoporous carbon foam (immobilized on glass carbon electrodes) and gold-silver bimetallic nanoparticles (immobilized on paper working electrodes), respectively, to immobilize the antibodies specific to CEA. As shown in Table 2 , the LOD obtained in these two studies, together with that of Wang et al. [79] , were the lowest compared to other works reporting the detection of CEA with electrochemical immunosensors. Lin et al. [80] proposed a method to amplify the immunosensor signal by incorporating a commercial silver enhancer solution, which is a mixture of silver and colloidal gold. According to the authors, this new amplification strategy is a very promising ultrasensitive electrochemical biosensing method, as reflected in the LOD. Lin et al. [80] obtained a better LOD (0.000024 ng mL \u22121 ) than Sun et al. [81] did (0.0003 ng mL \u22121 ), probably due to the signal transduction, which was amplified in the study by Lin et al. [80] , thus enhancing the stability of metal particles. In both studies, the results obtained with fabricated biosensors for the detection of CEA in real human serum samples were compared with reference methodologies, that is, commercial electrochemiluminescence tests. They were found to be in good agreement, with relative errors less than 11.9% and less than 3.2% obtained by Lin et al. [80] and Sun et al. [81] , respectively.",

[72] reported multiplexed electrochemical immunosensors based on MWCNTs, functionalized on a microfluidic paper-based analytical device (\u03bcPAD) denoted as wax-patterned microfluidic paper-based three-dimensional electrochemical devices (3D-\u03bcPED) and on MWCNT/gold nanoparticles (functionalized on an electrode array-based paper), respectively, with the ability to simultaneously detect more than one cancer biomarker in serum samples. Wang et al. [78] reported a simple, sensitive, lowcost, disposable and portable biosensor for the detection of CEA and CA 125, and Ge et al. [72] proposed a multi-analyte biosensor for the simultaneous detection of four cancer biomarkers (\u03b1-fetoprotein, CEA, CA 125 and CA 153) using electrode arrays with high throughput, low cost, small consumption, simple operation and high sensitivity.

For both works, the calibration plots obtained for CA 125 and CEA showed a good linear relationship between the analytical response (peak currents) and the logarithm values of CA 125 and CEA concentration, with correlation coefficients of 0.9968 and 0.9964, respectively, as reported by Wang et al. [78] , and correlation coefficients of 0.9965 and 0.9954, respectively, for CA 125 and CEA, as reported by Ge et al. [72] (Table 2) . For both CEA and CA 125, Ge et al. [72] obtained a better LOD (0.00002 ng mL \u22121 and 0.000037 U mL \u22121 , respectively) than Wang et al. did [78] (0.01 ng mL \u22121 and 0.2 U mL \u22121 , respectively). However, both biosensors exhibited linear ranges covering most levels in human serum (Table 2) . MWCNTs exhibit high chemical stability, good electrical conductivity and strong adsorptive ability. Moreover, their high surface area provides a large loading capacity for nanoparticles, thus improving catalytic activity when metal nanoparticles are supported on MWCNTs [108] . This effect was demonstrated in the biosensor fabricated by Ge et al. [72] , with the MWCNTs acting as heterogeneous catalyst supports for gold nanoparticles. Wang et al. [78] and Ge et al. [72] developed sensors to detect CA 125 and CEA in human serum samples. The analytical results were compared with those of a reference methodology (commercial electrochemiluminescence method). Wang et al. [78] obtained relative errors between the sensor and the reference method below 5.8% for CA 125 and below 6.5% for CEA. Ge et al. [72] obtained RSDs between 2.5% and 5.9% for CA 125 and between 1.4% and 6.3% for CEA, which were in good agreement between the two methodologies and for both works.",

            "text": "In Table 2 , some recent works reporting biosensors for the detection of CRP, cardiac troponins, NT-proBNP and myoglobin in serum samples are listed. Most of these studies reported using nanomaterials or a combination of nanomaterials and composites, mainly due to their large surface area and good biocompatibility, which enhanced the analytical performance of these biosensors [87] . For example, Ibupoto et al. [84] , Zhou et al. [87] and Justino et al. [88] ZnO nanotubes, Fe3O4-SiO2 magnetic nanoprobes and SWCNTs as labels to immobilize antibodies in immunosensors for CRP detection. At levels exceeding 3 mg L \u22121 , CRP, an acute-phase protein, is used to evaluate the risk of developing CVDs such as atherosclerosis, angina, coronary heart disease, peripheral artery disease, myocardial infarction and stroke. It can also be used as a reliable marker for tissue injury, infection and inflammation [82] . Ibupoto et al. [84] , Zhou et al. [87] and Justino et al. [88] reported low LODs, that is, 0.001, 0.0003 and 0.1 ng mL \u22121 , respectively, which were lower than those obtained with traditional immunoassays (30-200 ng mL \u22121 ) [84, 110] . All studies reported enhanced analytical performance with the immunosensors. The time response of the electrochemical immunosensor fabricated by Ibupoto et al. [84] was less than 10 seconds, which detected CRP with good reproducibility (RSD less than 5%) and stability (3 days). However, the immunosensor was not tested in real samples, which limits further clinical application. Ibupoto et al. [84] tested the proposed sensor in a solution with common interferents (glucose, urea, uric acid as well as sodium, potassium and iron ions) and observed a negligible response. Both the piezoelectric immunosensor and electrochemical immunosensor reported by Zhou et al. [87] and Justino et al. [88] , respectively, were validated for the detection of CRP in serum and saliva samples. Zhou et al. [87] obtained good recoveries (87-107%) for the detection of CRP in various serum samples for the immunosensors and the classical ELISA methodology, as well as good reproducibility (CV of 2.4%) and repeatability (CV of 3.4%). Piezoelectric immunosensors offer major advantages such as allowing surface regeneration and repeated use (stability of analytical response of two weeks). Thus, they constitute a versatile analytical tool for the detection of CRP or other cardiac biomarkers. Justino et al. [88] list the advantages of electrochemical immunosensors as point-of-care devices for assessing CVD risk: these immunosensors are disposable, label-free, low cost and easy to analyse. The immunosensors were validated by analysing serum and saliva samples with the ELISA methodology, which showed comparable analytical performance. Linear correlations were found between the immunosensor and ELISA when applied to serum (r 2 = 0.9904) and saliva (r 2 = 0.9991) samples. Thus, the noninvasive sampling methodology reported by Zhou et al. [87] and Justino et al. [88] to detect CRP can be used to diagnose and monitor CVD. Recently, the group of Esteban-Fern\u00e1ndez de \u00c1vila [85, 89] proposed two amperometric magnetoimmunosensors for the detection of CRP, both using carboxylic acid-modified magnetic beads as labels for the immobilization of antibodies. The first biosensor [85] was composed of disposable gold screen-printed electrodes to detect CRP in serum samples, whereas the second biosensor [89] comprised screen-printed carbon electrodes for the multiplexed detection of CRP and NT-proBNP, which is another cardiac biomarker ( Table 2) . According to Esteban-Fern\u00e1ndez de \u00c1vila et al. [85] , magnetic beads have been useful used to construct electrochemical immunosensors to enhance their sensitivity, reduce the time of analysis and minimize matrix effects. Comparable sensitivity (0.203-0.386 \u03bcA ng \u22121 mL \u22122 ) and reproducibility (RSD of 6.3-6.5%) were found with the CRP immunosensors but with LOD of different orders of magnitude: 0.021 ng mL \u22121 reported by Esteban-Fern\u00e1ndez de \u00c1vila et al. [85] and 0.47 ng mL \u22121 for the multiplexed immunosensor proposed by Esteban-Fern\u00e1ndez de \u00c1vila et al. [89] . Esteban-Fern\u00e1ndez de \u00c1vila et al. [85] stated that the low LODs were of practical advantage in the case of strong matrix effects for real clinical samples, which necessitates sample dilution prior to the analysis. Both immunosensors were successfully applied to spiked serum samples, which demonstrate the applicability of such sensing platforms for the clinical diagnosis of CRP. With the same multiplexed immunosensor, but for the detection of NT-proBNP, Esteban-Fern\u00e1ndez de \u00c1vila et al. [89] obtained a similar LOD to that for detecting CRP, but with lower reproducibility (9.4%). According to Esteban-Fern\u00e1ndez de \u00c1vila et al. [89] , the low cost, ease of automation and miniaturization of multiplexed immunosensors, as well as the use of disposable massproduced electrodes, make this approach a promising alternative tool for developing point-of-care devices for in situ clinical diagnosis. Another biomarker for predicting cardiac risk is NT-proBNP, with a key role in the natriuretic, diuretic and vasodilatory systems, as well as in the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the sympathetic nervous system [91] . Zhuo et al. [90] and Yi et al. [91] also reported electrochemical immunosensors for the detection of NT-proBNP based on gold-MWCNT composites and avidin-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles, respectively ( Table 2) . Zhuo et al. [90] reported a better LOD (0.006 ng mL \u22121 ) and a wide linear range (0.02-100 ng mL \u22121 ) than Yi et al. [91] did, reporting an LOD of 30 pg mL \u22121 and a linear range of 0.04-2.5 ng mL \u22121 . The main advantage of the immunosensor proposed by Yi et al. [91] is the simple regeneration procedure, which includes washing the magnet with the buffer to remove the avidin-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles, antigen and antibodies.",

            "text": "Troponins are the most specific and sensitive biomarkers of myocardial cell injury. They, they have been used to test for acute myocardial infarction [96] . Troponins such as cTnT and cTnI can control the calcium-mediated interactions between actin and myosin in cardiac and skeletal muscles; cTnT is expressed in skeletal muscle to a lesser extent, whereas cTnI has not been identified outside of the myocardium [99] . Increased levels of cTnT (higher than 0.3 ng mL \u22121 ) are highly specific to cardiac injury and are significantly associated with an increased risk of re-infarction and death, which facilities early diagnosis [93] . As shown in Table 2 , Fonseca et al. [93] , Gomes-Filho et al. [94] , Silva et al. [95] and Mattos et al. [96] developed immunosensors based on gold nanoparticles, carboxylated CNTs, amine-functionalized CNTs and o-aminobenzoic films, respectively, for immobilizing antibodies specific to cTnT, with an LOD ranging from 0.0015 to 0.033 ng mL \u22121 . All immunosensors were used for serum samples with high sensitivity. They can be used for point-of-care diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. For example, Gomes-Filho et al. [94] and Silva et al. [95] compared the cTnT concentrations obtained with both immunosensors in human serum samples to the levels obtained with electrochemiluminescence immunoassays. They [94, 95] obtained correlation coefficients of 0.987 and 0.990 between the two methods (p < 0.0001), respectively. Recently, Singal et al. [99] and Cho et al. [100] reported electrochemical and optical immunosensors, respectively, for the detection of cTnI. The electrochemical immunosensor (based on impedance) was prepared with functionalized platinum nanoparticles immobilized on a graphene monolayer deposited on a glass carbon electrode, obtaining an LOD of 0.0042 ng mL \u22121 with reproducible results (RSD of 4-11%) and a linear range of 0.01-10 ng mL \u22121 [99] . Singal et al. [99] combined a graphene monolayer composite with functionalized platinum nanoparticles, which enhanced biomolecular immobilization. Graphene is an ideal transducer material due to its large surface area, high heterogeneous electron transfer rates, high intrinsic mobility and good electrical and thermal conductivity; the functionalized platinum nanoparticles have a large specific surface area, excellent biocompatibility, strong adsorption ability and good conductivity. In addition, Singal et al. [99] reported the good shelf-life stability of their immunosensor, as 96% of its initial sensitivity was retained (for 1.0 ng mL \u22121 of cTnI) after 30 days of storage at 4\u00b0C. The optical immunosensor (based on fluorescence) was composed of a membrane strip installed within a cartridge to simultaneously detect cTnI and myoglobin, two biomarkers of acute myocardial infarction [100] . For cTnI, an LOD of 0.05 ng mL \u22121 was obtained with reproducible results (RSD of 7.5%) and a linear range of 0-50 ng mL \u22121 . Both cTnI biosensors can be used in clinical diagnostics considering a cut-off concentration of cTnI in the blood of 0.01-0.1 ng mL \u22121 . A concentration ranging between 0.1 and 2 ng mL \u22121 indicates unstable angina and other heart disorders, and a concentration greater than 2 ng mL \u22121 indicates significant myocardial injury and an increased risk of adverse cardiac events in future [99] .",

Its normal level in the blood (50-100 ng mL \u22121 ) increases about 10-500 times in acute myocardial infarction [100] . With an optical immunosensor, Cho et al. [100] obtained reproducible results (RSD of 2.3%) and a linear range of 2.0-100 ng mL \u22121 . Four different potentially interfering substances (40 mg dL \u22121 bilirubin, 2000 mg dL \u22121 triglycerides, 2000 mg dL \u22121 haemoglobin and 100 mg dL \u22121 ascorbic acid) were also investigated for their effect on the immunoassay. Their presence did significantly alter (\u00b15% variation) the result, compared with the negative control, except for the presence of bilirubin [100] . Zapp et al. [102] and Kim et al. [103] also recently developed immunosensors for myoglobin detection, as shown in Table 2 , based on electrochemical and optical transduction principles, respectively. The electrochemical immunosensor offers a lower LOD (6.29 ng mL \u22121 ) but a more narrow linear range (9.96-72.8 ng mL \u22121 ) than those optical immunosensors (31.0 ng mL \u22121 and 100-1000 ng mL \u22121 , respectively). The immunosensor fabricated by Zapp et al. [102] is limited by the lack of validity in real samples; only simulated serum samples with myoglobin were used. Kim et al. [103] proposed an optical immunosensor based on SPR, which functions continuously in real time, reproducibly. They found acceptable variations in myoglobin levels over 8 hours with periodic one-point calibration every 3 hours (average CV of 4.91%), when tested in real serum samples. Thus, Kim et al. [103] recommended using the immunosensor along with real-time electrocardiographic measurement, for significantly more sensitive diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction diagnosis, thereby facilitating treatment at an early stage [103] . Table 4 includes the figures of merit for current sensors and biosensors (studies published between 2011 and 2015) to compare their analytical performance in detecting 1) hormones such as cortisol; 2) biomolecules such as glucose and cholesterol; and 3) neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine.

Abnormal cortisol levels are good indicators of chronic conditions such as Cushing's syndrome (symptoms of obesity, fatigue and bone fragility) at excess levels, or Addison's disease (manifested by weight loss, fatigue and darkening of skin folds and scars) at low levels [112, 136] . The detection of cortisol is mostly limited to laboratory techniques such as chromatography, ELISA, SPR and QCM. These are limited by the long duration from sampling to results (from days to a few weeks), complex sample preparation and expensive diagnosis [111, 112] . Thus, point-of-care technologies have been used to detect cortisol in relevant biological fluids such as saliva rapidly and selectively. The amount of free cortisol present in the saliva was significantly correlated with the total cortisol in the blood (r = 0.60; p < 0.001), with the normal levels of cortisol in serum ranging from 100 to 500 nM [131] . Recently, Pasha et al. [111] and Vabbina et al. [112] proposed electrochemical immunosensors based on cyclic voltammetry for the detection of cortisol in saliva samples (Table 4) , the results of which were validated with ELISA methodology. Pasha et al. [111] constructed a simple, low-cost and label-free immunosensor based on interdigitated microelectrodes (IDEs), and Vabbina et al. [112] proposed a label-free, sensitive and selective immunosensor with nanomaterials (zinc oxide 1D nanorods and 2D nanoflakes) for the immobilization of cortisol antibodies. Both schematic representations of the immunosensing principle are shown in Fig. 4 .",

            "text": "Oestradiol or 17\u03b2-oestradiol, a natural steroid oestrogen, is also known to be endocrine disrupting, with an impact on reproductive and sexual functioning. Thus, quantifying their serum levels (normal levels are about 200-600 pg mL \u22121 ) is crucial to various clinical evaluations for fertility treatments, postmenopausal status, hyperandrogenism and breast cancer [113, 114] . Analytical techniques such as gas chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or electrochemical methods involving voltammetry and chronoamperometry have been used to determine oestradiol levels in biological, pharmaceutical and water samples. However, these techniques are labour and time intensive, requiring expensive equipment [113] [114] [115] . Thus, biosensors for oestradiol detection have been considered in the clinical field, due to their high selectivity and sensitivity. For example, Hao et al. [113] developed a sensor to detect oestradiol based on MWCNT and gold nanoparticles immobilized on a graphite electrode via a layerby-layer assembling technique. The sensor was tested in serum samples from pregnant women using the standard addition method. The oestradiol content was determined, with good recoveries (98.5-103.5%) being reported, which indicates the applicability of this sensor in determining oestradiol in real samples. Ojeda et al. [114] proposed a disposable electrochemical immunosensor based on graphed p-aminobenzoic acid immobilized on screen-printed carbon electrodes to detect oestradiol. A low LOD (0.77 pg mL \u22121 ) and a wide linear range (1.0-250 pg mL \u22121 ) were obtained. The immunosensor was also used to analyse certified serum and spiked urine samples, with mean recoveries of 96-102% for serum samples and 95-100% for urine samples. Recently, Wang et al. [115] proposed an electrochemical sensor for oestradiol using nanoporous polymeric films on glass carbon electrodes, and good recoveries (99-103%) were reported when the sensor was applied to human urine samples, which demonstrates the applicability of the sensor to real samples. Wang et al. [115] also studied the selectivity of the sensor by measuring the current responses of some potential interfering substances such as L-cysteine, L-lysine and ascorbic acid (1.0 \u00d7 10 \u22124 mol L \u22121 ), as well as uric acid and tryptophan (5.0 \u00d7 10 \u22125 mol L \u22121 ). They found no interference (standard deviation lower than 5.0%) in the determination of 1.0 \u00d7 10 \u22126 mol L \u22121 of oestradiol, which indicates good selectivity for oestradiol determination.",

The sensors recently proposed for their detection are listed in Table 4 , which mainly used nanoparticles (CuO, Fe2O3 or ZnO) to enhance the analytical response. For example, Dung et al. [118] , Yang et al. [119] and Zhang et al. [121] (interdigitated microelectrodes) 10-100,000 pg mL \u22121 10 pg mL \u22121 6 \u03bcA pg \u22121 mL \u22122 r = 0.99 [111] Cortisol used CuO-SWCNT nanocomposites, carboxyl-modified graphene oxide/magnetic nanoparticles and CuO nanoparticles/carbon spheres, respectively, for the detection of glucose with electrochemical sensors. Dung et al. [118] and Zhang et al. [121] reported the best sensitivities (2981 and 1610 \u03bcA mM \u22121 cm \u22122 , respectively) and wider linear ranges (0.05-1800 \u03bcM and 0.5-2300 \u03bcM, respectively) using non-enzymatic sensors, compared with the enzymaticbased sensor proposed by Yang et al. [119] , with a sensitivity of 1074.6 \u03bcA mM \u22121 cm \u22122 and a linear range of 100-1400 \u03bcM (Table 4) . Non-enzymatic sensors are preferred over sensors fabricated with enzymes, as the analytical applications of the former are limited by the high cost associated with enzyme isolation and purification and chemical and thermal deformation of enzymes. The nonenzymatic glucose sensors are based on direct oxidation of glucose at the electrode surface, with nanostructured metals (for example, Pt, Au, Ni or Cu) and metal oxides (for example, CuO or NiO) being used to enhance catalytic performance [116, 121] . In addition, the analytical performance of such systems was also enhanced by the synergic interaction between various nanostructures used in the transduction mechanism . For example, Zhang et al. [121] reported the best sensitivity and wider linear range for the use of CuO nanoparticles attached to carbon spheres and immobilized on the glass carbon electrode, with no need for pre-surface modification. CuO nanoparticles have high specific surface area and good electrochemical activity, and they can promote electron transfer reactions at lower over-potential. Carbon spheres have an increasing electrochemical potential due to such physical properties as homogeneity of particle size, high specific surface area and conductivities [121] . The sensor was also highly selective for glucose in the presence of commonly interfering species such as ascorbic acid, dopamine, uric acid and chloride ion. It was successfully used to monitor the concentration of glucose in human serum samples [121] .",

[124] used CuO nanoparticles, Fe2O3 nanoparticles and ZnO nanotubes, respectively, for sensors based on the transduction principle to detect cholesterol in serum samples. Ahmad et al. [124] obtained a lower LOD (0.0005 \u03bcM) for a high-performance cholesterol biosensor using ZnO grown on Si/Ag electrodes. The electrode displayed a response within 2 seconds with different concentrations of cholesterol (from 1.0 to 13,000 \u03bcM), as shown in Fig. 5i , which indicates the good catalytic property of the electrode [124] . In addition, the biosensor showed high stability for cholesterol detection, retaining about 93% of its original response to cholesterol after 60 days of storage. This stability can be attributed to the electron transfer between ZnO nanotubes and the electrode, the higher specific surface area of ZnO nanotubes and their ability to maintain the bioactivity of cholesterol oxidase, as stated by Ahmad et al. [124] . Based on the interference test, Ahmad et al. [124] found that the interfering species (glucose, ascorbic acid, L-cysteine and uric acid) did not affect the biosensor response visibly, which indicates that the fabricated biosensor is selective to cholesterol in the presence of various interfering species.",

Two sensors with different transduction principles are reported in Table 4 . Rahman [125] fabricated an electrochemical sensor as a smart chip based on the enzymatic principle, with acetylcholine oxidase being immobilized on the electrode surface via peptide conjugation by amide bond formation. Conversely, Zhang et al. [126] developed an electrochemical sensor based on MWCNTs and ZnO nanoparticles for the detection of acetylcholine and choline, which is an enzymatic product of the oxidation of acetylcholine. Monitoring the levels of acetylcholine and choline is crucial for diagnosing neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and neuromuscular diseases, myasthenia gravis and impaired cholinergic neurotransmission [127] . As shown in Table 4 , the smart chip showed lower LOD and higher sensitivity, as the enzymes were immobilized onto the active sensitive surface via a simple and efficient approach, thus enhancing the sensor sensitivity to a large group of biomolecules. Thus, as stated by Rahman [125] , the smart chip has a wide range of biomedical applications. In addition, the smart chip, fabricated by conventional photolithographic techniques, has other advantages such as its high sensitivity, small sample volume (70 \u03bcL), stability (1 month) and reproducibility (RSD of 1.8%). The main advantage of the electrochemical sensor proposed by Zhang et al. [126] is its long-term storage of 90 days. The unique multilayer structure (MWCNT-ZnO nanoparticles) provides a favourable microenvironment to maintain the bioactivity of choline oxidase and acetylcholinesterase. Zhang et al. [126] tested the sensor and an HPLC-mass spectrometry (MS)/MS technique for the detection of choline in human plasma samples. They obtained consistent analytical results: a mean concentration of total choline of 2.67 \u00b1 0.21 mM in human plasma was obtained with the sensor and 2.54 \u00b1 0.12 mM with the HPLC-MS/MS technique.",

            "text": "Epinephrine, also known as adrenaline, is one of the most important neurotransmitters in the central nervous system of mammals. It is present in the nervous tissue and body fluids in the form of large organic cations [128] . Determining the levels of neurotransmitters such as epinephrine, dopamine and norepinephrine in biological fluids is crucial for clinical analysis, as they are diagnostic biomarkers for a variety of metabolic and neurological disorders. For example, increased levels in urine have been used as a tumour marker for neuroblastoma and phaeochromocytoma, as well as increased stress [129] . Akyilmaz et al. [128] constructed a unique electrochemical biosensor based on fungal cells (from Phanerochaete chrysosporium) for the voltammetric determination of epinephrine (Table 4 ). In this biosensor, the fungal biomass was lyophilized and immobilized in gelatine on a platinum working electrode. Then, the immobilized cells were used as a source of laccase to develop the epinephrine biosensor; the current increases due to the redox activity of laccase in the biosensor, which released an epinephrinequinone [128] . According to the authors, the proposed biosensor has several advantages such as low cost and simplicity of construction compared with biosensors based on isolated enzymes. Other sensors for the detection of epinephrine as well as other neurotransmitters such as dopamine and norepinephrine in urine samples are listed in Table 4 , which use optical fibres with an alginate/laccase matrix [129] or fluorescence [130] . The three neurotransmitters (dopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine) were tested in the sensors constructed by Silva et al. [129] and Silva et al. [130] . A better LOD (0.00059-0.00088 ng mL \u22121 ) was reported for the fluorescence sensor compared with the optical fibre sensor based on the alginate/laccase matrix, with an LOD of 4.1-5.5 ng mL \u22121 . When testing for dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine, figures of merit such as LOD (0.00059-0.00088 ng mL \u22121 ) and the linear range (between [124] , with permission from Elsevier). FESEM images of as-synthesized \u03b1-Fe2O3 micro-pine-shaped hierarchical structures at iii) low magnification, iv) and v) high resolution (Reprinted from Umar et al. [123] , with permission from Elsevier). 0.001 and 0.3 ng mL \u22121 ) of the fluorescence optical fibre sensor were found to be superior to those of an HPLC-electrochemical detector (HPLC-ED) (0.0045-0.0051 ng mL \u22121 for the LOD and linear range between 0.005 and 0.125 ng mL \u22121 ). Thus, Silva et al. [130] suggested the fluorescence sensor as a promising alternative to the current methodologies to determine catecholamines in clinical samples, due to its compact design, low-scale instrumentation and effective cost of analysis. Table 6 includes the figures of merit of current sensors and biosensors (studies published between 2011 and 2015) to compare their analytical performance in the detection of 1) pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli, 2) viruses such as hepatitis C virus core antigen and avian influenza virus and 3) cancer cells.",

Thus, these methods are not practical for pointof-care diagnostics. For example, Yang et al. [137] and Safavieh et al. [138] proposed two electrochemical immunosensors based on microfluidics for the detection of E. coli in urine samples ( Table 6) . Detection of E. coli in human urine is used to diagnose urinary tract infections commonly related to the kidney, as it is known to cause up to 80% of such infections and is present at concentrations \u226510 5 CFU mL \u22121 [137] . Microfluidics reduces the consumption of costly reagents, as small volumes of liquid are manipulated in closed microscale channels. This increases the surface-to-volume ratio and Human liver cancer cells",

            "text": "enhances the ongoing reactions, thus leading to miniaturized biosensors with various applications [138] . The biosensor fabricated by Yang et al. [137] is considered as a lab on a chip, consisting of two chambers (for concentration and sensing) connected in series and an integrated impedance detector. These two chambers help reduce the non-specific absorption of proteins such as albumin, which coexists with E. coli in urine, thereby improving the sensitivity. In the concentration chamber, the bacteria are separated from the urine sample by the conjugation of microsized magnetic beads to E. coli antibodies. The immobilized E. coli is then transferred to the sensing chamber to measure impedance and in turn estimate the E. coli concentration [137] . With this portable biosensor, an LOD of 3.4 \u00d7 10 4 CFU mL \u22121 was obtained, which is lower that the threshold of urinary tract infections (10 5 CFU mL \u22121 ). The LOD obtained with the microfluidic biosensor proposed by Safavieh et al. [138] was greater (24 CFU mL \u22121 ) than that obtained by Yang et al. [137] . Safavieh et al. [138] developed a biosensor employing loop-mediated isothermal amplification, which played a key role in quantifying the bacteria. Isothermal amplification techniques can amplify the target nucleic acids at constant temperature. For example, loop-mediated isothermal amplification is accurate, rapid and cost-effective with high sensitivity and specificity, amplifying a few copies of DNA to 10 9 copies in less than an hour at 60-66\u00b0C [138] . Recently, Barreiros dos Santos et al. [139] reported the construction of a label-free immunosensor based on epoxysilane, with an LOD of 1 CFU mL \u22121 , lower than those reported previously. The biosensor was composed of ITO electrodes, with the antibodies specific to E. coli being immobilized via covalent attachment to epoxysilane. The authors attributed the low LOD to the robust surface functionalization, which was based on the immobilization of biomolecules via silane monolayers using trifunctional silanes. The immunosensor also showed good reproducibility (RSD of 3%) and good stability (48 hours at 4\u00b0C). Barreiros dos Santos et al. [139] also tested a traditional technique (ELISA) for the detection of E. coli in urine samples in order to compare the analytical results. However, they obtained a higher LOD (10 4 CFU mL \u22121 ). The same research group [151] previously developed another immunosensor for the detection of E. coli but using gold substrates rather than ITO electrodes. They showed that despite the similar LODs (2 CFU mL \u22121 ), the ITO required lesser experimental time. Moreover, the immobilization of antibodies onto ITO required 4 hours, whereas functionalization of the gold electrode was an overnight process.",

The SEM image in Fig. 6ii(a) displays zirconiachitosan nanoparticles with smooth morphology and a diameter of about 100 nm, as indicated by the solid arrow. The SEM image in Fig. 6ii(b) displays the morphologies of nanocomposites with immobilized hepatitis C virus core antibodies, which were greater in size than zirconia nanoparticles alone (Fig. 6ii(a) ). In addition, the immunosensor exhibited high reproducibility (RSD of 4.2%) and high stability, as the immunosensor could retain about 98.5% of the initial current response after a storage period of 30 days at 4\u00b0C, due to the good biocompatibility of gold-zirconia-chitosan nanocomposites with the immobilized antibodies [141] . The immunosensor was tested in six serum samples, the results of which were compared to those of a traditional ELISA technique. The concentrations of hepatitis C virus core antigen were similar, with relative deviations of the proposed immunosensor in the range of \u22124.35% to 6.65%. Thus, this immunosensor can be an alternative tool for the clinical detection of hepatitis C virus core antigen in human serum samples.

In Fig. 6iv (a) and 6iv(b), uniformly distributed, aligned and aggregation-free SWCNTs are observed after the PDDA assembly. The majority of the individual SWCNTs were reasonably aligned parallel to the electrodes, and the deposited SWCNTs were reproducible due to the PDDA monolayer (Fig. 6iv(c) ). Furthermore, avidin and biotinylated antibodies were successfully immobilized onto the SWCNT surfaces, as reflected by the uniform morphology in Fig. 6iv(d) . Fig. 6iv (e) displays a single influenza virus captured by the antibodies distributed on the SWCNTs with several virus aggregates [143] .

In its severe forms (haemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome), it may progress to multisystem involvement and death, mostly in children [145] . Kumbhat et al. [153] called for a timely diagnosis of dengue virus in vectors and humans with real-time biosensors to prevent its spread, in addition to the current gold-standard serological tests such as ELISA and immunofluorescence assays to detect specific antibody and viral antigen Dias et al. [145] proposed an amperometric immunosensor for the detection of the non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of the dengue virus, using carboxylated MWCNTs on screenprinted electrodes with antibodies being covalently linked to this transducing platform (Table 6 ). In primary infections, the NS1 levels range from 0.04 to 2 \u03bcg mL \u22121 in serum samples of patients in the acute disease phase (up to 7 days) [145] . According to the authors, the proposed imunosensor is a point-of-care approach that diagnoses the early clinical phase of dengue infection. This conclusion was based on successful analytical results with spiked blood serum samples, considered the excellent recovery values (98-116%), excellent LOD (12 ng mL \u22121 ) and sensitivity of 85.59 \u03bcA mM \u22121 cm \u22122 [145] .",

            "text": "Cytosensors have been recently developed for the detection of cancer cells, as they require simple instrumentation and reduce the cost and time required for analysis [147] . For example, Zheng et al. [146] developed a robust electrochemical cytosensing approach for both the selective detection of leukaemia cells with LODs as low as 40 cells and the quantitative evaluation of the DR4/DR5 expression status on leukaemia cell surfaces. The expression of DR4 and DR5, which are death receptors, can be quantified on leukaemia cell surfaces as important diagnostic tools to guide death receptor-based leukaemia treatment [146] . Electrochemical cytosensors can comprise the following: a) multifunctional hybrid nanoprobes used for cytosensing, which are based on horseradish peroxidase and Au nanoparticle-decorated magnetic Fe3O4 beads, for the specific recognition of DR4/DR5 on leukaemia cell surfaces, and b) nanoarchitectured electrode interfaces, which specifically target the analytes and facilitate significant electron transfer between the analytes and electrodes [146] . According to the authors, the multifunctional hybrid nanoprobes and the nano-architectured electrode interface amplify the signal, in turn lowering the LOD. In addition, the electrochemical cytosensing platform is considered to be of great clinical value for the early diagnosis of human leukaemia and the evaluation of the effects of radiation or drug therapy on leukaemia patients [146] . Liu et al. [147] constructed a label-free electrochemical cytosensor with surface-confined ferrocene as the signal indicator and SWCNTs for the selective detection of human cervical carcinoma cells. This cytosensor has a wide detection range ranging from 10 to 10 6 cells mL \u22121 with an LOD as low as 10 cells mL \u22121 , which was reached even in the presence of a large amount of noncancerous cells. The poly(ethylyimine) functionalized with ferrocene was used as the signal indicator and assembled on the electrode surface, thus providing an amplified signal to improve the detection sensitivity [147] . Recently, Mir et al. [148] constructed a nanobiosensor for the selective detection of human non-small-cell lung cancer cells using hydrazine and aptamers attached on gold nanoparticles to amplify the signal. Sensitive and accurate early diagnosis of lung cancer is necessary for its prevention, assessment of therapeutic efficacy and detection of minimal residual disease. This is because if the associated cancerous cells are recognized in the early stages of lung cancer, the treatment and five-year survival rates exceed 60% [148] . In the cytosensor proposed by Mir et al. [148] , the lung cancer cells were recognized by the strong interaction between their glycoproteins on the cell membrane surface and specific aptamers, with an excellent dynamic range from 15 to 1 \u00d7 10 6 cells mL \u22121 and an LOD of 8 cells mL \u22121 . According to the authors, the proposed cytosensor is a simple, low-cost and biocompatible strategy for the sensitive analysis of non-small-cell lung cancer, which can also be used to differentiate between cancerous and noncancerous cells, and to facilitate early clinical diagnosis and treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer and related diseases. The same research group detected human liver hepatocellular carcinoma cells using cytosensors but with two types of sensing principles. Sun et al. [149] proposed an electrochemical cytosensor based on aptamers covalently attached to a gold electrode to capture the cancerous cells using horseradish peroxidase and gold nanoparticles in the sensing probe. Alternatively, Sun et al. [150] proposed an electrochemical cytosensor based on aptamers but attached on a glassy carbon electrode with gold nanoparticles. Both electrochemical cytosensors provided a wide detection range from 10 2 to 10 7 cells mL \u22121 but with different LODs, 30 cells mL \u22121 obtained by Sun et al. [149] and 15 cells mL \u22121 by Sun et al. [150] . The advantage of such cytosensors is the regeneration of the sensing system through an electrochemical reductive desorption method, which breaks the gold-thiol bond and removes all components on the gold nanoparticle/glassy carbon electrode surface. For example, Sun et al. [150] reported that the regenerating cytosensor retained 90% of its original sensitivity twice for cancer cell detection.",

            "text": "This review covered the recent clinical applications of sensors and biosensors for the detection and monitoring of different physiologically important analytes such as cancer and cardiac biomarkers, hormones, biomolecules, neurotransmitters, bacteria, virus and cancer cells. The analytical performance of these sensors and biosensors was compared. Electrochemical biosensors are most widely used, due to their miniaturization, easy handling and portability. They are also promising point-of-care tools, due to their high sensitivity and selectivity, rapid response and low cost. At present, the fabricated sensors and biosensors are being increasingly used to detect physiologically important analytes in real biological samples (blood serum and plasma, urine and saliva), as shown in Tables 2,  4 and 6, compared with the literature and our previous paper [3] . Recently, saliva has been considered an alternative sample for the determination of various analytes such as IL-6, CRP and cortisol with biosensors. Saliva collection is non-invasive, cost-effective, painfree and stress-free, and it does not require special laboratory equipment [154] . Furthermore, advances have been made in the development of nanoscale and microscale biosensors for point-ofcare testing of salivary analytes. Prototypes of sensors and biosensors in the clinical field are mainly developed for glucose and cholesterol detection. They are then used as point-of-care devices for routine diagnosis. Further concerns in the clinical application of current sensors and biosensors include enhancing their stability for other physiologically important analytes such as cancer and cardiac biomarkers, as well as hormones or neurotransmitters. The concentrations of these analytes are influenced by interfering molecules in real biological samples. This is particularly important for determining the analytical performance of an analytical technique, as reflected in the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [155] . These guidelines offer background information, guidance and experimental procedures for investigating, identifying and characterizing the effects of interfering substances on the test results. With respect to sensors and biosensors, recent studies have reported using specific recognition elements (such as synthesized elements as aptamers) to determine physiologically important analytes and facilitate chemical surface modification of solutions. This reduces the non-specific binding of interfering molecules, in turn enhancing the sensor selectivity [12] . In addition, the analytical performance of sensors and biosensors is enhanced by increasing their figures of merit, which is a major development in analytical chemistry. Further, this should be considered when developing commercial sensing systems from prototypes. All figures of merit should be considered in the validation of sensors and biosensors, for both clinical and practical applications such as food safety and environmental monitoring. Studies verifying the selectivity of sensors and biosensors are lacking. Testing the selectivity is crucial to ascertain whether the method can accurately quantify an analyte in the presence of interferences [3] .",
