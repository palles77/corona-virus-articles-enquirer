The title compound, (S)-1-[3-fluoro-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]-5-azacytosine (FPMP-5-azaC) was synthesised by the condensation reaction of (S)-2-[(diisopropoxyphosphoryl)methoxy)-3-fluoropropyl p-toluenesulfonate with a sodium salt of 5-azacytosine followed by separation of appropriate N 1 and O 2 regioisomers and ester hydrolysis. Transformations of FPMP-5-azaC to its 5,6-dihydro-5-azacytosine counterpart, amino acid phosphoramidate prodrugs and systems with an annelated five-membered imidazole ring, i.e. imidazo [1,2-a][1,3,5]triazine derivatives were also carried out. 1-(2-Phosphonomethoxy-3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)-5-azacytosine was prepared from 5-azacytosine and trifluoromethyloxirane to form 1-(3,3,3-trifluoro-2-hydroxypropyl)-5-azacytosine which was treated with diisopropyl bromomethanephosphonate followed by deprotection of esters. Antiviral activity of all newly prepared compounds was studied. FPMP-5-azaC diisopropyl ester inhibited the replication of herpes viruses with EC 50 values that were about three times higher than that of the reference anti-HCMV drug ganciclovir without displaying cytotoxicity.",

            "text": "The chemistry of acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (ANPs) is a key research topic of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry in Prague. The importance of these compounds lies in their biological activities, especially antiviral [1e4] . Three compounds of this class have already became commercially available drugs: cidofovir for the treatment of human cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in AIDS patients; adefovir in its prodrug form adefovir dipivoxil for the treatment of hepatitis B (HBV); and tenofovir, either as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, or more recently (since 2015) also as a new prodrug form tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), for the treatment of HIV and HBV infections [5] . The introduction of tenofovir to the market had a crucial influence on the transformation of HIV/AIDS from a mortal threat to a manageable chronic disease [6] . Besides, long-term systematic investigation of ANPs has enabled the development of many other therapeutically promising structures, which have been synthesised but have never advanced to the stage of preclinical/clinical investigations. Among others, this concerns fluorinated purine 3-fluoro-2-[(phosphonomethoxy)propyl] derivatives [7] and acyclic nucleoside phosphonates with 5-azacytosine base moiety [8e10]. 5-Azacytosine ANPs were originally synthesised with the aim to search for new epigenetic (hypomethylating) agents; contrary to 5azacytosine nucleosides (azacitidine, decitabine), however, this activity has not been found. It is evident that the presence of the sugar moiety is essential for this effect [11] . On the other hand, we found a new class of antiviral agents selective against DNA viruses. The lead compound of this group is 5-azacytosine analogue of cidofovir, 1-(S)-[3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]-5-azacytosine, HPMP-5-azaC (Fig. 1 ). In comparison with cidofovir, its antiviral activity data are similar, but the toxicity profile is more favourable, with the selectivity index (the ratio of the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) to the 50% effective concentration (EC 50 )) being 2-to 16-fold higher than that of cidofovir [8] . The antiviral activity of HPMP-5-azaC has been increased many times by the transformation to ester prodrugs derived from its cyclic form [9] .",

Fluorinated derivatives, especially nucleoside and nucleotide analogues are compounds of great interest [14] . An introduction of the fluorine atom into biologically active molecules often leads to remarkable changes in their physical, biological, and pharmacokinetic properties due to its electronegativity, size, omniphobicity or lipophilicity and electrostatic interactions [15] . In clinical practice, fluorinated nucleosides are utilised as effective cytostatics (e.g. gemcitabine) or antivirals (trifluridine, sofosbuvir) [16, 17] . Within the group of ANPs, 3-fluoro-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl (FPMP) derivatives have been identified as potent and selective inhibitors of retroviruses. The adenine derivative, (S)-9-[3-fluoro-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl] adenine, ((S)-FPMPA) exhibits even better in vivo anti-HIV and anti-HBV parameters than adefovir. The activity against HIV is also known for both enantiomers of 9-[3-fluoro-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]-2,6-diaminopurine (FPMPDAP) and its guanine counterpart [7, 18] . Structures of these compounds are depicted in Fig. 2 .",

The usual way to overcome this problem is the transformation of such compounds to appropriate prodrugs. The most frequently used ANP prodrugs are acyloxyalkyl (pivaloyloxymethyl, POM), alkyloxyalkyl, S-acylthioethyl (SATE), aryl, cyclic 1aryl-1,3-propanyl and cyclosaligenyl phophonate esters, phosphoramidates bearing amino acid esters and proTides [19] . Despite promising in vitro or in vivo studies, only a few of them have been proceeded into clinical trials. This can be attributed to the difficulty of the achievement of the right prodrug property balance, in particular suitable chemical stability, rate of conversion, safety with respect to by-products, the avoidance of stereoisomers, adequate physical properties (the ability to crystallise, solubility), and the ability to synthesize substantial quantities. The synthesis of ANP prodrugs and the investigation of their pharmacological properties have been the subject of many reviews [20, 21] .",

The synthon approach has already been reported for the preparation of purine FPMP derivatives by Jindrich et al. [22] Their synthesis started from protected 5 0 -Oribonolactone and included as many as nine reaction steps. Another, more efficient synthesis of FPMP synthons utilises enantiomeric fluorohydrines accessible from commercially available Otritylated glycidols by reaction with potassium hydrogen difluoride [23] . In our present work, we have investigated the fluorination of (R)-3-benzyloxy-2-[(diisopropylphosphoryl)methoxy)]propanol (3), a compound utilised in our laboratory as a common starting material for the preparation of 3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy) propyl derivatives.

Unlike various strongly corrosive reagents, e.g. DAST or deoxofluor, perfluorobutane-1-sulphonyl fluoride is stable, only little moisturesensitive and easy to handle. Its use for the direct fluorination of ANPs is known only from for several examples. In the above mentioned FPMPT synthesis, the appropriate starting material was the 3-hydroxy-2-[(phosphonomethoxy)propyl] derivative of 4-Omethoxy-5-methylpyrimidinone (not thymine). The reason is that these fluorinations are sensitive to the presence of acidic hydrogen atoms in the starting molecule. For example, the performance of the same reaction with the diisopropyl ester of HPMPT (containing NH at the position 3 of the thymine moiety), results in elimination under basic conditions resulting in a six-membered ring closure through the side-chain hydroxy group [29] . Similarly, this fluorination method also fails with cytosine derivatives (HPMPC). An important aspect of syntheses with perfluorobutane-1-sulphonyl fluoride is the selection of reaction conditions: base and solvent [32] . The base should be a good proton acceptor with low nucleophilicity and moderate basicity to avoid elimination. It the preparation of fluoro derivative 5 from (R)-3-benzyloxy-2-[(diisopropylphosphoryl)methoxy)]propanol (3), we chose between Nethylpiperidine (NEP) and 1,8-diazabicyclo [5.4 .0]undec-7-ene (DBU). The reaction with NEP had been reported to provide better results in the syntheses of fluorinated nucleosides [32] , but the preparation of our FPMP precursor proceeded satisfactory using DBU. The reaction was carried out in toluene, initially at room temperature. Although the yields of 5 were 42e50% the reaction rate was slow. A significant decrease of reaction time was achieved by heating to 90 C. Full conversion was observed when DBU was added for a few hours (3e4 h). The course of fluorination reaction with NEP was worse and required excess of perfluorobutanesulphonyl fluoride (90% conversion after 9 h). The final FPMP synthon, (S)-2-[(diisopropoxyphosphoryl)methoxy)-3-fluoropropyl p-toluenesulphonate (1), was obtained from 5 by the removal of a benzyl group via catalytic hydrogenation to give intermediate 6 which was further subjected to tosylation (Scheme 1).",

Reaction afforded a mixture of N 1 and O 2 regioisomers 8a and 8b, whose ratio depended on the reaction time (Scheme 2). The highest regioselectivity was observed when 5-azacytosine sodium salt was heated with phosphonate 1 at 120 C for 11 h. In this case, only N 1isomer 8a was detected but its preparative yield was low (28%). Further extension of the reaction time resulted in increased formation of O 2 -isomer 8b. After 24 h at 120 C, the ratio of regioisomers 8a:8b was 7:4 while their preparative yields were 28% (8a) and 16% (8b).

Nucleosides modified in this way, e.g. 5,6dihydro-5-azacytidine and 2 0 -deoxy-5,6-dihydro-5-azacytidine, still preserve their antitumor and hypomethylating activities.

In the field of ANPs, we previously reported the 5,6-dihydro derivative of HPMP-5-azaC ( Fig. 1) .

The usual way using bromotrimethylsilane completely failed, leading to a mixture of decomposition products. Another possibility was a microwave-assisted acid hydrolysis. This method of the transformation of phosphonate esters to free ANPs has been originally developed at the IOCB by Jansa and Hol\u00fd. This method is usually very clean and the isolation of products is easy [35, 36] . In our experiments, we hydrolysed 15a-c with two equivalents of HCl at 150 C for 5e15 min under micro-wave irradiation. Unfortunately, the ring of the triazine moiety opened and the C-6 methylene group was hydrolytically split off. This indicated the destabilisation of the 5,6-dihydro-5-azacytosine ring as a consequence of imidazole-triazine annelation. On the other hand, we had observed earlier that 5-azacytosine ANPs can have better stability in the cases when their phosphonic function is masked by an appropriate prodrug group [9, 11, 37] . Taking into account this finding, we selected another synthetic strategy starting from bis(amidate) prodrug of FPMP-5-azaC 11. Compound 11 can be easily reduced to the corresponding 5,6-dihydro form 18 which is then subjected to condensation reaction with 2-bromoacetophenones to form the desired annelated structures 19a-c in their prodrug forms (Scheme 6). The other way, Jansa's method [33] for the transformation of phosphonate ester 12 into phosphoramidate 18 doesn't take place. This may have been caused by the presence of acetic acid in the structure of 12. Condensation reactions using 2,2 0dipyridyldisulphide (Aldrithiol) and triphenylphosphine are known to proceed via a cyclic intermediate whose formation requires a proton coming from a nucleophile [38] (e.g. amino acid ester). It is possible that acetic acid preferentially protonates a pyridine unit of 2-thiopyridine which then cannot activate a nucleophile and phosphonate units.",

Reaction time was modified according to the rate of conversion of the starting esters. IR spectra were recorded on a FTIR Spectrometer Bruker IFS 55 (Equinox) in KBr, CCl 4 and CHCl 3 . 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were acquired on Bruker Avance 600 III HD and Bruker Avance 500 III HD spectrometers operating at 600.1 and 500.0 MHz for 1 H and 150.9 and 125.7 MHz for 13 C, respectively. 31 P { 1 H} NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance 500 III HD or Bruker Avance 400 III HD operating at 202.3 or 162.0 MHz, respectively.19 F NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance 500 III HD operating at 470.3 MHz. NMR samples were dissolved in CDCl 3 , DMSO-d6  , CD 3 OD or D 2 O and NMR spectra were referenced to the residual solvent signal (CDCl 3 : d( 1 H) \u00bc 7.26 ppm, d( 13 C) \u00bc 77.0 ppm; DMSO-d 6 : d( 1 H) \u00bc 2.50 ppm, d( 13 C) \u00bc 39.7 ppm; CD 3 OD-d 6 : d( 1 H) \u00bc 3.31 ppm, d( 13 C) \u00bc 49.0 ppm). Aqueous samples were referenced to signals of 1,4-dioxane as an external standard (d( 1 H) \u00bc 3.75 ppm, d( 13 C) \u00bc 69.3 ppm). The complete assignment of NMR signals was based on a combination of 1D and 2D correlation experiments (H,HeCOSY, H,C-HSQC, H,C-HMBC). The general numbering scheme for the assignment of NMR signals is outlined in Fig. 3. Mass spectra were measured on an LTQ Orbitrap XL (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated in the ESI mode. Optical rotations were measured on a Autopol IV polarimeter (Rudolph Research Analytical, U.S.A.) at 20 C, [a] D values are given in 10 \u00c01 deg cm 2 g \u00c01 . The concentrations for specific rotation measuements are in the units of g/100 mL.",
