Mathematical analysis and modeling operation of infectious diseases are critical to study virus spreading dynamics which can state clearly the origination and evolution of viruses. In recent years, many mathematical models have been proposed for the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] such as, SI (susceptible-infective), SIR (susceptible-infectiveremoved), SEIR (susceptible-exposure-infective-recovered), SEI (susceptible-exposure-infective), SIRS (susceptible-infective-removed-susceptible), SEIS (susceptible-exposure-infective-susceptible). The development of such models is aimed at exploring the transmission dynamics of epidemic virus, investigating the evolution of resistance to antibiotics and the evolutionary cost of resistance, and designing the programs for disease control. However, a model's ability to achieve the above goals depends greatly on whether the assumptions made in the modeling process are consistent with the actual evolution of the epidemic diseases. Understanding and predicting the actual transmission dynamics of the epidemic diseases is, therefore, an important pursuit in mathematical epidemiology, which is one of our motivations for this work.",

The underlying reason behind such attention is that through stability analysis for the epidemic models, the tendency of the infectious diseases can be found by the basic reproductive number R 0 (the average number of secondary cases produced by a typical primary case in an entirely susceptible population) and the generation time (the average time from symptom onset in a primary case to symptom onset in a secondary case), which determine to a large extent the speed of epidemic outbreaks. Based on the stability principles, the conditions of the infectious diseases persistence or extinction were obtained [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .",

            "text": "Huang [3] presented an SEIR model, which is suitable for the eradication of diseases by mass vaccination or the control of diseases by case isolation combined with contact tracing, incorporating the vaccine efficacy or the control efficacy into the model. An SIRC model with a fourth class, i.e., the cross-immune individuals, was proposed [9] . Via bifurcation analysis of the model, they discussed the effect of seasonality on the epidemiological regimes. In this model, the incubation period of virus is not considered, nevertheless, a majority of infectious diseases have incubation period. Buonomo et al. [16] studied the global behavior of a non-linear SIR epidemic model with a non-bilinear feedback mechanism, which describes the influences of information and information-related delays on a vaccination campaign. Wan and Cui [17] proposed an SEIS epidemic model to study the effect of transport-related infection on the spread and control of infectious disease. Furthermore, through stability analysis, they found that it is very essential to strengthen restrictions of passengers once infectious diseases appearance is known. In [18] , McCluskey studied the complete global stability for the SIR models with distributed delay and with discrete delay. Lahrouz et al. [19] analyzed the complete global stability for an SIRS epidemic model with generalized nonlinear incidence and vaccination. In [20] , Kuniya studied the global asymptotic stability for an age-structured multigroup SIR epidemic model with a discretization approach. Muroya et al. [21] investigated the global asymptotic stability of a disease transmission model of SIRS type with latent period and the specific non-monotone incidence rate. The results of these studies, however, do not take into account the whole process of the epidemic diseases such as the exposed fraction and the partial immunity individuals, which are to a great extent owing to deficiency of the genetic variation behavior of the virus and the epidemiology theory. Consequently, they are limited on reflecting the actual transmission dynamics of the epidemic diseases and offering the practical proposal for government to draw up the policy.",

Our model differs from the existing ones in [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] in the following respect: (i) our model additionally takes into account the exposed fraction and the partial immunity individuals; (ii) our model is coupled with evolutionary-epidemic strategy and human interference behaviors such as vaccination to a proportion of all newborn children; (iii) in particular, the force of infection of the infectious disease in the existing work is multiplied by a constant such as survival probability while in this paper, it is governed by a nonlinear time-varying growing curve of pathogens, which reflects the viruses' evolution. Subsequently, we transform the SEIRW model into the ordinary differential equation with time-varying perturbation. Then we carry out a complete stability analysis of the transformed SEI-RW model and establish its stability criteria. Furthermore, we introduce the time-varying delay into the susceptible and infective stages of the SEIRW model and provide the globally exponential stability criteria for the SEIRW model with the time-varying delay. Finally, the numerical simulations verify the results. One of our purposes for this work is to investigate the effect of the treatment on the long term dynamics of the disease, and show that the treatment or rational immunization to prolong the susceptible or infective stages can hasten the disease dying out. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first one that builds a novel SEIRW model by considering pathogen evolution and human interference behaviors, and further establishes sufficient conditions for the asymptotic stability of the model with time-varying perturbation and the global exponential stability of the model with time-varying delay.",

From an epidemiological point of view, the normal community of people can be divided into five compartments at any time t for the majority infectious diseases such as influenza A, SARS and AIDS: the susceptible individuals S(t), who may be infected by the viruses, and do not have specific immune defenses against the infectious disease; the exposed fraction E(t), which denotes hosts whom viruses have entered into while the viruses are in incubation period; the infective individuals I(t), who are infected by the specific viruses and are infectious to the susceptible individuals; the recovered fraction R(t), which denotes those individuals who have recovered from the infection but have partially immune to the specific pathogen. However, after a period of time, a part of the individuals in R(t) enter the next group W(t), the partial immunity individuals, because they have only partial immunity to the viruses owing to their variation in the new environment [26, 30] , as in the case of SRAS [26] , influenza [31] and pertussis [32] . The environment is much important for the survival of intermediate hosts and for the survival of the pathogens outside the host, which can affect the efficiency of transmission. The environmental component of infectiousness can result in an unusually large number of secondary infections, which motivates that the environmental effect should be considered in our model. For example, the 'superspreading' event led to various secondary severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infections among residents of the Amoy Gardens estate in Hong Kong in 2003 [26] .",

In this study, vaccination is applied to a ratio of all newborn children. Because of newborn children's highly immature immune systems, it is difficult to generate antibody to the special infectious disease after they have been injected vaccination or drug. Even so, it is the forceful strategies for the government to prevent viruses such as AIDS and influenza A transmission. We assume that the ratio of vaccination to newborn children is Bv, and the newborns successfully gain the vaccine and obtain immunity to infection.

Practically, government can control Bv by vaccinating the newborn children to delay the outbreak of the disease.

One of our goals is to obtain the relatively accurate conditions to ensure the asymptotic stability of the SEIRW model, in other words, to give the practical conditions that the infectious disease will not be diffuse infinitely and disappear gradually. This study can quantify the effects of human interference behaviors like vaccination on the diseases spread. Furthermore, we introduce the time-varying delay into the susceptible individuals and the infective individuals in the SEIRW model and analyze the global exponential stability of the SEIRW model with time-varying delay. Our results show that rational immunization for the susceptible or infective individuals may hasten the disease dying out. Finally, the numerical simulations verify the results.",

Thus, some key efforts might be made to public healthy authorities, for example, rational immunization could be acceptable only in the case where the spontaneous baseline vaccination rate fulfills the reverse of inequality. The challenge to the infectious disease epidemiologist is to resolve the concealed determinants of the human interference behaviors of the transmission of the infectious disease and discriminate rules that could enable effective controls to be identified and this behavior to be predicted.",
