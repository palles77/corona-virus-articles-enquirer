These include emerging and reemerging threats, nosocomial infections, travel-related illness, even bioweapons. By being attuned to the situations where our patients can become involved which may predispose them to increased risk of infections, we can provide invaluable support and guidance. This includes proper preventive measureswhether vector control, or places to avoid, how to dine in areas where food hygiene may be limited, medication prophylaxis, even obtaining appropriate travel health insurance, and where to obtain medical care, are all useful. Moreover being knowledgeable where to obtain information and updated treatment strategies is valuable.",

Science can provide timely antimicrobials, even vaccines to help thwart the spread of infections. But disease and health care live at the street level where person to person transmission occurs. Hospital and emergency department(ED) overcrowding remains a significant problem in containing the spread of infections. While some health care facilities (HCF) have improved access to masks and hand sanitizers, as well as placed cough/sneeze etiquette posters, these can have limited value if manpower shortages, cultural imperatives, for example going to a health care facility with many members of the family, language and education barriers all work against social distancing, personal hygiene and other containment strategies. Some practices and health care facilities have implemented old pediatric strategies of placing potentially contagious patients into separate areas. Clearly this is a space, manpower and resource intensive strategy, but one that may reduce transmission of illness from those who are injured. On the regional and national level, a serious discussion on best practices in terms of how to cohort and isolate potentially contagious people, as well as strategies to alleviate overcrowding, much of which stems from the misuse of ED and HCF for primary care problems is vitally necessary.",

Clearly our options in terms of countermeasures against viruses remains limited compared to bacterial pathogens. That notwithstanding, one has to wonder if a clinical research infrastructure in the early phases of that outbreak might have enhanced the public health and clinical response. Few prospective controlled studies were undertaken to define the best treatment options for SARS CoV in 2003, which limits our ability to apply these to MERS CoV [1] .",

Growing visitations of students, business people, along with immigration of persons from impoverished nations where citizens therein are often sick with a variety of communicable diseases, and bringing with them illnesses we may not be familiar with, it is incumbent upon us to work within our regions to address such vulnerabilities of capacity. This can be especially problematic with an overburdened public health system. But if we don't address these challenges now, while there aren't aggressive outbreaks emerging in our community, when one does occur, and that will happen, we will be much more prepared. That means lives saved. Together we can limit the risk of emerging pathogens and the impact of outbreaks in our community. ",
