The incidence varies with geography, population demographics, comorbid conditions, and the severity of the flu season. There are approximately 4 million cases of communityacquired pneumonia and at least 300,000 cases of hospital-acquired pneumonia reported annually. Pneumonia accounts for the largest mortality of any common infectious disease. Pneumonia ranks in the top seven among the major leading causes of death in adults in the USA. It is the fourth leading cause of death in the US elderly population. A large variety of organisms cause pneumonia (Table 15 -1). The important complications of pneumonia include abscess formation, pleural effusion and empyema formation, bacteremia and sepsis, septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), meningitis, endocarditis, and multiple organ dysfunction or failure.",

Pulmonary infection can be caused by inhalation of aerosolized inoculate, aspiration of secretions or particulate matter, hematogenous spread, or direct inoculation. The most common mechanism of pneumonia development is by contamination of the naso-oropharynx or upper airway, and subsequent aspiration of infected secretions into the distal respiratory tree. In otherwise healthy patients, pharyngeal secretions have a bacterial concentration of approximately 10 10 organisms/ml. Therefore, aspiration of exceedingly small volumes (<0.1 ml) introduces a high-titer bacterial inoculum into the respiratory tract.

Since atypical pathogens were more difficult to identify on Gram stain and cultures, and the term \"atypical pneumonia\" was coined. The atypical pneumonias can cause serious clinical syndromes with high morbidity and mortality and frequently require ICU care. Presently, the diagnostic tests for atypical pathogens include polymerase chain reaction, complement fixation, microimmunofluorescence, and enzyme immunoassay (for C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae); others include the serum IgM antibody (\"cold agglutinin\") for Mycoplasma, and direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) and indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (for Legionella spp.). The most established of these techniques is complement fixation which is relatively uncomplicated but has low sensitivity. The fluorescence techniques determine antibody titer in diluted serum samples but are subjective and costly. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) to not require dilution and because the results are measured in optical density (OD) units there is less subjectivity. Urinary antigen testing for Legionella pneumophilia serogroup 1 is a nonserologic test which becomes positive only after a few days of illness and may require a second test during the convalescent phase of illness to confirm the diagnosis, if such confirmation is necessary.",

Histoplasma is found in soil contaminated with bird and bat excreta. Histoplasmosis is the most common systemic mycosis in the USA and is characteristically found in the Ohio and Mississippi river valleys.

Less than 5% of infected individuals develop rheumatologic syndromes such as pericarditis and arthralgias or inflammatory granulomatous mediastinitis. In patients with impaired immunologic function or patients who have received a high inoculum exposure, such as construction or agricultural workers, there may be an acute overwhelming pulmonary histoplasmosis characterized by profound hypoxemia and diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Rare complications of histoplasmosis include chronic upper lobe cavitary pneumonic disease, fibrosing mediastinitis, and progressive disseminated histoplasmosis.

Late-onset VAP is pneumonia which is diagnosed 96 hours or more after the initiation of mechanical ventilation and is typically caused by MRSA, ORSA, P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp., or Acinetobacter spp. These organisms are more likely to be resistant and to contribute to morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the key core pathogens in VAP are generally P. aeruginosa, S. pneumoniae, Acinetobacter spp., S. aureus, and EGNB.",

Empiric antibiotic therapy for VAP must account for both aggressive combination therapy based on an antibiogram specific to the ICU, as well as criteria for the duration of therapy.

A key dilemma in the diagnosis of VAP is the differentiation between endotracheal tube colonization, airway colonization, bronchitis, and true pneumonia. Colonization can be defined as the persistence of microorganisms at an anatomic site without evidence of host response or local invasion. The differentiation between pneumonia and colonization is especially difficult when the diagnosis is based on nonquantitative cultures obtained by simple endotracheal tube suctioning. A variety of microorganisms normally colonize the upper respiratory tract and these include Viridans streptococci, Streptococcus pyogenes, Neisseria spp., Moraxella, Corynebacterium, Lactobacillus, and Candida spp.",

Studies have repeatedly been unable to demonstrate with statistical significance the clear value of any technique over any other.

Endotracheal tube aspirates are the most commonly performed method of culturing respiratory secretions. Since endotracheal tube aspirates culture both contaminants and colonization as well as infectious pneumonia, the use of semiquantitative cultures and the determination of sputum neutrophil count can greatly increase their sensitivity. Bronchoscopy is an important adjunct to the diagnosis of VAP, giving direct visualization of the airways which can reveal inflammation, mucus, and mucus plugging. A protected brush specimen can be obtained either blindly or with a bronchoscope. The protected brush is designed to reduce false positive cultures which are due to contamination from upper airway secretions and may represent only tracheobronchitis rather than true pneumonia. The protected brush is housed within a closed cannula. When the cannula is passed into the distal airways, the brush is advanced through the occluding plug of the cannula and is exposed directly to distal respiratory secretions. Structures are retracted into the cannula and removed for plating and culture.

Methylprednisolone is the intravenous steroid bronchodilator of choice; prednisone is administered enterally. Patients for whom steroids have been chronically prescribed prior to admission require supplemental \"stress doses\" to avoid adrenal insufficiency in the setting of infectious stress. Mucolytic agents and expectorants may have a role when mucus clearance is difficult in the setting of dehydration or inspissated mucus is difficult for the patient to clear. N-acetylcysteine, recombinant DNase, and guaifenesin are prototypic mucolytic agents. Nacetylcysteine can precipitate bronchospasm and should be administered concomitantly with bronchodilators.",

Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) is an adaptive response whereby a reflex vasoconstriction in the arteriolar supply to inflamed or diseased alveoli which have low alveolar oxygen concentrations results in minimization of pulmonary shunt fraction. Therefore, pulmonary arteriolar vasodilators which inhibit the HPV response are likely to increase blood supply to diseased hypoxic alveoli and actually increase shunt fraction and systemic hypoxemia.",

The chest radiograph is also key in the evaluation of a patient's response to therapy. The critical care notes should reflect independent readings as well as later confirmations or variations seen by radiologists. (i) Endotracheal tube: should be midway between the clavicles and the carina within the trachea. It is important to note that the endotracheal tube will move approximately 2.5 cm in or out of the trachea with extension and flexion of the neck, respectively. (ii) Nasogastric and feeding tubes: must be followed within the esophagus into the stomach or small bowel. Tubes that enter the trachea will often pass through one mainstem bronchus. (iii) Tube thoracostomy: mention is usually made of the position of the tube, the intra-or extrathoracic placement of a last collecting hole of the chest tube, and resolution of the liquid or air collection which the tube was intended to treat. (iv) Other hardware: tracheostomy tubes, pacemakers, implantable cardiac defibrillation wires, intra-aortic balloon pump tips, prosthetic cardiac valves, evidence of vascular prostheses and stents, sternal wires, surgical clips, orthopedic prostheses, and airway stents. The mention of other foreign bodies, especially in trauma cases, is particularly important. (c) Bony structures:",

However, Bacillus anthracis, a Gram-positive spore-forming bacillus, has also recently surfaced as a biological terror agent in the USA. Inhalational anthrax results in a hemorrhagic necrotic pneumonitis evolving 2-43 days following exposure. Lymphadenitis, pleuritis, and mediastinitis, however, are likely to predominate over pneumonitis. Fluoroquinolones are the drug of choice since tetracycline and penicillinresistant strains have been isolated.
