Results: There was a significant impairment in both the HRQoL and mental functioning. Forty-one percent had scores indicative of a posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); about 30% had likely anxiety and depression. Conclusion: SARS has significant impact on HRQoL and psychological status at 3 months. D",

All the domains of the quality of life measured were affected. Although the clinical episode was over, the illness was far from being over after 3 months. This is a strong reminder of the difference in disease and illness concepts, the latter being the one that tends to be overlooked by clinicians. The duration of hospitalisation and admission to ICU are often used as measures of the severity of illness. From our data, admission to ICU and not the duration of hospitalisation impacted on the physical domain of the instruments. It appeared that ICU admission is a more appropriate index of severity of SARS febrile episode. Those with a greater respiratory compromise ended up with worse physical role restriction and lower vitality scores.

The degree of impairment reached that of SLE patients. The decline in social functioning could be partly accounted for by the fact that SARS was a highly contagious disease, and, consciously or otherwise, patients might reduce social activities. The decline in physical role was intriguing, considering that there was no proportional corresponding decline in physical function or vitality, as in the case of the SLE population. This could be due to the failure of the instrument to detect the decline.

Further, the HRQoL SF-36 profile of the SARS patients also shares the typical physical role limitation like that of depressed patients, with a disproportionate impairment in the physical function (Fig. 3) [18, 19] . In the report by Malik et al. [20] on the quality of life of PTSD sufferers (Fig. 3) , however, there was neither physical impairment nor physical role limitation.
