Mathematical models can provide insights into the dynamics of nosocomial infections and help to evaluate the effect of infection control measures. The model presented in this paper adopts an individual-based and stochastic approach to investigate MRSA outbreaks in a hospital ward. A computer simulation was implemented to analyze the dynamics of the system associated with the spread of the infection and to carry out studies on space and personnel management. This study suggests that a strict spatial cohorting might be ineffective, if it is not combined with personnel cohorting.",

After initial HAI studies based on a deterministic approach, almost all research groups have started to apply a stochastic approach to the HAI problem. In HAI modelling, a stochastic approach is desirable for the following reasons [16, 20, 21] : (a) the infection transmission is a discrete and random event; (b) the individuals are heterogeneous; (c) the population is small.",

In general, the values for these parameters are derived directly from observational data or by using a parameterisation procedure. Typical values reported in the literature are listed in Table 1 . The limitations of the mass-action hypothesis have been highlighted in several studies [15, 17, 18, 23, 24] . First, this principle implies that the population mixes homogeneously and that each susceptible and infectious individual is accessible to all others at all times. However, in general, the hospital population shows heterogeneity-patients may be grouped based on sex, age, clinical specialty, severity of illness, given treatments; spatial and/or personnel cohorting may be applied. Second, the movement of each individual staff member within a ward or an intensive care unit cannot generally be consid- ered as random-e.g. the health-care workers may carry out ward rounds on a regular basis and in a set pattern. Third, the transmission rate, as defined by Eq. (1), is a state variable and, as a result, it does not explicitly include the role of individual behaviour in the transmission process. As a result, the individual properties, such as the status or the actions of each agent, cannot be properly represented in this kind of modelling approach.",

The Direct Monte Carlo (DMC) method is applied to take the stochasticity of the system into account. The DMC method has an absolute estimation error that decreases with N \u22121/2 , where N is the number of simulation runs. The typical number of simulation runs performed is between 25 and 100. A discrete approximation (spatial and time discretization) is applied to the dynamics of the system. The temporal evolution of the system is taken into account by using two parameters: the time step and the time scale. The time step is set to 15 min. The time scale is the maximum time interval during which the system evolves. In this study, a time scale of 3 months is chosen. In order to simulate the evolution of the system, the following factors are taken into account: the status and the movement of each agent, the contacts between individuals during a ward round, the hand hygiene compliance for each agent, and the control measures (spatial and personnel cohorting) applied.",
