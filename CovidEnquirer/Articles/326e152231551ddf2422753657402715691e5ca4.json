            "text": "Molecular genetic studies during the last decades have led to an enormous increase in our understanding of the molecular biology of the replication of viruses. The complete nucleotide sequences of many virus genomes have been determined. Information on the origins required for the replication of these genomes, the promoters used to express the information within them, and the packaging signals required for packaging progeny genomes into virions have been established for many. The mechanisms by which viral mRNAs are preferentially translated have been explored. Together with methods for cloning and manipulating viral genomes, this information has made possible the use of viruses as vectors to express foreign genes. In principle, any virus can be used as a vector, and systems that use a very wide spectrum of virus vectors have been described. DNA viruses were first developed as vectors, since it is possible to manipulate the entire genome in the case of smaller viruses, or to use homologous recombination to insert a gene of interest in the case of larger viruses. Recent developments now make it possible to manipulate the entire genomes of even very large DNA viruses as artificial chromosomes, which potentially makes the use of these large genomes for expression of foreign proteins even more appealing. When complete cDNA clones of RNA viruses were obtained, it became straightforward to rescue plusstrand viruses from clones because the viral RNA itself is infectious, and many such viruses have been used to express proteins. The use of minus-strand RNA viruses as vectors was delayed because the virion RNA itself is not infectious, but recent developments has made it possible to rescue virus from cloned DNA by using coexpression of the appropriate viral proteins in a transfected cell. As a consequence, minusstrand RNA viruses have also joined the club of expression systems receiving intense study. Retroviruses have also been widely used because of their capacity to integrate into a host chromosome and potentially express foreign proteins indefinitely.",

Every virus system has advantages and disadvantages as a vector, depending on its intended use. One of the more exciting uses has been the development of viruses as vectors for gene therapy, that is, to correct genetic defects in humans. In the most general sense, gene therapy involves transfer of genetic information into a cell, tissue, organ, or organism with the goal of improving the clinical outcome, either by curing a disease, or alleviating an underlying condition in a patient. Although results have been disappointingly slow in coming, such systems offer great promise. This use represents an example of taking these infectious agents that have been the source of much human misery and developing them for the betterment of mankind. Such expression systems have a wide variety of other potential uses, however. Efforts to engineer viruses to kill cancer cells are also receiving attention. Viruses that express foreign proteins have potential uses in the engineering of new vaccines against other pathogens. Finally, viral expression systems have proved very useful in the expression of proteins in cell culture that can be used for various studies.",

            "text": "Vaccinia virus is a poxvirus with a large dsDNA genome of 200 kb (Chapter 7). Until recently, this genome was too big to handle in one piece in a convenient fashion, and homologous recombination has been used to insert foreign genes into it. The large size of the viral genome, however, does mean that very large pieces of foreign DNA can be inserted, while leaving the virus competent for independent replication and assembly. Another advantage of the virus is that it has been used to vaccinate hundreds of millions of humans against smallpox. Thus, there is much experience with the effects of the virus in humans. Although the vaccine virus did cause serious side effects in a small fraction of vaccinees, highly attenuated strains of vaccinia have been developed for use in gene therapy by deleting specific genes associated with virulence. A new approach to the use of poxvirus vectors has been the development of nonhuman poxviruses, such as canarypox virus, as vectors. Canarypox virus infection of mammals is abortive and essentially asymptomatic, but foreign genes incorporated into the canarypox virus genome are expressed in amounts that are sufficient to obtain an immunologic response.",

This method is illustrated in Fig. 11 .1. The thymidine kinase (TK) gene of vaccinia virus is nonessential for growth of the virus in tissue culture. Furthermore, deletion of the TK gene results in attenuation of the virus in humans, which is a desirable trait. Finally, the TK gene can be either positively or negatively selected 424 Gene Therapy .1 Construction of recombinant vaccinia virus expression vector. The foreign gene (red) is inserted into a bacterial plasmid adjacent to a vaccinia promoter (black arrow), flanked with sequences from the vaccinia thymidine kinase gene (turquoise). Plasmid DNA is transfected into cells infected with wild-type (TK + ) vaccinia virus. Recombinant progeny from homologous recombination are all TK \u2212 , due to interruption of the TK gene, and can be selected by growth in bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR), since incorporation of BUdR into TK + vaccinia is lethal. These TK \u2212 vaccinia will infect normally and express the foreign gene under control of the vaccinia promoter. Adapted from Strauss and Strauss (1997) Figure 2 .25 on p. 115. by using different media for propagation of the virus. The starting point is a plasmid clone that contains a copy of the TK gene that has a large internal deletion. In the region of the deletion a vaccinia virus promoter is inserted upstream of a polylinker. The gene of interest is inserted into the polylinker using standard cloning technology. Thus, we have the foreign gene downstream of a vaccinia promoter, and the entire insert is flanked by sequences from the vaccinia TK gene. The plasmid containing the cloned TK gene with its foreign gene insert is transfected into cells that have been infected by wild-type vaccinia virus. Homologous recombination between the TK gene in the virus and the TK-flanking sequences in the plasmid occurs with a sufficiently high frequency that a reasonable fraction of the progeny have the gene of interest incorporated. These viruses have an inactive TK gene (they are TK \u2212 ), because the TK gene has been replaced by the deleted version containing the inserted foreign gene. The next step, then, is to select for viruses that are TK \u2212 by growing virus in the presence of bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR). An active TK enzyme will phosphorylate BUdR to the monophosphate form, which can be further phosphorylated by cellular enzymes to the triphosphate and incorporated into the viral nucleic acid during replication. Incorporation of BUdR is lethal under the appropriate conditions, and thus viruses that survive this treatment are those in which the TK gene has been inactivated.",

Because of their apparent safety, adenoviruses have been developed for use as vectors in gene therapy trials or for vaccine purposes. Two approaches have been used. In one, infectious adenoviruses have been produced that express a gene of interest. In the second approach, suicide vectors are produced that can infect a cell and express the gene of interest, but which are defective and cannot produce progeny virus.

To prepare the stock of virus lacking E1, the virus must be grown in a cell line that expresses E1. An overview of this process is shown in Fig. 11 .2. The complementing cell line, which produces E1 constitutively, supplies the E1 needed for replication of the defective adenovirus. The cells are transfected with the defective adenovirus DNA and a full yield of progeny virions results. The progeny virus is defective and cannot replicate in normal cells, but it can be amplified by infection of the complementing cell line.

They are being developed as expression vectors because they are not pathogenic in humans and because they normally integrate into the host-cell genome in a specific region, thus minimizing the problems of insertional mutagenesis. The genome size is small enough to be readily manipulated as a DNA clone, but the small size also limits the amount of DNA that can be inserted and therefore the applicability of the virus for gene transfer experiments. A related problem is that for expression studies, the genome is normally deleted for the AAV genes with only the ends that function as promoter sites retained. However, site-specific integration requires the activity of the Rep protein.

A second approach is to separate the Gag-Pol sequences from the Env sequences in the helper cell.

An approach that uses monoclonal antibodies to direct Sindbis virus to specific cells has been described. Protein A, produced by Staphylococcus aureas, binds with high affinity to IgG. It is an important component of the virulence of the bacterium because it interferes with the host immune system. The IgG-binding domain of protein A has been inserted into one of the viral glycoproteins. Virions containing this domain are unable to infect cells using the normal receptor. However, the virus will bind IgG monoclonal antibodies. If an antibody directed against a cell surface component is bound, the virus will infect cells expressing this protein at the cell surface. Thus, this system has the potential to direct the virus to a specific cell type. One of the advantages of this approach is that the virus, once made, can be used with many different antibodies and thus directed against a variety of cell types. This approach is potentially applicable to any enveloped virus, and perhaps to nonenveloped viruses as well.",

The essential genes are arranged 5\u2032-replicase-S-E-M-N-3\u2032, and are interspersed with a number of nonessential genes which are group specific. Recent studies have revealed a number of characteristics which make them even more attractive as vector candidates. The first was that the deletion of the nonessential genes is sufficiently attenuating that no further mutations in the essential genes are required to produce an avirulent virus. Second, as the precise domains on the S protein which interact with the species-dependent cellular receptors were determined, it was found that both species and tissue specificity could be altered by relatively minor changes in the sequence of S. Third, it is possible to rearrange the linear order of the genes, and while this altered the relative amounts of the products, it reduces the possibility that the vector (vaccine) could undergo recombination with field strains.

Encapsidation of the antigenomic RNA by N, P, and L to form nucleocapsids allows it to replicate and produce genomic RNA that is also encapsidated. Synthesis of mRNAs from the genomic RNA, together with continued replication, results in a complete virus replication cycle and production of infectious progeny virus that have as their genome the RNA supplied as a cDNA clone.

Recent studies with anti-HIV drugs given very soon after infection found that limiting the replication of the virus early appears to allow the generation of a protective immune response in at least some patients.

For successful treatment, expression of the missing protein must be long-term and preferably lifelong, the levels of protein produced must be sufficient to alleviate the symptoms of the disease, the protein must be expressed in or translocated to those cells that require the normal protein for function, and infection with the virus vector must be free of disease symptoms. Because of the requirement for long-term expression, viruses whose DNA integrates into the host chromosome, such as the simple retroviruses as well as the lentiviruses, and adeno-associated viruses, offer the most promising system for many diseases.

Most of the modern vectors have had more and more of the dispensable viral genes deleted. Deletion of these genes reduces pathogenicity, and prevents the production of immunogenic viral antigens. Often only the gene of interest and the viral transcriptional regulatory elements are left, and to prepare the vectors for use in trials, all other functions must be supplied by a helper virus or a packaging cell line.

Although lack of this protein results in damage to the epithelium in many parts of the body, the most serious manifestation is lung disease accompanied by chronic bacterial infection of the airways. Clinical trials using adenoviral vectors, which infect respiratory epithelium, to express CFTR in the lungs have been conducted. The first such studies were encouraging, but a more recent trial that was carefully controlled found no relief of symptoms. Inflammation produced by the high doses of adenovirus used in trials is also a problem. It is difficult to get efficient delivery to the lung, especially through the thick mucus that is a characteristic of cystic fibrosis. In addition, the expression needs to continue for the life of the patient, which means either a very stable (integrated?) gene being expressed, or a system of repeated administration of vector that can be tolerated without immunologic consequences. Lentiviruses have been proposed as an attractive vector, but there have been concerns about probable pathogenesis due to the lentivirus itself. However, for this disease, the most promising mode of gene delivery so far developed has been DNA compacted into nanoparticles with polycations, in particular PEG-polylysine, nicknamed \"polyplexes.\" A clinical trial in humans used CFTR polyplexes, and the Phase I trial showed no adverse effects.

Low-pressure intravenous injection of AAV6 expressing micro-dystrophin into a mouse could transfect 90% of muscle, but high titers of the AAV6 vector were required.

Since severely truncated dystrophin (like micro-dystrophin) can be functional (Fig. 11.13 ), therapy to get rid of the exon causing the problem is being developed. Modified antisense oligonucleotides (AOs) can be used to alter the splicing pattern of the gene such that the exon in which the frameshift occurs is skipped, thereby restoring the reading frame. Following success of an AO with a 2\u2032O-methyl-phosphorothiolate backbone (2OMe AOs) to restore function in the mdx mouse, two clinical Phase I trials have been initiated, one in the Netherlands using 2OMe AOs and one in Great Britain using morpholino AOs.

If the disease progresses far enough, joint replacement may be required. The disease is associated with the release of inflammatory cytokines in the affected joints. Clinical trials have started that use retroviruses to deliver the gene for an anti-arthritic cytokine gene to the joints. The gene encodes the interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist, which inhibits the biological actions of both IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2.

Thirteen patients with chronic chest pain who had failed angioplasty or bypass surgery or both were injected in the heart muscle with DNA encoding vascular endothelial growth factor. This factor promotes the growth of blood vessels, a process called angiogenesis. Two months after treatment, all patients exhibited an improvement in vascularization of damaged areas of the heart, as shown by imaging and mapping studies. All patients reported a decrease in disease symptoms, and all had an improved performance in treadmill tests.

As shown in Fig. 11 .12, the development of gene therapy approaches for the control of cancers continues to attract much effort, such that the majority of clinical trails to date have been directed against cancers.

Another approach is to try to repair the defective regulatory gene in the tumor cell, which is often p53. Many other gene products are also being tested. The viruses used to express these products include the retroviruses, the adenoviruses, or the poxviruses. More recent trials have used additional viruses as well, in particular the herpesviruses and the adeno-associated viruses. Herpes simplex type 1 would seem to be particularly appropriate for control of brain tumors, because the virus is neurotropic but sets up a latent infection in neurons. One idea would be to engineer herpes to express a protein that is only toxic in dividing cells but which would be nontoxic in mature, nondividing neurons.

For this approach to succeed, an antigen overproduced by a tumor cell, such as a melanoma cell, must be identified, inserted into a suitable vector, and the person with the tumor infected with the virus vector in an attempt to stimulate the immune system.

Cell death might result either because the virus itself is cytolytic or because the virus expresses a protein that renders the cell sensitive to a toxic agent such as BUdR. A number of the trials listed in Table  11 .6 use the TK gene for this, since cells that express TK are sensitive to BUdR. One possible approach is to engineer the virus so that its surface glycoprotein expresses a monoclonal antibody directed against an antigen expressed only on the tumor cell, while at the same time causing the virus to be unable to infect cells that do not express the antigen. Experiments have established the possibility of this approach, at least in principle, with viruses such as the alphaviruses. Another approach was illustrated by the experiments with VSV to design a virus that could infect only HIV-infected cells. The possible use of herpesviruses to control brain tumors, especially gliomal tumors, has been cited earlier. Simple retroviruses are also being examined for this purpose. These viruses can only replicate in dividing cells. Thus, they should be able to infect only tumor cells in the brain, since most neuronal cells are terminally differentiated and do not divide. If the retroviruses express a protein that renders the cells sensitive to a toxin, it might be possible to kill replicating cells and therefore only the tumor cells.",
