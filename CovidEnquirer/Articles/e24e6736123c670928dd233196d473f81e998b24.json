Including the peritoneal macrophage test, there were four in all: (a) direct test of mice which were infected with MHV virus as determined by mortality; (b) genetic performance of mice, i.e. a test of the susceptibility of offspring obtained by crossing with resistant C~-I mice; (c) susceptibility of macrophages from cultures of newborn mouse liver; and (d) susceptibility of peritoneal macrophage cultures from adult mice. These results are presented in Table III. As can be seen, there is a consistent agreement among these four methods of measuring susceptibility, with the exception of macrophages from progeny of one mouse of the BC~ generation, which produced six out of six resistant offspring. This result may have been due to chance, since over-all results would lead one to expect 2 of the 6 mice susceptible. The genetic performance (capacity to produce susceptible offspring) showed a higher per cent of mice with the gene for susceptibility than did the three direct tests for susceptibility. The genotype may then differ slightly from the phenotype. This problem will be discussed later. It is also possible that more than one gene is responsible for susceptibility or resistance and therefore less than 50 per cent of the animals of any particular back-cross generation would be susceptible. This aspect of the problem needs further exploration. It seems clear that the gene(s) responsible for susceptibility is dominant.",

This incidence of susceptibility, which is well below the 50 per cent expected on the assumption that one gene is functioning as a dominant, may indicate that more than one gene is responsible for susceptibility. On the other hand, in a limited number of tests for genetic performance in producing susceptible offspring, slightly more than half (12/22) were capable of transmitting susceptibility. Thus the character for susceptibility, though dominant, may in the geneticist's terms be incompletely penetrant.

One mouse, No. 13, was found to produce susceptible offspring, and susceptible macrophages from its own peritoneum, but one litter of six from which liver cultures were obtained yielded no susceptible cells.

            "text": "Explanation of the resistance of CsH cells to mouse hepatitis may obviously fall into two possible categories. The cells lack a substance necessary for the growth of the virus (growth meaning all phases of penetration and multiplication) or the resistant cells may promptly form some inhibiting substance. With this in mind the crude experiments of exposing resistant and susceptible cells to extracts of the opposite type, and then testing for susceptibility were done. When it was found that a frozen-thawed extract induced the resistant cells to manifest susceptibility, immediate questions concerning the nature of this conversion became important. Susceptible cells were not made resistant by extracts of resistant cells, and the conversion of resistant cells to susceptible had a high degree of specificity, that is, it was induced by extracts of susceptible cells, and not by the cells of a number of other resistant animals and strains of mice. The question of the similarity of this phenomenon to transformation as described in bacterial genetics became immediately apparent. This phenomenon as it is presently interpreted depends upon the uptake of DNA by the bacterium, which then is incorporated into the clone of multiplying bacteria. Tests of the phenotypic expression of the ingested DNA are usually not possible before the bacterium has multiplied. The role of an increase of the DNA of the host cells, which has received the material, for the incorporation of the donor DNA and continued function of the latter is unknown. Thus although transformation is considered as a relatively permanent genetic change persisting through a number of generations, and our conversion of cells is temporary (lasting only a few days), it is not clear whether the two conditions are actually different. The lack of multiplication of cells in our system may inhibit incorporation of the DNA, and certainly does not allow us to test the more permanent conversion of a small percentage of cells. A number of tests have been made to determine the nature of the substance which converts the cells to susceptibility. Within the limits of the crude quantitation so far available, it is a relatively large molecule, since it sedimented at 5000 RP~ and did not pass through a dialysis bag. It is heat-stable, which is not unlike certain DNA extracts. However, continued tests with DNAse have shown only a partial destruction. We have as yet not tested the effect of DNAse after heat treatment or after digestion of the fresh extract with proteases. Thus the nature of the extract, which in turn bears on the nature of the conversion, is poorly understood. Niu et al have reported on ribonucleic acid-induced changes in mammalian cells (15) , in which ascites tumor cells are partially reconverted to normal cells by treatment with a nucleic acid extract, which is destroyed by RNAse and unaffected by DNAse. Our material was not affected by RNAse.",

Is there a substance in the susceptible cell which is important in the initial stage of infection, which can be transferred to the resistant cell? The fact that several days elapsed before the cells became susceptible after treat-ment with the appropriate extract speaks against this.

Parry (20) has shown that scrapie, a disease of sheep, has a strong hereditary history; the gene which causes its manifestation being a single autosomal recessive.

In all of our experiments it was apparent that large amounts of the extract were being taken into the cell. Perhaps this capacity is responsible for the occasional destruction of the resistant cells by undiluted extracts of virus contained in liver suspensions prepared from susceptible mice. This virus suspension contains extracts of the susceptible cells. However, current studies on the time of exposure of the cells to the extract before they become susceptible are slightly against this hypothesis.",

            "text": "Using peritoneal macrophage cultures it was found that both PRI mice and their macrophages in culture were susceptible to mouse hepatitis virus and that CsH mice and macrophages were resistant. All FI macrophages and some backcross cell cultures were susceptible. The degeneration of FI and back-cross macrophages obtained either from adult mouse peritoneal exudate or newborn mouse liver, occurred more slowly than PRI macrophages. Segregation of susceptibility occurred in the first back-cross generation. Tests of three backcross generations from susceptible mice yielded abou~ one-quarter of the mice shown to be susceptible either by direct test or test of their macrophages. A clear correlation between susceptibility in vivo and in vltro was established both in the test of the percentage segregation and in tests of individual back-cross mice. A small series of tests, however, indicated that 50 per cent of the backcross mice had the genetic capacity to transmit susceptibility. Thus a hypothesis of two genes for susceptibility, although not excluded, may yield to a hypothesis of a single dominant gene, incompletely expressed.",
