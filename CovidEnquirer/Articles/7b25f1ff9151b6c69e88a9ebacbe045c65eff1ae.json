Airborne transmission of pathogenic microorganisms to humans from the environment, animals, or other humans can result in disease. The lung is more susceptible to infection than the gastrointestinal tract as ingested microorganisms must pass through the acidic environment of the stomach before they can colonize tissue, while inhaled microorganisms are deposited directly on the moist surfaces of the respiratory tract. Inhalation of microbial aerosols can elicit adverse human health effects including infection, allergic reaction, inflammation, and respiratory disease.",

Bioaerosols can be comprised of bacterial cells and cellular fragments, fungal spores and fungal hyphae, viruses, and by-products of microbial metabolism. Pollen grains and other biological material can also be airborne as a bioaerosol. Microbial aerosols are generated in outdoor and indoor environments as a result of a variety of natural and anthroprogenic activities. Wind, rain and wave splash, spray irrigation, wastewater treatment activity, cooling towers and air handling water spray systems, and agricultural processes such as harvesting and tilling are examples of activities that generate bioaerosols outdoors. Indoors bioaerosols are generated and dispersed by mechanical and human activity. Industrial and manufacturing practices and biofermentation procedures can generate high concentrations of microbial aerosols. Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, water spray devices (e.g., showerheads and humidifiers), and cleaning (e.g., dusting, sweeping, vacuuming, and mopping) result in the transport of microbial materials in the air. Talking and coughing generate bioaerosols from individuals, some of which may be infectious. Facilities with medical, dental, or animal care practices can generate infectious microbial aerosols.",

            "text": "The individual particle size of particulate material in bioaerosols is generally 0.3-100 mm in diameter; larger particles tend to settle rapidly and are not readily transported in the air. Virus particles are nanometer in size, bacterial cells are approximately 1 mm in diameter, and fungal spores are >1 mm. These microorganisms can be dispersed in the air as single units, but are often present as aggregate formations. The larger aggregates have different aerodynamic properties than single-cell units; therefore their dispersal may be different than single-unit particles. Aggregates of biological material also afford protection from environmental stresses such as desiccation, and exposure to ultraviolet radiation ozone and other pollutants in the atmosphere. Often bacterial cells and virus particles are associated with skin cells, dust, and other organic or inorganic material. During agricultural practices (e.g., during harvesting, and tilling), fungus spores are released from plant surfaces and the soil and raft on other particulate matter. This \"rafting\" affects the aerodynamic characteristics and the survival of the cells in the bioaerosol. When biological material is dispersed from water sources (e.g., splash, rainfall, or cooling towers and fountains), it is generally surrounded by a thin layer of water. This moisture layer also changes the aerodynamic properties and aids in the survivability of the microorganisms while airborne.",

There are subtypes of influenza type A viruses based on two proteins on the surface proteins of the virus, hemaglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). Many animals carry influenza A viruses, while influenza B viruses circulate among humans. Both influenza types A and B viruses cause epidemics of disease almost every winter. Influenza type C infections cause a mild respiratory illness and are not thought to cause epidemics. While symptoms can be mild, influenza may result in severe illness and death. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that there are more than 200,000 hospital admissions and 36,000 deaths per year in the United States due to influenza. All ages can have serious illness from influenza, but those more likely to have complications are people aged 65 years and older, people with chronic medical conditions, and very young children. Transmission of influenza viruses is from person to person in respiratory droplets expelled during coughing and sneezing. The droplets are propelled usually less than 3 feet through the air and deposited on people in close proximity. The presence of the virus has been confirmed in aerosol particles within the breathable fraction in a study performed in a hospital emergency room (Blachere et al., 2009) . Fomites contaminated with settled infectious droplets can also serve as a vehicle for transmission of influenza.",

Illness caused by several strains of avian influenza A viruses (e.g., H5N1, H7N2, H9N2, and H7N3) have been reported since 2004. The majority of human avian influenza infections have resulted from inhalation during direct contact with infected poultry or contaminated surfaces such as avian cages, or from the ingestion of uncooked blood of infected birds. Therefore, this influenza has been popularized as \"bird flu.\" The illnesses resulting from avian influenza infection in humans range from typical mild influenza-like symptoms (e.g., fever, sore throat, cough, and muscle aches) and conjunctivitis to more serious cases of pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, and other severe and life-threatening complications. To date, there have been no sustained human-to-human transmission of avian influenza A viruses, but because of the potential for these viruses to gain the ability to spread easily between people, monitoring for human infection and person-to-person transmission is important. In addition, recent studies have addressed the possibility of long-range transport of both, Influenza and Avian influenza viruses, using dust storms as a vehicle to be dispersed at farther distances (Chen et al., 2009 (Chen et al., , 2010 .",

Since then, it has also been reported in North America and Europe. It is a viral respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus, termed SARSassociated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Exposure to SARS-CoV results from close personal contact with infected individuals. Transmission is generally the result of touching the skin of an infected person or objects contaminated with infectious droplets and then transferring the virus to the new host's eyes, nose, or mouth. Coughing or sneezing by an infected individual also releases droplets into the air that are propelled a short distance (<1 m) and deposited on the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, or eyes of persons who are nearby. It is possible that SARS can be spread further through the air by very small particles, and although it may be unusual, it has been confirmed in different environments (housing complex, aircraft, hospital facilities) Olsen et al., 2003; Yu et al., 2004) . Hand hygiene, use of gown, gloves, and eye protection when in contact with an infected individual, and use of an appropriate respirator minimizes the spread of SARS.",

Genetic analyses of patients' specimens showed similarities between MERS-CoV and other coronavirus isolated from hedgehogs, bats and camels, suggesting their possible role as reservoirs (WHO MERS-CoV Research Group, 2013) .

While it is not an infectious particle and people are exposed to them daily, endotoxin is biologically active material derived from bacteria that can affect many human organ systems and disrupt humoral and cellular host mediation systems. Symptoms of exposure to airborne endotoxin include chest tightness, cough, shortness of breath, fever, and wheezing. Obstruction of airflow and exacerbation of asthma has been related to airborne endotoxin concentrations, and atopic and nonatopic asthma have been associated with endotoxin exposure because of its ability to induce inflammatory reactions. Repeated inhalation exposure has been shown to induce allergen-specific airway inflammation. The organic dust toxic syndrome (ODTS) is an acute inflammatory condition caused by high levels of endotoxin, usually resolves within 48 h, and has a prevalence of more than 20% among farmers. Severity of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) can be increase under the influence of endotoxin exposure (Thorne and Duchaine, 2007) . Airborne endotoxin exposure is a concern in dusty occupational facilities such as cotton processing facilities and agricultural settings, and in industrial environments that utilize water spray components (e.g., machining fluids). Indoor airborne endotoxin is a concern with humidified mechanical air conditioning systems. The presence of dogs, moisture, and settled dust increase the likelihood of airborne endotoxin in the home. Despite the evidences that high concentrations of endotoxin has over human health, no limits have been established to prevent it and no international standard protocol is available to obtain comparable results (Smets et al., 2016) .",

Water-damaged buildings can also be a source for exposure, and infections have been associated with dust exposure during building renovation or construction.

Moreover, availability of new technologies, such as genetic engineering, may provide the tools to modify innocuous microorganisms or the transmission routes of other pathogens, involving a higher biosafety risk for the population (MacIntyre, 2015) . Continued researches and awareness by public health professionals are needed to recognize these diseases and minimize the risk of exposure of the population.
